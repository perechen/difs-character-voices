27	34	57	60	a very singular man	302	‘ a select circle of friends , ’
399	430	433	433	I	0	‘ How shall I admire’—these were the words that , read in a low sweet tone , first greeted his ears when he was shown softly into the sick chamber — ‘
490	652	673	673	Petronius	84	’ The clergyman was at first much reassured at hearing words so edifying ; but when he turned to old Mr. Laurence , he was dismayed to see on his pale face , no signs of awe , but only a faint smile , full of sarcastic humour . He therefore glanced at the book that was lying on the girl ’s lap , and discovered to his horror the work of the infidel historian . He was at first struck dumb ; but , soon recovering himself , began to say something suitable at once to his own profession and to the sick man ’s needs . Mr. Laurence answered him with the greatest courtesy , but with many thanks declined any assistance from him ; saying wistfully that he knew he had not long to live , and that his one wish was that he could open his veins in a bath , and so fade gently into death ; ‘
656	660	673	673	Petronius	84	’ he added , ‘
694	1376	1377	1377	You	328	’ The poor clergyman bade a hasty adieu , and Phyllis resumed her reading . Mr. Laurence listened to every word : the smile returned to his lips that had for a moment left them , and was still upon them when , half - an - hour afterwards , he died , so quietly that Phyllis did not perceive it , but continued her reading for some time to ears that could hear nothing . All his property he left to his nephew Otho , including his splendid villa , which was indeed , as it was meant to be , a type of its builder . It was a house of pillars , porticoes , and statues , designed ambitiously in what was meant to be a classical style ; and though its splendours might not be all perhaps in the best taste , nor even of the most strictly Roman pattern , there was yet an air about its meretricious stateliness by which the clays of the Empire were at once suggested to one , a magnificence that : would at any rate have pleased Trimalcio , though it might have scandalised Horace . Otho Laurence inherited with his uncle ’s house something of the tastes and feelings of which it was the embodiment . But , though an epicure by training and by temper , he had been open to other influences as well . At one time of his life he had , as it is expressed by some , experienced religion ; and not religion only , but thought and speculation also . Indeed , ever since he was twenty - four , he had been troubled by a painful sense that he ought to have some mission in life . The only difficulty was that he could find none that would suit him . He had considerable natural powers , and was in many ways a remarkable man ; but , unhappily , one of those who are remarkable because they do not become famous , not because they do . He was one of those of whom it is said till they are thirty , that they will do something ; till they are thirty - five , that they might do something if they chose ; and after that , that they might have done anything if they had chosen . Laurence was as yet only three years gone in the second stage , but such of his friends as were ambitious for him feared that three years more would find him landed in the third . He , too , was beginning to share this fear ; and , not being humble enough to despair of himself , was by this time taking to despair of his century . He was thus hardly a happy man ; but , like many unhappy men , he was capable of keen enjoyments . Chief amongst these was society in certain forms , especially a party in his own house , such as that which he had now assembled there . To this one in particular he looked forward with more than usual pleasure , partly because of the peculiar elements which he had contrived to combine in it , but chiefly because amongst them was to be his friend Robert Leslie , who had been living abroad , and whom he had not seen for two years . Laurence ’s aunt , Lady Grace , helped to receive the guests , who by dinner - time on Saturday evening had all arrived . Robert Leslie was the last . The dressing - bell had just done ringing as he drove up to the door , and the others had already gone upstairs ; but he found Laurence in the library , sitting with his head on his hand , and a pile of menu - cards on the desk before him . The two friends met with much warmth , and then examined each other ’s faces to see if either had changed . ‘
1385	1395	1377	1377	You	328	’ said Laurence , having again looked at Leslie , ‘
1408	1409	1410	1410	You	328	’ ‘
1413	1424	1410	1410	You	328	’ said Leslie , whose laugh was a little hollow , ‘
1475	1476	1477	1477	I	0	’ ‘
1481	1492	1477	1477	I	0	’ said Laurence , again examining his friend ’s face , ‘
1528	1529	1517	1517	I	0	’ ‘
1532	1536	1517	1517	I	0	’ said Leslie , ‘

1604	1608	1594	1594	he	334	’ said Laurence , ‘
1684	1685	1670	1670	I	0	’ ‘
1696	1700	1670	1670	I	0	’ said Leslie . ‘
1920	1921	1891	1926	some lady amongst your visitors who will look at me with mournful eyes , and say to me , “ Ah , if you did but know ! ” ’ ‘ Well , ’ said Laurence	1701	’ ‘
1924	1928	1891	1926	some lady amongst your visitors who will look at me with mournful eyes , and say to me , “ Ah , if you did but know ! ” ’ ‘ Well , ’ said Laurence	1701	’ said Laurence , ‘
2312	2313	2349	2349	I	0	’ ‘
2316	2320	2349	2349	I	0	’ suggested Leslie . ‘
2329	2333	2349	2349	I	0	’ said Laurence , ‘
2370	2371	2403	2403	Bottom	91	’ ‘
2380	2384	2403	2403	Bottom	91	’ said Leslie ; ‘
2466	2476	2479	2479	us	348	’ he said , taking one of the cards , ‘
2484	2485	2479	2479	us	348	’ ‘
2488	2492	2479	2479	us	348	’ said Laurence ; ‘
2645	2661	2800	2800	you	361	’ Leslie assented ; and before many minutes they had made the menu complete . The ‘
2665	2671	2800	2800	you	361	’ was to be followed by ‘
2676	2706	2800	2800	you	361	’ which was designed to introduce a discussion as to where the Aim of Life was to be best attained . After this , by an easy transition , came ‘
2709	2716	2800	2800	you	361	’ next by way of entreés , ‘
2721	2722	2800	2800	you	361	’ ‘
2727	2728	2800	2800	you	361	’ ‘
2733	2735	2800	2800	you	361	’ then ‘
2739	2765	2800	2800	you	361	’ as something solid and satisfying ; and lastly , a light superfluity to dally with , brightly coloured and unsubstantial , with the entremets came ‘
2769	2770	2800	2800	you	361	’ ‘
2776	2787	2800	2800	you	361	’ said Leslie , as they were ending their labours , ‘
2795	2796	2797	2797	I	0	’ ‘
2802	2806	2797	2797	I	0	’ said Laurence . ‘
2941	2942	2943	2943	I	0	’ ‘
2948	2952	2945	2946	Dr. Jenkinson	95	’ said Leslie , ‘
2986	2987	2988	2994	Two celebrated members of the Royal Society	371	’ ‘
2996	3000	2988	2994	Two celebrated members of the Royal Society	371	’ said Laurence ; ‘
3037	3312	3026	3026	I	0	’ IT was half - past eight , and the party were fast assembling in the twilight drawing - room . Leslie was lounging in one of the windows , by a large stand of flowers and broad - leaved plants , and was studying the company with considerable interest . His first impression was of little more than of a number of men ’s dark coats and white shirt - fronts , tables , couches , and gilded chairs , and the pleasant many - coloured glimmerings of female apparel . But before long he had observed more minutely . There were men who he instinctively felt were celebrities , discoursing to groups of ladies ; there were ladies who he at once saw were attractive , being discoursed to by groups of men . He very soon detected Lady Ambrose , a fine handsome woman of perhaps thirty , with the large grey eyes of which Laurence had spoken , and a very clear complexion . Leslie was much prepossessed by her frank manner , and by her charming voice , as she was talking with some animation to a tall distinguished - looking young man , whose fine features , keen earnest glance , and thoughtful expression prepossessed him still more . Forming a third in this group , dropping in a word or two at intervals , he recognised the celebrated Dr. Jenkinson — still full of vigour , though his hair was silver — the sharp and restless sparkle of whose eyes , strangely joined with the most benevolent of smiles , Leslie remembered to have noticed at Baron Isaacs ’
3344	3354	3356	3356	Leslie	88	‘ Dr. Jenkinson is the only one I know , ’
3358	3368	3356	3356	Leslie	88	‘ and , naturally enough , he forgets me . ’
3369	3372	3374	3374	Laurence	83	‘ Well , ’
3376	3675	3677	3677	Laurence	83	‘ that man by himself , turning over the books on the table — the man with the black whiskers , spectacles , and bushy eyebrows — is Mr. Storks of the Royal Society , who is great on the physical basis of life and the imaginative basis of God . The man with long locks in the window , explaining a microscope in so eager a way to that dark - haired girl , is Professor Stockton — of the Royal Society also ; and member and president of many Societies more . The girl — child , rather , I ought to call her — that he is talking to , is Lady Violet Gresham — my second cousin . You see my aunt , the old lady with grey curls , on the ottoman near the fire - place ? Well — the supercilious - looking man , talking rather loudly and rather slowly to her about the dust in London , is Mr. Luke , the great critic and apostle of culture . That , too , is another critic close by him — the pale creature , with large moustache , looking out of the window at the sunset . He is Mr. Rose , the pre - Raphaelite . He always speaks in an undertone , and his two topics are self - indulgence and art . The young man there with Lady Ambrose and Dr. Jenkinson , is Lord Allen . He is only two- or three - and - twenty ; still , had you been in England lately , you would often have heard his name . He has come early into an immense property , and he yet is conscious that he has duties in life . But , ’
3681	3776	3677	3677	Laurence	83	‘ he too feels , as I do , that he has fallen on evil days , in which there can be no peace for us — little but doubt and confusion , and what seems to me a losing battle against the spiritual darkness of this world . However — that redheaded youth thinks very differently . He is Mr. Saunders from Oxford , supposed to be very clever and advanced . Next him is Donald Gordon , who has deserted deer - stalking and the Kirk , for literature and German metaphysics . ’
3777	3783	3785	3785	Leslie	88	‘ And who is that , ’
3787	3808	3785	3785	Leslie	88	’ the young lady with those large and rather sad - looking eyes , and the delicate , proud mouth ? ’
3809	3812	3814	3814	Laurence	83	‘ Which ? ’
3816	3823	3825	3825	Leslie	88	‘ The one on the sofa , ’
3827	3868	3825	3825	Leslie	88	‘ who looks so like a Reynolds portrait — like a duchess of the last century — the lady in the pale blue dress , talking to that man with such a curiously attractive smile and the worn melancholy look ? ’
3869	3872	3874	3874	Laurence	83	‘ That , ’
3876	3987	3874	3874	Laurence	83	‘ is Miss Merton . I am glad you admire her . And do n’t you know who it is she is talking to ? He is almost the only man of these days for whom I feel a real reverence — almost the only one of our teachers who seems to me to speak with the least breath of inspiration . But he is too impressionable , perhaps — too much like me , in that way . And now , as the years come , it seems that hope is more and more leaving him , and things look darker to him than ever . That is Herbert . ’
3988	3991	3993	3993	Leslie	88	‘ Herbert ! ’
3995	4172	3993	3993	Leslie	88	‘ so it is . I thought I recollected the face . I have heard him lecture several times at the Royal Institution ; and that singular voice of his , which would often hold all the theatre breathless , haunts me still , sometimes . There was something strange and aërial in its exquisite modulations , that seemed as if it came from a disconsolate spirit , hovering over the waters of Babylon , and remembering Sion . I ca n’t tell exactly why it was that — but , ah!—my dear Laurence — who is this , that is coming into the room now — this lovely creature , with a dress like a red azalea ? What speaking eyes ! And what hair , too — deep dead black , with those white starry blossoms in it . I do n’t think I ever saw anyone move so gracefully ; and how proudly and piquantly she poises On her neck the small head buoyant , like a bell - flower on its bed ! ’
4173	4176	4178	4178	Laurence	83	‘ That , ’
4185	4234	4235	4235	LAURENCE	83	‘ is Mrs. Sinclair , who has published a volume of poems , and is a sort of fashionable London Sappho . But come,—we shall be going into dinner directly . You shall have Lady Ambrose on one side of you , and shall take in Miss Merton . ’
4295	4306	4307	4307	she	92	‘ What a charming change it is , Mr. Laurence , ’
4310	4329	4307	4307	she	92	‘ to look out on the sea when one is dressing , instead of across South Audley Street ! ’
4330	4333	4335	4335	Laurence	83	‘ Hush ! ’
4345	4348	4350	4351	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Really , ’
4353	4367	4350	4351	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I beg your pardon . I thought Dr. Jenkinson had said grace . ’
4368	4373	4375	4375	Laurence	83	‘ If he has , ’
4377	4432	4375	4375	Laurence	83	‘ it is very good of him , for I am afraid he was not asked . But what I mean is , that you must only talk of what is on the cards ; so be good enough to look at your menu , and devote your attention to the Aim of Life . ’
4433	4442	4444	4445	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Really , this is much too alarming , ’
4447	4468	4444	4445	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ How is one to talk at so short a notice on a subject one has never thought about before ? ’
4469	4476	4478	4478	Laurence	83	‘ Why , to do so , ’
4480	4557	4478	4478	Laurence	83	‘ is the very art of conversation ; for in that way , one ’s ideas spring up fresh like young roses that have all the dew on them , instead of having been kept drying for half a lifetime between the leaves of a book . So do set a good example , and begin , or else we shall never be started at all ; and my pet plan will turn out a fiasco . ’
4583	4594	4478	4478	Laurence	83	‘ Are you High - church or Low - church ? ’
4674	4682	4683	4683	he	83	‘ Can you tell me the difference ? ’
4706	4710	4712	4713	Miss Merton	93	‘ I think , ’
4725	4753	4712	4713	Miss Merton	93	‘ that my card is a little different . I have the “ Aim of Life ” on mine , and so I believe has everybody else . ’
4754	4757	4759	4760	the Doctor	376	‘ Well , ’
4764	4777	4759	4760	the Doctor	376	‘ let us ask Miss Prattle what is her aim in life . ’
4778	4782	4784	4784	Laurence	83	‘ Thank Heaven , ’
4786	4800	4784	4784	Laurence	83	‘ Dr. Jenkinson has begun . I hope we shall all now follow . ’
5035	5038	5012	5012	She	92	‘ Please , ’
5043	5057	5012	5012	She	92	‘ do try and keep to the point — please , Lady Ambrose . ’
5058	5078	5079	5079	she	92	‘ I want to find out Mr. Leslie ’s aim in life by asking him where he has been , ’
5082	5092	5094	5094	Leslie	114	‘ I have been in a great many places , ’
5096	5117	5094	5094	Leslie	114	‘ but not to pursue any end — only to try and forget that I had no end to pursue . ’
5118	5128	5130	5131	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ This is a very sad state of things , ’
5133	5211	5130	5131	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I can always find something to do , except when I am quite alone , or in the country when the house is empty . And even then I can make occupation . I draw , or read a book , or teach my little boy some lessons . But come — what do you think is the real aim of life?—since that is what I must ask him , is it not , Mr. Laurence ? ’
5212	5218	5220	5220	Leslie	114	‘ Do n’t ask me , ’
5222	5243	5220	5220	Leslie	114	‘ I told you I had n’t a notion ; and I do n’t suppose we any of us have . ’
5244	5251	5253	5254	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ That ca n’t be true , ’
5256	5293	5253	5254	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ for just listen how everyone is talking . I wish we could hear what they are saying . You might learn something then , perhaps , Mr. Leslie , since you are so very ignorant . ’
5332	5338	5339	5339	he	83	‘ because we up here , ’
5342	5356	5339	5339	he	83	‘ are very much in the dark , and want to be enlightened . ’
5357	5360	5362	5363	Mr. Storks	113	‘ Yes , ’
5366	5379	5362	5363	Mr. Storks	113	‘ has any one found out what is the aim of life ? ’
5459	5465	5466	5466	he	392	‘ The aim of life , ’
5473	5477	5466	5466	he	392	‘ is progress . ’
5478	5483	5485	5486	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ What is progress ? ’
5510	5513	5515	5516	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Progress , ’
5519	5532	5515	5516	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ has been found , like poetry , somewhat hard to define . ’
5533	5537	5539	5540	the Doctor	376	‘ Very true , ’
5579	5583	5584	5584	he	392	‘ But I , ’
5591	5693	5584	5584	he	392	‘ have discovered a definition which will , I think , meet with general acceptance . There is nothing original in it — it is merely an abstract of the meaning of all our great liberal thinkers — progress is such improvement as can be verified by statistics , just as education is such knowledge as can be tested by examinations . That , I conceive , is a very adequate definition of the most advanced conception of progress , and to persuade people in general to accept this is at present one of the chief duties of all earnest men . ’
5694	5698	5700	5701	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Entirely true ! ’
5707	5720	5700	5701	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ an entirely true definition of progress as our age prizes it . ’
5744	5750	5751	5751	he	392	‘ For just let us , ’
5754	5837	5751	5751	he	392	‘ compare a man with a gorilla , and see in what the man ’s superiority lies . It is evidently not in the man ’s ideas of God , and so forth — for in his presumable freedom from these the gorilla is the superior of the man — but in the hard and verifiable fact , that the man can build houses and cotton - mills , whereas the highest monkey can scarcely make the rudest approach to a hut . ’
5838	5845	5847	5848	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ But can you tell me , ’
5850	5875	5847	5848	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ supposing men some day come to a state in which no more of this progress is possible , what will they do then ? ’
5876	5892	5894	5895	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Mr. Mill , whom in almost all things I reverence as a supreme authority , ’
5897	5956	5894	5895	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ asked himself that very question . But the answer he gave himself was one of the few things in which I venture to dissent from him . For , when all the greater evils of life shall have been removed , he thinks the human race is to find its chief enjoyment in reading Wordsworth ’s poetry . ’
5957	5960	5962	5963	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Indeed ! ’
5965	5978	5962	5963	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ and did Mill come to any conclusion so sane as that ? ’
5979	5988	5989	5990	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ I , on the contrary , believe , ’
5994	6032	5989	5990	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ that as long as the human race lasts , it will still have some belief in God left in it , and that the eradication of this will afford an unending employment to all enlightened minds . ’
6056	6063	6048	6048	she	92	‘ I think this is shocking . ’
6064	6067	6069	6069	Laurence	83	‘ Well , ’
6077	6108	6069	6069	Laurence	83	‘ it is only the way of these young men in times of change like ours . Besides , he is very young — he has only just left Oxford — ’
6109	6122	6124	6125	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ If these irreligious views are to be picked up at Oxford , ’
6127	6197	6124	6125	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I shall be obliged to send my little boy , when he grows up , to Cambridge . And as for what you say about “ times of change ” — I am not a conservative , as you know — indeed , I quite go in for reform , as my husband does : but I do n’t think religion ought to be dragged into the matter . ’
6198	6201	6203	6203	Laurence	83	‘ Well , ’
6205	6216	6203	6203	Laurence	83	‘ let us listen to what Lord Allen is saying . ’
6217	6222	6224	6225	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ He is sure , ’
6227	6237	6224	6225	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ not to say anything but what is nice . ’
6262	6268	6269	6269	he	101	‘ To me it seems , ’
6288	6312	6269	6269	he	101	‘ that the aim of life has nearly always been plain enough in a certain way — always , and for all men — ’
6313	6316	6318	6319	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Indeed ? ’
6325	6328	6330	6330	Allen	101	‘ Yes , ’
6343	6403	6330	6330	Allen	101	‘ It has been , I think , as a single magnet , acting on all , though upon many by repulsion . It is quite indescribable in words . But there are two things by which you can tell a man ’s truth to it — a faith in God . and a longing for a future life . ’
6404	6408	6410	6411	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Lord Allen , ’
6426	6488	6489	6489	he	112	‘ that is very beautifully put ! And it is , indeed , quite true , as you say , that the real significance of life must be for ever indescribable in words . But , in the present day , I fear also that for most of us it is not even thinkable in thought . The whole human race , ’
6497	6657	6489	6489	he	112	‘ is now wandering in an accursed wilderness , which not only shows us no hilltop whence the promised land may be seen , but which , to most of the wanderers , seems a promised land itself . And they have a God of their own too , who engages now to lead them out of it if they will only follow him : who , for visible token of his Godhead , leads them with a pillar of cloud by day , and a pillar of fire by night — the cloud being the black smoke of their factory chimneys , and the fire the red glare of their blast - furnaces . And so effectual are these modern divine guides , that if we were standing on the brink of Jordan itself , we should be utterly unable to catch , through the fire and the smoke , one single glimpse of the sunlit hills beyond . ’
6685	6689	6690	6690	he	100	‘ To me , ’
6711	6864	6866	6867	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Mr. Herbert ’s whole metaphor seems misleading . I rather look upon life as a chamber , which we decorate as we would decorate the chamber of the woman or the youth that we love , tinting the walls of it with symphonies of subdued colour , and filling it with works of fair form , and with flowers , and with strange scents , and with instruments of music . And this can be done now as well — better , rather — than at any former time : since we know that so many of the old aims were false , and so cease to be distracted by them . We have learned the weariness of creeds ; and know that for us the grave has no secrets . We have learned that the aim of life is life ; and what does successful life consist in ? Simply , ’
6879	6941	6866	6867	Mr. Rose	100	‘ in the consciousness of exquisite living — in the making our own each highest thrill of joy that the moment offers us — be it some touch of colour on the sea or on the mountains , the early dew in the crimson shadows of a rose , the shining of a woman ’s limbs in clear water , or — ’
6947	6948	6694	6694	his	100	‘ ’
6950	7015	6694	6694	his	100	’ broke softly from several mouths . Mr. Rose was slightly disconcerted , and a pause that would have been a little awkward seemed imminent . Laurence , to prevent this , did the first thing that occurred to him , and hastily asked Dr. Jenkinson what his view of the matter was . The Doctor ’s answer came in his very sharpest voice . ‘
7025	7029	6694	6694	his	100	’ he said . ‘
7039	7040	6694	6694	his	100	’ ‘
7043	7054	6694	6694	his	100	’ continued Mr. Rose , who had now recovered himself , ‘
7063	7064	6694	6694	his	100	’ ‘
7075	7080	6694	6694	his	100	’ said Dr. Jenkinson . ‘
7087	7094	6694	6694	his	100	’ said Mr. Storks , severely . ‘
7101	7134	6694	6694	his	100	’ muttered Leslie to himself , but just loud enough to be heard by Lady Ambrose , who smiled at him with a sense of humour that won his heart at once . ‘
7139	7145	6694	6694	his	100	’ Mr. Storks went on , ‘
7162	7163	7164	7165	Lord Allen	101	’ ‘
7178	7183	7164	7165	Lord Allen	101	’ said Mr. Saunders . ‘
7188	7192	7164	7165	Lord Allen	101	’ said Laurence , ‘
7214	7215	7210	7212	the wrong person	400	’ ‘
7223	7228	7210	7212	the wrong person	400	’ said Mr. Saunders , ‘
7295	7296	7297	7297	I	0	’ ‘
7303	7321	7297	7297	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sinclair , in her soft clear voice , and casting down her eyes thoughtfully , ‘
7382	7387	7434	7435	Mrs. Sinclair	106	’ she said dreamily , ‘
7415	7416	7370	7370	they	403	’ ‘
7421	7431	7370	7370	they	403	’ said Mr. Luke , looking compassionately about him . ‘
7474	7483	7487	7488	Mr. Luke	99	’ Lady Ambrose was charmed with this sentiment . ‘
7496	7506	7490	7490	I	0	’ she said , in her most cordial manner . ‘
7530	7531	7520	7520	I	0	’ ‘
7534	7539	7520	7520	I	0	’ said Mr. Luke , ‘
7696	7704	7767	7767	I	0	’ Mr. Luke added with a sigh , ‘
7719	7720	7767	7767	I	0	’ ‘
7724	7728	7767	7767	I	0	’ said Allen , ‘
7748	7749	7789	7789	It	406	’ ‘
7752	7757	7789	7789	It	406	’ said Mr. Luke , ‘
7892	7908	7886	7886	you	99	’ he added , addressing the Doctor across the table in a loud mournful voice . ‘
7911	7922	7886	7886	you	99	’ said the Doctor , apparently not hearing the question , ‘
7956	8146	8148	8148	he	408	’ These words of the Doctor ’s caused a rapid change in the conversation . And as it appeared impossible to agree as to what the aim of life was , most turned eagerly to the simpler question of where it might be best attained . At first there seemed to be a general sense on all sides that it was a duty to prefer the country . There , the voices of Nature spoke to the soul more freely , the air was purer and fresher ; the things in life that were really valuable were more readily taken at their true worth ; foolish vanities and trivial cares were less likely to degrade the character ; one could have flowers ; one could listen to the music of birds and rivers ; a country house was more comfortable than a town one ; and few prospects were so charming as an English park . But the voice of Mr. Saunders was soon heard proclaiming that progress was almost entirely confined to towns , and that the modern liberal could find little scope for action in the country . ‘
8153	8158	8159	8159	he	408	’ Mr. Saunders said , ‘
8256	8292	8230	8243	a far nobler creature in the pale narrow - chested operative of the city	412	’ Slight causes often produce large results ; and these utterances of Mr. Saunders turned the entire torrent of opinion into a different channel . Mr. Luke , who had a moment before been talking about ‘
8296	8298	8230	8243	a far nobler creature in the pale narrow - chested operative of the city	412	’ and ‘
8302	8304	8230	8243	a far nobler creature in the pale narrow - chested operative of the city	412	’ and ‘
8308	8500	8230	8243	a far nobler creature in the pale narrow - chested operative of the city	412	’ now admitted that one ’s country neighbours were sure to be narrow - minded sectarians , and that it was better to live amongst cultured society , even under a London fog , than to look at all the splendour of provincial sunsets , in company with a parson who could talk of nothing but his parishioners and justification by faith . Others , too , followed in the same direction ; and the verdict of the majority soon seemed to be that , except in a large country house , country life , though it might be very beautiful , was still very tiresome . But the voice of Mr. Saunders was again heard , during a pause , laying it down that no true liberal could ever care to live in the country now ; and Lady Ambrose , who highly disapproved of him and his views in general , saw here a fitting opportunity for contradicting him , asserting that , though she and her husband were both advanced , liberals , yet the pleasantest part of their year was that spent upon their moor in Scotland . ‘
8506	8514	8515	8515	I	0	’ she added , turning to Laurence , ‘
8549	8550	8580	8580	he	122	’ ‘
8554	8560	8580	8580	he	122	’ said Laurence , smiling , ‘
8577	8578	8580	8580	he	122	’ ‘
8583	8592	8580	8580	he	122	’ said Lady Ambrose , a little indignantly . ‘
8613	8678	8593	8593	He	122	’ But she was here interrupted by Mr. Herbert , who , mistaking the Sir George Ambrose mentioned for another Baronet of the same name — a gentleman of a very old but impoverished Catholic family — broke in as follows , somewhat to the consternation of Lady Ambrose , whose husband was a great cotton - spinner , of the most uncertain origin . ‘
8682	8686	8679	8680	Sir George	122	’ he said , ‘
8839	9005	9019	9020	a Nobility	428	’ Now , the husband of Lady Ambrose being known to most present for his magnificent new country house , his immense preserves , and his yacht of four hundred tons that never went out of the Solent , there was naturally some wonder excited by Mr. Herbert ’s words , since the thought of any other Sir George never came for an instant into anyone ’s head . Lady Ambrose herself was in utter amazement . She could not tell what to make of it , and she was as near looking confused as she had ever been in her life . The awkwardness of the situation was felt by many : and to cover it a hum of conversation sprang up , with forced alacrity . But this did not make matters much better ; for in a very short time Mr. Herbert ’s voice was again audible , uttering words of no measured denunciation against the great land - owners of England , ‘
9010	9014	9019	9020	a Nobility	428	’ he said , ‘
9036	9093	9097	9097	they	430	’ Everyone felt that this was approaching dangerous ground : nor were they at all reassured when Mr. Herbert , who was , it appeared , quoting from a letter which he had received , he said , that morning from the greatest of modern thinkers , concluded amidst a complete silence with the following passage , ‘
9189	9251	9177	9177	plutocrats	437	’ These last words came like a thunderclap . Laurence hardly knew where to look . The result , however , was more satisfactory than could have been expected . There are some emotions , as we all know , that can be calmed best by tears . Lady Ambrose did not cry . She did something better — she laughed . ‘
9259	9265	9266	9266	He	122	’ she whispered to Laurence . ‘
9282	9295	9278	9278	you	439	’ she went on , being resolved not to shirk the subject , ‘
9333	9334	9330	9330	he	112	’ ‘
9342	9361	9339	9340	Lady Ambrose	92	’ said Mr. Herbert , who concluded that he had given her much pleasure by his late remarks , ‘
9385	9386	9376	9376	Grammont	123	’ ‘
9390	9395	9376	9376	Grammont	123	’ said Mr. Luke ; ‘

9486	9490	9482	9482	Charles	124	’ said Leslie , ‘

9517	9522	9507	9511	a fool and a dunce	446	’ said Mr. Herbert , ‘
9646	9647	9639	9639	It	448	’ ‘
9656	9668	9653	9654	Mr. Herbert	112	’ said Lady Ambrose , who felt bound to say something , ‘
9678	9679	9653	9654	Mr. Herbert	112	’ ‘
9682	9690	9653	9654	Mr. Herbert	112	’ said Laurence , shrugging his shoulders , ‘

10698	10793	10697	10697	Cervantes	126	’ time than England is in ours ; but you may search all our novels for one character that has one tithe of Don Quixote ’s heroism , for one of our sane men that breathed in so healthy and pure an atmosphere as the inspired madman . And this is not from want of ability on the novelist ’s part . Some of them have powers enough and to spare ; but the best novels only reflect back most clearly the social anarchy , and the bad ones are unconscious parts of it . ’
10794	10801	10803	10804	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ And as for our painting , ’
10806	10903	10803	10804	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ that reflects , even more clearly than our literature , our hideous and our hopeless degradation . The other day , when I walked through the Royal Academy , my mind was literally dazzled by the infernal glare of corruption and vulgarity that was flashed upon me from every side . There were , indeed , only two pictures in the whole collection that were not entirely abominable ; and these were , one of them three boulders in the island of Sark , the other a study of pebbles on the beach at Ilfracombe . ’
10904	10914	10916	10917	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ I know little about the technicalities of art , ’
10919	10932	10916	10917	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ so I will not presume to dispute this point with you . ’
10933	10936	10938	10938	Leslie	114	‘ Well , ’
10940	10964	10938	10938	Leslie	114	‘ here is another test quite as good as art and literature — love and money , and their relations in our days . ’
10979	10984	10985	10985	he	112	‘ The very things , ’
10988	11136	10985	10985	he	112	‘ I was about to touch upon — the very things the pictures the other day suggested to me . For , seeing how the work of the painter becomes essentially vile so soon as it becomes essentially venal , I was reminded of the like corruption of what is far more precious than the work of any painter — our own English girls , who are prepared for the modern marriage - market on precisely the same principles as our pictures for the Royal Academy . There is but one difference . The work of the modern painter is vile from its very beginning — in its conception and execution alike ; but our girls we receive , in the first instance , entirely fair and sacred from the hands of God himself , clothed upon with a lovelier vesture than any lilies of the field — ’
11137	11140	11142	11143	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Really , ’
11147	11163	11142	11143	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Providence has done so very little for us , as far as vesture goes . ’
11164	11169	11170	11171	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ — And we , ’
11175	11245	11170	11171	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ with unspeakable profanity presume to dress and to decorate them , till the heavenly vesture is entirely hidden , thinking , like a modern Simon Magus , that the gifts of God are to be purchased for money , and not caring to perceive that , if they are to be purchased with the devil ’s money , we must first convert them into the devil ’s gifts . ’
11246	11249	11251	11252	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Yes , ’
11259	11272	11251	11252	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ the day for love - matches is quite gone over now . ’

11342	11348	11350	11351	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ I have considered them , ’
11353	11365	11350	11351	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ for the last thirty years — and with inexpressible melancholy . ’
11366	11370	11372	11373	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ I conceive , ’
11375	11385	11372	11373	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ that you are somewhat singular in your feelings . ’
11386	11390	11392	11393	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ I am , ’
11395	11486	11392	11393	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ and that in most of my opinions and feelings I am singular , is a fact fraught for me with the most ominous significance . Yet , how could I — who think that health is more than wealth , and who hold it a more important thing to separate right from wrong than to identify men with monkeys — how could I hope to be anything but singular in a generation that deliberately , and with its eyes open , prefers a cotton - mill to a Titian ? ’
11487	11492	11494	11495	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ I hold it , ’
11497	11577	11494	11495	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ to be one of the great triumphs of our day , that it has so subordinated all the vaguer and more lawless sentiments to the solid guidance of sober economical considerations . And not only do I consider a cotton - mill , but I consider even a good sewer , to be a far nobler and a far holier thing — for holy in reality does but mean healthy — than the most admired Madonna ever painted . ’
11578	11583	11585	11586	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ A good sewer , ’
11588	11632	11585	11586	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ is , I admit , an entirely holy thing ; and would all our manufacturers and men of science bury themselves underground , and confine their attention to making sewers , I , for one , should have little complaint against them . ’
11633	11678	11494	11495	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ And are railways , telegraphs , gas - lamps — is the projected Channel tunnel , nothing in your eyes ? Is it nothing that all the conditions of life are ameliorated , that mind is daily pursuing farther its conquest over matter ? ’
11679	11688	11690	11691	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Have we much to thank you for , ’
11693	11827	11690	11691	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ that you have saved us from an hour of sea - sickness , if in return you give us a whole lifetime of heart - sickness ? Your mind , my good sir , that you boast of , is so occupied in subduing matter , that it is entirely forgetful of subduing itself — a matter , trust me , that is far more important . And as for your amelioration of the conditions of life — that is not civilisation which saves a man from the need of exercising any of his powers , but which obliges him to exert his noble powers ; not that which satisfies his lower feelings with the greatest ease , but which provides satisfaction for his higher feelings , no matter at what trouble . ’
11828	11834	11836	11837	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Other things being equal , ’
11839	11866	11836	11837	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ I apprehend that the generation that travels sixty miles an hour is at least five times as civilised as the generation that travels only twelve . ’
11867	11876	11878	11879	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ But the other things are not equal , ’
11881	11921	11878	11879	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ and the other things , by which I suppose you mean all that is really sacred in the life of man , have been banished or buried by the very things which we boast of as our civilisation . ’
11922	11929	11931	11932	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ That is our own fault , ’
11934	11941	11836	11837	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ not the fault of civilisation . ’
11942	11946	11948	11949	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Not so , ’
11951	12005	11948	11949	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Bring up a boy to do nothing for himself — make everything easy for him — to use your own expression , subdue matter for him — and that boy will never be able to subdue anything for himself . He will be weak in body , and a coward in soul — ’
12006	12009	12011	12012	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Precisely , ’
12014	12139	12011	12012	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ And that is really , if you look dispassionately at the matter , a consummation devoutly to be wished . For why do we need our bodies to be strong?—To overcome obstacles . Why do we need to be brave?—To attack enemies . But by and by , when all our work is done by machinery , and we have no longer any obstacles to overcome , or any hardships to endure , strength will become useless , and bravery dangerous . And my own hope is that both will have ere long vanished ; and that weakness and cowardice , qualities which we now so irrationally despise , will have vindicated their real value , by turning universal civilisation into universal peace . ’
12140	12143	12145	12146	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Yes , ’
12148	12178	12011	12012	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ that is exactly what the modern world is longing for — a universal peace ; which never can nor will mean anything else than peace with the devil . ’

12189	12227	12184	12185	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ do you think we are in such a bad way as all this ? Dr. Jenkinson , I must ask you — you always know these things — do you think we are so very bad ? ’
12228	12233	12235	12236	the Doctor	376	‘ Yes — yes , ’
12246	12299	12235	12236	the Doctor	376	‘ there is a great deal that is very bad in our own days — very bad indeed . Many thoughtful people think that there is more that is bad in the present than there has ever been in the past . Many thoughtful people in all days have thought the same . ’
12300	12305	12307	12307	Herbert	112	‘ Whenever wise men , ’
12309	12371	12307	12307	Herbert	112	‘ have taken to thinking about their own times , it is quite true that they have always thought ill of them . But that is because the times must have gone wrong before the wise men take to the business of thinking about them at all . We are never conscious of our constitutions till they are out of order . ’
12372	12377	12379	12380	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Ah ! yes , ’
12382	12420	12379	12380	Mr. Luke	99	‘ how true that is , Herbert ! Philosophy may be a golden thing . But it is the gold of the autumn woods , that soon falls , and leaves the boughs of the nation naked . ’

12428	12443	12426	12426	Leslie	114	‘ leaving nothing but Bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang . ’
12444	12451	12453	12454	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Thank you , Mr. Leslie , ’
12459	12468	12453	12454	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ thank you — an exquisitely apt quotation . ’
12469	12476	12478	12479	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Then you , Mr. Leslie , ’
12485	12508	12478	12479	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ you are one of these desponding people too , are you ? I never heard anything so dismal in my life . ’
12509	12514	12516	12516	Leslie	114	‘ I certainly think , ’
12518	12549	12516	12516	Leslie	114	‘ that our age in some ways could not possibly be worse . Nobody knows what to believe , and most people believe nothing . Do n’t you find that ? ’
12550	12556	12558	12559	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Indeed I do not , ’
12565	12580	12581	12581	she	92	‘ and I am very sorry for those who do . That Mr. Saunders , ’
12588	12785	12581	12581	she	92	‘ is the first person I ever heard express such views . We were dining only the other day with the Bishop of — — , and I ’ll tell you what he said , Mr. Leslie . He said that the average number of churches built yearly during the last ten years was greater than it had ever been since the Reformation . That does not look as if religion was on the decline , does it ? I know the Bishop spoke of a phase of infidelity that was passing over the nation : but that , he said , would soon have drifted by . Indeed , he told us that all the teachings of modern irreligious science were simply reproductions of — you must not laugh at me if I say the names wrong — Epicurus and Democritus — which had been long ago refuted . And that was no peculiar crotchet of his own mind ; for a very clever gentleman who was sitting next me said that that was the very thing which all the bishops agreed in saying — almost the only thing indeed in which they did agree . ’
12786	12789	12791	12791	Leslie	114	‘ Ah ! ’
12793	12851	12791	12791	Leslie	114	‘ materialism once came to the world like a small street boy throwing mud at it ; and the indignant world very soon drove it away . But it has now come back again , dirtier than ever , bringing a big brother with it , and Heaven knows when we shall get rid of it now . ’
12852	12859	12861	12862	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ In every state of transition , ’
12867	12881	12882	12882	he	95	‘ there must always be much uneasiness . But I do n’t think , ’
12891	12972	12882	12882	he	95	‘ that you will find these times really much worse than those that went before them . No — no . If we look at them soberly , they are really a great deal better . We have already got rid of a vast amount of superstition and ignorance , and are learning what Christianity really is . We are learning true reverence — that is , not to dogmatise about subjects of which we can not possibly know anything . ’
12973	12979	12981	12982	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Just so , Jenkinson , ’
12984	13017	12981	12982	Mr. Luke	99	’ that is the very thing I am trying to teach the world myself . Personal immortality , for instance , which forms no part of the sweet secret of authentic Christianity — ’
13018	13023	13025	13026	the Doctor	376	‘ Yes — yes , ’
13029	13044	13025	13026	the Doctor	376	‘ the Church had degraded the doctrine . It needed to be expressed anew . ’
13045	13049	13051	13052	Miss Merton	93	‘ Of course , ’
13054	13061	13051	13052	Miss Merton	93	‘ I , as a Catholic — ’
13062	13067	13069	13070	the Doctor	376	‘ Dear ! dear ! ’
13076	13092	13069	13070	the Doctor	376	‘ I beg your pardon . I had no notion you were a Roman Catholic . ’
13093	13100	13101	13102	Miss Merton	93	‘ I was going to say , ’
13106	13174	13175	13175	she	93	‘ that , though of course as a Catholic I am not without what I believe to be an infallible guide , I feel just as much as anyone the bad state in which things are now . It is so difficult to shape one ’s course in life . One has nowhere any work cut out for one . There is a want of — well — ’
13180	13202	13175	13175	she	93	‘ of what perhaps , when religion has been analysed by science , will be called moral ozone in the air . ’
13203	13211	13213	13214	the Doctor	376	‘ Such a feeling is not unnatural , ’
13216	13248	13249	13249	he	376	‘ but you will find it vanish if you just resolve cheerfully to go on doing the duty next you — even if this be only to order dinner . And , ’
13258	13291	13249	13249	he	376	‘ do n’t despond over the times : that only makes them worse . Besides , they are not really at all bad . There is no need for desponding at all . ’
13292	13300	13302	13302	Laurence	83	‘ But there is at least excuse , ’
13304	13344	13302	13302	Laurence	83	‘ when we see all the old faiths , the old ideas , under which the world has so long found shelter , fading Like the baseless fabric of a vision , rapidly and for ever away from us . ’
13345	13352	13354	13355	the Doctor	376	‘ I do n’t think so , ’
13364	13367	13369	13370	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ Christianity , ’
13372	13410	13369	13370	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ is only retiring to make way for something better . Religions are not quickened unless they perish . Look forward at the growing brightness of the future , not at the faded brightness of the past . ’
13411	13419	13421	13422	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Why not look at the present ? ’
13424	13464	13421	13422	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Depend upon it , it is not wise to be above one ’s times . There ’s plenty of religion now . The real power of Christianity is growing every day , even where you least expect it . ’
13465	13472	13474	13474	Leslie	114	‘ In what part of Christianity , ’
13476	13550	13474	13474	Leslie	114	‘ its real power lies , it would be unbecoming in me to profess that I know . But this I do know , that if you take four out of five of the more thoughtful and instructed men of the day , you will find that not only have they no faith in a personal God or a personal immortality , but the very notions of such things seem to them absurdities . ’
13551	13554	13556	13557	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Yes , ’
13559	13596	13556	13557	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ it was once thought a characteristic of the lowest savages to be without a belief in a future life . It will soon be thought a characteristic of the lowest savages to be with one . ’
13597	13601	13603	13604	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Really now — ’
13619	13642	13603	13604	Mr. Luke	99	‘ personal immortality and a personal Deity are no doctrines of Christianity . You , Jenkinson , I know agree with me . ’
13673	13677	13678	13678	he	99	‘ You see , ’
13691	13760	13678	13678	he	99	‘ the age we live in is an age of change . And in all such ages there must be many things that , if we let them , will pain and puzzle us . But we must n’t let them . There have been many ages of change before our time , and there are sure to be many after it . Our age is not peculiar . ’
13838	13844	13846	13846	Leslie	114	‘ But in some ways , ’
13848	13885	13846	13846	Leslie	114	‘ this age is peculiar , surely . It is peculiar in the extraordinary rapidity of its changes . Christianity took three hundred years to supplant polytheism ; atheism has hardly taken thirty to supplant Christianity . ’
13899	13903	13905	13906	Miss Merton	93	‘ I suppose , ’
13910	13922	13905	13906	Miss Merton	93	‘ that you think Catholicism quite a thing of the past ? ’
13923	13925	13846	13846	Leslie	114	‘ I ’m

14512	14528	14505	14505	they	355	’ Mr. Storks here drew his chair to the table , and cleared his throat . ‘
14533	14537	14505	14505	they	355	’ he said , ‘

15008	15018	14993	14993	We	487	’ said Mr. Herbert , turning to the Doctor , ‘

15849	15854	15855	15855	Thales	137	’ interposed Dr. Jenkinson . ‘
15869	15898	15865	15865	Pindar	136	’ But the Doctor ’s words were utterly unavailing to check the torrent of Mr. Herbert ’s eloquence . They only turned it into a slightly different course . ‘
15906	15911	15865	15865	Pindar	136	’ he went on , ‘
16020	16086	15982	15982	its	524	’ During all this speech Mr. Storks had remained with his face buried in his hands , every now and then drawing in his breath through his teeth , as if he were in pain . When it was over he looked up with a scared expression , as if he hardly knew where he was , and seemed quite unable to utter a syllable . ‘
16090	16095	15982	15982	its	524	’ said Mr. Stockton , ‘

16456	16462	16647	16648	Mr. Saunders	102	’ exclaimed Mr. Saunders eagerly . ‘
16466	16476	16477	16477	he	0	’m not at all that sort of man myself , ’
16481	16492	16477	16477	he	0	‘ so do n’t think it because I say this . ’
16507	16515	16516	16516	he	0	‘ We think it , for instance , ’
16519	16604	16516	16516	he	0	‘ a very sad thing when a girl is as we call it ruined . But it is we really that make all the sadness . She is ruined only because we think she is so . And I have little doubt that that higher philosophy of the future that Mr. Storks speaks of will go far , some day , towards solving the great question of women ’s sphere of action , by its recognition of prostitution as an honourable and beneficent profession . ’
16605	16608	16610	16611	Mr. Storks	113	‘ Sir ! ’
16625	16636	16622	16623	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ I could hardly have believed that such misplaced flippancy — ’
16637	16645	16647	16648	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Flippancy ! it is reasoned truth , ’
16669	16672	16673	16673	he	83	‘ See , ’
16676	16695	16673	16673	he	83	‘ Dr. Jenkinson has left us . Will no one have any more wine?—Then suppose we follow him . ’
16812	16828	16798	16799	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Well , Mr. Laurence , we have been talking most industriously about the future . ’
16856	16861	16863	16863	Laurence	83	‘ Do you remember , ’
16865	16888	16863	16863	Laurence	83	‘ that it was here , three years ago , that you composed the lines that stand last in your published volumes ? ’
16889	16893	16895	16896	Mr. Luke	99	‘ I remember , ’
16899	16906	16895	16896	Mr. Luke	99	‘ What an evening that was ! ’
16907	16915	16917	16917	Laurence	83	‘ I wish you would repeat them , ’
16919	16925	16927	16928	Mr. Luke	99	‘ What is the good ? ’
16930	16946	16927	16928	Mr. Luke	99	‘ why rouse again the voices that haunt About the mouldered lodges of the past ? ’
16947	16951	16953	16954	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Mr. Luke , ’
16957	16965	16953	16954	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I do so wish you would . ’
16966	16975	16977	16978	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Is Mr. Luke going to recite poetry ? ’
16986	16990	16977	16978	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ How delicious ! ’
17058	17068	17070	17071	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Thank you , Mr. Luke , so much , ’
17073	17088	17070	17071	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ How charming ! I am always so fond of poems about the sea . ’
17089	17092	17094	17095	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Ah , ’
17102	17110	17099	17100	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ these are emotions scarcely worth describing . ’
17111	17115	17117	17118	Mr. Storks	113	‘ Certainly not , ’
17199	17329	17330	17330	We	544	’ dresses , and struck here and there a furtive flash from a gem on wrist or throat . The tranquil hour seemed to have a tranquillising effect on nearly everyone ; and the conversation reached Mr. Luke ’s ears as a low murmur , broken only by the deep sound of Mr. Storks ’s voice , and the occasional high notes of Mr. Saunders , who seemed to Mr. Luke , in his present frame of mind , to be like a shrill cock crowing to the world before the sunrise of universal philistinism . Laurence meanwhile had caught Miss Merton ’s eyes looking at him with a grave regard ; and this had brought him instantly to her side , when Mr. Luke had ended his recital . ‘
17347	17358	17345	17345	we	544	’ he said slowly to her in a low voice . ‘

17925	17931	17933	17934	Miss Merton	93	‘ And do you think , ’
17940	17980	17981	17981	she	93	‘ that belief in these days brings no painful perplexities too ? Do you think that we can look out on the state of the world now , and think about its future , without anxiety ? But really , ’
17989	18031	17981	17981	she	93	‘ if I , like you , thought that Christianity was not true , I should not waste my time in lamenting over it . I should rather be glad that I had got free from a gigantic and awful imposition . ’
18032	18035	18037	18037	Laurence	83	‘ What ! ’
18039	18075	18037	18037	Laurence	83	‘ should we rejoice at our old guide dropping dead amongst the mountains , even though he had lost his way ; if so we are left hopeless , and without any guide at all ? ’
18076	18082	18084	18085	Miss Merton	93	‘ You have your consciences , ’
18094	18108	18091	18091	her	93	‘ you surely do n’t mean to say that you have lost them ? ’
18109	18115	18117	18117	Leslie	114	‘ As for our consciences , ’
18125	18203	18117	18117	Leslie	114	‘ we revere them so much that we fancy they possess some power . But conscience , in most souls , is like an English Sovereign — it reigns , but it does not govern . Its function is merely to give a formal assent to the Bills passed by the passions ; and it knows , if it opposes what those are really bent upon , that ten to one it will be obliged to abdicate . ’
18204	18220	18222	18223	Miss Merton	93	‘ Let us hope that the constitutions of most souls are more stable than that , ’
18225	18280	18222	18223	Miss Merton	93	‘ As far as morality goes , I expect you have quite enough to guide you ; and if you think religion false , I do n’t see why its loss should trouble you . And life itself , remember , has plenty of pleasures . It is full of things worth living for . ’
18281	18285	18287	18287	Leslie	114	‘ Is it ? ’
18309	18429	18293	18293	he	114	‘ Is there anything in life that you really think is , for its own sake , worth living for ? To me it seems that we are haunted with the power of imagining that there might be , and are pursued with the knowledge that there never is . Look at that lovely water before us , with its floods of moonlight — how it ripples , how it sparkles away into the distance ! What happiness sights like these suggest to one ! How happy they might make us — might , but they never do ! They only madden us with a vague pain , that I is like the sense of something lost for ever . ’
18430	18433	18435	18436	Miss Merton	93	‘ Still , ’
18438	18453	18435	18436	Miss Merton	93	‘ life is not all moonlight . Surely friendship and affection are worth having ? ’
18454	18463	18465	18465	Leslie	114	‘ Let me beg you , Miss Merton , ’
18477	18622	18465	18465	Leslie	114	‘ not to think that I am always pining and bemoaning myself . Fortunately the deeper part of one ’s nature will often go to sleep , and then the surface can enjoy itself . We can even laugh with our lips at the very things that our hearts in silence are breaking for . But as for happiness , that is always like prophecy , it is only fulfilled in the future ; or else it is a miracle — it only exists in the past . The actual things we wish for we may very likely get , but they always come too late or too soon . When the boy is in love , he tries to feel like a man ; when the man is in love , he tries to feel like a boy ; and both in vain . ’
18623	18626	18628	18628	Laurence	83	‘ Ah , ’
18630	18641	18642	18642	he	83	‘ I think very differently from that . I know , ’
18650	18678	18642	18642	he	83	‘ that friendship and affection are things worth having ; and if only pain and anxiety would leave me , I could enjoy the taste of happiness . ’
18679	18683	18685	18685	Leslie	114	‘ Could you ? ’
18687	18717	18718	18718	he	83	‘ When I look at what we are and what the world is , I can fancy no more melancholy spectacle than a happy man ; though I admit , ’
18726	18742	18721	18721	he	83	‘ that there is none more amusing than a man who tries to be melancholy . ’
18743	18749	18751	18751	Laurence	83	‘ Leslie is oddly changed , ’
18753	18845	18751	18751	Laurence	83	‘ since I saw him last . I am distressed with life because I can not find out its worth . He is indignant at it , it seems , because he thinks he has found out its worthlessness . And yet — I envy him his temperament . He never lets any melancholy subdue him . He can always laugh it down in a moment ; and he will trample bravely on any of his sentiments if he is on the road to anything he is proud of aiming at . ’
18859	19069	18846	18846	Laurence	83	‘ I dare say you think me very morbid ; but perhaps you can hardly realise the intense restless misery that a man endures when he can find nothing to do which he really feels worth doing . Could I only find some one thing — one great cause to labour for — one great idea — I could devote my whole self to it , and be happy : for labour , after all , is the only thing that never palls on a man . But such a cause , such an idea — I can find it nowhere . Politics have turned into a petty , weary game ; religion is dead . Our new prophets only offer us Humanity , in place of the God of which they have deprived us . And Humanity makes a very poor Deity , since it is every day disgracing itself , and is never of the same mind from one week ’s end to another . And so here I am utterly alone — friendless , and with nothing to help me ; feeling that , were it not for the petty contemptible interests I manufacture for myself from day to day , life would be quite unbearable . ’

19109	19161	19107	19107	Laurence	83	‘ and a certain amount of wealth , and I would not willingly lose anything of either of these ; but that is not because , in my heart , I value them ; but because , if I lost them , I might in my heart cease to despise them . ’
19162	19165	19167	19168	Miss Merton	93	‘ Surely , ’
19170	19266	19167	19168	Miss Merton	93	‘ there is a better way of looking at the matter . You came into the world with all your lower ambitions satisfied for you . The ground therefore is quite clear for the higher ambitions . That is why I think an aristocracy , as a rule , must always be the best governors of men , for their ambitions , as a rule , are the only genuine ones . Think , too , what an advantage mere wealth is . The highest labour will never produce money , but generally requires it . ’
19267	19274	19276	19276	Laurence	83	‘ That is just the difficulty , ’
19278	19328	19276	19276	Laurence	83	‘ What shall I labour for ? I am almost maddened sometimes , as I sit all the day idle , and seem to hear the hateful wasted moments slipping away from me . And I could do something , I am sure . I feel I have powers . ’

19338	19374	19375	19375	she	93	‘ that all I should say to you is , find something to do . The power to find or make an object is , I think , a great part of genius . However , ’

19828	19906	19907	19907	I	0	’ suggested Mrs. Sinclair naively . The word was a simple one : but it sufficed to work a miracle on Dr. Jenkinson . For the first time in his life to a lady who united the two charms of beauty and fashion , to both of which he was eminently susceptible , Dr. Jenkinson was rude . He turned abruptly away , and staring hard at the moon , not at Mrs. Sinclair , said simply , ‘

20107	20169	20105	20105	Leslie	114	‘ It may be so , of course ; and yet men at least often generalise very hastily and very wrongly , I am sure .

But still , if there be not a God for whose glory we can live , and who in his turn will not leave us all to ourselves , what then ? Think of all those who , in spite of hard surroundings , have just had strength enough to struggle to be good , but to struggle only — whose whole moral being has been left writhing in the road of life , like an animal that a cart - wheel has gone over , just lifting its eyes up with a piteous appeal at us who will not help it — ’

23591	23950	23566	23566	his	376	‘ The main difficulty that occupied the early Greek Philosophers , as soon as philosophy in its proper sense can be said to have begun , was the great dualism that seemed to run through all things . Matter and mind , the presence of imperfection , and the idea of perfection , or the unity and plurality of being , were amongst the various forms in which the two contradictory elements of things were presented to them , as demanding reconcilement or explanation . This manner of viewing things comes to a head , so to speak , amongst the ancients , in the system of Plato . With him the sensible and the intelligible worlds stand separated by a great gulf , the one containing all good , the other of itself only evil , until we recognise its relation to the good , and see that it is only a shadow and a type of it . The world of real existence is something outside , and virtually unconnected with , this world of mere phenomena ; and the Platonic prayer is that we should be taken out of the world , rather than , as Christ says , with a fuller wisdom , that we should be delivered from the evil . Plato had , however , by thus dwelling on this antagonism in things , paved the way for a reconciliation — some say he even himself began it . At any rate , it was through him that it was nearly , if not quite , accomplished by his disciple Aristotle . Aristotle first systematised the great principle of evolution , and transformed what had appeared to former thinkers as the dualism of mind and matter into a single scale of ascending existences . Thus what Plato had conceived of as two worlds , were now presented as opposite poles of the same . The πρώτη ὕλη , the world “ without form and void , ” receiving form , at length culminated in the soul of man ; and in the soul of man sensation at length culminated in pure thought . ’

23972	24050	24051	24052	the Doctor	376	‘ that a sermon is not the place in which to discuss such differences of secular opinion ; or you will perhaps think that such differences are of no very great moment . But if you look under the surface , and at the inner meaning of them , you will find that they bear upon questions which are , or ought to be , of the very highest moment to each of us — questions indeed , ’
24071	24096	24051	24052	the Doctor	376	‘ which we all of us here have very lately — very lately indeed — either discussed ourselves , or heard discussed by others . ’
24126	24130	24131	24132	the Doctor	376	‘ The question , ’
24135	24665	24131	24132	the Doctor	376	‘ is one of the relations of the spiritual to the natural ; and the opposition between the views of these two ancient philosophers is by no means obsolete in our own century . There is even now far too prevalent a tendency to look upon the spiritual as something transcending and completely separate from the natural ; and there is in the minds of many well - meaning and earnest persons a sort of alarm felt at any attempt to bring the two into connection . This feeling is experienced not by Christians only , but by a large number of their opponents . There is , for instance , no doctrine more often selected for attack by those who oppose Christianity upon moral grounds , than that of which my text is an expression , I mean the doctrine of a morality enforced by rewards and punishments . Such morality , we hear it continually urged by men who set themselves up as advanced thinkers , is no morality at all . No action can be good , they tell us , that does not spring from the love of good . Virtue is no longer virtue if it springs from fear . The very essence of it is to spring from freedom . Now , these arguments , though specious at the first blush of the thing , are really , if we look them honestly in the face , to the utmost shallow and unphilosophical . They are really but so many denials of the great doctrine of evolution — so many attempts to set up again that absolute antagonism between good and evil which it has been the aim of all the higher thinkers , and of Christ himself , to do away with . If , then , these modern critics of Christianity come to us with such objections , let us not try to disguise the truth that the morality of our religion is based on fear . Let us rather boldly avow this , and try to point out to them that it is they , and not the Psalmist , that are out of harmony with modern thought . For what is it that the sacred Scripture says ? “ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom . ” The beginning , you will please to observe — the beginning only . It is not perfect wisdom , it is not perfect virtue ; but it is the beginning of both of these . It is , if I may be allowed the expression , the moral protoplasm — it is that out of which they are both evolved . It is , as Aristotle would call it , their potentiality . The actuality is different from the potentiality ; for “ perfect love ” as St. John says , “ casteth out fear . ” Putting together , then , the ideas of these two good men , St. John and Aristotle , we may say that the love of God — that is , true wisdom — is the actuality of the fear of Him . ‘
24689	24711	24131	24132	the Doctor	376	’ — the Doctor ’s voice here grew very soft , and seemed as though it would almost break with feeling — ’
24966	25303	25304	25304	I	0	‘ There is , I admit , in this truth something that may at first sight repel us , and perhaps even prompt some of us to deny indignantly that it is a truth at all . But this is really a cowardly and unworthy feeling , fatal to any true comprehension of God ’s dealings with man , and arising from a quite mistaken conception of our own dignity , and our own connection with God . It is some such mistaken conception as this that sets so many of us against the discoveries of modern science as to the origin of our own species , and , what is far worse , prompts us to oppose such discoveries with dishonest objections . How is it possible , some of us ask , that man with his sublime conceptions of duty and of God , and his fine apparatus of reason , and so forth , should be produced by any process of evolution from a beastly and irrational ape ? But to ask such questions as these is really to call in question the power of God , and so to do Him dishonour . It is true that we can not trace out , as yet , all the steps of this wonderful evolution ; but let us not be found , like doubting Thomas , resolved not to believe until we have actually seen . And yet , if our faith does indeed require strengthening , we have only to look a little more attentively at the commonest facts before us . For is it not , let me ask you — to take , for instance , a man ’s sublime faculty of reasoning and logical comprehension — far more wonderful that a reasoning man should have the same parents as a woman , than that they both should have the same parents as a monkey ? Science and religion both alike teach us that with God all things are possible . ‘
25510	25601	25612	25612	it	406	‘ And so now , since we have seen how science and Christianity are at one as to the rise of the moral sentiments , I will pass on to a wider point , the character and the history of Christianity itself , both of which have been misunderstood and misinterpreted for at least eighteen hundred years ; and when I have pointed out how this great subject is being now explained by the methods of modern science , I will pass on to an issue that is wider yet . ‘
26008	26231	25984	25984	he	650	‘ If we study Christianity reverently and carefully upon these principles , we shall see that it was not a thing that sprang up , as we used to fancy , without any human antecedents , but that its roots reach back with many ramifications into the western and oriental thought of preceding centuries . We shall see how it absorbed into itself all that was highest in Hebraistic Theism and in Hellenic thought — something too , let us admit , of the failings of both . I can not here enter into any of the details of this , what may be truly termed pre - Christian Christianity . I can only briefly point out its existence , and its double origin , commenting on these by the following few lines from a great German writer . “ The yearning after a higher revelation ” he tells us , “ was the universal characteristic of the last centuries of the ancient world . This was in the first place but a consciousness of the decline of the classical nations and their culture , and the presentiment of the approach of a new era ; and it called into life not only Christianity , but also , and before it , Pagan and Jewish Alexandrianism , and other related developments . ” ‘
26664	26686	26645	26646	this father	673	’ said the Doctor cheerfully , looking round him with a smile of benignant triumph , and blinking with his eyes , ‘
26775	26781	26782	26782	he	0	‘ Nor is this all , ’
26793	26914	26782	26782	he	0	‘ not only are all these things so confused and doubtful ; but we now see that , in the face of recent criticism , we can not even be quite sure about any of the details of the divine life of our Lord . But in all this’—the Doctor ’s voice here became still more aërial , and he fixed his eyes upon the painted ceiling of the theatre , as though he were gazing on some glorious vision—‘in all this there is nothing to discompose us . We can be quite sure that He lived , and that He went about doing good , and that in him we have , in the highest sense , everlasting life . ‘
27216	27690	27208	27209	no man	684	‘ If we be thus once “ stablished in the faith ” all human history , and the history of Christianity especially , will assume for us a new sacredness and a new significance . We shall recognise gladly its long struggles of growth , and its struggles for existence , and see how in all these were at work the great principles of evolution . We shall see how Christian perfection emerged gradually out of imperfection — nay , that it was only through imperfection that this perfection was possible . For although , as we now know , all the various theological systems that have sprung up about Christianity , and have been so long current , are not Christianity , are most of them , indeed , not even sense — yet it was through these that true Christianity made its way , and extended itself in a corrupt and ignorant world . For the world has been given from age to age just so much of the truth as it has been able to bear , and it is only , let us remember , from receiving it tempered in this wise proportion , that it has been able to receive it at all . But these times of the world ’s probation are now passing away . It is now at length ceasing to be under “ tutors and governors ; ” it is learning to “ put away childish things . ” It is coming to a sense that it is now fitted to receive Christ ’s truth pure , and without any admixture or wrappage of falsehood . And so , as it looks back over all the various opinions once so fiercely agitated about religion , it recognises in all of them a common element of good , and it sees that all theologians and all sects have really agreed with one another , and been meaning the same thing , even when they least suspected or wished it . Nor is it , as modern study is showing us , varieties of Christianity only that this deeper unity underlies , but all other religions also . It has been well observed by a great Roman Catholic writer now living , that whenever any great saintliness of life is to be observed amongst infidels and heretics , it is always found to be due to the presence of certain beliefs and rules which belong to the Catholics . And in like manner , we may say too , that whenever any great saintliness of life is to be observed amongst Catholics , it is due to the presence of certain beliefs and rules that belong to the infidels and the heretics — and indeed to all good men , no matter what their religion is . ‘
27985	27989	27991	27992	the Doctor	376	‘ And now , ’
28002	28179	27991	27992	the Doctor	376	‘ I shall pass on to that wider point to which I have already alluded , which is indeed that which I wish chiefly to impress upon you , and to which all that I have hitherto said has been preparatory . We have come to see how genuine Christianity has been enabled to grow and extend itself only through an admixture of what we now recognise as evil . And seeing this , we shall be led on to a conclusion that is much wider . It has been said that it is the part of the devil to see in good the germs of evil . Is it not also the part of the devil not to recognise in evil the germs of good ? May we not indeed say with St. Augustine , that absolute evil is impossible , because , if we look at it rightly , it is always rising up into good ? And so , may we not recognise in all things the presence and the providence of God ? ‘
28388	28592	28377	28377	God	115	‘ And so , if we consider the subject thus , we shall learn to put a stop to all those fretful wailings over the badness of our own times of which we hear so much — wailings over the unbelief of our neighbours , the corruption of society , the misery of the poor , the luxury of the rich , or the decline of commercial morality . The present is an age of change , and is therefore at every turn presenting to us some new feature . But if these come to us in the apparent guise of evils , let us not uselessly bemoan them ; but let us believe that they are , even if we can not see that it is so , but the beginnings , the embryos of new good . Indeed , by the eye of faith , even in the present day , may be discerned the beautiful spectacle of good actually shining through evil . May we not , for instance , discern the well - being of the rich through the misery of the poor ? and again , the honest industry of the poor through the idleness of the rich ? ‘
29157	29397	29145	29146	the Apostle	706	‘ Let us therefore , with a large hope for the future , and a cheerful contentment with the present , be willing to leave the world in the hands of God , knowing that He has given us what conditions and what circumstances are best for us . Let us see all things in God , and let us become in Him , as Plato says , “ spectators of all time , and of all existence . ” And thus , in spite of the difficulties presented to us by “ all the evil that is done under the sun ” we shall perceive that all things will , nay must , come right in God ’s own time ; and the apparent dualism of good and evil at last become a glorious unity of good . But let us remember also that “ the Kingdom of God cometh not with observation ; ” and I would conclude my sermon with certain memorable words spoken by Christ Himself , though unfortunately not to be found in the Gospels , but preserved to us by Clement of Alexandria . “ The Lord , ” Clement tells us , “ being asked when His kingdom should come , said , When two shall be one , and that which is without as that which is within , and the male with the female — neither male nor female . ” ‘
29402	29422	29423	29424	the Doctor	376	’ ( at the sound of this word the whole congregation rose automatically to their feet),‘I will ask you , ’
29431	29468	29423	29424	the Doctor	376	‘ to conclude this morning ’s service by doing what I trust I have shown that all here may sincerely and honestly do . I mean , I will ask you to recite after me the Apostles ’
29471	29626	29423	29424	the Doctor	376	’ This appeal took the whole congregation quite aback . But there was no time for wonder . Dr. Jenkinson at once began ; nor was his voice the only sound in the theatre . Lady Ambrose , pleased , after all that she had heard the night previous , to make public profession of her faith , especially in a place where it could not be called in question , followed the Doctor audibly and promptly ; Miss Prattle followed Lady Ambrose ; Lady Violet Gresham , who was busy with one of her sleeve - links , followed Miss Prattle ; Lady Grace , from quite another part of the house , followed Dr. Jenkinson on her own account ; Mr. Stockton repeated the first clause in a loud voice , and then relapsed into marked silence ; Mr. Luke only opened his lips to sigh out audibly in the middle a disconsolate ‘
29630	29669	29423	29424	the Doctor	376	’ Mr. Storks blew his nose with singular vigour through the whole proceeding ; Mrs. Sinclair , just towards the end , tapped Leslie ’s arm gently with her fan , and said to him in a whisper , ‘
29677	29691	29671	29671	you	709	’ When all was over , when the Doctor had solemnly pronounced the last ‘
29694	29962	29671	29671	you	709	’ he looked about him nervously for a moment , as if the question of how to retire becomingly suddenly dawned upon him . Luckily he perceived almost directly a servant standing in readiness by the curtain . The Doctor frowned slightly at the man ; made a slightly impatient gesture at him ; and Faust and the young witch again covered the preacher from the eyes of his congregation . The blinds were half - down at luncheon in the dining - room , to keep out the brilliant summer sun . The guests dropped in by ones and twos , somewhat tired and exhausted by the divine service of the morning ; and the sight of the table was not a little refreshing to them , as it shone whitely in the soft gloom , with its flowers and ferns , and its day - lit glimmer of glass and silver . Soon , however , a piece of news was circulated that was even more refreshing than the luncheon . Dr. Jenkinson , owing to his late exertions , and the gas - light , and the draughts upon the stage , was suffering from a headache , which inclined him to keep his room ; and accordingly an unhopedfor prospect of freely discussing the sermon dawned brightly upon the whole party . Mr. Stockton , who had been much struck with the strictly prosaic style of Dr. Jenkinson ’s discourse , and who had been secretly contrasting this with the more impassioned character of his own mind , was the first to begin . ‘
29969	29978	29980	29980	I	0	’ he said , turning to Lady Ambrose , ‘
29981	29992	30011	30011	his	103	’m afraid our friend ’s forte is certainly not poetry . ’
29993	29996	29998	29999	Donald Gordon	103	‘ Surely , ’
30014	30048	29998	29999	Donald Gordon	103	‘ his forte is something far better . Poetry can only make us happy for a little while . Such doctrines as we have heard this morning ought to make us happy always . ’
30238	30246	30247	30247	he	112	‘ I have heard to - day , ’
30259	30340	30247	30247	he	112	‘ an entirely new and in every way memorable doctrine , which I never heard before from the mouth of man , woman , or child ; nor can I tell by what steps any human being could have arrived at it . I have heard that the world — the world as it is — could not be better than it is ; that there is no real sorrow in it — no real evil — no real sin . ’
30341	30346	30348	30349	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Poor Dr. Jenkinson ! ’
30357	30365	30348	30349	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ I suppose he has never loved . ’
30366	30369	30371	30372	Mr. Stockton,—his	715	‘ Ah , ’
30409	30410	30247	30247	he	112	’ ‘
30414	30418	30247	30247	he	112	’ said Leslie , ‘
30446	30509	30632	30632	he	113	’ Lady Ambrose , who had not liked Leslie so much on further acquaintance as she had at first expected she should , was very indignant at him for so flippant a speech as this — she felt sure it was flippant , though she did not quite understand its meaning — but once again Mr. Herbert ’s grave accents arrested her . ‘
30514	30582	30632	30632	he	113	’ he was saying to Mrs. Sinclair , evidently alluding to the same subject—‘it is simply our modern atheism trying to hide its own nakedness , for the benefit of the more prudish part of the public , in the cast grave - clothes of a Christ who , whether he be risen or no , is very certainly , as the angel said , not here . ’
30583	30597	30599	30600	Mr. Rose	100	‘ All discussion of such matters seems to me but a diseased activity , ’
30625	30631	30632	30632	he	113	‘ In his main points , ’
30647	30678	30632	30632	he	113	‘ and putting aside his quasi - religious manner of expressing it — which considering his position may be pardoned — I conceive Dr. Jenkinson to have been entirely right . ’
30740	30745	30746	30746	he	113	‘ You look tired , ’
30751	30754	30756	30757	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ No , ’
30760	30791	30756	30757	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ at least , perhaps I am a little . Do you know , I always think one feels rather dull if one does n’t get the letters one expects . ’
30792	30799	30801	30801	Laurence	83	‘ Perhaps you do n’t know , ’
30803	30843	30801	30801	Laurence	83	‘ that the letters you got this morning were only those of last night ’s post . Our Sunday letters we are obliged to send for , and they do n’t generally come till later on in the day . ’
30844	30847	30849	30850	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Really ! ’
30872	30881	30882	30882	she	92	‘ The Duchess could n’t have forgotten it , ’
30935	30943	30944	30944	she	92	‘ Do you know , Mr. Laurence , ’
30947	31004	30944	30944	she	92	‘ I have been thinking over and over again about many of the things that were said last night ; and I really am afraid that the world is getting very bad . It is very sad to think so ; but , with all this infidelity and wickedness of which we hear so much , I ’m
31056	31129	31131	31132	Lady Ambrose	92	’ Lady Ambrose added — her ideas did not always follow one another in the strictest order—‘hardly a week passes without some new scandal . I had a letter only this morning , telling me all the particulars about Colonel Eardly and poor Lady Arthur . And that man , you know — just fancy it!—it will not be very long before we shall be obliged to receive him again . However , ’
31141	31170	31131	31132	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ that sort of thing , I believe , is confined to us . The middle classes are all right — at least , one always hears so . ’
31181	31185	31186	31187	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ But now , ’
31212	31218	31196	31196	her	92	‘ how different he is ! ’
31265	31271	31272	31272	Allen	101	‘ Do n’t you think , ’
31288	31371	31278	31278	himself	101	‘ that though at the present moment things as they are may be worse than they have ever been before , there are yet ideas amongst us of things as they might be , that are in advance of what has ever been before ? I know quite well how society is falling to pieces , and how all our notions of duty are becoming confused or lost . I know too how utterly without any religion we are’—(Lady Ambrose started ) — ‘

31445	31450	31488	31488	you	727	’ said Mr. Luke , ‘
31543	31557	31569	31572	such men as these	731	’ said Mr. Luke , sighing slowly , and looking round the table , ‘

31618	31623	31679	31679	you	727	’ sighed Mrs. Sinclair . ‘
31628	31634	31679	31679	you	727	’ said Mr. Luke wearily ; ‘
31656	31677	31679	31679	you	727	’ Mr. Storks was here heard clearing his throat . With an ominous pugilistic smile he turned towards Mr. Luke . ‘
31683	31687	31679	31679	you	727	’ he said , ‘
31825	31834	31871	31871	her	121	’ said Mr. Storks , shrugging his shoulders , ‘
31990	31991	31992	31992	I	0	’ ‘
31997	32029	31992	31992	I	0	’ said Mr. Luke , looking up to the ceiling . Scarcely were the words out of his mouth than Mr. Saunders exclaimed , in his most excited and shrillest voice , ‘
32039	32114	32115	32115	I	0	’ Mr. Luke was thunderstruck . Even Mr. Storks was taken aback by the audacity of the contradiction ; and as for the rest of the company , they could not conceive where on earth Mr. Saunders had left his manners . Mr. Storks , however , was still more astonished , and still less pleased , when he discovered , as Mr. Saunders proceeded , what was the real meaning of his speech . ‘
32119	32125	32115	32115	I	0	’ Mr. Saunders went on , ‘
32342	32392	32394	32394	I	0	’ Mr. Storks turned sharply round , and , with an awful look in his eyes of contemptuous indignation , stared Mr. Saunders into silence . He held him fixed in this way for a few moments , and then said to him in a voice of grim unconcern , ‘
32401	32409	32394	32394	I	0	’ Then again turning to Mr. Luke , ‘
32413	32417	32394	32394	I	0	’ he proceeded , ‘

34231	34267	34217	34218	Miss Merton	93	‘ Nobody could be in bad spirits in a place like this . There is something so fresh and living everywhere , and even when we lose sight of the sea we still hear it . ’

34275	34301	34217	34218	Miss Merton	93	‘ I believe these gardens are like Keats ’s island . There is no recess in them Not haunted by the murmurous sound of waves . ’

Omnis moriar , nullaque pars mei “ I shall wholly die , and there is no part of me that will escape the Venus of death . ” That , and that alone , he chose to have written over him . ’

35328	35618	35326	35326	Laurence	83	‘ is much older than the other . It was planted twenty years ago ; and twenty years ago the original of that statue was laid beneath it . She was one of those many nameless ladies — for , as you know , he completely exiled himself from society all the latter part of his life — who from time to time shared his fortunes at the house here . She was , too , by far the loveliest . She was at the same time the hardest , the most selfish , the most mercenary as well . And he knew it too . In spite of the distraction he found in her companionship , he was never for a moment deceived about her . At last , having made a fortune out of him , she was thinking of leaving him . But one day , suddenly , she caught a chill and died . She died here , and here she was buried . That statue , as you may imagine , is his design not hers . The attitude , the drapery , the wine - cup held in one hand , and the money in the other , are according to his express direction ; and by his direction , too , that face , with its lovely features , leers and sneers at him for ever , as he rests in his neglected grave . See , too , there is the epitaph which he chose for her : — Lusisti satis , edisti satis , atque bibisti ; “ You have wantoned enough with me — you have eaten enough of my substance — you have drunk enough of my champagne ; ’

35703	35718	35326	35326	Laurence	83	’ Miss Merton looked ; and the lines were not new to her : — ‘

Laurence unlocked the door , and he and Miss Merton entered . Inside there was a faint musty smell , and a general sense that the place had been long disused . The walls were completely lined with books in splendid bindings , whose gilded backs glimmered temptingly through the network of the bookcase doors . In the centre stood a table , covered with a cloth of faded crimson velvet ; nothing on it but a tarnished ormolu inkstand , in the shape of a Roman temple , across the columns of which spiders had woven dusty webs . Placed stiffly before the table stood a gilded arm - chair , with cushions of crimson damask , and under it a foot - stool to match , which had been worn quite bare by the old philosopher ’s feet . ‘

37468	37536	37458	37458	she	92	‘ do come and put a stop to this . You see what a woman ’s parliament would be if we ever have one , which my husband says is not at all impossible . Here is one of us who thinks that everything will go well if women can only learn to paint flowers on white dessert plates , and get fifteen shillings apiece for them . ’

37551	37564	37543	37544	Lady Grace	89	‘ was just saying that they all ought to be taught logic . ’

37672	37695	37669	37670	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ how are we to build a castle in the air together , if we are all at cross purposes like this ? ’
37724	37727	37729	37730	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ See , ’
37732	37787	37729	37730	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ I told you a little while ago you would be wanted to talk cleverly . And now , Mr. Leslie , do n’t you think you would be more comfortable if you sat a little farther off ? or Lady Grace , of whom I am already afraid , will begin to think we ’re

Indeed , as it was , she could hardly imagine that Mr. Luke was serious , and that he was not laughing at her ; so she said quickly and in a tone of self - defence , ‘

38510	38525	38528	38529	Lady Ambrose	92	’ exclaimed Mr. Luke , interrupting her with a grand wave of the hand ; ‘

38838	38894	38834	38834	Aristotle	154	’ Lady Ambrose started . Hearing two words , the one as long as Aristotle , and the other as unfamiliar as Ethics , she began to think that she had made the conversation serious with a vengeance . Indeed , the whole party , as well as herself , showed some signs of surprise . ‘
38900	38904	38834	38834	Aristotle	154	’ said Laurence , ‘
38943	38967	38969	38973	a very rich vulgar family	900	’ ( and this bewildered Lady Ambrose still more , though at the same time it gave her some gleam of hope ) , ‘
39022	39099	39144	39144	he	154	‘ Ethics being the art and science of human action , as directed towards the chief good of life — that highest and final end , to which , if we think a little , we shall see all other ends are subordinate ; it is evident that our first task must be , as our master Aristotle well says , to form a clear conception of what this end , the chief good , is . ‘
39459	39512	39519	39519	our	906	‘ We shall discover this , in the same way as we did that of the French and Germans , in an examination of our own special national characteristic . First , however , we must be clear what this characteristic is ; and here it will be well to take our neighbours ’
39625	40130	40139	40140	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ This we affirm to be social distinction , to their admiration and pursuit of which is due that cardinal moral quality which they call worldliness in themselves , and snobbishness in their friends and enemies . And if any object that to a great part of the nation social distinction in its true sense is a thing unknown , and that to another part it is a thing that comes without being struggled for , and so in neither case can be the end of moral action , we shall answer them that to object this , is much the same as to argue that a peach - tree does not bear peaches because none are to be seen growing out of the roots ; or that there is no meaning in the Athanasian Creed because none is attached to it by the only people who use it ; or that there is no meaning in the dogma of the Pope 's infallibility because its only possible meaning is repudiated by all those who defend it . For nothing will be found unless we seek it in its right place . And for the ethics of a nation we must look only in that part of the nation which is their proper sphere ; and that part is , as we have already shown , the vulgar part . And should any still imagine that if we thus limit the scope of our observation , we shall not be able to treat the subject exhaustively , we shall remind him that the vulgar classes , though not yet co - extensive with the nation , are still rapidly becoming so , vulgarity ascending and descending with equal certainty ; since on the one hand it ruins all society into which it contrives to enter ; whilst it thrives itself , on the other hand , on all society that contrives to enter into it . To it therefore our whole study may be confined . Nor lastly ( for it is well to anticipate every possible objection ) , is there any need that even thus we should study those classes that naturally possess social distinction , that we may so learn in what its real essence consists ; since , if we do but observe facts , we shall see that ignorance of the whole inner nature of good society is the chief characteristic of those who with most single - heartedness direct their lives towards getting into it . It will be enough then , without any further explanation , to lay it down that social distinction is the chief good , and the end of all moral action ; nor can the Aristotelians say that this is in reality a mediate end , and sought for only because it leads to happiness ; since so far are men from seeking social distinction for the sake of happiness , that they are perpetually renouncing happiness for the sake of social distinction . ’
40131	40137	40139	40140	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Capital , Mr. Laurence ! ’
40156	40178	40139	40140	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ And how true that is about those people who really ruin the society into which they contrive to push themselves ! ’
40198	40203	40205	40205	Laurence	83	‘ So you see , ’
40207	40223	40205	40205	Laurence	83	‘ that you were quite right , Lady Ambrose , by instinctively beginning with exclusion . ’
40224	40227	40229	40229	Allen	101	‘ Still , ’

40313	40700	40309	40309	he	0	‘ of all moral action , virtue or morality is that state of mind which desires this end ; and virtuous or moral acts are those which help us on towards it , provided only that they are done with purpose . For acts done not with purpose , but by chance , are not to be held moral . Now the nature of purpose is well explained by Aristotle , when he says that its object is all such voluntary action as is the result of deliberation . And what then is the object of deliberation ? Let us consider that : for men , it is evident , do not deliberate about all matters alike ; since in addition to their continually not deliberating in cases when they ought , there are many matters about which deliberation is out of the question . Thus no one deliberates about what is in its nature immutable , as how to alter vulgarity of a people ’s member of Parliament ; nor about necessary things , as how to alleviate the misery of the starving poor ; nor about things of chance , as how to prevent the dissemination of cholera ; nor , again , about remote things which do not concern us , as , to use a former instance , how to alleviate the misery of the starving poor ; nor does anyone deliberate about impossible things , as how to check the poisonous adulteration of food ; nor about things that are past and lost , as how to do anything for the glory of England ; nor , lastly , do we deliberate about things we do not care about , as how to get that lost glory back again . Deliberation , then , only takes place about such matters as our own agency can effect , and which we wish it should effect . Virtue , therefore , being thus based on deliberation , is manifestly not one of those things that come to us by nature whether we will or no ; but it is acquired by habit . The genus of moral virtue is a habit . But what special sort of habit ? and how does it differ from all other habits ? Let us consider this . ‘

Every influence of the summer afternoon conspired to make all take kindly to the topic — the living airy whisper of the leaves overhead , the wandering scents of the flowers that the breeze just made perceptible , the musical splash of the fountain in its quiet restlessness , the luxury of the mossy turf as soft as sleep or rose - leaves , and a far faint murmur of church - bells that now and then invaded the ear gently , like a vague appealing dream . Mr. Saunders even was caressed by his flattered senses into peacefulness ; the high and dry light of the intellect ceased to scintillate in his eyes ; the spirit of progress condescended to take a temporary doze . ‘

45575	45599	45600	45601	Lady Ambrose	92	’m glad I ’ve forgotten even the names of the twelve Cæsars , and the date of the kings of England . Besides , ’
45604	45635	45600	45601	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ it makes one think what a serious thing it is to lose a battle , if people are to be made so cross about it six hundred years afterwards . ’
45636	45643	45645	45645	Laurence	83	‘ I quite agree with you , ’
45647	45696	45645	45645	Laurence	83	‘ that if that ’s the sort of culture one gets from history , we had better never open a history book again . But history , Lady Ambrose , has very little to do with the Battle of Bouvines , and nothing with the character of Harold . ’
45697	45707	45709	45710	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Then what has it got to do with ? ’
45713	45735	45709	45710	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ It certainly has to do with kings , and wars , and facts , and dates , has n’t it ? ’
45736	45742	45744	45744	Laurence	83	‘ What people call facts , ’
45746	45844	45744	45744	Laurence	83	‘ are only the dry bones of history . It is quite true that most professed historians have hitherto , instead of painting the face of the past , simply made discrepant notes about the shape of its skull : everything that could give the shape of the skull the least significance they left unthought of , or dismissed it in an occasional chapter . But really the least important of all the world ’s events are those that you can localise exactly , and put an exact date to ; those which alone most historians see . ’
45845	45848	45850	45851	Miss Merton	93	‘ But , ’
45853	45877	45850	45851	Miss Merton	93	‘ do n’t you call such things as the events in Caesar ’s life , for instance , or Hildebrand ’s , history ? ’
45878	45885	45887	45887	Laurence	83	‘ Looked on simply as events , ’
45889	46023	45887	45887	Laurence	83	‘ I call them biography , or I call them illustrations of history ; but I do not call them history . History , in its true sense , is a travelling in the past ; the best of histories would be but the carriage or the steamboat you travelled by ; your histories of dates and battles are at best but the Bradshaws and the railway - maps . Our past must be an extension of the present , or it is no real past . Now I expect , Lady Ambrose , that , in its true sense , you know a good deal more history than you are aware of . I saw you reading Saint - Simon yesterday evening , and you alluded to Grammont ’s Memoirs at dinner . ’
46024	46030	46032	46033	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Oh , of course , ’
46035	46063	46032	46033	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ books like that ! But , then , they really give you such a notion of the times , and quite take you back to them . ’
46064	46072	46074	46074	Laurence	83	‘ Nothing is history that does not , ’
46076	46079	46081	46082	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Really , ’
46086	46129	46081	46082	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ “ II y a plus de vingt ans que je dis de la prose , sans que j’en susse rien . ” And so it seems that I have known history without suspecting it , just as M. Jourdain talked prose . ’
46130	46134	46136	46137	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Pardon me , ’
46139	46223	46136	46137	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ if I interrupt you for a moment ; but , Mr. Laurence , though I admit that there is a great deal of truth in what you say , you have not even alluded to the great function of history , nor have you even hinted at the great use of facts . However , perhaps I had better reserve what I have to say on this , as well as on certain other matters , till by - and - by . ’
46224	46228	46230	46230	Laurence	83	‘ Very well , ’
46232	46468	46230	46230	Laurence	83	‘ if history , then , is a travelling in the past — what else it is , as Mr. Saunders says , we can talk of afterwards — don’t you see what it does for us , Lady Ambrose , in the way of culture — does for us , not as students , but as men and women of the world ? Just think for a moment what our own age would seem to us if all the past , beyond the memories of our grandfathers , was a blank to us ; and then think how infinitely our minds are enlarged , how a freer air , as it were , seems to blow through them , even from that vague knowledge of the past afloat in the world , which we pick up here and there as we go along . Even that has an effect upon us . It prevents us being , as we else should be , merely temporal people who are just as narrow - minded and dull as those merely local people — the natives of a neighbourhood — who wear gorgeous ribands at flower - shows in the country . Do n’t you remember last year , when I was staying with you , how you pointed some of them out to me , and how amused you were at their ways and their finery ? ’
46475	46488	46489	46489	she	92	‘ Go on , Mr. Laurence — I can understand all this , ’
46492	46502	46489	46489	she	92	‘ But I want to hear a little more . ’
46503	46506	46508	46508	Laurence	83	‘ Well , ’
46510	46656	46508	46508	Laurence	83	‘ your own knowledge of the history of France and England during the last two hundred years — you know well enough how that has made you , in a certain sense , more a woman of the world . What would you be , for instance , if you never knew that there had been a French Revolution , or an English Revolution — a Cromwell , or a Louis Quatorze , or a Mirabeau ? But your knowledge of history does not end here . You know something , at any rate , of the feudal times . You know what a castle was like , what a knight was like , what a monk was like . You know something , too , Of Roman and Greek history ; and , come — to go no farther — you know the Bible . ’
46657	46661	46663	46664	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I hope , ’
46673	46682	46663	46664	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ that one would not call that history . ’
46683	46687	46689	46690	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Certainly not , ’
46698	46703	46705	46705	Laurence	83	‘ At all events , ’
46711	46917	46705	46705	Laurence	83	‘ you know something of Rome , and Greece , and Palestine , and Egypt ; and each of these names is really a little aërial chariot which carries your imagination back as you pronounce it into some remote age , when life was different from what it is now . So is the mind widened by even a little vague history . Or , just repeat to yourself such words as France and Italy , and think for a moment of the effect of them . They are not mere names — mere geographical expressions ; but they are spells which evoke , whether you will or no , hosts of subtle associations , rising up like spirits out of the past centuries , and hovering in the air round you with their unbidden influence , and mixing with all your notions of Europe as it is now . Or , would you feel the matter more strongly yet , think , when you are travelling , what but for history would Venice be , or Athens , or Jerusalem ? If it were not for history , be it never so vaguely understood , would you find the same indescribable fascination in Rome ? ’
46918	46925	46927	46928	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I never was at Rome , ’
46930	46932	46927	46928	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ We ’re
46941	46973	46927	46928	Lady Ambrose	92	’ This piece of intelligence brought Laurence to a stop . Mr. Rose , however , whose imagination had been fired by all this talk about history , suddenly broke forth . ‘
46977	46981	46705	46705	Laurence	83	’ he exclaimed , ‘
47132	47137	47129	47129	we	1025	’ cried Mr. Rose , ‘
47276	47318	47253	47253	Harmodius	187	’ ὠκύμορος καὶ ὀϊζυρὸς περὶ πάντων , or , above all , those two by the agnus castus and the plane - tree where Ilyssus flowed,’—Mr . Rose ’s voice gradually subsided,—‘and where the Attic grasshoppers chirped in shrill summer choir . ’
47319	47327	47328	47328	Laurence	83	‘ At any rate , Lady Ambrose , ’
47332	47430	47328	47328	Laurence	83	‘ you now see something of the way in which history gives us culture ; and you see , too,—this is the chief point I want to impress upon you,—that in history , and many other things as well , books are only the telescopes through which we see distant facts ; and we no more become bookish by such a use of books than you became optical when you looked through your telescope in Gloucestershire , and saw Captain Audley , at the bottom of the park , proposing to your under - keeper ’s daughter . ’
47431	47437	47439	47440	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I really do believe , ’
47442	47455	47456	47456	she	92	‘ that that man is a little off his head . However , ’
47461	47525	47456	47456	she	92	‘ I give up about the bookishness , Mr. Laurence , and I dare say one really is the better for knowing something about history ; but still , I ca n’t help thinking that the chief thing to know about is , after all , the life about one , and that knowledge , just like charity , should begin at home . ’
47526	47529	47531	47531	Laurence	83	‘ There , ’
47533	47752	47754	47754	Laurence	83	‘ we quite agree ; and that , if I managed to express myself clearly , was the very thing that I set out with saying . It is with the life about us that all our concern lies ; and culture ’s double end is simply this — to make us appreciate that life , and to make that life worth appreciating . We only study the past to adorn our present , or to make our view of it clearer . And now , since we have at any rate suggested how this is done , let us put the past , and the distant too — everything , in fact , to which books are only the telescopes — out of our minds altogether , and merely consider the real heart of the matter — culture and the present . I tried to explain just now that we meant by a man of culture one on whom none of the finer flavours of life are lost — who can appreciate , sympathise with , criticise , all the scenes , situations , sayings , or actions around him — a sad or happy love - affair , a charm of manner and conversation , a beautiful sunset , or a social absurdity . I declare , ’
47756	47796	47754	47754	Laurence	83	‘ I could tell better whether a man was really cultivated , from the way in which he talked gossip , or told a story ; than from the way in which he discussed a poem or a picture . ’
47797	47800	47802	47802	Leslie	114	‘ Certainly , ’
47804	47966	47802	47802	Leslie	114	‘ I do n’t call a woman cultivated who bothers me at dinner first with discussing this book and then that — whose one perpetual question is , “ Have you read So - and - so ? ” But I call a woman cultivated who responds and who knows what I mean as we pass naturally from subject to subject — who by a flash or a softness in her eyes , by a slight gesture of the hand , by a sigh , by a flush in the cheek , makes me feel as I talk of some lovely scene that she too could love it — as I speak of love or sorrow , makes me feel that she herself has known them ; as I speak of ambition , or ennui or hope , or remorse , or loss of character , makes me feel that all these are not mere names to her , but things . ’
47967	47977	47979	47980	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Do you call me cultivated , Mr. Leslie ? ’
47987	47991	47993	47993	Leslie	114	‘ I mean , ’
47997	48025	47993	47993	Leslie	114	‘ I like to hear each key I touch make , not a dead thud as on a piece of wood , but strike a musical string . ’
48026	48029	48031	48032	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Good , ’
48034	48041	48042	48042	he	100	‘ that is good ! Yes , ’
48045	48182	48184	48185	Mr. Rose	100	‘ the aim of culture , if Mr. Leslie will lend me his nice metaphor , is indeed to make the soul a musical instrument , which may yield music either to itself or to others , at any appulse from without ; and the more elaborate a man ’s culture is , the richer and more composite can this music be . The minds of some men are like a simple pastoral reed . Only single melodies , and these unaccompanied , can be played upon them — glad or sad ; whilst the minds of others , who look at things from countless points of view , and realise , as Shakespeare did , their composite nature — their minds become , as Shakespeare ’s was , like a great orchestra . Or sometimes , ’

48295	48325	48345	48348	women of the world	2245	’ said Laurence , in a very matter - of - fact tone , for he saw that Mr. Rose ’s dreamy manner always tended to confuse Lady Ambrose , ‘
48894	49002	49021	49021	you	1047	’ Laurence had chosen these illustrations of his quite at random ; but he was fortunate in the last in a way which he never dreamt of . Lady Ambrose , in her early and unwise days , had actually had a love - affair . She had been engaged to a handsome young Guardsman , with only eleven hundred a year , and no prospects but debts ; and though she had successfully exchanged him for Sir George and his million of money , she still sometimes recalled him , and the wild September evening when she had seen her last of him upon Worthing pier . ‘
49005	49016	49021	49021	you	1047	’ she exclaimed , with some emotion in her voice , ‘
49133	49170	49118	49119	my brothers	1052	’ Lady Ambrose here grew conscious that she was showing more feeling than she thought at all becoming . She blushed , she stammered a little , and then , making a rush at another topic , ‘
49177	49181	49174	49175	Mr. Rose	100	’ she exclaimed , ‘
49193	49194	49195	49195	I	0	’ ‘
49200	49217	49195	49195	I	0	’ said Mr. Rose , who had been murmuring to himself at intervals for some time , ‘
49308	49313	49298	49298	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Rose , ‘
49345	49346	49298	49298	I	0	’ ‘
49349	49368	49298	49298	I	0	’ said Laurence , not having listened to Mr. Rose , who spoke , indeed , somewhat low , ‘
49371	49399	49298	49298	I	0	’ he said , continuing the same train of thought he had left off with , and looking first at Lady Ambrose and then at Miss Merton , ‘
49642	49647	49652	49653	the bard	1067	’ Laurence went on , ‘
49794	49799	49752	49752	he	1070	’ Laurence went on , ‘
49973	49974	49993	49993	you	1072	’ ‘
49977	49983	49993	49993	you	1072	’ said Mr. Rose earnestly , ‘
50395	50396	50398	50398	I	0	’ ‘
50400	50672	50398	50398	I	0	’ said Laurence , smiling,—‘do you see that far - away sail out — on the horizon line?—well , I caught myself murmuring over a scrap of Milton , only two minutes ago — As when afar at sea a fleet descried Hangs in the clouds , by equinoctial gales Why , I could go on capping verses with you the whole afternoon , if we had nothing else to do . But besides this , a knowledge of books as books has got another use . How it enriches conversation , by enabling us to talk by hints and allusions , and to convey so many more meanings than our actual words express . I came across an exquisite instance of this the other day , in a book of anecdotes about the poet Rogers , which shows how a familiarity with the scenes even of Greek poetry may give a brilliance to fashionable talk in the nineteenth century . One evening at Miss Lydia White’s — she was a Tory , and well known then in society — a guest who was a Whig , said à propos of the depressed state of his own party at the time , “ There is nothing left for us but to sacrifice a Tory virgin . ” “ Yes , ” said Miss Lydia White , “ I believe there ’s nothing the Whigs would n’t do to raise the wind . ” But yet , after all , this is not the important thing , and I hope Lady Ambrose will forgive us for having talked so long about it . ’
50673	50691	50693	50694	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ And so one must read a great deal , after all , to be really cultivated , ’
50701	50745	50693	50694	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ You ’ve made culture seem so nice , that I feel positively quite ashamed to think how seldom now I look at a line of poetry , except , of course , when anything new comes out , that everybody must read . ’
50746	50759	50761	50761	Leslie	114	‘ I do n’t think you need be afraid on that score , ’
50763	50830	50761	50761	Leslie	114	‘ If society is to be cultivated , it must , no doubt , read a good deal , as a body . But all its members need not . With women especially , nothing startles me more than when I find sometimes how very far , if they have had any serious experience of the world and life , a very little poetry will go . ’
50831	50835	50837	50838	Miss Merton	93	‘ I expect , ’
50840	51001	50837	50838	Miss Merton	93	‘ that we are naturally more introspective than men , and so , in what concerns ourselves , a very little will make us cultivated ; although we do n’t certainly get so easily as men that indifferent way of looking on life as a whole , which I suppose is what you call the dramatic spirit , and which people praise so in Shakespeare . But as to what Mr. Leslie says , I have so often myself noticed the same thing in girls — especially at times when they are passing into womanhood , without having made much of a success of youth . I remember one poor friend of mine , whose whole life seemed to become clear to her through just one line of Tennyson ’s — My life has crept so long on a broken wing . I suppose it was a sort of magic mirror to her as Mr. Laurence was saying just now . ’
51002	51005	51007	51007	Leslie	114	‘ I , ’
51009	51187	51007	51007	Leslie	114	‘ once knew some one at Baden , who spent half her time at the tables , as much the observed of all observers as Worth and her own strange beauty could make her — she liked being stared at — and who was certainly not a woman who gave much of her time to reading . She was very wretched with her husband , and her name was far from being above the reach of gossip . Talking one day to her in a hardish flippant sort of way — a tone of talk which she affected to like — I alluded by some chance to Francesca di Rimini in Dante ; and I shall never forget the tone in which she exclaimed , “ Poor Francesca!”—its passion and its pathos . I was surprised that she had even looked into Dante : but she had ; and that one passage had lit up her whole life for her — that one picture of the two lovers “ going for ever on the accursed air . ” ’
51188	51197	51199	51200	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ How nice of you , Mr. Leslie , ’
51202	51209	51199	51200	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ to remember my poor verses ! ’
51210	51217	51219	51219	Laurence	83	‘ Let us consider , too , ’
51221	51289	51219	51219	Laurence	83	‘ that poetry does not only enable us to appreciate what we have already experienced , but it puts us in the way of getting new experiences . This was Wordsworth ’s special claim for poetry , that it widened our sympathies — widened them in some new direction — that it was ever giving us , in fact , not new quotations , but new culture . ’
51290	51295	51297	51297	Leslie	114	‘ Ah , here , ’
51299	51565	51297	51297	Leslie	114	‘ is a thing that continually occurs to me . Just consider for moment the wonderful social effect of even so partial a thing as the culture that Wordsworth himself gave us . Consider the effect of it on a common worldly woman — let her be girl or matron — who without it would be nothing but a half mechanical creature , living , as far as her interests went , a wretched hand - to - mouth existence of thin distraction , or eager anxious scheming for herself or her daughters . Cultivate her , I say , just in this one direction — give her but this one fragment of culture , a love of Nature — and all the mean landscape of her mind will be lit up with a sudden beauty , as the beam of ideal sunshine breaks across it , with its “ light that never was on sea or land . ” I do n’t say that such a woman will become better for this , but she will become more interesting . In a girl , however pretty , what is there to interest a man if he reads nothing in her face from night to night but that she is getting daily more worn and jaded in the search for a rich husband ? Or even , to go a step higher , in the unthinking , uncultivated flirt , so common in every class of society — what is there in her that a man will not soon discover to be insipid and wearying ? ’
51566	51569	51571	51572	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Surely , ’
51575	51593	51571	51572	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ that rather depends on what she is like . I must stand up for my sex . ’
51594	51599	51600	51600	Leslie	114	‘ But give her , ’
51604	52049	51600	51600	Leslie	114	‘ one genuine , one disinterested taste , and all is changed . If I had an audience about me of young ladies , whom it was not too late to advise — girls entering on the world , determined to run the worldly course , and to satisfy all the expectations of the most excellent and lowest - minded of chaperons , I would say this to them:—I have no doubt you are all ignorant ; of course you are all vain . That to make a brilliant match is your great object , you all avow . A certain sort of flirting , of which the less said the better , is your most disinterested taste . I know all this ( I should say ) , and I ca n’t help it ; nor do I ask you to alter one of these points for the better . But this I do ask you to do . Try to add something else to them . Try to win for yourselves one taste of a truer and deeper sort . Study Wordsworth , and some parts of Shelley ; open out your sympathies , by their aid , in just one direction . Learn to love the sea , and the woods , and the wild flowers , with all their infinite changes of scent , and colour , and sound — the purple moor , the brown mountain stream , the rolling mists , the wild smell of the heather . Let these things grow to “ haunt you like a passion , ” learn in this way the art of desiring You ’ll perhaps find it a little dull at first ; but go on , and do n’t be disheartened ; and then — by - and - by — by - and - by , go and look in the looking - glass , and study your own face . Has n’t some new look , child , come into your eyes , and given them an expression — a something that they wanted before ? Smile . Has n’t your smile some strange meaning in it that it never used to have ? You are a little more melancholy , perhaps . But no matter . The melancholy is worth its cost . You are now a mystery . Men ca n’t see through you at a glance as they did ; and so , as Sterne says , “ you have their curiosity on your side , ” and that alone — even that will have increased your value tenfold in our Babylonian marriage - market . ’
52050	52056	52058	52059	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Well , Mr. Leslie , ’
52064	52095	52058	52059	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ if that ’s the way you ’d talk to young ladies , I should be very careful you never spoke to any that I had anything to do with . ’
52096	52103	52104	52104	Leslie	114	‘ Many people , I know , ’
52113	52168	52104	52104	Leslie	114	‘ think that books and culture are a kind of substitute for life , and that the real masters in the art of living have no need for this poor pis - aller . They only drive four - in - hand , or shoot , or dance , or run away with their friends ’
52251	52309	52233	52233	They	1080	’ Lady Ambrose much disapproved of the tone of this speech ; but none the less , in a certain mysterious way , did it insidiously increase her appreciation of the value of culture ; and she felt that with Laurence at any rate she most thoroughly agreed , when he said by way of summing up , ‘
52585	52612	52613	52613	I	0	’ The measure of Lady Ambrose ’s assent was now almost complete . It remained , however , for Mrs. Sinclair to give the finishing touch . ‘
52616	52623	52613	52613	I	0	’ she said softly and regretfully , ‘
52836	52837	52813	52813	she	1101	’ ‘
52841	52848	52813	52813	she	1101	’ said Miss Merton , laughing , ‘
52896	52897	52880	52886	the young ladies in our new Republic	1103	’ ‘
52900	52904	52880	52886	the young ladies in our new Republic	1103	’ said Laurence , ‘
52955	52963	52965	52965	I	0	’ There was a moment ’s pause . ‘
52972	52978	52965	52965	I	0	’ Allen broke in abruptly , ‘
53043	53053	53066	53066	you	1109	’ he said , half sadly and half coldly , ‘
53062	53063	53066	53066	you	1109	’ ‘
53070	53079	53066	53066	you	1109	’ said Laurence , with a slight sigh , ‘
53087	53102	53105	53105	Laurence	83	’ Mr. Luke here saw an opening for which he had long been waiting . ‘
53107	53112	53105	53105	Laurence	83	’ Mr. Luke began , ‘
53181	53198	53167	53167	he	101	’ said Mr. Luke , clearing his throat , and looking round at the general company , ‘
53394	53402	53507	53508	Miss Merton	93	’ he said confidentially to Lady Grace , ‘
53427	53499	53507	53508	Miss Merton	93	’ mothers who look on a bishop ’s palace as a focus of the most polite society . So I think , if you only all recognise this , that culture includes — in fact , essentially is — the discernment of true righteousness , of true morality , you need none of you fear that to a really cultivated society life will be in any danger of becoming a mockery . ’
53500	53505	53507	53508	Miss Merton	93	‘ I was sorry , ’
53516	53534	53507	53508	Miss Merton	93	‘ to hear you say that just now , because I know you do n’t mean it . ’
53560	53569	53570	53570	he	83	‘ You make me feel ashamed of myself , ’
53575	53582	53570	53570	he	83	‘ when you speak like this . ’
53630	53633	53634	53634	she	93	‘ Well , ’
53637	53655	53634	53634	she	93	‘ and do n’t you think that some definite faith or other is needed by the world ? ’
53656	53674	53676	53676	somebody	1017	‘ Yes , I think so ; I think so . I entirely agree with Miss Merton , ’
53702	53708	53709	53709	he	102	‘ Will you allow me , ’
53730	53770	53709	53709	he	102	‘ will you allow me to make a few observations here — it will only take a moment — to remind you of just a few things which I think ought not to be lost sight of ? Well , ’
53788	53967	53777	53777	he	102	‘ in the first place as to history , just one word . The main use of history , which Mr. Laurence forgot altogether to mention , is of course , as Comte has so well established , to teach us his philosophy of it — to show us , in other words , how entirely non compos mentis the world was till our time , and that it is only in the present century that it has acquired the power of passing a reasonable judgment . And next , as to facts ; mere facts , as facts , I think quite as useless as Mr. Laurence does , except for one reason . And that reason is the way in which from every side they confute , give the lie to , annihilate , the pretensions of revealed religion , and of the myths which it calls its history . This , however , by the way . It was not the chief thing that I wanted to say to you . Now , you all , ’
53982	54118	54119	54119	he	102	‘ propose to form a picture of what the world ought to be — what I suppose you hope it will be ; and you say , and very rightly , that the great secret is that it should appreciate properly the pleasures of human life . But , please mark this , you have quite ignored the most important thing of all — the vast change that all these pleasures are undergoing , that the whole aspect of life is undergoing , beneath the touch of modern thought and modern philosophy ; nay — and this indeed is the special point I want to lay stress upon — Mr. Luke just now even used those obsolete and misleading words , righteousness and morality , soiled by so many unworthy associations . By the way , ’
54129	54162	54119	54119	he	102	‘ I suppose I may speak the truth freely , as I know well enough that all to whom my vaticinations would be unwelcome are sure to mistake me for a Cassandra . ’
54163	54170	54172	54173	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Mistake him for a what ? ’
54180	54188	54190	54191	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ She was a beautiful young unfortunate , ’
54194	54203	54190	54191	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ who was betrayed by the god Apollo . ’
54223	54226	54227	54227	he	102	‘ Well , ’
54230	54286	54227	54227	he	102	‘ as Miss Merton remarked a moment ago , some definite faith is needed by the world ; and , as I now deliberately declare , some definite faith it will have — some one definite faith that will tolerate no dissent from it ; and it will have this before fifty years are over . ’
54315	54328	54295	54296	Mr. Luke	99	‘ I had imagined that our young friend ’s motto was freedom . ’
54350	54355	54356	54356	he	102	‘ Sight is free , ’
54384	54389	54390	54390	he	102	‘ sight is free , ’
54393	54485	54487	54488	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ and yet the sight of all healthy men , I conceive , is in agreement . It differs , I admit , when our eyes are dim with tears of hysterical feeling ; or when we are drunk ; or when we are fighting — in this last case , Mr. Luke , I am told we are often visited with illuminations of a truly celestial radiance — but it is surely not such exceptional vision as this that you praise as free . And it is just the same , ’
54491	54841	54843	54844	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ with the mind . The minds of men will never have been so free as on that not - distant day when they shall all agree . And what will that agreement result in ? Why , in the utter banishment , the utter destruction — I know no word strong enough to express my meaning — of all mystery and of all mysticism , and consequently of that supposed inscrutable difference between right and wrong , which has been made , in the hands of the priests , one of the most hideous engines of terror that were ever employed to degrade and crush mankind . Right and wrong , indeed ! Righteousness and morality ! There is something insidious in their very sound . No — “ useful , ” “ healthful , ” “ serviceable , ” “ pleasant”—these will be the words of the future . Emancipated man will know no wrong , save unhealthiness and unpleasantness . That most treacherous handmaid of priestcraft , poetry , which , professing to heighten the lights of life , did , in reality , only deepen its shadows , will delude him no longer — she will be gone — gone for ever . Science , the liberator of humanity , will have cast its light upon her ; and the lying vision will vanish . But why do I talk of poetry ? Is not that , and every other evil — reverence , faith , mysticism , humility , and all the unclean company — comprised in this one word , Religion ? Well , let religion — the ancien régime of the world — retire , as it has done , to its Versailles , and fence itself round for a little with its mercenary soldiers ! The Paris of the world is , at any rate , left free — and there the Revolution of Humanity is begun . Science leads it , and in another fifty years there will not be another religion left . Surely most here must know this , ’
54846	54866	54843	54844	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ although they may perhaps forget it sometimes . But the fact is notorious , and I really think — ’
54867	54870	54843	54844	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Sir ! ’
54894	54902	54889	54890	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ like a fountain ’s sickening pulse , ’
54956	54959	54960	54960	he	110	‘ Perhaps , ’
54968	55011	55012	55012	he	110	‘ I , as a man of science , who have been a patient apprentice at my work for six - and - twenty years , may be allowed to give some opinion on this matter . Destroy religion ! Destroy poetry ! ’
55033	55292	55012	55012	he	110	‘ Will science destroy either of these precious and exquisite heritages of the human race ? Will it extinguish one profound , one ennobling , one devout feeling ? Will it blight that rich culture on which the present age so justly prides itself ? I have followed science for six - and - twenty years , I speak therefore from experience ; and I boldly answer “ No . ” How indeed should it ? I know , I deplore , and I trust also forgive , the common notion that it does . But how can that notion have arisen ? That is what puzzles me . Is not science essentially religious , essentially poetical — nay , does it not deepen quite boundlessly the religion and poetry already existing in the world , and fuse the two together , as they were never fused before ? Does it narrow our notions of life ’s wonder and dignity to peer into the abyss of being , and learn something of the marvellous laws of things — to discover the same mysterious Something in a snow - flake , in the scent of a rose , in the “ topmost star of unascended heaven , ” and in some prayer or aspiration in the soul of man ? True it is that this wondrous All is Matter , and that all matter is atoms in its last analysis . No idle metaphysics have clouded my brain , so I have been able to see these things clearly — ’
55293	55300	55302	55303	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Yes , yes , yes , ’
55314	55401	55308	55308	his	102	‘ I know all that . I know that in their last analysis a pig and a martyr , a prayer and a beef - steak , are just the same — atoms and atomic movement . We , the younger generation of thinkers , accept all the premisses you give us without a moment ’s question . We only reason boldly and honestly on them , and I defy you to prove — Mr. Stockton , sir , if you will only listen to me — ’
55431	55435	55436	55436	he	110	‘ Consider ourselves , ’
55439	55462	55464	55465	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ consider the race of men , and note the truly celestial light that science throws on that . We have ascended , ’
55467	55633	55635	55636	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ noble thought ! We have not descended . We are rising towards heaven , we have not fallen from it . Yes — we , with attributes so like an angel ’s , with understanding so like a God’s — to this height we have already risen . Who knows what future may not be in store for us ? And then , on the other hand , when the awestruck eye gazes , guided by science , through the “ dark backward and abysm of time , ” and sees that all that is has unfolded itself , unmoved and unbidden , ( astounding thought ! ) from a brainless , senseless , lifeless gas — the cosmic vapour , as we call it — and that it may , for aught we know , one day return to it — I say , when we realise , when we truly make our own , this stupendous truth , must not our feelings , ’
55662	55663	55639	55639	his	110	’ ‘
55666	55671	55639	55639	his	110	’ said Miss Merton , ‘
55693	55694	55680	55680	I	0	’ ‘
55698	55708	55680	55680	I	0	’ chuckled Mr. Saunders , faintly clapping his hands . ‘
55728	55729	55722	55723	Miss Merton	93	’ ‘
55735	55740	55732	55733	Miss Merton	93	’ Mr. Stockton continued , ‘
55766	55780	55781	55782	Mr. Stockton	110	’ shrilled Mr. Saunders , unheeded)—‘that great Alpha and Omega of the Universe ? ’
55786	55917	55781	55782	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ And do n’t wrong me by thinking that I “ palter with you in a double sense , ” and that I am not using the word religion in its truest , its profoundest signification . Do you think , Miss Merton , for instance , that I can not feel with you , when , stirred to your inmost soul by some strain of Mozart or Beethoven , you kneel before your sacrificial altar , whilst the acolyte exalts the Host , and murmur with bowed head your litany to your beautiful Virgin ? I say advisedly , Miss Merton , that I , as a man of science , can appreciate , and to a great extent share , your adoring — your adorable frame of mind . ’
56054	56060	56061	56061	he	110	‘ Does science , then , ’
56064	56214	56061	56061	he	110	‘ rob us of one iota of religious feeling , or degrade our notions of life ’s measureless solemnity ? Nay , it is rather the flippant conceptions of theology that would do that , by connecting everything with an eternal Personality — a personality so degraded as to have some connection with ourselves . The prayer of the theologian , “ cabined , cribbed , confined ” in spoken words , is directed to a Being that Science can make no room for , and would not want , if she could . The prayer of the man of science , for the most part of the silent sort , is directed whither ? demands what ? He is silent if you ask him , for his answer would be beyond the reach of words . Even to hint at its nature he would feel were a profanity . ’
56215	56223	56225	56226	Miss Merton	93	‘ Do you know , Mr. Stockton , ’
56235	56242	56225	56226	Miss Merton	93	‘ all this rather bewilders me . ’
56243	56250	56252	56253	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ And so it does me , ’
56262	56328	56330	56331	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ and this august bewilderment , which gives fulness and tone to our existence , but which we can neither analyse nor comprehend — to me comes in one shape , to you in another , and is — religion . In the name , then , of all genuine science , and of all serious scientific men , let man keep , I say , ’
56337	56451	56330	56331	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ this precious and ennobling heritage — let him keep it and shape it ever anew , to meet his ever - changing and deepening needs . In my dream of the future I see religions not diminished , but multiplied , growing more and more richly diverse , as they sink deeper into individual souls . Surely , science , then , is not come to destroy the past , but to fulfil it — and I confess I can myself see no better way of discovering what we desire in the future than by the charming analysis Mr. Laurence has been giving us of what we most admire in the present . ’
56452	56455	56457	56458	Donald Gordon	103	‘ See , ’
56461	56480	56457	56458	Donald Gordon	103	‘ here is science on the one side offering us all religions , and on the other none . ’
56481	56484	56486	56487	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Heigho ! ’
56492	56506	56486	56487	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Let us agree about conduct first , and quarrel about theology afterwards . ’
56507	56510	56512	56513	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ Precisely , ’
56549	56551	56544	56544	Luke	99	’ ( ‘
56562	56568	56558	56558	you	110	’ thought Mr. Luke . ) ‘
56699	56827	56670	56670	I	0	’ This was literally taking the bread out of Mr. Luke ’s mouth . Not only was it repeating what he had said before , but it was anticipating , in a formless undisciplined way , the very thing that he was going to say again And the man who had robbed him thus was a mere Philistine — a mere man of science who was without even a smattering of Greek or Hebrew , and who thought sensori - motor nerves and spontaneous generation more important subjects than Marcion ’s Gospel or the Psalms of David . For once in his life Mr. Luke was for the moment completely silenced . Laurence however somewhat soothed him , by replying to him , not to Mr. Stockton , ‘
56855	56885	56900	56900	you	1130	’ Mr. Luke was going to have answered ; but , worse even than Mr. Stockton ’s , Mr. Saunders ’s hated accents now got the start of him . ‘
56890	56895	56900	56900	you	1130	’ Mr. Saunders exclaimed , ‘

57247	57258	57219	57219	he	216	’ — he said pausing to think of another example — ‘
57264	57270	57271	57271	I	0	’ enquired Mrs. Sinclair naïvely . ‘
57272	57289	57290	57290	she	1137	’m afraid I never give my husband his highest pleasure ; for I never let him , ’
57297	57313	57314	57314	she	1137	‘ open my letters , although I read all his . But , Mr. Saunders , ’
57317	57335	57314	57314	she	1137	‘ if you are so fond of curiosity , you must have some mystery to excite it . ’
57336	57339	57341	57342	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Yes , ’
57344	57366	57341	57342	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ but mystery is a fox for us to hunt and shoot ; not a God to hunt and shoot us . ’
57367	57370	57372	57373	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Fancy , ’
57377	57385	57372	57373	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ shooting a fox ! what sacrilege ! ’
57416	57419	57421	57421	Laurence	83	‘ Well , ’
57431	57493	57421	57421	Laurence	83	‘ may I read a certain letter of my uncle ’s to myself , which is printed in this very book I have here ? It was running in my mind just now , and is about the very matter we were speaking of — the connection of religions , of Christian morality , with all the higher pleasures of life . ’
57494	57498	57500	57501	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Very good , ’
57503	57625	57500	57501	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Read what you please . I can only say that I have at this moment in my portmanteau an analysis I have made of all the Christian moral sentiments , in which I trace every one of them to such disgusting or paltry origins as shall at once rob them of all their pestilent prestige . I begin with the main root , the great first parent of all these evils , the conception of God , which I show may have arisen in seventy - three different ways , each one more commonplace than the other . By - and - by , if you will not fear to confront the document , I will show it to you . ’

57720	57724	57631	57631	his	99	’ he added , ‘
57756	57789	57797	57797	Otho	77	’ Nor did Mr. Luke seem at all aware , as he was thus proceeding , that Laurence had found his place , and had already begun to read , as follows : ‘
57827	57892	58125	58125	you	1141	’ At this point , however , Laurence and Mr. Luke were both interrupted by an entirely unforeseen event . LAURENCE had just got to the end of the first sentence , and Mr. Luke at the same time was just reminding Mr. Stockton with some unction how impossible it was for us to value properly that curious mixture of trumpery and elevation , the ‘
57894	57909	58125	58125	you	1141	’ of John , unless we compared it with a very kindred work , the ‘
57911	58106	58125	58125	you	1141	’ of Hermas , when a servant startled Laurence by announcing in his ear the arrival of the vicar of the parish . Everyone in dismay looked ; and there , standing a pace away in the background , the stranger was . He was an old man , very tall and spare , with an ascetic aspect , but with a carriage dignified though slightly stooping , and with severe , piercing eyes . The sudden embarrassment , however , which his apparition seemed to cause the party was relieved somewhat by Laurence ’s taking him aside as if for some private conversation , and also by another arrival of a far more genial nature — that of servants with tea , piles of strawberries , iced coffee , and champagne cup . Mr. Rose at once bought himself golden opinions of Lady Grace by helping her page , a pretty boy with light curling hair , to arrange some tumblers on the grass . Mr. Stockton felt his spirits suddenly rise , and began asking Lady Violet what she thought of their new Republic as far as they had got with it . ‘
58112	58117	58125	58125	you	1141	’ she answered petulantly . ‘

58171	58187	58167	58168	Lady Violet	98	’ said Mr. Stockton to Lady Grace , as he stood by the tea table . ‘

58210	58215	58202	58202	he	1145	’ murmured Lady Ambrose . ‘
58220	58225	58202	58202	he	1145	’ enquired several voices . ‘
58231	58236	58228	58229	Dr. Seydon	219	’ said Lady Ambrose . ‘
58269	58329	58259	58259	he	1145	’ It was indeed but too true . Mr. Luke ’s face in especial grew very blank . Mr. Saunders clenched his fist — a small one . Dr. Seydon ’s face , on the contrary , wore what for it was a really gracious smile . He was mindful of how upon his arrival he had overheard the words ‘
58331	58333	58259	58259	he	1145	’ and ‘
58338	58364	58365	58365	I	0	’ As Laurence introduced him into the circle Lady Ambrose at once claimed acquaintance with him , and made room for him at her side . ‘
58369	58385	58365	58365	I	0	’ he said , looking round him with a singularly dignified , almost condescending courteousness , ‘
58412	58413	58405	58405	I	0	’ ‘
58422	58426	58414	58414	We	1147	’ said Laurence , ‘

58438	58450	58414	58414	We	1147	’ said Lady Ambrose eagerly , feeling herself near a friend , ‘

58474	58486	58414	58414	We	1147	’ said Dr. Seydon slowly , and with a sudden frown , ‘

58596	58635	58546	58546	her	670	’ exclaimed Mr. Luke , who could never resist assenting to this sentiment . Dr. Seydon darted a quick glance at Mr. Luke , as if he were anything but pleased at finding himself so readily agreed with . ‘
58638	58643	58546	58546	her	670	’ he went on , ‘

59804	59805	59781	59783	old Mr. Laurence	83	’ ‘
59815	59822	59813	59813	Otho	77	’ Laurence again began to read , ‘
60043	60152	60153	60153	I	0	‘ You know what an admirer I have always been , in many ways , of the ancients , and how , in many ways , I think modern civilisation barbarous as compared with theirs . I have not changed this opinion . I have only come lately to understand what it means . The charm of ancient life lies mainly in its form . In essence , the life open to us is , as I fully see now , infinitely superior . And to what is this superiority due ? Simply to Christianity . It came with Christianity , and it will also go with it . ‘
60177	60617	60171	60171	you	1183	‘ To begin , then — just consider the one matter of humour . Compare the ancient humourists with the modern . Think for a moment of Lucian , of Aristophanes , of Plautus , of Petronius , of Horace ; then think of Erasmus , Swift , Cervantes , Voltaire , Sterne . Does not the mere memory of the two sets of names bring home to you what a gulf in this matter there is between the ancient world and the modern ? Is not the modern humour an altogether different thing from the ancient — broader and deeper beyond comparison or measurement ? The humour of the ancients could raise a laugh ; true — that is just what it could raise , and a laugh could express all the feelings raised by it . Think of the intolerable vulgarity of Homers gods , who “ laughed consumedly ” at Vulcan , as he waited on them,—why ? because he was lame . The sense of humour on Olympus was about equal to what it would be now in a country lawyer ’s Parlour . Think of Horace , who saw in a dull pun on two proper names , a joke so excellent that he wrote a whole satire in honour of it . It is true that Juvenal showed a somewhat finer sense , when he said that when Fortune was pleased to be facetious , she made a nouveau riche ; Petronius , perhaps , was even in advance of Juvenal . But ancient humour at its best was a shallow thing . It meant little . It was like the bright sparkle on a brawling stream , hardly ankle - deep But our modern humour is like the silent snake - like lights in a still water , that go coiling down into depths unfathomable , as it lures our thoughts onwards to the contemplation of endless issues . The twinkle in the eyes of a Sterne or a Cervantes seems to hint to us of Eleusinian mysteries with a triumphant solemn treachery ; and wakes our souls , as we catch it , into a sudden , thrill of delicious furtive insight . Such humour as this may excite laughter ; but no laughter can ease our feelings fully — they also demand tears ; and even tears are not enough for us . Of such humour as this the ancients had hardly a notion ; it differs from theirs as the man differs from the baby , and seems almost like a new sense , peculiar to the modern world . ‘
61049	61153	61027	61028	The humourist	1192	‘ Think , too , by the way , of the kindred subject of wit . I was reading a play of Congreve ’s yesterday : and this made me reflect how nearly all the brightest wit of the modern world consists in showing us this one thing — that fidelity in marriage is ridiculous ; that is , in showing us what , but for Christianity , no one would ever have doubted . Such wit is , as it were , the forbidden kiss we give to common sense , from which an angry religion has been bent on separating us . ‘
61190	61512	61183	61183	everyone	347	‘ Here , then , you see , are the wit , the innuendo , the humour of the world , all owing their existence , or , at any rate , their flavour , to Christianity . And what would life , what would conversation be without these ? But it is not these only that we owe to the same source . All our finer pleasures are indebted for their chief taste to it likewise . Love in itself , for instance , is , as everyone knows who has felt it , the coarsest and most foolish of all our feelings . Leave it free to do what it pleases , and we soon cease to care what it does . But Christianity , with a miraculous ingenuity , has confined and cramped it into so grotesque and painful a posture , and set such vigilant guardians to keep it there , that any return to its natural freedom is a rapture , an adventure , and a truimph , which none but the wisest and most skilful can compass with grace or safety , and which wise men , therefore , think worth compassing . It is indeed the same with all the natural and true pleasures of life — poor tasteless things not worth living for , in themselves ; but they have been so hidden away from us , and have come to be in such bad odour with the world , that only the wisest — for wisdom is but the detection of falsehood — see that they may be taken , and have the courage to take them ; and the wisdom they are conscious of in doing this , forms a delicious sauce piquante—(of which humour , wit , and so on , are some of the flavours)—to these same poor pleasures , that can give us a real zest for them . ‘
61911	62028	61906	61906	his	1888	‘ I had once hoped that the middle classes — that vast and useless body , who have neither the skill that produces their wealth , nor the taste that can enjoy it — might have proved themselves at least of some use , by preserving the traditions of a sound , respectable morality ; that they might have kept alive the nation ’s power of being shocked and scandalised at wit , or grace , or freedom . But no ; they too are changed . With awkward halting gait they are waddling in the footsteps of their betters , and they will soon have made vice as vulgar as they long ago made virtue . ‘
62206	62249	62191	62191	I	0	’ When Laurence closed the book there was a silence of some moments , as if no one knew exactly how to take what had just been read . But at last Donald Gordon exclaimed , in his devoutest of soft whispers : ‘
62257	62295	62191	62191	I	0	’ The words acted like a spell ; the ice was broken , and Mr. Herbert , who hitherto had hardly uttered a syllable the whole afternoon , now broke out suddenly in his most emphatic accents . ‘

62539	62568	62579	62579	you	1230	’ Mr. Saunders at once took this to be a special allusion to himself , and his face involuntarily began to array itself in a smile of triumph . ‘

62884	62978	62868	62868	he	102	‘ and do I not really doubt that the degrading practice of prayer , the fetish - worship of celibacy , of mortification , and so forth — do I not doubt that the foul faith in a future life , the grotesque conceptions of the theological virtues , and that preposterous idol of the marketplace , the sanctity of marriage,—do you think I do not really doubt that we must retain these ? Do you think , on the contrary , I do not know that they are already doomed ? However , ’
62992	63089	62980	62981	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ there is no need for me at this moment to destroy any cherished illusions ; though I shall be happy to show my analysis of them that I spoke about just now to anyone who is not afraid to inspect it . I hear much said about tolerance , as a characteristic of your society . All I ask is , that you have the courage to extend your tolerance to me . Your new Republic may be full of illusions then . The great labour of destroying them will be positively delicious to me . ’
63090	63093	63095	63096	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ Well , ’

63127	63208	63209	63209	she	93	‘ I am all in favour of toleration . I think that what I consider truth is quite good enough to stand on its own merits , if unprejudiced eyes can only be got to see them . And I honestly do think , that with really high - breeding , and with what we apparently mean by culture , we should have at least one part of the world as good as we could wish it . But yet — ’
63216	63273	63209	63209	she	93	‘ we have surely settled only half the question yet . We have said a good deal about this wide and discerning taste that is to guide us , We have not said much yet about the particular things — the occupations , the duties , the pleasures , that it will lead us to choose . ’
63274	63277	63279	63280	Mr. Rose	100	‘ No , ’
63282	63310	63279	63280	Mr. Rose	100	‘ I should like myself very much to say something as to that — as to the new pleasures that modern culture has made possible for us . ’

63339	63399	63327	63327	she	92	‘ suppose we talk of this by - and - by — at dinner , or in the evening . Let us just enjoy a little now . The air now is so truly delicious . It seems quite like a sin , does n’t it , to think of going in to dinner by - and - by . ’

NO proposal could have been happier than Lady Grace ’s , of the garden banquet in the pavilion . It seemed to the guests , when they were all assembled there , that the lovely summer ’s day was going to close with a scene from fairyland . The table itself , with its flowers , and glowing fruit , and its many - coloured Venetian glass , shone and gleamed and sparkled , in the evening light , that was turning outside to a cool mellow amber ; and above , from the roof , in which the dusk was already darkness , hung china lamps , in the shape of green and purple grape - clusters , looking like luminous fruits stolen from Aladdin ’s garden . The pavilion , open on all sides , was supported on marble pillars , that were almost hidden in red and white roses . Behind , the eye rested on great tree - trunks , and glades of rich foliage ; and before , it would pass over turf and flowers , till it reached the sea beyond , on which , in another hour , the faint silver of the moonlight would begin to tremble . There was something in the whole scene that was at once calming and exhilarating ; and nearly all present seemed to feel in some measure this double effect of it . Dr. Jenkinson had been quite restored by an afternoon ’s nap ; and his face was now all a - twinkle with a fresh benignity , that had however , like an early spring morning , just a faint suspicion of frost in it . Mr. Storks even was less severe than usual ; and as he raised his champagne to his lips , he would at times look very nearly conversational . ‘

We have a number of isolated right interiors ; we have a few , very few right exteriors . But in our ideal state , our entire city — our London — the metropolis of our society , would be as a whole as perfect as these fragments . Taste would not there be merely an indoor thing . It would be written visibly for all to look upon , in our streets , our squares , our gardens . Could we only mould England to our wishes , the thing to do , I am persuaded , would be to remove London to some kindlier site , that it might there be altogether born anew . I myself would have it taken to the south - west , and to the sea - coast , where the waves are blue , and where the air is calm and fine , and there — ’

66906	67017	66894	66894	he	100	‘ that as the imagination is a quick workman , I can at this moment see our metropolis already transplanted and rebuilt . I seem to see it now as it were from a distance , with its palaces , its museums , its churches , its convents , its gardens , its picture - galleries — a cluster of domed and pillared marble , sparkling on a gray headland . It is Rome , it is Athens , it is Florence , arisen and come to life again , in these modern days . The aloe - tree of beauty again blossoms there , under the azure stainless sky . ’
67018	67026	67028	67029	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Do you know , Mr. Rose , ’
67036	67127	67028	67029	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ all this is very beautiful ; and certainly no one can think London as it is more ugly than I do . That ’s natural in me , is n’t it , being a denizen of poor prosaic South Audley Street as I am ? But do n’t you think that your notion is — it ’s very beautiful , I quite feel that — but do n’t you think it is perhaps a little too dream - like — too unreal , if you know what I mean ? ’
67128	67133	67135	67136	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Such a city , ’
67139	67474	67476	67477	Mr. Rose	100	‘ is indeed a dream , but it is a dream which we might make a reality , would circumstances only permit of it . We have many amongst us who know what is beautiful , and who passionately desire it ; and would others only be led by these , it is quite conceivable that we might some day have a capital , the entire aspect of which should be the visible embodiment of our finest and most varied culture , our most sensitive taste , and our deepest æsthetic measure of things . This is what this capital of our new Republic must be , this dwelling - place of our ideal society . We shall have houses , galleries , streets , theatres , such as Giulio Romano or Giorgio Vasari , or Giulio Campi would have rejoiced to look at ; we shall have metal - work worthy of the hand of Ghiberti and the praise of Michel Angelo ; we shall rival Domenico Beccafumi with our pavements . As you wander through our thoroughfares and our gardens , your feelings will not be jarred by the presence of human vulgarity , or the desolating noise of traffic ; nor in every spare space will your eyes be caught by abominable advertisements of excursion trains to Brighton , or of Horniman ’s cheap tea . They will rest instead , here on an exquisite fountain , here on a statue , here on a bust of Zeus or Hermes or Aphrodite , glimmering in a laurelled nook ; or on a Mater Dolorosa looking down on you from her holy shrine ; or on the carved marble gate - posts of our palace gardens , or on their wrought iron or wrought bronze gates ; or perhaps on such triumphal arches as that which Antonio San Gallo constructed in honour of Charles V. , and of which you must all remember the description given by Vasari . Such a city , ’
67479	67643	67476	67477	Mr. Rose	100	‘ would be the externalisation of the human spirit in the highest state of development that we can conceive for it . We should there see expressed openly all our appreciations of all the beauty that we can detect in the world ’s whole history . The wind of the spirit that breathed there would blow to us from all the places of the past , and be charged with infinite odours . Every frieze on our walls , every clustered capital of a marble column , would be a garland or nosegay of associations . Indeed , our whole city , as compared with the London that is now , would be itself a nosegay as compared with a faggot ; and as related to the life that I would see lived in it , it would be like a shell murmuring with all the world ’s memories , and held to the ear of the two twins , Life and Love . ’
67671	67682	67683	67683	he	100	‘ You will see what I mean , plainly enough , ’
67686	67704	67683	67683	he	100	‘ if you will just think of our architecture , and consider how that naturally will be — ’
67705	67708	67710	67711	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Yes , ’
67713	67724	67710	67711	Mr. Luke	99	‘ I should be glad to hear about our architecture . ’
67725	67733	67734	67735	Mr. Rose	100	‘ — How that naturally will be , ’
67739	67746	67734	67735	Mr. Rose	100	‘ of no style in particular . ’
67747	67754	67756	67757	Mr. Luke	99	‘ The deuce it wo n’t ! ’
67759	67762	67764	67765	Mr. Rose	100	‘ No , ’
67769	67848	67764	67765	Mr. Rose	100	‘ no style in particular , but a renaissance of all styles . It will matter nothing to us whether they be pagan or Catholic , classical or mediæval . We shall be quite without prejudice or bigotry . To the eye of true taste , an Aquinas in his cell before a crucifix , or a Narcissus gazing at himself in a still fountain , are — in their own ways , you know — equally beautiful . ’
67849	67854	67856	67857	Miss Merton	93	‘ Well , really , ’
67859	67929	67856	67857	Miss Merton	93	‘ I can not fancy St. Thomas being a very taking object to people who do n’t believe in him either as a saint or a philosopher . I always think that , except from a Christian point of view , a saint can be hardly better described than by Newman ’s lines , as — A bundle of bones , whose breath Infects the world before his death . ’
67930	67937	67939	67940	Mr. Rose	100	‘ I remember the lines well , ’
67943	68001	67939	67940	Mr. Rose	100	‘ and the writer you mention puts them in the mouth of a yelping devil . But devils , as far as I know , are not generally — except , perhaps , Milton’s — conspicuous for taste : indeed , if we may trust Goethe , the very touch of a flower is torture to them . ’
68002	68008	68010	68011	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ Dante ’s biggest devil , ’
68018	68043	68010	68011	Mr. Saunders	102	‘ chewed Judas Iscariot like a quid of tobacco , to all eternity . He , at any rate , knew what he liked . ’
68072	68077	68078	68078	he	100	‘ Let me rather , ’
68081	68150	68151	68151	he	100	‘ read a nice sonnet to you , which I had sent to me this morning , and which was in my mind just now . These lines’—Mr . Rose here produced a paper from his pocket—‘were written by a boy of eighteen — a youth of extraordinary promise , I think , whose education I may myself claim to have had some share in directing . Listen , ’
68165	68168	68173	68173	himself	100	‘ Yes , ’
68180	68190	68191	68191	he	100	‘ they are dear lines . Now , there , ’
68194	68268	68191	68191	he	100	‘ we have a true and tender expression of the really Catholic spirit of modern æstheticism , which holds nothing common or unclean . It is in this spirit , I say , that the architects of our state will set to work . And thus for our houses , for our picture - galleries , for our churches — I trust we shall have many churches — they will select and combine — ’
68269	68275	68278	68278	Allen	101	‘ Do you seriously mean , ’
68284	68319	68278	68278	Allen	101	‘ that it is a thing to wish for and to look forward to , that we should abandon all attempts at original architecture , and content ourselves with simply sponging on the past ? ’
68320	68324	68326	68327	Mr. Rose	100	‘ I do , ’
68330	68367	68326	68327	Mr. Rose	100	‘ and for this reason , if for no other , that the world can now successfully do nothing else . Nor , indeed , is it to be expected or even wished that it should . ’
68368	68378	68380	68381	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ You say we have no good architecture now ! ’
68383	68410	68380	68381	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ but , Mr. Rose , have you forgotten our modern churches ? Do n’t you think them beautiful ? Perhaps you never go to All Saints ’
68412	68413	68414	68414	I	0	’ ‘
68420	68425	68414	68414	I	0	’ said Mr. Rose , ‘
68547	68585	68501	68502	the priests	2353	’ Lady Ambrose did not express her approbation of the last part of this sentiment , out of regard for Miss Merton ; but she gave a smile and a nod of pleased intelligence to Mr. Rose . ‘
68588	68594	68501	68502	the priests	2353	’ Mr. Rose went on , ‘
68638	68639	68633	68634	the congregations	1312	’ ‘
68646	68653	68633	68634	the congregations	1312	’ interrupted Lady Ambrose with vigour , ‘
68664	68665	68660	68661	Mr. Cope	262	’ ‘
68671	68677	68666	68666	I	0	’ said Mr. Rose languidly . ‘

69249	69265	69216	69216	he	1322	’ murmured Dr. Jenkinson , whose face had become gradually the very picture of crossness . ‘
69273	69287	69267	69267	you	0	’ said Miss Merton , with a half humorous , half incredulous smile , ‘
69302	69303	69267	69267	you	0	’ ‘
69309	69317	69267	69267	you	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Rose in gentle horror ; ‘

69403	69414	69416	69417	Miss Merton	93	’m afraid that the faith is not quite sunk yet , ’
69455	69458	69460	69461	Mr. Rose	100	‘ No , ’
69463	69473	69460	69461	Mr. Rose	100	‘ such cyclic sunsets are happily apt to linger . ’
69474	69478	69480	69481	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Mr. Rose , ’
69490	69524	69480	69481	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ of course everyone who has ears must know that all this is very beautiful , but I am positively so stupid that I have n’t been quite able to follow it all . ’
69525	69535	69536	69536	he	100	‘ I will try to make my meaning clearer , ’
69544	69765	69536	69536	he	100	‘ I often figure to myself an unconscious period and a conscious one , as two women — one an untamed creature with embrowned limbs native to the air and the sea ; the other marble - white and swan - soft , couched delicately on cushions before a mirror , and watching her own supple reflection gleaming in the depths of it . On the one is the sunshine and the sea - spray . The wind of Heaven and her unbound hair are playmates . The light of the sky is in her eyes ; on her lips is a free laughter . We look at her , and we know that she is happy . We know it , mark me ; but she knows it not . Turn , however , to the other , and all is changed . Outwardly , there is no gladness there . Her dark , gleaming eyes open depth within depth upon us , like the circles of a new Inferno . There is a clear , shadowy pallor on her cheek . Only her lips are scarlet . There is a sadness — a languor , even in the grave tendrils of her heavy hair , and in each changing curve of her bosom as she breathes or sighs . ’
69766	69776	69778	69779	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ What a very odd man Mr. Rose is ! ’
69785	69817	69778	69779	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ He always seems to talk of everybody as if they had no clothes on . And does he mean by this that we ought to be always in the dumps ? ’
69818	69821	69822	69823	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Yes , ’
69834	70023	69828	69828	his	100	‘ there is no eagerness , no action there ; and yet all eagerness , all action is known to her as the writing on an open scroll ; only , as she reads , even in the reading of it , action turns into emotion , and eagerness into a sighing memory . Yet such a woman really may stand symbolically for us as the patroness and the lady of all gladness , who makes us glad in the only way now left us . And not only in the only way , but in the best way — the way of ways . Her secret is self - consciousness . She knows that she is fair ; she knows , too , that she is sad ; but she sees that sadness is lovely , and so sadness turns to joy . Such a woman may be taken as a symbol , not of our architecture only , but of all the eesthetic surroundings with which we shall shelter and express our life . Such a woman do I see whenever I enter a ritualistic church — ’
70024	70028	70030	70031	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ I know , ’
70033	70049	70050	70050	she	106	‘ that very peculiar people do go to such places ; but , Mr. Rose , ’
70059	70072	70050	70050	she	106	‘ I thought they were generally rather over - dressed than otherwise ? ’
70073	70077	70079	70080	Mr. Rose	100	‘ The imagination , ’
70092	70202	70083	70083	his	100	‘ may give her what garb it chooses . Our whole city , then — the city of our new Republic — will be in keeping with this spirit . It will be the architectural and decorative embodiment of the most educated longings of our own times after order and loveliness and delight , whether of the senses or the imagination . It will be , as it were , a resurrection of the past , in response to the longing and the passionate regret of the present . It will be such a resurrection as took place in Italy during its greatest epoch , only with this difference — ’
70203	70214	70216	70217	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ You seem to have forgotten trade and business altogether , ’
70219	70238	70216	70217	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ I think , however rich you intend to be , you will find that they are necessary . ’
70239	70246	70083	70083	his	100	‘ Yes , Mr. Rose , you ’re
70260	70265	70257	70257	I	0	’ said Lady Ambrose . ‘
70271	70281	70282	70282	we	1329	’ said Mrs. Sinclair , with a soft maliciousness , ‘
70299	70304	70295	70295	I	0	’ she continued plaintively , ‘
70333	70334	70328	70328	I	0	’ ‘
70337	70346	70328	70328	I	0	’ said Mr. Rose , a little annoyed , ‘
70377	70378	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ ‘
70384	70389	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ said Lady Ambrose . ‘
70395	70400	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ said Donald Gordon , ‘
70435	70436	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ ‘
70439	70444	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ said Mr. Rose , ‘
70448	70449	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ ‘
70454	70459	70390	70391	Mr. Rose	100	’ said Lady Ambrose , ‘
70526	70529	70530	70530	she	1338	’m sure , ’
70538	70550	70530	70530	she	1338	‘ you would , my dear , with all your taste . ’
70551	70555	70557	70558	Miss Merton	93	‘ It certainly , ’
70562	70584	70557	70558	Miss Merton	93	‘ all sounds very beautiful . All I am afraid of is that we should not be quite worthy of it . ’
70585	70588	70590	70591	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Nay , ’
70593	70763	70590	70591	Mr. Rose	100	‘ but the very point is that we shall be worthy of it , and that it will be worthy of us . I said , if you recollect , just now , that the world ’s ideal of the future must resemble in many ways its memory of the Italian Renaissance . But do n’t let that mislead you . It may resemble that , but it will be something far in advance of it . During the last three hundred years — in fact , during the last sixty or seventy years , the soul of man has developed strangely in its sentiments and its powers of feeling ; in its powers , in fact , of enjoying life . As I said , I have a work in the press , devoted entirely to a description of this growth . I have some of the proof sheets with me ; and if you will let me I should like to read you one or two passages . ’
70764	70777	70779	70780	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ I do n’t think much can be made out of that , ’
70787	70816	70817	70817	he	95	‘ Human sentiment dresses itself in different fashions , as human ladies do ; but I think beneath the surface it is much the same . I mean , ’
70846	70884	70817	70817	he	95	‘ I mean that I do n’t think in seventy years , or even in three hundred , you will be able to show that human nature has very much changed . I do n’t think so . ’
70911	70923	70925	70926	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Ah , Jenkinson , I think you are wrong there , ’
70928	71100	70925	70926	Mr. Luke	99	‘ As long as we recognise that this growth is at present confined to a very small minority , the fact of such growth is the most important , the most significant of all facts . Indeed , our friend Mr. Rose is quite right thus far , in the stress he lays on our appreciation of the past , that we have certainly in these modern times acquired a new sense , by which alone the past can be appreciated truly , the sense which , if I may invent a phrase for it , I should call that of Historical Perspective ; so that now really for the first time the landscape of history is beginning to have some intelligible charm for us . And this , you know , is not all . Our whole views of things—(you , Jenkinson , must know this as well as I do)—the Zeitgeist breathes upon them , and they do not die ; but they are changed — they are enlightened . ’
71124	71142	71116	71116	he	376	‘ That ’s not what Mr. Rose was saying ; that ’s not what I was contradicting . ’
71143	71164	71166	71167	Mr. Storks	113	‘ You take , Luke , a rather more rose - coloured view of things than you did last night , ’
71169	71172	71174	71175	Mr. Luke	99	‘ No , ’
71181	71287	71174	71175	Mr. Luke	99	‘ far from it . I am not denying ( pray , Jenkinson , remember this ) that the majority of us are at present either Barbarians or Philistines ; and the ugliness of these is more glaring now than at any former time . But that any of us are able to see them thus distinctly in their true colours , itself shows that there must be a deal of light somewhere . Even to make darkness visible some light is needed . We should always recollect that . We are only discontented with ourselves when we are struggling to be better than ourselves . ’
71288	71294	71296	71296	Laurence	83	‘ And in many ways , ’
71298	71404	71296	71296	Laurence	83	‘ I think the struggle has been successful . Take , for instance , the pleasure we get now from the aspects of external nature , and the way in which these seem to mix themselves with our lives . This certainly is something distinctly modern . And nearly all our other feelings , it seems to me , have changed just like this one , and have become more sensitive , and more highly organised . If we may judge by its expression in literature , love has , certainly ; and that I suppose is the most important and comprehensive feeling in life . ’
71405	71413	71415	71416	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Does Mr. Laurence only suppose that ? ’
71423	71426	71428	71429	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Well , ’
71431	71474	71428	71429	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ our feelings about these two things — about love and external nature — perhaps have changed somewhat . Yes , I think they have . I think you might make an interesting magazine article out of that — but hardly more . ’
71475	71479	71481	71481	Laurence	83	‘ I rather , ’
71484	71578	71579	71579	he	83	‘ agree with Mr. Luke and Mr. Rose , that all our feelings have developed just as these two have . And I think this is partly owing to the fusion in our minds of our sacred and secular ideas — which indeed you were speaking of this morning in your sermon . Thus , to find some rational purpose in life was once merely enjoined as a supernatural duty . In our times it has taken our common nature upon it , and become a natural longing — though , I fear , ’
71583	71588	71579	71579	he	83	‘ a fruitless one . ’
71589	71592	71595	71596	Lady Grace	89	‘ Yes , ’
71609	71715	71595	71596	Lady Grace	89	‘ and if you are speaking of modern progress , Otho , you should not leave out the diffusion of those grand ideas of justice , and right , and freedom , and humanity which are at work in the great heart of the nation . We are growing cultivated in Mr. Luke ’s noble sense of the word , and our whole hearts revolt against the way in which women have hitherto been treated , and against the cruelties which dogma asserts the good God can practise , and the cruelties on the poor animals which wicked men do practise . And war too , ’
71730	71805	71716	71717	Lady Grace	89	‘ think how fast we are outgrowing that ! England at any rate will never watch the outbreak of another war , with all its inevitable cruelties , without giving at least one sob that shall make all Europe pause and listen . Indeed , we must not forget how the entire substance of religion is ceasing to be a mass of dogmas , and is becoming embodied instead in practice and in action . ’
71806	71813	71815	71816	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Quite true , Lady Grace , ’
71839	71844	71845	71845	he	99	‘ As to war , ’
71849	71866	71845	71845	he	99	‘ there may , of course , be different opinions . Questions of policy may arise — ’
71868	71874	71845	71845	he	99	‘ As if any policy , ’
71879	71888	71845	71845	he	99	‘ could justify us in such a thing ! ’
71890	71981	71845	71845	he	99	‘ but religion — yes , that , as I have been trying to teach the world , is the great and important point on which culture is beginning to cast its light — and with just the effect which you describe . It is true that culture is at present but a little leaven hid in a barrel of meal ; but still it is doing its work slowly ; and in the matter of religion — indeed , in all matters , for religion rightly understood embraces all — ’
71983	71994	71996	71997	Lady Grace	89	‘ I do like to hear Mr. Luke talk sometimes , ’
72000	72068	71845	71845	he	99	‘ its effect is just this — to show us that religion in any civilised , any reasonable , any sweet sense , can never be found except embodied in action ; that it is , in fact , nothing but right action , pointed — winged , as it were — by right emotion , by a glow , an aspiration — an aspiration towards God — ’
72077	72082	71845	71845	he	99	‘ not of course , ’
72089	72111	72083	72084	Mr. Luke	99	‘ that petulant Pedant of the theologians — that irritable angry Father , with the very uncertain temper — but towards — ’
72112	72121	72123	72124	Lady Grace	89	‘ An infinite , inscrutable , loving Being , ’
72134	72138	72140	72141	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Quite so , ’

72221	72277	72217	72218	Lady Grace	89	‘ Mr. Luke , do you mean to say that — but it surely must matter something whether God can hear our prayers , and will help us , and whether we owe Him any duty , and whether He is conscious of what we do , and will judge us — it must matter — ’

72429	72445	72420	72420	she	89	‘ nolo episcopari . You see I do know a little Latin , Mr. Luke . ’
72446	72449	72451	72452	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Yes , ’
72466	72484	72458	72458	he	99	‘ and a bit that has more wisdom in it than all other ecclesiastical Latin put together . ’

It was soon found to have issued from Mr. Saunders , who had hardly spoken more than a few sentences during the whole of dinner . ‘
72624	72631	72534	72534	I	0	‘ was enquired by several voices . ‘

72756	72805	72813	72814	young fellows	1352	’ No sooner had Mr. Saunders and Mr. Rose departed than Dr. Jenkinson began to recover his equanimity somewhat . Seeing this , Mr. Storks , who had himself during dinner been first soothed and then ruffled into silence , found suddenly the strings of his tongue loosed . ‘
72816	72829	72813	72814	young fellows	1352	’ he said , looking after the retreating form of Mr. Saunders , ‘
72871	72878	73016	73017	Mr. Storks	113	’m told he gives Sunday lectures . ’
72879	72882	72884	72885	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Yes , ’
72891	72903	72884	72885	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ it ’s all very bad taste — very bad taste . ’
72904	72912	72914	72915	Mr. Storks	113	‘ And the worst of it is , ’
72917	72961	72914	72915	Mr. Storks	113	‘ that these young men really get hold of a fact or two , and then push them on to their own coarse and insane conclusions — which have , I admit , to the vulgar eye , the look of being obvious . ’
72962	72965	72967	72968	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Yes , ’
72975	73003	72967	72968	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ we should always suspect everything that seems very obvious . Glaring inconsistencies and glaring consistencies are both sure to vanish if you look closely into them . ’
73004	73015	73016	73017	Mr. Storks	113	‘ Now , all that about God , for instance , ’
73021	73039	73016	73017	Mr. Storks	113	‘ is utterly uncalled for ; and , as young Saunders puts it , is utterly misleading . ’
73040	73043	73045	73046	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Yes , ’
73048	73059	73045	73046	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ it all depends upon the way you say it . ’
73060	73065	73067	73068	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ I hardly think , ’
73074	73109	73067	73068	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ that we need waste much thought upon his way . It is a very common one — that of the puppy that barks at the heels of the master whose meat it steals . ’
73110	73114	73116	73117	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ May I , ’
73126	73164	73116	73117	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ ask this , for I am a little puzzled here . Do I understand that Mr. Saunders ’s arguments may be held , on the face of the thing , to disprove the existence of God ? ’
73210	73290	73207	73207	he	95	‘ No , Mr. Herbert , I do n’t think Mr. Saunders can disprove that , nor anyone else either . For the world has at present no adequate definition of God ; and I think we should be able to define a thing before we can satisfactorily disprove it . I think so . I have no doubt Mr. Saunders can disprove the existence of God , as he would define Him . All atheists can do that . ’
73291	73294	73296	73297	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ Ah , ’
73299	73303	73296	73297	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ nobly said ! ’

We must n’t leap at Utopias , either religious or irreligious . Let us be content with the knowledge that all dogmas will expand in proportion as we feel they need expansion ; for all mere forms are transitory , and even the personality of — ’
73408	73413	73415	73416	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Ah , Jenkinson , ’
73424	73570	73419	73420	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ we see what you mean ; and capital sense it is too . But you do yourself as much as anyone else a great injustice , in not seeing that the age is composed of two parts , and that the cultured minority is infinitely in advance of the Philistine majority — which alone is , properly speaking , the present ; the minority being really the soul of the future waiting for its body , which at present can exist only as a Utopia . It is the wants of this soul that we have been talking over this afternoon . When the ladies come back to us , there are several things that I should like to say ; and then you will see what we mean , Jenkinson — and that even poor Rose has really some right on his side . ’
73588	73595	73599	73599	he	376	‘ I do n’t think so . ’
73602	73622	73624	73625	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ WE could really , Mr. Luke , almost fancy that we heard the Sirens singing , just now , ’
73721	73724	73725	73726	Mrs. Sinclair	106	‘ Yes , ’
73746	73811	73812	73812	she	106	‘ I never saw anything like the sea to - night . Far off the spray amongst the rocks looked like mermaids playing ; and at our feet it seemed as if the little pale waves were whispering and sighing messages to us . I do n’t think I should like to tell quite all I thought they said to me . And listen , ’
73819	73898	73812	73812	she	106	‘ is not that the nightingale ? It is — I am certain it is ! — The same that oft - times hath Charmed magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faëry lands forlorn . What a night it is , to be sure ! We all felt down on the beach as if we were literally breathing in Romance — or — well , I do n’t know what the right word is . ’
73899	73903	73905	73906	Mr. Rose	100	‘ And I , ’
73908	73951	73905	73906	Mr. Rose	100	‘ have been explaining to them , that , had they lived in any other age , they would have felt nothing of all this ; that they feel it , by virtue of senses that have only been acquired in ours . ’
73952	73955	73957	73958	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Yes , ’
73964	73991	73992	73992	he	99	‘ that ’s quite true , and I want now to try and explain clearly how and why it is true . I was particularly anxious , ’
74006	74052	73992	73992	he	99	‘ to speak of this when your Roman Catholic friend was here ; as she seems a very intelligent young lady , and is , I have no doubt , fully alive to some of the grotesquenesses of what she considers to be her creed . ’
74121	74124	74125	74126	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Now , ’
74145	74457	74130	74130	his	99	‘ we all of us feel , in a general way — I think I may say that we nearly all of us feel — that the cultured minority of the present age is endowed with feelings , sentiments , and powers of insight , not only in advance of its common contemporaries , but in advance of all preceding times . We understand natural beauty , and natural affections , and above all moral beauty , in a new way , all our own . Now , to what is the advance due ? It is all due to culture in its highest connection — its connection with religion . We feel stronger emotions about natural scenery , for just the same reason that we feel stronger emotions about righteousness . And the reason is , that our emotions , in either case , no longer tempt us to draw grotesque inferences from themselves . There ’s the whole heart of the matter . We rest gratefully content with the objects that excite our love ; we do n’t pass away beyond them , and forget them . You had an excellent instance of the old treatment I condemn in those verses of Euripides which Mr. Laurence has translated with so much tenderness . There , you see , you have nature — flowers , meadows , and so forth ; and more important still , you have a high conception of virtue . But yet in that poem you have no real feeling for either the flowers or the virtue . The feeling only grazes these , so to speak , and glances off to a shadowy deity beyond , who was no more true , no more verifiable , than any of the rest of her kind , male or female , singular or triple . And now , ’
74468	74539	74541	74542	Mr. Luke	99	‘ here is another illustration of the whole thing — of the advance made by culture in our entire mental state , of which I particularly wanted to talk to you ( for in one point at least we agree , even professedly — the doctrine of development ) , and this is an illustration of it that you in a special way will appreciate . You , of course , ’
74544	74557	74541	74542	Mr. Luke	99	‘ know something more or less about St. Augustine , I suppose . ’
74615	74618	74619	74620	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Well , ’
74624	74819	74619	74620	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Augustine was on the whole , you know , the most cultured of all the Fathers , and , considering the early date at which he lived , had in some ways a real insight into Christianity ; so we may safely consider him as the most favourable specimen of the results of the old system . Let us take then the purest and most elevating of all the pleasures of life , and enquire , through him , how it is treated and looked upon by theological Christianity . The eyes , says Augustine , love fair and various forms , and shining and lovely colours ; and all day long they are before me , and solicit my contemplation . “ For ” ( and this exquisite sentence I remember in his very words ) “ the Light , that queen of colours , bathing all that we can look upon , from morning till evening , let me go where I will , will still keep gliding by me in unnumbered guises , and soothes me whilst I am busy at other things , and am thinking nothing of her . ’
74846	74850	74851	74851	he	99	‘ And now , ’
74854	74890	74851	74851	he	99	‘ what return does our gentleman make to the light for its beautiful and constant service to him ? Does he thank it ? does he praise it ? does he seek it ? No — ’
74949	74969	74918	74918	he	99	’ said Mr. Luke , with a confident appeal to Miss Merton , whose expression was now slightly altering , ‘
75189	75204	75184	75184	he	99	’ A sudden sigh here escaped from some one . Mr. Luke looked round . ‘
75207	75212	75184	75184	he	99	’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton , ‘
75228	75265	75266	75266	I	0	’ The fashion of Mr. Luke ’s countenance changed . He stopped short , he would not proceed a word farther . His whole quotation had been ruined , he felt , by this odious interruption . ‘
75270	75288	75289	75289	I	0	’ said Miss Merton , who thought Mr. Luke pausing that she might give in her acquiescence , ‘
75317	75350	75351	75351	I	0	’ She smiled as she said this ; but there was a little embarrassment in her tone which was perceived by Laurence , and which brought him at once to her rescue . ‘

77259	77271	77273	77273	you	1417	’ exclaimed Mr. Rose eagerly , as soon as Laurence stopped ; ‘
77305	77327	77273	77273	you	1417	’ said Mr. Rose , who was sitting ready under one of the lamps with some printer ’s proofs before him , ‘
77445	77458	77460	77461	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Oh , this will never do — this will never do ! ’
77474	77482	77483	77484	Mr. Rose	100	‘ “ Into the strange passion , ” ’
77488	77692	77483	77484	Mr. Rose	100	‘ “ of which hers is the tutelage , there have melted the sounds of woods and of waters , and the shapes and the hues of mountains , and the savour of airs and winds , and the odours of all flowers . All the joys , indeed , of the senses have fallen into it , like streams into one sea . And with the joys of the spirit it has been likewise . But whereas the senses have contributed their joys mainly , the spirit has contributed its sorrows and pains as well . Throughout this love , despite its fulness of life , there yet runs also a constant taint of death , of which it needs cleansing — grotesque troubles and misgivings of conscience , and cloistral meditations , and fantastic repentances . For this very reason , however , is it the more wholly expressive to us of the man ’s inner development . It shows us how all his desires , senses , and powers of feeling have been growing together , and coalescing into a single organism , capable of quite new sets of pleasures , and responding to far finer movements from without . ” ’
77693	77696	77698	77699	Mr. Luke	99	‘ H’m , ’
77709	77729	77730	77730	he	99	‘ there ’s a great deal of truth in that — a very great deal — if the fellow , ’
77735	77744	77730	77730	he	99	‘ would only put it a little better . ’
77745	77751	77753	77754	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Are you quite sure , ’
77766	77786	77753	77754	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ that anyone at all feels all these things , beyond the very few people who talk about them ? ’
77787	77790	77792	77793	Mr. Rose	100	‘ Yes , ’
77810	77826	77792	77793	Mr. Rose	100	‘ all feel thus who have any part or lot in the world ’s development . ’
77827	77830	77832	77833	the Doctor	376	‘ You , ’
77842	77889	77832	77833	the Doctor	376	‘ think so , Laurence , do n’t you , because you find some of the same sort of phrases in novels ? I do n’t think you ’ll find very much thought in those novels — not very much . They are effeminate foolish books . ’
77890	77893	77895	77895	Allen	101	‘ Yes , ’
77906	78095	77895	77895	Allen	101	‘ a great deal of this increased depth and refinement of feeling , I know , is very good — all of it , I dare say , may be . But still , if left to itself , it must tend — indeed , I have often seen it tend — to make men effeminate , as Dr. Jenkinson says , and unfit for work . Now , I dare say Mr. Luke will call me a barbarian , but I am going to venture to say that , in spite of all that is said against it , that barbarous thing sport — shooting , deer - stalking , hunting — is of great value , especially to people who are not barbarians , as a kind of mental tonic . It makes them active and spirited — it must do so : it gives them presence of mind , and a readiness to exert themselves ; and though sport may in one sense be a self - indulgence , it is a self - indulgence that is constantly teaching all sorts of self - denial . ’
78096	78102	78104	78105	Mr. Luke	99	‘ My dear Lord Allen , ’
78107	78276	78104	78105	Mr. Luke	99	‘ I most entirely agree with you . It does seem , I admit , at first sight , a somewhat singular thing , that the result of the latest civilisation should be to give men leisure to return to the occupations of their earliest barbarism — and those too deprived of their one justification — necessity . But still these barbarous sports must , as you say , if not pursued too exclusively , give a valuable moral tone to minds whose refinement might else become weakness . Only the worst of the matter , as it actually stands , is this — that the majority of people who do follow sport , are the very people who have no refinement that needs strengthening , but merely an idle aimless strength that needs refining . And you must remember , Lord Allen , that the man who is gluttonous of aimless bodily action is no better than the man who is an epicure in aimless mental emotion . ’
78277	78281	78283	78284	Donald Gordon	103	‘ And so , ’
78290	78350	78283	78284	Donald Gordon	103	‘ this is what we must remedy in our new Republic . Our gentlemen there must have both sides of their nature developed equally ; and they must be at once so intellectual and so manly , as to be content that partridges and foxes shall die exclusively for them , without their living exclusively for partridges and foxes . ’
78351	78355	78357	78358	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Exactly so , ’
78361	78368	78370	78370	Allen	101	‘ Some one observed this afternoon , ’
78380	78490	78370	78370	Allen	101	‘ how one could see the expression of a girl ’s face changed by the influence of a little genuine mental culture . I have noticed the same thing in men ’s faces , under the influence of a little genuine bodily culture . And I think myself that the moors of your country , or a river in Norway , or a good cruise in a yacht , may go — well , at least half as far towards making a complete man , as the study of books , and art , and poetry , in an arm - chair , or in a picture - gallery . ’
78491	78499	78501	78502	Miss Merton	93	‘ I think that is so true , ’
78518	78521	78522	78523	the Doctor	376	‘ But , ’
78527	78569	78522	78523	the Doctor	376	‘ you must want something besides looking at pretty scenery , and falling in love , and shooting . I think you want something besides that to make life complete . You will want to exercise your intellect — your reason . ’
78570	78573	78575	78575	Allen	101	‘ Yes , ’
78577	78605	78575	78575	Allen	101	‘ and I defend all this voluntary physical exercise and excitement , because I think it makes the mind even more healthy than it does the body . ’
78606	78609	78611	78612	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Yes , ’
78617	78624	78611	78612	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ I think that ’s right . ’
78625	78630	78632	78633	Lady Grace	89	‘ You , gentlemen , ’
78635	78659	78632	78633	Lady Grace	89	‘ seem to be taking very good care of yourselves ; but are we women to shoot and take all this exercise also ? ’
78660	78663	78665	78666	Mr. Luke	99	‘ That , ’
78672	78876	78665	78666	Mr. Luke	99	‘ we defer to your superior wisdom . There are , however , two helps to education , akin to exercise , in which both sexes will share , and which in a perfect state of society would be most important in their results . I mean travelling , and the halving of our lives between town and country . The completeness , the many - sidedness of such culture as there is amongst us , is in a great measure due to these ; but it is only slowly that we are learning to use them properly . Of course , Jenkinson , you understand all this — no man can do so better . It is simply the music and gymnastic of the Greeks . It is simply true education , which is but another name for culture . And in the cultivated man , thought , and taste , and feeling , and spirit are really all one , and fused together . Could we but look forward to a time when all or even the greater part of those one meets would unite these priceless gifts , there might then indeed be some satisfaction and some hope in life . ’

78918	79056	78916	78916	Laurence	83	‘ but we have included that already . We have found that that is pre - supposed in every educated pleasure . It is that that gives even our lightest conversation its best sparkle , and beads its surface over with its bright , crisp foam of half - conscious irony . The moral ideal is a note , as it were , which we are always hearing , and with which our daily talk makes continual harmonies , because it is never pitched in unison with it . Thus we talk of killing time , and so on , as being the great end of our lives ; of money or position being the only thing to marry for ; and of marriage ties as if they were always a weariness , or a grotesque torture . ’

79131	79139	79141	79142	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ And do you want no religion ? ’
79158	79163	79165	79166	Mr. Luke	99	‘ My dear Jenkinson , ’
79168	79257	79165	79166	Mr. Luke	99	‘ you and I agree upon these matters so well , that I think you must be trying to misunderstand us . Can religion and morals be separated ? and are not they both included in what we mean by culture ? Is it not in virtue of culture — of that nice and complex discrimination — that we can tell at once when we come across a genuine logion of Jesus amongst the sayings vulgarly supposed to be most distinctive of Him ? Think , for instance , ’
79262	79337	79339	79340	Mr. Luke	99	‘ what a beautiful and profound harmony is at once made amongst our heartstrings , if culture have really tuned them , by such a story as that of the woman taken in adultery , or by the parable of the Prodigal Son , or by such simple , pregnant sayings as , “ ὑπάγω καὶ ἔρχομαι πρὸς ” and then turn for a moment to the theological accounts of the Trinity ! Why , ’
79346	79402	79339	79340	Mr. Luke	99	‘ to sit on the key - board of an organ would make music compared to the discord , the jangling , the string - breaking that Church Catechisms , and Athanasian Creeds , and Episcopal speculations on the personality of the Creator , make on the musical instrument of the cultured mind . Ah , ’
79407	79551	79403	79404	Mr. Luke	99	‘ could the Founder of Christianity only have found men of more culture as His immediate disciples and reporters — could He only have secured a biographer as simply honest as poor Boswell was — Well , well , but it ’s no use speculating about what might have been . Religion has had bad times hitherto , but now at last we — some of us , at least — are seeing the way to make them better ; you yourself , Jenkinson , amongst the number . And all this is due to that very thing which we say is the essence of the best human life — culture ; culture which is neither religion , nor morality , nor taste , nor intellect , nor knowledge , nor wide reading , but the single result of all — and this , ’
79556	79595	79552	79553	Mr. Luke	99	‘ showing itself to the full — doing itself complete justice , through — as our friends have already said — what we call polish and high - breeding , and refinement of manner , and of manners . ’
79596	79600	79602	79603	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ Surely you , ’
79615	79728	79602	79603	Mr. Stockton	110	‘ must agree with us that the present century has seen the soul of man widening out , with all its marvellous powers , and displaying new riches of beauty like an unfolding flower . But whilst we value — and none can value more than I — our higher flights of imagination , our finer forms of love , and poetry , and worship , I am not blind to the great agent that is at the bottom of all this change . I mean the emancipated human intellect , with all its manifold apparatus of discovery and conquest — that great liberator of life , and thought , and religion . ’
79729	79737	79739	79740	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ There is some truth in that , ’
79745	79763	79764	79764	he	95	‘ but I think you are all putting it in a wrong way . And , Luke , ’
79772	79816	79764	79764	he	95	‘ to understand Christianity , you must know something of other religions too . You must study the great religions of the East , and compare them with those of the West . No religion can be understood by its own light only . ’
79817	79823	79825	79826	Mr. Rose	100	‘ In our ideal city , ’
79828	79857	79825	79826	Mr. Rose	100	‘ as I saw it in my brief Apocalypse , you will find a home and a temple for every creed , and for every form of worship . ’
79858	79861	79863	79864	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ What ! ’
79866	79881	79863	79864	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ does Dr. Jenkinson want us to introduce Juggernaut and his car into England ? ’
79882	79890	79893	79894	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ May I ask you one question , ’
79897	80029	80039	80040	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ a question which at times , I confess , seems to me not without importance ! Will this religion of yours , as you told us in the afternoon it was based on the discrimination between good and evil , also involve a discrimination between life and death ? Will it , I mean , point to any other life beyond this , or will it not ? Is whatever evil and sorrow we patiently suffer , a thing which , if it do not bring its reward to us here , will never bring us any reward at all ? And shall we call the death of the noble sufferer blessed for no other reason than that he rests from his labours and his works do not follow him ? ’
80030	80037	80039	80040	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Dear me ! dear me ! ’
80045	80073	80043	80043	himself	95	‘ These sort of questions ought never to be asked in that hard abrupt way . You ca n’t answer them — you ca n’t answer them . ’
80086	80091	80092	80092	he	110	‘ As to that , ’
80095	80238	80092	80092	he	110	‘ each man would think as he pleased , and his thoughts would shape themselves to meet the deepest needs of his life . In the state of society we long for , the belief in a future life would be open to all to accept or to reject . The only thing to guard against would be any definite public opinion on the matter , one way or the other ; for in any definite public opinion , remember , there is the germ of all dogmatism and of all persecution . Public opinion , in society as it ought to be , would be a frictionless fluid , if I may borrow a metaphor from science , in which no adventitious obstacle from prejudice or otherwise would impede the progress of any view that its own merits set in motion . ’
80291	80294	80295	80295	he	99	‘ True , ’
80298	80386	80295	80295	he	99	‘ that metaphor is ingenious , and explains exactly what we want to explain . That is one of the great conditions of a truly cultivated society , what Mr. Stockton calls a frictionless public opinion — a public opinion which shall let every system , every creed , every philosophy of life , stand or fall on its own practical verifiable merits ; and this we shall get , too , if we can only banish two things , prejudice and ignorance , of which last , ’
80398	80413	80387	80388	Mr. Luke	99	‘ by far the deadliest form is the fetish - worship of useless knowledge . ’
80414	80417	80419	80420	Miss Merton	93	‘ Well , ’
80422	80448	80419	80420	Miss Merton	93	‘ I suppose that this is all that any of us would ask , who really and truly believe in what we profess to believe . ’
80449	80455	80457	80458	Mr. Luke	99	‘ Of course it is , ’
80460	80463	80457	80458	Mr. Luke	99	‘ everything:—everything . ’

80893	81013	80892	80892	I	0	’m sure you ca n’t mean that . It seems to me one of the very worst things in these times that they will take us for their models . However , I think it is really a good deal our fault , and that it comes very much from our giving our maids so many of our old clothes to wear . That sort of thing puts notions into their heads . Now , here at any rate is one reform , that is implied in our Republic;—I do n’t like that word Republic , by the way — we must put a stop to all this imitation of ourselves . Is n’t that so , Mr. Laurence ? ’
81014	81021	81023	81024	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Thank you , Lady Ambrose , ’
81028	81115	81023	81024	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ thank you . I think it altogether a wise — nay , more than wise , an essential thing , to keep these wide speculations from spreading beyond the only circles that they are really fitted for . I have to go indoors now , as I have a few matters to arrange to - night ; but I am much obliged to you all for what you have taught me about culture , and enlightenment , and society , as it ought to be . ’
81116	81121	81123	81124	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ The difficulty is , ’

We long to see how it has fared with ourselves — our own selves — our characters . ” ’

81790	81804	81787	81788	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ it ’s a little dull . Turn over a page or two . ’

81848	82114	81828	81828	Laurence	83	‘ “ — those distant irrevocable days , when the world was all new to me , and each experience was fresh and delightful , and I knew nothing of what self - reproach could mean . Ah , me ! how times have changed since then ! I sometimes fancy that I am hardly worthy now to look back upon my own past . I was gifted naturally with a curious warmth and sincerity of nature , that must have been very beautiful . But my peculiar gift , my own own gift , was a power of sympathy with others , by which quite naturally I used to throw myself into their places , understand their difficulties , and excite myself with their interests . When I was yet quite a child , that , I know , is what men felt in me — I never cared for boys — one man especially . It was then that life began for me , and what it all meant broke on me like a revelation . I , in my simplicity , never dreamt of his being more than a friend — I am not sure even that he was my dearest friend . I certainly never tried to charm him . But I did charm him , nevertheless , quite unconsciously . And he loved me passionately , devotedly , child as I was . Ah , God ! when will another ever feel the same for me ? And I—‘O , my lost , my rejected friend ! come back to me ’

If it is so , if , indeed , it is so , surely I have brought it on myself . Was there not one — not my earliest lover — but another , who with a devotion I understood far more fully , laid himself at my feet , and offered me all his man ’s devotion , and his man ’s sympathy ! Why , why in my madness did I send him from me , penniless as he was — but what of that?—driving him to death , and leaving myself to desolation ? How does the image of his pale still face upturned towards the Indian star - light , with eyes which no star - light could ever touch any more , rise before me — his hand on his breast , and clasping with its last grasp a locket with my picture in it ! Yes , I see him there , though I did not see him . I know how he must have looked , with his heart bullet - pierced — noble , beautiful in death . Unworthy as I was of you , my true - hearted one , too late , too late , did I learn my own unworthiness . I was sitting in the window of our house at Ventnor , when the letter came that told me . It was evening ; and I had been looking out through the summer twilight at the sea and at the sunset . As I read the letter , it dropped from my hand . I gave a gasp . I repressed a shrill cry . I felt a choking sensation in my throat ; but I was very proud , and I even repressed a sob . I only , with entire calmness , turned my head towards the sea , and sighed a sigh deep - drawn as if my soul were in it . My cheek was pale , my eyes were wild and wistful — full of a solemn new earnestness . What the exact thoughts were that were busy in me , I can not tell . All I am conscious of was this , that far , far off were the great crimson spaces of evening sky and a trail of rippled splendour on the sea . One great violet cloud fringed with a border of living fire , that seemed to be eating into it , hung just above the place where the sun had gone down ; and over this , in a pale liquid solitude of hushed colour , was the evening star , trembling like a tear - drop . I was always sensitive to colour ; and somehow or other this sunset relieved me — went right to my heart with a quiet sense of healing . That evening was , I think , one of the great points in my life . I seemed ever after to see my own character more clearly — how deep were my own capacities for feeling , and also how strangely Nature could enter in and comfort me , when all human sympathy would have seemed intrusive . That night , when I went upstairs , I hardly knew myself . There was a wild look in my eyes — an inexpressible mournfulness and an inexpressible longing . Two or three long tendrils of hair had got loose , and hung over my forehead with a kind of wild languor . ‘

83273	83326	83255	83255	he	1473	’ , I gasped , turning away from the glass ; and , throwing myself on my knees by the bed , the sob I had so long suppressed broke forth , and I tried to pray — ” h’m — and so on , and so on , and so on — ’

You little dream what strange thoughts unbidden mix themselves up for me with the hymn - music ; what wild regrets , what bitter reveries , what strange scenes and figures , fill my mind as I kneel before the Communion - table . Why could I not have been content like you with a quiet lot , a toiling honest husband like you ? Is there not something holy , even in his dull sermons , if you only look on them in the lovely light of duty ? Why does my heart vibrate with the troubled wailing music of many sorrows , many longings , of which you do not even dream the existence ?

You have here , you see , that same modern sense of the blending together of the outer and inner worlds ; there is the same delicate discrimination between the aesthetic aspects of the different stages of life , and the nice gradation of moral colours : there is the same fine self - consciousness , and consequent endeavour to give tone and quality to her memories as they pass by her , in exquisite and complex ways . ’
84902	84905	84907	84907	Leslie	114	‘ Yes , ’
84919	85076	85077	85077	Leslie	114	‘ here , I think , is the crowning work of culture . It teaches each of us to look back upon his own life , with all its wants , its relations , and its possibilities , all its wasted hours and its affections trifled away or degraded — it teaches us to look back upon all this with quite a new kind of discrimination . The beauty of youth , with all its buoyancy and innocence , wakes in us of the modern world a more wistful and solemn regret ; we are more keenly alive to the pathos of failure ; to the sadness of the cold shadows that will often darken the whole inward landscape , and the ravage made by the storms that will sometimes break over it ; and to the gleams of sunshine fitfully reappearing , often only touching its distant wolds . And the charm of this is , ’
85086	85191	85077	85077	Leslie	114	‘ that however disastrous our lives may have been , whatever shipwreck we may have made of ourselves or others , let us only look back on this with the eyes of culture , whilst “ es wiederholt die Klage des Lebens labyrinthisch irren Lauf , ” and the whole retrospect becomes a delightful picture , the more impressive and suggestive from its landslips , its broken roads , and its waste places . I really think one is repaid for having made oneself quite lonely , and deserted , and friendless , by the pleasure one gets from contemplating one ’s own situation . ’
85192	85200	85202	85203	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I can not bear that man , ’
85208	85257	85258	85258	Laurence	83	‘ Did n’t you notice the nasty way in which all that was said ? But — good gracious , Mr. Laurence , what is that bell ringing for in the house ? Is that for us to leave off talking ? We have not half done yet . ’
85279	85289	85290	85290	he	83	‘ I do n’t know whether you ’ll mind , ’
85295	85325	85290	85290	he	83	‘ but our Rector is going to give us a little evening service . He proposed it this afternoon in the garden , and I could not well refuse . ’
85326	85330	85332	85333	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Mind it ! ’
85335	85341	85332	85333	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ I should think not . ’
85342	85345	85347	85348	Dr. Jenkinson	95	‘ Service ! ’
85351	85365	85366	85366	he	95	‘ yes , come and let us go to that . I think , ’
85373	85397	85398	85398	he	83	‘ that you will find the religion we have is the best for us at present . I think so . And Christianity , ’
85406	85419	85398	85398	he	83	‘ really embraces all religions , even any honest denial of itself . ’
85430	85432	85398	85398	he	83	‘ I ’m
85435	85442	85398	85398	he	83	’ said Mrs. Sinclair to Leslie , ‘
85445	85477	85398	85398	he	83	’re not of a very happy disposition . You do n’t look happy , somehow . And yet I think you might be , if you only tried . I suppose you ’re
85523	85530	85520	85520	you	1501	’ she added with a sigh , ‘

85602	85611	85594	85594	you	1501	’ said Lady Ambrose again to Miss Merton , ‘
85717	85728	85711	85711	you	892	’ Lady Ambrose added as they were entering the house , ‘
85747	85791	85742	85742	I	0	’ faces , I do confess , my dear , that I positively wish your religion was true ; for then they could all go into convents . One does n’t like those half - and - half Protestant things , you know . ’
85813	85819	85820	85820	he	102	‘ It is thrown away , ’
85823	85876	85820	85820	he	102	‘ my disproof of God ’s existence . The under - housemaid did it ! I am pleased to discover , however , that she previously read through a part ; so it has not perished , I trust , without emancipating one spirit . What ! are you all going indoors ? ’
85877	85880	85882	85883	Mr. Storks	113	‘ Yes , ’
85894	85905	85906	85906	he	102	‘ and you had better come too . Young man , ’
85915	85935	85906	85906	he	102	‘ you should never in this virulent way deny God ’s existence . What rational man believes in it ? ’
85936	85940	85942	85943	Mr. Rose	100	‘ before dinner , ’
85954	85989	85942	85943	Mr. Rose	100	‘ at the books in your uncle ’s pavilion in the garden ; and I saw there , in a closed case , a copy of the “ Cultes secrets des Dames Romaines . ” ’
85990	85993	85995	85995	Laurence	83	‘ Well ? ’
86000	86009	85995	85995	Laurence	83	‘ It has been locked up for years . ’
86010	86016	86018	86019	Mr. Rose	100	‘ I conceived as much , ’
86022	86045	86018	86019	Mr. Rose	100	‘ As you do not seem to set much store by the work , I will give you thirty pounds for it . ’
86463	86470	86472	86473	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Were n’t they read beautifully ! ’
86481	86496	86497	86497	she	92	‘ Oh , how glad I shall be to hear him preach once again ! ’
86660	86670	86671	86671	he	112	‘ A little while ago , in the garden , ’
86674	86733	86671	86671	he	112	‘ I confessed to our kind host , Mr. Laurence , that there were a few things that I should like quietly to say to you ; and Mr. Laurence has become sponsor for you all , and has promised , in your names , that you would suffer me to say them here . It is true , ’
86749	86832	86746	86746	his	112	‘ that when I look round me at this glittering semicircle , I begin to feel not a little shy of you , and to repent of my own temerity . You , however , have given me to - day so much good food for reflection , that I feel bound , in the commonest honesty , to make what poor return I can . So remember , that if I weary you , you have really brought it upon yourselves . ‘
87236	87569	87571	87572	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ Let me say in the first place , then , how profoundly right I consider the manner in which you set to work . For it is one of the most vital of all truths , that in a perfect state all the parts will be perfect ; and that if the highest classes be as good as they can be , so also will be all the other classes . And I want to tell you , in the next place , how entirely fair and lovely did all the elements seem to be , out of which you composed for your higher classes their ideal existence . For you gave them every outward grace that could adorn life , and every inward taste and emotion that could enrich it , and every species of intellectual activity that could stimulate it . Your society was indeed to be truly the crème de la crème : it was to be made beautiful , and profound , and brilliant , by lovers , and theologians , and wits , and men of science , and poets , and philosophers , and humourists — all men and women of the world , and fit to live in society , as well as to educate it . This would indeed be , as was said at dinner , Rome and Athens and Florence , at their best , and let me add Paris also , united and reanimated , and enriched by the possession of yet wider knowledge , and the possibilities of freer speculation . That truly is a dazzling picture . But even that is not all . There was your city itself too , of which a lovely glimpse was given us , with its groves , its gardens , its palaces , and its exquisite reproductions of the world ’s noblest architectures ; and all this under our softest English skies , and by our bluest English seas . Ah , ’
87582	87922	87571	87572	Mr. Herbert	112	‘ how I should like to live in a city like that ! I can literally see it now with my mind ’s eye , whilst I am talking . I see its private houses with their wonders of wrought marble ; I see its theatres , its museums , its chapels and churches of all denominations , its scientific lecture rooms , and its convents . For what strikes me more forcibly than anything is that all forms of faith and philosophy seem to find here an impartial home , and to unite in animating one harmonious social life . In fact , so vividly do I see this scene which your words have called up before me , that I want very much , if you will let me , to acid one small feature to it , myself . It is a very humble detail , this of mine . In the eyes of the men of science , who lead modern thought , it is simply a sanitary matter . It relates to the way in which you shall dispose of your dead . Now in this , at least , you will be surprised to hear I quite keep pace with the times , being a sincere advocate for cremation ; and what I should want to do in your city , would be to supply it with an establishment , hidden underground , where the bodies of the dead should be turned into gas , in properly devised retorts ; the gas from each body being received in a small separate gasometer . Above these gasworks , and amongst your fair towers and spires , and your superb institutions , and art - galleries , I would build a circular domed temple of umbred marble , blind and blank upon the face of it , without carved work , and without window ; only there should be written above the portal , not as in Dante ’s vision , Per me si va nell ’
88419	88425	88431	88431	his	112	‘ Do you deny it ? ’
88454	88460	88461	88461	he	112	‘ Do you deny it ? ’
88464	88789	88461	88461	he	112	‘ I tell you that it is so . I tell you too that that is your own case , and that in your Utopia you have aggravated the evil , and have not remedied it . You are all deniers or doubters , I tell you , every one of you . The deniers , I know , will not contradict me ; so at present I need not speak to them . It is to you — the majority , you who will contradict me ; you who are so busy with your various affirmations , with your prayers , your churches , your philosophies , your revivals of old Christianities , or your new improvements on them ; with your love of justice , and humanity , and toleration ; it is to you that I speak . It is to you that I say that , however enlightened and however sure you may be about all other matters , you are darkened and uncertain as to this — whether there really is any God at all who can hear all the prayers you utter to Him , or whether there really is any other life at all , where the aspirations you are so proud of will be realised , and where the wrongs you are so pitiful over will be righted . There is not one amongst you who , watching a dead friend , flickering for the last time before you in the form of a gas - flame , and seeing how a little while and this flame was with you , and again a little while and it was not with you , would be at all sure whether this was really because , as your hearts would suggest to you , it went to the Father , or because , as your men of science would assert to you , it went simply — out . ‘
88988	89003	89028	89028	I	0	’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert , his voice again rising , and quivering with excitement , ‘
89467	89663	89667	89667	I	0	‘ But enough of the poor ; enough of this division of happiness . Let me ask you to consider now what sort of happiness there is to divide — I say divide , meaning that you will get the whole of it . And as I have said before , this happiness is very fair in seeming . Knowledge , and culture , and freedom , and toleration — you have told us what fine things all these can do for you . And I admit it myself too ; I feel it myself too . Lovely , indeed , to look upon are the faiths , the philosophies , the enthusiasms of the world — the ancient products of the ages — as the sunshine of the modern intellect falls on them . See , they look clearer , and brighter , and more transparent — see , they form themselves into more exquisite and lucid shapes , more aërial structures . But why ? Do not deceive yourselves ; it is for a terrible reason . It is because , like a fabric of snow , they are one and all dissolving . ‘
90172	90517	90524	90524	you	1618	‘ What do you do then in this perplexity — this halting between two opinions ? Why , you do this . You try to persuade yourselves that neither opinion is of much moment — that the question can not be decided absolutely — that it should not be decided absolutely — in fact , that it is one of your chief glories that you leave it undecided . But I tell you , in that case , that though you say you are rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; you are , in reality , wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked . I am not casting my words at random . Again out of your own mouths will I judge you . All your culture , you say , is based ultimately upon this — a discrimination between right and wrong . True , profoundly true . But will you be able to say what is right and what is wrong any longer , if you do n’t know for whom anything is right and for whom anything is wrong — whether it is for men with immortal souls , or only with mortal bodies — who are only a little lower than the angels , or only a little better than the pigs ? Whilst you can still contrive to doubt upon this matter , whilst the fabric of the old faith is still dissolving only , life still for you , the enlightened few , may preserve what happiness it has now . But when the old fabric is all dissolved , what then ? When all divinity shall have gone from love and heroism , and only utility and pleasure shall be left , what then ? Then you will have to content yourselves with complete denial ; or build up again the faith that you have just pulled down — you will have to be born again , and to seek for a new Self . ‘
90786	91040	90764	90764	he	1626	‘ What will be left you then if this light be quenched ? Will art , will painting , will poetry be any comfort to you ? You have said that these were magic mirrors which reflected back your life for you . Well — will they be any better than the glass mirrors in your drawing - rooms , if they have nothing but the same listless orgy to reflect ? For that is all that will be at last in store for you ; nay , that is the best thing that possibly can be in store for you ; the only alternative being not a listless orgy for the few , but an undreamed of anarchy for all . I do not fear that , however . Some will be always strong , and some will be always weak ; and though , if there is no God , no divine and fatherly source of order , there will be , trust me , no aristocracies , there will still be tyrannies . There will still be rich and poor ; and that will then mean happy and miserable ; and the poor will be — as I sometimes think they are already — but a mass of groaning machinery , without even the semblance of rationality ; and the rich , with only the semblance of it , but a set of gaudy , dancing marionettes , which it is the machinery ’s one work to keep in motion . ‘
91177	91192	91194	91194	you	1627	’ cried Mr. Herbert , his voice rising into a kind of threatening wail , ‘
91340	91378	91299	91301	such a Father	1635	’ Mr. Herbert ’s voice ceased . The curtain fell . The whirlwind was over ; the fire was over ; and after the fire , from one of the side boxes came a still small voice . ‘
91387	91538	91299	91301	such a Father	1635	’ It was perceived that Dr. Jenkinson , having discovered almost immediately who was really to be the preacher , had stolen back silently into the theatre . THE following morning Miss Merton had risen early , and was sauntering slowly before breakfast up and down the broad terrace in front of the house . She inhaled the fresh delightful air ; she looked out over the breezy sea ; she scanned the splendid villa , now shining in the sunlight , with its marble porticoes , and its long rows of windows ; and she thought over yesterday with all its conversations and incidents . In especial , she thought of Laurence . She thought of him as he was now , and as he had been in former times , when they had known each other so well ; and as she thought of him , she sighed . ‘
91546	91552	91540	91540	he	1638	’ she said to herself , ‘
91657	91674	91675	91675	You	0	’ Whilst she was thus meditating , the subject of her meditations appeared upon the terrace . ‘
91680	91684	91675	91675	You	0	’ he said . ‘
91711	91712	91713	91713	You	0	’ ‘
91718	91724	91713	91713	You	0	’ said Miss Merton sympathetically . ‘
91731	91739	91713	91713	You	0	’ said Laurence , turning the subject . ‘
91900	91901	91893	91893	I	0	’ ‘
91904	91910	91893	91893	I	0	’ said Miss Merton thoughtfully , ‘
91925	91933	91923	91923	you	1654	’ she said , turning to Laurence , ‘
91944	91945	91923	91923	you	1654	’ ‘
91951	91955	91923	91923	you	1654	’ Laurence answered , ‘
91990	91993	91994	91994	he	0	’m sorry , ’
91997	92000	91994	91994	he	0	‘ that we ’re

92076	92082	92048	92048	I	0	’ asked Miss Merton quietly . ‘
92088	92092	92083	92083	I	0	’ said Laurence . ‘
92161	92188	92189	92189	I	0	’ There was a long pause . At last Miss Merton said with some embarrassment , stooping as she did so to smell a red geranium : ‘
92190	92214	92189	92189	I	0	’m sure I wish I could be of any use to you ; but really I do n’t quite see how I can . ’
92230	92250	92222	92222	Laurence	83	‘ I can not pray , because I do not believe in God . Will you pray for me ? ’
92265	92279	92280	92280	she	93	‘ I did last night , if you wish very much to know , ’
92294	92298	92300	92300	Laurence	83	‘ Did you ? ’
92306	92338	92339	92339	he	83	‘ Then , if you cared enough for me to do that , will you care enough for me to do something far better than praying for me ? Will you — ’
92348	92352	92339	92339	he	83	‘ will you — ’
92465	92471	92473	92474	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Well , Mr. Laurence , ’
92476	92534	92535	92535	she	92	‘ all pleasant things come to an end at last . But this visit to you has really been positively delightful . And now , you must be careful not to forget me — that we are expecting you in September in Gloucestershire , to take part in our private theatricals . By - the - by , ’
92546	92595	92596	92596	she	92	‘ I think I told you , did n’t I , how ill the poor Duchess of — — — had been last week , though she ’s better now , I am happy to hear this morning . Ham — tongue — pigeon - pie — omelette , ’
92608	92652	92653	92653	she	92	‘ why , amongst all this host of good things , I do n’t know really what to choose . Well , suppose , Mr. Laurence , you were to bring me just the little — least bit of omelette . My dear , ’
92667	92729	92653	92653	she	92	‘ what a dreadful blowing - up Mr. Herbert gave us last night , did n’t he ? Now that , you know , I think is all very well in a sermon , but in a lecture , where the things are supposed to be taken more or less literally , I think it is a little out of place . ’
92730	92737	92739	92739	Leslie	114	‘ Did you say just now , ’
92752	92763	92743	92743	himself	114	‘ that the Duchess of — — — was ill ? ’
92764	92777	92779	92780	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Oh , it was just something I was telling Mr. Laurence , ’
92783	92798	92779	92780	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ She ’s much better now , thank you . Do you know her ? ’
92799	92805	92807	92807	Leslie	114	‘ She ’s my aunt , ’
92841	92848	92849	92849	she	92	‘ You do n’t say so ! ’
92854	92930	92849	92849	she	92	‘ Why , of course you are . How stupid of me not to have found that out before . To be sure — you are the redoubtable Eton boy , who made such a dreadful commotion at Daleham by wanting to run away with the nursery governess . And to think that I have only discovered you at this last moment , when we are all of us going to say good - bye ! ’
92931	92942	92944	92945	a servant	2402	‘ Your carriage is at the door , my Lady , ’
92947	92950	92952	92953	Lady Ambrose	92	‘ Already ! ’
92955	92982	92983	92983	she	92	‘ How time flies ! Dr. Jenkinson , you and I are going to the train together , I believe . And now , Mr. Leslie , ’
92987	93059	92983	92983	she	92	‘ Mr. Laurence is coming to us , in September , for some private theatricals . I do n’t know if you do anything in that way yourself . But perhaps if you are in England , and have no better engagements , you will come with him . At any rate , if you wo n’t , please to remember I shall think it very ill - natured of you . ’
93060	93064	93066	93066	Leslie	114	‘ Thank you , ’
93070	93078	93066	93066	Leslie	114	‘ I am not ill - natured . ’
