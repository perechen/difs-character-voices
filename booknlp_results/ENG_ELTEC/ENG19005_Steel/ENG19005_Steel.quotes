0	32	34	37	a rather undersized Englishman	309	" Understand ! Of course you do n't . I do n't , though I 've been here two years . And what 's more , I do n't want to , "
126	136	137	137	he	309	" So long as we do n't understand them , "
141	222	137	137	he	309	" and they do n't understand us , we jog along the same path amicably , like -- well ! like the pilgrims to the ' Cradle of the Gods , ' and the telegraph - posts to the Adjutant General 's office up the road yonder -- and I 'll trouble you to cram more space than that between two earthly poles ! No ! It is when we begin to have glimmerings that the deuce and all comes in-- "
355	365	366	366	he	309	" There 's a nursery rhyme they taught me , "
369	446	366	366	he	309	" when my moral nature was at the mercy of any fool who chose to take an interest in it--'But if poor Pussy understood , she 'd be , indeed , a naughty creature ! ' It did n't run so consecutively , of course ; in fact ' creature ' rhymed to ' teach her'--but I learnt it that way . Children do that sort of thing a sight deal oftener than their elders think . "
491	521	447	459	The younger of the two men in uniform with whom he was walking	314	" I used to say , ' Six days shalt thy neighbour do all that thou hast to do , and the seventh day shalt thou do no manner-- ' "
522	528	530	532	his elder companion	317	" Shut up , Lance ! "
537	553	530	532	his elder companion	317	" It is a ripping excuse for your intolerable laziness , but I do n't believe-- "
554	561	563	564	Lance Carlyon	68	" Fact , I assure you , "
567	586	563	564	Lance Carlyon	68	" and considering I really thought that was the proper version for ten years of my life , I-- "
616	625	626	626	he	69	" Lordy ! It 's a queer world , "
630	686	626	626	he	69	" There is really no good in understanding most things . As for this place-- ! Great Scott ! What would happen if my fifteen hundred scoundrels , whom you saw digging like babes in the open just now , were to understand that I -- one Englishman in charge -- had virtually no force majeure-- "
687	695	705	705	his	71	" Do n't insult us , Dillon ! "
708	727	728	728	He	71	" Eshwara is a garrison town , remember , now ; I 'm commandant , and Carlyon 's staff-- "
870	874	876	877	the doctor	334	" Are you ? "
885	955	876	877	the doctor	334	" then I hope you 'll both forget the fact . We 've got on all right without you , hitherto . So if you 'll stick to marking out the Viceroy 's camp , and generally preparing the way of the Lord - sahib , I 'll be obliged to you . By the way , is he coming to open the canal on the 10th , really ? "
956	994	876	877	the doctor	334	" So they say . That is , if you are ready for the show by then . I believe he could put it off till the 11th or 12th . Dashwood said something to that effect . "
995	1017	876	877	the doctor	334	" Then Dashwood 's an ass . The 10th is bad enough . The place will be filling up even then . "
1018	1024	876	877	the doctor	334	" Filling up ! How ? "
1025	1169	876	877	the doctor	334	" Pilgrims . But on the 11th and 12th ! By George ! you should see them ! The ' Assyrians came down like a wolf on the fold , ' is nothing to it ; only these are the Hosts of the Lord , I suppose . And so Dashwood suggested the 11th or 12th -- the Vaisakh festival , did he ? Well , he is an ass ! But that 's always the way . We try to understand feelings , instead of trying to know facts . However , we shall be ready for the opening , never fear . Smith expects his C. S. I. over it , he says , and that 's enough guarantee . You know Smith , do n't you , Dering ? Walsall Smith -- I think his wife said she knew you . "
1170	1173	1174	1174	he	335	" Yes , "
1182	1198	1174	1174	he	335	" Mrs. Walsall Smith is a great friend of mine , a very great friend . "
1199	1209	1211	1211	Lance	68	" Jolly for you , having friends in Eshwara , "
1217	1232	1233	1233	he	335	" I suppose they are about the only people here , eh , doctor ? "
1287	1299	1301	1302	Dr. Dillon	69	" I beg your pardon -- people , did you say ? "
1308	1332	1333	1333	He	69	" Plenty of people , if you count padrés -- the place swarms with missions , you know . But if you mean polo-- "
1351	1394	1338	1339	Lance Carlyon	68	" Well ! there must be a lot of black partridge , and I expect there 's fish in the river . Besides , it 's an awfully picturesque place -- By Jove ! it is , Dering , is n't it ? "
1631	1638	2170	2170	He	69	" It is a gypsum detritus , "
1641	1794	2170	2170	He	69	doctor--"from the ' Cradle of the Gods'--the cave , you know , where the rivers rise . The pilgrims go , in fact , for this very stuff . Find it in the ice crannies , call it ' the clay of immortality , ' smear themselves with it , and then die happy , in hundreds , of pneumonia ! Those are the facts . I do n't profess to understand them ; and as I told you I do n't want to . It 's dangerous . As that cracked old Jesuit , Father Narâyan , admitted , with that unfathomable smile of his , when all the other parsons were at me for refusing to allow them access to a postulate or a catechumen , or someone of that sort , who was sent to my jail ' the Church has always admitted the value of invincible ignorance . ' "
1795	1799	1801	1802	Lance Carlyon	68	" Father Narâyan ! "
1805	1918	1801	1802	Lance Carlyon	68	" I suppose that 's the Father Ninian Bruce who has lived here fifty years , and has a sort of Begum in tow , a descendant of General Bonaventura 's , who was the Nawabs ' favourite . I want to see that old chap ; he must be a character . My grandmother , old Lady Carewe , used to tell me about him ; long yarns , though she had n't met him since she was in her teens in a convent at Rome , and he was father confessor , I suppose -- she 's a Holy Roman , you know , and was a desperate flirt too . "
1919	1924	1926	1927	Vincent Dering	71	" So am I , "
1930	1994	1926	1927	Vincent Dering	71	" I mean a Catholic -- at least my people are . So I can tell you one thing , Dillon ; Father Ninian is n't a Jesuit . I was talking about him at the Club , when I knew I was coming here , and Father Delamere was indignant at the idea -- said he was a disgrace to his cloth . "
2003	2043	1995	1996	George Dillon	69	" Did he , indeed ! I quite agree that he is , but I did n't think Delamere would have admitted the fact himself ! As for Pidar Narâyan , as the natives call him , he -- he-- "
2050	2055	2056	2056	he	69	" Bless the man , "
2066	2084	2056	2056	he	69	" he thinks he knows more about doctoring than I do , and the worst of it is-- "
2094	2169	2170	2170	He	69	wrinkle--"he does , in a way ; for the natives believe in him , and the ' saffron bag ' is the best of all remedies . You see , when he was younger , he used often to go with the pilgrims and try to pull some of the poor devils out of the fire -- or rather out of the snow -- for the ' Cradle of the Gods ' lies yonder . "
2187	2196	2198	2198	Lance	68	" Why do n't they smear themselves here ? "
2201	2237	2198	2198	Lance	68	" Why ? Because they do n't . Besides , there is n't much to come and go upon for a robe of righteousness here . Look ! the breeze is blowing it away already ! "
2325	2334	2336	2337	Vincent Dering	71	" An extra touch of pipe - clay ! "
2350	2405	2336	2337	Vincent Dering	71	" Well ! good - by , old chap . I shall see you again soon , for I shall be coming over to the Smiths ' pretty often , and I suppose your regiment of ruffians leaves you off duty sometimes . Carlyon , make Dillon an honourary member of the headquarters mess ! "
2432	2474	2411	2411	his	69	" Thanks . I 'm over pretty often at the Palace . Pidar Narâyan plays the fiddle , and the Begum,--as you call her,--Miss Laila Bonaventura , has a voice . Besides , Babylon -- I mean Eshwara -- amuses me . "
2475	2479	2481	2482	Captain Dering	71	" Why Babylon ? "
2503	2649	2490	2491	The doctor	334	" Means the same thing . Esh - dwarra -- or in another tongue , Bab - y - lon,--is ' the Gate of God , ' though Babylon stands for something else nowadays , does n't it ? That 's why I say it 's never any use to find out the meanings of things . They change so . Stick to facts ; they do n't . Well , ta - ta . I 'll see you to - morrow , most likely , at the Palace . They have a sort of concert - practice - afternoon on Wednesdays -- some of the Mission ladies sing jollily in parts -- and the old man is sure to ask you . He sets great store on his ward 's position ; besides , I told him you were a nailer at the piano . "
2657	2682	2650	2651	Vincent Dering	71	" The deuce you did ! My dear fellow , I could n't play hymn tunes to save my life . I shall refuse . "
2683	2686	2688	2689	Dr. Dillon	69	" Pity , "
2709	2729	2688	2689	Dr. Dillon	69	" for I heard Mrs. Smith say they wanted a good accompanist . She sings alto -- rather well . "
2730	2736	2738	2739	Captain Dering	71	" Oh , does she ? "
2965	2971	3007	3007	his	68	" Cradle of the Gods . "
2972	2979	2981	2981	Lance	68	" There must be fish here , "
2984	3002	3007	3007	his	68	" I 'll get out my rods to - morrow and try for a ' mahseer . ' "
3040	3060	3062	3063	Vincent Dering	71	" It wo n't be half bad , I expect -- for a time , at any - rate , "
3073	3092	3093	3093	he	68	" We will get up some fun while the camp is here , of course ; and after that-- "
3100	3117	3093	3093	he	68	greater--"we'll manage for the month or so we have to stop . At least I shall . "
3144	3151	3153	3156	a voice behind him	366	" I beg pardon , sir , "
3175	3197	3153	3156	a voice behind him	366	" but by dismounting here you will reach the Fort in a few minutes on foot . The road is longer . "
3235	3266	3267	3272	The man to whom he spoke	369	" Come along , Carlyon . I was forgetting that Roshan Khân is up to the ropes here . You belong to Eshwara , do n't you , risaldar sahib ? "
3324	3327	3328	3328	he	71	" Huzoor ! "
3331	3342	3343	3343	He	71	" We are connected with the late Nawab 's house . "
3387	3451	3452	3452	They	371	" I believe that means he is about the nearest relation left . The Colonel , I know , was n't sure about the wisdom of his coming here ; but then the Colonel is that sort . So I insisted . One wants somebody who can tell you things in a new place . What 's that , in there , Roshan ? "
3501	3521	3537	3538	Roshan Khân	89	" The palace garden , sir ; and that is the palace . There is no entrance this side . "
3522	3531	3537	3538	Roshan Khân	89	" The women 's apartments , I suppose ? "
3532	3535	3537	3538	Roshan Khân	89	" Huzoor , "
3542	3571	3537	3538	Roshan Khân	89	" The Miss Sahib lives there now , and the Padré has his chapel there too . The river runs along the side , and it is pleasant . "
3572	3577	3579	3579	Lance	68	" Pleasant and cool , "
3592	3611	3579	3579	Lance	68	" I 'd no idea it was so hot outside . By Jove ! what a quaint place . "
3761	3768	3770	3771	Vincent Dering	71	" That 's a big gun , "
3823	3826	3827	3827	he	71	" Sanskrit , "
3828	3851	3865	3865	he	71	said--"that stumps me ! it 's so confounded straight . Ah ! here it is in Persian too -- that 's better . "
3899	3951	3952	3952	He	71	" ' Teacher of religion , and instructor of souls ; ' that 's about a correct translation , is n't it , risaldar sahib ? Well ! I 'd back a Maxim against old Blunderbore as a missionary agent nowadays . Hullo ! they worship it still , do they ? "
4000	4024	3993	3993	he	95	" The idolators do that when they come to bathe ; and they give alms to the saint , when he is inside . "
4025	4028	4030	4031	Captain Dering	71	" Inside ! "
4033	4040	4030	4031	Captain Dering	71	" What ! Inside the gun ? "
4104	4110	4112	4113	Vincent Dering	71	" Make a ripping mop , "
4122	4126	4112	4113	Vincent Dering	71	" clean the gun nicely,"--then
4136	4159	4112	4113	Vincent Dering	71	hardened--"and by God ! I 'll make him . I 'm not going to have my guns worshipped ! eh , Roshan ? "
4160	4163	4165	4166	the Mahomedan	95	" Huzoor , "
5021	5030	5040	5042	an old pantaloon	448	" At Home for music on Wednesday afternoons , "
5295	5308	5310	5311	Vincent Dering	71	" I must have that old chap on paper before I leave , "
5313	5322	5310	5311	Vincent Dering	71	" he 's too good to be lost . "
5380	5412	5372	5372	Lance	68	" Opens on to the river , I expect ; jolly cool it must be in the hot weather ! By Jove ! those old sinners knew how to be comfortable . Hullo!"--he
5418	5435	5372	5372	Lance	68	horror--"I say , Dering ! I believe it 's a chapel . Yes ! it is ! "
5458	5485	5453	5454	Captain Dering	71	" Oh , come along , do , Carlyon ! I did n't promise to go to church ! Hymns are bad enough in all conscience . "
5500	5503	5504	5504	he	68	" Hush ! "
5511	5519	5504	5504	he	68	" I believe they are having service . "
5551	5574	5576	5577	Captain Dering	71	" Oh , come along , do ! there 's a good chap , and let 's get out of the way , "
5581	5660	5661	5661	He	71	" It 's Father Narâyan , I suppose,--he 's as mad as a hatter , and boshes the whole business -- at least , so Delamere said . I told you we were a bit early , but you would start ; still it 's too bad of the old man to have his chapel in the front hall ! Come along ! and let us wait in the garden -- it looks an awfully jolly one -- awfully-- "
5950	6016	5937	5938	Vincent Dering	71	" Ca n't you imagine it -- all lit up -- they used to put coloured lamps behind the cascades , I 'm told , and play ' Catch who can ' up and down and all around the place ! On the whole I expect they enjoyed themselves -- better than the type - writing girls of to - day do , for instance . "
6017	6034	6036	6036	Lance	68	" Got beastly sick of enjoying themselves before they had done with it , I expect , "
6040	6065	6066	6066	he	68	" especially if there was always such a confounded strong smell of orange blossoms . Bah ! I 'd prefer a polecat ; but , "
6075	6083	6066	6066	he	68	" I believe you like strong scents . "
6084	6088	6090	6091	Vincent Dering	71	" Why not ? "
6108	6115	6090	6091	Vincent Dering	71	" it 's a harmless taste , "
6133	6192	6193	6193	he	71	expression,--"so 's the other , in a way . It is n't altogether despicable to let yourself loose in Paradise without an arrière pensée of flaming swords . Especially if you can give pleasure to someone else thereby . One could act Romeo and Juliet nicely in this garden . And have your choice of balconies , too , "
6200	6206	6193	6193	he	71	" even if the young woman-- "
6489	6495	6496	6496	she	481	" I am Miss Bonaventura , "
6522	6558	6508	6508	she	481	" my guardian , Father Ninian Bruce , will be here directly . Wo n't you come upstairs to the drawing - room ? I am sorry we did not know it was so late . "
6559	6570	6573	6574	Captain Dering	71	" It is our fault ; we are disgracefully early , "
6576	6580	6582	6582	he	71	" I told Carlyon-- "
6599	6607	6608	6608	she	481	" Perhaps your watch is too fast , "
6611	6656	6608	6608	she	481	" and then my guardian likes to go by the sun . He says it never needs winding up . But I think it is inconvenient , when everybody else has a watch . It is always better to do as other people do . "
6763	6769	6775	6775	his	71	" What a charming place , "
6779	6792	6775	6775	his	71	" Does n't it remind you of the Arabian Nights , Carlyon ? "
6810	6818	6819	6819	she	481	" Have you read the Alif Laila ? "
6822	6909	6819	6819	she	481	" My moonshi brought it -- I have to learn Urdu , you know , because my guardian thinks I ought to be able to speak to the people , as he does -- and I wanted to read it , because it is my name , you see -- Laila -- it means ' night , ' I believe -- but my guardian did not wish it . He gave me the ' Mirror of Virtue ' instead . It is a very , very long-- "
6935	6976	6934	6934	her	481	indifference--"The other people will be here directly ; but they will come from the city , across the tunnel , and go straight into the drawing - room . Would you like to come in there , or stay here ? "
6977	6985	6987	6987	Vincent	71	" Oh ! stay here , please ! "
7000	7011	7013	7014	Miss Bonaventura	86	" Then perhaps you would like to try the piano ? "
7016	7041	7042	7042	Her	494	" My guardian has it brought out here on Wednesday afternoons , because it sounds well among the arches . Will you try it ? "
7082	7107	7113	7113	she	494	" Do , Dering . He is a nailer at the piano , I assure you , Miss Bonaventura , and he sings too . "
7108	7112	7113	7113	she	494	" So my guardian-- "
7275	7308	7309	7309	Vincent	71	" What funny words ; but I like them , and the tune too . What is it called ? I should like to get it and sing it to my guardian . "
7336	7349	7326	7326	his	71	" You know Italian very well , I suppose , Miss Bonaventura ? "
7357	7409	7410	7410	She	494	" My guardian and I speak it . He loves Italy and the Italians . He knew my grandmother there . She was a princess ; but he never speaks of her , so I do n't know very much about it . Only Mother at the convent said that my guardian-- "
7440	7446	7447	7447	she	494	" There is my guardian , "
7450	7461	7447	7447	she	494	" he is very sorry to have kept you waiting . "
7637	7650	7651	7651	he	500	" I hope my little girl has been doing the honours properly , "
7725	7751	7758	7758	he	500	forbearance--"but she is only just back from school at Calcutta , and the good nuns did not see much company , did they , Laila ? "
7764	7775	7758	7758	he	500	" Didst tell them , cara mia?--didst remember it all ? "
7786	7793	7794	7794	she	86	" I think so , guardian , "
7800	7805	7794	7794	she	86	" Did n't I ? "
7866	7881	7882	7882	he	500	" I say , that girl has got splendid hair , has n't she ? "
7902	7941	7942	7942	He	500	" That tall one , you mean -- don't admire it . Puts me in mind of that devil of a chestnut who nearly killed me at polo ; a chestnut with white stockings ; awfully handy , but-- "
7952	7967	7969	7971	the old man	3483	" You can scarcely know any of your neighbours as yet , Captain Dering , "
7980	8000	7969	7971	the old man	3483	" so perhaps you will give me the privilege of presenting you to some of our good mission ladies . "
8001	8004	8006	8006	Vincent	71	" Thanks , "
8010	8038	8039	8039	Lance	68	" But I see my old friend , Mrs. Walsall Smith , coming in . I must just go and shake hands . But I 'm sure Carlyon-- "
8094	8101	8103	8103	Lance	68	" Delighted , I 'm sure , "
8110	8128	8103	8103	Lance	68	" Miss Erda Shepherd , Mr. Lancelot -- I am right , am I not -- Carlyon ? "
8209	8218	8219	8219	he	81	" I hope you will like each other , "
8247	8256	8257	8257	he	81	" Peace go with you , my children , "
8333	8348	8328	8328	him	68	" That was rather a jolly way of beginning to be friends . I mean-- "
8361	8364	8367	8368	the girl	481	" Very , "
8375	8395	8367	8368	the girl	481	" I hope it will be peace . I always hope that . You know I am a missionary . "
8396	8399	8400	8400	he	68	" Oh , "
8405	8428	8400	8400	he	68	" Yes , there are a lot of you -- I mean -- of them , in Eshwara , are n't there ? "
8440	8451	8452	8452	she	481	" Not enough , Mr. Carlyon ; not half enough , "
8490	8500	8501	8501	she	481	" If you knew Eshwara as I know it , "
8507	8520	8501	8501	she	481	" you would say so too ; I 'm sure you would . "
8575	8578	8579	8579	she	481	" Look ! "
8584	8662	8579	8579	she	481	" Do you see that straight white thing floating down the curve of the current yonder ? It is n't a log ; those others are ; plenty of logs come down the rivers from the forests in the hills , for they do n't catch all , you know , at the government wood - station . And so the people here catch the runaways in the backwater , and get paid for them . But that-- "
8685	8722	8675	8675	she	481	" Why should I bother you ? Let us talk of something else . There is no reason why I should talk of these things to you so soon , or , indeed , at all . "
8723	8730	8731	8731	he	68	" I 'd rather you did , "
8774	8782	8783	8783	he	68	" I -- I hope you will , "
8786	8794	8783	8783	he	68	" really I do -- I -- I-- "
8845	8859	8860	8860	he	68	" You and I must be about the same age , I expect , "
8870	8891	8860	8860	he	68	" but you have seen a lot more than I have . I wish you 'd tell me , please ! "
8922	8932	8933	8933	she	524	" It is a dead girl , Mr. Carlyon , "
8940	9000	8933	8933	she	524	" She was in my school . Her people were very bigoted -- Brahmins in a temple -- but they let her be taught to read , because she was betrothed to an educated man . Last year she was married -- she was but a child still -- and I have only seen her once or twice since . Then"--the
9006	9150	9151	9151	she	527	" She was very frightened , poor little Premi , at what was coming . ' I shall die , Miss - sahib , I shall surely die , ' she said to me the very last time I saw her ; so I promised -- I am a medical missionary , Mr. Carlyon . But when the time came , they would not let me in . I -- I went to the husband -- he is an educated man -- you may have heard of him -- Rama - nund , a great speaker,--he writes , too , and all that -- but he said he was helpless with the women ; and I am not sure either if he wished it himself -- they do n't know their own minds . So poor little Premi and her baby -- Oh ! "
9160	9170	9171	9171	Her	527	voice--"it is so hard -- so hard for both . "
9267	9321	9322	9322	She	531	" She was ill all yesterday and the day before -- they told me there was no hope of either -- they just let them die . And they always put them in the river -- they have iron rings round their wrists and ankles to prevent them coming back to harm the men-- "
9330	9352	9322	9322	She	531	" Is n't it true that there are not enough of us -- that we want more women to teach them what-- "
9353	9358	9322	9322	She	531	" But I does ! "
9376	9416	9322	9322	She	531	" I ' ikes ' oo twenty ' fowsand times better than dad , an ' I ' ikes Captain Dering ten ' fowsand times better too ; an ' so does ' mum -- don't ' oo mummie ? "
9537	9573	9531	9532	Dr. Dillon	69	" And you like Akbar Khân better than any of us , you young sinner , because he gives you sweeties ! Here ! Akbar Khân , bring the Missy - baba some cream toffee ! "
9614	9623	9625	9628	Protector of the Poor	537	" Ger - reeb -- pun - wâz ! "
9644	9662	9663	9663	she	109	" But I do n't ' ike Akbar Khân . Do I , son of an owl ? "
9680	9738	9739	9739	She	109	" Did I not say I would hate thee because thou wouldst not tell me why thou didst prostrate thyself before the soldier in the courtyard ? And the ayah laughed , the base - born ! She knew also , and would not say , and so did the soldier ; so I hate you all ! "
9751	9754	9756	9757	her mother	514	" Gladys ! "
9761	9770	9772	9773	Captain Dering	71	" Hullo ! What 's all this about ? "
9783	9795	9796	9796	He	71	" One of my soldiers insulting you ? Who was it ? "
9836	9845	9847	9848	Father Ninian	81	" Who was it , Khân - jee ? "
9918	9921	9907	9907	he	81	" well acquaint "
9995	9999	10000	10000	he	81	" Roshan Khân , "
10003	10009	10000	10000	he	81	" why comes he here ? "
10020	10043	10014	10014	he	81	" Of course , he comes with you . I knew he was in your regiment , but I did not think . "
10052	10060	10061	10061	he	71	" Is there any reason , sir , "
10065	10075	10061	10061	he	71	" why he should not be here ? If so-- "
10093	10096	10097	10097	he	81	" No ! "
10110	10136	10097	10097	he	81	" none . He is welcome to come if he likes . He is a fine soldier , Captain Dering , and a good fencer . "
10137	10146	10149	10150	Lance Carlyon	68	" The best I have ever come across , "
10193	10199	10200	10200	he	81	" His master thanks you , "
10204	10234	10200	10200	he	81	" I taught him ; but as Esmond said of the botte de Jesuit -- not all . We craftsmen keep something up our sleeve for our own use ! "
10259	10288	10242	10242	He	68	" That 's what Roshan does to me . I took lessons from him , but he licks my head off with tricks . Perhaps some day , sir-- "
10307	10316	10317	10317	he	81	" Of a surety ! Of a surety , "
10329	10356	10317	10317	he	81	" and I will teach you ' L'Addio del Marito . ' I never taught that to Roshan -- it does not do for savage natures . "
10357	10370	10372	10372	Laila	86	" The husband 's good - by ! What a funny name , "
10376	10385	10372	10372	Laila	86	" Why is it called that , guardian ? "
10395	10405	10406	10406	he	81	" Because the thrust is used , cara mia , "
10421	10441	10419	10419	himself	81	" when even those who have that greatest tie to life prefer to say good - by to it . "
10450	10472	10442	10442	He	81	" But come ! Music ! Music ! We lose time horribly . Laila , ' tis your part to begin . "
10481	10489	10490	10490	she	481	" What shall I sing , guardian ? "
10493	10496	10497	10497	he	81	" Sing ? "
10517	10539	10507	10507	his	81	" sing my favourite , child . Something hath taken me back to the old days -- and sing it well . "
10588	10593	10594	10594	she	481	" If you can , "
10602	10609	10599	10599	He	81	" What is it ? Oh!--Handel . "
10615	10631	10612	10612	his	81	" Yes ! I fancy I can play him -- he is not very complex . "
10680	10690	10658	10658	his	81	" He shall feed His flock like a Shepherd . "
10808	10816	10797	10797	women	479	" They are singing in the palace . "
10862	10866	10857	10860	Some of the audience	565	" Thank you , "
10924	10930	10921	10921	he	81	" Who taught her that ? "
10940	10959	10931	10933	The old man	3483	" I heard her grandmother sing it , nearly sixty years ago . I have never forgotten it . "
10960	10966	10968	10969	Vincent Dering	71	" I do not wonder , "
11815	11873	11805	11805	he	117	" Not a cowrie less , Khân - jee . ' Tis the only one in the market , see you ; besides on this day the ' Missen ' miss comes to us folk , and she never haggles . She will pay the five annas gladly to be let read her book to my women . "
12055	12063	12044	12044	He	110	" Everything grows dearer , every day , "
12071	12080	12065	12069	the aboriginal Gu - gu	117	" Even women , as thou shouldst know . "
12088	12113	12081	12082	Akbar Khân	110	" We spread no nets for that game in the palace nowadays . Those evil times are gone ; we live sober and virtuous . "
12123	12129	12131	12133	Gu - gu	117	" And as for fish , "
12135	12180	12181	12181	He	117	" they will be dearer ere they are cheaper . When the deep water begins to run canalwards , the fish will run too . Then good - by to our trade , since the Huzoors allow us nothing in their waters without payment . "
12213	12218	12219	12219	he	117	" Neither did we , "
12224	12267	12219	12219	he	117	" Thy like , Gu - gu , would have had to bring thy fish to the palace and be satisfied with our leavings . Out on thee for an upstart ! Take thy four annas , and be thankful -- slave ! "
12279	12316	12268	12270	Gu - gu	117	" Not I!--the Miss will give it ; nay ! six , mayhap , since the child is sick , and she will be wanting leave to dose it . So -- hands off -- eunuch ! "
12378	12385	12386	12386	he	110	" Oh ! for the bastinado ! "
12391	12456	12386	12386	he	110	" Oh , for the cutting off of bodily members ! Oh ! even , for the tying up of heels , and roastings and duckings . But the Huzoors have taken them from us , and gifted them to the police , who know not the proper methods . Yâh ! Gu - gu , had I but had thee fifty years ago ! "
12465	12500	12386	12386	he	110	" Fifty years ago when the Nawab gifted me as body - servant to the new Wazeer Bun - avatâr[1]-sahib because he brought him a bird that would sing of itself from Italy wilayat . "
12501	12508	12509	12512	cavilled Gu - gu	117	" But all birds do that , "
12532	12620	12524	12524	Akbar	110	" Not palace birds ! they have to be wound up ; and Bun - avatâr - sahib sent for this across the black water . So he kept favour with the Nawab . Birds that sing , and flowers that smell , and boxes that make music , and dolls that dance when you wind them . Lo ! these , Gu - gu , are the pleasures of palaces ; but how canst thou know , who hast not lived in them even , as I-- "
12657	12664	12665	12665	he	110	" Yea ! those were times , "
12671	12713	12665	12665	he	110	" Even Pidar Narâyan -- may Heaven protect him -- could not say ' please God ' to every mouthful , as he does now -- as we all do now , and rightly , seeing that we have grown old . "
12738	12791	12723	12725	the old man	3483	" Look you ! he had to walk like the tongue among thirty - two teeth in those days , with Bun - avatâr - sahib , my master , like two peas in one pod with the Nawah . Except for women . Pidar Narâyan took his way there -- mostly ! "
12829	12941	12946	12946	he	638	" He had the money - bags , you see , and looked after the rents . But my master , Bun - avatâr -- lo ! thou shouldst have seen him when he came first -- the picture of a man!--they say he was a prince in his own country , but fell into trouble ; so came to make his fortune here with Pidar Narâyan -- was called Wazeer . And let me tell thee , Gu - gu , it means something to be body - servant to a Wazeer ! Lo ! to think I might have been it still but for that jade , Anâri Begum ! "
12961	12972	12973	12973	he	638	" As ill to keep within walls as a butterfly ! "
12976	13241	12973	12973	he	638	" Up and down the garden , in and out the balconies , and the Nawab in two minds to use force , or put her in a sack . For she flouted him . The prettiest ones play that game for power always , and she was Walidâd , her brother 's , last hope of favour . Walidâd , Kanjara , who had been king 's caterer for years before my master , Bun - avatâr - sahib , came to make all the court cry sour buttermilk ! Walidâd , who had once stood so high , that , in a drunken bout , the Nawab promised him his half - sister to wife . And he got her too ! She wept on her wedding day , but we in the lower storey heeded not tears in the upper . For , see you , mine uncle was chief eunuch -- we kept the honour thus in the family from generation to generation -- so I was in and out , seeing what went on . Until somehow ( mine uncle with the bowstring round his neck -- as was right , honest man -- swore he knew not how ) Bun - avatâr - sahib caught a sight of her ! Some say it was a plot , from beginning to end , of Walidâd 's ; others that his enemies feared lest Anâri should succeed . There be balls within balls , even in a plaything , if the workmen are cunning ! Anyhow , he saw her . "
13384	13400	13381	13381	he	639	" The chuckle of his pipe was fiendish , yet his wizened face was wistful . "
13539	13540	13541	13541	They	660	" "
13551	13575	13541	13541	They	660	" asked Gu - gu . It was a point in the oft - told tale which was still discussed by Eshwara gossips . "
13586	13592	13578	13579	other folks	662	" replied Akbar , discreetly . "
13787	13788	13796	13796	his	89	" "
13798	13804	13791	13792	Roshan Khân	89	" sneered Gu - gu . "
13847	13848	13831	13831	eunuch	685	" "
13856	13862	13831	13831	eunuch	685	" stuttered the old retainer . "
13945	15054	13933	13933	I	0	" He moved away muttering , full of virtuous resentment that a suspicion of anything save sheer servility should have been imputed to him . After a lifetime of trucklings and bootblackings , to be credited with higher motives was too bad . To prove his innocence he would that very evening , he told himself , seek out Roshan , not at the Fort,--that might be misunderstood,--but at his grandmother 's . His grandmother , who , though she had been upstart Walidâd 's wife , was still the late Nawab 's half - sister ! His sister ! ! What could be nearer than that ! ! ! And he would prostrate himself again , and assure the family of his services . That was his birthright . Meanwhile Gu - gu looked after him , and laughed . He was a clever fellow , was Gu - gu , and in a previous generation of scholars had been pet pupil in a little school started by another Miss from another Missen . He had got pennies for attending it , which had come in useful before he was big enough to face the river . But now he was the best man on either the Hara or the Hari , save one . And he ? Gu - gu 's beady black eyes , watching the curve of the current mechanically , gave a sudden flash . He was on his feet in a second . There was something dipping , diving , sidling , drifting , out yonder which might be secured for his wigwam before anyone else saw it ! But as , silently , like a seal 's , his black head came up from his first forge under water which was to give him a fair start from the shore without even a splash to attract notice , another black head showed to the right of him , a yard or two behind . But it was his head ! Am - ma 's head ! Am - ma , the frog - like , Am - ma , whose wide hands and feet looked as if webbed in the water . Am - ma , the only man who could touch him . He set his teeth , gave up silence , and surged ahead with an overhand stroke , his hand seeming to clutch and hold the water . It was a faster stroke than Am - ma 's ; for a time the swifter . Then with a backward glance he drew a quick breath , knowing it would be a race indeed , for the black head had gone , and only a faint wale on the smooth water told where his rival , avoiding the slight resistance of the air , swam like a fish . Dangerous tactics for most men , ending often in a sudden collapse , bleedings from nose and ears , or , at least , time lost in coming to the surface . But Am - ma was not as other men . Half - witted , except in river lore , uncouth , misshapen , he was practically amphibious . Gu - gu ground his teeth impotently as the faint wale crept up and up . The man must have air in his stomach like a fish ! Ah ! if the river had been in flood , if this had been a race with air bladders , indeed,--one black head of inflated skin under each arm , and your own in the middle -- the issue would have been certain ; for no one , in the whole tribe , knew the backward rip of a knife from below which would leave a rival helpless , lopsided , bound to seek safety on shore , so well as Gu - gu ! But it was not flood time , so he must risk all . Like a porpoise at play the curve of his dark back disappeared , and now there were two wales upon the water side by side . And ahead , sidling , dipping , diving to the current was a deodar log with the broad arrow of government on it , now visible , now out of sight . It was a question of steering ; steering without eyes , steering by instinct , steering by sheer experience of logs and their ways , of the meeting currents of the two rivers and their ways . And over against them , to the right across the broad lagoon , were low brick buildings , and a horde of fifteen hundred ruffians with fascines and earth - baskets finishing a dam that was to alter the currents , and protect the canal ! They looked like swarming ants in the sunshine . The wales were neck and neck now , side by side , straight as a die on the log . Then suddenly , the right - hand one swerved outward . Only a yard or two ; a yard or two nearer to the ants in the sunshine . A second after the log swerved also -- swerved to the right . The next , two black heads rose silently ; but one of them was two yards to the left of that dancing , dipping prize ! Gu - gu , breathless as he was , gave an inarticulate cry of rage , and shook his fist at the swarming ants . Already their work was altering the currents he had known for so long . That it was possible to allow for this , as Am - ma had done , did not comfort him . He swam back sulkily , his wrath increased by the knowledge one glance had given him , that the log on which his rival was paddling to shore triumphantly bore its broad arrow so lightly , and so near its end , that a little dexterous manipulation would have left the runaway unmarked , and so given its captor the right , not merely of ransom , but of sale ! Truly , it was an ill world for the poor ! But Lance Carlyon laughed , as he lounged over his early tea and watched the river through his field - glass , in a balcony of the fort , dressed in a gorgeous ring - streaked sleeping suit which he could only wear when on outpost duty , as the regiment had tabooed it . In truth it made him not unlike Tom Sawyer 's "
15058	15059	15055	15056	Royal Nonsuch	133	" "
15090	15147	15087	15087	you	71	" His eyes rested , as he spoke , on the low , bastioned building , all hemmed in by temple spires , at the very point of the city 's triangle , which Erda Shepherd had told him was the mission house . Truly , he thought , she was in the thick of it ! "
15150	15156	15087	15087	you	71	" echoed Vincent Dering captiously , "
15177	15178	15164	15164	I	0	" "
15184	15197	15164	15164	I	0	" Vincent nodded towards the palace with an odd , cynical laugh . "
15212	15217	15218	15218	I	0	" Lance turned curiously . "
15321	15327	15316	15319	the Lord - sahib	3420	" Vincent Dering laughed boisterously . "
15389	15681	15376	15377	Mrs. Smith	75	" Ten minutes afterwards they were riding over the boat bridge to superintend the laying out of the Vice - regal camp against the coming of the Lord - sahib and his hosts . Mumtâza Mahal , Roshan Khân 's grandmother , lived in a queer little backwater of a house which had eddied itself away from the main stream of the town , and jammed itself against a wall of the palace as if seeking dignity thereby . For all that it belonged irredeemably to the city , and to its evil - smelling lanes . The word house , however , is misleading to western ears , since this was simply a well - like courtyard , with a great wooden bed set in the centre under a miserable attempt at a tree which was used as a clothes - peg , a rack for saucepans , and a variety of other domestic purposes . It fulfilled them to the perfect satisfaction of its proprietress , a roundabout old lady , plump as a button - quail , who , when she was not asleep inside the arcaded slip of a room on one side , passed her time on the bed in the scanty shade , keeping company with a sausage - roll of a pillow and a quilt , both covered in faded , greasy silk . As a rule she did nothing save eat pân ; though sometimes , as a favour to Erda Shepherd , who came to read to her once a week , she would give a few more stitches to a knitted comforter which never seemed to get any longer . It had been begun , indeed , under the auspices of another "
15684	15789	15376	15377	Mrs. Smith	75	" who had returned to England only to die , as so many do , from exposure , and overwork , and homesickness . For the rest , Mumtâza was an arrogant , yet good - natured old soul , who , despite those tears on her wedding - day , had kept dissolute Walidâd under her thumb , and his son also . Therefore , it was one of her pet grievances -- and she had many -- that Roshan , her grandson , should have defied her authority and entered the army . The great standing grievance , however , was that the "
15791	16380	15376	15377	Mrs. Smith	75	" she received from Government because her husband had been deported with the Nawab to Calcutta , was not so large as one received by a neighbour and gossip whose husband had been hanged in the mutiny ! The two old ladies came to loggerheads over their respective claims once a month , regularly , when pay - day came round ; Mumtâza asserting shrilly that to die in a strange country was more painful than hanging , Ashrâf - un - nissa contending roundly that if Walidâd had had as much respectful affection for his widow as her husband had had for his , he could easily have caused himself to be hanged ; since he had certainly deserved it . Whereat there would be war , until some one in the alley , or round the corner did something outrageous,--threw slops over some one , or had twins , or imported a new mother - in - law ! Then , friendly discussion becoming a necessity of life , the big wooden bed would once more hold two old ladies , two roly - poly bolsters , two quilts -- also two tongues ! But these confined themselves , for a time , to lesser grievances ; such as the general decadence of the age , manifested by the reluctance of young people to obey the old . There was , however , no sign of displeasure in the reception prepared for Roshan , when one afternoon , immediately after his arrival at Eshwara , he appeared to prostrate himself at the feet of age ; at least so he had said in his letter of intimation . Mumtâza Mahal knew her duty towards men - folk better than to show temper at once ; knew also the suffocating effect of ceremonials . So the tarnished treasures of past state had been dug out of the mounds of litter heaped up in all four corners of the arcaded room , and set about the courtyard . An old elephant - housing covered the wooden bed , and to it Roshan was conducted : his grandmother , despite her best green satin trousers , squatting below , on a mat . The young soldier felt and looked thoroughly uncomfortable . Out of sheer funk of the old lady 's remarks if he had appeared in his usual mufti of English tweed and a close - fitting turban , he had reverted to the airy muslins and embroidered smoking - caps of his forbears . He felt chilly , barely decent in them ; and , indeed , the whole environment was absolutely repugnant to him . His grandmother 's tramways could scarcely be otherwise to one who had gone ahead by express train like Roshan Khân . Thoroughly well - educated , he knew himself to be considered one of the smartest native officers in the army . A first - class polo player , a fair cricketer , able to handle cue and racket , and without equal at the foils , he had for years met Englishmen on equal terms in sporting matters . What wonder , then , that he sat looking inexpressibly bored beside the hookah which was the pride of his grandmamma 's heart , in that it had belonged to many dead and gone Nawabs ? He was simply longing for the solace of a smoke , yet he did not dare to use the silver cigarette case with his initials , "
16382	16615	15376	15377	Mrs. Smith	75	" on it , which Lance Carlyon had given him at Christmas in return for the fencing lessons . Fortunately , however , boredom and yawns are correct during visits of ceremony , so Mumtâza Mahal crossed her little fat hands over her little fat green - trousered legs , and told herself the lad was improved in both manners and looks ; was distinctly more like her brother , the late and sainted Nawab . The fact emphasized her regret that , after a brilliant career in a mission school , a career which must have led to a minor clerkship , her grandson should have taken the unheard - of course of entering the army ! If he could even have gone as the Nawab 's grand - nephew , with a dozen troopers or so as following , it might have been bearable ; but , as Walidâd 's extraction barred all claim to noble descent , enlistment meant something very different . The old lady , accustomed to obedience all round , when the dreadful defiance had occurred , ten years before , had called the stars to witness that it was all -- that everything was -- Pidar Narâyan 's fault ! And then she had fallen a - whimpering , knowing right well that but for the latter 's intercession , she herself would have had no "
16617	16988	15376	15377	Mrs. Smith	75	" ; since Government bars those who can be proved to be personally implicated in evil doings . And now , as she sat looking at her grandson , the same conflicting estimates made her irritable . Why had Pidar Narâyan ever put his finger in the Eshwara pie ? Yet , without him , where would they all have been ? Still , he need not have taught the lad to fence , and so turned him into a mean , common soldier . Now , whether this was true , whether his skill with the foils had turned Roshan 's thoughts towards a fighting life , or whether it was simply the result of natural aptitudes that way , the choice of professions had been wise . His Colonel,--of the old school though he was,--had admitted , when pressed , that the young Mahomedan , given practice , might be able to lead the regiment as well as a fresh - joined English subaltern . The newer school , again , playing the Krieg spiel against him at Simla , and finding itself in grips with a genuine gift for tactics , had shaken its head and confessed the hardship of such a talent being barred from finding its proper level . Still it was impossible to legislate for exceptions without upsetting the every - day army apple - cart . Roshan himself , being sensible -- above all , being of a nation which accepts limitations as a law of God -- was , as a rule , satisfied with his future risaldar majorship , and , if he was lucky , Aide - de - Camp to the Queen , and a few other titles tacked on to it . Like all natives of India he lived largely on the approbation of his immediate superiors , and this he had without stint ; besides , his whole line of thought had become too military for any subversion of rule and discipline to seem desirable . Yet the curb made itself felt sometimes ; never more keenly than at his grandmother 's scornful look , when , in reply to her catechising , he named his income . "
17001	17002	16998	16999	a coolie	705	" "
17013	17018	17020	17020	I	0	" he replied sulkily , "
17029	17043	17020	17020	I	0	" She waggled her be - veiled , be - jewelled head cunningly . "
17117	17162	17106	17107	The Huzoors	118	" Roshan did not attempt explanation ; he simply evaded the point by asserting that the pay was sufficient for his wants . In a way it was an unfortunate remark , since it precipitated the lecture lurking in the old lady 's mind . "
17173	17193	17165	17166	the wife	711	" she asked , not without dignity,--the dignity of age reminding youth that its turn for duty has come . "
17219	17262	17217	17217	Roshan	89	" He had his answer ready ; one that had hitherto baulked even the matrimonial desires of his mother , who , having gone to live with her own people , was backed up by sisters and sisters - in - law . "
17274	17393	17217	17217	Roshan	89	" It was true . The wife found for him as a boy had died in child - birth . But Mumtâza had made up her mind to refuse this excuse any longer . Matters were getting desperate . Here was Roshan past thirty , and never a child 's voice to soothe the passion which seems to come back , vicariously , to Indian women in their old age . She had been brooding over an appeal ever since she had heard that , after ten years ' absence , the lad was once more to be within reach of her tongue . So she edged closer to him , an almost pathetic authority in her face . "
17443	17454	17455	17455	I	0	" she continued , in sudden alarm at his look . "
17568	17582	17583	17583	thee	718	thee,"--she looked round quickly , to be certain of privacy , then leant closer still,--"with
17595	17596	17597	17598	My cousin	731	" "
17600	17605	17597	17598	My cousin	731	" he echoed stupidly . "
17618	17626	17608	17609	thy cousin	730	" she repeated , with faint scorn . "
17658	17749	17750	17750	Thou	740	" He had known these facts before , of course , but they had never presented themselves to him in this connection . Yet they came instantly , accredited by custom . His cousin ; if so , his wife , if he chose , almost by right . And yet from custom also , he -- too sensible not to have gauged the vast difference between his position as regards Englishmen , and his position as regarded their wives , sisters , mothers -- was conscious of distinct revolt . "
17757	17763	17764	17765	the Miss	741	" he exclaimed almost angrily ; "
17768	17769	17764	17765	the Miss	741	" "
17775	17783	17764	17765	the Miss	741	" interrupted Mumtâza with a forced giggle . "
17795	17796	17792	17793	Pidar Narâyan	84	" "
17799	17804	17805	17805	Her	742	" asked Roshan coldly . "
17836	17865	17833	17834	the Nawab	3674	" An expression of infinite cunning crossed the old lady 's face ; she tucked another budget of pân into her cheek , preparatory to a lengthy explanation . "
18118	18279	18286	18286	grandmother	760	" Roshan Khân stood up feeling as if he was being suffocated . It was ten years since he had had experience of the fine - drawn meshes of vague , almost useless , conspiracy for which Indian women have such vast capability ; it was ten years since , with eyes open to his own advantage , he had cast in his lot loyally with the Government he served . In that time there had not been wanting -- there never is in India -- others , less scrupulous , ready to trade on his connection with a dispossessed family , and his possible sense of injustice . He had known how to treat them . But this idea bit shrewdly at a feeling which men of his stamp have inevitably -- the desire for a wife more suitable to their own culture than they can hope to find among their own people . He gave an uneasy laugh . "
18294	18295	18296	18297	Pidar Narâyan	84	" "
18302	18309	18299	18300	Pidar Narâyan	84	" echoed the old diplomatist tartly , "
18325	18339	18315	18315	thou	761	" Then she suddenly clapped her hands together in absolute impatience and anger . "
18387	18398	18382	18382	his	136	" A quick frown came to her hearer 's face . "
18429	18438	18425	18425	him	136	" Roshan 's sudden fierceness died down to sombre discontent--"but
18459	18514	18522	18522	Roshan	89	" He drew himself up proudly ; yet he felt a vague regret at his own acquired sense of fair play . Below it lay a savagery that could rejoice in revenge at any price , and Mumtâza Mahal , watching him , thought him still more like his ancestors , and nodded approvingly . "
18524	18528	18522	18522	Roshan	89	" she said , "
18594	18595	18597	18597	he	84	" "
18604	18615	18597	18597	he	84	" put in Roshan , then shrugged his shoulders impatiently . "
18632	18633	18628	18628	grandmother	760	" "
18649	18665	18645	18645	their	776	" retorted the old lady , ending the discussion with proverbial wisdom as a clincher . "
18681	19060	19063	19063	yea	777	" Roshan felt as if they did the former at any rate , as he strode back toward the fort , telling himself he would feel better when he had on his uniform once more . This was his metier , not marriage . The best soldiers , the really great soldiers -- he paused , the knowledge that he could never rise to real greatness coming to make him clinch his right hand as if on his sword - hilt . The tempest of revolt which swept through him left him dazed , for he had reasoned the matter out with himself thoroughly , and thought he had accepted the situation , thought that he had realized that his dignity in the regiment under the present system went side by side , and not behind , that of the English officers . Yet here he was at the mercy of something too strong for acquired wisdom . He walked on faster to escape into a more wholesome environment , and by sheer force of will succeeded in driving away all thought of the past interview save a triviality . That was the remembrance that her name was Laila , his Roshan . Light and Darkness , Day and Night . A fate indeed . As he passed into the courtyard , however , on his way to the door in the river bastion , a group in its centre , round the old gun , brought his attention back to realities , and he went towards it , his slipper - shod feet making no martial clank , this time , on the union - jack of raised paths . The group consisted of half a dozen or so of men listening to something which was being declaimed , with much gesticulation , by an ash - smeared jogi , whose wide - pierced ears , distended by conch - shell rings , and transverse bar of white on his forehead , showed him to belong to the sect which claims to have transcendental powers . Apparently he had been making the claim , for a young man , whose costume smacked of Western culture , and whose face was acute , litigious , interrupted him impatiently . "
19097	19204	19205	19205	Thy	778	" Lala Ramanund , whose dress was even more Western , and who had a certain air of distinction , due , evidently , to position , assented ; adding , as a rider , and with some contempt , that at present they had only jogi Gorakh - nâth 's word that any interference was intended . Gorakh - nâth , a tall , muscular man , naked save for his grass - rope girdle , his wild hair twined and twisted to a tiara , his wild , half - insane eyes telling of drugs , shot a glance of absolute defiance at Ramanund . "
19222	19244	19248	19248	thou	778	" he began , alluding to the fact that they were respectively called after the founders of their absolutely antagonistic sects , "
19252	19330	19205	19205	Thy	778	" Here Dya Ram , the first speaker , alarmed in his lawyer 's soul at the militant tone of the jogi , suggested hastily that they might inquire , say at the gate ; or stay ! there was the risaldar coming ; he must know . Once more , as he listened to the question put to him , the expression of his race and creed came to Roshan 's face , hiding its culture . "
19335	19340	19205	19205	Thy	778	" he replied haughtily . "
19362	19368	19369	19369	I	0	" His contempt was palpable . "
19374	19381	19369	19369	I	0	" put in Dya Ram eagerly . "
19418	19426	19427	19427	Lo	123	" Roshan 's face was a study . "
19476	19484	19470	19471	Dya Ram	142	" Dya Ram gave an uneasy cough . "
19491	19495	19470	19471	Dya Ram	142	" he began . "
19501	19509	19470	19471	Dya Ram	142	" put in a new voice cringingly . "
19551	19552	19536	19536	I	0	" "
19555	19561	19536	19536	I	0	" echoed the Mahomedan curtly . "
19579	19594	19600	19602	risaldar - sahib	92	" Here Ramanund , who had hitherto listened indifferently , took up the cudgels . "
19604	19608	19600	19602	risaldar - sahib	92	" he said ; "
19623	19633	19609	19611	our pious folk	797	" Gorakh - nâth turned on him at once . "
19639	19643	19637	19637	Vaishnava	143	" he said . "
19675	19680	19666	19666	Thou	798	he"--here he pointed wildly to Roshan--"yea
19730	19733	19750	19750	jee	144	now,"--here he laughed jeeringly,--"which
19754	19766	19769	19769	he	801	" Dya Ram looked at him , then at Ramanund perplexedly . "
19771	19776	19769	19769	he	801	" he said aside . "
19783	19784	19769	19769	he	801	" "
19790	19800	19802	19802	I	0	" replied Ramanund in a low , rapid undertone , "
19827	19928	19937	19937	Indra	146	" he broke off almost desperately in his confession . Dya Ram , who had signed himself Agnostic , nodded . He understood what it was to be rudderless in a familiar current , and came to the rescue of his friend 's consistency by asserting that any such decision regarding the gun , if one had been made , would certainly be disputed . That he and his -- though they demurred to its being counted against them for faith in the worshipping of mere matter -- would , if necessary , carry the case to the High Court . "
19946	20043	19943	19944	Dya Ram	142	" retorted Roshan , and as he strode off he spat deliberately in the dust . That also surprised him faintly , for he had thought he had learnt tolerance of the Huzoors . So , with a frown and yet with relief , he put his hand on the latch which would open the way back to a less disturbing environment . As he did so , another hand was on it also . The door opened from within , and Father Ninian stood on the threshold barring it ; but barring it with smiles . "
20049	20055	20046	20047	my pupil	805	" he said in English . "
20098	20119	20121	20121	you	0	" Roshan , as he stepped aside elaborately to let the old man pass , drew himself up and saluted . "
20138	20157	20127	20127	I	0	" His tone made Father Ninian pause to look at him for an instant ; then he replied , "
20171	20304	20159	20159	I	0	" Roshan gave a little hard laugh as he went in ; if the old man liked to think so , let him . But Father Ninian 's face as he passed -- a black shadow in the sunshine -- across the level steps leading down to the river wore a wistful smile . Old and new , he thought . New and old . Senseless , useless words , fit only for humanity to juggle dreams from , since no man knew the unseen beginning , knew the unseen end ; knew even his own birth and death . In the endless band of life , naught came first , naught last , and the things of to - day might be old , the things of yesterday might be new . "
20307	20548	20159	20159	I	0	" The name came soundless to the priest 's lips , and a quick flush of youth , and hope , and joy seemed to smooth away the wrinkles of his face . A faint laugh , a happy laugh , went further towards a hearing than the name . It was sixty years ago , nearly , since he had left her . An old story indeed , and yet how new . The new wine of it ran in his old veins , thrilled to his old brain , and took him back absolutely to a palazzo on the outskirts of Rome , with the pale flood of the Tiber flowing beneath a marble loggia . He had never looked on running water since without remembrance , and now -- his feet having led him unconsciously to the river 's edge -- he stood smiling at the pale flood of the Hari . For he knew that he had fought a good fight , that he had kept the promise he had made in order to still her soul ; that he had kept her boy , Pietro Bonaventura , so far as he could , from harm , and his child , and his child 's child , gathering them as lambs into the arms of Holy Church . And then something in the last thought drove the tender human smile from his face . He murmured a "
20556	20572	20159	20159	I	0	" bent to the stream , and dipping his fingers in it , crossed himself . "
20589	20744	20585	20585	Baba	149	" said a voice behind him . It was Gorakh - nâth the jogi , who , his sympathizers having departed , had come to fill his gourd . Father Ninian turned ; so for a space they stood face to face ; representatives of the two great supernaturalisms of the world ; the one which has held the West , the one which has held the East . The old man 's face , at first , returned to kindly human tolerance ; for his fifty years of Eshwara had widened his sympathies . But , as he stood before the jogi it hardened , and the priestly arrogance of the naked ash - smeared figure , stretching a right hand in claim over the sanctifying power of the river , was reflected in Father Ninian 's as he spread his left hand upwards , and turned on his heel with the words , "
20749	20750	20745	20747	Vade retro Satanas	150	" "
20769	20770	20745	20747	Vade retro Satanas	150	" "
20806	21360	20802	20802	I	0	" Mrs. Walsall Smith sent the hostess ' gathering smile round her long luncheon table , and rose . So did Vincent Dering , who had sat at her right hand -- a position due to his rank as commandant of Eshwara -- and , as he did , he drew his chair aside to let the girl on his left pass , with his usual somewhat voyant courtesy , though it was only Laila Bonaventura . He had met her several times during the past few days , and the effect which her singing had made on him had vanished before her general failure to interest him in the least . And to - day she actually wore a blue sash ! In addition she had filled up the time between her monosyllables in methodically crumbling her bread and ranging the results in a pattern , until the inanity of it had got on his nerves , and he had felt inclined to beg her to desist . And yet , as in passing her black eyes looked into his with one curious yet comprehensive flash , a memory of the extreme regularity of the curves and lines which had annoyed him , made him -- quite irrelevantly -- wonder hastily if he could have said anything to Muriel which-- He broke off in his own thought impatiently , and gave an apologetic glance after Mrs. Walsall Smith 's fragile figure . There never was anything , never ! Never a word said , never a deed done , which all the world -- even Eugene Smith himself -- might not hear and know . Vincent Dering felt a pulse of sheer virtue as he looked down the long table at his host , with the vague irritation which the possessors of women often arouse in those who are not their possessors . For Muriel Smith 's half - playful , half - wistful rejection of sympathy had held that faint hint of dutiful martyrdom which seems so purely angelic to selfish man -- unless he happens to be the wretch who inflicts it ! Curious , he thought ; Eugene was n't much of a gentleman , but he was n't a bad sort , and he was fond of his wife , in a way . Yet he was blind to the fact that Muriel was not fit to go trapesing about his blessed old canal works with the pack of padrés and people he had got together to do honour to his skill . She would do it , of course , and get through with it , too ! Here he helped himself to a glass of sherry , and felt incoherently that she was the dearest and best woman in the world,--the one woman in the world , so far as he was concerned . As he sat between those two empty chairs where those two women , so absolutely unlike , had fenced him in on either side , a faint wonder tinged his virtue in comparing the last three years with the time before it . If anyone had told him , then , that he would write every day to a woman and expect her to write to him without a word or a deed-- "
21368	21375	21376	21376	mum	3622	" said an imperious small voice , "
21410	21411	21387	21387	she	3622	" "
21419	21480	21415	21417	little ' un	816	" he laughed gladly , finishing his sherry at a gulp , and , ere catching the little mite in his arms , giving himself that smartening pull together which was so characteristic of the man . He looked very handsome , very happy , as he came up , with Gladys shaking her curls at him in outrageous flirtation . "
21484	21488	21489	21489	I	0	" said Muriel . "
21500	21522	21489	21489	I	0	" That was all ; but it sent him off in absolute content to tackle the stoutest lady in the room . "
21532	21537	21529	21530	Mrs. Campbell	152	" he said diplomatically , "
21563	21564	21545	21546	Mrs. Smith	75	" "
21571	21582	21545	21546	Mrs. Smith	75	" assented the good lady in a mournful Scotch accent . "
21592	21649	21650	21650	I	0	" she glanced fearfully at a tall man in a black frock coat -- a man whose patriarchal beard had once been red and was now the colour of a carpet whisk -- who was buttonholing Father Ninian ; the latter , with his straight slenderness , looking almost youthful beside the other 's burly bulk . "
21661	21681	21682	21682	You	816	" put in a sharp - featured lady who belonged to another black frock coat -- a small one . "
21745	21761	21768	21768	ye	823	" Mrs. Campbell turned her fat good - natured face on her neighbour 's placidly . "
21796	21797	21791	21791	you	820	" "
21813	22031	21807	21807	Carlyon	106	" interrupted Vincent , feeling another spasm of sheer virtue . He had seen the two sitting together at lunch , apparently interested in each other , and he had noticed how Lance , on entering the drawing - room , had made his way straight to those coils of red - bronze hair which had a trick of being the most conspicuous point in any group of which they formed part . So Lance would enjoy himself simply ; he would not have to gain pleasure in complex fashion by dragging about a posse of uninteresting old ladies , for the sake of a lady who was neither . Vincent 's face had a bored look as he began his task by piloting his charge into the verandah , and so on into the open . It was hot work crossing the stretch of sand which lay between the bungalow and the red brick abutments of the canal head ; but once there , with the broad still basin of the united rivers before you , a cool breeze blew pleasantly from that blue barrier of hills with the gold - spiked temples of Eshwara enamelled against it , and a soft white mist hiding the feet of the far - distant snows ; so hiding the "
22109	22119	22121	22121	someone	498	" A log ! not a bit of it ! "
22128	22131	22121	22121	someone	498	" Look ! "
22225	22230	22231	22231	he	68	" Do you remember , "
22235	22242	22231	22231	he	68	" the first time we met ? "
22253	22256	22257	22257	she	105	" Certainly , "
22261	22273	22257	22257	she	105	" It is not so very long ago -- is it ? "
22399	22440	22388	22388	he	68	" I did n't mean that , of course ; but we wo n't talk of it , if you 'd rather not . It is n't a very Mark Tapleyish subject , is it , for an afternoon party ? "
22450	22466	22467	22467	she	105	" So I have been thinking myself , Mr. Carlyon , ever since last Wednesday , "
22474	22479	22480	22480	He	68	" and I am sorry-- "
22486	22539	22480	22480	He	68	" I did n't mean that , either , and you know I did n't . However , we 'll leave it alone . So you 're not coming to the ball ! Do you know , I think it 's an awful pity ; I 'm sure you 'd dance beautifully . "
22609	22618	22619	22619	she	105	" I do n't dance , Mr. Carlyon , "
22634	22642	22619	22619	she	105	" I -- I think it wrong . "
22643	22649	22650	22650	he	68	" I thought you might , "
22660	22698	22699	22699	he	68	" but I do n't see it that way . Of course if -- if you go in for those ideas , you know , you can make it seem -- well -- awful low ; but I-- "
22709	22754	22699	22699	he	68	trumpet--"you see I think it 's awfully jolly ; besides , it 's such ripping good exercise , and I have to be careful , I tell you , not to put on flesh . I ride thirteen - four , as it is . "
22763	22768	22769	22769	she	105	" Is that much ? "
22784	22792	22769	22769	she	105	" You are very tall , surely . "
22811	22890	22806	22806	He	68	" Not so tall as my people are generally . We Carlyons run to size . My uncle , Sir Lancelot 's , six - three , and his son is six - four ; but he 's a bit weedy . So when you 're only six - one and a half you ca n't afford to wax fat ; you 've got to keep the body in subjection . That 's right , is n't it ? "
22914	22921	22922	22922	she	105	" Quite right , Mr. Carlyon , "
22927	22979	22922	22922	she	105	" but see ! the others have gone on , and I do n't want to miss -- She stumbled , in her haste to end the tête - à - tête , on a loose brick , and for an instant was over - near the edge of the abutment . "
22983	23025	22922	22922	she	105	" he said , his hand on hers to give support ; a cool , strong hand , with an insistence in its clasp which seemed to single her out from the world to stand so , hand fast in hand . "
23034	23045	23026	23026	You	105	" he said , smilingly , as he released her . "
23083	23144	23073	23073	his	838	" Perhaps it was the slip which had made her dizzy , but she walked beside him feeling as if she were in a dream . And , in truth , the scene which grew upon them as they went on had a strange unearthliness and unreality . She paused , and gave a little gasp of pleasure and surprise . "
23149	23153	23073	23073	his	838	" she said . "
23172	23198	23200	23200	you	75	" Her eyes met the wide , flower - set walks , the stately white palaces of the Vice - regal camp with absolute incredulity . "
23205	23211	23200	23200	you	75	" she asked , doubtfully . "
23221	23235	23214	23214	you	75	" She felt inwardly as if he had , somehow , for her . "
23287	23316	23249	23249	He	71	" It did , indeed,--absolutely and entirely all right . So white , so straight , so disciplined ; even to the very twist on the tent ropes . "
23324	23331	23334	23334	sergeant	844	" said Lance , pausing suddenly . "
23336	23377	23334	23334	sergeant	844	" A following had gathered in their rear , bringing up the little procession of Englishmen and women , with a knot of dark faces , and from it a man in dust - coloured drill stepped , and saluted . "
23391	23462	23334	23334	sergeant	844	" Erda caught so much in the order given as she walked on . Two inches , or , say , an inch and a half ! No more than that wrong in this dream city ; and over yonder ? Her eyes travelled past the snowdrift of the camp , rising against the blue background of wide water , to Eshwara , rising against its background of blue hill . "
23474	23485	23463	23463	I	0	" said Lance exultantly , coming up with measured strides . "
23494	23564	23565	23565	I	0	" She looked at him critically . Older by some months than he , full of strong character , almost overfull of strong convictions , she was yet -- as women must be until experience of work - a - day life teaches them , as it has taught men , the value of subordination -- curiously undisciplined , curiously lawless . And this striving after uniformity impressed her . "
23577	23589	23565	23565	I	0	" she said , with a new respect . He laughed . "
23627	23783	23565	23565	I	0	" They stood in the centre of the camp , in front of the huge durbar tent , that wandering throne of an empire fixed and immovable as the stars . In front of them , rising out of a wilderness of roses , blossoming where nothing but sand had shown since the primeval sea receded from the hills , was the flag of that empire , its folds drooping round the mast . And beyond it , past the two brass guns pointing down the long vista , was an avenue of palms , bordered by green grass and beds of flowers , and intersected by broad paths leading back to the solid white squares of the tents . At the farther end , a quarter of a mile or more from the flagstaff , a triumphal arch at the entrance showed , until the palm - leaves cut it short , a legend : "
23788	23810	23786	23787	THE LORD----	156	" and above it , far at the feet of those distant snows , lay that wreath of white mist hiding the "
23816	24041	23565	23565	I	0	" Erda 's eyes travelled to it , and from it to the other vistas , similar yet smaller , stretching to the right and left of her . Then to the orderly rows on rows of tents , looking like solid blocks of marble behind her . The whole shut in from the world by a high white wall ; still , silent , empty , waiting for the Hosts of the Lord . A snow - drift facing that mist - drift on the hills . And between them ? Eshwara , and all that Eshwara held of evil and of good . The dreaminess left her eyes , startled at a band of dark figures which at this moment appeared rounding the corner of a tent -- figures in scanty striped clothing with a broad arrow on it ; figures with shaven , close - capped heads and leg irons clanking , as their bare feet threaded through the flowers . And behind them , half - hidden , as ever , under his mushroom of a hat , came George Dillon . He had noticed , as he passed with the others , that the roses were flagging a bit under the hot sun , and had gone back to summon a fatigue party of his criminals to water them . "
24048	24066	24046	24046	mate	848	" he ordered , as the gang , filing past the flagstaff , emptied their earthen pots ; "
24094	24117	24118	24118	They	851	" They obeyed with grins ; and Dr. Dillon , as he paused beside Lance and Erda , looked after them approvingly . "
24160	24161	24145	24145	I	0	" "
24166	24170	24145	24145	I	0	" asked Erda . "
24195	24201	24182	24182	Satan	157	" He paused and smiled . "
24236	24242	24220	24220	they	854	" He grew grave again . "
24246	24253	24220	24220	they	854	" he added , in a softer tone--"as
24335	24364	24326	24326	his	0	" It was almost pitch dark in the huge tent , and as they slipped in through the closed portieres , Vincent Dering 's voice called to them . "
24402	24537	24394	24394	I	0	" Whether that was so or not Erda could not tell . The brief ray of light caused by their entrance had only shown her Captain Dering 's figure beside his hostess , and given her a glimpse of Laila Bonaventura 's white dress close by . So it was eerie , in a way , to wait in the darkness , knowing it to be full of people she knew ; yet to have consciousness of nothing save their voices , since age , sex , position , even race , were alike awaiting this new light which was to make them manifest . Perhaps the eeriness struck her companions also , for the voices came clearly ; not in a babel , but answering each other in the listening , waiting silence . "
24552	24553	24549	24550	Mrs. Campbell	152	" "
24587	24588	24582	24583	Doctor James	159	" "
24636	24637	24608	24608	you	861	" "
24671	24686	24608	24608	you	861	" Its faint hesitancy betrayed this voice , as the dryness did the next . "
24730	24731	24608	24608	you	861	" "
24759	24771	24608	24608	you	861	" This brought a laugh till a fragile voice said plaintively , "
24797	24798	24801	24801	my	0	" "
24833	24834	24837	24838	Dr. Campbell	154	" "
24840	24846	24837	24838	Dr. Campbell	154	" interrupted a tart voice , "
24874	24875	24868	24868	I	0	" "
24910	24920	24907	24907	his	361	" Captain Dering 's voice could not be mistaken . "
24928	24949	24950	24950	Scoffer	874	" This came in an aside , and was followed in the same tone by the eager , hesitating voice . "
24999	25025	24997	24997	you	874	" The very darkness seemed abashed , and there was silence ; till a new voice , young , full - throated , broke it . "
25052	25081	25083	25083	Jove	76	" It had come like a creation , flooding all things with irresistible light . A sort of sigh made itself heard ; a sigh of vague relief . "
25085	25090	25083	25083	Jove	76	" said Captain Dering , "
25119	25177	25242	25242	they	877	" Palpably there could be no fear of that . To the uttermost corner of the vast tent , the pattern of its lining of shawls was visible ; each boss on the parcel - gilt poles glittered and shone ; the very legend round the arms of England above the Vice - regal chair stood out clear "
25183	25239	25242	25242	they	877	" And the expression on the two groups of dark faces , the one which had come by invitation to see , the other which had crept in at the further end , could not be mistaken . In the one , indifference struggled with curiosity ; in the other assent was mingled with awe . "
25245	25262	25242	25242	they	877	" asked Lance , who , having come late , stood close to the latter group . "
25275	25281	25242	25242	they	877	" Erda shook her head . "
25319	25335	25336	25341	The Dee - puk - râg	878	" The last , spoken to herself , was interrupted by Father Ninian 's echo . "
25350	25361	25336	25341	The Dee - puk - râg	878	" He turned to the dark faces in sheer delight . "
25366	25372	25373	25373	ye	880	" he said in Hindustani , "
25408	25418	25392	25392	I	0	" Then he turned back to his other hearers : "
25446	25457	25458	25459	The ignorant	884	" A half - reluctant voice from the invited replied , "
25465	25477	25458	25459	The ignorant	884	" A faintly sarcastic smile came to the fine old face . "
25528	25571	25479	25479	they	884	" It had gone ! and in the black night which settled blankly on speaker and audience , a faint , far cry came from outside . More than one woman 's voice echoed it with a little startled gasp of suspense . "
25577	25582	25479	25479	they	884	" called Vincent Dering , "
25604	25620	25934	25934	he	0	" And then , in response to something he alone had heard , he whispered , "
25636	25661	25667	25667	Vincent	71	" As he bent his head a scent of violets -- the scent she always used -- assailed him ; and that half - heard appeal--"Oh
25669	25862	25667	25667	Vincent	71	" seemed still in his ears . Even in the darkness he knew she must be close to him . He felt the soft ruffle of the lace about her hand upon his wrist . It trembled , surely . Did it ? Or was it only his own bounding pulse . A sudden imperious desire to know -- to be certain -- swept through him . Then , with a sort of suffocating rush to heart and brain , came the knowledge that his clasp was answered by that small hand -- so small , so clinging , so trustful -- so dear -- so absolutely dear -- so dear!--so very dear ! ! As he stood in the darkness , he knew that every mooring was gone , knew that this -- this thing -- would change -- must change -- the whole position . It was a light , indeed ; a light showing the way -- a different way ! A sort of fierce exultation took possession of him . He knew , now , that he had been dreaming till then ; that he had been blind . "
25878	25929	25930	25930	I	0	" said a calm voice coming to him from out of the flood of white light which seemed to have rent their hands asunder . Their hands -- when she stood yonder ? He turned , bewildered , to find a pair of grave black eyes fixed critically on him . "
25937	25943	25934	25934	he	0	" It does n't matter , "
25952	25967	25969	25969	she	891	" You thought it was her hand , of course . I quite understand . "
25994	26008	25969	25969	she	891	" Dillon ! Dillon ! For God 's sake , where 's Dillon ? "
26033	26095	26015	26016	Eugene Smith	74	" Come along , man ! There 's been an accident in the workshop ! I warned them not to touch -- one -- a mere boy -- did . Got startled , I suppose , and fell over -- onto the circular saw -- it was going . His leg -- I've tried a tourniquet , but I ca n't stop-- "
26265	26287	26261	26261	he	69	" I would n't have had this happen for a thousand pounds -- and a high - caste man , too ! "
26315	26329	26338	26339	Father Ninian	81	" Lay him on Mother Earth to die , ye of his caste ! "
26380	26391	26393	26395	the old man	3483	" Give me a hand , please , Dr. Dillon , "
26398	26406	26393	26395	the old man	3483	" he will not die easy there . "
26514	26517	26497	26498	the priest	3909	" Lo ! "
26524	26540	26497	26498	the priest	3909	" Hark to his ' Ram Ram ! ' He knows -- Pidar Narâyan knows . "
27469	27473	27474	27474	he	3733	" Which way ? "
27488	27496	27474	27474	he	3733	" By the deep stream , always . "
27497	27505	27507	27507	Roshan	89	" And which is that , fool ? "
27512	27519	27521	27523	Am - ma	3733	" Where there is most water , "
27526	27550	27477	27477	his	3733	" Cease from paddling , and the canoe will tell you without fail . Such things know of themselves . They are wise . "
27551	27567	27569	27569	Ramanund	163	" But we want to get over to the camp as quickly as we can , "
27637	27654	27658	27658	his	3733	" None will get quicker than he can , my masters ; that much is certain . "
27694	27699	27700	27700	he	3733	" The noble people , "
27704	27758	27700	27700	he	3733	" must surely follow the stream if they go in company ; but if they will quit comfort , and wade , carrying their boat here and there , I , Am - ma , will show them . But it is annoyance . Without going with the stream there is always annoyance . "
27759	27772	27774	27775	Roshan Khân	89	" It is better than going back or sticking still , anyhow ! "
27782	27801	27774	27775	Roshan Khân	89	Hindustani--"Then come quick -- there is room for thee and thy net , and we will pay thee . "
27809	27832	27806	27806	his	3733	" There is weight enough for difficulties without me , my masters ; and here or there is one to a fisher . "
27864	27870	27871	27871	he	3733	" Yonder is our aim , "
27894	27915	27871	27871	he	3733	" They burn a dead man there to - day ; it is ever a good guide to the living . "
27916	27941	27943	27943	Ramanund	163	" ' Twill be the Brahmin lad the Huzoors killed by mistake with their Dee - puk - râg . Didst hear the tale ? "
28056	28079	28044	28044	He	3733	" Ay ! ' Twas well done . Now , as in old days , folk will know who is true leader . "
28383	28390	28392	28392	Ramanund	163	" Above or below , fool ! "
28402	28421	28392	28392	Ramanund	163	" I am no Dôm , like thou , to choose my way among dead men 's bones . "
28451	28459	28460	28460	he	3733	" I am no Dôm , either , "
28463	28486	28460	28460	he	3733	" and were I one , thou wouldst be glad of my guidance to the fire some day , Pundit - jee ! "
28500	28507	28508	28508	he	89	" Be quick , either way , "
28513	28523	28508	28508	he	89	" We have bare time , as it is . "
28665	28671	28673	28675	Am - ma	131	" Had he spilt blood ? "
28719	28773	28774	28782	A big man at the end of the semicircle	984	" A jogi -- they say of Gorakh - nâth 's monastery -- had him for disciple . And there was dhatoora in the sweetmeats , for sure . Whether he was strangler , God knows ! Perhaps . Yet such travellers deserved poison ; who but a fool trusts a strange hand ? "
28830	28839	28827	28827	his	984	" Ay ! none but fools ; and he-- "
28861	28890	28827	28827	his	984	" is the first ; not the last . I , Gopi , gosain,[6 ] say so . Let fools wait and see . Wise men will not . "
28904	28909	28827	28827	his	984	" Thou canst talk , "
28914	28930	28827	28827	his	984	" When thy ' tucket ' ( ticket of leave)--God knows how got!--is so nigh . "
28935	28976	28977	28977	He	165	" Ay ! To - morrow , and the next day , and the next . Then , once more , purification in the Pool of Immortality . Once more , sanctification at the ' Cradle of the Gods . ' "
29014	29067	29009	29009	his	131	" There will be no Pool of Immortality for the pilgrims this year . So Gorakh - nâth says . The canal will drain the spring . But then , he is angry at being turned out of his gun . The people will not give so much -- that is it ! "
29077	29086	29068	29069	The gosain	167	" Turned out ? Who hath done it ? "
29110	29115	29116	29116	he	131	" He who comes , "
29121	29125	29116	29116	he	131	" the Master . "
29156	29162	29164	29167	the circle of prisoners	988	" The Lord hath come ! "
29183	29202	29180	29180	He	131	" The Lord - sahib . Ay ! he may be that -- but the Master -- no ! "
29212	29219	29220	29220	he	131	" He killed that , anyhow , "
29225	29244	29220	29220	he	131	" and he hath the Dee - puk - râg . Is not that enough for poor folk ? "
29312	29326	29331	29331	himself	618	" They have the Dee - puk - râg -- that is enough , "
29545	29554	29556	29557	the Commissioner	1009	" It cann't be done in this wurrld , "
29590	29647	29556	29557	the Commissioner	1009	" An ' what 's more the Archangel Gabriel could n't do it in heaven , though he 'd have a better chance ; for the Cherubim would n't be wanting seats at all ! We are bound to displease somebody , so let 's cast lots before the Lord ; it 's Scriptural , annyhow . "
29664	29667	29670	29671	The other	1012	" But we must,"--he
29684	29792	29670	29671	The other	1012	" Of course we must -- we govern India practically , by cane - bottomed chairs . Ye remember old Gunning . No!--before your time , I expect ! Well ! he kept two hundred miles of North - West frontier as quiet as the grave , for five years , by the simple expedient of awarding thirteen seats in his divisional durbar to each of his districts , and only taking twelve chairs with him into camp . The mâliks , you see , never could tell which would be chosen odd man out , an ' the fear of it kept 'em like sucking doves . "
29793	29796	29809	29809	he	1008	" Indeed ! "
29820	29833	29809	29809	he	1008	" I 'm afraid that sort of thing would n't answer nowadays . "
29864	29939	29848	29848	he	1014	" Not a bit of it ! They 'd send down to Whiteway Laidlaw 's and get Austrian bent - wood chairs by value payable parcel post ! The Teuton , sir , is ruinin ' British prestige by cheapenin ' the seats of the mighty . There ! that 's done -- block A 's beautiful entirely . Now for block B. Who 's your favourite , and why are you backing him ? "
29949	29956	29957	29957	he	1015	" With reference to Roshan Khân , "
29960	29998	29957	29957	he	1015	" His Excellency desired me to ask whether it might not be possible to give him a step for being , as it were , in his own division . He belongs to Eshwara , I believe . "
29999	30093	29848	29848	he	1014	" The very reason why he cann't get an inch more than his due . But you can tell H. E. that I 've settled it . I 've asked Dering to put him on duty , an ' when he is in uniform there 's no mistaking his place . And then we 'll ask him in to the reception afterwards with the sahib logue . Who 's your next -- Dya Ram ! what , the little pleader?--Why the blazes should he come to durbar?--attorneys do n't go to St. James . "
30094	30108	29848	29848	he	1014	" Mr. Cox , the member of parliament -- perhaps you may remember him-- "
30109	30137	29957	29957	he	1015	" A little red - haired fellow , was he ? who wrote a book about India on the back of his two - monthly return ticket ? "
30138	30156	29848	29848	he	1014	" Mr. Cox is a man of great influence with his party , and he supports Dya Ram's-- "
30157	30162	30164	30165	the Commissioner	1009	" Pestilential little fool , "
30170	30253	30164	30165	the Commissioner	1009	" It would n't be bad , though -- stop his scurrilous tongue for a bit . Favour does , you know . But I cann't see my way to it . Old Hodinuggur would be refusing his ' atta and pân[7 ] again . He did it once , ye know , when some low - caste fellow was within sight of him . Said he did n't eat with sweepers ; and if Crawford -- he was Commissioner at the time-- "
30254	30257	30259	30261	the Under Secretary	1008	" Yes ! "
30281	30293	30296	30297	his tormentor	1019	" Had n't been six foot four and broad in proportion , "
30300	30355	30296	30297	his tormentor	1019	" so that the -- let us call them the subsequent negotiations -- diplomatic negotiations -- it sounds well!--didn't reach the eye of His Honour the Lieutenant - Governor , the Thakoor -- one of our best men let me tell you -- would have got into trouble -- more'd have been the pity . "
30356	30359	30361	30364	the man of Secretariats	1020	" Yes , "
30366	30371	30361	30364	the man of Secretariats	1020	" but about Dya Ram-- "
30372	30520	30296	30297	his tormentor	1019	" Dya Ram , is it now ? Could we put him in under the head ' benevolence ' think you ? Did he ever vaccinate a baby , or breed a horse , or give anything to a female hospital ? No ! Then the devil fly off with him for complicating the problem of British rule in India . Why should he want to come to durbar at all ? When people change their dress they should change their desires , but the only effect our civilization has upon some men I know , is to make them want to keep their hat and their boots on at the same time ! Well , that 's done ! I 've found a place for him where Hodinuggur ca n't see the tail end of him unless he squints . Now -- who 's your next ? "

31597	31622	31593	31593	Lance	68	" Miss Shepherd wants -- Miss Shepherd , will you allow me to introduce Captain Mansfield -- to write her uncle 's name first . "
31696	31707	31708	31708	he	68	" That 's right ! Now for the other book , "
31739	31748	31757	31757	his	68	" Your aunt 's first , you know . "
31774	31796	31771	31771	he	68	quickly--"Erdmuth!--is that your name ? Why!--it means earth - mood -- or -- or world 's desire , does n't it ? "
31802	31815	31816	31816	she	105	" I did not know that you were such a German scholar , "
31821	31855	31856	31856	she	105	" Yes ! my name is Erdmuth Dorothea . I was called so after -- after some one you most likely know nothing about , Countess Zinzendorf . She was famous enough , though,-- "
31864	31880	31856	31856	she	105	him--"But I daresay you never even happened to hear of Jean Ziska , Mr. Carlyon ? "
31887	31891	31892	31892	he	68	" Jean Ziska ! "
31895	31918	31892	31892	he	68	" Rather ! We had a pony called Ziska at home -- a Hungarian -- used to eat thistles like a donkey ! "
31941	32004	31935	31935	he	68	" Of course I have -- only the name , you see , brought back such jolly old times . Ziska was the beggar who had his skin made into a drum when he was dead . I do n't expect it 's true , but it 's a fine tale ; the drum ecclesiastic with a vengeance , and no mistake ! "
32005	32012	32014	32015	the girl	481	" Oh ! but it is , "
32024	32064	32014	32015	the girl	481	" My grandfather -- we are really Moravians , you see , and our name should be Schaeffer,--saw it when he was a child . He used to tell me that people said if it was beaten , everybody must-- "
32086	32089	32090	32090	he	68	" Erdmuth ! "
32099	32117	32090	32090	he	68	" I say ! you really ought to come to the ball with that name -- do ! "
32148	32154	32155	32155	she	481	" Really , Mr. Carlyon , "
32268	32278	32260	32261	the woman	1071	" I -- I really have n't a dress . "
32286	32296	32298	32298	Lance	68	" Oh ! anything does for a fancy ball , "
32308	32339	32340	32340	his	68	" A tailor in the bazaar would run you up a Greek dress in no time , and it would do awfully well . All white , do n't you know-- "
32360	32372	32373	32373	he	68	glad--"all straight folds with a little edge of red - gold like-- "
32379	32411	32373	32373	he	68	boldly--"like the sunshine on your hair . And red - gold bracelets high up on your arms -- and a red - gold apple in your hand -- the World 's Desire-- "
32489	32505	32506	32506	she	481	" I did n't know you were so well up in chiffons , Mr. Carlyon , "
32514	32534	32506	32506	she	481	" Did you ever think of setting up a milliner 's shop ? One is badly needed in Eshwara . "
32558	32564	32565	32565	he	68	" I will , if you-- "
32644	32647	32648	32648	she	481	" I ? "
32651	32706	32648	32648	she	481	" I do n't go in for that sort of thing , Mr. Carlyon . You seem to forget my work -- work which I value above -- milliners ! Try Mrs. Smith -- there she is coming in her victoria ; she is one of the best - dressed women I ever saw . "
32733	32744	32723	32723	she	481	" Do you know where Captain Dering is ? He promised-- "
32798	32807	32810	32811	Mrs. Smith	75	" He might have sent a little sooner , "
32813	32829	32841	32841	her	481	" I have been waiting ; he said he would drive me in his dogcart . "
32850	32871	32872	32872	He	68	" I 'm awfully sorry -- it 's all my fault -- I was late to begin with , and then-- "
32883	32892	32893	32893	she	481	" I am afraid I kept Mr. Carlyon , "
32898	32920	32893	32893	she	481	" most unwillingly , I assure you . Thanks so much , but I can get in quite well by myself . "
33136	33142	33172	33172	she	481	" Cradle of the Gods , "
33408	33413	33372	33375	one of its sentries	1095	" Justice ! justice ! "
33414	33425	33427	33428	Dr. Campbell	154	" It is that pernicious fellow , Gorakh - nâth , "
33432	33492	33427	33428	Dr. Campbell	154	" He wishes , no doubt , to appeal against Captain Dering 's order , of which I , for one , am heartily glad . A Christian government is bound to refuse sanction to the practice of a faith which , it is impossible not to see , is degrading in the extreme to those who hold it . "
33512	33538	33539	33541	Dr. James Campbell	154	" Yet it seeks what we do -- peace -- forgiveness -- the cradle of the goodness , the innocence it left behind -- somehow . "
33551	33558	33539	33541	Dr. James Campbell	154	" May I ask what has caused-- "
33559	33566	33568	33569	Mrs. Campbell	152	" That 's easy tellin ' , "
33573	33633	33568	33569	Mrs. Campbell	152	" It 's yon hat with feathers , when she is accustomed to a pith one . An ' she standin ' in the sun talkin ' to Mr. Carlyon ! It 's just got to the lassie 's head . I was the same myself when I was young , Erda ; but Dr. James thought it a duty-- "
33643	33649	33636	33636	I	0	" put in her husband . "
33680	33692	33679	33679	David--	189	" Mrs. Campbell nodded hers and smiled , and almost winked . "
33711	34022	33705	33705	he	190	" Erda flushed scarlet all over her face and neck . It seemed to her as if she had forgotten her cousin , the Reverend David Campbell , altogether . And yet she was engaged to be married to him as soon as he returned from a well - earned holiday in England . A swift remorse left her pale again . Davie , who was so much in earnest , who looked to her as -- as-- That vision of a woman with a red - gold edging to her white robe and a red - gold apple in her hand came to send the blood to her face once more . The long durbar tent was packed from end to end with the cane - bottomed seats of the mighty ; and in each sat its appointed occupant,--patient , grave , silent . But in the two rows behind the Viceroy 's still empty chair of state the Englishmen in political dress or uniform who sat in the front , and the Englishwomen in the latest Paris fashions who sat behind , were talking and laughing ; in a perfectly well - bred way , yet , to the majority of those silent spectators , at the expense of decency , since a durbar is , like a West Indian ball , not for ' talkee . ' There was , however , no disapproval on those indifferent dark faces . Such things were part and parcel of that general eccentricity of the Huzoors , before which it behoved calmness to remain calm . Yet those same faces would have been quick to notice and resent the faintest breach of etiquette in regard to their own treatment , or position . Those being correct , the rest was immaterial . And now , the sudden strains from without of "
34027	34265	33705	33705	he	190	" sent those talking , laughing rows to their feet silently , with the proud alacrity so noticeable in India when the act is a confession of faith , indeed ! But the mass beyond followed suit obediently , with a starry shiver of diamond - flash , a milky way of pearl - shine ; for Eugene Smith 's electric light was working full power . Finally , as if wafted on the full chords , came a small man , with that inevitable look of coming into church which Englishmen consider dignity ; possibly because public worship is , really , the only function in which they are not inwardly ashamed of taking part . The great gold chair , the great gold footstool , seemed all too large for everything about their occupant , save the diamond star , the ribbon on his breast . Yet , in a way , the scene gained by his inadequacy when , after a decent pause , a decent silence , he rose , small , insignificant , to give voice to Empire -- in a strong Scotch accent , it must be admitted , which equalled the Commissioner 's Irish one , when , its proper exponent , the Secretary , having a cold , he read a translation of the Viceroy 's speech , and his soft brogue ran riot among the clamorous Persian vowels . "
34276	34428	33705	33705	he	190	" The diamonds and pearls sat too still for play , so the electric light contented itself with the white teeth of Englishwomen as they yawned . But even these failed it when , the speech ending , that front row began its file past ; the civilians first , the soldiers next . A quick file , a formal bow as a rule ; but , every now and again , a pause would come in the monotonous string of names , for a few words from the Viceroy , and another bow ere the recipient passed on . Muriel Smith , who sat behind -- the best dressed woman there , as Erda Shepherd had judged her -- watched her husband 's tall gaunt figure approaching , and wondered if that pause would come to him . Her heart beat so when it did that she could hear nothing except "
34432	34433	33705	33705	he	190	" "
34437	34438	33705	33705	he	190	" "
34441	34450	33705	33705	he	190	" ; but a whisper from her neighbor , "
34463	34502	34456	34456	I.	1102	" left her sick and faint with relief . Even so , her eyes instinctively sought Vincent Dering 's sympathy ; but he , to her surprise , was looking at the tall gaunt man whose face was a "
34505	34603	34607	34607	i	0	" in itself , as he made his way back to his seat , forgetful even of his wife . But he had forgotten her , amid a host of other things , for three whole years : forgotten them in a ceaseless effort , an untiring energy . And now that the necessity for this was over , sleep and rest were his first thoughts . He took both , apparently , in his chair , while the Commissioner , causing this time a fresh flashing of jewels , began on a fresh string of titles . "
34629	34965	34966	34966	God	96	" And , as they rolled on , the atom of humanity belonging to them -- someone in faded brocade , with ropes of ill - shaped pearls and uncut stones wound about him , or a jauntier figure fresh and glittering from a Calcutta jeweller 's shop -- would be singled out by its political in charge , like a sheep from a flock , and guided dexterously to the exactly proper spot in the whole round world wherein obeisance and offering could be made with dignity to itself , and the recipient . Then it would be swept on , regardless of an invariable desire to break back , in an endless circle to its seat , while fresh titles rolled out , and a fresh owner was hemmed in and swept forward . For two whole mortal hours , this , and nothing but this ; with , every now and again , that pause for a few words , translated now into Irish - Urdu , producing an expression as of a cat licking cream , on a face as it was was hustled back , blindly obedient , as sheep are with a collie they know and trust . So , at last , long after everyone , even Dya Ram -- who looked terribly disjointed between his frock coat , white tie , grey trousers , and the gold mohur which he persisted in holding after native custom in his gloved right hand -- had passed , the politicals gathered in a knot , like church - wardens for the offertory plates , and the distribution of atta and pân , that sacrament of servitude and sovereignty , began . It , too , was exactly like an offertory ; that is , a languid passing round of a plate by an official , and yawns for the rest of the congregation . Finally , with a vigour savouring -- like a voluntary -- of relief , the band attacked "
34970	35002	35004	35005	the Lord	3426	" once more , the Viceroy retired , the durbarees trooped out , still calm and silent , yet satisfied , and the Commissioner , sinking into a vacant seat , said:-- "
35032	35033	35034	35034	I	0	" "
35042	35050	35034	35034	I	0	" began the Under Secretary , laboriously . "
35104	35105	35106	35106	You	0	" "
35114	35120	35106	35106	You	0	" she interrupted , laughing . "
35147	35148	35144	35145	a fraud	1110	" "
35159	35194	35156	35157	an Irishman	1111	" put in Father Ninian , with an almost tender smile for the keen , whimsical face which had been friend to him , and foe to him , for many a long year . "
35204	35205	35201	35202	Mrs. Smith	75	" "
35219	35226	35215	35217	a kind soul	1113	" urged the Commissioner , persuasively . "
35231	35236	35238	35239	the Commissioner	1009	" Striven -- heaven ! "
35247	35301	35238	35239	the Commissioner	1009	" My dear madam , did I commit such a crime -- I mean rhyme ? But the poet 's right . Ye ca n't go wide of the mark , annyhow , even in a song , but you 're sure to find the fact again in the heart of a friend . "
35414	35423	35393	35399	the band , weary of national anthems	1122	" Tommy , make room for your uncle . "
36181	36189	36190	36190	she	151	" I thought you were Captain Dering , "
36193	36210	36190	36190	she	151	" Why do you wear the same uniform ? I thought natives could n't be officers . "
36256	36443	36444	36444	she	1145	" You are angry at being called a native ; but you are one , are n't you ? Then it is so foolish . You are like my guardian . He ca n't bear the bazaar people to call me ' Begum - sahiba ' ; but they do sometimes , you know , because I own a lot of their houses and lands , and my grandmother was a native princess . I know that , though my guardian never speaks about it . He is ashamed , I think -- like you are . I 'm not . I did n't choose my grandmother . Why should one fuss about such things ? If they 're true , it ca n't be helped , and if they 're not , what does it matter ? Besides , it must be rather nice to be a real Begum . You have n't seen any , of course ; they would n't let you , would they ? That must be horrid . How could you like people if you did n't see them ? Besides-- "
36456	36485	36444	36444	she	1145	" it would be wicked to marry them , you know . You should never marry anyone you do n't love . Even the Sisters told me that . "
36540	36550	36533	36533	him	1146	" I am your cousin ; I claim you . "
36579	36627	36576	36576	she	1145	" As you are here , I suppose you 'll be asked to the ball , also . It is to be in my palace , you know , because Captain Dering thinks it the best place . He says the gardens will be beautiful all lit up-- "
36640	36692	36693	36693	she	1145	" Of course , I do n't know yet ; I have n't seen it , but I think it will be lovely . Only I wish my dress was different . I am Beatrice -- Dante 's Beatrice -- and I think it stupid . But my guardian chose it because-- "
36700	36747	36693	36693	she	1145	amusement--"I do n't know , of course , but I expect it is because my great - grandmother went as Beatrice to some ball long ago . It is generally that . I think he must have been in love with her -- isn't it funny ? "
36748	36751	36753	36754	Father Ninian	81	" Laila , "
36760	36775	36753	36754	Father Ninian	81	" I have been looking for you everywhere . It is time to go . "
36806	36814	36797	36797	he	81	" Who introduced you to that native ? "
36815	36819	36820	36820	she	1145	" No one , "
36825	36835	36836	36836	she	1145	" I thought he was Captain Dering ; their uniforms-- "
36846	36870	36836	36836	she	1145	" I do like the gold and silver lace . Though of course the jewels , like the rajahs wore , look best . "
36884	36945	36871	36871	He	81	" Say not so , cara mia , they would look ill on -- on Englishmen . And listen , child ! You should not speak to strangers ; and I would rather you did not speak to such natives at all . They -- cannot understand -- quite -- for they look on women differently from what we do . "
36952	36958	36959	36959	she	1145	" Very well , guardian , "
36963	36986	36959	36959	she	1145	" only I suppose they must know what their women are really like -- and -- perhaps the native ladies prefer it . "
37061	37072	37073	37073	he	3483	" I 'm afraid you have n't been enjoying yourself , "
37077	37087	37073	37073	he	3483	" Why not ? I thought it rather pleasant . "
37088	37092	37093	37093	she	1145	" Very pleasant ! "
37097	37130	37093	37093	she	1145	" Only my guardian has been telling me not to do things ; and I do n't know why , but I always want to do them at once -- don't you ? "
37139	37146	37147	37147	She	1145	" Sometimes . One has to pretend-- "
37179	37184	37185	37185	she	1145	" Why must one ? "
37188	37217	37218	37218	she	1145	" I never mean to , never ! If I want to do a thing I 'll do it . I do n't mean wicked things , of course-- "
37226	37280	37281	37281	Her	1145	piety--"I do n't want to do them , and nothing can be wrong when it seems right to you , and it is real -- ever so real , and you give yourself to it , every bit of you , without thinking , and -- and -- ask nothing -- nothing at all-- "
37295	37301	37302	37302	he	3483	" Would you do that ? "
37309	37315	37302	37302	he	3483	" Would you -- really ? "
37320	37328	37329	37329	she	1145	" Of course I do n't know , "
37332	37362	37329	37329	she	1145	" I have n't tried yet ; but I never pretend . I do n't even pretend to like my dress for the ball . It is so stupid . "
37379	37389	37390	37390	he	3483	" You will look charming , I 'm sure , "
37397	37418	37390	37390	he	3483	" And if you do n't like it , change to something jolly after supper . Lots of people do . "
37419	37424	37425	37425	she	1145	" Will Mrs. Smith ? "
37433	37440	37441	37441	he	3483	" I really do n't know , "
37451	37456	37457	37457	she	1145	" That 's funny , "
37460	37470	37471	37471	she	1145	" I thought people -- not that it matters , "
37475	37500	37471	37471	she	1145	" for I ca n't . I have n't a dress . Do you know I never have anything I really like -- never . "
37522	37562	37563	37563	She	481	" You 'll have the ball , I 'm sure ; you will enjoy it awfully , and -- and you must n't forget that you 've given me the second waltz , and the first extra after supper . "
37571	37575	37576	37576	she	1145	" Have I ? "
37579	37616	37576	37576	she	1145	" I did n't know it ; but I will . That will be nice . And you are coming to decorate to - morrow , are n't you ? That will be nice , too . "
37741	37751	37753	37753	Lance	68	" I 'm sorry Miss Shepherd could n't come , "
37775	37793	37753	37753	Lance	68	" I wanted her to , awfully , if only because she 's never seen a durbar ; but"--he
37794	37845	37849	37850	Vincent Dering	71	smiled--"I expect someone else wanted her instead . By George ! Dering , you do n't know how that girl works . Sometimes I feel it 's a shame , and sometimes I think it 's splendid -- though of course it do n't matter a dash what I think . "
38183	38203	38173	38173	he	71	" I have seen my cousin . I spoke to her , and -- and she spoke back again . "
38236	38242	38243	38243	she	481	" Said I not so ? "
38247	38255	38243	38243	she	481	" And when will the wedding be ? "
38256	38259	38260	38260	he	71	" Wedding ! "
38264	38278	38260	38260	he	71	" there is no talk of wedding . I have but seen her . "
38279	38284	38286	38288	the old lady	3806	" But seen her ! "
38293	38315	38286	38288	the old lady	3806	" That came after in my time ; but God knows how things go nowadays . Then what didst speak about ? "
38338	38351	38352	38352	He	71	" A bold hussy ; but thou wilt bit and bridle her . "
38374	38379	38380	38380	he	71	foundation--"I am a fool , "
38383	38393	38380	38380	he	71	" and so art thou for all thy years ! "
38401	38422	38394	38394	Her	3806	" Not I ! Did she not say she would like to be a Begum ? and if that means not-- "
38423	38431	38432	38432	he	71	" And could I make her one ? "
38436	38459	38432	38432	he	71	" I -- a risaldar on a bare pittance -- with no prospect of rising . Dost dream me Nawab , fool ? "
38488	38575	38482	38482	She	3806	" And wherefore not , Roshan ? Are all things fixed ? Do rulers never change ? I live here in a corner , nothing but a poor woman : yet I hear more , it seems , than thou dost . I hear of discontent , of desires , of things that call for change . But to - day , they spoke of men being killed to make light for these infidels , and Gorakh - nâth , jogi , hath sworn a miracle . "
38587	38603	38576	38576	He	71	" Is that new ? Is there not always talk ? The wise listen not . "
38618	38631	38576	38576	He	71	" If the Huzoors had listened to such talk in ' 57 . "
38675	38683	38684	38684	he	71	" Thou dost know , of course , "
38691	38696	38684	38684	he	71	" thou canst remember . "
38697	38700	38701	38701	she	3806	" Ay ! "
38705	38747	38748	38748	She	3806	" and there was no more talk than there is now . ' Tis not a question of words . It is fate . Something happens , and then -- then the risaldar may be Nawab -- as his fathers were . "
38760	38768	38769	38769	he	71	" Then let us await the happening , "
38773	38776	38778	38780	the old lady	3806	" Wait ! "
38788	38818	38778	38780	the old lady	3806	" Thou canst not wait . Having gone so far , the negotiations can not drop . Thou must send the gift , and see what comes of it . "
38819	38823	38824	38824	he	71	" A gift ! "
38827	38834	38824	38824	he	71	" What gift , and wherefore ? "
38863	38925	38856	38856	She	134	" Leave that to me . I know what girls like . I have them still . Ay ! a dress that her grandmother wore -- good as new , being for a tall woman -- and jewels . ' Tis no harm , at least , see you ; since if they like it not , the gift is returned . "
38990	39001	39007	39007	she	151	" I feel as if I had this moment arrived , "
39039	39073	39007	39007	she	151	" Yet I know I 've been here for hours . I wonder when the sheer beauty will cease to -- to take my breath away . You understand , do n't you ? "
39074	39077	39079	39080	Vincent Dering	71	" Yes ! "
39464	39469	39452	39452	they	1192	" jewel in the lotus "
39557	39566	39587	39587	he	71	" On such a night did young Lorenzo , "
39658	39664	39665	39665	he	71	" And old Lorenzo also , "
39668	39708	39665	39665	he	71	" The disease is nonprotective , contagious , and marked by extraordinary vitality in the virus , which after long years may spring to fresh life from a dress , a bit of ribbon , a lock of hair . "
39709	39718	39720	39721	the Commissioner	1009	" Oh ! have done with such blasphemy ! "
39725	39779	39720	39721	the Commissioner	1009	" and me racking me brains which of all the beauties of this hareem I 'd better fall in love with ! Dering , you 're a steward , I believe . Turn that man out for obtruding the exigencies of everyday life -- including a swallow - tail coat -- into Paradise . "
39780	39788	39790	39791	Vincent Dering	71	" I 've objected already , sir , "
39795	39805	39790	39791	Vincent Dering	71	" but he declares he is a malarial bacillus . "
39806	39810	39812	39813	the brogue	1209	" A what ? "
39815	39822	39824	39825	the doctor	334	" A malarial bacillus , sir , "
39827	39882	39824	39825	the doctor	334	" as I have failed hitherto -- like everybody else -- to recognize the gentleman , even through a microscope , I am naturally at sea as to the proper costume . And you will , of course , admit the universal rule : ' When in doubt , play a dress suit . ' "
39883	39887	39889	39890	Lance Carlyon	68	" By Jove ! "
39903	39920	39921	39921	He	68	" what a ripping idea . Wish I 'd thought of it instead of this kit . "
40013	40024	40026	40027	Muriel Smith	151	" I 'm glad you did n't , Mr. Carlyon , "
40031	40059	40026	40027	Muriel Smith	151	" You look very nice in it . Only those things on your legs -- I forget the proper name -- must be difficult to dance in . "
40060	40073	40076	40077	the Commissioner	1009	" Greaves -- the well - greaved Greeks , me dear madam , "
40079	40118	40076	40077	the Commissioner	1009	" Plural of grief . Ah ! ye should have seen him come to it just now with the general 's wife . Your chance of promotion 's gone , me dear boy -- the marble floor resounded . "
40119	40136	40138	40139	Mrs. Smith	75	" Well , it is n't half so inconvenient as my husband 's dress , anyhow , "
40158	40168	40170	40171	Mr. Smith	201	" That 's all you know , my dear , "
40183	40216	40217	40217	His	201	" I never said Robinson Crusoe was a good dancing dress , but I claim it is n't bad to sleep in , especially out of doors . Soft and furry -- and-- "
40224	40233	40235	40236	the doctor	334	" And it can claim solitude , anyhow , "
40240	40270	40235	40236	the doctor	334	" Think of the disgust of an old established microbe , like myself , when his swept and garnished home is invaded by a party of seven strange devils . "
40271	40277	40279	40280	Mrs. Smith	75	" How rude you are ! "
40282	40302	40279	40280	Mrs. Smith	75	" Besides , we are n't seven , and I believe Robinson Crusoe discovered this island before you did ! "
40303	40315	40318	40318	Lance	198	" I think the French cook takes the cake , though , "
40329	40346	40318	40318	Lance	198	" Shirt sleeves must be an awful pull when you are dancing with a burra mem . "[8
40348	40353	40355	40356	the Commissioner	1009	" True for you ! "
40360	40458	40459	40459	he	1217	" That 's the very reason I took to it , me dear boy , when me own merits and me advancing years doomed me to all the stout ladies in India . Besides , me paper cap rids me of two of me reports anyhow . Ye see I always have to wear two caps ; one before , and one after supper . Otherwise I find the contints get mixed , and make me statements unreliable ; and then me enemies say it 's the champagne . I feel it coming on me now , but-- "
40468	40510	40467	40471	a boy--"by a merciful providence	4306	boy--"by a merciful providence there 's the band at the ' Roast Beef . ' Now , are ye coming in to supper with me , Mrs. Smith , or are you one of those who have to change their identity ? "
40511	40515	40516	40516	she	1218	" Not I , "
40523	40534	40535	40535	She	1218	" I 'm quite content with myself , thank you ! "
40600	40617	40619	40620	the Commissioner	1009	" Besides , Undine can always do quick - change artist , and assume a soul , "
40634	40657	40619	40620	the Commissioner	1009	" Me dear madam ! I apologize profoundly . Miss Bonaventura , Captain Dering 's waiting for you , I 'm sure . "
40828	40837	40838	40838	he	71	" But you are enjoying yourself , surely ? "
40841	40849	40850	40850	she	481	" Oh , yes ! thank you , "
40853	40869	40850	40850	she	481	" only it is n't real , of course . It does n't mean anything . "
40884	40916	40870	40871	Dr. Dillon	69	" Perhaps , my dear young lady , it is as well it does n't . So let us eat , drink , and be merry , for tomorrow we die ! "
40925	40968	40969	40969	She	481	" Oh ! I did n't mean that , of course ; that is wrong . I only meant that things do n't match -- the place and the people , I mean . Except one or two -- those for instance . "
41013	41023	41025	41026	the girl	481	" Did you ever see such a funny figure ? "
41034	41068	41025	41026	the girl	481	" He is quite crazy with joy . He told me to - day this was the first time for forty years that he had been himself ! That he has been bewitched . "
41069	41078	41080	41080	Vincent	71	" I believe I 've been bewitched too , "
41084	41093	41080	41080	Vincent	71	" Let us all go back forty years . "
41111	41158	41094	41095	Dr. Dillon	69	" That would effectually annihilate two of the company , and reduce me to cutting my teeth ; and I want the use of them at supper . Come along and have something solid , Miss Bonaventura ; there is nothing so indigestible as fancy sweets . "
41218	41228	41230	41230	Vincent	71	" Do n't forget ours -- the first extra , "
41265	41275	41276	41276	she	481	" I shall be back in plenty of time , "
41299	41306	41308	41309	the doctor	334	" That 's a queer girl , "
41316	41378	41308	41309	the doctor	334	" not half bad . That is just it , in fact ; she is a clear case of atavism , and as her ancestors seem to have been either saints or sinners , there you are ! For it 's the same tissue absolutely ; indeed , there 's precious little difference between the two when you come to analyze . "
41379	41384	41386	41386	Vincent	71	" I never do , "
41542	41559	41697	41699	the old priest	1250	" ' The Cradle of the Gods , ' did you say , my dear lady ? "
41575	41608	41610	41611	Father Ninian	81	" Just so -- the pilgrims go there every year . It lies -- let me see -- I think I can point it out to you . Ah ! Captain Dering ! "
41626	41660	41661	41661	He	81	" We do n't disturb you , I hope ; but Mrs. Palmer was speaking about the ' Cradle of the Gods . ' It must lie -- don't you think so?--over there . "
41669	41677	41679	41679	Vincent	71	" I should fancy so , sir , "
41681	41688	41679	41679	Vincent	71	" that is about due north . "
41689	41695	41697	41699	the old priest	1250	" Then I am wrong , "
41701	41719	41697	41699	the old priest	1250	" the cave is northwest , and the passage to it is difficult -- almost incredibly difficult . "
41720	41733	41735	41736	Mrs. Palmer	204	" Yet you have been there several times , have n't you ? "
41744	41783	41784	41784	he	81	" Never to the cave itself , madam . I am not quite sure whether I ever really meant to go so far,--and bow in the House of Rimmon ! It would have been interesting no doubt -- but-- "
41792	41843	41844	41844	He	81	soutane--"my cloth , my dear lady , has to be considered . As a matter of fact , something always hindered me . I went as a medicine man , you see ; and so many fall by the wayside . I wonder , indeed , how any reach it . "
41857	41901	41902	41902	He	81	" Some say none do . A jogi -- Gorakh - nâth , Captain Dering,--he whom you turned out of the gun -- claims to be the only man who has ever seen the real cave ; the rest have seen -- illusion ! "
41911	41965	41966	41966	Vincent	71	" ' Tis a claim , madam , made by more than Gorakh - nâth ; who , by the way , promises to defy you , Captain Dering . Padlock or no padlock , he is to get in and out of the gun as he chooses while the pilgrims are here . "
41970	41987	41966	41966	Vincent	71	" I do n't think miracles go down , even in India , nowadays , sir . "
41996	42048	41988	41990	The old priest	1250	" I can not give my assent to that ; I who have seen the blood of a saint turn crimson and flow . Faith , Captain Dering,--that is , the belief of man in a power beyond his own,--is the same yesterday , to - day , and for ever ! "
42281	42286	42272	42273	the band	4201	" Lovelong livelong day , "
42427	42447	42415	42415	he	3483	" Supper 's A1 ; so 's the wine . It 's going awfully well , is n't it ? "
42448	42452	42454	42454	Lance	68	" Suppose so , "
42456	42513	42454	42454	Lance	68	" but I 'm going to cut . These togs are awful ; but if I go now I 'll have time to change and have a shoot down the river . Am - ma says the ducks sit like stones before dawn . They wo n't miss me , as a bachelor , I suppose ? "
42520	42524	42525	42525	he	71	" A bachelor , "
42528	42590	42525	42525	he	71	" It 's about your last chance , I take it . However , if you want to kill something -- it 's a common symptom -- go ! I shall stop till the bitter -- or sweet -- end ! One does n't get into a streak like this once in a blue moon ! I feel fit for anything . "
43031	43037	43038	43038	she	481	" Do you like it ? "
43137	43145	43146	43146	she	481	" It makes it feel more real , "
43150	43158	43146	43146	she	481	" do n't you think it does ? "
43208	43218	43219	43219	she	481	" Only I ca n't dance , you see , "
43232	43233	43219	43219	she	481	" Besides,"--she
43278	43289	43290	43290	He	3483	" I 'm a prisoner -- yours , I suppose . "
43368	43372	43373	43373	he	3483	" Yes!--my prisoner , "
43376	43388	43373	43373	he	3483	" Come , and sit down , and let us talk . "
43400	43440	43395	43395	She	481	" Not here , please ! No one is to see me but you , only you . That is why I waited till I saw you were alone . I only put it on for you to see . "
43450	43466	43397	43397	her	481	him--"When it is real , and you give yourself -- everything , and ask nothing . "
43479	43504	43505	43505	She	481	" Do n't be afraid -- they shall not see . Come , let us go into the garden -- those balconies by the river-- "
43511	43530	43507	43507	her	481	" They are not safe , and my guardian would be so angry . Though it is n't really wrong"--she
43540	43563	43507	43507	her	481	" but when somebody sent me the dress , I thought it would be fun , and I wanted you to see . "
43564	43570	43571	43571	he	3483	" Sent you the dress ? "
43575	43578	43571	43571	he	3483	" Who ? "
43586	43621	43579	43579	She	481	" Are you jealous ? But I 'm not going to tell you . That is just like the novels , is n't it ; but what is the use of making people angry ? "
43622	43632	43633	43633	he	3483	" How do you know I should be angry , "
43645	43711	43637	43637	She	481	" I 'm certain . Come ! Perhaps I 'll tell you when we get to a safe place . There 's one close by . My guardian would n't have it lit up because -- he always has the same reason for everything , you know , and it is so dull -- because something happened there long ago . As if it mattered ! "
43780	43798	43799	43799	she	481	" I used to run all over it , in and out , when I was little , "
43803	43834	43835	43835	she	481	" and old Akbar used to run after me and tumble in ! I could do it now , and you could chase me , if I had n't all this- "
43851	43889	43848	43848	she	481	" Poor old Akbar ! I 'd like him to see me , but I do n't see how it could be managed . And nobody else must -- but you . So come -- come quick ! "
43952	43980	43942	43942	she	481	" Not that way , stupid ! Here -- it 's a dear little balcony all by itself with steps down to the river and a boat . "
43981	43984	43985	43985	he	1285	" Perfect ! "
44068	44079	44020	44021	Two figures	1289	" Yea ! Ger - eeb - pun - wâz , "
44084	44105	44020	44021	Two figures	1289	" Bun - avatâr used to meet Anâri Begum here . She liked him best in uniform , and she wore-- "
44158	44165	44166	44166	he	110	" Anâr -- Anâr -- herself , "
44169	44186	44166	44166	he	110	" And he -- God help us all ! Why did they light up the garden ? "
44212	44215	44216	44216	he	89	" Fool ! "
44220	44234	44235	44235	he	89	" They are no ghosts . ' Twas Dering - sahib and -- and-- "
44239	44250	44235	44235	he	89	laugh--"one of his mems . They do such things often . "
44273	44288	44216	44216	he	89	" God smite his soul to hell ! God smite his soul to hell ! "
44425	44440	44414	44414	he	89	" So groaned Sir Lancelot -- not knowing he should die a holy man . "
44677	44688	44666	44666	Vincent	211	" Sweet is true love -- and sweet is Death . "
44961	44971	44972	44972	he	89	" By Jove ! that was a near shave , "
45003	45021	45035	45035	they	1326	" Is't thou ? Hast brought the tool -- we must get the job done ere dawn and-- "
45248	45255	45207	45208	the woman	1071	" Do you call that love ? "
45265	45310	45207	45208	the woman	1071	" I do n't . When I love , I mean to give , not to take ; and the more I give , the more I 'll have to give ; because , you see , love will come back -- it must . "
45991	46011	46012	46012	he	211	" I thought -- this fool , this atom of dust , thought -- the Huzoor was the devil ! "
46037	46041	46043	46043	Lance	211	" The devil ! "
46045	46056	46043	46043	Lance	211	" What the dickens should the devil come here for ? "
46494	46506	46507	46507	he	131	" Of course you ca n't come , Am - ma , "
46513	46538	46507	46507	he	131	" Well ! I hope the Miss - sahiba will -- will keep the devil away . I -- I -- expect she will ! "
46645	46649	46688	46688	His	131	" lip , lip "
47515	47534	47535	47535	she	105	" It is a son , Am - ma , and I think it is very like you , "
47706	47713	47714	47714	he	131	" ' Tis all right , Huzoor "
47718	47724	47714	47714	he	131	" ' Tis a son . "
47746	47757	47759	47759	Lance	68	" And the Miss - sahiba ? Hath she gone ? "
47775	47782	47784	47786	Am - ma	131	" Nay , she remains inside , "
48035	48047	48048	48048	he	68	" You must be awfully tired , being up all night , "
48074	48082	48083	48083	she	105	" And you too , Mr. Carlyon , "
48086	48093	48083	48083	she	105	" did you enjoy the ball ? "
48102	48114	48115	48115	he	68	" Who -- I -- Oh ! dear me , no , "
48124	48148	48149	48149	he	68	" I say , was n't Am - ma pleased . He slobbered and blubbered with joy all over my boots , and yet-- "
48153	48170	48149	48149	he	68	" I do n't think a little Am - ma could be a very pleasing object . "
48183	48188	48189	48189	she	105	" It was not , "
48193	48211	48212	48212	she	105	" in fact I think it was the ugliest baby I ever saw . Poor little thing , "
48220	48242	48243	48243	She	105	" Anyhow it seemed beautiful to them -- it is the first -- the first that has lived , I mean . "
48262	48270	48272	48272	Lance	68	" So Am - ma told me , "
48274	48289	48272	48272	Lance	68	" He called you the Life - bringer . It is a nice name . "
48299	48308	48309	48309	she	105	" And you are the Death - bringer , "
48322	48335	48309	48309	she	105	" So you and I are at opposite poles , Mr. Carlyon . "
48348	48407	48336	48336	He	68	" I do n't know , Miss Shepherd . ' Death and Birth are the pivots of the Wheel of Life . ' I remember reading that , in Sanskrit , when I went up for my higher ; for I 've passed it , you know . I 'm really not bad at languages when I try . "
48446	48452	48453	48453	she	105	" I wish I were , "
48473	48491	48468	48468	he	68	" I 'm afraid I shall find it a great trouble having to learn a new one . "
48492	48497	48498	48498	he	68	" A new one , "
48510	48520	48498	48498	he	68	" Are you going to leave Eshwara -- soon ? "
48529	48555	48556	48556	she	105	" Sooner than I expected , Mr. Carlyon ; most likely in a day or two . I do n't know whether you have heard , "
48565	48595	48596	48596	she	105	" but I am engaged to be married to my cousin -- Dr. Campbell 's son -- David Campbell . He is a missionary -- as I am -- and-- "
48599	48665	48596	48596	she	105	" He is at home,--or was . We did not expect him back for two months , but he has had a good offer of a splendid place where there is any amount of work to be done . The letter telling us this came yesterday -- by the same mail as -- as he did . He is travelling up country now ; and then-- "
48666	48670	48672	48672	Lance	68	" And then ? "
48715	48737	48740	48741	the girl	481	" My aunt wants the wedding to be from the mission station in the low hills where they go every summer , "
48766	48769	48743	48743	She	481	" So as David"--she
48780	48826	48827	48827	He	68	name--"is in a hurry to start , she thought of going there as soon as the camp leaves -- in a day or two . So -- so -- we shall not see very much more of each other , Mr. Carlyon ; shall we ? "
48859	48870	48871	48871	he	68	" I -- I hope you will be very happy , "
48877	48891	48871	48871	he	68	" Take care , please ; that bit is boggier than you think . "
48928	48936	48937	48937	she	481	" I hope so , Mr. Carlyon , "
48953	48966	48937	48937	she	481	" It is what I have always hoped for , thought of . "
48976	48994	48969	48969	she	481	" I am a bit of a soldier too , you know -- I love the fighting . "
48995	49007	49008	49008	he	68	" You are in the thick of it here , anyhow , "
49221	49227	49228	49228	he	68	" Is it a game ? "
49238	49241	49242	49242	she	476	" Yes ! "
49262	49368	49242	49242	she	476	" It is the game of Life and Death ! That is the ' Pool of Immortality , ' Mr. Carlyon ! The pilgrims come here to bathe -- there must be a secret siphon somewhere , for the water only comes when it is wanted . Three years ago the barriers put up to prevent accidents gave way -- it was no one 's fault . The crowd got in -- a man slipped -- and -- and when the police managed to clear the crush -- the -- the tank was full up with dead bodies ! The children play at it now ! "
49387	49402	49403	49403	She	476	" Sing to us , Miss - sahiba,--sing to us before you go in . "
49409	49414	49415	49415	she	476	" I generally do , "
49429	49432	49418	49418	He	68	" Certainly , "
49549	49563	49573	49574	the Commissioner	1009	" The pivots of Life are Birth and Death . Death and Birth . "
49564	49571	49573	49574	the Commissioner	1009	" Half a minute , Dillon ! "
49603	49612	49578	49579	the doctor	334	" I must attend to these gentlemen first . "
49662	49671	49672	49672	he	1009	" I quite understand , pundit - sahib , "
49679	49727	49672	49672	he	1009	" that you are , as you say , actuated by no personal motive . A man of your attainments and culture can scarcely feel a keen interest in jogi Gorakh - nâth's -- that is the name , I think -- domicile in a gun barrel ! "
49741	49747	49748	49748	he	1484	" Quite so , sir , "
49751	49769	49748	49748	he	1484	" It is merely , as my friend Dya Ram postulates , a question as to the legality-- "
49776	49790	49770	49771	The Commissioner	1009	" In that case it is a matter for the courts , surely . "
49791	49808	49810	49811	Dya Ram	142	" Unless your Honour should , as magistrate , act under Section 418 providing for emergencies , "
49823	49827	49828	49828	he	1486	" Of course , "
49846	49894	49828	49828	he	1486	" I have that power . But do ye really think , sir , that this present matter is of such paramount importance to the stability of the British Empire , that I should be justified in running counter to the ordinary course of law and justice ? "
49937	49944	49945	49945	he	1486	" There is no record whatever , "
49949	50034	49945	49945	he	1486	" of any previous claim to the gun . It has been worshipped , of course ; but that is a different matter . The military power has no intention of interfering with this habit . I may add that a counter petition , praying me not to allow appeal on the ground that this jogi is a man of ill fame , and a public nuisance , has been filed by the mohunt ( guardian of shrines ) at the Pool of Immortality . "
50065	50081	50052	50052	his	1488	" Huzoor it is malice -- malice of hereditary nature . They hope to gain money-- "
50082	50115	50117	50118	the Commissioner	1009	" Exactly , Mohunt - jee ; your money ! if the pilgrims have n't the attraction of a live man in a gun close to your shrine your trade will suffer , "
50124	50136	50137	50137	he	1009	" I am afraid I can do nothing . Of course , "
50144	50158	50137	50137	he	1009	" if you bring a suit to claim prescriptive right , you may , "
50166	50196	50160	50160	his	1009	" but God bless my soul , gentlemen ! Surely men like you have something better to do than bolster up your countrymen in a preposterous business like this ! "
50197	50203	50205	50206	Dya Ram	142	" Pardon me , sir , "
50210	50223	50205	50206	Dya Ram	142	" but if it is prescriptive right , vested in citizens , then-- "
50224	50229	50231	50235	the stern , high voice	1491	" Then , sir ! "
50237	50277	50231	50235	the stern , high voice	1491	" the British Empire will have no choice but to allow jogi Gorakh - nâth to be a son - of - a - gun till the day of his death ! So good - morning to you ; unless-- "
50284	50295	50231	50235	the stern , high voice	1491	force--"there is any other subject you wish to bring forward . "
50341	50351	50352	50352	he	1009	" ' Pon my soul , it 's inconceivable , "
50376	50455	50464	50464	he	1009	" If we are asked what we , the educated natives of India , claim , we reply boldly , all things that Englishmen of equal culture possess by right of birth . We refuse flatly to be lumped in with the crass ignorance of our fellow - countrymen who have , alas ! not yet risen to a pitch of desiring that liberty of which John Stuart Mill speaks in such glowing terms in his valuable pamphlet . "
50456	50463	50464	50464	he	1009	" Hark to that , now ! "
50472	50666	50667	50667	He	1494	" That 's Mr. Dya Ram 's last , and it goes on , as per usual , to abuse . They asked me to put a name to it , and I 've just been telling the confidential department that , barring a horrible misuse of synonym , there 's no sedition , no harm in it whatever ! And there is n't , Dillon . The son - of - a - gun business is ten times as dangerous . Dering 's within his rights , but I wish to blazes he 'd left the brute alone ; or he might have put a blank cartridge in and fired a salute by mistake when Gorakh - nâth was inside ! But ye ca n't keep the military in subjection . The department 's aimin ' at a fight , and small blame to it ! I 'm spoiling for one myself this instant moment ; so come along , doctor , an ' let me hear what your criminals have to say . There 's a pretty sheaf of complaints for ye , ye hard - hearted murderin ' slave driver ! "
50697	50705	50707	50708	the doctor	334	" Yes ! it 's pretty good , "
50742	50776	50777	50778	His companion	476	" It comes of their being idle . Wait till I get them digging again . I 'll work the mischief out of them . When are we going on ; and where ? "
50783	50805	50806	50807	Dr. Dillon	69	" Ca n't get an answer out of the Public Works . Is there anything you would like done , meanwhile ? "
50811	50880	50806	50807	Dr. Dillon	69	" Pretty considerable , rather ! Only it would take months to get sanction . But , if you pass it , Smith says he could put a wire on from the Fort easily in a day . It would save sending by road if there was trouble , and the great thing is to hit back as quick as you can . The mutiny taught us that . "
50881	50884	50886	50887	the Commissioner	1009	" Ay , "
50891	50926	50927	50927	he	1009	" that 's the straight tip ; and that 's why steam and electricity rule India . One can be ready without letting people know . If that had been the case in the mutiny-- "
50934	50996	50927	50927	he	1009	on--"these things come so easily ; a touch starts them ; but you must n't show that you know it . Still , if you thought there would be any difficulty -- I mean if you might n't be able to hold your own till they came from the Fort -- we might make some excuse for quartering a troop closer . "
51003	51131	51000	51000	his	69	" It is n't worth it . I believe myself they 'll settle down when that big brute , Gopi , I told you about , gets his ticket to - morrow . If I did n't want to get rid of him I 'd put him in cells for six weeks . And there 's a warder , too,--or perhaps more . But there 's no fear . I could hold the whole ' biz ' myself , till the brutes managed to get off their leg irons , and as I keep every tool extra mural , I do n't believe there 's a bit of iron within the walls -- except the shackles themselves . So I should have an hour or two , anyhow-- "
51132	51139	51140	51140	he	1505	" Now , here you are , "
51181	51217	51140	51140	he	1505	" You 'll find everything spick and span , I can tell you , for I 've been making the beggars polish their own leg irons , so as to keep 'em a bit busy . "
51357	51364	51365	51365	he	69	" Never show you expect anything , "
51369	51386	51365	51365	he	69	" and as I 've always refused a guard , I ca n't take one now . "
51438	51449	51451	51452	the Commissioner	1009	" There must be a good many warders in it , "
51461	51469	51471	51472	the latter	336	" Now there 's only the hospital , "
51494	51511	51471	51472	the latter	336	" It wo n't take you long . There was only one case in this morning . "
51584	51591	51592	51592	he	69	" When did he come in ? "
51596	51608	51592	51592	he	69	" Ten minutes ago , Huzoor ; the baboo hath given him-- "
51609	51618	51620	51621	the doctor	334	" Never mind what he hath given him , "
51630	51667	51668	51668	he	334	" go on with it , and tell the baboo - sahib to come to me for orders -- at once . Now then , sir , that 's all -- and a bit too much too-- "
51681	51690	51668	51668	he	334	" for it 's a case of cholera . "
51696	51706	51691	51692	The Commissioner	1009	" That will complicate matters , wo n't it ? "
51707	51748	51668	51668	he	334	" Ca n't say . You never can tell . They may take it as a dispensation , or there may never be another case . That fellow 's done for , anyhow -- he'll be dead in an hour . "
51749	51758	51760	51761	his companion	476	" That 's quick , is n't it ? "
51765	51787	51788	51788	he	334	" Rather . I 've seen a man go out in ten minutes , though . The worst of it is , "
51795	51873	51788	51788	he	334	" if there really is some conspiracy at the bottom of the discontent , it is as likely as not the devils who are working it , may take advantage of this -- I do n't mean of this death -- that goes without saying . But when cholera is about , poison is hard to detect , and even if I stamp out the disease , which I mean to do , they may simulate it . "
51889	51893	51894	51894	he	334	" By God ! "
51897	51908	51909	51909	he	334	" if I could catch 'em at it ! However , "
51913	51954	51909	51909	he	334	" it 's no good fussing . If the thing comes , it comes , and I 've kept you here too long as it is , sir . Do you know it 's close on half - past ten ? "
51955	51959	51961	51962	the Commissioner	1009	" Be jabers ! "
51964	52000	51961	51962	the Commissioner	1009	" only twenty minutes to bathe , shave , breakfast , and put on me gold lace continuations . Well , ta , ta ! I 'll see you at the show , of course . "
52021	52070	51961	51962	the Commissioner	1009	" The show ? Oh , yes ! I was forgetting . Rather , sir . Why ! it is as much my canal as Smith 's , for we 've done every inch of it together ; besides , I have got to drive his wife down . "
52071	52078	52080	52081	the Commissioner	1009	" Where the deuce is Dering ? "
52103	52118	52119	52119	His	69	" I really ca n't say , sir ; otherwise engaged , I presume . "
52132	52150	52119	52119	His	69	" I 'm sorry ; I should n't have said it ; but I really meant nothing . "
52160	52208	52151	52152	Dr. Dillon	69	" Oh ! it is all right , sir . I quite believe you did n't . Nobody does mean anything in that sort of connection . It 's left for the doctors to face facts as they are really ; and then you call us brutal . "
52421	52432	52433	52433	she	75	" I believe you 'll have to go without me , "
52440	52463	52433	52433	she	75	" I 've such a racking headache . I do n't believe I can face it -- I'm sure I ca n't . "
52513	52520	52545	52545	she	75	" Dear Mrs. Smith , so sorry-- "
52587	52592	52593	52593	he	69	" You 're nervous , "
52596	52619	52593	52593	he	69	" Let me give you half a whiskey - and - soda before we start . It 'll make you all right . "
52620	52623	52624	52624	she	75	" Nervous ! "
52641	52660	52624	52624	she	75	" I 'm never nervous -- you know that is not one of my failings -- is it ? "
52661	52664	52665	52665	he	69	" No , "
52668	52715	52665	52665	he	69	" but you are a bundle of nerves for all that . You would n't be the woman you are if you were n't . And you are nervous at this moment . Nervous , despondent , out of heart . Come ! make an effort ! "
52725	52774	52716	52716	She	75	" You speak as if I were a Mrs. Dombey ; but I 'm not that sort . Besides , it killed her . I am not coming . It does n't really matter , you know ; nobody will miss me -- it will be all right . "
52860	52873	52874	52874	he	69	" Your husband would . It is a great day for him , "
52903	52948	52949	52950	Dr. Dillon	69	" He ! O , he is quite happy as it is ! He would n't miss me a bit . Why should he ? I am not complaining , mind you -- but why should he ? He has interests enough without me . "
52984	52989	52990	52990	he	69	" My dear lady , "
52993	53041	52990	52990	he	69	" do n't talk -- excuse me -- rubbish . Try and remember what women are always forgetting -- that they are women , and that , while Eve swallowed her portion of the fatal apple , his stuck -- thank God for it!--in Adam 's throat . "
53070	53095	53042	53042	She	1548	" I do n't understand what you mean in the very least . What has Eve 's apple to do with -- my headache ? "
53096	53102	53103	53103	he	69	" A very great deal , "
53107	53152	53153	53153	she	1548	" and with more than your headache , which , by the way , is only a symptom , not a cause . The real evil is -- is something different . If you do not understand -- though I think you do a little-- "
53156	53182	53155	53155	her	1548	head--"I can only repeat my advice about the whiskey - and - soda ; for I can not explain to you crudely what I mean . "
53188	53202	53183	53183	She	1548	" You have no right to hint at things you dare not say . "
53214	53218	53219	53219	he	69	" Perhaps not , "
53244	53289	53223	53223	he	69	" But I will tell you what I can do . I can sacrifice my self - respect and tell you a bit of my personal history which I never meant you to know , but which may help to cure -- your headache . "
53312	53414	53415	53415	He	1549	" Mrs. Smith , I have done myself the honour for nearly three years , of considering you as near perfection as a woman can he . Allow me to finish , please ! I have done more . I have been , as the phrase runs , in love with my ideal of perfection ; but I think you will admit that I have never allowed my feelings to give you , myself , or anyone else a -- shall we say , a nervous headache ? Now , after that , do n't you think we had better start ? "
53522	53534	53535	53535	she	1550	" I quite understand now what you meant , Dr. Dillon , "
53539	53571	53535	53535	she	1550	" and why you did not care to explain . I shall , of course , never be able to forgive you for daring to dream such a thing possible , but-- "
53572	53575	53576	53576	he	1549	" But , "
53583	53628	53576	53576	he	1549	" you will take that half whiskey - and - soda . Here ! qui - hi ! Whiskey sharâb belâtee pani la'o juldi ; mem - sahiba jata hai . ( Bring whiskey - and - soda ; the mem is going . ) "
53724	53728	53729	53729	she	1550	" I ought , "
53733	53777	53729	53729	she	1550	" to have thanked you for -- for your good opinion of me , and your evident desire to be kind . I do so now . But I fear it will be quite impossible for me to forget or forgive the delusion . "
53778	53786	53787	53787	he	1549	" That is quite a minor matter , "
53793	53810	53787	53787	he	1549	" Now , cheer up , Bacilla , you brute , or we shall be late , "
53917	53927	53877	53886	the small man with the big star on his breast	1556	" that the Victoria - Kaiser - i - Hind "
53952	53958	53877	53886	the small man with the big star on his breast	1556	" God save the Queen , "
54086	54091	54093	54094	George Dillon	218	" Bravo , Smith ! "
54120	54141	54093	54094	George Dillon	218	" We 've done that ; and now perhaps , old man , you 'll have time for other things . "
54142	54145	54147	54151	the tall , gaunt man	1566	" Yes , "
54155	54169	54147	54151	the tall , gaunt man	1566	" now I shall have time to settle that point about the searchlight . "
54170	54174	54093	54094	George Dillon	218	" The what ? "
54175	54249	54250	54251	George Dillon	218	" Search - light . There 's been a correspondence in the Engineer about it ; and as I 've all the electric plant here , lying useless , now the show 's over,--until it 's wanted for something else , of course,--I am going to see if I ca n't overcome their difficulty in concentrating all the power on a sufficiently narrow area . I believe I know how to do it . "
54261	54264	54265	54265	he	218	" Believe ! "
54268	54301	54265	54265	he	218	" I know you can ! You are the most intolerably circumscribed , self - concentrated , narrow - minded machine of a man I ever came across . Heaven help you ! "
54346	54355	54356	54356	he	1566	" Not in the least , thank you , "
54359	54379	54356	54356	he	1566	" I was only meditating if I should tell you that I think Eugene has softening of the brain . "
54380	54386	54387	54387	she	75	" Softening of the brain ! "
54392	54404	54387	54387	she	75	" Oh , doctor , do you think it 's that ? "
54405	54418	54419	54419	he	1566	" Well , it is n't softening of the heart , anyhow , "
54423	54490	54419	54419	he	1566	" But I 'm not joking . If someone does n't get a hold on some portion of that man -- I do n't care what it is -- heart , brain , stomach , anything -- and prevent him from killing himself with work , India will lose her best engineer . What he wants is someone to -- to give him a nervous headache ! "
54491	54501	54502	54502	she	75	" We will leave that subject alone , please , "
54567	54574	54576	54577	her spouse	1572	" Did I , my dear ? "
54579	54619	54576	54577	her spouse	1572	" Oh , yes ! I remember you put it in my minim glass because I was working in my shirt - sleeves . Then I wanted the glass . So it got withered and the head snapped off . "
54629	54654	54620	54621	Dr. Dillon	69	" That is one of the many tragedies which come from the delusion all women have that flowers ca n't be out of place . "
55313	55335	55291	55291	she	86	" So she -- my grandmother , you say -- was a dancing - girl -- a real dancing - girl ? "

55639	55666	55636	55636	she	86	" my grandmother never danced like that , did she ? I do n't believe she was my grandmother ! I believe you are telling stories ! "
55681	55713	55674	55674	his	110	" The most noble says true , Anâri Begum never danced thus . But there is the grandfather , Bun - avâtar - sahib bahadur , to be accounted for also . "
56020	56033	56034	56034	she	481	" There is no need to take them back to - day , "
56039	56078	56034	56034	she	481	" but thou canst tell the person who sent them -- he who claims cousinship -- that I will not keep them , that I know nothing of them ; that he must send and take them away . "
56264	56273	56275	56275	Laila	86	" What ! That funny old fat woman ! "
56281	56337	56275	56275	Laila	86	" That dirty old thing ? I remember , she did claim to be a relation of the Nawab 's . And when I asked her why she wore such dirty clothes she was angry , and said she had beautiful ones all tied up in bundles ! I do n't believe she had , though-- "
56338	56353	56355	56355	Akbar	110	" The dress the Begum - sahiba wore last night is one of them , "
56359	56389	56355	56355	Akbar	110	" it belonged to Anâri Begum , Huzoor , and there are plenty more like it . And all are really the Huzoor 's ; no one else 's . "
56401	56411	56412	56412	she	86	" Did it really belong to -- to her ? "
56415	56421	56412	56412	she	86	" and the jewels also ? "
56422	56454	56275	56275	Laila	86	" The jewels also . There are plenty of them . And if Anâri Begum was really the Begum - sahiba 's grandmother , then the jewels are hers by right . "
56455	56463	56465	56465	Laila	86	" She can come if she wishes , "
56469	56543	56550	56550	her	1631	" I see thy craft , Akbar , but I care not for that . Yet it will be fun to receive her as -- as a Begum . And no harm either , since the missen ladies receive her , I know , and her like -- when they will come ! It will be at night , of course , to ensure her privacy , so Pidar Narâyan need know nothing . Only"--she
56565	56600	56601	56603	Akbar - khân	110	" I do naught for naught ! If I please thee , thou must please me ! If thou art their messenger , thou must be mine also ; or I tell Pidar Narâyan ! "

56664	56701	56650	56650	she	1631	" ' Tis but to take a note to Dering - sahib ; he must know somewhat before he comes with the other sahib logue this afternoon . There is no arrangement needed , no fuss . "
56821	56829	56836	56836	he	110	" Thanks ! many , Captain Dering , "
56921	56963	56993	56993	her	1640	" It is n't altogether despicable to let yourself loose in Paradise without an arrière pensée of flaming swords , especially if you can give pleasure to someone else thereby ! One could play Romeo and Juliet in this garden nicely . "

57147	57200	57139	57140	the Commissioner	1009	" we 've done our worst and leave you to take the consequences . That 's sound policy . Anyhow , we are ahead of everybody on the road to heaven , and the pilgrims will have to swallow the dust of our feet ! I wonder how they 'll like it . "
57229	57234	57225	57225	he	1656	" Any more cases ? "

57274	57283	57284	57284	he	1656	" Good - by , my dear lady , "
57288	57409	57284	57284	he	1656	" remember me house is yours if you , or the child , want it . Doctor , could n't you conscientiously recommend change of air to the hills ? Could n't ye swear the close proximity to an open canal and a gaol is unwholesome ? If ye could , you 'd oblige a grass - widower , whose wife is at Baden - Baden -- or is it Marienbad?--living prodigally , while he has to fill himself with husks which no self - respecting swine would eat . Faith , me dear madam , I 'd bless you if you 'd come and kill the cook . It 's a woman 's work ; not a man 's . "
57423	57459	57410	57411	Dr. Dillon	69	" Certainly . I told Mrs. Smith a long time ago that she and Gladys had had enough of Eshwara . Indeed , as her doctor , she would be doing me a personal favour if-- "
57528	57538	57539	57539	she	151	" I do n't think nervous headaches are dangerous , "
57547	57629	57539	57539	she	151	" But thanks all the same . I should love to kill somebody ; even a cook . Perhaps I may , by and by , when all the nice people leave . I 'm so sorry you 're going , but we are still to be quite gay , are n't we , Captain Dering ? And that reminds me we have to settle when that riding party is to come off . Good - by -- good - by ! "
57688	57694	57695	57695	he	81	" That is a mistake , "
57716	57733	57709	57709	he	81	" It need not be , surely ; there is something wrong . I ca n't understand-- "
57754	57759	57760	57760	he	69	" No one does , "
58103	58112	58113	58113	he	69	" I 'm afraid I am awfully late , "
58174	58178	58179	58179	she	86	" Are you ? "
58182	58212	58179	58179	she	86	" I thought I was late ; for this took time ; but I wanted to be the same -- always the same to you , always -- always ! "
58237	58248	58221	58221	he	69	" Yes ! Laila ! always Laila -- my Laila ! "
58257	58264	58265	58265	she	86	" I knew you would come , "
58268	58277	58265	58265	she	86	" Love comes to love , you know . "

58734	58740	58741	58741	he	84	" Oh ! Captain Dering ! "
58745	58771	58772	58772	he	84	" it is you , is it ? You have found a pleasant place , indeed ! But scarcely a very safe one for your companion-- "

58811	58828	58799	58799	he	84	" and you are lightly clad . Will you not be wise , and leave us ? "
58906	58912	58913	58913	Laila	86	" Perhaps you had better go-- "
59044	59054	59004	59004	She	86	" Memory plays strange tricks with us at times , "
59076	59279	59280	59280	he	1692	" She has taken me back , this evening , nearly sixty long years . The river before us is the yellow flood of the Tiber , the woman who has just left us is the woman I loved -- sixty long years ago -- I had kissed her , as you have kissed her . I had told her I loved her , as you have just told her -- and then , like an echo from the river below where a boat was moored , came to our ears , the same words , ' I love you . '--They were spoken , Captain Dering , by a boy , barely in his teens , to a waiting - maid . The boy was her son . She had been married , as they marry them in Italy , almost before her girlhood , and I , the boy 's tutor , was nearer her age than his father -- a better man , too , Captain Dering ! But those words--'I love you'--parted us once , and for all . They mirrored the truth for us -- the truth of the love which hides in balconies -- in pleasure boats-- "
59303	59326	59292	59292	He	1692	" Let it mirror the truth to you also , my son -- leave this poor lady to her duty , as I-- "
59351	59377	59327	59328	Vincent Dering	71	" You do n't understand ; you are absolutely mistaken -- I refuse to explain , but I really must ask you not to interfere . "
59407	59439	59387	59387	He	1692	" Were I the lady 's husband , sir , I would make you answer . As a priest of God , I must warn you that I will speak , if-- "
59446	59470	59471	59471	He	3483	" I ca n't prevent that -- but you will wrong us -- her at any rate -- the best , the kindest woman-- "
59495	59505	59506	59506	he	3483	" It is sixty long years , Captain Dering , "
59519	59576	59506	59506	he	3483	" since I have laid my hand on my fellow - men save in the hope of healing . It was a fancy of mine after -- after we kissed , and parted . But I touch you as a second self , a fellow - sinner ; for she too was the best -- the kindest-- "
59604	59607	59608	59608	he	3483	" Possibly , "
59612	59630	59631	59631	he	3483	" but I must really refuse to discuss the matter further . Shall we end this , sir,--unless-- "
59640	59648	59631	59631	he	3483	foils--"you would like to fight it out ? "
59704	59717	59718	59718	he	3483	" I have not the privilege of being the lady 's protector , "
59722	59725	59718	59718	he	3483	" If I were,"--He
59732	59794	59718	59718	he	3483	" Shall we come upstairs ? I came down for these foils in order to teach Mr. Carlyon the thrust we spoke of once . ' L'Addio del Marito , ' they called it in my youth -- I doubt if the name has changed now . He will be wondering what has become of me , and -- and it ! "

63180	63239	63175	63175	he	1811	" takes out their brains , and puts the bit back . Then ' tis cholera . That is why they burn them in their clothing and their caps , so that none may see . But they say , ' tis for the safety of the living ; as if that did not lie with the Gods ! "
63240	63245	63175	63175	he	1811	" Hark to him ! "

63432	63503	63429	63429	his	165	" That may be ; but these are to grease the slots of the canal sluice ; without it , water will not run . One brain -- his , that they killed with the light -- opened it but one inch ; as all can see if they choose . And these seven will not go far . What matter ? There be plenty more where they came from . "
63511	63530	63531	63531	they	1823	" Yea ! that is so . It opens but an inch , and there are many prisoners , "

64958	64994	64922	64922	he	68	" and I have been privileged for the first time to see somewhat of the noble work Englishwomen are doing for their Indian sisters . It is no easy task , Mr. Carlyon , for delicate-- "
64995	65000	65003	65003	Erda	105	" I like it , "
65021	65035	65003	65003	Erda	105	" So there is no use wasting your pity on me , David . "
65036	65039	65040	65040	he	68	" Pity ! "
65047	65061	65040	65040	he	68	" I did not even pity you when they called you evil names . "
65086	65093	65095	65095	Lance	68	" Do they call you names ? "
65127	65133	65134	65134	she	105	" Sometimes , not often , "
65140	65171	65134	65134	she	105	" They happened to do so to - day , and David heard it ; there are so many strangers about , you see , who do n't know me . "
65172	65179	65180	65180	Lance	68	" And what did you do ? "
65191	65194	65196	65197	the latter	336	" Do ? "
65203	65224	65196	65197	the latter	336	" Nothing , of course . We missionaries hear such things joyfully -- for -- for the Work 's sake . "

65248	65264	65265	65265	he	68	" if I 'd been there , there would have been a row . Besides , "
65271	65320	65265	65265	he	68	" if I believed in my work as you do I 'd be hanged if I let anybody ' krab'[9 ] it -- or me -- for it 's the same thing . Not at least , without trying to make 'em answer for it all I know . "

65492	65509	65510	65510	she	481	" I have to see another old woman in an alley close by first , David , "
65513	65524	65510	65510	she	481	" You had better go on and let me follow . "
65625	65636	65637	65637	she	481	" You need not have been so fierce just now , "
65646	65691	65637	65637	she	481	" People wo n't have many more chances of calling me names in Eshwara . I told you , did n't I , that I was going ; but it will be sooner than I expected -- to - morrow , or next day . "
65692	65701	65702	65702	He	68	" Then I sha n't see you again ? "
65726	65748	65717	65717	his	68	" I suppose so ; for Mr. Campbell 's appointment will be at the other end of India ; unless , indeed-- "
65754	65780	65753	65753	his	68	look--"my Aunt has asked a few friends in to tea this afternoon to say good - by . If you , or Captain Dering , cared-- "
65781	65788	65789	65789	he	68	" Of course I 'll come , "
65793	65807	65789	65789	he	68	" Now which way are you going , for I am going too ? "
65814	65820	65821	65821	she	481	" But you ca n't , "
65824	65864	65821	65821	she	481	" Oh , yes , I can ! I 'll finish the smoke you interrupted , while you polish off the old lady . They 're not going to have a chance of -- of abusing the work again . "
65988	65994	65995	65995	he	68	" Ah ! Mr. Carlyon , "
66003	66051	65995	65995	he	68	" I am glad . Will you take Miss Shepherd home ? I want to go over to Dr. Dillon at once : and I have advised her not to visit in this quarter to - day . There are many lodging houses for the pilgrims , and-- "
66052	66058	66060	66060	Lance	68	" Did they call names ? "
66077	66106	66066	66068	The old man	3483	" No one ever called me names , sir ; still less a lady who was with me . But excuse me -- I am pressed for time . "
66107	66115	66117	66117	Lance	68	" Now , that 's a man ! "
66136	66144	66145	66145	she	1897	" Father Ninian is not a missionary , "
66149	66155	66156	66156	she	1897	" It is easy for him-- "
66170	66190	66156	66156	she	1897	" Good - by , and thanks ; but I really can go home by myself , Mr. Carlyon . "

66216	66230	66214	66214	him	68	" But -- I should like to tell you something first , please . "--
66243	66270	66231	66231	She	1897	--"Not that it matters , but I 'd like you to know it . I had some news by the mail this morning -- bad news . "

66301	66306	66307	66307	he	68	" So am I , "
66312	66421	66307	66307	he	68	" though it is n't bad in a way for me . Do you remember my telling you about my cousin ? a weedy chap , six - four . Well , they sent him round the world for his health , and he died two months ago , it seems , in Australia . And the shock was too much for my uncle ; he was an old man , and this was his only son . So -- so I am Sir Lancelot now . It does n't make any odds , of course , but I thought I should like you to know , first . "
66451	66473	66447	66447	she	1899	" Thanks , Sir Lancelot , it wo n't make any difference to -- to our friendship , I 'm sure , "
66542	66550	66551	66551	he	89	" So she will see my grandmother , "
66557	66566	66567	66567	he	89	" That is a step , certainly , but-- "
66574	66579	66567	66567	he	89	" it seems impossible ! "
66590	66604	66605	66605	he	1904	" Nothing is impossible with women , oh , Protector of the Poor ! "
66622	66671	66605	66605	he	1904	" and this dust - like one has experience . She will see the female relation to - night after approved custom , and , since this is after the habits of the sahib - logue , she would perhaps see the -- the Nawab - sahib tomorrow . "
66695	66708	66676	66676	his	89	" See -- see me ! Did she say aught of it ? "
66709	66731	66733	66733	Akbar	110	" A woman 's wishes for a lover go not near her tongue , Huzoor ; they keep to her heart , "
66741	66774	66733	66733	Akbar	110	" but if this visit of the female relation be auspicious , as God send it , then there would be no hindrance to the asking ; and even if she said nay-- "
67063	67091	67047	67047	he	89	society--"I would I knew if it were wise to trust thee ? Why shouldst thou take the trouble thou dost ? What is the affair to thee ? "
67102	67114	67115	67115	he	89	" ' Tis but my duty , Cherisher of the Poor ! "
67121	67133	67115	67115	he	89	" For what other service were such as I am created ? "
67161	67164	67165	67165	he	89	" Yea ! "
67168	67203	67165	67165	he	89	" I was forgetting . Such arrangings are meat and drink to thy sort . So take thy price . It shall be trebled if she bids me see her to - morrow , but-- "
67210	67223	67205	67205	he	89	himself,--"thou must needs work miracles for such favour to come so soon ! "
67568	67577	67561	67561	Christians	1930	" ' Tis not our fault , brother , "
67654	67729	67739	67745	a priest - led band of pilgrims	1932	" We get no more than in the old days ; nay , less . For , see you , the third - class ticket takes so much . And that is the Huzoors ' fee . They send it all over the black water to make a mountain of silver in the streets of their big city , London . Oh , pious ones ! Buy ! Buy a sacred sin - expeller ! "
67853	67862	67864	67868	a radical seller of drugs	1938	" There be too many , I say , "
67870	67892	67864	67868	a radical seller of drugs	1938	" If the Sirkar puts a tax on my medicine for the body , why not on thine for the soul ? "
67893	67900	67902	67909	the privileged wit and gossip of the bazaar	1939	" Nay , pinsari - jee ! "
67953	67971	67973	67974	the pilgrims	3444	" ' tis a miracle when folk buy of you ; and that comes not too often . "
68071	68076	68082	68082	he	141	" Teacher of Religion . "
68574	68638	68570	68570	he	68	" To the Major General commanding . This is to give notice to all concerned that illegible miracles is now being performed by bare men in belly of great gun , contrary to astringent orders issued by my lord god . Therefore your petitioners pray for correct diagnosis of same , and removal from Cantonment boundaries with exhibitions not to miracle any more . "
68639	68643	68644	68644	he	71	" By Jove ! "
68647	68667	68644	68644	he	71	" our petitioner is a medical man -- hospital dresser , I expect . Not to miracle any more!--h'm . "
68744	68755	68756	68756	he	71	" I expect that would be a difficulty in Eshwara , "
68760	68786	68756	68756	he	71	" it 's an awful place for upsetting the proper odds . Seems to me impossible to -- to make a safe book on anything . "
68806	68885	68793	68793	He	71	" A safe book ! The dullest thing in creation . That 's why I like Eshwara . As I remember telling you , one ca n't count upon anything in the topsy - turvy place -- not even one 's self . They talk of the mystery of the East ! By George ! one is in grips with it here ; so come along , Lance ! and remove miracles from Cantonment boundaries at any rate ! "
69079	69087	69089	69089	Vincent	71	" I 've seen that in London , "
69100	69120	69089	69089	Vincent	71	" so I can hardly object to it here ; but if there is hanky - panky with my gun-- "
69175	69185	69210	69210	his	71	" A miracle ! a miracle of the gods ! "

69346	69370	69337	69337	he	71	" There is no one , sir , I can see clear down the metal , but -- but the voice is there . "
69402	69409	69410	69410	he	71	" Close up the gun again , "
69414	69446	69447	69447	he	71	" So long as my orders are not disobeyed , and people keep their bodies out of my gun , their voices are welcome to it ! Come along , Carlyon , "
69453	69485	69447	69447	he	71	" it 's ventriloquism , of course , and I 'd dearly like to catch the beast who does it , but we had better leave it alone for the present . "
69603	69608	69610	69610	Lance	68	" I have it , "
69629	69662	69610	69610	Lance	68	" they 've shoved in a false end , and there 's someone behind . Roshan ! go back and fetch me my long gaff , and Roshan -- my cleaning rod . "
69663	69674	69676	69677	Captain Dering	71	" And tell the guard to come out at once , "
69697	69707	69709	69709	Lance	68	" Stay ! I 've got a ripping idea ! "
69732	69736	69737	69737	he	68	" Look here , "
69744	69835	69737	69737	he	68	" there 's a boy in this gun . It must be a boy , and rather a small one , for there is n't room for anything big . Now is n't there a boy anywhere about the same size who 'd like to come and draw him ? He will be heads this way , and you will be able to get a good grip of his hair , and he will get a grip of your 's , and -- and it will be -- be jolly ! "
69887	69893	69894	69894	they	1990	" Go on , brotherling , "
69897	69919	69894	69894	they	1990	" thou art the best wrestler of the school . Go ! show the Huzoor how thou canst hold thine own . "
69925	69934	69936	69938	a dozen voices	1992	" Yea ! try thy luck , brotherling , "
69940	69952	69936	69938	a dozen voices	1992	" and if thou canst not we will find a champion ! "
70046	70060	70062	70062	Lance	68	" It is beautifully tousled , and you 'll get a good grip , "
70076	70097	70067	70067	he	68	" but it is bigger than I thought for , and you 'll have your work cut out for you . "
70143	70186	70203	70203	Lance	68	" Lo ! he comes -- I see his toes -- bravo , Gurdit ! Nay , the other hath strength left ! Sho ! sonling , let not go for thy life ! That is well done -- Bravo ! Bravo ! "
70212	70223	70224	70224	he	68	" Half a minute more ! Go it , Gurdit ! "
70257	70269	70203	70203	Lance	68	" Wait for his knees . Wait till he loses grip ! "
70271	70292	70203	70203	Lance	68	Lance--"twenty seconds more -- fifteen , ten -- f -- there you are ! that 's it , fair ! ! "
70399	70412	70414	70414	Lance	68	" It was the most sporting draw I 've seen for years , "
70436	70472	70425	70426	the crowd	4412	" and I 'm glad you let the beggar off , Dering . It was n't his fault , and he must have been beastly uncomfortable . Now , if you could have quodded the jogi-- "
70473	70483	70485	70485	Vincent	71	" I hope to do that by and by , "
70488	70554	70485	70485	Vincent	71	" but it was just as well the crowd should laugh to - day . These religious gatherings are always a bit risky -- and , as you know , Dillon is having trouble over at the gaol . ' Pon my soul , I do n't know which is worst to manage -- fifteen hundred scoundrels , or a hundred and fifty thousand saints . "
70555	70561	70563	70563	Lance	68	" A hundred and fifty ! "
70565	70574	70563	70563	Lance	68	" will there be as many as that ? "
70575	70610	70485	70485	Vincent	71	" Quite . So it is as well they should laugh ; for even with the extra contingent of police we should find it a bit hard to manage them if they did n't . "
70641	70652	70632	70632	these	2005	" If I were a man -- I would fight . "
70675	70682	70684	70685	Captain Dering	71	" Let me fight for you ! "

70773	70781	70767	70767	he	71	" I trust there is nothing wrong ? "
70782	70785	70787	70787	Erda	105	" Wrong ! "
70803	70807	70787	70787	Erda	105	" Yes ! grievously wrong!"--her
70814	70817	70787	70787	Erda	105	decision--"hideously wrong ! "
70853	70860	70861	70861	he	154	" Perhaps you can explain this , "
70865	70878	70861	70861	he	154	" we generally have to thank the military authorities for such interference . "
70879	70892	70894	70894	Vincent	71	" Not in this case , so far as I am concerned , "
70981	70989	70991	70991	Vincent	71	" I can assure you , sir , "
70998	71008	71009	71009	he	1009	" I am not the informant . At the same time"--here
71015	71026	70947	70947	magistrate	4427	generally--"I think the Commissioner is right . Our government is neutral-- "
71027	71030	71032	71035	the Reverend David Campbell	190	" Neutral ! "
71045	71096	71032	71035	the Reverend David Campbell	190	" If it were neutral we would not complain . But does this prohibition extend to the priests of other religions ? No ! a thousand times , no ! It is only another instance of the fact , that we , who have the strongest claim on a Christian government-- "
71097	71100	71103	71104	Captain Dering	71	" Possibly , "
71106	71123	71103	71104	Captain Dering	71	" but I am only a soldier . I do not ask questions . I obey . "
71124	71131	71133	71134	Dr. Campbell	154	" And we are soldiers too , "
71138	71153	71133	71134	Dr. Campbell	154	" and our orders are to be instant in season and out of season . "
71208	71213	71203	71204	Mrs. Campbell	152	" if James approved . "
71271	71288	71289	71289	he	190	" It is a pity you have n't got Jean Ziska 's drum , Miss Shepherd , "
71292	71323	71289	71289	he	190	" By Jove ! how you would bang it ! Then , right or wrong , there would be a high old row , and that would just suit me ! "
71324	71330	71358	71358	He	190	" There can scarcely , Sir Lancelot,"--she
71345	71357	71358	71358	He	190	off,--"be a question as to right or wrong in this case . "
71367	71499	71358	71358	He	190	" There never can be , really , of course . One is bound to be right , the other wrong . The mischief is to know t'other from which ! Now I expect the sixty thousand nobles , and the grand - master who were left dead on the field , and the two thousand poor devils who got drowned in the river besides , and all the others -- you know about 'em , of course , and you must admit he was a bloodthirsty chap at any rate!--had got a musical instrument of some sort , too . You ca n't fight without a band , Miss Shepherd , specially drums and fifes . But Jean Ziska was blind ; so he could only hear his own music . "
71500	71508	71509	71509	she	2024	" And I hear it , too , "
71580	71594	71595	71595	he	2025	" That is n't it , anyhow , is it , Miss Shepherd ? "
71598	71762	71763	71763	he	2029	" I saw that drum - banger as I came past just now -- the funniest old dried stick of a Brahmin you ever set eyes on . And you know those ' round the mulberry bush , ' fairy - ring , endless circles of men and women hand in hand we used to cut out of newspaper when we were kids ? Well , he was using gilt paper , and trying to make a miracle out of the ' biz ' ! One god , he said , in many ; the outline being the same , and the eye of faith sufficient to fill in the details of divinity ! The people were buying them by dozens for the half of nothing . I asked 'em why , and they said as toys for their children . So I expect it will be the endless circle of boys and girls again -- don't you ? For , you know , "
71781	71827	71763	71763	he	2029	" I 've never been able to find out the least difference in kids . I talk to the little beggars when I 'm out shooting , you know , and -- well ! the boys are just as much boys as I used to be-- "
72029	72128	72129	72129	His	2034	" Captain Dering has just told me that we have to call you Sir Lancelot Carlyon . I am sorry for the cause , since your uncle was a man who made the world better by being in it;--as -- as you will . It is a fine old name , Sir Lancelot ! It carries with it a fine inheritance of honour ; therefore I can wish no better wish for the world , as well as for yourself , than that you may hand it on to your son . So , peace be with you ! "
72192	72196	72197	72197	he	2034	" Miss Shepherd , "
72201	72233	72197	72197	he	2034	" I have something I must say to you this afternoon . Come into the verandah , after you have done pouring out the tea , and let me say it . "
72282	72307	72309	72309	he	2034	" I , and I only , am responsible , Dr. Campbell . I gave the Commissioner the information on which he has acted , "
72316	72355	72356	72356	He	2034	" I have been fifty years at Eshwara ; fifty times have I seen the pilgrims pass to the ' Cradle of the Gods ' listening peacefully to your preaching . But this year there is something new . "
72377	72468	72356	72356	He	2034	" I can not quite tell what it is . There is something beyond the things I know , though these are many -- small , it is true , but cumulative . Still , this is certain ; the pulse of the people beats irregularly to - day , and that means danger to the body corporate . It may pass ; yet the faintest stimulus may upset the whole balance of the organism . So , my friends , as our cause is eternal , as we have time-- "
72469	72472	72474	72475	David Campbell	190	" Time ! "
72479	72523	72474	72475	David Campbell	190	" but now is the appointed time . Think , sir , how many of these poor deluded souls , striving after salvation , may die upon the road to their false gods -- none can know how many better than you , who-- "
72543	72546	72547	72547	he	190	" Yes ! "
72552	72639	72547	72547	he	190	" for I am very old . I have seen half a world die upon its road to the ' Cradle of the Gods . ' Die -- though we have not the courage to say so,--with their faces set to the eternal goal of humanity ; to the finding of something we have lost . And something keeps us all back . What is it ? Have we the secret more than they , who say , as we do , that it is sin ? "
72663	72680	72652	72653	Dr. Campbell	154	" We know we have . We have the certainty -- we are missionaries of that certainty-- "
72681	72692	72694	72695	Father Ninian	81	" And I -- to my shame be it said , "
72710	72744	72705	72705	he	81	" have never tried to make a convert ; therefore I can scarcely hope to persuade you ; but if , gentlemen , I might be allowed to talk the matter over with you-- "
72745	72751	72753	72754	Dr. Campbell	154	" A most sensible suggestion , "
72766	72794	72753	72754	Dr. Campbell	154	" I should be loth to act hastily , and give occasion to the scoffer . Mamma , will you send our tea into the dining room ? "
72846	72852	72831	72832	the dissentients	2041	" La Donna é mobile ; "
72858	72899	72831	72832	the dissentients	2041	" Cherchez la femme ! Depend upon it , Mrs. Campbell , there is a woman at the bottom of it . I know from personal experience that she is always fatal to my peace and pulse on any road . "
72929	72934	72936	72936	he	71	" Where'er you walk , "
72966	72971	72972	72972	he	71	" Miss Shepherd objects , "
72977	73030	72972	72972	he	71	" She does n't believe in men fighting for women . She scorned the offer of my sword in favour -- excuse me for having overheard -- of some drum or another . What was it , Miss Shepherd ? I really only heard Lance say you would like to bang it . "
73038	73062	73031	73031	Erda	105	" I was only alluding to Jean Ziska 's drum , which was sounded to call the Hosts of the Lord to arms . "
73072	73076	73077	73077	she	152	" My dear , "
73080	73128	73077	73077	she	152	" why can ye not leave that gruesome tale alone ? For it 's just an awful tale , Mrs. Smith . As if he could not be content with doing his duty in this life , but must leave his skin behind for the next generation . "
73129	73143	73145	73155	the sharp - voiced lady who owned the small black coat	2043	" We have biblical warranty for that sort of thing , Mrs. Campbell , "
73157	73163	73145	73155	the sharp - voiced lady who owned the small black coat	2043	" Elijah left his mantle . "
73164	73167	73169	73170	Mrs. Campbell	152	" Hoots ! "
73174	73253	73169	73170	Mrs. Campbell	152	" We all have to leave our body - wear , but a skin 's different altogether . It sou'd just have gone to the grave with him , honest man , dust to dust , ashes to ashes . I 've often heard Dr. James say there was nothing in the world for tying the hands o ' the leevin ' like dead men 's dispositions . They 're just a mortification indeed to a ' concerned . "
73609	73614	73615	73615	he	68	" Do you see ? "
73623	73635	73619	73619	Erda	105	" From the great deep to the great deep he goes . "
73666	73669	73670	73670	she	105	" Yes ! "
73685	73696	73670	73670	she	105	" bound by gold chains about the feet of God . "
73712	73722	73723	73723	he	68	" I thought I had something to tell you , "
73726	73739	73723	73723	he	68	" but I think you know it already , do n't you ? "
73740	73743	73744	73744	she	105	" Yes ! "
73755	73761	73762	73762	He	68	" I think I do . "
73778	73784	73762	73762	He	68	" King of the Dead , "
73787	73825	73762	73762	He	68	" Then that ends it so -- so far as I am concerned . But it remains as an excuse for my asking a question . Miss Shepherd , why are you going to marry your cousin ? "
73833	73840	73841	73841	she	105	" For a great many reasons , "
73873	73887	73888	73888	He	68	" To begin with , it has been the dream of my life . "
73900	73907	73908	73908	She	105	" What ! to marry him ? "
73912	73977	73978	73978	Her	105	" No ! To work -- to help -- to give my sympathy -- to stand hand in hand with someone who , as he does , gives himself , as I do , to the great work . To someone whose life will be mine -- whom I can respect and admire and -- and love -- in the best sense of the word-- "
74004	74080	73992	73992	Lance	68	" Yes ! I quite understand . But what has that to do with marrying him ? How will the -- the great Work be furthered by your having to look after the house and all that ? And it is n't as if you could n't give the help and sympathy without marrying a fellow . Even the love -- at least I think so . Now , I want to marry you , because-- "
74081	74083	74084	74084	she	105	" Yes,-- "
74104	74162	74163	74163	he	68	" Because , to begin with , it does n't seem possible for me to live my life -- I mean my everyday life , trying to rub along , you know , without doing any harm ; keeping things going as -- as my people have always kept them , unless you help me . And then-- "
74165	74176	74177	74177	he	68	again--"from the first moment I saw you , you reminded me-- "
74226	74242	74243	74243	he	68	" I do n't suppose anyone had a happier , jollier childhood than I had , "
74247	74262	74243	74243	he	68	" though I was an orphan . I lived at Tregarthen , you know . "
74274	74389	74263	74263	He	68	" You should have seen my grandfather and grandmother , Miss Shepherd . They were like the double Christmas number of an illustrated paper ! She used to boast that she never saw a naughty child ; and she never did , for the dear old lady always walked out of the room promptly when we tried it on . I remember it used to take the starch out awfully , having no audience . But it was the same in everything . It beat even a boy to be really bad in that house , somehow . Yes ! we had jolly times ! You would have liked it -- you would like it now"--he
74396	74435	74436	74436	he	2064	hands--"Come to it!--Come , and be Lady Carlyon as she was ! People may say all that means nothing , but it means everything to a woman to be able to count on an inheritance like that for her-- "
74463	74482	74483	74483	his	2064	" I 've said nothing of my love -- you know all that -- and I think -- Yes-- "
74489	74502	74483	74483	his	2064	certainty--"I think you -- you like me well enough -- don't you ? "
74526	74536	74537	74537	she	2067	" I like you very much , Sir Lancelot , "
74553	74573	74537	74537	she	2067	" but , as you told me just now , that is no reason why I should marry you . "
74574	74587	74588	74588	he	2064	" It is at least as good as yours for marrying him , "
74593	74676	74588	74588	he	2064	" At least it has to do with you -- with me -- with our happiness -- with mine at any rate ! Do you remember when you first told me your name -- The World 's Desire I called it -- the woman with the red - gold hair , the red - gold hem to her garment , the red - gold apple in her hand -- you are that to me -- Erda ! give me my heart 's desire-- "
74700	74713	74714	74714	she	2068	" Yes ! it has to do with you , with me ! "
74718	74724	74714	74714	she	2068	" but only we two . "
74725	74727	74728	74728	he	2064	" No!-- "
74729	74736	74714	74714	she	2068	interrupted--"with more than that , surely ! "
74778	74789	74773	74774	Father Ninian	81	" I can wish no better wish for the world ! "
74838	74842	74843	74843	she	2068	" Sir Lancelot , "
74848	74856	74843	74843	she	2068	" I am very sensible of the honour-- "
74857	74865	74866	74866	he	2064	" Don't -- for heaven 's sake , "
74869	74878	74866	74866	he	2064	" That is -- excuse me -- bunkum . "
74892	74900	74901	74901	she	2068	" I am , all the same , "
74904	74929	74930	74930	she	2068	" but it is impossible . Perhaps if I did not look forward as I do ; perhaps if I only sought happiness ; but-- "
74943	74966	74967	74967	Lance	68	face--"I am sworn to another work -- the noblest work of all -- to bring light to those that sit in darkness . "
74978	74990	74991	74991	he	2064	" You leave me out in the black night , anyhow , "
75071	75077	75079	75080	Mrs. Smith	75	" The search - light ! "
75089	75129	75130	75130	she	75	" Eugene will be so pleased . He could n't positively swallow a mouthful at lunch because , when he thought all was right , something went wrong . That 's why he did n't come , Miss Shepherd , "
75145	75178	75130	75130	she	75	" I positively could n't tear him away , but I made him promise to turn the thing on here if he succeeded . And he has . Is n't it splendid ? "
75184	75223	75179	75180	Mrs. Campbell	152	" It 's just too much like the last day , comin ' unawares , and makin ' a ' things manifest , for my taste . An ' I wonder what Dr. James will say to it ? "
75224	75235	75237	75238	Vincent Dering	71	" I wonder what the natives will say to it ? "
75245	75248	75250	75252	the tart lady	2076	" Say ! "
75254	75277	75250	75252	the tart lady	2076	" I know what they should say -- that , of course , we know a great deal more than they do . "
75278	75283	75179	75180	Mrs. Campbell	152	" And , besides , "
75291	75310	75179	75180	Mrs. Campbell	152	" it is so beautifully , suggestively true . We have the light , we can light them . "
75311	75321	75323	75324	Laila Bonaventura	86	" Oh ! but that is such a bother , "
75331	75358	75323	75324	Laila Bonaventura	86	" I hate having to see things I do n't care to see . I much prefer to have my own candle , do n't you ? "
75403	75425	75394	75394	He	1606	" It will be pleasanter by and by , wo n't it ? We must settle the time before you leave . "
75426	75430	75432	75433	Muriel Smith	151	" What time ? "
75473	75476	75478	75478	Vincent	71	" Time ! "
75482	75503	75478	75478	Vincent	71	" Of that new song , of course . Come in , Miss Bonaventura , let us decide about it . "
75513	75537	75504	75505	The girl	481	" I should think a twelve beat would be best , really . It is safer when there are so many accidental notes . "
75848	75857	75836	75836	Erda	105	" Did you assent to that , David ? "
75858	75863	75864	75864	he	81	" I suggested it , "
75879	75930	75931	75931	he	81	" It appeared to me to meet the exigencies of the case admirably , and it will be very useful , let me tell you , at home . It will emphasize the difficulties and dangers we have to contend against . It will show our meek reasonableness , and then-- "
75937	75979	75931	75931	he	81	smile--"it seems to me such a beautiful idea that the only result of this attempt to gag us will be that the thousands of poor benighted souls will have a chance of hearing the Truth in many places instead of one . "
76001	76017	75981	75981	Erda	105	" I think it cowardly ; I would fight -- if I were a man . "
76018	76027	76029	76030	Vincent Dering	71	" You would beat Jean Ziska 's drum ! "
76070	76090	76098	76098	he	71	" You refused my sword just now , Miss Shepherd , so I place my drumstick at your disposal . "
76147	76154	76134	76134	he	71	" Oh ! dem golden slippers ! "
76188	76196	76198	76202	the people in the courtyard	2094	" They are singing in the missen , "
76221	76239	76198	76202	the people in the courtyard	2094	" It is not wise to listen ; folk become as they are , if they do . "
76345	76352	76396	76396	He	71	" Oh ! dem golden slippers ! "
77318	77327	77273	77274	the pilgrims	3444	" Hârî ! Hârâ ! Hârâ ! Hârî ! "
77351	77360	77273	77274	the pilgrims	3444	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! Hârî ! Hârâ ! "
77501	77510	77484	77484	theirs	2130	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! Hârî ! Hârâ ! "
78776	78781	78783	78783	Vincent	71	" No , thanks ! "
78787	78824	78783	78783	Vincent	71	" there 's enough electricity in the air to - night without that . I believe your machine has leaked , Smith ! I feel as if I should give out sparks if anyone touched me ! "
79651	79654	79655	79655	she	2218	" Nay ! "
79660	79726	79655	79655	she	2218	" If , as thou sayest she will , she brings me more dresses and jewels , she may call me Begum , and hint at my being one , really , a thousand times over ! Why not ? Begum and Princess are the same , and my great - grandmother in Italy was that . Pidar Narâyan told me so to - day . "
79940	79948	79976	79976	God	96	" Golden feet upon a golden stair . "
80077	80082	80105	80105	her	86	" statue of pure gold "
80993	81000	81001	81001	his	110	" Gereeb - pun - wâs , "
81173	81307	81164	81164	he	89	" I have settled it . Before dawn to - morrow -- not this dawn , that is too nigh on us now -- but the next , thou shalt let me into the garden . Thou knowest the little balcony which was not lit up ? I will stay there , waiting , till she come for an early walk among the flowers . That can be managed . Then , if the coast is clear , we can meet and talk . If not , there is no harm done , for I can slip into the stream and swim back . That will be best , since it is not possible by day , and at night the mems do not receive visitors , as we do , without reproach . "
81340	81347	81348	81348	she	86	" What 's in a dress ? "
81351	81359	81348	81348	she	86	" it is no part of me ! "
81409	81422	81423	81423	she	86	" But trust me , gentleman , I 'll prove more true , "
81426	81437	81423	81423	she	86	" than those who have more cunning to be strange . "
81438	81441	81442	81442	he	71	" Juliet ! "
81453	81456	81442	81442	he	71	" Juliet ! "
81476	81485	81423	81423	she	86	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! Hârî ! Hârâ ! "
81889	81898	81899	81899	he	2290	" Yes ! I had a jolly day , "
81903	81946	81899	81899	he	2290	" The dear old Heath was looking just as it always did . It was like being born again to come back to the whole caboodle -- Aunt Sallies , Tommy Dods , Welshers , and the lot -- and then the enclosure-- "
82068	82077	82042	82042	them	2285	" Hârî ! Hârâ ! Hârâ ! Hârî ! "
82160	82169	82181	82182	the multitude	2297	" Stand back , please ! Not yet ! "
82220	82233	82235	82237	the other Englishman	2298	" I wish those devils of priests would turn on the tap , "
82242	82245	82247	82249	the first speaker	3896	" Yes ! "
82251	82291	82292	82292	He	3896	" if you are on duty , next year , I 'd insist on the curtain being rung up at the bill time . It is rough on the audience ; especially when they do n't cat - call ! "
82342	82354	82292	82292	He	3896	" rumpa - tum - tum - rumpa - tum - tum "
82455	82468	82500	82508	the man who had just come out from England	2304	" Hârî ! Hârâ ! Life - Death - Creator - Destroyer ! "
82469	82498	82512	82512	He	2304	" Something must have gone wrong with the ball - cock , and as usual , the plumber will be ' in directly from another little job , ' "
82605	82614	82616	82616	his	2304	" Stand back , please ! not yet ! "
82830	82931	82826	82828	another English face	2320	" There 's something up -- God knows what -- the Commissioner feared a row , you know . You 'd better go to the Fort and ask Dering to send us down every man he can ; men , you understand , not sabres -- as yet . And tell Pidar Narâyan , he 's a host in himself with these pilgrims,--Ramanund too , you might get him,--we want anyone who can help the crowd to keep its temper , though I do n't expect he 'd be much good -- and there 's no one else . Inspector ! "
82948	83019	83020	83020	he	2321	" leave that in charge of Govinda and Suchet -- Stay ! Shiv - deo will be better ; he is a high - caste Brahmin . And you go and send every twice - born constable you 've got , and can trust , to every alley and street that leads here ; for there will be an awful crush when those in front do n't move on . And-- "
83026	83062	83063	83063	he	2321	thought--"have we anyone connected with the temple priests , someone they can trust ? Ah ! Annant , of course,--the very man ! Send him to find out if there is anything really wrong ; and-- "
83068	83118	83063	83063	he	2321	" if it is anything to do with the siphon , or whatever it is , get workmen and set it straight -- pour water down -- anything ! Only there must be a miracle . And be quick . If this crowd gets impatient -- God help it ! "
83149	83153	83154	83154	he	2321	" And mind , "
83157	83168	83154	83154	he	2321	" no truncheons drawn till I myself give the order . "
83252	83259	83261	83262	the latter	336	" Not yet ! Stand back ! "
83311	83316	83318	83319	big Govinda	253	" Lo ! brother , "
83333	83353	83327	83327	he	253	" have patience awhile . Give the Gods time . There is not water to wash a babe yet . "
83389	83394	83395	83395	he	253	" Nay , Govinda , "
83398	83411	83395	83395	he	253	" let the beggar in . He seeks but to drown vermin . "
83463	83472	83492	83494	a forward crowd	2335	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! Hârî ! Hârâ ! "
83522	83526	83528	83529	the Englishman	2336	" Look out ! "
83626	83643	83659	83660	a washerman	2343	" Brahmins first , washerman ! Thy sort can bathe in the suds of our clothes ! "
83814	83823	83775	83778	a big burly devotee	2348	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! Hârâ ! Hârî ! "
83886	83891	83893	83895	the police officer	2321	" Not enough pressure ! "
83943	83953	83916	83916	he	2321	" Halt ! by your right -- single file ! "
84043	84060	84062	84064	the police officer	2321	" Send four of your men to clear the mud from the crevices of the stones , "
84073	84089	84062	84064	the police officer	2321	" it will serve to keep the crowd amused till Dering brings his men down . "
84116	84119	84120	84120	they	2360	" Surely , "
84126	84144	84120	84120	they	2360	" if the Masters took the job in hand , the Gods must needs send the water . "
84145	84150	84152	84154	Shiv - deo	144	" Of a surety ! "
84160	84201	84152	84154	Shiv - deo	144	" Do not the Gods always befriend the bold ? Do not we , of Harriana , find the sacred river which the devils hid , though we have to dig three - hundred - feet wells to find it ? "
84314	84324	84326	84326	Lance	68	" I wish someone would stop that cursed drum , "
84330	84343	84344	84344	he	68	" it 's enough to give anyone the fidgets . I feel myself-- "
84483	84494	84496	84502	the man responsible for peace and order	2376	" I hope they 'll get through without using them , "
84504	84551	84496	84502	the man responsible for peace and order	2376	" but , steady ! please , in case of a rush . Remember that if we yield more foot - room , someone must fall ; then there will be the devil to pay . At present they are so tight packed they ca n't . "
84661	84667	84668	84668	he	84	" Patience , my children ! "
84672	84688	84668	84668	he	84	" Tarry ye the Lord 's leisure ! Let Him do what seemeth Him good ! "
84877	84883	84885	84885	Vincent	71	" And wo n't be , "
84902	84933	84885	84885	Vincent	71	" They are most likely in the plot ; one of them , at any rate , was going up the Hâri in a dug - out late last night . "
84934	84940	84943	84943	Lance	68	" Not Am - ma , "
84945	84975	84943	84943	Lance	68	" He started before that to go up the Hâra and pilot down a raft for the forest officer . I met him as I came back to dinner . "
84976	84998	85000	85002	the police officer	2321	" Well , he is not get - at - able anyhow , and that 's all we have to consider , "
85004	85030	85000	85002	the police officer	2321	" Briefly , the miracle is off the bill . Now , how the deuce are we to get the audience to go away peacefully ? "
85031	85050	85052	85052	Ramanund	163	" Perhaps if I , as a fellow - countryman , and a Brahmin , were to address them-- "
85103	85114	85115	85115	he	3467	" You can not argue with that , my son ! "
85131	85192	85115	85115	he	3467	" No one of your sort ever has , in all the history of the world . That does not reason . It feels . Show it another miracle , and it will worship . Give it a cause , and it will espouse it . Give it a lead , and it will follow ; but words -- never ! "
85193	85210	85213	85215	the police officer	2321	" Well , I hope to God no one will supply it with the wrong lead ! "
85217	85246	85213	85215	the police officer	2321	" For the rest , we must hold the fort , I suppose . Inspector ! when is the show -- the miracle , I mean,--supposed to end ? "
85247	85254	85256	85257	the man	3467	" Not till sunset , sir , "
85261	85275	85276	85276	He	3467	" And it 's now about six , I suppose . Eleven hours ! "
85286	85324	85276	85276	He	3467	" Yes ! I 'll last through . Inspector ! Close your men in , and let them stand at ease . Captain Dering , if you can spare yours till then , I shall be obliged . "
85325	85352	85377	85377	he	247	" Certainly . I left a troop with Roshan Khân , and orders to send word of any disturbance ; and I wired to Dillon in case-- "
85359	85369	85370	85370	He	247	" There is no fear till this is settled . "
85395	85400	85377	85377	he	247	" Hârâ ! Hârî ! "
85593	85605	85607	85609	the police officer	2321	" I 'll take a biscuit in my pocket next time , "
85634	85650	85652	85652	he	2321	" Inspector ! send your men to quarters , and let them eat their food . "
85664	85672	85673	85673	he	2321	" It might have been full up , "
85676	85705	85708	85709	Father Ninian--"I	256	" We could n't have stopped them for a moment if they had had any sort of a lead over . And from what you told the Commissioner , sir,"--he
85709	85715	85768	85768	he	1250	Ninian--"I was afraid of one . "
85730	85735	85736	85736	he	1250	" So was I , "
85739	85765	85736	85736	he	1250	" but I was mistaken , so far . Still , there is danger in the air . I feel it . I hear it . "
86206	86220	86201	86202	Father Ninian	247	" I can wish no better wish for you and for the world , "
86492	86515	86516	86516	She	105	" Was not Lance right ? Was not this the essence ? Was it not everything to be sure of the inheritance ? "
88109	88135	88137	88137	she	481	" All straight folds -- the sunshine on your hair , and a red - gold apple in your hand -- the World 's Desire ! "
88315	88318	88319	88319	he	2525	" Huzoor ! "
88329	88345	88319	88319	he	2525	" I have been waiting the Huzoor 's pleasure . The Presence will go whither ? "
88388	88393	88375	88375	She	481	" Lance ! Lance ! "
88394	88403	88405	88407	Am - ma	131	" Whither did the Miss - sahiba say ? "
88418	88432	88375	88375	She	481	" To Eshwara -- where else does the river go -- where else ? "
88494	88532	88533	88533	She	481	" So , straight to the centre , Huzoor ! I have placed the seat correctly . That is right ! The Miss - sahiba recollects the old rules ; we shall be in Eshwara before dawn ! "

88763	88770	88771	88771	he	131	" The Miss - sahiba forgets , "
88775	88803	88771	88771	he	131	" When one is in the stream there is no change possible ; but if the place is not right we can alter it at the ferry . "
89045	89049	89050	89050	she	481	" Be quick ! "
89066	89094	89050	89050	she	481	" I want to get there as soon as possible . I must , or something worse may happen . There is n't a moment to spare ! "
89111	89117	89118	89118	he	3733	" Did they kill anyone ? "
89125	89156	89118	89118	he	3733	" Did the prisoners escape as it was arranged ? And was it Carlone - sahib they killed?--they swore it should be he , because he laughed at the miracle . "
89157	89167	89168	89168	she	481	" The prisoners -- Carlone - sahib -- killed ! "
89217	89230	89231	89231	she	481	" I have had no news from Eshwara , Am - ma , "
89235	89258	89231	89231	she	481	" what is this about prisoners escaping , and the sahib - logue being killed ? Who was going to do that ? "
89265	89310	89231	89231	she	481	" I thought the Huzoor had heard -- that that was why she was going . It is nothing . Idle talk . It is always talk . And the Huzoors have the Dee - puk - râg . They must still be kings . "
89311	89316	89317	89317	she	481	" Am - ma , "
89321	89348	89317	89317	she	481	" you must tell me about this . If you do not , I will take my hand off your son 's head -- I will never-- "
89358	89360	89361	89361	he	131	" Huzoor "
89365	89412	89361	89361	he	131	" it is talk , idle talk . It is always so . All day long , and all night long in the bazaars , and the Masters have the Dee - puk - râg . There is no fear ; but this slave will tell . "
89798	89806	89807	89807	she	2561	" When shall we get to Eshwara ? "
89810	89825	89832	89832	he	131	" At the turn of the night and day if the river is kind , "
89955	89960	89961	89961	she	2561	" Am - ma , "
89964	90013	89961	89961	she	2561	" I will give you fifty rupees , and keep my hand on the son 's head , if you will leave the raft here , and take me as quick as you can to Eshwara -- to the little steps below the fort -- fifty whole rupees ! "
90028	90044	90045	90045	he	131	" We should not go so fast , Huzoor , now the slide is near , "
90048	90149	90045	90045	he	131	" for , see you , the raft is the wood - sahib 's new shape . It is a good shape ; it came down the rapids above the valley like a boat , faster than this , when the paddle can not be used . It will take us with it . I will fasten this behind , and steer . Then in the slacker water when the paddle is possible , we will leave it ; if the Miss - sahiba is in a hurry . But there is none . The Huzoors are Light - bringers . "
90188	90195	90196	90196	he	131	" It shall do the work , "
90229	90271	90225	90225	he	131	" Lo ! who would grudge men 's brains to the Masters when they are clever as the Gods themselves ? The Miss will see how fast this goes . We shall be at Eshwara before the night turns to day . "
90289	90299	90300	90300	she	2577	" That is when the prisoners were to escape ? "
90312	90323	90324	90324	he	131	" So many things happen in the fight of Dawn , "
90643	90669	90670	90670	he	84	" If it were not so early in the year , I should predict a dust - storm -- a real electrical dust - storm , "
90744	90759	90736	90736	his	68	" Perhaps that is it . I 've felt choking all day -- horrid ! "
90764	90879	90760	90761	Vincent Dering	71	" I do n't choke -- I tingle ; and it is rather jolly . Yes , sir ; there is a lot of electricity in the air , and I should n't wonder if we had a regular black snorter . Glad it did n't come in the middle of the miracle ' biz ' , for , as a general smasher - up of ordinary experiences , commend me to a real electrical dust - storm ! It seems to attract the earth , earthy , in everything . In fact , if there is such a thing as the Devil , and he ever gets the upper hand , it is then-- "
90908	90915	90916	90916	he	247	ones--"Then I trust , my son , "
90920	90933	90916	90916	he	247	" that for your sake and theirs the storm may not come . "
90934	90944	90946	90947	Captain Dering	71	" Or that there is n't a Satanic majesty ! "
90951	90965	90966	90966	Lance	68	" That , sir , is the easiest way out of the difficulty . "
90975	90982	90983	90983	he	68	" Well ! if there is , "
90986	91007	91008	91008	He	68	" and I had to paint him , I 'd take that man 's face as my model for Lucifer . "

91054	91063	91065	91065	Vincent	71	" Looks a bad lot , I admit , "
91069	91125	91126	91126	he	71	" Have an idea I 've seen him before ; in gaol , I believe . Yes ! I 'm sure of it . He is the fellow Dillon told me was going to get his ticket - of - leave for good conduct . He looks scoundrel enough for that ! But really , sir-- "
91131	91141	91142	91142	He	247	again--"I think we may count on their behaviour now . "
91147	91219	91142	91142	He	247	" If there was going to be a row it would have come off before this ; now they will settle down , you 'll see , and go on to the next camping - ground to - morrow morning as if nothing had gone wrong . They are such creatures of habit ; you could see that from their sticking on in expectation of that footling old miracle all day ! "
91252	91258	91259	91259	he	247	" They will settle down , "
91263	91297	91259	91259	he	247	" if nothing new crops up to give them a lead into new ways . That is always the danger ; and a very small thing does it , sometimes , in India . "
91366	91374	91376	91376	Vincent	71	" Who the deuce are those fellows ? "
91421	91465	91466	91466	His	2606	" I 'll talk to Roshan about that . He was complaining only this morning that the men were breaking out of barracks . What else can he expect if he does n't look out . By Jove ! I 'll teach 'em ! "
91575	91590	91592	91592	Lance	68	" Roshan looks in a demon bad temper . I wonder what 's up ? "
91671	91686	91688	91689	Captain Dering	71	" He has been sulky as a bear with me these last few days , "
91696	91741	91688	91689	Captain Dering	71	" I believe the old Colonel was right after all , and coming here has put wind in his head . I shall have to teach Mr. Roshan that , good man as he is , he is only a risaldar , before long . "
91742	91746	91748	91748	Lance	68	" Poor devil , "
91753	91781	91748	91748	Lance	68	" I 'm always a bit sorry for Roshan . He would be a fine fellow -- if -- if he was n't so -- so civilized . "
91782	91785	91787	91787	Vincent	71	" Civilized , "
91793	91819	91820	91820	He	68	" You have n't seen him fight . I have . Talk of devils ; he has got one in him , if you like ! "
92840	92846	92866	92866	he	68	" There they ate a missionary-- "
93041	93056	93058	93058	Lance	68	" They never do till the next day ; Pidar Narâyan told me so , "
93062	93106	93107	93107	He	71	" Why should they rake us up at such an unearthly hour ? Why ca n't they let the people have a row if they want one ? I 'd like it ; give a fellow something to do in this beastly hole . "

97535	97540	97528	97528	he	2787	" Dillon must be warned-- "
97541	97552	97553	97553	she	105	" And perhaps Captain Dering will be back by then , "
97658	97666	97668	97668	Lance	68	" I hope to God he may , "
97840	97855	97856	97856	She	481	" What are you going to do , if Dr. Dillon does n't hear ? "
98016	98024	98025	98025	she	481	" But if he does n't hear , "
98028	98041	98042	98042	He	68	" you will have to go down the river and warn him . "
98168	98175	98176	98176	she	105	" There , that 's done ! "
98193	98199	98191	98191	Lance	68	into--"All right , await you . "
98200	98210	98191	98191	Lance	68	" Now ! what is to be done next ? "

98262	98265	98266	98266	he	68	" Sentry ! "

98464	98500	98461	98461	she	105	" There is a sentry outside -- I saw his feet . Come away , and let us settle what to do . And say something , something angry -- you know what I mean . "
98501	98506	98508	98508	Lance	68	" Damn that brute ! "
98517	98540	98508	98508	Lance	68	" where the deuce has the sentry gone to ? I 'll have it out with him to - morrow , the infernal-- "
98562	98568	98569	98569	she	105	" That 's quite enough , "
98598	98606	98607	98607	she	105	" Now what 's to be done ? "
98623	98629	98607	98607	she	105	" Let 's think hard . "
98879	98891	98892	98892	she	105	" You had better take my place with Am - ma , "
98896	98920	98892	98892	she	105	" Go down stream to the spit , cut across by the mission house , and chance getting over to the police camp . "
99018	99022	99023	99023	he	89	" But you , "
99025	99051	99023	99023	he	89	" I 'll stay here . They wo n't try to come in -- yet a while . I am not afraid of being alone . "
99052	99061	99062	99062	he	89	" I would n't mind your being alone , "
99066	99070	99062	99062	he	89	" but my Sikhs-- "
99074	99078	99062	99062	he	89	" she echoed . "
99086	99087	99088	99088	They	2821	" "
99099	99114	99088	99088	They	2821	" --His words -- both their words -- jostled each other in sheer haste . "
99123	99124	99121	99121	you	89	them?"-- "
99161	99162	99121	99121	you	89	" --"Nothing
99164	99229	99121	99121	you	89	" she echoed , almost savagely , as she clasped and unclasped her hands , dragging the fingers through each other , in sheer straining after some thought on which to clutch , in cruel whipping and spurring of her wits against that inaction . Nothing ! Nothing ! The word seemed to fill the world . Nothing in earth or air or fire or-- "
99232	99240	99121	99121	you	89	" she cried , with a gasp . "
99276	99294	99267	99267	It	4626	" He stared at her as she stood in her white , and scarlet , and gold . "
99298	99302	99304	99304	Jove	76	" he said softly "
99311	99393	99304	99304	Jove	76	" The next instant he was off to rouse his men , and she was on the bottom step giving Am - ma his orders , short , sharp , clear . But when Lance came back again to look out what arms and ammunition he could lay hands on , he found her , in his room , sorting cartridges as if she had done it all her life ; and her face turned to him all aglow and splendid . "
99429	99444	99425	99425	I	0	wrong,"--though her woman 's tongue sought speech , her woman 's hands stuck to their work--"but
99456	99457	99451	99451	I	0	" "
99463	99468	99458	99458	You	0	" he said simply . "
99471	99475	99451	99451	I	0	" she echoed . "
99513	99544	99508	99508	I	0	" She looked it , as , when all was ready , she leant , straining her eyes into the darkness for a hint of Am - ma 's return . "
99549	99555	99556	99556	he	2834	" she muttered to herself , "
99560	99669	99508	99508	I	0	" And he did . A bigger wave came sweeping up to the wall as a herald , and then a voice calling for a rope . Half a dozen were ready posted in the men 's hands from various points of vantage . They flew outwards ; one , from Am - ma 's hands inwards to a group holding a lantern on the steps . So , with a silent haul , the pioneers had the raft stopped , and sidling slowly back to mooring against the wall . Then Lance turned to Erda hesitating , divided between his loyalty to Vincent , and to her . "
99677	99680	99508	99508	I	0	" he said briefly--"if
99706	99740	99703	99703	you	2838	" She gave a look round on the men , eager with the sudden excitement , with the rush , with the very novelty of it all , and laughed -- positively laughed . "
99779	101092	101093	101093	Laila	86	" Yet , despite this absolute lack of fear , despite the fact that she evidently wanted and desired no more consideration than a man , Lance felt a wild dislike to leaving her there alone , as he stepped on to Am - ma 's skin craft , and , edging his way along by the wall , prepared to drift down to the palace balcony . It was mirk dark now , and he had no fear of being seen by the crowd on the bathing steps and the courtyard , though he punted his way with the paddle shaft within a yard or two of the shore ; for he wanted to judge how far excitement had spread , how far the crowd was aware of what was coming at dawn . To judge by appearances , not at all . There was no more restlessness , no more movement than was inevitable in such a concourse of men , women , and children . Here and there files of shadowy forms drifted about , but the most of them , seen by the little lights set on the ground beside each group , were in heaps , like the heaps of dead on a battle - field , huddled up on each other , sleeping , resting , indistinguishable , shrouded in their shawls , waiting for the dawn to come . And , above the soft , yet increasing murmur of the still windless storm , came a softer murmuring of prayers , a weird low chanting . The Hosts of the Lord had not yet risen to battle . The Spirit had not moved ; the Word had not been made manifest . The palace , also , lay as yet undisturbed , unseen , in the darkness . Except for a glimmer of red light just above the river , a paler glimmer closer at hand . The red light must be by the stairs for which he was steering . The other?-- He did not know , but as he slipped past it another murmuring as of prayer seemed to come from within . It must come from the chapel ; if so , then Pidar Narâyan must be awake also . He felt a certain relief at the thought when he caught sight of the canoe at the bottom of the steps . Then Vincent , as he had feared , was there ; but not on the errand he had feared , if Pidar Narâyan knew of it . So , mooring his strange craft to the canoe , he ran up the stairs eagerly . Father Ninian had been awake all night . He had been vaguely uneasy all day , conscious , with that fine perception of his , that something was amiss . But it was no fear of what might happen which had kept him watching when others slept . It was the memory of something which had happened ; for , by a coincidence that for more than fifty years had never lost its mystical significance for Ninian Bruce -- sentimentalist as he was to his finger tips -- the night of the Vaisakh festival , when the pilgrims watched for the dawn to guide them on their way to the ' Cradle of the Gods , ' was to him , personally , the saddest and gladdest of the whole year . Since it was the night on which he had sinned the great sin of his life , and repented of it , even in the sinning . And that sinning , that repenting , was no slight thing to him . It was the man himself ; for the passion that was in him in his youth was in him in his old age . It had only changed its dwelling - place . It had fled from the senses , and found refuge in the emotions . In a way , indeed , by thus seeking freedom from it , he had fallen into a greater thraldom , so that his whole life had been as much swayed by this renunciation of a woman as it would have been by her possession . Old as he was , this very night had brought him -- with the thought that Death could not delay much longer , and that next Vaisakh festival might find him no lonely watcher -- that thrill of self - absorption in another self , that claim for all , which is the essence of passion . For this woman , waiting for him in the land where there is no marrying or giving in marriage , was still a woman ; still the one of all God 's creatures whom he claimed , and who claimed him , even as the first woman claimed the first man in Paradise . So he had passed the night watches of the Festival of Spring : as he had always passed them . Partly in his room , that room made holy by her presence in his heart , partly in the chapel , made holy by the Bodily Presence of Him for Whose sake he had renounced her . The two holinesses were inextricably mixed in Pidar Narâyan 's mind . He had finished one of the masses for the repose of a sinning yet sainted soul , and , before repeating the next , was confessing his own repentance in his room , when that hasty footstep along the passage , which alarmed those two lovers in the balcony nearer the garden , had resounded through the arches . It had disturbed , but not startled him , its very boldness reassuring him of its right to be there . Probably it was some messenger from the police camp or the Fort . So he had risen from his knees calmly and passed into the chapel , which lay between his room and the balcony , in order to see who it could be . For the candles were lit on the Altar and sent a faint light into the vaulted passage beyond . It was as he paused , in passing , to do homage to that Bodily Presence upon the Altar , which was ready -- as he was in his robes -- for the service of love which was to him , as a priest , his duty , as a man a joy unspeakable , that the pistol - shot came clamouring through the arches , followed by those despairing cries . What they were he could not distinguish , but that they were urgent was unmistakable , and had he been young as he had been on that night long years ago in the balcony above the pale flood of the Tiber , he could not have been quicker to reach the armoury , seize the long rapier , which he had not used , save in play , since those ruffling days in Rome , and run out into the wide , dim passage whence the sound had reached him . None too soon ! Someone was already flying down it . He pulled himself up for attack , but the figure ere he could lunge at it was past him , desperate , indifferent , flinging him against the wall as it continued its reckless way to the outer door , where , with swift opening and closing , it disappeared into the crowded courtyard , out of sight -- beyond recall ! He stood for a moment , stupefied . What was Roshan Khân doing there ? For that faint light from the Altar had given him a glimpse of a familiar , dark face , Roshan Khân 's without a doubt ! "
101097	101441	101095	101095	Laila	86	" The cry was clearer this time and the blood left his fine old face in sudden doubt as he turned swiftly to his left . Turned , and saw a faint red glow through an arch far down the passage . That was the arch leading down into the balcony that was never lit up -- that was never to be lit up because of something that had happened there long ago -- because of the something which had begun a tragedy . Why was it lit up ? A stronger fear caught at his heart . Could Laila?--No!--impossible ! He ran on , and the next moment was realizing that some tragedy had ended in that balcony . But what ? Who was the woman in native dress who stood with a man 's arm around her -- a man in a scarlet and gold mess jacket ? Ah!--that was Captain Dering , undoubtedly . But the woman ? The woman in scarlet and gold also -- God in Heaven!--had the dead-- As he stared , the long , supple limbs , so clearly outlined under their cunningly contrived draperies , seemed to lose themselves in the colour , the glitter of rich stuff ; one white arm , losing its hold on a cuff of scarlet and gold , swung back helplessly , and Vincent Dering , with a passionate entreaty to his darling not to be afraid , to look up , and tell him where she was hurt , sank to one knee the better to support what he held . And so the face , tilted backwards over his shoulder , came in view . Laila ! For an instant Ninian Bruce stood bewildered . Then all his youth , the pride of birth , the dash , and the fire which had made that youth what it had been , rose up in him . The blood surged back to his face in wild anger , in savage sense of insult , and desire for revenge . "
101446	101457	101444	101444	you	2842	" he cried , clenching his hand on his sword . "
101483	101524	101468	101468	you	2842	" Vincent , who at the first word had given a hurried glance to see who the speaker was , then returned to his task with the indifference of one absolutely preoccupied , held up his hand passionately against more . "
101540	101545	101537	101538	old man	4506	" he cried recklessly . "
101565	101602	101563	101563	him	2845	" His one trembling hand , for the other was round her , supporting her , was busy with the quaint , jewelled clasps of the scented corselet , which was crimsoning deeper with another dye . "
101610	101616	101563	101563	him	2845	" he muttered , half to himself,--"too
101622	101855	101856	101857	This slave	4971	" The words seemed to stun his hearer into silence . He stood bewildered . Too late for what ? And now , roused by that pistol - shot also , another old man , who had carefully hidden himself away from the possibility of being found by Roshan Khân , on the rage for an impossible interview ; who had counted , with malicious cunning , on the cooling effect of a useless waiting in the garden till dawn should make it necessary for hot - blooded lovers to return to the Fort , stole like a thief to the balcony . What could have happened ? The only likely trouble which had occurred to his vast experience had been the possibility of Roshan Khân seeking the interview upstairs . And for that very reason had not he , Akbar Khân , felt it his duty to sleep outside his mistress 's door ? What more could faithful servitude be expected to do ? But this ! What was this ? His charge had stolen a march upon him . Old as he was in the care of frail womanhood , he had been imposed upon ! Then , as he crept round a pillar craftily , the sight of Pidar Narâyan , in his priestly robes , made the old sinner throw up his hands and grovel in the dust . "
101861	101867	101856	101857	This slave	4971	" he mumbled , gasping . "
101890	101918	101919	101920	The other	1012	" Too soon , and too late ! What did it all mean ? Father Ninian stood helpless , paralyzed ; but Vincent caught at the words . "
101922	101926	101919	101920	The other	1012	" he echoed . "
101944	101954	101942	101942	him	4278	" He paused , for Laila opened her eyes . "
101960	101978	101979	101979	He	89	" she said , with a smile , that half - amused , half - mysterious smile . "
102011	102036	101991	101991	he	89	" She checked his incredulous outcry , and her hand hesitated up to his trembling fingers , and held them back from their task . "
102040	102045	101991	101991	he	89	" she went on ; "
102077	102104	102105	102105	We	2851	" There was an instant 's silence ; then her eyes wandered to his cuff as it rested on her corselet , and she smiled again . "
102138	102193	102130	102130	soldiers	4773	" The deadly realism roused Vincent to a sort of fury at his own helplessness . But what could a man do , caught in a second by Fate to be chief actor in a scene like this , where he was lost,--lost utterly ? And those two fools looking on -- doing nothing ! "
102212	102217	102205	102205	You	2848	" he cried passionately . "
102239	102240	102243	102243	she	2854	" "
102246	102297	102243	102243	she	2854	" asked Father Ninian , tonelessly . He had caught a word or two , and their triviality , in the face of what had happened -- a triviality common in those who have been struck down as she had been , almost painlessly -- had but increased his bewilderment . "
102315	102340	102344	102344	Vincent	71	" The girl had turned her face quickly to the new voice ; and , after vainly trying to rise , lay back breathlessly . "
102363	102364	102344	102344	Vincent	71	" "
102372	102379	102370	102370	sir	3491	" broke in Vincent , brutally . "
102501	102502	102500	102500	you--	86	" "
102505	102509	102519	102519	he	2856	" came Laila 's voice--"there
102552	102579	102550	102550	I	0	" She wandered off into Italian -- the language they always spoke , and her rich voice dulled , died away , as the faintness returned . "
102599	102605	102606	102606	She	2862	" cried Vincent , wildly . "
102635	102664	102665	102665	he	3491	" The light at least ! As Father Ninian mechanically took the red lamp from its niche he felt that he needed no more light than those words , "
102668	102742	102665	102665	he	3491	" had sent into his very soul . Yes , he knew what love was . But he knew also -- it came home to him in a second -- that his love , even after all these years , differed not at all from this girl 's . He heard it in her voice -- that voice so strangely like that other voice -- which he remembered -- oh ! so well ! "
102748	102752	102665	102665	he	3491	" said Vincent , "
102770	102912	102763	102763	you	3491	" He shivered as he spoke . But that first look at the girl had been enough for Pidar Narâyan . It had roused him , his apathy was gone . He thrust the lamp into Vincent 's trembling hands without a word , and his own steady ones -- the hands which had not touched their kind , except to heal body or soul , since they had said farewell to a woman -- took up the task . So for a few minutes there was silence , but for the old pantaloon 's ceaseless mumblings as he rocked himself backwards and forwards . He had meant no harm , he protested -- he had conducted more affairs of the kind to a decent ending than he could well remember -- no one could be more discreet -- accidents would happen-- "
102920	102929	102913	102913	She	2869	" said Father Ninian , breaking the silence . "
102941	102946	102940	102940	I--	0	" He would have said "
102949	102974	102940	102940	I--	0	" but for Vincent 's face of anguish . What right had he to feel sorrow?--he , the man who had brought this about . "
103009	103021	103003	103003	You	110	" But Vincent had her in his arms , with a brief "
103024	103025	102981	102981	Akbar	110	" "
103051	103081	103043	103043	I	0	" When he returned from his room with lint and bandages she was lying there as he had directed , her long red skirt trailing down the white steps . "
103104	103193	103195	103195	she	2869	" Vincent shivered again at the sight ; she looked already dead , with those tall tapers about her . Ah ! what did it all mean ? Was he dreaming ? How was it possible ? The wild improbability of it stunned him ; when not three hours ago he had had a sherry - and - bitters before dinner ! The curious irrelevance of his thoughts made him feel as if he must wake soon . Yet there she lay . Laila , whom he loved ! "
103199	103203	103198	103198	she--	2869	" he began . "
103212	103218	103208	103208	you	2873	" replied Father Ninian quietly . "
103227	103262	103208	103208	you	2873	" There was no mincing matters between these two men -- nothing but the brutal truth ; yet this time it was the old priest who held up his hand against a passionate outcry . "
103288	103324	103281	103281	She	2869	" To herself certainly . To the old half - amused , half - mysterious smile , as her eyes caught the tapers , the lighted altar beyond , her lover kneeling at her side . "
103333	103344	103330	103330	I	0	" she said -- there was a catch in her breath now--"but
103369	103375	103378	103378	him	2875	" she gave a little impatient sigh--"Oh
103401	103494	103383	103383	Romeo	99	" The words cut Vincent like a knife . Yes ! He had meant it . Not always . Not till , even to one with his past , the perfection of this idyll in the garden would have suffered without that promise to himself . And now , death should not cheat him , should not leave a stain , a regret , on the one perfect romance of his life . He stooped suddenly and kissed her ; kissed her with more passion than he had ever kissed her before . "
103510	103701	103503	103503	he	2875	" he whispered , then rose to his feet unsteadily . This at least he could do for himself . And for her ? A sob , almost of gratitude , of admiration , came to his eyes as he realized that it would never , never -- even if she had lived -- have mattered to her really . But it had been a part of the play ; part of her as Juliet . So it should be . His wild revolt at the sequence of improbabilities -- for after all that idyll in the garden had been , bar its environments , commonplace enough -- which had landed him in -- in an Adelphi drama!--(he could not help the thought , though he despised it)--should give way to this . The play should end with a wedding . Juliet should have the ' statue of pure gold ' in the eyes of the world . He could ensure this by a word ; and the word should be spoken . He touched Father Ninian peremptorily on the shoulder , as he bent , busy with his instruments . "
103785	103814	103778	103778	I	0	" Ninian Bruce looked for an instant as if he could have killed the man who stood before him ; then he drew himself up , priest utterly . "
103823	103824	103816	103816	you	2877	" "
103832	103838	103825	103825	I	0	" replied Vincent , fiercely . "
103845	103846	103825	103825	I	0	" "
103857	103867	103852	103852	I	0	" And Pidar Narâyan knelt down beside the girl . "
103871	103875	103852	103852	I	0	" he began , "
103880	103884	103876	103877	Captain Dering	71	" Then he gave way--"Cara
103887	103897	103876	103877	Captain Dering	71	" he whispered , laying his hand on hers , "
103932	103945	103924	103924	I	0	" Laila looked into his face with a faintly - wondering reply . "
103948	103953	103958	103958	he	2885	" she echoed dreamily . "
103978	103979	103980	103980	I	0	" "
103986	104005	103980	103980	I	0	" Vincent knelt down again and took her in his arms . The faint querulousness left her voice . "
104010	104014	104016	104016	him	2885	" she murmured . "
104050	104086	104032	104032	I	0	" Father Ninian gave a sort of cry , and turned blindly to the altar . If this was not Love , what was ? Then , monotonously , his voice began the marriage service . "
104092	104119	104032	104032	I	0	" he asked , when he came to stand by those two , the girl supported in Vincent 's arms . The latter shook his head . "
104125	104130	104032	104032	I	0	" he said sternly ; "
104136	104211	104032	104032	I	0	" But there was one on the old man 's finger ; one that had never left it since it had been put there by a saint in Paradise . He took it off now , and gave it to the man whom at that moment he hated and despised more than any man on earth . So , swiftly , the prayers went on , and old Akbar paused in his rockings to say "
104213	104282	104283	104283	Vincent	71	" with the others . He had learnt thus much in these latter days of grace . The last one came as a step resounded down the passage ; Lance Carlyon 's step as he sought the light he had seen -- sought his Captain . He seemed to bring a breath of fresh air into the passion - laden atmosphere , a solid reality into the shadows . "
104285	104299	104283	104283	Vincent	71	" he cried , as he caught sight of the scarlet and gold . "
104313	104328	104329	104329	I	0	" He paused suddenly , horror - struck at what had caught his eye . "
104346	104352	104353	104353	Hush	269	" Vincent stood up suddenly . "
104375	104391	104368	104369	The troopers	2375	" Lance , with his eyes still on that pitiful sight , shook his head . "
104405	104406	104399	104399	you	71	" "
104410	104416	104399	104399	you	71	" echoed Vincent , wildly . "
104429	104430	104431	104431	I	0	" "
104451	104455	104436	104436	I	0	" cried Lance . "
104504	104537	104498	104498	you	71	" Captain Dering gave an irresolute look at the dying girl . She had saved his life -- he loved her -- could he leave her ? Was anything worth that sacrifice ? "
104542	104569	104538	104538	You	71	" said a stern voice . It was Father Ninian 's , who had taken Vincent 's place and was now holding Laila in his arms . "
104591	104612	104588	104588	you	71	" There was almost a triumph in his voice . Lance looked from one to the other in sheer despair . "
104651	104658	104659	104659	You	71	" Vincent Dering stood still irresolute . "
104665	104669	104659	104659	You	71	" he said , "
104675	104686	104687	104687	I	0	" Father Ninian drew the unconscious girl closer to him . "
104694	104741	104692	104692	Margherita	147	" The last word came in a half whisper to himself and his eyes met Vincent 's with a curious dazed defiance . The latter gave the defiance back , as their owner stooped for a second over Laila 's indifferent face , and kissed it . "
104748	105583	104746	104746	Juliet	100	" he said ; and the last word came also in a half whisper to himself . The next moment he was following Lance down the dim passage , full of a vague relief , and realizing for the first time that the mist , which for the last half hour had dimmed the reality of all things , was due , not to any aberration of his brain , but to the simple fact that an electrical dust - storm was in full blast . He realized it with relief . That was at least real , tangible . Almost too much so ; and as the hot wind , charged with those aspiring atoms of earth , met him fiercely , he realized also that the storm would fight against him in his efforts to prevent worse from happening . If , indeed , anything could be worse than what had happened ; worse than Laila's-- He broke off in his thought , incredulous . It could not be true . He would come back to find her better -- well!-- But that other dream was true . His men had risen . The one thing necessary , therefore , was to get to the gaol before any decided action took place ; and this he realised still more clearly from Lance 's curt explanation as they ran down the river steps . Once there , the sight of the canoe he had left suggested the feasibility of getting to the gaol in it . His personal influence might avail . If that failed , he would at least be able to save time by choosing a suitable place for the raft to come ashore . The great thing was to be on the spot , to be within reach of action at once ; to wait for the raft meant needless delay . So , a minute after , the faint splash of his paddle was lost in the rising hum of the storm , and Lance was left looking anxiously for sound or sight of the raft , which , if all had gone well , should by now have started . But neither came , so , seeing from the light he had snatched up as he passed through the balcony that the air was growing darker , more impenetrable than ever , he shoved off his strange craft , to wait further out in the stream where there was less chance of the raft passing him unseen , unheard . For this reason also , he paddled up along the wall a bit into the faint glow of light which showed still from the arches of the chapel . And as he lay in it , his ears and eyes strained for the least sound , he could hear as a kind of background to that muffled drumming of the storm , the sound of the pilgrims chanting as they waited for the dawn . The dawn which would bring -- what ? Who could tell ? The sound of other prayers , echoing from the chapel , made him shake his head , feeling that it was hopeless to look forward -- or backward for that matter ! Why had Roshan shot the girl -- if he had ! And why had Pidar Narâyan called her Margherita , and Vincent called her Juliet ? The whole thing was exactly as he had said -- an infernal nightmare ! Then a faint sound in front of him made his strong arms sweep the paddle through the stream as he shot into the darkness in search of the raft ; in search of Erda . Not that she needed him , really . The memory of her in that red - and - gold mess jacket above her wedding dress , giving orders to the men squarely , came back to make him smile . God bless her ! She could do well enough without him . That was one comfort . And Dillon could hold his own too , without much help , for a time -- that was another ; for what with this and that , help was bound to be over - long in coming . Lance Carlyon was right in trusting Dr. Dillon 's power of doing without help until Providence chose to send some . This was the easier task , in that he had made up his mind deliberately beforehand as to what his best course of action would be should an alarm of this sort occur . Therefore that imperative kling - kling of the telegraph bell which roused him in a second from his bed , where , ready dressed for any such emergency , he was sleeping the sleep of the just , found him alert , prepared for anything and everything . So it has come , he thought , as he hastily wired back the comprehensive reply , "
105590	106004	105588	105588	you	2897	" He felt as a doctor does when a dangerous symptom which he has foreseen as a possibility , shows itself . He had been on the lookout for this for days , but as the dawn would end the period during which it might be expected , he had , as in the outbreak of the cholera , had hopes that danger was over . His last thought , as he slept , had been this ; he woke to find that the complication must be faced . Woke with a strong regret , but a stronger instinct of fight . So he slipped his feet into his shoes , jammed his big mushroom hat on his head out of pure habit , and so , armed cap - à - pie , with a brain quick to work , and a body ready to follow and obey , he ran across the sandy road to the Smiths ' bungalow , realizing as he did so that a dust - storm was just beginning . That would delay both attack and relief . On the whole , this would be an advantage , since , once things were secure , half an hour or so would make no difference in the latter ; whereas , he wanted every minute he could get now for preparation . He had not warned Eugene Smith of his fears . There was never any use alarming people by mere probabilities , unless by so doing you could forearm them . And this was not the case here ; since the safest -- in fact the only -- place of refuge for Mrs. Smith and the child , should trouble arise , was the semi - fortified roof above the gate of the gaol ; and that he knew to be ready for use . He had , therefore , only to wake them , as quietly as might be , so as not to give the alarm to the servants . Fortune favoured him in this ; for , just outside the verandah , he ran full tilt upon Eugene himself , tall , gaunt , in his sleeping - suit , carrying a roll of bedding on his back like a snail 's shell . The heat of the evening had enticed him to sleep outside , as he preferred , à la Robinson Crusoe , and the dust - storm was sending him in . "
106009	106013	106007	106007	Dillon	69	" he cried , "
106029	106037	106025	106025	I	0	" he gave a sigh of relief , "
106077	106078	106025	106025	I	0	" "
106088	106099	106082	106082	I	0	" replied the doctor , dryly , recovering his breath . "
106207	106237	106202	106202	they	2901	" Eugene Smith had dropped his snail - shell and sat down on it , aghast , in surprise ; but he was up again before the doctor finished . "
106241	106252	106239	106239	Jove	76	" he said rapidly , calmly as the doctor himself . "
106278	106279	106265	106265	I	0	" "
106316	106550	106309	106309	I	0	" A moment after he was striking a match to light the tall floor - lamp in Mrs. Smith 's drawing - room . She had turned it out herself a few hours before , thinking , as she looked round the room , full of soft rose - shaded light , how pretty , how cosey it was . It had the same air of refined security now . Everything , down to a copy of the last ' Queen ' lying on an inlaid table by her favourite chair , was so exactly what one would have expected to find in her room ; the room of a delicate , cultivated , civilized , society woman . And now ? Now the delicacy , the culture , the civilization , the society , and the security belonging to them , had been invaded in an instant . By what ? The dust -- you could almost see it springing into the air in these sandy stretches -- had already settled thick over the dainty furniture , and as Dr. Dillon , standing by the table in the pink glow of the lamp , asked himself the question , he yielded to the imperious fascination which a smooth sand - surface has for humanity . But he did not write his name upon it ; only the idle answer to the question . "
106554	106658	106309	106309	I	0	" The writing lay upon the table beside the latest fashions , staring up into the pink paper shade , after George Dillon had passed rapidly to Eugene 's office to choose this , that , and the other , and make them into a bundle with a table - cloth . When he returned to the drawing - room , Muriel Smith was standing by that writing in the sand : a fragile figure in a blue dressing - gown , all frilled and embroidered like the pictures in the paper . She looked more forlorn than frightened ; forlorn and pathetic . "
106664	106673	106674	106674	Your	2908	" said the doctor , as he entered . "
106692	106693	106789	106789	he	74	" "
106698	106765	106789	106789	he	74	" she answered , and he nodded . There was no excitement , no heroics . Only that . That , and the writing on the sand , and her forlornness -- the forlornness of a delicate Dresden shepherdess set to drive a flock of real sheep to the shambles . But the needlessness , the pity of it , made Dr. Dillon set his teeth . "
106774	106778	106766	106766	Eugene	74	" she said . "
106812	106846	106801	106801	I	0	" There was no trace of fear in her voice , but there was none of resistance either , and she turned at the door to look back with an almost reproachful acquiescence . "
106850	106855	106801	106801	I	0	" she said softly , "
106874	106890	106891	106891	Vincent	71	" She turned to the darkness again with a little shiver , and went on , "
106899	106900	106891	106891	Vincent	71	" "
106906	106919	106901	106901	I	0	" replied Dr. Dillon curtly ; then , repenting him , added , "
106965	106971	106974	106974	you	2911	" She smiled quite tenderly . "
106993	107887	107889	107890	the superintendent	2913	" She seemed to accept the necessity of this ; perhaps rightly . For the storm itself was no joke in these desert stretches , where the sand rose in choking clouds , yet left enough to make each step a toil . Muriel stumbled along breathlessly , but so slowly that , when her husband joined them , striding along with Gladys , still sleeping , wrapped in a blanket in his arms , the doctor bade them come at their leisure and wait until he gave the signal before entering , then ran on swiftly to the gaol . For there was no time to lose ; though , on the other hand , there was very little to be done . The less the better , if his plan was to be successful ; since that involved the utmost quiet , and the keeping of the prisoners from all knowledge of what was going on as long as possible . As he faced the choking darkness , the hot blasts of causeless wind , blowing all ways at once , George Dillon reckoned up his chances fairly . The storm would certainly make it easier to keep such knowledge from those within , and make it more difficult for those without to establish communication with the former . So far , good . On the other hand , no amount of the light at his command would enable him to see , even from his coign of vantage on the gateway roof , what was going on , either outside or inside . And darkness was the diggers ' best friend ; while digging was the recognized enemy of mud walls . Especially of those inside walls which divided the gaol into sections . Yet the best , the only chance of keeping the prisoners quiet , lay in preserving their segregation into companies . For the gaol was of the cart - wheel pattern . That is , a huge circle of outside wall , thick as an earthwork , the felloes of the wheel , as it were . Then a small central cylinder of brick , like a lime kiln , the nave of the wheel , as it were . Between these two the spokes . Spokes of twelve feet high mud wall , dividing the whole into seven wedges of prison , absolutely distinct , blank , aperture - less , save for one heavily stanchioned door in the apex of each wedge , leading into the central tower . Exit or entry was therefore impossible to six of these wedges , except through the tower ; that is the citadel , the key , as it were , of the gaol proper . The seventh wedge , however , gave , at its wider end , on the entrance - gate , which was a square , semi - fortified building , pierced by a tunnel , gated at each end , and further protected by an outside yard , or roofless porch , also gated . The inmost of these three gates opened on to a small courtyard , and this narrowed again into an alley which gave access to the central tower . Briefly then the whole gaol consisted of six wedges opening , by a door in their narrow end , into the central cylinder ; and a seventh wedge split in two by an alley leading between high mud walls from the gateway to that central tower ; the key to the position . In the two halves of the split wedge lay the warders ' barracks , the solitary cells , the cook rooms , the hospital ; and the entry to these was by a door on either side of the little courtyard , just beyond the inner gate . From the corner of this , also , rose the outside stair leading to the roof of the square , brick gateway . Thus the fifteen hundred prisoners were broken up into companies of about two hundred each , and were absolutely without possibility of communication so long as the central tower was in the hands of authority . Unless there was time to undermine the mud walls , and tools , also , wherewith to work . Of these , however , there were none in the gaol . Nothing , even , that could be used to take their place , except in that seventh section which held the executive of the gaol ; and there Dr. Dillon meant to leave no hands to use them , if he could compass it . As he pulled up to regain his breath before walking up to the gate and giving the countersign , the whole place lay quiet and dark . So far , good . There was the risk , however , of the plot being known , and of the sentry refusing him entrance . It was not , however , and the next moment , calmly as if he was merely on one of his not infrequent rounds of unexpected night inspections , Dr. Dillon passed from the outer porch to the tunnel , and told the sentry at the inner gate to light the lamp in the little office room to one side . "
107892	107900	107889	107890	the superintendent	2913	" he said to the first man , "
107915	108153	107906	107906	I	0	" He added this because he knew it would give time , since the superintendent would be sure to give a private look round , first , to see all was in order , and remove possible traces of tobacco or opium,--those luxuries out of which so much money can be made by gaol officials . No sooner , however , had the first sentry gone through the door to the left section , than he sent the second one on a similar message to the right , where the hospital lay . Then , the coast being clear , he rapidly unlocked the private safe in the office which held his set of keys in case of accidents , and locked both the right and left doors . Secure for a moment , therefore , from interruption , he ran outside , saw that the tool rooms , etc . , were closed , gave the signal to Eugene Smith , hurried the refugees up the stairs ; and then , after unlocking the two doors again on his way back to the office , sat down in his usual chair and began to look over a register . He was engaged in this calm occupation when , a minute or two after , the native superintendent -- a big , dignified person , in a blatant undress due largely to his bulk -- arrived breathless . "
108158	108177	107906	107906	I	0	" began Dr. Dillon , instantly , and the mere tone of the title made the man quiver , "
108292	108472	108289	108290	the smugglers	2925	" The darogah 's fat flesh shook , yet he winked as he went off . If the doctor - sahib expected to find anything in this fashion except , maybe , a smell of the forbidden drugs , he was mistaken . On such a night , too , when the dust was in everyone 's eyes . Well ! it might have been worse ; for , though he knew nothing definitely of any plot , he could not fail to know that there was more to excite men in the gaol , that night , than tobacco or opium ! So he went about his summons with a sigh of relief , and before the five minutes were over had his posse of minor officials together , including a file of unfettered prisoners , with good conduct badges , who were used as gang leaders . He himself finally coming down the alley , with a stupendous bunch of keys , followed by the little group of night warders he had collected from the other sections . "
108476	108485	108289	108290	the smugglers	2925	" asked Dr. Dillon , lighting a cigar . "
108530	108586	108519	108519	I	0	" Some of the men grinned , some looked uneasy , and some few frowned ; but all obeyed , though they cuddled themselves into their blankets as they slipped through the wicket , and faced the whirling , swirling storm in the open porch , the doors of which were barred , not solid . "
108590	108607	108587	108588	Kishen Rao	274	" came Dr. Dillon 's voice , after a long series of names , followed by brief "
108610	108628	108587	108588	Kishen Rao	274	" and swift exits . There was no answer . He turned to the darogah for explanation . "
108631	108650	108587	108588	Kishen Rao	274	" explained the latter , timorously . A little more decision might have saved him the quick question , "
108656	108657	108658	108658	Huzoor	90	" "
108659	108665	108666	108666	he	90	" palpitated the fat man , "
108714	108715	108707	108707	He	90	" "
108721	108731	108707	108707	He	90	" commented the doctor , looking over the register . "
108742	108755	108707	108707	He	90	" So , rapidly , the last man ducked under the wicket . "
108761	108762	108763	108763	Everyone	749	" "
108770	108779	108763	108763	Everyone	749	" protested the burly official , with smiles . "
108788	108789	108763	108763	Everyone	749	" "
108799	108834	108763	108763	Everyone	749	" said Dr. Dillon , coolly , as he stepped forward , closed the wicket , slid the bolt to its place , and turned on the darogah , all in one swift sequence . "
108839	108845	108763	108763	Everyone	749	" he went on sharply , "
108859	108873	108875	108875	you	2933	" he took out a revolver , and laid it on the table beside him--"every
108900	108901	108902	108902	Huzoor	90	" "
108904	108924	108902	108902	Huzoor	90	" bleated the man , helplessly , putting his big bunch on the table . Dr. Dillon smiled sarcastically . "
108945	108957	108902	108902	Huzoor	90	" When it came he ticked them off rapidly by it . "
108971	108980	108981	108982	Kishen Rao--	275	" he asked . The official grew green . "
108983	108985	108986	108986	he	275	" he began--"but
108991	109000	108986	108986	he	275	" Dr. Dillon turned on him like lightning . "
109014	109036	109003	109005	a damned scoundrel	2945	" He ran over the rest swiftly , then looked up suddenly with a scowl that made the man literally collapse . "
109065	109070	109071	109072	Kishen Rao--	275	" he laughed sardonically . "
109073	109076	109071	109072	Kishen Rao--	275	" gurgled the darogah--"by
109085	109086	109071	109072	Kishen Rao--	275	" "
109101	109112	109113	109113	I	0	" went on the doctor , with a curious elation . "
109124	109158	109113	109113	I	0	there,"--he pointed to an inner store - room behind the slip of an office ; a windowless place , pitch dark , where the clothes in which the prisoners arrived awaited their release in piles--"and
109169	109176	109177	109177	You	275	" All but that brief order , "
109182	109250	109177	109177	You	275	" was spoken in English , as a sort of outlet for the intense satisfaction which was filling him at his own success,--so far . The next minute he had turned the key on the darogah , and was up the stairs calling Eugene Smith in a low voice to come down and help to bolt and bar ; but to come as quietly as he could . "
109259	109276	109251	109251	I	0	" he said joyously , after he had explained the position in a few rapid words ; "
109345	109363	109364	109364	Huzoor	90	" So , rapidly , the two men set to work , undisturbed by more than a protesting "
109371	109411	109364	109364	Huzoor	90	" from the posse outside the first gate , and a low knocking at the wicket . There were double doors here , however , and of the sort which it would need time to negotiate , without powder . "
109423	109428	109364	109364	Huzoor	90	" said the doctor ; "
109445	109464	109465	109465	We	2957	" he remembered Kishen Rao , and frowned . That was the only weak spot in his armour . "
109478	109488	109465	109465	We	2957	" he continued , carefully allowing for the worst ; "
109539	109682	109496	109496	Smith	74	" So , for fully a quarter of an hour , no sound was heard above the curious vibration of the storm except the grinding and crushing of the bricks as they were rapidly eased out , one by one , from the mud mortar . The light of one of the office lamps , set on the ground , showed by that time a sheer drop of eight or ten feet , and Eugene Smith , working above , jammed his crowbar into a crevice of the wall against which the steps clung like a swallow 's nest , and gave Dr. Dillon , who had been working below , a rope and a hand up . The latter set down the keys and the lamp he had brought up with him , and deliberately dusted the knees of his trousers . "
109689	109693	109496	109496	Smith	74	" he said . "
109699	109700	109496	109496	Smith	74	" "
109708	109717	109496	109496	Smith	74	" assented Eugene Smith , a trifle dubiously . "
109720	109727	109728	109728	I	0	" echoed the doctor , enthusiastically , "
109745	109760	109496	109496	Smith	74	" That was a sudden bugle - call . The doctor 's face fell . "
109806	109821	109824	109824	Dering	71	" He took the light in his hand and crossed to the outer parapet . "
109826	109904	109824	109824	Dering	71	" he began , peering down . Then a couple of shots whizzed past his head and he ducked . At the same moment , as if roused by the concussion , the first crackling thunderclap of the dust - storm , sounding muffled through the thick air , followed like a roll - call , and reverberated dully , sluggishly , through the black darkness . When it passed , Dr. Dillon 's voice rose quietly . "
109939	110282	110286	110286	someone	498	" There was a certain satisfaction at the monopoly in his voice . The sound of those two shots greeted Vincent Dering as , after infinite difficulty , owing to the darkness , the fitful gusts of wind , and the sand - banks , he drew up the canoe against what he knew must be the high bank below the off - take of the canal . It had only been by trusting the stream to guide him , and refraining at times from the use of his paddle , that he had managed to steer his way at all . So he knew he was late ; felt , indeed , that he must be too late to use his influence with the men , and yet , despite this knowledge , a keen disappointment filled him when those shots proved him to be so ; since by long experience he knew that once open resistance began , there could be no more question of words . What then , was there for him to do ? If he , in his light canoe , helped , wherever possible , by every atom of strength his arms possessed , had taken so long to come down that mile or two of stream , the raft could not possibly arrive for another half hour . He could not sit still for half an hour ; he felt , indeed , as if he could not sit still for half a minute . A passion to act , to sweep away the past , to forget , was upon him . He had had time during his strange journey -- so often idle perforce -- to realize his position ; time to piece the still stranger events preceding his journey into a reasonable sequence ; so that he had , by now , arrived at a fairly accurate guess as to the cause of much , that , when it happened , had seemed causeless . For instance , Laila 's dress , "
110288	110593	110286	110286	someone	498	" That , joined to the knowledge that she was connected with the late Nawab 's family , of which Roshan Khân might with justice claim the headship , had brought the latter 's action within the bounds of credibility . Jealousy ! revenge ! these were potent causes . Laila , then , must have been playing with Roshan 's pretensions . Playing like a child with a toy ; playing , rather , like a woman who hesitates at nothing for the sake of the man she loves . And she had hesitated at nothing ; not even at this , to give him pleasure , to make things match with his passion ! The thought , the remembrance , made him for a moment feel inclined to fling up his hands , and let the canoe take him where it chose ; take him down stream utterly . Then a half choking , yet wholly strenuous desire to escape from the whole story , a wild instinctive effort for a more wholesome atmosphere , like that of a drowning man for a breath of fresh air , had sent the canoe bounding on his way ; his way and none other 's , in swift obedience . With a rush , he had grasped that there was more in life -- that he had allowed himself to be a slave ! But that was past,--he would shake himself together -- he would forget the thraldom of sex -- and he would forget the past . Yet , as he cast about in his mind for the best method of applying the half hour 's leisure , the remembrance of a woman came to him , as if to mock at his resolution . Muriel , and dear little Gladys who called him "
110597	111009	110594	110597	Derin ' darling "	5373	" ; where were they ? His eyes grew soft in the remembrance , stern at the probability of their being in danger . Why had he not thought of it before ? How could he ever have paused , wondering what to do ? He set the red light , which he had taken from the fateful balcony , carefully in the canoe -- though , even should some gust of the rising wind not blow the light out , it could scarcely be of any use in that outer darkness -- as a signal to the raft should it , by an off chance , drift past in his absence , then struck across the sand in the direction in which he knew the Smiths ' bungalow must lie ; that was , a little to the rear of the gaol . The storm , as he faced it , was so fierce that the doubt rose inevitably if an unwieldy raft could make way against it . If so , then there would be no help . The only thing would be to defend himself and others until the end came ; the end which would at least end the past . He had almost to feel his way , the darkness was so intense . It was a relief to stumble against something which he knew must be the low mud fence of Muriel 's garden ; that garden in which she tried to defy Providence , and rear English flowers . He knew his feet must be crushing her treasures as he passed on towards a faint glow , a red glow . But everything that was not the blackness of outer darkness to - night seemed red -- blood red . A minute after , with a vast relief at the silence , the solitude , he was in Muriel 's pretty drawing - room . The pink - shaded lamp was still alight , showing red through the fog of dust . He passed to it instinctively , and as he did so , noticed the writing on the table . But many an earth - atom had fallen on that confession of ignorance since George Dillon had made it idly , and so , as Vincent Dering bent quickly to see if by chance it was some message left for those who might come after , he also had to frown and say , "
111013	112184	110594	110597	Derin ' darling "	5373	" Was it possible that Eugene and his wife were still asleep ? The doors stood open , but that was to be expected at that season of the year , unless someone had been awake to close them against the storm . He must make sure , however . But there was no one to be found in any of the rooms . It occurred to him , then , that they must have taken refuge in the gaol , and he told himself he was a fool not to have thought of that before . Dillon would , of course , have seen to that . He , Vincent , might have remembered so much , at least ; might have remembered that he himself was not the only slave . Then he gave an odd , bitter little laugh . Was it never possible to get beyond a woman 's apron - strings ? And here he was wasting time over the question , when he ought to be doing something better . But what ? Go back and wait for the raft , or on to the gaol ? There was a big tamarisk tree at the end of the garden . Only two days before he had pointed it out to Muriel and said that an active man accustomed to trapeze work might swing himself from it astride the high mud wall of the gaol , and so gain the roof of the gate . Dillon had denied it ; and she had said , laughingly , that no one ever tried to break into a gaol , only out of one . Curious ; still , if it had only been light , it would have been worth the risking . But it was impossible now in the dark . So , suddenly , a remembrance came to him . The search - light ! Was it only last night he had been dining here , in this house , after bringing Muriel home from the Mission , where they had seen that huge ray piercing the shadows ? Was it only yesterday that he had listened to Eugene 's lamentations over his unused electricity , which was sure , he said , to vanish into space from his rude contrivances . Was it only yesterday that , in obedience to that pathetic look of martyrdom on Muriel 's face , which still seemed -- to one part of Vincent 's nature -- to call for instant sympathy , he had , to appease the honest inventor , shown an interest in search - lights which was purely fictitious , and learned a variety of facts about buttons and stop - cocks ? And had all this happened yesterday on purpose that to - day , when he was in need of light-- He was up on the roof with the thought . If only the blessed thing had go enough for that ! As he picked his way rapidly through the litter , three or four cigar - ends , a half - finished whiskey - and - soda , seen by the flash of the hurricane lantern he had sought out and lit , told him that Eugene must have been at work over his new toy till late . So much the better for his chance -- for everybody 's chance ; since a signal like that might make all the difference to the raft ; all the difference to Dillon in the gaol-- George Dillon was , indeed , beginning to realize this himself . His almost triumphant mood had passed ; it had come home to him that the unexpected revelation of the troopers ' complicity in the plot , whatever it was , had changed the whole aspect of affairs . Now , there was no question of keeping the gaol quiet until help should arrive . He was face to face , now , with the fact that he must not rely on any aid at all . What had really happened , he could not guess . For all he knew , the troopers and pioneers might have risen and killed their officers , killed everybody who would be likely to help . His aim , now , was to sell his life , and -- and hers -- as dearly as he could ; but in the dead darkness , like a rat in a hole , what could be done ? Except wait -- wait for the walls to be dug through , the gates to be mined , that poor eight or ten feet drop at the foot of the stairs scaled . Then a rush , still in the dark , and -- the greatest Darkness of all ! Not even the chance of a shot ; and he had plenty of ammunition . It would at least have passed the time to take pot - shots at the devils ; and though these would have brought retaliation , there would have been no need for exposure . The parapet walls were high enough , and properly loopholed . So , for a few minutes , he sat almost sullenly beside those , for whom alone he now felt responsible , in the little turret , which , as is always the case in India , rose at one corner of the flat roof giving fair shelter for the time . In his first hurried recognition , which had come with the shots , that not help but attack lay outside , he had blown out his light , fearing lest Eugene Smith might also be exposed to similar attentions ; so it was pitch dark . And the now almost constant reverberations , which seemed to send the sand - laden air in pulse - beats on your face , deadened all other sounds into vague confusion . But he knew that the warders within the porch , the troopers without , were trying to force the barred gate . That would not take long ; though the two doors blocking the ends of the tunnel would be a tougher job . And he heard , closer at hand , a sleepy whimper from the child , a low comforting from a mother 's voice . The sound made him set his teeth . God ! if there was only light to kill withal . And then , in a second , as if by a miracle , it came . A great flood of shining light , contemptuous , at that short distance , even of that outer darkness . For it was electricity against electricity ; a house divided against itself . The first thing he saw by it was that fragile figure in its dainty blue frills , a child 's golden head ; and so , naturally , the next instant found his hand on a rifle . "
112206	112211	112198	112198	everyone	749	" cried Eugene Smith . "
112214	112221	112198	112198	everyone	749	" echoed Dr. Dillon , savagely . "
112239	112328	112198	112198	everyone	749	" It was not ; for a trooper engaged in staring stupidly at the velvety black circle out of which the intruding light seemed to spring , suddenly threw up his hands , swirled round , and fell face upwards in a crumpled heap . There was an instant 's scare in the crowd , in that hundred and fifty or more of troopers and conspirators , thrown into black and white relief , like a shadow pantomime , about the outer gate . Then the startled murmurs of "
112338	112359	112198	112198	everyone	749	" which were passing from lip to lip , changed into a yell . The fight had begun in earnest . "
112363	112373	112198	112198	everyone	749	" remarked Dr. Dillon , a few minutes after , "
112449	113036	113038	113038	me	0	" He paused , and shot on steadily till , with a hoarse shout , the attackers surged inwards . Then he laid his rifle aside , remarking that it would be as well to keep an eye gaolwards , in case of complications . So far as could be seen in that curious chequering of dense darkness and sharp glittering light ; light which was palpably an intruder , which seemed absolutely apart from the things it showed -- even from the dust - atoms -- there was none as yet . At least the uppermost portion of that vast wheel of wall stood out , perfect , unbroken . The roof of the Smiths ' bungalow , where the light stood , being , however , but little higher than these walls , much of what lay below in the sections themselves was necessarily hidden in shadow ; especially on the side nearest the light . But the narrow alley leading up to the central tower , being in straight line with the ray , showed clear as daylight , save just under the citadel itself . So did most of the little courtyard , with its doors opening to the right and left . George Dillon gave a sigh of satisfaction at the sight , since , whether the foe elected -- when once inside the gates -- to rush the roof , or press on to liberate the prisoners by those six doors in the round tower , there would be fair chance of a good bag , for a straight shot ! Or , even if the convalescents in hospital were to set free the solitary - cell convicts -- a contingency which had occurred to him too late for any plan of minimizing the danger -- and were to swarm into the courtyard to help against the last gate ( which , of course , was partly barred from the inside ) , he could settle their hash also . And that , now , was his one idea . The idea of all brave men when they find themselves in a tight place -- to kill before being killed . As yet , however , there was no sign of life even within the vast wheel , with its rims and spokes of light , its centre of shadow . It lay dim , curiously still behind the dust - atoms that danced in the ray , like motes in a sunbeam . There was not a sound , not a sign within . Only the tumult of voices , the intermittent shots without , rising above the dull , muffled hum in the air . Stay ! that was something . Half way round the circle , where the shadow of the tall tamarisk tree in the Smiths ' garden cut a jagged gap in the white rim of wall , there was some change , something that had not been there a moment ago . The gap had moved ; had changed place and form , though for a time the air was still with one of those breathless , suffocating pauses , when the dust above seems to sink on the dust below , and fill one 's very lungs . And now the gap was back again , as it had been before . But it had left something clinging for a second to the wall like a limpet : the next astride it safely . "
113045	113052	113043	113043	Smith	74	" said the doctor , briefly ; "
113130	113269	113122	113122	I	0	" He leant over the parapet , waiting . Just below him , the inner wall of the gate against which the stair clung , and which was prolonged into the turret where Muriel and the child were sheltering , joined the circular outside wall of the gaol . The man , thought Dr. Dillon , trusting to their being occupied in front , must be trying to steal a march on them , slip down the stair , and take them in the rear . There was plenty of time to prevent that , however . Muriel Smith , roused by the sound of Vincent 's name from the sort of lethargy into which she had fallen,--since she was not wanted either by her husband or the doctor,--rose to her knees and peered over the parapet cautiously . "
113277	113283	113122	113122	I	0	" she said , dreamily . "
113314	113322	113325	113325	himself	71	" she paused , and gave a little cry--"It
113327	113331	113325	113325	himself	71	" she gasped ; "
113364	113365	113362	113362	Vincent	71	" "
113370	113385	113362	113362	Vincent	71	" asked Eugene , still firing steadily at all that was to be seen . "
113409	113410	113405	113405	she	2976	" "
113417	113422	113405	113405	she	2976	" she sobbed , half hysterically--"I
113439	113462	113430	113430	he	71	" Eugene Smith laid down his rifle , and crawled over in cover deliberately , with an odd look on his face . "
113487	113516	113481	113481	he	71	" There was no grudge in his voice , only a curious challenge as he looked at his wife , then laid his big hand on her shoulder . "
113551	113552	113528	113528	He	71	" "
113564	113568	113554	113554	I	0	" she moaned ; "
113584	113626	113583	113583	him--	71	" She was shivering all over , the patient self - control , the steady acquiescence even in her own danger which had been hers till then , gone utterly . George Dillon felt a great pity , a vast impatience . "
113634	113647	113628	113628	you	0	" he broke in hastily , to cover her sudden break down . "
113671	113763	113628	113628	you	0	" But when , five minutes later , Vincent Dering reached the roof in safety , the doctor felt vaguely that the explanations only added to the general incomprehensibility ; and that something was being kept back . What , he asked impatiently , had started the show ? Of course there were plots . Pidar Narâyan knew of them , but , as such things generally did , they had seemed abortive . What , then , had upset the apple - cart ? Vincent gave a gesture of despair . "
113769	113773	113628	113628	you	0	" he cried . "
113800	113801	113802	113802	You	0	" "
113812	113836	113805	113805	your	0	" said Eugene , who , in this pause for a council of war , was methodically loading various weapons for future use . "
113872	113889	113891	113891	Dering	71	" He spoke suddenly , harshly ; and once more George Dillon came to the rescue . "
113944	113985	113938	113938	you	74	" Vincent , kindly always , had stooped to take little Gladys , who had crept over to him , in his arms ; and now the child , her arms round his neck , was cuddling close to him . "
113999	114003	114007	114007	mum	3622	" she whispered . "
114015	114033	114007	114007	mum	3622	" Vincent unclasped the soft , little , clinging hands almost resentfully , and pulled himself together . "
114036	114041	114007	114007	mum	3622	" he said briefly , "
114128	114317	114318	114318	You	2995	" It was , indeed . Even Am - ma had lost himself utterly , while Lance , after paddling , and drifting , and shouting after a dozen false hopes , was still as far from finding the raft as ever . What could have become of it ? Had it started sooner than he had expected , and passed down before he had found Vincent ? Or had it never started at all ? Had the men , after he left , turned round on her ? This fear had come to him early in his search , and he had felt inclined then and there to paddle back to the Fort , and satisfy himself it was not so . But the thought of her face , if he allowed care for her to cause delay , had kept him to his task steadily , till he could no longer doubt that something had gone wrong . But what ? And what was he to do ? Then , in a flash , had come back her words after she had bidden him think hard . "
114346	114753	114754	114756	Am - ma	3733	" That had been her verdict , involving her being left to take her chance . And now either the raft , the relief for the gaol , had started , or it had not . If the former , he might , of course , by a stern chase overtake it ; but Erda was there and Vincent would meet her ; they could do without him . But if it had not started , what then ? Then matters were exactly as they had been , when she had bidden him leave her . So , with a feeling that , if this were so , he cared little what happened , he steered , so far as he could judge , for the sand - banks of the spit to the right . Am - ma , on the contrary , steered instinctively to the left , towards the high bank , the deepest stream . It would at least float his logs to their destination , and that was something . Kings had come and gone , and battles had been won and lost , but the logs had always had to go down the river , whatever happened . And among the men , also , an apathy seemed to have settled , as they drifted on and on in the dark . Erda , crouching in a dry spot beside the ammunition , alert to the uttermost for the least hint of Lance , realized this from the very tone of their voices as they talked under their breath to each other . She felt instinctively that the inaction , the darkness , the lack of a leader , were lessening the value of those twenty men each minute . If Lance would only turn up ! What could have become of him ? The time seemed interminable ; she felt sure that they must already have drifted past the gaol ; she began to wonder if Am - ma was not playing false . For the darkness , the uncertainty , had its grip on her also . It was like some horrid nightmare , to drift on and on , hearing the muffled drumming of the storm , feeling the strange vibration in the air , the sharp sand tingling on your face , and to know nothing -- nothing at all , save that you were there . "
114758	114775	114789	114789	you	3733	" she cried sharply , at last , certain of but one thing , that she must act,--"I
114792	114810	114789	114789	you	3733	" A laugh , not exactly insolent , but tolerant , came from the group of men . "
114821	114826	114817	114819	Missy - baba	111	" said a voice ; "
114847	114882	114883	114885	Am - ma	3733	" Erda 's heart gave a great throb , not of fear , but comprehension . That was the beginning ; a minute or two more and these men would be out of hand . "
114887	114892	114883	114885	Am - ma	3733	" she called again , "
114913	114921	114904	114904	we	3000	" Another laugh came from the men . "
114944	114975	114904	114904	we	3000	" The voice ended in a gasp-- For it was there ! A long ray of light , showing them that they were , indeed , just opposite the gaol . "
114980	114999	114904	114904	we	3000	" came Erda 's voice again , and there was a hush and yet a triumph in it , "
115009	115076	114904	114904	we	3000	" The raft edged slowly towards the ray , but the soldiers still crouched inactive ; awed , yet not certain . Then suddenly that quick crack of George Dillon 's first shot echoed over the river , then the yell , then the answering shots . And following on their heels rapidly came a stir among those crouching figures , and one of them stood up excitedly--"It
115118	115372	115114	115114	they	3009	" Erda gave a sigh of relief . That danger was over . The fact that the quarrel had begun did not , however , have the same effect upon Roshan Khân . In the first tempest of rage and hate which the sight of Laila and Vincent in the balcony had roused in him he had simply let himself go . He had not thought at all . Had his revolver held other cartridges , he would have gone on shooting at Vincent , Pidar Narâyan , at everybody , till he could shoot no more . He had run â - mak ; that curious phase of the Oriental mind when once it oversteps the hard and fast lines of custom in which it moves and breathes and has its being . The very fact that his revolver did not contain more possibilities for death , that he had no other weapon , emphasized his wild revolt . He was helpless -- impotent -- before these strangers , who had stolen everything ! Everything , save bare existence . This thought , as he burst into the open , into the lurid darkness of the new - come storm , had made him laugh bitterly ; for it was only that bare existence which he wished to steal ! They might keep the rest ; but that he would claim from them somehow , in fair exchange . The time was ripe for such exchange too,--for fair exchange . ( The epithet "
115374	115898	115083	115083	Lehna	278	" haunted him , trying to still the keen remorse for that shot in the dark ; for one part of him knew it to have been cowardly . ) Yes ! this useless plot , with foolish mischief hidden in its heart , to which he had just been listening with loyal intent to frustrate it , could be made to serve his purpose without delay . His men would follow him anywhere . He had but to say the word -- the word so many of them wanted . Then , those thieves of all that made life worth living would learn a lesson . They would fight and win , of course ; but the lesson that without such men as he -- men whom they thwarted and repressed at every turn -- they could not rely upon their regiments , would have to be learnt . And in the learning , one thief would learn something else . So , without more thought than this desperate clashing of jealousy and despair , he had dashed through the crowd of pilgrims who were waiting for the dawn , gone back to the Fort , and given the word . In the excitement which followed , spreading swiftly from his own , he had not -- and it was typical of the man that he did not -- forget Lance Carlyon 's friendliness ; a more equal friendliness than that of most . There was no need to drag him into the quarrel , the more so because the disloyalty of the Sikh pioneers was doubtful . They might complicate matters at the beginning . So he had locked and barred them into the inner courtyard , out of the way . But Captain Dering , he knew , was outside ! Let him be alone with his troopers , as he , Roshan would be alone with them ! Let them both try their influence ; let them try conclusions on these terms . That was but fair . This first step , however , necessitated others . The original plot , with its waiting for the dawn , its cumbrous mechanism of keys , and pilgrims , and God knows what , was not to his liking . He meant to fight . And if , as the conspirators had asserted , some of the warders were friends hand and foot , his men could crack the nut of the gaol in half an hour . The sooner the better . Pidar Narâyan , he knew , had recognized him , and he was a fox for wiliness . Then , Captain Dering must be after him even now . And Dillon - sahib might be on the alert any time . So the coup de main must come at once . As to what might follow , that might be after the fashion of Meerut in ' 57 , or not . Who could tell the end of anything ? The beginning would be an opportunity for fair fight between him and a thief . Once more the epithet "
115900	116216	115114	115114	they	3009	" scorched and shrivelled him with vague remorse , not for Laila -- she was but a woman , a woman who had played him false and who deserved the worst -- but for that shot in the dark . For there were two Roshans , warring fiercely in heart and brain . Then , after his mad , reckless ride to the gaol , the first realities had come to him in the sight of Dr. Dillon , standing with the light in his hand to welcome friends ; and in the sound of those two snap - shots proclaiming foes . Why ? The question had come swiftly . What quarrel had he with Dr. Dillon ? Or with Eugene Smith , whose tall , gaunt figure showed behind the other ? Eugene Smith , who must have brought his wife , his child , with him ! The horror , the terror of what might come , swept through the quondam prize pupil of a mission school ; the horror , the terror , in the remembrance of the Great Mutiny , which is , alas ! a legacy of wrong to young India . Which ties her hand and foot ; which makes those who are worthy of the name shrink instinctively from anything which may rouse the underlying savagery -- the unavoidable savagery -- of their countrymen . Could he hold his troopers ? Could he be sure ? He had come to curse . Was it too late to bless ? Then the memory of Laila -- the whole hateful tale which was irrevocable -- struck him hopeless . He was damned utterly ; he could not escape . He sat rigid as a statue on his horse for a second ; then with a wild fury gave the orders for his troopers to dismount and force the gates . "
116224	116490	115114	115114	they	3009	" had come the answer , making him smile proudly . That , at any rate , could not be stolen from him now . Now he could fight and die in what should have been his real position . Yet , once more , when the search - light had come to throw that group of excited men hacking and hewing at doors closed by authority into significant black - and - white relief , that doubt had returned ; that desire to be on the side , once more , of men like Dr. Dillon , whose bold resolve to be alone responsible for his gaol , which the warder 's tale revealed , filled him with admiration . But that sudden throwing up of a trooper 's hands , that sidelong stumble into death , had left Roshan cruel as death itself ; for the man thus killed had been to him as a brother . So he had gone on with a fresh impulse towards revenge , and for a time found forgetfulness in the excitement , the action . For though the first gate , that one giving on the open sort of porch , had yielded , almost at once , to the troopers outside and the warders within , the second , barring the arched tunnel , was a tougher job . It was not until this had given way , and the attacking party were completely sheltered from the fire of the little garrison on the roof , that there was leisure for that thought to return : "
116502	116840	116498	116498	I	0	" No man , it may be said broadly , ever fights without feeling that the battle is an appeal to a tribunal beyond himself , and Roshan did not feel this . Then the remembrance of the woman , the child , upstairs came persistently , burdened by the weight of that past tragedy which , in India , it is impossible to forget . And this was a woman who had always been courteous to him , a child to whom he had given toys . What was he doing ? The men were at work on the last , the strongest gate , with every tool they could find . Not many , for Dr. Dillon 's forethought had left them before barred doors everywhere . The delay had already been great ; would be greater . They must be close now on the lines of the original plot , at which Roshan had laughed , for the dawn was showing faintly -- a mere promise of light to come -- in the east . And the storm was passing . The dull reverberations of faint thunder were lost now in the cries , the blows of those at work trying to batter down the iron bars . A sudden distaste -- more than regret or repentance -- came to Roshan as he stood silent , watching blow after blow ; a sudden doubt . Which was the right ? No man worth calling a man ever fights for anything else ; every man worth calling one fights for that . But which was right ? Those men , hacking and hewing , or the little garrison upstairs ? There were no such searchings of heart there , at any rate ; no question as to what they were doing , though at that exact moment they were engaged in the trivial occupation of drinking tea . Muriel Smith had made it , at Dr. Dillon 's suggestion , against this very pause ; this "
116843	117015	116498	116498	I	0	" which he had foreseen . And in the making of it she had used a continental tea - basket which more than once had been her companion on the Brindisi route . Dr. Dillon had laid hands on it in his foraging , and as she had boiled the kettle , the rush and roar of a train racing through the peaceful French champaignes had seemed to be in her ears , instead of that rush and roar of blows and shouting which was now rising from every part of the gaol ; though the prisoners were still helpless for evil in their sections . So the three men , haggard , anxious , drank their tea in silence , hastily ; yet with a curious insistence , as if the triviality gave them a hold on things familiar , things beyond this midsummer - night 's dream of madness . But the child chattered as she munched a biscuit ; chattered of the charms of this strange picnic on the "
117030	117075	116498	116498	I	0	" The unconscious little voice struck a chill to the men 's hearts , but the woman smiled , as mothers can do when they wish to guard that blessed unconsciousness to the last ; the unconsciousness of which they are guardians by right . "
117086	117102	116498	116498	I	0	" remarked Dr. Dillon , suddenly , with a quaint professional reminiscence ; then added , "
117174	117196	117171	117172	a godsend	3017	" Eugene Smith looked up sharply , almost as if he meant a disclaimer ; then he gave a brief assent . "
117214	117272	117299	117299	he	68	" He pointed to that faint promise of light in the east , and Vincent Dering 's eyes followed his hand with the doubtful look of one sick to death , as he watches the long weary night merge once more into another long weary day of certain pain . There was an utter hopelessness in it . "
117275	117280	117299	117299	he	68	" he echoed slowly , "
117286	117287	117288	117288	Carlyon	68	" "
117301	117345	117346	117346	They	3019	" asked the doctor , deliberately helping himself to another lump of sugar , deliberately trying to keep the pulse beats of those around him as near normal as might be -- and there had been something beyond it in Vincent 's voice . "
117373	117374	117376	117376	you	0	" "
117384	117390	117391	117391	We	3020	" put in Eugene Smith . "
117406	117407	117395	117398	some of the townspeople	3021	" "
117410	117419	117395	117398	some of the townspeople	3021	storm"--began Vincent . The doctor shook his head . "
117449	117506	117443	117443	they	3019	" He paused and listened , for a sudden silence had fallen on the turmoil beneath , and out of it came an all too familiar sound , the clank of leg irons . Some of the prisoners , therefore , had managed to break out of their dormitories ; or were these the solitary cellers ? "
117514	117521	117507	117507	I	0	" he muttered , almost petulantly , "
117527	117547	117548	117549	Dr. Dillon	69	" But there was to be another ; for , from below , a voice rose loud and clear . "
117593	117613	117616	117616	I	0	" George Dillon was on his feet at once , but Captain Dering stopped him ; his eyes ablaze . "
117622	117627	117616	117616	I	0	" he said sharply . "
117652	117665	117649	117649	I	0	" Dr. Dillon gave one glance at the woman and the child . "
117673	117773	117649	117649	I	0	" he answered ; and Eugene Smith , husband and father , nodded acquiescence . Roshan Khân was standing in full view as Vincent Dering stepped up to the parapet . His face was raised ; there was almost an appeal in it . But every atom of that , every atom almost of humanity , vanished as he recognized his captain . His hand went instinctively to his revolver . Then a thought seemed to come to him . He drew himself up proudly , and waited for the answer . It came , keen as a knife . "
117794	117808	117786	117786	I	0	" There was half a second 's silence ; then a wild laugh : "
117820	117998	117786	117786	I	0	" The words and the crack of Vincent 's revolver -- the bullet of which , aimed too high , passed through Roshan 's turban - were almost lost in the answering yell . But the risaldar stood his ground for a second , then coolly sought shelter . That was over ! They were quits now for the fair fight . And fate had been kind . He had unwittingly offered this man -- his greatest enemy -- a safe conduct ; and it had been refused , luckily . Well ! let Vincent Dering take the whole consequences . The blood of one woman was already on his head ; so would be the blood spilt here . He , Roshan , would need have no further scruples . So , as if it had gained strength from the brief respite , the turmoil recommenced ; and now Roshan Khân 's voice could be heard urging the men on . And there were answering shouts from different parts of the gaol . George Dillon frowned . "
118051	118088	118089	118089	They	3031	" Vincent , who was standing at the top of the stairs which led to the ten - feet drop , ran down a few steps and listened . Then he looked up quickly and nodded . "
118105	118106	118101	118101	them	3031	" "
118157	118274	118152	118152	Carlyon	68	" A sudden hurry and urgency had come to the struggle , and Dr. Dillon passed restlessly to the other side of the roof . The sky was lightening faintly . More because the dust had sought dust again , the earth earth , than from any increase of light ; and so the broad ray of the search - light , widening as it went , lost itself in the distant darkness , and there was nothing to be seen riverwards . But close at hand two men -- one in a warder 's uniform -- were running towards the gaol , shouting . The doctor was back to the inner parapet in a second . "
118325	118342	118345	118345	dear	3039	" Eugene , who had been standing beside her , laid his hand on her shoulder . "
118347	118352	118345	118345	dear	3039	" he said gently ; "
118366	118379	118345	118345	dear	3039	" Muriel turned white , but stood quite firm , quite calm . "
118385	118397	118398	118398	You	3041	" she said , holding out her hand to the child . "
118416	118495	118345	118345	dear	3039	" she broke down a little , partly because she was passing Vincent , and he , busy loading various rifles and revolvers , kept his eyes studiously from her . But Gladys did not choose to pass her friend in this fashion . She paused , a dainty little figure in a blue dressing - gown , like her mother , and with the same fluffy golden curls about her coaxing , delicate little child 's face . "
118505	118509	118345	118345	dear	3039	" she said . "
118522	118549	118554	118554	Gladys	276	" Something that was not all desire to check that formula made the man pause , too , to lift her gently , and kiss her . "
118579	118594	118572	118574	a brave girl	3043	" The coaxing face was close to the haggard , haunted - looking one . "
118621	118626	118627	118627	I	0	" The haggardness vanished . "
118638	118657	118662	118662	you	276	" He put the child down hastily , at a crash . The moment for courage had come . "
118665	118670	118662	118662	you	276	" shouted the doctor . "
118682	118714	118678	118678	'em	3046	" The door had gone , indeed ; and in a second the courtyard beneath them was half full of naked , desperate men ; the worst characters in the gaol . "
118745	118937	118938	118938	They	3048	" came the doctor 's voice in jerks , as he leant over the parapet just above the centre of the door below , and carried out his own orders with deadly effect ; though his heart sank when he saw that some of the prisoners were unironed -- or rather unironed on one leg , and that they were armed with the other iron ; a deadly enough weapon at close quarters . Besides , it meant more treachery . It meant a previous filing of the ankle - fetters ; and if others in the remaining sections were as free-- He shot quicker , steadier , while Eugene Smith and Vincent , one above the other on the top of the stair , did the same , taking the intruders on the flank . It was growing lighter every instant , the air was clearer , the breeze of dawn was sweeping the smoke of the rifles riverwards , the great white wheel of the gaol was growing broader in its outlines , the shadows were shrinking . But the storm seemed still there , in the ceaseless reverberations . "
118948	118952	118938	118938	They	3048	" called Eugene . "
118964	118980	118957	118957	Dillon	69	" The doctor ceased firing for a second , and ran farther down the parapet . "
118987	118992	118993	118993	They	3048	" he shouted back . "
119022	119125	119014	119014	'em	3051	" So , for the next minute , it was deadly work down in that corner by the crevice through which some unseen hand was thrusting something . Three times a man , clutching at the prize , fell in a heap ere he touched it . Then a fourth pitched forward against the doors with the keys in his hand , and a fifth , groping for them , rolled over on his side with them hidden under his dead body . And from outside the gate came rendings , and crashings , and yells ; from above , that call , "
119135	119246	119247	119247	He	3054	" Muriel crept out from shelter , possessed once more by that frantic desire to see to the very end , and stood looking down on those two on the stairs . She gave a faint cry when Vincent flung his rifle away , and ran down to that ten - foot drop for revolver practice . At the sound , her husband gave one quick look up , and followed suit . But their own success was against them . The growing pile of the wounded formed a barricade , behind which a man , squirming with covetous hands among the dead and dying , found what he sought . "
119258	119317	119256	119256	him	3054	" There was a fusillade , the man dropped ; but the keys were in another hand -- another -- another -- passing outwards from the crush -- outwards towards that low door at the end of the narrow alley . Without a word , Vincent , revolver in hand , let himself drop on the heads below . "
119328	119354	119323	119323	Vincent	71	" came a woman 's voice ; and at the sound , another man gave that swift look up once more , and followed suit . "
119359	119366	119323	119323	Vincent	71	" said Dr. Dillon , sharply . "
119381	119690	119323	119323	Vincent	71	" And still , as he spoke , he kept singling out a foe and firing . The chance , even with his help , was a poor one in that crowd , where there was always another dark hand to snatch at the prize , and pass it nearer to the door -- that door which was the key to so much ! Yet , the crush through which they fought lessening , those two Englishmen found themselves with the straight alley before them for a race . A race against three men , without arms , but without irons ; and with a fair start . While close behind was the crush -- the crowd ! It was nothing but a race , now , since the revolvers had done their worst , had fired their last shot ; a race with the hope -- if Vincent could come up with those three -- of using a Goorkha kukri , which he had thrust into the yellow silk sash he wore instead of a waistcoat beneath his red jacket -- thrust it therewith an ugly frown as a last argument for his foes , when he had seen it lying among the pile of miscellaneous weapons Dr. Dillon had foraged from the Smiths ' house . It had a dainty ivory handle -- Vincent had given it to Mrs. Smith himself , and its last use had been to cut the pages of a fashion paper-- It had a sterner job now . But Vincent was behind ; a yard or two -- no more . He had fired one more shot before beginning the race , and Eugene 's legs were longer . Yet the yard meant all things , and he knew it ; so as he ran , his hand sought the knife . "
119699	119703	119694	119694	Smith	74	" he called . "
119727	119811	119816	119816	he	3058	" As he spoke , a glittering curve sped from his hand to the other man 's feet . Then he pulled up and faced the crowd behind with his clubbed revolver . The lane was very narrow . Three men could barely breast it shoulder to shoulder . Surely one could bar it by swift blows and slow retreat ! For a time , at any rate -- time for the opening and shutting of a door ! He could but try . "
119821	119829	119830	119830	I	0	" gasped the woman who was watching . "
119841	120068	119839	119839	mum	3622	" said the child , who clutched at her hand , watching , too , with great , wide , uncomprehending eyes . But the man beside them held his breath . So retreating , step by step , Vincent Dering kept the crowd back , lured the crowd on , safe -- so far ! For these , the first , the swiftest , were naturally the unironed , therefore , the unarmed . But there were others , forcing their way to the front , who would be harder to deal with . Vincent threw his head back and wondered how Eugene was faring ; for he dared not turn his face from his task even for a second . Had those three been caught up ? Had the kukri helped ? It had . And one of those three had fallen before a flash , as of light . And another ! But the third had the key in the door ; had turned it , when Eugene struck him from behind . With a wild yell he flung his full weight on the door ; it burst open , and the two fell headlong into the tower beyond . But only for a second . Eugene Smith was up again , had the key out , and in on the further side . "
120072	120076	119839	119839	mum	3622	" he shouted ; "
120087	120117	120083	120083	I	0	" Vincent Dering gave one sharp look round . The door was not four yards from him , but the crowd was not one . There was no time . "
120121	120125	120126	120126	I	0	" he called , "
120131	120163	120126	120126	I	0	" Eugene Smith stood uncertain ; the door ajar . The keys ! ah ! what could he do with the keys if he went back to help -- and if not-- "
120180	120205	120174	120176	a good fellow	3060	" The four yards were two now , were one . Then slowly the door closed , and Vincent had his back against it . "
120212	120243	120210	120210	Vincent	71	" The agonized cry echoed above all other cries , but only for an instant ; the next , George Dillon 's hand was gagging the lips which uttered it . "
120246	120251	120210	120210	Vincent	71	" he said fiercely . "
120281	120370	120278	120278	I	0	" And a great hush came . The sound of blows , of iron clashing on iron , and falling with a dull thud on something softer , seemed to fill the world and leave room for nothing else . Nothing except a softer sound still . A shuddering moan , as a woman slipped to her knees , and covered her face with her hands ; then slipped lower still to the ground , in a heap . But the child looked at her mother , surprised . "
120386	120780	120278	120278	I	0	" she asked , in a concerned little voice . Had an hour passed , or twain ? Ninian Bruce could not tell . It seemed to him that he had been kneeling for a lifetime , there on the altar steps beside the dying girl , with the glittering red - and - gold drapery trailing to the white marble , and opening to a white breast stained red,--a brighter red ! A long lifetime ; long as his own ; that long life in which he had seen , had felt , so much . For as he waited for her inevitable death , his mind had followed that long life of his own , year after year , day after day , hour after hour . And everywhere it had seen a woman 's eyes , a woman 's soul , looking back from a soul , from eyes , that should have been a man 's . Yes ! the keynote of that long life had been the love of a woman . Passionate love , absorbing mind as well as body , claiming its reward in kind ; as such love always does . In kind ! There lay the whole difference between anathema and beata . They were both karma , or desire ! One of the girl 's white feet slid with a silvery jingle of its anklet to the next step , and , as he replaced it to a more comfortable position , a chill struck to his heart as he remembered what such chiming had meant in the past history of the world . The measure which that provoked was -- anathema . That -- disguised , palliated , refined in a thousand ways -- was one kind . And the other ? The memory of his own past surged to his brain as he bent over the girl 's whitening face and scanned it narrowly . How like the face was to that other one , now that coming death had sharpened the full , youthful curves . He had noticed the likeness often -- it had been clear when Laila had worn the old Italian -- Beatrice's -- dress . But not so clear , not half so clear , as when in this -- this almost shameless one -- she had said--"I
120786	120999	120784	120784	him	3064	" It might have been Margherita speaking,--Margherita , who had wanted a man 's soul . And she had had one . That was the other kind . But both were desire ; the desire which drove humanity from Paradise , and keeps it vainly seeking for one still . Saturated as he was with the mysticism of the East and West , these thoughts came to him , dreamily , making him feel curiously aloof from himself . The pity of it filled him , and brought a pity for the dying girl also ; the girl who had failed to find a paradise in this world , and was seeking a new road to it ; seeking it alone . The only thing she craved in all God 's earth to make that paradise -- gone ! Priest as he was , the humanity in him rose in passionate hope that she should not wake to the consciousness of this . What good would it do ? Let her enter the shadows in peace . But as he wished the wish , her head , which had been resting on his arm , turned to the touch of it , and her smooth cheek nestled closer to what it found . "
121005	121025	121003	121003	Vincent	71	" she said , and her voice came back full , rich , round , to make the claim . "
121034	121047	121048	121048	Vincent	71	" The old man gave a slight shiver , and was silent . "
121050	121056	121003	121003	Vincent	71	" came the voice again ; "
121075	121163	121065	121065	You	71	" There was another silent pause , and then , silent still , Father Ninian stooped , and the old lips and the young ones met in a lover 's kiss . And as they met , he knew that in that kiss lay the great renunciation of his life ; that henceforward there would be no woman waiting in Paradise for him ; that the spiritual presence had gone from his life like the bodily presence . That Margherita was Juliet , and Juliet , Margherita ! "
121168	121174	121065	121065	You	71	" murmured Laila , softly ; "
121179	121445	121065	121065	You	71	" Her head settled to his arm again , and the silence went on . On and on , till he stooped lower to listen for an unheard breath ; then lower still to shift that head from his arm to the ground . For the need of a human touch , a human sympathy , had gone forever . He made the sign of the cross over the dead body , rose to his feet unsteadily , and looked about him , dazed , uncertain . In truth , he felt all his years for the first time ; felt that his last hold on life had somehow gone from him in that kiss ; that something more than one woman lay dead before him . Then the sight of Akbar Khân , still rocking himself backwards and forwards , a perfect pendulum of protesting innocence and helpless remorse , roused the old priest to the present . He took up the rapier he had laid aside in crossing the chapel , and passed over to where the old eunuch was bemoaning the high - handedness of fate . It was a tyranny , indeed ! Who could have foreseen such an ending to a very ordinary intrigue ? Who could even have dreamt of it ? Had not men and women loved and met , thus , since the beginning of time ? So , to the sinner 's outraged experience of life and love came the saint with his , and with the face and sword of St. Michael and All Angels . "
121451	121456	121065	121065	You	71	" he said sternly ; "
121470	121523	121065	121065	You	71	" In truth there was not much to tell . It was all so simple , viewed as a whole ; so complex in detail . And , as he listened , the anger left Pidar Narâyan 's face wistful , wondering . More so than ever at the last mumbling excuse . "
121559	121599	121537	121538	the Almighty	2398	" Anâri Begum ! On whom be peace ! Her sainted ancestress , on whom be peace ! He stood for an instant looking towards the Altar , towards the dead girl ; then he echoed under his breath , "
121605	121672	121537	121538	the Almighty	2398	" That was the end . Peace on those women who had loved and died ; and on the men who had loved them -- lived for them -- perhaps died for them . But for the rest who lived and loved still ? A quick life seemed to come back to him at the thought of these , a desire to save them from death . "
121676	121685	121537	121538	the Almighty	2398	" he said briefly to the old retainer ; "
121701	121900	121693	121693	I	0	" So , still in his robes , with the blubbering old pantaloon -- apostle of another cult -- at his heels , he passed down the arched passage to the door at its end which opened on to the courtyard between the palace and the Fort . And as he went , his brain , confused as to the past , clear as to the present , was busy making plans for peace . So far as helping those at the gaol went , he knew himself to be powerless . Physically , a couple of old men -- mere shadows of men -- could give no help , and he could not hope for influence there , among the Hosts of the Devil . But here in the city , among those Hosts of the Lord -- the pilgrims for whom he had always had a secret sympathy , who knew him , at least , by reputation -- with whom , at least , he stood on common ground -- he might have some . He could but try ; try to persuade some , at least , of the great mass of seekers after the "
121905	122553	122556	122556	Ramanund	163	" to go on their way in peace when the dawn came ; try to save some of them from following a wrong road . The door was slightly ajar ; he widened the chink and looked out with a sinking heart over the courtyard with its raised union - jack of paths . Much larger than the yard about the Pool of Immortality , it was crammed from end to end now with a crowd , the first look at which told him that his chance of a hearing was small indeed , for the dawn was closer than he had thought for amid the shadows of the chapel , and the grey glimmer of coming light showed him once more a sea of upturned eager faces . But the patience of the previous dawn was gone . They were restless now , restless with the vague , uncertain restlessness which is so dangerous in a crowd , which tells that the fuel for the flame is only awaiting a match , any match , to fire it . And there were many only waiting to be struck . The next instant might bring one . Father Ninian felt this instinctively , felt that here in this courtyard lay the mine which the returning troopers , the desperadoes from the gaol , were to fire first . All Eshwara might rise afterwards , but the great danger lay here , must be grappled with here . But how ? Not by words . The ear of a crowd is always difficult to gain , unless the eye is taken first , and a man had both already . For aloft , on the barrel of the big old gun which centred the square , jogi Gorakh - nâth was expounding their wrongs to the pilgrims , their inevitable damnation if the wrath of the Gods was not instantly appeased . His wild , weird figure , in all its nakedness , its austerity , could be seen above the little circle of lamps which his immediate supporters held upwards at arm's - length . And above his head , like a canopy , drifted the wisps of tired earth - atoms which were being driven sideways by the breeze of dawn as they fell in their search for rest . For the storm was over , their brief ambition for something beyond mere earth was past . Wisps , which , as they swept over the circling lights , took a lurid glow , then faded into the dim shadows again . And something else caught the light redly . The chaplet of human skulls , the dread Mother 's necklace , which the jogi swung from one hand to the other as he called for blood -- for blood to appease Her -- the Mother of all -- the Eternal Womanhood ! Since without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins . The tenet of all religions echoed into the ear of the crowd , the strange demoniacal figure , in its lurid setting , held its eye . What chance was there for a single voice ? None . Yet something must be done . For the dawn was nigh . Every instant the light grew . Any moment might bring that inrush of evil from the gaol which would breed violence among these still peaceful folk ; the ignorant , helpless folk who were being held captive by words against the coming of that inrush . Suddenly , for a second , the attention of the crowd wavered . A tall man in the white dress of a Europeanized native had been hoisted to the shoulders of some others , not far from the jogi , and so , from this coign of vantage , prepared to harangue the people . "
122558	122574	122575	122575	He	3068	" said someone close to where Father Ninian stood in the shadow of the door . "
122608	122643	122586	122586	he	3068	" Nor good either . For the first words of that appeal of culture to ignorance were drowned in a fiendish laugh , a frenzied rattling of the dread chaplet , a loud defiance . "
122731	122824	122712	122712	Ramanund	163	" The allusion to the death of Ramanund 's wife roused an instant murmur of assent from those who were of the city , and they passing the tale on to others , the murmur swelled to a roar which effectively drowned the rest of Ramanund 's advice . But Father Ninian , still at the door , still uncertain , could hear a man who had been buckling on his pilgrim 's sandals as if for a start , say , as he stood up and thrust them back to his waistcloth:-- "
122869	122870	122860	122861	No man	3908	" "
122890	122903	122871	122871	He	3082	" sniggered a neighbour . But a third voice broke in gravely , "
122950	122951	122952	122954	Baba - jee	149	" "
122958	122963	122952	122954	Baba - jee	149	" assented another bystander , "
123015	123055	123009	123009	him	3094	" There was a faint sound as of the closing of a door , and beyond it , in the darkness of the arched passage , an old voice said , with a curious note of gladness in it , "
123077	123150	123009	123009	him	3094	" It seemed to have come to Pidar Narâyan 's face as he knelt hurriedly once more beside the body of the dead girl , to fold her dead hands decently as if in prayer , to cover the dead feet with the crimson draperies , the dead face with the flimsy , glittering veil -- the veil which hid nothing of its beauty -- which struck the keynote of the whole . "
123156	123286	123009	123009	him	3094	" he whispered as he rose , stretching out his thin old hand in benediction ; and as he said the words , the vision came to him of a whole world which had loved , and sinned , and gone on its mysterious quest for something beyond love . A world to which he had said farewell with a kiss . He passed on to the Altar , and with swift , steady hands opened the sanctuary , and took out the treasure it contained ; a star - shaped , star - rayed pyx , set with jewels , relic of the days when singing - birds that sang of themselves , and such like things , with many another , had come to Eshwara from Italy . "
123296	123300	123294	123294	Akbar	110	" he said , "
123319	123324	123294	123294	Akbar	110	" The old courtier mumbled "
123333	123583	123294	123294	Akbar	110	" with a caper of alacrity . In his confusion , his resentful remorse , it was a relief to return to pomp -- to servility . So , with that Bodily Presence which , till then , had always brought the thought of the lost paradise of a woman 's love with it , in his hands , Father Ninian and his strange acolyte , priest of another cult , passed swiftly out of the chapel , leaving the Altar dark , bereft of its treasure ; leaving the dead woman , bereft of her treasure also , lying in a glitter of gold and crimson on the Altar steps . Passed on a mission of peace to the living ; on the chance of gaining the ear , the eye , of that waiting crowd outside in the courtyard . As he went rapidly , yet with the faltering step every now and again of one wearied by long journeying , down the arched passage , Ninian Bruce scarcely thought of success or failure . There was a wistful triumph in his face -- he looked as a slave might look who dies in making himself free . He did not think even of the strangeness of the little procession . The night had been so full of strange things ; but the dawn had come , and he had a message to give those waiting souls outside -- the souls who were being kept back from the "
123588	123597	123603	123603	Akbar	110	" by that fear of the Eternal Womanhood . "
123605	123616	123603	123603	Akbar	110	" he said , and then his voice merged into the "
123619	123733	123603	123603	Akbar	110	" So , as the crowd turned at the sound of the opening door , the sound of the chanting voice , it saw , raised above it , dim against an arched shadow , seen by the grey light of daybreak and the flicker of two tall tapers , a strange star - rayed cup shining in the clasped hands of a man . An old man in a strange dress , chanting a strange song . And the sight , by its very strangeness , its claim to something beyond familiarity , was not strange to that restless crowd , waiting for a sign , waiting for something not in themselves . "
123742	123762	123765	123766	Pidar Narâyan	84	" The whisper came like the soft hush of a wave ; and above it the chant rose clearly . "
123771	123830	123765	123766	Pidar Narâyan	84	" said those of the city who knew , as they fell back instinctively from the raised path . And those who did not know followed suit in awed bewilderment , till the way was clear , and the little procession passed on slowly above the jammed mass of humanity , above the sea of upturned expectant faces . "
123842	123849	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	" said one here and there . "
123859	123860	123851	123851	he	84	" "
123867	123915	123851	123851	he	84	" answered others . That slantwise limb of the union - jack of raised paths which crossed from one corner to the other of the courtyard -- from the door in the palace to the wide archway through which the pilgrims always passed on their way to the "
123919	123950	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	Gods"--cleared itself by common consent , edged itself with a thicker throng of curious faces . Only in the middle it was barred by the big old gun , by the "
123954	124018	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	" as its legend boasted , and by the man who claimed to be its mouthpiece . For jogi Gorakh - nâth , recognizing his adversary , recognizing the danger of his influence , had slipped from his post above , and now stood before the gun , full in the path , defending it with frenzied wavings of his chaplet of skulls . "
124024	124028	124022	124022	brothers	880	" he yelled . "
124045	124180	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	" And now a new curiosity , a new interest , came to that crowd of mere men . What would happen ? What would these two , mere men like themselves , do ? Which was backed by divine authority ? That both claimed that authority was clear . It held its breath , partly from the desire for a sign from God , partly because of the desire which humanity always has for a sign of the best man . Let the two try which was the better . So it waited , ready to approve either , till those two , the Eastern and the Western sacerdotalisms , met face to face , within two yards of each other , in the centre of the courtyard , on the platform before the "
124185	124221	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	" Then , not till then , Pidar Narâyan ceased his chant , shifted the pyx to his left hand , and with his right drew the rapier hidden till then by his long robes . "
124230	124332	123833	123834	Pidar Narâyan	84	" sighed the crowd approvingly . There would be a bodily as well as a spiritual fight , for jogi - jee 's chaplet of skulls swirled dangerously for both attack and defence ; since a swinging blow from it would kill a man , and its circling sweep keep him beyond sword - point reach . Which would be the better man -- the better weapon ? But Pidar Narâyan did not attack . He only stood , the pyx in one hand , the sword in the other -- alternatives as it were -- and called in a loud voice-- "
124342	124349	124337	124340	jogi Gorakh - nâth	141	" Let me pass I say ! "
124356	124468	124470	124470	me	0	" Over the whole courtyard , waking now from shadow to light under the coming day , the claim echoed sharply ; and the arrogance of it , the strength , the certainty of it , sank deep into the souls of those who heard it . There was not a sound , not a movement ; only a vast , breathless expectancy , and Pidar Narâyan 's fine old face set like the nether mill - stone . Everything that had ever been in him -- love , passion , faith , worldly wisdom , sympathy -- the grit of the whole man -- rose up and claimed the crowd . "
124473	124565	124470	124470	me	0	" he cried again , in absolute command , and this time the rapier , twisting like a snake , caught the chaplet of skulls in its upward swirl , a dexterous unexpected turn of the old fencer 's wrist followed , sending it flying from the jogi 's hand . The next instant ( the rope on which they were strung severed by the strain , by the rapier 's edge ) , the skulls were clattering , bounding like balls , like useless toys , on the stone platform . "
124574	124648	124470	124470	me	0	" came from the crowd ; but the sigh was but half content , and men looked at each other wonderingly . Since , no matter which priest was the better man , these were Mai Kali 's drinking - cups . The jogi , however , had fallen back a step , and Pidar Narâyan was in his place by the old gun . Pidar Narâyan and his strange God were now the "
124653	124695	124470	124470	me	0	" What had they to say ? The crowd had not to wait long , for Father Ninian 's voice , with that nameless ring in it which makes the orator and makes the audience , was already in its ears . "
124730	124762	124765	124765	your	3102	" We are free , brothers ! you and I. The Eternal Womanhood hath had Her toll , in full . The Great Mother is appeased . There is no fear . "
124788	124955	124956	124958	Jai Kali Ma	285	" He pointed with the sword -- as he paused a second for breath , for strength -- to the mountains ; to those far peaks which , now that the storm had ended , the earth - atoms returned to earth , had begun to show spectral in the dawn . To show shadowy , yet clear , with never a wreath of mist or a wandering cloud to hide the hollow whither the feet of millions had journeyed seeking righteousness , and journeyed in vain . Faint and far they showed against the faint , far sky , but as Father Ninian pointed to them , a ray of light from the still unseen sun below the visible horizon of this world , a ray of light seeking perhaps another world among the stars , found the heights of the holy hills in its path , and dyed their snowdrifts red -- blood red ! At the sight a roar rose from the crowd . "
124987	124988	124992	124993	my father	3098	" "
124996	125000	125002	125002	mine	0	" cried one . "

125009	125022	125007	125007	mine	0	" assented some , while others forgot all save pilgrimage in the shout-- "

125040	125106	125109	125110	the Gods	3472	" So , on that babel of sounds , Pidar Narâyan 's voice rose steadily as , preceded by that ambling figure -- strangest of all acolytes -- he walked on , chanting the 121st Psalm:-- The words were in an unknown tongue , the rhythm strange , but the spirit , the idea , were familiar . It was the song of someone seeking the "
125112	125117	125118	125118	He	3107	" as they were . "
125128	125140	125141	125142	The other	1012	" said an old man , pushing his way to follow . "
125153	125154	125148	125148	he	3107	" "
125159	125175	125148	125148	he	3107	" assented many , following suit . And some , shrugging their shoulders , said , "
125207	125208	125148	125148	he	3107	" "
125216	125278	125279	125279	Lo	123	" Thus , swiftly , the footfalls gathered in strength behind the little procession , and no one dared to stop it ; not even the Mahomedan sentry at the Fort gate , to whom some of the agitators ran in their disappointment . He only laughed contemptuously ; though his gravity returned somewhat at his recognition of old Akbar Khân . "
125289	125298	125279	125279	Lo	123	" he muttered , in an awed voice . "
125341	125374	125332	125332	We	3119	" He twirled his mustache fiercely , and wondered when his comrades would return victorious from the gaol , and give the word for plunder . That was all he cared for . "
125377	125387	125332	125332	We	3119	" assented an angry voice , joining the group , "
125403	125404	125399	125400	wise men	4070	" "
125407	125412	125399	125400	wise men	4070	" put in another ; "
125424	125575	125399	125400	wise men	4070	" It was true . The crowd had broken into groups , and from these , pilgrims , singly , or in smaller groups , were drifting after the lessening sound of that chanting voice . Not so much from any belief in Pidar Narâyan , not even because of his lead over , but because it was the old way ; the way worn by the feet of their fathers , and their fathers ' fathers . So jogi Gorakh - nâth , who , now the coast was clear , had sprung aloft on the old gun , once more attempting to regain his empire , failed egregiously . The crowd passed him by till a big countryman , with a lumbering jest , asked him if he was sure he had picked up the right skull to put on his own shoulders . Then it laughed uproariously . "
125585	125597	125399	125400	wise men	4070	" suggested a conspirator , consolingly , as he hurried past . "
125648	125649	126361	126361	Ducker	288	" "
125652	125656	126361	126361	Ducker	288	" added another , "
125679	125731	126361	126361	Ducker	288	" Jogi Gorakh - nâth , with a scowl , gathered up his skulls to a bundle and followed hastily . He would at least be out of hearing of that chanting voice . It had reached the last verse of its Psalm now , and faltered a little over the words:-- "
125747	126360	126361	126361	Ducker	288	" But the echo of the footsteps behind filled up the blanks . On the gaol or the Pool of Immortality lay the hopes of those whom Pidar Narâyan had so far discomfited by his arrogant claim to stand between heaven and earth ; in other words , to be in personal relations with the Great Awarder of gaols and immortalities , forgivenesses , and punishments . But the stars in their courses , hidden though they had been by the storm - darkness , had used that very darkness to the due maintenance of law and order as they wheeled serenely to meet the coming dawn . When Lance , for instance -- his heart torn in twain by his desire to follow Erda 's fate at all costs and his knowledge that , if he was to do the best for others he must leave her to face it alone -- had struck down stream on Am - ma 's strange craft , his sole intention had been to rouse the police camp , and secure what help he could for the gaol . But the darkness set him another task . For , after drifting past the spit , whence he had meant to cut across by land to the bridge of boats , and so , creeping past the city , find the camp beyond it , he had lost himself absolutely in the maze of sand - banks and shallow channels which , when the river was low , as it was now , lay like a network between the deep stream of the Hara , and the deep stream of the Hari . Lost himself so utterly that , realizing his own bewilderment , he had called himself a fool for having lost himself ! A curious discouragement came to him . Yet it made him more dogged and persistent , even while the hopelessness of finding his way grew every second . Surely , thought he , he could not be such a fool as to fail ! Sometimes a sudden belief that he really had had some faint indication of his bearings would make him put all his young strength into the paddle , until once more a soft , yielding , yet irresistible , impact came to tell him that he had failed again , that he was on another sandbank , and another , and another ! The dull concussion of them seemed to pass into his brain ; he found himself fumbling on almost aimlessly , despite his doggedness , his mind busy with imagining the things which might be happening in the dark around him . For all he knew close by-- There lay the sting ! It was suffocating to be set , as it were , in the solid darkness like -- he thought of a fly in amber , the birds he had limed in his boyhood , finally of a death mask . That was more like it -- he felt as the corpse must feel -- clogged , hampered , helpless ! In such conditions minutes seem hours ; and Lance , in reality , had not been drifting about for half of one before the certainty that his mission must inevitably be useless unless he could fulfil it more expeditiously , made him resolve on trying conclusions with the river at first hand . He was a good swimmer . As he told himself this , the first pulse of gratitude he had ever felt for the big bully who had chucked him , a small boy in his first term at Harrow , into "
126362	127066	127067	127068	You devil	3135	" to take his chance , came to him ; for those few minutes of despairing effort had taught him more than mere swimming ; they had taught him to trust himself in water . More , at any rate , than in a beastly contrivance made of beds and footballs , with no stem , no stern , and a devilish habit of spinning in every eddy like a teetotum ! The mere condemnation of Am - ma 's craft , being a prelude to better things , raised his spirits . He flung off his clothes , and , knowing he could not hope to keep his revolver dry , improvised a waistcloth out of the silk sash he wore instead of a waistcoat , in which to stick the hunting - knife that was his only other weapon . As he did so , he thought of the deer the knife had killed ; as men think idly , irrelevantly , of such trivialities when their attention is really concentrated on something that is , as yet , outside experience . And Lance , as he slipped into the water , knew himself prepared to swim or wade , but knew nothing else . So , doggedly as before , and infinitely quicker , he went on through the darkness ; sometimes feeling himself in the cool water , sometimes finding his feet on warm sand , sometimes parting a way , he knew not where , through the low tamarisk and high grass marking an island . If he could have guessed which island , or even known which way his face was set , these light swishing touches might have been guides ; but he knew nothing . Until , after a time , a faint far glow , a mere suspicion of something not outer darkness , showed on his left . Even so , he could not guess whether that meant the gaol side , or the city side of the rivers . If the former , could the gaol have been fired by those devils ? The thought made him set his teeth , and , dry sand being beneath his feet , run on recklessly towards the glow . Only for a yard or two , however ; then he pulled up short , amazed to find that it was not far , but near ; that it came from the ground , from a leaping fire of tamarisk branches within a stone 's throw of him . A step or two more , in fact , showed him a cooking - pot , the remains of some food , a familiar fishing - net , and a chrysalis - looking figure wrapped in a blanket and half - buried in the sand . One of the fisher folk , by all that was lucky ! If anyone could tell , they could . It was only a slender stem of tiger - grass which snapped under his feet , but the noise was sufficient . The sleeper sprang to his like a wild animal , the blanket falling from him , one lithe arm making for the long spear stuck in the sand beside him . Gu - gu ! The missing Gu - gu ! Lance had him back in his sand - bed before hand and spear met . There was no struggle . Gu - gu , knowing himself helpless , lay limp , slack , every muscle proclaiming capitulation ; in so far showing himself something less than a wild animal , which struggles till it dies , reckless of odds . But , in truth , Gu - gu , with the certainty of speedy extinction before him , due to that cursed ghost , had given in to fate utterly , all round . Death would come when it came . All that remained , therefore , was to make others suffer if he could . Especially those who were responsible for altering the currents of the river . With one of these on top of you , this was impossible ; but time might bring opportunity . "
127070	127083	127067	127068	You devil	3135	" cried Lance , throttling the abject jelly by way of emphasis , "
127124	127164	127113	127113	you	3134	" Gu - gu pointed in the direction whence Lance had come . The latter frowned , realizing that it was impossible to know if the brute spoke truth , but that , unfortunately , he must be trusted . "
127169	127186	127113	127113	you	3134	" he said curtly , taking care to keep the jelly within reach of his knife , "
127209	127219	127221	127222	the Huzoor	90	" He gave the yielding flesh an explanatory prick . "
127229	127250	127221	127222	the Huzoor	90	" asked Gu - gu , affably ; and the words made Lance remember that fruitless waiting for the water . "
127262	127267	127260	127260	you	3134	" he replied savagely , "
127322	127397	127279	127279	I	0	" Another prick with the knife he held in one hand , while his other clutched firmly on Gu - gu 's hemp - strung waist - belt of blue beads , started them . So they went on till the sand grew colder , less resistant , changed to water beneath their feet ; then Lance 's two hands -- and the knife -- came down on Gu - gu 's bare back . "
127401	127406	127279	127279	I	0	" he said briefly ; "
127411	127593	127594	127594	I	0	" The two pair of legs and the one pair of hands forged ahead into the darkness none the less rapidly because the second pair of hands were resting,--with something in them -- on yielding flesh . The fact indeed , or something else , seemed to make Gu - gu confidential . If the Huzoor , he said , with a shameless comprehension which made Lance inclined to use the knife then and there , wanted to give the alarm at the police camp , he was taking a long road to it . He , Gu - gu , could show him a shorter , if the Huzoor would trust him . For a second Lance hesitated . He could not see the man 's face ; but there was a sort of cunning anxiety in the tone which was doubtful . Then , remembering that , short or long , he was equally at the man 's mercy if he chose to brave results -- though there seemed to be no reason why he should -- he said quietly,-- "
127602	127603	127594	127594	I	0	" "
127609	127615	127616	127616	He	90	" asked Gu - gu . "
127625	127626	127620	127620	he	90	" "
127629	127633	127620	127620	he	90	" echoed Lance . "
127638	127758	127620	127620	he	90	" Because the short way , Gu - gu explained , was by an underground passage which could be only reached from the river . Undoubtedly the Huzoor was right , the passage had to do with the miracle ; but there must have been more than one miracle in the old days , since there was quite a network of canals and caves , which could be more or less flooded at will . All the river people knew of them , but few ventured in ; there was nothing to be gained by doing so , as a rule ! And the dive to reach the passage was long and awkward . But if the Huzoor would trust-- "
127762	127917	127922	127922	Huzoor	90	" broke in Lance , sharply . He had to trust ; and time meant everything . Besides , even in diving , he could have his revenge on that sleek , yielding back ! For answer , Gu - gu altered his course with almost suspicious alacrity ; though , once more , Lance could see no reason for treachery . A hundred rupees was a big bribe to a man who evidently had no personal interest in the matter ; else , why should he have been on the island instead of in the row . But then Lance did not know of that call to death . So , through the dark , the one pair of hands and two pairs of legs forged ahead till a sudden arrest of the former gave Lance a dull shock once more . But this time Gu - gu 's voice came quite cheerfully : "
127934	127955	127923	127924	This slave	4971	" Apparently it was up , and after a few minutes of crablike edging Gu - gu 's voice came again:-- "
128050	128297	128035	128035	him	4523	" The cool grasp of the position made Lance smile , though the situation , he knew , was grave enough . That breath to be drawn might be his last ; all the more reason why he could have wished it less full of sand ! For the storm was now at its fiercest . Even here out on the river , over the water , the air seemed solid . And it had a vibration that could be felt on the bare skin . As he drew in that long breath before trusting himself to the unseen man whom he held within reach of the grim signal -- and something sharper should there be sign of treachery -- Lance told himself that the water could scarcely be more suffocating than the air . Then -- the sleek skin under his hand shrinking from the knife - prick -- the two pairs of legs and the one pair of arms struck down . It was almost a relief at first to get rid of the stinging dust in one 's face ; almost a relief not to breathe . But when , after a few seconds , the legs in front of him grew rigid , and nothing was left to be done save to hold on desperately to a waist - belt of blue beads and one 's own breath at the same time , the sense of suffocation returned , and the question , "
128302	128401	128035	128035	him	4523	" seemed to throb in his brain . He gripped everything he had to grip tighter . But his own body seemed to grip his mind tighter still . He could feel the clutch of his veins -- a whole corded network of them -- could see them ! A corded , pulsing network edged with prismatic light , sending stars into the darkness , beating time to the singing in his ears , to the fierce duel between the desire to gasp and the determination to hold on,--beating time to the confused rush of thoughts which ended in one--"This
128405	130917	130924	130924	Khân	89	" It made his clutch tighter . Gu - gu , at least , should drown too . That was the last conscious thought . It merged into a frantic , insistent clamour for air ! air ! air ! till something cold hit him full on the face and forced him into a quick , gasping cry , that left him senseless . When he came to himself , as he did a moment or two afterwards , he was still clutching the waist - belt of blue beads , and the touch of it lulled him to an instant 's sheer relief . The dive was over ; they must be in the cave ; the cold that had hit him in the face must have been the air . But what was he lying upon ? Surely rock ! And the hand he moved to feel it brought the blue beads with it unresistingly . Gu - gu ! where was Gu - gu ? Gone ! And the knife too . It had been used to sever the hempen string of the belt . Curious . It might have been used for a different and more deadly purpose ; but you could never count on what fellows would do -- even when they were treacherous . Lance thought this dreamily , before he realized more than the fact that he was alive ; not drowned . Then he sat up hastily and faced the truth that he was alone once more ; alone in that network of underground passages and caves of which Gu - gu had spoken . Was there any chance of his getting out of it ? Not by the dive , certainly . Without help that was impossible . He set himself to remember what his guide had said in reply to the questions with which he had been purposely plied . First , as to light . If Gu - gu was to be trusted the materials for this must be close at hand . Lance rose cautiously and felt about the ledge on which he lay and the walls of rock about him , and ere long came on what he sought . Flint and steel , a box of tinder , a bottle of oil , and a rag torch hung in an old bit of fishing - net to a peg that was driven into a crevice . So far , good ; and after a minute these enabled him to see that he was in a sort of vaulted well , half hewn out of rock , half built in with brick . It was filled to some three feet or so with water , except in one corner , where the flooring shelved down to an archway . There it was deeper . This must be the opening of the tunnel through which they had dived , and through which , doubtless , Gu - gu had escaped ; for he was not likely to have braved the intricate passages without a light . This thought made Lance look to see how much oil the bottle contained . There was only a mere driblet at the bottom . Plainly , therefore , he could pause no longer ; so , instantly , without further thought , he waded across the pool and ran along the only passage which led from it . He had to stoop as he ran , and from the feel to his feet he guessed that the passage led upwards first , then downwards ; apparently , too , in a perfectly straight line . The river , therefore , must be behind him , and he tried to make this point a fixed one , so as to give him some notion of his bearings . After a hundred yards or so he emerged into a second cave or chamber , also nearly waist - deep in water . From this several passages opened , some too small to admit of a man passing through them . These , then , must be the canals of which Gu - gu had spoken ; one of them , possibly , that which should have supplied the Pool with Immortality . The memory of that crowd of eager , patient faces , disappointed by such a miserable trick , made Lance feel pitiful ; then his pity brought a sudden practical suggestion . Why not open the sluice , or whatever it was , now , and give the miracle ? It would at least keep some of the crew quiet when it came , at dawn ; the dawn which might be so fatal to quiet -- the dawn which must , surely , be close at hand . He raised the torch and saw , close beside him , a foot or two above the present level of the water , a clumsy closed stone conduit with an iron handle . It was a rude primitive tap , no doubt , by which the levels could be raised . Without further thought , he turned it , and smiled to find himself right , as water poured out , filling the vaulted chamber with sound . Then , without further pause , he passed on down the biggest of the passages leading from the chamber ; since that seemed the most likely one . After a while , however , the passage narrowed , seemed in danger of ending altogether ; so he harked back . There was no longer any sound in the chamber when he returned to it , and the level of the water had risen almost to the floor of the passage in which he stood , wondering which of the other outlets he had best try . The choice was a case of sheer chance , of course , he told himself ; a mere backing of one 's luck . But , as he paused to make it , something cold struck on his feet , causing him to look down in sudden surprise . The water was still rising . That must be stopped , anyhow , unless he was to be drowned out like a sewer rat . He stuck the torch into a cleft in the rock beside him , hung the net to it , and swam over to the conduit , which was already submerged . But the handle which had turned so easily was stiff now ; possibly because of the pressure of the water , possibly because there was some other rude mechanism of which he was unaware . Anyhow , after a few trials he realized that he was helpless until the water had found its own level . But what was that ? Who could tell ? Would it rise , and rise , and rise , till it filled the whole place ? Who could tell ? It was not fear which clutched at his heart -- only a vague self - pity ; almost an amused wonder that this Immortality for others might bring Death to him . He looked up into the vaulted arch above him , then to the , as yet , dry passages which he could just see , as darker arches of shadow . Unless one of them rose abruptly to a higher level -- and the chance that one did , or that he should find it , was remote -- he would be wiser to stay here , and see what happened . The roof was at least higher . He swam back to the torch and , holding on to the crevices of the wall , waited . Still rising . He shifted the torch to a higher crevice and waited again , a dull curiosity taking possession of him . Still rising . He wondered , suddenly , whether it would not have been better for him to have gone back the way he had come . The passage had certainly seemed to ascend , and it was a question of levels . That was all . A mere question of levels . He shifted the torch again . It was dying down now , the rags showing charred , cindery . But as he fed it with oil and it flared up and smoked , the thought came to him that it was using air needlessly , making suffocation more imminent . He blew it out deliberately . If a man had to die , he might as well die in the dark . He was glad , a moment later , of the darkness . It shut out reality and left him to dreams ; to vague hopes , to kindly forgetfulness , to Erda 's face . How plucky she had been ! Well ! even if he had to be drowned like a rat in a sewer , he must not be behind her . The pathetic comfort of kindly memory , which with strange unreason -- since it enhances the value of the life that is being left -- makes the face of death seem less stern to poor humanity , came to him and absorbed him . If he died and she lived , she would not forget him ; he knew that . And still the water rose . It must be rising now , he thought , in the Pool of Immortality , and the eager , patient faces that had been waiting for it so long must be showing glad in the grey light of the dawn . For the dawn was coming to the world , though he would not see it . Strange , incomprehensible thought , even though the reality of it was so certain , so close . Incomprehensible ? Say rather , impossible ; frankly impossible ! He could not be going to die ! He shifted the unlit torch to a still higher crevice -- almost a ledge in the rock -- and waited incredulously for the water to rise . And as he waited in the dark , someone else in the grey dawn , to whom death was more familiar , to whom , in a way , it was the one great certainty of Life , was feeling the same frank incredulity at the thought of the immediate future . For Dr. Dillon , when he found himself alone on the roof of the gaol gate with an unconscious woman and a child , knew that the end could not be far off . With Vincent dead , and Eugene cut off by the stern necessity for keeping that door shut , he could not hope for more than a brief , savage resistance -- and then ? Failure , inevitable failure , unless help came ; and that seemed far as ever . As yet , dazed by that closing of the door , that desperate , triumphant death of the man with his back to it -- a death which had gained them nothing -- the prisoners were still huddled together , crushed out of further action , at the far end of the alley . So the courtyard was clear , free from assailants . But that could only be for a minute or two . There was an ominous rending and hewing at the gate below ; ere long those outside would be inside , and with a leader who would know what to do . So life could only be an affair of moments ; yet it seemed incredible , more than incredible , that all his strong will and determination would not avail even to save those helpless creatures in his charge . He stooped hurriedly and lifted the still unconscious woman in his arms , carried her into the turret , closed the door on her and the child -- frightened now for the first time at her mother 's silence -- and returned to wait and watch . It was all he could do for them , unless fate gave him a chance of appealing for them to Roshan Khân . But even then there could be no bargaining , no compromise , no surrender ! A sharp crash , a sudden rise in the babel of voices below , warned him that the gate had given , partially at least . The next instant a soldier or two , ignorant of that dead man with his back against the closed gate , ran lightly down the alley calling on the prisoners to make way . One of them was Roshan Khân ; but George Dillon did not waste a cartridge even on him . He was reserving his fire for that storming of the broken stairs which must come when the assailants found themselves still foiled . In truth Roshan Khân had this same storming in his mind as all he cared for , since it would pit him against his rival , against Vincent Dering , who he knew was on the roof . And so , with that odd acquired sense of honour , fair play , God knows what , he had been planning , as his men battered down the gate , how best to compass those fair odds which were necessary alike to his sense of justice and injustice -- for the injustice of his own position cried aloud for proof that he was worth a better one . So he had settled to complete that liberating of the prisoners which , with the help of the keys , ought already to be in hand . This done , the general rabble would be eager for freedom , eager for plunder , eager to get to the town and raise it , eager for all things for which he cared no jot . Then would be his time . Then -- he did not even try to formulate how -- he could find himself face to face , at fair odds , with Vincent Dering . Wild memories of duels he had read about in western books , duels with others , who had nothing to do with the quarrel , looking on , occurred to him . Yes ! that would satisfy him . To have it out , till death ! He set his teeth as he forced a peremptory way through the crowd at the end of the alley , which hid the closed door until one actually stood beside it . Then he stood transfixed , for he saw Vincent Dering 's dead body still backed by that closed door , still guarding it , unarmed . There was a curious look of content in the dead face , and Roshan , grasping its meaning by intuition , turned from it with a curse , knowing himself forestalled , cheated . "
130928	130935	130924	130924	Khân	89	" protested a voice , quickly ; "
130953	131215	131221	131221	sergeant	844	" Roshan struck at the voice fiercely . Not forestalled , not cheated , only ; but outdone , conquered ! His rival had died a hero 's death , and he -- he might live to be hanged ! A rage of despair , of despite , seized on him . His one real object gone , the whole hideous folly of the rest made him fling up his hands passionately as he dashed back to the gate , neither knowing nor caring what he was going to do next . Storm that feeble garrison on the roof ? those broken stairs , every crevice , every foothold in which stood out clear , easy , in the light of the search - ray ? Was that a man 's task ? Confused , dazed , he ran on , followed instinctively by the crowd , wondering what he would be at . George Dillon , seeing the rush , covered the first foothold of the broken stairs with his rifle , and waited for a man to show on it . But none came . Just as the rush reached the courtyard , Eugene Smith 's search - ray , having exhausted itself , went out , leaving , not darkness , but the grey mystery of dawn , in which for an instant all sound , all movement , seemed arrested . There was one utterly peaceful second , and then , from behind the splintered gateway , from the shadows of the tunnel , came a breathless voice:-- "
131238	131331	131227	131227	you	844	" A trap ! The word reached those who had followed Roshan in his causeless retreat . Had he foreseen this ? Was he escaping from the trap ? Their eyes flew to the tunnel , but the light which , till then , had lit up its darkness , the swinging lamp by which the batterers of the gate had worked , was dashed down by someone 's hand -- a small , white hand -- and there was nothing to be seen . Only that voice to be heard repeating , "
131342	131363	131227	131227	you	844	" Keep them ! Not if they could fight their way into the open ! The cry rose in a second:-- "
131388	131538	131620	131620	They	3154	" Roshan , who would have paused at this chance of fair resistance , was caught in the rush from behind , and found himself through the gap in the gate fighting desperately in the crowd , calling on his men to rally . But they had construed his half - frenzied flight from that look on Vincent Dering 's face into a lead , and they were mixed up inextricably with the horde of undisciplined conspirators who , having been till now safe under cover of the tunnelled archway , yelled for the open , not so much in which to fight , but in which to run away . The mere handful of men , whose number was fortunately hidden by the darkness , could never have prevented the rush , but a quick wit amongst them seized on a possibility , and the breathless voice called , "
131547	131609	131620	131620	They	3154	" So , in a second or two , amid confused yells , and mad slashings at friends and foes alike , the positions were reversed . The inside was out , the outside in , like Brian O'Lynn 's breeches ; and Dr. Dillon 's first hint at what the amazing turn of affairs below him meant came with the words:-- "
131627	131628	131620	131620	They	3154	" "
131635	131708	131631	131631	you	3159	" he called doubtfully , leaning over the parapet and peering into that grey mystery of dawn . The figure he saw , a woman in a white dress and a scarlet mess jacket , made him doubt the evidence of his own eyes . But the answer in a woman 's voice , with a quick breath in it , sent his back in something between a laugh and a sob . "
131724	131932	131631	131631	you	3159	" There was no doubt that this was a woman ! Once outside , where they could discern friend from foe , the troopers instantly realized their mistake , and rallied round Roshan . But it was too late for that now . As he stood , centring them , there was a wild contempt , a vague relief , in his face . He knew now where his sympathies lay . Not with these men , treacherous to their salt , but with those who could hold -- who had held -- their own against all odds . Yes ! even with that dead figure , still with its back to the door that must not be opened . The thought stung and seared like hot iron . No ! Not with that ! not with that ! That was -- What?-- He could have killed himself for the unwavering testimony which every scrap of him gave to the heroism , the defiance of such a death . He knew he would give everything to die one like it ; and he knew he could not -- not now . He knew he must die a useless death , to save himself from a worse one . "
131944	131962	131940	131940	Khân	89	" broke in his lance - duffadar in hurried excuse , seeing the expression on his face . "
132017	132021	132014	132017	a Miss - baba"--he	6028	baba"--he laughed savagely . "
132046	132167	132172	132172	thou	3171	" Roshan Khân looked at the man , whom he had known for years , as if he had never seen him before . And the thought of another woman -- with his own blood in her veins -- who had been brave also , and who had died -- died by his hand -- returned to sweep him from every bearing , from every landmark , eastern or western , and leave him rudderless , drifting , in a storm of sheer despair . He laughed suddenly -- an insane laugh -- at the hideousness , the hopelessness of it all . Laughed like the madman he was for the time , at the horror which drove him mad . "
132185	132322	132177	132177	I	0	" he cried brutally , striking out at the voice as he had struck at the other which had told him of Vincent 's victory . Striking as he felt inclined to strike at anything and everything ; most of all at the hateful confusion in himself , and in his world . So , without another word , he broke through the circle of troopers , dashed to where his horse awaited him , and was off like a whirlwind ; that strange possession of the Oriental races , which , in a way , claims kindred with the Berserk rage of the north , thrilling to his finger - tips ; yet held in check , diverted from sheer , mad , uncalculating desire to kill , by that acquired sense of fair play . "
132330	132341	132323	132323	He	0	" said some of his men , following him hurriedly . "
132347	132354	132323	132323	He	0	" assented some of the conspirators . "
132373	132584	132323	132323	He	0	" But most of the crowd , troopers and conspirators alike , felt vaguely that the dawn had indeed come , that the midsummer night 's dream of madness was over ; that those who were wise would try , while they had the chance , to escape from its consequences . And that such a chance existed , even now , was patent . The very madness of the night , its lack of reasonable explanation , were in their favour . And its darkness , the outer darkness of the storm , which had sprung up in a minute , must have hidden much . Who , for instance , was to say -- except those impenitent ones whose evidence , if given at all , must be doubted as the evidence of condemned men seeking to drag others down to their fate -- whether such and such a one had been a rebel at first ? Provided , always , that there was no doubt about his staunchness at the last ; that is , now that the dawn had come -- the dawn which showed doubt , almost a surprise , in so many faces . What had come to them ? Why were they there ? "
132590	132621	132323	132323	He	0	" ( some shadow fell on me ) muttered one man below his breath , as he sheathed his sword . And another , with an oath , said boldly , "
132630	132636	132323	132323	He	0	" then gave the cry , "
132650	132713	132649	132650	the mutineers"--so	6049	mutineers"--so , promptly , began operations on the nearest defenceless prisoner . Thus , almost before those who had galloped in hot haste after Roshan 's lead were out of sight , the prisoners , even the resisting warders , had been driven into the portico , and penned like a flock of sheep between the troopers outside and the pioneers within . "
132719	132746	132717	132717	King	3696	" said the lance - duffadar , piously , to a neighbour,--he had started back from Roshan 's blow with a scowl , and watched his retreat resentfully,--"the
132762	132764	132756	132756	Lo	123	brothers!"--he added aloud--"have
132821	132822	132823	132823	Gord	292	" "
132833	132898	132823	132823	Gord	292	" The cry grew to a shout , and Dr. Dillon , who , with a great incredulity lessening the values of all he saw and heard , had promptly swung himself down into the courtyard , looked through a crevice in the barricade -- which was fast taking form under the willing hands of the pioneers -- to see what the noise meant . "
132904	132916	132823	132823	Gord	292	" he said slowly , his face pathetic in its bewilderment ; "
132924	133006	132917	132918	the troopers	2375	" He stood for a moment as if unable to grasp the reality , and his keen , inquisitive eyes seemed to search almost reproachfully for some cause , some hint of reason , in his surroundings . In the splintered door , in every cranny and foothold of the broken stair , and so , past the parapet , they continued their question to the lightening sky , against which , faint and far , those distant peaks where lay the "
133011	133018	132917	132918	the troopers	2375	" had begun to show dimly . "
133023	133032	133033	133034	Poor Dering	293	" he muttered to himself , almost petulantly . "
133036	133088	133089	133089	Smith	74	" So , swiftly he passed down the alley,--swiftly , but hopelessly ; for he knew what those iron shackles meant on a man 's bare head . He drew the body to one side with tender care , then knocked at the closed door and called to the man within . "
133114	133181	133182	133182	Dering	293	" There was a pause , then a fumbling at the bolts and bars . So , in that grey , cold light , a figure stood at the open door , tall , gaunt , with a hunted look in its eyes , almost a terror , as they looked down -- down to the threshold -- down for what they knew should be there . "
133184	133231	133182	133182	Dering	293	" asked Eugene Smith , rather hoarsely ; then , seeing what lay to one side , covered his eyes from the sight with a cry like a woman 's , and trembled all over . That strain of patient , idle inaction had been awful . "
133238	133246	133236	133236	them	3190	" burst out the doctor , fiercely . "
133270	133480	133264	133264	Smith	74	" For nothing ! For nothing ! The words were echoing in Roshan 's brain also , as with loose rein , recklessly , he galloped over the frail bridge of boats , making it quiver and thunder beneath his horse 's hoofs , and send curved waves of light and shadow over the clear , steely surface of the water , seen like a polished shield in the dawn . The air was clear also ; the distant hills steel grey as the water , the sky steel grey as the hills . And there was the bright keenness as of a glittering sword in the chill breeze that swept from west to east . But Roshan did not feel it ; he was absorbed in himself , in the useless battle of his life . For nothing ! For nothing ! He did not even hear the soft yet sonorous roar , beginning like the rush of a big breaker on a beach , ending with a wild , musical note , like the wail of new - weaned lambs and their mothers on a lone hillside , which suddenly echoed out over the water , making those who galloped behind look at each other and whisper joyfully:-- "
133490	133499	133486	133488	Khân - sahib	89	" said one , urging his horse alongside ; "
133516	133574	133512	133512	They	3444	" Roshan looked at him with lack - lustre eyes . What were the pilgrims to him , or their impatience ? What was salvation , immortality , to one whose only desire was death -- death and forgetfulness ? He dug his spurs into his horse , savagely glad to give pain , and rode on . "
133583	133599	133632	133634	Gu - gu	117	" The roar was articulate now , and those behind looked doubtfully at each other . "
133607	133618	133632	133634	Gu - gu	117	" suggested one conspirator ; but another shook his head , "
133645	133646	133632	133634	Gu - gu	117	" "
133653	133662	133663	133663	God	96	" put in a third , almost timidly . "
133679	133689	133663	133663	God	96	" So an uneasy silence fell upon the rest . "
133698	133793	133663	133663	God	96	" There was no mistaking the cry now . It rose exultant , yet with that wailing note in it still , which lingers always in humanity 's claim to have found its lost Paradise , its lost purity . Yet there was no trace of doubt in the almost frantic joy on every face in the dense multitude which stopped the little cavalcade , as it entered the square around the Pool of Immortality ; stopped it hopelessly , as if the moving , breathing , living mass had been a dead wall . "
133802	133998	134106	134106	She	3197	" It was almost a yell . The patience was gone utterly , and far as the eye could reach , in all the wide square , in every street and alley converging to it , there was the restless ineffectual movement of the sea , when , on a summer 's day , it beats itself calmly yet persistently -- rising and falling -- upon a sheer cliff , against the impossible . There was no one to check the crowd now , to prevent it from finding Death and Immortality at the same time . What matter ? What were a few hundreds of crushed bodies , when the soul found what it sought ? The riders behind Roshan threw up their hands at the sight . No hope here for the littlenesses of life ; for principalities and powers , even for political liberty . This was the bed - rock ; this , in its unalterable aspiration -- not for something better , but for the best -- neither culture nor conspiracy could touch ; this was as much beyond the control of kith and kin as of strangers and aliens . "
134005	134050	134001	134003	Khân - sahib	89	" they called to the figure with the lack - lustre eyes which sat its horse like a statue , staring at itself , at its world , conscious only of the hideous discords which were , perforce , the music of its sphere . "
134090	134102	134053	134053	Nawab	122	Kâli"--the speaker spat his Mahomedan contempt for the idolatry ere he went on--"lets
134114	134230	134231	134231	He	3199	" So , by back alleys and crooked ways , Roshan -- why he did not know , since he meant nothing by it -- led the cavalcade past the palace , through the archway into the courtyard with its union - jack of raised paths . And found it empty . Empty of all save the jogi , Gorakh - nâth , who was busy , resignedly , in rethreading his chaplet of skulls , ere starting to seek safety over the British border in some far recess of the holy hills , whence , when this affair had blown over , he could swoop down with added sanctity on some other religious fair . "
134247	134259	134231	134231	He	3199	" he said cheerfully , after he had explained the position . "
134329	134338	134326	134327	Kali Ma	285	" Those behind Roshan looked at each other . "
134344	134349	134326	134327	Kali Ma	285	" they said briefly . "
134355	134361	134326	134327	Kali Ma	285	" the change of title was significant--"we
134375	134421	134326	134327	Kali Ma	285	" Once more , every atom of the man , soul and body , seemed to strike out furiously at the voice , at the truth and the untruth in it ; at the assertion of failure , the linking of his need with theirs . "
134431	134436	134437	134437	I	0	" he cried fiercely ; "
134441	134587	134437	134437	I	0	" They left him , after unavailing protests , and rode helter - skelter on to the Fort , warning their comrades that the game was up , so , on towards safety . And the jogi , naked but not ashamed , still swinging his chaplet of skulls , followed them leisurely ; for he knew himself safe in the superstition and the devotion of every woman in India . Since he , Her servant , could not fail of shelter in every Hindoo homestead , far or near , in which a woman 's hand closed on a man 's , holding him tight for herself alone , as the Great Mother holds all men . Roshan , thus left alone , rode his horse on slowly to the central plinth , dismounted , and , hitching the bridle over the muzzle of the "
134591	135556	135559	135560	the Gods	3472	" stood staring out dully at what lay before him ; so quiet , so commonplace ! Nothing changed from the day , barely a month ago , when he had stood beside the old gun with Vincent Dering and Lance Carlyon , contemptuous of the ignorance of others , satisfied with himself . And now?--what had come to him ? The madness , which his wild gallop from the gaol had calmed somewhat , returned in a fierce rush , and with it that one desire for revenge ; for something by which to show the contempt , which was not now merely for the ignorant ; but for those others , self - righteous , tyrannical , who had dared to touch him -- dared to make him what he was -- a prey both to ignorance and wisdom , savagery and culture -- a laughing - stock even to himself ! And who had begun the fooling ? Who had taught him as a boy ? Pidar Narâyan ! Who else ? Who else had begun the game giving some things , withholding others ? And who else was within reach ? Who else could be followed up and forced to fair fight ? Forced to admit that the pupil was ahead now of the master . He laughed a laugh of absolute exultation ; and a wave of purely childish satisfaction swept through the mind in which there were still so many depths of childish ignorance and misconception ; unavoidable depths in the culture of a bare score of years . Leaving his horse tethered to the old gun , he ran hastily across to the palace , so , finding the door open , the whole place quiet , went on down the arched passage . It was still dark there , but a glimmer of light showed the entrance to the chapel , and to the armoury beside it , which was his goal . He had no other thought except for that armoury , until , with the tall tapers burning at the head and feet , he saw the dead body of the woman who had deceived him lying on the Altar steps . Then the pitifullest clashing of satisfaction and despair , of desire and disgust , came to him that ever rent a man in twain . For a moment he fought for bare reason between them , then with a savage cry , he flung himself beside the dead girl , caught her to him , covered her with frantic , cruel kisses , and , almost flinging her from him again , ran on into the armoury , the red of her dress , her bosom , in his eyes -- the red of blood ! The armoury ! Where he had had his first lesson in the foils ! There they were , harmless in their buttons , crossed on the wall , and above them something more murderous ; the dangerous delicate rapiers to which those others were but the prelude . No ! one was gone ! One Father Ninian had used against the jogi ! One he must have with him . So much the better ! He tore down its fellow , and passing the dead girl without a look , dashed out into the courtyard again , his last trace of sanity gone . The next instant his horse 's feet were echoing madly along the pilgrims ' road . His enemy must have a quarter of an hour 's lead , but that was nothing ; he could overtake him , anyhow , at the first station in the pilgrimage,--a temple under a vast banyan tree at the foot of the first rise , where the pious must pause to make offerings . The road was almost empty at first ; for the news that the miracle had only been deferred had spread instantly through the unrestful town , so to a space beyond it , making those who heard the tale turn back to see for themselves . But after a few minutes ' wild gallop , he came up with those who had been beyond recall , who had gone on content with that strange lead of a strange God ; of a saint , a sinner . Yet , after a time , forgetful of that leadership utterly . For they needed it no more . The danger of novelty had passed with their first step along the beaten track which their fathers had followed . Father Ninian , wise with the wisdom of long years , of secret sympathy , had known this ; had counted on it in his forlorn hope of leading them into familiar bondage . He had told himself that he need only go as far as that first station ; that then , during the pause for offerings , he might return , as it were , to realities , to something more consistent with the nineteenth century ! But to him , also , as he led the way , chanting his offices for the day , had come a strange peace , a strange desire to go on to the end of the pilgrimage ; a strange desire to leave those realities behind him in a world from which he was taking nothing , not even his love . Surely it was time . Surely he was old enough to claim rest . No ! not rest . It was something more than that . Surely , now that he had left every atom of earth behind him lying with a dead woman on the Altar steps , he also was free to find the "
135561	135563	135564	135564	My	0	" ! "
135583	135606	135575	135575	I	0	" he chanted ; he had gone on blindly from psalm to psalm intent on the desire to lead those voices behind . "
135620	135755	135617	135618	thy God	804	" said a half - tender , half - jesting one as he stumbled among the stones , and a dark hand stretched itself out to steady the old priest , and a dark face turned to nod approval at other saffron robes ; since here was a true pilgrim , a true madman , forgetful of this world , to judge by the face lifted towards those distant hills . Yet the desire in him to reach them seemed to the wise old heart something that must be set aside . He must return . Yes ! he must return . To do what ? What could an old man do who had left life , a useless life , behind him ? He crushed down that thought also , and stumbled on . "
135772	135992	135575	135575	I	0	" His voice spent itself tremulously on that one certainty , and those behind him joined their testimony to his all unwittingly , as they called on Hârâ or Hârî ; on the Creator , the Destroyer , as One and Indivisible . And in the rear again , Roshan in his search for Death , for annihilation , bore witness also , as he came , cursing those who stood in his way , his horse slithering among the stones in its effort to obey whip and spur , and sending a dry clangour of hoof - beats through the little stony valley to startle the sleepy snakes coiled on the distant rocks , and drive them back to their crannies with a hiss . So , every instant , the distance lessened between the old man and the young one , both weary of life . It was broad daylight now , though the sun was still low on the horizon . The mystery of dawn had left the world , the very pilgrims , between their recurring cries , were chattering , laughing , over the every - day details of life which would make to - day as trivial as yesterday , to - morrow as trivial as to - day . There had been a "
135994	136355	135575	135575	I	0	" in the night , they told each other . Some shadow had fallen . Some God or Devil had had power . But the shackles of custom , of familiarity , were back again , the despotism of detail . Only in those two strangely different minds in the van , in the rear , the mystery still clouded the reality . And the distance between them lessened as Roshan drove his way through the saffron robes recklessly . Yet , fast as he went , when he reached the end of the dry watercourse up which the last part of the rough track had wound , and stood in the hollow , backed by a further rise of the hill , where the quaint , dumpy , black temple hid itself under the huge blotch of the banyan tree -- the only green thing visible , far or near -- the figure he sought was not to be seen among the crowd . Akbar Khân , indeed , he saw , utilizing one of the tall tapers as a pipe - light before casting himself on the ground to suck contentedly at the screwed banyan leaf full of tobacco which he had gathered by claiming a pinch in return for the loan of that same light to others . But with a curious shame Roshan avoided him , and passed on in his search among the jostling crowd , the continuous babel of trivial talk ; for this was resting - time , when men and women could be men and women , and forget that they were on a pilgrimage ; when they could even dream themselves back in the village under the familiar shelter of some village tree , asking no more than the familiar round of life . But above the babel came every now and again the insistent clang of a bell , telling that some new petitioner was seeking a favour of the Gods , and making a golden oriole , which sat in the green leafage , flit to another bower with a sudden fluting note , full , joyful , mellow . "
136362	136399	136360	136360	Musulmân	300	" cavilled a saint , drawing back from Roshan 's shadow , as he gabbled invocations , all he knew , on a rosary , ere solacing himself with the pipe which his disciple had prepared . "
136414	136725	136409	136409	he	6031	" He pointed to a side track , which was a short cut to the road above . Roshan flung himself from his horse without a word , and followed . The distance lessened at every step now , for the old priest 's breath failed him at the steepness of the rise . Still , it would not delay him long , he told himself , to take that one look at the soft , white cloud which generally hid the goal of pilgrimage , before he turned back over the hill , as best he could , to find what task remained for him in the world . He might have that one look , surely ! So , reaching the summit of this first bulwark of the unattainable , he sat down , breathlessly , beside an upright black stone which showed strangely distinct amid the redness of the surrounding rock ; a plain black stone , not three feet high , chipped rudely to a blunt point . Father Ninian did not need the scattering of dead marigolds and dry basil leaves about its base to tell him that it was a fragment of an older faith than that of the temple below ; a faith sterner , purer , founded on a clearer perception of what humanity needed in that search for the lost Paradise ; on a closer memory of the cause which lost it . He laid one hand on the stone almost caressingly , as , holding the pyx in the other , he sat down facing the distant peaks . But there was no cloud upon them . The day had dawned clear and still , and as he sat looking wistfully over the valleys on valleys , the hills on hills , which lay bathed in light between him and the "
136731	137002	137003	137003	Murderer	3216	" a sunbeam -- still slanting from the curved edge of the eastern plains -- caught the jewelled star of what he held , and stayed there . It was peaceful beyond words . The hurry , the strain , not only of that long eventful night , but of the whole long eventful life , seemed over . All things seemed behind him . The passion , the pride , the courage , the manhood -- all things that had made Ninian Bruce what Ninian Bruce had been -- where were they ? Only wisdom , only a tender knowledge , seemed to remain . The clank of steel upon stone roused him , the clank of Roshan 's spurs upon the rocks ; and Father Ninian turned to see him , a yard or two on the path below , outlined clearly against the distant view of Eshwara , against the world in which Ninian Bruce had lived and loved -- the Ninian Bruce whom he had left behind . Behind ! No ! It was Ninian Bruce and none other who was on his feet in a second , a flush on his face -- the face that was like the nether mill - stone in its stern passion , and pride , and power . For , in a second , the old man 's soul was back in a world where a dead woman belonging to him lay waiting for revenge . His hand was on his hidden rapier , as he flung his first word of defiance at the man who had killed her . "
137005	137006	137003	137003	Murderer	3216	" "
137014	137018	137019	137019	you	3217	" gasped Roshan , "
137029	137078	137079	137080	My pupil	805	" The words failed him -- he paused inarticulate -- but the keen eyes and ears opposite him took in his meaning with the swift comprehension which had been Pidar Narâyan 's always . A sort of contemptuous pity fought with the passion of Ninian Bruce 's face . "
137084	137088	137079	137080	My pupil	805	" he assented . "
137100	137106	137090	137090	you	3217	" Roshan glared at him . "
137123	137126	137128	137128	you	3217	come"--here he laughed wildly--"for
137145	137158	137139	137139	I	0	" In his fierce excitement he pressed closer , flourishing his rapier . "
137162	137170	137160	137160	me	0	" came a cold , courteous voice ; "
137204	137292	137293	137293	I	0	" Roshan drew back with a flush from the figure which had stood its ground , which looked at him with bitter disdain . He scarcely seemed to recognize it . No wonder ! For this was Ninian Bruce himself . Ninian Bruce as he might have spoken to an over - hasty antagonist in the days when he was the most reckless swordsman in Rome , when the world held him body and soul . The years , his very priesthood , had slipped from him . "
137300	137421	137293	137293	I	0	" muttered Roshan , standing aside . There was a savage satisfaction in his heart . This man was not old , the odds were equal ; there was enough fire and passion here to please any opponent . So , after a pause to lay aside the pyx -- it found a strange resting - place on the blunt summit of that upright black stone -- a slim , still elegant figure , divested of its priestly robings , took its stand , its back to the hills , its face to the world . Still upright , still active , with its black soutane caught up and tucked into the sash to give free play to its limbs . "
137426	137432	137424	137424	sir	3491	" came the courteous voice , "
137437	137455	137424	137424	sir	3491	" Something in the proud grace of bearing , the reckless contempt , made Roshan follow suit . "
137464	137468	137424	137424	sir	3491	" he said , "
137477	137478	137479	137479	We	3223	" "
137486	137503	137504	137504	We	3223	" came that icy voice , as the speaker , without moving , stood on guard . "
137518	137595	137515	137515	I	0	" For an instant Roshan hesitated , realizing what the life that he meant to take had been , what the man himself whom he meant to kill had been and was . The man whose figure stood out like a black shadow against the distant blue of the hills ; and as he realized the fine fibre of his enemy , a sense of powerlessness to touch , to harm him , kept Roshan motionless . "
137607	137660	137661	137661	I	0	" The question came with a shrug of the shoulders . The taunt told . Roshan pulled himself together , and stood on guard also . But the sense of powerlessness was intolerable ; he lowered his rapier for a word more -- a word to raise his own self - esteem . "
137665	137670	137661	137661	I	0	" he said haughtily , "
137697	137698	137680	137680	I	0	" "
137709	137730	137680	137680	I	0	" came the instant reply , in a voice that vibrated harshly , like a harpstring struck to its fullest , "
137752	137803	137744	137744	I	0	" Roshan gave a short , sharp cry , like a wild beast . The next instant the curious hiss of two meeting blades sliding along each other was the only sound . It is a strange sound , which , to the listeners , the onlookers , seems to say "
137805	137811	137744	137744	I	0	" to the whole world . "
137820	138016	137744	137744	I	0	" Then , short and sharp as that cry of Roshan 's , came another sound ; the beaten , baffled clash when steel meets steel instead of flesh . Roshan , with an inward curse , gripped his rapier closer . He had almost been disarmed,--disarmed in that first encounter . Strange that he should have forgotten his foe,--forgotten the deadly insistence of the master 's blade , slack as a snake in curves , firm as a vice in grip . Then that almost invisible turn of the wrist which had so nearly done for him . He had forgotten -- these , in years of meaner adversaries . He remembered them now , and would not forget again . And he had such things ; ay ! and more , in reserve for himself . So had his master ; in reserve for both of them , if needful . And the knowledge that it would be needful came to Ninian Bruce at the first touch of his adversary 's sword ; for there was that in it which told the old hand that the young one was a master 's also . "
138022	138209	138017	138017	My	0	" he said quietly , as , abandoning the attack , he parried Roshan 's furious onslaught with scarcely a motion of the hand , held level to his heart . That he could do . But the other must surely come in the end , since he was old , and Roshan young . If in the end , therefore , why not now ? The sooner the better . A minute after the sun was no longer in Pidar Narâyan 's eyes . As he had said , they were fighting lengthwise to the ridge ; and he drew back , choosing his ground , until under his feet he felt the dead marigolds , the withered basil leaves that lay about the upright stone,--that strange pedestal on which the star - shaped pyx stood as on an altar , glittering in the sun - rays . He seemed to see it , to feel it , standing there between the world below and those faint , far peaks . And the eyes which had seen so much felt they need see no more . "
138216	138226	138214	138214	Signor	301	" he cried jibingly , flinging himself savagely forward . "
138237	138568	138229	138230	the Lord	3426	" he added in a lower tone ; as , in an attack which held in it all the wildness , the fire , the passion of his youth , he drove Roshan back a step,--one step down the faint slope on which he had counted . A fierce lunge or two , a swift parry , and then,--then an inch beyond safety -- given purposely -- yielded room for the riposte he sought from that other rapier . It came with a quick cry of triumph , as Roshan felt that thin , cold steel slide silently on through a dull , faint resistance . A cry that ended in a gasp , as the hand which held the rapier dropped for a second , then flung itself upwards . For Pidar Narâyan had given the reprise ; and ' L'Addio del Marito ' had done its work . So , for an instant -- held upright by the lingering force of the old man 's hand -- the two stood within a sword 's length , their faces glaring at each other,--stern , implacable , the one in death , the other still in life . Then the strength , the life , ebbed ; the balance between it and death wavered , and Ninian Bruce , overborne by his enemy 's dead weight , sank to his knee , then backwards . But his hand still gripped the rapier . So Roshan Khân 's body , as it fell forward , slithered down the sharp blade , sending a little jet of crimson blood backwards , till it stopped with a dull thud upon the hilt . So he lay , face downwards , beside the old man , whose face looked skyward ; whose head rested among the withered marigolds and the sweet , dead leaves of the basil , which generations and generations of pilgrims had offered to an unknown wisdom on their way to the "
138574	138575	138229	138230	the Lord	3426	" "
138583	138593	138594	138594	you	3230	" came the Commissioner 's rich , round brogue , "
138605	138900	138594	138594	you	3230	" He waved the cigar he was smoking towards Eshwara . It looked sleepier , more sun - saturate than ever , as it lay reflected in the still lagoon between it and the tent in which he was sitting ; a double - poled , Commissioner 's tent , which two days before had swooped down like an avenging angel with broad white wings to take possession of the just and the unjust in the name of Victoria Kaiser - i - Hind . It was pitched on the site of the Viceroy 's camp , for the convenience of being close to the gaol where the late disturbers of the public peace had taken up their residence . In fact , the mast from which the royal standard had floated , still reared itself , bare , undraped , from its roundel of roses . But the flowers were withered , dead . Even the palms , their work of welcome over , were wilting fast ; but they still gave a doubtful shade to some groups of manacled men , who , guarded by yellow - legged constables , were placidly awaiting the Commissioner 's leisure and pleasure ; both being , at the time , occupied with lunch and Dr. Dillon . So , the wide white wings of the tent being set open and supported with bamboos to let in the breeze , the representative of law and order could be seen -- his feet on the table among his law books -- drinking an iced whiskey - and - soda . Dr. Dillon -- he looked careworn chiefly because in his care for others he had , as yet , been able to take no rest -- nodded . "
138960	138965	138944	138944	her	3233	" The Commissioner smiled . "
139028	139029	139026	139026	Carlyon	68	" "
139036	139041	139026	139026	Carlyon	68	" interrupted the doctor , "
139096	139099	139120	139120	I	0	up"--here his face clouded--"and
139123	139130	139117	139117	your	3232	" The keen whimsical face hardened . "
139141	139146	139131	139131	I	0	" he said cynically ; "
139194	139266	139267	139267	We	3237	" He broke off , took up a pen as if to write , threw it down impatiently , and stared out into the hot , yellow sunshine . Dr. Dillon sat twiddling his mushroom hat round and round in his nervous fingers , and staring out into it also . A sense of being face to face with an unpleasant truth was on them both . Suddenly he laughed harshly . "
139282	139286	139304	139304	you	3491	" he said , "
139325	139326	139311	139311	you	3491	" "
139336	139352	139353	139353	I	0	" The Commissioner drew a list towards him , and ran his eye over it . "
139459	139466	139455	139457	Gu - gu	117	" Dr. Dillon looked up cheerfully . "
139518	139526	139512	139513	Lance Carlyon	68	" The Commissioner 's expression was curious . "
139556	139574	139579	139581	Am - ma	3733	" he drew a paper out of a file , looked at it , then looked at the doctor--"besides
139583	139597	139579	139581	Am - ma	3733	" He paused , smiled an infinitely kind smile , then went on : "
139673	139691	139692	139692	I	0	" So saying , his brogue took possession of the sun - bright , sun - dry air-- "
139948	139984	140005	140008	the Miss - sahiba	4385	" So I returned to my home and ate my bread . And the day was quiet , as the Huzoor knows ; only the folk reviled , because I had no fish to sell . "
140013	140028	140005	140008	the Miss - sahiba	4385	" Dr. Dillon ceased twiddling his hat , and looked up in sudden interest . "
140033	140039	140005	140008	the Miss - sahiba	4385	" reiterated the reading voice . "
140085	140179	140181	140181	I	0	" ' He has not been killed , ' said the Miss - sahiba ' He would not have fought with his clothes off . Nor did he go to fight . He would not have left the pistol if he had . He has gone swimming , to get quicker and find help . So he is drowned . He is in the river still , and I can not think of it . Am - ma ! you know every inch of the river . Find him ! Find him ! ' "
140422	140472	140418	140420	Gu - gu	117	" He had a knife in his bead belt , at the sight whereof I gave glory to gods and devils alike , for I knew the handle of it . It was Carlone - sahib 's shikar knife , and I had been his shikari many a time . "
140513	140621	140501	140501	He	3280	" So we fought . His right hand and mine on the knife , and our left arms round each other 's throat , choking us ; and our legs wrestling . Till the water grew too deep . Then we swam with them . But he said nothing , nor did I. There was no need . We understood , as dogs do , that it was foe and foe . So it came to the deep stream ; his right hand and mine , with the knife between them , and our teeth fixed in each other 's shoulders,--till I bethought me of his ear . "
140721	140951	140713	140713	I	0	" And when I came up , leaving him there , I found how long the race had been , for my right hand struck the city wall . Then it came to me what the Miss - sahiba had said , of Carlone - sahib wishing to go quick ; and I bethought me of the secret passages , and the knife , and Gu - gu 's fear . And I said to myself someone must have restored the miracle . Not Gu - gu ; else why was he hiding ? What if it be Carlone - sahib ? But most of all I thought of my little son , and the devils longing for him , and for a woman longing for the sight of a man 's beauty , and I knew I must go and see if it lay there . So I dived , and found him , as the Awarder of Justice knows , sitting high up , with the water about his feet , waiting for death , and brought him back as I promised . And Gu - gu is dead , for his body was drifting by the tunnel with Carlone - sahib 's knife in the back as we came out . So the Miss is pleased , and the devils do not come near my son . "
140962	140972	140974	140975	the Commissioner	1009	" Well ! what do ye say , Dillon ? "
140989	141126	140979	140980	George Dillon	69	" Nothing . Except that I must really be off . I 've to see Smith first , and Carlyon -- that sprained ankle of his , which he got trying to climb up beyond the rise of the water , will be the deuce and all if he uses it too soon . And then , if I can , I want to get round and say good - by to -- to the Miss - sahiba . She 's off to Herrnhut again this evening . In fact , Campbell did n't half like her waiting for the funeral , he is in such a blessed hurry to get to his new field , as he calls it ; thinks of nothing else . They are to be married on Monday , I believe . "
141139	141142	141127	141128	The Commissioner	1009	" damn , "
141155	141163	141164	141164	he	69	" Quite so,--I entirely agree with you , "
141168	141194	141164	141164	he	69	" but , unfortunately , there is only one person who has a right to tell that story , sir -- and she wo n't ! "
141195	141199	141201	141202	the Commissioner	1009	" Why not ? "
141204	141215	141201	141202	the Commissioner	1009	militantly--"why the blazes should n't a woman tell the truth ? "
141216	141224	141227	141228	the doctor	334	" Because women do n't know it , "
141230	141320	141321	141321	He	1009	" or men either , for that matter . Because we men and women have got ourselves on such false lines , into such an absolutely false position towards each other , that the only course consistent with propriety and les convenances is to -- to hush the thing up ! So hush - a - bye baby , sir , to your heart 's content . So long as the mother can tell her blessed infant that she is a lady , what does the real fact matter ? "
141360	141369	141370	141370	he	1009	" It 's a quare world , certainly , "
141401	141410	141411	141411	he	1009	" Listen to this now , for quareness , "
141417	141620	141411	141411	he	1009	" ' The petition of Mussumat Mumtâza Mahal'--that 's Roshan Khân 's grandmother , you know--'sister , ' etc . , etc . , ' humbly sheweth that she has endured grievous wrong and hurt , by loss of her grandson in the late deplorable mutiny ( of which she was utterly incognizant , being helpless , veiled , old woman perpetually confined in house ) . Therefore prayeth that whereas one Mussumat Ashrâf - un - nissa , her neighbour , is in receipt of pension rupees twenty - five per mensem for similar bereavement of male protector and head of family lost in ' 57 mutiny , therefore her pension of rupees twenty per mensem , only , for exile of husband to Calcutta , be commuted to similar sum of twenty - five , seeing that your poor petitioner is in floods of tears and wholly heartbroken through this most nonregulation , premature death of promising young scion of her noble house , on whom , as on blessed Victoria , Queen , her hopes were fixed . Said petitioner being able to prove alibi , absolute incomplicity , and continuous remaining at home during late devilish disturbances . ' "
141621	141626	141628	141629	the doctor	334	" Poor old soul ! "
141631	141752	141628	141629	the doctor	334	" give it to her if you can , sir . And as for remaining at home , everybody except the actual conspirators did that . Even Dya - Ram , the disaffected -- though he has preached armed resistance to tyranny in his paper for years . He barricaded himself in with his printing - press . Fact ; jammed his fingers in so doing , and came to me in a blind funk for a professional certificate that the wound could not have been caused by any lethal weapon . As if anyone could ever have suspected him of taking part in raising a row , or even in settling one ! His sort are simply negligible quantities . "
141753	141763	141766	141767	the Commissioner	1009	" But Ramanund seems to have attempted a lead , "
141771	141812	141766	141767	the Commissioner	1009	" Exactly . Attempted , and failed . His sort are negligible quantities also , sir , I 'm sorry to say , and will remain so until they learn , amongst other knowledge , to believe in something besides themselves-- "
141824	141840	141628	141629	the doctor	334	" That is another thing I should like to have seen -- dear old Pidar Narâyan-- "
141870	141887	141889	141890	the brogue	1209	" You 'll look in at the palace , perhaps , and see all is right , "
141896	141932	141889	141890	the brogue	1209	" and give my love to old Smith . I 'm not sure but that I 'd rather have seen him behind the door than anything else , for it must have been the hardest job-- "
141933	141940	141943	141944	the doctor	334	" Considering the circumstances , yes ! "
142260	142272	142273	142273	he	69	" Ah ! fever again , I see,--that 's a bore , "
142336	142343	142344	142345	Muriel Smith	151	" When did it come on ? "
142378	142407	142408	142408	Her	151	" Half an hour ago . It is a pity . We hoped it was broken , did n't we ? But he will fret himself so , Doctor-- "
142449	142457	142459	142459	Eugene	74	" How can a fellow help fretting , "
142465	142480	142459	142459	Eugene	74	" when he waits like a coward behind a door , where his best friend-- "
142492	142542	142543	142543	Her	3338	" But I tell him , Doctor -- and it 's true , is n't it?--that it was hardest for him -- and that -- that Vincent would rather have had it so -- because he had to leave no one , and Eugene had Gladys -- and me . "
142558	142565	142567	142568	the doctor	334	" Go on with the mixture , "
142579	142603	142567	142568	the doctor	334	" This will wear itself out in a day or two ; and -- you ca n't do more than you 're doing . "
142604	142609	142610	142610	she	3338	" I suppose not , "
142726	142740	142741	142741	he	110	" The tomb is finished , Ge - reeb - pun - wâz , "
142748	142785	142741	142741	he	110	" Ala ! the sad day ! But this slave , knowing all customary things , hath remained insistent on the workmen ; therefore all is befitting the noble people , as the Huzoor will see . "
142998	143004	143005	143005	he	69	" Did you do that ? "
143008	143017	143005	143005	he	69	" Ge - reeb - pun - wâz ! "
143045	143064	143065	143065	he	69	" This slave made it ! The Huzoor will notice it is , fitting . Even the ' crass'-- "
143072	143107	143065	143065	he	69	marigolds--"is not forgotten . Has not this dust - like one spent his life in preparing amusements and spectacles for the noble people ? He knows that tombs require flowers , as women do . "
143193	143269	143270	143270	he	3483	" So , since the Sirkar will doubtless appoint a guardian of tombs , seeing there is none to inherit the palace , if the Protector of the Poor would intercede for this slave with the Commissioner?--if the Huzoor would say that the dust - like one has provided the pleasures of palaces all his life long for the noble people ; yea ! from the cradle to the grave . If he will say that-- "

143295	143305	143191	143191	his	3483	" For tombs require flowers , as women do ! "
143346	143355	143356	143356	he	69	" You would do as well as anyone , "
143360	143367	143356	143356	he	69	" I 'll mention your name . "
143368	143377	143426	143426	he	69	" Ge -- reeb - pun -- wâz ! "
143514	143522	143524	143525	the doctor	334	" Have everything ready , of course , "
143623	143633	143635	143636	the doctor	334	" Does n't seem to have done much harm ! "
143686	143695	143698	143699	the doctor	334	" It must be beastly dull , too , "
143705	143740	143698	143699	the doctor	334	" You -- you might get them to help you over to the palace garden this afternoon ; about four , you know , when it gets cool . That would be a change . "
143745	143767	143741	143741	Lance	68	" Rath - er ! Why ! you told me yesterday I was n't to move a muscle for ten days ! "
143801	143807	143808	143808	he	69	" No more you are ! "
143812	143938	143808	143808	he	69	" Not what you call moving . But gentle exercise and -- and congenial society -- and all that ! You know the treatment ! Besides the Hutton - Wharton - Hood school do n't believe in rest . And -- and -- look here!--I'll put you on the stiffest starch bandage ever made -- and -- Oh ! confound it , man , one must risk something sometimes , you know ! Here , orderly ; go over to the sahib 's washerman and tell him to make me double - extra - white - shirt - front - starch , and if that does n't counteract the -- the indiscretion -- why -- why -- I wash my hands of the whole business !

143962	143973	143975	143975	Lance	68	" If you really think it might injure me permanently , "
143995	144021	143983	143984	Dr. Dillon	69	" If you mean your foot , I do n't think it will , and that 's all I 'm responsible for -- thank God ! "
144067	144078	144079	144079	he	69	" ' If I be not damned for this ! ' "
144149	144154	144155	144155	he	68	" This is luck ! "
144173	144236	144155	144155	he	68	" I thought I was never to see you again , and it seemed a bit rough -- on -- on us both ; considering what a lot we did together , you know . I 've been writing you a letter , to say how disappointed I was at not being able to get over and see you all this morning . "
144237	144245	144246	144246	she	105	" That was very kind of you , "
144275	144286	144287	144287	he	68	" I 've been wanting to know such a lot , "
144291	144315	144316	144316	he	68	" Of course I heard about the others , but not about you -- you need n't go away immediately , need you ? "

144351	144358	144359	144359	she	105	" Yes ! I can stop , "
144363	144372	144359	144359	she	105	" what is it you want to know ? "
144373	144385	144343	144343	his	68	" Lots of things ; but about yourself first of all ! "
