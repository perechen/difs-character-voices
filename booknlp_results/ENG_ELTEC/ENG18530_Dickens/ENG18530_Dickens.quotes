21997	22044	21995	21995	I	0	“ because that would be so very unreasonable . I did not know what you tell me , because the servant did not come near me at dinner ; but I do n't doubt what you tell me , and I am sorry to hear it . ”
22045	22055	22057	22057	she	1473	“ You need n't make a merit of that , ”
22059	22065	22057	22057	she	1473	“ No , my dear , ”
22068	22075	22076	22076	She	1473	“ That would be very foolish . ”
22140	22147	22148	22148	she	1473	“ I wish I was dead ! ”
22152	22170	22148	22148	she	1473	“ I wish we were all dead . It would be a great deal better for us . ”
22224	22231	22232	22232	she	1473	“ You used to teach girls , ”
22235	22264	22232	22232	she	1473	“ If you could only have taught me , I could have learnt from you ! I am so very miserable , and I like you so much ! ”
22613	22624	22625	22625	she	332	“ Ma wo n't be down for ever so long , ”
22628	22728	22625	22625	she	332	“ and then it 's a chance if breakfast 's ready for an hour afterwards , they dawdle so . As to Pa , he gets what he can , and goes to the office . He never has what you would call a regular breakfast . Priscilla leaves him out the loaf and some milk , when there is any , over night . Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it . But I 'm afraid you must be tired , Miss Summerson ; and perhaps you would rather go to bed . ”
22729	22740	22742	22742	I	0	“ I am not at all tired , my dear , ”
22744	22753	22742	22742	I	0	“ and would much prefer to go out . ”
22754	22762	22764	22765	Miss Jellyby	332	“ If you 're sure you would , ”
22767	22775	22764	22765	Miss Jellyby	332	“ I 'll get my things on . ”
23183	23191	23192	23192	she	332	“ Where would you wish to go ? ”
23195	23201	23202	23202	I	0	“ Anywhere , my dear , ”
23205	23210	23212	23213	Miss Jellyby	332	“ Anywhere 's nowhere , ”
23218	23227	23230	23230	She	332	“ Let us go somewhere at any rate , ”
23238	23244	23245	23245	she	332	“ I do n't care ! ”
23248	23314	23245	23245	she	332	“ Now , you are my witness , Miss Summerson , I say I do n't care — but if he was to come to our house , with his great shining lumpy forehead , night after night till he was as old as Methuselah , I would n't have anything to say to him . Such ASSES as he and Ma make of themselves ! ”
23315	23319	23320	23320	I	0	“ My dear ! ”
23339	23346	23320	23320	I	0	“ Your duty as a child — ”
23347	23435	23436	23436	She	332	“ O ! do n't talk of duty as a child , Miss Summerson ; where 's Ma 's duty as a parent ? All made over to the public and Africa , I suppose ! Then let the public and Africa show duty as a child ; it 's much more their affair than mine . You are shocked , I dare say ! Very well , so am I shocked too ; so we are both shocked , and there 's an end of it ! ”
23443	23540	23546	23546	her	332	“ But for all that , I say again , he may come , and come , and come , and I wo n't have anything to say to him . I ca n't bear him . If there 's any stuff in the world that I hate and detest , it 's the stuff he and Ma talk . I wonder the very paving stones opposite our house can have the patience to stay there , and be a witness of such inconsistencies and contradictions as all that sounding nonsense , and Ma 's management ! ”
23681	23686	23692	23692	Richard	320	“ So , cousin , ”
23699	23736	23692	23692	Richard	320	“ We are never to get out of Chancery ! We have come by another way to our place of meeting yesterday , and — by the Great Seal , here 's the old lady again ! ”
23764	23779	23740	23740	she	332	“ The wards in Jarnduee ! Ve - ry happy , I am sure ! ”
23780	23788	23790	23790	I	0	“ You are out early , ma'am , ”
23798	23830	23832	23834	the old lady	9222	“ Ye - es ! I usually walk here early . Before the Court sits . It 's retired . I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day , ”
23838	23862	23832	23834	the old lady	9222	“ The business of the day requires a great deal of thought . Chancery justice is so ve - ry difficult to follow . ”
23863	23871	23873	23874	Miss Jellyby	332	“ Who 's this , Miss Summerson ? ”
23900	23938	23940	23942	the old lady	9222	“ A suitor , my child . At your service . I have the honor to attend court regularly . With my documents . Have I the pleasure of addressing another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce ? ”
23985	23988	23990	23992	the old lady	9222	“ Ha ! ”
23994	24076	23990	23992	the old lady	9222	“ She does not expect a judgment ? She will still grow old . But not so old . O dear , no ! This is the garden of Lincoln 's Inn . I call it my garden . It is quite a bower in the summer - time . Where the birds sing melodiously . I pass the greater part of the long vacation here . In contemplation . You find the long vacation exceedingly long , do n't you ? ”
24091	24121	24123	24125	the old lady	9222	“ When the leaves are falling from the trees , and there are no more flowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor 's court , ”
24127	24189	24123	24125	the old lady	9222	“ the vacation is fulfilled ; and the sixth seal , mentioned in the Revelations , again prevails . Pray come and see my lodging . It will be a good omen for me . Youth , and hope , and beauty , are very seldom there . It is a long long time since I had a visit from either . ”
24363	24373	24374	24374	She	9222	“ This is my lodging . Pray walk up ! ”
24600	24608	24630	24630	Kenge	308	“ Law Books , all at 9d . ”
25015	25019	25021	25027	the old man coming to the door	1541	“ Hi hi ! ”
25029	25036	25021	25027	the old man coming to the door	1541	“ Have you anything to sell ? ”
25197	25232	25185	25187	the old man	1258	“ Aye , aye ! Please her ! It wo n't take a minute ! Come in , come in ! Come in through the shop , if t'other door 's out of order ! ”
25251	25257	25259	25262	the little old lady	1502	“ My landlord , Krook , ”
25279	25321	25322	25322	She	1502	“ He is called among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor . His shop is called the Court of Chancery . He is a very eccentric person . He is very odd . Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ”
25353	25364	25366	25368	the old lady	9222	“ For he is a little — you know!—M — ! ”
25382	25388	25389	25389	he	1258	“ It 's true enough , ”
25399	25431	25389	25389	he	1258	“ that they call me the Lord Chancellor , and call my shop Chancery . And why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor , and my shop Chancery ? ”
25432	25442	25444	25444	Richard	320	“ I do n't know , I am sure ! ”
25449	25453	25455	25457	the old man	1258	“ You see , ”
25464	25501	25455	25457	the old man	1258	“ they — Hi ! Here 's lovely hair ! I have got three sacks of ladies ' hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this . What color , and what texture ! ”
25502	25511	25513	25513	Richard	320	“ That 'll do , my good friend ! ”
25531	25547	25548	25550	The old man	1258	“ You can admire as the rest of us do , without taking that liberty . ”
25626	25636	25637	25637	he	343	“ You see I have so many things here , ”
25645	25846	25637	25637	he	343	“ of so many kinds , and all , as the neighbours think ( but they know nothing ) , wasting away and going to rack and ruin , that that 's why they have given me and my place a christening . And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock . And I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs . And all 's fish that comes to my net . And I ca n't abear to part with anything I once lay hold of ( or so my neighbours think , but what do they know ? ) or to alter anything , or to have any sweeping , nor scouring , nor cleaning , nor repairing going on about me . That 's the way I 've got the ill name of Chancery . I do n't mind . I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day , when he sits in the Inn . He do n't notice me , but I notice him . There 's no great odds betwixt us . We both grub on in a muddle . Hi , Lady Jane ! ”
25865	25881	25883	25884	her master	1556	“ Hi ! Shew 'em how you scratch . Hi ! Tear , my lady ! ”
25916	25932	25934	25936	the old man	1258	“ She 'd do as much for any one I was to set her on , ”
25938	25988	25989	25989	He	1258	“ I deal in cat - skins among other general matters , and hers was offered to me . It 's a very fine skin , as you may see , but I did n't have it stripped off ! That warn't like Chancery practice though , says you ! ”
26041	26087	26029	26032	the little old lady	1502	“ That will do , Krook . You mean well , but are tiresome . My young friends are pressed for time . I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon . My young friends are the wards in Jarndyce . ”
26088	26091	26093	26095	the old man	1258	“ Jarndyce ! ”
26100	26111	26093	26095	the old man	1258	“ Jarndyce and Jarndyce . The great suit , Krook , ”
26116	26119	26121	26123	the old man	1258	“ Hi ! ”
26140	26145	26121	26123	the old man	1258	“ Think of it ! ”
26166	26190	26163	26163	Richard	320	“ Why you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about the causes before your noble and learned brother , the other Chancellor ! ”
26191	26194	26196	26198	the old man	1258	“ Yes , ”
26201	26210	26196	26198	the old man	1258	“ Sure ! Your name now will be — ”
26211	26215	26163	26163	Richard	320	“ Richard Carstone . ”
26216	26219	26220	26220	he	1258	“ Carstone , ”
26250	26277	26239	26239	he	1258	“ Yes . There was the name of Barbary , and the name of Clare , and the name of Dedlock , too , I think . ”
26278	26292	26294	26294	Richard	320	“ He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor ! ”
26304	26307	26309	26311	the old man	1258	“ Ay ! ”
26320	26358	26309	26311	the old man	1258	“ Yes ! Tom Jarndyce — you'll excuse me , being related ; but he was never known about court by any other name , and was as well known there , as — she is now ; ”
26365	26484	26309	26311	the old man	1258	“ Tom Jarndyce was often in here . He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause was on , or expected , talking to the little shopkeepers , and telling 'em to keep out of Chancery , whatever they did . ‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ it 's being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it 's being roasted at a slow fire ; it 's being stung to death by single bees ; it 's being drowned by drops ; it 's going mad by grains . ’ He was as near making away with himself , just where the young lady stands , as near could be . ”
26490	26498	26500	26502	the old man	1258	“ He come in at the door , ”
26513	26737	26500	26502	the old man	1258	“ on the day he did it — the whole neighbourhood had said for months before , that he would do it , of a certainty , sooner or later — he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me ( you 'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then ) to fetch him a pint of wine . ‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ Krook , I am much depressed ; my cause is on again , and I think I 'm nearer Judgment than I ever was . ’ I had n't a mind to leave him alone ; and I persuaded him to go to the tavern over the way there , t'other side my lane ( I mean Chancery - lane ) ; and I followed and looked in at the window , and saw him , comfortable as I thought , in the arm - chair by the fire , and company with him . I had n't hardly got back here , when I heard a shot go echoing and rattling right away into the inn . I ran out — neighbours ran out — twenty of us cried at once , ‘ Tom Jarndyce ! ’ ”
26765	26867	26738	26740	The old man	1258	“ We were right , I need n't tell the present hearers . Hi ! To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on ! How my noble and learned brother , and all the rest of 'em , grubbed and muddled away as usual , and tried to look as if they had n't heard a word of the last fact in the case ; or as if they had — O dear me ! nothing at all to do with it , if they had heard of it by any chance ! ”
27005	27015	26968	26968	she	319	“ a little — M — , you know ! ”
27132	27136	27138	27138	she	319	“ containing documents , ”
27219	27227	27229	27231	our poor hostess	1590	“ Extremely honored , I am sure , ”
27238	27418	27419	27419	She	1591	“ by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce . And very much indebted for the omen . It is a retired situation . Considering . I am limited as to situation . In consequence of the necessity of attending on the Chancellor . I have lived here many years . I pass my days in court ; my evenings and my nights here . I find the nights long , for I sleep but little , and think much . That is , of course , unavoidable ; being in Chancery . I am sorry I can not offer chocolate . I expect a judgment shortly , and shall then place my establishment on a superior footing . At present , I do n't mind confessing to the wards in Jarndyce ( in strict confidence ) , that I sometimes find it difficult to keep up a genteel appearance . I have felt the cold here . I have felt something sharper than cold . It matters very little . Pray excuse the introduction of such mean topics . ”
27469	27478	27479	27479	she	1591	“ I began to keep the little creatures , ”
27482	27585	27479	27479	she	1591	“ with an object that the wards will readily comprehend . With the intention of restoring them to liberty . When my judgment should be given . Ye - es ! They die in prison , though . Their lives , poor silly things , are so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings , that , one by one , the whole collection has died over and over again . I doubt , do you know , whether one of these , though they are all young , will live to be free ! Ve - ry mortifying , is it not ? ”
27623	27626	27627	27627	she	1591	“ Indeed , ”
27630	27678	27679	27679	Richard	320	“ I positively doubt sometimes , I do assure you , whether while matters are still unsettled , and the sixth or Great Seal still prevails , I may not one day be found lying stark and senseless here , as I have found so many birds ! ”
27721	27731	27733	27736	the little old lady	1502	“ I ca n't allow them to sing much , ”
27738	27818	27733	27736	the little old lady	1502	“ for ( you 'll think this curious ) I find my mind confused by the idea that they are singing , while I am following the arguments in court . And my mind requires to be so very clear , you know ! Another time , I 'll tell you their names . Not at present . On a day of such good omen , they shall sing as much as they like . In honor of youth , ”
27824	27827	27733	27736	the little old lady	1502	“ hope , ”
27833	27837	27733	27736	the little old lady	1502	“ and beauty , ”
27843	27854	27733	27736	the little old lady	1502	“ There ! We 'll let in the full light . ”
27863	27872	27874	27877	the little old lady	1502	“ I can not admit the air freely , ”
27893	27928	27874	27877	the little old lady	1502	“ because the cat you saw down stairs — called Lady Jane — is greedy for their lives . She crouches on the parapet outside , for hours and hours . I have discovered , ”
27932	28001	27874	27877	the little old lady	1502	“ that her natural cruelty is sharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty . In consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given . She is sly , and full of malice . I half believe , sometimes , that she is no cat , but the wolf of the old saying . It is so very difficult to keep her from the door . ”
28098	28122	28124	28124	she	1602	“ With such an omen , it is even more necessary than usual that I should be there before the Chancellor comes in , ”
28126	28152	28124	28124	she	1602	“ for he might mention my case the first thing . I have a presentiment that he will mention it the first thing this morning . ”
28229	28235	28236	28236	she	1602	“ The only other lodger , ”
28243	28280	28236	28236	she	1602	“ a law - writer . The children in the lanes here , say he has sold himself to the devil . I do n't know what he can have done with the money . Hush ! ”
28297	28300	28313	28313	her	1602	“ Hush ! ”

28536	28541	28558	28558	he	1258	“ What is it ? ”
28542	28544	28558	28558	he	1258	“ J. ”
28582	28587	28588	28588	I	0	“ What 's that ? ”
28651	28657	28658	28658	he	1258	“ What does that spell ? ”
28715	28718	28720	28722	the old man	1258	“ Hi ! ”
28729	28752	28720	28722	the old man	1258	“ I have a turn for copying from memory , you see , miss , though I can neither read nor write . ”
28795	28827	28786	28786	Richard	320	“ Miss Summerson , I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair . Do n't be tempted . Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook ! ”
28939	28949	28951	28951	Richard	320	“ Quite an adventure for a morning in London ! ”
28957	28972	28951	28951	Richard	320	“ Ah , cousin , cousin , it 's a weary word this Chancery ! ”
28973	28988	28990	28990	Ada	319	“ It is to me , and has been ever since I can remember , ”
28992	29093	28990	28990	Ada	319	“ I am grieved that I should be the enemy — as I suppose I am — of a great number of relations and others ; and that they should be my enemies — as I suppose they are ; and that we should all be ruining one another , without knowing how or why , and be in constant doubt and discord all our lives . It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . ”
29094	29099	29101	29101	Richard	320	“ Ah , cousin ! ”
29103	29195	29101	29101	Richard	320	“ Strange , indeed ! all this wasteful wanton chess - playing is very strange . To see that composed Court yesterday jogging on so serenely , and to think of the wretchedness of the pieces on the board , gave me the headache and the heartache both together . My head ached with wondering how it happened , if men were neither fools nor rascals ; and my heart ached to think they could possibly be either . But at all events , Ada — I may call you Ada ? ”
29196	29205	29261	29262	Miss Jellyby	332	“ Of course you may , cousin Richard . ”
29206	29245	29101	29101	Richard	320	“ At all events , Ada , Chancery will work none of its bad influence on us . We have happily been brought together , thanks to our good kinsman , and it ca n't divide us now ! ”
29246	29255	29257	29257	Ada	319	“ Never , I hope , cousin Richard ! ”
29836	29849	29851	29851	Richard	320	“ The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington , ”
29853	29869	29851	29851	Richard	320	“ and that waggon is the finishing touch . Halloa ! what 's the matter ? ”
29922	29931	29933	29933	Richard	320	“ Our postilion is looking after the waggoner , ”
29935	29950	29933	29933	Richard	320	“ and the waggoner is coming back after us . Good day , friend ! ”
29960	29969	29971	29971	Richard	320	“ Why , here 's an extraordinary thing ! ”

31622	31634	31611	31611	Ada	319	“ that perhaps she was a little unmindful of her home . ”

31685	31721	31682	31682	I	0	“ it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them ? ”

31736	31757	31729	31729	Richard	320	“ are really — I ca n't help expressing myself strongly , sir — in a devil of a state . ”
31758	31763	31765	31766	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ She means well , ”

31811	31849	31804	31805	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I 'll take an oath it 's either in the east , or going to be . I am always conscious of an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in the east . ”
31850	31855	31857	31857	Richard	320	“ Rheumatism , sir ? ”
31859	31900	31902	31903	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I dare say it is , Rick . I believe it is . And so the little Jell — I had my doubts about 'em — are in a — oh , Lord , yes , it 's easterly ! ”
32005	32040	32042	32043	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Those little Jellybys . Could n't you — didn't you — now , if it had rained sugar - plums , or three - cornered raspberry tarts , or anything of that sort ! ”
32045	32050	32051	32051	Ada	319	“ O cousin — ! ”
32055	32074	32051	32051	Ada	319	“ Good , my pretty pet . I like cousin . Cousin John , perhaps , is better . ”

32088	32097	32099	32100	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Ha , ha ! Very good indeed ! ”
32106	32116	32099	32100	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Sounds uncommonly natural . Yes , my dear ? ”
32117	32128	32083	32083	Ada	319	“ It did better than that . It rained Esther . ”
32129	32132	32134	32135	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Ay ? ”
32137	32143	32134	32135	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ What did Esther do ? ”
32144	32150	32152	32152	Ada	319	“ Why , cousin John , ”
32178	32209	32163	32163	her	319	“ Esther was their friend directly . Esther nursed them , coaxed them to sleep , washed and dressed them , told them stories , kept them quiet , bought them keepsakes”—My
32233	32281	32282	32286	The warm - hearted darling	1697	horse!—“and , cousin John , she softened poor Caroline , the eldest one , so much , and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable!—No , no , I wo n't be contradicted , Esther dear ! You know , you know , it 's true ! ”
32309	32329	32330	32330	I	0	“ At all events , cousin John , I will thank you for the companion you have given me . ”
32346	32357	32359	32360	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Where did you say the wind was , Rick ? ”
32362	32374	32359	32360	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ In the north , as we came down , sir . ”
32375	32402	32359	32360	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ You are right . There 's no east in it . A mistake of mine . Come , girls , come and see your home ! ”
33502	33510	33516	33516	he	313	“ I am glad you like it , ”
33529	33583	33516	33516	he	313	“ It makes no pretensions ; but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it . You have barely half an hour before dinner . There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth — a child . ”
33584	33590	33592	33592	Ada	319	“ More children , Esther ! ”
33594	33603	33592	33592	Ada	319	“ I do n't mean literally a child , ”
33608	33656	33592	33592	Ada	319	“ not a child in years . He is grown up — he is at least as old as I am — but in simplicity , and freshness , and enthusiasm , and a fine guileless inaptitude for all worldly affairs , he is a perfect child . ”
33666	33672	33674	33675	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ He knows Mrs. Jellyby , ”
33677	33753	33674	33675	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ He is a musical man ; an Amateur , but might have been a Professional . He is an Artist , too ; an Amateur , but might have been a Professional . He is a man of attainments and of captivating manners . He has been unfortunate in his affairs , and unfortunate in his pursuits , and unfortunate in his family ; but he do n't care — he 's a child ! ”
33754	33768	33770	33770	Richard	320	“ Did you imply that he has children of his own , sir ? ”
33772	33821	33823	33824	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Yes , Rick ! Half - a - dozen . More ! Nearer a dozen , I should think . But he has never looked after them . How could he ? He wanted somebody to look after him . He is a child , you know ! ”
33826	33839	33841	33841	Richard	320	“ And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? ”
33843	33852	33854	33855	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Why , just as you may suppose , ”
33862	33907	33908	33908	Richard	320	“ It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up , but dragged up . Harold Skimpole 's children have tumbled up somehow or other.—The wind 's getting round again , I am afraid . I feel it rather ! ”
33920	33925	33927	33928	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ It is exposed , ”
33930	33955	33927	33928	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ No doubt that 's the cause . Bleak House has an exposed sound . But you are coming my way . Come along ! ”
34022	34032	34034	34034	she	1754	“ For you , miss , if you please , ”
34036	34040	34034	34034	she	1754	“ For me ? ”
34043	34050	34051	34051	I	0	“ The housekeeping keys , miss . ”
34069	34095	34057	34057	she	1754	“ I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone , miss . Miss Summerson , if I do n't deceive myself ? ”
34096	34099	34101	34101	I.	0	“ Yes , ”
34102	34108	34065	34065	her	1754	“ That is my name . ”
34109	34658	34065	34065	her	1754	“ The large bunch is the housekeeping , and the little bunch is the cellars , miss . Any time you was pleased to appoint to - morrow morning , I was to show you the presses and things they belong to . ’ I said I would be ready at half - past six ; and , after she was gone , stood looking at the basket , quite lost in the magnitude of my trust . Ada found me thus ; and had such a delightful confidence in me when I showed her the keys , and told her about them , that it would have been insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged . I knew , to be sure , that it was the dear girl 's kindness ; but I liked to be so pleasantly cheated . When we went down stairs , we were presented to Mr. Skimpole , who was standing before the fire , telling Richard how fond he used to be , in his school - time , of football . He was a little bright creature , with a rather large head ; but a delicate face , and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him . All he said was so free from effort and spontaneous , and was said with such a captivating gaiety , that it was fascinating to hear him talk . Being of a more slender figure than Mr. Jarndyce , and having a richer complexion , with browner hair , he looked younger . Indeed , he had more the appearance , in all respects , of a damaged young man , than a well - preserved elderly one . There was an easy negligence in his manner , and even in his dress ( his hair carelessly disposed , and his neck - kerchief loose and flowing , as I have seen artists paint their own portraits ) , which I could not separate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some unique process of depreciation . It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life , by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences . I gathered from the conversation , that Mr. Skimpole had been educated for the medical profession , and had once lived , in his professional capacity , in the household of a German prince . He told us , however , that as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and measures , and had never known anything about them ( except that they disgusted him ) , he had never been able to prescribe with the requisite accuracy of detail . In fact , he said , he had no head for detail . And he told us , with great humour , that when he was wanted to bleed the prince , or physic any of his people , he was generally found lying on his back in bed , reading the newspapers , or making fancy - sketches in pencil , and could n't come . The prince , at last , objecting to this , “
34662	34672	34673	34673	he	1758	” said Mr. Skimpole , in the frankest manner , “
34678	34695	34057	34057	she	1754	” the engagement terminated ; and Mr. Skimpole having ( as he added with delightful gaiety ) “
34717	34941	34712	34712	himself	1758	” His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends then helped him , in quicker or slower succession , to several openings in life ; but to no purpose , for he must confess to two of the oddest infirmities in the world : one was , that he had no idea of time ; the other , that he had no idea of money . In consequence of which , he never kept an appointment , never could transact any business , and never knew the value of anything ! Well ! So he had got on in life , and here he was ! He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy - sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art . All he asked of society was , to let him live . That was n't much . His wants were few . Give him the papers , conversation , music , mutton , coffee , landscape , fruit in the season , a few sheets of Bristol - board , and a little claret , and he asked no more . He was a mere child in the world , but he did n't cry for the moon . He said to the world , “
34991	35153	35154	35154	I	0	” All this , and a great deal more , he told us , not only with the utmost brilliancy and enjoyment , but with a certain vivacious candor — speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair , as if Skimpole were a third person , as if he knew that Skimpole had his singularities , but still had his claims too , which were the general business of the community and must not be slighted . He was quite enchanting . If I felt at all confused at that early time , in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life ( which I am far from sure of ) , I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them . That he was free of them , I scarcely doubted ; he was so very clear about it himself . “
35158	35169	35154	35154	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , in the same light way . “
35474	35511	35515	35515	you	1768	” It was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the adjuration . Mr. Skimpole 's general position there would have rendered it so , without the addition of what he presently said . “
35525	35542	35515	35515	you	1768	” said Mr. Skimpole , addressing us , his new friends , in an impersonal manner . “
35682	35882	35675	35675	I	0	” Of all his playful speeches ( playful , yet always fully meaning what they expressed ) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce than this . I had often new temptations , afterwards , to wonder whether it was really singular , or only singular to me , that he , who was probably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion , should so desire to escape the gratitude of others . We were all enchanted . I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging qualities of Ada and Richard , that Mr. Skimpole , seeing them for the first time , should be so unreserved , and should lay himself out to be so exquisitely agreeable . They ( and especially Richard ) were naturally pleased for similar reasons , and considered it no common privilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man . The more we listened , the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked . And what with his fine hilarious manner , and his engaging candor , and his genial way of lightly tossing his own weaknesses about , as if he had said , “
35899	35912	35891	35891	You	1776	” ( he really made me consider myself in that light ) ; “
35927	36025	36026	36026	She	1777	me!”—the effect was absolutely dazzling . He was so full of feeling too , and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender , that he could have won a heart by that alone . In the evening when I was preparing to make tea , and Ada was touching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to her cousin Richard , which they had happened to mention , he came and sat down on the sofa near me , and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved him . “
36032	36036	36026	36026	She	1777	” he said . “
36101	36127	36095	36099	the child of the universe	1781	” Mr. Jarndyce , I found , was standing near us , with his hands behind him , and an attentive smile upon his face . “
36131	36135	36095	36099	the child of the universe	1781	” he observed , “
36146	36147	36138	36140	an indifferent parent	1784	” “
36155	36162	36150	36150	I	0	” cried Mr. Skimpole , buoyantly . “
36169	36174	36165	36165	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyee . “
36177	36182	36150	36150	I	0	” cried Mr. Skimpole , “
36217	36223	36213	36213	I	0	” glancing at the cousins , “
36286	36741	36743	36743	you	1789	” Mr. Jarndyee patted him on the head with a smile , as if he had been really a child ; and passing a step or two on , and stopping a moment , glanced at the young cousins . His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! ) saw again : which has long been engraven on my heart . The room in which they were , communicating with that in which he stood , was only lighted by the fire . Ada sat at the piano ; Richard stood beside her , bending down . Upon the wall , their shadows blended together , surrounded by strange forms , not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady fire , though reflected from motionless objects . Ada touched the notes so softly , and sang so low , that the wind , sighing away to the distant hills , was as audible as the music . The mystery of the future , and the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present , seemed expressed in the whole picture . But it is not to recal this fancy , well as I remember it , that I recal the scene . First , I was not quite unconscious of the contrast , in respect of meaning and intention , between the silent look directed that way , and the flow of words that had preceded it . Secondly , though Mr. Jarndyce 's glance , as he withdrew it , rested for but a moment on me , I felt as if , in that moment , he confided to me — and knew that he confided to me , and that I received the confidence — his hope that Ada and Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship . Mr. Skimpole could play on the piano , and the violoncello ; and he was a composer — had composed half an opera once , but got tired of it — and played what he composed , with taste . After tea we had quite a little concert , in which Richard — who was enthralled by Ada 's singing , and told me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were written — and Mr. Jarndyce , and I , were the audience . After a little while I missed , first Mr. Skimpole , and afterwards Richard ; and while I was thinking how could Richard stay away so long , and lose so much , the maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door , saying , “
36754	36774	36749	36749	you	1789	” When I was shut out with her in the hall , she said , holding up her hands , “
36802	36803	36795	36795	He	358	” “
36806	36809	36812	36812	miss	9100	” said I. “
36816	36981	36982	36983	Miss Summerson	305	” said the maid . I was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind ; but of course , I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one ; and collected myself , as I followed her quickly upstairs , sufficiently to consider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove to be a fit . She threw open a door , and I went into a chamber ; where , to my unspeakable surprise , instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched upon the bed , or prostrate on the floor , I found him standing before the fire smiling at Richard , while Richard , with a face of great embarrassment , looked at a person on a sofa , in a white great coat , with smooth hair upon his head and not much of it , which he was wiping smoother , and making less of , with a pocket - handkerchief . “
36985	36991	36982	36983	Miss Summerson	305	” said Richard , hurriedly , “
37020	37021	37010	37011	Mr. Skimpole	358	” “
37031	37041	37028	37029	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Skimpole , with his agreeable candor , “
37088	37117	37136	37137	Miss Summerson	305	” The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort , that he startled me . “
37126	37133	37134	37134	My	0	” I inquired of Mr. Skimpole . “
37139	37148	37134	37134	My	0	” said he , shaking his head pleasantly , “
37169	37183	37185	37186	the stranger	1287	“ It 's twenty - four pound , sixteen , and sevenpence ha'penny , ”
37188	37195	37185	37186	the stranger	1287	“ That 's wot it is . ”
37196	37205	37207	37208	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ And it sounds — somehow it sounds , ”
37210	37216	37207	37208	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ like a small sum ? ”
37248	37252	37254	37254	Richard	320	“ Mr. Skimpole , ”
37258	37287	37254	37254	Richard	320	“ has a delicacy in applying to my cousin Jarndyce , because he has lately — I think , sir , I understood you that you had lately — ”
37288	37293	37295	37296	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Oh , yes ! ”
37300	37343	37345	37345	he	1803	“ Though I forgot how much it was , and when it was . Jarndyce would readily do it again ; but I have the epicure - like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help ; that I would rather , ”
37352	37368	37345	37345	he	1803	“ develop generosity in a new soil , and in a new form of flower . ”
37369	37381	37383	37383	Richard	320	“ What do you think will be best , Miss Summerson ? ”
37406	37409	37411	37413	the strange man	1803	“ Jail , ”
37432	37436	37411	37413	the strange man	1803	“ Or Coavinses . ”
37437	37447	37411	37413	the strange man	1803	“ May I ask , sir , what is — ”
37448	37451	37453	37455	the strange man	1803	“ Coavinses ? ”
37457	37461	37453	37455	the strange man	1803	“ A ouse . ”
37532	37536	37537	37537	he	1803	“ I thought , ”
37550	37632	37537	37537	he	1803	“ that , being parties in a Chancery suit concerning ( as people say ) a large amount of property , Mr. Richard , or his beautiful cousin , or both , could sign something , or make over something , or give some sort of undertaking , or pledge , or bond ? I do n't know what the business name of it may be , but I suppose there is some instrument within their power that would settle this ? ”
37633	37640	37642	37644	the strange man	1803	“ Not a bit on it , ”
37646	37649	37642	37644	the strange man	1803	“ Really ? ”
37654	37671	37651	37652	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ That seems odd , now , to one who is no judge of these things ! ”
37672	37677	37679	37680	the stranger	1287	“ Odd or even , ”
37684	37695	37679	37680	the stranger	1287	“ I tell you , not a bit on it ! ”
37696	37709	37710	37711	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Keep your temper , my good fellow , keep your temper ! ”
37735	37800	37718	37718	he	358	“ Do n't be ruffled by your occupation . We can separate you from your office ; we can separate the individual from the pursuit . We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private life you are otherwise than a very estimable man , with a great deal of poetry in your nature , of which you may not be conscious . ”
37833	37847	37860	37860	he	358	“ Now , my dear Miss Summerson , and my dear Mr. Richard , ”
37872	37916	37860	37860	he	358	“ here you see me utterly incapable of helping myself , and entirely in your hands ! I only ask to be free . The butterflies are free . Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies ! ”
37917	37923	37925	37925	Richard	320	“ My dear Miss Summerson , ”
37931	37951	37925	37925	Richard	320	“ I have ten pounds that I received from Mr. Kenge . I must try what that will do . ”
38218	38232	38206	38206	He	358	“ Well then , I 'll wish you a good evening , miss . ”
38233	38237	38239	38240	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My friend , ”
38261	38273	38274	38274	I	0	“ I should like to ask you something , without offence . ”
38280	38286	38274	38274	I	0	“ Cut away , then ! ”
38287	38305	38307	38308	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? ”
38310	38319	38321	38321	Coavinses	359	“ Know'd it yes'day aft'noon at tea time , ”
38323	38339	38321	38321	Coavinses	359	“ It did n't affect your appetite ? Did n't make you at all uneasy ? ”
38340	38345	38347	38347	Coavinses	359	“ Not a bit , ”
38349	38376	38347	38347	Coavinses	359	“ I know'd if you wos missed to - day , you would n't be missed to - morrow . A day makes no such odds . ”
38377	38385	38387	38388	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ But when you came down here , ”
38390	38422	38387	38388	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ it was a fine day . The sun was shining , the wind was blowing , the lights and shadows were passing across the fields , the birds were singing . ”
38423	38433	38435	38435	Coavinses	359	“ Nobody said they warn't , in my hearing , ”
38437	38440	38442	38443	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ No , ”
38445	38455	38442	38443	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ But what did you think upon the road ? ”
38456	38462	38464	38464	Coavinses	359	“ Wot do you mean ? ”
38473	38496	38464	38464	Coavinses	359	“ Think ! I 've got enough to do , and little enough to get for it , without thinking . Thinking ! ”
38503	38514	38516	38517	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Then you did n't think , at all events , ”
38519	38599	38516	38517	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ to this effect . ‘ Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine ; loves to hear the wind blow ; loves to watch the changing lights and shadows ; loves to hear the birds , those choristers in Nature 's great cathedral . And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold Skimpole of his share in such possessions , which are his only birthright ! ’ You thought nothing to that effect ? ”
38600	38609	38611	38611	Coavinses	359	“ I — certainly — did — NOT , ”
38658	38676	38678	38679	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Very odd and very curious , the mental process is , in you men of business ! ”
38683	38693	38678	38679	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Thank you , my friend , Good night . ”
39015	39029	39030	39030	he	313	“ Oh , dear me , what 's this , what 's this ! ”
39046	39099	39030	39030	he	313	“ What 's this they tell me ? Rick , my boy , Esther , my dear , what have you been doing ? Why did you do it ? How could you do it ? How much apiece was it?—The wind 's round again . I feel it all over me ! ”
39110	39162	39030	39030	he	313	“ Come , Rick , come ! I must settle this before I sleep . How much are you out of pocket ? You two made the money up , you know ! Why did you ? How could you?—O Lord , yes , it 's due east — must be ! ”
39163	39168	39170	39170	Richard	320	“ Really , sir , ”
39172	39193	39170	39170	Richard	320	“ I do n't think it would be honorable in me to tell you . Mr. Skimpole relied upon us — ”
39194	39208	39210	39211	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Lord bless you , my dear boy ! He relies upon everybody ! ”
39224	39229	39210	39211	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Indeed , sir ? ”
39230	39246	39248	39249	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Everybody ! And he 'll be in the same scrape again , next week ! ”
39269	39323	39248	39249	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ He 's always in the same scrape . He was born in the same scrape . I verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined , was ‘ On Tuesday last , at her residence in Botheration Buildings , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ’ ”
39331	39404	39324	39324	Richard	320	“ Still , sir , I do n't want to shake his confidence , or to break his confidence ; and if I submit to your better knowledge again , that I ought to keep his secret , I hope you will consider before you press me any more . Of course , if you do press me , sir , I shall know I am wrong , and will tell you . ”
39405	39408	39410	39411	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Well ! ”
39429	39512	39513	39513	He	313	“ I — here ! Take it away , my dear . I do n't know what I am about with it ; it 's all the wind — invariably has that effect — I wo n't press you , Rick ; you may be right . But , really — to get hold of you and Esther — and to squeeze you like a couple of tender young Saint Michael 's oranges!—It'll blow a gale in the course of the night ! ”
39574	39580	39582	39583	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Eh , my dear ? ”
39590	39599	39601	39601	I	0	“ — Being quite a child , sir , ”
39603	39611	39601	39601	I	0	“ and so different from other people — ”
39612	39617	39619	39620	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ You are right ! ”
39624	39659	39619	39620	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Your woman 's wit hits the mark . He is a child — an absolute child . I told you he was a child , you know , when I first mentioned him . ”
39667	39680	39682	39683	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ And he is a child . Now , is n't he ? ”
39697	39719	39721	39722	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ When you come to think of it , it 's the height of childishness in you — I mean me — ”
39724	39763	39721	39722	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ to regard him for a moment as a man . You ca n't make him responsible . The idea of Harold Skimpole with designs or plans , or knowledge of consequences ! Ha , ha , ha ! ”
39844	39857	39859	39860	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Why , what a cod 's head and shoulders I am , ”
39862	39927	39933	39933	his	313	“ to require reminding of it ! The whole business shows the child from beginning to end . Nobody but a child would have thought of singling you two out for parties in the affair ! Nobody but a child would have thought of your having the money ! If it had been a thousand pounds , it would have been just the same ! ”
39950	39959	39961	39962	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ To be sure , to be sure ! ”
39964	40020	39961	39962	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ However , Rick , Esther , and you too , Ada , for I do n't know that even your little purse is safe from his inexperience — I must have a promise all round , that nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more . No advances ! Not even sixpences . ”
40053	40058	40060	40061	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ As to Skimpole , ”
40063	40136	40137	40137	He	313	“ a habitable doll 's house , with good board , and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow money of , would set the boy up in life . He is in a child 's sleep by this time , I suppose ; it 's time I should take my craftier head to my more worldly pillow . Good night , my dears . God bless you ! ”
40157	40187	40194	40194	himself	313	“ O ! I have been looking at the weather - cock . I find it was a false alarm about the wind . It 's in the south ! ”
40540	40552	40535	40535	I	0	“ Esther , Esther , Esther ! Duty , my dear ! ”
40930	40945	40926	40927	the opener	1849	“ Woa grey , then , steady ! Noabody wants you to - day ! ”
41192	41206	41184	41184	he	1846	“ Rain , rain , rain ! Nothing but rain,—and no family here ! ”
41652	41659	41660	41660	She	363	“ is what she looks at . ”
41803	41824	41800	41800	she	363	“ fifty year three months and a fortnight , by the blessing of Heaven , if I live till Tuesday . ”
42085	42095	42081	42081	he	1895	“ Leave me , and send Mrs. Rouncewell here ! ”
42410	42414	42416	42417	Sir Leicester	290	“ Mrs. Rouncewell , ”
42419	42476	42416	42417	Sir Leicester	290	“ I can never consent to argue , as you know , with any one on any subject . You had better get rid of your boy ; you had better get him into some Works . The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . ”
42652	42682	42684	42685	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! And , once again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! ”
42687	42705	42684	42685	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ You are a fine young fellow . You are like your poor uncle George . Ah ! ”
42719	42730	42706	42707	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ They say I am like my father , grandmother . ”
42731	42751	42752	42753	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Like him , also , my dear,—but most like your poor uncle George ! And your dear father . ”
42759	42764	42752	42753	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ He is well ? ”
42765	42774	42752	42753	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Thriving , grandmother , in every way . ”
42775	42780	42752	42753	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ I am thankful ! ”
42815	42821	42823	42823	she	363	“ He is quite happy ? ”
42825	42828	42823	42823	she	363	“ Quite . ”
42829	42897	42823	42823	she	363	“ I am thankful ! So , he has brought you up to follow in his ways , and has sent you into foreign countries and the like ? Well , he knows best . There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I do n't understand . Though I am not young , either . And I have seen a quantity of good company too ! ”
42898	42901	42903	42905	the young man	1928	“ Grandmother , ”
42911	42932	42903	42905	the young man	1928	“ what a very pretty girl that was , I found with you just now . You called her Rosa ? ”
42933	43000	42823	42823	she	363	“ Yes , child . She is daughter of a widow in the village . Maids are so hard to teach , now - a - days , that I have put her about me young . She 's an apt scholar , and will do well . She shews the house already , very pretty . She lives with me , at my table here . ”
43001	43011	42903	42905	the young man	1928	“ I hope I have not driven her away ? ”
43012	43045	43047	43048	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ She supposes we have family affairs to speak about , I dare say . She is very modest . It is a fine quality in a young woman . And scarcer , ”
43058	43064	43047	43048	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ than it formerly was ! ”
43084	43087	43089	43089	she	363	“ Wheels ! ”
43104	43118	43091	43091	They	1930	“ What wheels on such a day as this , for gracious sake ? ”
43130	43134	43091	43091	They	1930	“ Come in ! ”
43185	43193	43195	43196	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ What company is this , Rosa ? ”
43198	43229	43195	43196	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ It 's two young men in a gig , ma'am , who want to see the house — yes , and if you please , I told them so ! ”
43242	43289	43195	43196	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ I went to the hall door , and told them it was the wrong day , and the wrong hour ; but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet , and begged me to bring this card to you . ”
43290	43298	43300	43301	the housekeeper	982	“ Read it , my dear Watt , ”
43339	43342	43333	43333	Rosa	370	“ Mr. Guppy ”
43351	43354	43356	43357	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Guppy ! ”
43359	43371	43356	43357	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Mr. Guppy ! Nonsense , I never heard of him ! ”
43372	43382	43384	43384	Rosa	370	“ If you please , he told me that ! ”
43386	43494	43384	43384	Rosa	370	“ But he said that he and the other young gentleman came from London only last night by the mail , on business at the magistrates ' meeting ten miles off , this morning ; and that as their business was soon over , and they had heard a great deal said of Chesney Wold , and really did n't know what to do with themselves , they had come through the wet to see it . They are lawyers . He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn 's office , but is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's name , if necessary . ”
43623	43631	43633	43634	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Much obliged to you , ma'am ! ”
43646	43674	43675	43677	The old housekeeper	1945	“ Us London lawyers do n't often get an out ; and when we do , we like to make the most of it , you know . ”
44012	44016	44018	44019	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Dear me ! ”
44021	44026	44018	44019	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Who 's that ? ”
44027	44036	44038	44038	Rosa	370	“ The picture over the fire - place , ”
44040	44065	44038	44038	Rosa	370	“ is the portrait of the present Lady Dedlock . It is considered a perfect likeness , and the best work of the master . ”
44066	44070	44072	44073	Mr. Guppy	326	“ ' Blest ! ”
44085	44107	44072	44073	Mr. Guppy	326	“ if I can ever have seen her . Yet I know her ! Has the picture been engraved , miss ? ”
44108	44123	44038	44038	Rosa	370	“ The picture has never been engraved . Sir Leicester has always refused permission . ”
44124	44127	44129	44130	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Well ! ”
44136	44162	44129	44130	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I 'll be shot if it an't very curious how well I know that picture ! So that 's Lady Dedlock , is it ! ”
44163	44190	44038	44038	Rosa	370	“ The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock . The picture on the left is his father , the late Sir Leicester . ”
44202	44209	44210	44210	he	326	“ It 's unaccountable to me , ”
44219	44231	44233	44234	Mr. Guppy	326	“ how well I know that picture ! I 'm dashed ! ”
44239	44258	44233	44234	Mr. Guppy	326	“ if I do n't think I must have had a dream of that picture , you know ! ”
44453	44478	44445	44445	her	288	“ The terrace below is much admired . It is called , from an old story in the family , The Ghost 's Walk . ”
44479	44482	44484	44485	Mr. Guppy	326	“ No ? ”
44490	44505	44484	44485	Mr. Guppy	326	“ what 's the story , miss ? Is it anything about a picture ? ”
44506	44513	44515	44515	Watt	367	“ Pray tell us the story , ”
44522	44531	44515	44515	Watt	367	“ I do n't know it , sir . ”
44538	44551	44553	44554	the housekeeper	982	“ It is not related to visitors ; it is almost forgotten , ”
44558	44569	44553	44554	the housekeeper	982	“ It has never been more than a family anecdote . ”
44570	44589	44591	44592	Mr. Guppy	326	“ You 'll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a picture , ma'am , ”
44594	44621	44591	44592	Mr. Guppy	326	“ because I do assure you that the more I think of that picture the better I know it , without knowing how I know it ! ”
44729	44803	44713	44713	herself	363	“ In the wicked days , my dears , of King Charles the First — I mean , of course , in the wicked days of the rebels who leagued themselves against that excellent King — Sir Morbury Dedlock was the owner of Chesney Wold . Whether there was any account of a ghost in the family before those days , I ca n't say . I should think it very likely indeed . ”
44854	44859	44861	44862	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Sir Morbury Dedlock , ”
44864	44985	44861	44862	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ was , I have no occasion to say , on the side of the blessed martyr . But it is supposed that his lady , who had none of the family blood in her veins , favored the bad cause . It is said that she had relations among King Charles 's enemies ; that she was in correspondence with them ; and that she gave them information . When any of the country gentlemen who followed His Majesty 's cause met here , it is said that my Lady was always nearer to the door of their council - room than they supposed . Do you hear a sound like a footstep passing along the terrace , Watt ? ”
44993	45004	45006	45008	the young man	1928	“ I hear the rain - drip on the stones , ”
45010	45031	45006	45008	the young man	1928	“ and I hear a curious echo — I suppose an echo — which is very like a halting step . ”
45039	45256	45032	45033	The housekeeper	982	“ Partly on account of this division between them , and partly on other accounts , Sir Morbury and his Lady led a troubled life . She was a lady of a haughty temper . They were not well suited to each other in age or character , and they had no children to moderate between them . After her favorite brother , a young gentleman , was killed in the civil wars ( by Sir Morbury 's near kinsman ) , her feeling was so violent that she hated the race into which she had married . When the Dedlocks were about to ride out from Chesney Wold in the King 's cause , she is supposed to have more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night , and lamed their horses ; and the story is , that once , at such an hour , her husband saw her gliding down the stairs , and followed her into the stall where his own favorite horse stood . There he seized her by the wrist ; and in a struggle or in a fall , or through the horse being frightened and lashing out , she was lamed in the hip , and from that hour began to pine away . ”
45270	45490	45491	45491	Watt	367	“ She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage . She never complained of the change ; she never spoke to any one of being crippled , or of being in pain ; but , day by day , she tried to walk upon the terrace ; and , with the help of a stick , and with the help of the stone balustrade , went up and down , up and down , up and down , in sun and shadow , with greater difficulty every day . At last , one afternoon , her husband ( to whom she had never , on any persuasion , opened her lips since that night ) , standing at the great south window , saw her drop upon the pavement . He hastened down to raise her , but she repulsed him as he bent over her , and looking at him fixedly and coldly , said ‘ I will die here , where I have walked . And I will walk here , though I am in my grave . I will walk here , until the pride of this house is humbled . And when calamity , or when disgrace is coming to it , let the Dedlocks listen for my step ! ’ ”
45514	45526	45528	45529	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ There and then she died . And from those days , ”
45531	45600	45528	45529	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ the name has come down — The Ghost 's Walk . If the tread is an echo , it is an echo that is only heard after dark , and is often unheard for a long while together . But it comes back , from time to time ; and so sure as there is sickness or death in the family , it will be heard then . ”
45601	45608	45610	45610	Watt	367	“ — And disgrace , grandmother — ”
45612	45620	45622	45623	the housekeeper	982	“ Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold , ”
45630	45635	45625	45626	Her grandson	1947	“ True . True . ”
45636	45653	45655	45656	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ That is the story . Whatever the sound is , it is a worrying sound , ”
45664	45752	45655	45656	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ and what is to be noticed in it , is , that it must be heard . My lady , who is afraid of nothing , admits that when it is there , it must be heard . You can not shut it out . Watt , there is a tall French clock behind you ( placed there , ' a purpose ) that has a loud beat when it is in motion , and can play music . You understand how those things are managed ? ”
45753	45762	45625	45626	Her grandson	1947	“ Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ”
45763	45769	45770	45770	Watt	367	“ Set it a going . ”
45780	45786	45788	45789	the housekeeper	982	“ Now , come hither , ”
45791	45836	45788	45789	the housekeeper	982	“ Hither , child , towards my lady 's pillow . I am not sure that it is dark enough yet , but listen ! Can you hear the sound upon the terrace , through the music , and the beat , and everything ? ”

45843	45849	45625	45626	Her grandson	1947	“ So my lady says . ”
46737	46805	46731	46732	The Drone	378	“ You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop ! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to see , and so short a time to see it in , that I must take the liberty of looking about me , and begging to be provided for by somebody who does n't want to look about him . ”
47006	47013	47015	47016	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Sit down , my dear , ”
47018	47042	47015	47016	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ This , you must know , is the Growlery . When I am out of humour , I come and growl here . ”
47043	47053	47055	47055	I.	0	“ You must be here very seldom , sir , ”
47056	47065	47066	47066	he	313	“ O , you do n't know me ! ”
47069	47120	47066	47066	he	313	“ When I am deceived or disappointed in — the wind , and it 's Easterly , I take refuge here . The Growlery is the best used room in the house . You are not aware of half my humours yet . My dear , how you are trembling ! ”
47235	47240	47241	47241	he	313	“ There ! There ! ”
47244	47256	47241	47241	he	313	“ That 's over . Pooh ! Do n't be foolish . ”
47257	47266	47267	47267	I	0	“ It shall not happen again , sir , ”
47270	47277	47267	47267	I	0	“ but at first it is difficult ”
47279	47282	47283	47283	he	313	“ Nonsense ! ”
47286	47375	47283	47283	he	313	“ it 's easy , easy . Why not ? I hear of a good little orphan girl without a protector , and I take it into my head to be that protector . She grows up , and more than justifies my good opinion , and I remain her guardian and her friend . What is there in all this ? So , so ! Now , we have cleared off old scores , and I have before me thy pleasant , trusting , trusty face again . ”
47381	47401	47376	47376	I	0	“ Esther , my dear , you surprise me ! This really is not what I expected of you ! ”
47471	47477	47478	47478	he	313	“ Of course , Esther , ”
47481	47490	47478	47478	he	313	“ you do n't understand this Chancery business ? ”
47499	47507	47508	47508	he	313	“ I do n't know who does , ”
47511	47647	47478	47478	he	313	“ The Lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth . It 's about a Will , and the trusts under a Will — or it was , once . It 's about nothing but Costs , now . We are always appearing , and disappearing , and swearing , and interrogating , and filing , and cross - filing , and arguing , and sealing , and motioning , and referring , and reporting , and revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites , and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death , about Costs . That 's the great question . All the rest , by some extraordinary means , has melted away . ”
47648	47655	47657	47657	I	0	“ But it was , sir , ”
47672	47677	47665	47665	he	313	“ about a Will ? ”
47678	47694	47695	47695	he	313	“ Why , yes , it was about a Will when it was about anything , ”
47698	48090	47695	47695	he	313	“ A certain Jarndyce , in an evil hour , made a great fortune , and made a great Will . In the question how the trusts under that Will are to be administered , the fortune left by the Will is squandered away ; the legatees under the Will are reduced to such a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punished , if they had committed an enormous crime in having money left them ; and the Will itself is made a dead letter . All through the deplorable cause , everything that everybody in it , except one man , knows already , is referred to that only one man who do n't know it , to find out — all through the deplorable cause , everybody must have copies , over and over again , of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of cartloads of papers ( or must pay for them without having them , which is the usual course , for nobody wants them ) ; and must go down the middle and up again , through such an infernal country - dance of costs and fees and nonsense and corruption , as was never dreamed of in the wildest visions of a Witch 's Sabbath . Equity sends questions to Law , Law sends questions back to Equity ; Law finds it ca n't do this , Equity finds it ca n't do that ; neither can so much as say it ca n't do anything , without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A , and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B ; and so on through the whole alphabet , like the history of the Apple Pie . And thus , through years and years , and lives and lives , everything goes on , constantly beginning over and over again , and nothing ever ends . And we ca n't get out of the suit on any terms , for we are made parties to it , and must be parties to it , whether we like it or not . But it wo n't do to think of it ! When my great Uncle , poor Tom Jarndyce , began to think of it , it was the beginning of the end ! ”
48091	48104	48105	48105	He	2029	“ The Mr. Jarndyce , sir , whose story I have heard ? ”
48109	48145	48105	48105	He	2029	“ I was his heir , and this was his house , Esther . When I came here , it was bleak , indeed . He had left the signs of his misery upon it . ”
48146	48154	48155	48155	I	0	“ How changed it must be now ! ”
48158	48282	48155	48155	I	0	“ It had been called , before his time , the Peaks . He gave it its present name , and lived here shut up : day and night poring over the wicked heaps of papers in the suit , and hoping against hope to disentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close . In the meantime , the place became dilapidated , the wind whistled through the cracked walls , the rain fell through the broken roof , the weeds choked the passage to the rotting door . When I brought what remained of him home here , the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too ; it was so shattered and ruined . ”
48322	48338	48339	48339	I	0	“ I told you this was the Growlery , my dear . Where was I ? ”
48354	48571	48339	48339	I	0	“ Bleak House : true . There is , in that city of London there , some property of ours , which is much at this day what Bleak House was then,—I say property of ours , meaning of the Suit 's , but I ought to call it the property of Costs ; for Costs is the only power on earth that will ever get anything out of it now , or will ever know it for anything but an eyesore and a heartsore . It is a street of perishing blind houses , with their eyes stoned out ; without a pane of glass , without so much as a window - frame , with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their hinges and falling asunder ; the iron rails peeling away in flakes of rust ; the chimneys sinking in ; the stone steps to every door ( and every door might be Death 's Door ) turning stagnant green ; the very crutches on which the ruins are propped , decaying . Although Bleak House was not in Chancery , its master was , and it was stamped with the same seal . These are the Great Seal 's impressions , my dear , all over England — the children know them ! ”
48572	48578	48579	48579	I	0	“ How changed it is ! ”
48583	48590	48591	48591	he	2031	“ Why , so it is , ”
48597	48615	48591	48591	he	2031	“ and it is wisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture . ”
48624	48658	48591	48591	he	2031	“ These are things I never talk about , or even think about , excepting in the Growlery , here . If you consider it right to mention them to Rick and Ada , ”
48664	48677	48591	48591	he	2031	“ you can . I leave it to your discretion , Esther . ”
48678	48682	48683	48683	I.	0	“ I hope , sir”—said
48684	48697	48683	48683	I.	0	“ I think you had better call me Guardian , my dear . ”
48712	48720	48721	48721	he	2032	“ Esther , now , you know you are!”—when
48778	48784	48786	48786	I	0	“ I hope , Guardian , ”
48788	48850	48786	48786	I	0	“ that you may not trust too much to my discretion . I hope you may not mistake me . I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you to know that I am not clever — but it really is the truth ; and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to confess it . ”
48893	48902	48904	48904	I	0	“ I hope I may turn out so , ”
48906	48917	48904	48904	I	0	“ but I am much afraid of it , Guardian . ”
48918	48937	48938	48938	he	2032	“ You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here , my dear , ”
48943	48962	48938	48938	he	2032	“ the little old woman of the Child 's ( I do n't mean Skimpole 's ) Rhyme . “
49026	49077	48986	48986	You	0	” This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman , and Little Old Woman , and Cobweb , and Mrs. Shipton , and Mother Hubbard , and Dame Durden , and so many names of that sort , that my own name soon became quite lost among them . “
49080	49085	48986	48986	You	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
49111	49127	49132	49132	Esther	305	” O my goodness , the idea of asking my advice on such a point ! “
49134	49152	49129	49129	he	2038	” said Mr. Jarndyce , comfortably putting his hands in his pockets and stretching out his legs . “
49186	49187	49191	49191	Guardian	9676	” “
49193	49196	49191	49191	Guardian	9676	” said I. “
49200	49204	49191	49191	Guardian	9676	” said he . “
49378	49460	49369	49369	I	0	” He began to rub his head again , and to hint that he felt the wind . But it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me , that whether he rubbed his head , or walked about , or did both , his face was sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine ; and he was sure to turn comfortable again , and put his hands in his pockets and stretch out his legs . “
49471	49475	49369	49369	I	0	” said I , “
49486	49487	49481	49481	he	2049	” “
49491	49495	49481	49481	he	2049	” he returned . “
49554	49653	49551	49552	little woman	2052	” I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was attaining , and the number of things that were being confided to me . I had not meant this at all ; I had meant that he should speak to Richard . But of course I said nothing in reply , except that I would do my best , though I feared ( I really felt it necessary to repeat this ) that he thought me much more sagacious than I was . At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard . “
49656	49667	49551	49552	little woman	2052	” he said , rising and pushing back his chair . “
49699	49721	49692	49692	you	305	” He looked so attentively at me , that I looked attentively at him , and felt sure I understood him . “
49727	49730	49692	49692	you	305	” said I. “
49733	49734	49692	49692	you	305	” “
49737	49760	49735	49735	Guardian	9676	” said I , venturing to put my hand , which was suddenly colder than I could have wished , in his , “
49829	50596	50599	50600	young ladies	2058	” He drew my hand through his arm , and we went away to look for Ada . From that hour I felt quite easy with him , quite unreserved , quite content to know no more , quite happy . We lived , at first , rather a busy life at Bleak House ; for we had to become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce . It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew him , who wanted to do anything with anybody else 's money . It amazed us , when we began to sort his letters , and to answer some of them for him in the Growlery of a morning , to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money . The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen ; indeed , I think they were even more so . They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner , and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary . It appeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in dealing out subscription - cards to the whole Post - office Directory — shilling cards , half - crown cards , half - sovereign cards , penny cards . They wanted everything . They wanted wearing apparel , they wanted linen rags , they wanted money , they wanted coals , they wanted soup , they wanted interest , they wanted autographs , they wanted flannel , they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had — or had not . Their objects were as various as their demands . They were going to raise new buildings , they were going to pay off debts on old buildings , they were going to establish in a picturesque building ( engraving of proposed West Elevation attached ) the Sisterhood of Mediæval Marys ; they were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby ; they were going to have their Secretary 's portrait painted , and presented to his mother - in - law , whose deep devotion to him was well known ; they were going to get up everything , I really believe , from five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity , and from a marble monument to a silver tea - pot . They took a multitude of titles . They were the Women of England , the Daughters of Britain , the Sisters of all the Cardinal Virtues separately , the Females of America , the Ladies of a hundred denominations . They appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing . They seemed to our poor wits , and according to their own accounts , to be constantly polling people by tens of thousands , yet never bringing their candidates in for anything . It made our heads ache to think , on the whole , what feverish lives they must lead . Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious benevolence ( if I may use the expression ) , was a Mrs. Pardiggle , who seemed , as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce , to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself . We observed that the wind always changed , when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation : and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce , and prevented his going any farther , when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people ; one , the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise ; the other , the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all . We were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle , suspecting her to be a type of the former class ; and were glad when she called one day with her five young sons . She was a formidable style of lady , with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room . And she really did , for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off . As only Ada and I were at home , we received her timidly ; for she seemed to come in like cold weather , and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed . “
50602	50616	50599	50600	young ladies	2058	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , with great volubility , after the first salutations , “
50783	50905	50906	50906	You	2069	” We had never seen such dissatisfied children . It was not merely that they were weazen and shrivelled — though they were certainly that too — but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent . At the mention of the Tockahoopo Indians , I could really have supposed Egbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe , he gave me such a savage frown . The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst . I must except , however , the little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy , who was stolidly and evenly miserable . “
50914	50919	50906	50906	You	2069	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
50925	50937	50906	50906	You	2069	” We said yes , we had passed one night there . “
50941	50999	50938	50939	Mrs. Jellyby	323	” pursued the lady , always speaking in the same demonstrative , loud , hard tone , so that her voice impressed my fancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too — and I may take the opportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less engaging by her eyes being what Ada called “
51003	51008	50938	50939	Mrs. Jellyby	323	” meaning very prominent : “
51158	51200	51201	51201	They	2074	” I was afterwards convinced ( and so was Ada ) that from the ill - conditioned eldest child , these words extorted a sharp yell . He turned it off into a yawn , but it began as a yell . “
51234	51240	51242	51242	they	2074	” said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly , “
51472	51493	51494	51494	You	2088	” Alfred glowered at us as if he never could , or would , forgive the injury of that night . “
51502	51507	51494	51494	You	2088	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
51632	51690	51691	51691	You	0	” Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby , and suppose Mr. Jellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle , would Mr. Pardiggle , in return , make any confidential communication to Mr. Jellyby ? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this , but it came into my head . “
51698	51739	51691	51691	You	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . We were glad to change the subject ; and , going to the window , pointed out the beauties of the prospect , on which the spectacles appeared to me to rest with curious indifference . “
51745	51767	51742	51743	Mr. Gusher	399	” said our visitor . We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher 's acquaintance . “
51777	51787	51773	51773	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , with her commanding deportment . “
51847	51883	51887	51887	you	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , moving back to her chair , and overturning , as if by invisible agency , a little round table at a considerable distance with my work - basket on it , “
51897	51943	51887	51887	you	0	” This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in perfect dismay . As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness , after what I had been thinking , it must have been expressed in the color of my cheeks . “
51950	51955	51947	51947	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
52035	52072	52073	52073	I	0	” We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying ; or something to that effect . I do n't think we knew why it was either , but this was what our politeness expressed . “
52093	52098	52084	52084	you	2100	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . “
52164	52219	52151	52151	I	0	” If that dark - visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it . I observed that he doubled his right fist , and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm . “
52233	52238	52151	52151	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . “
52314	52520	52521	52521	You	2105	” At first I tried to excuse myself , for the present , on the general ground of having occupations to attend to , which I must not neglect . But as this was an ineffectual protest , I then said , more particularly , that I was not sure of my qualifications . That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated , and addressing them from suitable points of view . That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work . That I had much to learn , myself , before I could teach others , and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone . For these reasons , I thought it best to be as useful as I could , and to render what kind services I could , to those immediately , about me ; and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand itself . All this I said , with anything but confidence ; because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I , and had great experience , and was so very military in her manners . “
52528	52532	52521	52521	You	2105	” said she : “
52615	52855	52608	52608	she	319	” Ada and I interchanged looks , and , as we were going out in any case , accepted the offer . When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family languishing in a corner , and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained . Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada , and I followed with the family . Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone ( that , indeed , I overheard ) , all the way to the brickmaker 's , about an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged against another lady , relative to the bringing in of their rival candidates for a pension somewhere . There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling ; and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners — who were not elected yet . I am very fond of being confided in by children , and am happy in being usually favored in that respect , but on this occasion it gave me great uneasiness . As soon as we were out of doors , Egbert , with the manner of a little footpad , demanded a shilling of me , on the ground that his pocket - money was “
52857	52883	52885	52885	her	2109	” from him . On my pointing out the great impropriety of the word , especially in connexion with his parent ( for he added sulkily “
52887	52895	52885	52885	her	2109	” ) , he pinched me and said “
52950	53441	52937	52937	you	2110	” These exasperating questions so inflamed his mind , and the minds of Oswald and Francis , that they all pinched me at once , and in a dreadfully expert way : screwing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly forbear crying out . Felix , at the same time , stamped upon my toes . And the Bond of Joy , who , on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated , stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry - cook 's shop , that he terrified me by becoming purple . I never underwent so much , both in body and mind , in the course of a walk with young people , as from these unnaturally constrained children , when they paid me the compliment of being natural . I was glad when we came to the brickmaker 's house ; though it was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brickfield , with pigsties close to the broken windows , and miserable little gardens before the doors , growing nothing but stagnant pools . Here and there , an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain - water from a roof , or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt - pie . At the doors and windows , some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us , except to laugh to one another , or to say something as we passed , about gentlefolks minding their own business , and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's . Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination , and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people ( though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place ) , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground - floor room of which we nearly filled . Besides ourselves , there were in this damp offensive room — a woman with a black eye , nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire ; a man , all stained with clay and mud , and looking very dissipated , lying at full length on the ground , smoking a pipe ; a powerful young man , fastening a collar on a dog ; and a bold girl , doing some kind of washing in very dirty water . They all looked up at us as we came in , and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire , as if to hide her bruised eye ; nobody gave us any welcome . “
53447	53474	52937	52937	you	2110	” said Mrs. Pardiggle ; but her voice had not a friendly sound , I thought ; it was much too business - like and systematic . “
53516	53517	53502	53502	I	0	” “
53521	53541	53502	53502	I	0	” growled the man on the floor , whose head rested on his hand as he started at us , “
53553	53554	53502	53502	I	0	” “
53560	53576	53502	53502	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , seating herself on one stool , and knocking down another . “
53582	53583	53502	53502	I	0	” “
53595	53653	53654	53654	You	1617	” said the man , with his pipe between his lips , as he looked round upon us . The young man and the girl both laughed . Two friends of the young men whom we had attracted to the doorway , and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily . “
53663	53671	53654	53654	You	1617	” said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter . “
53690	53691	53686	53686	I	0	” “
53699	53707	53686	53686	I	0	” growled the man upon the floor . “
54068	54423	54063	54063	she	2128	” ’ He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this , and he now turned over on his other side , and smoked again . Mrs. Pardiggle , who had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible composure , calculated , I could not help thinking , to increase his antagonism , pulled out a good book , as if it were a constable 's staff , and took the whole family into custody . I mean into religious custody , of course ; but she really did it , as if she were an inexorable moral Policeman carrying them all off to a station house . Ada and I were very uncomfortable . We both felt intrusive and out of place ; and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better , if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking possession of people . The children sulked and stared ; the family took no notice of us whatever , except when the young man made the dog bark : which he usually did , when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic . We both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there was an iron barrier , which could not be removed by our new friend . By whom , or how , it could be removed , we did not know ; but we knew that . Even what she read and said , seemed to us to be ill chosen for such auditors , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact . As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred , we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards ; and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it , though he had had no other on his desolate island . We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. Pardiggle left off . The man on the floor then turning his head round again , said morosely , “
54433	54434	54431	54431	you	2129	” “
54464	54472	54452	54452	I	0	” returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness . “
54480	54495	54496	54496	you	1760	” said he , folding his arms and shutting his eyes with an oath , “
54503	54746	54748	54748	Esther	305	” Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose , and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped . Taking one of her young family in each hand , and telling the others to follow closely , and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when she saw them next , she then proceeded to another cottage . I hope it is not unkind in me to say that she certainly did make , in this , as in everything else , a show that was not conciliatory , of doing charity by wholesale , and of dealing in it to a large extent . She supposed that we were following her ; but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire , to ask if the baby were ill . She only looked at it as it lay on her lap . We had observed before , that when she looked at it she covered her discolored eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill - treatment , from the poor little child . Ada , whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance , bent down to touch its little face , As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back . The child died . “
54750	54761	54748	54748	Esther	305	” cried Ada , sinking on her knees beside it . “
54815	55035	55036	55036	Jenny	401	” Such compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping , and put her hand upon the mother 's , might have softened any mother 's heart that ever beat . The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment , and then burst into tears . Presently I took the light burden from her lap ; did what I could to make the baby 's rest the prettier and gentler ; laid it on a shelf , and covered it with my own handkerchief . We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children . She answered nothing , but sat weeping — weeping very much . When I turned , I found that the young man had taken out the dog , and was standing at the door looking in upon us ; with dry eyes , but quiet . The girl was quiet too , and sat in a corner looking on the ground . The man had risen . He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance , but he was silent . An ugly woman , very poorly clothed , hurried in while I was glancing at them , and coming straight up to the mother , said , “
55040	55115	55116	55116	Jenny	401	” The mother rose on being so addressed , and fell upon the woman 's neck . She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill - usage . She had no kind of grace about her , but the grace of sympathy ; but when she condoled with the woman , and her own tears fell , she wanted no beauty . I say condoled , but her only words were “
55120	55542	55118	55118	Jenny	401	” All the rest was in the tone in which she said them . I thought it very touching to see these two women , coarse and shabby and beaten , so united ; to see what they could be to one another ; to see how they felt for one another ; how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard trials of their lives . I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us . What the poor are to the poor is little known , excepting to themselves and GOD . We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted . We stole out quietly , and without notice from any one except the man . He was leaning against the wall near the door ; and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass , went out before us . He seemed to want to hide that he did this on our account , but we perceived that he did , and thanked him . He made no answer . Ada was so full of grief all the way home , and Richard , whom we found at home , was so distressed to see her in tears ( though he said to me when she was not present , how beautiful it was too ! ) that we arranged to return at night with some little comforts , and repeat our visit at the brickmaker 's house . We said as little as we could to Mr. Jarndyce , but the wind changed directly . Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition . On our way there , we had to pass a noisy drinking - house , where a number of men were flocking about the door . Among them , and prominent in some dispute , was the father of the little child . At a short distance , we passed the young man and the dog , in congenial company . The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women , at the corner of the row of cottages ; but she seemed ashamed , and turned away as we went by . We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker 's dwelling , and proceeded by ourselves . When we came to the door , we found the woman who had brought such consolation with her , standing there , looking anxiously out . “
55553	55560	55561	55561	I	0	” she said in a whisper . “
55593	55594	55586	55586	he	2139	” “
55601	55604	55586	55586	he	2139	” said I. “
55654	55771	55641	55641	I	0	” As she gave way for us , we went softly in , and put what we had brought , near the miserable bed on which the mother slept . No effort had been made to clean the room — it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form , from which so much solemnity diffused itself , had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly ! “
55777	55783	55773	55773	Heaven	365	” we said to her . “
55790	55791	55792	55792	Me	0	” “
55797	55803	55792	55792	Me	0	” she returned with surprise . “
55810	55969	55970	55970	Jenny	401	” The mother had moaned in her sleep , and moved . The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again . She was quiet once more . How little I thought , when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny sleeper underneath , and seemed to see a halo shine around the child through Ada 's drooping hair as her pity bent her head — how little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come to lie , after covering the motionless and peaceful breast ! I only thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a hand ; not all unconscious of her presently , when we had taken leave , and left her at the door , by turns looking , and listening in terror for herself , and saying in her old soothing manner , “
55974	56036	55972	55972	Jenny	401	” I DON'T know how it is , I seem to be always writing about myself . I mean all the time to write about other people , and I try to think about myself as little as possible , and I am sure , when I find myself coming into the story again , I am really vexed and say , “
56052	56367	56048	56048	you	1146	” but it is all of no use . I hope any one who may read what I write , will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me , I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with them , and ca n't be kept out . My darling and I read together , and worked , and practised ; and found so much employment for our time , that the winter days flew by us like bright - winged birds . Generally in the afternoons , and always in the evenings , Richard gave us his company . Although he was one of the most restless creatures in the world , he certainly was very fond of our society . He was very , very , very fond of Ada . I mean it , and I had better say it at once . I had never seen any young people falling in love before , but I found them out quite soon . I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it . On the contrary , I was so demure , and used to seem so unconscious , that sometimes I considered within myself while I was sitting at work , whether I was not growing quite deceitful . But there was no help for it . All I had to do was to be quiet , and I was as quiet as a mouse . They were as quiet as mice , too , so far as any words were concerned ; but the innocent manner in which they relied more and more upon me , as they took more and more to one another , was so charming , that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me . “
56380	56408	56375	56378	a capital old woman	2152	” Richard would say , coming up to meet me in the garden early , with his pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush , “
56477	56478	56479	56479	You	2156	” “
56487	56510	56482	56483	Dame Durden	388	” Ada would say at night , with her head upon my shoulder , and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes , “
56555	56630	56632	56632	he	2160	” Ah ! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor . We had talked it over very often , now , and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of his childhood for the sea . Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family , a great Sir Leicester Dedlock , for his interest in Richard 's favor , generally ; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner , “
56708	56709	56711	56711	I	0	” “
56718	56724	56711	56711	I	0	“ said Richard to me , “
56804	56970	56971	56971	My	0	” With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged , Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me — principally because he mistook it , in such a very odd way , for prudence . It entered into all his calculations about money , in a singular manner , which I do n't think I can better explain than by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole . Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount , either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses , and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard . The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds , and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or realised that amount , would form a sum in simple addition . “
56979	57002	56974	56974	Hubbard	387	” he said to me , when he wanted , without the least consideration , to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker . “
57016	57017	57003	57003	I	0	” “
57022	57025	57003	57003	I	0	” said I. “
57058	57059	57052	57052	You	2168	” “
57062	57065	57052	57052	You	2168	” said I. “
57078	57079	57070	57070	I	0	” “
57085	57089	57070	57070	I	0	” I hinted . “
57098	57102	57103	57103	I	0	” returned Richard . “
57127	57168	57170	57170	me	0	” In exactly the same way , when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good , he carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it . “
57173	57178	57170	57170	me	0	” he would say . “
57247	57467	57469	57469	Boythorn	403	” I believe Richard 's was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be . He was ardent and brave , and , in the midst of all his wild restlessness , was so gentle , that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks . His gentleness was natural to him , and would have shown itself , abundantly , even without Ada 's influence ; but , with it , he became one of the most winning of companions , always so ready to be interested , and always so happy , sanguine , and light - hearted . I am sure that I , sitting with them , and walking with them , and talking with them , and noticing from day to day how they went on , falling deeper and deeper in love , and saying nothing about it , and each shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets , perhaps not yet suspected even by the other — I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than they were , and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream . We were going on in this way , when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter , and looking at the superscription said , “
57475	57505	57469	57469	Boythorn	403	” and opened and read it with evident pleasure , announcing to us , in a parenthesis , when he was about half - way through , that Boythorn was “
57508	57553	57554	57554	I	0	” on a visit . Now , who was Boythorn ? we all thought . And I dare say we all thought , too — I am sure I did , for one — would Boythorn at all interfere with what was going forward ? “
57565	57581	57562	57563	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” said Mr. Jarndyce , tapping the letter as he laid it on the table , “
57658	57659	57654	57656	a tremendous fellow	2181	” “
57665	57669	57654	57656	a tremendous fellow	2181	” asked Richard . “
57679	57684	57673	57673	Rick	350	” said Mr. Jarndyce ; “
57749	57781	57788	57789	the man	1653	” As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn , we observed the favorable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind . “
57833	57837	57829	57829	I	0	” he pursued . “
57962	57966	57959	57960	his man	2196	” to me , “
57976	58079	57959	57960	his man	2196	” I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn 's reception , and we looked forward to his arrival with some curiosity . The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear . The dinner - hour arrived , and still he did not appear . The dinner was put back an hour , and we were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze , when the hall - door suddenly burst open , and the hall resounded with these words , uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a stentorian tone : “
58151	58152	58154	58154	he	2198	” “
58160	58165	58154	58154	he	2198	” Mr. Jarndyee enquired . “
58184	58189	58177	58177	his	2205	” returned the other . “
58239	58240	58222	58222	I	0	” “
58246	58251	58222	58222	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58258	58271	58222	58222	I	0	” laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , really making the whole house vibrate . “
58357	58358	58348	58348	I	0	” “
58366	58371	58348	58348	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58381	58382	58375	58375	you	0	” “
58389	58402	58375	58375	you	0	” returned his guest , who seemed to refer to his watch , “
58443	58444	58437	58437	myself	0	” “
58453	58458	58437	58437	myself	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58467	58472	58473	58473	I	0	” cried the visitor . “
58509	58528	58499	58499	I	0	” Talking thus , they went up - stairs ; and presently we heard him in his bedroom thundering “
58535	58538	58499	58499	I	0	” and again “
58545	58883	58499	58499	I	0	” until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion , and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did , or as we did when we heard him laugh . We all conceived a prepossession in his favor ; for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous healthy voice , and in the roundness and fulness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing . But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance , when Mr. Jarndyce presented him . He was not only a very handsome old gentleman — upright and stalwart as he had been described to us — with a massive grey head , a fine composure of face when silent , a figure that might have become corpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest , and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist ; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner , so chivalrously polite , his face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness , and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide , but showed himself exactly as he was — incapable ( as Richard said ) of anything on a limited scale , and firing away with those blank great guns , because he carried no small arms whatever — that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner , whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me , or was led by Mr. Jarndyee into some great volley of superlatives , or threw up his head like a blood - hound , and gave out that tremendous Ha , ha , ha ! “
58895	58900	58884	58884	You	2218	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58913	58918	58919	58919	He	2219	” replied the other . “
58981	59069	58966	58967	his father	9568	” The subject of this laudation was a very little canary , who was so tame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn 's man , on his forefinger , and , after taking a gentle flight round the room , alighted on his master 's head . To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments , with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead , was to have a good illustration of his character , I thought . “
59076	59095	58966	58967	his father	9568	” he said , very gently holding up a bit of bread to the canary to peck at , “
59174	59192	59193	59193	I	0	” ( All this time , the very small canary was eating out of his hand . ) “
59211	59218	59193	59193	I	0	” returned Mr. Jarndyce , laughing , “
59240	59241	59193	59193	I	0	” “
59260	59265	59193	59193	I	0	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
59344	59452	59456	59456	you	2231	” It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he recommended this strong measure of reform . When we laughed , he threw up his head and shook his broad chest , and again the whole country seemed to echo to his Ha , ha , ha ! It had not the least effect in disturbing the bird , whose sense of security was complete ; and who hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now on that , turning its bright sudden eye on its master , as if he were no more than another bird . “
59469	59474	59456	59456	you	2231	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
59487	59488	59489	59490	The fellow	2233	” “
59509	59514	59500	59500	I	0	” returned Mr. Boythorn . “
59543	59544	59540	59541	Sir Lucifer	404	” “
59551	59562	59540	59541	Sir Lucifer	404	” said my Guardian laughingly , to Ada and Richard . “
59576	59581	59563	59563	I	0	” resumed our visitor , “
59622	59623	59625	59625	he	2233	” “
59629	59633	59625	59625	he	2233	” suggested Richard . “
59638	59648	59649	59650	that fellow	2204	” exclaimed Mr. Boythorn , suddenly firing another volley , “
60076	60183	60051	60051	He	2233	” To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy , one might have thought him the angriest of mankind . To see him , at the very same time , looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb , and softly smoothing its feathers with his forefinger , one might have thought him the gentlest . To hear him laugh , and see the broad good - nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke . “
60188	60192	60051	60051	He	2233	” he said , “
60209	60217	60205	60205	I	0	” here he softened in a moment , “
60328	60329	60331	60336	the man to allow his junior	2275	” “
60344	60349	60331	60336	the man to allow his junior	2275	” said my Guardian . “
60354	60381	60331	60336	the man to allow his junior	2275	” said Mr. Boythorn , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection , that had something serious in it , though he laughed . “
60441	60442	60447	60447	Esther	305	” “
60449	60454	60447	60447	Esther	305	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
60459	60460	60457	60457	Guardian	9676	” “
60464	60469	60457	60457	Guardian	9676	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
60492	60507	60482	60483	Miss Summerson	305	” ( They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . ) “
60550	60645	60541	60541	they	2281	” I saw him so often , in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music — and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music , for his face showed it — that I asked my Guardian , as we sat at the backgammon board , whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married . “
60648	60652	60541	60541	they	2281	” said he . “
60655	60656	60541	60541	they	2281	” “
60663	60666	60658	60658	he	2282	” said I. “
60674	60682	60669	60669	you	0	” he returned , with a smile . “
60687	60704	60685	60685	Guardian	382	” I explained , not without reddening a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts , “
60730	60754	60718	60718	he	2282	” Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting , as I have just described him . I said no more . “
60762	60766	60755	60755	You	0	” he answered . “
60781	60782	60811	60811	you	0	” “

60867	60872	60856	60856	He	2282	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
60902	61471	60896	60896	your	0	” I felt , from my Guardian 's manner , that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind . I therefore forbore to ask any further questions . I was interested , but not curious . I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn 's lusty snoring ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing — imagine old people young again , and invested with the graces of youth . But I fell asleep before I had succeeded , and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother 's house . I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects , to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life . With the morning , there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn , informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon him at noon . As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills , and added up my books , and made all the household affairs as compact as possible , I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and Richard , took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion . Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy 's clerk , and then was to go on foot to meet them on their return . Well ! I was full of business , examining tradesmen 's books , adding up columns , paying money , filing receipts , and I dare say making a great bustle about it , when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in . I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down , might be the young gentleman who had met me at the coach - office ; and I was glad to see him , because he was associated with my present happiness . I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart . He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on , a shining hat , lilac - kid gloves , a neckerchief of a variety of colours , a large hot - house flower in his button - hole , and a thick gold ring on his little finger . Besides which , he quite scented the dining - room with bear's - grease , and other perfumery . He looked at me with an attention that quite confused me , when I begged him to take a seat until the servant should return ; and as he sat there , crossing and uncrossing his legs in a corner , and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride , and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well , I never looked at him , but I found him looking at me , in the same scrutinizing and curious way . When the request was brought to him that he would go up - stairs to Mr. Boythorn 's room , I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for him when he came down , of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake . He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , “
61484	61637	61641	61641	miss	9100	” I replied yes , I should be there ; and he went out with a bow and another look . I thought him only awkward and shy , for he was evidently much embarrassed ; and I fancied that the best thing I could do , would be to wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted , and then to leave him to himself . The lunch was soon brought , but it remained for some time on the table . The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one — and a stormy one too , I should think ; for , although his room was at some distance , I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind , and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation . At last Mr. Guppy came back , looking something the worse for the conference . “
61643	61651	61641	61641	miss	9100	” he said in a low voice , “
61657	61658	61654	61655	a Tartar	2294	” “
61666	61770	61664	61664	sir	9019	” said I. Mr. Guppy sat down at the table , and began nervously sharpening the carving - knife on the carving - fork ; still looking at me ( as I felt quite sure without looking at him ) , in the same unusual manner . The sharpening lasted so long , that at last I felt a kind of obligation on me to raise my eyes , in order that I might break the spell under which he seemed to labour , of not being able to leave off . He immediately looked at the dish , and began to carve . “
61787	61788	61779	61779	You	9100	” “
61794	61797	61792	61792	you	9019	” said I. “
61812	61825	61810	61810	miss	9100	” said Mr. Guppy , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine . “
61831	61834	61829	61829	you	9019	” said I. “
61857	61858	61851	61851	I	0	” “
61897	61918	61893	61893	I'm	0	” he drank off two more glasses of wine , one after another . I thought I had better go . “
61926	61939	61924	61924	miss	9100	” said Mr. Guppy , rising , when he saw me rise . “
61954	61966	61942	61942	you	9100	” Not knowing what to say , I sat down again . “
61975	61988	61973	61973	miss	9100	” said Mr. Guppy , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table . “
61997	62003	61994	61994	you	0	” said I , wondering . “
62074	62075	62076	62076	I	0	” “
62084	62088	62076	62076	I	0	” said I , “

62141	62172	62130	62130	I	0	” All this time Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief , or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his right . “
62209	62230	62231	62231	You	9100	” He did so , and came back again . I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table . “
62246	62254	62242	62242	you	9100	” said Mr. Guppy , apparently refreshed . “
62258	62261	62242	62242	you	9100	” said I. “
62267	62272	62242	62242	you	9100	” said Mr. Guppy ; “
62528	62552	62504	62504	you	9100	” Mr. Guppy went down on his knees . I was well behind my table , and not much frightened . I said , “
62578	62579	62564	62564	you	9019	” “
62586	62595	62564	62564	you	9019	” said Mr. Guppy , folding his hands . “
62607	62611	62605	62605	sir	9019	” I returned , “
62643	62655	62636	62636	you	9019	” He looked piteously , but slowly rose and did so . “
62665	62690	62663	62663	miss	9100	” he said , with his hand upon his heart , and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray , “
62713	62714	62701	62702	The soul	2319	” “
62721	62725	62726	62726	you	9019	” said I ; “
62742	62743	62744	62744	I	0	” “
62749	62754	62744	62744	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy . “

62789	62793	62768	62768	I	0	” said I , “

62807	62843	62844	62844	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy , leaning forward over the tray , and regarding me , as I again strangely felt , though my eyes were not directed to him , with his late intent look , “
62975	63022	63023	63024	Cruel Miss	408	” I told him that he addressed my interest , or what he supposed to be my interest , quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination ; and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately . “
63026	63031	63023	63024	Cruel Miss	408	” said Mr. Guppy , “
63203	63204	63205	63205	I	0	” “
63213	63228	63210	63211	Mr. Guppy	326	” said I , rising and putting my hand upon the bell - rope , “
63300	63314	63297	63297	I	0	” I think I added , without very well knowing what I said , “
63341	63342	63347	63347	miss	9100	” “
63349	63363	63347	63347	miss	9100	” cried Mr. Guppy , checking me as I was about to ring . “
63370	63371	63372	63372	I	0	” “
63378	63382	63372	63372	I	0	” said I , “
63394	63395	63402	63402	miss	9100	” “
63490	64121	63474	63475	Mrs. Guppy	325	” I rang the bell , the servant came , and Mr. Guppy , laying his written card upon the table , and making a dejected bow , departed . Raising my eyes as he went out , I once more saw him looking at me after he had passed the door . I sat there for another hour or more , finishing my books and payments , and getting through plenty of business . Then , I arranged my desk , and put everything away , and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident . But , when I went up - stairs to my own room , I surprised myself by beginning to laugh about it , and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it . In short , I was in a flutter for a little while ; and felt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been since the days of the dear old doll , long buried in the garden . ON the eastern borders of Chancery Lane , that is to say , more particularly , in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby , Law Stationer , pursues his lawful calling . In the shade of Cook 's Court , at most times a shady place , Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process ; in skins and rolls of parchment ; in paper — foolscap , brief , draft , brown , white , whitey - brown , and blotting ; in stamps ; in office - quills , pens , ink , India - rubber , pounce , pins , pencils , sealing - wax , and wafers ; in red tape , and green ferret ; in pocket - books , almanacks , diaries , and law lists ; in string boxes , rulers , inkstands — glass and leaden , penknives , scissors , bodkins , and other small office - cutlery ; in short , in articles too numerous to mention ; ever since he was out of his time , and went into partnership with Peffer . On that occasion , Cook 's Court was in a manner revolutionised by the new inscription in fresh paint , PEFFER and SNAGSBY , displacing the time - honored and not easily to be deciphered legend , PEFFER , only . For smoke , which is the London ivy , had so wreathed itself round Peffer 's name , and clung to his dwelling - place , that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree . Peffer is never seen in Cook 's Court now . He is not expected there , for he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. Andrew 's , Holborn , with the wagons and hackney - coaches roaring past him , all the day and half the night , like one great dragon . If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest , to air himself again in Cook 's Court , until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street , whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain , since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it — if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook 's Court , which no law - stationer in the trade can positively deny , he comes invisibly , and no one is the worse or wiser . In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of Snagsby 's “
64123	64589	64590	64590	I	0	” of seven long years , there dwelt with Peffer , in the same law - stationering premises , a niece — a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end . The Cook's - Courtiers had a rumour flying among them , that the mother of this niece did , in her daughter 's childhood , moved by too jealous a solicitude that her figure should approach perfection , lace her up every morning with her maternal foot against the bed - post for a stronger hold and purchase ; and further , that she exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon - juice : which acids , they held , had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient . With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated , it either never reached , or never influenced , the cars of young Snagsby ; who , having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man 's estate , entered into two partnerships at once . So now , in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one ; and the niece still cherishes her figure — which , however tastes may differ , is unquestionably so far precious , that there is mighty little of it . Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh , but , to the neighbours ' thinking , one voice too . That voice , appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone , is heard in Cook 's Court very often . Mr. Snagsby , otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones , is rarely heard . He is a mild , bald , timid man , with a shining head , and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back . He tends to meekness and obesity . As he stands at his door in Cook 's Court , in his grey shop - coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds ; or stands behind a desk in his dark shop , with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin , in company with his two ' Prentices ; he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man . From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave , there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned ; and , haply on some occasions , when these reach a sharper pitch than usual , Mr. Snagsby mentions to the ' Prentices , “
64603	64746	64590	64590	I	0	” This proper name , so used by Mr. Snagsby , has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook's - Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby ; seeing that she might with great force and expression be termed a Guster , in compliment to her stormy character . It is , however , the possession , and the only possession , except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing , of a lean young woman from a workhouse ( by some supposed to have been christened Augusta ) ; who , although she was farmed or contracted for , during her growing time , by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting , and can not fail to have been developed under the most favorable circumstances , “
64748	65474	64590	64590	I	0	fits”—which the parish ca n't account for . Guster , really aged three or four and twenty , but looking a round ten years older , goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits ; and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron Saint , that except when she is found with her head in the pail , or the sink , or the copper , or the dinner , or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her seizure , she is always at work . She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the ' Prentices , who feel that there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth ; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby , who can always find fault with her ; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby , who thinks it a charity to keep her . The Law - stationer 's establishment is , in Guster 's eyes , a Temple of plenty and splendor . She believes the little drawing - room up - stairs , always kept , as one may say , with its hair in papers and its pinafore on , to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom . The view it commands of Cook 's Court at one end ( not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street ) , and of Coavins 's the sheriff 's officer 's backyard at the other , she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty . The portraits it displays in oil — and plenty of it too — of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby , and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby , are in her eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian . Guster has some recompenses for her many privations . Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business , to Mrs. Snagsby . She manages the money , reproaches the Tax - gatherers , appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays , licenses Mr. Snagsby 's entertainments , and acknowledges no responsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner ; insomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the neighbouring wives , a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides , and even out in Holborn , who , in any domestic passages of arms , habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their ( the wives ' ) position and Mrs. Snagsby 's , and their ( the husbands ' ) behaviour and Mr. Snagsby 's . Rumour , always flying , bat - like , about Cook 's Court , and skimming in and out at everybody 's windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive ; and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he would n't stand it . It is even observed , that the wives who quote him to their self - willed husbands as a shining example , in reality look down upon him ; and that nobody does so with greater superciliousness than one particular lady , whose lord is more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of correction . But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby 's being , in his way , rather a meditative and poetical man ; loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer time , and to observe how countrified the sparrows and the leaves are ; also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon , and to remark ( if in good spirits ) that there were old times once , and that you 'd find a stone coffin or two , now , under that chapel , he 'll be bound , if you was to dig for it . He solaces his imagination , too , by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices , and Masters of the Rolls , who are deceased ; and he gets such a flavor of the country out of telling the two ' Prentices how he has heard say that a brook “
65479	66289	64590	64590	I	0	” once ran right down the middle of Holborn , when Turnstile really was a turnstile leading slap away into the meadows — gets such a flavor of the country out of this , that he never wants to go there . The day is closing in and the gas is lighted , but is not yet fully effective , for it is not quite dark . Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop - door looking up at the clouds , sees a crow , who is out late , skim westward over the leaden slice of sky belonging to Cook 's Court . The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln 's Inn Garden , into Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Here , in a large house , formerly a house of state , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn . It is let off in sets of chambers now ; and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like maggots in nuts . But its roomy staircases , passages , and antechambers , still remain ; and even its painted ceilings , where Allegory , in Roman helmet and celestial linen , sprawls among balustrades and pillars , flowers , clouds , and big - legged boys , and makes the head ache — as would seem to be Allegory 's object always , more or less . Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendant names , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn , when not speechlessly at home in country - houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death . Here he is to - day , quiet at his table . An Oyster of the old school , whom nobody can open . Like as he is to look at , so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon . Rusty , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it . Heavy broad - backed old - fashioned mahogany and horse - hair chairs , not easily lifted , obsolete tables with spindle - legs and dusty baize covers , presentation prints of the holders of great titles in the last generation , or the last but one , environ him . A thick and dingy Turkey - carpet muffles the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old - fashioned silver candlesticks , that give a very insufficient light to his large room . The titles on the backs of his books have retired into the binding ; everything that can have a lock has got one ; no key is visible . Very few loose papers are about . He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it . With the round top of an inkstand , and two broken bits of sealing - wax , he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind . Now , the inkstand top is in the middle : now , the red bit - of sealing - wax , now the black bit . That 's not it . Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up , and begin again . Here , beneath the painted ceiling , with foreshortened Allegory staring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him , and he cutting it dead , Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office . He keeps no staff ; only one middle - aged man , usually a little out at elbows , who sits in a high Pew in the hall , and is rarely overburdened with business . Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way . He wants no clerks . He is a great reservoir of confidences , not to be so tapped . His clients want him ; he is all in all . Drafts that he requires to be drawn , are drawn by special - pleaders in the Temple on mysterious instructions ; fair copies that he requires to be made , are made at the stationer 's , expense being no consideration . The middle - aged man in the Pew , knows scarcely more of the affairs of the Peerage , than any crossing - sweeper in Holborn . The red bit , the black bit , the inkstand top , the other inkstand top , the little sand - box . So ! You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left . This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never.—Now ! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up , adjusts his spectacles , puts on his hat , puts the manuscript in his pocket , goes out , tells the middle - aged man out at elbows , “
66296	66446	66290	66290	I	0	” Very rarely tells him anything more explicit . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes , as the crow came — not quite so straight , but nearly — to Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street . To Snagsby 's , Law Stationer 's , Deeds engrossed and copied , Law - Writing executed in all its branches , & c. , & c. , & c. It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon , and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook 's Court . It hovers about Snagsby 's door . The hours are early there ; dinner at half - past one , and supper at half - past nine . Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into the subterranean regions to take tea , when he looked out of his door just now , and saw the crow who was out late . “
66451	66548	66549	66549	Master	9322	” Guster is minding the shop , for the ' Prentices take tea in the kitchen , with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe - maker 's two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second - floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two ' Prentices to distraction , as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster , whose hair wo n't grow , and never would , and , it is confidently thought , never will . “
66553	66639	66549	66549	Master	9322	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . Master is at home , and Guster will fetch him . Guster disappears , glad to get out of the shop , which she regards with mingled dread and veneration , as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture of the law : a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off . Mr. Snagsby appears : greasy , warm , herbaceous , and chewing . Bolts a bit of bread and butter . Says , “
66649	66650	66646	66647	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” “
66661	66662	66659	66659	Snagsby	409	” “
66693	66737	66691	66691	sir	9019	” Snagsby has brightened in a moment . The confined room , strong of parchment - grease , is warehouse , counting - house , and copying - office . Mr. Tulkinghorn sits , facing round , on a stool at the desk . “
66744	66745	66748	66748	sir	9019	” “
66750	66792	66748	66748	sir	9019	” Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas , and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit . Mr. Snagsby , as a timid man , is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions , and so to save words . “
66804	66805	66810	66810	we	2341	” “
66813	66814	66810	66810	we	2341	” “
66821	66843	66810	66810	we	2341	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , carelessly feeling — tight , unopenable Oyster of the old school!—in the wrong coat - pocket , “
66908	66909	66914	66914	sir	9019	” “
66916	66954	66914	66914	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , taking it , laying it flat on the desk , and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a twist of the left hand peculiar to law - stationers . “
66996	67042	67043	67043	Jewby	419	” Mr. Snagsby takes his Book down from the safe , makes another bolt of the bit of bread and butter which seems to have stopped short , eyes the affidavit aside , and brings his right forefinger travelling down a page of the Book . “
67049	67050	67051	67051	Jarndyce	420	” “
67059	67064	67057	67057	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
67097	67124	67129	67129	him	2347	” Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry , found it before the Law - stationer , read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill . “
67133	67138	67139	67139	Nemo	344	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
67175	67176	67177	67177	Nemo	344	” “
67179	67184	67177	67177	Nemo	344	” repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn . “

67207	67217	67202	67202	sir	9019	” Mr. Snagsby submits , with his deferential cough . “
67258	67306	67310	67311	a customer	2356	” The tail of Mr. Snagsby 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop - door to know what he means by deserting his tea . Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs. Snagsby , as who should say , “
67313	67314	67319	67319	sir	9019	” “
67321	67326	67319	67319	sir	9019	” repeats Mr. Snagsby . “
67413	67500	67401	67401	You	9019	” Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavins 's , the sheriff 's officer 's , where lights shine in Coavins 's windows . Coavins 's coffee - room is at the back , and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds . Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head , to glance over his shoulder at his little woman , and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect : “
67517	67518	67401	67401	You	9019	” “
67527	67532	67520	67520	you	9019	” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn . “

67576	67592	67571	67571	he	2368	” Mr. Snagsby makes another bolt , as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable—“at
67599	67600	67571	67571	he	2368	” “
67612	67613	67602	67602	you	9019	” “
67621	67646	67619	67619	sir	9019	” Mr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat , pulls on his black coat , takes his hat from its peg . “
67655	67660	67619	67619	sir	9019	” he says aloud . “
67707	67751	67692	67693	Mrs. Snagsby	411	” Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer , retires behind the counter , peeps at them through the window - blind , goes softly into the back office , refers to the entries in the book still lying open . Is evidently curious . “
67763	67783	67761	67761	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , walking deferentially in the road , and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer ; “
67838	68033	67816	67816	He	2387	” It is quite dark now , and the gas - lamps have acquired their full effect . Jostling against clerks going to post the day 's letters , and against counsel and attornies going home to dinner , and against plaintiffs and defendants , and suitors of all sorts , and against the general crowd , in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life — diving through law and equity , and through that kindred mystery , the street mud , which is made or nobody knows what , and collects about us nobody knows whence or how : we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it , we find it necessary to shovel it away — the lawyer and the law - stationer come to a Rag and Bottle shop , and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise , lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln 's Inn , and kept , as is announced in paint , to all whom it may concern , by one Krook . “
68042	68049	68040	68040	sir	9019	” says the law - stationer . “
68059	68065	68067	68067	you	9019	” says the lawyer unconcernedly . “
68069	68070	68067	68067	you	9019	” “
68079	68080	68072	68072	you	9019	” “
68104	68209	68102	68102	you	9019	” Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat , and returns to his little woman and his tea . But , Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present . He goes a short way , turns back , comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook , and enters it straight . It is dim enough , with a blot - headed candle or so in the windows , and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire . The old man rises and comes forward , with another blot - headed candle in his hand . “
68217	68218	68219	68221	Male or female	2392	” “
68225	68230	68231	68231	Male	2394	” says Mr. Krook . “
68239	68262	68233	68237	The person who does copying	2395	” Mr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly . Knows him by sight . has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute . “
68272	68273	68264	68264	you	9019	” “
68276	68277	68264	68264	you	9019	” “
68286	68294	68281	68281	I	0	” says Mr. Krook with a grin . “
68314	68315	68312	68312	sir	9019	” “
68325	68330	68316	68316	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
68343	68366	68316	68316	I	0	” Mr. Krook , with his cat beside him , stands at the bottom of the staircase , looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
68371	68404	68316	68316	I	0	” he says , when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared . The lawyer looks down over the hand - rail . The cat expands her wicked mouth , and snarls at him . “
68427	68438	68421	68421	they	2402	” whispers Krook , going up a step or two . “
68446	68447	68441	68441	they	2402	” “
68515	68940	68512	68512	my	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way . He comes to the dark door on the second floor . He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so . The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it , if he had not . It is a small room , nearly black with soot , and grease , and dirt . In the rusty skeleton of a grate , pinched at the middle as if Poverty had gripped it , a red coke fire burns low . In the corner by the chimney , stand a deal table and a broken desk : a wilderness marked with a rain of ink . In another corner , a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs , serves for cabinet or wardrobe ; no larger one is needed , for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man . The floor is bare ; except that one old mat , trodden to shreds of rope - yarn , lies perishing upon the hearth . No curtain veils the darkness of the night , but the discolored shutters are drawn together ; and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them , famine might be staring in — the Banshee of the man upon the bed . For , on a low bed opposite the fire , a confusion of dirty patchwork , lean - ribbed ticking , and coarse sacking , the lawyer , hesitating just within the doorway , sees a man . He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet . He has a yellow look , in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down , until the whole length of its wick ( still burning ) has doubled over , and left a tower of winding - sheet above it . His hair is ragged , mingling with his whiskers and his beard — the latter , ragged too , and grown , like the scum and mist around him , in neglect . Foul and filthy as the room is , foul and filthy as the air , it is not easy to perceive what fumes those are which most oppress the senses in it ; but through the general sickliness and faintness , and the odor of stale tobacco , there comes into the lawyer 's mouth the bitter , vapid taste of opium . “
68946	68981	68512	68512	my	0	” he cries , and strikes his iron candlestick against the door . He thinks he has awakened his friend . He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open . “
68987	68992	68993	68993	Hallo	422	” he cries again . “
68997	69060	68995	68995	Hallo	422	” As he rattles on the door , the candle which has drooped so long , goes out , and leaves him in the dark ; with the gaunt eyes in the shutters staring down upon the bed . A TOUCH on the lawyer 's wrinkled hand , as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say “
69065	69066	68995	68995	Hallo	422	” “
69071	69087	69069	69069	me	0	” returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear . “
69094	69095	69090	69090	you	0	” “
69098	69099	69090	69090	you	0	” “
69108	69109	69102	69102	you	0	” “
69119	69239	69090	69090	you	0	” Krook takes it , goes to the fire , stoops over the red embers , and tries to get a light . The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain . Muttering , after an ineffectual call to his lodger , that he will go down stairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop , the old man departs . Mr. Tulkinghorn , for some new reason that he has , does not await his return in the room , but on the stairs outside . The welcome light soon shines upon the wall , as Krook comes slowly up , with his green - eyed cat following at his heels . “
69248	69258	69241	69242	the man	1653	” inquires the lawyer , in a low voice . “
69266	69278	69279	69279	I	0	” says Krook , shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows . “
69296	69333	69292	69292	himself	1653	” Thus whispering , they both go in together . As the light goes in , the great eyes in the shutters , darkening , seem to close . Not so the eyes upon the bed . “
69338	69343	69292	69292	himself	1653	” exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
69348	69378	69292	69292	himself	1653	” Krook drops the heavy hand he has taken up , so suddenly that the arm swings over the bedside . They look at one another for a moment . “
69409	69437	69438	69439	Miss Flite	423	” says Krook , with his lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire 's wings . Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing , and calls “
69454	69483	69452	69452	Flite	423	” Krook follows him with his eyes , and , while he is calling , finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau , and steal back again . “
69496	69549	69490	69492	The nearest doctor	2414	” So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman , who is his female lodger : who appears and vanishes in a breath : who soon returns , accompanied by a testy medical man , brought from his dinner — with a broad snuffy upper lip , and a broad Scotch tongue . “
69559	69575	69557	69557	ye	423	” says the medical man , looking up at them after a moment 's examination . “
69584	69603	69576	69576	He	2414	” Mr. Tulkinghorn ( standing by the old portmanteau ) inquires if he has been dead any time ? “
69609	69615	69607	69607	sir	9019	” says the medical gentleman . “
69628	69629	69619	69619	he	2414	” “
69638	69653	69619	69619	he	2414	” observes a dark young man , on the other side of the bed . “
69664	69676	69662	69662	sir	9019	” inquires the first . The dark young man says yes . “
69686	69691	69678	69678	I	0	” replies the other ; “
69699	69752	69753	69753	I	0	” With which remark , he finishes his brief attendance , and returns to finish his dinner . The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face , and carefully examines the law - writer , who has established his pretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one . “
69763	69767	69755	69756	this person	2417	” says he . “
69790	69798	69784	69785	anybody present	2418	” glancing round upon the three bystanders . “
69804	69819	69820	69820	He	2417	” grimly answers Krook , taking the candle from the surgeon 's outstretched hand . “
69833	69834	69820	69820	He	2417	” “
69839	69844	69835	69835	He	2417	” says the surgeon , “
69872	69881	69891	69891	you	0	” taking an old teapot from Mr. Krook , “
69888	69889	69893	69893	he	2417	” “
69899	69903	69893	69893	he	2417	” asks Krook . “
69910	69911	69893	69893	he	2417	” “
69914	69928	69929	69929	I	0	” Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest . “
69965	69966	69969	69969	he	2417	” “
69979	70000	69972	69972	His	2417	” says Krook ; who might have changed eyes with his cat , as he casts his sharp glance around . “
70025	70026	70014	70014	he	2417	” “
70034	70035	70014	70014	he	2417	” “
70039	70040	70014	70014	he	2417	” “
70047	70057	70014	70014	he	2417	” says the young man , resuming his examination . “
70109	70143	70144	70144	I	0	” He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead 's edge , with his face towards that other face , and his hand upon the region of the heart . “
70171	70181	70182	70182	You	0	” he continues , looking round . Krook replies , “
70236	70403	70404	70404	I	0	” During this dialogue , Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed — from the young surgeon 's professional interest in death , noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man 's unction ; and the little crazy woman 's awe . His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes . One could not even say he has been thinking all this while . He has shown neither patience nor impatience , nor attention nor abstraction . He has shown nothing but his shell . As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case , as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case . He now interposes ; addressing the young surgeon , in his unmoved , professional way . “
70409	70413	70404	70404	I	0	” he observes , “
70477	70516	70518	70518	you	2430	” to the little crazy woman , who has often seen him in Court , and whom he has often seen , and who proposes , in frightened dumb - show , to go for the law stationer . “
70521	70582	70518	70518	you	2430	” While she is gone , the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation , and covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane . Mr. Krook and he interchange a word or two . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing ; but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau . Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily , in his grey coat and his black sleeves . “
70589	70593	70518	70518	you	2430	” he says ; “
70608	70609	70605	70605	my	0	” “
70627	70632	70611	70611	you	2430	” inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
70653	70654	70650	70650	you	2430	” “
70659	70672	70657	70657	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , coughing his apologetic cough behind his hand ; “
70690	70691	70692	70692	I	0	” “
70699	70704	70705	70705	I	0	” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
70709	70711	70705	70705	I	0	” ( “
70722	70733	70718	70718	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , with his deferential cough . ) “
70757	70758	70759	70759	I	0	” “
70765	70781	70759	70759	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , after prefacing his reply with his cough of general propitiation , “
70796	70797	70793	70793	I	0	” “
70806	70843	70799	70799	he	2438	” suggests the surgeon , to help him out . A pause . Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law - stationer . Mr. Krook , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next . “
70851	70856	70858	70859	a person	1101	” says Mr. Snagsby , “
70933	70934	70920	70920	he	2438	” “
70940	70948	70920	70920	he	2438	” says Krook , with a nod . “
70957	70964	70965	70965	he	2438	” says Mr. Snagsby , strengthened , “
71033	71056	71006	71006	her	2329	” a favorite apology for plain - speaking with Mr. Snagsby , which he always offers with a sort of argumentative frankness , “
71153	71168	71170	71170	she	2329	” proceeds Mr. Snagsby , after consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand , “
71318	71360	71363	71363	you	409	” Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed , as much as to add , ‘ I have no doubt my honorable friend would confirm , if he were in a condition to do it . ’ “
71367	71374	71363	71363	you	409	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook , “
71403	71404	71399	71399	You	409	” “
71411	71422	71407	71407	I	0	” returns the old man , with a sudden grin . “
71425	71430	71407	71407	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
71509	71510	71497	71497	he	426	” “
71524	71875	71522	71522	sir	9019	” says Snagsby . Ah , to be sure , so there is ! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have seen it before , though he is standing so close to it , and though there is very little else , Heaven knows . The marine - store merchant holds the light , and the law - stationer conducts the search . The surgeon leans against a corner of the chimney - piece ; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door . The apt old scholar of the old school , with his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees , his large black waistcoat , his long - sleeved black coat , and his wisp of limp white neck - kerchief tied in the bow the Peerage knows so well , stands in exactly the same place and attitude . There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau ; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers ' duplicates , those turnpike tickets on the road of Poverty ; there is a crumpled paper , smelling of opium , on which are scrawled rough memoranda — as , took , such a day , so many grains ; took , such another day , so many more — begun some time ago , as if with the intention of being regularly continued , but soon left off . There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers , all referring to Coroners ' Inquests ; there is nothing else . They search the cupboard , and the drawer of the ink - splashed table . There is not a morsel of an old letter , or of any other writing , in either . The young surgeon examines the dress on the law - writer . A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds . Mr. Snagsby 's suggestion is the practical suggestion after all , and the beadle must be called in . So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room . “
71883	71888	71497	71497	he	426	” says the surgeon : “
71894	71920	71497	71497	he	426	” Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him ; and she goes furtively down stairs , winding her lithe tail and licking her lips . “
71924	72060	71497	71497	he	426	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and goes home to Allegory and meditation . By this time the news has got into the court . Groups of its inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing ; and the outposts of the army of observation ( principally boys ) are pushed forward to Mr. Krook 's window , which they closely invest . A policeman has already walked up to the room , and walked down again to the door , where he stands like a tower , only condescending to see the boys at his base occasionally ; but whenever he does see them , they quail and fall back . Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper , in consequence of an unpleasantness originating in young Perkins having “
72062	72065	71522	71522	sir	9019	” young Piper “
72069	72377	72383	72383	his	2466	” renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion . The potboy at the corner , who is a privileged amateur , as possessing official knowledge of life , and having to deal with drunken men occasionally , exchanges confidential communications with the policeman , and has the appearance of an impregnable youth , unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station - houses . People talk across the court out of window , and bareheaded scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what 's the matter . The general feeling seems to be that it 's a blessing Mr. Krook warn't made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not . In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives . The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body . The policeman considers him an imbecile civilian , a remnant of the barbarous watchmentimes ; but gives him admission , as something that must be borne with until Government shall abolish him . The sensation is heightened , as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground , and has gone in . By - and - by the beadle comes out , once more intensifying the sensation , which has rather languished in the interval . He is understood to be in want of witnesses , for the Inquest to - morrow , who can tell the Coroner and Jury anything whatever respecting the deceased . Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever . Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. Green 's son “
72392	73365	72383	72383	his	2466	anybody”—which son of Mrs. Green 's appears , on inquiry , to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China , three months out , but considered accessible by telegraph , on application to the Lords of the Admiralty . Beadle goes into various shops and parlors , examining the inhabitants ; always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotey , exasperating the public . Policeman seen to smile to potboy . Public loses interest , and undergoes reaction . Taunts the beadle , in shrill youthful voices , with having boiled a boy ; choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect , and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse . Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law , and seize a vocalist ; who is released upon the flight of the rest , on condition of his getting out of this then , come ! and cutting it — a condition he immediately observes . So the sensation dies off for the time ; and the unmoved policeman ( to whom a little opium , more or less , is nothing ) , with his shining hat , stiff stock , inflexible great - coat , stout belt and bracelet , and all things fitting , pursues his lounging way with a heavy tread : beating the palms of his white gloves one against the other , and stopping now and then , at a street - corner , to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder . Under cover of the night , the feeble - minded beadle comes flitting about Chancery Lane with his summonses , in which every Juror 's name is wrongly spelt , and nothing is rightly spelt but the beadle 's own name , which nobody can read or wants to know . The summonses served , and his witnesses forewarned , the beadle goes to Mr. Krook 's , to keep a small appointment he has made with certain paupers ; who , presently arriving , are conducted up - stairs ; where they leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at , in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one — and for Every one . And , all that night , the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five - and - forty years , lies there , with no more track behind him , that any one can trace , than a deserted infant . Next day the court is all alive — is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper , says , in amicable conversation with that excellent woman . The coroner is to sit in the first - floor room at the Sol 's Arms , where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice a - week , and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional celebrity , faced by little Swills , the comic vocalist , who hopes ( according to the bill in the window ) that his friends will rally round him and support first - rate talent . The Sol 's Arms does a brisk stroke of business all the morning . Even children so require sustaining , under the general excitement , that a pieman , who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court , says his brandy - balls go off like smoke . What time the beadle , hovering between the door of Mr. Krook 's establishment and the door of the Sol 's Arms , shews the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits , and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return . At the appointed hour arrives the Coroner , for whom the Jurymen are waiting , and who is received with a salute of kittles from the good dry skittle - ground attached to the Sol 's Arms . The Coroner frequents more public - houses than any man alive . The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco - smoke , and spirits , is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes . He is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room , where he puts his hat on the piano , and takes a Windsor - chair at the head of a long table , formed of several short tables put together , and ornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions , made by pots and glasses . As many of the Jury as can crowd together at the table sit there . The rest get among the spittoons and pipes , or lean against the piano . Over the Coroner 's head is a small iron garland , the pendant handle of a bell , which rather gives the Majesty of the Court the appearance of going to be hanged presently . Call over and swear the Jury ! While the ceremony is in progress , sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a large shirt - collar , with a moist eye , and an inflamed nose , who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public , but seems familiar with the room too . A whisper circulates that this is little Swills . It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the Coroner , and make it the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evening . “
73370	73375	73368	73368	gentlemen	9023	” the Coroner begins . “
73382	73398	73380	73380	you	9023	” says the beadle . Not to the Coroner , though it might appear so . “
73403	73408	73401	73401	gentlemen	9023	” resumes the Coroner . “
73481	73482	73443	73443	your	9023	” “
73487	73613	73614	73614	Mooney	435	” cries the beadle . So they go out in a loose procession , something after the manner of a straggling funeral , and make their inspection in Mr. Krook 's back second floor , from which a few of the Jurymen retire pale and precipitately . The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons ( for whose accommodation he has provided a special little table near the Coroner , in the Harmonic Meeting Room ) , should see all that is to be seen . For they are the public chroniclers of such inquiries , by the line ; and he is not superior to the universal human infirmity , but hopes to read in print what “
73625	73727	73614	73614	Mooney	435	” said and did ; and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronisingly mentioned as the name of the Hangman is , according to the latest examples . Little Swills is waiting for the Coroner and Jury on their return . Mr. Tulkinghorn , also . Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction , and seated near the Coroner ; between that high judicial officer , a bagatelle board , and the coal - box . The inquiry proceeds . The Jury learn how the subject of their inquiry died , and learn no more about him . “
73738	73743	73728	73731	A very eminent solicitor	2472	” says the Coroner , “
73807	74447	74471	74471	you	9023	” Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins . Mrs. Piper sworn . Anastasia Piper , gentlemen . Married woman . Now , Mrs. Piper — what have you got to say about this ? Why , Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say , chiefly in parenthesis and without punctuation , but not much to tell . Mrs. Piper lives in the court ( which her husband is a cabinet - maker ) and it has long been well beknown among the neighbours ( counting from the day next but one before the half - baptising of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums ) as the Plaintive — so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased — was reported to have sold himself . Thinks it was the Plaintive 's air in which that report originated . See the Plaintive often , and considered as his air was ferocious , and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forward for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) . Has seen the Plaintive wexed and worrited by the children ( for children they will ever be and you can not expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself ) . On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pickaxe from his pocket and split Johnny 's head ( which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels ) . Never however see the Plaintive take a pickaxe or any other wepping far from it . Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time ( excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen a speaking to him frequent ) . Says the Coroner , is that boy here ? Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here . Says the Coroner , go and fetch him then . In the absence of the active and intelligent , the Coroner converses with Mr. Tulkinghorn . O ! Here 's the boy , gentlemen ! Here he is , very muddy , very hoarse , very ragged . Now , boy!—But stop a minute . Caution . This boy must be put through a few preliminary paces . Name , Jo . Nothing else that he knows on . Do n't know that everybody has two names . Never heerd of sich a think . Do n't know that Jo is short for a longer name . Thinks it long enough for him . He do n't find no fault with it . Spell it ? No . He ca n't spell it . No father , no mother , no friends . Never been to school . What 's home ? Knows a broom 's a broom , and knows it 's wicked to tell a lie . Do n't recollect who told him about the broom , or about the lie , but knows both . Ca n't exactly say what 'll be done to him arter he 's dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here , but believes it 'll be something wery bad to punish him , and serve him right — and so he 'll tell the truth . “
74455	74468	74471	74471	you	9023	” says the Coroner , with a melancholy shake of the head . “
74481	74487	74471	74471	you	9023	” asks an attentive Juryman . “
74493	74498	74471	74471	you	9023	” says the Coroner . “
74542	74780	74538	74539	the boy	9518	” Boy put aside ; to the great edification of the audience;—especially of Little Swills , the Comic Vocalist . Now . Is there any other witness ? No other witness . Very well , gentlemen ! Here 's a man unknown , proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half , found dead of too much opium . If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide , you will come to that conclusion . If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a Verdict accordingly . Verdict accordingly . Accidental death . No doubt . Gentlemen , you are discharged . Good afternoon . While the Coroner buttons his great coat , Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give private audience to the rejected witness in a corner . That graceless creature only knows that the dead man ( whom he recognised just now by his yellow face and black hair ) was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets . That one cold winter night , when he , the boy , was shivering in a doorway near his crossing , the man turned to look at him , and came back , and , having questioned him and found that he had not a friend in the world , said , “
74787	74857	74858	74858	I	0	” and gave him the price of a supper and a night 's lodging . That the man had often spoken to him since ; and asked him whether he slept sound at night , and how he bore cold and hunger , and whether he ever wished to die ; and similar strange questions . That when the man had no money , he would say in passing , “
74870	74896	74868	74868	Jo	440	” but that when he had any , he had always ( as the boy most heartily believes ) been glad to give him some . “
74904	74917	74918	74918	Wen	441	” says the boy , wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve . “
74952	74977	74942	74942	He	2489	” As he shuffles down stairs , Mr. Snagsby , lying in wait for him , puts a half - crown in his hand . “
74997	75009	74980	74980	you	2491	” says Mr. Snagsby , with his finger on his nose , “
75016	75114	74980	74980	you	2491	” For some little time the Jurymen hang about the Sol 's Arms colloquially . In the sequel , half - a - dozen are caught up in a cloud of pipe - smoke that pervades the parlor of the Sol 's Arms ; two stroll to Hampstead ; and four engage to go half - price to the play at night , and top up with oysters . Little Swills is treated on several hands . Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterises them ( his strength lying in a slangular direction ) as “
75119	75682	75684	75684	she	2495	” The landlord of the Sol 's Arms , finding Little Swills so popular , commends him highly to the Jurymen and public ; observing that , for a song in character , he do n't know his equal , and that that man 's character - wardrobe would fill a cart . Thus , gradually the Sol 's Arms melts into the shadowy night , and then flares out of it strong in gas . The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving , the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair ; is faced ( red - faced ) by Little Swills ; their friends rally round them , and support first - rate talent . In the zenith of the evening , Little Swills says , Gentlemen , if you 'll permit me , I 'll attempt a short description of a scene of real life that came off here to - day . Is much applauded and encouraged ; goes out of the room as Swills ; comes in as the Coroner ( not the least in the world like him ) ; describes the Inquest , with recreative intervals of piano - forte accompaniment to the refrain — With his ( the Coroner 's ) tippy tol li doll , tippy tol lo doll , tippy tol li doll , Dee ! The jingling piano at last is silent , and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows . Then there is rest around the lonely figure , now laid in its last earthly habitation ; and it is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night . If this forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here , by the mother at whose breast he nestled , a little child , with eyes upraised to her loving face , and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept , what an impossibility the vision would have seemed ! O , if , in brighter days , the now - extinguished fire within him ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart , where is she , while these ashes are above the ground ! It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby 's , in Cook 's Court ; where Guster murders sleep , by going , as Mr. Snagsby himself allows — not to put too fine a point upon it — out of one fit into twenty . The occasion of this seizure is , that Guster has a tender heart , and a susceptible something that possibly night have been imagination , but for Tooting and her patron saint . Be it what it may , now , it was so direfully impressed at tea - time by Mr. Snagsby 's account of the enquiry at which he had assisted , that at supper - time she projected herself into the kitchen , preceded by a flying Dutch - cheese , and fell into a fit of unusual duration : which she only came out of to go into another , and another , and so on through a chain of fits , with short intervals between , of which she has pathetically availed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not to give her warning “
75689	75755	75684	75684	she	2495	” and also in appeals to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones , and go to bed . Hence , Mr. Snagsby , at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the subject of daylight , says , drawing a long breath , though the most patient of men , “
75766	76156	75762	75762	I	0	” What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he strains himself to such an extent , or why he should thus crow ( so men crow on various triumphant public occasions , however ) about what can not be of any moment to him , is his affair . It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes . Then the active and intelligent , who has got into the morning papers as such , comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook 's , and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed , to a hemmed - in churchyard , pestiferous and obscene , whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed ; while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official backstairs — would to Heaven they had departed!—are very complacent and agreeable . Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage abomination , and a Caffre would shudder at , they bring our dear brother here departed , to receive Christian burial . With houses looking on , on every side , save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate — with every villainy of life in action close on death , and every poisonous element of death in action close on life — here , they lower our dear brother down a foot or two : here , sow him in corruption , to be raised in corruption : an avenging ghost at many a sick - bedside : a shameful testimony to future ages , how civilisation and barbarism walked this boastful island together . Come night , come darkness , for you can not come too soon , or stay too long , by such a place as this ! Come , straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses ; and you who do iniquity therein , do it at least with this dread scene shut out ! Come , flame of gas , burning so sullenly above the iron gate , on which the poisoned air deposits its witch - ointment slimy to the touch ! It is well that you should call to every passer - by , “
76160	76265	75762	75762	I	0	” With the night , comes a slouching figure through the tunnel - court , to the outside of the iron gate . It holds the gate with its hands , and looks in between the bars ; stands looking in , for a little while . It then , with an old broom it carries , softly sweeps the step , and makes the archway clean . It does so , very busily and trimly ; looks in again , a little while ; and so departs . Jo , is it thou ? Well , well ! Though a rejected witness , who “
76270	76308	76309	76309	He	2496	” what will be done to him in greater hands than men 's , thou art not quite in outer darkness . There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this : “
76319	77181	76309	76309	He	2496	” IT has left off raining down in Lincolnshire , at last , and Chesney Wold has taken heart . Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares , for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris . The fashionable intelligence has found it out , and communicates the glad tidings to benighted England . It has also found out , that they will entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the élite of the beau monde ( the fashionable intelligence is weak in English , but a giant - refreshed in French ) , at the ancient and hospitable family seat in Lincolnshire . For the greater honor of the brilliant and distinguished circle , and of Chesney Wold into the bargain , the broken arch of the bridge in the park is mended ; and the water , now retired within its proper limits and again spanned gracefully , makes a figure in the prospect from the house . The clear cold sunshine glances into the brittle woods , and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves and drying the moss . It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day . It looks in at the windows , and touches the ancestral portraits with bars and patches of brightness , never contemplated by the painters . Athwart the picture of my Lady , over the great chimney - piece , it throws a broad bend - sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the hearth , and seems to rend it . Through the same cold sunshine , and the same sharp wind , my Lady and Sir Leicester , in their travelling chariot , ( my Lady 's woman , and Sir Leicester 's man affectionate in the rumble , ) start for home . With a considerable amount of jingling and whip - cracking , and many plunging demonstrations on the part of two bare - backed horses , and two Centaurs with glazed hats , jack - boots , and flowing manes and tails , they rattle out of the yard of the Hôtel Bristol in the Place Vendôme , and canter between the sun - and - shadow - chequered colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli and the garden of the ill - fated palace of a headless king and queen , off by the Place of Concord , and the Elysian Fields , and the Gate of the Star , out of Paris . Sooth to say , they can not go away too fast ; for , even here , my Lady Dedlock has been bored to death . Concert , assembly , opera , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady , under the worn - out heavens . Only last Sunday , when poor wretches were gay — within the walls , playing with children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace Garden ; walking , a score abreast , in the Elysian Fields , made more Elysian by performing dogs and wooden horses ; between whiles filtering ( a few ) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady , to say a word or two at the base of a pillar , within flare of a rusty little gridiron - full of gusty little tapers — without the walls , encompassing Paris with dancing , love - making , wine - drinking , tobacco - smoking , tomb - visiting , billiard card and domino playing , quack - doctoring , and much murderous refuse , animate and inanimate — only last Sunday , my Lady , in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair , almost hated her own maid for being in spirits . She can not , therefore , go too fast from Paris . Weariness of soul lies before her , as it lies behind — her Ariel has put a girdle of it round the whole earth , and it can not be unclasped — but the imperfect remedy is always to fly , from the last place where it has been experienced . Fling Paris back into the distance , then , exchanging it for endless avenues and cross - avenues of wintry trees ! And , when next beheld , let it be some leagues away , with the Gate of the Star a white speck glittering in the sun , and the city a mere mound in a plain : two dark square towers rising out of it , and light and shadow descending on it aslant , like the angels in Jacob 's dream ! Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored . When he has nothing else to do , he can always contemplate his own greatness . It is a considerable advantage to a man , to have so inexhaustible a subject . After reading his letters , he leans back in his corner of the carriage , and generally reviews his importance to society . “
77192	77217	76309	76309	He	2496	” says my Lady , after a long time . She is fatigued with reading . Has almost read a page in twenty miles . “
77227	77228	76309	76309	He	2496	” “
77242	77243	77239	77239	I	0	” “
77248	77256	77244	77244	You	2497	” says Sir Leicester , with admiration . “
77259	77264	77265	77265	He	293	” sighs my Lady . “
77273	77274	77275	77275	He	293	” “
77287	77300	77284	77284	he	293	” says Sir Leicester , selecting the letter , and unfolding it , “
77336	77361	77362	77362	He	293	” Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye - glass and adjusting it , that my Lady looks a little irritated . “
77474	77487	77468	77468	I	0	” My Lady , leaning forward , looks out for her window . “
77493	77498	77468	77468	I	0	” observes Sir Leicester . “
77507	77519	77499	77499	I	0	” says my Lady , still looking out of her window . “
77522	77533	77534	77534	I	0	” repeats Sir Leicester , in a tone of surprise . “
77542	77551	77534	77534	I	0	” says my Lady , with unmistakeable distinctness . “
77558	78164	77534	77534	I	0	” The carriage is stopped , the affectionate man alights from the rumble , opens the door , and lets down the steps , obedient to an impatient motion of my Lady 's hand . My Lady alights so quickly , and walks away so quickly , that Sir Leicester , for all his scrupulous politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind . A space of a minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her . She smiles , looks very handsome , takes his arm , lounges with him for a quarter of a mile , is very much bored , and resumes her seat in the carriage . The rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three days , with more or less of bell - jingling and whip - cracking , and more or less plunging of Centaurs and bare - backed horses . Their courtly politeness to each other , at the Hotels where they tarry , is the theme of general admiration . Though my Lord is a little aged for my Lady , says Madame , the hostess of the Golden Ape , and though he might be her amiable father , one can see at a glance that they love each other . One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage . One observes my Lady , how recognisant of my Lord 's politeness , with an inclination of her gracious head , and the concession of her so - genteel fingers ! It is ravishing ! The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry . It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester , whose countenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage - cheese , and in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution . It is the Radical of Nature to him . Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it , after stopping to refit ; and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney Wold , lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire . Through the same cold sunlight — colder as the day declines,—and through the same sharp wind — sharper as the separate shadows of bare trees gloom together in the woods , and as the Ghost 's Walk , touched at the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky , resigns itself to coming night,—they drive into the park . The Rooks , swinging in their lofty houses in the elm - tree avenue , seem to discuss the question of the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath ; some agreeing that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down ; some arguing with malcontents who wo n't admit it , now , all consenting to consider the question disposed of ; now , all breaking out again in violent debate , incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird , who will persist in putting in a last contradictory croak . Leaving them to swing and caw , the travelling chariot rolls on to the house ; where fires gleam warmly through some of the windows , though not through so many as to give an inhabited expression to the darkening mass of front . But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that . Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance , and receives Sir Leicester 's customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsey . “
78180	78181	78182	78182	I	0	” “
78198	78199	78195	78196	Sir Leicester	290	” “
78207	78208	78204	78205	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	” “
78216	78282	78209	78210	My Lady	996	” says Mrs. Rouncewell , with another curtsey . My Lady signifies , without profuse expenditure of words , that she is as wearily well as she can hope to be . But Rosa is in the distance , behind the housekeeper ; and my Lady , who has not subdued the quickness of her observation , whatever else she may have conquered , asks : “
78288	78289	78285	78286	that girl	2505	” “
78301	78302	78299	78299	Rosa	370	” “
78308	78321	78306	78306	Rosa	370	” Lady Dedlock beckons her , with even an appearance of interest . “
78334	78353	78325	78325	you	370	” she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers . Rosa , very much abashed , says “
78363	78386	78325	78325	you	370	” and glances up , and glances down , and do n't know where to look , but looks all the prettier . “
78392	78393	78390	78390	you	370	” “
78399	78400	78390	78390	you	370	” “
78403	78410	78413	78413	they	2511	” repeats my Lady , thoughtfully . “
78421	78422	78413	78413	they	2511	” “
78428	78628	78425	78426	my Lady	996	” My Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers , and goes on to the foot of the oak staircase , where Sir Leicester pauses for her as her knightly escort . A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n't know what to make of it — which was probably his general state of mind in the days of Queen Elizabeth . That evening , in the housekeeper 's room , Rosa can do nothing but murmur Lady Dedlock 's praises . She is so affable , so graceful , so beautiful , so elegant ; has such a sweet voice , and such a thrilling touch , that Rosa can feel it yet ! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability . Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that . Heaven forbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of that excellent family ; above all , of my Lady , whom the whole world admires ; but if my Lady would only be “
78634	78651	78425	78426	my Lady	996	” not quite so cold and distant , Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more affable . “
78658	78664	78425	78426	my Lady	996	” Mrs. Rouncewell adds — only “
78667	78694	78425	78426	my Lady	996	” because it borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs ; “
78733	78734	78721	78721	she	996	” “
78747	78767	78740	78740	her	996	” says Watt ; who has been home and come back again , he is such a good grandson . “
78775	78782	78740	78740	her	996	” returns the housekeeper with dignity , “
78808	78809	78810	78810	I	0	” “
78826	78827	78818	78818	she	996	” “

78851	78855	78861	78861	they	2521	” says Watt , “
78890	78891	78892	78893	Sir Leicester	290	” “
78908	78909	78910	78911	Sir Leicester	290	” “
78920	78924	78910	78911	Sir Leicester	290	” says Watt ; “
78974	78975	78983	78983	child	9043	” “

79016	79369	79002	79002	I	0	” He happens to glance at Rosa , who looks down , and is very shy , indeed . But , according to the old superstition , it should be Rosa 's ears that burn , and not her fresh bright cheeks ; for my Lady 's maid is holding forth about her at this moment , with surpassing energy . My Lady 's maid is a Frenchwoman of two - and - thirty , from somewhere in the Southern country about Avignon and Marseilles — a large - eyed brown woman with black hair ; who would be handsome , but for a certain feline mouth , and general uncomfortable tightness of face , rendering the jaws too eager , and the skull too prominent . There is something indefinably keen and wan about her anatomy ; and she has a watchful way of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her head , which could be pleasantly dispensed with — especially when she is in an ill - humour and near knives . Through all the good taste of her dress and little adornments , these objections so express themselves , that she seems to go about like a very neat She - Wolf imperfectly tamed . Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post , she is almost an English - woman in her acquaintance with the language — consequently , she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady 's attention ; and she pours them out with such grim ridicule as she sits at dinner , that her companion , the affectionate man , is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon stage of that performance . Ha , ha , ha ! She , Hortense , been in my Lady 's service since five years , and always kept at the distance , and this doll , this puppet caressed — absolutely caressed — by my Lady on the moment of her arriving at the house ! Ha , ha ! ha ! “
79378	79383	79002	79002	I	0	child?”—“No , my Lady . ”—You
79388	81194	79002	79002	I	0	“ And how old are you , child ? And take care they do not spoil you by flattery , child ! O how droll ! It is the best thing altogether . In short , it is such an admirable thing , that Mademoiselle Hortens ca n't forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke — an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look : which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady 's mirrors , when my Lady is not among them . All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now : many of them after a long blank . They reflect handsome faces , simpering faces , youthful faces , faces of threescore - and - ten that will not submit to be old ; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty hunter before the Lord , hunts with a keen scent , from their breaking cover at the Court of Saint James 's to their being run down to Death . The place in Lincolnshire is all alive . By day , guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods , horsemen and carriages enliven the parkroads , servants and hangers - on pervade the Village and the Dedlock Arms . Seen by night , from distant openings in the trees , the row of windows in the long drawing - room , where my Lady 's picture hangs over the great chimney - piece , is like a row of jewels set in a black frame . On Sunday , the chill little church is almost warmed by so much gallant company , and the general flavor of the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes . The brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it , no contracted amount of education , sense , courage , honor , beauty , and virtue . Yet there is something a little wrong about it , in despite of its immense advantages . What can it be ? Dandyism ? There is no King George the Fourth now ( more 's the pity ! ) to set the dandy fashion ; there are no clear - starched jack - towel neckcloths , no short - waisted coats , no false calves , no stays . There are no caricatures , now , of effeminate Exquisites so arrayed , swooning in opera boxes with excess of delight , and being revived by other dainty creatures , poking long - necked scent - bottles at their noses . There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into his buckskins , or who goes to see all the Executions , or who is troubled with the self - reproach of having once consumed a pea . But is there Dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle notwithstanding , Dandyism of a more mischievous sort , that has got below the surface and is doing less harmless things than jack - towelling itself and stopping its own digestion , to which no rational person need particularly object ? Why , yes . It can not be disguised . There are , at Chesney Wold this January week , some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion , who have set up a Dandyism — in Religion , for instance . Who , in mere lackadaisical want of an emotion , have agreed upon a little dandy talk about the Vulgar wanting faith in things in general ; meaning , in the things that have been tried and found wanting , as though a low fellow should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling , after finding it out ! Who would make the Vulgar very picturesque and faithful , by putting back the hands upon the Clock of Time , and cancelling a few hundred years of history . There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion , not so new , but very elegant , who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world , and to keep down all its realities . For whom everything must be languid and pretty . Who have found out the perpetual stoppage . Who are to rejoice at nothing , and be sorry for nothing . Who are not to be disturbed by ideas . On whom even the Fine Arts , attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain , must array themselves in the milliners ' and tailors ' patterns of past generations , and be particularly careful not to be in earnest , or to receive any impress from the moving age . Then there is my Lord Boodle , of considerable reputation with his party , who has known what office is , and who tells Sir Leicester Dedlock with much gravity , after dinner , that he really does not see to what the present age is tending . A debate is not what a debate used to be ; the House is not what the House used to be ; even a Cabinet is not what it formerly was . He perceives with astonishment , that supposing the present Government to be overthrown , the limited choice of the Crown , in the formation of a new Ministry , would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle — supposing it to be impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with Hoodle . Then , giving the Home Department and the Leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle , the Exchequer to Koodle , the Colonies to Loodle , and the Foreign Office to Moodle , what are you to do with Noodle ? You ca n't offer him the Presidency of the Council ; that is reserved for Poodle . You ca n't put him in the Woods and Forests ; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle . What follows ? That the country is shipwrecked , lost , and gone to pieces ( as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock ) , because you ca n't provide for Noodle ! On the other hand , the Right Honorable William Buffy , M.P. , contends across the table with some one else , that the shipwreck of the country — about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question — is attributable to Cuffy . If you had done with Cuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament , and had prevented him from going over to Duffy , you would have got him into alliance with Fuffy , you would have had with you the weight attaching as a smart debater to Guffy , you would have brought to bear upon the elections the wealth of Huffy , you would have got in for three counties Juffy , Kuffy , and Luffy ; and you would have strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the business habits of Muffy . All this , instead of being , as you now are , dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy ! As to this point , and as to some minor topics , there are differences of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but Boodle and his retinue , and Buffy and his retinue . These are the great actors for whom the stage is reserved . A People there are , no doubt — a certain large number of supernumeraries , who are to be occasionally addressed , and relied upon for shouts and choruses , as on the theatrical stage ; but Boodle and Buffy , their followers and families , their heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns , are the born first - actors , managers , and leaders , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever . In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run . For it is , even with the stillest and politest circles , as with the circle the necromancer draws around him — very strange appearances may be seen in active motion outside . With this difference ; that , being realities and not phantoms , there is the greater danger of their breaking in . Chesney Wold is quite full , anyhow ; so full , that a burning sense of injury arises in the breasts of ill - lodged ladies ' maids , and is not to be extinguished . Only one room is empty . It is a turret chamber of the third order of merit , plainly but comfortably furnished , and having an old - fashioned business air . It is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's room , and is never bestowed on anybody else , for he may come at any time . He is not come yet . It is his quiet habit to walk across the park from the village , in fine weather ; to drop into this room , as if he had never been out of it since he was last seen there ; to request a servant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived , in case he should be wanted ; and to appear ten minutes before dinner , in the shadow of the library door . He sleeps in his turret , with a complaining flag - staff over his head ; and has some leads outside , on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook . Every day before dinner , my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the library , but he is not there . Every day at dinner , my Lady glances down the table for the vacant place , that would be waiting to receive him if he had just arrived ; but there is no vacant place . Every night , my Lady casually asks her maid : “
81200	81207	81196	81197	Mr Tulkinghorn	293	” Every night the answer is , “
81216	81259	79002	79002	I	0	” One night , while having her hair undressed , my Lady loses herself in deep thought after this reply , until she sees her own brooding face in the opposite glass , and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her . “
81267	81279	81210	81211	my Lady	996	” says my Lady then , addressing the reflection of Hortense , “
81293	81294	81284	81284	You	293	” “
81304	81305	81299	81300	your Ladyship	2534	” “
81308	81313	81299	81300	your Ladyship	2534	” says my Lady , “
81321	81477	81314	81314	you	293	” At length , one afternoon a little before sunset , when the bright groups of figures , which have for the last hour or two enlivened the Ghost 's Walk , are all dispersed , and only Sir Leicester and my Lady remain upon the terrace , Mr. Tulkinghorn appears . He comes towards them at his usual methodical pace , which is never quickened , never slackened . He wears his usual expressionless mask — if it be a mask — and carries family secrets in every limb of his body , and every crease of his dress . Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great , or whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells , is his personal secret . He keeps it , as he keeps the secrets of his clients ; he is his own client in that matter , and will never betray himself . “
81486	81547	81480	81480	you	2535	” says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand . Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well . Sir Leicester is quite well . My Lady is quite well . All highly satisfactory . The lawyer , with his hands behind him , walks , at Sir Leicester 's side , along the terrace . My Lady walks upon the other side . “
81553	81568	81569	81570	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” says Sir Leicester . A gracious observation . As much as to say , “
81605	81623	81590	81590	We	2536	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , comprehending it , inclines his head , and says he is much obliged . “
81631	81635	81624	81624	I	0	” he explains , “
81655	81656	81657	81665	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2538	” “
81667	81675	81657	81665	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2538	” observes Sir Leicester , with severity . “
81694	81695	81696	81696	He	2538	” “
81700	81705	81696	81696	He	2538	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
81717	81728	81729	81729	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , looking most profoundly obstinate himself . “
81739	81740	81729	81729	I	0	” “
81746	81751	81696	81696	He	2538	” pursues the lawyer , “
81759	81760	81773	81773	I	0	” “
81765	81770	81773	81773	I	0	” replies Sir Leicester . “
81777	81778	81779	81779	I	0	” “
81805	81806	81807	81808	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” “
81810	81815	81807	81808	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” returns Sir Leicester , “
81880	81888	81889	81889	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again . “
81895	81899	81889	81889	I	0	” he says . “
81911	81912	81900	81901	Mr. Boythorn	403	” “
81925	81931	81922	81923	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” Sir Leicester interrupts him , “
81974	81985	81922	81923	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” adds Sir Leicester , after a moment 's pause , “
81995	82028	81936	81943	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2545	” Sir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden , in passing this capital sentence ; as if it were the next satisfactory thing to having the sentence executed . “
82035	82039	81936	81943	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2545	” says he , “
82055	82075	82076	82076	You	293	” As they turn towards the hall - door , Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. Tulkinghorn for the first time . “
82136	82137	82138	82138	You	293	” “
82142	82147	82138	82138	You	293	” Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats . “
82151	82158	82138	82138	You	293	” returns my Lady , carelessly . “
82188	82189	82169	82169	you	293	” “
82192	82193	82169	82169	you	293	” “
82198	82329	82169	82169	you	293	” They pass into a sombre breakfast - room on the ground - floor , lighted in the day by two deep windows . It is now twilight . The fire glows brightly on the panelled wall , and palely on the window - glass , where , through the cold reflection of the blaze , the colder landscape shudders in the wind , and a grey mist creeps along : the only traveller besides the waste of clouds . My Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney - corner , and Sir Leicester takes another great chair opposite . The lawyer stands before the fire , with his hand out at arm 's length , shading his face . He looks across his arm at my Lady . “
82332	82336	82337	82337	I	0	” he says , “
82358	82359	82354	82354	I	0	” “
82377	82383	82384	82384	I	0	” Lady Dedlock languidly anticipates . “
82389	82390	82386	82386	him	1653	” “
82395	82418	82419	82419	I	0	” remonstrated Sir Leicester . Not so much shocked by the fact , as by the fact of the fact being mentioned . “
82440	82441	82435	82435	I	0	” “
82450	82455	82447	82448	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” observes Sir Leicester . “
82462	82463	82456	82456	I	0	” “
82476	82485	82470	82470	me	0	” ( it is my Lady speaking ) . “
82500	82514	82517	82517	his	1653	” Mr. Tulkinghorn re - asserts it by another inclination of his head . “
82521	82522	82517	82517	his	1653	” “
82527	82532	82517	82517	his	1653	” cries Sir Leicester . “
82535	82536	82559	82559	I	0	” “
82544	82549	82539	82539	me	0	” says my Lady . “
82563	82564	82559	82559	I	0	” “
82578	82607	82608	82608	I	0	” Sir Leicester 's gallantry concedes the point ; though he still feels that to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is really — really — “
82614	82623	82608	82608	I	0	” resumes the lawyer , with undisturbed calmness , “
82695	82696	82689	82689	he	1653	” “
82703	82708	82689	82689	he	1653	” my Lady asks , “
82714	82715	82689	82689	he	1653	” “
82721	82730	82689	82689	he	1653	” returns the lawyer , shaking his head . “
82786	82787	82790	82790	they	10142	” “
82796	82797	82798	82798	They	10142	” “
82814	82815	82798	82798	They	10142	” “
82826	82827	82798	82798	They	10142	” “
82847	82848	82845	82845	him	1653	” “
82856	82857	82845	82845	him	1653	” “
82864	82871	82798	82798	They	10142	” says the lawyer , meditatively , “
82885	83018	82798	82798	They	10142	” During the utterance of every word of this short dialogue , Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn , without any other alteration in their customary deportment , have looked very steadily at one another — as was natural , perhaps , in the discussion of so unusual a subject . Sir Leicester has looked at the fire , with the general expression of the Dedlock on the staircase . The story being told , he renews his stately protest , saying , that as it is quite clear that no association in my Lady 's mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch ( unless he was a begging - letter writer ) , he trusts to hear no more about a subject so far removed from my Lady 's station . “
83026	83038	82798	82798	They	10142	” says my Lady , gathering up her mantles and furs ; “
83061	83412	83051	83052	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference , and holds it open while she passes out . She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner , and insolent grace . They meet again at dinner — again , next day — again , for many days in succession . Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted deity , surrounded by worshippers , and terribly liable to be bored to death , even while presiding at her own shrine . Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble confidences : so oddly out of place , and yet so perfectly at home . They appear to take as little note of one another , as any two people , enclosed within the same walls , could . But , whether each evermore watches and suspects the other , evermore mistrustful of some great reservation ; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other , and never to be taken unawares ; what each would give to know how much the other knows — all this is hidden , for the time , in their own hearts . WE held many consultations about what Richard was to be ; first , without Mr. Jarndyce , as he had requested , and afterwards with him ; but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress . Richard said he was ready for anything . When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy , Richard said he had thought of that , and perhaps he was . When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army , Richard said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea . When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself , whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination , or a strong impulse , Richard answered , Well , he really had tried very often , and he could n't make out . “
83421	83427	83051	83052	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” Mr. Jarndyce said to me “
83563	83839	83840	83840	I	0	” I felt this to be true ; though , if I may venture to mention what I thought besides , I thought it much to be regretted that Richard 's education had not counteracted those influences , or directed his character . He had been eight years at a public school , and had learnt , I understood , to make Latin Verses of several sorts , in the most admirable manner . But I never heard that it had been anybody 's business to find out what his natural bent was , or where his failings lay , or to adapt any kind of knowledge to him . He had been adapted to the Verses , and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection , that if he had remained at school until he was of age , I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again , unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it . Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much . To be sure , I knew nothing of the subject , and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to the same extent — or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did . “
83847	83853	83907	83907	sir	9019	” said Richard , musing , “
83883	83884	83885	83885	You	0	” “
83895	83900	83885	83885	You	0	” suggested Mr. Jarndyce . “
83909	83913	83907	83907	sir	9019	” replied Richard . “
83936	83937	83938	83938	Surgeon	474	” “
83940	83945	83938	83938	Surgeon	474	” suggested Mr. Jarndyce . “
83953	83969	83951	83951	sir	9019	” cried Richard . I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before . “
83977	83986	83975	83975	sir	9019	” repeated Richard , with the greatest enthusiasm . “
83996	84173	83938	83938	Surgeon	474	” He was not to be laughed out of it , though he laughed at it heartily . He said he had chosen his profession , and the more he thought of it , the more he felt that his destiny was clear ; the art of healing was the art of all others for him . Mistrusting that he only came to this conclusion , because having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was fitted for , and having never been guided to the discovery , he was taken by the newest idea , and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration , I wondered whether the Latin Verses often ended in this , or whether Richard 's was a solitary case . Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him , seriously , and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter . Richard was a little grave after these interviews ; but invariably told Ada and me “
84180	84190	83938	83938	Surgeon	474	” and then began to talk about something else . “
84194	84221	83938	83938	Surgeon	474	” cried Mr. Boythorn , who interested himself strongly in the subject — though I need not say that , for he could do nothing weakly ; “
84285	84290	84294	84295	Surgeons aboard	2583	” cried Mr. Boythorn , “
84351	84352	84355	84355	you	0	” “
84361	84366	84355	84355	you	0	” asked Mr. Jarndyce . “
84369	84376	84355	84355	you	0	” cried Mr. Boythorn , firmly . “
84559	84657	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile , and suddenly thundering , Ha , ha , ha ! over and over again , until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion . As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice , after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce , and had expired ; and as he still continued to assure Ada and me , in the same final manner , that it was “
84661	84726	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council . Mr. Kenge , therefore , came down to dinner one day , and leaned back in his chair , and turned his eye - glasses over and over , and spoke in a sonorous voice , and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl . “
84729	84734	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84752	84753	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
84766	84777	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” observed my Guardian , with a glance at Richard . “
84783	84788	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84791	84792	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
84811	84816	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
84832	84833	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
84836	84841	84744	84745	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84921	84922	84923	84923	You	2600	” “
84929	84940	84923	84923	You	2600	” said Richard , in his off - hand manner , “
84953	84954	84942	84942	I	0	” “
84961	84971	84958	84959	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” said Mr. Kenge , gently nodding his head . “
84995	85004	85005	85005	I	0	” nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions ; “
85053	85054	85055	85056	No one	852	” “
85063	85068	85058	85058	Rick	350	” said my Guardian . “
85074	85078	85069	85070	No one	852	” said Richard , “
85082	85087	85069	85070	No one	852	” observed Mr. Kenge . “
85103	85104	85069	85070	No one	852	” “
85109	85113	85069	85070	No one	852	” said Richard . “
85117	85123	85124	85124	I	0	” observed Mr. Kenge again . “
85131	85135	85124	85124	I	0	” said Richard ; “
85145	85146	85137	85137	I	0	” “
85153	85158	85137	85137	I	0	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
85291	85305	85264	85264	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge , with a tinge of melancholy in his smile , “
85367	86364	85364	85364	he	2609	” As this was an opening in the prospect , it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin . And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks , it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once , and combine Richard 's business with it . Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week , we took up our abode at a cheerful lodging near Oxford Street , over an upholsterer 's shop . London was a great wonder to us , and we were out for hours and hours at a time , seeing the sights ; which appeared to be less capable of exhaustion than we were . We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing . I mention this , because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again , by Mr. Guppy . I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada ; and Richard was in the place he liked best , behind Ada 's chair ; when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw Mr. Guppy , with his hair flattened down upon his head , and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me . I felt , all through the performance , that he never looked at the actors , but constantly looked at me , and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection . It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night , because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous . But , from that time forth , we never went to the play , without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit — always with his hair straight and flat , his shirt - collar turned down , and a general feebleness about him . If he were not there when we went in , and I began to hope he would not come , and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene , I was certain to encounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it , and , from that time , to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening . I really can not express how uneasy this made me . If he would only have brushed up his hair , or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me , and always in that demonstrative state of despondency , put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak . I seemed able to do nothing naturally . As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box , I could not bear to do that ; because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them , and that they could never have talked together so happily if any body else had been in my place . So there I sat , not knowing where to look — for wherever I looked , I knew Mr. Guppy 's eyes were following me — and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself , on my account . Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce . Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation , and that I might ruin him . Sometimes , I thought of confiding in Richard ; but was deterred by the possibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy , and giving him black eyes . Sometimes , I thought , should I frown at him , or shake my head . Then I felt I could not do it . Sometimes , I considered whether I should write to his mother , but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would be to make the matter worse . I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing . Mr. Guppy 's perseverance , all this time , not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went , but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out , and even to get up behind our fly — where I am sure I saw him , two or three times , struggling among the most dreadful spikes . After we got home , he haunted a post opposite our house . The upholsterer 's where we lodged , being at the corner of two streets , and my bedroom window being opposite the post , I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs , lest I should see him ( as I did one moonlight night ) leaning against the post , and evidently catching cold . If Mr. Guppy had not been , fortunately for me , engaged in the day - time , I really should have had no rest from him . While we were making this round of gaieties in which Mr. Guppy so extraordinarily participated , the business which had helped to bring us to town was not neglected . Mr. Kenge 's cousin was a Mr. Bayham Badger , who had a good practice at Chelsea , and attended a large public Institution besides . He was quite willing to receive Richard into his house , and to superintend his studies ; and as it seemed that those could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger 's roof , and as Mr. Badger liked Richard , and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger “
86368	86418	86686	86687	Miss Summerson	305	” an agreement was made , the Lord Chancellor 's consent was obtained , and it was all settled . On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr. Badger , we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger 's house . We were to be “
86424	86645	86646	86646	You	2612	” Mrs. Badger 's note said ; and we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself . She was surrounded in the drawing - room by various objects , indicative of her painting a little , playing the piano a little , playing the guitar a little , playing the harp a little , singing a little , working a little , reading a little , writing poetry a little , and botanising a little . She was a lady of about fifty , I should think , youthfully dressed , and of a very fine complexion . If I add , to the little list of her accomplishments , that she rouged a little , I do not mean that there was any harm in it . Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink , fresh - faced , crisp - looking gentleman , with a weak voice , white teeth , light hair , and surprised eyes : some years younger , I should say , than Mrs. Bayham Badger . He admired her exceedingly , but principally , and to begin with , on the curious ground ( as it seemed to us ) of her having had three husbands . We had barely taken our seats , when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite triumphantly , “
86659	86660	86653	86655	Mrs. Bayham Badger	476	” “
86663	86668	86669	86669	Her	476	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
86672	86677	86669	86669	Her	476	” said Mr. Badger . “
86699	86702	86686	86687	Miss Summerson	305	” I said “
86707	86708	86686	86687	Miss Summerson	305	” “
86714	86725	86726	86739	Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy , who was Mrs. Badger 's first husband	2615	” said Mr. Badger , in a tone of confidence . “
86764	86773	86751	86752	Professor Dingo	477	” Mrs. Badger overheard him , and smiled . “
86779	86787	86751	86752	Professor Dingo	477	” Mr. Badger replied to the smile , “
86825	86826	86812	86812	they	2614	” “
86832	86837	86827	86827	I	0	” said Mrs. Badger , “
86880	86882	86877	86878	Professor Dingo	477	” ( “
86887	86897	86877	86878	Professor Dingo	477	” added Mr. Badger in an under tone . ) “
86907	86912	86877	86878	Professor Dingo	477	” pursued Mrs. Badger , “
86932	86933	86924	86924	I	0	” “
86952	86962	86948	86950	highly distinguished men	2627	” said Mr. Badger , summing up the facts ; “
86981	86988	87012	87014	three distinguished men	2628	” We all expressed our admiration . “
86996	87001	86991	86992	Mr. Badger	475	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
87016	87017	87002	87002	I	0	” “
87030	87035	87025	87025	I	0	” observed Mrs. Badger . “
87041	87046	87049	87049	I	0	” said Mr. Badger , “
87092	87100	87082	87082	I	0	” said Mr. Badger to us generally , “
87135	87151	87127	87127	you	9060	” continued Mr. Bayham Badger , leading the way into the next drawing - room , “
87202	87206	87182	87183	Mrs. Badger	476	” We all echoed “
87212	87213	87214	87214	I	0	” “
87222	87227	87214	87214	I	0	” said Mr. Badger , “
87320	87381	87382	87382	Water	481	” Dinner was now announced , and we went down stairs . It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served . But the Captain and the Professor still ran in Mr. Badger 's head , and , as Ada and I had the honour of being under his particular care , we had the full benefit of them . “
87406	87419	87404	87404	James	450	” Ada very much admired some artificial flowers , under a glass . “
87425	87430	87431	87431	They	2639	” said Mr. Badger . “
87445	87457	87435	87437	Mrs. Bayham Badger	476	” He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret . “
87462	87466	87468	87468	me	0	” he said . “
87563	87651	87652	87655	The dear old Crippler	2644	” After dinner , when we ladies retired , we took Mrs. Badger 's first and second husband with us . Mrs. Badger gave us , in the drawing - room , a Biographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser before his marriage , and a more minute account of him dating from the time when he fell in love with her , at a ball on board the Crippler , given to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbor . “
87657	87666	87652	87655	The dear old Crippler	2644	” said Mrs. Badger , shaking her head . “
87800	87815	87792	87792	his	478	” Mrs. Badger shook her head , sighed , and looked in the glass . “
87828	87837	87838	87838	I	0	” she resumed , with a plaintive smile . “
87923	88023	87913	87914	Mr. Badger	475	” We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo , both of whom seemed to have had very bad complaints . In the course of it , Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never madly loved but once ; and that the object of that wild affection , never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm , was Captain Swosser . The Professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner , and Mrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying , with great difficulty , “
88037	88150	88029	88029	Laura	482	” when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb . Now , I observed that evening , as I had observed for some days past , that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other 's society ; which was but natural , seeing that they were going to be separated so soon . I was therefore not very much surprised , when we got home , and Ada and I retired upstairs , to find Ada more silent than usual ; though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms , and beginning to speak to me , with her face hidden . “
88155	88159	88029	88029	Laura	482	” murmured Ada . “
88169	88181	88160	88160	I	0	” A mighty secret , my pretty one , no doubt ! “
88188	88189	88186	88186	Ada	319	” “
88198	88199	88193	88193	you	305	” “
88206	88209	88193	88193	you	305	” said I. “
88221	88236	88193	88193	you	305	” cried Ada , very much startled by the idea of my doing so . “
88247	88255	88193	88193	you	305	” said I , pretending to consider . “
88260	88268	88193	88193	you	305	” said Ada , in a whisper . “
88277	88278	88275	88275	Richard	320	” “
88284	88300	88275	88275	Richard	320	” said I , kissing her bright hair , which was all I could see . “
88306	88307	88304	88304	him	9177	” “
88317	88370	88371	88371	He	9177	” It was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way , hiding her face ; and to know that she was not crying in sorrow , but in a little glow of joy , and pride , and hope ; that I would not help her just yet . “
88391	88398	88388	88388	he	9177	” with a burst of tears , “
88407	88408	88410	88410	he	9177	” “
88413	88416	88410	88410	he	9177	” said I. “
88444	88480	88432	88432	I	0	” To see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise , and hold me round the neck , and laugh , and cry , and blush , and laugh , was so pleasant ! “
88486	88490	88432	88432	I	0	” said I , “
88521	88522	88502	88502	Richard	320	” “
88533	88540	88525	88525	you	0	” cried Ada , kissing me . “
88546	88549	88525	88525	you	0	” said I. “
88556	88557	88525	88525	you	0	” “
88577	88615	88575	88575	you	305	” returned Ada . She might have coaxed me to say No , if I had been the hardest - hearted Duenna in the world . Not being that yet , I said No , very freely . “
88619	88623	88624	88624	I	0	” said I , “
88631	88632	88624	88624	I	0	” “
88647	88665	88644	88644	Esther	305	” cried Ada , holding me tighter , and laying down her face again upon my breast . “
88668	88671	88644	88644	Esther	305	” said I. “
88676	88677	88644	88644	Esther	305	” “
88684	88692	88644	88644	Esther	305	” said Ada , shaking her head . “
88702	88723	88726	88726	I	0	” I was beginning in joke . But Ada , looking up , and smiling through her tears , cried , “
88737	88743	88732	88732	you	0	” and then sobbed out , “
88759	88821	88757	88757	Esther	305	” I told her , laughing , why I had known that , too , just as well as I had known the other ! And we sat before the fire , and I had all the talking to myself for a little while ( though there was not much of it ) ; and Ada was soon quiet and happy . “
88834	88838	88823	88823	you	0	” she asked . “
88849	88853	88842	88842	John	352	” said I , “
88869	88870	88859	88859	John	352	” “
88881	88887	88889	88889	we	2665	” said Ada , timidly , “
88915	88916	88912	88913	Dame Durden	388	” “
88929	88932	88924	88924	he	352	” said I. “
88939	88963	88924	88924	he	352	” returned Ada , with a bashful simplicity that would have won my heart , if she had not won it long before ; “
88974	89251	88967	88967	he	352	” There he was , of course . They brought a chair on either side of me , and put me between them , and really seemed to have fallen in love with me , instead of one another ; they were so confiding , and so trustful , and so fond of me . They went on in their own wild way for a little while — I never stopped them ; I enjoyed it too much myself — and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were , and how there must be a lapse of several years before this early love could come to anything , and how it could come to happiness only if it were real and lasting , and inspired them with a steady resolution to do their duty to each other , with constancy , fortitude , and perseverance : each always for the other 's sake . Well ! Richard said that he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada , and Ada said that she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard , and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names , and we sat there , advising and talking , half the night . Finally , before we parted , I gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to - morrow . So , when to - morrow came , I went to my Guardian after breakfast , in the room that was our town - substitute for the Growlery , and told him that I had it in trust to tell him something . “
89257	89266	89254	89255	little woman	2052	” said he , shutting up his book , “
89282	89283	89284	89284	I	0	” “
89290	89293	89288	89288	Guardian	382	” said I. “

89322	89323	89320	89320	Esther	305	” “
89326	89330	89320	89320	Esther	305	” said I , “
89354	89383	89346	89346	Ada	319	” I wished to recall to his remembrance the look he had given me then . Unless I am much mistaken , I saw that I did so . “
89386	89395	89398	89399	my dear	9060	” said I , with a little hesitation . “
89401	89405	89398	89399	my dear	9060	” said he . “
89410	89411	89398	89399	my dear	9060	” “
89414	89418	89419	89419	Ada	319	” said I , “
89434	89435	89430	89431	each other	10467	” “
89438	89446	89430	89431	each other	10467	” cried my Guardian , quite astonished . “
89449	89453	89430	89431	each other	10467	” said I , “
89468	89469	89472	89472	you	9060	” “
89475	89546	89547	89547	Rick	350	” said he . He sat considering for a minute or two ; with his smile , at once so handsome and so kind , upon his changing face ; and then requested me to let them know that he wished to see them . When they came , he encircled Ada with one arm , in his fatherly way , and addressed himself to Richard with a cheerful gravity . “
89549	89554	89547	89547	Rick	350	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
89664	89665	89659	89659	Rick	350	” “
89673	89677	89659	89659	Rick	350	” returned Richard . “
89680	89685	89659	89659	Rick	350	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
89911	89912	89913	89913	I	0	” “
89920	89924	89913	89913	I	0	” returned Richard , “

89965	89973	89961	89962	Dear cousin	2689	” said Ada , on his shoulder , “
90002	90003	90031	90031	Rick	350	” “
90006	90011	90031	90031	Rick	350	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “

90193	90199	90185	90185	I	0	” replied Richard , smiling , “

90235	90240	90225	90225	Ada	319	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
90256	90257	90252	90252	you	350	” “
90273	90279	90252	90252	you	350	” retorted Richard , proudly . “
90283	90288	90252	90252	you	350	” cried Mr. Jarndyce ; “
90357	90553	90346	90346	I	0	” Ada tenderly embraced him , and Richard heartily shook hands with him , and then the cousins went out of the room — looking back again directly , though , to say that they would wait for me . The door stood open , and we both followed them with our eyes , as they passed down the adjoining room on which the sun was shining , and out at its farther end . Richard with his head bent , and her hand drawn through his arm , was talking to her very earnestly ; and she looked up in his face , listening , and seemed to see nothing else . So young , so beautiful , so full of hope and promise , they went on lightly through the sunlight , as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the years to come , and making them all years of brightness . So they passed away into the shadow , and were gone . It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant . The room darkened as they went out , and the sun was clouded over . “
90560	90586	90558	90558	Esther	305	” said my Guardian , when they were gone . He who was so good and wise , to ask me whether he was right ! “
90612	90621	90600	90600	Wants	487	” said Mr. Jarndyce , shaking his head . “
90640	90673	90631	90631	She	319	” And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head . I could not help shewing that I was a little moved , though I did all I could to conceal it . “
90677	90681	90631	90631	She	319	” said he . “

90763	91026	90749	90751	the little woman	2711	” I have omitted to mention in its place , that there was some one else at the family dinner party . It was not a lady . It was a gentleman . It was a gentleman of a dark complexion — a young surgeon . He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable . At least , Ada asked me if I did not , and I said yes . RICHARD left us on the very next evening , to begin his new career , and committed Ada to my charge with great love for her , and great trust in me . It touched me then to reflect , and it touches me now , more nearly , to remember ( having what I have to tell ) how they both thought of me , even at that engrossing time . I was a part of all their plans , for the present and the future . I was to write to Richard once a week , making my faithful report of Ada who was to write to him every alternate day . I was to be informed , under his own hand , of all his labors and successes ; I was to observe how resolute and persevering he would be ; I was to be Ada 's bridesmaid when they were married ; I was to live with them afterwards ; I was to keep all the keys of their house ; I was to be made happy for ever and a day . “
91045	91060	91036	91036	Esther	305	” said Richard , to crown all . A shade crossed Ada 's face . “
91065	91071	91036	91036	Esther	305	” asked Richard , pausing , “
91075	91076	91077	91077	It	2715	” “
91086	91090	91077	91077	It	2715	” said Ada . “
91100	91104	91093	91093	I	0	” returned Richard ; “

91136	91140	91119	91119	It	2715	” said Ada . “
91145	91159	91119	91119	It	2715	” urged Richard , answering what her look suggested rather than her words , “
91189	91190	91191	91191	You	0	” “
91213	91214	91198	91198	I	0	” “
91229	91234	91218	91218	Ada	319	” cried Richard gaily . “

91315	91319	91275	91278	our grim old guardian	2719	” said Ada , ”
91320	91332	91275	91278	our grim old guardian	2719	“ but it may be better to forget all about it . ”
91333	91338	91340	91340	Richard	320	“ Well , well ! ”

92180	92184	92186	92187	my Guardian	9683	“ Thank you , ”
92189	92209	92186	92187	my Guardian	9683	“ I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby . O dear me ! This is a very trying wind ! ”
92286	92300	92302	92302	she	332	“ We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn , ”
92304	92338	92302	92302	she	332	“ I have no peace of my life . Talk of Africa ! I could n't be worse off if I was a what's - his - name — man and a brother ! ”
92346	92358	92360	92361	Miss Jellyby	332	“ O , it 's of no use , Miss Summerson , ”
92363	92417	92360	92361	Miss Jellyby	332	“ though I thank you for the kind intention all the same . I know how I am used , and I am not to be talked over . You would n't be talked over , if you were used so . Peepy , go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano ! ”
92418	92423	92425	92425	Peepy	330	“ I sha n't ! ”
92427	92441	92425	92425	Peepy	330	“ Very well , you ungrateful , naughty , hard - hearted boy ! ”
92452	92464	92449	92449	her	332	“ I 'll never take pains to dress you any more . ”
92465	92474	92476	92476	Peepy	330	“ Yes , I will go , Caddy ! ”
92501	92511	92514	92515	Miss Jellyby	332	“ It seems a little thing to cry about , ”
92519	92580	92514	92515	Miss Jellyby	332	“ but I am quite worn out . I was directing the new circulars till two this morning . I detest the whole thing so , that that alone makes my head ache till I ca n't see out of my eyes . And look at that poor unfortunate child . Was there ever such a fright as he is ! ”
92620	92633	92635	92636	Miss Jellyby	332	“ I have sent him to the other end of the room , ”
92644	92706	92635	92636	Miss Jellyby	332	“ because I do n't want him to hear the conversation . Those little things are so sharp ! I was going to say , we really are going on worse than ever . Pa will be a bankrupt before long , and then I hope Ma will be satisfied . There 'll be nobody but Ma to thank for it . ”
92725	92741	92747	92747	her	332	“ It 's of no use hoping , though it 's very kind of you ! ”
92750	92852	92747	92747	her	332	“ Pa told me , only yesterday morning , ( and dreadfully unhappy he is ) that he could n't weather the storm . I should be surprised if he could . When all our tradesmen send into our house any stuff they like , and the servants do what they like with it , and I have no time to improve things if I knew how , and Ma do n't care about anything , I should like to make out how Pa is to weather the storm . I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away ! ”

92875	92889	92891	92892	Miss Jellyby	332	“ O yes , his family is all very fine , Miss Summerson , ”
92894	92952	92891	92892	Miss Jellyby	332	“ but what comfort is his family to him ? His family is nothing but bills , dirt , waste , noise , tumbles down stairs , confusion , and wretchedness . His scrambling home , from week's - end to week's - end , is like one great washing - day — only nothing 's washed ! ”
92967	92978	92979	92979	she	332	“ I am sure I pity Pa to that degree , ”
92982	93058	93060	93062	poor Miss Jellyby	332	“ and am so angry with Ma , that I ca n't find words to express myself ! However , I am not going to bear it , I am determined . I wo n't be a slave all my life , and I wo n't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale . A pretty thing , indeed , to marry a Philanthropist . As if I had n't had enough of that ! ”
93103	93120	93100	93100	she	2748	“ If it was n't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our house , ”
93125	93184	93185	93185	She	2748	“ I should have been ashamed to come here to - day , for I know what a figure I must seem to you two . But , as it is , I made up my mind to call : especially as I am not likely to see you again , the next time you come to town . ”
93205	93208	93214	93214	her	332	“ No ! ”
93217	93244	93214	93214	her	332	“ Not at all likely ! I know I may trust you two . I am sure you wo n't betray me . I am engaged . ”

93255	93265	93266	93266	she	2748	“ Why , good gracious me , Miss Summerson , ”
93279	93305	93266	93266	she	2748	“ how can it be otherwise ? You know what Ma is — and I need n't make poor Pa more miserable by telling him . ”
93306	93328	93330	93330	I.	0	“ But would it not be adding to his unhappiness , to marry without his knowledge or consent , my dear ? ”
93331	93334	93336	93337	Miss Jellyby	332	“ No , ”
93341	93391	93336	93337	Miss Jellyby	332	“ I hope not . I should try to make him happy and comfortable when he came to see me ; and Peepy and the others should take it in turns to come and stay with me ; and they should have some care taken of them , then . ”
93573	93583	93584	93584	she	328	“ It began in your coming to our house , ”
93592	93600	93601	93601	she	328	“ I felt I was so awkward , ”
93604	93688	93601	93601	she	328	“ that I made up my mind to be improved in that respect , at all events , and to learn to dance . I told Ma I was ashamed of myself , and I must be taught to dance . Ma looked at me in that provoking way of hers as if I was n't in sight ; but , I was quite determined to be taught to dance , and so I went to Mr. Turveydrop 's Academy in Newman Street . “
93697	93701	93694	93695	my dear	9060	” I began . “
93708	93712	93694	93695	my dear	9060	” said Caddy , “

93799	93806	93794	93794	you	0	” she retorted a little anxiously , “
93885	93886	93876	93879	a very gentlemanly man	2761	” “
93894	93898	93876	93879	a very gentlemanly man	2761	” asked Ada . “
93908	93917	93899	93903	Old Mr. Turveydrop 's wife	2763	” returned Miss Jellyby , opening her eyes . “
93929	94025	93926	93927	a widower	2765	” We were here interrupted by Peepy , whose leg had undergone so much on account of his sister 's unconsciously jerking it like a bell - rope whenever she was emphatic , that the afflicted child now bemoaned his sufferings with a very low - spirited noise . As he appealed to me for compassion , and as I was only a listener , I undertook to hold him . Miss Jellyby proceeded , after begging Peepy 's pardon with a kiss , and assuring him that she had n't meant to do it . “
94034	94038	93926	93927	a widower	2765	” said Caddy . “
94099	94107	94109	94109	I	0	” said Caddy , with a sob , “
94149	94150	94146	94146	he	490	” “
94162	94165	94153	94153	he	490	” said I. “
94171	94175	94153	94153	he	490	” said Caddy . “
94187	94188	94190	94190	he	490	” “
94193	94197	94190	94190	he	490	” asked Ada . “
94208	94212	94200	94200	he	490	” replied Caddy . “
94219	94307	94308	94308	I	0	” Caddy went on to say , with considerable hesitation and reluctance , that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not offend us . It was , that she had improved her acquaintance with Miss Flite , the little crazy old lady ; and that she frequently went there early in the morning , and met her lover for a few minutes before breakfast — only for a few minutes . “
94316	94320	94308	94308	I	0	” said Caddy , “
94493	94507	94490	94490	you	2773	” said Caddy , who had said all this , earnestly and tremblingly , “
94517	95031	94508	94508	I	0	” It happened that we had arranged with my Guardian to go to Miss Flite 's that day . We had told him of our former visit , and our account had interested him ; but something had always happened to prevent our going there again . As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very rash step , if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go to the Academy , and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss Flite's — whose name I now learnt for the first time . This was on condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to dinner . The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to by both , we smartened Peepy up a little , with the assistance of a few pins , some soap and water , and a hair - brush ; and went out : bending our steps towards Newman Street , which was very near . I found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the corner of an archway , with busts in all the staircase windows . In the same house there were also established , as I gathered from the plates on the door , a drawing - master , a coal - merchant ( there was , certainly , no room for his coals ) , and a lithographic artist . On the plate which , in size and situation , took precedence of all the rest , I read MR . TURVEYDROP . The door was open , and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano , a harp , and several other musical instruments in cases , all in progress of removal , and all looking rakish in the daylight . Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent , last night , for a concert . We went up - stairs — it had been quite a fine house once , when it was anybody 's business to keep it clean and fresh , and nobody 's business to smoke in it all day — and into Mr. Turveydrop 's great room , which was built out into a mews at the back , and was lighted by a skylight . It was a bare , resounding room , smelling of stables ; with cane forms along the walls ; and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with painted lyres , and little cut - glass branches for candles , which seemed to be shedding their old - fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves . Several young lady pupils , ranging from thirteen or fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty , were assembled ; and I was looking among them for their instructor , when Caddy , pinching my arm , repeated the ceremony of introduction . “
95039	95163	95164	95164	I	0	” I curtseyed to a little blue - eyed fair man of youthful appearance , with flaxen hair parted in the middle , and curling at the ends all round his head . He had a little fiddle which we used to call at school a kit , under his left arm , and its little bow in the same hand . His little dancing shoes were particularly diminutive , and he had a little innocent , feminine manner , which not only appealed to me in an amiable way , but made this singular effect upon me : that I received the impression that he was like his mother , and that his mother had not been much considered or well used . “
95175	95184	95164	95164	I	0	” he said , bowing low to me . “
95190	95195	95185	95185	I	0	” with timid tenderness , “
95211	95212	95213	95213	I	0	” “
95239	95242	95237	95237	sir	9019	” said I. “
95246	95250	95237	95237	sir	9019	” said he . “
95254	95258	95237	95237	sir	9019	” I entreated , “
95272	95622	95623	95623	Father	318	” With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy ( who , being well used to it , had already climbed into a corner place ) and an old lady of a censorious countenance , whose two nieces were in the class , and who was very indignant with Peepy 's boots . Prince Turveydrop then tinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers , and the young ladies stood up to dance . Just then , there appeared from a side - door , old Mr. Turveydrop , in the full lustre of his Deportment . He was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion , false teeth , false whiskers , and a wig . He had a fur collar , and he had a padded breast to his coat , which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon to be complete . He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear . He had such a neck - cloth on ( puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape ) , and his chin and even his ears so sunk into it , that it seemed as though he must inevitably double up , if it were cast loose . He had , under his arm , a hat of great size and weight , shelving downward from the crown to the brim ; and in his hand a pair of white gloves , with which he flapped it , as he stood poised on one leg , in a high - shouldered round - elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed . He had a cane , he had an eye - glass , he had a snuff - box , he had rings , he had wristbands , he had everything but any touch of nature ; he was not like youth , he was not like age , he was like nothing in the world but a model of Deportment . “
95636	95637	95638	95638	Distinguished	2779	” “
95640	95645	95638	95638	Distinguished	2779	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
95652	95677	95678	95679	My father	1836	” As he bowed to me in that tight state , I almost believed I saw creases come into the whites of his eyes . “
95681	95699	95701	95703	a celebrated character	2781	” said the son , aside , to me , with quite an affecting belief in him , “
95711	95712	95678	95679	My father	1836	” “
95721	95740	95678	95679	My father	1836	” said Mr. Turveydrop , standing with his back to the fire , and waving his gloves condescendingly . “
95747	95842	95844	95844	he	1836	” At this command , or by this gracious permission , the lesson went on . Prince Turveydrop , sometimes , played the kit , dancing ; sometimes played the piano , standing ; sometimes hummed the tune with what little breath he could spare , while he set a pupil right ; always conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step and every part of the figure ; and never rested for an instant . His distinguished father did nothing whatever , but stand before the fire , a model of Deportment . “
95850	95860	95844	95844	he	1836	” said the old lady of the censorious countenance . “
95874	95875	95863	95863	you	2770	” “
95887	95890	95884	95884	you	2770	” said I. “
95909	95915	95902	95902	he	1836	” returned the old lady . “
95923	95934	95902	95902	he	1836	” It certainly was plain — threadbare — almost shabby . “
95945	95951	95936	95937	the father	2788	” said the old lady , “
95968	95983	95963	95963	him	2788	” I felt curious to know more , concerning this person . I asked , “
95993	95994	95985	95985	he	2788	” “
95997	96005	95985	95985	he	2788	” returned the old lady , shortly . “
96009	96026	95985	95985	he	2788	” After a moment 's consideration , I suggested that perhaps fencing had been his accomplishment ? “
96039	96388	96031	96031	he	2788	” said the old lady . I looked surprised and inquisitive . The old lady , becoming more and more incensed against the Master of Deportment as she dwelt upon the subject , gave me some particulars of his career , with strong assurances that they were mildly stated . He had married a meek little dancing - mistress , with a tolerable connexion , ( having never in his life before done anything but deport himself ) , and had worked her to death , or had , at the best , suffered her to work herself to death , to maintain him in those expenses which were indispensable to his position . At once to exhibit his Deportment to the best models , and to keep the best models constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort ; to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere at fashionable times ; and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes . To enable him to do this , the affectionate little dancing - mistress had toiled and labored , and would have toiled and labored to that hour , if her strength had lasted so long . For , the mainspring of the story was , that , in spite of the man 's absorbing selfishness , his wife ( overpowered by his Deportment ) had , to the last , believed in him , and had , on her death - bed , in the most moving terms , confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable claim upon him , and whom he could never regard with too much pride and deference . The son , inheriting his mother 's belief , and having the Deportment always before him , had lived and grown in the same faith , and now , at thirty years of age , worked for his father twelve hours a - day , and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary pinnacle . “
96396	96429	96430	96430	He	2233	” said my informant , shaking her head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on his tight gloves : of course unconscious of the homage she was rendering . “
96466	96478	96479	96479	I	0	” said the old lady , apostrophising him with infinite vehemence , “
96484	96660	96479	96479	I	0	” I could not help being amused , though I heard the old lady out with feelings of real concern . It was difficult to doubt her , with the father and son before me . What I might have thought of them without the old lady 's account , or what I might have thought of the old lady 's account without them , I can not say . There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it . My eyes were yet wandering , from young Mr. Turveydrop working so hard to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully , when the latter came ambling up to me , and entered into conversation . He asked me , first of all , whether I conferred a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it ? I did not think it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that , in any case , but merely told him where I did reside . “
96668	96685	96479	96479	I	0	” he said , kissing his right glove , and afterwards extending it towards the pupils , “
96705	96746	96696	96696	our	2796	” He sat down beside me ; taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa . And really he did look very like it . “
96754	96769	96696	96696	our	2796	” he repeated , taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers . “
96793	96817	96696	96696	our	2796	” with the high - shouldered bow , which it seemed impossible for him to make without lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes—“we
96830	96831	96836	96836	sir	9019	” “
96838	96841	96836	96836	sir	9019	” said I. “
96846	96869	96842	96842	We	2796	” he returned , shaking his head , which he could do , to a very limited extent , in his cravat . “
96998	96999	96988	96988	ma'am,—still	2803	” “
97002	97014	96988	96988	ma'am,—still	2803	” said I. He replied with the high - shouldered bow . “
97024	97028	96988	96988	ma'am,—still	2803	” he added , “

97087	97090	97074	97074	One	767	” said I. “
97096	97108	97109	97109	You	2811	” he smiled , with the high - shouldered bow again . “
97153	97154	97155	97155	He	2812	” “
97163	97167	97155	97155	He	2812	” I observed . “
97204	97221	97177	97179	an excellent master	1896	things”—he took another pinch of snuff and made the bow again , as if to add , “
97230	97259	97177	97179	an excellent master	1896	” I glanced towards the centre of the room , where Miss Jellyby 's lover , now engaged with single pupils , was undergoing greater drudgery than ever . “
97264	97273	97177	97179	an excellent master	1896	” murmured Mr. Turveydrop , adjusting his cravat . “

97343	97416	97417	97418	My dear	9060	” I rose and joined Miss Jellyby , who was , by this time , putting on her bonnet . The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed , there was a general putting on of bonnets . When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none , on this occasion , to exchange a dozen words . “
97420	97429	97417	97418	My dear	9060	” said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son , “
97436	97437	97440	97440	father	2756	” “
97442	97472	97440	97440	father	2756	” The son had no watch . The father had a handsome gold one , which he pulled out , with an air that was an example to mankind . “
97476	97480	97440	97440	father	2756	” said he , “

97530	97535	97526	97526	My	0	” returned his father , “
97552	97553	97542	97542	You	9060	” “
97566	97567	97564	97564	father	2756	” “
97576	97594	97573	97573	I	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders , with modest consciousness , “
97607	97608	97596	97596	I	0	” “
97618	97623	97609	97609	You	2756	” said his son . “
97652	97653	97639	97639	I	0	” “
97663	97670	97661	97661	father	2756	” said Prince , shaking hands . “
97680	98028	97678	97678	you	2784	” Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner , and it seemed to do his son good ; who , in parting from him , was so pleased with him , so dutiful to him , and so proud of him , that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder . The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us ( and particularly of one of us , as I saw , being in the secret ) , enhanced my favorable impression of his almost childish character . I felt a liking for him , and a compassion for him , as he put his little kit in his pocket — and with it his desire to stay a little while with Caddy — and went away good - humouredly to his cold mutton and his school at Kensington , that made me scarcely less irate with his father than the censorious old lady . The father opened the room door for us , and bowed us out , in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original . In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left . For some moments , I was so lost in considering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street , that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy , or even to fix my attention on what she said to me : especially , when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their Deportment . This became so bewildering , and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops , that I said , “
98048	98139	98140	98140	He	2837	” I accordingly did so , and we chatted all the rest of the way to Lincoln 's Inn . Caddy told me that her lover 's education had been so neglected , that it was not always easy to read his notes . She said , if he were not so anxious about his spelling , and took less pains to make it clear , he would do better ; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short words , that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance . “
98148	98152	98140	98140	He	2837	” observed Caddy , “
98165	98250	98159	98159	he	2837	” Caddy then went on to reason , how could he be expected to be a scholar , when he had passed his whole life in the dancing - school , and had done nothing but teach and fag , fag and teach , morning , noon , and night ! And what did it matter ? She could write letters enough for both , as she knew to her cost , and it was far better for him to be amiable than learned . “
98272	98276	98258	98258	I	0	” said Caddy . “
98290	98291	98288	98288	Ma	339	” “
98307	98311	98296	98296	I	0	” continued Caddy , “
98523	98536	98513	98513	I	0	” said Caddy , glancing at the repairs on Peepy 's frock , “
98631	98650	98651	98651	Caddy	328	” The poor girl , trying so hard , said it from her heart , and touched mine . “
98656	98660	98651	98651	Caddy	328	” I replied , “
98679	98680	98684	98684	you	328	” “
98686	98690	98684	98684	you	328	” cried Caddy ; “
98698	98699	98700	98700	My	0	” “
98704	98708	98700	98700	My	0	” said I , “
98738	98936	98937	98937	You	2852	” Caddy was overjoyed . I said everything I could , in my old - fashioned way , to comfort and encourage her ; and I would not have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop , that day , for any smaller consideration than a settlement on his daughter - in - law . By this time , we were come to Mr. Krook 's , whose private door stood open . There was a bill , pasted on the door - post , announcing a room to let on the second floor . It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded up - stairs , that there had been a sudden death there , and an inquest ; and that our little friend had been ill of the fright . The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in . It was the room with the dark door , to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the house . A sad and desolate place it was ; a gloomy , sorrowful place , that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread . “
98941	98950	98937	98937	You	2852	” said Caddy , when we came out , “
98954	99028	99029	99029	I	0	” I felt as if the room had chilled me . We had walked slowly , while we were talking ; and my guardian and Ada were here before us . We found them in Miss Flite 's garret . They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion , spoke with her cheerfully by the fire . “
99036	99043	99029	99029	I	0	” he said , coming forward . “
99078	99095	99068	99068	She	423	” Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency , and dropped a general curtsey to us . “
99100	99104	99068	99068	She	423	” said she , “
99129	99135	99136	99138	Fitz - Jarndyce	496	” with a special curtsey . “
99143	99162	99136	99138	Fitz - Jarndyce	496	” she had bestowed that name on Caddy , it appeared , and always called her by it ; “
99167	99168	99136	99138	Fitz - Jarndyce	496	” “
99175	99207	99136	99138	Fitz - Jarndyce	496	” asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her . She answered for herself directly , though he had put the question in a whisper . “
99217	99223	99136	99138	Fitz - Jarndyce	496	” she said , confidentially . “
99245	99253	99290	99291	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” in a subdued voice and trembling , “
99293	99298	99290	99291	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” with great stateliness . “
99313	99314	99315	99316	Miss Flite	423	” “
99318	99349	99315	99316	Miss Flite	423	” said Mr. Woodcourt , in a grave kind voice as if he were appealing to her while speaking to us ; and laying his hand gently on her arm ; “
99436	99437	99438	99443	The kindest physician in the college	2868	” “
99445	99452	99438	99443	The kindest physician in the college	2868	” whispered Miss Flite to me . “
99470	99471	99472	99472	She	423	” “
99484	99497	99472	99472	She	423	” said Mr. Woodcourt , looking at her with an observant smile , “
99521	99522	99514	99514	you	0	” “
99526	99534	99514	99514	you	0	” said Miss Flite , smiling brightly . “
99641	99666	99638	99638	I	0	” said Miss Flite , drawing herself back with a very shrewd look , and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant manner , “
99818	99887	99810	99810	I	0	” I congratulated her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income , and wished her a long continuance of it . I did not speculate upon the source from which it came , or wonder whose humanity was so considerate . My Guardian stood before me , contemplating the birds , and I had no need to look beyond him . “
99899	99907	99891	99891	you	0	” said he in his pleasant voice . “
99913	99914	99891	99891	you	0	” “
99925	99929	99915	99915	I	0	” said I , “
99943	99949	99940	99940	Ada	319	” Ada remembered very well . “
99953	99956	99951	99951	I	0	” said Miss Flite.—“Who
99974	100006	100007	100007	I	0	” The old man of the house , pushing it open before him , appeared there with his fur - cap in his hand , and his cat at his heels . “
100014	100018	100011	100012	Miss Flite	423	” he said . “
100036	100037	100031	100031	you	423	” “
100048	100055	100031	100031	you	423	” the old lady angrily exclaimed . “
100065	100088	100089	100089	she	2876	” said Mr. Krook , looking slowly and sharply from one to another , until he had looked at all of us ; “
100108	100109	100102	100102	I	0	” “
100116	100126	100127	100127	M	499	” said the old lady with a dignified air . “
100144	100145	100137	100137	Krook	343	” “
100148	100154	100137	100137	Krook	343	” said the old man . “
100162	100163	100159	100160	the Chancellor	858	” “
100166	100171	100159	100160	the Chancellor	858	” returned Miss Flite . “
100176	100177	100159	100160	the Chancellor	858	” “
100182	100192	100179	100180	the Chancellor	858	” said the old man , with a chuckle , “
100280	100281	100259	100259	I	0	” “
100287	100301	100259	100259	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce ( which he never did on any consideration ) . “
100310	100311	100313	100313	you	0	” “
100316	100322	100313	100313	you	0	” returned Krook , grinning . “
100371	100407	100359	100359	you	0	” The old man had come by little and little into the room , until he now touched my Guardian with his elbow , and looked close up into his face with his spectacled eyes . “
100438	100445	100433	100433	she	2403	” This was in a whisper . “
100454	100477	100447	100447	I	0	” he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate . ”
100478	100483	100484	100484	she	2403	“ If you like , ”
100509	100567	100569	100571	the old man	1258	“ Hope , Joy , Youth , Peace , Rest , Life , Dust , Ashes , Waste , Want , Ruin , Despair , Madness , Death , Cunning , Folly , Words , Wigs , Rags , Sheepskin , Plunder , Precedent , Jargon , Gammon , and Spinach . That 's the whole collection , ”
100573	100586	100569	100571	the old man	1258	“ all cooped up together , by my noble and learned brother . ”
100587	100594	100596	100597	my Guardian	9683	“ This is a bitter wind ! ”
100599	100618	100620	100620	Krook	343	“ When my noble and learned brother gives his Judgment , they 're to be let go free , ”
100627	100631	100632	100632	he	343	“ And then , ”
100639	100662	100632	100632	he	343	“ if that ever was to happen — which it won't — the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em . ”
100663	100673	100675	100676	my Guardian	9683	“ If ever the wind was in the east , ”
100689	100699	100675	100676	my Guardian	9683	“ I think it 's there to - day ! ”
101084	101091	101093	101094	my Guardian	9683	“ What are you doing here ? ”
101096	101106	101108	101108	Krook	343	“ Trying to learn myself to read and write , ”
101110	101118	101108	101108	Krook	343	“ And how do you get on ? ”
101119	101124	101126	101128	the old man	1258	“ Slow . Bad , ”
101132	101142	101126	101128	the old man	1258	“ It 's hard at my time of life . ”
101143	101155	101157	101158	my Guardian	9683	“ It would be easier to be taught by some one , ”
101160	101170	101172	101174	the old man	1258	“ Aye , but they might teach me wrong ! ”
101185	101215	101182	101182	his	1258	“ I do n't know what I may have lost , by not being learnd afore . I would n't like to lose anything by being learnd wrong now . ”
101216	101219	101225	101225	his	1258	“ Wrong ? ”
101231	101241	101225	101225	his	1258	“ Who do you suppose would teach you wrong ? ”
101242	101254	101256	101258	the old man	1258	“ I do n't know , Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House ! ”
101273	101293	101256	101258	the old man	1258	“ I do n't suppose as anybody would — but I 'd rather trust my own self than another ! ”
101613	101628	101608	101608	I	0	“ Now , my darling , let us have a little talk about Richard ! ”
102561	102603	102554	102554	He	358	“ Now , my dear doctor , it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you attend me for nothing . I am overwhelming you with money — in my expansive intentions — if you only knew it ! ”
102716	102733	102735	102736	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ It may be , partly , because I know nothing of the value of money , ”
102738	102840	102735	102736	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ but I often feel this . It seems so reasonable ! My butcher says to me , he wants that little bill . It 's a part of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the man 's nature , that he always calls it a ‘ little ’ bill — to make the payment appear easy to both of us . I reply to the butcher , My good friend , if you knew it you are paid . You have n't had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill . You are paid . I mean it . ”
102841	102846	102848	102849	my Guardian	9683	“ But , suppose , ”
102853	102868	102848	102849	my Guardian	9683	“ he had meant the meat in the bill , instead of providing it ? ”
102869	102874	102735	102736	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
102878	103070	102735	102736	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ you surprise me . You take the butcher 's position . A butcher I once dealt with , occupied that very ground . Says he , ‘ Sir , why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen - pence a pound ? ’ ‘ Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen - pence a pound , my honest friend ? ’ said I , naturally amazed by the question . ‘ I like spring lamb ! ’ This was so far convincing . ‘ Well , sir , ’ says he , ‘ I wish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money ! ’ ‘ My good fellow , ’ said I , ‘ pray let us reason like intellectual beings . How could that be ? It was impossible . You had got the lamb , and I have not got the money . You could n't really mean the lamb without sending it in , whereas I can , and do , really mean the money without paying it ! ’ He had not a word . There was an end of the subject . ”
103071	103079	103081	103082	my Guardian	9683	“ Did he take no legal proceedings ? ”
103084	103092	103094	103095	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Yes , he took legal proceedings , ”
103097	103141	103094	103095	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ But , in that , he was influenced by passion ; not by reason . Passion reminds me of Boythron . He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a short visit at his bachelor - house in Lincolnshire . ”
103142	103152	103154	103155	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ He is a great favorite with my girls , ”
103157	103165	103154	103155	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ and I have promised for them . ”
103166	103177	103179	103180	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Nature forgot to shade him off , I think ? ”
103186	103231	103179	103180	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ A little too boisterous — like the sea ? A little too vehement — like a bull , who has made up his mind to consider every color scarlet ? But , I grant a sledge - hammering sort of merit in him ! ”
103314	103320	103322	103323	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ He has invited me , ”
103325	103405	103406	103406	He	358	“ and if a child may trust himself in such hands : which the present child is encouraged to do , with the united tenderness of two angels to guard him : I shall go . He proposes to frank me down and back again . I suppose it will cost money ? Shillings perhaps ? Or pounds ? Or something of that sort ? By the bye . Coavinses . You remember our friend Coavinses , Miss Summerson ? ”
103432	103436	103438	103438	I.	0	“ O yes ! ”
103439	103449	103451	103452	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Coavinses has been arrested by the great Bailiff , ”
103454	103466	103451	103452	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ He will never do violence to the sunshine any more . ”
103505	103514	103516	103517	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ His successor informed me of it yesterday , ”
103519	103591	103516	103517	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ His successor is in my house now — in possession , I think he calls it . He came yesterday , on my blue - eyed daughter 's birthday . I put it to him , ‘ This is unreasonable and inconvenient . If you had a blue - eyed daughter you would n't like me to come , uninvited , on her birthday ? ’ But , he stayed . ”
103611	103617	103618	103618	he	358	“ And he told me , ”
103631	103661	103618	103618	he	358	“ That Coavinses had left . Three children . No mother . And that Coavinses profession . Being unpopular . The rising Coavinses . Were at a considerable disadvantage . ”
103744	103753	103754	103754	he	9683	“ I do n't like this , Skimpole , ”
103773	103779	103759	103760	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ The man was necessary , ”
103827	103883	103898	103898	he	358	“ If we make such men necessary by our faults and follies , or by our want of worldly knowledge , or by our misfortunes , we must not revenge ourselves upon them . There was no harm in his trade . He maintained his children . One would like to know more about this . ”
103884	103889	103891	103892	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ O ! Coavinses ? ”
103901	103921	103898	103898	he	358	“ Nothing easier . A walk to Coavinses head - quarters , and you can know what you will . ”
103936	103958	103922	103923	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Come ! We will walk that way , my dears . Why not that way , as soon as another ! ”
104063	104069	104071	104072	the boy	9518	“ Who did you want ? ”
104083	104098	104100	104101	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ There was a follower , or an officer , or something , here , ”
104103	104108	104100	104101	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ who is dead . ”
104109	104112	104114	104115	the boy	9518	“ Yes ? ”
104117	104120	104114	104115	the boy	9518	“ Well ? ”
104121	104133	104100	104101	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I want to know his name , if you please ? ”
104134	104139	104141	104142	the boy	9518	“ Name of Neckett , ”
104144	104149	104141	104142	the boy	9518	“ And his address ? ”
104150	104154	104156	104157	the boy	9518	“ Bell Yard , ”
104159	104172	104156	104157	the boy	9518	“ Chandler 's shop , left hand side , name of Blinder . ”

104193	104197	104199	104200	the boy	9518	“ Was Neckett ? ”
104202	104242	104199	104200	the boy	9518	“ Yes , wery much so . He was never tired of watching . He 'd set upon a post at a street corner , eight or ten hours at a stretch , if he undertook to do it . ”

105734	105742	105725	105725	Charley	372	“ because of earning sixpences and shillings ! ”
105743	105757	105483	105484	the child	9058	“ And do you always lock the babies up when you go out ? ”
105758	105770	105772	105772	Charley	372	“ To keep'em safe , sir , do n't you see ? ”
105774	105819	105772	105772	Charley	372	“ Mrs. Blinder comes up now and then , and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes , and perhaps I can run in sometimes , and they can play you know , and Tom an't afraid of being locked up , are you , Tom ? ”

105965	105971	105973	105973	Tom	452	“ O yes , Charley ! ”

106242	106247	106249	106250	my Guardian	9683	“ Well , well ! ”
106255	106292	106293	106293	he	9683	“ It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it was much , and that forasmuch as she did it unto the least of these — ! This child , ”
106301	106308	106293	106293	he	9683	“ could she possibly continue this ? ”
106309	106319	106321	106322	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ Really , sir , I think she might , ”
106332	106442	106321	106322	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ She 's as handy as it 's possible to be . Bless you , sir , the way she tended them two children , after the mother died , was the talk of the yard ! And it was a wonder to see her with him after he was took ill , it really was ! ‘ Mrs. Blinder , ’ he said to me the very last he spoke — he was lying there—‘Mrs . Blinder , whatever my calling may have been , I see a Angel sitting in this room last night along with my child , and I trust her to Our Father ! ’ ”
106443	106450	106452	106453	my Guardina	3052	“ He had no other calling ? ”
106455	106460	106452	106453	my Guardina	3052	“ No , sir , ”
106465	106526	106528	106529	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ he was nothing but a follerer . When he first came to lodge here , I did n't know what he was , and I confess that when I found out I gave him notice . It was n't liked in the yard . It was n't approved by the other lodgers . It is not a genteel calling , ”
106531	106564	106528	106529	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ and most people do object to it . Mr. Gridley objected to it , very strong ; and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . ”
106565	106572	106574	106575	my Guardian	9683	“ So you gave him notice ? ”
106577	106584	106586	106587	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ So I gave him notice , ”
106589	106627	106629	106630	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts . He was punctual and diligent ; he did what he had to do , sir , ”
106640	106655	106634	106635	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ and it 's something , in this world , even to do that . ”
106656	106664	106574	106575	my Guardian	9683	“ So you kept him after all ? ”
106665	106742	106634	106635	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Why , I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley , I could arrange it with the other lodgers , and should not so much mind its being liked or disliked in the yard . Mr. Gridley gave his consent gruff — but gave it . He was always gruff with him , but he has been kind to the children since . A person is never known till a person is proved . ”
106743	106753	106755	106756	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Have many people been kind to the children ? ”
106758	106769	106771	106772	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ Upon the whole , not so bad , sir , ”
106774	106956	106771	106772	Mrs. Blinder	509	“ but , certainly not so many as would have been , if their father 's calling had been different . Mr. Coavins gave a guinea , and the follerers made up a little purse . Some neighbours in the yard , that had always joked and tapped their shoulders when he went by , came forward with a little subscription , and — in general — not so bad . Similarly with Charlotte . Some people wo n't employ her , because she was a follerer 's child ; some people that do employ her , cast it at her ; some make a merit of having her to work for them , with that and all her drawbacks upon her ; and perhaps pay her less and put upon her more . But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over . So I should say , in general , not so bad , sir , but might be better . ”
107026	107042	107043	107043	he	313	“ I do n't know what you may be doing here , ladies and gentlemen , ”
107053	107096	107097	107097	He	313	“ but you 'll excuse my coming in . I do n't come in , to stare about me . Well , Charley ! Well , Tom ! Well , little one ! How is it with us all to - day ? ”
107149	107163	107164	107164	he	9683	“ No one , surely , would come here to stare about him , ”
107168	107179	107181	107182	the other	9883	“ May be so , sir , may be so , ”
107196	107222	107181	107182	the other	9883	“ I do n't want to argue with ladies and gentlemen . I have had enough of arguing , to last one man his life . ”
107223	107233	107235	107236	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ You have sufficient reason , I dare say , ”
107238	107245	107235	107236	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ for being chafed and irritated — ”
107246	107250	107252	107253	the man	1653	“ There again ! ”
107259	107276	107252	107253	the man	1653	“ I am of a quarrelsome temper . I am irascible . I am not polite ! ”

107375	107446	107447	107447	he	1653	“ I have been dragged for five - and - twenty years over burning iron , and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet . Go into the Court of Chancery yonder , and ask what is one of the standing jokes that brighten up their business sometimes , and they will tell you that the best joke they have , is the man from Shropshire . I , ”
107458	107465	107447	107447	he	1653	“ am the man from Shropshire . ”

107507	107511	107513	107513	Gridley	510	“ Mr. Jarndyce , ”
107522	107618	107619	107619	he	3066	“ you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine . More than that , I tell you — and I tell this gentleman , and these young ladies , if they are friends of yours — that if I took my wrongs in any other way , I should be driven mad ! It is only by resenting them , and by revenging them in my mind , and by angrily demanding the justice I never get , that I am able to keep my wits together . It is only that ! ”
107635	107707	107619	107619	he	3066	“ You may tell me that I over - excite myself . I answer that it 's in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it . There 's nothing between doing it , and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman that haunts the Court . If I was once to sit down under it , I should become imbecile . ”
107744	107748	107749	107749	he	3066	“ Mr. Jarndyce , ”
107752	108193	107749	107749	he	3066	“ consider my case . As true as there is a Heaven above us , this is my case . I am one of two brothers . My father ( a farmer ) made a will , and left his farm and stock , and so forth , to my mother , for her life . After my mother 's death , all was to come to me , except a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my brother . My mother died . My brother , some time afterwards , claimed his legacy . I , and some of my relations , said that he had had a part of it already , in board and lodging , and some other things . Now , mind ! That was the question , and nothing else . No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not . To settle that question , my brother filing a bill , I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery ; I was forced there , because the law forced me , and would let me go nowhere else . Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit ! It first came on , after two years . It was then stopped for another two years , while the Master ( may his head rot off ! ) inquired whether I was my father 's son — about which , there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature . He then found out , that there were not defendants enough — remember , there were only seventeen as yet!—but , that we must have another who had been left out ; and must begin all over again . The costs at that time — before the thing was begun!—were three times the legacy . My brother would have given up the legacy , and joyful , to escape more costs . My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father 's , has gone in costs . The suit , still undecided , has fallen into rack , and ruin , and despair , with everything else — and here I stand , this day ! Now , Mr. Jarndyce , in your suit there are thousands and thousands involved where in mine there are hundreds . Is mine less hard to bear , or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it , and has been thus shamefully sucked away ? ”
108226	108230	108232	108233	Mr. Gridley	510	“ There again ! ”
108242	108472	108239	108239	his	510	“ The system ! I am told , on all hands , it 's the system . I must n't look to individuals . It 's the system . I must n't go into Court , and say , ‘ My Lord , I beg to know this from you — is this right or wrong ? Have you the face to tell me I have received justice , and therefore am dismissed ? ’ My Lord knows nothing of it . He sits there , to administer the system . I must n't go to Mr. Tulkinghorn , the solicitor in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and say to him when he makes me furious , by being so cool and satisfied — as they all do ; for I know they gain by it while I lose , do n't I?—I must n't say to him , I will have something out of some one for my ruin , by fair means or foul ! He is not responsible . It 's the system . But , if I do no violence to any of them , here — I may ! I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last!—I will accuse the individual workers of that system against me , face to face , before the great eternal bar ! ”
108490	108495	108496	108496	he	3067	“ I have done ! ”
108506	108788	108789	108789	he	3068	“ Mr. Jarndyce , I have done ! I am violent , I know . I ought to know it . I have been in prison for contempt of Court . I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor . I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again . I am the man from Shropshire , and I sometimes go beyond amusing them — though they have found it amusing , too , to see me committed into custody , and brought up in custody , and all that . It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself . I tell them , that if I did restrain myself , I should become imbecile . I was a good - enough - tempered man once , I believe . People in my part of the country , say , they remember me so ; but , now , I must have this vent under my sense of injury , or nothing could hold my wits together . ‘ It would be far better for you , Mr. Gridley , ’ the Lord Chancellor told me last week , ‘ not to waste your time here , and to stay , usefully employed , down in Shropshire . ’ ‘ My Lord , my Lord , I know it would , ’ said I to him , ‘ and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office ; but , unhappily for me , I ca n't undo the past , and the past drives me here!’—Besides , ”
108796	108876	108789	108789	he	3068	“ I 'll shame them . To the last , I 'll shew myself in that court to its shame . If I knew when I was going to die , and could be carried there , and had a voice to speak with , I would die there , saying , ‘ You have brought me here , and sent me from here , many and many a time . Now send me out , feet foremost ! ’ ”

108929	108964	108921	108921	he	3068	“ and let them play about . I did n't mean to say all this , but it do n't much signify . You 're not afraid of me , Tom ; are you ? ”

112599	112605	112595	112595	Jo	440	“ Him as wos dead ? ”
112606	112631	112578	112578	Jo	440	“ Hush ! Speak in a whisper ! Yes . Did he look , when he was living , so very ill and poor ? ”
112632	112636	112638	112638	Jo	440	“ O jist ! ”

112669	112688	112667	112667	Jo	440	“ I 'm a reg'lar one , I am ! You did n't know him , did you ? ”
112689	112700	112718	112718	he	440	“ How dare you ask me if I knew him ? ”
112701	112708	112710	112710	Jo	440	“ No offence , my lady , ”
112730	112742	112718	112718	he	440	“ I am not a lady . I am a servant . ”
112743	112750	112752	112752	Jo	440	“ You are a jolly servant ! ”
112770	112843	112844	112844	Jo	440	“ Listen and be silent . Do n't talk to me , and stand farther from me ! Can you shew me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ? The place he wrote for , the place he died at , the place where you were taken to , and the place where he was buried ? Do you know the place where he was buried ? ”
112860	112907	112908	112908	Jo	440	“ Go before me , and show me all those dreadful places . Stop opposite to each , and do n't speak to me unless I speak to you . Do n't look back . Do what I want , and I will pay you well . ”
112948	112953	112955	112955	Jo	440	“ I am fly , ”

112999	113024	113025	113025	Jo	440	“ I do n't understand you . Go on before ! I will give you more money than you ever had in your life . ”

113089	113104	113106	113106	Jo	440	“ Him wot give him his writing , and give me half a bull , ”
113118	113125	113106	113106	Jo	440	“ Go on to the next . ”
113138	113143	113130	113130	Jo	440	“ Who lives here ? ”
113144	113149	113150	113150	Jo	440	“ He lived here , ”
113162	113167	113130	113130	Jo	440	“ In which room ? ”
113168	113208	113130	113130	Jo	440	“ In the back room up there . You can see the winder from this corner . Up there ! That 's where I see him stritched out . This is the public ouse where I was took to . ”
113209	113216	113217	113217	It	3234	“ Go on to the next ! ”
113289	113295	113297	113297	Jo	440	“ He was put there , ”
113307	113318	113297	113297	Jo	440	“ Where ? O , what a scene of horror ! ”
113319	113322	113324	113324	Jo	440	“ There ! ”
113328	113393	113324	113324	Jo	440	“ Over yinder . Among them piles of bones , and close to that there kitchin winder ! They put him wery nigh the top . They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in . I could unkiver it for you , with my broom , if the gate was open . That 's why they locks it , I s'pose , ”
113399	113410	113412	113412	Jo	440	“ It 's always locked . Look at the rat ! ”
113416	113431	113412	113412	Jo	440	“ Hi ! Look ! There he goes ! Ho ! Into the ground ! ”
113498	113508	113494	113494	she	9196	“ Is this place of abomination , consecrated ground ? ”
113509	113519	113521	113521	Jo	440	“ I do n't know nothink of consequential ground , ”
113526	113531	113521	113521	Jo	440	“ Is it blessed ? ”
113532	113535	113537	113537	Jo	440	“ WHICH ? ”
113545	113550	113537	113537	Jo	440	“ Is it blessed ? ”
113551	113559	113561	113561	Jo	440	“ I 'm blest if I know , ”
113568	113579	113581	113581	Jo	440	“ but I should n't think it warn't . Blest ? ”
113589	113617	113581	113581	Jo	440	“ It an't done it much good if it is . Blest ? I should think it was t'othered myself . But I do n't know nothink ! ”
113701	113704	113705	113705	she	9196	“ Now , ”
113708	113715	113705	113705	she	9196	“ show me the spot again ! ”
113975	113994	113996	113997	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the house , my dear , ”
114001	114038	113996	113997	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ His dressing - room is on my Lady 's side . And in all these years I never heard the step upon the Ghost 's Walk , more distinct than it is to - night ! ”
114400	114406	114408	114409	Mrs. Badger	476	“ Why , Mr. Carstone , ”
114411	114522	114523	114523	I	0	“ is very well , and is , I assure you , a great acquisition to our society . Captain Swosser used to say of me that I was always better than land a - head and a breeze a - starn to the midshipmen 's mess when the purser 's junk had become as tough as the fore - topsel weather earings . It was his naval way of mentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society . I may render the same tribute , I am sure , to Mr. Carstone . But , I — you wo n't think me premature if I mention it ? ”
114540	114545	114547	114549	Mrs. Bayham Badger	476	“ Nor Miss Clare ? ”
114563	114572	114574	114575	Mrs. Badger—“you'll	518	“ Why , you see , my dears , ”
114575	114583	114574	114575	Mrs. Badger—“you'll	518	Badger—“you'll excuse my calling you my dears ? ”
114593	114609	114586	114587	Mrs. Badger	476	“ Because you really are , if I may take the liberty of saying so , ”
114614	114644	114611	114612	Mrs. Badger	476	“ so perfectly charming . You see , my dears , that although I am still young — or Mr. Bayham Badger pays me the compliment of saying so — ”
114645	114648	114649	114650	Mr. Badger	475	“ No , ”
114663	114668	114649	114650	Mr. Badger	475	“ Not at all ! ”
114669	114673	114675	114676	Mrs. Badger	476	“ Very well , ”
114678	114685	114675	114676	Mrs. Badger	476	“ we will say still young . ”
114687	114690	114692	114693	Mr. Badger	475	“ Undoubtedly , ”
114696	114815	114826	114827	Mr. Badger	475	“ My dears , though still young , I have had many opportunities of observing young men . There were many such on board the dear old Crippler , I assure you . After that , when I was with Captain Swosser in the Mediterranean , I embraced every opportunity of knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser 's command . You never heard them called the young gentlemen , my dears , and probably would not understand allusions to their pipeclaying their weekly accounts ; but it is otherwise with me , for blue water has been a second home to me , and I have been quite a sailor . Again , with Professor Dingo . ”
114817	114824	114826	114827	Mr. Badger	475	“ A man of European reputation , ”
114830	114847	114849	114850	Mrs. Badger	476	“ When I lost my dear first , and became the wife of my dear second , ”
114866	114959	114849	114850	Mrs. Badger	476	“ I still enjoyed opportunities of observing youth . The class attendant on Professor Dingo 's lectures was a large one , and it became my pride , as the wife of an eminent scientific man seeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could impart , to throw our house open to the students , as a kind of Scientific Exchange . Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed biscuit , for all who chose to partake of those refreshments . And there was Science to an unlimited extent . ”
114961	114969	114971	114972	Mr. Badger	475	“ Remarkable assemblies those , Miss Summerson , ”
114976	114996	114971	114972	Mr. Badger	475	“ There must have been great intellectual friction going on there , under the auspices of such a man ! ”
114998	115002	115004	115005	Mrs. Badger	476	“ And now , ”
115007	115090	115004	115005	Mrs. Badger	476	“ now that I am the wife of my dear third , Mr. Badger , I still pursue those habits of observation which were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser , and adapted to new and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo . I therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a Neophyte . And yet I am very much of the opinion , my dears , that he has not chosen his profession advisedly . ”
115110	115116	115117	115117	she	476	“ My dear Miss Summerson , ”
115120	115273	115117	115117	she	476	“ on Mr. Carstone 's character and conduct . He is of such a very easy disposition , that probably he would never think it worth while to mention how he really feels ; but , he feels languid about the profession . He has not that positive interest in it which makes it his vocation . If he has any decided impression in reference to it . I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit . Now , this is not promising . Young men , like Mr. Allan Woodcourt , who take to it from a strong interest in all that it can do , will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a very little money , and through years of considerable endurance and disappointment . But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr. Carstone . ”
115274	115282	115284	115284	Ada	319	“ Does Mr. Badger think so too ? ”
115288	115291	115293	115294	Mr. Badger	475	“ Why , ”
115296	115405	115293	115294	Mr. Badger	475	“ to tell the truth , Miss Clare , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it . But , when Mrs. Badger put it in that light , I naturally gave great consideration to it ; knowing that Mrs. Badger 's mind , in addition to its natural advantages , has had the rare advantage of being formed by two such very distinguished ( I will even say illustrious ) public men as Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo . The conclusion at which I have arrived is — in short , is Mrs. Badger 's conclusion . ”
115406	115416	115418	115419	Mrs. Badger	476	“ It was a maxim of Captain Swosser 's , ”
115421	115488	115418	115419	Mrs. Badger	476	“ speaking in his figurative naval manner , that when you make pitch hot , you can not make it too hot ; and that if you only have to swab a plank , you should swab it as if Davy Jones were after you . It appears to me that this maxim is applicable to the medical , as well as to the nautical profession . ”
115489	115494	115496	115497	Mr. Badger	475	“ To all professions , ”
115499	115511	115293	115294	Mr. Badger	475	“ It was admirably said by Captain Swosser . Beautifully said . ”
115512	115533	115535	115536	Mrs. Badger	476	“ People objected to Professor Dingo , when we were staying in the North of Devon , after our marriage , ”
115538	115590	115535	115536	Mrs. Badger	476	“ that he disfigured some of the houses and other buildings , by chipping off fragments of those edifices with his little geological hammer . But the Professor replied , that he knew of no building , save the Temple of Science . The principle is the same , I think ? ”
115591	115596	115598	115599	Mr. Badger	475	“ Precisely the same , ”
115601	115650	115598	115599	Mr. Badger	475	“ Finely expressed ! The Professor made the same remark , Miss Summerson , in his last illness ; when ( his mind wandering ) he insisted on keeping his little hammer under the pillow , and chipping at the countenances of the attendants . The ruling passion ! ”
115773	115783	115800	115803	a sister of me	3267	“ And how do you get on , Richard ? ”
115805	115811	115813	115813	Richard	320	“ O ! well enough ! ”
115815	115829	115831	115832	my pet	1339	“ He ca n't say better than that , Esther , can he ? ”

115863	115866	115868	115868	Richard	320	“ Yes , ”
115870	115894	115868	115868	Richard	320	“ well enough . It 's rather jog - trotty and humdrum . But it 'll do as well as any thing else ! ”
115895	115902	115903	115903	I	0	“ O ! my dear Richard ! ”
115906	115912	115914	115914	Richard	320	“ What 's the matter ? ”
115916	115924	115914	115914	Richard	320	“ Do as well as anything else ! ”
115925	115940	115942	115942	Ada	319	“ I do n't think there 's any harm in that , Dame Durden , ”
115952	115973	115942	115942	Ada	319	“ Because if it will do as well as anything else , it will do very well , I hope . ”
115974	115982	115984	115984	Richard	320	“ O yes , I hope so , ”
115994	116042	116043	116043	Ada	319	“ After all , it may be only a kind of probation till our suit is — I forgot though . I am not to mention the suit . Forbidden ground ! O yes , it 's all right enough . Let us talk about something else . ”
116084	116090	116092	116092	I	0	“ No , but Richard , ”
116094	116157	116092	116092	I	0	“ and my dear Ada ! Consider how important it is to you both , and what a point of honour it is towards your cousin , that you , Richard , should be quite in earnest without any reservation . I think we had better talk about this , really , Ada . It will be too late , very soon . ”
116158	116168	116170	116170	Ada	319	“ O yes ! We must talk about it ! ”
116172	116180	116170	116170	Ada	319	“ But I think Richard is right . ”
116208	116219	116221	116221	I	0	“ Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday , Richard , ”
116223	116240	116221	116221	I	0	“ and they seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the profession . ”
116241	116246	116248	116248	Richard	320	“ Did they though ? ”
116250	116312	116248	116248	Richard	320	“ O ! Well , that rather alters the case , because I had no idea that they thought so , and I should not have liked to disappoint or inconvenience them . The fact is , I do n't care much about it . But O , it do n't matter ! It 'll do as well as anything else ! ”
116313	116320	116322	116322	I.	0	“ You hear him , Ada ! ”
116323	116328	116322	116322	I.	0	“ The fact is , ”
116338	116368	116329	116329	Richard	320	“ it is not quite in my way . I do n't take to it . And I get too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger 's first and second . ”
116369	116378	116380	116380	Ada	319	“ I am sure that 's very natural ! ”
116385	116396	116380	116380	Ada	319	“ The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! ”
116397	116400	116329	116329	Richard	320	“ Then , ”
116404	116429	116329	116329	Richard	320	“ it 's monotonous , and to - day is too like yesterday , and to - morrow is too like to - day . ”

116440	116462	116438	116438	I	0	“ this is an objection to all kinds of application — to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . ”

116497	116535	116489	116489	he	3272	“ we travel outside a circle , to what I said just now . It 'll do as well as anything else . O , it 's all right enough ! Let us talk about something else . ”

116676	116786	116788	116788	Richard	320	“ that 's the very thing ! I have thought of that , several times ; and have been quite angry with myself for meaning to be so much in carnest , and — somehow — not exactly being so . I do n't know how it is ; I seem to want something or other to stand by . Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada ( my darling cousin , I love you , so much ! ) , but I do n't settle down to constancy in other things . It 's such uphill work , and it takes such a time ! ”
116796	116801	116802	116802	I	0	“ That may be , ”
116805	116816	116802	116802	I	0	“ because you do n't like what you have chosen . ”

I could n't tell , till I tried . Now the question is , whether it 's worth while to undo all that has been done . It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . ”

I should be able to look after Ada 's interests , and my own interests ( the same thing ! ) ; and I should peg away at Blackstone and all those fellows with the most tremendous ardor . ”

117321	117369	117371	117371	Richard	320	“ I am as steady as you are . I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I wo n't do so any more , and I 'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen . That is , you know , ”
117377	117397	117371	117371	Richard	320	“ if it really is worth while , after all , to make such a disturbance about nothing particular ! ”

117495	117568	117487	117488	my Guardian	9683	“ we can retreat with honour , and we will . But we must be careful — for our cousin 's sake , Rick , for our cousin 's sake — that we make no more such mistakes . Therefore , in the matter of the law , we will have a good trial before we decide . We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . ”
117706	117721	117730	117730	he	313	“ Cousin John , I hope you do n't think the worse of Richard ? ”

117732	117754	117730	117730	he	313	“ Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such a difficult case . It is not uncommon . ”

117810	117829	117800	117800	she	319	“ But I should be a little so , if you thought at all the worse of Richard . ”

117839	117927	117836	117837	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I should think the worse of him , only if you were ever in the least unhappy through his means . I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself , even then , than with poor Rick , for I brought you together . But , tut , all this is nothing ! He has time before him , and the race to run . I think the worse of him ? Not I , my loving cousin ! And not you , I swear ! ”
117928	117936	117938	117938	Ada	319	“ No , indeed , cousin John , ”
117940	117986	117938	117938	Ada	319	“ I am sure I could not — I am sure I would not — think any ill of Richard , if the whole world did . I could , and I would , think better of him then , than at any other time ! ”

If any real disadvantage can attach to your position , in the mind of any man or woman worth a thought , it is right that you , at least , of all the world should not magnify it to yourself , by having vague impressions of its nature . ”

119312	119488	119302	119302	he	3291	“ have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in seclusion , written with a stern passion and power that rendered it unlike all other letters I have ever read . It was written to me ( as it told me in so many words ) , perhaps , because it was the writer 's idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me ; perhaps , because it was mine to justify it . It told me of a child , an orphan girl then twelve years old , in some such cruel words as those which live in your remembrance . It told me that the writer had bred her in secresy from her birth , had blotted out all trace of her existence , and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman , she would be left entirely friendless , nameless , and unknown . It asked me , to consider if I would , in that case , finish what the writer had begun ? ”
119500	119573	119498	119498	him	3292	“ Your early recollection , my dear , will supply the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer , and the distorted religion which clouded her mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she was quite innocent . I felt concerned for the little creature , in her darkened life ; and replied to the letter . ”

I accredited Mr. Kenge . The lady said , of her own accord , and not of his seeking , that her name was an assumed one . That she was , if there were any ties of blood in such a case , the child 's aunt . That more than this she would never ( and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution ) , for any human consideration , disclose . My dear , I have told you all . ”

Because I gave eight pounds odd ( or whatever it was ) for a certain neat waistcoat and buttons a few days ago . Now , if I had stayed at Badger 's I should have been obliged to spend twelve pounds at a blow , for some heart - breaking lecture - fees . So I make four pounds — in a lump — by the transaction ! ”

122276	122284	122286	122287	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ The oddity of the thing is , ”
122297	122403	122286	122287	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ that my chairs and tables were not paid for , and yet my landlord walks off with them as composedly as possible . Now , that seems droll ! There is something grotesque in it . The chair and table merchant never engaged to pay my landlord my rent . Why should my landlord quarrel with him ? If I have a pimple on my nose which is disagreeable to my landlord 's peculiar ideas of beauty , my landlord has no business to scratch my chair and table merchant 's nose , which has no pimple on it . His reasoning seems defective ! ”
122404	122407	122409	122410	my guardian	9683	“ Well , ”
122416	122437	122409	122410	my guardian	9683	“ it 's pretty clear that whoever became security for those chairs and tables will have to pay for them . ”
122438	122441	122443	122444	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Exactly ! ”
122446	122510	122443	122444	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ That 's the crowning point of unreason in the business ! I said to my landlord , ‘ My good man , you are not aware that my excellent friend Jarndyce will have to pay for those things that you are sweeping off in that indelicate manner . Have you no consideration for his property ? ’ He had n't the least . ”
122511	122517	122519	122520	my guardian	9683	“ And refused all proposals ? ”
122522	122527	122519	122520	my guardian	9683	“ Refused all proposals , ”
122532	122819	122529	122530	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ I made him business proposals . I had him into my room . I said , ‘ You are a man of business , I believe ? ’ He replied , ‘ I am . ’ ‘ Very well , ’ said I , ‘ now let us be business - like . Here is an inkstand , here are pens and paper , here are wafers . What do you want ? I have occupied your house for a considerable period , I believe to our mutual satisfaction until this unpleasant misunderstanding arose ; let us be at once friendly and business - like . What do you want ? ’ In reply to this , he made use of the figurative expression — which has something Eastern about it — that he had never seen the colour of my money . ‘ My amiable friend , ’ said I , ‘ I never have any money . I never know anything about money . ’ ‘ Well , sir , ’ said he , ‘ what do you offer , if I give you time ? ’ ‘ My good fellow , ’ said I , ‘ I have no idea of time ; but , you say you are a man of business , and whatever you can suggest to be done in a business - like way with pen , and ink , and paper — and wafers — I am ready to do . Do n't pay yourself at another man 's expense ( which is foolish ) , but be business - like ! ’ However , he would n't be , and there was an end of it . ”
123159	123163	123165	123165	he	403	“ By Heaven ! ”
123174	123224	123165	123165	he	403	“ this is a most infamous coach . It is the most flagrant example of an abominable public vehicle that ever encumbered the face of the earth . It is twenty - five minutes after its time , this afternoon . The coachman ought to be put to death ! ”
123225	123232	123234	123235	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Is he after his time ? ”
123245	123251	123234	123235	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You know my infirmity . ”

123273	123326	123265	123266	Mr. Boythorn	403	“ With two ladies in the coach , this scoundrel has deliberately delayed his arrival six - and - twenty minutes . Deliberately ! It is impossible that it can be accidental ! But his father — and his uncle — were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . ”
123357	123364	123365	123365	he	403	“ I am sorry , ladies , ”
123383	123452	123365	123365	he	403	“ that I am obliged to conduct you nearly two miles out of the way . But , our direct road lies through Sir Leicester Dedlock 's park ; and , in that fellow 's property , I have sworn never to set foot of mine , or horse 's foot of mine , pending the present relations between us , while I breathe the breath of life ! ”
123483	123492	123494	123495	my guardian	9683	“ Are the Dedlocks down here , Lawrence ? ”
123513	123520	123522	123523	Mr. Boythorn	403	“ Sir Arrogant Numskull is here , ”
123525	123554	123522	123523	Mr. Boythorn	403	“ Ha ha ha ! Sir Arrogant is here , and , I am glad to say , has been laid by the heels here . My lady , ”
123577	123640	123522	123523	Mr. Boythorn	403	“ is expected , I believe , daily . I am not in the least surprised that she postpones her appearance as long as possible . Whatever can have induced that transcendant woman to marry that effigy and figure - head of a baronet , is one of the most impenetrable mysteries that ever baffled human inquiry . Ha ha ha ha ! ”
123641	123645	123647	123648	my guardian	9683	“ I suppose , ”
123651	123675	123647	123648	my guardian	9683	“ we may set foot in the park while we are here ? The prohibition does not extend to us , does it ? ”
123676	123686	123687	123687	he	403	“ I can lay no prohibition on my guests , ”
123709	123837	123687	123687	he	403	“ except in the matter of their departure . I am only sorry that I can not have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold , which is a very fine place ! But , by the light of this summer day , Jarndyce , if you call upon the owner , while you stay with me , you are likely to have but a cool reception . He carries himself like an eight - day clock at all times ; like one of a race of eight - day clocks in gorgeous cases that never go and never went — Ha ha ha!—but he will have some extra stiffness , I can promise you , for the friends of his friend and neighbour Boythorn ! “
123847	123852	123853	123853	He	3378	” said my guardian . “
123907	123908	123941	123946	a second Ajax defying the lightning	3382	” “
123911	123916	123941	123946	a second Ajax defying the lightning	3382	” said Mr. Boythorn , “
124032	124359	124007	124007	he	3378	” Our coming to the ridge of a hill we had been ascending , enabled our friend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us , and diverted his attention from its master . It was a picturesque old house , in a fine park richly wooded . Among the trees , and not far from the residence , he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken . O , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly , as if Heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air ; the smooth green slopes , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours , how beautiful they looked ! The house , with gable , and chimney , and tower , and turret , and dark doorway , and broad terrace - walk , twining among the balustrades of which , and lying heaped upon the vases , there was one great flush of roses , seemed scarcely real in its light solidity , and in the serene and peaceful hush that rested all around it . To Ada and to me , that , above all , appeared the pervading influence . On everything , house , garden , terrace , green slopes , water , old oaks , fern , moss , woods again , and far away across the openings in the prospect , to the distance lying wide before us with a purple bloom upon it , there seemed to be such undisturbed repose . When we came into the little village , and passed a small inn with the sign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front , Mr. Boythorn interchanged greetings with a young gentleman sitting on a bench outside the inn - door , who had some fishing - tackle lying beside him . “
124372	124376	124378	124378	he	3390	” said he ; “
124482	124483	124485	124485	he	3390	” “
124495	124499	124492	124493	Mr. Boythorn	403	” asked Ada . “
124507	124511	124504	124505	Miss Clare	319	” he returned , “
124548	125035	124544	124544	you	319	” Ada blushed ; and Mr. Boythorn , trotting forward on his comely gray horse , dismounted at his own door , and stood ready , with extended arm and uncovered head , to welcome us when we arrived . He lived in a pretty house , formerly the Parsonage - house , with a lawn in front , a bright flower - garden at the side , and a well - stocked orchard and kitchen - garden in the rear , enclosed with a venerable wall that had of itself a ripened ruddy look . But , indeed , everything about the place wore an aspect of maturity and abundance . The old lime - tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry - trees and apple - trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry - bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall . Tumbled about among the spread nets and the glass frames sparkling and winking in the sun , there were such heaps of drooping pods , and marrows , and cucumbers , that every foot of ground appeared a vegetable treasury , while the smell of sweet herbs and all kinds of wholesome growth ( to say nothing of the neighbouring meadows where the hay was carrying ) made the whole air a great nosegay . Such stillness and composure reigned within the orderly precincts of the old red wall , that even the feathers hung in garlands to scare the birds hardly stirred ; and the wall had such a ripening influence that where , here and there high up , a disused nail and scrap of list still clung to it , it was easier to fancy that they had mellowed with the changing seasons , than that they had rusted and decayed according to the common fate . The house , though a little disorderly in comparison with the garden , was a real old house , with settles in the chimney of the brick - floored kitchen , and great beams across the ceilings . On one side of it was the terrible piece of ground in dispute , where Mr. Boythorn maintained a sentry in a smock - frock , day and night , whose duty was supposed to be , in case of aggression , immediately to ring a large bell hung up there for the purpose , to unchain a great bull - dog established in a kennel as his ally , and generally to deal destruction on the enemy . Not content with these precautions , Mr. Boythorn had himself composed and posted there , on painted boards to which his name was attached in large letters , the following solemn warnings : “
125051	125052	125048	125049	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” “
125063	125064	125060	125061	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” “
125087	125088	125084	125085	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” “
125129	125155	125126	125127	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” These he showed us , from the drawing - room window , while his bird was hopping about his head ; and he laughed , “
125166	125186	125126	125127	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” to that extent as he pointed them out , that I really thought he would have hurt himself . “
125198	125207	125126	125127	Lawrence Boythorn	403	” said Mr. Skimpole in his light way , “
125217	125218	125209	125209	you	403	” “
125223	125231	125209	125209	you	403	” returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth . “
125321	125755	125311	125311	I	0	” We arrived at his house on a Saturday . On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park . Entering the park , almost immediately by the disputed ground , we pursued a pleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful trees , until it brought us to the church porch . The congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one , with the exception of a large muster of servants from the House , some of whom were already in their seats , while others were yet dropping in . There were some stately footmen ; and there was a perfect picture of an old coachman , who looked as if he were the official representative of all the pomps and vanities that had ever been put into his coach . There was a very pretty show of young women ; and above them , the handsome old face and fine responsible portly figure of the housekeeper , towered pre - eminent . The pretty girl , of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us , was close by her . She was so very pretty , that I might have known her by her beauty , even if I had not seen how blushingly conscious she was of the eyes of the young fisherman , whom I discovered not far off . One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of everyone and everything there . It was a Frenchwoman 's . As the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come , I had leisure to glance over the church , which smelt as earthy as a grave , and to think what a shady , ancient , solemn little church it was . The windows , heavily shaded by trees , admitted a subdued light that made the faces around me pale , and darkened the old brasses in the pavement , and the time and damp - worn monuments , and rendered the sunshine in the little porch , where a monotonous ringer was working at the bell , inestimably bright . But a stir in that direction , a gathering of reverential awe in the rustic faces , and a blandly - ferocious assumption on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being resolutely unconscious of somebody 's existence , forewarned me that the great people were come , and that the service was going to begin . “
125774	126489	126490	126490	He	3411	” Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , occasioned by the look I met , as I stood up ! Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor , and to hold mine ! It was only a moment before I cast mine down — released again , if I may say so — on my book ; but , I knew the beautiful face quite well , in that short space of time . And , very strangely , there was something quickened within me , associated with the lonely days at my godmother 's ; yes , away even to the days when I had stood on tiptoe to dress myself at my little glass , after dressing my doll . And this , although I had never seen this lady 's face before in all my life — I was quite sure of it — absolutely certain . It was easy to know that the ceremonious , gouty , grey - haired gentleman , the only other occupant of the great pew , was Sir Leicester Dedlock ; and that the lady was Lady Dedlock . But why her face should be , in a confused way , like a broken glass to me , in which I saw scraps of old remembrances ; and why I should be so fluttered and troubled ( for I was still ) , by having casually met her eyes ; I could not think . I felt it to be an unmeaning weakness in me , and I tried to overcome it by attending to the words I heard . Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader 's voice , but in the well - remembered voice of my godmother . This made me think , did Lady Dedlock 's face accidentally resemble my godmother 's ? It might be that it did , a little ; but , the expression was so different , and the stern decision which had worn into my godmother 's face , like weather into rocks , was so completely wanting in the face before me , that it could not be that resemblance which had struck me . Neither did I know the loftiness and haughtiness of Lady Dedlock 's face , at all , in any one . And yet I — I , little Esther Summerson , the child who lived a life apart , and on whose birth - day there was no rejoicing — seemed to arise before my own eyes , evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady , whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen , but whom I perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour . It made me tremble so , to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation , that I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of the French maid , though I knew she had been looking watchfully here , and there , and everywhere , from the moment of her coming into the church . By degrees , though very slowly , I at last overcame my strange emotion . After a long time , I looked towards Lady Dedlock again . It was while they were preparing to sing , before the sermon . She took no heed of me , and the beating at my heart was gone . Neither did it revive for more than a few moments , when she once or twice afterwards glanced at Ada or at me through her glass . The service being concluded , Sir Leicester gave his arm with much state and gallantry to Lady Dedlock — though he was obliged to walk by the help of a thick stick — and escorted her out of church to the pony carriage in which they had come . The servants then dispersed , and so did the congregation : whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along ( Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn 's infinite delight ) , as if he were a considerable landed proprietor in Heaven . “
126495	126500	126501	126501	He	3411	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
126521	126522	126524	126524	you	3415	” “
126527	126538	126524	126524	you	3415	” pursued Mr. Skimpole , very unexpectedly to Mr. Boythorn , “
126552	126553	126546	126550	a man of that sort	3416	” “
126557	126562	126565	126565	he	3411	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
126571	126576	126565	126565	he	3411	” pursued Mr. Skimpole . “
126585	126586	126587	126587	I	0	” “
126590	126599	126601	126601	you	3415	” said Mr. Boythorn , with great vigor . “
126604	126615	126601	126601	you	3415	” returned Mr. Skimpole , in his easy light vein . “
126828	126829	126825	126826	a child	976	” “
126841	126846	126832	126832	you	3423	” said Mr. Boythorn , “
126864	126865	126896	126898	My esteemed Boythorn’—to	3426	” “
126869	126884	126896	126898	My esteemed Boythorn’—to	3426	” said Mr. Skimpole , with an appearance of the utmost simplicity and candor . “
126985	126986	126976	126976	Boythorn	403	” “
126994	127005	126990	126990	Boythorn	403	” returned our host , swelling and growing very red , “
127010	127011	127012	127012	I	0	” “
127015	127020	127023	127023	he	403	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
127026	127027	127023	127023	he	403	” “
127036	127056	127058	127058	he	403	” cried Mr. Boythorn , in a violent burst , and stopping to strike his stick upon the ground . “
127077	127078	127058	127058	he	403	” “
127089	127104	127081	127082	Harold Skimpole	358	” he returned in his gayest manner , and with his most ingenuous smile , “
127208	127387	127200	127200	I	0	” This was one of many little dialogues between them , which I always expected to end , and which I dare say would have ended under other circumstances , in some violent explosion on the part of our host . But , he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our entertainer , and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr. Skimpole , as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long , that matters never went beyond this point . Mr. Skimpole , who always seemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground , then betook himself to beginning some sketch in the park which he never finished , or to playing fragments of airs on the piano , or to singing scraps of songs , or to lying down on his back under a tree , and looking at the sky — which he could n't help thinking , he said , was what he was meant for ; it suited him so exactly . “
127392	127404	127200	127200	I	0	” he would say to us ( on his back ) , “
127615	128209	127595	127595	I	0	” I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children , and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind . So far as I could understand , they rarely presented themselves at all . The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church ; and every day had been so bright and blue , that to ramble in the woods , and to see the light striking down among the transparent leaves , and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the shadows of the trees , while the birds poured out their songs , and the air was drowsy with the hum of insects , had been most delightful . We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year 's leaves , where there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped off . Seated among these , we looked through a green vista supported by thousands of natural columns , the whitened stems of trees , upon a distant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in which we sat , and made so precious by the arched perspective through which we saw it , that it was like a glimpse of the better land . Upon the Saturday we sat here , Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and I , until we heard thunder muttering in the distance , and felt the large rain - drops rattle through the leaves . The weather had been all the week extremely sultry ; but , the storm broke so suddenly — upon us , at least , in that sheltered spot — that before we reached the outskirts of the wood , the thunder and lightning were frequent , and the rain came plunging through the leaves , as if every drop were a great leaden bead . As it was not a time for standing among trees , we ran out of the wood , and up and down the moss - grown steps which crossed the plantation - fence like two broad - staved ladders placed back to back , and made for a keeper 's lodge which was close at hand . We had often noticed the dark beauty of this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees , and how the ivy clustered over it , and how there was a steep hollow near , where we had once seen the keeper 's dog dive down into the fern as if it were water . The lodge was so dark within , now the sky was overcast , that we only clearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there , and put two chairs for Ada and me . The lattice - windows were all thrown open , and we sat , just within the doorway , watching the storm . It was grand to see how the wind awoke , and bent the trees , and drove the rain before it like a cloud of smoke ; and to hear the solemn thunder , and to see the lightning ; and , while thinking with awe of the tremendous powers by which our little lives are encompassed , to consider how beneficent they are , and how upon the smallest flower and leaf there was already a freshness poured from all this seeming rage , which seemed to make creation new again . “
128222	128223	127595	127595	I	0	” “
128230	128351	128352	128352	I	0	” said Ada , quietly . Ada said it to me ; but , I had not spoken . The beating at my heart came back again . I had never heard the voice , as I had never seen the face , but it affected me in the same strange way . Again , in a moment , there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself . Lady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge , before our arrival there , and had come out of the gloom within . She stood behind my chair , with her hand upon it . I saw her with her hand close to my shoulder , when I turned my head . “
128357	128374	128352	128352	I	0	” she said . No . It was not fright . Why should I be frightened ! “
128378	128386	128352	128352	I	0	” said Lady Dedlock to my guardian , “
128397	128398	128394	128395	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
128415	128419	128399	128399	Your	0	” he returned . “
128467	128468	128469	128469	I	0	” “
128476	128484	128469	128469	I	0	” returned my guardian with a smile , “
128490	128586	128588	128590	the young gentleman	1269	” She had given him her hand , in an indifferent way that seemed habitual to her , and spoke in a correspondingly indifferent manner , though in a very pleasant voice . She was as graceful as she was beautiful ; perfectly self - possessed ; and had the air , I thought , of being able to attract and interest any one , if she had thought it worth her while . The keeper had brought her a chair , on which she sat , in the middle of the porch between us . “
128622	128634	128635	128635	I	0	” she said , over her shoulder , to my guardian . “
128639	128696	128635	128635	I	0	” said he . She seemed to respect him , and even to wish to conciliate him . There was something very winning in her haughty manner ; and it became more familiar — I was going to say more easy , but that could hardly be — as she spoke to him over her shoulder . “
128708	128716	128705	128706	Miss Clare	319	” He presented Ada , in form . “
128729	128742	128705	128706	Miss Clare	319	” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce , over her shoulder again , “
128758	128766	128756	128756	me	0	” and she turned full upon me , “
128773	128774	128756	128756	me	0	” “
128782	128787	128788	128788	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
128799	128800	128792	128794	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” “
128809	128814	128792	128794	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” said my Lady . “
128817	128818	128792	128794	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” “
128827	128874	128824	128825	her guardian	9629	” Lady Dedlock looked at me , and I looked at her , and said I was indeed . All at once she turned from me with a hasty air , almost expressive of displeasure or dislike , and spoke to him over her shoulder again . “
128890	128891	128887	128888	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
128913	128917	128907	128907	I	0	” he returned . “
128936	128944	128921	128921	you	0	” she said , with some disdain . “
128954	128955	128945	128945	I	0	” “
128965	128970	128956	128956	You	0	” said my guardian , “
128988	128989	128962	128963	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
128993	129000	128962	128963	Lady Dedlock	288	” she repeated , slightly laughing . “
129003	129072	128962	128963	Lady Dedlock	288	” With her air of superiority , and power , and fascination , and I know not what , she seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than children . So , as she slightly laughed , and afterwards sat looking at the rain , she was as self - possessed , and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts she had been alone . “
129092	129101	129075	129075	you	0	” she said , looking at him again . “
129110	129114	129108	129108	oftener	3452	” he returned . “
129121	129126	129115	129115	We	3451	” said Lady Dedlock , “
129155	129228	129229	129230	The messenger	3453	” Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain . The storm soon began to pass upon its way . The shower greatly abated , the lightning ceased , the thunder rolled among the distant hills , and the sun began to glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain . As we sat there , silently , we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry pace . “
129238	129243	129229	129230	The messenger	3453	” said the keeper , “
129248	129306	129229	129230	The messenger	3453	” As it drove up , we saw that there were two people inside . There alighted from it , with some cloaks and wrappers , first the Frenchwoman whom I had seen in church , and secondly the pretty girl ; the Frenchwoman , with a defiant confidence ; the pretty girl , confused and hesitating . “
129310	129315	129229	129230	The messenger	3453	” said Lady Dedlock . “
129318	129319	129320	129320	I	0	” “
129332	129337	129325	129326	my Lady	996	” said the Frenchwoman . “
129345	129346	129342	129343	the attendant	3458	” “
129358	129364	129350	129350	you	996	” said the pretty girl . “
129372	129379	129370	129370	child	9043	” replied her mistress , calmly . “
129386	129421	129370	129370	child	9043	” She slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it , and the pretty girl lightly dropped it in its place . The Frenchwoman stood unnoticed , looking on with her lips very tightly set . “
129426	129434	129370	129370	child	9043	” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyee , “
129466	129520	129446	129446	You	0	” But , as he would on no account accept this offer , she took a graceful leave of Ada — none of me — and put her hand upon his proffered arm , and got into the carriage ; which was a little , low , park carriage , with a hood . “
129526	129534	129446	129446	You	0	” she said to the pretty girl , “
129543	129658	129660	129662	that young woman	3466	” The carriage rolled away ; and the Frenchwoman , with the wrappers she had brought hanging over her arm , remained standing where she had alighted . I suppose there is nothing Pride can so little bear with , as Pride itself , and that she was punished for her imperious manner . Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined . She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive , and then , without the least discomposure of countenance , slipped off her shoes , left them on the ground , and walked deliberately in the same direction , through the wettest of the wet grass . “
129665	129670	129660	129662	that young woman	3466	” said my guardian . “
129676	129692	129660	129662	that young woman	3466	” said the keeper , who , with his wife , was looking after her . “
129750	129751	129742	129742	she	448	” “
129765	129770	129755	129755	she	448	” said my guardian . “
129785	129790	129755	129755	she	448	” said the man . “
129799	129804	129793	129793	she	448	” said the woman . “
129825	130536	129816	129816	I	0	” We passed not far from the House , a few minutes afterwards . Peaceful as it had looked when we first saw it , it looked even more so now , with a diamond spray glittering all about it , a light wind blowing , the birds no longer hushed but singing strongly , everything refreshed by the late rain , and the little carriage shining at the doorway like a fairy carriage made of silver . Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went Mademoiselle Hortense , shoeless , through the wet grass . IT is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane . The good ships Law and Equity , those teak - built , copper - bottomed , iron - fastened , brazened - faced , and not by any means fast - sailing Clippers , are laid up in ordinary . The Flying Dutchman , with a crew of ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse their papers , has drifted , for the time being , Heaven knows where . The Courts are all shut up ; the public offices lie in a hot sleep ; Westminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might sing , and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there , walk . The Temple , Chancery Lane , Serjeants ' Inn , and Lincoln 's Inn even unto the Fields , are like tidal harbors at low water ; where stranded proceedings , offices at anchor , idle clerks lounging on lop - sided stools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of Term sets in , lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation . Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the Porter 's Lodge by the bushel . A crop of grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside Lincoln 's Inn Hall , but that the ticket - porters , who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there , with their white aprons over their heads to keep the flies off , grub it up and eat it thoughtfully . There is only one Judge in town . Even he only comes twice a - week to sit in chambers . If the country folks of those assize towns on his circuit could only see him now ! No full - bottomed wig , no red petticoats , no fur , no javelin - men , no white wands . Merely a close - shaved gentleman in white trousers and a white hat , with sea - bronze on the judicial countenance , and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays from the judicial nose , who calls in at the shell - fish shop as he comes along , and drinks iced ginger - beer ! The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth . How England can get on through four long summer months without its bar — which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity , and its only legitimate triumph in prosperity — is beside the question ; assuredly that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear . The learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party , that he never seems likely to recover it , is doing infinitely better than might be expected , in Switzerland . The learned gentleman who does the withering business , and who blights all opponents with his gloomy sarcasm , is as merry as a grig at a French watering - place . The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the smallest provocation , has not shed a tear these six weeks . The very learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery complexion in pools and fountains of law , until he has become great in knotty arguments for Term - time , when he poses the drowsy Bench with legal “
130539	131225	129816	129816	I	0	” inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the initiated too , is roaming , with a characteristic delight in aridity and dust , about Constantinople . Other dispersed fragments of the same great Palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice , at the second cataract of the Nile , in the baths of Germany , and sprinkled on the seasand all over the English coast . Scarcely one is to be encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane . If such a lonely member of the bar do flit across the waste , and come upon a prowling suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety , they frighten one another , and retreat into opposite shades . It is the hottest long vacation known for many years . All the young clerks are madly in love , and , according to their various degrees , pine for bliss with the beloved object , at Margate , Ramsgate , or Gravesend . All the middle - aged clerks think their families too large . All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court , and pant about staircases and other dry places , seeking water , give short howls of aggravation . All the blind mens ' dogs in the streets draw their masters against pumps , or trip them over buckets . A shop with a sun - blind , and a watered pavement , and a bowl of gold and silver fish in the window , is a sanctuary . Temple Bar gets so hot , that it is , to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street , what a heater is in an urn , and keeps them simmering all night . There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool , if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dulness ; but , the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze . In Mr. Krook 's court , it is so hot that the people turn their houses inside out , and sit in chairs upon the pavement — Mr. Krook included , who there pursues his studies , with his cat ( who never is too hot ) by his side . The Sol 's Arms has discontinued the harmonic meetings for the season , and Little Swills is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river , where he comes out in quite an innocent manner , and sings comic ditties of a juvenile complexion , calculated ( as the bill says ) not to wound the feelings of the most fastidious mind . Over all the legal neighbourhood , there hangs , like some great veil of rust , or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation . Mr. Snagsby , law - stationer of Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , is sensible of the influence ; not only in his mind as a sympathetic and contemplative man , but also in his business as a law - stationer aforesaid . He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard , during the long vacation , than at other seasons ; and he says to the two ' prentices , what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island , with the sea a rolling and a bowling right round you . Guster is busy in the little drawing - room , on this present afternoon in the long vacation , when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in contemplation to receive company . The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband , and no more . From Mr. Chadband 's being much given to describe himself , both verbally and in writing , as a vessel , he is occasionally mistaken by strangers for a gentleman connected with navigation ; but , he is , as he expresses it , “
131230	131328	131329	131329	My	0	” Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular denomination ; and is considered by his persecutors to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his volunteering , on his own account , at all incumbent on his conscience ; but , he has his followers , and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number . Mrs. Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel , Chadband ; and her attention was attracted to that Bark A 1 , when she was something flushed by the hot weather . “
131333	131344	131348	131348	her	2329	” says Mr. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn , “
131356	131559	131348	131348	her	2329	” So , Guster , much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the handmaid of Chadband , whom she knows to be endowed with the gift of holding forth for four hours at a stretch , prepares the little drawing - room for tea . All the furniture is shaken and dusted , the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth , the best tea - service is set forth , and there is excellent provision made of dainty new bread , crusty twists , cool fresh butter , thin slices of ham , tongue and German sausage , and delicate little rows of anchovies nestling in parsley ; not to mention new laid eggs , to be brought up warm in a napkin , and hot buttered toast . For , Chadband is rather a consuming vessel — the persecutors say a gorging vessel ; and can wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork , remarkably well . Mr. Snagsby in his best coat , looking at all the preparations when they are completed , and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand , says to Mrs. Snagsby , “
131574	131575	131568	131569	Mrs. Chadband	532	” “
131579	131595	131568	131569	Mrs. Chadband	532	” says Mrs. Snagsby . Mr. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way , that “
131601	131602	131568	131569	Mrs. Chadband	532	” “
131612	131643	131604	131604	you	2329	” is Mrs. Snagsby 's reproachful remark . Mr. Snagsby does look as if he would like it very much , but he says , with his cough of mildness , “
131657	131658	131651	131651	I	0	” “
131663	131668	131651	131651	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby , “
131672	131673	131651	131651	I	0	” “
131680	131685	131651	131651	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
131729	131730	131651	131651	I	0	” “
131737	131744	131651	131651	I	0	” Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity . “
131757	131758	131754	131755	a fighter	3480	” “
131766	131889	131890	131890	Mr.	3482	” says Mr. Snagsby . Here , Guster , who has been looking out of the bed - room window , comes rustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular ghost , and , falling flushed into the drawing - room , announces that Mr. and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court . The bell at the inner door in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling , she is admonished by Mrs. Snagsby , on pain of instant reconsignment to her patron saint , not to omit the ceremony of announcement . Much discomposed in her nerves ( which were previously in the best order ) by this threat , she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to announce “
131901	132031	132032	132033	My friends	1617	” and retires conscience - stricken from the presence . Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man , with a fat smile , and a general appearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system . Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe - looking , silent woman . Mr. Chadband moves softly and cumbrously , not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright . He is very much embarrassed about the arms , as if they were inconvenient to him , and he wanted to grovel ; is very much in a perspiration about the head ; and never speaks without first putting up his great hand , as delivering a token to his hearers that he is going to edify them . “
132035	132040	132032	132033	My friends	1617	” says Mr. Chadband . “
132132	132159	132121	132121	I	0	” In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified , Mr. Snagsby thinks it expedient on the whole to say Amen , which is well received . “
132165	132170	132121	132121	I	0	” proceeds Mr. Chadband , “
132178	132206	132172	132172	I	0	” Guster presents herself . Mrs. Snagsby , in a spectral bass voice , and without removing her eyes from Chadband , says , with dread distinctness , “
132210	132211	132172	132172	I	0	” “
132217	132221	132172	132172	I	0	” says Chadband , “
132237	132244	132245	132257	one thousing seven hunderd and eighty - two . ” The spectral voice	11642	” Guster is heard unaccountably to murmur “
132254	132262	132245	132257	one thousing seven hunderd and eighty - two . ” The spectral voice	11642	” The spectral voice repeats more solemnly , “
132266	132267	132172	132172	I	0	” “
132273	132278	132279	132279	we	3494	” says Mr. Chadband , “
132288	132292	132293	132300	one thousing seven hunderd and eighty - two	3495	” Still Guster reiterates “
132302	132331	132293	132300	one thousing seven hunderd and eighty - two	3495	” Mr. Chadband , pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be persecuted , and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile , says , “
132342	132343	132340	132340	maiden	3497	” “
132370	132376	132360	132360	he	9019	” says Guster , breathless . “
132379	132384	132360	132360	he	9019	” returns Mrs. Chadband . “
132389	132393	132394	132394	he	9019	” Guster replied that “
132407	132433	132394	132394	he	9019	” Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are proceeding to grow shrill in indignation , when Mr. Chadband quiets the tumult by lifting up his hand . “
132437	132441	132394	132394	he	9019	” says he , “
132473	132493	132494	132494	you	1617	” While Mrs. Snagsby , drawing her breath , looks hard at Mr. Snagsby , as who should say , “
132499	132560	132496	132497	this Apostle	3502	” and while Mr. Chadband glows with humility and train oil , Mrs. Chadband pays the money . It is Mr. Chadband 's habit — it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed — to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items , and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions . “
132564	132568	132496	132497	this Apostle	3502	” says Chadband , “
132608	132645	132646	132647	My friends	1617	” With which remark , which appears from its sound to be an extract in verse , Mr. Chadband stalks to the table , and , before taking a chair , lifts up his admonitory hand . “
132649	132653	132646	132647	My friends	1617	” says he , “
132762	132766	132739	132740	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ No wings . ”
132777	132784	132774	132775	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ I say , my friends , ”
132798	132898	132900	132900	Chadband	533	“ why can we not fly ? Is it because we are calculated to walk ? It is . Could we walk , my friends , without strength ? We could not . What should we do without strength , my friends ? Our legs would refuse to bear us , our knees would double up , our ankles would turn over , and we should come to the ground . Then from whence , my friends , in a human point of view , do we derive the strength that is necessary to our limbs ? Is it , ”
132907	132972	132900	132900	Chadband	533	“ from bread in various forms , from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded untoe us by the cow , from the eggs which are laid by the fowl , from ham , from tongue , from sausage , and from such like ? It is . Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us ! ”
133246	133267	133237	133237	Guster	412	“ And being wanted in the — not to put too fine a point upon it — in the shop ! ”
133273	133286	133269	133270	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ perhaps this good company will excuse me for half a minute . ”
133312	133319	133321	133322	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ Why , bless my heart , ”
133324	133330	133321	133322	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ what 's the matter ! ”
133331	133335	133337	133338	the constable	3520	“ This boy , ”
133340	133353	133337	133338	the constable	3520	“ although he 's repeatedly told to , wo n't move on — ”
133354	133364	133366	133367	the boy	9518	“ I 'm always a moving on , sir , ”
133378	133411	133375	133375	his	9518	“ I 've always been a moving and a moving on , ever since I was born . Where can I possible move to , sir , more nor I do move ! ”
133412	133419	133421	133422	the constable	3520	“ He wo n't move on , ”
133443	133478	133421	133422	the constable	3520	“ although he has been repeatedly cautioned , and therefore I am obliged to take him into custody . He 's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know . He WON'T move on . ”
133479	133490	133492	133493	the boy	9518	“ O my eye ! Where can I move to ! ”
133516	133535	133537	133538	the constable	3520	“ Do n't you come none of that , or I shall make blessed short work of you ! ”
133546	133567	133537	133538	the constable	3520	“ My instructions are , that you are to move on . I have told you so five hundred times . ”
133568	133572	133574	133575	the boy	9518	“ But where ? ”
133577	133587	133589	133590	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ Well ! Really , constable , you know , ”
133606	133620	133598	133598	his	409	“ really , that does seem a question . Where , you know ? ”
133621	133630	133632	133633	the constable	3520	“ My instructions do n't go to that , ”
133635	133647	133632	133633	the constable	3520	“ My instructions are that this boy is to move on . ”
133819	133827	133829	133830	the constable	3520	“ The simple question is , sir , ”
133832	133844	133829	133830	the constable	3520	“ whether you know this boy . He says you do . ”
133855	133861	133829	133830	the constable	3520	“ No he do n't ! ”
133862	133869	133871	133872	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ My lit - tle woman ! ”
133879	133929	133871	133872	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ My love , permit me ! Pray have a moment 's patience , my dear . I do know something of this lad , and in what I know of him , I ca n't say that there 's any harm ; perhaps on the contrary , constable . ”
133950	133953	133955	133956	the constable	3520	“ Well ! ”
133958	134049	133955	133956	the constable	3520	“ so far , it seems , he had grounds for what he said . When I took him into custody up in Holborn , he said you knew him . Upon that , a young man who was in the crowd said he was acquainted with you , and you were a respectable housekeeper , and if I 'd call and make the enquiry he 'd appear . The young man do n't seem inclined to keep his word , but — Oh ! Here is the young man ! ”
134076	134095	134097	134098	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I was strolling away from the office just now , when I found this row going on , ”
134105	134125	134097	134098	Mr. Guppy	326	“ and as your name was mentioned , I thought it was right the thing should be looked into . ”
134126	134138	134140	134141	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ It was very good - natured of you , sir , ”
134143	134151	134140	134141	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ and I am obliged to you . ”
134168	134177	134179	134180	the constable	3520	“ Now , I know where you live , ”
134187	134213	134179	134180	the constable	3520	“ You live down in Tom - all - alone 's . That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? ”
134214	134228	134230	134230	Jo	440	“ I ca n't go and live in no nicer place , sir , ”
134232	134273	134230	134230	Jo	440	“ They would n't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live . Who ud go and let a nice innocent lodging to such a reg'lar one as me ! ”
134274	134284	134286	134287	the constable	3520	“ You are very poor , ai n't you ? ”
134289	134303	134305	134305	Jo	440	“ Yes , I am indeed , sir , wery poor in gin'ral , ”
134307	134326	134328	134329	the constable	3520	“ I leave you to judge now ! I shook these two half - crowns out of him , ”
134336	134345	134328	134329	the constable	3520	“ in only putting my hand upon him ! ”
134346	134356	134358	134358	Jo	440	“ They 're wot 's left , Mr. Sangsby , ”
134360	134508	134510	134510	Jo	440	“ out of a sov'ring as wos give me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to my crossin one night and asked to be showd this ' ere ouse and the ouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at , and the berrin ground wot he 's berrid in . She ses to me she ses ‘ are you the boy at the Inkwhich ? ’ she ses . I ses ‘ yes ’ I ses . She ses to me she ses ‘ can you show me all them places ? ’ I ses ‘ yes I can ’ I ses . And she ses to me ‘ do it ’ and I dun it and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it . And I an't had much of the sov'ring neither , ”
134516	134578	134510	134510	Jo	440	“ fur I had to pay five bob , down in Tom - all - alone 's , afore they 'd square it fur to giv me change , and then a young man he thieved another five while I was asleep and another boy he thieved ninepence and the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more on it . ”
134579	134599	134601	134602	the constable	3520	“ You do n't expect anybody to believe this , about the lady and the sovereign , do you ? ”
134611	134622	134624	134624	Jo	440	“ I do n't know as I do , sir , ”
134626	134649	134624	134624	Jo	440	“ I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist'ry on it . ’ “
134656	134664	134650	134650	You	3545	” the constable observes to the audience . “
134688	134689	134681	134681	you	409	” “
134692	134700	134681	134681	you	409	” cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs . “
134705	134710	134711	134711	Constable	11657	” pleads her husband . “
134730	134735	134722	134722	You	11657	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
134743	134749	134736	134736	I	0	” says the hapless Jo . “
134755	134760	134761	134761	You	11657	” observes the constable . “
134807	135147	135163	135163	cobbler	3551	” With this farewell hint , and pointing generally to the setting sun , as a likely place to move on to , the constable bids his auditors good afternoon ; and makes the echoes of Cook 's Court perform slow music for him as he walks away on the shady side , carrying his iron - bound hat in his hand for a little ventilation . Now , Jo 's improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company . Mr. Guppy , who has an enquiring mind in matters of evidence , and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation , takes that interest in the case , that he enters on a regular cross - examination of the witness , which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step up - stairs , and drink a cup of tea , if he will excuse the disarranged state of the tea - table , consequent on their previous exertions . Mr. Guppy yielding his assent to this proposal , Jo is requested to follow into the drawing - room doorway , where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a witness , patting him into this shape , that shape , and the other shape , like a butterman dealing with so much butter , and worrying him according to the best models . Nor is the examination unlike many such model displays , both in respect of its eliciting nothing , and of its being lengthy ; for , Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent , and Mrs. Snagsby feels , not only that it gratifies her inquisitive disposition , but that it lifts her husband 's establishment higher up in the law . During the progress of this keen encounter , the vessel Chadband , being merely engaged in the oil trade , gets aground , and waits to be floated off . “
135150	135155	135163	135163	cobbler	3551	” says Mr. Guppy , “
135191	135201	135202	135202	You	0	” Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby , who exclaims , “
135208	135212	135214	135215	Mrs. Chadband	532	” For years ! ”
135217	135228	135214	135215	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Has known Kenge and Carboy 's office for years , ”
135237	135250	135229	135230	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ Mrs. Chadband — this gentleman 's wife — Reverend Mr. Chadband . ”
135251	135256	135258	135259	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Oh , indeed ! ”
135261	135269	135271	135272	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Before I married my present husband , ”
135274	135284	135286	135287	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Was you a party in anything , ma'am ? ”
135295	135298	135310	135311	Mr. Guppy	326	“ No . ”
135299	135308	135310	135311	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Not a party in anything , ma'am ? ”
135319	135335	135310	135311	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something , ma'am ? ”
135354	135361	135363	135364	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Not exactly that , either , ”
135376	135383	135385	135386	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Not exactly that , either ! ”
135388	135451	135385	135386	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Very good . Pray , ma'am , was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some transactions ( we will not at present say what transactions ) with Kenge and Carboy 's office , or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance ? Take time , ma'am . We shall come to it presently . Man or woman , ma'am ? ”
135452	135455	135457	135458	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Neither , ”
135463	135469	135471	135472	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Oh ! A child ! ”
135492	135509	135385	135386	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Now , ma'am , perhaps you 'll have the kindness to tell us what child . ”
135510	135521	135523	135524	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ You have got at it at last , sir , ”
135533	135576	135523	135524	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Well , sir , it was before your time , most likely , judging from your appearance . I was left in charge of a child named Esther Summerson , who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and Carboy . ”
135577	135583	135585	135586	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Miss Summerson , ma'am ! ”
135590	135597	135599	135600	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ I call her Esther Summerson , ”
135605	135643	135599	135600	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ There was no Miss - ing of the girl in my time . It was Esther . ‘ Esther , do this ! Esther , do that ! ’ and she was made to do it . ”
135644	135649	135651	135652	Mr. Guppy	326	“ My dear ma'am , ”
135660	135702	135651	135652	Mr. Guppy	326	“ the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in London , when she first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded . Allow me to have the pleasure of taking you by the hand . ”
135736	135739	135733	135734	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ Hush ! ”
135740	135744	135746	135746	Chadband	532	“ My friends , ”
135748	135755	135746	135746	Chadband	532	“ we have partaken , in moderation ”
135771	135873	135874	135874	Jo	440	“ of the comforts which have been provided for us . May this house live upon the fatness of the land ; may corn and wine be plentiful therein ; may it grow , may it thrive , may it prosper , may it advance , may it proceed , may it press forward ! But , my friends , have we partaken of anything else ? We have . My friends , of what else have we partaken ? Of spiritual profit ? Yes . From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ? My young friend , stand forth ! ”
135909	135914	135916	135916	Chadband	532	“ My young friend , ”
135918	135954	135916	135916	Chadband	532	“ you are to us a pearl , you are to us a diamond , you are to us a gem , you are to us a jewel . And why , my young friend ? ”
135955	135961	135963	135963	Jo	440	“ I do n't know , ”
135965	135972	135916	135916	Chadband	532	“ I do n't know nothink . ”
135973	135978	135980	135980	Chadband	532	“ My young friend , ”
135982	136216	135980	135980	Chadband	532	“ it is because you know nothing that you are to us a gem and jewel . For what are you , my young friend ? Are you a beast of the field ? No . A bird of the air ? No . A fish of the sea or river ? No . You are a human boy , my young friend . A human boy . O glorious to be a human boy ! And why glorious , my young friend ? Because you are capable of receiving the lessons of wisdom , because you are capable of profiting by this discourse which I now deliver for your good , because you are not a stick , or a staff , or a stock , or a stone , or a post , or a pillar . O running stream of sparkling joy To be a soaring human boy ! And do you cool yourself in that stream now , my young friend ? No . Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now ? Because you are in a state of darkness , because you are in a state of obscurity , because you are in a state of sinfulness , because you are in a state of bondage . My young friend , what is bondage ? Let us , in a spirit of love , inquire . ”
136270	136274	136276	136277	Mr. Chadband	533	“ My friends , ”
136295	136379	136291	136291	he	533	“ it is right that I should be humbled , it is right that I should be tried , it is right that I should be mortified , it is right that I should be corrected . I stumbled , on Sabbath last , when I thought with pride of my three hours ' improving . The account is now favorably balanced ; my creditor has accepted a composition . O let us be joyful , joyful ! O let us be joyful ! ”
136389	136393	136395	136395	Chadband	533	“ My friends , ”
136404	136482	136395	136395	Chadband	533	“ I will not proceed with my young friend now . Will you come to - morrow , my young friend , and enquire of this good lady where I am to be found to deliver a discourse untoe you , and will you come like the thirsty swallow upon the next day , and upon the day after that , and upon the day after that , and upon many pleasant days , to hear discourses ? ”
136785	136788	136824	136824	He	326	“ move on ”
137605	137612	137559	137560	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Hip ! Gup - py ! ”
137613	137622	137624	137625	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Why , you do n't mean it ? ”
137629	137636	137637	137637	Small	541	“ Small ! Here 's Jobling ! ”
137651	137659	137661	137662	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Where have you sprung up from ? ”
137664	137708	137709	137709	Jobling	542	“ From the market - gardens down by Deptford . I ca n't stand it any longer . I must enlist . I say ! I wish you 'd lend me half - a - crown . Upon my soul I 'm hungry . ”
137732	137760	137661	137662	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I say ! Just throw out half - a - crown , if you have got one to spare . I want to get some dinner . ”
137761	137770	137772	137773	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Will you come and dine with me ? ”
137786	137796	137798	137798	Jobling	542	“ How long should I have to hold out ? ”
137800	137817	137819	137820	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Not half an hour . I am only waiting here , till the enemy goes , ”
137828	137832	137819	137820	Mr. Guppy	326	“ What enemy ? ”
137833	137847	137882	137882	he	542	“ A new one . Going to be articled . Will you wait ? ”
137848	137861	137863	137864	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime ? ”
137883	137889	137882	137882	he	542	“ ca n't stand it . ”
137890	137897	137899	137900	Mr. Guppy	326	“ You shall have the paper , ”
137902	137932	137899	137900	Mr. Guppy	326	“ He shall bring it down . But you had better not be seen about here . Sit on our staircase and read . It 's a quiet place . ”
137988	137996	137998	137999	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Well , and how are you ? ”
138006	138015	137998	137999	Mr. Guppy	326	“ So , so . How are you ? ”
138035	138040	138028	138029	Mr. Jobling	542	“ How is she ? ”
138051	138062	138063	138063	Jobling	542	“ Jobling , there are chords in the human mind — ”
138067	138073	138075	138076	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Any subject but that ! ”
138086	138094	138075	138076	Mr. Guppy	326	“ For there are chords , Jobling — ”
138128	138132	138142	138142	he	542	“ Return immediately . ”
138502	138505	138529	138529	he	542	“ bread , ”
138576	138584	138585	138585	Chick	538	“ What do you take , Chick ? ”
138596	138614	138621	138621	his	542	“ veal and ham and French beans — And do n't you forget the stuffing , Polly , ”
138953	138959	138961	138962	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Thank you , Guppy , ”
138964	138977	138961	138962	Mr. Jobling	542	“ I really do n't know but what I will take another . ”
139053	139062	139049	139050	Mr. Guppy	326	“ You are a man again , Tony ! ”
139063	139071	139073	139074	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Well , not quite , yet , ”
139076	139082	139073	139074	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Say , just born . ”
139083	139098	139049	139050	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Will you take any other vegetables ? Grass ? Peas ? Summer cabbage ? ”
139099	139105	139107	139108	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Thank you , Guppy , ”
139110	139124	139107	139108	Mr. Jobling	542	“ I really do n't know but what I will take summer cabbage . ”
139138	139144	139049	139050	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Without slugs , Polly ! ”
139149	139157	139159	139160	Mr. Jobling	542	“ I am growing up , Guppy , ”
139172	139178	139159	139160	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Glad to hear it . ”
139179	139191	139193	139194	Mr. Jobling	542	“ In fact , I have just turned into my teens , ”
139242	139247	139249	139250	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Now , Small , ”
139252	139260	139249	139250	Mr. Guppy	326	“ what would you recommend about pastry ? ”
139261	139265	139267	139268	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Marrow puddings , ”
139271	139276	139278	139279	Mr. Jobling	542	“ Aye , aye ! ”
139286	139312	139278	139279	Mr. Jobling	542	“ You 're there , are you ? Thank you , Guppy , I do n't know but what I will take a marrow pudding . ”
139346	139350	139343	139344	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ three Cheshires ; ”
139355	139360	139343	139344	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ three small rums . ”
139399	139415	139373	139373	his	542	“ I am grown up , now , Guppy . I have arrived at maturity . ”
139416	139424	139426	139427	Mr. Guppy	326	“ What do you think , now , ”
139429	139438	139426	139427	Mr. Guppy	326	“ about — you do n't mind Smallweed ? ”
139439	139457	139373	139373	his	542	“ Not the least in the world . I have the pleasure of drinking his good health . ”
139458	139464	139466	139467	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Sir , to you ! ”
139469	139480	139466	139467	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ I was saying , what do you think now , ”
139485	139489	139482	139483	Mr. Guppy	326	“ of enlisting ? “
139499	139504	139511	139511	Guppy	326	” returns Mr. Jobling , “
139555	139575	139576	139578	Ill so manger	3625	” says Mr. Jobling , pronouncing that word as if he meant a necessary fixture in an English stable . “
139604	139611	139576	139578	Ill so manger	3625	” Mr. Swallweed is decidedly of opinion “
139616	139617	139576	139578	Ill so manger	3625	” “
139625	139629	139619	139620	any man	3629	” pursues Jobling , “
139658	139667	139668	139669	Chesney Wold	49	” Mr. Smallweed corrects him — Chesney Wold . “
139721	139741	139714	139714	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling , taking a little rum - and - water with an air of desperate resignation ; “
139751	139752	139742	139742	I	0	” “
139768	139773	139774	139774	You	546	” remonstrates Mr. Guppy . “
139784	139785	139786	139786	Guppy	326	” “
139788	139793	139786	139786	Guppy	326	” says Mr. Jobling , “
139818	139843	139811	139811	I	0	” That very popular trust in flat things coming round ! Not in their being beaten round , or worked round , but in their “
139845	139858	139811	139811	I	0	” round ! As though a lunatic should trust in the world 's “
139860	139863	139864	139864	I	0	” triangular ! “
139878	139896	139864	139864	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling , with some vagueness of expression , and perhaps of meaning , too . “
140027	140028	140020	140020	You	3640	” “
140031	140036	140020	140020	You	3640	” Mr. Swallweed thinks . “
140063	140068	140055	140055	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling . “
140084	140101	140055	140055	I	0	” proceeds Mr. Jobling , after a defiant visit to his rum - and - water , “
140115	140172	140173	140173	Jobling	542	” Mr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation , to state what , in his opinion , a fellow can do . His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life , otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart . “
140175	140180	140181	140181	myself	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
140188	140194	140195	140195	Gentlemen	9023	” ( Mr. Smallweed modestly observes “
140198	140203	140195	140195	Gentlemen	9023	” and drinks . ) “
140219	140220	140217	140217	you	9019	” “
140227	140234	140238	140238	Guppy	326	” cries Mr. Jobling , bitterly . “
140244	140245	140240	140240	You	542	” “
140256	140262	140264	140264	you	542	” Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests . “
140271	140276	140264	140264	you	542	” says Mr. Guppy ; “
140303	140304	140300	140301	the stationer	10042	” “
140313	140318	140309	140311	such a stationer	3651	” returns Mr. Jobling . “
140332	140333	140325	140325	I	0	” “
140347	140352	140341	140341	I	0	” Mr. Guppy retorts . “
140423	140482	140393	140393	They	3654	” As it is Mr. Guppy 's perplexing way , with boastful misery to tempt his particular friends into this subject , and the moment they touch it , to turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the human mind ; both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall , by remaining silent . “
140488	140493	140393	140393	They	3654	” repeats Mr. Guppy , “
140577	140589	140572	140572	he	409	” Mr. Smallweed nods , and appears greedy to be sworn . “
140597	140602	140608	140608	Jobling	542	” says Mr. Guppy , “
140667	140690	140665	140665	Snagsby	409	” Mr. Jobling is about to interrupt , when the sagacious Smallweed checks him with a dry cough , and the words , “
140695	140696	140693	140693	Shakspeare	550	” “
140707	140712	140705	140705	Jobling	542	” says Mr. Guppy . “
140739	140753	140737	140737	Jobling	542	” says Mr. Guppy , in his encouraging cross - examination - tone , “
140767	140768	140756	140756	you	542	” “
140775	140780	140769	140769	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling . “
140796	140797	140791	140791	you	542	” “
140802	140807	140798	140798	Everybody	927	” says Mr. Jobling . “
140963	140980	140954	140954	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , who has suddenly lowered his voice , and become familiar again , “
141050	141051	141052	141052	You	542	” “
141058	141063	141064	141064	I	0	” Mr. Jobling begins . “
141067	141079	141064	141064	I	0	” returns Mr. Guppy , shrugging his shoulders with becoming modesty , “
141114	141122	141123	141124	A few	3676	” Mr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony , “
141126	141127	141123	141124	A few	3676	” “
141143	141148	141141	141141	Tony	546	” says Mr. Guppy , “
141292	141349	141279	141279	you	3678	” Mr. Jobling , Mr. Guppy , and Mr. Smallweed , all lean their elbows on the table , and their chins upon their hands , and look at the ceiling . After a time , they all drink , slowly lean back , put their hands in their pockets , and look at one another . “
141361	141370	141359	141359	Tony	546	” says Mr. Guppy , with a sigh . “
141380	141421	141374	141378	chords in the human mind	11779	” Expressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum and water , Mr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling , and informing him that , during the vacation and while things are slack , his purse , “
141434	141441	141374	141378	chords in the human mind	11779	” will be at his disposal . “
141449	141456	141374	141378	chords in the human mind	11779	” Mr. Guppy adds with emphasis , “
141467	141488	141489	141489	Guppy	326	” The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose , that Mr. Jobling says with emotion , “
141497	141505	141489	141489	Guppy	326	” Mr. Guppy presents it , saying , “
141515	141520	141521	141521	Guppy	326	” Mr. Jobling returns . “
141532	141537	141538	141538	Jobling	542	” Mr. Guppy replies , “
141543	141558	141538	141538	Jobling	542	” They then shake hands , and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner , “
141581	141582	141570	141570	I	0	” “
141590	141600	141602	141602	he	3688	” observes Mr. Guppy , in an incidental way . “
141605	141610	141602	141602	he	3688	” says Mr. Jobling . “
141625	141626	141619	141619	You	326	” “
141629	141634	141635	141635	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling , “
141665	141683	141656	141656	he	3688	” Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty ; several times returning to it with such remarks as , “
141696	141699	141700	141700	He	3688	” or , “
141715	141811	141711	141711	I	0	” However , the compact being virtually made , Mr. Guppy proposes to dispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home , as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay . Mr. Jobling approving , Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and conveys it out of the dining - rooms in the Guppy manner . He soon returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home , and that he has seen him through the shop - door , sitting in his back premises , sleeping , “
141816	141817	141711	141711	I	0	” “
141823	141828	141819	141819	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
141844	141866	141837	141837	Small	541	” Mr. Smallweed , compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash , instantly replies as follows : “
141958	142155	141952	141952	Polly	544	” Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations , Smallweed dismisses his friends with a cool nod , and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly , as opportunity may serve , and to read the daily papers : which are so very large in proportion to himself , shorn of his hat , that when he holds up The Times to run his eye over the columns , he seems to have retired for the night , and to have disappeared under the bedclothes . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop , where they find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock ; that is to say , breathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast , and quite insensible to any external sounds , or even to gentle shaking . On the table beside him , among the usual lumber , stand an empty gin bottle and a glass . The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor , that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors , look drunk . “
142160	142176	141952	141952	Polly	544	” says Mr. Guppy , giving the relaxed figure of the old man another shake . “
142184	142207	142182	142182	sir	9019	” But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes , with a spirituous heat smouldering in it . “
142225	142230	142209	142209	you	343	” says Mr. Guppy . “
142238	142245	142209	142209	you	343	” returns Jobling , rather alarmed , “
142261	142262	142257	142257	I	0	” “
142274	142283	142257	142257	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , shaking him again . “
142303	142360	142300	142300	your	343	” After much ado , he opens them , but without appearing to see his visitors , or any other objects . Though he crosses one leg on another , and folds his hands , and several times closes and opens his parched lips , he seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before . “
142369	142374	142361	142361	He	348	” says Mr. Guppy . “
142400	142446	142383	142383	I	0	” The old man still sits , often smacking his dry lips , without the least consciousness . After some minutes , he makes an attempt to rise . They help him up , and he staggers against the wall , and stares at them . “
142455	142464	142449	142449	you	343	” says Mr. Guppy , in some discomfiture . “
142487	142589	142590	142591	Your servant	3700	” The old man , in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy , or at nothing , feebly swings himself round , and comes with his face against the wall . So he remains for a minute or two , heaped up against it ; and then staggers down the shop to the front door . The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things , recovers him . He comes back pretty steadily , adjusting his fur - cap on his head , and looking keenly at them . “
142611	142612	142602	142602	I	0	” “
142620	142625	142602	142602	I	0	” responds Mr. Guppy . “
142641	142647	142639	142639	you	343	” says the suspicious Krook . “
142652	142683	142684	142684	I	0	” Mr. Guppy explains . The old man 's eye resting on the empty bottle , he takes it up , examines it , and slowly tilts it upside down . “
142687	142698	142684	142684	I	0	” he cries , like the Hobgoblin in the story . “
142706	142707	142699	142699	Somebody	1404	” “
142716	142721	142711	142711	we	3704	” says Mr. Guppy . “
142733	142734	142738	142738	I	0	” “
142741	142749	142751	142751	I	0	” cries Krook , in high glee . “
142782	142838	142778	142778	they	3707	” He so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy , that that gentleman , with a nod to his friend , accepts the trust , and hurries out and hurries in again with the bottle filled . The old man receives it in his arms like a beloved grandchild , and pats it tenderly . “
142844	142858	142841	142841	I	0	” he whispers , with his eyes screwed up , after tasting it , “
142872	142873	142874	142874	I	0	” “
142882	142887	142874	142874	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
142895	142916	142893	142893	sir	9019	” returns Krook , with another taste — and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame . “
142925	142992	142917	142917	You	0	” Taking advantage of this auspicious moment , Mr. Guppy presents his friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle , and states the object of their visit . Krook , with his bottle under his arm ( he never gets beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety ) , takes time to survey his proposed lodger , and seems to approve of him . “
143004	143008	143001	143002	young man	3714	” he says . “
143057	143844	143001	143002	young man	3714	” Commending the room after this manner , the old man takes them upstairs , where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be , and also containing some old articles of furniture which he has dug up from his inexhaustible stores . The terms are easily concluded — for the Lord Chancellor can not be hard on Mr. Guppy , associated as he is with Kenge and Carboy , Jarndyce and Jarndyce , and other famous claims on his professional consideration — and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then repair to Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected , and ( more important ) the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured . They then report progress to the eminent Smallweed , waiting at the office in his tall hat for that purpose , and separate ; Mr. Guppy explaining that he would terminate his little entertainment by standing treat at the play , but that there are chords in the human mind which would render it a hollow mockery . On the morrow , in the dusk of evening , Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook 's , by no means incommoded with luggage , and establishes himself in his new lodging ; where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep , as if they were full of wonder . On the following day Mr. Weevle , who is a handy good - for - nothing kind of young fellow , borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite , and a hammer of his landlord , and goes to work devising apologies for window - curtains , and knocking up apologies for shelves , and hanging up his two teacups , milkpot , and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks , like a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it . But what Mr. Weevle prizes most , of all his few possessions ( next after his light whiskers , for which he has an attachment that only whiskers can awaken in the breast of man ) , is a choice collection of copper - plate impressions from that truly national work , The Divinities of Albion , or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , representing ladies of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art , combined with capital , is capable of producing . With these magnificent portraits , unworthily confined in a band - box during his seclusion among the market - gardens , he decorates his apartment ; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy - dress , plays every variety of musical instrument , fondles every variety of dog , ogles every variety of prospect , and is backed up by every variety of flower - pot and balustrade , the result is very imposing . But , fashion is Mr. Weevle 's , as it was Tony Jobling 's weakness . To borrow yesterday 's paper from the Sol 's Arms of an evening , and read about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction , is unspeakable consolation to him . To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday , or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to - morrow , gives him a thrill of joy . To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is about , and means to be about , and what Galaxy marriages are on the tapis , and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation , is to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind . Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence , to the Galaxy portraits implicated ; and seems to know the originals , and to be known of them . For the rest he is a quiet lodger , full of handy shifts and devices as before mentioned , able to cook and clean for himself as well as to carpenter , and developing social inclinations after the shades of evening have fallen on the court . At those times , when he is not visited by Mr. Guppy , or by a small light in his likeness quenched in a dark hat , he comes out of his dull room — where he has inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink — and talks to Krook , or is “
143848	144470	143001	143002	young man	3714	” as they call it in the court , commendingly , with any one disposed for conversation . Wherefore , Mrs. Piper , who leads the court , is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins : Firstly , that if her Johnny was to have whiskers , she could wish 'em to be identically like that young man 's ; and secondly , Mark my words , Mrs. Perkins , ma'am , and do n't you be surprised Lord bless you , if that young man comes in at last for old Krook 's money ! IN a rather ill - favored and ill - savored neighbourhood , though one of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant , the Elfin Smallweed , christened Bartholomew , and known on the domestic hearth as Bart , passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and its contingencies have no claim . He dwells in a little narrow street , always solitary , shady , and sad , closely bricked in on all sides like a tomb , but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree , whose flavor is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of youth . There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several generations . Little old men and women there have been , but no child , until Mr. Smallweed 's grandmother , now living , became weak in her intellect , and fell ( for the first time ) into a childish state . With such infantine graces as a total want of observation , memory , understanding and interest , and an eternal disposition to fall asleep over the fire and into it , Mr. Smallweed 's grandmother has undoubtedly brightened the family . Mr. Smallweed 's grandfather is likewise of the party . He is in a helpless condition as to his lower , and nearly so as to his upper , limbs ; but his mind is unimpaired . It holds , as well as it ever held , the first four rules of arithmetic , and a certain small collection of the hardest facts . In respect of ideality , reverence , wonder , and other such phrenological attributes , it is no worse off than it used to be . Everything that Mr. Smallweed 's grandfather ever put away in his mind was a grub at first , and is a grub at last . In all his life he has never bred a single butterfly . The father of this pleasant grandfather , of the neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant , was a horny - skinned , two - legged , money - getting species of spider , who spun webs to catch unwary flies , and retired into holes until they were entrapped . The name of this old pagan 's God was Compound Interest . He lived for it , married it , died of it . Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all the loss was intended to have been on the other side , he broke something — something necessary to his existence ; therefore it could n't have been his heart — and made an end of his career . As his character was not good , and he had been bred at a Charity School , in a complete course , according to question and answer , of those ancient people the Amorites and Hittites , he was frequently quoted as an example of the failure of education . His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always preached of “
144473	144916	143001	143002	young man	3714	” early in life , and whom he made a clerk in a sharp scrivener 's office at twelve years old . There , the young gentleman improved his mind , which was of a lean and anxious character ; and , developing the family gifts , gradually elevated himself into the discounting profession . Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too begat a lean and anxious - minded son ; who , in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of Bartholomew and Judith Smallweed , twins . During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this family tree , the house of Smallweed , always early to go out and late to marry , has strengthened itself in its practical character , has discarded all amusements , discountenanced all story - books , fairy tales , fictions , and fables , and banished all levities whatsoever . Hence the gratifying fact , that it has had no child born to it , and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced , have been observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something depressing on their minds . At the present time , in the dark little parlor certain feet below the level of the street — a grim , hard , uncouth parlor , only ornamented with the coarsest of baize table - covers , and the hardest of sheet - iron tea - trays , and offering in its decorative character no bad allegorical representation of Grandfather Smallweed 's mind — seated in two black horsehair porter 's chairs , one on each side of the fire - place , the supernnuated Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed wile away the rosy hours . On the stove are a couple of trivets for the pots and kettles which it is Grandfather Smallweed 's usual occupation to watch , and projecting from the chimney - piece between them is a sort of brass gallows for roasting , which he also superintends when it is in action . Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed 's seat , and guarded by his spindle legs , is a drawer in his chair , reported to contain property to a fabulous amount . Beside him is a spare cushion , with which he is always provided , in order that he may have something to throw at the venerable partner of his respected age whenever she makes an allusion to money — a subject on which he is particularly sensitive . “
144922	144935	144936	144936	He	554	” Grandfather Smallweed enquires of Judy , Bart 's twin - sister . “
144942	144946	144936	144936	He	554	” says Judy . “
144957	144958	144936	144936	He	554	” “
144961	144962	144936	144936	He	554	” “
144974	144975	144966	144966	you	3718	” “
144979	144980	144966	144966	you	3718	” “
144983	144984	144966	144966	you	3718	” “
144988	144996	144966	144966	you	3718	”—(Loud on the part of Judy . ) “
144999	145004	144966	144966	you	3718	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
145008	145045	144966	144966	you	3718	” Grandmother Smallweed , who has been mumbling and shaking her head at the trivets , hearing figures mentioned , connects them with money , and screeches , like a horrible old parrot without any plumage , “
145052	145062	145064	145064	you	3718	” Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her . “
145069	145726	145727	145727	Charley	372	” says the good old man . The effect of this act of jaculation is twofold . It not only doubles up Mrs. Smallweed 's head against the side of her porter 's chair , and causes her to present , when extricated by her grand - daughter , a highly unbecoming state of cap , but the necessary exertion recoils on Mr. Smallweed himself , whom it throws back into his porter 's chair , like a broken puppet . The excellent old gentleman being , at these times , a mere clothes - bag with a black skull - cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his grand - daughter , of being shaken up like a great bottle , and poked and punched like a great bolster . Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the sharer of his life 's evening again sit fronting one another in their two porter 's chairs , like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on their post by the Black Serjeant , Death . Judy the twin is worthy company for these associates . She is so indubitably sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger , that the two kneaded into one would hardly make a young person of average proportions ; while she so happily exemplifies the before - mentioned family likeness to the monkey tribe , that , attired in a spangled robe and cap , she might walk about the table - land on the top of a barrel - organ without exciting much remark as an unusual specimen . Under existing circumstances , however , she is dressed in a plain , spare gown of brown stuff . Judy never owned a doll , never heard of Cinderella , never played at any game . She once or twice fell into children 's company when she was about ten years old , but the children could n't get on with Judy , and Judy could n't get on with them . She seemed like an animal of another species , and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides . It is very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh . She has so rarely seen the thing done , that the probabilities are strong the other way . Of anything like a youthful laugh , she certainly can have no conception . If she were to try one , she would find her teeth in her way ; modelling that action of her face , as she has unconsciously modelled all its other expressions , on her pattern of sordid age . Such is Judy . And her twin brother could n't wind up a top for his life . He knows no more of Jack the Giant Killer , or of Sinbad the Sailor , than he knows of the people in the stars . He could as soon play at leap - frog , or at cricket , as change into a cricket or a frog himself . But , he is so much the better off than his sister , that on his narrow world of fact an opening has dawned , into such broader regions as lie within the ken of Mr. Guppy . Hence , his admiration and his emulation of that shining enchanter . Judy , with a gong - like clash and clatter , sets one of the sheet - iron tea - trays on the table , and arranges cups and saucers . The bread she puts on in an iron basket ; and the butter ( and not much of it ) in a small pewter plate . Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as it is served out , and asks Judy where the girl is ? “
145733	145737	145730	145730	you	372	” says Judy . “
145740	145745	145746	145746	Charley	372	” from Grandfather Smallweed . “
145752	145771	145749	145749	you	372	” This touches a spring in Grandmother Smallweed who , chuckling , as usual , at the trivets , cries—“Over
145802	145825	145800	145800	Charley	372	” and becomes quite energetic about it . Grandfather looks at the cushion , but has not sufficiently recovered his late exertion . “
145828	145835	145800	145800	Charley	372	” he says , when there is silence—“if
145857	145882	145841	145841	She	3722	” Judy , with her brother 's wink , shakes her head , and purses up her mouth into No , without saying it . “
145885	145891	145841	145841	She	3722	” returns the old man . “
145895	145896	145897	145897	She	3722	” “
145913	145917	145897	145897	She	3722	” says Judy . “
145920	145953	145954	145954	You	372	” Judy answers with a nod of deepest meaning , and calls , as she scrapes the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste , and cuts it into slices , “
145961	146003	145959	145959	you	372	” Timidly obedient to the summons , a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet , with her hands covered with soap and water , and a scrubbing brush in one of them , appears , and curtseys . “
146011	146029	146007	146007	you	372	” says Judy , making an ancient snap at her , like a very sharp old beldame . “
146041	146045	146039	146039	miss	9100	” replies Charley . “
146070	146081	146082	146082	You	9100	” cries Judy , with a stamp upon the ground . “
146095	146144	146082	146082	You	9100	” On this severe matron , as she returns to her task of scraping the butter and cutting the bread , falls the shadow of her brother , looking in at the window . For whom , knife and loaf in hand , she opens the street door . “
146151	146156	146082	146082	You	9100	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
146163	146164	146082	146082	You	9100	” “
146169	146173	146166	146166	I	0	” says Bart . “
146183	146187	146181	146181	Bart	554	” Small nods . “
146195	146200	146193	146193	Bart	554	” Small nods again . “
146241	146333	146235	146235	you	554	” says the venerable sage . His grandson , without receiving this good counsel as dutifully as he might , honors it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight wink and a nod , and takes a chair at the tea - table . The four old faces then hover over tea - cups , like a company of ghastly cherubim ; Mrs. Smallweed perpetually twitching her head and chattering at the trivets , and Mr. Smallweed requiring to be repeatedly shaken up like a large black draught . “
146338	146352	146235	146235	you	554	” says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom . “
146384	146409	146378	146378	He	2685	” Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he was particularly pleasant to look at , on that account , does not appear . “
146416	146431	146432	146434	a good accountant	3733	” repeats the old gentleman , folding his bread and butter on his knee ; “
146442	146454	146410	146410	He	2685	” Mrs. Smallweed , following her usual instinct , breaks out with “
146481	146737	146758	146758	you	3734	” Her worthy husband , setting aside his bread and butter , immediately discharges the cushion at her , crushes her against the side of her chair , and falls back in his own , overpowered . His appearance , after visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing : firstly , because the exertion generally twists his black skull - cap over one eye and gives him an air of goblin rakishness ; secondly , because he mutters violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed ; and thirdly , because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure is suggestive of a baleful old malignant , who would be very wicked if he could . All this , however , is so common in the Smallweed family circle , that it produces no impression . The old gentleman is merely shaken , and has his internal feathers beaten up ; the cushion is restored to its usual place beside him ; and the old lady , perhaps with her cap adjusted , and perhaps not , is planted in her chair again , ready to be bowled down like a ninepin . Some time elapses , in the present instance , before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse ; and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets . As thus : “
146895	146979	146888	146888	You	3734	” Judy , not interested in what she has often heard , begins to collect in a basin various tributary streams of tea , from the bottoms of cups and saucers and from the bottom of the teapot , for the little charwoman 's evening meal . In like manner she gets together , in the iron bread - basket , as many outside fragments and worn - down heels of loaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence . “
146991	146997	146989	146989	Bart	554	” says the old gentleman ; “
147085	147175	147067	147067	Judy	556	” One might infer , from Judy 's appearance , that her business rather lay with the thorns than the flowers ; but , she has , in her time , been apprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower - making . A close observer might perhaps detect both in her eye and her brother 's , when their venerable grandsire anticipates his being gone , some little impatience to know when he may be going , and some resentful opinion that it is time he went . “
147183	147191	147067	147067	Judy	556	” says Judy , completing her preparations , “
147218	147316	147209	147209	she	2505	” Charley is accordingly introduced , and , under a heavy fire of eyes , sits down to her basin and a Druidical ruin of bread and butter . In the active superintendence of this young person , Judy Smallweed appears to attain a perfectly geological age , and to date from the remotest periods . Her systematic manner of flying at her and pouncing on her , with or without pretence , whether or no , is wonderful ; evincing an accomplishment in the art of girl - driving , seldom reached by the oldest practitioners . “
147328	147356	147209	147209	she	2505	” cries Judy , shaking her head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the basin of tea , “
147368	147369	147372	147372	miss	9100	” “
147374	147378	147372	147372	miss	9100	” says Charley . “
147384	147389	147372	147372	miss	9100	” returns Miss Smallweed , “
147413	147442	147444	147445	you girls	3726	” Charley swallows a great gulp of tea in token of submission , and so disperses the Druidical ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her not to gormandize , which “
147447	147479	147444	147445	you girls	3726	” she observes , is disgusting . Charley might find some more difficulty in meeting her views on the general subject of girls , but for a knock at the door . “
147494	147554	147490	147490	you	3745	” cries Judy . The object of her attentions withdrawing for the purpose , Miss Smallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling the remainder of the bread and butter together , and launching two or three dirty tea - cups into the ebbtide of the basin of tea ; as a hint that she considers the eating and drinking terminated . “
147566	147575	147576	147577	Mr. George	562	” says the snappish Judy . It is one “
147579	147594	147576	147577	Mr. George	562	” it appears . Without other announcement or ceremony , Mr. George walks in . “
147597	147602	147576	147577	Mr. George	562	” says Mr. George . “
147626	147643	147617	147617	you	3745	” Mr. George makes the latter remark to himself , as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed . “
147650	147656	147648	147648	you	3745	” cries the old gentleman . “
147665	147666	147695	147695	miss	9100	” “
147669	147678	147695	147695	miss	9100	” replies Mr. George , taking a chair . “
147697	147698	147695	147695	miss	9100	” “
147704	147709	147710	147710	You	3745	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
147728	147729	147730	147730	My	0	” “
147757	147775	147750	147750	He	3751	” says Mr. George , laying a great and not altogether complimentary stress on his last adjective . “
147787	147797	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” Grandfather Smallweed enquires , slowly rubbing his legs . “
147807	148125	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” He is a swarthy browned man of fifty ; well made , and good - looking ; with crisp dark hair , bright eyes , and a broad chest . His sinewy and powerful hands , as sunburnt as his face , have evidently been used to a pretty rough life . What is curious about him is , that he sits forward on his chair as if he were , from long habit , allowing space for some dress or accoutrements that he has altogether laid aside . His step too is measured and heavy , and would go well with a weighty clash and jingle of spurs . He is close - shaved now , but his mouth is set as if his upper lip had been for years familiar with a great moustache ; and his manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his broad brown hand upon it , is to the same effect . Altogether , one might guess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time . A special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family . Trooper was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him . It is a broadsword to an oyster - knife . His developed figure , and their stunted forms ; his large manner , filling any amount of room ; and their little narrow pinched ways ; his sounding voice , and their sharp spare tones ; are in the strongest and the strangest opposition . As he sits in the middle of the grim parlor , leaning a little forward , with his hands upon his thighs and his elbows squared , he looks as though , if he remained there long , he would absorb into himself the whole family and the whole four - roomed house , extra little back - kitchen and all . “
148137	148150	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” he asks of Grandfather Smallweed , after looking round the room . “
148172	148176	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” he replies . “
148186	148206	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” repeats Mr. George , folding his arms upon his chest , and seeming to become two sizes larger . “
148216	148217	147784	147785	Mr. George	562	” “
148227	148232	148224	148225	Mr. George	562	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
148246	148252	148240	148240	I	0	” nodding at his wife , “
148262	148272	148258	148260	a brimstone chatterer	3758	” with a sudden revival of his late hostility . “
148277	148289	148293	148295	the old lady	9222	” says Mr. George , turning his head in that direction . “
148341	148355	148338	148339	Mr. Smallweed	539	” says Mr. George , coming back to his seat from assisting her , “
148362	148363	148338	148339	Mr. Smallweed	539	” “
148375	148399	148372	148373	Mr. George	562	” the old man hints , with a leer . The color of Mr. George 's face rather deepens , as he replies : “
148407	148408	148403	148403	I	0	” “
148415	148416	148409	148409	I	0	” “
148469	148470	148446	148449	a thundering bad son	3768	” “
148473	148479	148446	148449	a thundering bad son	3768	” cries the old man . “
148482	148487	148446	148449	a thundering bad son	3768	” Mr. George resumes , “
148572	148754	148771	148771	Judy	556	” Mr. George sits , with his arms folded , consuming the family and the parlor , while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black leathern cases out of a locked bureau ; in one of which he secures the document he has just received , and from the other takes another similar document which he hands to Mr. George , who twists it up for a pipe - light . As the old man inspects , through his glasses , every up - stroke and down - stroke of both documents , before he releases them from their leathern prison ; and as he counts the money three times over , and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice , and is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to be ; this business is a long time in progress . When it is quite concluded , and not before , he disengages his ravenous eyes and fingers from it , and answers Mr. George 's last remark by saying , “
148790	148848	148771	148771	Judy	556	” The sportive twins , who have been looking straight before them all this time , except when they have been engrossed by the black leathern cases , retire together , generally disdainful of the visitor , but leaving him to the old man , as two young cubs might leave a traveller to the parental bear . “
148864	148873	148851	148851	you	9019	” says Mr. George , with folded arms . “
148880	148886	148851	148851	you	9019	” the old man nods . “
148896	148897	148898	148898	I	0	” “
148910	148911	148898	148898	I	0	” “
148917	148926	148898	148898	I	0	” says Mr. George , with great expression . “
148935	148936	148898	148898	I	0	” “
148947	148959	148898	148898	I	0	” The old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph . “
148988	148989	148898	148898	I	0	” “
149001	149032	149033	149033	I	0	” says the visitor , in a key too low for the old man 's dull hearing , as he looks from him to the old woman and back again . “
149036	149042	149033	149033	I	0	” in a louder voice . “
149047	149048	149045	149045	you	9019	” “
149067	149068	149069	149071	My dear friend	3776	” “
149073	149086	149069	149071	My dear friend	3776	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , stretching out both hands to embrace him . “
149113	149114	149110	149110	he	1760	” “
149124	149141	149142	149142	you	9019	” says Mr. George ; finishing the enquiry , in his lower key , with the words “
149147	149148	149142	149142	you	9019	” “
149177	149178	149167	149167	He	1760	” “
149183	149216	149179	149179	Devil	3783	” says Mr. George . Charley appearing with a tray , on which are the pipe , a small paper of tobacco , and the brandy and water , he asks her , “
149231	149232	149223	149223	you	3776	” “
149241	149278	149233	149233	I	0	” returns Charley . The trooper ( if trooper he be or have been ) takes her bonnet off , with a light touch for so strong a hand , and pats her on the head . “
149302	149335	149339	149339	he	3786	” Then he dismisses her , lights his pipe , and drinks to Mr. Smallweed 's friend in the city — the one solitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman 's imagination . “
149348	149349	149337	149337	you	3776	” “
149368	149375	149364	149364	him	3786	” says Grandfather Smallweed , incautiously , “
149379	149405	149364	149364	him	3786	” Incautiously , because his stricken better - half , who has been dozing over the fire for some time , is instantly aroused and jabbers “
149431	149470	149471	149471	You	3776	” and is then cut short by the flying cushion , which the visitor , to whom this singular experiment appears to be a novelty , snatches from her face as it crushes her in the usual manner . “
149506	149517	149518	149518	My	0	” gasps the old man , prostrate in his chair . “
149530	149660	149523	149523	you	3776	” Mr. George , who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other , as if he were demented , takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request , and dragging him upright in his chair as easily as if he were a doll , appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him , and shake him into his grave . Resisting the temptation , but agitating him violently enough to make his head roll like a harlequin 's , he puts him smartly down in his chair again , and adjusts his skull cap with such a rub , that the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards . “
149664	149669	149523	149523	you	3776	” gasps Mr. Smallweed . “
149698	149751	149695	149696	O Lord	3410	” And Mr. Smallweed says it , not without evident apprehensions of his dear friend , who still stands over him looming larger than ever . The alarming presence , however , gradually subsides into its chair , and falls to smoking in long puffs ; consoling itself with the philosophical reflection , “
149776	149777	149768	149768	you	3792	” “
149785	149872	149779	149779	you	3792	” enquires the old man . The trooper shakes his head ; and leaning forward with his right elbow on his right knee and his pipe supported in that hand , while his other hand , resting on his left leg , squares his left elbow in a martial manner , continues to smoke . Meanwhile he looks at Mr. Smallweed with grave attention , and now and then fans the cloud of smoke away , in order that he may see him the more clearly . “
149877	149911	149779	149779	you	3792	” he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips , with a round , full action , “
149936	149937	149915	149934	the only man alive ( or dead either ) , that gets the value of a pipe out of you	3798	” “
149940	149946	149915	149934	the only man alive ( or dead either ) , that gets the value of a pipe out of you	3798	” returns the old man , “
149989	149990	149976	149976	you	0	” “
150027	150028	150031	150031	You	0	” “
150039	150048	150031	150031	You	0	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs . “
150055	150058	150051	150051	I	0	” Puff . “
150076	150079	150069	150069	I	0	” Puff . “
150089	150092	150086	150086	I	0	” Puff . “
150101	150109	150093	150093	I	0	” says Mr. George , composedly smoking . “
150118	150119	150110	150110	I	0	” “
150134	150141	150129	150129	You	9019	” Mr. George laughs and drinks . “
150148	150160	150129	150129	You	9019	” asks Grandfather Smallweed , with a twinkle in his eyes , “
150218	150228	150215	150216	Mr. George	562	” Mr. George , still composedly smoking , replies , “
150322	150323	150329	150330	Mr. George	562	” “
150332	150337	150329	150330	Mr. George	562	” hints Grandfather Smallweed . “
150345	150359	150329	150330	Mr. George	562	” says Mr. George , shaking his head , and still composedly smoking . “
150370	150444	150365	150365	my	0	” Grandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his chair since his last adjustment , and is now a bundle of clothes , with a voice in it calling for Judy . That Houri appearing , shakes him up in the usual manner , and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him . For he seems chary of putting his visitor to the trouble of repeating his late attentions . “
150447	150458	150365	150365	my	0	” he observes , when he is in trim again . “
150573	150574	150571	150571	you	562	” “
150590	150642	150575	150575	I	0	” says Mr. George , smoking not quite so placidly as before , for since the entrance of Judy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination , not of the admiring kind , which obliges him to look at her as she stands by her grandfather 's chair ; “
150657	150658	150652	150652	I	0	” “
150674	150702	150661	150662	Mr. George	562	” says Grandfather Smallweed , with a plain appearance of exasperation . ( Brimstone apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her slumber ) . “
150709	150710	150661	150662	Mr. George	562	” “
150725	150726	150716	150717	Mr. George	562	” “
150734	150742	150716	150717	Mr. George	562	” suggests Mr. George , composedly drinking . “
150753	150754	150795	150795	you	3821	” “
150760	150794	150795	150795	you	3821	” returns Mr. George ; but still looking at Judy , as if , she being so old and so like her grandfather , it is indifferent which of the two he addresses ; “
150833	150834	150807	150808	Captain Hawdon	567	” “
150837	150847	150807	150808	Captain Hawdon	567	” returns the old man , shrilly and sharply . “
150850	150858	150807	150808	Captain Hawdon	567	” says Mr. George , smoking on . “
150884	150885	150888	150888	you	3821	” “
150944	150957	150937	150937	I	0	” snarls the old man , holding up his impotent ten fingers , “
150965	150995	150962	150962	him	566	” And in a sudden access of fury , he throws the cushion at the unoffending Mrs. Smallweed , but it passes harmlessly on one side of her chair . “
151004	151042	150996	150996	I	0	” returns the trooper , taking his pipe from his lips for a moment , and carrying his eyes back from following the progress of the cushion , to the pipe - bowl which is burning low , “
151119	151120	151111	151111	he	566	” “
151129	151136	151123	151123	he	566	” says the benevolent old man , “
151150	151151	151123	151123	he	566	” “
151160	151166	151123	151123	he	566	” returns the trooper coolly ; “
151216	151217	151218	151218	I	0	” “
151226	151232	151218	151218	I	0	” snarls the old man . “
151266	151275	151262	151262	He	566	“ How do you know he was there ? ”
151276	151282	151218	151218	I	0	“ He was n't here . ”
151283	151293	151262	151262	He	566	“ How do you know he was n't here ? ”
151294	151306	151308	151309	Mr. George	562	“ Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , ”
151320	151368	151369	151369	he	562	“ He was drowned long before . I am convinced of it . He went over a ship 's side . Whether intentionally or accidentally , I do n't know . Perhaps your friend in the city does.—Do you know what that tune is , Mr. Smallweed ? ”
151388	151391	151393	151395	the old man	1258	“ Tune ! ”
151397	151406	151393	151395	the old man	1258	“ No . We never have tunes here . ”
151407	151475	151482	151484	The old man	1258	“ That 's the Dead March in Saul . They bury soldiers to it ; so it 's the natural end of the subject . Now , if your pretty grand - daughter — excuse me , miss — will condescend to take care of this pipe for two months , we shall save the cost of one , next time . Good evening , Mr. Smallweed ! ”
151476	151481	151482	151484	The old man	1258	“ My dear friend ! ”
151491	151513	151515	151516	the trooper	11982	“ So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me , if I fail in a payment ? ”
151526	151537	151539	151541	the old man	1258	“ My dear friend , I am afraid he will , ”
151588	151595	151597	151599	the old gentleman	1026	“ You 're a damned rogue , ”
151613	151628	151597	151599	the old gentleman	1026	“ But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! ”
152194	152197	152199	152200	the trooper	11982	“ Phil ! ”
152207	152211	152213	152213	Phil	569	“ All right ! ”
152220	152225	152213	152213	Phil	569	“ Anything been doing ? ”
152226	152234	152236	152236	Phil	569	“ Flat as ever so much swipes , ”
152238	152251	152252	152252	Phil	569	“ Five dozen rifle and a dozen pistol . As to aim ! ”
152260	152267	152252	152252	Phil	569	“ Shut up shop , Phil ! ”
152436	152441	152387	152387	He	569	“ Phil 's mark . ”
152516	152519	152521	152522	the master	895	“ Phil ! ”
152543	152555	152521	152522	the master	895	“ You were found in a doorway , were n't you . ”
152556	152559	152561	152561	Phil	569	“ Gutter , ”
152563	152569	152561	152561	Phil	569	“ Watchman tumbled over me . ”
152570	152583	152521	152522	the master	895	“ Then , vagabondizing came natural to you , from the beginning . ”
152584	152590	152592	152592	Phil	569	“ As nat'ral as possible , ”
152594	152598	152592	152592	Phil	569	“ Good night ! ”
152599	152605	152521	152522	the master	895	“ Good night , guv'ner . ”
153348	153353	153355	153356	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Now , Snagsby , ”
153358	153367	153355	153356	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ to go over this odd story again . ”
153368	153375	153445	153446	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ If you please , sir . ”
153376	153394	153355	153356	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ You told me when you were so good as to step round here , last night — ”
153395	153444	153445	153446	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty , sir ; but I remembered that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person , and I thought it possible that you might — just — wish — to — ”
153482	153498	153470	153471	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ I must ask you to excuse the liberty , sir , I am sure . ”
153499	153504	153506	153507	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Not at all , ”
153509	153555	153506	153507	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ You told me , Snagsby , that you put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to your wife . That was prudent I think , because it 's not a matter of such importance that it requires to be mentioned . ”
153556	153561	153563	153564	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ Well , sir , ”
153566	153655	153563	153564	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ you see my little woman is — not to put too fine a point upon it — inquisitive . She 's inquisitive . Poor little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed . In consequence of which , she employs it — I should say upon every individual thing she can lay hold of , whether it concerns her or not — especially not . My little woman has a very active mind , sir . ”
153670	153679	153506	153507	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Dear me , very fine wine indeed ! ”
153680	153692	153694	153695	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Therefore you kept your visit to yourself , last night ? ”
153697	153705	153694	153695	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ And to - night , too ? ”
153706	153825	153826	153827	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Yes , sir , and to - night , too . My little woman is at present in — not to put too fine a point upon it — in a pious state , or in what she considers such , and attends the Evening Exertions ( which is the name they go by ) of a reverend party of the name of Chadband . He has a great deal of eloquence at his command , undoubtedly , but I am not quite favourable to his style myself . That 's neither here nor there . My little woman being engaged in that way , made it easier for me to step round in a quiet manner . ”
153830	153837	153826	153827	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Fill your glass , Snagsby . ”
153838	153848	153854	153854	his	10042	“ Thank you , sir , I am sure , ”
153859	153868	153854	153854	his	10042	“ This is wonderfully fine wine , sir ! ”
153869	153877	153879	153880	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ It is a rare wine now , ”
153882	153889	153879	153880	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ It is fifty years old . ”
153890	153918	153854	153854	his	10042	“ Is it indeed , sir ? But I am not surprised to hear it , I am sure . It might be — any age almost . ”
153945	153959	153961	153962	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? ”
153982	153988	153979	153979	his	293	“ With pleasure , sir . ”
154034	154050	154025	154025	he	293	with—“Dear me , sir , I was n't aware there was any other gentleman present ! ”
154226	154233	154239	154239	his	293	“ Do n't mind this gentleman , ”
154243	154250	154239	154239	his	293	“ This is only Mr. Bucket . ”
154251	154257	154267	154267	he	10042	“ O indeed , sir ? ”
154281	154290	154292	154293	the lawyer	1091	“ I wanted him to hear this story , ”
154295	154331	154292	154293	the lawyer	1091	“ because I have half a mind ( for a reason ) to know more of it , and he is very intelligent in such things . What do you say to this , Bucket ? ”
154332	154417	154418	154419	Mr. Bucket	734	“ It 's very plain , sir . Since our people have moved this boy on , and he 's not to be found on his old lay , if Mr. Snagsby do n't object to go down with me to Tom - all - Alone 's and point him out , we can have him here in less than a couple of hours ' time . I can do it without Mr. Snagsby , of course ; but this is the shortest way . “
154427	154434	154421	154423	a detective officer	3917	” says the lawyer in explanation . “
154441	154460	154439	154439	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , with a strong tendency in his clump of hair to stand on end . “
154478	154483	154463	154463	you	409	” pursues the lawyer , “
154496	154519	154484	154484	I	0	” In a moment 's hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby , Bucket dips down to the bottom of his mind . “
154530	154534	154535	154535	You	409	” he says . “
154631	154632	154624	154624	you	409	” “
154639	154650	154624	154624	you	409	” cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully , and re - assured , “
154658	154659	154624	154624	you	409	” “
154669	154694	154666	154667	Mr. Snagsby	409	” resumes Bucket , taking him aside by the arm , tapping him familiarly on the breast , and speaking in a confidential tone . “
154724	154725	154721	154721	you	409	” “
154740	154751	154729	154729	I	0	” returns the stationer , with his cough of modesty , “
154754	154755	154759	154759	you	409	” “
154765	154769	154762	154762	you	409	” says Bucket . “
154857	154858	154852	154852	you	409	” “
154863	154868	154852	154852	you	409	” returns the stationer . “
154876	154887	154869	154869	I	0	” says Bucket , with an engaging appearance of frankness , “
154936	154937	154933	154933	you	409	” “
154940	154953	154933	154933	you	409	” says Mr. Snagsby , but not appearing to see quite distinctly . “
154960	154977	154957	154957	you	409	” pursues Bucket , again tapping Mr. Snagsby on the breast in a comfortable soothing manner , “
154997	154998	154994	154994	you	409	” “
155003	155011	154994	154994	you	409	” returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod . “
155049	155050	155042	155043	my uncle	3939	” “
155059	155064	155056	155056	customer	3937	” replies Mr. Snagsby . “
155069	155079	155056	155056	customer	3937	” returns Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him quite affectionately,—“on
155143	155144	155145	155145	You	409	” “
155155	155160	155151	155151	You	409	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
155167	155185	155164	155164	your	409	” returns his new friend , quite as intimate with it as if he had made it ; “
155195	155224	155192	155192	I	0	” They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn , without a ruffle on the surface of his unfathomable depths , drinking his old wine , and go down into the streets . “
155246	155259	155244	155244	you	409	” says Bucket , in friendly converse as they descend the stairs . “
155262	155269	155244	155244	you	409	” says Mr. Snagsby , considering , “
155281	155282	155274	155277	anybody of that name	3945	” “
155286	155290	155274	155277	anybody of that name	3945	” says Bucket ; “
155343	155737	155744	155745	Mr. Snagsby	409	” As they walk along , Mr. Snagsby observes , as a novelty , that , however quick their pace may be , his companion still seems in some undefinable manner to lurk and lounge ; also , that whenever he is going to turn to the right or left , he pretends to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight ahead , and wheels off , sharply , at the very last moment . Now and then , when they pass a police constable on his beat , Mr. Snagsby notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other , and appear entirely to overlook each other , and to gaze into space . In a few instances , Mr. Bucket , coming behind some under - sized young man with a shining hat on , and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick ; upon which the young man , looking round , instantly evaporates . For the most part Mr. Bucket notices things in general , with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger , or the brooch , composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his shirt . When they come at last to Tom - all - Alone 's , Mr. Bucket stops for a moment at the corner , and takes a lighted bull's - eye from the constable on duty there , who then accompanies him with his own particular bull's - eye at his waist . Between his two conductors , Mr. Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street , undrained , unventilated , deep in black mud and corrupt water — though the roads are dry elsewhere — and reeking with such smells and sights that he , who has lived in London all his life , can scarce believe his senses . Branching from this street and its heaps of ruins , are other streets and courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind , and feels as if he were going , every moment deeper down , into the infernal gulf . “
155747	155768	155744	155745	Mr. Snagsby	409	” says Bucket , as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd . “
155778	155841	155744	155745	Mr. Snagsby	409	” As the unseen wretch goes by , the crowd , leaving that object of attraction , hovers round the three visitors , like a dream of horrible faces , and fades away up alleys and into ruins , and behind walls ; and with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning , thenceforth flits about them until they leave the place . “
155851	155874	155876	155876	them	3950	” Mr. Bucket coolly asks , as he turns his bull's - eye on a line of stinking ruins . Darby replies that “
155879	155893	155744	155745	Mr. Snagsby	409	” and further that in all , for months and months , the people “
155900	155910	155898	155898	dozens	3951	” and have been carried out , dead and dying “
155917	156238	155912	155917	sheep with the rot . ”	12081	” Bucket observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again , that he looks a little poorly , Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he could n't breathe the dreadful air . There is inquiry made , at various houses , for a boy named Jo . As few people are known in Tom - all - Alone 's by any Christian sign , there is much reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he means Carrots , or the Colonel , or Gallows , or Young Chisel , or Terrier Tip , or Lanky , or the Brick . Mr. Snagsby describes over and over again . There are conflicting opinions respecting the original of his picture . Some think it must be Carrots ; some say the Brick . The Colonel is produced , but is not at all near the thing . Whenever Mr. Snagsby and his conductors are stationary , the crowd flows round , and from its squalid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket . Whenever they move , and the angry bull's - eyes glare , it fades away , and flits about them up the alleys , and in the ruins , and behind the walls , as before . At last there is a lair found out where Toughy , or the Tough Subject , lays him down at night ; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may be Jo . Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress of the house — a drunken face tied up in a black bundle , and flaring out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog - hutch which is her private apartment — leads to the establishment of this conclusion . Toughy has gone to the Doctor 's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman , but will be here anon . “
156249	156266	156267	156269	Two drunken men	3954	” says Mr. Bucket , opening another door and glaring in with his bull's - eye . “
156283	156298	156277	156278	The men	3956	” turning back each sleeper 's arm from his face to look at him . “
156308	156309	156312	156312	sir	9019	” “
156314	156321	156312	156312	sir	9019	” returns one of the women . “
156327	156328	156322	156322	They	3957	” “
156332	156333	156336	156336	sir	9019	” “
156338	156339	156336	156336	sir	9019	” “
156353	156354	156357	156357	sir	9019	” “
156364	156365	156359	156359	We	3952	” “
156370	156371	156359	156359	We	3952	” “
156375	156376	156359	156359	We	3952	” “
156383	156384	156385	156385	We	3952	” “
156417	156418	156414	156414	I	0	” “
156429	156448	156414	156414	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , turning his head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground . “
156454	156462	156463	156463	Jenny	401	” replies the woman with a sigh . “
156471	156577	156463	156463	Jenny	401	” The room , though two or three feet higher than the door , is so low that the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the blackened ceiling if he stood upright . It is offensive to every sense ; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted air . There are a couple of benches , and a higher bench by way of table . The men lie asleep where they stumbled down , but the women sit by the candle . Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken , is a very young child . “
156589	156593	156583	156583	you	0	” says Bucket . “
156603	156644	156583	156583	you	0	” He is not at all rough about it ; and as he turns his light gently on the infant , Mr. Snagsby is strangely reminded of another infant , encircled with light , that he has seen in pictures . “
156655	156660	156645	156645	He	3966	” says the woman . “
156666	156667	156668	156668	Mine	3969	” “
156670	156697	156668	156668	Mine	3969	” The other woman , who was bending over it when they came in , stoops down again , and kisses it as it lies asleep . “
156712	156717	156698	156698	You	3969	” says Mr. Bucket . “
156733	156734	156736	156736	Jenny	401	” “
156740	156748	156738	156738	Jenny	401	” says the other woman to her ; “
156766	156767	156761	156761	Jenny	401	” “
156780	156786	156773	156775	an unnatural woman	3972	” returns Bucket , sternly , “
156795	156796	156797	156797	God	402	” “
156805	156809	156799	156799	you	0	” she returns . “
156837	156838	156827	156827	I	0	” “
156848	156856	156827	156827	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , mollified again . “
156863	156864	156859	156859	you	3969	” “
156874	156885	156872	156872	master	9322	” returns the woman , her eyes filling with tears , “
156955	156964	156953	156953	them	3979	” glancing at the sleepers on the ground . “
157005	157006	156987	157003	the children that your business lays with often and often , and that you see grow up	3981	” “
157011	157016	157017	157017	you	0	” says Mr. Bucket , “
157043	157044	157023	157023	he	3980	” “
157051	157059	157045	157045	I	0	” she answers , wiping her eyes . “
157210	157211	157205	157205	Jenny	401	” “
157216	157220	157205	157205	Jenny	401	” says Jenny . “
157234	157263	157230	157230	me	0	” In doing so , she displaces the mother 's dress , but quickly readjusts it over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying . “
157270	157282	157266	157268	my dead child	3987	” says Jenny , walking up and down as she nurses , “
157362	157398	157403	157403	you	3993	” As Mr. Snagsby blows his nose , and coughs his cough or sympathy , a step is heard without . Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway , and says to Mr. Snagsby , “
157412	157413	157409	157409	he	578	” “
157418	157470	157416	157416	Jo	440	” says Mr. Snagsby . Jo stands amazed in the disc of light , like a ragged figure in a magic Ianthorn , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough . Mr. Snagsby , however , giving him the consolatory assurance , “
157484	157513	157482	157482	Jo	440	” he recovers ; and , on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a little private confabulation , tells his tale satisfactorily , though out of breath . “
157522	157529	157514	157514	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , returning , “
157547	157580	157541	157541	we	3995	” First , Jo has to complete his errand of good - nature by handing over the physic he has been to get , which he delivers with the laconic verbal direction that “
157589	157971	157541	157541	we	3995	” Secondly , Mr. Snagsby has to lay upon the table half - a - crown , his usual panacea for an immense variety of afflictions . Thirdly , Mr. Bucket has to take Jo by the arm a little above the elbow and walk him on before him : without which observance , neither the Tough Subject nor any other subject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln 's Inn Fields . These arrangements completed , they give the women good night , and come out once more into black and foul Tom - all - Alone 's . By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit , they gradually emerge from it ; the crowd flitting , and whistling , and skulking about them , until they come to the verge , where restoration of the bull's - eyes is made to Darby . Here , the crowd , like a concourse of imprisoned demons , turns back , yelling , and is seen no more . Through the clearer and fresher streets , never so clear and fresh to Mr. Snagsby 's mind as now , they walk and ride , until they come to Mr. Tulkinghorn 's gate . As they ascend the dim stairs ( Mr. Tulkinghorn 's chambers being on the first floor ) , Mr. Bucket mentions that he has the key of the outer door in his pocket , and that there is no need to ring . For a man so expert in most things of that kind , Bucket takes time to open the door , and makes some noise too . It may be that he sounds a note of preparation . Howbeit , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn 's usual room — the room where he drank his old wine to - night . He is not there , but his two old - fashioned candlesticks are ; and the room is tolerably light . Mr. Bucket , still having his professional hold of Jo , and appearing to Mr. Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes , makes a little way into this room , when Jo starts , and stops . “
157977	157984	157541	157541	we	3995	” says Bucket in a whisper . “
157989	157993	157986	157986	she	3996	” cries Jo . “
157996	157997	157998	157999	The lady	1219	” “
158001	158056	157998	157999	The lady	1219	” A female figure , closely veiled , stands in the middle of the room , where the light falls upon it . It is quite still , and silent . The front of the figure is towards them , but it takes no notice of their entrance , and remains like a statue . “
158062	158067	158060	158060	me	0	” says Bucket aloud , “
158077	158078	158069	158069	you	3998	” “
158084	158090	158074	158075	the lady	1219	” replies Jo , staring , “
158099	158100	158106	158106	you	3998	” “
158111	158120	158109	158109	Tough	581	” returns Bucket , narrowly observant of him . “
158124	158125	158126	158126	I	0	” “
158138	158146	158134	158134	I	0	” says Jo , with starting eyes , “
158161	158162	158134	158134	I	0	” “
158172	158176	158167	158167	you	3998	” asks Bucket . “
158183	158222	158167	158167	you	3998	” says Jo , rubbing the fingers of his left hand on the knuckles of his right , without taking his eyes from the figure . The figure removes the right hand glove , and shews the hand . “
158232	158241	158227	158227	you	3998	” asks Bucket . Jo shakes his head . “
158255	158256	158259	158259	you	3998	” “
158263	158276	158259	158259	you	3998	” says Bucket ; evidently pleased though , and well pleased too . “
158291	158295	158277	158277	Hand	582	” returns Jo . “
158310	158315	158298	158298	you	3998	” says Mr. Bucket . “
158324	158325	158319	158320	the lady	1219	” “
158331	158339	158328	158328	I	0	” says Jo . The figure speaks . “
158373	158381	158408	158409	the lady	1219	” Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket . “
158386	158387	158408	158409	the lady	1219	” “
158392	158402	158404	158404	you	0	” retorts that worthy , pointing to the figure , “
158412	158413	158404	158404	you	0	” “
158416	158435	158404	158404	you	0	” says Jo , with a perplexed stare , but without being at all shaken in his certainty , “
158518	158519	158509	158509	she	1219	” “
158522	158529	158509	158509	she	1219	” says Mr. Bucket , slightly , “
158566	158679	158681	158681	you	0	” Bucket stealthily tells the coins from one hand into the other like counters — which is a way he has , his principal use of them being in these games of skill — and then puts them , in a little pile , into the boy 's hand , and takes him out to the door ; leaving Mr. Snagsby , not by any means comfortable under these mysterious circumstances , alone with the veiled figure . But , on Mr. Tulkinghorn 's coming into the room , the veil is raised , and a sufficiently good - looking Frenchwoman is revealed , though her expression is something of the intensest . “
158686	158696	158681	158681	you	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , with his usual equanimity . “
158709	158710	158711	158711	You	0	” “

I do n't mean constant to Ada , for I love her dearly — better and better every day — but constant to myself . ( Somehow , I mean something that I ca n't very well express , but you 'll make it out ) . If I were a more constant sort of fellow , I should have held on , either to Badger , or to Kenge and Carboy , like grim Death ; and should have begun to be steady and systematic by this time , and should n't be in debt , and — ”

161578	161719	161575	161575	he	4054	“ My dear Esther , I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled , but how can I be more settled ? If you lived in an unfinished house , you could n't settle down in it ; if you were condemned to leave everything you undertook , unfinished , you would find it hard to apply yourself to anything ; and yet that 's my unhappy case . I was born into this unfinished contention with all its chances and changes , and it began to unsettle me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at law and a suit of clothes ; and it has gone on unsettling me ever since ; and here I am now , conscious sometimes that I am but a worthless fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada . ”
161743	161747	161749	161749	I	0	“ O Richard ! ”

161791	161928	161784	161784	he	4056	“ I know all that . You must n't mind my being a little soft now , for I have had all this upon my mind for a long time ; and have often meant to speak to you , and have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage . I know what the thought of Ada ought to do for me , but it does n't do it . I am too unsettled even for that . I love her most devotedly ; and yet I do her wrong , in doing myself wrong , every day and hour . But it ca n't last for ever . We shall come on for a final hearing , and get judgment in our favour ; and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be ! ”

As to years of delay , there has been no want of them , Heaven knows ! and there is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a speedy close ; in fact , it 's on the paper now . It will be all right at last , and then you shall see ! ”

162122	162185	162187	162187	Richard	320	“ I fancy I have had enough of it . Having worked at Jarndyce and Jarndyee like a galley slave , I have slaked my thirst for the law , and satisfied myself that I should n't like it . Besides , I find it unsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of action . So what , ”
162195	162204	162187	162187	Richard	320	“ do I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ”

162225	162316	162223	162223	Richard	320	“ because it 's the best think I can do , my dear Esther , I am certain . It 's not as if I wanted a profession for life . These proceedings will come to a termination , and then I am provided for . No . I look upon it as a pursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled , and therefore suited to my temporary condition — I may say , precisely suited . What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ”
162327	162330	162332	162332	Richard	320	“ What , ”
162341	162346	162332	162332	Richard	320	“ but the army ! ”

162778	162822	162776	162776	Caddy	328	“ and got the key for us . So , if you will walk round and round here with me , we can lock ourselves in , and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about . ”

In the first place , because I want to profit by everything you tell me ; and in the second place , because I have no secrets from Prince . ”

162988	163018	162883	162883	Caddy	328	“ O , my dear ! I assure you he would approve of anything you could say . You have no idea what an opinion he has of you ! ”

163023	163036	163038	163038	Caddy	328	“ Esther , it 's enough to make anybody but me jealous , ”
163046	163086	163043	163043	her	328	“ but it only makes me joyful , for you are the first friend I ever had , and the best friend I ever can have , and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me . ”

163201	163310	163189	163189	Caddy	328	“ I said , ‘ Esther . ’ I said to Prince , ‘ As Esther is decidedly of that opinion , Prince , and has expressed it to me , and always hints it when she writes those kind notes , which you are so fond of hearing me read to you , I am prepared to disclose the truth to Ma whenever you think proper . And I think , Prince , ’ said I , ‘ that Esther thinks that I should be in a better , and truer , and more honorable position altogether , if you did the same to your Papa . ’ ”

163341	163445	163447	163447	Caddy	328	“ Well ! this troubled Prince a good deal ; not because he had the least doubt about it , but because he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop ; and he had his apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his heart , or faint away , or be very much overcome in some affecting manner or other , if he made such an announcement . He feared old Mr. Turveydrop might consider it undutiful , and might receive too great a shock . For , old Mr. Turveydrop 's deportment is very beautiful you know , Esther , ”

At last he said to me , ‘ Caddy , if Miss Summerson , who is a great favourite with my father , could be prevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject , I think I could do it . ’ So I promised I would ask you . And I made up my mind , besides , ”

164455	164500	164453	164453	Prince	492	“ and Miss Summerson , hearing of it , advised that we should declare the fact to you , and was so very kind as to attend on the present occasion . Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , father . ”

164725	164854	164723	164723	Prince	492	“ we well know what little comforts you are accustomed to , and have a right to ; and it will always be our study , and our pride , to provide those before anything . If you will bless us with your approval and consent , father , we shall not think of being married until it is quite agreeable to you ; and when we are married , we shall always make you — of course — our first consideration . You must ever be the Head and Master here , father ; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us , if we failed to know it , or if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please you . ”
164887	164891	164893	164894	Mr. Turveydrop	492	“ My son ! ”

165105	165217	165102	165103	Mr. Turveydrop	492	“ I am falling into the sear and yellow leaf , and it is impossible to say how long the last feeble traces of gentlemanly Deportment may linger in this weaving and spinning age . But , so long , I will do my duty to society , and will show myself , as usual , about town . My wants are few and simple . My little apartment here , my few essentials for the toilet , my frugal morning meal , and my little dinner , will suffice . I charge your dutiful affection with the supply of these requirements , and I charge myself with all the rest . ”
165227	165231	165233	165234	Mr. Turveydrop	492	“ My son , ”
165236	165381	165233	165234	Mr. Turveydrop	492	“ for those little points in which you are deficient — points of Deportment which are born with a man — which may be improved by cultivation , but can never be originated — you may still rely on me . I have been faithful to my post , since the days of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent ; and I will not desert it now . No , my son . If you have ever contemplated your father 's poor position with a feeling of pride , you may rest assured that he will do nothing to tarnish it . For yourself , Prince , whose character is different ( we can not be all alike , nor is it advisable that we should ) , work , be industrious , earn money , and extend the connexion as much as possible . ”
165382	165399	165401	165401	Prince	492	“ That you may depend I will do , dear father , with all my heart , ”

165416	165489	165413	165414	Mr. Turveydrop	492	“ Your qualities are not shining , my dear child , but they are steady and useful . And to both of you , my children , I would merely observe , in the spirit of a sainted Wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting , I believe , some ray of light,—take care of the establishment , take care of my simple wants , and bless you both ! ”
165829	165835	165836	165836	she	4104	“ Ah ! Miss Summerson ! ”

We have , at the present moment , one hundred and seventy families , Miss Summerson , averaging five persons in each , either gone or going to the left bank of the Niger . ”

166029	166059	166019	166020	Mrs. Jellyby	323	“ It has become quite a novelty to see her here . She has almost deserted her old employment , and in fact obliges me to employ a boy . ”

166124	166147	166122	166122	Caddy	328	“ I was only going to say , that surely you would n't have me be a mere drudge all my life . ”

If you had any sympathy with the destinies of the human race , it would raise you high above any such idea . But you have none . I have often told you , Caddy , you have no such sympathy . ”
166242	166255	166177	166177	she	323	“ Not if it 's Africa , Ma , I have not . ”
166256	166277	166279	166280	Mrs. Jellyby	323	“ Of course you have not . Now , if I were not happily so much engaged , Miss Summerson , ”
166305	166347	166284	166284	her	323	“ this would distress and disappoint me . But I have so much to think of , in connexion with Borrioboola Gha , and it is so necessary I should concentrate myself , that there is my remedy , you see . ”

166475	166515	166473	166473	I	0	“ because Caddy justly thinks she ought not to have a secret from her mother ; and fancies I shall encourage and aid her ( though I am sure I do n't know how ) , in imparting one . ”

166711	166719	166721	166722	Mrs. Jellyby	323	“ You see again , Miss Summerson , ”
166726	166820	166721	166722	Mrs. Jellyby	323	“ what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am , and to have this necessity for self - concentration that I have . Here is Caddy engaged to a dancing - master 's son — mixed up with people who have no more sympathy with the destinies of the human race , than she has herself ! This , too , when Mr. Gusher , one of the first philanthropists of our time , has mentioned to me that he was really disposed to be interested in her ! ”
166821	166832	166834	166834	Caddy	328	“ Ma , I always hated and detested Mr. Gusher ! ”

Now , if my public duties were not a favourite child to me , if I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale , these petty details might grieve me very much , Miss Summerson . But can I permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy ( from whom I expect nothing else ) , to interpose between me and the great African continent ? No . No . ”
166981	166986	166973	166973	she	323	“ No , indeed . ”
167052	167057	167022	167023	Mrs. Jellyby	323	“ No , indeed . ”

You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time . My dear Miss Summerson , it was very kind of you to come here to help out this silly chit . Good bye ! When I tell you that I have fifty - eight new letters from manufacturing families anxious to understand the details of the Native and Coffee Cultivation question , this morning , I need not apologise for having very little leisure . ”

169983	169989	169991	169992	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Ada , my dear , ”
169998	170119	169991	169992	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ these are strong words of advice ; but I live in Black House , and have seen a sight here . Enough of that . All Richard had , to start him in the race of life , is ventured . I recommend to him and you , for his sake and your own , that he should depart from us with the understanding that there is no sort of contract between you . I must go further . I will be plain with you both . You were to confide freely in me , and I will confide freely in you . I ask you wholly to relinquish , for the present , any tie but your relationship . ”
170120	170129	169991	169992	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Better to say at once , sir , ”
170133	170152	169991	169992	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ that you renounce all confidence in me , and that you advise Ada to do the same . ”
170153	170171	169991	169992	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Better to say nothing of the sort , Rick , because I do n't mean it . ”
170172	170182	170184	170184	Richard	320	“ You think I have begun ill , sir , ”
170186	170193	170184	170184	Richard	320	“ I have , I know . ”
170194	170218	170220	170221	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ How I hoped you would begin , and how go on , I told you when we spoke of these things last , ”
170230	170308	170220	170221	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ You have not made that beginning yet ; but there is a time for all things , and yours is not gone by — rather , it is just now fully come . Make a clear beginning altogether . You two ( very young , my dears ) are cousins . As yet , you are nothing more . What more may come , must come of being worked out , Rick ; and no sooner . ”
170309	170319	170321	170321	Richard	320	“ You are very hard with me , sir , ”
170323	170334	170321	170321	Richard	320	“ Harder than I could have supposed you would be . ”

170345	170432	170342	170343	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain . You have your remedy in your own hands . Ada , it is better for him that he should be free , and that there should be no youthful engagement between you . Rick , it is better for her , much better ; you owe it to her . Come ! Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . ”
170433	170441	170443	170443	Richard	320	“ Why is it best , sir ? ”
170447	170468	170443	170443	Richard	320	“ it was not , when we opened our hearts to you . You did not say so , then . ”
170469	170491	170342	170343	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ I have had experience since . I do n't blame you , Rick — but I have had experience since . ”

I now affectionately advise , I now most earnestly entreat , you two , to part as you came here . Leave all else to time , truth , and stedfastness . If you do otherwise , you will do wrong ; and you will have made me do wrong , in ever bringing you together . ”

170710	170781	170783	170783	Ada	319	“ after what our cousin John has said , I think no choice is left us . Your mind may be quite at ease about me ; for you will leave me here under his care , and will be sure that I can have nothing to wish for ; quite sure , if I guide myself by his advice . I — I do n't doubt , cousin Richard , ”
170789	170932	170934	170934	Ada	319	“ that you are very fond of me , and I — I do n't think you will fall in love with anybody else . But I should like you to consider well about it , too ; as I should like you to be in all things very happy . You may trust in me , cousin Richard . I am not at all changeable ; but I am not unreasonable , and should never blame you . Even cousins may be sorry to part ; and in truth I am very , very sorry , Richard , though I know it 's for your welfare . I shall always think of you affectionately , and often talk of you with Esther , and — and perhaps you will sometimes think a little of me , cousin Richard . So now , ”
170947	170976	170934	170934	Ada	319	“ we are only cousins again , Richard — for the time perhaps — and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin , wherever he goes ! ”

171523	171545	171520	171521	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Not much of a one , sir . I keep a shooting gallery , but not much of a one . ”
171546	171568	171570	171571	my guardian	9683	“ And what kind of a shot , and what kind of a swordsman , do you make of Mr. Carstone ? ”

171631	171662	171628	171629	my guardian	9683	“ He did at first , sir , but not afterwards . Not his full mind . Perhaps he has something else upon it — some young lady , perhaps . ”

172030	172085	171957	171957	His	9683	“ All sorts , sir . Natives and foreigners . From gentlemen to ' prentices . I have had French women come , before now , and show themselves dabs at pistol - shooting . Mad people out of number , of course — but they go everywhere , where the doors stand open . ”
172086	172107	172109	172110	my guardian	9683	“ People do n't come with grudges , and schemes of finishing their practice with live targets , I hope ? ”
172114	172153	172155	172156	Mr. George	562	“ Not much of that , sir , though that has happened . Mostly they come for skill — or idleness . Six of one , and half a dozen of the other . I beg your pardon , ”
172170	172186	172155	172156	Mr. George	562	“ but I believe you 're a Chancery suitor , if I have heard correct ? ”

172228	172257	172259	172260	Mr. George	562	“ Why , the man was so badgered and worried , and tortured , by being knocked about from post to pillar , and from pillar to post , ”
172262	172426	172259	172260	Mr. George	562	“ that he got out of sorts . I do n't believe he had any idea of taking aim at anybody ; but he was in that condition of resentment and violence , that he would come and pay for fifty shots , and fire away till he was red hot . One day I said to him , when there was nobody by , and he had been talking to me angrily about his wrongs , ‘ If this practice is a safety - valve , comrade , well and good ; but I do n't altogether like your being so bent upon it , in your present state of mind ; I 'd rather you took to something else . ’ I was on my guard for a blow , he was that passionate ; but he received it in very good part , and left off directly . We shook hands , and struck up a sort of a friendship . ”

I came down to look for her ; for when I sat by Gridley this afternoon , I seemed to hear the roll of the muffled drums . ”

175769	175774	175776	175777	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Ladies and gentlemen , ”
175779	175850	175776	175777	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you 'll excuse anything that may appear to be disagreeable in this , for my name 's Inspector Bucket of the Detective , and I have a duty to perform . George , I know where my man is , because I was on the roof last night , and saw him through the skylight , and you along with him . He is in there , you know , ”
175853	175947	175776	175777	Mr. Bucket	734	“ that 's where he is — on a sofy . Now I must see my man , and I must tell my man to consider himself in custody ; but , you know me , and you know I do n't want to take any uncomfortable measures . You give me your word , as from one man to another ( and an old soldier , mind you , likewise ! ) , that it 's honorable between us two , and I 'll accommodate you to the utmost of my power . ”
175948	175953	175776	175777	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I give it , ”
175958	175970	175981	175982	Mr. Bucket	734	“ But it was n't handsome in you , Mr. Bucket . ”
175971	175979	175981	175982	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Gammon , George ! Not handsome ? ”
175998	176077	175981	175982	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I do n't say it was n't handsome in you to keep my man so close , do I ? Be equally good - tempered to me , old boy ! Old William Tell ! Old Shaw , the Life Guardsman ! Why , he 's a model of the whole British army in himself , ladies and gentlemen . I 'd give a fifty - pun ' note to be such a figure of a man ! ”
176316	176321	176322	176322	he	562	“ on the chance , ”
176326	176347	176322	176322	he	562	“ of being able to do any little thing for a poor fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself . ”
176659	176714	176646	176646	his	921	“ Mr. Jarndyce , it is very kind of you to come to see me . I am not long to be seen , I think . I am very glad to take your hand , sir . You are a good man , superior to injustice , and God knows I honor you . ”
176731	176741	176721	176722	my guardian	9683	“ It may seem strange to you , sir , ”
176745	176828	176721	176722	my guardian	9683	“ I should not have liked to see you , if this had been the first time of our meeting . But , you know I made a fight for it , you know I stood up with my single hand against them all , you know I told them the truth to the last , and told them what they were , and what they had done to me ; so I do n't mind your seeing me , this wreck . ”
176829	176843	176845	176846	my guardian	9683	“ You have been courageous with them , many and many a time , ”
176848	176855	176845	176846	my guardian	9683	“ Sir , I have been ; ”
176861	176891	176892	176892	He	4301	“ I told you what would come of it , when I ceased to be so ; and , see here ! Look at us — look at us ! ”
176912	176985	176892	176892	He	4301	“ This ends it . Of all my old associations , of all my old pursuits and hopes , of all the living and the dead world , this one poor soul alone comes natural to me , and I am fit for . There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken . ”
176986	176993	176995	176996	Miss Flite	423	“ Accept my blessing , Gridley , ”
177001	177006	176995	176996	Miss Flite	423	“ Accept my blessing ! ”
177007	177128	176892	176892	He	4301	“ I thought , boastfully , that they never could break my heart , Mr. Jarndyce . I was resolved that they should not . I did believe that I could , and would , charge them with being the mockery they were , until I died of some bodily disorder . But I am worn out . How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour . I hope they may never come to hear of it . I hope every body , here , will lead them to believe that I died defying them , consistently and perseveringly , as I did through so many years . ”
177155	177160	177161	177161	he	734	“ Come , come ! ”
177168	177240	177241	177241	He	734	“ Do n't go on in that way , Mr. Gridley . You are only a little low . We are all of us a little low , sometimes . I am . Hold up , hold up ! You 'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet , if I have luck . ”
177247	177254	177256	177257	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do n't shake your head , ”
177259	177384	177256	177257	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not it ; that 's what I want to see you do . Why , Lord bless your soul , what times we have had together ! Have n't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again , for contempt ? Have n't I come into Court , twen - ty afternoons , for no other purpose than to see you pin the Chancellor like a bull - dog ? Do n't you remember , when you first began to threaten the lawyers , and the peace was sworn against you two or three times a week ? Ask the little old lady there ; she has been always present . Hold up , Mr. Gridley , hold up , sir ! ”
177385	177395	177397	177397	George	562	“ What are you going to do about him ? ”
177403	177410	177412	177412	Bucket	734	“ I do n't know yet , ”
177427	177664	177423	177423	he	734	“ Worn out , Mr. Gridley ? After dodging me for all these weeks , and forcing me to climb the roof here like a Tom Cat , and to come to see you as a Doctor ? That ai n't like being worn out . I should think not ! Now I tell you what you want . You want excitement , you know , to keep you up ; that 's what you want . You 're used to it , and you ca n't do without it . I could n't myself . Very well , then ; here 's this warrant , got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and backed into half a dozen counties since . What do you say to coming along with me , upon this warrant , and having a good angry argument before the Magistrates ? It 'll do you good ; it 'll freshen you up , and get you into training for another turn at the Chancellor . Give in ? Why , I am surprised to hear a man of your energy talk of giving in . You musn't do that . You 're half the fun of the fair , in the Court of Chancery . George , you lend Mr. Gridley a hand , and let 's see now whether he wo n't be better up than down . ”
177665	177671	177673	177674	the trooper	11982	“ He is very weak , ”
177681	177685	177687	177687	Bucket	734	“ Is he ? ”
177691	177757	177687	177687	Bucket	734	“ I only want to rouse him . I do n't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this . It would cheer him up more than anything , if I could make him a little waxy with me . He 's welcome to drop into me , right and left , if he likes . I shall never take advantage of it . ”
177775	177781	177782	177782	she	423	“ O no , Gridley ! ”
177796	177807	177782	177782	she	423	“ Not without my blessing . After so many years ! ”

179566	179628	179562	179562	his	533	“ it can not be against us , because it must be for us ; because it is not hardening , because it is softening ; because it does not make war like the hawk , but comes home untoe us like the dove . Therefore , my friends , peace be with us ! My human boy , come forward ! ”

179716	179805	179806	179806	Jo	440	“ I will not let you alone . And why ? Because I am a harvest - labourer , because I am a toiler and a moiler , because you are delivered over untoe me , and are become as a precious instrument in my hands . My friends , may I so employ this instrument as to use it toe your advantage , toe your profit , toe your gain , toe your welfare , toe your enrichment ! My young friend , sit upon this stool . ”

180216	180271	180272	180273	Mr. Chadband	533	“ a brother and a boy . Devoid of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold , and silver , and of precious stones . Now , my friends , why do I say he is devoid of these possessions ? Why ? Why is he ? ”
180342	180354	180359	180360	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ I do n't know , I 'm sure , sir . ”
180368	180372	180364	180365	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ For shame ! ”

180418	180504	180505	180506	Mr. Chadband	533	“ Which says , I do n't know . Then , I will tell you why . I say this brother , present here among us , is devoid of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold , of silver , and of precious stones , because he is devoid of the light that shines in upon some of us . What is that light ? What is it ? I ask you what is that light ? ”
180558	180562	180564	180564	Chadband	532	“ It is , ”
180566	180594	180564	180564	Chadband	532	“ the ray of rays , the sun of suns , the moon of moons , the star of stars . It is the light of Terewth . ”
180623	180627	180629	180630	Mr. Chadband	533	“ Of Terewth , ”
180636	180754	180629	180630	Mr. Chadband	533	“ Say not to me that it is not the lamp of lamps . I say to you , it is . I say to you , a million of times over , it is . It is ! I say to you that I will proclaim it to you , whether you like it or not ; nay , that the less you like it , the more I will proclaim it to you . With a speaking - trumpet ! I say to you that if you rear yourself against it , you shall fall , you shall be bruised , you shall be battered , you shall be flawed , you shall be smashed . ”

180937	181038	180868	180868	he	533	“ if I am told by the doctor that calomel or castor - oil is good for me , I may naturally ask what is calomel , and what is castor - oil . I may wish to be informed of that , before I dose myself with either or with both . Now , my young friends , what is this Terewth , then ? Firstly ( in a spirit of love ) , what is the common sort of Terewth — the working clothes — the every - day wear , my young friends ? Is it deception ? ”
181040	181045	180868	180868	he	533	“ Ah — h ! ”
181051	181056	180868	180868	he	533	“ Is it suppression ? ”

181091	181229	180868	180868	he	533	“ No , my friends , it is neither of these . Neither of these names belongs to it . When this young Heathen now among us — who is now , my friends , asleep , the seal of indifference and perdition being set upon his eyelids ; but do not wake him , for it is right that I should have to wrestle , and to combat , and to struggle , and to conquer , for his sake — when this young hardened Heathen told us a story of a Cock , and of a Bull , and of a lady , and of a sovereign , was that the Terewth ? No . Or , if it was partly , was it wholly , and entirely ? No , my friends , no ! ”
181274	181281	181283	181283	Chadband	533	“ Or , my juvenile friends , ”

181385	181424	181380	181381	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ Or put it , my juvenile friends , that he saw an elephant , and returning said ‘ Lo , the city is barren , I have seen but an eel , ’ would that be Terewth ? ”
181430	181439	181441	181441	Chadband	533	“ Or put it , my juvenile friends , ”
181448	181534	181441	181441	Chadband	533	“ that the unnatural parents of this slumbering Heathen — for parents he had , my juvenile friends , beyond a doubt — after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures , and the wild dogs and the young gazelles , and the serpents , went back to their dwellings and had their pipes , and their pots , and their flutings and their dancings , and their malt liquors , and their butcher 's meat and poultry , would that be Terewth ? ”
181869	181880	181882	181882	Jo	440	“ It an't no good my waiting here no longer , ”
181884	181899	181882	181882	Jo	440	“ Mr. Snagsby an't a going to say nothink to me to - night . ”

183367	183371	183360	183360	Phil	569	“ What marshes ? ”
183372	183378	183380	183380	Phil	569	“ The marshes , commander , ”

183813	183823	183825	183825	Phil	569	“ I 'm something with a eight in it , ”
183827	183845	183825	183825	Phil	569	“ It ca n't be eighty . Nor yet eighteen . It 's betwixt 'em , somewheres . ”
183863	183870	183871	183871	he	562	“ Why , what the deuce , Phil”—when
183884	183890	183892	183892	Phil	569	“ I was just eight , ”
183894	184091	183892	183892	Phil	569	“ agreeable to the parish calculation , when I went with the tinker . I was sent on a errand , and I see him a sittin under a old buildin with a fire all to himself wery comfortable , and he says , ‘ Would you like to come along a me , my man ? ’ I says ‘ Yes , ’ and him and me and the fire goes home to Clerkenwell together . That was April Fool Day . I was able to count up to ten ; and when April Fool Day come round again , I says to myself , ‘ Now , old chap , you 're one and a eight in it . ’ April Fool Day after that , I says , ‘ Now old chap , you 're two and a eight in it . ’ In course of time , I come to ten and a eight in it ; two tens and a eight in it . When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me ; but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . ”
184092	184095	184097	184098	Mr. George	562	“ Ah ! ”
184104	184111	184097	184098	Mr. George	562	“ And where 's the tinker ? ”
184112	184138	184139	184139	Phil	569	“ Drink put him in the hospital , guv'ner , and the hospital put him — in a glass - case , I have heerd , ”
184143	184157	184139	184139	Phil	569	“ By that means you got promotion ? Took the business , Phil ? ”
184158	184324	184097	184098	Mr. George	562	“ Yes , commander , I took the business . Such as it was . It was n't much of a beat — round Saffron Hill , Hatton Garden , Clerkenwell , Smiffeld , and there — poor neighbourhood , where they uses up the kettles till they 're past mending . Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and lodge at our place ; that was the best part of my master 's earnings . But they did n't come to me . I warn't like him . He could sing 'em a good song . I could n't ! He could play 'em a tune on any sort of pot you please , so as it was iron or block tin . I never could do nothing with a pot , but mend it or bile it — never had a note of music in me . Besides , I was too ill - looking , and their wives complained of me . ”
184325	184341	184343	184344	the trooper	11982	“ They were mighty particular . You would pass muster in a crowd , Phil ! ”
184350	184355	184357	184357	Phil	569	“ No , guv'ner , ”
184363	184545	184360	184360	his	569	“ No , I should n't . I was passable enough when I went with the tinker , though nothing to boast of then : but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I was young , and spileing my complexion , and singeing my hair off , and swallering the smoke ; and what with being nat'rally unfort'nate in the way of running against hot metal , and marking myself by sich means ; and what with having turn - ups with the tinker as I got older , almost whenever he was too far gone in drink — which was almost always — my beauty was queer , wery queer , even at that time . As to since ; what with a dozen years in a dark forge , where the men was given to larking ; and what with being scorched in a accident at a gasworks ; and what with being blowed out of winder , case - filling at the firework business ; I am ugly enough to be made a show on ! ”
184574	184597	184571	184571	he	569	“ It was after the case - filling blow - up , when I first see you , commander . You remember ? ”
184598	184612	184360	184360	his	569	“ I remember , Phil . You were walking along in the sun . ”
184613	184622	184360	184360	his	569	“ Crawling , guv'ner , again a wall — ”
184623	184633	184571	184571	he	569	“ True , Phil — shouldering your way on — ”
184634	184639	184641	184641	Phil	569	“ In a nightcap ! ”
184645	184650	184641	184641	Phil	569	“ In a nightcap — ”
184651	184660	184662	184662	Phil	569	“ And hobbling with a couple of sticks ! ”
184668	184677	184662	184662	Phil	569	“ With a couple of sticks . When — ”
184678	184686	184688	184688	Phil	569	“ When you stops , you know , ”
184706	184880	184882	184882	Phil	569	“ and says to me , ‘ What , comrade ! You have been in the wars ! ’ I did n't say much to you , commander , then , for I was took by surprise , that a person so strong and healthy and bold as you was , should stop to speak to such a limping bag of bones as I was . But you says to me , says you , delivering it out of your chest as hearty as possible , so that it was like a glass of something hot , ‘ What accident have you met with ? You have been badly hurt . What 's amiss , old boy ? Cheer up , and tell us about it ! ’ Cheer up ! I was cheered already ! I says as much to you , you says more to me , I says more to you , you says more to me , and here I am , commander ! Here I am , commander ! ”
184897	185010	184882	184882	Phil	569	“ If a mark 's wanted , or if it will improve the business , let the customers take aim at me . They ca n't spoil my beauty . I 'm all right . Come on ! If they want a man to box at , let 'em box at me . Let 'em knock me well about the head . I do n't mind ! If they want a light - weight , to be throwed for practice , Cornwall , Devonshire , or Lancashire , let 'em throw me . They wo n't hurt me . I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! ”

185342	185354	185411	185412	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ O Lord ! O dear me ! I am shaken ! ”
185357	185370	185411	185412	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ How de do , my dear friend , how de do ? ”
185401	185409	185411	185412	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ Mr. George , my dear friend , ”
185435	185451	185411	185412	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ how de do ? You 're surprised to see me , my dear friend . ”
185452	185468	185470	185471	Mr. George	562	“ I should hardly have been more surprised to see your friend in the city , ”
185473	185480	185470	185471	Mr. George	562	“ I am very seldom out , ”
185485	185524	185470	185471	Mr. George	562	“ I have n't been out for many months . It 's inconvenient — and it comes expensive . But I longed so much to see you , my dear Mr. George . How de do , sir ? ”
185525	185531	185533	185534	Mr. George	562	“ I am well enough , ”
185536	185544	185533	185534	Mr. George	562	“ I hope you are the same . ”
185545	185557	185558	185559	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ You ca n't be too well , my dear friend . ”
185566	185591	185558	185559	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ I have brought my grand - daughter Judy . I could n't keep her away . She longed so much to see you . ”
185592	185600	185602	185603	Mr. George	562	“ Hum ! She bears it calmly ! ”
185605	185656	185658	185659	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ So we got a hackney cab , and put a chair in it , and just round the corner they lifted me out of the cab and into the chair , and carried me here , that I might see my dear friend in his own establishment ! This , ”
185681	185706	185658	185659	grandfather Smallweed	539	“ is the driver of the cab . He has nothing extra . It is by agreement included in his fare . This person , ”
185711	185761	185707	185709	the other bearer	4479	“ we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer . Which is twopence . Judy , give the person twopence . I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we need n't have employed this person . ”
185780	185788	185762	185763	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ O Lord ! O dear me ! ”
185856	185862	185864	185865	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Judy , my child , ”
185867	185885	185864	185865	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ give the person his twopence . It 's a great deal for what he has done . ”
185920	185922	185962	185963	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Mission ”
185954	185960	185962	185963	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ My dear Mr. George , ”
185965	186003	185962	185963	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ would you be so kind as help to carry me to the fire ? I am accustomed to a fire , and I am an old man , and I soon chill . O dear me ! ”
186041	186045	186047	186048	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ O Lord ! ”
186052	186099	186047	186048	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ O dear me ! O my stars ! My dear friend , your workman is very strong — and very prompt . O Lord , he is very prompt ! Judy , draw me back a little . I 'm being scorched in the legs ; ”
186158	186166	186153	186154	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ O dear me ! O Lord ! ”
186184	186230	186232	186233	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ My dear friend ! So happy in this meeting ! And this is your establishment ? It 's a delightful place . It 's a picture ! You never find that anything goes off here , accidentally ; do you , my dear friend ? ”
186240	186250	186232	186233	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ No , no . No fear of that . ”
186251	186276	186153	186154	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ And your workman . He — O dear me!—he never lets anything off without meaning it ; does he , my dear friend ? ”
186277	186286	186288	186289	Mr. George	562	“ He has never hurt anybody but himself , ”
186293	186318	186288	186289	Mr. George	562	“ But he might , you know . He seems to have hurt himself a good deal , and he might hurt somebody else , ”
186324	186356	186319	186321	the old gentleman	1026	“ He might n't mean it — or he even might . Mr. George , will you order him to leave his infernal fire - arms alone , and go away ? ”
186391	186401	186402	186402	he	539	“ And you 're doing well , Mr. George ? ”
186422	186431	186402	186402	he	539	“ You are prospering , please the Powers ? ”
186442	186457	186432	186433	Mr. George	562	“ Go on . You have not come to say that , I know . ”
186458	186467	186469	186471	the venerable grandfather	4489	“ You are so sprightly , Mr. George , ”
186473	186480	186469	186471	the venerable grandfather	4489	“ You are such good company . ”
186481	186488	186490	186491	Mr. George	562	“ Ha ha ! Go on ! ”
186493	186524	186526	186529	the excellent old gentleman	11907	“ My dear friend!—But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp . It might cut somebody , by accident . It makes me shiver , Mr. George — Curse him ! ”
186548	186583	186584	186585	Mr. George	562	“ He owes me money , and might think of paying off all scores in this murdering place . I wish your Brimstone grandmother was here , and he 'd shave her head off ! ”
186614	186619	186590	186590	his	562	“ Now for it ! ”
186620	186623	186625	186626	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Ho ! ”
186636	186651	186625	186626	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Yes . Now for it . Now for what , my dear friend ? ”
186652	186657	186659	186660	Mr. George	562	“ For a pipe , ”
186957	186974	186934	186934	she	556	“ Aye , aye ! Ho , ho ! U — u — u — ugh ! ”
186983	186988	186976	186977	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ My dear friend ! ”
186994	187000	187002	187003	Mr. George	562	“ I tell you what , ”
187005	187065	187067	187068	the trooper	11982	“ If you want to converse with me , you must speak out . I am one of the Roughs , and I ca n't go about and about . I have n't the art to do it . I am not clever enough . It do n't suit me . When you go winding round and round me , ”
187078	187093	187095	187095	he	562	“ damme , if I do n't feel as if I was being smothered ! ”
187117	187129	187131	187132	Mr. George	562	“ If you have come to give me a friendly call , ”
187134	187180	187131	187132	Mr. George	562	“ I am obliged to you ; how are you ? If you have come to see whether there 's any property on the premises , look about you ; you are welcome . If you want to out with something , out with it ! ”
187200	187226	187228	187229	Mr. George	562	“ You see ! It 's her opinion , too . And why the devil that young woman wo n't sit down like a Christian , ”
187239	187245	187228	187229	Mr. George	562	“ I ca n't comprehend . ”
187246	187259	187261	187262	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ She keeps at my side to attend to me , sir , ”
187264	187297	187261	187262	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ I am an old man , my dear Mr. George , and I need some attention . I can carry my years ; I am not a Brimstone poll - parrot ; ”
187307	187317	187261	187262	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ but I need attention , my dear friend . ”
187318	187321	187323	187324	the trooper	11982	“ Well ! ”
187335	187339	187323	187324	the trooper	11982	“ Now then ? ”
187340	187361	187261	187262	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ My friend in the city , Mr. George , has done a little business with a pupil of yours . ”
187362	187366	187368	187369	Mr. George	562	“ Has he ? ”
187371	187379	187368	187369	Mr. George	562	“ I am sorry to hear it . ”
187380	187385	187386	187387	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Yes , sir . ”
187392	187422	187386	187387	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ He is a fine young soldier now , Mr. George , by the name of Carstone . Friends came forward , and paid it all up , honorable . ”
187423	187427	187429	187430	Mr. George	562	“ Did they ? ”
187432	187448	187429	187430	Mr. George	562	“ Do you think your friend in the city would like a piece of advice ? ”
187449	187462	187368	187369	Mr. George	562	“ I think he would , my dear friend . From you . ”
187463	187504	187429	187430	Mr. George	562	“ I advise him , then , to do no more business in that quarter . There 's no more to be got by it . The young gentleman , to my knowledge , is brought to a dead halt . ”
187505	187529	187531	187532	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ No , no , my dear friend . No , no , Mr. George . No , no , no , sir , ”
187540	187622	187624	187625	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Not quite a dead halt , I think . He has good friends , and he is good for his pay , and he is good for the selling price of his commission , and he is good for his chance in a lawsuit , and he is good for his chance in a wife , and — oh , do you know , Mr. George , I think my friend would consider the young gentleman good for something yet ! ”
187687	187697	187699	187700	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ But to pass from one subject to another , ”
187702	187727	187699	187700	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ To promote the conversation , as a joker might say . To pass , Mr. George , from the ensign to the captain . ”
187728	187737	187739	187740	Mr. George	562	“ What are you up to , now ? ”
187754	187758	187739	187740	Mr. George	562	“ What captain ? ”
187759	187772	187699	187700	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Our captain . The captain we know of . Captain Hawdon . ”
187773	187783	187785	187786	Mr. George	562	“ O ! that 's it , is it ? ”
187807	187830	187794	187794	he	562	“ you are there ! Well ? what about it ? Come , I wo n't be smothered any more . Speak ! ”
187831	187836	187838	187840	the old man	1258	“ My dear friend , ”
187842	187877	187838	187840	the old man	1258	“ I was applied — Judy , shake me up a little!—I was applied to , yesterday , about the captain ; and my opinion still is , that the captain is not dead . ”
187878	187881	187883	187884	Mr. George	562	“ Bosh ! ”
187886	187896	187902	187902	his	1258	“ What was your remark , my dear friend ? ”
187908	187911	187902	187902	his	1258	“ Bosh ! ”
187912	187915	187917	187918	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Ho ! ”
187920	187962	187917	187918	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Mr. George , of my opinion you can judge for yourself , according to the questions asked of me , and the reasons given for asking 'em . Now , what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants ? ”
187963	187967	187969	187970	Mr. George	562	“ A job , ”
187972	187978	187969	187970	Mr. George	562	“ Nothing of the kind ! ”
187979	187988	187990	187991	Mr. George	562	“ Ca n't be a lawyer , then , ”
188003	188055	187990	187991	Mr. George	562	“ My dear friend , he is a lawyer , and a famous one . He wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon 's writing . He do n't want to keep it . He only wants to see it , and compare it with a writing in his possession . ”
188056	188059	187969	187970	Mr. George	562	“ Well ? ”
188060	188131	187990	187991	Mr. George	562	“ Well , Mr. George . Happening to remember the advertisement concerning Captain Hawdon , and any information that could be given respecting him , he looked it up and came to me — just as you did , my dear friend . Will you shake hands ? So glad you came , that day ! I should have missed forming such a friendship , if you had n't come ! ”
188132	188138	188140	188141	Mr. George	562	“ Well , Mr. Smallweed ? ”
188153	188180	188182	188184	the old man	1258	“ I had no such thing . I have nothing but his signature . Plague pestilence and famine , battle murder and sudden death upon him , ”
188211	188227	188207	188207	his	1258	“ I have half a million of his signatures , I think ! But you , ”
188251	188284	188236	188236	Judy	556	“ you , my dear Mr. George , are likely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose . Anything would suit the purpose , written in the hand . ”
188285	188292	188294	188295	the trooper	11982	“ Some writing in that hand , ”
188299	188306	188294	188295	the trooper	11982	“ may be , I have . ”
188307	188312	188236	188236	Judy	556	“ My dearest friend ! ”
188313	188321	188236	188236	Judy	556	“ May be , I have not . ”
188322	188325	188327	188328	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Ho ! ”
188334	188359	188327	188328	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ But if I had bushels of it , I would not show as much as would make a cartridge , without knowing why . ”
188360	188380	188236	188236	Judy	556	“ Sir , I have told you why . My dear Mr. George , I have told you why . ”
188381	188385	188387	188388	the trooper	11982	“ Not enough , ”
188394	188404	188391	188391	his	11982	“ I must know more , and approve it . ”
188405	188427	188429	188430	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Then , will you come to the lawyer ? My dear friend , will you come and see the gentleman ? ”
188449	188488	188494	188494	he	557	“ I told him it was probable I might call upon him , between ten and eleven this forenoon ; and it 's now half after ten . Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr. George ? ”
188489	188492	188494	188494	he	557	“ Hum ! ”
188498	188519	188494	188494	he	557	“ I do n't mind that . Though why this should concern you so much , I do n't know . ”
188520	188578	188580	188581	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Everything concerns me , that has a chance in it of bringing anything to light about him . Did n't he take us all in ? Did n't he owe us immense sums , all round ? Concern me ? Who can anything about him concern , more than me ? Not , my dear friend , ”
188587	188610	188584	188584	his	557	“ that I want you to betray anything . Far from it . Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? ”
188611	188628	188584	188584	his	557	“ Ay ! I 'll come in a moment . I promise nothing , you know . ”
188629	188639	188584	188584	his	557	“ No , my dear Mr. George ; no . ”
188640	188667	188668	188669	Mr. George	562	“ And you mean to say you 're going to give me a lift to this place , wherever it is , without charging for it ? ”
188783	188788	188790	188791	the trooper	11982	“ I am ready , ”
188796	188815	188790	188791	the trooper	11982	“ Phil , you can carry this old gentleman to his coach , and make nothing of him . ”
188816	188828	188830	188831	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ O dear me ! O Lord ! Stop a moment ! ”
188833	188853	188830	188831	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ He 's so very prompt ! Are you sure you can do it carefully , my worthy man ? ”
189067	189079	189054	189055	Mr. George	562	“ What , Mr. Tulkinghorn 's your man , is he ? ”
189080	189095	189054	189055	Mr. George	562	“ Yes , my dear friend . Do you know him , Mr. George ? ”
189096	189126	189054	189055	Mr. George	562	“ Why , I have heard of him — seen him too , I think . But I do n't know him , and he do n't know me . ”
189255	189264	189222	189222	He	562	“ ‘ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ’ ”
189270	189282	189265	189266	Mr. George	562	“ Ha ! ‘ Manor of Chesney Wold . ’ Humph ! ”
189309	189324	189283	189284	Mr. George	562	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and Manor of Chesney Wold , hey ? ”
189325	189335	189337	189338	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Worth a mint of money , Mr. George ! ”
189344	189348	189337	189338	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Powerfully rich ! ”
189349	189363	189283	189284	Mr. George	562	“ Who do you mean ? This old gentleman , or the Baronet ? ”
189364	189371	189337	189338	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ This gentleman , this gentleman . ”
189372	189396	189398	189399	Mr. George	562	“ So I have heard ; and knows a thing or two , I 'll hold a wager . Not bad quarters either , ”
189405	189413	189398	189399	Mr. George	562	“ See the strong box , yonder ! ”
189502	189512	189513	189513	he	293	“ Good morning , Mr. Smallweed , good morning ! ”
189520	189535	189513	189513	he	293	“ You have brought the serjeant , I see . Sit down , serjeant . ”
189572	189580	189550	189550	he	293	“ You 'll do , my friend ! ”
189581	189587	189588	189588	he	293	“ Sit down , serjeant , ”
189614	189625	189588	189588	he	293	“ Cold and raw this morning , cold and raw ! ”
189666	189677	189681	189681	he	293	“ Now , I can feel what I am about ! ”
189687	189691	189692	189694	The old gentleman	1026	“ Mr. Smallweed . ”
189710	189723	189700	189700	Judy	556	“ You have brought our good friend the serjeant , I see . ”
189724	189729	189731	189732	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Yes , sir , ”
189744	189755	189731	189732	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ And what does the serjeant say about this business ? ”
189756	189760	189770	189770	his	557	“ Mr. George , ”
189774	189782	189770	189770	his	557	“ this is the gentleman , sir . ”
189824	189834	189820	189821	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Well , George?—I believe your name is George ? ”
189835	189842	189770	189770	his	557	“ It is so , sir . ”
189843	189851	189820	189821	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ What do you say , George ? ”
189852	189860	189862	189863	the trooper	11982	“ I ask your pardon , sir , ”
189865	189876	189862	189863	the trooper	11982	“ but I should wish to know what you say ? ”
189877	189886	189820	189821	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Do you mean in point of reward ? ”
189887	189897	189862	189863	the trooper	11982	“ I mean in point of everything , sir . ”
189915	189922	189910	189910	he	539	“ You 're a Brimstone beast ! ”
189946	189957	189933	189933	himself	539	“ I was thinking of your grandmother , my dear . ”
189958	189964	189965	189966	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ I supposed , serjeant , ”
189983	190045	189970	189970	he	293	“ that Mr. Smallweed might have sufficiently explained the matter . It lies in the smallest compass , however . You served under Captain Hawdon at one time , and were his attendant in illness , and rendered him many little services , and were rather in his confidence , I am told . That is so , is it not ? ”
190046	190055	190057	190058	Mr. George	562	“ Yes , sir , that is so , ”
190064	190144	190057	190058	Mr. George	562	“ Therefore you may happen to have in your possession something — anything , no matter what — accounts , instructions , orders , a letter , anything — in Captain Hawdon 's writing . I wish to compare his writing with some that I have . If you can give me the opportunity , you shall be rewarded for your trouble . Three , four , five , guineas , you would consider handsome , I dare say . ”
190145	190152	190154	190155	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Noble , my dear friend ! ”
190162	190206	190154	190155	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ If not , say how much more , in your conscience as a soldier , you can demand . There is no need for you to part with the writing , against your inclination — though I should prefer to have it . ”
190242	190247	190252	190252	his	293	“ The question is , ”
190260	190273	190252	190252	his	293	“ first , whether you have any of Captain Hawdon 's writing ? ”
190274	190289	190291	190292	Mr. George	562	“ First , whether I have any of Captain Hawdon 's writing , sir , ”
190294	190308	190291	190292	Mr. George	562	“ Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? ”
190309	190325	190327	190328	Mr. George	562	“ Secondly , what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it , sir , ”
190330	190346	190348	190349	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Thirdly , you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that , ”
190362	190376	190378	190379	Mr. George	562	“ Whether it is at all like that , sir . Just so , ”
190447	190450	190452	190453	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Well ? ”
190455	190461	190452	190453	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ What do you say ? ”
190462	190467	190469	190470	Mr. George	562	“ Well , sir , ”
190478	190496	190469	190470	Mr. George	562	“ I would rather , if you 'll excuse me , have nothing to do with this . ”
190505	190509	190497	190498	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Why not ? ”
190510	190515	190517	190518	the trooper	11982	“ Why , sir , ”
190520	190609	190611	190612	Mr. George	562	“ Except on military compulsion , I am not a man of business . Among civilians I am what they call in Scotland a ne'er - do - weel . I have no head for papers , sir . I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions . I mentioned to Mr. Smallweed , only an hour or so ago , that when I come into things of this kind I feel as if I was being smothered . And that is my sensation , ”
190620	190626	190611	190612	Mr. George	562	“ at the present moment . ”
190714	190718	190710	190710	he	539	“ my dear friend ”
190722	190725	190710	190710	he	539	“ Brim ; ”
190804	190817	190795	190796	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ You are the best judge of your own interest , serjeant . ”
190818	190828	190898	190899	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Take care you do no harm by this . ”
190829	190836	190795	190796	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Please yourself , please yourself . ”
190837	190850	190852	190852	he	539	“ If you know what you mean , that 's quite enough . ”
190926	190934	190936	190937	Mr. George	562	“ I do assure you , sir , ”
190939	191007	190936	190937	Mr. George	562	“ not to say it offensively , that between you and Mr. Smallweed here , I really am being smothered fifty times over . I really am , sir . I am not a match for you gentlemen . Will you allow me to ask , why you want to see the captain 's hand , in the case that I could find any specimen of it ? ”
191015	191082	191012	191012	his	293	“ No . If you were a man of business , serjeant , you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons , very harmless in themselves , for many such wants , in the profession to which I belong . But if you are afraid of doing any injury to Captain Hawdon , you may set your mind at rest about that . ”
191083	191092	191113	191114	the trooper	11982	“ Ay ! he is dead , sir . ”
191093	191097	191098	191099	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Is he ? ”
191106	191111	191113	191114	the trooper	11982	“ Well , sir , ”
191126	191212	191214	191215	Mr. George	562	“ I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction . If it would be any satisfaction to any one , that I should be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing to do with this , by a friend of mine , who has a better head for business than I have , and who is an old soldier , I am willing to consult with him . I — I really am so completely smothered myself , at present , ”
191225	191241	191214	191215	Mr. George	562	“ that I do n't know but what it might be a satisfaction to me . ”
191300	191315	191317	191318	the trooper	11982	“ I 'll consult my friend , then , by your leave , sir , ”
191320	191354	191317	191318	the trooper	11982	“ and I 'll take the liberty of looking in again with a final answer in the course of the day . Mr. Smallweed , if you wish to be carried down stairs — ”
191355	191384	191317	191318	the trooper	11982	“ In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment . Will you first let me speak half a word with this gentleman , in private ? ”
191385	191398	191399	191400	The trooper	11982	“ Certainly , sir . Do n't hurry yourself on my account . ”
191424	191438	191440	191441	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ If I was n't as weak as a Brimstone Baby , sir , ”
191471	191529	191467	191467	his	557	“ I 'd tear the writing away from him . He 's got it buttoned in his breast . I saw him put it there . Judy saw him put it there . Speak up , you crabbed image for the sign of a walking - stick shop , and say you saw him put it there ! ”
191582	191593	191594	191595	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Violence will not do for me , my friend , ”
191600	191634	191594	191595	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ No , no , I know , I know , sir . But it 's chafing and galling — it's — it 's worse than your smattering chattering Magpie of a grandmother , ”
191647	191752	191754	191755	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ to know he has got what 's wanted , and wo n't give it up . He , not to give it up ! He ! A vagabond ! But never mind , sir , never mind . At the most , he has only his own way for a little while . I have him periodically in a vice . I 'll twist him , sir . I 'll screw him , sir . If he wo n't do it with a good grace , I 'll make him do it with a bad one , sir!—Now , my dear Mr. George , ”
191768	191781	191764	191764	he	557	“ I am ready for your kind assistance , my excellent friend ! ”
192163	192191	192157	192158	Mr. George	562	“ She 's as usual , washing greens . I never saw her , except upon a baggage - wagon , when she was n't washing greens ! ”
192255	192273	192274	192275	The trooper	11982	“ George , I never see you , but I wish you was a hundred mile away ! ”
192315	192319	192320	192320	she	1219	“ I never , ”
192323	192346	192320	192320	she	1219	“ George , consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute when you 're near him . You are that restless and that roving — ”
192347	192363	192411	192412	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Yes ! I know I am , Mrs. Bagnet . I know I am . ”
192364	192370	192372	192373	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ You know you are ! ”
192375	192387	192372	192373	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ What 's the use of that ? Why are you ? ”
192388	192398	192400	192401	the trooper	11982	“ The nature of the animal , I suppose , ”
192406	192409	192411	192412	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Ah ! ”
192417	192450	192411	192412	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ but what satisfaction will the nature of the animal be to me , when the animal shall have tempted my Mat away from the musical business to New Zealand or Australey ! ”
192585	192589	192591	192592	the trooper	11982	“ Mrs. Bagnet , ”
192594	192618	192591	192592	the trooper	11982	“ I am on my parole with you . Mat will get no harm from me . You may trust me so far . ”
192619	192636	192637	192638	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Well , I think I may . But the very looks of you are unsettling , ”
192641	192676	192637	192638	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Ah George , George ! If you had only settled down , and married Joe Pouch 's widow when he died in North America , she 'd have combed your hair for you . ”
192677	192687	192689	192690	the trooper	11982	“ It was a chance for me , certainly , ”
192700	192761	192689	192690	the trooper	11982	“ but I shall never settle down into a respectable man now . Joe Pouch 's widow might have done me good — there was something in her — and something of her — but I could n't make up my mind to it . If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as Mat found ! ”
192824	192832	192834	192834	George	562	“ Why , Quebec , my poppet , ”
192845	192858	192834	192834	George	562	“ And little Malta , too ! Come and kiss your Bluffy ! ”
192966	192973	192975	192976	Mr. George	562	“ And how 's Young Woolwich ? ”
192978	192984	192986	192987	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Ah ! There now ! ”
193010	193036	193007	193007	her	606	“ Would you believe it ? Got an engagement at the Theayter , with his father , to play the fife in a military piece . ”
193037	193044	193046	193047	Mr. George	562	“ Well done , my godson ! ”
193053	193058	193060	193061	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ I believe you ! ”
193063	193078	193060	193061	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ He 's a Briton . That 's what Woolwich is . A Briton . ”
193079	193097	193099	193100	Mr. George	562	“ And Mat blows away at his bassoon , and you 're respectable civilians one and all , ”
193102	193168	193099	193100	Mr. George	562	“ Family people . Children growing up . Mat 's old mother in Scotland , and your old father somewhere else , corresponded with ; and helped a little ; and — well , well ! To be sure , I do n't know why I should n't be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! ”
193472	193475	193477	193478	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ George , ”
193480	193538	193477	193478	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ You know me . It 's my old girl that advises . She has the head . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . Wait till the greens is off her mind . Then , we 'll consult . Whatever the old girl says , do — do it ! ”
193539	193546	193548	193549	the other	9883	“ I intend to , Mat , ”
193551	193564	193548	193549	the other	9883	“ I would sooner take her opinion than that of a college . ”
193565	193568	193570	193571	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ College , ”
193581	193627	193570	193571	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ What college could you leave — in another quarter of the world — with nothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella — to make its way home to Europe ? The old girl would do it to - morrow . Did it once ! ”
193628	193633	193635	193636	Mr. George	562	“ You are right , ”
193638	193642	193635	193636	Mr. George	562	“ What college , ”
193646	193700	193635	193636	Mr. George	562	“ could you set up in life — with two penn'orth of white lime — a penn'orth of fuller 's earth — a ha'porth of sand — and the rest of the change out of sixpence , in money ? That 's what the old girl started on . In the present business . ”
193701	193713	193570	193571	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ I am rejoiced to hear it 's thriving , Mat . ”
193714	193719	193721	193722	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ The old girl , ”
193726	193768	193721	193722	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ saves . Has a stocking somewhere . With money in it . I never saw it . But I know she 's got it . Wait till the greens is off her mind . Then she 'll set you up . ”
193769	193775	193777	193778	Mr. George	562	“ She is a treasure ! ”
193780	193892	193893	193893	George	562	“ She 's more . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . It was the old girl that brought out my musical abilities . I should have been in the artillery now , but for the old girl . Six years I hammered at the fiddle . Ten at the flute . The old girl said it would n't do ; intention good , but want of flexibility ; try the bassoon . The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster of the Rifle Regiment . I practised in the trenches . Got on , got another , get a living by it ! ”
193911	193916	193918	193919	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ The old girl , ”
193923	193970	193918	193919	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ is a thoroughly fine woman . Consequently , she is like a thoroughly fine day . Gets finer as she gets on . I never saw the old girl 's equal . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained ! ”
194418	194431	194433	194433	he	605	“ That 's the whole of it , is it , George ? ”
194435	194443	194433	194433	he	605	“ That 's the whole of it . ”
194444	194452	194433	194433	he	605	“ You act according to my opinion ? ”
194453	194459	194461	194461	George	562	“ I shall be guided , ”
194463	194468	194461	194461	George	562	“ entirely by it . ”
194469	194473	194475	194476	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ Old girl , ”
194478	194494	194475	194476	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ give him my opinion . You know it . Tell him what it is . ”
194746	194751	194752	194752	he	562	“ A family home , ”
194760	194865	194752	194752	he	562	“ however small it is , makes a man like me look lonely . But it 's well I never made that evolution of matrimony . I should n't have been fit for it . I am such a vagabond still , even at my present time of life , that I could n't hold to the gallery a month together , if it was a regular pursuit , or if I did n't camp there , gypsey fashion . Come ! I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody : that 's something . I have not done that , for many a long year ! ”
194959	194970	194942	194943	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ Who is that ? What are you doing there ? ”
194971	194986	194942	194943	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ I ask your pardon , sir . It 's George . The serjeant . ”
194987	195003	194942	194943	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ And could n't George , the serjeant , see that my door was locked ? ”
195004	195022	195024	195025	the trooper	11982	“ Why no , sir , I could n't . At any rate , I did n't , ”
195030	195045	195024	195025	the trooper	11982	“ Have you changed your mind ? or are you in the same mind ? ”
195059	195067	195051	195051	he	293	“ In the same mind , sir . ”
195068	195088	195090	195091	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ I thought so . That 's sufficient . You can go . So , you are the man , ”
195100	195111	195090	195091	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ in whose hiding - place Mr. Gridley was found ? ”
195112	195120	195122	195123	the trooper	11982	“ Yes , I am the man , ”
195132	195138	195122	195123	the trooper	11982	“ What then , sir ? ”
195139	195183	195195	195195	him	293	“ What then ? I do n't like your associates . You should not have seen the inside of my door this morning , if I had thought of your being that man . Gridley ? A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow . ”
195247	195254	195255	195256	the trooper	11982	“ A pretty character to bear , ”
195269	195278	195264	195264	he	11982	“ A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow ! ”
195608	195612	195601	195601	Murders	611	“ will out . ”
196750	196759	196761	196761	Volumnia	614	“ I occasionally meet on my staircase here , ”
196783	196801	196761	196761	Volumnia	614	“ one of the prettiest girls , I think , that I ever saw in my life . ”
196802	196810	196812	196813	Sir Leicester	290	“ A protegée of my lady 's , ”
196815	196847	196849	196850	Miss Volumnia	614	“ I thought so . I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out . She really is a marvel . A dolly sort of beauty perhaps , ”
196857	196871	196872	196873	Sir Leicester	290	“ but in its way , perfect ; such bloom I never saw ! ”
196890	196893	196895	196896	my Lady	996	“ Indeed , ”
196900	196926	196895	196896	my Lady	996	“ if there is any uncommon eye in the case , it is Mrs. Rouncewell 's , and not mine . Rosa is her discovery . ”
196927	196934	196872	196873	Sir Leicester	290	“ Your maid , I suppose ? ”
196935	196953	196895	196896	my Lady	996	“ No . My anything ; pet — secretary — messenger — I do n't know what . ”
196954	197000	197002	197002	Volumnia	614	“ You like to have her about you , as you would like to have a flower , or a bird , or a picture , or a poodle — no , not a poodle , though — or anything else that was equally pretty ? ”
197006	197049	197002	197002	Volumnia	614	“ Yes , how charming now ! and how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking . She must be an immense age , and yet she is as active and handsome!—She is the dearest friend I have , positively ! ”
197095	197102	197092	197092	he	290	“ You are right , Volumnia ; ”
197111	197123	197092	197092	he	290	“ She has no daughter of her own , has she ? ”
197124	197143	197144	197144	My	0	“ Mrs. Rouncewell ? No , Volumnia . She has a son . Indeed , she had two . ”
197172	197207	197209	197210	Sir Leicester	290	“ And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , ”
197215	197239	197209	197210	Sir Leicester	290	“ that I have been informed , by Mr. Tulkinghorn , that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go into Parliament . ”
197248	197253	197255	197256	Sir Leicester	290	“ Yes , indeed , ”
197258	197262	197255	197256	Sir Leicester	290	“ Into Parliament . ”
197263	197280	197282	197282	Volumnia	614	“ I never heard of such a thing ! Good gracious , what is the man ? ”
197284	197296	197282	197282	Volumnia	614	“ He is called , I believe — an — Ironmaster . ”
197347	197384	197386	197387	Sir Leicester	290	“ He has declined the proposal , if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn be correct , as I have no doubt it is , Mr. Tulkinghorn being always correct and exact ; still that does not , ”
197389	197413	197386	197387	Sir Leicester	290	“ that does not lessen the anomaly ; which is fraught with strange considerations — startling considerations , as it appears to me . ”
197450	197459	197460	197460	he	290	“ I must beg you , my Lady , ”
197466	197497	197460	197460	he	290	“ to remain a few moments ; for this individual of whom I speak , arrived this evening shortly before dinner , and requested — in a very becoming note ; ”
197512	197569	197498	197499	Sir Leicester	290	“ I am bound to say , in a very becoming and well expressed note — the favor of a short interview with yourself and myself , on the subject of this young girl . As it appeared that he wished to depart to - night , I replied that we would see him before retiring . ”
197612	197634	197606	197607	Sir Leicester	290	“ Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell , in the housekeeper 's apartments , and say I can receive him now . ”
197742	197776	197777	197781	The head of the Dedlocks	4724	“ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , as I have already apologised for intruding on you , I can not do better than be very brief . I thank you , Sir Leicester . ”
197801	197836	197797	197797	his	366	“ In these busy times , when so many great undertakings are in progress , people like myself have so many workmen in so many places , that we are always on the flight . ”
197964	197972	197974	197975	Mr. Rouncewell	366	“ Lady Dedlock has been so kind , ”
197987	198093	197974	197975	Mr. Rouncewell	366	“ as to place near her a young beauty of the name of Rosa . Now , my son has fallen in love with Rosa ; and has asked my consent to his proposing marriage to her , and to their becoming engaged if she will take him — which I suppose she will . I have never seen Rosa until to - day , but I have some confidence in my son 's good sense — even in love . I find her what he represents her , to the best of my judgment ; and my mother speaks of her with great commendation . ”
198094	198102	198104	198105	my Lady	996	“ She in all respects deserves it , ”
198107	198137	198104	198105	my Lady	996	“ I am happy , Lady Dedlock , that you say so ; and I need not comment on the value to me of your kind opinion of her . ”
198138	198141	198143	198144	Sir Leicester	290	“ That , ”
198160	198166	198151	198151	he	290	“ must be quite unnecessary . ”
198167	198335	198104	198105	my Lady	996	“ Quite unnecessary , Sir Leicester . Now , my son is a very young man , and Rosa is a very young woman . As I made my way , so my son must make his ; and his being married at present is out of the question . But supposing I gave my consent to his engaging himself to this pretty girl , if this pretty girl will engage herself to him , I think it a piece of candor to say at once — I am sure , Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , you will understand and excuse me — I should make it a condition that she did not remain at Chesney Wold . Therefore , before communicating further with my son , I take the liberty of saying that if her removal would be in any way inconvenient or objectionable , I will hold the matter over with him for any reasonable time , and leave it precisely where it is . ”
198401	198409	198411	198412	Sir Leicester	290	“ Am I to understand , sir , ”
198414	198422	198423	198423	he	290	“ and is my Lady to understand ; ”
198452	198491	198423	198423	he	290	“ am I to understand , Mr. Rouncewell , and is my Lady to understand , sir , that you consider this young woman too good for Chesney Wold , or likely to be injured by remaining here ? ”
198492	198499	198423	198423	he	290	“ Certainly not , Sir Leicester . ”
198500	198508	198423	198423	he	290	“ I am glad to hear it . ”
198515	198521	198523	198524	my Lady	996	“ Pray , Mr. Rouncewell , ”
198546	198554	198535	198535	her	996	“ explain to me what you mean . ”
198555	198569	198571	198571	her	996	“ Willingly , Lady Dedlock . There is nothing I could desire more . ”
198624	198741	198621	198621	her	996	“ I am the son of your housekeeper , Lady Dedlock , and passed my childhood about this house . My mother has lived here half a century , and will die here I have no doubt . She is one of those examples — perhaps as good a one as there is — of love , and attachment , and fidelity in such a station , which England may well be proud of ; but of which no order can appropriate the whole pride or the whole merit , because such an instance bespeaks high worth on two sides ; on the great side , assuredly ; on the small one , no less assuredly . ”
198782	198801	198807	198807	his	290	“ Pardon me for saying what is so obvious , but I would n't have it hastily supposed , ”
198813	198895	198807	198807	his	290	“ that I am ashamed of my mother 's position here , or wanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family . I certainly may have desired — I certainly have desired , Lady Dedlock — that my mother should retire after so many years , and end her days with me . But , as I have found that to sever this strong bond would be to break her heart , I have long abandoned that idea . ”
198924	198929	198931	198932	the visitor	9886	“ I have been , ”
198940	199039	199051	199051	he	4745	“ an apprentice , and a workman . I have lived on workman 's wages , years and years , and beyond a certain point have had to educate myself . My wife was a foreman 's daughter , and plainly brought up . We have three daughters , besides this son of whom I have spoken ; and being fortunately able to give them greater advantages than we had ourselves , we have educated them well ; very well . It has been one of our great cares and pleasures to make them worthy of any station . ”
199057	199065	199051	199051	he	4745	“ even of the Chesney Wold station . ”
199349	199361	199340	199340	they	4762	” Sir Leicester 's magnificence explodes . Calmly , but terribly . “
199365	199395	199340	199340	they	4762	” says Sir Leicester , with his right hand in the breast of his blue coat — the attitude of state in which he is painted in the gallery : “
199408	199415	199397	199397	you	366	” here he resists a disposition to choke—“a
199418	199419	199420	199420	I	0	” “
199456	199487	199445	199445	I	0	” Sir Leicester directs his majestic glance down one side of the long drawing - room , and up the other , before he can believe that he is awake . “
199522	199523	199524	199525	Sir Leicester	290	” “
199548	199549	199552	199553	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” “
199555	199560	199552	199553	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” returns Sir Leicester , “
199576	199577	199565	199565	you	366	” “
199591	199599	199588	199588	I	0	” the ironmaster is reddening a little , “
199622	199757	199758	199758	My	0	” From the village school of Chesney Wold , intact as it is this minute , to the whole framework of society ; from the whole framework of society , to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous cracks in consequence of people ( ironmasters , lead - mistresses , and what not ) not minding their catechism , and getting out of the station unto which they are called — necessarily and for ever , according to Sir Leicester 's rapid logic , the first station in which they happen to find themselves ; and from that , to their educating other people out of their stations , and so obliterating the landmarks , and opening the floodgates , and all the rest of it ; this is the swift progress of the Dedlock mind . “
199773	199785	199767	199767	me	0	” She has given a faint indication of intending to speak . “
200000	200024	200025	200026	Sir Leicester	290	” The visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity , but she says nothing . He then rises and replies : “
200061	200062	200063	200064	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” “
200066	200082	200063	200064	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” says Sir Leicester , with all the nature of a gentleman shining in him , “
200126	200127	200128	200128	I	0	” “
200132	200137	200128	200128	I	0	” adds my Lady . “
200173	200238	200259	200260	My Lady	996	” Therewith the ironmaster takes his departure ; Sir Leicester ringing the bell , and my Lady rising as he leaves the room . When my Lady goes to her boudoir , she sits down thoughtfully by the fire ; and , inattentive to the Ghost 's Walk , looks at Rosa , writing in an inner room . Presently my Lady calls her . “
200255	200256	200251	200251	you	9043	” “
200262	200277	200251	200251	you	9043	” My Lady , looking at the downcast and blushing face , says smiling : “
200289	200290	200284	200285	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	” “
200315	200316	200311	200311	him	1921	” “
200334	200335	200325	200325	you	9043	” “
200347	200390	200338	200338	he	1921	” And Rosa bursts into tears . Is this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty , smoothing her dark hair with that motherly touch , and watching her with eyes so full of musing interest ? Aye , indeed it is ! “
200412	200413	200406	200406	you	9043	” “
200438	200439	200428	200428	I	0	” “
200461	200462	200465	200466	my Lady	996	” “
200471	200486	200491	200492	my child	9062	” Rosa looks up for the first time , quite frightened at the thought . “
200522	201331	200499	200499	I	0	” Rosa , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand . My Lady takes the hand with which she has caught it , and , standing with her eyes fixed on the fire , puts it about and about between her own two hands , and gradually lets it fall . Seeing her so absorbed , Rosa softly withdraws ; but still my Lady 's eyes are on the fire . In search of what ? Of any hand that is no more , of any hand that never was , of any touch that might have magically changed her life ? Or does she listen to the Ghost 's Walk , and think what step does it most resemble ? A man 's ? A woman 's ? The pattering of a little child 's feet , ever coming on — on — on ? Some melancholy influence is upon her ; or why should so proud a lady close the doors , and sit alone upon the hearth so desolate ? Volumnia is away next day , and all the cousins are scattered before dinner . Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir Leicester , at breakfast time , of the obliteration of landmarks , and opening of floodgates , and cracking of the framework of society , manifested through Mrs. Rouncewell 's son . Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant , and connects it with the feebleness of William Buffy when in office , and really does feel deprived of a stake in the country — or the pension list — or something — by fraud and wrong . As to Volumnia , she is handed down the great staircase by Sir Leicester , as eloquent upon the theme , as if there were a general rising in the North of England to obtain her rouge - pot and pearl necklace . And thus , with a clatter of maids and valets — for it is one appurtenance of their cousinship , that , however difficult they may find it to keep themselves , they must keep maids and valets — the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven ; and the one wintry wind that blows to - day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house , as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves . CHESNEY WOLD is shut up , carpets are rolled into great scrolls in corners of comfortless rooms , bright damask does penance in brown holland , carving and gilding puts on mortification , and the Dedlock ancestors retire from the light of day again . Around and around the house the leaves fall thick — but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow . Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will , and press the leaves into full barrows , and wheel them off , still they lie ankle - deep . Howls the shrill wind round Chesney Wold ; the sharp rain beats , the windows rattle , and the chimneys growl . Mists hide in the avenues , veil the points of view , and move in funeral wise across the rising grounds . On all the house there is a cold , blank smell , like the smell of the little church , though something dryer : suggesting that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there , in the long nights , and leave the flavor of their graves behind them . But the house in town , which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney Wold at the same time ; seldom rejoicing when it rejoices , or mourning when it mourns , excepting when a Dedlock dies ; the house in town shines out awakened . As warm and bright as so much state may be , as delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter as hothouse flowers can make it ; soft and hushed , so that the ticking of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms ; it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir Leicester 's in rainbow - colored wool . And Sir Leicester is glad to repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library , condescendingly perusing the backs of his books , or honoring the fine arts with a glance of approbation . For he has his pictures , ancient and modern . Some , of the Fancy Ball School in which Art occasionally condescends to become a master , which would be best catalogued like the miscellaneous articles in a sale . As , “

201439	201812	201813	201818	The man who wrote this article	4802	” Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often ; there being estate business to do , leases to be renewed , and so on . He sees my Lady pretty often , too ; and he and she are as composed , and as indifferent , and take as little heed of one another , as ever . Yet it may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn , and that he knows it . It may be that he pursues her doggedly and steadily , with no touch of compunction , remorse , or pity . It may be that her beauty , and all the state and brilliancy surrounding her , only give him the greater zest for what he is set upon , and make him the more inflexible in it . Whether he be cold and cruel , whether immovable in what he has made his duty , whether absorbed in love of power , whether determined to have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has burrowed among secrets all his life , whether he in his heart despises the splendor of which he is a distant beam , whether he is always treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his gorgeous clients — whether he be any of this , or all of this , it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon her , in distrustful vigilance , than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer , with his wisp of neckcloth and his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees . Sir Leicester sits in my Lady 's room — that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce — particularly complacent . My Lady — as on that day — sits before the fire with her screen in her hand . Sir Leicester is particularly complacent , because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society . They apply so happily to the late case , that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady 's room expressly to read them aloud . “
201820	201845	201813	201818	The man who wrote this article	4802	” he observes by way of preface , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a Mount , “
201853	201946	201813	201818	The man who wrote this article	4802	” The man 's mind is not so well balanced but that he bores my Lady , who , after a languid effort to listen , or rather a languid resignation of herself to a show of listening , becomes distraught , and falls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her fire at Chesney Wold , and she had never left it . Sir Leicester , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye - glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as “

201968	202015	202016	202018	The young man	1928	” invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the column to find it again . Sir Leicester is reading , with infinite gravity and state , when the door opens , and the Mercury in powder makes this strange announcement : “
202029	202042	202016	202018	The young man	1928	” Sir Leicester pauses , stares , repeats in a killing voice : “
202052	202085	202043	202050	The young man of the name of Guppy	4805	” Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of Guppy , much discomfited , and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance . “
202088	202095	202043	202050	The young man of the name of Guppy	4805	” says Sir Leicester to Mercury , “
202114	202115	202098	202098	you	4806	” “
202150	202176	202143	202143	you	4806	” With this apology , Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at the young man of the name of Guppy , which plainly says , “
202192	202193	202179	202179	you	4806	” “
202205	202210	202199	202199	I	0	” says my Lady . “
202217	202218	202212	202214	the young man	1928	” “
202240	202317	202234	202234	I	0	” Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires , rather declining to accept a bow from the young man as he goes out , and majestically supposing him to be some shoemaker of intrusive appearance . Lady Dedlock looks imperiously at her visitor , when the servant has left the room ; casting her eyes over him from head to foot . She suffers him to stand by the door , and asks him what he wants ? “
202333	202340	202341	202341	You	996	” returns Mr. Guppy , embarrassed . “
202357	202358	202347	202362	the person who has written me so many letters ? ” “ Several , your ladyship	4814	” “
202377	202378	202367	202368	your ladyship	2534	” “
202398	202407	202367	202368	your ladyship	2534	” Mr. Guppy screws his mouth into a silent “
202410	202416	202417	202417	You	996	” and shakes his head . “
202483	202517	202480	202480	you	996	” My Lady , with a careless toss of her screen , turns herself towards the fire again , sitting almost with her back to the young man of the name of Guppy . “
202526	202532	202480	202480	you	996	” says the young man , “
202661	202691	202698	202699	your ladyship	2534	” My Lady 's figure begins to be expressive of some attention . She has ceased to toss the screen , and holds it as if she were listening . “
202703	202712	202698	202699	your ladyship	2534	” says Mr. Guppy , a little emboldened , “
202757	202780	202736	202736	I	0	” After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , Mr. Guppy proceeds . “
202846	202856	202839	202839	I	0	” My Lady turns a little round , and says “
202863	202864	202866	202867	your ladyship	2534	” “
202869	202875	202866	202867	your ladyship	2534	” Mr. Guppy does so . “
202881	202920	202921	202921	I	0	” Mr. Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he has made small notes of his line of argument , and which seems to involve him in the densest obscurity whenever he looks at it ; “
202983	203010	203012	203013	your ladyship	2534	” My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her . “
203015	203020	203012	203013	your ladyship	2534	” says Mr. Guppy , “
203088	203112	203086	203086	I	0	” Mr. Guppy going to the window tumbles into a pair of love - birds , to whom he says in his confusion , “
203122	203161	203115	203115	your	996	” This does not tend to the greater legibility of his notes . He murmurs , growing warm and red , and holding the slip of paper now close to his eyes , now a long way off , “
203188	203194	203195	203195	I	0	” And comes back enlightened . “
203200	203214	203179	203179	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , standing midway between my Lady and his chair , “
203239	203249	203235	203237	Miss Esther Summerson	305	” My Lady 's eyes look at him full . “
203266	203267	203252	203257	a young lady of that name	4842	” “
203281	203318	203276	203276	she	4842	” asks Mr. Guppy , crossing his arms , holding his head on one side , and scratching the corner of his mouth with his memoranda . My Lady removes her eyes from him no more . “
203321	203322	203276	203276	she	4842	” “
203330	203331	203276	203276	she	4842	” “
203334	203340	203342	203343	Mr. Guppy	326	” I think your ladyship , ”
203345	203354	203342	203343	Mr. Guppy	326	“ can hardly remember Miss Summerson 's face ? ”
203355	203372	203342	203343	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I remember the young lady very well . What has this to do with me ? ”
203373	203540	203342	203343	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your ladyship , I do assure you , that having Miss Summerson 's image imprinted on my art — which I mention in confidence — I found , when I had the honor of going over your ladyship 's mansion of Chesney Wold , while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend , such a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship 's own portrait , that it completely knocked me over ; so much so , that I did n't at the moment even know what it was that knocked me over . And now I have the honor of beholding your ladyship near , ( I have often , since that , taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your carriage in the park , when I dare say you was not aware of me , but I never saw your ladyship so near ) , it 's really more surprising than I thought it . ”
203629	203633	203635	203636	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your ladyship , ”
203644	203664	203635	203636	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I am coming to that . Dash these notes . O ! ‘ Mrs. Chadband . ’ Yes . ”
203708	203717	203704	203704	her	996	“ A — stop a minute , though ! ”
203723	203742	203718	203719	Mr. Guppy	326	“ E. S. twice ? O yes ! yes , I see my way now , right on . ”
203762	203924	203758	203759	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your ladyship , there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson 's birth and bringing up . I am informed of that fact , because — which I mention in confidence — I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy 's . Now , as I have already mentioned to your ladyship , Miss Summerson 's image is imprinted on my art . If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honor to be a remote branch of your ladyship 's family she had a right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more decided favor on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet . In fact , as yet she has n't favored them at all . ”
203938	203951	203953	203954	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Now , it 's a very singular circumstance , your ladyship , ”
203956	204060	203953	203954	Mr. Guppy	326	“ though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of us professional men — which I may call myself , for though not admitted yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge and Carboy , on my mother 's advancing from the principal of her little income the money for the stamp , which comes heavy — that I have encountered the person , who lived as servant with the lady who brought Miss Summerson up , before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her . That lady was a Miss Barbary , your ladyship . ”
204109	204114	204116	204117	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Did your ladyship , ”
204119	204128	204116	204117	Mr. Guppy	326	“ ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary ? ”
204129	204141	204116	204117	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I do n't know . I think so . Yes . ”
204142	204155	204156	204156	My	0	“ Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship 's family ? ”
204172	204176	204178	204179	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Not connected ? ”
204181	204201	204178	204179	Mr. Guppy	326	“ O ! Not to your ladyship 's knowledge , perhaps ? Ah ! But might be ? Yes . ”
204214	204310	204208	204208	she	996	“ Very good ! Now , this Miss Barbary was extremely close — seems to have been extraordinarily close for a female , females being generally ( in common life at least ) rather given to conversation — and my witness never had an idea whether she possessed a single relative . On one occasion , and only one , she seems to have been confidential to my witness , on a single point ; and she then told her that the little girl 's real name was not Esther Summerson , but Esther Hawdon . ”
204311	204315	204316	204317	Mr. Guppy	326	“ My God ! ”
204472	204483	204777	204777	she	996	“ Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon ? ”
204484	204491	204777	204777	she	996	“ I have heard it before . ”
204492	204508	204777	204777	she	996	“ Name of any collateral , or remote , branch of your ladyship 's family ? ”
204509	204512	204777	204777	she	996	“ No . ”
204513	204519	204521	204522	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Now , your ladyship , ”
204524	204661	204521	204522	Mr. Guppy	326	“ I come to the last point of the case , so far as I have got it up . It 's going on , and I shall gather it up closer and closer as it goes on . Your ladyship must know — if your ladyship do n't happen , by any chance , to know already — that there was found dead at the house of a person named Krook , near Chancery Lane , some time ago , a law - writer in great distress . Upon which law - writer , there was an inquest ; and which law - writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown . But , your ladyship , I have discovered , very lately , that that law - writer 's name was Hawdon . ”
204662	204670	204777	204777	she	996	“ And what is that to me ? ”
204671	204766	204521	204522	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Aye , your ladyship , that 's the question ! Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man 's death . A lady started up ; a disguised lady , your ladyship , who went to look at the scene of action , and went to look at his grave . She hired a crossing - sweeping boy to show it her . If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . ”
204786	204801	204803	204804	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Oh , I assure your ladyship it 's a very queer start indeed , ”
204806	204836	204803	204804	Mr. Guppy	326	“ If you was to hear him tell about the rings that sparkled on her fingers when she took her glove off , you 'd think it quite romantic . ”
204885	204922	204935	204935	her	996	“ It was supposed , your ladyship , that he left no rag or scrap behind him by which he could possibly be identified . But he did . He left a bundle of old letters . ”
204942	204965	204935	204935	her	996	“ They were taken and secreted . And to - morrow night , your ladyship , they will come into my possession . ”
204966	204978	204935	204935	her	996	“ Still I ask you , what is this to me ? ”
204979	204988	204989	204990	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your ladyship , I conclude with that . ”
204993	205183	204989	204990	Mr. Guppy	326	“ If you think there 's enough , in this chain of circumstances put together — in the undoubted strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship , which is a positive fact for a jury — in her having been brought up by Miss Barbary — in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson 's real name to be Hawdon — in your ladyship 's knowing both those names very well — and in Hawdon 's dying as he did — to give your ladyship a family interest in going further into the case , I will bring those papers here . I do n't know what they are , except that they are old letters : I have never had them in my possession yet . I will bring those papers here , as soon as I get them ; and go over them for the first time with your ladyship . I have told your ladyship my object . I have told your ladyship that I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation , if any complaint was made ; and all is in strict confidence . ”
205271	205278	205280	205281	my Lady	996	“ You may bring the letters , ”
205283	205288	205280	205281	my Lady	996	“ if you choose . ”
205289	205303	205305	205306	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your ladyship is not very encouraging , upon my word and honor , ”
205312	205319	205320	205320	she	996	“ You may bring the letters , ”
205328	205334	205320	205320	she	996	“ if you —— please . ”
205335	205348	205280	205281	my Lady	996	“ It shall be done . I wish your ladyship good day . ”
205386	205404	205406	205407	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Oh ! I assure your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that sort , ”
205409	205438	205406	205407	Mr. Guppy	326	“ and I could n't accept of anything of the kind . I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . ”
205607	205655	205656	205656	RICHARD	320	“ O my child , my child ! Not dead in the first hours of her life , as my cruel sister told me ; but sternly nurtured by her , after she had renounced me and my name ! O my child , O my child ! ”
205707	205715	205719	205719	she	526	“ by her son Allan 's desire , ”
205730	205741	205719	205719	she	526	“ and sent his kind remembrances to all of us , ”
206071	206077	206078	206078	she	526	“ So , Miss Summerson , ”
206087	206134	206078	206078	she	526	“ this , you see , is the fortune inherited by my son . Wherever my son goes , he can claim kindred with Ap Kerrig . He may not have money , but he always has what is much better — family , my dear . ”
206178	206189	206163	206163	I	0	“ It is , my dear , a great thing , ”
206195	206234	206236	206236	she	526	“ It has its disadvantages ; my son 's choice of a wife , for instance , is limited by it ; but the matrimonial choice of the Royal family is limited , in much the same manner . ”
206269	206277	206278	206278	she	526	“ Poor Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , ”
206300	206370	206278	206278	she	526	“ was descended from a great Highland family , the Mac Coorts of Mac Coort . He served his king and country as an officer in the Royal Highlanders , and he died on the field . My son is one of the last representatives of two old families . With the blessing of Heaven he will set them up again , and unite them with another old family . ”
206418	206422	206423	206423	she	526	“ My dear , ”
206428	206498	206423	206423	she	526	“ you have so much sense , and you look at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life , that it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of mine . You do n't know much of my son , my dear ; but you know enough of him , I dare say , to recollect him ? ”
206499	206508	206409	206410	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	“ Yes , ma'am . I recollect him . ”
206509	206540	206423	206423	she	526	“ Yes , my dear . Now , my dear , I think you are a judge of character , and I should like to have your opinion of him ? ”
206541	206547	206549	206549	I	0	“ O , Mrs. Woodcourt ! ”
206551	206557	206549	206549	I	0	“ that is so difficult . ”
206558	206568	206569	206569	she	4892	“ Why is it so difficult , my dear ? ”
206572	206580	206569	206569	she	4892	“ I do n't see it myself . ”
206581	206587	206423	206423	she	526	“ To give an opinion — ”
206588	206602	206603	206603	I	0	“ On so slight an acquaintance , my dear . That 's true . ”
206665	206671	206673	206674	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	“ You do him justice ! ”
206680	206721	206673	206674	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	“ You define him exactly . Allan is a dear fellow , and in his profession faultless . I say it , though I am his mother . Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . ”
206722	206728	206730	206730	I.	0	“ None of us are , ”
206731	206749	206751	206754	the sharp old lady	4896	“ Ah ! But his really are faults that he might correct , and ought to correct , ”
206761	206793	206794	206794	I	0	“ I am so much attached to you , that I may confide in you , my dear , as a third party wholly disinterested , that he is fickleness itself . ”
206832	206841	206842	206844	the old lady	9222	“ You are right again , my dear , ”
206847	206860	206842	206844	the old lady	9222	“ but I do n't refer to his profession , look you . ”
206861	206864	206866	206866	I.	0	“ O ! ”
206867	206870	206872	206872	she	9222	“ No , ”
206874	206958	206872	206872	she	9222	“ I refer , my dear , to his social conduct . He is always paying trivial attentions to young ladies , and always has been , ever since he was eighteen . Now , my dear , he has never really cared for any one of them , and has never meant in doing this to do any harm , or to express anything but politeness and good nature . Still , it 's not right , you know ; is it ? ”
206959	206962	206964	206964	I	0	“ No , ”
206974	206989	206967	206967	she	9222	“ And it might lead to mistaken notions , you see , my dear . ”
206995	207118	207120	207130	the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles	4899	“ Therefore I have told him , many times , that he really should be more careful , both in justice to himself and in justice to others . And he has always said , ‘ Mother , I will be ; but you know me better than anybody else does , and you know I mean no harm — in short , mean nothing . ’ All of which is very true , my dear , but is no justification . However , as he is now gone so far away , and for an indefinite time , and as he will have good opportunities and introductions , we may consider this past and gone . And you , my dear , ”
207132	207141	207120	207130	the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles	4899	“ regarding your dear self , my love ? ”
207142	207148	207223	207223	I	0	“ Me , Mrs. Woodcourt ? ”
207149	207201	207202	207202	I	0	“ Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune , and to find a wife — when do you mean to seek your fortune and to find a husband , Miss Summerson ? Hey , look you ! Now you blush ! ”
207242	207266	207268	207269	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	“ Shall I tell you what I always think of you , and the fortune yet to come for you , my love ? ”
207271	207281	207283	207283	I.	0	“ If you believe you are a good prophet , ”
207284	207333	207283	207283	I.	0	“ Why , then , it is that you will marry some one , very rich and very worthy , much older — five and twenty years , perhaps — than yourself . And you will be an excellent wife , and much beloved , and very happy . ”
207334	207341	207343	207343	I.	0	“ That is a good fortune , ”
207344	207354	207283	207283	I.	0	“ But , why is it to be mine ? ”
207355	207359	207360	207360	she	526	“ My dear , ”
207417	207960	207399	207399	nobody	928	” It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable , but I think it did . I know it did . It made me for some part of that night quite uncomfortable . I was so ashamed of my folly , that I did not like to confess it even to Ada ; and that made me more uncomfortable still . I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady 's confidence , if I could have possibly declined it . It gave me the most inconsistent opinions of her . At one time I thought she was a storyteller , and at another time that she was the pink of truth . Now , I suspected that she was very cunning ; next moment , I believed her honest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple . And , after all , what did it matter to me , and why did it matter to me ? Why could not I , going up to bed with my basket of keys , stop to sit down by her fire , and accommodate myself for a little while to her , at least as well as to anybody else ; and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me ? Impelled towards her , as I certainly was , for I was very anxious that she should like me , and was very glad indeed that she did , why should I harp afterwards , with actual distress and pain , on every word she said , and weigh it over and over again in twenty scales ? Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house , and confidential to me every night , when I yet felt that it was better and safer , somehow , that she should be there than anywhere else ? These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account for . At least , if I could — but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere idleness to go on about it now . So , when Mrs. Woodcourt went away , I was sorry to lose her , but was relieved too . And then Caddy Jellyby came down ; and Caddy brought such a packet of domestic news , that it gave us abundant occupation . First , Caddy declared ( and would at first declare nothing else ) that I was the best adviser that ever was known . This , my pet said , was no news at all ; and this , I said , of course , was nonsense . Then Caddy told us that she was going to be married in a month ; and that if Ada and I would be her bridesmaids , she was the happiest girl in the world . To be sure , this was news indeed ; and I thought we never should have done talking about it , we had so much to say to Caddy , and Caddy had so much to say to us . It seemed that Caddy 's unfortunate papa had got over his bankruptcy—“gone
207965	208056	207399	207399	nobody	928	” was the expression Caddy used , as if it were a tunnel,—with the general clemency and commiseration of his creditors ; and had got rid of his affairs in some blessed manner , without succeeding in understanding them ; and had given up everything he possessed ( which was not worth much I should think , to judge from the state of the furniture ) , and had satisfied every one concerned that he could do no more , poor man . So , he had been honourably dismissed to “
208060	208083	207399	207399	nobody	928	” to begin the world again . What he did at the office , I never knew : Caddy said he was a “
208091	208287	208296	208296	he	10796	” and the only thing I ever understood about that business was , that when he wanted money more than usual he went to the Docks to look for it , and hardly ever found it . As soon as her papa had tranquillised his mind by becoming this shorn lamb , and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden ( where I found the children , when I afterwards went there , cutting the horsehair out of the seats of the chairs , and choking themselves with it ) , Caddy had brought about a meeting between him and old Mr. Turveydrop ; and poor Mr. Jellyby , being very humble and meek , had deferred to Mr. Turveydrop 's Deportment so submissively , that they had become excellent friends . By degrees , old Mr. Turveydrop , thus familiarised with the idea of his son 's marriage , had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand ; and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping , at the Academy in Newman Street , when they would . “
208299	208300	208296	208296	he	10796	” “
208306	208310	208316	208316	he	10796	” said Caddy , “
208401	208402	208406	208406	you	0	” “
208412	208413	208406	208406	you	0	” “
208532	208533	208534	208534	Indians	390	” “
208538	208539	208547	208548	Wild Indians	626	” “
208542	208546	208547	208548	Wild Indians	626	” said Caddy , “
208552	208570	208571	208571	he	340	said,”—(here she began to sob , poor girl , not at all like the happiest girl in the world)—“that
208590	208609	208571	208571	he	340	” Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did not mean these destructive sentiments . “
208629	208633	208635	208635	he	340	” said Caddy ; “
208676	208692	208661	208661	I	0	” I asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her wedding - day was fixed . “
208703	208707	208701	208701	Esther	305	” she returned . “
208759	208768	208735	208735	she	339	” said Caddy , with a sudden idea ; “
208799	208800	208771	208771	she	339	” “
208808	208820	208806	208806	Caddy	328	” said I. For she was under no restraint with us . “
208827	208835	208825	208825	Esther	305	” she returned , drying her eyes , “
208897	209287	208891	208891	she	339	” Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother , but mentioned this with tears , as an undeniable fact : which I am afraid it was . We were so sorry for the poor dear girl , and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such discouragement , that we both at once ( I mean Ada and I ) proposed a little scheme , that made her perfectly joyful . This was , her staying with us for three weeks ; my staying with her for one ; and our all three contriving and cutting out , and repairing , and sewing , and saving , and doing the very best we could think of , to make the most of her stock . My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter ; and brought her out again in triumph , with her boxes , and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten - pound note , which Mr. Jellyby had found in the Docks I suppose , but which he at all events gave her . What my guardian would not have given her , if we had encouraged him , it would be difficult to say ; but we thought it right to compound for no more than her wedding - dress and bonnet . He agreed to this compromise ; and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life , she was happy when we sat down to work . She was clumsy enough with her needle , poor girl , and pricked her fingers as much as she had been used to ink them . She could not help reddening a little , now and then : partly with the smart , and partly with vexation at being able to do no better : but she soon got over that , and began to improve rapidly . So , day after day , she , and my darling , and my little maid Charley , and a milliner out of the town , and I , sat hard at work , as pleasantly as possible . Over and above this , Caddy was very anxious “
209292	209345	209346	209346	Caddy	328	” as she said . Now , Mercy upon us ! the idea of her learning housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke , that I laughed , and coloured up , and fell into a comical confusion when she proposed it . However , I said , “
209368	209942	209359	209359	you	328	” and I showed her all my books and methods , and all my fidgetty ways . You would have supposed that I was showing her some wonderful inventions , by her study of them ; and if you had seen her , whenever I jingled my housekeeping keys , get up and attend me , certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater impostor than I , with a blinder follower than Caddy Jellyby . So , what with working and housekeeping , and lessons to Charley , and backgammon in the evening with my guardian , and duets with Ada , the three weeks slipped fast away . Then I went home , with Caddy , to see what could be done there ; and Ada and Charley remained behind , to take care of my guardian . When I say I went home with Caddy , I mean to the furnished lodging in Hatton Garden . We went to Newman Street two or three times , where preparations were in progress too ; a good many , I observed , for enhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop , and a few for putting the newly - married couple away cheaply at the top of the house ; but our great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the wedding breakfast , and to imbue Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some faint sense of the occasion . The latter was the more difficult thing of the two , because Mrs. Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting - room ( the back one was a mere closet ) , and it was littered down with waste paper and Borrioboolan documents , as an untidy stable might be littered with straw . Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day , drinking strong coffee , dictating , and holding Borrioboolan interviews by appointment . The unwholesome boy , who seemed to me to be going into a decline , took his meals out of the house . When Mr. Jellyby came home , he usually groaned and went down into the kitchen . There he got something to eat , if the servant would give him anything ; and then , feeling that he was in the way , went out and walked about Hatton Garden in the wet . The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down the house , as they had always been accustomed to do . The production of these devoted little sacrifices , in any presentable condition , being quite out of the question at a week 's notice , I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could , on her marriage morning , in the attic where they all slept ; and should confine our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama 's room , and a clean breakfast . In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention , the lattice - work up her back having widened considerably since I first knew her , and her hair looking like the mane of a dustman 's horse . Thinking that the display of Caddy 's wardrobe would be the best means of approaching the subject , I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look at it spread out on Caddy 's bed , in the evening after the unwholesome boy was gone . “
209948	209964	209359	209359	you	328	” said she , rising from her desk , with her usual sweetness of temper , “
210010	210055	210056	210056	My	0	” She came up - stairs with us notwithstanding , and looked at the clothes in her customary far - off manner . They suggested one distinct idea to her ; for she said , with her placid smile , and shaking her head , “
210076	210110	210056	210056	My	0	” On our going down - stairs again , Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday ? And on my replying yes , she said , “
210135	210162	210167	210168	Miss Summerson	305	” I took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted , and that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere . “
210170	210175	210176	210176	you	305	” said Mrs. Jellyby , “
210238	210239	210219	210219	We	4929	” “
210248	210254	210219	210219	We	4929	” said I , smiling . “
210264	210265	210219	210219	We	4929	” “
210270	210275	210219	210219	We	4929	” Mrs. Jellyby replied , “
210293	210823	210824	210825	Poor Pa	340	” The next question was , how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion . I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her writing - table , while Caddy and I discussed it ; occasionally shaking her head at us with a half - reproachful smile , like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling . The state in which her dresses were , and the extraordinary confusion in which she kept them , added not a little to our difficulty ; but at length we devised something not very unlike what a common - place mother might wear on such an occasion . The abstracted manner in which Mrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this attire tried on by the dress - maker , and the sweetness with which she would then observe to me how sorry she was that I had not turned my thoughts to Africa , were consistent with the rest of her behaviour . The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. Jellyby 's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul 's or Saint Peter 's , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in . I believe that nothing belonging to the family , which it had been possible to break , was unbroken at the time of those preparations for Caddy 's marriage ; that nothing which it had been possible to spoil in any way , was unspoilt ; and that no domestic object which was capable of collecting dirt , from a dear child 's knee to the door - plate , was without as much dirt as could well accumulate upon it . Poor Mr. Jellyby , who very seldom spoke , and almost always sat when he was at home with his head against the wall , became interested when he saw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among all this waste and ruin , and took off his coat to help . But such wonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when they were opened — bits of mouldy pie , sour bottles , Mrs. Jellyby 's caps , letters , tea , forks , odd boots and shoes of children , firewood , wafers , saucepan - lids , damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags , footstools , black - lead brushes , bread , Mrs. Jellyby 's bonnets , books with butter sticking to the binding , guttered candle - ends put out by being turned upside down in broken candle - sticks , nutshells , heads and tails of shrimps , dinner - mats , gloves , coffee - grounds , umbrellas — that he looked frightened , and left off again . But he came in regularly every evening , and sat without his coat , with his head against the wall ; as though he would have helped us , if he had known how . “
210827	210852	210824	210825	Poor Pa	340	” said Caddy to me , on the night before the great day , when we really had got things a little to rights . “
210921	210945	210915	210915	Ma	339	” Mr. Jellyby could not hear what she said , but he seemed very low indeed , and shed tears , I thought . “
210956	210960	210961	210961	I	0	” sobbed Caddy . “
211004	211005	211008	211008	Caddy	328	” “
211010	211040	211008	211008	Caddy	328	” said Mr. Jellyby , looking slowly round from the wall . It was the first time , I think , I ever heard him say three words together . “
211045	211057	211060	211060	Caddy	328	” cried Caddy , going to him and embracing him affectionately . “
211062	211067	211060	211060	Caddy	328	“ said Mr. Jellyby . “
211072	211073	211060	211060	Caddy	328	” “
211079	211083	211077	211077	Pa	340	” faltered Caddy . “
211088	211089	211092	211093	my dear	9060	” “
211095	211100	211092	211093	my dear	9060	” said Mr. Jellyby . “
211112	211171	211174	211174	you	340	” I mentioned , in my account of our first visit in Thavies ' Inn , that Richard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his mouth after dinner without saying anything . It was a habit of his . He opened his mouth now , a great many times , and shook his head in a melancholy manner . “
211189	211203	211187	211187	Pa	340	” asked Caddy , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck . “
211213	211568	211569	211569	My	0	” Mr. Jellyby groaned , and laid his head against the wall again ; and this was the only time I ever heard him make any approach to expressing his sentiments on the Borrioboolan question . I suppose he had been more talkative and lively , once ; but he seemed to have been completely exhausted long before I knew him . I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over her papers , and drinking coffee , that night . It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room ; and the clearance it required then , was so discouraging , that Caddy , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust , and cried . But she soon cheered up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed . In the morning it looked , by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity of soap and water , and a little arrangement , quite gay . The plain breakfast made a cheerful show , and Caddy was perfectly charming . But when my darling came , I thought — and I think now — that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet 's . We made a little feast for the children up - stairs , and we put Peepy at the head of the table , and we showed them Caddy in her bridal dress , and they clapped their hands and hurrahed , and Caddy cried to think that she was going away from them , and hugged them over and over again , until we brought Prince up to fetch her away — when , I am sorry to say , Peepy bit him . Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop down - stairs , in a state of Deportment not to be expressed , benignly blessing Caddy , and giving my guardian to understand , that his son 's happiness was his own parental work , and that he sacrificed personal considerations to ensure it . “
211573	211578	211569	211569	My	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
211657	212430	212432	212432	you	4946	” Mr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party — Mr. Pardiggle , an obstinate - looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair , who was always talking in a loud bass voice about his mite , or Mrs. Pardiggle 's mite , or their five boys ' mites . Mr. Gusher , with his hair brushed back as usual , and his knobs of temples shining very much , was also there ; not in the character of a disappointed lover , but as the Accepted of a young — at least , an unmarried — lady , a Miss Wisk , who was also there . Miss Wisk 's mission , my guardian said , was to show the world that woman 's mission was man 's mission ; and that the only genuine mission , of both man and woman , was to be always moving declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings . The guests were few ; but were , as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby 's , all devoted to public objects only . Besides those I have mentioned , there was an extremely dirty lady , with her bonnet all awry , and the ticketed price of her dress still sticking on it , whose neglected home , Caddy told me , was like a filthy wilderness , but whose church was like a fancy fair . A very contentious gentleman , who said it was his mission to be everybody 's brother , but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family , completed the party . A party , having less in common with such an occasion , could hardly have been got together by any ingenuity . Such a mean mission as the domestic mission , was the very last thing to be endured among them ; indeed , Miss Wisk informed us , with great indignation , before we sat down to breakfast , that the idea of woman 's mission lying chiefly in the narrow sphere of Home was an outrageous slander on the part of her Tyrant , Man . One other singularity was , that nobody with a mission — except Mr. Gusher , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstacies with everybody 's mission — cared at all for anybody 's mission . Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only one infallible course was her course of pouncing upon the poor , and applying benevolence to them like a strait - waistcoat ; as Miss Wisk was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation of Woman from the thraldom of her Tyrant , Man . Mrs. Jellyby , all the while , sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but Borrioboola - Gha . But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home , instead of first marrying Caddy . We all went to church , and Mr. Jellyby gave her away . Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop , with his hat under his left arm , ( the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon , ) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig , stood , stiff and high - shouldered , behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony , and afterwards saluted us , I could never say enough to do it justice . Miss Wisk , whom I can not report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of Woman 's wrongs , with a disdainful face . Mrs. Jellyby , with her calm smile and her bright eyes , looked the least concerned of all the company . We duly came back to breakfast , and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of the table , and Mr. Jellyby at the foot . Caddy had previously stolen upstairs , to hug the children again , and tell them that her name was Turveydrop . But this piece of information , instead of being an agreeable surprise to Peepy , threw him on his back in such transports of kicking grief , that I could do nothing on being sent for , but accede to the proposal that he should be admitted to the breakfast table . So he came down , and sat in my lap ; and Mrs. Jellyby , after saying , in reference to the state of his pinafore , “
212444	212717	212434	212434	Peepy	330	” was not at all discomposed . He was very good , except that he brought down Noah with him ( out of an ark I had given him before we went to church ) , and would dip him head first into the wine - glasses , and then put him in his mouth . My guardian , with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face , made something agreeable even out of the ungenial company . None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his , or her , own one subject , and none of them seemed able to talk about even that , as part of a world in which there was anything else ; but my guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy , and the honour of the occasion , and brought us through the breakfast nobly . What we should have done without him , I am afraid to think ; for , all the company despising the bride and bridegroom , and old Mr. Turveydrop — and old Mr. Turveydrop , in virtue of his Deportment , considering himself vastly superior to all the company — it was a very unpromising case . At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go , and when all her property was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take her and her husband to Gravesend . It affected us to see Caddy clinging , then , to her deplorable home , and hanging on her mother 's neck with the greatest tenderness . “
212733	212737	212731	212731	Ma	339	” sobbed Caddy . “
212746	212747	212740	212740	you	339	” “
212753	212758	212751	212751	Caddy	328	” said Mrs. Jellyby , “
212782	212783	212759	212759	I	0	” “
212811	212812	212800	212800	you	339	” “
212817	212822	212813	212813	You	328	” returned Mrs. Jellyby , “
212846	212847	212844	212844	you	0	” “
212861	212870	212871	212871	You	328	” Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy . “
212875	212885	212871	212871	You	328	” said she , lightly patting Caddy 's back . “
212908	213009	213017	213017	father	2756	” Then Caddy hung upon her father , and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain . All this took place in the hall . Her father released her , took out his pocket - handkerchief , and sat down on the stairs with his head against the wall . I hope he found some consolation in walls . I almost think he did . And then Prince took her arm in his , and turned with great emotion and respect to his father , whose Deportment at that moment was overwhelming . “
213019	213027	213017	213017	father	2756	” said Prince , kissing his hand . “
213053	213054	213051	213051	Caddy	328	” “
213057	213061	213051	213051	Caddy	328	” sobbed Caddy . “
213066	213067	213068	213070	My dear son	12230	” “
213072	213077	213068	213070	My dear son	12230	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
213134	213135	213136	213137	Dear father	12277	” “
213141	213145	213136	213137	Dear father	12277	” cried Prince . “
213154	213158	213150	213152	dear Mr. Turveydrop	492	” said Caddy . “
213161	213166	213150	213152	dear Mr. Turveydrop	492	” returned Mr. Turveydrop , “
213219	213220	213208	213208	you	12259	” “
213235	213236	213237	213237	My	0	” “
213241	213246	213237	213237	My	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
213285	213286	213291	213291	father	2756	” “
213303	213304	213291	213291	father	2756	” “
213307	213312	213291	213291	father	2756	” said Mr. Turveydrop . “
213340	213357	213338	213338	Prince	2770	” anticipating some self - denying objection on his son 's part with a great air . “
213390	213489	213388	213388	ye	12259	” They drove away ; and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby , or at Mr. Turveydrop , I did not know . Ada and my guardian were in the same condition when we came to talk it over . But before we drove away , too , I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr. Jellyby . He came up to me in the hall , took both my hands , pressed them earnestly , and opened his mouth twice . I was so sure of his meaning that I said , quite flurried , “
213503	213504	213505	213505	I	0	” “
213516	213529	213530	213530	I	0	” said I , when we three were on our road home . “
213544	213545	213538	213538	Patience	631	” “
213556	213569	213538	213538	Patience	631	” I ventured to ask him . He laughed heartily , and answered “
213572	213573	213538	213538	Patience	631	” “
213585	213590	213582	213582	I	0	” said I. He answered “
213593	213604	213582	213582	I	0	” again ; and this time my dear girl confidently answered “
213607	213632	213582	213582	I	0	” too , and shook the lovely head which , with its blooming flowers against the golden hair , was like the very Spring . “
213644	213885	213640	213642	my ugly darling	4984	” said I , kissing her in my admiration — I could n't help it . Well ! It was only their love for me , I know very well , and it is a long time ago . I must write it , even if I rub it out again , because it gives me so much pleasure . They said there could be no East wind where Somebody was ; they said that wherever Dame Durden went , there was sunshine and summer air . I HAD not been at home again many days , when one evening I went up - stairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley 's shoulder , and see how she was getting on with her copy - book . Writing was a trying business to Charley , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and splash , and sidle into corners , like a saddle - donkey . It was very odd , to see what old letters Charley 's young hand made ; they , so wrinkled , and shrivelled , and tottering ; it , so plump and round . Yet Charley was uncommonly expert at other things , and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched . “
213890	213924	213888	213888	Charley	372	” said I , looking over a copy of the letter O in which it was represented as square , triangular , pear - shaped , and collapsed in all kinds of ways , “
213945	213974	213943	213943	Charley	372	” Then I made one , and Charley made one , and the pen would n't join Charley 's neatly , but twisted it up into a knot . “
213987	214031	213980	213980	We	4985	” Charley laid down her pen , the copy being finished ; opened and shut her cramped little hand ; looked gravely at the page , half in pride and half in doubt ; and got up , and dropped me a curtsey . “
214055	214056	214046	214053	a poor person of the name of Jenny	4989	” “
214066	214067	214068	214068	She	4991	” “
214121	214122	214115	214115	I	0	” “
214134	214135	214132	214132	Charley	372	” “
214173	214174	214171	214171	miss	9100	” “
214187	214188	214192	214192	she	4991	” “
214195	214199	214192	214192	she	4991	” returned Charley . “
214216	214217	214224	214224	they	5002	” “
214228	214229	214232	214232	miss	9100	” “
214234	214265	214232	214232	miss	9100	” If Charley could only have made the letters in her copy as round as the eyes with which she looked into my face , they would have been excellent . “
214317	214332	214334	214334	she	5005	” said Charley , with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride , “
214342	214343	214345	214345	she	5005	” “
214352	214353	214345	214345	she	5005	” “
214358	214362	214345	214345	she	5005	” said Charley , “
214367	214442	214345	214345	she	5005	” And Charley , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again , and looked as serious as became my maid . I was never tired of seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity , standing before me with her youthful face and figure , and her steady manner , and her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way . “
214452	214466	214448	214448	her	5005	” said I. My little maid 's countenance fell , as she replied , “
214475	214545	214448	214448	her	5005	” For Charley wore her black frock yet . I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but Charley said No . It was some one else . Some one in her cottage who had tramped down to Saint Alban 's , and was tramping he did n't know where . A poor boy , Charley said . No father , no mother , no any one . “
214564	214575	214556	214556	Emma	512	” said Charley , her round eyes filling with tears . “
214586	214587	214588	214588	She	512	” “
214593	214597	214588	214588	She	512	” returned Charley , “
214609	214648	214600	214600	he	572	” My little maid 's face was so eager , and her quiet hands were folded so closely in one another as she stood looking at me , that I had no great difficulty in reading her thoughts . “
214653	214657	214651	214651	Charley	372	” said I , “
214684	215308	215309	215309	I	0	” The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil , and , having dressed me , quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman , sufficiently expressed her readiness . So Charley and I , without saying anything to any one , went out . It was a cold , wild night , and the trees shuddered in the wind . The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little intermission for many days . None was falling just then , however . The sky had partly cleared , but was very gloomy — even above us , where a few stars were shining . In the north and north - west , where the sun had set three hours before , there was a pale dead light both beautiful and awful ; and into it long sullen lines of cloud waved up , like a sea stricken immoveable as it was heaving . Towards London , a lurid glare overhung the whole dark waste ; and the contrast between these two lights , and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an unearthly fire , gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city , and on all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants , was as solemn as might be . I had no thought , that night — none , I am quite sure — of what was soon to happen to me . But I have always remembered since , that when we had stopped at the garden gate to look up at the sky , and when we went upon our way , I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself as being something different from what I then was . I know it was then , and there , that I had it . I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time , and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill . It was Saturday night ; and most of the people belonging to the place where we were going , were drinking elsewhere . We found it quieter than I had previously seen it , though quite as miserable . The kilns were burning , and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale blue glare . We came to the cottage , where there was a feeble candle in the patched window . We tapped at the door , and went in . The mother of the little child who had died , was sitting in a chair on one side of the poor fire by the bed ; and opposite to her , a wretched boy , supported by the chimney - piece , was cowering on the floor . He held under his arm , like a little bundle , a fragment of a fur cap ; and as he tried to warm himself , he shook until the crazy door and window shook . The place was closer than before , and had an unhealthy , and a very peculiar smell . I had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman , which was at the moment of our going in . The boy staggered up instantly , and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror . His action was so quick , and my being the cause of it was so evident , that I stood still , instead of advancing nearer . “
215320	215325	215309	215309	I	0	” muttered the boy ; “
215338	215358	215334	215334	I	0	” I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman . She said to me in a low voice , “
215375	215381	215366	215366	He	0	” and said to him , “
215391	215392	215382	215382	Jo	440	” “
215401	215406	215396	215396	she	5019	” cried the boy . “
215409	215410	215411	215412	The lady	1219	” “
215456	215476	215477	215477	He	0	” His shivering came on again , and as he leaned against the wall , he shook the hovel . “
215493	215499	215477	215477	He	0	” said Jenny , softly . “
215513	215514	215511	215511	Jo	440	” “
215518	215537	215538	215538	She	5019	” returned the boy doubtfully , and surveying me with his arm held out above his burning eyes . “
215569	215636	215561	215561	she	5019	” My little Charley , with her premature experience of illness and trouble , had pulled off her bonnet and shawl , and now went quietly up to him with a chair , and sat him down in it , like an old sick nurse . Except that no such attendant could have shown him Charley 's youthful face , which seemed to engage his confidence . “
215640	215645	215646	215646	You	5027	” said the boy . “
215658	215681	215652	215653	the lady	1219	” Charley shook her head , as she methodically drew his rags about him and made him as warm as she could . “
215684	215689	215691	215691	I	0	” the boy muttered . “
215698	215699	215694	215694	she	1219	” “
215712	215715	215700	215700	I	0	” said I. “
215723	215724	215721	215721	you	0	” “
215731	215745	215727	215728	a being	12317	” returned the boy hoarsely , with his haggard gaze wandering about me , “
215801	215808	215809	215809	I	0	“ When did he come here ? ”
215814	215845	215809	215809	I	0	“ This morning , ma'am , I found him at the corner of the town . I had known him up in London yonder . Had n't I , Jo ? ”
215846	215854	215855	215856	the boy	9518	“ Tom - all - Alone 's , ”
215900	215908	215909	215909	I	0	“ When did he come from London ? ”
215912	215919	215923	215923	himself	9518	“ I come from London yes'day , ”
215930	215937	215923	215923	himself	9518	“ I 'm a going somewheres . ”
215938	215944	215945	215945	I	0	“ Where is he going ? ”
215948	215951	215953	215954	the boy	9518	“ Somewheres , ”
215961	216099	216100	216100	He	5035	“ I have been moved on , and moved on , more nor ever I was afore , since the t'other one giv ' me the sov'ring . Mrs. Sangsby , she 's always a watching , and a driving of me — what have I done to her?—and they 're all a watching and a driving of me . Everyone of 'em 's doing of it , from the time when I do n't get up , to the time when I do n't go to bed . And I 'm a going somewheres . That 's where I 'm a going . She told me , down in Tom - all - Alone 's , as she come from Stolbuns , and so I took the Stolbuns Road . It 's as good as another . ”
216107	216116	216118	216118	I	0	“ What is to be done with him ? ”
216125	216148	216118	216118	I	0	“ He could not travel in this state , even if he had a purpose , and knew where he was going ! ”
216149	216161	216162	216162	she	9769	“ I know no more , ma'am , than the dead , ”
216170	216281	216162	216162	she	9769	“ Perhaps the dead know better , if they could only tell us . I 've kept him here all day for pity 's sake , and I 've given him broth and physic , and Liz has gone to try if any one will take him in ( here 's my pretty in the bed — her child , but I call it mine ) ; but I ca n't keep him long , for if my husband was to come home and find him here , he 'd be rough in putting him out , and might do him a hurt . Hark ! Here comes Liz back ! ”
216497	216531	216480	216480	she	12117	“ Jenny , your master 's on the road home , and mine 's not far behind , and the Lord help the boy , for we can do no more for him ! ”
216568	216577	216579	216580	its mother	5050	“ Give me the child , my dear ! ”
216584	216637	216638	216638	She	5050	“ and thank you kindly too ! Jenny , woman dear , good night ! Young lady , if my master do n't fall out with me , I 'll look down by the kiln by and by , where the boy will be most like , and again in the morning ! ”
216863	216871	216872	216872	he	440	“ I do n't want no shelter , ”
216875	216884	216872	216872	he	440	“ I can lay amongst the warm bricks . ”
216885	216896	216898	216898	Charley	372	“ But do n't you know that people die there ? ”
216900	216905	216907	216908	the boy	9518	“ They dies everywheres , ”
216910	216952	216954	216954	he	9518	“ They dies in their lodgings — she knows where ; I showed her — and they dies down in Tom - all - Alone 's in heaps . They dies more than they lives , according to what I see . ”
216959	216981	216954	216954	he	9518	“ If she ai n't the t'other one , she ai n't the forrenner . Is there three of 'em then ? ”
217233	217240	217242	217243	my guardian	9683	“ This is a sorrowful case , ”
217262	217270	217242	217243	my guardian	9683	“ What do you say , Leonard ? ”
217271	217279	217281	217282	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You had better turn him out , ”
217284	217290	217292	217293	my guardian	9683	“ What do you mean ? ”
217298	217303	217305	217306	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
217308	217372	217305	217306	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ you know what I am : I am a child . Be cross to me , if I deserve it . But I have a constitutional objection to this sort of thing . I always had , when I was a medical man . He 's not safe , you know . There 's a very bad sort of fever about him . ”
217406	217414	217416	217417	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You 'll say it 's childish , ”
217424	217518	217416	217417	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Well , I dare say it may be ; but I am a child , and I never pretend to be anything else . If you put him out in the road , you only put him where he was before . He will be no worse off than he was , you know . Even make him better off , if you like . Give him sixpence , or five shillings , or five pound ten — you are arithmeticians , and I am not — and get rid of him ! ”
217519	217528	217530	217531	my guardian	9683	“ And what is he to do then ? ”
217533	217538	217540	217541	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Upon my life , ”
217551	217575	217540	217541	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ I have not the least idea what he is to do then . But I have no doubt he 'll do it . ”
217576	217586	217588	217589	my guardian	9683	“ Now , is it not a horrible reflection , ”
217605	217613	217588	217589	my guardian	9683	“ is it not a horrible reflection , ”
217623	217660	217588	217589	my guardian	9683	“ that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner , his hospital would be wide open to him , and he would be as well taken care of as any sick boy in the kingdom ? ”
217661	217666	217668	217669	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
217671	217706	217668	217669	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ you 'll pardon the simplicity of the question , coming as it does from a creature who is perfectly simple in worldly matters — but , why is n't he a prisoner then ? ”
217726	217743	217745	217746	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy , I should imagine , ”
217752	217808	217745	217746	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ It seems to me that it would be wiser , as well as in a certain kind of way more respectable , if he showed some misdirected energy that got him into prison . There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . ”
217809	217813	217819	217819	his	9683	“ I believe , ”
217823	217836	217819	217819	his	9683	“ that there is not such another child on earth as yourself . ”
217837	217842	217844	217845	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Do you really ? ”
217847	218079	217844	217845	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ I dare say ! But , I confess I do n't see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to invest himself with such poetry as is open to him . He is no doubt born with an appetite — probably , when he is in a safer state of health , he has an excellent appetite . Very well . At our young friend 's natural dinner - hour , most likely about noon , our young friend says in effect to society , ‘ I am hungry ; will you have the goodness to produce your spoon , and feed me ? ’ Society , which has taken upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons , and professes to have a spoon for our young friend , does not produce that spoon ; and our young friend , therefore , says ‘ You really must excuse me if I seize it . ’ Now , this appears to me a case of misdirected energy , which has a certain amount of reason in it , and a certain amount of romance ; and I do n't know but what I should be more interested in our young friend , as an illustration of such a case , than merely as a poor vagabond — which any one can be . ”
218080	218085	218166	218167	my guardian	9683	“ In the meantime , ”
218091	218097	218086	218086	I	0	“ he is getting worse . ”
218098	218103	218105	218106	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ In the meantime , ”
218109	218140	218105	218106	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ as Miss Summerson , with her practical good sense , observes , he is getting worse . Therefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still worse . ”
218157	218164	218166	218167	my guardian	9683	“ Of course , little woman , ”
218173	218267	218166	218167	my guardian	9683	“ I can ensure his admission into the proper place by merely going there to enforce it , though it 's a bad state of things when , in his condition , that is necessary . But it 's growing late , and is a very bad night , and the boy is worn out already . There is a bed in the wholesome loft - room by the stable ; we had better keep him there till morning , when he can be wrapped up and removed . We 'll do that . ”
218268	218271	218273	218274	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ O ! ”
218291	218301	218277	218277	his	358	“ Are you going back to our young friend ? ”
218302	218305	218307	218308	my guardian	9683	“ Yes , ”
218310	218320	218307	218308	my guardian	9683	“ How I envy you your constitution , Jarndyee ! ”
218329	218376	218322	218323	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You do n't mind these things , neither does Miss Summerson . You are ready at all times to go anywhere , and do anything . Such is Will ! I have no Will at all — and no Wo n't — simply Ca n't . ”
218377	218390	218398	218398	his	9683	“ You ca n't recommend anything for the boy , I suppose ? ”
218420	218515	218409	218409	he	9683	“ My dear Jarndyce , I observed a bottle of cooling medicine in his pocket , and it 's impossible for him to do better than take it . You can tell them to sprinkle a little vinegar about the place where he sleeps , and to keep it moderately cool , and him moderately warm . But it is mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation . Miss Summerson has such a knowledge of detail , and such a capacity for the administration of detail , that she knows all about it . ”

221080	221094	221056	221056	I	0	“ Strong enough to be told a secret , I think , Charley ? ”
221095	221104	221106	221106	Charley	372	“ Quite strong enough for that , miss ! ”
221146	221160	221130	221130	she	5186	“ O miss , it 's my doing ! It 's my doing ! ”
221176	221181	221183	221183	I	0	“ Now , Charley , ”
221195	221240	221183	221183	I	0	“ if I am to be ill , my great trust , humanly speaking , is in you . And unless you are as quiet and composed for me , as you always were for yourself , you can never fulfil it , Charley . ”
221241	221254	221256	221256	Charley	372	“ If you 'll let me cry a little longer , miss , ”
221258	221279	221256	221256	Charley	372	“ O my dear , my dear ! if you 'll only let me cry a little longer , O my dear!”—how
221300	221304	221283	221283	she	5187	tears—“I'll be good . ”
221321	221334	221336	221336	Charley	372	“ Trust in me , now , if you please , miss , ”
221340	221349	221336	221336	Charley	372	“ I am listening to everything you say . ”
221350	221386	221396	221396	her	5189	“ It is very little at present , Charley . I shall tell your doctor to - night that I do n't think I am well , and that you are going to nurse me . ”
221400	221475	221476	221476	Charley	372	“ And in the morning , when you hear Miss Ada in the garden , if I should not be quite able to go to the window - curtain as usual , do you go , Charley , and say I am asleep — that I have rather tired myself , and am asleep . At all times keep the room as I have kept it , Charley , and let no one come . ”
221612	221624	221608	221608	her	1317	“ Do n't disturb her , Charley , for the world ! ”
221625	221635	221636	221636	I	0	“ How does my own Pride look , Charley ? ”
221639	221644	221646	221646	Charley	372	“ Disappointed , miss , ”
221653	221664	221646	221646	Charley	372	“ But I know she is very beautiful this morning . ”
221665	221672	221674	221674	Charley	372	“ She is indeed , miss , ”
221678	221686	221688	221688	her	1317	“ Still looking up at the window . ”
221717	221783	221704	221704	I	0	“ Now , Charley , when she knows I am ill , she will try to make her way into the room . Keep her out , Charley , if you love me truly , to the last ! Charley , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . ”
221784	221793	221794	221794	she	1317	“ I never will ! I never will ! ”
221798	221839	221794	221794	she	1317	“ I believe it , my dear Charley . And now come and sit beside me for a little while , and touch me with your hand . For I can not see you , Charley ; I am blind . ”
222183	222188	222179	222180	Mr. Krook	343	“ continual in liquor , ”
222387	222394	222396	222397	Mrs. Perkins	427	“ Sooner than which , myself , ”
222399	222409	222396	222397	Mrs. Perkins	427	“ I would get my living by selling lucifers . ”
222939	222945	222947	222948	the stationer	10042	“ What , Mr. Weevle ? ”
222954	222959	222947	222948	the stationer	10042	“ Are you there ? ”
222960	222963	222965	222965	Weevle	552	“ Ay ! ”
222967	222975	222965	222965	Weevle	552	“ Here I am , Mr. Snagsby . ”
222976	222991	222992	222993	the stationer	10042	“ Airing yourself , as I am doing , before you go to bed ? ”
222996	223019	223020	223020	Weevle	552	“ Why , there 's not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very freshening , ”
223030	223041	223043	223044	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ Very true , sir . Do n't you observe , ”
223056	223087	223043	223044	Mr. Snagsby	409	“ do n't you observe , Mr. Weevle , that you're — not to put too fine a point upon it — that you 're rather greasy here , sir ? ”
223088	223110	223111	223112	Mr. Weevle	552	“ Why , I have noticed myself that there is a queer kind of flavor in the place to - night , ”
223115	223127	223111	223112	Mr. Weevle	552	“ I suppose it 's chops at the Sol 's Arms . ”
223128	223135	223111	223112	Mr. Weevle	552	“ Chops , do you think ? ”
223140	223148	223111	223112	Mr. Weevle	552	” Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again . “
223187	223203	223182	223182	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again , and then spits and wipes his mouth ; “
223232	223233	223182	223182	I	0	” “
223247	223248	223275	223275	George	562	” “
223257	223262	223264	223264	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby ; “
223272	223273	223264	223264	I	0	” “
223285	223290	223277	223277	I	0	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
223317	223347	223296	223296	you	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , looking in past the other 's shoulder along the dark passage , and then falling back a step to look up at the house . “
223422	223423	223424	223424	I	0	” “
223431	223435	223424	223424	I	0	” returns Tony . “
223444	223459	223472	223472	he	343	” pursues Mr. Snagsby , coughing his cough of mild persuasion behind his hand . “
223479	223480	223483	223483	he	343	” “
223486	223490	223481	223481	I	0	” says Tony . “
223496	223497	223492	223492	I	0	” “
223509	223514	223505	223505	you	9019	” returns the stationer . “
223543	223553	223555	223555	I	0	” adds Mr. Snagsby , with his apologetic cough , “
223570	223620	223555	223555	I	0	” Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court , and then looks at the stationer . Mr. Snagsby , blankly catching his eye , looks upward for a star or so , and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his way out of this conversation . “
223629	223638	223555	223555	I	0	” he observes , slowly rubbing his hands , “
223645	223646	223649	223649	he	5262	” “
223651	223656	223649	223649	he	5262	” interrupts Mr. Weevle . “
223663	223686	223657	223658	The deceased	10147	” says Mr. Snagsby , twitching his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase , and tapping his acquaintance on the button . “
223692	223709	223687	223687	Ah	5264	” returns the other , as if he were not over - fond of the subject . “
223718	223719	223710	223710	I	0	” “
223784	223808	223810	223810	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , breaking off with a mistrust that he may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorshop in Mr. Weevle , “
223833	223849	223831	223831	sir	9019	” adds Mr. Snagsby , with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter . “
223860	223873	223857	223857	you	9019	” answers Weevle , once more glancing up and down the court . “
223884	223889	223857	223857	you	9019	” suggests the stationer . “
223893	223894	223857	223857	you	9019	” “
223898	223908	223857	223857	you	9019	” observes the stationer , with his confirmatory cough . “
223934	223965	223927	223927	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go , though he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since he stopped to speak ; “
223982	224059	223980	223980	sir	9019	” If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his little woman the trouble of looking for him , he might set his mind at rest on that score . His little woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol 's Arms all this time , and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over her head ; honoring Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a very searching glance as she goes past . “
224072	224079	224060	224060	You	5280	” says Mr. Weevle to himself ; “
224109	224175	224104	224105	this fellow	2171	” This fellow approaches as he speaks . Mr. Weevle softly holds up his finger , and draws him into the passage , and closes the street door . Then , they go up stairs ; Mr. Weevle heavily , and Mr. Guppy ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed . When they are shut into the back room , they speak low . “
224191	224195	224178	224178	you	5280	” says Tony . “
224203	224204	224198	224198	I	0	” “
224210	224214	224205	224205	You	0	” Tony repeats . “
224253	224254	224243	224243	I	0	” “
224261	224262	224243	224243	I	0	” “
224267	224271	224243	224243	I	0	” says Tony . “
224315	224341	224373	224373	you	0	” says Tony , pointing to the heavily - burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding - sheet . “
224346	224359	224373	224373	you	0	” Mr. Guppy observes , as he takes the snuffers in hand . “
224363	224368	224373	224373	you	0	” returns his friend . “
224389	224390	224376	224376	It	5285	” “
224402	224426	224427	224428	William Guppy	326	” enquires Mr. Guppy , looking at him , snuffers in hand , as he sits down with his elbow on the table . “
224430	224435	224427	224428	William Guppy	326	” replies the other , “
224461	224522	224458	224458	I	0	” Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffer - tray from him with his elbow , leans his head on his hand , puts his feet on the fender , and looks at the fire . Mr. Guppy , observing him , slightly tosses his head , and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude . “
224533	224534	224526	224526	Snagsby	409	” “
224546	224558	224544	224544	Snagsby	409	” says Mr. Weevle , altering the construction of his sentence . “
224562	224563	224544	224544	Snagsby	409	” “
224580	224581	224569	224569	He	409	” “
224588	224593	224586	224586	Snagsby	409	” says Mr. Guppy , “
224614	224615	224607	224607	I	0	” “
224624	224634	224621	224622	William G.	635	” cries Tony , looking up for an instant . “
224661	224769	224607	224607	I	0	” Mr. Guppy affects to smile ; and with the view of changing the conversation , looks with an admiration , real or pretended , round the room at the Galaxy gallery of British beauty ; terminating his survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantel - shelf , in which she is represented on a terrace , with a pedestal upon the terrace , and a vase upon the pedestal , and her shawl upon the vase , and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl , and her arm on the prodigious piece of fur , and a bracelet on her arm . “
224777	224782	224607	224607	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
224789	224790	224791	224791	I	0	” “
224796	224805	224791	224791	I	0	” growls Tony , without changing his position . “
224816	224853	224854	224854	Tony	552	” Finding , by this time , that his friend is not to be wheedled into a more sociable humor , Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill - used tack , and remonstrates with him . “
224856	224860	224854	224854	Tony	552	” says he , “
224956	224957	224940	224940	I	0	” “
224966	224971	224963	224964	William Guppy	326	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
224978	224984	224972	224972	Sir	9019	” retorts Mr. William Guppy , “
224994	225039	224986	224986	I	0	” Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong , and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it . Mr. William Guppy , however , having got the advantage , can not quite release it without a little more injured remonstrance . “
225047	225052	225053	225053	you	552	” says that gentleman , “
225187	225203	225204	225205	William Guppy	326	” Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued , saying emphatically , “
225210	225219	225204	225205	William Guppy	326	” Mr. Guppy acquiesces , with the reply , “
225235	225236	225228	225228	Tony	552	” “
225240	225248	225228	225228	Tony	552	” says Tony , stirring the fire , “
225279	225280	225263	225263	Krook	343	” “
225290	225291	225285	225285	he	326	” “
225344	225345	225336	225336	He	326	” “
225356	225357	225346	225346	He	326	” “
225503	225504	225486	225486	He	326	” “
225514	225515	225506	225506	you	0	” “
225536	225537	225538	225538	Tony	552	” “
225540	225554	225555	225555	he	326	” says Mr. Guppy , after considering a little with his legs crossed , “
225564	225565	225562	225562	he	326	” “
225627	225628	225629	225629	Tony	552	” “
225631	225642	225629	225629	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs ; “
225655	225656	225647	225647	he	326	” “
225709	225710	225711	225711	Tony	552	” “
225713	225725	225727	225727	you	552	” says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs again ; “
225742	225743	225744	225745	A woman	977	” “
225773	225830	225833	225833	Tony	552	” Mr. Guppy has been biting his thumb - nail during this dialogue , generally changing the thumb when he has changed the crossed leg . As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat - sleeve . It takes his attention . He stares at it , aghast . “
225855	225856	225833	225833	Tony	552	” “
225861	225862	225833	225833	Tony	552	” “
225865	225870	225833	225833	Tony	552	” returns Mr. Guppy . “
225909	225973	226020	226020	he	5305	” They look at one another , and Tony goes listening to the door , and a little way up stairs , and a little way down stairs . Comes back , and says it 's all right , and all quiet : and quotes the remark he lately made to Mr. Snagsby , about their cooking chops at the Sol 's Arms . “
225979	226018	226020	226020	he	5305	” resumes Mr. Guppy , still glancing with remarkable aversion at his coat - sleeve , as they pursue their conversation before the fire , leaning on opposite sides of the table with their heads very near together , “
226037	226038	226020	226020	he	5305	” “
226046	226055	226044	226044	sir	9019	” answers Tony , faintly adjusting his whiskers . “
226094	226149	226150	226150	You	5310	” The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed by Mr. Weevle , sits so ill upon him to - night , that he abandons that and his whiskers together ; and , after looking over his shoulder , appears to yield himself up , a prey to the horrors again . “
226189	226201	226202	226202	You	5310	” asks Mr. Guppy , anxiously biting his thumb - nail . “
226219	226220	226221	226221	I	0	” “
226228	226229	226230	226230	You	552	” “
226237	226261	226262	226262	I	0	” says Tony once more . Mr. Guppy nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper . “
226311	226312	226304	226304	you	552	” “
226344	226348	226315	226315	he	9488	” suggests Tony . “
226405	226406	226407	226407	Ye	5315	” “
226411	226419	226407	226407	Ye	5315	” is Mr. Weevle 's reluctant admission . “
226424	226429	226422	226422	Tony	552	” remonstrates his friend , “
226448	226449	226441	226441	You	552	” “
226462	226469	226460	226460	William	326	” returns the other , gravely . “
226476	226497	226473	226473	you	552	” urges Mr. Guppy , raising his voice a little ; but on his friend 's once more warning him , “
226509	226528	226502	226502	you	552	” he repeats his question without any sound at all ; forming with his lips only the words , “
226534	226535	226531	226531	you	552	” “
226558	226559	226553	226556	a pair of conspirators	5317	” “
226562	226567	226553	226556	a pair of conspirators	5317	” says Mr. Guppy , “
226610	226611	226553	226556	a pair of conspirators	5317	” “
226632	226654	226655	226655	Tony	552	” Mr. Guppy casts up his eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantel - shelf , and replies , “
226711	226712	226704	226705	no fool	5321	” “
226740	226884	226887	226887	Tony	552	” Both sit silent , listening to the metal voices , near and distant , resounding from towers of various heights , in tones more various than their situations . When these at length cease , all seems more mysterious and quiet than before . One disagreeable result of whispering is , that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound — strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet , that would leave no mark on the sea - sand or the winter snow . So sensitive the two friends happen to be , that the air is full of these phantoms ; and the two look over their shoulders by one consent , to see that the door is shut . “
226889	226908	226887	226887	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , drawing nearer to the fire , and biting his unsteady thumb - nail . “
226917	226918	226909	226909	You	552	” “
226949	226950	226942	226942	you	552	” “
226961	226962	226959	226959	Tony	552	” “
226986	226987	226977	226977	yourself	552	” “
226995	227004	226993	226993	Tony	552	” proceeds Mr. Guppy , evading this proposal , “
227014	227015	227008	227009	dead men	5327	” “
227038	227103	227033	227033	they	5327	” Tony answers . The two look at each other again . Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service ; that he hopes so . There is an oppressive blank , until Mr. Weevle , by stirring the fire suddenly , makes Mr. Guppy start as if his heart had been stirred instead . “
227116	227120	227033	227033	they	5327	” says he . “
227141	227245	227250	227250	Tony	552	” He raises the sash , and they both rest on the window - sill , half in and half out of the room . The neighboring houses are too near , to admit of their seeing any sky without craning their necks and looking up ; but lights in frowsy windows here and there , and the rolling of distant carriages , and the new expression that there is of the stir of men , they find to be comfortable . Mr. Guppy , noiselessly tapping on the window - sill , resumes his whispering in quite a light - comedy tone . “
227258	227266	227255	227256	old Smallweed	539	” meaning the Younger of that name . “
227294	227295	227296	227296	I	0	” “
227299	227303	227296	227296	I	0	” says Tony . “
227311	227312	227304	227304	I	0	” “
227318	227323	227304	227304	I	0	” resumes Mr. Guppy . “
227355	227361	227342	227342	he	343	” Tony shakes his head . “
227506	227507	227502	227502	he	343	” “
227524	227539	227540	227540	He	343	” Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut , after a little forensic meditation . “
227583	227584	227540	227540	He	343	” “
227635	227686	227690	227691	the Devil	9300	” returns Mr. Weevle . Mr. Guppy sitting on the window - sill , nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and clasp it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away . “
227695	227699	227690	227691	the Devil	9300	” he says , “
227708	227751	227754	227754	you	0	” A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight , and more offensive to the smell . A stagnant , sickening oil , with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder . “
227768	227769	227770	227770	I	0	” “
227789	227840	227778	227778	I	0	” cries the lodger . And yet look here — and look here ! When he brings the candle , here , from the corner of the window - sill , it slowly drips and creeps away down the bricks ; here , lies in a little thick nauseous pool . “
227847	227857	227778	227778	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , shutting down the window . “
227871	227950	227864	227864	I	0	” He so washes , and rubs , and scrubs , and smells , and washes , that he has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy , and stood silently before the fire , when Saint Paul 's bell strikes twelve , and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air , and in their many tones . When all is quiet again , the lodger says : “
227963	227972	227960	227960	I	0	” Mr. Guppy nods , and gives him a “
227975	228037	228039	228039	you	0	” on the back ; but not with the washed hand , though it is his right hand . He goes down - stairs ; and Mr. Guppy tries to compose himself , before the fire , for waiting a long time . But in no more than a minute or two the stairs creak , and Tony comes swiftly back . “
228043	228044	228039	228039	you	0	” “
228057	228087	228050	228052	The old man	1258	” He has been so horribly frightened in the short interval , that his terror seizes the other , who makes a rush at him , and asks loudly , “
228093	228094	228095	228095	I	0	” “
228135	228265	228132	228132	he	1258	there!”—Tony ends this with a groan . Mr. Guppy takes the light . They go down , more dead than alive , and holding one another , push open the door of the back shop . The cat has retreated close to it , and stands snarling — not at them ; at something on the ground , before the fire . There is very little fire left in the grate , but there is a smouldering suffocating vapor in the room , and a dark greasy coating on the walls and ceiling . The chairs and table , and the bottle so rarely absent from the table , all stand as usual . On one chair - back , hang the old man 's hairy cap and coat . “
228268	228286	228287	228287	I	0	” whispers the lodger , pointing his friend 's attention to these objects with a trembling finger . “
228369	228381	228431	228431	he	1258	” Is he hanging somewhere ? They look up . No . “
228384	228388	228431	228431	he	1258	” whispers Tony . “
228448	228449	228443	228443	I	0	” “
228458	228463	228443	228443	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
228468	228469	228466	228466	her	5348	” “
228484	229198	229200	229200	he	5350	” They advance slowly , looking at all these things . The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground , before the fire and between the two chairs . What is it ? Hold up the light ? Here is a small burnt patch of flooring ; here is the tinder from a little bundle of burnt paper , but not so light as usual , seeming to be steeped in something ; and here is — is it the cinder of a small charred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes , or is it coal ? O Horror , he IS here ! and this , from which we run away , striking out the light and overturning one another into the street , is all that represents him . Help , help , help ! come into this house for Heaven 's sake ! Plenty will come in , but none can help . The Lord Chancellor of that Court , true to his title in his last act , has died the death of all Lord Chancellors in all Courts , and of all authorities in all places under all names soever , where false pretences are made , and where injustice is done . Call the death by any name Your Highness will , attribute it to whom you will , or say it might have been prevented how you will , it is the same death eternally — inborn , inbred , engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself , and that only — Spontaneous Combustion , and none other of all the deaths that can be died . Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last Coroner 's Inquest at the Sol 's Arms , reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness ( being , in fact , breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle ) , and institute perquisitions through the court , and dive into the Sol 's parlour , and write with ravenous little pens on tissue - paper . Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery . Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be remembered , that some time back a painful sensation was created in the public mind , by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the first floor of the house occupied as a rag , bottle , and general marine store - shop , by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits , far advanced in life , named Krook ; and how , by a remarkable coincidence , Krook was examined at the inquest , which it may be recollected was held on that occasion at the Sol 's Arms , a well - conducted tavern , immediately adjoining the premises in question , on the west side , and licensed to a highly respectable landlord , Mr. James George Bogsby . Now do they show ( in as many words as possible ) , how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was observed by the inhabitants of the court , in which the tragical occurrence which forms the subject of that present account transpired ; and which odour was at one time so powerful , that Mr. Swills , a comic vocalist , professionally engaged by Mr. J.G. Bogsby , has himself stated to our reporter that he mentioned to Miss M. Melvilleson , a lady of some pretensions to musical ability , likewise engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called Harmonic Assemblies or Meetings , which it would appear are held at the Sol 's Arms , under Mr. Bogsby 's direction , pursuant to the Act of George the Second , that he ( Mr. Swills ) found his voice seriously affected by the impure state of the atmosphere ; his jocose expression , at the time , being , “
229219	229505	229210	229210	he	5350	” How this account of Mr. Swills is entirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in the same court , and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins ; both of whom observed the fœtid effluvia , and regarded them as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook , the unfortunate deceased . All this and a great deal more , the two gentlemen , who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy catastrophe , write down on the spot ; and the boy population of the court ( out of bed in a moment ) swarm up the shutters of the Sol 's Arm 's parlor , to behold the tops of their heads while they are about it . The whole court , adult as well as boy , is sleepless for that night , and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads , and talk of the ill - fated house , and look at it . Miss Flite has been bravely rescued from her chamber , as if it were in flames , and accommodated with a bed at the Sol 's Arms . The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts its door , all night ; for any kind of public excitement makes good for the Sol , and causes the court to stand in need of comfort . The house has not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves , or in brandy and water warm , since the Inquest . The moment the potboy heard what had happened , he rolled up his shirt - sleeves tight to his shoulders , and said , “
229514	229666	229210	229210	he	5350	” In the first outcry , Young Piper dashed off for the fire - engines ; and returned in triumph at a jolting gallop , perched up aloft on the Phœnix , and holding on to that fabulous creature with all his might , in the midst of helmets and torches . One helmet remains behind , after careful investigation of all chinks and crannies ; and slowly paces up and down before the house , in company with one of the two policemen who have been likewise left in charge thereof . To this trio , everybody in the court , possessed of sixpence , has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid form . Mr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol , and are worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains , if they will only stay there . “
229673	229678	229210	229210	he	5350	” says Mr. Bogsby , “
229684	229697	229699	229699	your	5353	” though he looks something sharply after it , over the counter ; “
229718	230062	229712	229712	you	5353	” Thus entreated , the two gentlemen ( Mr. Weevle especially ) put names to so many things , that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly ; though they still relate , to all new comers , some version of the night they have had of it , and of what they said , and what they thought , and what they saw . Meanwhile , one or other of the policemen often flits about the door , and pushing it open a little way at the full length of his arm , looks in from outer gloom . Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to , in there . Thus , night pursues its leaden course ; finding the court still out of bed through the unwonted hours , still treating and being treated , still conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little money left it unexpectedly . Thus , night at length with slow - retreating steps departs , and the lamplighter going his rounds , like an executioner to a despotic king , strikes off the little heads of fire that have aspired to lessen the darkness . Thus , the day cometh , whether or no . And the day may discern , even with its dim London eye , that the court has been up all night . Over and above the faces that have fallen drowsily on tables , and the heels that lie prone on hard floors instead of beds , the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court itself looks worn and jaded . And now the neighbourhood waking up , and beginning to hear of what has happened , comes streaming in , half - dressed , to ask questions ; and the two policemen and the helmet ( who are far less impressible externally than the court ) have enough to do to keep the door . “
230068	230076	229712	229712	you	5353	” says Mr. Snagsby , coming up . “
230083	230084	230080	230080	I	0	” “
230091	230098	230080	230080	I	0	” returns one of the policemen . “
230112	230113	230119	230119	gentlemen	9023	” “
230121	230131	230119	230119	gentlemen	9023	” says Mr. Snagsby , somewhat promptly backed away , “
230155	230156	230148	230153	the young man who lodges here	5357	” “
230159	230164	230148	230153	the young man who lodges here	5357	” returns the policeman . “
230184	230185	230182	230182	you	9023	” “
230192	230197	230182	230182	you	9023	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
230208	230261	230263	230264	Mr. Guppy	326	” Mr. Snagsby , wholly unable to answer this , or any other question , in his troubled mind , repairs to the Sol 's Arms , and finds Mr. Weevle languishing over tea and toast ; with a considerable expression on him of exhausted excitement , and exhausted tobacco - smoke . “
230267	230272	230263	230264	Mr. Guppy	326	” quoth Mr. Snagsby . “
230292	230307	230308	230310	my little woman	2329	” Mr. Snagsby 's power of speech deserts him in the formation of the words “
230312	230355	230308	230310	my little woman	2329	” For , to see that injured female walk into the Sol 's Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the beer - engine , with her eyes fixed upon him like an accusing spirit , strikes him dumb . “
230359	230370	230372	230372	you	9060	” says Mr. Snagsby , when his tongue is loosened , “
230393	230394	230372	230372	you	9060	” “
230397	230402	230372	230372	you	9060	” says Mrs. Snagsby . “
230412	230413	230406	230406	you	9060	” “
230416	230465	230406	230406	you	9060	” says Mrs. Snagsby ; and in a rigid manner acknowledges their presence , still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her eye . The devoted Mr. Snagsby can not bear this treatment . He takes Mrs. Snagsby by the hand , and leads her aside to an adjacent cask . “
230486	230487	230488	230488	I	0	” “
230495	230500	230488	230488	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby , “
230509	230519	230520	230520	you	2329	” Mr. Snagsby , with his cough of meekness , rejoins,—“Wouldn't
230526	230540	230520	230520	you	2329	” and meditates . Then coughs his cough of trouble , and says , “
230550	230560	230547	230548	my love	9128	” still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby 's eye . “
230564	230573	230547	230548	my love	9128	” returns Mrs. Snagsby , shaking her head , “
230578	230579	230547	230548	my love	9128	” “
230584	230594	230547	230548	my love	9128	” urges Mr. Snagsby , in a piteous manner , “
230649	230650	230651	230651	I	0	” “
230656	230672	230651	230651	I	0	” returns Mrs. Snagsby . On a hasty review of his unfortunate position , Mr. Snagsby “
230677	230752	230651	230651	I	0	” either . He is not prepared positively to deny that he may have had something to do with it . He has had something — he do n't know what — to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious , that it is possible he may even be implicated , without knowing it , in the present transaction . He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief , and gasps . “
230756	230762	230764	230764	you	2329	” says the unhappy stationer , “
230791	230792	230782	230782	you	2329	” “
230799	230804	230795	230795	you	2329	” inquires Mrs. Snagsby . “
230830	230842	230843	230843	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby has made a pause to suppress a groan . “
230860	230861	230865	230865	you	2329	” “
230877	230878	230868	230868	You	2329	” “
230885	230886	230868	230868	You	2329	” “
230892	230909	230887	230887	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby , after contemplating his increased confusion with a severe and sinister smile , “
230933	230934	230935	230936	My love	9128	” “
230958	231125	230952	230952	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby casts his eyes forlornly round the bar , gives Messrs. Weevle and Guppy good morning , assures them of the satisfaction with which he sees them uninjured , and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the Sol 's Arms . Before night , his doubt whether he may not be responsible for some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of the whole neighbourhood , is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs. Snagsby 's pertinacity in that fixed gaze . His mental sufferings are so great , that he entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up to justice , and requiring to be cleared , if innocent , and punished with the utmost rigor of the law , if guilty . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , having taken their breakfast , step into Lincoln 's Inn to take a little walk about the square , and clear as many of the dark cobwebs out of their brains as a little walk may . “
231139	231157	231137	231137	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , “
231184	231185	231188	231188	I	0	” “
231196	231209	231193	231194	William G	649	” returns the other , eyeing his companion with a bloodshot eye . “
231260	231284	231285	231285	Tony	552	” This supposititious phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy that his voice quakes , as he says in a moral way , “
231318	231325	231326	231326	William	326	” To which Mr. Weevle returns , “
231351	231358	231339	231339	you	326	” To which Mr. Guppy says , “
231363	231370	231339	231339	you	326	” To which Mr. Jobling replies , “
231376	231383	231386	231386	I	0	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
231390	231398	231401	231401	you	326	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts again , “
231404	231411	231401	231401	you	326	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
231416	231423	231424	231424	I	0	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “
231428	231435	231424	231424	I	0	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
231440	231447	231424	231424	I	0	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “
231452	231475	231476	231476	Tony	552	” And both being now in a heated state , they walk on silently for a while , to cool down again . “
231478	231485	231476	231476	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , then , “
231533	231534	231520	231520	yourself	552	” “
231541	231550	231520	231520	yourself	552	” cries Mr. Weevle , cutting him short . “
231559	231590	231553	231553	you	326	” Finding his friend in this morose and material condition , Mr. Guppy only expresses the finer feelings of his soul through the tone of injury in which he recommences : “
231682	231703	231680	231680	gentleman	5384	” ( Mr. Guppy was going to say , Mogul , but thinks gentleman better suited to the circumstances . ) “
231710	231711	231680	231680	gentleman	5384	” “
231722	231730	231731	231731	we	5381	” Mr. Guppy tells them off on his fingers.—“what
231761	231762	231757	231757	we	5381	” “
231765	231770	231757	231757	we	5381	” says Mr. Weevle . “
231777	231778	231779	231779	We	5381	” “
231878	231879	231874	231874	you	552	” “
231882	231887	231888	231888	I	0	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
231892	231893	231888	231888	I	0	” “
231903	231909	231888	231888	I	0	” says the injured Guppy . “
231912	231917	231888	231888	I	0	” returns his friend ; “
231931	231932	231926	231926	I	0	” “
231937	231953	231935	231935	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , taking his arm again , and walking him slowly on , “
231983	231984	231966	231966	you	552	” “
231990	231996	231987	231987	you	552	” says Tony , stopping . “
232015	232025	231998	231998	you	552	” repeats Mr. Guppy , walking him on again . “
232033	232049	231998	231998	you	552	” pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop . Mr. Guppy nods . “
232069	232077	232064	232064	you	552	” says Mr. Weevle , haggardly staring . “
232086	232087	232079	232079	you	552	” “
232110	232121	232107	232107	I	0	” says Mr. Weevle , with a very genuine shudder . “
232201	232215	232199	232199	you	552	” says Mr. Guppy , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation . “
232231	232238	232243	232243	yourself	552	” cries Mr. Weevle , indignantly . “
232245	232246	232243	232243	yourself	552	” “
232253	232261	232249	232249	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , soothing him . “
232283	232284	232285	232285	You	552	” “
232291	232296	232285	232285	You	552	” rejoins his friend , “
232308	232309	232311	232311	you	552	” “
232319	232324	232311	232311	you	552	” says Mr. Guppy , “
232338	232339	232340	232340	You	552	” “
232343	232353	232360	232360	your	552	” returns Tony , with a most convincing stedfastness , “
232366	232487	232363	232363	I	0	” While they are so conversing , a hackney - coach drives into the square , on the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to the public . Inside the coach , and consequently not so manifest to the multitude , though sufficiently so to the two friends , for the coach stops almost at their feet , are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs. Smallweed , accompanied by their grand - daughter Judy . An air of haste and excitement pervades the party ; and as the tall hat ( surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger ) alights , Mr. Smallweed the elder pokes his head out of window , and bawls to Mr. Guppy , “
232498	232499	232363	232363	I	0	” “
232518	232528	232529	232529	My	0	” says Mr. Guppy , nodding to his familiar . “
232533	232538	232540	232540	you	9019	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , “
232590	232601	232579	232579	you	9019	” Mr. Guppy looks at his friend , repeating inquiringly , “
232610	232625	232579	232579	you	9019	” And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the Sol 's Arms . “
232631	232651	232579	232579	you	9019	” says the Patriarch to the coachman with a fierce grin , and shaking his incapable fist at him . “
232714	232791	232792	232793	O Lord	5416	” It is well that the Sol is not far off , for Mr. Weevle presents an apoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished . With no worse aggravation of his symptoms , however , than the utterance of divers croaking sounds , expressive of obstructed respiration , he fulfils his share of the porterage , and the benevolent old gentleman is deposited by his own desire in the parlor of the Sol 's Arms . “
232795	232812	232792	232793	O Lord	5416	” gasps Mr. Smallweed , looking about him , breathless , from an arm - chair . “
232846	232880	232832	232832	you	9019	” This little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a propensity on the part of that unlucky old lady , whenever she finds herself on her feet , to amble about , and “
232882	232984	232832	232832	you	9019	” to inanimate objects , accompanying herself with a chattering noise , as in a witch dance . A nervous affection has probably as much to do with these demonstrations , as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman ; but on the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion with a Windsor arm - chair , fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is seated , that she only quite desists when her grandchildren have held her down in it : her lord in the meanwhile bestowing upon her , with great volubility , the endearing epithet of “
232991	232999	232832	232832	you	9019	” repeated a surprising number of times . “
233004	233014	232832	232832	you	9019	” Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds , addressing Mr. Guppy , “
233032	233033	233038	233038	sir	9019	” “
233045	233046	233047	233047	You	4938	” “
233062	233076	233056	233056	Bart	554	” The two discoverers stare at the Smallweeds , who return the compliment . “
233081	233092	233056	233056	Bart	554	” whines Grandfather Smallweed , putting out both his hands , “
233114	233115	233109	233110	Mrs. Smallweed	558	” “
233118	233123	233109	233110	Mrs. Smallweed	558	” says Mr. Guppy . “
233222	233240	233217	233217	I	0	” repeats Grandfather Smallweed , hooking the air towards him with all his ten fingers at once , “
233247	233248	233249	233249	I	0	” “
233254	233261	233262	233262	you	541	” says the disconsolate Mr. Guppy , “
233274	233275	233262	233262	you	541	” “
233295	233307	233286	233286	you	541	” returns that old bird , with a secretly glistening eye . “
233317	233318	233310	233310	I	0	” “
233337	233348	233328	233328	you	541	” says Judy . Also with a secretly glistening eye . “
233361	233365	233349	233349	He	1258	” observes Small ; “
233380	233381	233376	233376	I	0	” “
233396	233403	233384	233384	he	1258	” the old gentleman strikes in ; “
233527	233541	233512	233512	you	5438	” Mrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her head , and pipe up , “
233570	233571	233573	233573	somebody	1404	” “
233580	233599	233573	233573	somebody	1404	” exclaims her exasperated husband , looking helplessly about him , and finding no missile within his reach . “
233634	233689	233621	233621	You	5438	” Here Mr. Smallweed , wrought up to the highest pitch by his own eloquence , actually throws Judy at her grandmother in default of anything else , by butting that young virgin at the old lady with such force as he can muster , and then dropping into his chair in a heap . “
233703	233719	233694	233694	somebody	1404	” says the voice from within the faintly struggling bundle into which he has collapsed . “
233776	233807	233736	233739	the police on duty	5447	” As his dutiful grandchildren set him up , panting , and put him through the usual restorative process of shaking and punching , he still repeats like an echo , “
233816	234116	234121	234122	KING DEATH	381	” Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other ; the former as having relinquished the whole affair ; the latter with a discomfited countenance , as having entertained some lingering expectations yet . But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed interest . Mr. Tulkinghorn 's clerk comes down from his official pew in the chambers , to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is answerable for its being all correct about the next of kin , and that the papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due time and course . Mr. Smallweed is at once permitted so far to assert his supremacy as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next house , and upstairs into Miss Flite 's deserted room , where he looks like a hideous bird of prey newly added to her aviary . The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court , still makes good for the Sol , and keeps the court upon its mettle . Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there really is no will , and consider that a handsome present ought to be made him out of the estate . Young Piper and Young Perkins , as members of that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the foot - passengers in Chancery Lane , crumble into ashes behind the pump and under the archway , all day long ; where wild yells and hootings take place over their remains . Little Swills and Miss M. Melvilleson enter into affable conversation with their patrons , feeling that these unusual occurrences level the barriers between professionals and non - professionals . Mr. Bogsby puts up “
234134	234150	234151	234153	J. G. B.	653	” as the great Harmonic feature of the week ; and announces in the bill that “
234201	234267	234151	234153	J. G. B.	653	” There is one point connected with the deceased , upon which the court is particularly anxious ; namely that the fiction of a full - sized coffin should be preserved , though there is so little to put in it . Upon the undertaker 's stating in the Sol 's bar in the course of the day , that he has received orders to construct “
234273	234815	234151	234153	J. G. B.	653	” the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that Mr. Smallweed 's conduct does him great honour . Out of the court , and a long way out of it , there is considerable excitement too ; for men of science and philosophy come to look , and carriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same intent , and there is more learned talk about inflammable gases and phosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined . Some of these authorities ( of course the wisest ) hold with indignation that the deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner ; and being reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence for such deaths , reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical Transactions ; and also of a book not quite unknown , on English Medical Jurisprudence ; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess Cornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini , prebendary of Verona , who wrote a scholarly work or so , and was occasionally heard of in his time as having gleams of reason in him ; and also of the testimony of Messrs. Foderé and Mere , two pestilent Frenchmen who would investigate the subject ; and further , of the corroborative testimony of Monsieur Le Cat , a rather celebrated French surgeon once upon a time , who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a case occurred , and even to write an account of it;—still they regard the late Mr. Krook 's obstinacy , in going out of the world by any such byeway , as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive . The less the court understands of all this , the more the court likes it ; and the greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol 's Arms . Then , there comes the artist of a picture newspaper , with a foreground and figures ready drawn for anything , from a wreck on the Cornish coast to a review in Hyde Park , or a meeting at Manchester,—and in Mrs. Perkins 's own room , memorable evermore , he then and there throws in upon the block , Mr. Krook 's house , as large as life ; in fact , considerably larger , making a very Temple of it . Similarly , being permitted to look in at the door of the fatal chamber , he depicts that apartment as three quarters of a mile long , by fifty yards high ; at which the court is particularly charmed . All this time , the two gentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house , and assist at the philosophical disputations,—go everywhere , and listen to everybody,—and yet are always diving into the Sol 's parlour , and writing with the ravenous little pens on the tissue - paper . At last come the coroner and his inquiry , like as before , except that the coroner cherishes this case as being out of the common way , and tells the gentlemen of the Jury , in his private capacity , that “
234850	235085	234844	234844	we	5461	” After which the six - footer comes into action , and is much admired . In all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part , except when he gives his evidence , that he is moved on like a private individual , and can only haunt the secret house on the outside ; where he has the mortification of seeing Mr. Smallweed padlocking the door , and of bitterly knowing himself to be shut out . But before these proceedings draw to a close , that is to say , on the night next after the catastrophe , Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady Dedlock . For which reason , with a sinking heart , and with that hangdog sense of guilt upon him , which dread and watching , enfolded in the Sol 's Arms , have produced , the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at the town mansion at about seven o'clock in the evening , and requests to see her ladyship . Mercury replies that she is going out to dinner ; do n't he see the carriage at the door ? Yes , he does see the carriage at the door ; but he wants to see my lady too . Mercury is disposed , as he will presently declare to a fellow gentleman in waiting , “
235093	235189	234844	234844	we	5461	” but his instructions are positive . Therefore he sulkily supposes that the young man must come up into the library . There he leaves the young man in a large room , not over - light , while he makes report of him . Mr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions , discovering everywhere a certain charred and whitened little heap of coal or wood . Presently he hears a rustling . Is it — ? No , it 's no ghost ; but fair flesh and blood , most brilliantly dressed . “
235199	235207	235190	235190	I	0	” Mr. Guppy stammers , very downcast . “
235215	235216	235217	235217	I	0	” “
235228	235244	235217	235217	I	0	” She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion . “
235255	235256	235249	235250	Your ladyship	2534	” “
235262	235272	235249	235250	Your ladyship	2534	” There is not much affability in her tone . “
235316	235317	235319	235319	you	0	” “
235326	235327	235319	235319	you	0	” “
235336	235454	235319	235319	you	0	” Mr. Guppy , besides being depressed , disappointed , and uneasy , is put at a further disadvantage by the splendour and beauty of her appearance . She knows its influence perfectly ; has studied it too well to miss a grain of its effect on any one . As she looks at him so steadily and coldly , he not only feels conscious that he has no guide , in the least perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts ; but also that he is being every moment , as it were , removed further and further from her . She will not speak , it is plain . So he must . “
235461	235472	235458	235459	your ladyship	2534	” says Mr. Guppy , like a meanly penitent thief , “
235494	235505	235458	235459	your ladyship	2534	” He stops . Lady Dedlock calmly finishes the sentence . “
235515	235533	235534	235534	I	0	” Mr. Guppy would say no , if he could — as he is unable to hide . “
235541	235599	235534	235534	I	0	” If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ? No , he could see no such thing , even if that brave outside did not utterly put him away , and he were not looking beyond it and about it . He falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure . “
235608	235634	235603	235603	you	0	” inquires Lady Dedlock , having heard him out — or as nearly out as he can stumble . Mr. Guppy thinks that 's all . “
235661	235682	235635	235635	You	2534	” Mr. Guppy is quite sure . And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means . “
235698	235823	235824	235824	I	0	” and she rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy out . But in that house , in that same moment , there happens to be an old man of the name of Tulkinghorn . And that old man , coming with his quiet footstep to the library , has his hand at that moment on the handle of the door — comes in — and comes face to face with the young man as he is leaving the room . One glance between the old man and the lady ; and for an instant the blind that is always down flies up . Suspicion , eager and sharp , looks out . Another instant ; close again . “
235865	235866	235860	235860	I	0	” “
235869	235876	235860	235860	I	0	” She negligently calls him back . “
235901	235925	235890	235890	I	0	” The disconcerted young man bows , as he goes out , and cringingly hopes that Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well . “
235930	235956	235890	235890	I	0	” says the lawyer , looking at him from under his bent brows ; though he has no need to look again — not he . “
235965	235966	235967	235967	Kenge	309	” “
235981	235982	235977	235977	Guppy	326	” “
236000	236001	236007	236007	sir	9019	” “
236025	236026	236009	236009	You	9019	” “
236033	236086	236028	236028	you	9019	” Mr. Guppy sneaks away . Mr. Tulkinghorn , such a foil in his old - fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock 's brightness , hands her down the staircase to her carriage . He returns rubbing his chin , and rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening . “
236091	236096	236028	236028	you	9019	” says Mr. George , “
236119	236245	236028	236028	you	9019	” An open letter is the subject of the trooper 's speculations , and it seems to perplex him mightily . He looks at it at arm 's length , brings it close to him , holds it in his right hand , holds it in his left hand , reads it with his head on this side , with his head on that side , contracts his eyebrows , elevates them ; still , can not satisfy himself . He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then , to come upon it with a fresh eye . Even that wo n't do . “
236249	236255	236028	236028	you	9019	” Mr. George still muses , “
236261	236320	236321	236321	Phil	569	” Phil Squod , with the aid of a brush and paint - pot , is employed in the distance whitening the targets ; softly whistling , in quick - march time , and in drum - and - fife manner , that he must and he will go back again to the girl he left behind him . “
236323	236390	236393	236393	Phil	569	” The trooper beckons as he calls him . Phil approaches in his usual way ; sidling off at first as if he were going anywhere else , and then bearing down upon his commander like a bayonet - charge . Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon his dirty face , and he scrapes his one eyebrow with the handle of his brush . “
236399	236400	236403	236403	commander	12593	” “
236407	236408	236403	236403	commander	12593	” “
236504	236505	236497	236497	you	569	” “
236510	236511	236497	236497	you	569	” “
236514	236515	236516	236516	I	0	” “
236519	236540	236516	236516	I	0	” replies Phil , after pensively tracing out a cross - wrinkle in his forehead with the brush - handle , “
236553	236554	236516	236516	I	0	” “
236559	236569	236557	236557	Phil	569	” says the trooper , sitting on the table . “
236598	236636	236578	236578	I	0	” Phil intimates , by sidling back a pace or two , with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face , that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident . “
236643	236659	236641	236641	Phil	569	” says the trooper , staying his premature conclusions with a wave of his hand . “
236694	236695	236696	236696	I	0	” “
236711	236712	236713	236713	You	569	” “
236727	236728	236718	236718	I	0	” “
236741	236742	236729	236730	Joshua Smallweed	659	” “
236746	236747	236729	236730	Joshua Smallweed	659	” “
236750	236758	236759	236759	he	570	” says Phil , with exceeding gravity , “
236791	236868	236767	236767	he	570	” Having thus expressively uttered his sentiments , Mr. Squod , after waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of him , gets back , by his usual series of movements , to the target he has in hand ; and vigorously signifies , through his former musical medium , that he must and he will return to that ideal young lady . George having folded the letter walks in that direction . “
236876	236885	236913	236913	guv'ner	570	” says Phil , looking cunningly at him , “
236890	236891	236913	236913	guv'ner	570	” “
236904	236910	236901	236901	I	0	” Phil shakes his head . “
236928	236939	236940	236940	I	0	” says Phil , with a highly artistic turn of his brush—“what
236947	236948	236940	236940	I	0	” “
236951	236955	236940	236940	I	0	” Phil nods . “
236996	237012	237016	237016	you	0	” says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation , “
237021	237127	237019	237019	Phil	569	” Phil , on one knee at the target , is in course of protesting earnestly , though not without many allegorical scoops of his brush , and smoothings of the white surface round the rim with his thumb , that he had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility , and would not so much as injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family , when steps are audible in the long passage without , and a cheerful voice is heard to wonder whether George is at home . Phil , with a look at his master , hobbles up , saying , “
237140	237497	237137	237137	he	5488	” and the old girl herself , accompanied by Mr. Bagnet , appears . The old girl never appears in walking trim , in any season of the year , without a grey cloth cloak , coarse and much worn but very clean , which is , undoubtedly , the identical garment rendered so interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from another quarter of the globe , in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella . The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors . It is of no color known in this life , and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle , with a metallic object let into its prow or beak , resembling a little model of a fan - light over a street door , or one of the oval glasses out of a pair of spectacles : which ornamental object has not that tenacious capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army . The old girl 's umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist , and seems to be in need of stays — an appearance that is possibly referable to its having served , through a series of years , at home as a cupboard , and on journeys as a carpet bag . She never puts it up , having the greatest reliance on her well - proved cloak with its capacious hood ; but generally uses the instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or bunches of greens in marketing , or to arrest the attention of tradesmen by a friendly poke . Without her market - basket , which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids , she never stirs abroad . Attended by these her trusty companions , therefore , her honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet , Mrs. Bagnet now arrives , fresh - colored and bright , in George 's Shooting Gallery . “
237505	237509	237500	237500	George	562	” says she , “
237520	237633	237636	237636	George	562	” Giving him a friendly shake of the hand , Mrs. Bagnet draws a long breath after her walk , and sits down to enjoy a rest . Having a faculty , matured on the tops of baggage - wagons , and in other such positions , of resting easily anywhere , she perches on a rough bench , unties her bonnet - strings , pushes back her bonnet , crosses her arms , and looks perfectly comfortable . Mr. Bagnet , in the mean time , has shaken hands with his old comrade , and with Phil : on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good - humoured nod and smile . “
237638	237645	237636	237636	George	562	” says Mrs. Bagnet , briskly , “
237654	237700	237636	237636	George	562	” she often speaks of her husband by this appellation , on account , as it is supposed , of Lignum Vitæ having been his old regimental nickname when they first became acquainted , in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy ; “
237738	237739	237740	237740	I	0	” “
237748	237755	237740	237740	I	0	” observes the trooper , reluctantly . “
237829	237840	237827	237827	George	562	” asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk . “
237847	237848	237827	237827	George	562	” “
237855	237860	237849	237849	I	0	” returns the trooper ; “
237872	237882	237883	237883	George	562	” Her quick bright eye catches the truth directly . “
237885	237891	237883	237883	George	562	” holding up her forefinger . “
237920	237931	237932	237932	George	562	” The trooper looks at her with a troubled visage . “
237934	237957	237932	237932	George	562	” says Mrs. Bagnet , using both her arms for emphasis , and occasionally bringing down her open hands upon her knees . “
238035	238084	238085	238085	George	562	” Mr. Bagnet , otherwise as immoveable as a pump or a lamp - post , puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head , as if to defend it from a shower - bath , and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet . “
238087	238093	238085	238085	George	562	” says that old girl . “
238203	238222	238201	238201	George	562	” Mrs. Bagnet gathers up her cloak to wipe her eyes on , in a very genuine manner , “
238229	238275	238276	238276	Mat	605	” Mrs. Bagnet ceasing , Mr. Bagnet removes his hand from his head as if the shower - bath were over , and looks disconsolately at Mr. George ; who has turned quite white , and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and straw bonnet . “
238278	238298	238276	238276	Mat	605	” says the trooper , in a subdued voice , addressing him , but still looking at his wife ; “
238335	238341	238324	238324	I	0	” which he reads aloud ; “
238454	238455	238456	238457	Old girl	12874	” “
238459	238469	238471	238471	you	12874	” murmurs Mr. Bagnet , after a short silence , “
238477	238478	238471	238471	you	12874	” “
238487	238498	238484	238484	he	5502	” Mrs. Bagnet answers , half laughing and half crying , “
238518	238519	238520	238522	The old girl	12856	” “
238524	238529	238520	238522	The old girl	12856	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
238539	238540	238537	238537	you	12874	” “
238555	238560	238543	238543	she	12856	” returns the trooper . “
238663	238677	238659	238659	I	0	” says the trooper , giving himself a disparaging blow in the chest , “
238696	238697	238698	238699	Old girl	12874	” “
238701	238706	238698	238699	Old girl	12874	” murmurs Mr. Bagnet , “
238715	238716	238708	238708	him	5515	” “
238719	238725	238708	238708	him	5515	” says the old girl , “
238749	238750	238726	238726	you	562	” “
238757	238767	238755	238755	me	0	” observes the penitent trooper , shaking his head . “
238774	238775	238769	238769	me	0	” “
238782	238787	238778	238780	The old girl	12856	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
238803	238804	238778	238780	The old girl	12856	” “
238913	238948	238949	238949	I	0	” Mrs. Bagnet giving him one of her honest hands , and giving her husband the other , Mr. George gives each of them one of his , and holds them while he speaks . “
239094	239153	239154	239154	George	562	” With these concluding words , Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and , relinquishing them , backs a pace or two , in a broad - chested upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession , and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours . “
239160	239170	239171	239172	Old girl	12874	” says Mr. Bagnet , glancing at his wife . “
239177	239265	239171	239172	Old girl	12874	” Mr. Bagnet , being in this singular manner heard out , has merely to observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay ; that it is advisable that George and he should immediately wait on Mr. Smallweed in person ; and that the primary object is to save and hold harmless Mr. Bagnet , who had none of the money . Mr. George entirely assenting , puts on his hat , and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to the enemy 's camp . “
239278	239289	239276	239276	George	562	” says Mrs. Bagnet , patting him on the shoulder . “
239309	239485	239302	239302	you	562	” The trooper returns , that this is kindly said , and that he will bring Lignum through it somehow . Upon which Mrs. Bagnet , with her cloak , basket , and umbrella , goes home , bright - eyed again , to the rest of her family ; and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying Mr. Smallweed . Whether there are two people in England less likely to come satisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr. George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet , may be very reasonably questioned . Also , notwithstanding their martial appearance , broad square shoulders , and heavy tread , whether there are , within the same limits , two more simple and unaccustomed children , in all the Smallweedy affairs of life . As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of Mount Pleasant , Mr. Bagnet , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet 's late sally . “
239521	239522	239515	239515	she	12856	” “
239530	239531	239532	239532	George	562	” “
239534	239544	239545	239547	the old girl	12856	” says Mr. Bagnet , looking straight before him , “
239574	239575	239576	239576	She	12856	” “
239584	239589	239579	239579	her	12856	” returns the trooper . “
239593	239598	239599	239599	I	0	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
239658	239659	239660	239660	You	0	” “
239666	239667	239660	239660	You	0	” “
239700	239705	239695	239695	She	12856	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
239761	239762	239757	239757	she	12856	” “
239769	239774	239775	239775	I	0	” returns the trooper , “
239784	239785	239775	239775	I	0	” “
239790	239810	239786	239786	You	0	” says Mr. Bagnet , with the warmest enthusiasm , though without relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle . “
239851	239934	239786	239786	You	0	” These encomiums bring them to Mount Pleasant , and to Grandfather Smallweed 's house . The door is opened by the perennial Judy , who , having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favor , but indeed with a malignant sneer , leaves them standing there , while she consults the oracle as to their admission . The oracle may be inferred to give consent , from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips “
239946	239990	239786	239786	You	0	” Thus privileged they come in , and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair as if it were a paper footbath , and Mrs. Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing . “
239995	240012	239786	239786	You	0	” says Grandfather Smallweed , with those two lean , affectionate arms of his stretched forth . “
240030	240031	240026	240028	my dear friend	3776	” “
240035	240048	240050	240051	Matthew Bagnet	605	” returns George , not able to be very conciliatory at first , “
240066	240067	240050	240051	Matthew Bagnet	605	” “
240075	240086	240070	240071	Mr. Bagnet	605	” The old man looks at him under his hand . “
240106	240149	240150	240150	Judy	556	” No chairs being offered , Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet , and one for himself . They sit down ; Mr. Bagnet as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips for that purpose . “
240152	240157	240150	240150	Judy	556	” says Mr. Smallweed , “
240162	240163	240150	240150	Judy	556	” “
240171	240176	240166	240166	I	0	” Mr. George interposes , “
240206	240207	240210	240210	you	556	” “
240212	240218	240219	240219	Judy	556	” returns the old man . “
240225	240226	240219	240219	Judy	556	” “
240234	240238	240231	240232	Mr. Smallweed	539	” proceeds George , “
240269	240270	240259	240260	your friend	2685	” “
240275	240280	240259	240260	your friend	2685	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
240286	240287	240281	240281	He	2685	” “
240323	240339	240315	240315	I	0	” Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way , in recognition of the letter . “
240345	240350	240351	240351	Judy	556	” asks Mr. George . “
240353	240359	240351	240351	Judy	556	” says the old man . “
240383	240384	240372	240372	you	556	” “
240399	240436	240396	240397	Mr. Smallweed	539	” urges the trooper , constraining himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he can , holding the open letter in one hand , and resting the broad knuckles of the other on his thigh ; “
240535	240536	240537	240537	I	0	” “
240546	240554	240537	240537	I	0	” says the old man , quietly . “
240576	240577	240574	240574	I	0	” “
240587	240592	240582	240582	you	9019	” returns Grandfather Smallweed . “
240600	240601	240594	240594	I	0	” “
240604	240613	240594	240594	I	0	” says the trooper , swallowing his fire . “
240618	240626	240614	240614	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper , “
240635	240639	240614	240614	I	0	” And adds , “
240658	240685	240646	240647	Mr. Bagnet	605	” The unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair comfortably , and to propitiate Mr. Smallweed by taking him upon his own terms . “
240779	240797	240776	240777	Mr. Smallweed	539	” says the trooper , gaining confidence as he proceeds in this soldierly mode of doing business ; “
240832	240833	240819	240819	I	0	” “
240851	240868	240848	240849	Mr. George	562	” ( There is an Ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed to - day . ) “
240898	240899	240874	240874	you	9019	” “
240904	240940	240874	240874	you	9019	” echoes Grandfather Smallweed . In such a very hard manner , and with eyes so particularly green , that Mr. Bagnet 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man . “
240943	240949	240950	240950	I	0	” says the sanguine George , “
241031	241043	241020	241020	you	9019	” Here some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner , “
241048	241095	241020	241020	you	9019	O!”—unless , indeed , it be the sportive Judy , who is found to be silent when the startled visitors look round , but whose chin has received a recent toss , expressive of derision and contempt . Mr. Bagnet 's gravity becomes yet more profound . “
241106	241127	241099	241099	you	9019	” old Smallweed , who all this time has had the pipe in his hand , is the speaker now ; “
241140	241141	241130	241130	you	9019	” “
241149	241161	241146	241146	I	0	” returns the trooper , in his off - hand way : “
241179	241207	241163	241163	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed , purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper 's head , throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces . “
241238	241260	241228	241228	I	0	” The two friends rise and look at one another . Mr. Bagnet 's gravity has now attained its profoundest point . “
241266	241272	241273	241273	I	0	” repeats the old man . “
241359	241460	241356	241356	'em	5567	” He vociferates this so loudly , that Mr. Bagnet , laying his hands on the shoulders of his comrade , before the latter can recover from his amazement , gets him on the outside of the street door ; which is instantly slammed by the triumphant Judy . Utterly confounded , Mr. George awhile stands looking at the knocker . Mr. Bagnet , in a perfect abyss of gravity , walks up and down before the little parlor window , like a sentry , and looks in , every time he passes ; apparently revolving something in his mind . “
241465	241476	241463	241463	Mat	605	” says Mr. George , when he has recovered himself , “
241493	241520	241487	241487	you	605	” Mr. Bagnet , stopping to take a farewell look into the parlor , replies , with one shake of his head directed at the interior , “
241534	241766	241532	241532	him	1091	” Having so discharged himself of the subject of his cogitations , he falls into step , and marches off with the trooper , shoulder to shoulder . When they present themselves in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , Mr. Tulkinghorn is engaged , and not to be seen . He is not at all willing to see them ; for when they have waited a full hour , and the clerk , on his bell being rung , takes the opportunity of mentioning as much , he brings forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has nothing to say to them , and they had better not wait . They do wait , however , with the perseverance of military tactics ; and at last the bell rings again , and the client in possession comes out of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's room . The client is a handsome old lady ; no other than Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold . She comes out of the sanctuary with a fair old - fashioned curtsey , and softly shuts the door . She is treated with some distinction there ; for the clerk steps out of his pew to show her through the outer office , and to let her out . The old lady is thanking him for his attention , when she observes the comrades in waiting . “
241782	241817	241820	241820	ma'am	9088	” The clerk referring the question to them with his eye , and Mr. George not turning round from the almanack over the fire - place , Mr. Bagnet takes upon himself to reply , “
241824	241825	241826	241826	I	0	” “
241923	241924	241907	241907	I	0	” “
241931	242012	242013	242013	George	562	” returns Mr. Bagnet , with right good will . There is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady 's voice , and in the tremble that goes through her quaint old figure . But Mr. George is so occupied with the almanack over the fire - place ( calculating the coming months by it perhaps ) , that he does not look round until she has gone away , and the door is closed upon her . “
242015	242031	242013	242013	George	562	” Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers , when he does turn from there almanack at last . “
242057	242083	242054	242054	my	0	” The clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility , “
242090	242110	242085	242085	'em	5588	” they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling , and find him standing before the fire . “
242141	242188	242133	242133	I	0	” Serjeant replies — dashed within the last few minutes as to his usual manner of speech , and even as to his usual carriage — that he has received this letter , has been to Mr. Smallweed about it , and has been referred there . “
242197	242202	242189	242189	I	0	” rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
242234	242249	242220	242220	You	5590	” Serjeant is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money . “
242272	242290	242254	242256	the other man	5593	” Serjeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the money either . “
242345	242369	242370	242370	I	0	” The lawyer sits down in his easy chair and stirs the fire . Mr. George hopes he will have the goodness to — “
242448	242449	242450	242450	I	0	” “
242460	242465	242450	242450	I	0	” says Mr. George , “
242502	242522	242492	242492	you	5590	” Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with his hands in his pockets , and walks into one of the window recesses . “
242532	242575	242578	242578	sir	9019	” In the midst of his perfect assumption of indifference , he directs a sharp look at the trooper ; taking care to stand with his own back to the light , and to have the other with his face towards it . “
242580	242585	242578	242578	sir	9019	” says Mr. George , “
242637	242638	242639	242640	My friend	1760	” “
242672	242673	242678	242678	sir	9019	” “
242734	242735	242737	242737	you	0	” “
242742	242743	242737	242737	you	0	” “
242752	242753	242744	242744	I	0	” “
242756	242781	242744	242744	I	0	” the lawyer proceeds in his dry , passionless manner , far more hopeless in the dealing with , than any amount of vehemence , “
242941	242958	242938	242938	you	1760	” The trooper puts his hand into his breast , and answers with a long breath , “
242966	243064	242938	242938	you	1760	” So Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting on his spectacles , sits down and writes the undertaking ; which he slowly reads and explains to Bagnet , who has all this time been staring at the ceiling , and who puts his hand on his bald head again , under this new verbal shower - bath , and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his sentiments . The trooper then takes from his breast - pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer 's elbow . “
243083	243170	243171	243171	You	5625	” Look at a millstone , Mr. George , for some change in its expression , and you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn when he opens and reads the letter ! He re - folds it , and lays it in his desk , with a countenance as imperturbable as Death . Nor has he anything more to say or do , but to nod once in the same frigid and discourteous manner , and to say briefly , “
243182	243459	243460	243461	Old girl	12874	” Being shown out , they repair to Mr. Bagnet 's residence to dine . Boiled beef and greens constitute the day 's variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens ; and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way , and seasons it with the best of temper : being that rare sort of old girl that she receives Good to her arms without a hint that it might be Better ; and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her . The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow of Mr. George ; he is unusually thoughtful and depressed . At first Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to restore him ; but finding those young ladies sensible that their existing Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual frolicsome acquaintance , she winks off the light infantry , and leaves him to deploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth . But he does not . He remains in close order , clouded and depressed . During the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process , when he and Mr. Bagnet are supplied with their pipes , he is no better than he was at dinner . He forgets to smoke , looks at the fire and ponders , lets his pipe out , fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay , by showing that he has no enjoyment of tobacco . Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears , rosy from the invigorating pail , and sits down to her work , Mr. Bagnet growls “

243482	243492	243480	243480	George	562	” says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle . “

243564	243574	243543	243543	mother	11023	” returns the trooper , kissing the young damsels . “
243580	243583	243543	243543	mother	11023	” with a sigh—“true

243600	243608	243598	243598	George	562	” says Mrs. Bagnet , working busily , “

243747	243818	243739	243739	I	0	” In giving Mrs. Bagnet 's hand , with her work in it , a friendly shake — for she took her seat beside him — the trooper 's attention is attracted to her face . After looking at it for a little while as she plies her needle , he looks to young Woolwich , sitting on his stool in the corner , and beckons that fifer to him . “
243825	243840	243739	243739	I	0	” says George , very gently smoothing the mother 's hair with his hand , “
243893	243915	243921	243922	my boy	9484	” Mr. Bagnet 's face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest approbation and acquiescence . “
243924	243929	243921	243922	my boy	9484	” pursues the trooper , “
244028	244501	244024	244024	you	9484	” Mr. George concludes by rising from his chair , seating the boy beside his mother in it , and saying , with something of a hurry about him , that he 'll smoke his pipe in the street a bit . I LAY ill through several weeks , and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance . But , this was not the effect of time , so much as of the change in all my habits , made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick room . Before I had been confined to it many days , everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance , where there was little or no separation between the various stages of my life which had been really divided by years . In falling ill , I seemed to have crossed a dark lake , and to have left all my experiences , mingled together by the great distance , on the healthy shore . My housekeeping duties , though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were unperformed , were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf , or the summer afternoons when I went home from school with my portfolio under my arm , and my childish shadow at my side , to my godmother 's house . I had never known before how short life really was , and into how small a space the mind could put it . While I was very ill , the way in which these divisions of time became confused with one another , distressed my mind exceedingly . At once a child , an elder girl , and the little woman I had been so happy as , I was not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each station , but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile them . I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can quite understand what I mean , or what painful unrest arose from this source . For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my disorder — it seemed one long night , but I believe there were both nights and days in it — when I laboured up colossal staircases , ever striving to reach the top , and ever turned , as I have seen a worm in a garden path , by some obstruction , and labouring again . I knew perfectly at intervals , and I think vaguely at most times , that I was in my bed ; and I talked with Charley , and felt her touch , and knew her very well ; yet I would find myself complaining “
244524	244846	244521	244521	I	0	” and labouring on again . Dare I hint at that worse time when , strung together somewhere in great black space , there was a flaming necklace , or ring , or starry circle of some kind , of which I was one of the beads ! And when my only prayer was to be taken off from the rest , and when it was such inexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing ? Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences , the less tedious and the more intelligible I shall be . I do not recal them to make others unhappy , or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering them . It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions , we might be better able to alleviate their intensity . The repose that succeeded , the long delicious sleep , the blissful rest , when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself , and could have heard ( or so I think now ) that I was dying ; with no other emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind — this state can be perhaps more widely understood . I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more , and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough , that I should see again . I had heard my Ada crying at the door , day and night ; I had heard her calling to me that I was cruel and did not love her ; I had heard her praying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me , and to leave my bedside no more ; but I had only said , when I could speak , “
244855	245232	244521	244521	I	0	” and I had over and over again reminded Charley that she was to keep my darling from the room , whether I lived or died . Charley had been true to me in that time of need , and with her little hand and her great heart had kept the door fast . But now , my sight strengthening , and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on me , I could read the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening , and could put them to my lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her . I could see my little maid , so tender and so careful , going about the two rooms setting every thing in order , and speaking cheerfully to Ada from the open window again . I could understand the stillness in the house , and the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had always been so good to me . I could weep in the exquisite felicity of my heart , and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my strength . By and by , my strength began to be restored . Instead of lying , with so strange a calmness , watching what was done for me , as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for , I helped it a little , and so on to a little more and much more , until I became useful to myself , and interested , and attached to life again . How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed with pillows for the first time , to enjoy a great tea - drinking with Charley ! The little creature — sent into the world , surely , to minister to the weak and sick — was so happy , and so busy , and stopped so often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom , and fondle me , and cry with joyful tears she was so glad , she was so glad ! that I was obliged to say , “
245262	245433	245436	245436	Charley	372	” So Charley became as quiet as a mouse , and took her bright face here and there , across and across the two rooms , out of the shade into the divine sunshine , and out of the sunshine into the shade , while I watched her peacefully . When all her preparations were concluded and the pretty tea - table with its little delicacies to tempt me , and its white cloth , and its flowers , and everything so lovingly and beautifully arranged for me by Ada down - stairs , was ready at the bed - side , I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley that was not new to my thoughts . First , I complimented Charley on the room ; and indeed , it was so fresh and airy , so spotless and neat , that I could scarce believe I had been lying there so long . This delighted Charley , and her face was brighter than before . “
245438	245444	245436	245436	Charley	372	” said I looking round , “
245457	245479	245436	245436	Charley	372	” Poor little Charley looked round too , and pretended to shake her head , as if there were nothing absent . “
245490	245495	245501	245501	miss	9100	” I asked her . “
245503	245507	245501	245501	miss	9100	” said Charley . “
245514	245515	245512	245512	Charley	372	” “
245531	245532	245518	245518	I	0	” “
245536	245540	245541	245541	I	0	” said I , “
245564	245660	245555	245555	Charley	372	” Charley got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there . I had thought of this very often . I was now certain of it . I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now . I called Charley back ; and when she came — at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved — I took her in my arms , and said , “
245789	245796	245773	245773	he	9683	“ My dear , dear girl ! ”
245835	245839	245840	245840	I	0	“ O yes ! ”
245843	245882	245883	245883	He	9683	“ He has seen me , and he loves me better than he did ; he has seen me , and is even fonder of me than he was before ; and what have I to mourn for ! ”
245938	245943	245945	245945	he	9683	“ My little woman , ”
245947	245967	245945	245945	he	9683	“ what a sad time this has been . Such an inflexible little woman , too , through all ! ”
245968	245976	245978	245978	I.	0	“ Only for the best , guardian , ”
245979	245984	245985	245985	he	9683	“ For the best ? ”
245990	246053	245985	245985	he	9683	“ Of course , for the best . But here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable ; here has your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early ; here has everyone about the house been utterly lost and dejected ; here has even poor Rick been writing — to me too — in his anxiety for you ! ”
246074	246081	246082	246082	he	9683	“ Why no , my dear , ”
246085	246098	246082	246082	he	9683	“ I have thought it better not to mention it to her . ”
246099	246109	246111	246111	I	0	“ And you speak of his writing to you , ”
246117	246142	246111	246111	I	0	“ As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! ”
246143	246152	246082	246082	he	9683	“ He thinks he could , my love , ”
246157	246269	246082	246082	he	9683	“ and to many a better . The truth is , he wrote to me under a sort of protest , while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer — wrote coldly , haughtily , distantly , resentfully . Well , dearest little woman , we must look forbearingly on it . He is not to blame . Jarndyce and Jarndyce has warped him out of himself , and perverted me in his eyes . I have known it do as bad deeds , and worse , many a time . If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . ”
246270	246279	246082	246082	he	9683	“ It has not changed yours , guardian . ”
246280	246290	246291	246291	he	5652	“ Oh yes , it has , my dear , ”
246296	246494	246291	246291	he	5652	“ It has made the south wind easterly , I do n't know how often . Rick mistrusts and suspects me — goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me . Hears I have conflicting interests ; claims clashing against his , and what not . Whereas , Heaven knows , that if I could get out of the mountains of Wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so long bestowed ( which I ca n't ) , or could level them by the extinction of my own original right ( which I ca n't , either , and no human power ever can , anyhow , I believe , to such a pass have we got ) , I would do it this hour . I would rather restore to poor Rick his proper nature , than be endowed with all the money that dead suitors , broken , heart and soul , upon the wheel of Chancery , have left unclaimed with the Accountant - General — and that 's money enough , my dear , to be cast into a pyramid , in memory of Chancery 's transcendant wickedness . ”
246495	246502	246503	246503	I	0	“ Is it possible , guardian , ”
246508	246517	246503	246503	I	0	“ that Richard can be suspicious of you ? ”
246518	246527	246528	246528	he	5653	“ Ah , my love , my love , ”
246531	246567	246528	246528	he	5653	“ it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases . His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight . It is not his fault . ”
246568	246578	246503	246503	I	0	“ But it is a terrible misfortune , guardian . ”
246579	246681	246682	246682	I	0	“ It is a terrible misfortune , little woman , to be ever drawn within the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . I know none greater . By little and little he has been induced to trust in that rotten reed , and it communicates some portion of its rottenness to everything around him . But again , I say , with all my soul , we must be patient with poor Rick , and not blame him . What a troop of fine fresh hearts , like his , have I seen in my time turned by the same means ! ”
246703	246713	246714	246714	he	5654	“ We must not say so , Dame Durden , ”
246718	246787	246714	246714	he	5654	“ Ada is the happier , I hope ; and that is much . I did think that I and both these young creatures might be friends , instead of distrustful foes , and that we might so far counteract the suit , and prove too strong for it . But it was too much to expect . Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of Rick 's cradle . ”
246788	246813	246682	246682	I	0	“ But , guardian , may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is ? ”
246814	246823	246825	246826	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ We will hope so , my Esther , ”
246828	246913	246915	246915	he	313	“ and that it may not teach him so too late . In any case we must not be hard on him . There are not many grown and matured men living while we speak , good men too , who , if they were thrown into this same court as suitors , would not be vitally changed and depreciated within three years — within two — within one . How can we stand amazed at poor Rick ? A young man so unfortunate , ”
246929	247026	246924	246924	he	313	“ can not at first believe ( who could ? ) that Chancery is what it is . He looks to it , flushed and fitfully , to do something with his interests , and bring them to some settlement . It procrastinates , disappoints , tries , tortures him ; wears out his sanguine hopes and patience , thread by thread ; but he still looks to it , and hankers after it , and finds his whole world treacherous and hollow . Well , well , well ! Enough of this , my dear ! ”
247098	247106	247108	247109	my guardian	9683	“ There are better subjects than these , ”
247111	247158	247108	247109	my guardian	9683	“ for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl 's recovery . And I had a commission to broach one of them , as soon as I should begin to talk . When shall Ada come to see you , my love ? ”
247196	247200	247202	247202	I	0	“ Dear guardian , ”

247282	247291	247293	247293	he	5659	“ Yes , yes , you are tired , ”
247295	247300	247293	247293	he	5659	“ Rest a little . ”

247320	247414	247312	247312	I	0	“ I think I should like to have my own way a little longer , guardian . It would be best to be away from here before I see her . If Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there , in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air , and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again , I think it would be better for us . ”

247505	247598	247502	247503	my guardian	9683	“ shall have her own way even in her inflexibility , though at the price , I know , of tears down - stairs . And see here ! Here is Boythorn , heart of chivalry , breathing such ferocious vows as never were breathed on paper before , that if you do n't go and occupy his whole house , he having already turned out of it expressly for that purpose , by Heaven and by earth he 'll pull it down , and not leave one brick standing on another ! ”

I have one other petition . Little Miss Flite , hearing a rumour that you were ill , made nothing of walking down here — twenty miles , poor soul , in a pair of dancing shoes — to inquire . It was Heaven 's mercy we were at home , or she would have walked back again . ”

249447	249466	249444	249445	Miss Flite	423	“ My brother . My sister . They all expected a Judgment . The same that I expect . ”

249539	249545	249546	249546	she	423	“ Why , my dear , ”
249550	249556	249546	249546	she	423	“ of course it would ! ”
249557	249566	249528	249528	I	0	“ And to attend the court no more ? ”
249567	249572	249574	249574	she	423	“ Equally of course , ”
249576	249604	249574	249574	she	423	“ Very wearing to be always in expectation of what never comes , my dear Fitz Jarndyce ! Wearing , I assure you , to the bone ! ”
249619	249625	249626	249626	she	423	“ But , my dear , ”
249635	249691	249626	249626	she	423	“ there 's a dreadful attraction in the place . Hush ! Do n't mention it to our diminutive friend , when she comes in . Or it may frighten her . With good reason . There 's a cruel attraction in the place . You ca n't leave it . And you must expect . ”
249718	249794	249703	249703	She	423	“ Aye , aye , aye ! You think so , because I am a little rambling . Ve - ry absurd , to be a little rambling , is it not ? Ve - ry confusing , too . To the head . I find it so . But , my dear , I have been there many years , and I have noticed . It 's the Mace and Seal upon the table . ”
249809	249812	249804	249804	I	0	“ Draw , ”
249817	249866	249867	249867	She	423	“ Draw people on , my dear . Draw peace out of them . Sense out of them . Good looks out of them . Good qualities out of them . I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night . Cold and glittering devils ! ”
249913	249918	249920	249920	she	423	“ Let me see , ”
249922	250145	249920	249920	she	423	“ I 'll tell you my own case . Before they ever drew me — before I had ever seen them — what was it I used to do ? Tambourine playing ? No . Tambour work . I and my sister worked at tambour work . Our father and our brother had a builder 's business . We all lived together . Ve - ry respectably , my dear ! First , our father was drawn — slowly . Home was drawn with him . In a few years , he was a fierce , sour , angry bankrupt , without a kind word or a kind look for any one . He had been so different , Fitz Jarndyce . He was drawn to a debtor 's prison . There he died . Then our brother was drawn — swiftly — to drunkenness . And rags . And death . Then my sister was drawn . Hush ! Never ask to what ! Then I was ill , and in misery ; and heard , as I had often heard before , that this was all the work of Chancery . When I got better , I went to look at the Monster . And then I found out how it was , and I was drawn to stay there . ”
250188	250379	250178	250178	she	5687	“ You do n't quite credit me , my dear ! Well well ! You will , some day . I am a little rambling . But I have noticed . I have seen many new faces come , unsuspicious , within the influence of the Mace and Seal , in these many years . As my father 's came there . As my brother 's . As my sister 's . As my own . I hear Conversation Kenge , and the rest of them , say to the new faces , ‘ Here 's little Miss Flite . O you are new here ; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite ! ’ Ve - ry good . Proud I am sure to have the honor ! And we all laugh . But , Fitz Jarndyce , I know what will happen . I know , far better than they do , when the attraction has begun . I know the signs , my dear . I saw them begin in Gridley . And I saw them end . Fitz Jarndyce , my love , ”
250384	250412	250178	250178	she	5687	“ I saw them beginning in our friend the Ward in Jarndyce . Let some one hold him back . Or he 'll be drawn to ruin . ”
250466	250498	250453	250453	she	5688	“ Yes , my dear , as I was saying , I expect a Judgment . Shortly . Then I shall release my birds , you know , and confer estates . ”
250552	250558	250559	250559	she	5688	“ But , my dear , ”
250573	250589	250559	250559	she	5688	“ You have not congratulated me on my physician . Positively not once , yet ! ”
250605	250654	250602	250602	she	5688	“ My physician , Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me . Though his services were rendered quite gratuitously . Until the Day of Judgment . I mean the judgment that will dissolve the spell upon me of the Mace and Seal . ”
250655	250665	250667	250667	I	0	“ Mr. Woodcourt is so far away , now , ”
250669	250684	250667	250667	I	0	“ that I thought the time for such congratulation was past , Miss Flite . ”
250685	250691	250602	250602	she	5688	“ But , my child , ”
250695	250708	250692	250692	she	5688	“ is it possible that you do n't know what has happened ? ”
250709	250712	250714	250714	I.	0	“ No , ”
250715	250729	250714	250714	I.	0	“ Not what everybody has been talking of , my beloved Fitz Jarndyce ? ”
250730	250733	250735	250735	I.	0	“ No , ”
250736	250746	250714	250714	I.	0	“ You forget how long I have been here . ”
250747	250811	250714	250714	I.	0	“ True ! My dear , for the moment — true . I blame myself . But my memory has been drawn out of me , with everything else , by what I mentioned . Ve - ry strong influence , is it not ? Well , my dear , there has been a terrible shipwreck over in those East - Indian seas . ”
250812	250817	250714	250714	I.	0	“ Mr. Woodcourt shipwrecked ! ”
250818	250996	250714	250714	I.	0	“ Do n't be agitated , my dear . He is safe . An awful scene . Death in all shapes . Hundreds of dead and dying . Fire , storm , and darkness . Numbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock . There , and through it all , my dear physician was a hero . Calm and brave , through everything . Saved many lives , never complained in hunger and thirst , wrapped naked people in his spare clothes , took the lead , showed them what to do , governed them , tended the sick , buried the dead , and brought the poor survivors safely off at last ! My dear , the poor emaciated creatures all but worshipped him . They fell down at his feet , when they got to the land , and blessed him . The whole country rings with it . Stay ! Where 's my bag of documents ? I have got it there , and you shall read it , you shall read it ! ”
251231	251235	251237	251237	she	5696	“ My dear , ”
251249	251274	251237	251237	she	5696	“ my brave physician ought to have a Title bestowed upon him . And no doubt he will . You are of that opinion ? ”
251292	251299	251300	251300	she	5696	“ Why not , Fitz Jarndyce ? ”
251347	251353	251355	251356	Miss Flite	423	“ Why , good gracious , ”
251358	251441	251355	251356	Miss Flite	423	“ how can you say that ? Surely you know , my dear , that all the greatest ornaments of England , in knowledge , imagination , active humanity , and improvement of every sort , are added to its nobility ! Look round you , my dear , and consider . You must be rambling a little now , I think , if you do n't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! ”
252070	252098	252099	252099	He	372	“ Esther , my dear , I think you are quite sensible enough to sit down now , and write a note of thanks to your host . ”

255117	255124	255098	255098	she	288	“ Is this your young attendant ? ”
255125	255128	255098	255098	she	288	“ Yes . ”

From day to day , sometimes from hour to hour , I do not see the way before my guilty feet . This is the earthly punishment I have brought upon myself . I bear it , and I hide it . ”
255758	255792	255795	255795	she	288	“ I must keep this secret , if by any means it can be kept , not wholly for myself . I have a husband , wretched and dishonoring creature that I am ! ”

256268	256316	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ Not a friend . One who is too passionless to be either . He is Sir Leicester Dedlock 's lawyer ; mechanically faithful without attachment , and very jealous of the profit , privilege , and reputation of being master of the mysteries of great houses . ”
256317	256323	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ Has he any suspicious ? ”

256379	256425	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ He has none , and no anger . He is indifferent to everything but his calling . His calling is the acquisition of secrets , and the holding possession of such power as they give him , with no sharer or opponent in it . ”
256426	256433	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ Could you trust in him ? ”
256434	256488	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ I shall never try . The dark road I have trodden for so many years will end where it will . I follow it alone to the end , whatever the end be . It may be near , it may be distant ; while the road lasts , nothing turns me . ”
256489	256498	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ Dear mother , are you so resolved ? ”
256499	256589	256247	256248	my mother	2309	“ I am resolved . I have long outbidden folly with folly , pride with pride , scorn with scorn , insolence with insolence , and have outlived many vanities with many more . I will outlive this danger , and outdie it , if I can . It has closed around me , almost as awfully as if these woods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house ; but my course through it is the same . I have but one ; I can have but one . ”

To hope to do what I seek to do , I must be what I have been so long . Such is my reward and doom . If you hear of Lady Dedlock , brilliant , prosperous , and flattered ; think of your wretched mother , conscience - stricken , underneath that mask ! Think that the reality is in her suffering , in her useless remorse , in her murdering within her breast the only love and truth of which it is capable ! And then forgive her , if you can ; and cry to Heaven to forgive her , which it never can ! ”
257805	257850	257852	257852	them	5843	“ Your mother , Esther , was your disgrace , and you are hers . The time will come — and soon enough — when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ”

261256	261310	261254	261254	Richard	320	“ It 's all right . It does as well as anything else , for a time . I do n't know that I shall care about it when I come to be settled ; but I can sell out then , and — however , never mind all that botheration at present . ”
261349	261360	261362	261362	Richard	320	“ I am in town on leave , just now , ”
261364	261367	261362	261362	Richard	320	“ Indeed ? ”
261368	261389	261391	261391	Richard	320	“ Yes . I have run over to look after my — my Chancery interests , before the long vacation , ”
261398	261416	261391	261391	Richard	320	“ We are beginning to spin along with that old suit at last , I promise you . ”
261425	261437	261438	261438	Richard	320	“ As you say , it 's not a pleasant subject . ”
261450	261471	261438	261438	Richard	320	“ Let it go to the four winds for to - night.—Puff ! Gone!—Who do you suppose is with me ? ”
261472	261482	261522	261522	nobody	928	“ Was it Mr. Skimpole 's voice I heard ? ”
261483	261504	261505	261505	I	0	“ That 's the man ! He does me more good than anybody . What a fascinating child it is ! ”
261589	261609	261611	261611	Richard	320	“ And he is worth — not to say his sordid expenses — but thrice his weight in gold , ”
261613	261632	261611	261611	Richard	320	“ He is such a cheery fellow . No worldliness about him . Fresh and green - hearted ! ”
261791	261803	261805	261806	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Miss Summerson , here is our friend Richard , ”
261808	262027	261805	261806	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ full of the brightest visions of the future , which he evokes out of the darkness of Chancery . Now that 's delightful , that 's inspiriting , that 's full of poetry ! In old times , the woods and solitudes were made joyous to the shepherd by the imaginary piping and dancing of Pan and the Nymphs . This present shepherd , our pastoral Richard , brightens the dull Inns of Court by making Fortune and her train sport through them to the melodious notes of a judgment from the bench . That 's very pleasant you know ! Some ill - conditioned growling fellow may say to me , ‘ What 's the use of these legal and equitable abuses ? How do you defend them ? ’ I reply , ‘ My growling friend , I do n't defend them , but they are very agreeable to me . There is a shepherd - youth , a friend of mine , who transmutes them into something highly fascinating to my simplicity . I do n't say it is for this that they exist — for I am a child among you worldly grumblers , and not called upon to account to you or myself for anything — but it may be so . ’ ”
262207	262222	262197	262197	I	0	“ Ada , my love , I have brought a gentleman to visit you . ”
262609	262620	262622	262623	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ For I am constantly being taken in these nets , ”
262639	262738	262622	262623	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ and am constantly being bailed out — like a boat . Or paid off — like a ship 's company . Somebody always does it for me . I ca n't do it , you know , for I never have any money . But Somebody does it . I get out by Somebody 's means ; I am not like the starling ; I get out . If you were to ask me who Somebody is , upon my word , I could n't tell you . Let us drink to Somebody . God bless him ! ”
262858	262865	262867	262867	Richard	320	“ This is a lovely place , ”
262872	262885	262867	262867	Richard	320	“ None of the jar and discord of law - suits here ! ”
262892	262902	262904	262904	Richard	320	“ I tell you what , my dear girl , ”
262906	262927	262904	262904	Richard	320	“ when I get affairs in general settled , I shall come down here , I think , and rest . ”
262928	262938	262939	262939	I	0	“ Would it not be better to rest now ? ”
262942	262950	262952	262952	Richard	320	“ Oh , as to resting now , ”
262954	262987	262952	262952	Richard	320	“ or as to doing anything very definite now , that 's not easy . In short , it ca n't be done ; I ca n't do it , at least . ”

262995	263073	262994	262994	I.	0	“ You know why not , Esther . If you were living in an unfinished house liable to have the roof put on or taken off — to be from top to bottom pulled down or built up — to - morrow , next day , next week , next month , next year — you would find it hard to rest or settle . So do I. Now ? There 's no now for us suitors . ”
263123	263128	263130	263130	I	0	“ My dear Richard , ”
263132	263142	263130	263130	I	0	“ this is a bad beginning of our conversation . ”
263143	263155	263355	263355	He	5959	“ I knew you would tell me so , Dame Durden . ”
263156	263186	263130	263130	I	0	“ And not I alone , dear Richard . It was not I who cautioned you once , never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse . ”
263187	263196	263198	263198	Richard	320	“ There you come back to John Jarndyce ! ”
263202	263292	263198	263198	Richard	320	“ Well ! We must approach him sooner or later , for he is the staple of what I have to say ; and it 's as well at once . My dear Esther , how can you be so blind ? Do n't you see that he is an interested party , and that it may be very well for him to wish me to know nothing of the suit , and care nothing about it , but that it may not be quite so well for me ? ”
263293	263297	263130	263130	I	0	“ O Richard , ”
263301	263354	263298	263298	I	0	“ is it possible that you can ever have seen him and heard him , that you can ever have lived under his roof and known him , and can yet breathe , even to me in this solitary place where there is no one to hear us , such unworthy suspicions ? ”
263386	263421	263379	263379	he	5959	“ Esther , I am sure you know that I am not a mean fellow , and that I have some sense of suspicion and distrust being poor qualities in one of my years . ”
263422	263429	263431	263431	I.	5960	“ I know it very well , ”
263432	263441	263379	263379	he	5959	“ I am not more sure of anything . ”

263453	263498	263451	263451	Richard	320	“ and like you , because it gives me comfort . I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all this business , for it 's a bad one at the best , as I have no occasion to tell you . ”
263499	263504	263506	263506	I	0	“ I know perfectly , ”
263508	263551	263506	263506	I	0	“ I know as well , Richard — what shall I say ? as well as you do — that such misconstructions are foreign to your nature . And I know , as well as you know , what so changes it . ”
263552	263559	263561	263561	Richard	320	“ Come , sister , come , ”
263568	263664	263561	263561	Richard	320	“ you will be fair with me at all events . If I have the misfortune to be under that influence , so has he . If it has a little twisted me , it may have a little twisted him , too . I do n't say that he is not an honorable man , out of all this complication and uncertainty ; I am sure he is . But it taints everybody . You know it taints everybody . You have heard him say so fifty times . Then why should he escape ? ”
263665	263668	263670	263670	I	0	“ Because , ”
263672	263691	263670	263670	I	0	“ his is an uncommon character , and he has resolutely kept himself outside the circle , Richard . ”
263692	263699	263701	263701	Richard	320	“ Oh , because and because ! ”
263708	263771	263704	263704	his	5961	“ I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference . It may cause other parties interested to become lax about their interests ; and people may die off , and points may drag themselves out of memory , and many things may smoothly happen that are convenient enough . ”
263818	263821	263822	263822	Richard	320	“ Esther , ”
263825	264018	263822	263822	Richard	320	“ you are not to suppose that I have come here to make under - handed charges against John Jarndyce . I have only come to justify myself . What I say is , it was all very well , and we got on very well , while I was a boy , utterly regardless of this same suit ; but as soon as I began to take an interest in it , and to look into it , then it was quite another thing . Then John Jarndyce discovers that Ada and I must break off , and that if I do n't amend that very objectionable course , I am not fit for her . Now , Esther , I do n't mean to amend that very objectionable course : I will not hold John Jarndyce 's favor on those unfair terms of compromise , which he has no right to dictate . Whether it pleases him or displeases him , I must maintain my rights , and Ada 's . I have been thinking about it a good deal , and this is the conclusion I have come to . ”
264049	264164	264034	264034	His	5963	“ So I tell him honorably ( you are to know I have written to him about all this ) , that we are at issue , and that we had better be at issue openly than covertly . I thank him for his good - will and his protection , and he goes his road , and I go mine . The fact is , our roads are not the same . Under one of the wills in dispute , I should take much more than he . I do n't mean to say that it is the one to be established ; but there it is , and it has its chance . ”
264165	264178	264180	264180	I	0	“ I have not to learn from you , my dear Richard , ”
264182	264201	264180	264180	I	0	“ of your letter . I had heard of it already , without an offended or angry word . ”
264202	264205	264207	264207	Richard	320	“ Indeed ? ”
264211	264337	264034	264034	His	5963	“ I am glad I said he was an honorable man , out of all this wretched affair . But I always say that , and have never doubted it . Now , my dear Esther , I know these views of mine appear extremely harsh to you , and will to Ada when you tell her what has passed between us . But if you had gone into the case as I have , if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I did when I was at Kenge 's , if you only knew what an accumulation of charges and counter - charges , and suspicions and cross - suspicions , they involve , you would think me moderate in comparison . ”
264338	264342	264344	264344	I.	5964	“ Perhaps so , ”
264345	264366	264344	264344	I.	5964	“ But do you think that , among those many papers , there is much truth and justice , Richard ? ”
264367	264380	264034	264034	His	5963	“ There is truth and justice somewhere in the case , Esther — ”
264381	264389	264391	264391	I.	5964	“ Or was once , long ago , ”
264392	264401	264403	264403	Richard	320	“ Is — is — must be somewhere , ”
264407	264491	264403	264403	Richard	320	“ and must be brought out . To allow Ada to be made a bribe and hush - money of , is not the way to bring it out . You say the suit is changing me ; John Jarndyce says it changes , has changed , and will change , everybody who has any share in it . Then the greater right I have on my side , when I resolve to do all I can to bring it to an end . ”
264492	264526	264034	264034	His	5963	“ All you can , Richard ! Do you think that in these many years no others have done all they could ? Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many failures ? ”
264527	264535	264537	264537	Richard	320	“ It ca n't last for ever , ”
264555	264597	264537	264537	Richard	320	“ I am young and earnest ; and energy and determination have done wonders many a time . Others have only half thrown themselves into it . I devote myself to it . I make it the object of my life . ”
264598	264616	264034	264034	His	5963	“ O , Richard , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! ”
264617	264632	264633	264633	he	5965	“ No , no , no , do n't you be afraid for me , ”
264638	264696	264633	264633	he	5965	“ You 're a dear , good , wise , quiet , blessed girl ; but you have your prepossessions . So I come round to John Jarndyce . I tell you , my good Esther , when he and I were on those terms which he found so convenient , we were not on natural terms . ”
264697	264708	264034	264034	His	5963	“ Are division and animosity your natural terms , Richard ? ”
264709	264803	264034	264034	His	5963	“ No , I do n't say that . I mean that all this business puts us on unnatural terms , with which natural relations are incompatible . See another reason for urging it on ! I may find out , when it 's over , that I have been mistaken in John Jarndyce . My head may be clearer when I am free of it , and I may then agree with what you say to - day . Very well . Then I shall acknowledge it , and make him reparation . ”
264820	264828	264830	264830	Richard	320	“ Now , my best of confidantes , ”
264832	264916	264918	264918	Richard	320	“ I want my cousin , Ada , to understand that I am not captious , fickle , and wilful , about John Jarndyce ; but that I have this purpose and reason at my back . I wish to represent myself to her through you , because she has a great esteem and respect for her cousin John ; and I know you will soften the course I take , even though you disapprove of it ; and — and in short , ”
264928	264954	264918	264918	Richard	320	“ I — I do n't like to represent myself in this litigious , contentious , doubting character , to a confiding girl like Ada . ”
264977	264980	264982	264982	Richard	320	“ Why , ”
264984	265032	264982	264982	Richard	320	“ that may be true enough , my love . I rather feel it to be so . But I shall be able to give myself fair - play by and by . I shall come all right again , then , do n't you be afraid . ”
265047	265051	265053	265053	Richard	320	“ Not quite , ”
265055	265340	265053	265053	Richard	320	“ I am bound not to withhold from her that John Jarndyce answered my letter in his usual manner , addressing me as ‘ My dear Rick , ’ trying to argue me out of my opinions , and telling me that they should make no difference in him . ( All very well of course , but not altering the case . ) I also want Ada to know , that if I see her seldom just now , I am looking after her interests as well as my own — we two being in the same boat exactly — and that I hope she will not suppose , from any flying rumours she may hear , that I am at all light - headed or imprudent ; on the contrary , I am always looking forward to the termination of the suit , and always planning in that direction . Being of age now , and having taken the step I have taken , I consider myself free from any accountability to John Jarndyce ; but Ada being still a ward of the Court , I do n't yet ask her to renew our engagement . When she is free to act for herself , I shall be myself once more , and we shall both be in very different worldly circumstances , I believe . If you will tell her all this with the advantage of your considerate way , you will do me a very great and a very kind service , my dear Esther ; and I shall knock Jarndyce and Jarndyce on the head with greater vigor . Of course I ask for no secresy at Bleak House . ”

265414	265425	265346	265346	I	0	“ But I may ask you a question , Richard ? ”
265426	265431	265433	265433	he	5967	“ I think so , ”
265437	265451	265433	265433	he	5967	“ I do n't know who may not , if you may not . ”
265452	265467	265346	265346	I	0	“ You say , yourself , you are not leading a very settled life ? ”
265468	265481	265346	265346	I	0	“ How can I , my dear Esther , with nothing settled ! ”
265482	265489	265433	265433	he	5967	“ Are you in debt again ? ”

265506	265512	265499	265499	Richard	320	“ Is it of course ? ”
265513	265586	265588	265588	Richard	320	“ My dear child , certainly . I ca n't throw myself into an object so completely , without expense . You forget , or perhaps you do n't know , that under either of the wills Ada and I take something . It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller . I shall be within the mark any way . Bless your heart , my excellent girl , ”
265595	265610	265588	265588	Richard	320	“ I shall be all right ! I shall pull through , my dear ! ”
266453	266461	266462	266462	he	5983	“ Responsibility , my dear Miss Summerson ? ”
266474	266501	266462	266462	he	5983	“ I am the last man in the world for such a thing . I never was responsible in my life — I ca n't be . ”
266502	266512	266514	266514	I	0	“ I am afraid everybody is obliged to be , ”

266551	266577	266578	266578	he	5983	“ But every man 's not obliged to be solvent ? I am not . I never was . See , my dear Miss Summerson , ”
266591	266685	266578	266578	he	5983	“ there 's so much money . I have not an idea how much . I have not the power of counting . Call it four and ninepence — call if four pound nine . They tell me I owe more than that . I dare say I do . I dare say I owe as much as good - natured people will let me owe . If they do n't stop , why should I ? There you have Harold Skimpole in little . If that 's responsibility , I am responsible . ”
266741	266748	266749	266749	he	5983	“ Now when you mention responsibility , ”
266752	266842	266749	266749	he	5983	“ I am disposed to say , that I never had the happiness of knowing any one whom I should consider so refreshingly responsible as yourself . You appear to me to be the very touchstone of responsibility . When I see you , my dear Miss Summerson , intent upon the perfect working of the whole little orderly system of which you are the centre , I feel inclined to say to myself — in fact I do say to myself , very often — that 's responsibility ! ”
266885	266889	266890	266890	he	5989	“ Most willingly , ”
266893	266970	266890	266890	he	5989	“ if I could . But , my dear Miss Summerson , I have no art , no disguise . If he takes me by the hand , and leads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after Fortune , I must go . If he says , ‘ Skimpole , join the dance ! ’ I must join it . Common sense would n't , I know ; but I have no common sense . ”
266971	266979	266980	266980	I	0	“ It was very unfortunate for Richard , ”

266994	267242	266991	266992	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Do n't say that , do n't say that . Let us suppose him keeping company with Common Sense — an excellent man — a good deal wrinkled — dreadfully practical — change for a ten - pound note in every pocket — ruled account - book in his hand — say , upon the whole , resembling a tax - gatherer . Our dear Richard , sanguine , ardent , overleaping obstacles , bursting with poetry like a young bud , says to this highly respectable companion , ‘ I see a golden prospect before me ; it 's very bright , it 's very beautiful , it 's very joyous ; here I go , bounding over the landscape to come at it ! ’ The respectable companion instantly knocks him down with the ruled account - book ; tells him , in a literal prosaic way , that he sees no such thing ; shows him it 's nothing but fees , fraud , horsehair wigs , and black gowns . Now you know that 's a painful change;—sensible in the last degree , I have no doubt , but disagreeable . I ca n't do it . I have n't got the ruled account - book , I have none of the tax - gathering elements in my composition , I am not at all respectable , and I do n't want to be . Odd perhaps , but so it is ! ”

267874	267980	267981	267981	I	0	” His further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard 's coming back to us in an excited state , and hastily presenting Mr. Vholes — a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were cold , a red eruption here and there upon his face , tall and thin , about fifty years of age , high - shouldered , and stooping . Dressed in black , black - gloved , and buttoned to the chin , there was nothing so remarkable in him as a lifeless manner , and a slow fixed way he had of looking at Richard . “
267991	268012	268013	268013	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes ; and now I observed that he was further remarkable for an inward manner of speaking . “
268078	268079	268061	268061	I	0	” “
268082	268096	268061	268061	I	0	” said Richard , flushed , and looking triumphantly at Ada and me , “
268147	268148	268150	268150	you	680	” “
268155	268160	268153	268153	sir	9019	” returned Mr. Vholes . “
268168	268169	268153	268153	sir	9019	” “
268174	268183	268153	268153	sir	9019	” said Richard , looking at his watch . “
268248	268280	268241	268242	Mr. Vholes	680	” He was away directly , in his heat and hurry , and was soon lost in the dusk of evening . We who were left walked on towards the house . “
268293	268296	268282	268283	Mr. Carstone	320	” said I. “
268303	268304	268282	268283	Mr. Carstone	320	” “
268309	268314	268307	268307	miss	9100	” Mr. Vholes replied . “
268323	268343	268315	268315	I	0	” Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed . “
268357	268362	268353	268353	his	0	” said Mr. Vholes , “
268442	268470	268440	268440	miss	9100	” The remark being made to me , in consequence of my being next him as we walked , I assented , and enumerated its chief attractions . “
268473	268478	268440	268440	miss	9100	” said Mr. Vholes . “
268517	268539	268542	268542	miss	9100	” To keep up the conversation , I asked Mr. Vholes if he would like to live altogether in the country ? “
268544	268548	268549	268549	you	9100	” said he , “
268688	268708	268709	268709	You	6042	” It required some attention to hear him , on account of his inward speaking and his lifeless manner . “
268718	268722	268709	268709	You	6042	” he said . “
268747	268811	268817	268817	you	6042	” We now arrived at Mr. Boythorn 's house , where the tea - table , all prepared , was awaiting us . Richard came in , restless and hurried , shortly afterwards , and leaning over Mr. Vholes 's chair , whispered something in his ear . Mr. Vholes replied aloud — or as nearly aloud I suppose as he ever replied to anything—“You
268842	269313	269321	269321	Esther	305	” We understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for . As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard , and very sorry so to part with him , we made it as plain as we politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms , and retire when the night - travellers were gone . Richard 's high spirits carrying everything before them , we all went out together to the top of the hill above the village , where he had ordered a gig to wait ; and where we found a man with a lantern standing at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been harnessed to it . I never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern 's light ; Richard , all flush and fire and laughter , with the reins in his hand ; Mr. Vholes , quite still , black - gloved , and buttoned up , looking at him as if he were looking at his prey and charming it . I have before me the whole picture of the warm dark night , the summer lightning , the dusty track of road closed in by hedgerows and high trees , the gaunt pale horse with his ears pricked up , and the driving away at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce . My dear girl told me , that night , how Richard 's being thereafter prosperous or ruined , befriended or deserted , could only make this difference to her , that the more he needed love from one unchanging heart , the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him ; how he thought of her through his present errors , and she would think of him at all times : never of herself , if she could devote herself to him : never of her own delights , if she could minister to his . And she kept her word ? I look along the road before me , where the distance already shortens and the journey 's end is growing visible ; and , true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit , and all the ashey fruit it casts ashore , I think I see my darling . WHEN our time came for returning to Bleak House again , we were punctual to the day , and were received with an overpowering welcome . I was perfectly restored to health and strength ; and finding my housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room , rang myself in as if I had been a new year , with a merry little peal . “
269323	269327	269321	269321	Esther	305	” said I ; “
269367	269751	269357	269357	I	0	” The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business , devoted to such settlements of accounts , such repeated journeys to and fro between the Growlery and all other parts of the house , so many re - arrangements of drawers and presses , and such a general new beginning altogether , that I had not a moment 's leisure . But when these arrangements were completed , and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to London , which something in the letter I had destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own mind . I made Caddy Jellyby — her maiden name was so natural to me that I always called her by it — the pretext for this visit ; and wrote her a note previously , asking the favor of her company on a little business expedition . Leaving home very early in the morning , I got to London by stage - coach in such good time , that I walked to Newman Street with the day before me . Caddy , who had not seen me since her wedding - day , was so glad and so affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her husband jealous . But he was , in his way , just as bad — I mean as good ; and in short it was the old story , and nobody would leave me any possibility of doing anything meritorious . The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed , I found , and Caddy was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice — it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing — was waiting to carry up - stairs . Her father - in - law was extremely kind and considerate , Caddy told me , and they lived most happily together . ( When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews . ) “
269760	269763	269758	269758	Caddy	328	” said I. “
269773	269777	269771	269771	Esther	305	” replied Caddy , “
269827	269880	269817	269817	she	6049	” It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations , before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others , she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd ; but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself . “
269887	269888	269885	269885	Caddy	328	” “
269895	269899	269889	269889	He	10796	” returned Caddy , “
269920	269957	269889	269889	He	10796	” Looking at the corner , I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby 's head against the wall . It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting - place for it . “
269963	269967	269959	269959	you	328	” said I , “
269978	269979	269968	269968	you	328	” “
269985	269989	269990	269990	I	0	” returned Caddy , “
270054	270078	270043	270043	he	492	” The notion of the apprentices was still so odd to me , that I asked Caddy if there were many of them ? “
270081	270085	270043	270043	he	492	” said Caddy . “
270151	270152	270138	270138	we	6067	” “
270163	270166	270138	270138	we	6067	” said I. “
270172	270176	270138	270138	we	6067	” said Caddy . “
270218	270219	270210	270210	we	6067	” “
270227	270231	270232	270232	I	0	” I exclaimed . “
270239	270245	270232	270232	I	0	” returned Caddy , smiling , “
270305	270340	270302	270303	the Sweeps	6074	” All this presented the art to me in a singular light , to be sure . Caddy enjoyed the effect of her communication , and cheerfully recounted the particulars of her own studies . “
270482	270528	270476	270476	Esther	305	” Saying these words , Caddy laughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano , and really rattled off a quadrille with great spirit . Then she good - humoredly and blushingly got up again , and while she still laughed herself , said , “
270543	270619	270539	270541	a dear girl	14258	” I would sooner have cried , but I did neither . I encouraged her , and praised her with all my heart . For I conscientiously believed , dancing - master 's wife though she was , and dancing - mistress though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a Mission . “
270623	270629	270630	270630	you	9060	” said Caddy , delighted , “
270698	271268	270662	270662	You	9060	” Her husband , who had left us while we had this chat , now coming back , preparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball - room , Caddy informed me she was quite at my disposal . But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her ; for I should have been vexed to take her away then . Therefore we three adjourned to the apprentices together , and I made one in the dance . The apprentices were the queerest little people . Besides the melancholy boy , who I hoped had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen , there were two other boys , and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress . Such a precocious little girl , with such a dowdy bonnet on ( that , too , of a gauzy texture ) , who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule . Such mean little boys , when they were not dancing , with string , and marbles , and cramp - bones in their pockets , and the most untidy legs and feet — and heels particularly . I asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for them ? Caddy said she did n't know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers ; perhaps for the stage . They were all people in humble circumstances , and the melancholy boy 's mother kept a ginger - beer shop . We danced for an hour with great gravity ; the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist . Caddy , while she was observant of her husband , and was evidently founded upon him , had acquired a grace and self - possession of her own , which , united to her pretty face and figure , was uncommonly agreeable . She already relieved him of much of the instruction of these young people ; and he seldom interfered , except to walk his part in the figure if he had anything to do in it . He always played the tune . The affectation of the gauzy child , and her condescension to the boys , was a sight . And thus we danced an hour by the clock . When the practice was concluded , Caddy 's husband made himself ready to go out of town to a school , and Caddy ran away to get ready to go out with me . I sat in the ball - room in the interval , contemplating the apprentices . The two out - door boys went upon the staircase to put on their half - boots , and pull the in - door boy 's hair : as I judged from the nature of his objections . Returning with their jackets buttoned , and their pumps stuck in them , they then produced packets of cold bread and meat , and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall . The little gauzy child , having whisked her sandals into the reticule and put on a trodden down pair of shoes , shook her head into the dowdy bonnet at one shake ; and answering my inquiry whether she liked dancing , by replying , “
271273	271284	271271	271271	boys	4327	” tied it across her chin and went home contemptuous . “
271292	271296	271271	271271	boys	4327	” said Caddy , “
271328	271353	271326	271326	Esther	305	” I expressed myself much obliged to him , but did not think it necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention . “
271363	271367	271326	271326	Esther	305	” said Caddy , “
271422	271456	271400	271400	He	490	” There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his Deportment on Mr. Jellyby , that quite took my fancy . I asked Caddy if he brought her papa out much ? “
271459	271463	271400	271400	He	490	” said Caddy , “
271564	271604	271535	271535	he	340	” That old Mr. Turveydrop should ever , in the chances and changes of life , have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola Gha , appeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of oddities . “
271609	271618	271607	271607	Peepy	330	” said Caddy , with a little hesitation , “
271712	271718	271699	271699	he	1026	” said Caddy , cheerily , “
271745	271746	271743	271743	Esther	305	” “
271753	271757	271743	271743	Esther	305	” said I ; “
271816	271817	271807	271814	the gentleman who brought us to your house	6099	” “
271834	272025	271822	271822	I	0	” returned Caddy . To the Old Street Road we went , and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy 's residence for Mrs. Guppy . Mrs. Guppy , occupying the parlors , and having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut in the front parlor door by peeping out before she was asked for , immediately presented herself , and requested us to walk in . She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over . Her close little sitting - room was prepared for a visit ; and there was a portrait of her son in it , which , I had almost written here , was more like than life : it insisted upon him with such obstinacy , and was so determined not to let him off . Not only was the portrait there , but we found the original there too . He was dressed in a great many colors , and was discovered at a table reading law - papers with his forefinger to his forehead . “
272029	272036	272026	272027	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Guppy , rising , “
272069	272142	272043	272043	Mother	11023	” Mrs. Guppy , whose incessant smiling gave her quite a waggish appearance , did as her son requested ; and then sat down in a corner , holding her pocket - handkerchief to her chest , like a fomentation , with both hands . I presented Caddy , and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome . I then proceeded to the object of my visit . “
272155	272215	272143	272143	I	0	” said I. Mr. Guppy acknowledged its receipt by taking it out of his breast pocket , putting it to his lips , and returning it to his pocket with a bow . Mr. Guppy 's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled , and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow . “
272226	272316	272217	272217	I	0	” said I. Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy 's mother now , I think I never saw . She made no sound of laughter ; but she rolled her head , and shook it , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and appealed to Caddy with her elbow , and her hand , and her shoulder , and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal Caddy through the little folding - door into her bed - room adjoining . “
272320	272325	272326	272326	you	305	” said Mr. Guppy , “
272358	272392	272342	272343	My mother	2309	” I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have turned so red , or changed so much , as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up my veil . “
272406	272410	272393	272393	I	0	” said I , “
272450	272478	272447	272448	Mr. Guppy	326	” I caused him embarrassment enough as it was , I am sure . I never saw such faltering , such confusion , such amazement and apprehension . “
272482	272487	272479	272480	Miss Summerson	305	” stammered Mr. Guppy , “
272536	272586	272522	272522	I	0	” Something seemed to rise in his throat that he could not possibly swallow . He put his hand there , coughed , made faces , tried again to swallow it , coughed again , made faces again , looked all round the room , and fluttered his papers . “
272600	272604	272598	272598	miss	9100	” he explained , “
272629	272666	272627	272627	George	562	” I gave him a little time to recover . He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him . “

273131	273154	273128	273129	Mr. Guppy	326	“ but we had better not travel out of the record into implication . I can not admit that I implied anything . ”

273166	273429	273163	273163	I	0	“ that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests , and promoting my fortunes , by making discoveries of which I should be the subject . I presume that you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an orphan girl , indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr. Jarndyce . Now , the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg of you is , Mr. Guppy , that you will have the kindness to relinquish all idea of so serving me . I have thought of this sometimes , and I have thought of it most , lately — since I have been ill . At length I have decided , in case you should at any time recal that purpose , and act upon it in any way , to come to you , and assure you that you are altogether mistaken . You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service , or give me the least pleasure . I am acquainted with my personal history ; and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means . You may , perhaps , have abandoned this project a long time . If so , excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble . If not , I entreat you , on the assurance I have given you , henceforth to lay it aside . I beg you to do this , for my peace . ”

Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling , and if I mistook any intentions on your part just now , I am prepared to tender a full apology . I should wish to be understood , miss , as hereby offering that apology — limiting it , as your own good sense and right feeling will point out the necessity of , to the present proceedings . ”

I come to you as privately as possible , because you announced this impression of yours to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect — and which I always have respected , as you remember . I have mentioned my illness . There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you , is quite removed . Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred ; and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me , to accede to it . ”

274174	274178	274180	274181	this gentleman	11090	” he murmured . “
274201	274202	274183	274185	Mr. William Guppy	326	” “
274208	274213	274206	274206	miss	9100	” said Mr. Guppy . “
274229	274234	274235	274236	Married woman	10291	” I gave them . “
274241	274246	274247	274248	Married woman	10291	” said Mr. Guppy . “
274288	274298	274251	274251	you	9060	” He ran home and came running back again . “
274342	274353	274364	274364	you	9060	” said Mr. Guppy to me , forlornly and despondently , “
274374	274407	274367	274367	I	0	” I replied it certainly could not . The subject did not admit of a doubt . He thanked me , and ran to his mother 's again — and back again . “
274421	274426	274415	274415	miss	9100	” said Mr. Guppy . “
274462	275182	274445	274445	you	9060	” The struggle in Mr. Guppy 's breast , and the numerous oscillations it occasioned him between his mother 's door and us , were sufficiently conspicuous in the windy street ( particularly as his hair wanted cutting ) , to make us hurry away . I did so with a lightened heart ; but when we last looked back , Mr. Guppy was still oscillating in the same troubled state of mind . THE name of MR . VHOLES , preceded by the legend GROUND FLOOR , is inscribed upon a doorpost in Symond 's Inn , Chancery Lane : a little , pale , wall - eyed , woe - begone inn , like a large dustbinn of two compartments and a sifter . It looks as if Symond were a sparing man in his day , and constructed his inn of old building materials , which took kindly to the dry rot and to dirt and all things decaying and dismal , and perpetuated Symond 's memory with congenial shabbiness . Quartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of Symond , are the legal bearings of Mr. Vholes . Mr. Vholes 's office , in disposition retiring and in situation retired , is squeezed up in a corner , and blinks at a dead wall . Three feet of knotty floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes 's jet black door , in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest midsummer morning , and encumbered by a black bulk - head of cellarage staircase , against which belated civilians generally strike their brows . Mr. Vholes 's chambers are on so small a scale , that one clerk can open the door without getting off his stool , while the other who elbows him at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire . A smell as of unwholesome sheep , blending with the smell of must and dust , is referable to the nightly ( and often daily ) consumption of mutton fat in candles , and to the fretting of parchment forms and skins in greasy drawers . The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close . The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man , and the two chimneys smoke , and there is a loose outer surface of soot everywhere , and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames have but one piece of character in them , which is a determination to be always dirty , and always shut , unless coerced . This accounts for the phenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of firewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather . Mr. Vholes is a very respectable man . He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man . He is allowed by the greater attorneys who have made good fortunes , or are making them , to be a most respectable man . He never misses a chance in his practice ; which is a mark of respectability . He never takes any pleasure ; which is another mark of respectability . He is reserved and serious ; which is another mark of respectability . His digestion is impaired , which is highly respectable . And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters . And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton . The one great principle of the English law is , to make business for itself . There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings . Viewed by this light it becomes a coherent scheme , and not the monstrous maze the laity are apt to think it . Let them but once clearly perceive that its grand principle is to make business for itself at their expense , and surely they will cease to grumble . But , not perceiving this quite plainly — only seeing it by halves in a confused way — the laity sometimes suffer in peace and pocket , with a bad grace , and do grumble very much . Then this respectability of Mr. Vholes is brought into powerful play against them . “
275191	275201	274445	274445	you	9060	” says Mr. Kenge , to a smarting client , “
275358	275388	275355	275356	Mr. Vholes	680	” The respectability of Mr. Vholes has even been cited with crushing effect before Parliamentary committees , as in the following blue minutes of a distinguished attorney 's evidence . “
275538	275546	275548	275548	Vholes	680	Answer”—which proved fatal to the enquiry for ten years—“Mr
275561	275825	275548	275548	Vholes	680	” So in familiar conversation , private authorities no less disinterested will remark that they do n't know what this age is coming to ; that we are plunging down precipices ; that now here is something else gone ; that these changes are death to people like Vholes : a man of undoubted respectability , with a father in the Vale of Taunton , and three daughters at home . Take a few steps more in this direction , say they , and what is to become of Vholes 's father ? Is he to perish ? And of Vholes 's daughters ? Are they to be shirt - makers , or governesses ? As though , Mr. Vholes and his relations being minor cannibal chiefs , and it being proposed to abolish cannibalism , indignant champions were to put the case thus : Make man - eating unlawful , and you starve the Vholeses ! In a word , Mr. Vholes , with his three daughters and his father in the Vale of Taunton , is continually doing duty , like a piece of timber , to shore up some decayed foundation that has become a pit - fall and a nuisance . And with a great many people , in a great many instances , the question is never one of a change from Wrong to Right ( which is quite an extraneous consideration ) , but is always one of injury or advantage to that eminently respectable legion , Vholes . The Chancellor is , within these ten minutes , “
275827	275979	275548	275548	Vholes	680	” for the long vacation . Mr. Vholes , and his young client , and several blue bags hastily stuffed , out of all regularity of form , as the larger sort of serpents are in their first gorged state , have returned to the official den . Mr. Vholes , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were skinning his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were scalping himself , and sits down at his desk . The client throws his hat and gloves upon the ground — tosses them anywhere , without looking after them or caring where they go ; flings himself into a chair , half sighing and half groaning ; rests his aching head upon his hand , and looks the portrait of Young Despair . “
275984	275988	275548	275548	Vholes	680	” says Richard . “
275994	275995	275548	275548	Vholes	680	” “
276004	276010	276002	276002	sir	9019	” returns the placid Vholes . “
276021	276022	276002	276002	sir	9019	” “
276029	276038	276002	276002	sir	9019	” says Richard , turning gloomily upon him . “
276047	276051	276002	276002	sir	9019	” returns Vholes . “
276066	276067	276002	276002	sir	9019	” “
276073	276125	276132	276132	sir	9019	” asks the moody client . Vholes , sitting with his arms on his desk , quietly bringing the tips of his five right fingers to meet the tips of his five left fingers , and quietly separating them again , and fixedly and slowly looking at his client , replies : “
276153	276154	276143	276144	Mr. Carstone	320	” “
276176	276192	276193	276194	Mr. C	677	” exclaims the young man , rising from his chair and walking about the room . “
276196	276210	276193	276194	Mr. C	677	” returns Vholes , following him close with his eyes wherever he goes , “
276263	276264	276265	276265	I	0	” “
276277	276303	276304	276304	Sir	9019	” says Richard , sitting down again with an impatient laugh , and beating the Devil 's Tattoo with his boot on the patternless carpet . “
276306	276337	276338	276338	Sir	9019	” returns Vholes , always looking at the client , as if he were making a lingering meal of him with his eyes as well as with his professional appetite . “
276340	276355	276338	276338	Sir	9019	” returns Vholes , with his inward manner of speech and his bloodless quietude ; “
276459	276460	276461	276462	Mr. Vholes	680	” “
276464	276472	276461	276462	Mr. Vholes	680	” explains the client , somewhat abashed , “
276483	276484	276485	276485	I	0	” “
276496	276502	276487	276487	you	9019	” returns the equable Vholes . “
276663	276722	276731	276731	you	9019	” Mr. Vholes , after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse 's hole , fixes his charmed gaze again on his young client , and proceeds in his buttoned - up half - audible voice , as if there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out : “
276886	276925	276884	276884	sir	9019	” Mr. Vholes gives it a rap , and it sounds as hollow as a coffin . Not to Richard , though . There is encouragement in the sound to him . Perhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is . “
276934	276945	276931	276932	Mr. Vholes	680	” says Richard , more familiarly and good - humouredly , “
277049	277050	277051	277051	You	0	” “
277054	277059	277051	277051	You	0	” says Mr. Vholes , “
277155	277156	277142	277142	I	0	” “
277159	277165	277142	277142	I	0	” returns Richard , brightening . “
277174	277175	277169	277169	you	0	” “
277184	277185	277186	277186	You	320	” “
277194	277195	277186	277186	You	320	” “
277200	277231	277186	277186	You	320	” says Mr. Vholes , gently shaking his head and rapping the hollow desk , with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes , and dust on dust , “
277320	277336	277337	277338	Mr. Vholes	680	” Richard , his face flushing suddenly , strikes the desk with his clenched hand . “
277481	277482	277515	277515	I	0	” “
277487	277491	277515	277515	I	0	” says Vholes . “
277519	277520	277515	277515	I	0	” “
277524	277530	277521	277522	Mr. Vholes	680	” returns the angry client . “
277549	277550	277539	277539	he	277	” “
277558	277569	277551	277551	He	277	” Mr. Vholes admits , with an appearance of reluctance . “
277600	277601	277602	277602	You	677	” “
277605	277609	277610	277610	I	0	” returns Richard . “
277615	277616	277612	277613	Mr. C	677	” “
277642	277660	277661	277662	Mr. C	677	” says Richard , accompanying his last three words with three raps on his rock of trust . “
277664	277678	277661	277662	Mr. C	677	” returns Vholes , immovable in attitude and never winking his hungry eyes , “
277796	277797	277793	277794	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
277804	277808	277793	277794	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” cries Richard . “
277817	277818	277809	277809	You	677	” “
277822	277826	277819	277820	Mr. C	677	” returns Vholes , “
278134	278147	278127	278127	I	0	” says Mr. Vholes , with the severity of a determined man , “
278269	278314	278355	278358	a man of capital	6227	” Vholes finally adds , by way of rider to this declaration of his principles , that as Mr. Carstone is about to rejoin his regiment , perhaps Mr. C will favor him with an order on his agent for twenty pounds on account . “
278329	278341	278327	278327	sir	9019	” observes Vholes , turning over the leaves of his Diary , “
278446	278456	278458	278458	your	9019	” Vholes gives the desk one hollow blow again , “
278468	278574	278424	278425	Mr. C	677	” The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved , and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft : not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent 's hands . All the while , Vholes , buttoned up in body and mind , looks at him attentively . All the while , Vholes 's official cat watches the mouse 's hole . Lastly , the client , shaking hands , beseeches Mr. Vholes , for Heaven 's sake and Earth 's sake , to do his utmost , to “
278578	278607	278424	278425	Mr. C	677	” the Court of Chancery . Mr. Vholes , who never gives hopes , lays his palm upon the client 's shoulder , and answers with a smile , “
278635	279229	279230	279230	William	326	” Thus they part ; and Vholes , left alone , employs himself in carrying sundry little matters out of his Diary into his draft bill book , for the ultimate behoof of his three daughters . So might an industrious fox , or bear , make up his account of chickens or stray travellers with an eye to his cubs ; not to disparage by that word the three raw - visaged , lank , and buttoned - up maidens , who dwell with the parent Vholes in an earthy cottage situated in a damp garden at Kennington . Richard , emerging from the heavy shade of Symond 's Inn into the sunshine of Chancery Lane — for there happens to be sunshine there to - day — walks thoughtfully on , and turns into Lincoln 's Inn , and passes under the shadow of the Lincoln 's Inn trees . On many such loungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen ; on the like bent head , the bitten nail , the lowering eye , the lingering step , the purposeless and dreamy air , the good consuming and consumed , the life turned sour . This lounger is not shabby yet , but that may come . Chancery , which knows no wisdom but in Precedent , is very rich in such Precedents ; and why should one be different from ten thousand ? Yet the time is so short since his depreciation began , that as he saunters away , reluctant to leave the spot for some long months together , though he hates it , Richard himself may feel his own case as if it were a startling one . While his heart is heavy with corroding care , suspense , distrust , and doubt , it may have room for some sorrowful wonder when he recals how different his first visit there , how different he , how different all the colors of his mind . But injustice breeds injustice ; the fighting with shadows and being defeated by them , necessitates the setting up of substances to combat ; from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand , the time for that being long gone by , it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin , and make him his enemy . Richard has told Vholes the truth . Is he in a hardened or a softened mood , he still lays his injuries equally at that door ; he was thwarted , in that quarter , of a set purpose , and that purpose could only originate in the one subject that is resolving his existence into itself ; besides , it is a justification to him in his own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor . Is Richard a monster in all this,—or would Chancery be found rich in such Precedents too , if they could be got for citation from the Recording Angel ? Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him , as , biting his nails and brooding , he crosses the square , and is swallowed up by the shadow of the southern gateway . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle are the possessors of those eyes , and they have been leaning in conversation against the low stone parapet under the trees . He passed close by them , seeing nothing but the ground . “
279232	279241	279230	279230	William	326	” says Mr. Weevle , adjusting his whiskers ; “
279265	279266	279275	279275	he	6235	” “
279269	279274	279275	279275	he	6235	” says Mr. Guppy , “
279346	279367	279368	279368	They	6241	” Mr. Guppy , refolding his arms , resettles himself against the parapet , as resuming a conversation of interest . “
279377	279382	279368	279368	They	6241	” says Mr. Guppy , “
279413	279414	279404	279404	they	6241	” “
279420	279421	279422	279422	Small	541	” “
279514	279515	279516	279516	You	0	” “
279524	279525	279526	279526	Tony	552	” “
279528	279537	279526	279526	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , a little disconcerted , “
279587	279596	279585	279585	Tony	552	” Mr. Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent ; “
279782	279798	279799	279799	Tony	552	” Mr. Weevle reflects for some time . Shakes his head . Decidedly thinks not . “
279801	279813	279799	279799	Tony	552	” says Mr. Guppy , as they walk towards the court , “
279938	280303	279923	279923	I	0	” Mr. Weevle nods . Mr. Guppy , much elevated in his own opinion by having delivered these observations , with an air in part forensic and in part romantic — this gentleman having a passion for conducting anything in the form of an examination , or delivering anything in the form of a summing up or a speech — accompanies his friend with dignity to the court . Never , since it has been a court , has it had such a Fortunatus 's purse of gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop . Regularly , every morning at eight , is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought down to the corner and carried in , accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed , Judy , and Bart ; and regularly , all day , do they all remain there until nine at night , solaced by gipsy dinners , not abundant in quantity , from the cook 's shop ; rummaging and searching , digging , delving , and diving among the treasures of the late lamented . What those treasures are , they keep so secret , that the court is maddened . In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of teapots , crown - pieces overflowing punch - bowls , old chairs and mattresses stuffed with Bank of England notes . It possesses itself of the sixpenny history ( with highly - coloured folding frontispiece ) of Mr. Daniel Dancer and his sister , and also of Mr. Elwes , of Suffolk , and transfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook . Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court assembles and pries into the baskets as they come forth . Many times the two gentlemen who write with the ravenous little pens on the tissue paper are seen prowling in the neighbourhood — shy of each other , their late partnership being dissolved . The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the prevailing interest through the Harmonic nights . Little Swills , in what are professionally known as “
280305	280321	279923	279923	I	0	” allusions to the subject , is received with loud applause ; and the same vocalist “
280323	280344	280345	280345	We	6257	” in the regular business like a man inspired . Even Miss M. Melvilleson , in the revived Caledonian melody of “
280351	280356	280345	280345	We	6257	” points the sentiment that “
280361	280742	280345	280345	We	6257	” ( whatever the nature of that refreshment may be ) with such archness , and such a turn of the head towards next door , that she is immediately understood to mean , Mr. Smallweed loves to find money , and is nightly honored with a double encore . For all this , the court discovers nothing ; and , as Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance is the signal for a general rally , it is in one continual ferment to discover everything , and more . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , with every eye in the court 's head upon them , knock at the closed door of the late lamented 's house , in a high state of popularity . But , being contrary to the court 's expectation admitted , they immediately become unpopular , and are considered to mean no good . The shutters are more or less closed all over the house , and the ground - floor is sufficiently dark to require candles . Introduced into the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger , they , fresh from the sunlight , can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows ; but they gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed , seated in his chair upon the brink of a well or grave of waste paper ; the virtuous Judy groping therein , like a female sexton ; and Mrs. Smallweed on the level ground in the vicinity , snowed up in a heap of paper fragments , print and manuscript , which would appear to be the accumulated compliments that have been sent flying at her in the course of the day . The whole party , Small included , are blackened with dust and dirt , and present a fiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room . There is more litter and lumber in it than of old , and it is dirtier if possible ; likewise , it is ghostly with traces of its dead inhabitant , and even with his chalked writing on the wall . On the entrance of visitors , Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously fold their arms , and stop in their researches . “
280745	280751	280345	280345	We	6257	” croaks the old gentleman . “
280832	280898	280903	280903	sir	9019	” Mr. Weevle , thanking him , casts an eye about . Mr. Guppy 's eye follows Mr. Weevle 's eye . Mr. Weevle 's eye comes back without any new intelligence in it . Mr. Guppy 's eye comes back , and meets Mr. Smallweed 's eye . That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring , like some wound - up instrument running down , “
280909	280942	280943	280943	Gentleman	5384	” And then having run down , he lapses into grinning silence , as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the darkness opposite , with his hands behind him . “
280953	280958	280943	280943	Gentleman	5384	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
280979	281029	280974	280974	he	6269	” Mr. Guppy slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn , who returns it with an easy nod . Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do , and were rather amused by the novelty . “
281043	281051	281037	281037	sir	9019	” Mr. Guppy observes to Mr. Smallweed . “
281109	281140	281099	281099	we	6273	” Mr. Smallweed has run down again ; while Mr. Weevle 's eye , attended by Mr. Guppy 's eye , has again gone round the room and come back . “
281145	281150	281143	281143	sir	9019	” says Mr. Weevle . “
281169	281170	281159	281159	you	9019	” “
281190	281288	281185	281185	yourself	4938	” As they go up - stairs , Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly , and looks at Tony . Tony shakes his head . They find the old room very dull and dismal , with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that memorable night yet in the discolored grate . They have a great disinclination to touch any object , and carefully blow the dust from it first . Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit : packing the few moveables with all possible speed , and never speaking above a whisper . “
281292	281298	281185	281185	yourself	4938	” says Tony , recoiling . “
281307	281315	281316	281316	Small	541	” Mr. Guppy retreats behind a chair . “
281403	281470	281471	281472	Mr. Guppy	326	” Lady Jane in the doorway , with her tiger - snarl from ear to ear , and her club of a tail , shows no intention of obeying ; but Mr. Tulkinghorn stumbling over her , she spits at his rusty legs , and swearing wrathfully , takes her arched back upstairs . Possibly to roam the housetops again , and return by the chimney . “
281474	281479	281471	281472	Mr. Guppy	326	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
281488	281519	281520	281520	Sir	9019	” Mr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty from the wall , and depositing those works of art in their old ignoble band - box . “
281522	281528	281520	281520	Sir	9019	” he returns , reddening , “
281602	281603	281579	281579	I	0	” “
281608	281613	281616	281616	sir	9019	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
281637	281638	281682	281683	Mr. Guppy	326	” “
281645	281661	281682	281683	Mr. Guppy	326	” Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the hearthstone to which he has quietly walked . “
281685	281704	281682	281683	Mr. Guppy	326	” He pauses here to smile , and his smile is as dull and rusty as his pantaloons . “
281723	281724	281721	281721	sir	9019	” “
281737	281738	281732	281732	I	0	” “
281775	281806	281807	281807	Sir	9019	” Mr. Guppy , looking as if he would give his own reddening and still reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of himself , replies , “
281883	281884	281877	281877	I	0	” “
281889	281890	281877	281877	I	0	” “
281900	281901	281892	281892	I	0	” “
281905	281915	281892	281892	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , with a calm nod . “
281937	281952	281935	281935	sir	9019	” He addresses this to the astounded Tony , who admits the soft impeachment . “
281962	281997	281935	281935	sir	9019	” observes Mr. Tulkingdom . He has been standing on the hearthstone , with his back to the smoked chimney - piece , and now turns round , with his glasses to his eyes . “
282034	282069	282070	282070	Tony	552	” When he has walked out , Mr. Guppy , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery , concluding with Lady Dedlock . “
282072	282081	282070	282070	Tony	552	” he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , “
282243	283696	283697	283697	She	6312	” This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic lunacy , while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair , and even in his cultivated whiskers . ENGLAND has been in a dreadful state for some weeks . Lord Coodle would go out , Sir Thomas Doodle would n't come in , and there being nobody in Great Britain ( to speak of ) except Coodle and Doodle , there has been no Government . It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men , which at one time seemed inevitable , did not come off ; because if both pistols had taken effect , and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other , it is to be presumed that England must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle , now in frocks and long stockings , were grown up . This stupendous national calamity , however , was averted by Lord Coodle 's making the timely discovery , that if in the heat of debate he had said that he scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle , he had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce him to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration ; while it as opportunely turned out , on the other hand , that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honor . Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot ( as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock ) to weather the storm ; and the marvellous part of the matter is , that England has not appeared to care very much about it , but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage , as the old world did in the days before the flood . But Coodle knew the danger , and Doodle knew the danger , and all their followers and hangers - on had the clearest possible perception of the danger . At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in , but has done it handsomely , bringing in with him all his nephews , all his male cousins , and all his brothers - in - law . So there is hope for the old ship yet . Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country — chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer . In this metamorphosed state he is available in a good many places simultaneously , and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time . Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns , and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer , and in swearing herself black in the face that she does neither — plainly to the advancement of her glory and morality — the London season comes to a sudden end , through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises . Hence Mrs. Rouncewell housekeeper at Chesney Wold foresees , though no instructions have yet come down , that the family may shortly be expected , together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work . And hence the stately old dame , taking Time by the forelock , leads him up and down the staircases , and along the galleries and passages and through the rooms , to witness before he grows any older that everything is ready ; that floors are rubbed bright , carpets spread , curtains shaken out , beds puffed and patted , still - room and kitchen cleared for action , all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity . This present summer evening , as the sun goes down , the preparations are complete . Dreary and solemn the old house looks , with so many appliances of habitation , and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls . So did these come and go , a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along ; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet , as I see it now ; so think , as I think , of the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone ; so find it , as I find it , difficult to believe that it could be , without them ; so pass from my world , as I pass from theirs , now closing the reverberating door ; so leave no blank to miss them , and so die . Through some of the fiery windows , beautiful from without , and set , at this sunset hour , not in dull grey stone but in a glorious house of gold , the light excluded at other windows pours in , rich , lavish , overflowing like the summer plenty in the land . Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw . Strange movements come upon their features , as the shadows of leaves play there . A dense Justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink . A staring Baronet , with a truncheon , gets a dimple in his chin . Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth , that would have done it good , a hundred years ago . One ancestress of Volumnia , in high - heeled shoes , very like her — casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries — shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint . A maid of honor of the court of Charles the Second , with large round eyes ( and other charms to correspond ) , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows . But the fire of the sun is dying . Even now the floor is dusky , and shadow slowly mounts the walls , bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death . And now , upon my lady 's picture over the great chimney - piece , a weird shade falls from some old tree , that turns it pale , and flutters it , and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood , watching an opportunity to draw it over her . Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall — now a red gloom on the ceiling — now the fire is out . All that prospect , which from the terrace looked so near , has moved solemnly away , and changed — not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change — into a distant phantom . Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air . Now , the woods settle into great masses as if they were each one profound tree . And now the moon rises , to separate them , and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems , and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken . Now , the moon is high ; and the great house , needing habitation more than ever , is like a body without life . Now , it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bed - rooms : to say nothing of the dead . Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a cavern , and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes , when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement , and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside . But , of all the shadows in Chesney Wold , the shadow in the long drawing - room upon my lady 's picture is the first to come , the last to be disturbed . At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up , and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs . “
283704	283716	283697	283697	She	6312	” says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell 's audience - chamber . “
283727	283728	283697	283697	She	6312	” “
283789	283790	283769	283770	My Lady	996	” “
283796	283805	283794	283794	Thomas	452	” rejoins the housekeeper , with proud complacency , “
283827	284370	283794	283794	Thomas	452	” Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject ; probably hints them , in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of his neck to his temples ; but he forbears to express them further , and retires to the servants ' hall to regale on cold meat - pie and ale . This groom is the pilot - fish before the nobler shark . Next evening , down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points in the compass . Thenceforth for some weeks , backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere . On these national occasions , Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful . A better man than the Honorable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner , there could not possibly be . Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins , to ride over to polling - booths and hustings here and there , and show themselves on the side of England , it would be hard to find . Volumnia is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honor of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance . On these national occasions , dancing may be a patriotic service ; and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about , for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country . My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests , and , being still unwell , rarely appears until late in the day . But , at all the dismal dinners , leaden lunches , basilisk balls , and other melancholy pageants , her mere appearance is a relief . As to Sir Leicester , he conceives it utterly impossible that any thing can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator . Daily the cousins trot through dust , and canter over roadside turf , away to hustings and polling - booths ( with leather gloves and hunting - whips for the counties , and kid gloves and riding - canes for the boroughs ) , and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner . Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life , present the appearance of being rather busy . Daily , Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the nation , from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her . “
284377	284386	283794	283794	Thomas	452	” says Miss Volumnia , clasping her hands . “
284391	284441	284442	284442	Volumnia	614	” The mighty business is nearly over by this time , and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more . Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing - room after dinner ; a bright particular star , surrounded by clouds of cousins . “
284444	284457	284442	284442	Volumnia	614	” replies Sir Leicester , who has a list in his hand , “
284463	284464	284458	284458	we	6324	” “
284468	284535	284536	284536	Volumnia	614	” Although it is summer weather , Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening . He takes his usual screened seat near it , and repeats , with much firmness and a little displeasure , as who should say , I am not a common man , and when I say tolerably , it must not be understood as a common expression ; “
284543	284544	284536	284536	Volumnia	614	” “
284554	284560	284563	284563	Volumnia	614	” Volumnia asserts with confidence . “
284583	284584	284576	284576	I	0	” “
284600	284628	284629	284631	A sensible woman	6326	” Volumnia 's finishing the sentence restores her to favor . Sir Leicester , with a gracious inclination of his head , seems to say to himself , “
284642	284717	284629	284631	A sensible woman	6326	” In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair Dedlock 's observation was superfluous : Sir Leicester , on these occasions , always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed . Two other little seats that belong to him , he treats as retail orders of less importance ; merely sending down the men , and signifying to the tradespeople , “
284741	284742	284743	284743	I	0	” “
284780	284781	284748	284748	Volumnia	614	” “
284788	284792	284748	284748	Volumnia	614	” says Volumnia . “
284795	284810	284748	284748	Volumnia	614	” proceeds Sir Leicester , glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans , “
284835	284868	284748	284748	Volumnia	614	” ( Note , by the way , that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites , and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites . ) “
284905	284920	285032	285032	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation , “
284927	284982	285032	285032	I	0	” If Volumnia have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent ; seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker , is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace . Howbeit , impelled by innocence , she asks , “
284986	284987	284988	284988	Volumnia	614	” “
284990	285000	284988	284988	Volumnia	614	” remonstrates Sir Leicester , with his utmost severity . “
285003	285004	285051	285051	you	614	” “
285016	285026	285009	285009	I	0	” cries Volumnia , with her favourite little scream . “
285038	285039	285032	285032	I	0	” “
285044	285049	285051	285051	you	614	” returns Sir Leicester , “
285058	285083	285051	285051	you	614	” Volumnia hastens to express her opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as traitors , and made to support the Party . “
285090	285101	285084	285084	I	0	” repeats Sir Leicester , unmindful of these mollifying sentiments , “
285169	285264	285265	285265	I	0	” Sir Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia , because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery ; and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High Court of Parliament , and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty - eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state . “
285268	285286	285265	285265	I	0	” observes Volumnia , having taken a little time to recover her spirits after her late castigation , “
285297	285298	285299	285299	I	0	” “
285304	285313	285265	285265	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , opening his eyes , “
285341	285637	285638	285638	He	6340	” Volumnia had thought he might have been employed . Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for ? Volumnia , abashed again , suggests , by Somebody — to advise and make arrangements . Sir Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of his assistance . Lady Dedlock , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned . A languid cousin with a moustache , in a state of extreme debility , now observes from his couch , that — man told him ya'as'dy that Tulkinghorn had gone down to t'that iron place t'give legal ' pinion 'bout something ; and that , contest being over t'day , ' twould be highly jawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should pear with news that Coodle man was floored . Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester , hereupon , that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived , and is taking dinner . My Lady turns her head inward for the moment , then looks out again as before . Volumnia is charmed to hear that her Delight is come . He is so original , such a stolid creature , such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling them ! Volumnia is persuaded that he must be a Freemason . Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short aprons , and is made a perfect Idol of , with candlesticks and trowels . These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner , while making a purse . “
285645	285649	285638	285638	He	6340	” she adds , “
285680	285714	285668	285668	I	0	” It may be the gathering gloom of evening , or it may be the darker gloom within herself , but a shade is on my Lady 's face , as if she thought “
285720	285721	285717	285717	he	6340	” “
285725	285730	285717	285717	he	6340	” says Sir Leicester , “
285752	285759	285743	285746	A very valuable person	6344	” The debilitated cousin supposes he is “
285765	285766	285767	285767	He	293	” “
285775	285780	285767	285767	He	293	” says Sir Leicester , “
285809	285822	285796	285796	he	293	” Every body starts . For a gun is fired close by . “
285830	285839	285796	285796	he	293	” cries Volumnia with her little withered scream . “
285843	285848	285796	285796	he	293	” says my Lady . “
285855	285868	285850	285850	they	6348	” Enter Mr. Tulkinghorn , followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles . “
285873	285878	285850	285850	they	6348	” says Sir Leicester , “
285893	285903	285887	285887	you	996	” On the contrary , my Lady prefers it . “
285906	285924	285887	285887	you	996	” O ! nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the dark ! “
285930	285935	285936	285936	Tulkinghorn	293	” says Sir Leicester . “
285948	286065	285945	285945	you	293	” Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances , renders his passing homage to my Lady , shakes Sir Leicester 's hand , and subsides into the chair proper to him when he has anything to communicate , on the opposite side of the Baronet 's little newspaper - table . Sir Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady , not being very well , will take cold at that open window . My Lady is obliged to him , but would rather sit there , for the air . Sir Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat . Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff . “
286068	286073	285945	285945	you	293	” says Sir Leicester . “
286080	286081	286140	286140	you	6352	” “
286113	286139	286140	286140	you	6352	” It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , no opinions . Therefore he says “
286141	286147	286148	286148	we	6353	” are beaten , and not “
286150	286186	286148	286148	we	6353	” Sir Leicester is majestically wroth . Volumnia never heard of such a thing . The debilitated cousin holds that it's — sort of thing that 's sure tapn slongs votes — giv'n — Mob . “
286194	286213	286191	286191	you	6352	” Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the fast increasing darkness , when there is silence again , “
286225	286226	286215	286215	they	6350	” “
286248	286253	286240	286240	he	1920	” observes Sir Leicester , “
286306	286307	286300	286300	I	0	” “
286310	286315	286300	286300	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
286331	286342	286349	286349	you	6352	” Sir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking . “
286362	286363	286352	286353	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” “
286367	286368	286352	286353	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” “
286371	286372	286352	286353	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” “
286416	286438	286410	286410	he	366	” It is evident to the whole company , though nobody can see him , that Sir Leicester is staring majestically . “
286445	286456	286440	286440	he	366	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , as a wind - up , “
286461	286462	286440	286440	he	366	” “
286469	286478	286440	286440	he	366	” repeats Sir Leicester , with awful politeness . “
286483	286484	286440	286440	he	366	” “
286500	286501	286502	286503	That son	6365	” “
286510	286511	286505	286505	He	6365	” “
286517	286540	286505	286505	He	6365	” says Sir Leicester , after a terrific pause , during which he has been heard to snort and felt to stare ; “
286587	286630	286631	286631	I	0	” General burst of cousinly indignation . Volumnia thinks it is really high time , you know , for somebody in power to step in and do something strong . Debilitated cousin thinks — Country 's going — DAYVLE — steeplechase pace . “
286634	286644	286631	286631	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , in a breathless condition , “
286672	286673	286668	286670	that young woman	3466	” “
286679	286694	286663	286663	me	0	” observes my Lady from her window , in a low but decided tone , “
286700	286701	286668	286670	that young woman	3466	” “
286708	286713	286668	286670	that young woman	3466	” returns Sir Leicester . “
286807	286818	286779	286779	You	996	” Sir Leicester adds , after a moment 's consideration , “
286827	286880	286779	286779	You	996	” These remarks he offers with his unvarying politeness and deference when he addresses himself to his wife . She merely moves her head in reply . The moon is rising ; and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen . “
286887	286892	286779	286779	You	996	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
286907	286908	286901	286901	their	9789	” “
286911	286918	286919	286919	I	0	” Sir Leicester doubts his hearing . “
286955	286956	286973	286974	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” “
286959	286966	286973	286974	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	” says Sir Leicester , tremulouslessly , “
286982	286983	286976	286976	You	0	” “
286989	286994	286995	286995	I	0	” returns the lawyer , “
287015	287047	287010	287011	Lady Dedlock	288	” Her head concedes it , and Volumnia is enchanted . A story ! O he is going to tell something at last ! A ghost in it , Volumnia hopes ? “
287055	287076	287010	287011	Lady Dedlock	288	” Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant , and repeats , with some little emphasis grafted upon his usual monotony , “
287130	287166	287117	287118	Lady Dedlock	288	” By the light of the fire , which is low , he can be seen looking towards the moonlight . By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be seen , perfectly still . “
287228	287234	287225	287226	Sir Leicester	290	” Sir Leicester condescendingly says , “
287240	287262	287225	287226	Sir Leicester	290	” implying that then she must have appeared of very considerable moral dimensions indeed , in the eyes of an ironmaster . “
287364	287395	287351	287351	she	11453	” By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight . By the moonlight , Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile , perfectly still . “
287617	287671	287609	287610	Lady Dedlock	288	” There are various opinions on the merits , more or less conflicting with Volumnia 's . That fair young creature can not believe there ever was any such lady , and rejects the whole history on the threshold . The majority incline to the debilitated cousin 's sentiment , which is in few words—“no
287679	288504	288505	288506	Lady Dedlock	288	” Sir Leicester generally refers back in his mind to Wat Tyler , and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own . There is not much conversation in all , for late hours have been kept at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began , and this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone . It is past ten , when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for candles . Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake , and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves , and rises , and comes forward to a table for a glass of water . Winking cousins , bat - like in the candle glare , crowd round to give it ; Volumnia ( always ready for something better if procurable ) takes another , a very mild sip of which contents her ; Lady Dedlock , graceful , self - possessed , looked after by admiring eyes , passes away slowly down the long perspective by the side of that Nymph , not at all improving her as a question of contrast . MR . TULKINGHORN arrives in his turret - room , a little breathed by the journey up , though leisurely performed . There is an expression on his face as if he had discharged his mind of some grave matter , and were , in his close way , satisfied . To say of a man so severely and strictly self - repressed that he is triumphant , would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment , or any romantic weakness . He is sedately satisfied . Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him , as he loosely grasps one of his veinous wrists with his other hand , and holding it behind his back walks noiselessly up and down . There is a capacious writing - table in the room , on which is a pretty large accumulation of papers . The green lamp is lighted , his reading - glasses lie upon the desk , the easy chair is wheeled up to it , and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed . But he happens not to be in a business mind . After a glance at the documents awaiting his notice — with his head bent low over the table , the old man 's sight for print or writing being defective at night — he opens the french window and steps out upon the leads . There he again walks slowly up and down , in the same attitude ; subsiding , if a man so cool may have any need to subside , from the story he has related down - stairs . The time was once , when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on turret - tops in the star - light , and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there . Hosts of stars are visible to - night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendor of the moon . If he be seeking his own star , as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below . If he be tracing out his destiny , that may be written in other characters nearer to his hand . As he paces the leads , with his eyes most probably as high above his thoughts as they are high above the earth , he is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet his own . The ceiling of his room is rather low ; and the upper part of the door , which is opposite the window , is of glass . There is an inner baize door too , but the night being warm he did not close it when he came up - stairs . These eyes that meet his own , are looking in through the glass from the corridor outside . He knows them well . The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year , as when he recognises Lady Dedlock . He steps into the room , and she comes in too , closing both the doors behind her . There is a wild disturbance — is it fear or anger?—in her eyes . In her carriage and all else , she looks as she looked down - stairs two hours ago . Is it fear , or is it anger , now ? He can not be sure . Both might be as pale , both as intent . “
288508	288541	288505	288506	Lady Dedlock	288	” She does not speak at first , nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy chair by the table . They look at each other , like two pictures . “
288553	288554	288544	288544	you	288	” “
288571	288572	288567	288567	I	0	” “
288580	288581	288576	288576	you	288	” “
288598	288599	288576	288576	you	288	” “
288602	288603	288576	288576	you	288	” “
288606	288685	288576	288576	you	288	” He stands before her , with one hand on a chair - back and the other in his old - fashioned waistcoat and shirt - frill , exactly as he has stood before her at any time since her marriage . The same formal politeness , the same composed deference that might as well be defiance ; the whole man the same dark , cold object , at the same distance , which nothing has ever diminished . “
288694	288710	288711	288711	You	288	” He slightly inclines and advances his head , as not quite understanding the question . “
288749	288808	288811	288812	Lady Dedlock	288	” So ! Anger , and fear , and shame . All three contending . What power this woman has , to keep these raging passions down ! Mr. Tulkinghorn 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair's - breadth more contracted than usual , under her gaze . “
288851	288852	288844	288844	they	6407	” “
288861	288862	288854	288854	they	6407	” “
288865	288866	288854	288854	they	6407	” “
288880	288881	288868	288868	I	0	” “
288887	288892	288868	288868	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , “
288904	288925	288893	288893	I	0	” And he thinks , with the interest of attentive curiosity , as he watches the struggle in her breast , “
288936	288937	288938	288938	Sir	9019	” “
288940	288964	288938	288938	Sir	9019	” she says , for the moment obliged to set her lips with all the energy she has , that she may speak distinguish “
289100	289126	289127	289127	You	6412	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , profoundly attentive , throws this off with a shrug of self - depreciation , and contracts his eyebrows a little more . “
289207	289230	289231	289231	I	0	” And she would do it ! thinks the lawyer , watchful of the firm hand with which she takes the pen ! “
289244	289245	289242	289242	yourself	6412	” “
289286	289287	289288	289289	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
289313	289432	289298	289298	I	0	” Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window . Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one . The narrow one ! Where are the digger and the spade , this peaceful night , destined to add the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn existence ? Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ? Curious questions to consider , more curious perhaps not to consider , under the watching stars upon a summer night . “
289444	289450	289451	289451	I	0	” Lady Dedlock presently proceeds , “
289480	289500	289477	289477	your	6412	” He makes a feint of offering a protest , but she sweeps it away with her disdainful hand . “
289597	289598	289589	289589	I	0	” “
289605	289613	289602	289603	Lady Dedlock	288	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , quite unmoved . “
289627	289628	289623	289623	You	6412	” “
289649	289684	289644	289644	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes his head . She rises ; but he , without removing hand from chair - back or from old - fashioned waistcoat and shirt - frill , shakes his head . “
289694	289695	289690	289690	I	0	” “
289701	289707	289698	289699	Lady Dedlock	288	” he very calmly replies . “
289740	289741	289744	289745	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
289752	289789	289744	289745	Lady Dedlock	288	” Without deigning to rejoin , she moves to the inner door and has it in her hand , when he says to her , without himself stirring hand or foot , or raising his voice : “
289841	289900	289908	289909	Lady Dedlock	288	” He has conquered her . She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head . Slight tokens these in any one else ; but when so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn 's sees indecision for a moment in such a subject , he thoroughly knows its value . He promptly says again , “
289911	289936	289908	289909	Lady Dedlock	288	” and motions to the chair from which she has risen . She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down . “
290007	290008	290009	290009	Sir	9019	” “
290011	290030	290009	290009	Sir	9019	” she returns , without looking up from the ground , on which her eyes are now fixed . “
290056	290057	290049	290049	I	0	” “
290073	290074	290061	290062	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
290094	290195	290086	290086	I	0	” His jealous glance as she walks that way , betrays an instant 's misgiving that she may have it in her thoughts to leap over , and dashing against ledge and cornice , strike her life out upon the terrace below . But , a moment 's observation of her figure as she stands in the window without any support , looking out at the stars — not up — gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens — reassures him . By facing round as she has moved , he stands a little behind her . “
290266	290276	290261	290261	I	0	” He pauses , but she makes no reply . “
290297	290298	290299	290299	I	0	” “
290302	290303	290299	290299	I	0	” “
290365	290366	290362	290363	Sir Leicester	290	” “
290370	290389	290391	290391	you	0	” she asks in a low voice , and without removing her gloomy look from those distant stars , “
290398	290399	290391	290391	you	0	” “
290460	290486	290487	290487	I	0	” She breathes quickly and heavily , but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company . “
290591	290592	290594	290594	my	0	” “
290597	290601	290594	290594	my	0	” she returned . “
290607	290608	290609	290609	Your	288	” “
290654	290670	290702	290703	Sir Leicester	290	” There is a quiet decision in his reply , which admits of no remonstrance . “
290711	290718	290728	290729	Lady Dedlock	288	” Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here ; “
290733	290734	290728	290729	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
290738	290739	290728	290729	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
290742	290757	290758	290758	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , pursuing his case in his jog - trot style , “
290886	290904	290883	290884	your husband	2141	” He gets plainer as he gets on , but not an atom more emphatic or animated . “
290912	290916	290883	290884	your husband	2141	” he continues , “
291005	291035	291036	291036	My	0	” She stands looking out at the same stars , without a word . They are beginning to pale , and she looks as if their coldness froze her . “
291041	291074	291075	291075	My	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who has by this time got his hands in his pockets , and is going on in his business consideration of the matter , like a machine . “
291160	291161	291162	291162	I	0	” “
291182	291193	291162	291162	I	0	” she asks , still looking at the distant sky . “
291204	291205	291201	291202	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
291223	291224	291225	291225	I	0	” “
291235	291236	291237	291237	I	0	” “
291270	291275	291265	291265	you	288	” she says slowly . “
291292	291315	291283	291283	I	0	” She asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory , or calling them over in her sleep . “
291323	291324	291283	291283	I	0	” “
291333	291334	291283	291283	I	0	” “
291351	291352	291344	291344	I	0	” “
291419	291436	291409	291409	I	0	” She stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time , before asking : “
291448	291449	291409	291409	I	0	” “
291452	291465	291466	291466	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically , as he softly rubs his hands , “
291482	291483	291479	291480	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
291491	291492	291484	291484	You	288	” “
291581	291582	291583	291583	I	0	” “
291591	292403	291583	291583	I	0	” Both before and after saying it , she remains absorbed ; but at length moves , and turns , unshaken in her natural and acquired presence , towards the door . Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old - fashioned bow as she passes out . It is not an ordinary look that he receives from the handsome face as it goes into the darkness , and it is not an ordinary movement , though a very slight one , that acknowledges his courtesy . But , as he reflects when he is left alone , the woman has been putting no common constraint upon herself . He would know it all the better , if he saw the woman pacing her own rooms with her hair wildly thrown from her flung back face , her hands clasped behind her head , her figure twisted as if by pain . He would think so all the more , if he saw the woman thus hurrying up and down for hours , without fatigue , without intermission , followed by the faithful step upon the Ghost 's Walk . But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window - curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep . And truly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the turret chamber , finding him at his oldest , he looks as if the digger and the spade were both commissioned , and would soon be digging . The same wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant country in a majestically condescending dream ; and at the cousins entering on various public employments , principally receipt of salary ; and at the chaste Volumnia , bestowing a dower of fifty thousand pounds upon a hideous old General , with a mouth of false teeth like a pianoforte too full of keys , long the admiration of Bath and the terror of every other community . Also into rooms high in the roof , and into offices in courtyards and over stables , where humbler ambition dreams of bliss in keeper 's lodges , and in holy matrimony with Will or Sally . Up comes the bright sun , drawing everything up with it — the Wills and Sallys , the latent vapor in the earth , the drooping leaves and flowers , the birds and beasts and creeping things , the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold emerald velvet where the roller passes , the smoke of the great kitchen fire wreathing itself straight and high into the lightsome air . Lastly , up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn 's unconscious head , cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are in their happy home , and that there is hospitality at the place in Lincolnshire . FROM the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock property , Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and dust of London . His manner of coming and going between the two places , is one of his impenetrabilities . He walks into Chesney Wold as if it were next door to his chambers , and returns to his chambers as if he had never been out of Lincoln 's Inn Fields . He neither changes his dress before the journey , nor talks of it afterwards . He melted out of his turret - room this morning , just as now , in the late twilight , he melts into his own square . Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant fields , where the sheep are all made into parchment , the goats into wigs , and the pasture into chaff , the lawyer smoke - dried and faded , dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them , aged without experience of genial youth , and so long used to make his cramped nest in holes and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its broader and better range , comes sauntering home . In the oven made by the hot pavements and hot buildings , he has baked himself dryer than usual ; and he has , in his thirsty mind , his mellowed port - wine half a century old . The lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn 's side of the Fields , when that high - priest of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court - yard . He ascends the door - steps and is gliding into the dusky hall , when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man . “

292541	292552	292490	292490	you	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby , in a mysterious low voice : “
292572	292581	292582	292583	What foreigner	6448	” Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes him with some surprise . “

292932	292937	292929	292929	you	9019	” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
292942	292947	292940	292940	sir	9019	” returns Mr. Snagsby ; “

293501	293532	293533	293534	These women	6486	” Mr. Snagsby , with much bowing and short apologetic coughing , takes his leave , lightened in heart . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up - stairs , saying to himself , “
293572	293714	293562	293562	I	0	” So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him . It is too dark to see much of allegory over - head there ; but that importunate Roman , who is for ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing , is at his old work pretty distinctly . Not honoring him with much attention , Mr. Tulkinghorn takes a small key from his pocket , unlocks a drawer in which there is another key , which unlocks a chest in which there is another , and so comes to the cellar - key , with which he prepares to descend to the regions of old wine . He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand , when a knock comes . “
293752	293814	293749	293749	you	6490	” He stands the candle on the chimney - piece in the clerks ' hall , and taps his dry cheek with the key , as he addresses these words of welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense . That feline personage , with her lips tightly shut , and her eyes looking out at him sideways , softly closes the door before replying . “
293828	293829	293815	293815	I	0	” “
293833	293834	293815	293815	I	0	” “
293874	293875	293868	293868	he	6494	” “
293883	293884	293868	293868	he	6494	” “
293890	293961	293964	293964	mistress	6490	” At times , there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it , that such subject involuntarily starts and falls back . It is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's case at present , though Mademoiselle Hortense , with her eyes almost shut up ( but still looking , out sideways ) , is only smiling contemptuously and shaking her head . “
293966	293981	293964	293964	mistress	6490	” says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney - piece . “
293995	293996	293997	293997	Sir	9019	” “
294013	294014	294006	294006	You	9019	” “
294021	294033	294006	294006	You	9019	” returns the lawyer , rubbing his nose with the key . “
294101	294108	294109	294109	You	9019	” Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring . “
294117	294135	294109	294109	You	9019	” Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to meditate , as he looks distrustfully at her ; then he replies , “
294146	294147	294148	294148	You	9019	” “
294152	294160	294148	294148	You	9019	” she repeats , with fierce disdain . “
294188	294238	294182	294182	I	0	” Which she literally does , taking them out of her bosom as she speaks , and flinging them with such violence on the floor , that they jerk up again into the light before they roll away into corners , and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently . “
294241	294252	294253	294253	You	9019	” says Mademoiselle Hortense , darkening her large eyes again . “
294265	294284	294259	294260	my God	13098	” Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key , while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh . “
294294	294299	294285	294285	You	0	” he composedly observes , “
294308	294309	294310	294310	I	0	” “
294314	294318	294310	294310	I	0	” she returns , “
294340	294341	294336	294336	You	9019	” “
294351	294352	294354	294354	you	9019	” “
294388	294424	294376	294376	I	0	” It appears impossible for Mademoiselle to roll the letter r sufficiently in this word , notwithstanding that she assists her energetic delivery , by clenching both her hands , and setting all her teeth . “
294434	294446	294432	294432	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , examining the wards of the key . “
294478	294498	294472	294472	I	0	” Mademoiselle Hortense folds her arms , and throws this last remark at him over one of her shoulders . “
294512	294513	294504	294504	you	9019	” “
294584	294585	294586	294586	You	9019	” “
294594	294599	294586	294586	You	9019	” Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts . “
294648	294657	294642	294643	my God	13098	” In this reply , down to the word “
294659	294702	294642	294643	my God	13098	” inclusive , Mademoiselle has been ironically polite and tender ; then , has suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant scorn , with her black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly shut , and staringly wide open . “
294709	294727	294642	294643	my God	13098	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , tapping his chin with the key , and looking imperturbably at her , “
294733	294734	294642	294643	my God	13098	” “
294741	294755	294738	294738	us	6510	” Mademoiselle assents , with many angry and tight nods of her head . “
294783	294784	294778	294778	you	9019	” “
294788	294799	294778	294778	you	9019	” says Mademoiselle , with more tight and angry nods . “
294819	294820	294778	294778	you	9019	” “
294850	294851	294844	294844	you	9019	” “
294855	294863	294844	294844	you	9019	” repeats Mademoiselle , cataleptic with determination . “
294883	294884	294844	294844	you	9019	” “
294924	294942	294908	294908	I	0	” She merely throws a laugh over her shoulder , and stands her ground with folded arms . “
294949	294950	294908	294908	I	0	” “
294957	294958	294908	294908	I	0	” “
295069	295070	295066	295066	you	9019	” “
295074	295089	295071	295071	I	0	” Mademoiselle replies , without any action , and in a clear obliging voice , “
295097	295098	295071	295071	I	0	” “
295101	295111	295071	295071	I	0	” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn , quietly blowing his nose . “
295132	295133	295123	295123	I	0	” “
295143	295144	295151	295151	mistress	6490	” “
295153	295169	295151	295151	mistress	6490	” says the lawyer , deliberately putting away his handkerchief , and adjusting his frill , “
295240	295247	295238	295238	mistress	6490	” Illustrating with the cellar key . “
295250	295260	295238	295238	mistress	6490	” returns Mademoiselle , in the same pleasant voice . “
295276	295277	295278	295278	My	0	” “
295282	295287	295278	295278	My	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
295304	295305	295300	295300	you	6504	” “
295318	295319	295309	295309	you	0	” “
295322	295361	295309	295309	you	0	” It would be contradictory for one in Mademoiselle 's state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth , otherwise a tigerish expansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make her do it . “
295368	295373	295366	295366	mistress	6490	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
295432	295433	295434	295434	I	0	” “
295439	295448	295434	295434	I	0	” whispers Mademoiselle , stretching out her hand , “
295459	295460	295449	295449	I	0	” “
295464	295473	295474	295474	I	0	” pursues the lawyer , without minding her , “
295501	295502	295503	295503	I	0	” “
295508	295516	295503	295503	I	0	” repeats Mademoiselle in her former whisper . “
295520	295530	295531	295531	you	6490	” proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , “
295545	295546	295548	295548	you	0	” “
295550	295554	295548	295548	you	0	” she answers , “
295560	295561	295548	295548	you	0	” “
295572	295584	295569	295569	you	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn observes , following her out upon the staircase , “
296166	296174	296175	296175	he	9683	“ Rick is mistaken , my dear , ”
296181	296208	296175	296175	he	9683	“ Well , well ! we have all been mistaken over and over again . We must trust to you and time to set him right . ”
296399	296408	296410	296411	my guardian	9683	“ So that it is even more mischievous , ”
296416	296431	296410	296411	my guardian	9683	“ to remonstrate with the poor dear fellow , than to leave him alone . ”
296452	296455	296457	296458	my guardian	9683	“ Adviser ? ”
296462	296472	296457	296458	my guardian	9683	“ My dear , who would advise with Skimpole ? ”
296473	296483	296485	296485	I.	0	“ Encourager would perhaps have been a better word , ”
296486	296489	296491	296492	my guardian	9683	“ Encourager ! ”
296495	296503	296491	296492	my guardian	9683	“ Who could be encouraged by Skimpole ? ”
296504	296508	296509	296509	I	0	“ Not Richard ? ”
296512	296515	296516	296516	he	9683	“ No , ”
296519	296571	296516	296516	he	9683	“ Such an unworldly , uncalculating , gossamer creature , is a relief to him , and an amusement . But as to advising or encouraging , or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything , it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole . ”
296572	296578	296580	296580	Ada	681	“ Pray , cousin John , ”
296595	296603	296580	296580	Ada	681	“ what made him such a child ? ”
296604	296612	296614	296615	my guardian	9683	“ What made him such a child ? ”
296627	296633	296614	296615	my guardian	9683	“ Yes , cousin John . ”
296634	296637	296638	296638	he	9683	“ Why , ”
296649	296725	296727	296728	my guardian	9683	“ he is all sentiment , and — and susceptibility , and — and sensibility — and — and imagination . And these qualities are not regulated in him , somehow . I suppose the people who admired him for them in his youth , attached too much importance to them , and too little to any training that would have balanced and adjusted them ; and so he became what he is . Hey ? ”
296739	296748	296749	296749	Ada	681	“ What do you think , you two ? ”
296770	296779	296756	296756	she	681	“ So it is , so it is , ”
296786	296807	296756	296756	she	681	“ That must not be . We must arrange that . I must prevent it . That will never do . ”
296835	296839	296851	296851	his	9683	“ Did he ? ”
296854	296934	296851	296851	his	9683	“ But there you have the man . There you have the man ! There is nothing mercenary in that , with him . He has no idea of the value of money . He introduces Rick ; and then he is good friends with Mr. Vholes , and borrows five pounds of him . He means nothing by it , and thinks nothing of it . He told you himself , I 'll be bound , my dear ? ”
296935	296939	296941	296941	I.	6573	“ O yes ! ”
296942	296945	296947	296948	my guardian	9683	“ Exactly ! ”
296953	297043	296947	296948	my guardian	9683	“ There you have the man ! If he had meant any harm by it , or was conscious of any harm in it , he would n't tell it . He tells it as he does it , in mere simplicity . But you shall see him in his own home , and then you 'll understand him better . We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole , and caution him on these points . Lord bless you , my dears , an infant , an infant ! ”
297571	297579	297580	297580	he	358	“ Here I am , you see ! ”
297603	297678	297580	297580	he	358	“ Here I am ! This is my frugal breakfast . Some men want legs of beef and mutton for breakfast ; I do n't . Give me my peach , my cup of coffee , and my claret ; I am content . I do n't want them for themselves , but they remind me of the sun . There 's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton . Mere animal satisfaction ! ”
297679	297704	297706	297707	my guardian	9683	“ This is our friend 's consulting room ( or would be , if he ever prescribed ) , his sanctum , his studio , ”
297711	297714	297716	297717	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Yes , ”
297725	297762	297763	297763	He	358	“ this is the bird 's cage . This is where the bird lives and sings . They pluck his feathers now and then , and clip his wings ; but he sings , he sings ! ”
297775	297789	297763	297763	He	358	“ he sings ! Not an ambitious note , but still he sings . ”
297790	297796	297798	297799	my guardian	9683	“ These are very fine , ”
297801	297805	297798	297799	my guardian	9683	“ A present ? ”
297806	297809	297810	297810	he	358	“ No , ”
297813	297879	297880	297880	My	0	“ No ! Some amiable gardener sells them . His man wanted to know , when he brought them last evening , whether he should wait for the money . ‘ Really , my friend , ’ I said , ‘ I think not — if your time is of any value to you . ’ I suppose it was , for he went away . ”
297895	297906	297891	297891	he	358	“ is it possible to be worldly with this baby ? ”
297907	297913	297915	297916	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ This is a day , ”
297927	297990	297991	297991	He	358	“ that will ever be remembered here . We shall call it the Saint Clare and Saint Summerson day . You must see my daughters . I have a blue - eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter , I have a Sentiment daughter , and I have a Comedy daughter . You must see them all . They 'll be enchanted . ”
298022	298027	298028	298028	he	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
298038	298098	298028	298028	he	358	“ as many moments as you please . Time is no object here . We never know what o'clock it is , and we never care . Not the way to get on in life , you 'll tell me ? Certainly . But we do n't get on in life . We do n't pretend to do it . ”
298109	298114	298099	298100	My guardian	9683	“ You hear him ? ”
298115	298119	298120	298120	he	358	“ Now Harold , ”
298123	298135	298120	298120	he	358	“ the word I have to say , relates to Rick . ”
298136	298143	298145	298146	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ The dearest friend I have ! ”
298150	298210	298145	298146	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ I suppose he ought not to be my dearest friend , as he is not on terms with you . But he is , I ca n't help it ; he is full of youthful poetry , and I love him . If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it . I love him . ”
298242	298255	298257	298258	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ You are welcome to love him as much as you like , ”
298260	298270	298257	298258	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ but we must save his pocket , Harold . ”
298271	298274	298276	298277	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ Oh ! ”
298279	298295	298276	298277	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ His pocket ? Now , you are coming to what I do n't understand . ”
298335	298345	298311	298311	he	358	“ If you go with him here or there , ”
298352	298362	298311	298311	he	358	“ you must not let him pay for both . ”
298363	298368	298370	298371	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
298384	298515	298373	298373	his	358	“ what am I to do ? If he takes me anywhere , I must go . And how can I pay ? I never have any money . If I had any money , I do n't know anything about it . Suppose I say to a man , how much ? Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence ? I know nothing about seven and sixpence . It is impossible for me to pursue the subject , with any consideration for the man . I do n't go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish — which I do n't understand . Why should I go about asking them what seven and sixpence is in Money — which I do n't understand ? ”
298516	298519	298521	298522	my guardian	9683	“ Well , ”
298533	298570	298521	298522	my guardian	9683	“ if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick , you must borrow the money of me ( never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance ) , and leave the calculation to him . ”
298571	298576	298578	298579	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear Jarndyce , ”
298581	298670	298578	298579	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form — a superstition . Besides , I give you my word , Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson , I thought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich . I thought he had only to make over something , or to sign a bond , or a draft , or a cheque , or a bill , or to put something on a file somewhere , to bring down a shower of money . ”
298671	298680	298682	298682	Ada	319	“ Indeed it is not so , sir , ”
298684	298689	298682	298682	Ada	319	“ He is poor . ”
298690	298695	298697	298698	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ No , really ? ”
298705	298710	298701	298701	his	358	“ you surprise me . ”
298711	298724	298730	298730	his	9683	“ And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed , ”
298744	298759	298730	298730	his	9683	“ be you very careful not to encourage him in that reliance , Harold . ”
298760	298766	298768	298769	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dear good friend , ”
298771	298857	298768	298769	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ and my dear Miss Summerson , and my dear Miss Clare , how can I do that ? It 's business , and I do n't know business . It is he who encourages me . He emerges from great feats of business , presents the brightest prospects before me as their result , and calls upon me to admire them . I do admire them — as bright prospects . But I know no more about them , and I tell him so . ”
299079	299082	299084	299085	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ This , ”
299087	299160	299084	299085	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ is my Beauty daughter , Arethusa — plays and sings odds and ends like her father . This is my Sentiment daughter , Laura — plays a little but do n't sing . This is my Comedy daughter , Kitty — sings a little but do n't play . We all draw a little , and compose a little , and none of us have any idea of time or money . ”
299209	299214	299216	299217	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ It is pleasant , ”

299283	299291	299293	299294	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ My dears , it is true , ”
299296	299453	299293	299294	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ is it not ? So it is , and so it must be , because , like the dogs in the hymn , ‘ it is our nature to . ’ Now , here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity , and a knowledge of details perfectly surprising . It will sound very strange in Miss Summerson 's ears , I dare say , that we know nothing about chops in this house . But we do n't ; not the least . We ca n't cook anything whatever . A needle and thread we do n't know how to use . We admire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want ; but we do n't quarrel with them . Then why should they quarrel with us ? Live , and let live , we say to them . Live upon your practical wisdom , and let us live upon you ! ”
299474	299482	299484	299485	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ We have sympathy , my roses , ”
299487	299496	299484	299485	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ sympathy for everything . Have we not ? ”
299497	299503	299505	299507	the three daughters	6616	“ O yes , papa ! ”
299509	299519	299521	299522	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ In fact , that is our family department , ”
299524	299680	299521	299522	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ in this hurly - burly of life . We are capable of looking on and of being interested , and we do look on , and we are interested . What more can we do ! Here is my Beauty daughter , married these three years . Now , I dare say her marrying another child , and having two more , was all wrong in point of political economy ; but it was very agreeable . We had our little festivities on those occasions , and exchanged social ideas . She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young fledgelings have their nest up - stairs . I dare say , at some time or other , Sentiment and Comedy will bring their husbands home , and have their nests up - stairs too . So we get on ; we do n't know how , but somehow . ”
299905	299909	299910	299910	he	313	“ My roses , ”
299918	299974	299910	299910	he	313	“ take care of mamma . She is poorly to - day . By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two , I shall hear the larks sing , and preserve my amiability . It has been tried , you know , and would be tried again if I remained at home . ”
299975	299980	299982	299984	the Comedy daughter	6614	“ That bad man ! ”
299986	300010	300011	300011	Laura	482	“ At the very time when he knew papa was lying down by his wall - flowers , looking at the blue sky , ”

300030	300041	300028	300028	Arethusa	702	“ It showed a want of poetry in the man , ”
300053	300078	300079	300079	he	358	“ It was coarse . There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it ! My daughters have taken great offence , ”
300084	300090	300079	300079	he	358	“ at an honest man — ”
300091	300099	300100	300100	they	6630	“ Not honest , Papa . Impossible ! ”
300105	300123	300125	300126	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ At a rough kind of fellow — a sort of human hedge - hog rolled up , ”
300128	300454	300456	300457	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ who is a baker in this neighbourhood , and from whom we borrowed a couple of arm - chairs . We wanted a couple of arm - chairs , and we had n't got them , and therefore of course we looked to a man who had got them , to lend them . Well ! this morose person lent them , and we wore them out . When they were worn out , he wanted them back . He had them back . He was contented , you will say . Not at all . He objected to their being worn . I reasoned with him , and pointed out his mistake . I said , ‘ Can you , at your time of life , be so headstrong , my friend , as to persist that an arm - chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at ? That it is an object to contemplate , to survey from a distance , to consider from a point of sight ? Do n't you know that these arm - chairs were borrowed to be sat upon ? ’ He was unreasonable and unpersuadable , and used intemperate language . Being as patient as I am at this minute , I addressed another appeal to him . I said , ‘ Now , my good man , however our business capacities may vary , we are all children of one great mother , Nature . On this blooming summer morning here you see me ’ ( I was on the sofa ) ‘ with flowers before me , fruit upon the table , the cloudless sky above me , the air full of fragrance , contemplating Nature . I entreat you , by our common brotherhood , not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime , the absurd figure of an angry baker ! ’ But he did , ”
300467	300506	300456	300457	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ he did interpose that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again . And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way , and to go home with my friend Jarndyce . ”
300887	300892	300893	300894	The visitor	9886	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock ! ”
300985	300993	300971	300972	my guardian	9683	“ Pray be seated , Sir Leicester . ”
300994	300998	301000	301001	Sir Leicester	290	“ Mr. Jarndyce , ”
301012	301022	301000	301001	Sir Leicester	290	“ I do myself the honor of calling here — ”
301023	301033	300971	300972	my guardian	9683	“ You do me the honor , Sir Leicester . ”
301034	301127	300971	300972	my guardian	9683	“ Thank you — of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire , to express my regret that any cause of complaint , however strong , that I may have against a gentleman who — who is known to you and has been your host , and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference , should have prevented you , still more ladies under your escort and charge , from seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and refined taste , at my house , Chesney Wold . ”
301128	301158	300971	300972	my guardian	9683	“ You are exceedingly obliging , Sir Leicester , and on behalf of those ladies ( who are present ) and for myself , I thank you very much . ”
301159	301269	301270	301271	My guardian	9683	“ It is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that the gentleman to whom , for the reasons I have mentioned I refrain from making further allusion — it is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that that gentleman may have done me the honor so far to misapprehend my character , as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity , that courtesy , which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house . I merely beg to observe , sir , that the fact is the reverse . ”
301282	301292	301270	301271	My guardian	9683	“ It has given me pain , Mr. Jarndyce , ”
301298	301395	301293	301294	Sir Leicester	290	“ I assure you , sir , it has given — Me — pain — to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold , that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county , and who would appear to possess a cultivated taste for the Fine Arts , was likewise deterred , by some such cause , from examining the family pictures with that leisure , that attention , that care , which he might have desired to bestow upon them , and which some of them might possibly have repaid . ”
301419	301434	301397	301397	he	290	“ Mr. Hirrold,—Herald — Harold — Skampling — Skumpling — I beg your pardon,—Skimpole . ”
301435	301442	301444	301445	my guardian	9683	“ This is Mr. Harold Skimpole , ”
301450	301453	301455	301456	Sir Leicester	290	“ Oh ! ”
301458	301506	301455	301456	Sir Leicester	290	“ I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole , and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets . I hope , sir , that when you again find yourself in my part of the county , you will be under no similar sense of restraint . ”
301507	301546	301548	301549	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You are very obliging , Sir Leicester Dedlock . So encouraged , I shall certainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to your beautiful house . The owners of such places as Chesney Wold , ”
301558	301605	301548	301549	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ are public benefactors . They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men ; and not to reap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield , is to be ungrateful to our benefactors . ”
301616	301622	301606	301607	Sir Leicester	290	“ An artist , sir ? ”
301623	301626	301628	301629	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ No , ”
301631	301641	301642	301643	Sir Leicester	290	“ A perfectly idle man . A mere amateur . ”
301683	301688	301690	301691	Sir Leicester	290	“ Mr. Skimpole mentioned , ”
301700	301724	301694	301694	himself	290	“ mentioned to the housekeeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached retainer of the family — ”
301726	301755	301756	301757	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare , ”
301764	301781	301782	301783	Sir Leicester	290	“ That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there , was Mr. Jarndyce . ”
301792	301870	301782	301783	Sir Leicester	290	“ And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed my regret . That this should have occurred to any gentleman , Mr. Jarndyce , but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock , and indeed claiming some distant connection with her , and for whom ( as I learn from my Lady herself ) she entertains a high respect , does , I assure you , give — Me — pain . ”
301871	301882	301884	301885	my guardian	9683	“ Pray say no more about it , Sir Leicester , ”
301887	301919	301884	301885	my guardian	9683	“ I am very sensible , as I am sure we all are , of your consideration . Indeed the mistake was mine , and I ought to apologise for it . ”
302017	302026	302028	302029	Sir Leicester	290	“ I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock , ”
302033	302139	302028	302029	Sir Leicester	290	“ and my Lady informed me that she had had the pleasure of exchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards , on the occasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the vicinity . Permit me , Mr. Jarndyce , to repeat to yourself , and to these ladies , the assurance I have already tendered to Mr. Skimpole . Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favored my house with his presence ; but those circumstances are confined to that gentleman himself , and do not extend beyond him . ”
302140	302149	302151	302152	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ You know my old opinion of him , ”
302159	302173	302151	302152	Mr. Skimpole	358	“ An amiable bull , who is determined to make every colour scarlet ! ”
302410	302418	302395	302395	I	0	“ May I come in , guardian ? ”
302419	302430	302395	302395	I	0	“ Surely , little woman . What 's the matter ? ”
302431	302456	302457	302457	He	6667	“ Nothing is the matter . I thought I would like to take this quiet time of saying a word to you about myself . ”
302520	302529	302531	302531	he	6667	“ What concerns you , my dear Esther , ”
302532	302551	302531	302531	he	6667	“ concerns us all . You can not be more ready to speak than I am to hear . ”
302552	302585	302586	302586	He	6667	“ I know that , guardian . But I have such need of your advice and support . O ! you do n't know how much need I have to - night . ”
302601	302613	302615	302615	I	0	“ Or how anxious I have been to speak to you , ”
302617	302628	302615	302615	I	0	“ ever since the visitor was here to - day . ”
302629	302640	302677	302677	him	6667	“ The visitor , my dear ! Sir Leicester Dedlock ? ”
302641	302644	302645	302645	He	6667	“ Yes . ”
302679	302684	302686	302686	he	6667	“ Why , Esther , ”
302693	302713	302686	302686	he	6667	“ our visitor and you are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting together ! ”
302714	302734	302739	302739	his	6667	“ O yes , guardian , I know it . And I too , but a little while ago . ”
302776	302779	302781	302781	I	0	“ Guardian , ”
302783	302806	302781	302781	I	0	“ do you remember , when we were overtaken by the thunderstorm , Lady Dedlock 's speaking to you of her sister ? ”
302807	302816	302852	302852	His	6667	“ Of course . Of course I do . ”
302817	302837	302781	302781	I	0	“ And reminding you that she and her sister had differed ; had ‘ gone their several ways ? ’ ”
302838	302842	302852	302852	His	6667	“ Of course . ”
302843	302851	302852	302852	His	6667	“ Why did they separate , guardian ? ”
302862	302929	302852	302852	His	6667	“ My child , what questions are these ! I never knew . No one but themselves ever did know , I believe . Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were ! You have seen Lady Dedlock . If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . ”
302930	302944	302852	302852	His	6667	“ O guardian , I have seen her many and many a time ! ”
302945	302949	302950	302950	He	6673	“ Seen her ? ”
302959	303026	302950	302950	He	6673	“ Then , Esther , when you spoke to me long ago of Boythorn , and when I told you that he was all but married once , and that the lady did not die , but died to him , and that that time had had its influence on his later life — did you know it all , and know who the lady was ? ”
303027	303032	303033	303033	I	0	“ No , guardian , ”
303046	303053	303033	303033	I	0	“ Nor do I know yet . ”
303054	303060	302950	302950	He	6673	“ Lady Dedlock 's sister . ”
303061	303065	302950	302950	He	6673	“ And why , ”
303072	303085	303066	303066	I	0	“ why , guardian , pray tell me why were they parted ? ”
303086	303253	302950	302950	He	6673	“ It was her act , and she kept its motives in her inflexible heart . He afterwards did conjecture ( but it was mere conjecture ) , that some injury which her haughty spirit had received in her cause of quarrel with her sister , had wounded her beyond all reason ; but she wrote him that from the date of that letter she died to him — as in literal truth she did — and that the resolution was exacted from her by her knowledge of his proud temper and his strained sense of honour , which were both her nature too . In consideration for those master points in him , and even in consideration for them in herself , she made the sacrifice , she said , and would live in it and die in it . She did both , I fear : certainly he never saw her , never heard of her from that hour . Nor did any one . ”
303254	303263	303264	303264	I	0	“ O guardian , what have I done ! ”
303273	303281	303264	303264	I	0	“ what sorrow have I innocently caused ! ”
303282	303288	302950	302950	He	6673	“ You caused , Esther ? ”
303289	303308	303264	303264	I	0	“ Yes , guardian . Innocently , but most surely . That secluded sister is my first remembrance . ”
303309	303314	303315	303315	he	6674	“ No , no ! ”
303320	303334	303315	303315	he	6674	“ Yes , guardian , yes ! And her sister is my mother ! ”
303695	303701	303703	303703	he	6674	“ Nor do I understand , ”
303705	303724	303703	303703	he	6674	“ that any doubts tend towards you , my dear . Much suspicion may exist without that connexion . ”
303725	303730	303731	303731	I	0	“ With the lawyer , ”
303734	303750	303731	303731	I	0	“ But two other persons have come into my mind since I have been anxious . ”
303789	303790	303784	303784	I	0	” “
303793	303798	303784	303784	I	0	” said my guardian . “
303813	303835	303810	303811	the other	9883	” I called to his recollection the French maid , and the eager offer of herself she had made to me . “
303838	303843	303810	303811	the other	9883	” he returned thoughtfully , “
303909	303910	303904	303904	She	6688	” “
303916	303919	303911	303911	Her	6688	” said I. “

304121	304197	304198	304198	My	0	” I thanked him with my whole heart . What could I ever do but thank him ! I was going out at the door , when he asked me to stay a moment . Quickly turning round , I saw that same expression on his face again ; and all at once , I do n't know how , it flashed upon me as a new and far off possibility that I understood it . “
304202	304207	304198	304198	My	0	” said my guardian , “

304335	304343	304316	304316	I	0	” I answered , in all earnestness , “
304346	304380	304316	304316	I	0	” With the strictest truth , for his momentary hesitation was gone ( it had not lasted a minute ) , and his fine , sensible , cordial , sterling manner was restored . “
304407	304428	304394	304394	I	0	” said he , with his bright clear eyes on mine . I answered , most assuredly he did not . “

304450	304458	304443	304443	Esther	305	” said I with my whole heart . “

304474	304522	304471	304471	your	12346	” He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and , looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner — the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment — said , “
304558	304559	304545	304545	you	12346	” “

304605	304614	304603	304603	Esther	305	” said he , with a gentle seriousness , “

304838	304887	304830	304830	I	0	” He shook my hand and said no more . Nor was any more said in reference to this conversation , either by him or me , through the whole week . When the appointed night came , I said to Charley as soon as I was alone , “
304910	304972	304979	304979	Charley	372	” Charley went up the stairs , and down the stairs , and along the passages — the zig - zag way about the old - fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that night — and so came back , along the passages , and down the stairs , and up the stairs , and brought the letter . “
304981	306110	304979	304979	Charley	372	” said I. So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things . I began with my overshadowed childhood , and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead , with her resolute face so cold and set ; and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael , than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at . I passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in all around me , and to be beloved . I came to the time when I first saw my dear girl , and was received into that sisterly affection which was the grace and beauty of my life . I recalled the first bright gleam of welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant faces on that cold bright night , and which had never paled . I lived my happy life there over again , I went through my illness and recovery , I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so unchanged ; and all this happiness shone like a light , from one central figure , represented before me by the letter on the table . I opened it and read it . It was so impressive in its love for me , and in the unselfish caution it gave me , and the consideration it showed for me in every word , that my eyes were too often blinded to read much at a time . But I read it through three times , before I laid it down . I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport , and I did . It asked me would I be the mistress of Bleak House . It was not a love letter though it expressed so much love , but was written just as he would at any time have spoken to me . I saw his face , and heard his voice , and felt the influence of his kind protecting manner , in every line . It addressed me as if our places were reversed : as if all the good deeds had been mine , and all the feelings they had awakened , his . It dwelt on my being young , and he past the prime of life ; on his having attained a ripe age , while I was a child ; on his writing to me with a silvered head , and knowing all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature deliberation . It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage , and lose nothing by rejecting it ; for no new relation could enhance the tenderness in which he held me , and whatever my decision was , he was certain it would be right . But he had considered this step anew , since our late confidence , and had decided on taking it ; if it only served to show me , through one poor instance , that the whole world would readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood . I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him , but of that he said no more ; for I was always to remember that I owed him nothing , and that he was my debtor , and for very much . He had often thought of our future ; and , foreseeing that the time must come , and fearing that it might come soon , when Ada ( now very nearly of age ) would leave us , and when our present mode of life must be broken up , had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal . Thus he made it . If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than Death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably , while this letter was yet so new to me ; but , even then , I must have ample time for reconsideration . In that case , or in the opposite case , let him be unchanged in his old relation , in his old manner , in the old name by which I called him . And as to his bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper , she would ever be the same , he knew . This was the substance of the letter ; written throughout with a justice and a dignity , as if he were indeed my responsible guardian , impartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his integrity he stated the full case . But he did not hint to me , that when I had been better - looking , he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts , and had refrained from it . That when my old face was gone from me , and I had no attractions , he could love me just as well as in my fairer days . That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock . That his generosity rose above my disfigurement , and my inheritance of shame . That the more I stood in need of such fidelity , the more firmly I might trust in him to the last . But I knew it , I knew it well now . It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do . To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorly , and what had I wished for the other night but some new means of thanking him ? Still I cried very much ; not only in the fulness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect — for it was strange though I had expected the contents — but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me . I was very happy , very thankful , very hopeful ; but I cried very much . By - and - by I went to my old glass . My eyes were red and swollen , and I said , “
306121	306152	306119	306119	you	305	” I am afraid the face in the glass was going to cry again at this reproach , but I held up my finger at it , and it stopped . “
306176	306187	306169	306169	you	305	” said I , beginning to let down my hair . “
306226	306260	306218	306218	us	6707	” I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably . I sobbed a little still , but that was because I had been crying ; not because I was crying then . “
306310	306519	306522	306522	you	6713	” I thought , all at once , if my guardian had married some one else , how should I have felt , and what should I have done ! That would have been a change indeed . It presented my life in such a new and blank form , that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid them down in their basket again . Then I went on to think , as I dressed my hair before the glass , how often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my illness , and the circumstances of my birth , were only new reasons why I should be busy , busy , busy — useful , amiable , serviceable , in all honest unpretending ways . This was a good time , to be sure , to sit down morbidly and cry ! As to its seeming at all strange to me at first ( if that were any excuse for crying , which it was not ) that I was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House , why should it seem strange ? Other people had thought of such things , if I had not . “
306529	306539	306522	306522	you	6713	” I asked myself , looking at the glass , “
306554	307060	306541	306542	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	” Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance . The dried remains of the flowers . It would be better not to keep them now . They had only been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone , but it would be better not to keep them now . They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room — our sitting - room , dividing Ada 's chamber from mine . I took a candle , and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf . After I had it in my hand , I saw my beautiful darling , through the open door , lying asleep , and I stole in to kiss her . It was weak in me , I know , and I could have no reason for crying ; but I dropped a tear upon her dear face , and another , and another . Weaker than that , I took the withered flowers out , and put them for a moment to her lips . I thought about her love for Richard ; though , indeed , the flowers had nothing to do with that . Then I took them into my own room , and burned them at the candle , and they were dust in an instant . On entering the breakfast - room next morning , I found my guardian just as usual ; quite as frank , as open , and free . There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none ( or I think there was none ) in mine . I was with him several times in the course of the morning , in and out , when there was no one there ; and I thought it not unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter ; but he did not say a word . So , on the next morning , and the next , and for at least a week ; over which time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his stay . I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter ; but he never did . I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer . I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer ; so I thought each night I would wait one more day . And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word . At last Mr. Skimpole having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I being dressed before Ada , and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing - room window looking out . He turned on my coming in , and said , smiling , “
307073	307101	307065	307065	you	6715	” and looked out again . I had made up my mind to speak to him now . In short , I had come down on purpose . “
307104	307113	307102	307102	Guardian	9676	” I said , rather hesitating and trembling , “
307129	307130	307116	307116	you	9676	” “
307139	307143	307144	307144	I	0	” he replied . “
307150	307153	307144	307144	I	0	” said I. “
307160	307166	307155	307155	Charley	372	” he asked , pleasantly . “
307177	307368	307175	307175	guardian	9676	” I returned . I put my two arms round his neck and kissed him ; and he said was this the mistress of Bleak House ; and I said yes ; and it made no difference presently , and we all went out together , and I said nothing to my precious pet about it . ONE morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys , as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened to turn my eyes towards the house , and saw a long thin shadow going in which looked like Mr. Vholes . Ada had been telling me only that morning , of her hopes that Richard might exhaust his ardor in the Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it ; and therefore , not to damp my dear girl 's spirits , I said nothing about Mr. Vholes 's shadow . Presently came Charley , lightly winding among the bushes , and tripping along the paths , as rosy and pretty as one of Flora 's attendants instead of my maid , saying , “
307385	307441	307377	307377	you	6720	” It was one of Charley 's peculiarities , that whenever she was charged with a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld , at any distance , the person for whom it was intended . Therefore I saw Charley , asking me in her usual form of words , to “
307445	307529	307532	307532	miss	9100	” to Mr. Jarndyce , long before I heard her . And when I did hear her , she had said it so often that she was out of breath . I told Ada I would make haste back , and inquired of Charley , as we went in , whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce ? To which Charley , whose grammar , I confess to my shame , never did any credit to my educational powers , replied , “
307545	307649	307542	307543	Mr. Richard	320	” A more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes , I suppose there could not be . I found them looking at one another across a table ; the one so open , and the other so close ; the one so broad and upright , and the other so narrow and stooping ; the one giving out what he had to say in such a rich ringing voice , and the other keeping it in in such a cold - blooded , gasping , fish - like manner ; that I thought I never had seen two people so unmatched . “
307658	307714	307652	307653	Mr. Vholes	680	” said my guardian . Not with the greatest urbanity , I must say . Mr. Vholes rose , gloved and buttoned up as usual , and seated himself again , just as he had seated himself beside Richard in the gig . Not having Richard to look at , he looked straight before him . “
307718	307738	307715	307716	Mr. Vholes	680	” said my guardian , eyeing his black figure , as if he were a bird of ill omen , “
307750	307804	307748	307748	Rick	350	” Laying a marked emphasis on most unfortunate , as if the words were rather descriptive of his connexion with Mr. Vholes . I sat down between them ; Mr. Vholes remained immoveable , except that he secretly picked at one of the red pimples on his yellow face with his black glove . “
307821	307826	307828	307828	you	680	” said my guardian , “
307850	307860	307861	307861	I	0	” Doing anything but that , Mr. Vholes observed : “
308057	308094	308022	308023	Mr. C	677	” Mr. Vholes , who had looked at me while speaking , here merged into the silence he could hardly be said to have broken , so stifled was his tone and looked before him again . “
308105	308112	308022	308023	Mr. C	677	” said my guardian to me . “
308119	308160	308161	308163	Mr. Vholes hereupon	680	” You know him , Esther . He would never accept of help from me , now . To offer it , or hint at it , would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . ”
308168	308340	308342	308343	Mr. Vholes	680	“ What Mr. Jarndyce remarks , miss , is no doubt the case , and is the difficulty . I do not see that anything is to be done . I do not say that anything is to be done . Far from it . I merely come down here under the seal of confidence and mention it , in order that everything may be openly carried on , and that it may not be said afterwards that everything was not openly carried on . My wish is that everything should be openly carried on . I desire to leave a good name behind me . If I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C , I should not be here . So insurmountable , as you must well know , would be his objections . This is not a professional attendance . This can be charged to nobody . I have no interest in it , except as a member of society and a father — and a son , ”
308503	308508	308510	308511	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Well , sir , ”
308513	308549	308510	308511	Mr. Jarndyce	313	“ Miss Summerson will communicate with Mr. Carstone , and we can only hope that his position may be yet retrievable . You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . ”
308550	308558	308560	308561	Mr. Vholes	680	“ I thank you , Mr. Jarndyce , ”
308578	308655	308560	308561	Mr. Vholes	680	“ not any . I thank you , no , not a morsel . My digestion is much impaired , and I am but a poor knife and fork at any time . If I was to partake of solid food at this period of the day , I do n't know what the consequences might be . Everything having been openly carried on , sir , I will now with your permission take my leave . ”
308656	308678	308680	308681	my guardian	9683	“ And I would that you could take your leave , and we could all take our leave , Mr. Vholes , ”
308685	308693	308694	308695	Mr. Vholes	680	“ of a Cause you know of . ”
308741	308818	308819	308819	I	0	“ We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of respectable practitioners , sir , can but put our shoulders to the wheel . We do it , sir . At least , I do it myself ; and I wish to think well of my professional brethren , one and all . You are sensible of an obligation not to refer to me , miss , in communicating with Mr. C ? ”
308830	308847	308848	308849	Mr. Vholes	680	“ Just so , miss . Good morning . Mr. Jarndyce , good morning , sir . ”
309807	309811	309813	309813	Richard	320	“ Now then ! ”
309839	309853	309854	309854	He	6786	“ Can I come in , Richard . It 's only Dame Durden . ”
309990	309999	310001	310001	he	6786	“ Good Heaven , my dear little woman , ”
310003	310026	310001	310001	he	6786	“ how do you come here . Who could have thought of seeing you ! Nothing the matter ? Ada is well ? ”
310027	310037	310048	310048	his	6786	“ Quite well . Lovelier than ever , Richard ! ”
310038	310041	310042	310042	he	6786	“ Ah ! ”
310051	310064	310042	310042	he	6786	“ My poor cousin ! I was writing to you , Esther . ”
310100	310122	310123	310123	I	0	“ Have you been at the trouble of writing all that , and am I not to read it after all ? ”
310126	310131	310132	310132	he	6786	“ Oh my dear , ”
310140	310156	310157	310157	I	0	“ You may read it in the whole room . It is all over here . ”
310194	310209	310211	310211	he	6786	“ Like you , Esther , but useless , and so not like you ! ”
310217	310281	310211	310211	he	6786	“ I am away on leave this day — should have been gone in another hour — and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out . Well ! Let bygones be bygones . So this calling follows the rest . I only want to have been in the church , to have made the round of all the professions . ”
310282	310285	310286	310286	I	0	“ Richard , ”
310289	310298	310286	310286	I	0	“ it is not so hopeless as that ? ”
310299	310302	310303	310303	he	6786	“ Esther , ”
310306	310397	310398	310398	he	6786	“ it is indeed . I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me ( as the catechism goes ) would far rather be without me than with me . And they are right . Apart from debts and duns , and all such drawbacks , I am not fit even for this employment . I have no care , no mind , no heart , no soul , but for one thing . Why , if this bubble had n't broken now , ”
310419	310462	310398	310398	he	6786	“ how could I have gone abroad ? I must have been ordered abroad ; but how could I have gone . How could I , with my experience of that thing , trust even Vholes unless I was at his back ! ”
310503	310634	310635	310635	He	6786	“ No , Dame Durden ! Two subjects I forbid — must forbid . The first is John Jarndyce . The second , you know what . Call it madness , and I tell you I ca n't help it now , and ca n't be sane . But it is no such thing ; it is the one object I have to pursue . It is a pity I ever was prevailed upon to turn out of my road for any other . It would be wisdom to abandon it now , after all the time , anxiety , and pains I have bestowed upon it ! O yes , true wisdom . It would be very agreeable , too , to some people ; but I never will . ”
310676	310684	310685	310685	he	6786	“ Am I to read it now ? ”
310805	310818	310819	310819	He	6786	“ Of course , Esther , you know what she says here ? ”
310835	310840	310819	310819	He	6786	“ Yes , Richard . ”
310841	310845	310846	310846	he	6786	“ Offers me , ”
310857	310900	310846	310846	he	6786	“ the little inheritance she is certain of so soon — just as little and as much as I have wasted — and begs and prays me to take it , set myself right with it , and remain in the service . ”
310901	310915	310917	310917	I.	0	“ I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart , ”

310934	310949	310950	310950	He	6786	“ I am sure it is . I — I wish I was dead ! ”
311022	311051	311053	311053	he	6786	“ And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce , who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us , stepped in to estrange from me , ”
311057	311101	311053	311053	he	6786	“ And the dear girl makes me this generous offer from under the same John Jarndyce 's roof , and with the same John Jarndyce 's gracious consent and connivance , I dare say , as a new means of buying me off . ”
311102	311105	311106	311106	I	0	“ Richard ! ”
311113	311124	311106	311106	I	0	“ I will not hear you say such shameful words ! ”

Besides , I have letters and papers that I could show you , which would convince you it is all over here . I have done with the red coat , believe me . But it is some satisfaction , in the midst of my troubles and perplexities , to know that I am pressing Ada 's interests in pressing my own . Vholes has his shoulder to the wheel , and he can not help urging it on as much for her as for me , thank God ! ”
311422	311427	311429	311429	Richard	320	“ No , no ! ”
311433	311619	311429	311429	Richard	320	“ If every farthing of Ada 's little fortune were mine , no part of it should be spent in retaining me in what I am not fit for , can take no interest in , and am weary of . It should be devoted to what promises a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake . Do n't be uneasy for me ! I shall now have only one thing on my mind , and Vholes and I will work it . I shall not be without means . Free of my commission , I shall be able to compound with some small usurers , who will hear of nothing but their bond now — Vholes says so . I should have a balance in my favor any way , but that will swell it . Come , come ! You shall carry a letter to Ada from me , Esther , and you must both of you be more hopeful of me , and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet , my dear . ”

What you were last month , you are to - day ; you are no worse , you are no better . This is not your resolution ; call it up , Esther , call it up ! ”

I never saw so remarkable a look in a young person . One can not say that it is all anxiety , or all weariness ; yet it is both , and like ungrown despair . ”
313251	313260	313262	313262	I.	0	“ You do not think he is ill ? ”
313271	313290	313291	313291	I	0	“ That he can not be at peace in mind , we have too much reason to know , ”
313294	313304	313291	313291	I	0	“ Mr. Woodcourt , you are going to London ? ”
313305	313314	313181	313182	Mr. Woodcourt	497	“ To - morrow or the next day . ”
313315	313389	313265	313265	He	497	“ There is nothing Richard wants so much , as a friend . He always liked you . Pray see him when you get there . Pray help him sometimes with your companionship , if you can . You do not know of what service it might be . You can not think how Ada , and Mr. Jarndyce , and even I — how we should all thank you , Mr. Woodcourt ! ”
313390	313394	313395	313395	he	6830	“ Miss Summerson , ”
313408	313437	313395	313395	he	6830	“ before Heaven , I will be a true friend to him ! I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ”
313438	313443	313445	313445	I	0	“ God bless you ! ”
313466	313505	313506	313506	Richard	320	“ Ada loves him — we all love him , but Ada loves him as we can not . I will tell her what you say . Thank you , and God bless you , in her name ! ”
313529	313532	313533	313533	he	6832	“ Woodcourt , ”
313541	313549	313533	313533	he	6832	“ pray let us meet in London ! ”
313550	313553	313555	313556	the other	9883	“ Meet ? ”
313558	313577	313533	313533	he	6832	“ I have scarcely a friend there , now , but you . Where shall I find you ? ”
313578	313590	313592	313592	Richard	320	“ Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , ”
313596	313606	313592	313592	Richard	320	“ Say at Vholes 's , Symond 's Inn . ”
313607	313615	313616	313616	They	6835	“ Good ! Without loss of time . ”
314624	314630	314621	314621	he	497	“ What is the matter ? ”
314631	314636	314621	314621	he	497	“ Nothing , sir . ”
314637	314653	314621	314621	he	497	“ Ca n't you make them hear ? Do you want to be let in ? ”
314654	314674	314675	314676	the woman	9769	“ I 'm waiting till they get up at another house — a lodging - house — not here , ”
314680	314696	314675	314676	the woman	9769	“ I 'm waiting here because there will be sun here presently to warm me . ”
314697	314716	314621	314621	he	497	“ I am afraid you are tired . I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . ”
314717	314728	314675	314676	the woman	9769	“ Thank you , sir . It do n't matter . ”
314783	314791	314792	314792	he	6868	“ Let me look at your forehead , ”
314798	314818	314792	314792	he	6868	“ I am a doctor . Do n't be afraid . I would n't hurt you for the world . ”
314848	314853	314840	314840	She	9769	“ It 's nothing ; ”
314874	314893	314866	314866	she	9769	“ Aye ! A bad bruise , and the skin sadly broken . This must be very sore . ”
314894	314903	314905	314906	the woman	9769	“ It do ache a little , sir , ”
314916	314933	314905	314906	the woman	9769	“ Let me try to make it more comfortable . My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . ”
314934	314946	314947	314947	He	6868	“ O dear no sir , I 'm sure of that ! ”
315008	315017	314994	314994	he	6868	“ And so your husband is a brickmaker ? ”
315018	315027	315029	315030	the woman	9769	“ How do you know that , sir ? ”
315034	315084	315085	315086	The woman	9769	“ Why , I suppose so , from the color of the clay upon your bag and on your dress . And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places . And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . ”
315129	315135	315137	315138	the surgeon	10142	“ Where is he now ? ”
315140	315162	315137	315138	the surgeon	10142	“ He got into trouble last night , sir ; but he 'll look for me at the lodging - house . ”
315163	315218	315219	315220	The woman	9769	“ He will get into worse trouble if he often misuses his large and heavy hand as he has misused it here . But you forgive him , brutal as he is , and I say no more of him , except that I wish he deserved it . You have no young child ? ”
315225	315240	315222	315222	her	9769	“ One as I calls mine , sir , but it 's Liz 's . ”
315241	315254	315258	315258	he	6878	“ Your own is dead . I see ! Poor little thing ! ”
315269	315284	315285	315285	he	6878	“ I suppose you have some settled home . Is it far from here ? ”
315306	315348	315300	315300	she	9769	“ It 's a good two or three - and - twenty mile from here , sir . At Saint Albans . You know Saint Albans , sir ? I thought you gave a start like , as if you did ? ”
315349	315376	315397	315397	He	6878	“ Yes , I know something of it . And now I will ask you a question in return . Have you money for your lodging ? ”
315377	315382	315383	315383	she	9769	“ Yes , sir , ”
315386	315391	315383	315383	she	9769	“ really and truly . ”
315755	315762	315764	315765	the woman	9769	“ Stop him , stop him ! ”
315770	315776	315777	315777	He	6878	“ Stop him , sir ! ”
315831	315841	315825	315826	the woman	9769	“ Stop him , sir , pray stop him ! ”
315992	315998	316000	316001	the woman	9769	“ O you , Jo ! ”
316003	316014	316000	316001	the woman	9769	“ What ? I have found you at last ! ’ “
316017	316027	316028	316028	Jo	440	” repeats Allan , looking at him with attention , “
316049	316050	316036	316036	I	0	” “
316062	316066	316055	316055	you	440	” whimpers Jo . “
316213	316272	316273	316274	Miserable creature	6907	” He says it with such a pitiable air , and his grimy tears appear so real , and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity , that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him . He says to the woman , “
316281	316300	316278	316278	he	11664	” To which she only replies , shaking her head at the prostrate figure more amazedly than angrily : “
316315	316316	316308	316308	I	0	” “
316322	316326	316319	316319	he	11664	” says Allan . “
316332	316333	316328	316328	he	11664	” “
316362	316388	316342	316342	He	11664	” Allan looks from Jo to the woman , and from the woman to Jo , waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle . “
316398	316401	316402	316402	you	6908	” says the woman,—“O
316444	316455	316457	316457	sir	9019	” Allan shrinks back from him with a sudden horror . “
316579	316662	316663	316663	Richard	320	” demands the woman , beginning to rage at him as she recalls it , and breaking into passionate tears . The boy , in rough sort stunned by what he hears , falls to smearing his dirty forehead with his dirty palm , and to staring at the ground , and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against which he leans , rattles . Allan restrains the woman , merely by a quiet gesture , but effectually . “
316667	316671	316663	316663	Richard	320	” he falters , “
316694	316747	316751	316751	she	6923	” He turns away , and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage . When he comes back , he has recovered his composure ; except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable , that it absorbs the woman 's attention . “
316761	316816	316820	316820	she	6923	” Jo , shaking and chattering , slowly rises , and stands , after the manner of his tribe in a difficulty , sideways against the hoarding , resting one of his high shoulders against it , and covertly rubbing his right hand over his left , and his left foot over his right . “
316837	316838	316831	316831	you	6922	” “
316854	316860	316841	316841	I	0	” replies Jo , hoarsely . “
316868	316891	316863	316863	you	6922	” Jo looks all round the confined court , looks at his questioner no higher than the knees , and finally answers : “
316983	316984	316971	316971	she	632	” “
316991	317023	316971	316971	she	632	” Jo looks all round the court again , looks at his questioner 's knees again , and concludes by laying his profile against the hoarding in a sort of resignation . “
317036	317037	317038	317038	Tramp	6928	” “
317041	317045	317038	317038	Tramp	6928	” says Jo . “
317051	317080	317049	317049	me	0	” proceeds Allan , making a strong effort to overcome his repugnance , going very near to him , and leaning over him with an expression of confidence , “
317112	317235	317094	317097	the good young lady	6930	” Jo suddenly comes out of his resignation , and excitedly declares , addressing the woman , that he never known about the young lady , that he never heern about it , that he never went fur to hurt her , that he would sooner have hurt his own self , that he 'd sooner have had his unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a - nigh her , and that she wos wery good to him , she wos . Conducting himself throughout as if in his poor fashion he really meant it , and winding up with some very miserable sobs . Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham . He constrains himself to touch him . “
317243	317244	317238	317238	Jo	440	” “
317250	317260	317261	317261	I	0	” says Jo , relapsing into the profile state . “
317268	317269	317265	317265	I	0	” “
317275	317280	317271	317271	I	0	” returns the other , “
317289	317317	317287	317287	Jo	440	” After two or three such adjurations , Jo lifts up his head again , looks round the court again , and says in a low voice , “
317333	317334	317287	317287	Jo	440	” “
317342	317343	317287	317287	Jo	440	” “
317346	317397	317287	317287	Jo	440	” Very apprehensive of being overheard , Jo looks about him , and even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding , and through the cracks in it , lest the object of his distrust should be looking over , or hidden on the other side . “
317403	317404	317405	317405	I	0	” “
317410	317414	317405	317405	I	0	” says Jo . “
317422	317423	317415	317415	I	0	” “
317449	317450	317443	317445	No one else	6936	” “
317459	317468	317454	317454	I	0	” replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , “
317475	317476	317470	317470	he	6933	” “
317486	317487	317479	317479	he	6933	” “
317495	317499	317492	317492	he	6933	” says Jo . “
317512	317566	317500	317500	He	6933	” Allan looks at him in perplexity , but discovers some real meaning and good faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply . He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and Jo , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear . “
317569	317573	317500	317500	He	6933	” says Allan . “
317582	317583	317578	317578	you	0	” “
317636	317637	317652	317652	he	6933	” “
317657	317658	317652	317652	he	6933	” “
317665	317671	317652	317652	he	6933	” replied Jo , whispering , “
317776	317810	317766	317766	he	6944	” concludes Jo , nervously repeating all his former precautions and investigations . Allan considers a little ; then remarks , turning to the woman , but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo ; “
317835	317836	317820	317820	He	6944	” “
317843	317847	317820	317820	He	6944	” exclaims Jo . “
317891	317892	317887	317887	I	0	” “
317897	317907	317895	317895	Jo	440	” says Allan , keeping his eye upon him , “
317964	317965	317966	317966	I	0	” “
317982	317983	317972	317972	I	0	” “
318025	318026	318021	318023	my good woman	6952	” “
318042	318066	318034	318034	I	0	” She has been sitting on her bag , deeply attentive , and now rises and takes it up . Jo , repeating , “
318087	318211	318068	318068	you	440	” nods and shambles and shivers , and smears and blinks , and half laughs and half cries , a farewell to her , and takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt , close to the houses on the opposite side of the street . In this order , the two come up out of Tom - all - Alone 's into the broad rays of the sunlight and the purer air . As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets , where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest , Allan revolves in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion . “
318219	318223	318068	318068	you	440	” he considers , “
318249	318494	318495	318495	I	0	” But it is none the less a fact because of its strangeness , and the difficulty remains . At first , he looks behind him often , to assure himself that Jo is still really following . But , look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him , watchfully . Soon satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip , Allan goes on ; considering with a less divided attention what he shall do . A breakfast - stall at a street corner suggests the first thing to be done . He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo . Jo crosses , and comes halting and shuffling up , slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left — kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar . What is a dainty repast to Jo is then set before him , and he begins to gulp the coffee , and to gnaw the bread and butter ; looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks , like a scared animal . But he is so sick and miserable , that even hunger has abandoned him . “
318505	318515	318497	318497	I	0	” says Jo , soon putting down his food ; “
318541	318568	318572	318572	Jo	440	” And Jo stands shivering , and looking at the breakfast wonderingly . Allan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse , and on his chest . “
318574	318575	318572	318572	Jo	440	” “
318579	318583	318572	318572	Jo	440	” says Jo , “
318590	318595	318572	318572	Jo	440	” He might add , “
318601	318607	318572	318572	Jo	440	” but he only mutters , “
318616	318674	318608	318608	I	0	” Allan looks about for an apothecary 's shop . There is none at hand , but a tavern does as well or better . He obtains a little measure of wine , and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully . He begins to revive , almost as soon as it passes his lips . “
318683	318695	318681	318681	Jo	440	” observes Allan , after watching him with his attentive face . “
318712	319036	319037	319039	My dear physician	14105	” Leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the breakfast - stall , with his back against an iron railing , Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine , casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him . It requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed . If a face so shaded can brighten , his face brightens somewhat ; and , by little and little , he eats the slice of bread he had so hopelessly laid down . Observant of these signs of improvement , Allan engages him in conversation ; and elicits to his no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil , with all its consequences . Jo slowly munches , as he slowly tells it . When he has finished his story and his bread , they go on again . Intending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy , to his old patient , zealous little Miss Flite , Allan leads the way to the court where he and Jo first foregathered . But all is changed at the rag - and - bottle shop ; Miss Flite no longer lodges there it is shut up ; and a hard - featured female , much obscured by dust , whose age is a problem — but who is indeed no other than the interesting Judy — is tart and spare in her replies . These sufficing , however , to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder , in Bell Yard , he repairs to that neighbouring place ; where Miss Flite ( who rises early that she may be punctual at the Divan of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor ) comes running down - stairs , with tears of welcome and with open arms . “
319041	319046	319037	319039	My dear physician	14105	” cries Miss Flite . “
319055	319120	319052	319053	honourable officer	6964	” She uses some odd expressions , but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be — more so than it often is . Allan , very patient with her , waits until she has no more raptures to express ; then points out Jo , trembling in a door - way , and tells her how he comes there . “
319147	319189	319190	319190	Gridley	510	” Miss Flite , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her . Mrs. Blinder is entirely let , and she herself occupies poor Gridley 's room . “
319192	319209	319210	319210	Gridley	510	” exclaims Miss Flite , clapping her hands , after a twentieth repetition of this remark . “
319230	319452	319223	319224	General George	714	” It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George , and would be , though Miss Flite had not already run up - stairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl , and to arm herself with her reticule of documents . But as she informs her physician , in her disjointed manner , on coming down in full array , that General George , whom she often calls upon , knows her dear Fitz - Jarndyce , and takes a great interest in all connected with her , Allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way . So he tells Jo , for his encouragement , that this walking about will soon be over now ; and they repair to the General 's . Fortunately it is not far . From the exterior of George 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , Allan Woodcourt augurs well . He also descries promise in the figure of Mr. George himself , striding towards them in his morning exercise with his pipe in his mouth , no stock on , and his muscular arms , developed by broadsword and dumb - bell , weightily asserting themselves through his light shirt - sleeves . “
319458	319513	319517	319517	sir	9019	” says Mr. George , with a military salute . Goodhumoredly smiling all over his broad forehead up into his crisp hair , he then defers to Miss Flite , as , with great stateliness , and at some length , she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation . He winds it up with another “
319519	319524	319517	319517	sir	9019	” and another salute . “
319536	319541	319533	319533	I	0	” says Mr. George . “
319554	319558	319547	319547	I	0	” returns Allan ; “
319569	319570	319573	319573	sir	9019	” “
319589	319630	319587	319587	myself	0	” Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his intrusion the more readily on that account , and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe , which , in his politeness , he has testified some intention of doing . “
319638	319643	319636	319636	sir	9019	” returns the trooper . “
319669	319703	319667	319667	yourself	9019	” and finishes the sentence by putting it between his lips again . Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo ; unto which the trooper listens with a grave face . “
319715	319746	319749	319749	he	3994	” he inquires , looking along the entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the whitewashed front , which have no meaning in his eyes . “
319751	319755	319749	319749	he	3994	” says Allan . “
319856	319857	319849	319849	I	0	” “
319864	319869	319858	319859	No man	898	” returns Mr. George . “
319920	319921	319922	319922	I	0	” “
319929	319934	319922	319922	I	0	” says Mr. George . “
319952	319953	319954	319955	The boy	9518	” “
319966	319967	319964	319964	Bucket	734	” “
319974	319975	319976	319978	The same man	6995	” “
319980	319981	319976	319978	The same man	6995	” “
319991	320009	319982	319983	The man	1653	” returns the trooper , after blowing out a cloud of smoke , and squaring his chest ; “
320026	320044	320018	320018	he	9518	” Mr. George smokes with a profound meaning after this , and surveys Miss Flite in silence . “
320129	320145	320124	320124	Jo	440	” says Allan , following the direction of the trooper 's eyes along the entry , “
320186	320258	320261	320261	sir	9019	” As he puts the question , he becomes aware of a dirty - faced little man , standing at the trooper 's elbow , and looking up , with an oddly twisted figure and countenance , into the trooper 's face . After a few more puffs at his pipe , the trooper looks down askant at the little man , and the little man winks up at the trooper . “
320263	320268	320261	320261	sir	9019	” says Mr. George , “
320421	320442	320443	320443	I	0	” With a comprehensive wave of his pipe , Mr. George places the whole building at his visitor 's disposal . “
320451	320455	320458	320462	one of the medical staff	7017	” he adds , “
320475	320483	320486	320486	sir	9019	” Allan is quite sure of it . “
320488	320498	320486	320486	sir	9019	” says Mr. George , shaking his head sorrowfully , “
320506	320519	320486	320486	sir	9019	” His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance . “
320529	320539	320522	320522	I	0	” observes Allan , after repeating his former assurance , “
320569	320570	320555	320555	I	0	” “
320581	320586	320572	320572	you	9019	” inquires the trooper . “
320593	320594	320572	320572	you	9019	” “
320599	320609	320597	320597	sir	9019	” returns the trooper , in a decisive manner , “
320643	320930	320636	320636	You	9019	” Mr. Squod tacks out , all on one side , to execute the word of command ; and the trooper , having smoked his pipe , lays it by . Jo is brought in . He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle 's Tockahoopo Indians ; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby 's lambs , being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola - Gha ; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity ; he is not a genuine foreign - grown savage ; he is the ordinary home - made article . Dirty , ugly , disagreeable to all the senses , in body a common creature of the common streets , only in soul a heathen . Homely filth begrimes him , homely parasites devour him , homely sores are in him , homely rags are on him : native ignorance , the growth of English soil and climate , sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish . Stand forth , Jo , in uncompromising colors ! From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head , there is nothing interesting about thee . He shuffles slowly into Mr. George 's gallery , and stands huddled together in a bundle , looking all about the floor . He seems to know that they have an inclination to shrink from him , partly for what he is , and partly for what he has caused . He , too , shrinks from them . He is not of the same order of things , not of the same place in creation . He is of no order and no place ; neither of the beasts , nor of humanity . “
320936	320940	320934	320934	Jo	440	” says Allan . “
320946	320968	320943	320944	Mr. George	562	” Jo searches the floor for some time longer , then looks up for a moment , and then down again . “
320989	321030	321031	321031	wery	7028	” Jo makes a scoop with one hand , which is supposed to be a bow . After a little more consideration , and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests , he mutters that he is “
321034	321035	321031	321031	wery	7028	” “
321074	321075	321061	321061	you	7026	” “
321084	321094	321082	321082	sir	9019	” says Jo , reverting to his favorite declaration . “
321134	321135	321136	321136	I	0	” “
321156	321157	321148	321148	he	562	” “
321165	321175	321158	321158	My	0	” observes Mr. George , amazingly broad and upright , “
321201	321226	321256	321256	your	7026	” As the trooper speaks , he conducts them to the other end of the gallery , and opens one of the little cabins . “
321261	321273	321254	321254	I	0	” he refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him ; “
321312	321322	321323	321323	Phil	569	” says the trooper , turning to his visitor . “
321328	321341	321323	321323	Phil	569	” Phil bears down upon them , according to his usual tactics . “
321388	321389	321379	321379	You	569	” “
321398	321404	321393	321393	I	0	” is Phil 's reply . “
321412	321442	321406	321406	I	0	” says Mr. George , in a martial sort of confidence , as if he were giving his opinion in a council of war at a drum - head , “
321472	321473	321474	321475	Mr. George	562	” “
321481	321490	321474	321475	Mr. George	562	” returns Allan , taking out his purse , “
321501	321566	321496	321496	I	0	” Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of improvement . Miss Flite , quite entraptured by her success , makes the best of her way to Court ; having great fears that otherwise her friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her , or may give the judgment she has so long expected , in her absence ; and observing “
321589	321634	321635	321635	I	0	” Allan takes the opportunity of going out to procure some restorative medicines ; and obtaining them near at hand , soon returns , to find the trooper walking up and down the gallery , and to fall into step and walk with him . “
321641	321646	321635	321635	I	0	” says Mr. George , “
321655	321661	321650	321651	Miss Summerson	305	” Yes , it appears . “
321669	321675	321667	321667	sir	9019	” No , it appears . “
321681	321686	321667	321667	sir	9019	” says Mr. George . “
321728	321729	321724	321724	I	0	” “
321736	321767	321733	321734	Mr. George	562	” The trooper looks sideways at Allan 's sun - burnt cheek and bright dark eye , rapidly measures his height and build , and seems to approve of him . “
321829	321840	321841	321841	Tulkinghorn	293	” Allan looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name . “
321888	321899	321879	321880	the man	1653	” Allan naturally asks what kind of man he is ? “
321912	321913	321906	321906	you	0	” “
321936	321937	321934	321934	man	9954	” “
321948	321977	321978	321978	he	1653	” returns the trooper , stopping short , and folding his arms on his square chest , so angrily , that his face fires and flushes all over ; ”
322053	322054	322055	322055	I	0	” “
322059	322063	322019	322019	George!—that	715	” says Allan , “
322072	322073	322117	322117	He	1653	” “
322076	322102	322117	322117	He	1653	” The trooper plants his legs wider apart , wets the palm of his broad right hand , and lays it on his imaginary moustache . “
322312	322319	322309	322310	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” the trooper resumes his march ; “
322380	322631	322378	322378	sir	9019	” Mr. George has been so excited , that he finds it necessary to wipe his forehead on his shirt - sleeve . Even while he whistles his impetuosity away with the National Anthem , some involuntary shakings of his head and heavings of his chest still linger behind ; not to mention an occasional hasty adjustment with both hands of his open shirt - collar , as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his being troubled by a choking sensation . In short , Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to . Jo and his conductor presently return , and Jo is assisted to his mattress by the careful Phil ; to whom , after due administration of medicine by his own hands , Allan confides all needful means and instructions . The morning is by this time getting on apace . He repairs to his lodgings to dress and breakfast ; and then , without seeking rest , goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his discovery . With him Mr. Jarndyce returns alone , confidentially telling him that there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed ; and showing a serious interest in it . To Mr. Jarndyce , Jo repeats in substance what he said in the morning ; without any material variation . Only , that cart of his is heavier to draw , and draws with a hollower sound . “
322645	322649	322633	322633	me	0	” falters Jo ; “
322724	322878	322879	322879	You	7076	” He makes so many of these references to the law - stationer in the course of a day or two , that Allan , after conferring with Mr. Jarndyce , good - naturedly resolves to call in Cook 's Court ; the rather , as the cart seems to be breaking down . To Cook 's Court , therefore , he repairs . Mr. Snagsby is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves , inspecting an Indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser 's ; an immense desert of law - hand and parchment , with here and there a resting - place of a few large letters , to break the awful monotony , and save the traveller from despair . Mr. Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells , and greets the stranger with his cough of general preparation for business . “
322888	322917	322879	322879	You	7076	” The stationer 's heart begins to thump heavily , for his old apprehensions have never abated . It is as much as he can do to answer , “
322953	322954	322945	322945	I	0	” “
322958	322963	322945	322945	I	0	” says Allan Woodcourt . “
322973	322974	322945	322945	I	0	” “
322981	322993	322945	322945	I	0	” thinks the afflicted stationer , as recollection breaks upon him . “
323008	323034	322945	322945	I	0	” But , he has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his visitor into the little counting - house , and to shut the door . “
323043	323044	322945	322945	I	0	” “
323051	323052	323054	323054	you	9019	” “
323062	323071	323054	323054	you	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby in a melancholy whisper , “
323100	323121	323122	323122	I	0	” In deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on his stool , with his back against his desk , protesting : “
323216	323247	323248	323248	You	7085	” His visitor professes his regret to hear it , and asks him does he remember Jo ? Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan , O do n't he ! “
323273	323282	323271	323271	Jo	440	” says Mr. Snagsby . Allan asks why ? “
323285	323307	323271	323271	Jo	440	” repeats Mr. Snagsby , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head , “
323338	323365	323315	323315	you	7085	” With this beneficent wish , Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal resignation , and submits himself to hear what the visitor has to communicate . “
323369	323397	323315	323315	you	7085	” says Mr. Snagsby , who , between the earnestness of his feelings , and the suppressed tones of his voice , is discolored in the face . “
323494	323552	323492	323492	sir	9019	” says Mr. Snagsby . But it is better than he expected , after all ; being no explosion of the mine below him , or deepening of the pit into which he has fallen . And being tender - hearted , and affected by the account he hears of Jo 's condition , he readily engages to “
323556	323671	323492	323492	sir	9019	” as early in the evening as he can manage it quietly . He looks round very quietly , when the evening comes ; but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a manager as he . Jo is very glad to see his old friend ; and says , when they are left alone , that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so far out of his way on accounts of sich as him . Mr. Snagsby , touched by the spectacle before him , immediately lays upon the table half - a - crown : that magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds . “
323683	323694	323695	323695	I	0	” inquires the stationer , with his cough of sympathy . “
323705	323709	323702	323702	I	0	” returns Jo , “
323751	323776	323777	323778	Mr. Sangsby	535	” The stationer softly lays down another half - crown , and asks him what it is that he is sorry for having done ? “
323780	323784	323777	323778	Mr. Sangsby	535	” says Jo , “
323979	324006	323976	323977	Mr. Sangsby	535	” The softened stationer deposits another half - crown on the table . Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings . “
324017	324021	324014	324015	Mr. Sangsby	535	” proceeds Jo , “
324035	324036	324025	324025	you	535	” “
324044	324049	324039	324039	Jo	440	” returns the stationer . “
324056	324063	324066	324068	my poor boy	2812	” says Jo , with eagerness . “
324070	324076	324066	324068	my poor boy	2812	” Jo laughs with pleasure . “
324215	324216	324212	324212	he	717	” “
324227	324232	324217	324217	It	7118	” Jo laughs again . “
324257	324417	324238	324238	Its	7119	” The meek little stationer , with a broken and unfinished cough , slips down his fourth halfcrown — he has never been so close to a case requiring so many — and is fain to depart . And Jo and he , upon this little earth , shall meet no more . No more . For the cart so hard to draw , is near its journey 's end , and drags over stony ground . All round the clock , it labours up the broken steeps , shattered and worn . Not many times can the sun rise , and behold it still upon its weary road . Phil Squod , with his smoky gunpowder visage , at once acts as nurse and works as armourer at his little table in a corner ; often looking round , and saying with a nod of his green baize cap , and an encouraging elevation of his one eyebrow , “
324427	324677	324680	324680	Jo	440	” There , too , is Mr. Jarndyce many a time , and Allan Woodcourt almost always ; both thinking , much , how strangely Fate has entangled this rough outcast in the web of very different lives . There too , the trooper is a frequent visitor ; filling the doorway with his athletic figure , and , from his superfluity of life and strength , seeming to shed down temporary vigor upon Jo , who never fails to speak more robustly in answer to his cheerful words . Jo is in a sleep or in a stupor to - day , and Allan Woodcourt , newly arrived , stands by him , looking down upon his wasted form . After a while , he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him — just as he sat in the law - writer 's room — and touches his chest and heart . The cart had very nearly given up , but labors on a little more . The trooper stands in the doorway , still and silent . Phil has stopped in a low clinking noise , with his little hammer in his hand , Mr. Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and attention on his face , and , glancing significantly at the trooper , signs to Phil to carry his table out . When the little hammer is next used , there will be a speck of rust upon it . “
324692	324693	324694	324694	I	0	” “
324697	324710	324711	324711	I	0	” says Jo , who has started , and is looking round , “
324734	324735	324736	324736	Nobody	928	” “
324738	324739	324736	324736	Nobody	928	” “
324758	324759	324756	324756	sir	9019	” “
324762	324770	324756	324756	sir	9019	” Jo closes his eyes , muttering , “
324776	324805	324806	324806	Jo	440	” After watching him closely a little while , Allan puts his mouth very near his ear , and says to him in a low , distinct voice : “
324815	324816	324809	324809	you	440	” “
324823	324824	324821	324821	sir	9019	” “
324833	324834	324837	324837	sir	9019	” “
324964	325018	324955	324955	I	0	” It takes him a long time to say this ; and few but an experienced and attentive listener could hear , or , hearing , understand him . After a short relapse into sleep or stupor , he makes , of a sudden , a strong effort to get out of bed . “
325026	325027	325063	325063	Jo	440	” “
325043	325051	325041	325041	sir	9019	” he returns with a wild look . “
325065	325066	325063	325063	Jo	440	” “
325171	325172	325177	325177	Jo	440	” “
325183	325184	325177	325177	Jo	440	” “

325297	325318	325319	325319	Jo	440	” Fast . The cart is shaken all to pieces , and the rugged road is very near its end . “
325325	325326	325319	325319	Jo	440	” “
325354	325355	325356	325356	Jo	440	” “

325442	326083	326084	326084	Rosa	370	” The light is come upon the dark benighted way . Dead ! Dead , your Majesty . Dead , my lords and gentlemen . Dead , Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every order . Dead , men and women , born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts . And dying thus around us , every day . THE place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again , and the house in town is awake . In Lincolnshire , the Dedlocks of the past doze in their picture - frames , and the low wind murmurs through the long drawingroom as if they were breathing pretty regularly . In town , the Dedlocks of the present rattle in their fire - eyed carriages through the darkness of the night , and the Dedlock Mercuries with ashes ( or hair - powder ) on their heads , symptomatic of their great humility , loll away the drowsy mornings in the little windows of the hall . The fashionable world — tremendous orb , nearly five miles round — is in full swing , and the solar system works respectfully at its appointed distances . Where the throng is thickest , where the lights are brightest , where all the senses are ministered to with the greatest delicacy and refinement , Lady Dedlock is . From the shining heights she has scaled and taken , she is never absent . Though the belief she of old reposed in herself , as one able to reserve whatsoever she would under her mantle of pride , is beaten down ; though she has no assurance that what she is to those around her , she will remain another day ; it is not in her nature , when envious eyes are looking on , to yield or to droop . They say of her , that she has lately grown more handsome and more haughty . The debilitated cousin says of her that she 's beauty nough — tsetup Shopofwomen — but rather larming kind — remindingmanfact — inconvenient woman — who will getoutofbedandbawthstablishment — Shakspeare . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , looks nothing . Now , as heretofore , he is to be found in doorways of rooms , with his limp white cravat loosely twisted into its old - fashioned tie , receiving patronage from the Peerage and making no sign . Of all men he is still the last who might be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady . Of all women she is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him . One thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his turret - room at Chesney Wold . She is now decided , and prepared to throw it off . It is morning in the great world ; afternoon according to the little sun . The Mercuries , exhausted by looking out of window , are reposing in the hall ; and hang their heavy heads , the gorgeous creatures , like overblown sun - flowers . Like them too , they seem to run to a deal of seed in their tags and trimmings . Sir Leicester , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country , over the report of a Parliamentary committee . My Lady sits in the room in which she gave audience to the young man of the name of Guppy . Rosa is with her , and has been writing for her and reading to her . Rosa is now at work upon embroidery , or some such pretty thing ; and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence . Not for the first time to - day . “
326086	326109	326084	326084	Rosa	370	” The pretty village face looks brightly up . Then , seeing how serious my Lady is , looks puzzled and surprised . “
326119	326135	326084	326084	Rosa	370	” Yes . She goes to it and returns , and looks yet more surprised . “
326196	326209	326180	326180	I	0	” The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be trustworthy . “
326214	326229	326231	326231	you	370	” Lady Dedlock asks her , signing to her to bring her chair nearer ; “
326250	326251	326254	326255	my Lady	996	” “
326273	326274	326275	326275	You	370	” “
326292	326316	326289	326290	poor child	7164	” She says it with a kind of scorn — though not of Rosa — and sits brooding , looking dreamily at her . “
326362	326363	326364	326364	I	0	” “
326391	326392	326385	326385	I	0	” “
326400	326430	326385	326385	I	0	” The pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure , by the dark expression on the handsome face before it . It looks timidly for an explanation . “
326468	326469	326470	326470	My	0	” “
326478	326479	326470	326470	My	0	” “
326486	326526	326527	326527	I	0	” Rosa bends down on the footstool at my Lady 's feet . My Lady , with that motherly touch of the famous Ironmaster night , lays her hand upon her dark hair , and gently keeps it there . “
326633	326674	326626	326626	I	0	” The weeping girl covers her hand with kisses , and says what shall she do , what shall she do , when they are separated ! Her mistress kisses her on the cheek , and makes no other answer . “
326692	326693	326696	326697	my Lady	996	” “
326716	326717	326718	326718	I	0	” “
326720	326721	326718	326718	I	0	” “
326749	326750	326751	326751	I	0	” “
326823	326940	326941	326942	Sir Leicester	290	” She detaches herself from her simple - hearted companion , and leaves the room . Late in the afternoon , when she next appears upon the staircase , she is in her haughtiest and coldest state . As indifferent as if all passion , feeling , and interest , had been worn out in the earlier ages of the world , and had perished from its surface with its other departed monsters . Mercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell , which is the cause of her appearance . Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library ; but she repairs to the library . Sir Leicester is there , and she wishes to speak to him first . “
326953	326984	326985	326985	I	0	” O dear no ! Not at all . Only Mr. Tulkinghorn . Always at hand . Haunting every place . No relief or security from him for a moment . “
327000	327008	326994	326994	you	290	” With a look that plainly says , “
327021	327405	327009	327009	You	290	” she tells him it is not necessary , and moves towards a chair . Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her with his clumsy bow , and retires into a window opposite . Interposed between her and the fading light of day in the now quiet street , his shadow falls upon her , and he darkens all before her . Even so does he darken her life . It is a dull street , under the best conditions ; where the two long rows of houses stare at each other with that severity ; that half a dozen of its greatest mansions seem to have been slowly stared into stone , rather than originally built in that material . It is a street of such dismal grandeur , so determined not to condescend to liveliness , that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in black paint and dust , and the echoing mews behind have a dry and massive appearance , as if they were reserved to stable the stone chargers of noble statues . Complicated garnish of iron - work entwines itself over the flights of steps in this awful street ; and , from these petrified bowers , extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the upstart gas . Here and there a weak little iron hoop , through which bold boys aspire to throw their friends ' caps ( its only present use ) , retains its place among the rusty foliage , sacred to the memory of departed oil . Nay , even oil itself , yet lingering at long intervals in a little absurd glass pot , with a knob in the bottom like an oyster , blinks and sulks at newer lights every night , like its high and dry master in the House of Lords . Therefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock , seated in her chair , could wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands . And yet — and yet — she sends a look in that direction , as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure removed out of the way . Sir Leicester begs his Lady 's pardon . She was about to say ? “
327445	327446	327436	327436	I	0	” “
327456	327466	327449	327449	I	0	” demands Sir Leicester , in some considerable doubt . “
327488	327489	327480	327480	you	0	” “
327505	327520	327522	327524	the iron gentleman	7183	” says Sir Leicester , to Mercury , not immediately remembering the business term , “
327530	327555	327556	327556	I	0	” Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him . Sir Leicester receives that ferruginous person , graciously . “
327584	327598	327581	327582	Mr. Rouncewell	366	” Sir Leicester skilfully transfers him with a solemn wave of his hand , “
327608	327609	327606	327606	Hem	588	” “
327616	327622	327610	327610	I	0	” returns the iron gentleman , “
327639	327692	327630	327631	Lady Dedlock	288	” As he turns towards her , he finds that the impression she makes upon him is less agreeable than on the former occasion . A distant supercilious air makes a cold atmosphere about her ; and there is nothing in her bearing , as there was before , to encourage openness . “
327697	327704	327706	327706	I	0	” says Lady Dedlock , listlessly , “
327727	327750	327757	327758	Lady Dedlock	288	” It is almost too troublesome to her languid eyes to bestow a look upon him , as she asks this question . “
327786	327797	327800	327800	you	288	” The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis . “
327802	327803	327800	327800	you	288	” “
327811	327858	327808	327808	I	0	” Sir Leicester gives a nod , approving and confirmatory . Very proper . The iron gentleman having said that he would do it , was bound to do it . No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious . Highly proper . “
327866	327867	327862	327862	he	2784	” “
327929	327977	327917	327917	I	0	” Sir Leicester has a misgiving that there may be a hidden Wat Tylerish meaning in this expression , and fumes a little . Mr. Rouncewell is perfectly good - humoured and polite ; but , within such limits , evidently adapts his tone to his reception . “
327980	327985	327986	327986	I	0	” proceeds my Lady , “
328000	328001	328002	328002	I	0	” “
328011	328012	328002	328002	I	0	” “
328029	328034	328017	328018	Sir Leicester	290	” Sir Leicester flattered ; “
328066	328067	328052	328052	I	0	” “
328083	328084	328075	328076	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
328091	328092	328075	328076	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
328099	328105	328075	328076	Lady Dedlock	288	” Sir Leicester considerately interposes , “
328131	328152	328127	328129	a young woman	1426	” says Sir Leicester , magnificently laying out the matter with his right hand , like a service of plate , “
328243	328265	328240	328240	she	3466	” Sir Leicester , with an apologetic but dignified inclination of his head towards the ironmaster , winds up his sentence ; “
328296	328297	328298	328298	I	0	” “
328303	328312	328300	328300	your	0	” interposes Mr. Rouncewell 's son 's father . “
328368	328415	328350	328350	you	0	” Dismiss the Dedlock patronage from consideration ? O ! Sir Leicester is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him through such a family , or he really might have mistrusted their report of the iron gentleman 's observations . “
328421	328440	328350	328350	you	0	” observes my Lady , in her coldest manner , before he can do anything but breathe amazedly , “
328503	328550	328552	328553	Sir Leicester	290	” Sir Leicester begs to observe , that wholly alters the case . He might have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in support of her view . He entirely agrees with my Lady . The young woman had better go . “
328571	328577	328613	328613	you	366	” Lady Dedlock languidly proceeds , “
328640	328641	328637	328637	you	366	” “
328651	328652	328646	328646	I	0	” “
328657	328658	328660	328660	I	0	” “
328683	328684	328660	328660	I	0	” “
328691	328701	328704	328704	I.	0	” she returns , with the same studied carelessness , “
328716	328725	328709	328709	you	366	” The iron gentleman makes an iron bow . “
328733	328746	328750	328750	you	290	” Mr. Tulkinghorn steps forward from his window and pulls the bell . “
328755	328831	328753	328753	you	290	” He makes his usual bow , and goes quietly back again . Mercury , swift - responsive , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , skims away , produces the aforesaid , and departs . Rosa has been crying , and is yet in distress . On her coming in , the ironmaster leaves his chair , takes her arm in his , and remains with her near the door ready to depart . “
328841	328851	328832	328832	You	290	” says my Lady , in her weary manner , “
328879	328885	328887	328888	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ She seems after all , ”
328900	328910	328895	328895	his	293	“ as if she were crying at going away . ”
328911	328924	328937	328937	he	366	“ Why , she is not well - bred , you see , ”
328948	328978	328937	328937	he	366	“ and she is an inexperienced little thing , and knows no better . If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . ”
328979	328983	328985	328986	Mr. Tulkinghorn	293	“ No doubt , ”
329032	329040	329042	329043	the ironmaster	4726	“ Out , you silly little puss ! ”
329056	329068	329042	329043	the ironmaster	4726	“ have a spirit , if you 're fond of Wat ! ”
329080	329096	329069	329070	My Lady	996	“ There , there , child ! You are a good girl . Go way ! ”
329145	329152	329154	329155	Mr. Rouncewell	366	“ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , ”
329165	329306	329154	329155	Mr. Rouncewell	366	“ I beg to take my leave , with an apology for having again troubled you , though not of my own act , on this tiresome subject . I can very well understand , I assure you , how tiresome so small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock . If I am doubtful of my dealing with it , it is only because I did not at first quietly exert my influence to take my young friend here away , without troubling you at all . But it appeared to me — I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing — that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood , and candid to consult your wishes and convenience . I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . ”
329320	329324	329325	329325	he	290	“ Mr. Rouncewell , ”
329328	329345	329325	329325	he	290	“ do not mention it . Justifications are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . “
329453	329592	329594	329594	she	7222	” If he mean this ironically , it may be truer than he thinks . He points it , however , by no deviation from his straightforward manner of speech , though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim room where my Lady sits . Sir Leicester stands to return his parting salutation , Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings , Mercury takes another flight , and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house . Then lights are brought in , discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still standing in his window with his hands behind him , and my Lady still sitting with his figure before her , closing up her view of the night as well as of the day . She is very pale . Mr. Tulkinghorn observing it as she rises to retire , thinks , “
329616	329860	329606	329606	She	14725	” But he can act a part too — his one unchanging character — and as he holds the door open for this woman , fifty pairs of eyes , each fifty times sharper than Sir Leicester 's pair , should find no flaw in him . Lady Dedlock dines alone in her own room to - day . Sir Leicester is whipped in to the rescue of the Doodle Party , and the discomfiture of the Coodle Faction . Lady Dedlock asks , on sitting down to dinner , still deadly pale , ( and quite an illustration of the debilitated cousin 's text ) , whether he is gone out ? Yes . Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn is gone yet ? No . Presently she asks again , is he gone yet ? No . What is he doing ? Mercury thinks he is writing letters in the library . Would my Lady wish to see him ? Anything but that . But he wishes to see my Lady . Within a few more minutes , he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ? My Lady will receive him now . He comes now , apologising for intruding , even by her permission , while she is at table . When they are alone , my Lady waves her hand to dispense with such mockeries . “
329868	329869	329863	329863	you	7224	” “
329875	329908	329872	329873	Lady Dedlock	288	” says the lawyer , taking a chair at a little distance from her , and slowly rubbing his rusty legs up and down , up and down , up and down ; “
329920	329921	329909	329909	I	0	” “
329924	329925	329957	329958	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
329976	330026	329969	329969	I	0	” He stops in his rubbing , and looks at her , with his hands on his knees . Imperturbable and unchangeable as he is , there is still an indefinable freedom in his manner , which is new , and which does not escape this woman 's observation . “
330034	330035	329969	329969	I	0	” “
330071	330072	330066	330066	you	7224	” “
330077	330078	330075	330075	sir	9019	” “
330133	330134	330137	330137	sir	9019	” “
330139	330140	330137	330137	sir	9019	” “
330146	330160	330161	330161	I	0	” returns the lawyer , crossing his legs and nursing the uppermost knee , “
330262	330263	330256	330257	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
330268	330272	330266	330266	sir	9019	” she begins , “
330280	330286	330266	330266	sir	9019	” But he interrupts her . “
330363	330364	330350	330351	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
330449	330491	330434	330438	no one in the world	14997	” This she says with great deliberation and distinctness , and with no more outward passion than himself . As for him , he methodically discusses his matter of business , as if she were any insensible instrument used in business . “
330501	330505	330495	330495	you	9019	” he returns , “
330545	330546	330498	330499	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
330570	330571	330552	330552	I	0	” “
330574	330588	330552	330552	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , coolly getting up and standing on the hearth . “
330711	330753	330754	330755	This woman	14725	” She has been looking at the table . She lifts up her eyes , and looks at him . There is a stern expression on her face , and a part of her lower lip is compressed under her teeth . “
330759	330772	330754	330755	This woman	14725	” Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks , as she lets her glance fall again . “
330785	330858	330859	330860	This woman	14725	” For a little while they are silent . Lady Dedlock has eaten no dinner , but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it . She rises from table , takes a lounging - chair , and reclines in it , shading her face . There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion . It is thoughtful , gloomy , concentrated . “
330862	330881	330859	330860	This woman	14725	” thinks Mr. Tulkinghorn , standing on the hearth , again a dark object closing up her view , “
330886	330942	330859	330860	This woman	14725	” He studies her at his leisure , not speaking for a time . She , too , studies something at her leisure . She is not the first to speak ; appearing indeed so unlikely to be so , though he stood there until midnight , that even he is driven upon breaking silence . “
330991	330992	330993	330993	I	0	” “
330998	331005	330993	330993	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head . “
331019	331035	331016	331017	Lady Dedlock	288	” She stops him as he is moving out of the room , by asking , “
331052	331053	331058	331058	you	288	” “
331097	331098	331099	331099	You	288	” “
331108	331109	331099	331099	You	288	” “
331116	331117	331099	331099	You	288	” “
331128	331129	331119	331119	you	288	” “
331134	331154	331119	331119	you	288	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , with a slight smile , and cautiously shaking his head at the shaded face . “
331162	331163	331119	331119	you	288	” “
331168	331169	331174	331174	I	0	” “
331248	331281	331242	331242	I	0	” She removes her hand , turns her pale face towards him as he walks silently to the door , and stops him once again as he is about to open it . “
331309	331310	331303	331303	you	288	” “
331321	331388	331316	331316	I	0	” She bows her eyes rather than her head , the movement is so slight and curious ; and he withdraws . Clear of the room , he looks at his watch , but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts . There is a splendid clock upon the staircase , famous , as splendid clocks not often are , for its accuracy . “
331395	331404	331392	331392	you	288	” Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires , referring to it . “
331410	331416	331407	331407	you	288	” If it said now , “
331421	331464	331407	331407	you	288	” ! What a famous clock , hereafter , if it said to - night of all the nights that it has counted off , to this old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it , “
331469	331490	331493	331493	you	288	” ! With its sharp clear bell , it strikes three - quarters after seven , and ticks on again . “
331501	331512	331493	331493	you	288	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , muttering reproof to his watch . “
331527	331542	331520	331520	you	288	” What a watch to return good for evil , if it ticked in answer “
331547	331635	331520	331520	you	288	” ! He passes out into the streets , and walks on , with his hands behind him , under the shadow of the lofty houses , many of whose mysteries , difficulties , mortgages , delicate affairs of all kinds , are treasured up within his old black satin waistcoat . He is in the confidence of the very bricks and mortar . The high chimney - stacks telegraph family secrets to him . Yet there is not a voice in a mile of them to whisper “
331641	331705	331520	331520	you	288	” Through the stir and motion of the commoner streets ; through the roar and jar of many vehicles , many feet , many voices ; with the blazing shop - lights lighting him on , the west wind blowing him on , and the crowd pressing him on ; he is pitilessly urged upon his way , and nothing meets him , murmuring “
331711	331770	331520	331520	you	288	” Arrived at last in his dull room , to light his candles , and look round and up , and see the Roman pointing from the ceiling , there is no new significance in the Roman 's hand to - night , or in the flutter of the attendant groupes , to give him the late warning , “
331776	332984	332986	332986	he	7261	” It is a moonlight night ; but the moon , being past the full , is only now rising over the great wilderness of London . The stars are shining as they shone above the turret - leads at Chesney Wold . This woman , as he has of late been so accustomed to call her , looks out upon them . Her soul is turbulent within her ; she is sick at heart , and restless . The large rooms are too cramped and close . She can not endure their restraint , and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden . Too capricious and imperious in all she does , to be the cause of much surprise in those about her as to anything she does , this woman , loosely muffled , goes out into the moonlight . Mercury attends with the key . Having opened the garden gate , he delivers the key into his Lady 's hand at her request , and is bidden to go back . She will walk there some time , to ease her aching head . She may be an hour ; she may be more . She needs no further escort . The gate shuts upon its spring with a clash , and he leaves her , passing on into the dark shade of some trees . A fine night , and a bright large moon , and multitudes of stars . Mr. Tulkinghorn , in repairing to his cellar , and in opening and shutting those resounding doors , has to cross a little prison - like yard . He looks up casually , thinking what a fine night , what a bright large moon , what multitudes of stars ! A quiet night , too . A very quiet night . When the moon shines very brilliantly , a solitude and stillness seem to proceed from her , that influence even crowded places full of life . Not only is it a still night on dusty high roads and on hill - summits , whence a wide expanse of country may be seen in repose , quieter and quieter as it spreads away into a fringe of trees against the sky , with the grey ghost of a bloom upon them ; not only is it a still night in gardens and in woods , and on the river where the water - meadows are fresh and green , and the stream sparkles on among pleasant islands , murmuring weirs , and whispering rushes ; not only does the stillness attend it as it flows where houses cluster thick , where many bridges are reflected in it , where wharves and shipping make it black and awful , where it winds from these disfigurements through marshes whose grim beacons stand like skeletons washed ashore , where it expands through the bolder region of rising grounds rich in corn - field windmill and steeple , and where it mingles with the ever - heaving sea ; not only is it a still night on the deep , and on the shore where the watcher stands to see the ship with her spread wings cross the path of light that appears to be presented to only him ; but even on this stranger 's wilderness of London there is some rest . Its steeples and towers , and its one great dome , grow more ethereal ; its smoky house - tops lose their grossness , in the pale effulgence ; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are softened , and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly away . In these fields of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's inhabiting , where the shepherds play on Chancery pipes that have no stop , and keep their sheep in the fold by hook and by crook until they have shorn them exceeding close , every noise is merged , this moonlight night , into a distant ringing hum , as if the city were a vast glass , vibrating . What 's that ? Who fired a gun or pistol ? Where was it ? The few foot - passengers start , stop , and stare about them . Some windows and doors are opened , and people come out to look . It was a loud report , and echoed and rattled heavily . It shook one house , or so a man says who was passing . It has aroused all the dogs in the neighbourhood , who bark vehemently . Terrified cats scamper across the road . While the dogs are yet barking and howling — there is one dog howling like a demon — the church - clocks , as if they were startled too , begin to strike . The hum from the streets , likewise , seems to swell into a shout . But it is soon over . Before the last clock begins to strike ten , there is lull . When it has ceased , the fine night , the bright large moon , and multitudes of stars , are left at peace again . Has Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed ? His windows are dark and quiet , and his door is shut . It must be something unusual indeed , to bring him out of his shell . Nothing is heard of him , nothing is seen of him . What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immoveable composure ? For many years , the persistent Roman has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling . It is not likely that he has any new meaning in him to - night . Once pointing , always pointing — like any Roman , or even Briton , with a single idea . There he is , no doubt , in his impossible attitude , pointing , unavailingly , all night long . Moonlight , darkness , dawn , sunrise , day . There he is still , eagerly pointing , and no one minds him . But , a little after the coming of the day , come people to clean the rooms . And either the Roman has some new meaning in him , not expressed before , or the foremost of them goes wild ; for , looking up at his outstretched hand , and looking down at what is below it , that person shrieks and flies . The others , looking in as the first one looked , shriek and fly too , and there is an alarm in the street . What does it mean ? No light is admitted into the darkened chamber , and people unaccustomed to it , enter , and treading softly , but heavily , carry a weight into the bed - room , and lay it down . There is whispering and wondering all day , strict search of every corner , careful tracing of steps , and careful noting of the disposition of every article of furniture . All eyes look up at the Roman , and all voices murmur , “
332994	334073	332986	332986	he	7261	” He is pointing at a table , with a bottle ( nearly full of wine ) and a glass upon it , and two candles that were blown out suddenly , soon after being lighted . He is pointing at an empty chair , and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand . These objects lie directly within his range . An excited imagination might suppose that there was something in them so terrific , as to drive the rest of the composition , not only the attendant big - legged boys , but the clouds and flowers and pillars too — in short , the very body and soul of Allegory , and all the brains it has — stark mad . It happens surely , that every one who comes into the darkened room and looks at these things , looks up at the Roman , and that he is invested in all eyes with mystery and awe , as if he were a paralysed dumb witness . So , it shall happen surely , through many years to come , that ghostly stories shall be told of the stain upon the floor , so easy to be covered , so hard to be got out ; and that the Roman , pointing from the ceiling , shall point , so long as dust and damp and spiders spare him , with far greater significance than he ever had in Mr. Tulkinghorn 's time , and with a deadly meaning . For , Mr. Tulkinghorn 's time is over for evermore ; and the Roman pointed at the murderous hand uplifted against his life , and pointed helplessly at him , from night to morning , lying face downward on the floor , shot through the heart . A GREAT annual occasion has come round in the establishment of Mr. Joseph Bagnet , otherwise Lignum Vitæ , ex - artilleryman and present bassoon - player . An occasion of feasting and festival . The celebration of a birthday in the family . It is not Mr. Bagnet 's birthday . Mr. Bagnet merely distinguishes that epoch in the musical instrument business , by kissing the children with an extra smack before breakfast , smoking an additional pipe after dinner , and wondering towards evening what his poor old mother is thinking about it,—a subject of infinite speculation , and rendered so by his mother having departed this life , twenty years . Some men rarely revert to their father , but seem , in the bank - books of their remembrance , to have transferred all their stock of filial affection into their mother 's name . Mr. Bagnet is one of these . Perhaps his exalted appreciation of the merits of the old girl , causes him usually to make the noun - substantive , Goodness , of the feminine gender . It is not the birthday of one of the three children . Those occasions are kept with some marks of distinction , but they rarely overleap the bounds of happy returns and a pudding . On young Woolwich 's last birthday , Mr. Bagnet certainly did , after observing upon his growth and general advancement , proceed , in a moment of profound reflection on the changes wrought by time , to examine him in the catechism ; accomplishing with extreme accuracy the questions number one and two , What is your name ? and Who gave you that name ? but there failing in the exact precision of his memory , and substituting for number three , the question And how do you like that name ? which he propounded with a sense of its importance , in itself so edifying and improving , as to give it quite an orthodox air . This , however , was a speciality on that particular birthday , and not a generic solemnity . It is the old girl 's birthday ; and that is the greatest holiday and reddest - letter day in Mr. Bagnet 's calendar . The auspicious event is always commemorated according to certain forms , settled and prescribed by Mr. Bagnet some years since . Mr. Bagnet being deeply convinced that to have a pair of fowls for dinner is to attain the highest pitch of imperial luxury , invariably goes forth himself very early in the morning of this day to buy a pair ; he is , as invariably , taken in by the vendor , and installed in the possession of the oldest inhabitants of any coop in Europe . Returning with these triumphs of toughness tied up in a clean blue and white cotton handkerchief ( essential to the arrangements ) , he in a casual manner invites Mrs. Bagnet to declare at breakfast what she would like for dinner . Mrs. Bagnet , by a coincidence never known to fail , replying Fowls , Mr. Bagnet instantly produces his bundle from a place of concealment , amidst general amazement and rejoicing . He further requires that the old girl shall do nothing all day long , but sit in her very best gown , and be served by himself and the young people . As he is not illustrious for his cookery , this may be supposed to be a matter of state rather than enjoyment on the old girl 's part ; but she keeps her state with all imaginable cheerfulness . On this present birthday , Mr. Bagnet has accomplished the usual preliminaries . He has bought two specimens of poultry , which , if there be any truth in adages , were certainly not caught with chaff , to be prepared for the spit ; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by their unlooked - for production ; he is himself directing the roasting of the poultry ; and Mrs. Bagnet , with her wholesome brown fingers itching to prevent what she sees going wrong , sits in her gown of ceremony , an honored guest . Quebec and Malta lay the cloth for dinner , while Woolwich , serving , as beseems him , under his father , keeps the fowls revolving . To these young scullions Mrs. Bagnet occasionally imparts a wink , or a shake of the head , or a crooked face , as they make mistakes . “
334080	334085	332986	332986	he	7261	” Says Mr. Bagnet . “
334095	334120	334121	334121	You	7263	” Mrs. Bagnet , with anguish , beholds one of them at a stand - still before the fire , and beginning to burn . “
334130	334135	334121	334121	You	7263	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
334141	334258	334259	334259	George	562	” Mrs. Bagnet shows her white teeth cheerfully , but to the perception of her son betrays so much uneasiness of spirit , that he is impelled by the dictates of affection to ask her , with his eyes , what is the matter?—thus standing , with his eyes wide open , more oblivious of the fowls than before , and not affording the least hope of a return to consciousness . Fortunately , his elder sister perceives the cause of the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet 's breast , and with an admonitory poke recalls him . The stopped fowls going round again , Mrs. Bagnet closes her eyes , in the intensity of her relief . “
334265	334270	334259	334259	George	562	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
334297	334298	334289	334289	George	562	” “
334330	334342	334343	334344	Old girl	12874	” returns Mrs. Bagnet , laughing , and shaking her head . “
334346	334351	334343	334344	Old girl	12874	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
334379	334410	334412	334412	you	7271	” Quebec and Malta here exclaim , with clapping of hands , that Bluffy is sure to bring mother something , and begin to speculate on what it will be . “
334417	334433	334412	334412	you	7271	” says Mrs. Bagnet , casting a glance on the table - cloth , and winking “
334436	334455	334456	334456	I	0	” at Malta with her right eye , and shaking the pepper away from Quebec with her head ; “
334468	334469	334470	334470	George	562	” “
334472	334477	334514	334514	I	0	” returns Mr. Bagnet , “
334499	334500	334507	334507	I	0	” “
334541	334547	334536	334536	he	562	” Mr. Bagnet asks why ? “
334550	334557	334536	334536	he	562	” returns his wife , considering , “
334608	334615	334617	334618	Mr. Bagnet	721	” He 's extra - drilled , ”
334620	334632	334617	334618	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ By a lawyer . Who would put the devil out . ”
334633	334640	334641	334642	his wife	9148	“ There 's something in that , ”
334645	334653	334641	334642	his wife	9148	“ but so it is , Lignum . ”
335261	335267	335257	335258	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ George ! Military time . ”
335301	335307	335309	335310	Mr. George	562	“ Happy returns to all ! ”
335312	335320	335322	335323	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ But , George , old man ! ”
335330	335337	335322	335323	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ What 's come to you ? ”
335338	335343	335309	335310	Mr. George	562	“ Come to me ? ”
335344	335369	335322	335323	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Ah ! you are so white , George — for you — and look so shocked . Now do n't he , Lignum ? ”
335370	335373	335375	335376	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ George , ”
335378	335389	335375	335376	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ tell the old girl . What 's the matter . ”
335390	335399	335401	335402	the trooper	11982	“ I did n't know I looked white , ”
335411	335454	335401	335402	the trooper	11982	“ and I did n't know I looked shocked , and I 'm sorry I do . But the truth is , that boy who was taken in at my place died yesterday afternoon , and it has rather knocked me over . ”
335455	335459	335461	335462	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Poor creetur ! ”
335470	335479	335461	335462	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Is he gone ? Dear , dear ! ”
335480	335524	335526	335527	the trooper	11982	“ I did n't mean to say anything about it , for it 's not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down . I should have roused up in a minute , ”
335535	335545	335526	335527	the trooper	11982	“ but you 're so quick , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
335546	335555	335557	335558	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ You 're right ! The old girl , ”
335560	335568	335557	335558	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Is as quick . As powder . ”
335569	335590	335592	335593	Mr. George	562	“ And what 's more , she 's the subject of the day , and we 'll stick to her , ”
335595	335635	335592	335593	Mr. George	562	“ See here , I have brought a little brooch along with me . It 's a poor thing , you know , but it 's a keepsake . That 's all the good it is , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
335666	335670	335672	335673	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Old girl , ”
335675	335683	335672	335673	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Tell him my opinion of it . ”
335684	335694	335695	335696	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Why , it 's a wonder , George ! ”
335699	335710	335695	335696	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ It 's the beautifullest thing that ever was seen ! ”
335711	335714	335716	335717	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Good ! ”
335719	335723	335716	335717	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ My opinion . ”
335724	335732	335734	335735	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ It 's so pretty , George , ”
335752	335761	335734	335735	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ that it seems too choice for me . ”
335762	335765	335767	335768	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Bad ! ”
335770	335775	335767	335768	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Not my opinion . ”
335776	335790	335792	335793	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ But whatever it is , a hundred thousand thanks , old fellow , ”
335809	335862	335802	335802	her	606	“ and though I have been a cross - grained soldier 's wife to you sometimes , George , we are as strong friends I am sure , in reality , as ever can be . Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will George . ”
335913	335927	335906	335906	her	606	“ O Lignum , Lignum , what a precious old chap you are ! ”
335950	335957	335959	335959	he	11982	“ Would any one believe this ? ”
335971	335988	335959	335959	he	11982	“ I am so out of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this ! ”
336035	336046	336048	336048	she	606	“ If that do n't bring you round , George , ”
336050	336072	336048	336048	she	606	“ just throw your eye across here at your present now and then , and the two together must do it . ”
336073	336082	336083	336083	George	562	“ You ought to do it of yourself , ”
336086	336144	336083	336083	George	562	“ I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet . I 'll tell you how , one way and another , the blues have got to be too many for me . Here was this poor lad . ' Twas dull work to see him dying as he did , and not be able to help him . ”
336145	336165	336048	336048	she	606	“ What do you mean , George ? You did help him . You took him under your roof . ”
336166	336219	336083	336083	George	562	“ I helped him so far , but that 's little . I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left . And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . ”
336220	336226	336228	336229	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Ah , poor creetur ! ”
336231	336234	336236	336237	the trooper	11982	“ Then , ”
336254	336341	336236	336237	the trooper	11982	“ that brought up Gridley in a man 's mind . His was a bad case too , in a different way . Then the two got mixed up in a man 's mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both . And to think of that rusty carbine , stock and barrel , standing up on end in his corner , hard , indifferent , taking everything so evenly — it made flesh and blood tingle , I do assure you . ”
336342	336348	336350	336351	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ My advice to you , ”
336353	336378	336350	336351	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ is to light your pipe , and tingle that way . It 's wholesomer and comfortabler , and better for the health altogether . ”
336379	336384	336386	336387	the trooper	11982	“ You 're right , ”
336389	336396	336386	336387	the trooper	11982	“ and I 'll do it ! ”
336462	336466	336454	336455	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ the mixtur , ”
336502	336535	336492	336492	He	721	“ George . Woolwich . Quebec . Malta . This is her birthday . Take a day 's march . And you wo n't find such another . Here 's towards her ! ”
336565	336570	336572	336574	the old girl	12856	“ And wishing yours ! ”
336611	336617	336595	336595	she	12856	“ Here 's a man ! ”
336679	336682	336684	336685	the man	1653	“ George , ”
336689	336696	336684	336685	the man	1653	“ how do you find yourself ? ”
336697	336704	336706	336707	Mr. George	562	“ Why , it 's Bucket ! ”
336709	336712	336714	336715	the man	1653	“ Yes , ”
336724	336827	336829	336830	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I was going down the street here , when I happened to stop and look in at the musical instruments in the shop window — a friend of mine is in wants of a second - hand wiolinceller , of a good tone — and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I thought I could n't be mistaken . How goes the world with you , George , at the present moment ? Pretty smooth ? And with you , ma'am ? And with you , governor ? And Lord ! ”
336836	336884	336829	336830	Mr. Bucket	734	“ here 's children too ! You may do anything with me , if you only show me children . Give us a kiss , my pets . No occasion to inquire who your father and mother is . Never saw such a likeness in my life ! ”
336909	336914	336916	336917	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You pretty dears , ”
336919	336970	336916	336917	Mr. Bucket	734	“ give us another kiss ; it 's the only thing I 'm greedy in . Lord bless you , how healthy you look ! And what may be the ages of these two , ma'am ? I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . ”
336971	336979	336981	336982	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ You 're very near , sir , ”
336984	336990	336992	336993	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I generally am near , ”
336995	337059	337061	337062	Mr. Bucket	734	“ being so fond of children . A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em , ma'am , all by one mother , and she 's still as fresh and rosy as the morning . Not so much so as yourself , but , upon my soul , she comes near you ! And what do you call these , my darling ? ”
337069	337125	337061	337062	Mr. Bucket	734	“ These are peaches , these are . Bless your heart ! And what do you think about father ? Do you think father could recommend a second - hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket 's friend , my dear ? My name 's Bucket . Ai n't that a funny name ? ”
337205	337212	337214	337215	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not in his usual spirits ? ”
337217	337270	337214	337215	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why , I never heard of such a thing ! What 's the matter , George ? You do n't intend to tell me you 've been out of spirits . What should you be out of spirits for ? You have n't got anything on your mind , you know . ”
337271	337275	337277	337278	the trooper	11982	“ Nothing particular , ”
337280	337286	337288	337289	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I should think not , ”
337291	337362	337288	337289	Mr. Bucket	734	“ What could you have on your mind , you know ! And have these pets got anything on their minds , eh ? Not they ; but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low - spirited . I ai n't much of a prophet , but I can tell you that , ma'am . ”
337379	337384	337386	337387	Mr. Bucket	734	“ There , ma'am ! ”
337389	337466	337386	337387	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Would you believe it ? No , I have n't . My wife , and a lodger , constitute my family . Mrs. Bucket is as fond of children as myself , and as wishful to have 'em ; but no . So it is . Worldly goods are divided unequally , and man must not repine . What a very nice back yard , ma'am ! Any way out of that yard , now ? ”
337476	337482	337484	337485	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Ai n't there really ? ”
337487	337549	337484	337485	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I should have thought there might have been . Well , I do n't know as I ever saw a back yard that took my fancy more . Would you allow me to look at it ? Thank you . No , I see there 's no way out . But what a very good - proportioned yard it is ! ”
337580	337590	337573	337574	Mr. George	562	“ How are your spirits , now , George ? ”
337591	337596	337598	337599	the trooper	11982	“ All right now , ”
337601	337607	337609	337610	Mr. Bucket	734	“ That 's your sort ! ”
337612	337677	337609	337610	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why should you ever have been otherwise ? A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to be out of spirits . That ai n't a chest to be out of spirits , is it , ma'am ? And you have n't got anything on your mind , you know , George ; what could you have on your mind ! ”
337735	337747	337749	337750	Mr. Bucket	734	“ And this is brother , is it , my dears ? ”
337766	337793	337749	337750	Mr. Bucket	734	“ And a nice brother he is — half brother I mean to say . For he 's too old to be your boy , ma'am . ”
337794	337809	337811	337812	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ I can certify at all events that he is not anybody else 's , ”
337816	337861	337811	337812	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Well , you do surprise me ! Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying . Lord , he 's wonderfully like you ! But about what you may call the brow , you know , there his father comes out ! ”
337900	337908	337910	337911	Mr. Bucket	734	“ George 's godson , is he ? ”
337917	337960	337961	337962	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ I must shake hands over again with George 's godson . Godfather and godson do credit to one another . And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ? Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? ”
337966	337973	337961	337962	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Plays the Fife . Beautiful . ”
337974	337982	337984	337985	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Would you believe it , governor , ”
337992	338049	337984	337985	Mr. Bucket	734	“ that when I was a boy I played the fife myself ? Not in a scientific way , as I expect he does , but by ear . Lord bless you ! British Grenadiers — there 's a tune to warm an Englishman up ! Could you give us British Grenadiers , my fine fellow ? ”
338099	338108	338080	338081	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Brit Ish Gra - a - anadeers ! ”
338205	338215	338219	338219	he	734	“ Believe me if all those endearing young charms . ”
338653	338671	338632	338632	He	734	“ Respecting that second - hand wiolinceller , governor — could you recommend me such a thing ? ”
338672	338675	338677	338678	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ Scores , ”
338680	338687	338677	338678	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ I am obliged to you , ”
338696	338751	338753	338754	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 're a friend in need . A good tone , mind you ! My friend is a regular dab at it . Ecod , he saws away at Mo - zart and Handel , and the rest of the big - wigs , like a thorough workman . And you need n't , ”
338763	338825	338753	338754	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you need n't commit yourself to too low a figure , governor . I do n't want to pay too large a price for my friend ; but I want you to have your proper percentage , and be remunerated for your loss of time . That is but fair . Every man must live , and ought to it . ”
338848	338884	338886	338887	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Suppose I was to give you a look in , say at half arter ten to - morrow morning . Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone ? ”
338924	338928	338930	338931	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Thank you , ”
338933	338971	338930	338931	Mr. Bucket	734	“ thank you . Good night , ma'am . Good night , governor . Good night , darlings . I am much obliged to you for one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life . ”
339009	339017	339019	339020	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , old boy , ”
339030	339034	339019	339020	Mr. Bucket	734	“ come along ! ”
339064	339080	339054	339055	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ almost clings to George like , and seems to be really fond of him . ”
339133	339150	339115	339116	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Wait half a minute , George . I should wish to speak to you first . ”
339181	339186	339188	339189	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , ”
339191	339249	339188	339189	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Duty is duty , and friendship is friendship . I never want the two to clash , if I can help it . I have endeavoured to make things pleasant to - night , and I put it to you whether I have done it or not . You must consider yourself in custody , George . ”
339250	339256	339258	339259	the trooper	11982	“ Custody ? What for ? ”
339263	339268	339270	339271	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , ”
339287	339348	339270	339271	Mr. Bucket	734	“ duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another . It 's my duty to inform you that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against you . Therefore , George , be careful what you say . You do n't happen to have heard of a murder . ”
339349	339352	339258	339259	the trooper	11982	“ Murder ! ”
339353	339358	339360	339361	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , ”
339373	339412	339360	339361	Mr. Bucket	734	“ bear in mind what I 've said to you . I ask you nothing . You 've been in low spirits this afternoon . I say , you do n't happen to have heard of a murder . ”
339413	339423	339258	339259	the trooper	11982	“ No . Where has there been a murder ? ”
339424	339429	339431	339432	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , ”
339434	339486	339431	339432	Mr. Bucket	734	“ do n't you go and commit yourself . I 'm a going to tell you what I want you for . There has been a murder in Lincoln 's Inn Fields — gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn . He was shot last night . I want you for that . ”
339513	339533	339539	339540	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Bucket ! It 's not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed , and that you suspect me ? ”
339534	339537	339539	339540	Mr. Bucket	734	“ George , ”
339547	339594	339539	339540	Mr. Bucket	734	“ it is certainly possible , because it 's the case . This deed was done last night at ten o'clock . Now , you know where you were last night at ten o'clock , and you 'll be able to prove it , no doubt . ”
339595	339602	339604	339605	the trooper	11982	“ Last night ? Last night ? ”
339615	339628	339604	339605	the trooper	11982	“ Why , great Heaven , I was there , last night ! ”
339629	339637	339639	339640	Mr. Bucket	734	“ So I have understood , George , ”
339646	339722	339723	339724	The trooper	11982	“ So I have understood . Likewise you 've been very often there . You 've been seen hanging about the place , and you 've been heard more than once in a wrangle with him , and it 's possible — I do n't say it 's certainly so , mind you , but it 's possible — that he may have been heard to call you a threatening , murdering , dangerous fellow . ”
339739	339744	339746	339747	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , George , ”
339769	339897	339750	339750	his	734	“ My wish is , as it has been all the evening , to make things pleasant . I tell you plainly there 's a reward out , of a hundred guineas , offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . You and me have always been pleasant together ; but I have got a duty to discharge ; and if that hundred guineas is to be made , it may as well be made by me as by another man . On all of which accounts , I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you , and that I 'm damned if I do n't have you . Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? ”
339911	339914	339915	339915	he	562	“ Come , ”
339918	339923	339915	339915	he	562	“ I am ready . ”

339932	339937	339929	339930	Mr. Bucket	734	“ wait a bit ! ”
339965	339980	339955	339955	he	734	“ This is a serious charge , George , and such is my duty . ”
340004	340011	339994	339994	his	11982	“ There ! Put them on ! ”
340020	340062	340065	340065	he	734	“ How do you find them ? Are they comfortable ? If not , say so , for I wish to make things as pleasant as is consistent with my duty , and I 've got another pair in my pocket . ”
340089	340106	340107	340107	he	734	“ They 'll do as they are ? Very well ! Now you see , George ; ”
340125	340150	340107	340107	he	734	“ I was mindful of your feelings when I come out , and brought this on purpose . There ! Who 's the wiser ? ”
340151	340155	340157	340158	the trooper	11982	“ Only I , ”
340160	340183	340157	340158	the trooper	11982	“ but , as I know it , do me one more good turn , and pull my hat over my eyes . ”
340184	340204	340107	340107	he	734	“ Really , though ! Do you mean it ? Ai n't it a pity ? It looks so . ”
340205	340220	340221	340222	Mr. George	562	“ I ca n't look chance men in the face with these things on , ”
340226	340239	340221	340222	Mr. George	562	“ Do , for God 's sake , pull my hat forward . ”
340872	340921	340860	340861	my guardian	9683	“ Now , little woman , little woman , this will never do . Constant dropping will wear away a stone , and constant coaching will wear out a Dame Durden . We will go to London for a while , and take possession of our old lodgings . ”
340922	340930	340932	340932	I	0	“ Not for me , dear guardian , ”
340934	340941	340860	340861	my guardian	9683	“ for I never feel tired ; ”
340958	340963	340965	340966	my guardian	9683	“ For me then , ”
340968	340991	340965	340966	my guardian	9683	“ or for Ada , or for both of us . It is somebody 's birthday to - morrow , I think . ”
340992	340999	341001	341001	I	0	“ Truly I think it is , ”
341017	341020	341022	341023	my guardian	9683	“ Well , ”
341031	341088	341022	341023	my guardian	9683	“ that 's a great occasion , and will give my fair cousin some necessary business to transact in assertion of her independence , and will make London a more convenient place for all of us . So to London we will go . That being settled , there is another thing,—how have you left Caddy ? ”
341089	341110	341022	341023	my guardian	9683	“ Very unwell , guardian . I fear it will be some time before she regains her health and strength . ”
341111	341121	341123	341124	my guardian	9683	“ What do you call some time , now ? ”
341128	341136	341123	341124	my guardian	9683	“ Some weeks , I am afraid . ”
341137	341140	341141	341141	He	9683	“ Ah ! ”
341164	341183	341141	341141	He	9683	“ Now what do you say about her doctor ? Is he a good doctor , my love ? ”
341221	341227	341229	341230	my guardian	9683	“ Well , you know ! ”
341234	341239	341229	341230	my guardian	9683	“ there 's Woodcourt . ”
341278	341289	341268	341269	Mr. Woodcourt	497	“ You do n't object to him , little woman ? ”
341290	341300	341325	341325	her	7381	“ Object to him , guardian ? Oh no ! ”
341301	341314	341268	341269	Mr. Woodcourt	497	“ And you do n't think the patient would object to him ? ”
341368	341369	341358	341358	him	497	” “
341373	341378	341358	341358	him	497	” said my guardian . “
341401	342299	341394	341394	him	497	” I felt , in this short conversation — though I did not know how , for she was quiet , and we interchanged no look — that my dear girl well remembered how merrily she had clasped me round the waist , when no other hands than Caddy 's had brought me the little parting token . This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her , and Caddy too , that I was going to be the mistress of Bleak House ; and that if I avoided that disclosure any longer , I might become less worthy in my own eyes of its master 's love . Therefore , when we went up - stairs , and had waited listening until the clocks struck twelve , in order that only I might be the first to wish my darling all good wishes on her birthday , and to take her to my heart , I set before her , just as I had set before myself , the goodness and honor of her cousin John , and the happy life that was in store for me . If ever my darling were fonder of me at one time than at another in all our intercourse , she was surely fondest of me that night . And I was so rejoiced to know it , and so comforted by the sense of having done right , in casting this last idle reservation away , that I was ten times happier than I had been before . I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago ; but now that it was gone , I felt as if I understood its nature better . Next day we went to London . We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away . Mr. Woodcourt dined with us , to celebrate my darling 's birthday ; and we were as pleasant as we could be with the great blank among us that Richard 's absence naturally made on such an occasion . After that day I was for some weeks — eight or nine as I remember — very much with Caddy ; and thus it fell out that I saw less of Ada at this time than any other since we had first come together , except the time of my own illness . She often came to Caddy 's ; but our function there was to amuse and cheer her , and we did not talk in our usual confidential manner . Whenever I went home at night , we were together ; but Caddy 's rest was broken by pain , and I often remained to nurse her . With her husband and her poor little mite of a baby to love , and their home to strive for , what a good creature Caddy was ! So self - denying , so uncomplaining , so anxious to get well on their account , so afraid of giving trouble , and so thoughtful of the unassisted labours of her husband and the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop ; I had never known the best of her until now . And it seemed so curious that her pale face and helpless figure should be lying there day after day , where dancing was the business of life ; where the kit and the apprentices began early every morning in the ball - room , and where the untidy little boy waltzed by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon . At Caddy 's request , I took the supreme direction of her apartment , trimmed it up , and pushed her , couch and all , into a lighter and more airy and more cheerful corner than she had yet occupied ; then , every day , when we were in our neatest array , I used to lay my small small namesake in her arms , and sit down to chat or work , or read to her . It was at one of the first of these quiet times that I told Caddy about Bleak House . We had other visitors besides Ada . First of all , we had Prince , who in his hurried intervals of teaching used to come softly in and sit softly down , with a face of loving anxiety for Caddy and the very little child . Whatever Caddy 's condition really was , she never failed to declare to Prince that she was all but well — which I , Heaven forgive me , never failed to confirm . This would put Prince in such good spirits , that he would sometimes take the kit from his pocket and play a chord or two to astonish the baby — which I never knew it to do in the least degree , for my tiny namesake never noticed it at all . Then there was Mrs. Jellyby . She would come occasionally , with her usual distraught manner , and sit calmly looking miles beyond her grandchild , as if her attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan on its native shores . As bright - eyed as ever , as serene , and as untidy , she would say , “
342315	342539	342540	342540	My	0	” And then would sit amiably smiling , and taking no notice of the reply ; or would sweetly glide off into a calculation of the number of letters she had lately received and answered , or of the coffee - bearing power of Borrioboola Gha . This she would always do with a serene contempt for our limited sphere of action , not to be disguised . Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop , who was from morning to night and from night to morning the subject of innumerable precautions . If the baby cried , it was nearly stifled lest the noise should make him uncomfortable . If the fire wanted stirring in the night , it was surreptitiously done lest his rest should be broken . If Caddy required any little comfort that the house contained , she first carefully discussed whether he was likely to require it too . In return for this consideration , he would come into the room once a day , all but blessing it — showing a condescension , and a patronage , and a grace of manner , in dispensing the light of his high - shouldered presence , from which I might have supposed him ( if I had not known better ) to have been the benefactor of Caddy 's life . “
342543	342560	342540	342540	My	0	” he would say , making the nearest approach that he could to bending over her . “
342571	342572	342540	342540	My	0	” “
342583	342588	342580	342581	Mr. Turveydrop	492	” Caddy would reply . “
342607	342646	342599	342599	She	305	” Here he would crease up his eyelids , and kiss his fingers to me ; though I am happy to say he had ceased to be particular in his attentions , since I had been so altered . “
342651	342657	342658	342658	Charming	728	” I would assure him . “
342690	342707	342688	342688	Caroline	683	” he would turn to his daughter - in - law with infinite generosity and protection ; “
342746	342758	342780	342780	Caroline	683	” he would sometimes add , in a burst of Deportment , “
342789	342833	342782	342782	Your	683	” He had established such a long prescriptive right to this Deportment ( his son 's inheritance from his mother ) , that I several times knew both Caddy and her husband to be melted to tears by these affectionate self - sacrifices . “
342839	342874	342782	342782	Your	683	” he would remonstrate ; and when I saw Caddy 's thin arm about his fat neck as he said it , I would be melted too , though not by the same process ; “
342913	343813	342906	342906	I	0	” He would take the air there , presently , and get an appetite for his hotel dinner . I hope I do old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong ; but I never saw any better traits in him than these I faithfully record , except that he certainly conceived a liking for Peepy , and would take the child out walking with great pomp — always , on those occasions , sending him home before he went to dinner himself , and occasionally with a halfpenny in his pocket . But , even this disinterestedness was attended with no inconsiderable cost , to my knowledge ; for before Peepy was sufficiently decorated to walk hand in hand with the professor of Deportment , he had to be newly dressed , at the expence of Caddy and her husband , from top to toe . Last of our visitors , there was Mr. Jellyby . Really when he used to come in of an evening , and ask Caddy in his meek voice how she was , and then sit down with his head against the wall , and make no attempt to say anything more , I liked him very much . If he found me bustling about , doing any little thing , he sometimes half took his coat off , as if with an intention of helping by a great exertion ; but he never got any further . His sole occupation was to sit with his head against the wall , looking hard at the thoughtful baby ; and I could not quite divest my mind of a fancy that they understood one another . I have not counted Mr. Woodcourt among our visitors , because he was now Caddy 's regular attendant . She soon began to improve under his care ; but he was so gentle , so skilful , so unwearying in the pains he took , that it is not to be wondered at , I am sure . I saw a good deal of Mr. Woodcourt during this time , though not so much as might be supposed ; for , knowing Caddy to be safe in his hands , I often slipped home at about the hours when he was expected . We frequently met , notwithstanding . I was quite reconciled to myself now ; but I still felt glad to think that he was sorry for me , and he still was sorry for me I believed . He helped Mr. Badger in his professional engagements , which were numerous ; and had as yet no settled projects for the future . It was when Caddy began to recover , that I began to notice a change in my dear girl . I can not say how it first presented itself to me ; because I observed it in many slight particulars , which were nothing in themselves , and only became something when they were pieced together . But I made out , by putting them together , that Ada was not so frankly cheerful with me as she used to be . Her tenderness for me was as loving and true as ever ; I did not for a moment doubt that ; but there was a quiet sorrow about her which she did not confide to me , and in which I traced some hidden regret . Now I could not understand this ; and I was so anxious for the happiness of my own pet , that it caused me some uneasiness , and set me thinking often . At length , feeling sure that Ada suppressed this something from me , lest it should make me unhappy too , it came into my head that she was a little grieved — for me — by what I had told her about Bleak House . How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know . I had no idea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so . I was not grieved for myself : I was quite contented and quite happy . Still , that Ada might be thinking — for me , though I had abandoned all such thoughts — of what once was , but was now all changed , seemed so easy to believe , that I believed it . What could I do to reassure my darling ( I considered then ) and show her that I had no such feelings ? Well ! I could only be as brisk and busy as possible ; and that , I had tried to be all along . However , as Caddy 's illness had certainly interfered , more or less , with my home duties — though I had always been there in the morning to make my guardian 's breakfast , and he had a hundred times laughed , and said there must be two little women , for his little woman was never missing — I resolved to be doubly diligent and gay . So I went about the house , humming all the tunes I knew ; and I sat working and working in a desperate manner , and I talked and talked , morning noon and night . And still there was the same shade between me and my darling . “
343819	343837	343816	343817	Dame Trot	729	” observed my guardian shutting up his book , one night when we were all three together ; “

343887	343891	343878	343878	guardian	9676	” he returned , “
343897	343911	343878	343878	guardian	9676	” So did I too , for that matter . I said so . “
343936	343991	343933	343934	little woman	2052	” I laughed as I worked , and replied that I was not sure about that , for it might spoil him , and he might not be so useful , and there might be many who could ill spare him . As , Miss Flite , and Caddy herself , and many others . “
343994	343999	343933	343934	little woman	2052	” said my guardian . “
344052	344069	344046	344047	household goddess	7403	” That was quite another thing , I said . We must all agree in that . “
344074	344079	344046	344047	household goddess	7403	” said my guardian . “
344167	344168	344186	344187	little woman	2052	” “
344178	344181	344186	344187	little woman	2052	” said I. “
344189	344194	344186	344187	little woman	2052	” my guardian assented . “
344236	344242	344227	344227	You	7410	” I shook my head . “
344245	344250	344227	344227	You	7410	” said my guardian . “
344259	344300	344255	344255	I	0	” As there was a little pause here , which I thought , for my dear girl 's satisfaction , had better be filled up , I hummed an air as I worked which was a favorite with my guardian . “
344312	344326	344303	344303	you	0	” I asked him , when I had hummed it quietly all through . “
344359	344360	344364	344364	he	497	” “
344380	344384	344361	344361	I	0	” said I ; “
344406	344407	344401	344401	guardian	9676	” “
344413	344618	344410	344411	little woman	2052	” he replied . I was sitting in my usual place , which was now beside my guardian 's chair . That had not been my usual place before the letter , but it was now . I looked up at Ada , who was sitting opposite ; and I saw , as she looked at me , that her eyes were filled with tears , and that tears were falling down her face . I felt that I had only to be placid and merry , once for all to undeceive my dear , and set her loving heart at rest . I really was so , and I had nothing to do but to be myself . So I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder — how little thinking what was heavy on her mind!—and I said she was not quite well , and put my arm about her , and took her up - stairs . When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it . “
344625	344629	344623	344623	Esther	305	” said Ada , “
344652	344653	344636	344636	my	0	” “
344659	344663	344664	344664	Ada	319	” I remonstrated . “
344674	344688	344668	344668	you	319	” Ada only drooped her head and pressed me closer to her heart . “
344698	344704	344727	344727	You	9128	” said I , smiling , “
344769	344770	344775	344775	Esther	305	” “
344777	344778	344775	344775	Esther	305	” “
344786	344790	344775	344775	Esther	305	” said I , “
344806	344807	344800	344800	you	9128	” “
344813	344817	344811	344811	Esther	305	” returned Ada . “
344857	345024	345025	345025	she	7426	” I looked at my child in some wonder , but I thought it better not to answer , otherwise than by cheering her ; and so I turned off into many little recollections of our life together , and prevented her from saying more . When she lay down to sleep , and not before , I returned to my guardian to say good night ; and then I came back to Ada , and sat near her for a little while . She was asleep , and I thought as I looked at her that she was a little changed . I had thought so , more than once lately . I could not decide , even looking at her while she was unconscious , how she was changed ; but something in the familiar beauty of her face looked different to me . My guardian 's old hopes of her and Richard arose sorrowfully in my mind , and I said to myself , “
345032	345342	345025	345025	she	7426	” and I wondered how that love would end . When I had come home from Caddy 's while she was ill , I had often found Ada at work , and she had always put her work away , and I had never known what it was . Some of it now lay in a drawer near her , which was not quite closed . I did not open the drawer ; but I still rather wondered what the work could be , for it was evidently nothing for herself . And I noticed as I kissed my dear , that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden . How much less amiable I must have been than they thought me , how much less amiable than I thought myself , to be so preoccupied with my own cheerfulness and contentment , as to think that it only rested with me to put my dear girl right , and set her mind at peace ! But I lay down , self - deceived , in that belief . And I awoke in it next day , to find that there was still the same shade between me and my darling . WHEN Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London , he went , that very same day , to Mr. Vholes 's in Symond 's Inn . For he never once , from the moment when I entreated him to be a friend to Richard , neglected or forgot his promise . He had told me that he accepted the charge as a sacred trust , and he was ever true to it in that spirit . He found Mr. Vholes in his office , and informed Mr. Vholes of his agreement with Richard , that he should call there to learn his address . “
345348	345353	345346	345346	sir	9019	” said Mr. Vholes . “
345388	345408	345386	345386	sir	9019	” Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes , but he had no business with him beyond what he had mentioned . “
345419	345436	345414	345414	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes , still quietly insisting on the seat by not giving the address , “
345452	345453	345449	345449	you	9019	” “
345462	345467	345449	345449	you	9019	” returned Mr. Woodcourt ; “
345475	345476	345477	345477	Sir	9019	” “
345479	345495	345477	345477	Sir	9019	” rejoined Mr. Vholes , self - contained , as usual , voice and all , “
345573	345581	345567	345567	I	0	” Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address . “
345588	345593	345567	345567	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes . “

345634	345639	345632	345632	Sir	9019	” said Mr. Vholes , “
345730	345749	345728	345728	sir	9019	” said Mr. Vholes , bringing his hand flat down upon his desk , in a positive manner , “
345752	345753	345754	345754	You	9019	” “
345759	345764	345754	345754	You	9019	” returned Mr. Woodcourt , “
345782	345783	345766	345766	I	0	” “
345789	345794	345766	345766	I	0	” retorted Mr. Vholes , “
345874	345875	345893	345893	his	1946	” “
345878	345883	345893	345893	his	1946	” replied Mr. Woodcourt , “
345896	345897	345888	345888	I	0	” “
345904	345913	345902	345902	sir	9019	” ) said Mr. Vholes , parenthetically , ( “
346126	346140	346141	346141	I	0	” Mr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it . “
346146	346151	346144	346144	sir	9019	” said Mr. Vholes , “
346238	346239	346241	346242	Mr. Carstone	320	” “
346249	346250	346246	346247	Mr. Vholes	680	” “
346253	346258	346246	346247	Mr. Vholes	680	” returned Mr. Vholes , “
346306	346445	346446	346446	Woodcourt	497	” Upon this , Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day , and went in search of Richard , the change in whose appearance he began to understand now but too well . He found him in a dull room , fadedly furnished ; much as I had found him in his barrack - room but a little while before , except that he was not writing , but was sitting with a book before him , from which his eyes and thoughts were far astray . As the door chanced to be standing open , Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without being perceived ; and he told me that he never could forget the haggardness of his face , and the dejection of his manner , before he was aroused from his dream . “
346452	346462	346463	346463	you	497	” cried Richard , starting up with extended hands , “
346472	346473	346474	346476	A friendly one	7471	” “
346478	346482	346474	346476	A friendly one	7471	” he replied , “
346504	346513	346488	346488	they	7472	” They were seated now , near together . “
346521	346525	346488	346488	they	7472	” said Richard ; “
346535	346536	346488	346488	they	7472	” “
346542	346543	346488	346488	they	7472	” “
346548	346549	346550	346550	I	0	” “
346554	346563	346550	346550	I	0	” returned Mr. Woodcourt , shaking his head , “
346570	346571	346550	346550	I	0	” “
346575	346581	346550	346550	I	0	” said Richard , moodily . “
346586	346602	346603	346603	Woodcourt	497	” He brightened again in a moment , and said , with his natural openness : “
346758	346759	346781	346781	You	497	” “
346763	346768	346781	346781	You	497	” said Mr. Woodcourt . “
346777	346778	346781	346781	You	497	” “
346783	346787	346781	346781	You	497	” returned Richard , “
346830	346845	346820	346820	You	497	” He spoke regretfully , and lapsed for a moment into his weary condition . “
346850	346858	346820	346820	You	497	” he cried , shaking it off , “
346884	346885	346869	346869	you	497	” “
346892	346920	346869	346869	you	497	” They shook hands upon it laughingly , but in deep earnestness . I can answer , for one of them , with my heart of hearts . “
346927	346931	346924	346925	a godsend	7475	” said Richard , “
346997	347010	346983	346983	I	0	” Mr. Woodcourt replied that I had hinted as much to him . “
347014	347018	346983	346983	I	0	” returned Richard , “
347082	347107	347108	347108	You	319	” He was so very solicitous on this head , that Mr. Woodcourt gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice . “
347111	347136	347108	347108	You	319	” said Richard , with something pathetic in his manner of lingering on the point , though it was off - hand and unstudied , “
347219	347384	347211	347211	I	0	” Afterwards , when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed , he was so very much impressed by the strength of Richard 's anxiety on this point , that in telling me generally of his first visit to Symond 's Inn , he particularly dwelt upon it . It revived a fear I had had before , that my dear girl 's little property would be absorbed by Mr. Vholes , and that Richard 's justification to himself would be sincerely this . It was just as I began to take care of Caddy , that the interview took place ; and I now return to the time when Caddy had recovered , and the shade was still between me and my darling . I proposed to Ada , that morning , that we should go and see Richard . It a little surprised me to find that she hesitated , and was not so radiantly willing as I had expected . “
347388	347392	347211	347211	I	0	” said I , “
347409	347410	347413	347413	Esther	305	” “
347415	347416	347413	347413	Esther	305	” “
347424	347427	347413	347413	Esther	305	” said I. “
347436	347669	347430	347430	I	0	” said Ada . Such tears in her eyes , and such love in her face . I could not make my darling out . Should I go to Richard 's by myself , I said ? No , Ada thought I had better not go by myself . Would she go with me ? Yes , Ada thought she had better go with me . Should we go now ? Yes , let us go now . Well , I could not understand my darling , with the tears in her eyes and the love in her face ! We were soon equipped , and went out . It was a sombre day , and drops of chill rain fell at intervals . It was one of those colorless days when everything looks heavy and harsh . The houses frowned at us , the dust rose at us , the smoke swooped at us , nothing made any compromise about itself , or wore a softened aspect . I fancied my beautiful girl quite out of place in the rugged streets ; and I thought there were more funerals passing along the dismal pavements , than I had ever seen before . We had first to find out Symond 's Inn . We were going to inquire in a shop , when Ada said she thought it was near Chancery Lane . “
347689	347724	347683	347683	we	7483	” said I. So to Chancery Lane we went ; and there , sure enough , we saw it written up . Symond 's Inn . We had next to find out the number . “
347733	347737	347683	347683	we	7483	” I recollected , “
347747	347913	347739	347740	Mr. Vholes	680	” Upon which Ada said , perhaps that was Mr. Vholes 's office in the corner there . And it really was . Then came the question , which of the two next doors ? I was for going to the one , and my darling was for going to the other ; and my darling was right again . So , up we went to the second story , where we came to Richard 's name in great white letters on a hearse - like panel . I should have knocked , but Ada said perhaps we had better turn the handle and go in . Thus we came to Richard , poring over a table covered with dusty bundles of papers which seemed to me like dusty mirrors reflecting his own mind . Wherever I looked , I saw the ominous words that ran in it , repeated . Jarndyce and Jarndyce . He received us very affectionately , and we sat down . “
347922	347926	347915	347915	you	7487	” he said , “
348011	348012	348013	348013	God	402	” “
348017	348021	348013	348013	God	402	” I thought , “
348028	348029	348030	348030	He	497	” “
348038	348052	348030	348030	He	497	” continued Richard , casting his dejected look over the bundles of papers , “
348098	348146	348085	348085	He	497	” As his look wandered over the papers again , and he passed his two hands over his head , I noticed how sunken and how large his eyes appeared , how dry his lips were , and how his finger - nails were all bitten away . “
348162	348165	348159	348159	you	320	” said I. “
348172	348182	348170	348170	Minerva	522	” answered Richard , with his old gay laugh , “
348236	348239	348240	348240	I	0	“ Perhaps , ”
348243	348249	348240	348240	I	0	“ a change from both — ”
348250	348257	348259	348259	Richard	320	“ — Might do me good ? ”
348270	348324	348259	348259	Richard	320	“ I should n't wonder ! But it can only come in one way now — in one of two ways , I should rather say . Either the suit must be ended , Esther , or the suitor . But it shall be the suit , the suit , my dear girl ! ”
348357	348364	348340	348340	Her	319	“ We are doing very well , ”
348368	348425	348366	348366	Richard	320	“ Vholes will tell you so . We are really spinning along . Ask Vholes . We are giving them no rest . Vholes knows all their windings and turnings , and we are upon them everywhere . We have astonished them already . We shall rouse up that nest of sleepers , mark my words ! ”
348568	348577	348579	348579	Richard	320	“ The sight of our dear little woman , ”
348588	348608	348581	348581	Ada	319	“ is so natural to me , and her compassionate face is so like the face of old days — ”
348622	348633	348635	348635	Richard	320	“ — So exactly like the face of old days , ”
348654	348695	348697	348697	Richard	320	“ that I ca n't make pretences with her . I fluctuate a little ; that 's the truth . Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I — don't quite despair , but nearly . I get , ”
348710	348714	348715	348715	He	0	“ so tired ! ”
348730	348734	348735	348735	he	0	“ I get , ”
348739	348750	348735	348735	he	0	“ so tired . It is such weary weary work ! ”
348823	348828	348829	348829	she	1317	“ Esther , dear , ”
348834	348842	348829	348829	she	1317	“ I am not going home again . ”
348853	348893	348829	348829	she	1317	“ Never any more . I am going to stay with my dear husband . We have been married above two months . Go home without me , my own Esther ; I shall never go home any more ! ”
348936	348944	348946	348946	Richard	320	“ Speak to Esther , my dearest , ”
348953	348960	348946	348946	Richard	320	“ Tell her how it was . ”
348998	349002	349004	349004	I.	0	“ My pet , ”
349005	349015	349004	349004	I.	0	“ My love . My poor , poor girl ! ”
349044	349059	349033	349033	I	0	“ Esther , will you forgive me ? Will my cousin John forgive me ? ”
349060	349064	349066	349066	I	0	“ My dear , ”
349068	349087	349066	349066	I	0	“ to doubt it for a moment , is to do him a great wrong . And as to me!”—why
349162	349171	349172	349172	Ada	319	“ All I had , was Richard 's , ”
349175	349200	349172	349172	Ada	319	“ and Richard would not take it , Esther , and what could I do but be his wife when I loved him dearly ! ”
349201	349216	349218	349218	Richard	320	“ And you were so fully and so kindly occupied , excellent Dame Durden , ”
349220	349255	349218	349218	Richard	320	“ that how could we speak to you at such a time ! And besides , it was not a long - considered step . We went out one morning , and were married . ”
349256	349265	349267	349268	my darling	1317	“ And when it was done , Esther , ”
349270	349676	349267	349268	my darling	1317	“ I was always thinking how to tell you , and what to do for the best . And sometimes I thought you ought to know it directly ; and sometimes I thought you ought not to know it , and keep it from my cousin John ; and I could not tell what to do , and I fretted very much . How selfish I must have been , not to have thought of this before ! I do n't know what I said now . I was so sorry , and yet I was so fond of them , and so glad that they were fond of me ; I pitied them so much , and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another . I never had experienced such painful and pleasurable emotion at one time ; and in my own heart I did not know which predominated . But I was not there to darken their way ; I did not do that . When I was less foolish and more composed , my darling took her wedding ring from her bosom , and kissed it , and put it on . Then I remembered last night , and told Richard that ever since her marriage she had worn it at night when there was no one to see . Then Ada blushingly asked me how did I know that , my dear ? Then I told Ada how I had seen her hand concealed under her pillow , and had little thought why , my dear . Then they began telling me how it was , all over again ; and I began to be sorry and glad again , and foolish again , and to hide my plain old face as much as I could , lest I should put them out of heart . Thus the time went on , until it became necessary for me to think of returning . When that time arrived it was the worst of all , for then my darling completely broke down . She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of , and saying what should she do without me ! Nor was Richard much better ; and as for me I should have been the worst of the three , if I had not severely said to myself , “
349693	349694	349679	349679	Esther	305	” “
349700	349704	349697	349697	I	0	” said I , “
349736	349759	349760	349760	I	0	” But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I do n't know how long . “
349768	349772	349760	349760	I	0	” said I , “
349839	350636	350637	350638	Little woman	2052	” I had given my darling to him now , and I meant to go ; but I lingered for one more look of the precious face , which it seemed to rive my heart to turn from . So I said ( in a merry , bustling manner ) that unless they gave me some encouragement to come back , I was not sure that I could take that liberty ; upon which my dear girl looked up , faintly smiling through her tears , and I folded her lovely face between my hands , and gave it one last kiss , and laughed , and ran away . And when I got down - stairs , O how I cried ! It almost seemed to me that I had lost my Ada for ever . I was so lonely , and so blank without her , and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing her there , that I could get no comfort for a little while , as I walked up and down in a dim corner , sobbing and crying . I came to myself by - and - by , after a little scolding , and took a coach home . The poor boy whom I had found at St. Albans had reappeared a short time before , and was lying at the point of death ; indeed , was then dead , though I did not know it . My guardian had gone out to inquire about him , and did not return to dinner . Being quite alone , I cried a little again ; though , on the whole , I do n't think I behaved so very , very ill . It was only natural that I should not be quite accustomed to the loss of my darling yet . Three or four hours were not a long time , after years . But my mind dwelt so much upon the uncongenial scene in which I had left her , and I pictured it as such an overshadowed stony - hearted one , and I so longed to be near her , and taking some sort of care of her , that I determined to go back in the evening , only to look up at her windows . It was foolish , I dare say ; but it did not then seem at all so to me , and it does not seem quite so even now . I took Charley into my confidence , and we went out at dusk . It was dark when we came to the new strange home of my dear girl , and there was a light behind the yellow blinds . We walked past cautiously three or four times , looking up ; and narrowly missed encountering Mr. Vholes , who came out of his office while we were there , and turned his head to look up too before going home . The sight of his lank black figure , and the lonesome air of that nook in the dark , were favourable to the state of my mind . I thought of the youth and love and beauty of my dear girl , shut up in such an ill - assorted refuge , almost as if it were a cruel place . It was very solitary and very dull , and I did not doubt that I might safely steal up - stairs . I left Charley below , and went up with a light foot , not distressed by any glare from the feeble oil lanterns on the way . I listened for a few moments ; and in the musty rotting silence of the house , believed that I could hear the murmur of their young voices . I put my lips to the hearse - like panel of the door , as a kiss for my dear , and came quietly down again , thinking that one of these days I would confess to the visit . And it really did me good ; for , though nobody but Charley and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had diminished the separation between Ada and me , and had brought us together again for those moments . I went back , not quite accustomed yet to the change , but all the better for that hovering about my darling . My guardian had come home , and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window . When I went in , his face cleared and he came to his seat ; but he caught the light upon my face , as I took mine . “
350640	350644	350637	350638	Little woman	2052	” said he . “
350650	350651	350645	350645	You	2052	” “
350658	350662	350656	350656	guardian	9676	” said I , “
350688	350722	350673	350673	Ada	319	” I put my arm on the back of his chair ; and I saw in his glance that my words , and my look at her empty place , had prepared him . “
350730	350749	350724	350724	she	319	” I told him all about it , and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness . “
350757	350761	350750	350750	She	319	” said he . “
350770	350787	350762	350762	Heaven	365	” But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his . “
350800	350816	350797	350798	Poor Ada	7516	” Neither of us spoke after that ; until he said , with a sigh , “
350830	350831	350833	350834	its mistress	7518	” “
350839	350861	350837	350837	guardian	9676	” Though I was timid about saying it , I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he had spoken . “
350873	350876	350862	350862	She	319	” said I. “
350884	350937	350938	350938	She	319	” The letter had made no difference between us , except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now . He turned his old bright fatherly look upon me , laid his hand on my hand in his old way , and said again , “
350957	351330	350953	350955	O little woman	7522	” I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that . I was rather disappointed . I feared I might not quite have been all I had meant to be , since the letter and the answer . BUT one other day had intervened , when , early in the morning as we were going to breakfast , Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the astounding news that a terrible murder had been committed , for which Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody . When he told us that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the murderer 's apprehension , I did not in my first consternation understand why ; but a few more words explained to me that the murdered person was Sir Leicester 's lawyer , and immediately my mother 's dread of him rushed into my remembrance . This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted , and who had long watched and distrusted her ; one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy ; appeared so awful , that my first thoughts were of her . How appalling to hear of such a death , and be able to feel no pity ! How dreadful to remember , perhaps , that she had sometimes even wished the old man away , who was so swiftly hurried out of life ! Such crowding reflections , increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned , made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table . I was quite unable to follow the conversation , until I had had a little time to recover . But when I came to myself , and saw how shocked my guardian was ; and found that they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man , and recalling every favorable impression we had formed of him , out of the good we had known of him ; my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in his behalf that I was quite set up again . “
351345	351346	351333	351333	you	9676	” “
351436	351442	351444	351445	Mr. Woodcourt	497	“ And I ca n't , ”
351447	351561	351444	351445	Mr. Woodcourt	497	“ Still , whatever we believe or know of him , we had better not forget that some appearances are against him . He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman . He has openly mentioned it in many places . He is said to have expressed himself violently towards him , and he certainly did about him , to my knowledge . He admits that he was alone , on the scene of the murder , within a few minutes of its commission . I sincerely believe him to be as innocent of any participation in it , as I am ; but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon him . ”
351562	351565	351571	351571	he	9683	“ True , ”
351578	351605	351571	351571	he	9683	“ it would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . ”
351659	351663	351665	351666	my guardian	9683	“ Heaven forbid ! ”
351668	351688	351689	351689	He	9683	“ We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . ”
352130	352148	352150	352150	he	11982	“ This is a load off my mind , I do assure you , miss and gentlemen , ”
352164	352177	352150	352150	he	11982	“ And now I do n't so much care how it ends . ”
352204	352220	352222	352223	Mr. George	562	“ This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in , ”
352225	352238	352222	352223	Mr. George	562	“ but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of it . ”
352265	352272	352274	352274	he	562	“ I thank you , miss , ”
352276	352281	352274	352274	he	562	“ Now , George , ”
352286	352308	352274	352274	he	562	“ as we require no new assurances on your part , so I believe we need give you none on ours . ”
352309	352383	352384	352384	He	7564	“ Not at all , sir . I thank you with all my heart . If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n't look at you and keep my secret to myself , under the condescension of the present visit . I feel the present visit very much . I am not one of the eloquent sort , but I feel it , Miss Summerson and gentlemen , deeply . ”
352423	352426	352428	352429	my guardian	9683	“ First , ”
352431	352443	352428	352429	my guardian	9683	“ can we do anything for your personal comfort , George ? ”
352444	352450	352451	352451	he	9683	“ For which , sir ? ”
352458	352479	352455	352455	his	9683	“ For your personal comfort . Is there anything you want , that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? ”
352480	352485	352487	352488	Mr. George	562	“ Well , sir , ”
352495	352518	352487	352488	Mr. George	562	“ I am equally obliged to you ; but tobacco being against the rules , I ca n't say that there is . ”
352519	352545	352455	352455	his	9683	“ You will think of many little things perhaps , by - and - by . Whenever you do , George , let us know , ”
352546	352554	352556	352557	Mr. George	562	“ Thank you , sir . Howsoever , ”
352566	352606	352556	352557	Mr. George	562	“ a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have , gets on well enough in a place like the present , so far as that goes . ”
352607	352615	352617	352618	my guardian	9683	“ Next , as to your case , ”
352620	352626	352628	352629	Mr. George	562	“ Exactly so , sir , ”
352647	352654	352632	352632	his	562	“ How does it stand now ? ”
352655	352719	352628	352629	Mr. George	562	“ Why , sir , it is under remand at present . Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time , until the case is more complete . How it is to be made more complete , I do n't myself see ; but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow . ”
352720	352729	352736	352736	his	9683	“ Why , Heaven save us , man ! ”
352742	352754	352736	352736	his	9683	“ you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else ! ”
352755	352761	352763	352764	Mr. George	562	“ No offence , sir , ”
352766	352813	352763	352764	Mr. George	562	“ I am very sensible of your kindness . But I do n't see how an innocent man is to make up his mind to this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls , unless he takes it in that point of view . ”
352814	352825	352827	352828	my guardian	9683	“ That is true enough , to a certain extent , ”
352832	352850	352827	352828	my guardian	9683	“ But my good fellow , even an innocent man must take ordinary precautions to defend himself . ”
352851	352926	352763	352764	Mr. George	562	“ Certainly , sir . And I have done so . I have stated to the magistrates , ‘ Gentlemen , I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves ; what has been stated against me in the way of facts , is perfectly true ; I know no more about it . ’ I intend to continue stating that , sir . What more can I do ? It 's the truth . ”
352927	352936	352938	352939	my guardian	9683	“ But the mere truth wo n't do , ”
352941	352959	352938	352939	my guardian	9683	“ Wo n't it , indeed , sir ? Rather a bad look - out for me ! ”
352967	352974	352960	352961	Mr. George	562	“ You must have a lawyer , ”
352979	352989	352960	352961	Mr. George	562	“ We must engage a good one for you . ”
352990	352998	353000	353001	Mr. George	562	“ I ask your pardon , sir , ”
353008	353028	353000	353001	Mr. George	562	“ I am equally obliged . But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything of that sort . ”
353029	353037	352960	352961	Mr. George	562	“ You wo n't have a lawyer ? ”
353038	353043	353044	353045	Mr. George	562	“ No , sir . ”
353055	353070	353047	353047	his	562	“ I thank you all the same , sir , but — no lawyer ! ”
353071	353075	352960	352961	Mr. George	562	“ Why not ? ”
353076	353086	353088	353089	Mr. George	562	“ I do n't take kindly to the breed , ”
353091	353118	353088	353089	Mr. George	562	“ Gridley did n't . And — if you 'll excuse my saying so much — I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . ”
353119	353124	353125	353126	my guardian	9683	“ That 's Equity , ”
353135	353142	353125	353126	my guardian	9683	“ that 's Equity , George . ”
353143	353150	353152	353153	the trooper	11982	“ Is it indeed , sir ? ”
353162	353185	353156	353156	his	11982	“ I am not acquainted with those shades of names myself , but in a general way I object to the breed . ”
353282	353292	353294	353294	I.	0	“ Pray think , once more , Mr. George , ”
353295	353307	353294	353294	I.	0	“ Have you no wish , in reference to your case ? ”
353308	353320	353321	353321	he	11982	“ I certainly could wish it to be tried , miss , ”
353324	353380	353381	353381	He	11982	“ by court - martial ; but that is out of the question , as I am well aware . If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes , miss , not more , I 'll endeavour to explain myself as clearly as I can . ”
353420	353560	353561	353561	He	7576	“ You see , miss , I have been hand - cuffed and taken into custody , and brought here . I am a marked and disgraced man , and here I am . My shooting - gallery is rummaged , high and low , by Bucket ; such property as I have—'tis small — is turned this way and that , till it do n't know itself ; and ( as aforesaid ) here I am ! I do n't particular complain of that . Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I had n't gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this would n't have happened . It has happened . Then comes the question , how to meet it . ”
353581	353597	353563	353563	his	7576	“ I am such a short - winded talker that I must think a bit . ”
353612	353775	353776	353776	He	7577	“ How to meet it . Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer , and had a pretty tight hold of me . I do n't wish to rake up his ashes , but he had , what I should call if he was living , a Devil of a tight hold of me . I do n't like his trade the better for that . If I had kept clear of his trade , I should have kept outside this place . But that 's not what I mean . Now , suppose I had killed him . Suppose I really had discharged into his body any one of those pistols recently fired off , that Bucket has found at my place , and , dear me ! might have found there any day since it has been my place . What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here ? Got a lawyer . ”
353813	353994	353995	353995	He	7578	“ I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said ( as I have often read in the newspapers ) , ‘ my client says nothing , my client reserves his defence — my client this , that , and t'other . ’ Well ! ' tis not the custom of that breed to go straight , according to my opinion , or to think that other men do . Say , I am innocent , and I get a lawyer . He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not ; perhaps more . What would he do , whether or no ? Act as if I was;—shut my mouth up , tell me not to commit myself , keep circumstances back , chop the evidence small , quibble , and get me off perhaps ! But , Miss Summerson , do I care for getting off in that way ; or would I rather be hanged in my own way — if you 'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady ? ”
354014	354038	354045	354045	his	7578	“ I would rather be hanged in my own way . And I mean to be ! I do n't intend to say , ”
354055	354176	354187	354187	he	7578	“ that I am more partial to being hanged than another man . What I say is , I must come off clear and full , or not at all . Therefore , when I hear stated against me what is true , I say it 's true ; and when they tell me , ‘ whatever you say will be used , ’ I tell them I do n't mind that ; I mean it to be used . If they ca n't make me innocent out of the whole truth , they are not likely to do it out of anything less , or anything else . And if they are , it 's worth nothing to me . ”
354202	354373	354187	354187	he	7578	“ I thank you , miss , and gentlemen both , many times for your attention , and many times more for your interest . That 's the plain state of the matter , as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a blunt broad - sword kind of a mind . I have never done well in life , beyond my duty as a soldier ; and if the worst comes after all , I shall reap pretty much as I have sown . When I got over the first crash of being seized as a murderer — it do n't take a rover , who has knocked about so much as myself , so very long to recover from a crash — I worked my way round to what you find me now . As such , I shall remain . No relations will be disgraced by me , or made unhappy for me , and — and that 's all I 've got to say . ”
354464	354490	354452	354452	He	562	“ Miss Summerson and gentlemen , this is an old comrade of mine , Joseph Bagnet . And this is his wife , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
354508	354517	354519	354520	Mr. George	562	“ Real good friends of mine they are , ”
354522	354532	354519	354520	Mr. George	562	“ It was at their house I was taken . ”
354533	354541	354542	354543	Mr. Bagnet	721	“ With a second - hand wiolinceller , ”
354552	354569	354548	354548	his	721	“ Of a good tone . For a friend . That money was no object to . ”
354570	354573	354575	354576	Mr. George	562	“ Mat , ”
354578	354604	354575	354576	Mr. George	562	“ you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen . I know it meets your approval ? ”
354618	354622	354624	354624	he	605	“ Old girl , ”
354626	354639	354624	354624	he	605	“ Tell him . Whether or not . It meets my approval . ”
354640	354645	354647	354648	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Why , George , ”
354679	354741	354624	354624	he	605	“ you ought to know it do n't . You ought to know it 's enough to drive a person wild to hear you . You wo n't be got off this way , and you wo n't be got off that way — what do you mean by such picking and choosing ? It 's stuff and nonsense , George . ”
354742	354756	354758	354759	the trooper	11982	“ Do n't be severe upon me in my misfortunes , Mrs. Bagnet , ”
354763	354770	354772	354773	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Oh ! Bother your misfortunes ! ”
354775	354845	354772	354773	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ if they do n't make you more reasonable than that comes to . I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly , as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company . Lawyers ? Why , what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers , if the gentleman recommended them to you ? ”
354846	354854	354856	354857	my guardian	9683	“ This is a very sensible woman , ”
354859	354870	354856	354857	my guardian	9683	“ I hope you will persuade him , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
354871	354877	354878	354878	she	7586	“ Persuade him , sir ? ”
354881	354898	354899	354900	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Lord bless you , no . You do n't know George . Now , there ! ”
354915	354996	354998	354999	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ There he stands ! As self - willed and as determined a man , in the wrong way , as ever put a human creature under Heaven , out of patience ! You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight - and - forty pounder by your own strength , as turn that man , when he has got a thing into his head , and fixed it there . Why , do n't I know him ! ”
355001	355032	354998	354999	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Do n't I know you , George ! You do n't mean to set up for a new character with me , after all these years , I hope ? ”
355097	355114	355120	355120	she	606	“ But I have given up talking to you , old fellow , years and years , ”
355135	355176	355120	355120	she	606	“ and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well as I do , they 'll give up talking to you too . If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner , here it is . ”
355177	355186	355188	355189	the trooper	11982	“ I accept it , with many thanks , ”
355191	355198	355200	355201	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Do you though , indeed ? ”
355211	355251	355200	355201	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ I 'm sure I 'm surprised at that . I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also . It would only be like you . Perhaps you 'll set your mind upon that , next . ”
355311	355324	355326	355326	I	0	“ We hope you will think better of it , Mr. George , ”
355328	355345	355326	355326	I	0	“ and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . ”
355346	355359	355360	355360	he	497	“ More grateful , Miss Summerson , you ca n't find me , ”
355363	355373	355375	355375	I.	0	“ But more persuadable we can , I hope , ”
355376	355414	355415	355415	He	497	“ And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery , and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed , may be of the last importance to others besides yourself . ”
355470	355475	355477	355477	he	497	“ ' Tis curious , ”
355479	355489	355477	355477	he	497	“ And yet I thought so at the time ! ”
355498	355503	355504	355504	he	497	“ Why , sir , ”
355507	355555	355504	355504	he	497	“ when my ill - fortune took me to the dead man 's staircase on the night of his murder , I saw a shape so like Miss Summerson 's go by me in the dark , that I had half a mind to speak to it . ”
355581	355592	355594	355595	the trooper	11982	“ It came down - stairs as I went up , ”
355597	355649	355594	355595	the trooper	11982	“ and crossed the moonlighted window with a loose black mantle on ; I noticed a deep fringe to it . However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment , that it came into my head . ”
355788	355806	355808	355808	her	606	“ I did n't let George see what I thought about it , you know , miss , ”
355816	355829	355808	355808	her	606	“ but he 's in a bad way , poor old fellow ! ”
355830	355841	355843	355844	my guardian	9683	“ Not with care and prudence , and good help , ”
355846	355858	355860	355861	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ A gentleman like you ought to know best , sir , ”
355875	355947	355860	355861	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ but I am uneasy for him . He has been so careless , and said so much that he never meant . The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him as Lignum and me do . And then such a number of circumstances have happened bad for him , and such a number of people will be brought forward to speak against him , and Bucket is so deep . ”
355948	355967	355968	355969	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ With a second - hand wiolinceller . And said he played the fife . When a boy . ”
355976	355985	355987	355988	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Now , I tell you , miss , ”
355990	356016	355987	355988	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ and when I say miss , I mean all ! Just come into the corner of the wall , and I 'll tell you ! ”
356042	356049	356037	356038	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ Old girl ! Tell 'em ! ”
356050	356057	356058	356060	the old girl	12856	“ Why , then , miss , ”
356073	356106	356058	356060	the old girl	12856	“ you could as soon move Dover Castle as move George on this point , unless you had got a new power to move him with . And I have got it ! ”
356107	356116	356118	356119	my guardian	9683	“ You are a jewel of a woman , ”
356121	356125	356118	356119	my guardian	9683	“ Go on ! ”
356126	356135	356136	356136	she	12856	“ Now , I tell you , miss , ”
356154	356236	356136	356136	she	12856	“ that what he says concerning no relations is all bosh . They do n't know of him , but he does know of them . He has said more to me at odd times than to anybody else , and it warn't for nothing that he once spoke to my Woolwich about whitening and wrinkling mother 's heads . For fifty pounds he had seen his mother that day . She 's alive , and must be brought here straight ! ”
356276	356279	356281	356282	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Lignum , ”
356284	356314	356281	356282	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ you take care of the children , old man , and give me the umbrella ! I 'm away to Lincolnshire , to bring that old lady here . ”
356315	356322	356327	356327	his	9683	“ But , bless the woman ! ”
356333	356345	356346	356347	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ how is she going ? What money has she got ? ”
356381	356411	356373	356373	she	606	“ Never you mind for me , miss . I 'm a soldier 's wife , and accustomed to travelling in my own way . Lignum , old boy , ”
356415	356437	356439	356439	she	606	“ one for yourself ; three for the children . Now , I 'm away into Lincolnshire after George 's mother ! ”
356477	356481	356483	356484	my guardian	9683	“ Mr. Bagnet , ”
356486	356498	356483	356484	my guardian	9683	“ Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ”
356499	356505	356506	356506	he	9683	“ Ca n't help it , ”
356509	356559	356483	356484	my guardian	9683	“ Made her way home once . From another quarter of the world . With the same grey cloak . And same umbrella . Whatever the old girl says , do . Do it ! Whenever the old girl says , I 'll do it . She does it . ”
356560	356572	356574	356575	my guardian	9683	“ Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks , ”
356577	356588	356609	356609	his	605	“ and it is impossible to say more for her . ”
356589	356600	356602	356603	Mr. Bagnet	605	“ She 's Color - Serjeant of the Nonpareil battalion , ”
356619	356641	356613	356613	he	605	“ And there 's not such another . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . ”
357415	357426	357431	357431	himself	734	“ And there you are , my partner , eh ? ”
357452	357474	357475	357476	The procession	7653	“ And so you are . And so you are ! And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs. Bucket ! ”
357545	357555	357556	357556	he	734	“ There you are , my partner , eh ? ”
357560	357590	357556	357556	he	734	“ And our lodger with you . I 'm taking notice of you , Mrs. Bucket ; I hope you 're all right in your health , my dear ! ”
357892	357907	357888	357888	Mercury	302	“ Here 's another letter for you , Mr. Bucket , come by post , ”
357913	357919	357921	357922	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Another one , eh ? ”
357980	357989	357991	357992	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do you happen to carry a box ? ”
358002	358012	358014	358015	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres ? ”
358017	358039	358014	358015	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Thankee . It do n't matter what it is ; I 'm not particular as to the kind . Thankee ! ”
358256	358260	358262	358263	Mr. Bucket	734	“ And this , ”
358272	358287	358262	358263	Mr. Bucket	734	“ is in the same hand , and consists of the same two words . ”
358328	358332	358292	358292	He	734	“ LADY DEDLOCK . ”
358333	358338	358340	358341	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Yes , yes , ”
358343	358356	358340	358341	Mr. Bucket	734	“ But I could have made the money without this anonymous information . ”
358541	358544	358545	358545	he	734	“ No , ”
358548	358580	358545	358545	he	734	“ there 's none in that hand . It 's only me as is written to . I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to - morrow . ”
358691	358709	358716	358716	his	734	“ You are a swell about town , and you know me , and I know you . ”
358725	358735	358737	358738	Sir Leicester	290	“ Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ”
358740	358753	358737	358738	Sir Leicester	290	“ Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ”
358754	358768	358801	358802	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why — not to - night , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ”
358769	358774	358776	358777	Sir Leicester	290	“ Because my time , ”
358779	358800	358776	358777	Sir Leicester	290	“ is wholly at your disposal , with a view to the vindication of the outraged majesty of the law . ”
358821	358850	358816	358816	he	734	“ I do assure you , you 're a pretty creetur . I 've seen hundreds worse - looking at your time of life , I have indeed . ”
358905	358911	358883	358884	Mr. Bucket	734	“ If I have not , ”
358916	358994	358995	358996	Mr. Bucket	734	“ in the most emphatic manner , adjured you , officer , to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious case , I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of rectifying any omission I may have made . Let no expense be a consideration . I am prepared to defray all charges . You can incur none , in pursuit of the object you have undertaken , that I shall hesitate for a moment to bear . ”
359011	359015	359016	359017	Sir Leicester	290	“ My mind , ”
359024	359085	359016	359017	Sir Leicester	290	“ has not , as may be easily supposed , recovered its tone since the late diabolical occurrence . It is not likely ever to recover its tone . But it is full of indignation to - night , after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . ”
359116	359120	359121	359121	he	290	“ I declare , ”
359124	359330	359121	359121	he	290	“ I solemnly declare that until this crime is discovered and , in the course of justice , punished , I almost feel as if there were a stain upon my name . A gentleman who has devoted a large portion of his life to me , a gentleman who has devoted the last day of his life to me , a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table and slept under my roof , goes from my house to his own , and is struck down within an hour of his leaving my house . I can not say but that he may have been followed from my house , watched at my house , even first marked because of his association with my house — which may have suggested his possessing greater wealth , and being altogether of greater importance than his own retiring demeanour would have indicated . If I can not with my means , and my influence , and my position , bring all the perpetrators of such a crime to light , I fail in the assertion of my respect for that gentleman 's memory , and of my fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me . ”
359382	359390	359392	359393	Sir Leicester	290	“ The ceremony of to - day , ”
359395	359407	359408	359408	he	7684	“ strikingly illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend ; ”
359422	359467	359408	359408	he	7684	“ was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , aggravated the shock I have received from this most horrible and audacious crime . If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . ”
359488	359501	359503	359504	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You must feel it as a deprivation to you , miss , ”
359508	359526	359503	359504	Mr. Bucket	734	“ no doubt . He was calculated to be a deprivation , I 'm sure he was . ”
359600	359610	359612	359613	Mr. Bucket	734	“ It gives a start to a delicate female , ”
359617	359624	359612	359613	Mr. Bucket	734	“ but it 'll wear off . ”
359680	359687	359707	359707	he	734	“ Why you see , miss , ”
359715	359749	359707	359707	he	734	“ it ai n't easy to answer those questions at the present moment . Not at the present moment . I 've kept myself on this case , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
359763	359841	359751	359752	Mr. Bucket	734	“ morning , noon , and night . But for a glass or two of sherry , I do n't think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been . I could answer your questions , miss , but duty forbids it . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been traced . And I hope that he may find it ; ”
359848	359853	359842	359843	Mr. Bucket	734	“ to his satisfaction . ”
359902	359912	359914	359915	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You know life , you know , sir , ”
359930	359993	359995	359996	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and you can confirm what I 've mentioned to this lady . You do n't want to be told , that , from information I have received , I have gone to work . You 're up to what a lady ca n't be expected to be up to . Lord ! especially in your elevated station of society , miss , ”
360008	360014	360016	360017	Sir Leicester	290	“ The officer , Volumnia , ”
360019	360030	360031	360032	Mr. Bucket	734	“ is faithful to his duty , and perfectly right . ”
360035	360051	360031	360032	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Glad to have the honor of your approbation , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ”
360052	360058	360060	360061	Sir Leicester	290	“ In fact , Volumnia , ”
360063	360133	360135	360136	Sir Leicester	290	“ it is not holding up a good model for imitation , to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him . He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility . And it does not become us , who assist in making the laws , to impede or interfere with those who carry them into execution . Or , ”
360155	360163	360142	360142	Volumnia	614	“ or who vindicate their outraged majesty . ”
360214	360220	360222	360223	Sir Leicester	290	“ Very well , Volumnia , ”
360225	360234	360222	360223	Sir Leicester	290	“ Then you can not be too discreet . ”
360248	360313	360235	360236	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I have no objections to telling this lady , with your leave and among ourselves , that I look upon the case as pretty well complete . It is a beautiful case — a beautiful case — and what little is wanting to complete it , I expect to be able to supply in a few hours . ”
360314	360324	360326	360327	Sir Leicester	290	“ I am very glad indeed to hear it , ”
360329	360335	360326	360327	Sir Leicester	290	“ Highly creditable to you . ”
360336	360343	360345	360346	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
360351	360386	360345	360346	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit , and prove satisfactory to all . When I depict it as a beautiful case , you see , miss , ”
360398	360451	360387	360388	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I mean from my point of view . As considered from other points of view , such cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness . Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families , miss ; bless your heart , what you would think to be phenomonons , quite ! ”
360463	360482	360484	360485	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Aye , and even in gen - teel families , in high families , in great families , ”
360494	360533	360484	360485	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I have had the honor of being employed in high families before ; and you have no idea — come , I 'll go so far as to say not even you have any idea , sir , ”
360540	360546	360547	360548	The cousin	7704	“ what games goes on ! ”
360569	360570	360613	360613	his	290	“ Vayli”—being
360576	360580	360581	360582	Sir Leicester	290	“ very likely . ”
360599	360606	360613	360613	his	290	“ Very good . Thank you ! ”
360643	360651	360652	360652	he	290	“ You will not forget , officer , ”
360658	360669	360652	360652	he	290	“ that I am at your disposal when you please . ”
360705	360713	360701	360702	Sir Leicester	290	“ All times are alike to me . ”
360733	360744	360745	360745	he	734	“ Might I ask , by - the - bye , ”
360755	360766	360745	360745	he	734	“ who posted the Reward - bill on the staircase . ”
360767	360777	360779	360780	Sir Leicester	290	“ I ordered it to be put up there , ”
360782	360804	360745	360745	he	734	“ Would it be considered a liberty , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , if I was to ask you why ? ”
360805	360881	360882	360883	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not at all . I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house . I think it can not be too prominently kept before the whole establishment . I wish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime , the determination to punish it , and the hopelessness of escape . At the same time , officer , if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection — ”
360972	360984	360986	360987	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? ”
360989	360992	360994	360994	Mercury	302	“ Three , ”
360996	361041	360994	360994	Mercury	302	“ Are you so much ? But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion , and do n't look it . You 're not one of the weak - legged ones , you ai n't . Was you ever modelled now ? ”
361066	361076	361078	361079	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Then you ought to be , you know , ”
361081	361124	361078	361079	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and a friend of mine that you 'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy Sculptor , would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the marble . My Lady 's out , ai n't she ? ”
361125	361130	360994	360994	Mercury	302	“ Out to dinner . ”
361131	361143	361078	361079	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Goes out pretty well every day , do n't she ? ”
361144	361147	361078	361079	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Yes . ”
361148	361155	361157	361158	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not to be wondered at ! ”
361160	361205	361157	361158	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Such a fine woman as her , so handsome and so graceful and so elegant , is like a fresh lemon on a dinner - table , ornamental wherever she goes . Was your father in the same way of life as yourself ? ”
361211	361215	361217	361218	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Mine was , ”
361220	361295	361296	361296	Mercury	302	“ My father was first a page , then a footman , then a butler , then a steward , then a innkeeper . Lived universally respected , and died lamented . Said with his last breath that he considered service the most honorable part of his career , and so it was . I 've a brother in service , and a brother - in - law . My Lady a good temper ? ”
361299	361307	361296	361296	Mercury	302	“ As good as you can expect . ”
361308	361311	361313	361314	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Ah ! ”
361316	361353	361313	361314	Mr. Bucket	734	“ a little spoilt ? A little capricious ? Lord ! What can you anticipate when they 're so handsome as that ? And we like 'em all the better for it , do n't we ? ”
361405	361411	361413	361414	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Talk of the angels , ”
361416	361421	361413	361414	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Here she is ! ”
361510	361517	361495	361495	she	7712	“ Mr. Bucket , my Lady . ”
361539	361548	361529	361529	his	734	“ Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester ? ”
361549	361560	361495	361495	she	7712	“ No , my Lady , I 've seen him ! ”
361561	361570	361495	361495	she	7712	“ Have you anything to say to me ? ”
361571	361580	361529	361529	his	734	“ Not just at present , my Lady . ”
361581	361589	361495	361495	she	7712	“ Have you made any new discoveries ? ”
361590	361597	361529	361529	his	734	“ A few , my Lady . ”
361673	361686	361688	361689	Mr. Bucket	734	“ She 's a lovely woman , too , she really is , ”
361696	361704	361688	361689	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do n't look quite healthy though . ”
361761	361775	361777	361778	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Are you sure you 're quite so much as six foot three ? ”
361780	361790	361777	361778	Mr. Bucket	734	“ begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? ”
361797	361839	361777	361778	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 're so well put together that I should n't have thought it . But the household troops , though considered fine men , are built so straggling.—Walks by night , does she ? When it 's moonlight , though ? ”
361863	361877	361879	361880	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I suppose you ai n't in the habit of walking , yourself ? ”
361882	361892	361879	361880	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not much time for it I should say ? ”
361906	361911	361913	361914	Mr. Bucket	734	“ To be sure , ”
361916	361928	361930	361931	Mr. Bucket	734	“ That makes a difference . Now I think of it , ”
361944	361957	361930	361931	Mr. Bucket	734	“ she went out walking , the very night of this business . ”
361958	361975	361913	361914	Mr. Bucket	734	“ To be sure she did ! I let her into the garden over the way . ”
361976	361992	362002	362002	Mercury	302	“ And left her there . Certainly you did . I saw you doing it . ”
361993	362000	362002	362002	Mercury	302	“ I did n't see you , ”
362004	362012	362002	362002	Mercury	302	“ I was rather in a hurry , ”
362017	362088	362014	362015	Mr. Bucket	734	“ for I was going to visit a aunt of mine that lives at Chelsea — next door but two to the old original Bun House — ninety year old the old lady is , a single woman , and got a little property . Yes , I chanced to be passing at the time . Let 's see . What time might it be ? It was n't ten . ”
362089	362095	362167	362167	Mercury	302	“ Half - past nine . ”
362096	362130	362014	362015	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 're right . So it was . And if I do n't deceive myself , my Lady was muffled in a loose black mantle , with a deep fringe to it ? ”
362131	362137	362014	362015	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Of course she was . ”
362329	362355	362325	362325	he	734	“ just to mention quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , that whenever he 's ready for me , I 'm ready for him . ”
362544	362600	362502	362502	he	734	“ I am sorry to have kept you waiting , officer , but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning . I am not well . The agitation , and the indignation from which I have recently suffered , have been too much for me . I am subject to — gout ; ”
362627	362636	362619	362620	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and recent circumstances have brought it on . ”
362672	362680	362681	362682	Sir Leicester	290	“ I am not aware , officer , ”
362692	362726	362681	362682	Sir Leicester	290	“ whether you wish us to be alone ; but that is entirely as you please . If you do , well and good . If not , Miss Dedlock would be interested — ”
362727	362736	362738	362739	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
362762	362838	362742	362742	his	734	“ we ca n't be too private , just at present . You will presently see that we ca n't be too private . A lady , under any circumstances , and especially in Miss Dedlock 's elevated station of society , ca n't but be agreeable to me ; but speaking without a view to myself , I will take the liberty of assuring you that I know we ca n't be too private . ”
362839	362844	362681	362682	Sir Leicester	290	“ That is enough . ”
362845	362856	362857	362858	Mr. Bucket	734	“ So much so , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
362861	362880	362857	362858	Mr. Bucket	734	“ that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in the door . ”
362881	362886	362887	362888	Mr. Bucket	734	“ By all means . ”
362929	362970	362857	362858	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I mentioned yesterday evening , that I wanted but a very little to complete this case . I have now completed it , and collected proof against the person who did this crime . ”
362971	362976	363048	363049	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Against the soldier ? ”
362977	362988	362989	362990	Sir Leicester	290	“ No , Sir Leicester Dedlock ; not the soldier . ”
362997	363004	363005	363006	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Is the man in custody ? ”
363014	363020	363005	363006	Mr. Bucket	734	“ It was a woman . ”
363033	363037	363026	363026	his	290	“ Good Heaven ! ”
363038	363047	363048	363049	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
363075	363274	363048	363049	Mr. Bucket	734	“ it 's my duty to prepare you for a train of circumstances that may , and I go so far as to say that will , give you a shock . But Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , you are a gentleman ; and I know what a gentleman is , and what a gentleman is capable of . A gentleman can bear a shock , when it must come , boldly and steadily . A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against almost any blow . Why , take yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . If there 's a blow to be inflicted on you , you naturally think of your family . You ask yourself , how would all them ancestors of yours , away to Julius Cæsar — not to go beyond him at present — have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit . That 's the way you argue , and that 's the way you act , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ”
363298	363305	363307	363308	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ”
363310	363465	363307	363308	Mr. Bucket	734	“ thus preparing you , let me beg of you not to trouble your mind , for a moment , as to anything having come to my knowledge . I know so much about so many characters , high and low , that a piece of information more or less , do n't signify a straw . I do n't suppose there 's a move on the board that would surprise me ; and as to this or that move having taken place , why my knowing it is no odds at all ; any possible move whatever ( provided it 's in a wrong direction ) being a probable move according to my experience . Therefore what I say to you , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , is , do n't you go and let yourself be put out of the way , because of my knowing anything of your family affairs . ”
363466	363474	363476	363477	Sir Leicester	290	“ I thank you for your preparation , ”
363492	363520	363476	363477	Sir Leicester	290	“ which I hope is not necessary , though I give it credit for being well intended . Be so good as to go on . Also ; ”
363533	363547	363521	363522	Sir Leicester	290	“ also , to take a seat , if you have no objection . ”
363563	363586	363552	363553	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , with this short preface , I come to the point . Lady Dedlock — ”
363612	363636	363638	363639	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Lady Dedlock , you see , she 's universally admired . That 's what her Ladyship is ; she 's universally admired , ”
363641	363649	363638	363639	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I would greatly prefer , officer , ”
363656	363668	363650	363651	Sir Leicester	290	“ my Lady 's name being entirely omitted from this discussion . ”
363669	363686	363638	363639	Mr. Bucket	734	“ So would I , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , but — it 's impossible . ”
363687	363690	363694	363694	his	734	“ Impossible ? ”
363698	363731	363694	363694	his	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it 's altogether impossible . What I have got to say , is about her Ladyship . She is the pivot it all turns on . ”
363732	363735	363737	363738	Sir Leicester	290	“ Officer , ”
363750	363813	363737	363738	Sir Leicester	290	“ you know your duty . Do your duty ; but be careful not to overstep it . I would not suffer it . I would not endure it . You bring my Lady 's name into this communication , upon your responsibility — upon your responsibility . My Lady 's name is not a name for common persons to trifle with ! ”
363814	363832	363694	363694	his	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I say what I must say ; and no more . ”
363833	363852	363737	363738	Sir Leicester	290	“ I hope it may prove so . Very well . Go on . Go on , sir ! ”
363896	363924	363883	363883	his	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it becomes my duty to tell you that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained mistrusts and suspicions of Lady Dedlock . ”
363925	363950	363952	363953	Sir Leicester	290	“ If he had dared to breathe them to me , sir — which he never did — I would have killed him myself ! ”
364005	364115	364002	364002	his	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and close ; and what he fully had in his mind in the very beginning , I ca n't quite take upon myself to say . But I know from his lips , that he long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered , through the sight of some handwriting — in this very house , and when you yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , were present — the existence , in great poverty , of a certain person , who had been her lover before you courted her , and who ought to have been her husband ; ”
364124	364445	364116	364117	Mr. Bucket	734	“ ought to have been her husband ; not a doubt about it . I know from his lips , that when that person soon afterwards died , he suspected Lady Dedlock of visiting his wretched lodging , and his wretcheder grave , alone and in secret . I know from my own inquiries , and through my eyes and ears , that Lady Dedlock did make such visit , in the dress of her own maid ; for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed me to reckon up her Ladyship — if you 'll excuse my making use of the term we commonly employ — and I reckoned her up , so far , completely . I confronted the maid , in the chambers in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , with a witness who had been Lady Dedlock 's guide ; and there could n't be the shadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman 's dress , unknown to her . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I did endeavour to pave the way a little towards these unpleasant disclosures , yesterday , by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes . All this , and more , has happened in your own family , and to and through your own Lady . It 's my belief that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his death ; and that he and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the matter , that very night . Now , only you put that to Lady Dedlock , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and ask her Ladyship whether , even after he had left here , she did n't go down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him , dressed in a loose black mantle with a deep fringe to it . ”
364469	364569	364570	364571	Sir Leicester	290	“ You put that to her Ladyship , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , from me . Inspector Bucket of the Detective . And if her Ladyship makes any difficulty about admitting of it , you tell her that it 's no use ; that Inspector Bucket knows it , and knows that she passed the soldier as you called him ( though he 's not in the army now ) , and knows that she knows she passed him , on the staircase . Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , why do I relate all this ? ”
364747	364756	364758	364759	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Again , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
364761	364907	364758	364759	Mr. Bucket	734	“ put it to her Ladyship to clear that up . Put it to her Ladyship , if you think right , from Inspector Bucket of the Detective . You 'll find , or I 'm much mistaken , that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you , as soon as he considered it ripe ; and further , that he had given her Ladyship so to understand . Why , he might have been going to reveal it on the very morning when I examined the body ! You do n't know what I 'm going to say and do , five minutes from this present time , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and supposing I was to be picked off now , you might wonder why I had n't done it , do n't you see ? ”
364925	364928	364910	364911	Sir Leicester	290	“ True . ”
364982	365068	364968	364968	he	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this unfortunate family affair has taken air , as I expected it might ; the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden . The chance to hush it , is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen . Would you mind sitting quiet — on the family account — while I reckon 'em up ? And would you just throw in a nod , when I seem to ask you for it ? ”
365074	365087	365069	365070	Sir Leicester	290	“ Officer . The best you can , the best you can ! ”
365207	365220	365222	365223	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , perhaps you may know me , ladies and gentlemen , ”
365230	365245	365222	365223	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective , I am ; and this , ”
365260	365322	365222	365223	Mr. Bucket	734	“ is my authority . Now , you wanted to see Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . Well ! You do see him ; and , mind you , it ai n't every one as is admitted to that honor . Your name , old gentleman , is Smallweed ; that 's what your name is ; I know it well . ”
365323	365335	365337	365338	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Well , and you never heard any harm of it ! ”
365345	365361	365363	365364	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You do n't happen to know why they killed the pig , do you ? ”
365377	365380	365363	365364	Mr. Bucket	734	“ No ! ”
365381	365388	365390	365391	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why , they killed him , ”
365393	365436	365390	365391	Mr. Bucket	734	“ on account of his having so much cheek . Do n't you get into the same position , because it is n't worthy of you . You ai n't in the habit of conversing with a deaf person , are you ? ”
365437	365440	365442	365443	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Yes , ”
365445	365451	365442	365443	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ my wife 's deaf . ”
365452	365500	365502	365503	Mr. Bucket	734	“ That accounts for your pitching your voice so high . But as she ai n't here , just pitch it an octave or two lower , will you , and I 'll not only be obliged to you , but it 'll do you more credit , ”
365505	365518	365502	365503	Mr. Bucket	734	“ This other gentleman is in the preaching line , I think ? ”
365519	365524	365525	365526	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Name of Chadband , ”
365538	365551	365553	365554	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Once had a friend and brother serjeant of the same name , ”
365560	365575	365553	365554	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and consequently feel a liking for it . Mrs. Chadband , no doubt ? ”
365576	365581	365582	365583	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ And Mrs. Snagsby , ”
365586	365599	365601	365602	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Husband a law stationer , and a friend of my own , ”
365604	365615	365601	365602	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Love him like a brother!—Now , what 's up ? ”
365616	365627	365628	365629	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Do you mean what business have we come upon ? ”
365642	365670	365671	365672	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Ah ! You know what I mean . Let us hear what it 's all about in presence of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . Come . ”
365714	365720	365689	365690	Mr. Chadband	533	“ Yes . You first ! ”
365728	365739	365689	365690	Mr. Chadband	533	“ I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn , ”
365746	365977	365741	365742	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ I did business with him . I was useful to him , and he was useful to me . Krook , dead and gone , was my brother - in - law . He was own brother to a brimstone magpie — leastways Mrs. Smallweed . I come in to Krook 's property . I examined all his papers and all his effects . They was all dug out under my eyes . There was a bundle of letters belonging to a dead and gone lodger , as was hid away at the back of a shelf in the side of Lady Jane 's bed — his cat 's bed . He hid all manner of things away , everywheres . Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted 'em and got 'em , but I looked 'em over first . I 'm a man of business , and I took a squint at 'em . They was letters from the lodger 's sweetheart , and she signed Honoria . Dear me , that 's not a common name , Honoria , is it ? There 's no lady in this house that signs Honoria , is there ? O no , I do n't think so ! O no , I do n't think so ! And not in the same hand , perhaps ? O no , I do n't think so ! ”
365999	366014	365741	365742	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ O dear me ! O Lord ! I 'm shaken all to pieces ! ”
366015	366023	366025	366026	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , when you 're ready , ”
366033	366054	366025	366026	Mr. Bucket	734	“ to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , here the gentleman sits , you know . ”
366055	366066	366068	366069	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Have n't I come to it , Mr. Bucket ? ”
366071	366156	366068	366069	Grandfather Smallweed	557	“ Is n't the gentleman concerned yet ? Not with Captain Hawdon and his ever affectionate Honoria , and their child into the bargain ? Come , then , I want to know where those letters are . That concerns me , if it do n't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock . I will know where they are . I wo n't have 'em disappear so quietly . I handed 'em over to my friend and solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn ; not to anybody else . ”
366157	366172	366174	366175	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , ”
366177	366275	366174	366175	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I do n't care for that . I want to know who 's got 'em . And I tell you what we want — what we all here want , Mr. Bucket . We want more pains - taking and search - making into this murder . We know where the interest and the motive was , and you have not done enough . If George the vagabond dragoon had any hand in it , he was only an accomplice , and was set on . You know what I mean as well as any man . ”
366276	366283	366285	366286	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now I tell you what , ”
366307	366393	366285	366286	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I am damned if I am a going to have my case spoilt , or interfered with , or anticipated by so much as half a second of time , by any human being in creation . You want more pains - taking and search - making ? You do ? Do you see this hand , and do you think that I do n't know the right time to stretch it out , and put it on the arm that fired that shot ? ”
366434	366539	366423	366424	Mr. Bucket	734	“ The advice I give you , is , do n't you trouble your head about the murder . That 's my affair . You keep half an eye on the newspapers ; and I should n't wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp . I know my business , and that 's all I 've got to say to you on that subject . Now about those letters . You want to know who 's got 'em . I do n't mind telling you . I have got 'em . Is that the packet ? ”
366570	366579	366581	366582	Mr. Bucket	734	“ What have you got to say next ? ”
366584	366606	366581	366582	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , do n't open your mouth too wide , because you do n't look handsome when you do it . ”
366607	366614	366581	366582	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I want five hundred pound . ”
366615	366626	366628	366629	Mr. Bucket	734	“ No , you do n't ; you mean fifty , ”
366645	366673	366675	366676	Mr. Bucket	734	“ That is , I am deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to consider ( without admitting or promising anything ) this bit of business , ”
366685	366727	366682	366682	his	290	“ and you ask me to consider a proposal of five hundred pound . Why , it 's an unreasonable proposal ! Two fifty would be bad enough , but better than that . Had n't you better say two fifty ? ”
366739	366742	366744	366745	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Then , ”
366747	366787	366744	366745	Mr. Bucket	734	“ let 's hear Mr. Chadband . Lord ! Many a time I 've heard my old fellow - serjeant of that name ; and a moderate man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! ”
366821	366960	366817	366817	himself	533	“ My friends , we are now — Rachael my wife , and I — in the mansions of the rich and great . Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great , my friends ? Is it because we are invited ? Because we are bidden to feast with them , because we are bidden to rejoice with them , because we are bidden to play the lute with them , because we are bidden to dance with them ? No . Then why are we here , my friends ? Air we in possession of a sinful secret , and doe we require corn , and wine , and oil — or , what is much the same thing , money — for the keeping thereof ? Probably so , my friends . ”
366961	366972	366974	366975	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 're a man of business , you are , ”
366980	367007	366974	366975	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and consequently you 're going on to mention what the nature of your secret is . You are right . You could n't do better . ”
367008	367022	367024	367025	Mr. Chadband	533	“ Let us then , my brother , in a spirit of love , ”
367032	367043	367024	367025	Mr. Chadband	533	“ proceed untoe it . Rachael my wife , advance ! ”
367074	367084	367086	367086	she	532	“ Since you want to know what we know , ”
367088	367167	367086	367086	she	532	“ I 'll tell you . I helped to bring up Miss Hawdon , her Ladyship 's daughter . I was in the service of her Ladyship 's sister , who was very sensitive to the disgrace her Ladyship brought upon her , and gave out , even to her Ladyship , that the child was dead — she was very nearly so — when she was born . But she 's alive , and I know her . ”
367184	367187	367188	367189	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ Ladyship , ”
367201	367206	367208	367209	that officer	7749	“ I suppose now , ”
367211	367230	367208	367209	that officer	7749	“ you will be expecting a twenty - pound note , or a present of about that figure ? ”
367242	367244	367264	367265	Mr. Bucket	734	“ offer ”
367248	367262	367264	367265	Mr. Bucket	734	“ My friend the law - stationer 's good lady , over there , ”
367275	367284	367285	367286	Mrs. Snagsby	411	“ What may your game be , ma'am ? ”
367511	367516	367509	367509	they	7756	“ all in it . ”
367539	367550	367552	367552	she	411	“ as well as if a trumpet had spoken it , ”
367900	367904	367906	367907	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Very good , ”
367909	367936	367906	367907	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now I understand you , you know ; and , being deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to look into this little matter , ”
367948	368036	367938	367939	Sir Leicester	290	“ can give it my fair and full attention . Now I wo n't allude to conspiring to extort money , or anything of that sort , because we are men and women of the world here , and our object is to make things pleasant . But I tell you what I do wonder at ; I am surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall . It was so opposed to your interests . That 's what I look at . ”
368037	368044	368046	368047	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ We wanted to get in , ”
368049	368061	368046	368047	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Why , of course , you wanted to get in , ”
368068	368173	368175	368176	Mr. Bucket	734	“ but for a old gentleman at your time of life — what I call truly venerable , mind you!—with his wits sharpened , as I have no doubt they are , by the loss of the use of his limbs , which occasions all his animation to mount up into his head — not to consider , that if he do n't keep such a business as the present as close as possible it ca n't be worth a mag to him , is so curious ! You see your temper got the better of you ; that 's where you lost ground , ”
368185	368206	368208	368209	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ I only said I would n't go , without one of the servants came up to Sir Leicester Dedlock , ”
368211	368254	368208	368209	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ That 's it ! That 's where your temper got the better of you . Now , you keep it under another time , and you 'll make money by it . Shall I ring for them to carry you down ? ”
368255	368265	368266	368267	Mrs. Chadband	532	“ When are we to hear more of this ? ”
368271	368288	368290	368291	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Bless your heart for a true woman ! Always curious , your delightful sex is ! ”
368296	368325	368332	368333	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to - morrow or next day — not forgetting Mr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty . ”
368326	368330	368332	368333	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Five hundred ! ”
368335	368343	368332	368333	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ All right ! Nominally five hundred ; ”
368355	368378	368379	368379	he	734	“ shall I wish you good day for the present , on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house ? ”
368429	368618	368410	368411	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it 's for you to consider whether or not to buy this up . I should recommend , on the whole , it 's being bought up myself ; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap . You see , that little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation , and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if she had meant it . Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , he held all these horses in his hand , and could have drove 'em his own way , I have n't a doubt ; but he was fetched off the box head - foremost , and now they have got their legs over the traces , and are all dragging and pulling their own ways . So it is , and such is life . The cat 's away , and the mice they play ; the frost breaks up , and the water runs . Now , with regard to the party to be apprehended . ”
368649	368661	368663	368664	Mr. Bucket	734	“ The party to be apprehended is now in this house , ”
368680	368796	368663	368664	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and I 'm about to take her into custody in your presence . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , do n't you say a word , nor yet stir . There 'll be no noise , and no disturbance at all . I 'll come back in the course of the evening , if agreeable to you , and endeavour to meet your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter , and the nobbiest way of keeping it quiet . Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , do n't you be nervous on account of the apprehension at present coming off . You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ”
368895	368901	368902	368902	she	7772	“ I ask you pardon , ”
368906	368916	368917	368917	Her	7772	“ They tell me there was no one here . ”
368945	368955	368957	368958	Mr. Bucket	734	“ This is my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ”
368964	368978	368957	368958	Mr. Bucket	734	“ This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ”
368979	368994	368996	368996	Mademoiselle	448	“ What do Sir Leicester care for that , you think , my angel ? ”
369003	369009	369011	369012	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why , my angel , ”
369014	369019	369011	369012	Mr. Bucket	734	“ we shall see . ”
369041	369051	369020	369021	Mademoiselle Hortense	448	“ You are very mysterieuse . Are you drunk ? ”
369052	369059	369061	369062	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Tolerable sober , my angel , ”
369064	369123	369061	369062	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife . Your wife have left me , since some minutes . They tell me down stairs that your wife is here . I come here , and your wife is not here . What is the intention of this fool 's play , say then ? ”
369154	369165	369173	369173	her	448	“ Ah my God , you are an unhappy idiot ! ”
369177	369187	369173	369173	her	448	laugh.—“Leave me to pass down stairs , great pig . ”
369199	369204	369206	369207	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Mademoiselle , ”
369215	369225	369206	369207	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you go and sit down upon that sofy . ”
369226	369235	369236	369236	she	448	“ I will not sit down upon nothing , ”
369245	369250	369252	369253	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Mademoiselle , ”
369264	369272	369252	369253	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you sit down upon that sofy . ”
369273	369276	369206	369207	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Why ? ”
369277	369377	369378	369378	Mademoiselle	448	“ Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder , and you do n't need to be told it . Now , I want to be polite to one of your sex and a foreigner , if I can . If I ca n't , I must be rough ; and there 's rougher ones outside . What I am to be , depends on you . So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that sofy . ”
369398	369404	369391	369391	her	448	“ You are a Devil . ”
369405	369411	369412	369413	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , you see , ”
369417	369497	369412	369413	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you 're comfortable , and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do . So I 'll give you a piece of advice , and it 's this , Do n't you talk too much . You 're not expected to say anything here , and you ca n't keep too quiet a tongue in your head . In short , the less you Parlay , the better , you know . ”
369553	369564	369538	369538	her	448	“ O , you Bucket , you are a Devil ! ”
369565	369574	369576	369577	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
369589	369629	369538	369538	her	448	“ this young woman , my lodger , was her Ladyship 's maid at the time I have mentioned to you ; and this young woman , besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate against her Ladyship after being discharged — ”
369630	369633	369635	369635	Mademoiselle	448	“ Lie ! ”
369637	369642	369635	369635	Mademoiselle	448	“ I discharge myself . ”
369643	369654	369656	369657	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , why do n't you take my advice ? ”
369669	369722	369656	369657	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I 'm surprised at the indiscreetness you commit . You 'll say something that 'll be used against you , you know . You 're sure to come to it . Never you mind what I say , till it 's given in evidence . It 's not addressed to you . ”
369723	369728	369730	369730	Mademoiselle	448	“ Discharge , too ! ”
369734	369768	369730	369730	Mademoiselle	448	“ by her Ladyship ! Eh , my faith , a pretty Ladyship ! Why , I r - r - r - ruin my character by remaining with a Ladyship so infame ! ”
369769	369778	369779	369780	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Upon my soul I wonder at you ! ”
369783	369815	369779	369780	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I thought the French were a polite nation , I did , really . Yet to hear a female going on like that , before Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ! ”
369816	369823	369825	369825	Mademoiselle	448	“ He is a poor abused ! ”
369827	369842	369846	369846	she	448	“ I spit upon his house , upon his name , upon his imbecility , ”
369852	369872	369846	369846	she	448	“ Oh , that he is a great man ! O yes , superb ! O heaven ! Bah ! ”
369873	369880	369882	369883	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Well , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ”
369885	369933	369882	369883	Mr. Bucket	734	“ this intemperate foreigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , by attending on the occasion I told you of , at his chambers ; though she was liberally paid for her time and trouble . ”
369934	369937	369939	369939	Mademoiselle	448	“ Lie ! ”
369941	369950	369963	369964	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I ref - use his money alltogezzer . ”
369952	369961	369963	369964	Mr. Bucket	734	“ If you will Parlay , you know , ”
369968	370054	369963	369964	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you must take the consequences . ) Now , whether she became my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , with any deliberate intention then of doing this deed and blinding me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house , in that capacity , at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a wrangle , and likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an unfortunate stationer . ”
370055	370058	370060	370060	Mademoiselle	448	“ Lie ! ”
370062	370066	370060	370060	Mademoiselle	448	“ All lie ! ”
370067	370262	369963	369964	Mr. Bucket	734	“ The murder was committed , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you know under what circumstances . Now , I beg of you to follow me close with your attention for a minute or two . I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me . I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything . From information I received ( from a clerk in the same house ) I took George into custody , as having been seen hanging about there , on the night , and at very night the time , of the murder ; also , as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions — even threatening him , as the witness made out . If you ask me , Sir Leicester Dedlock , whether from the first I believed George to be the murderer , I tell you candidly No ; but he might be , notwithstanding ; and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him , and get him kept under remand . Now , observe ! ”
370317	370435	370309	370309	her	448	“ I went home , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , at night , and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket . She had made a mighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her first offering herself as our lodger , but that night she made more than ever — in fact , overdid it . Likewise she overdid her respect , and all that , for the lamented memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn . By the living Lord it flashed upon me , as I sat opposite to her at the table and saw her with a knife in her hand , that she had done it ! ”
370450	370456	370444	370444	her	448	“ You are a Devil . ”
370457	370461	370463	370464	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now where , ”
370466	370635	370463	370464	Mr. Bucket	734	“ had she been on the night of the murder ? She had been to the theayter . ( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . ) I knew I had an artful customer to deal with , and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a trap for her — such a trap as I never laid yet , and such a ventur as I never made yet . I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper . When I went up - stairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. Bucket 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise , and told her all about it.—My dear , do n't you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the ankles . ”
370659	370668	370669	370669	she	448	“ What is the matter with you now ? ”
370673	370681	370683	370684	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do n't you think any more , ”
370690	370756	370683	370684	Mr. Bucket	734	“ of throwing yourself out of window . That 's what 's the matter with me . Come ! Just take my arm . You need n't get up ; I 'll sit down by you . Now take my arm , will you . I 'm a married man , you know ; you 're acquainted with my wife . Just take my arm . ”
370778	371023	370770	370770	she	448	“ Now we 're all right again . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this case could never have been the case it is , but for Mrs. Bucket , who is a woman in fifty thousand — in a hundred and fifty thousand ! To throw this young woman off her guard , I have never set foot in our house since ; though I 've communicated with Mrs. Bucket , in the baker 's loaves and in the milk , as often as required . My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket , when she had the sheet in her mouth , were , ‘ My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against George , and this , and that , and t'other ? Can you do without rest , and keep watch upon her , night and day ? Can you undertake to say , She shall do nothing without my knowledge , she shall be my prisoner without suspecting it , she shall no more escape from me than from death , and her life shall be my life , and her soul my soul , till I have got her , if she did this murder ? ’ Mrs. Bucket says to me , as well as she could speak , on account of the sheet , ‘ Bucket , I can ! ’ And she has acted up to it glorious ! ”
371024	371027	371028	371028	Mademoiselle	448	“ Lies ! ”
371031	371038	371028	371028	Mademoiselle	448	“ All lies , my friend ! ”
371039	371105	371106	371107	Sir Leicester	290	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , how did my calculations come out under these circumstances ? When I calculated that this impetuous young woman would overdo it in new directions , was I wrong or right ? I was right . What does she try to do ? Do n't let it give you a turn ? To throw the murder on her Ladyship . ”
371118	371309	371106	371107	Sir Leicester	290	“ And she got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here , which was done a ' purpose . Now , open that pocket - book of mine , Sir Leicester Dedlock , if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards you , and look at the letters sent to me , each with the two words , LADY DEDLOCK , in it . Open the one directed to yourself , which I stopped this very morning , and read the three words , LADY DEDLOCK MURDERESS , in it . These letters have been falling about like a shower of lady - birds . What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket , from her spy - place , having seen them all written by this young woman ? What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having , within this half - hour , secured the corresponding ink and paper , fellow half - sheets and what not ? What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having watched the posting of 'em every one by this young woman , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ? ”
371392	371409	371411	371412	Mr. Bucket	734	“ There is no doubt that her Ladyship was on the spot at the eventful period , ”
371414	371566	371411	371412	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and my foreign friend here saw her , I believe , from the upper part of the staircase . Her Ladyship and George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another 's heels . But that do n't signify any more , so I 'll not go into it . I found the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot . It was a bit of the printed description of your house at Chesney Wold . Not much in that , you 'll say , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . No . But when my foreign friend here is so thoroughly off her guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the rest of that leaf , and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and finds the wadding wanting , it begins to look like Queer street . ”
371567	371574	371575	371575	Mademoiselle	448	“ These are very long lies , ”
371578	371599	371575	371575	Mademoiselle	448	“ You prose great deal . Is it that you have almost all finished , or are you speaking always ? ”
371600	371607	371609	371610	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ”
371633	372042	371623	371623	himself	734	“ the last point in the case which I am now going to mention , shews the necessity of patience in our business , and never doing a thing in a hurry . I watched this young woman yesterday , without her knowledge , when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who planned to take her there ; and I had so much to convict her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her malice towards her Ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call retribution upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain . Equally , last night , when her Ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home , looking — why , Lord ! a man might almost say like Venus rising from the ocean , it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent , that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job . What should I have lost ? Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the weapon . My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go , per buss , a little ways into the country , and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment . Now , near that house of entertainment there 's a piece of water . At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her pocket - handkercher from the bed - room where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone , and came back a little out of wind . As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions . I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket - pistol was brought up before it had been there half - a - dozen hours . Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I sha'n't hurt you ! ”
372055	372060	372062	372063	Mr. Bucket	734	“ That 's one , ”
372065	372078	372079	372079	He	734	“ Now the other , darling . Two , and all told ! ”
372086	372089	372090	372090	she	7775	“ Where , ”
372111	372123	372108	372108	they	7776	“ where is your false , your treacherous and cursed wife ? ”
372124	372134	372136	372137	Mr. Bucket	734	“ She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , ”
372139	372149	372136	372137	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 'll see her there , my dear . ”
372150	372158	372160	372161	Mademoiselle Hortense	448	“ I would like to kiss her ! ”

372191	372203	372168	372168	You	448	“ I would love to tear her , limb from limb . ”
372204	372210	372212	372213	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Bless you , darling , ”
372220	372257	372212	372213	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I 'm fully prepared to hear that . Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another , when you do differ . You do n't mind me half so much , do you ? ”
372258	372268	372168	372168	You	448	“ No . Though you are a Devil still . ”
372269	372278	372280	372281	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Angel and devil by turns , ch ? ”
372283	372330	372280	372281	Mr. Bucket	734	“ But I am in my regular employment , you must consider . Let me put your shawl tidy . I 've been lady 's maid to a good many before now . Anything wanting to the bonnet ? There 's a cab at the door . ”
372361	372368	372370	372370	she	448	“ Listen then , my angel , ”
372377	372394	372370	372370	she	448	“ You are very spiritual . But can you res - tore him back to life ? ”
372398	372402	372370	372370	she	448	“ Not exactly . ”
372403	372427	372370	372370	she	448	“ That is droll . Listen yet one time . You are very spiritual . Can you make a honorable lady of Her ? ”
372428	372435	372437	372438	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do n't be so malicious , ”
372440	372448	372450	372450	Mademoiselle	448	“ Or a haughty gentleman of Him ? ”
372460	372478	372370	372370	she	448	“ Eh ! O then regard him ! The poor infant ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
372479	372493	372495	372496	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Come , come , why this is worse Parlaying than the other , ”
372498	372502	372495	372496	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Come along ! ”
372503	372558	372564	372564	she	448	“ You can not do these things ? Then you can do as you please with me . It is but the death , it is all the same . Let us go , my angel . Adieu you old man , grey . I pity you , and I des - pise you ! ”
373348	373358	373360	373360	she	9222	“ You are a mother , my dear soul , ”
373364	373374	373360	373360	she	9222	“ and you found out my George 's mother ! ”
373375	373380	373382	373383	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Why , George , ”
373385	373494	373382	373383	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ was always free with me , ma'am , and when he said at our house to my Woolwich , that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man , the comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother 's face , or turned a hair of her head gray , then I felt sure , from his way , that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind . I had often known him say to me , in past times , that he had behaved bad to her . ”
373495	373501	373503	373504	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Never , my dear ! ”
373509	373617	373618	373620	The old lady	9222	“ My blessing on him , never ! He was always fond of me , and loving to me , was my George ! But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild , and went for a soldier . And I know he waited at first , in letting us know about himself , till he should rise to be an officer ; and when he did n't rise , I know he considered himself beneath us , and would n't be a disgrace to us . For he had a lion heart , had my George , always from a baby ! ”
373799	374180	373795	373795	her	1945	“ So I says to George when I goes to call him in to tea ( he pretended to be smoking his pipe outside ) , ‘ What ails you this afternoon , George , for gracious sake ? I have seen all sorts , and I have seen you pretty often in season and out of season , abroad and at home , and I never see you so melancholly penitent . ’ ‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , ‘ it 's because I am melancholly and penitent both , this afternoon , that you see me so . ’ ‘ What have you done , old fellow ? ’ I says . ‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , shaking his head , ‘ what I have done has been done this many a long year , and is best not tried to be undone now . If I ever get to Heaven , it wo n't be for being a good son to a widowed mother ; I say no more . ’ Now , ma'am , when George says to me that it 's best not tried to be undone now , I have my thoughts as I have often had before , and I draw it out of George how he comes to have such things on him that afternoon . Then George tells me that he has seen by chance , at the lawyer 's office , a fine old lady that has brought his mother plain before him ; and he runs on about that old lady till he quite forgets himself , and paints her picter to me as she used to be , years upon years back . So I says to George when he has done , who is this old lady he has seen ? And George tells me it 's Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire . George has frequently told me before that he 's a Lincolnshire man , and I says to my old Lignum that night , ‘ Lignum , that 's his mother for five - and - for - ty pound ! ’ ”
374231	374239	374241	374242	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Bless you , and thank you , ”
374244	374256	374241	374242	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Bless you , and thank you , my worthy soul ! ”
374257	374261	374263	374264	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Dear heart ! ”
374272	374376	374378	374380	the old girl	12856	“ No thanks to me , I am sure . Thanks to yourself , ma'am , for being so ready to pay 'em ! And mind once more , ma'am , what you had best do on finding George to be your own son , is , to make him — for your sake — have every sort of help to put himself in the right , and clear himself of a charge of which he is as innocent as you or me . It wo n't do to have truth and justice on his side ; he must have law and lawyers , ”
374406	374411	374413	374414	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ He shall have , ”
374416	374497	374413	374414	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ all the help that can be got for him in the world , my dear . I will spend all I have , and thankfully , to procure it . Sir Leicester will do his best , the whole family will do their best . I — I know something , my dear ; and will make my own appeal , as his mother parted from him all these years , and finding him in a jail at last . ”
374565	374575	374558	374559	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ My Lady , my Lady , my Lady ! ”
375041	375056	375057	375058	The trooper	11982	“ George Rouncewell ! O my dear child , turn and look at me ! ”
375125	375183	375119	375119	his	11982	“ My George , my dearest son ! Always my favorite , and my favorite still , where have you been these cruel years and years ? Grown such a man too , grown such a fine strong man . Grown so like what I knew he must be , if it pleased God he was alive ! ”
375247	375250	375252	375253	the trooper	11982	“ Mother , ”
375261	375276	375252	375253	the trooper	11982	“ forgive me first of all , for I know my need of it . ”
375380	375473	375474	375475	The trooper	11982	“ Mother , I have been an undutiful trouble to you , and I have my reward ; but of late years I have had a kind of a glimmering of a purpose in me , too . When I left home I did n't care much , mother — I am afraid not a great deal — for leaving ; and went away and ' listed , harum - scarum , making believe to think that I cared for nobody , no not I , and that nobody cared for me . ”
375522	375644	375510	375510	he	11982	“ So I wrote a line home , mother , as you too well know , to say I had ' listed under another name , and I went abroad . Abroad , at one time I thought I would write home next year when I might be better off ; and when that year was out , I thought I would write home next year when I might be better off ; and when that year was out again , perhaps I did n't think much about it . So on , from year to year , through a service of ten years , till I began to get older , and to ask myself why should I ever write ? ”
375645	375679	375701	375701	his	11982	“ I do n't find any fault , child — but not to ease my mind , George ? Not a word to your loving mother , who was growing older , too ? ”
375704	375894	375701	375701	his	11982	“ Heaven forgive me , mother , but I thought there would be small consolation then in hearing anything about me . There were you , respected and esteemed . There was my brother , as I read in chance north - country papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous . There was I , a dragoon , roving , unsettled , not self - made like him , but self - unmade — all my earlier advantages thrown away , all my little learning unlearnt , nothing picked up but what unfitted me for most things that I could think of . What business had I to make myself known ? After letting all that time go by me , what good could come of it ? The worst was past with you , mother . I knew by that time ( being a man ) how you had mourned for me , and wept for me , and prayed for me ; and the pain was over , or was softened down , and I was better in your mind as it was . ”
375918	376175	375900	375900	her	9222	“ No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so . I said just now what good could come of it ? Well , my dear mother , some good might have come of it to myself — and there was the meanness of it . You would have sought me out ; you would have purchased my discharge ; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold ; you would have brought me and my brother and my brother 's family together ; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something for me , and set me up as a respectable civilian . But how could any of you feel sure of me , when I could n't so much as feel sure of myself ? How could you help regarding as an incumbrance and a discredit to you , an idle dragooning chap , who was an incumbrance and a discredit to himself , excepting under discipline ? How could I look my brother 's children in the face , and pretend to set them an example — I , the vagabond boy , who had run away from home , and been the grief and unhappiness of my mother 's life ? ‘ No , George . ’ Such were my words , mother , when I passed this in review before me : ‘ You have made your bed . Now , lie upon it . ’ ”
376205	376211	376186	376186	her	363	“ I told you so ! ”
376281	376386	376243	376243	she	12856	“ This was the way I brought myself to think , mother , that my best amends was to lie upon that bed I had made , and die upon it . And I should have done it ( though I have been to see you more than once , down at Chesney Wold , when you little thought of me ) , but for my old comrade 's wife here , who I find has been too many for me . But I thank her for it . I thank you for it , Mrs. Bagnet , with all my heart and might . ”
376527	376538	376540	376541	the trooper	11982	“ Mother , ' tis little enough to consent to , ”
376549	376583	376540	376541	the trooper	11982	“ tell me what I shall do , and I 'll make a late beginning , and do it . Mrs. Bagnet , you 'll take care of my mother , I know ? ”
376595	376630	376540	376541	the trooper	11982	“ If you 'll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , she will find them of her way of thinking , and they will give her the best advice and assistance . ”
376631	376636	376638	376640	the old lady	9222	“ And , George , ”
376642	376692	376638	376640	the old lady	9222	“ we must send with all haste for your brother . He is a sensible sound man as they tell me — out in the world beyond Chesney Wold , my dear , though I do n't know much of it myself — and will be of great service . ”
376693	376696	376698	376699	the trooper	11982	“ Mother , ”
376701	376711	376698	376699	the trooper	11982	“ is it too soon to ask a favor ? ”
376712	376719	376638	376640	the old lady	9222	“ Surely not , my dear . ”
376720	376736	376638	376640	the old lady	9222	“ Then grant me this one great favor . Do n't let my brother know . ”
376737	376745	376698	376699	the trooper	11982	“ Not know what , my dear ? ”
376746	376869	376638	376640	the old lady	9222	“ Not know of me . In fact , mother , I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't make up my mind to it . He has proved himself so different from me , and has done so much to raise himself while I 've been soldiering , that I have n't brass enough in my composition , to see him in this place and under this charge . How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery ? It 's impossible . No , keep my secret from him , mother ; do me a greater kindness than I deserve , and keep my secret from my brother , of all men . ”
376870	376878	376698	376699	the trooper	11982	“ But not always , dear George ? ”
376879	376931	376933	376934	the trooper	11982	“ Why , mother , perhaps not for good and all — though I may come to ask that too — but keep it now , I do entreat you . If it 's ever broke to him that his Rip of a brother has turned up , I could wish , ”
376942	376969	376933	376934	the trooper	11982	“ to break it myself ; and be governed , as to advancing or retreating , by the way in which he seems to take it . ”
377013	377060	377061	377061	he	11982	“ In all other respects , my dear mother , I 'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out . So now I am ready even for the lawyers . I have been drawing up , ”
377070	377185	377061	377061	he	11982	“ an exact account of what I knew of the deceased , and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair . It 's entered , plain and regular , like an orderly - book ; not a word in it but what 's wanted for the facts . I did intend to read it , straight on end , whensoever I was called upon to say anything in my defence . I hope I may be let to do it still ; but I have no longer a will of my own in this case , and whatever is said or done , I give my promise not to have any . ”
377235	377248	377226	377227	the trooper	11982	“ Where are you going to take my mother , Mrs. Bagnet ? ”
377249	377278	377279	377280	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ I am going to the town house , my dear , the family house . I have some business there , that must be looked to directly , ”
377283	377313	377279	377280	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Will you see my mother safe there , in a coach , Mrs. Bagnet ? But of course I know you will . Why should I ask it ! ”
377324	377379	377317	377318	Mrs. Bagnet	606	“ Take her , my old friend , and take my gratitude along with you . Kisses to Quebec and Malta , love to my godson , a hearty shake of the hand to Lignum , and this for yourself , and I wish it was ten thousand pound in gold , my dear ! ”
377552	377573	377545	377546	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	“ Trouble , my Lady . Sad trouble . O my Lady , may I beg a word with you . ”
377618	377631	377603	377603	she	7884	“ What is the matter ? Sit down and take your breath . ”
377632	377666	377733	377733	she	7887	“ O , my Lady , my Lady . I have found my son — my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago . And he is in prison . ”
377667	377671	377603	377603	she	7884	“ For debt ? ”
377672	377689	377603	377603	she	7884	“ O no , my Lady ; I would have paid any debt , and joyful . ”
377690	377700	377733	377733	she	7887	“ For what is he in prison , then ? ”
377701	377730	377603	377603	she	7884	“ Charged with a murder , my Lady , of which he is as innocent as — as I am . Accused of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn . ”
377758	377818	377755	377755	she	7887	“ Lady Dedlock , my dear Lady , my good Lady , my kind Lady ! You must have a heart to feel for me , you must have a heart to forgive me . I was in this family before you were born . I am devoted to it . But think of my dear son wrongfully accused . ”
377819	377826	377733	377733	she	7887	“ I do not accuse him . ”
377827	377868	377755	377755	she	7887	“ No , my Lady , no . But others do , and he is in prison and in danger . O Lady Dedlock , if you can say but a word to help to clear him , say it ! ”
377912	377999	377898	377899	Her Lady	7885	“ My Lady , I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in my old age , and the step upon the Ghost 's Walk was so constant and so solemn that I never heard the like in all these years . Night after night , as it has fallen dark , the sound has echoed through your rooms , but last night it was awfullest . And as it fell dark last night , my Lady , I got this letter . ”
378000	378006	377733	377733	she	7887	“ What letter is it ? ”
378007	378012	378013	378014	The housekeeper	982	“ Hush ! Hush ! ”
378025	378275	378276	378278	the old housekeeper	1945	“ My Lady , I have not breathed a word of it , I do n't believe what 's written in it , I know it ca n't be true , I am sure and certain that it is not true . But my son is in danger , and you must have a heart to pity me . If you know of anything that is not known to others , if you have any suspicion , if you have any clue at all , and any reason for keeping it in your own breast , O my dear Lady , think of me , and conquer that reason , and let it be known ! This is the most I consider possible . I know you are not a hard lady , but you go your own way always without help , and you are not familiar with your friends ; and all who admire you — and all do — as a beautiful and elegant lady , know you to be one far away from themselves , who ca n't be approached close . My Lady , you may have some proud or angry reasons for disdaining to utter something that you know ; if so , pray , O pray , think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been passed in this family which she dearly loves , and relent , and help to clear my son ! My Lady , my good Lady , ”
378284	378357	378276	378278	the old housekeeper	1945	“ I am so humble in my place , and you are by nature so high and distant , that you may not think what I feel for my child ; but I feel so much , that I have come here to make so bold as to beg and pray you not to be scornful of us , if you can do us any right or justice at this fearful time ! ”
378375	378382	378367	378367	she	288	“ Am I to read this ? ”
378383	378406	378276	378278	the old housekeeper	1945	“ When I am gone , my Lady , if you please ; and then remembering the most that I consider possible . ”
378407	378435	378367	378367	she	288	“ I know of nothing I can do . I know of nothing I reserve , that can affect your son . I have never accused him . ”
378436	378457	378458	378460	The old housekeeper	1945	“ My Lady , you may pity him the more , under a false accusation , after reading the letter . ”
378698	378704	378705	378705	He	4805	“ Let him come in ! ”
378754	378831	378833	378834	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your Ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from one who has never been very welcome to your Ladyship — which he do n't complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things , why he should be ; but I hope when I mention my motives to your Ladyship , you will not find fault with me , ”
378836	378840	378833	378834	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Do so . ”
378841	378855	378741	378742	Lady Dedlock	288	“ Thank your Ladyship . I ought first to explain to your Ladyship , ”
378877	378988	378868	378868	his	326	“ that Miss Summerson , whose image as I formerly mentioned to your Ladyship was at one period of my life imprinted on my art until erased by circumstances over which I had no controul , communicated to me , after I had the pleasure of waiting on your Ladyship last , that she particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any matter at all relating to her . And Miss Summerson 's wishes being to me a law ( except as connected with circumstances over which I have no controul ) , I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honor of waiting on your Ladyship again . ”
379002	379010	378996	378997	Lady Dedlock	288	“ And yet I am here now , ”
379015	379036	379011	379012	Mr. Guppy	326	“ My object being to communicate to your Ladyship , under the seal of confidence , why I am here . ”
379053	379058	379043	379043	she	288	“ Nor can I , ”
379071	379146	379059	379060	Mr. Guppy	326	“ too particularly request your Ladyship to take particular notice that it 's no personal affair of mine that brings me here . I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here . If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson , and my keeping of it sacred,—I , in point of fact should n't have darkened these doors again , but should have seen 'em further first . ”
379163	379282	379147	379148	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your Ladyship will remember when I mention it , that the last time I was here , I run against a party very eminent in our profession , and whose loss we all deplore . That party certainly did from that time apply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call sharp practice , and did make it , at every turn and point , extremely difficult for me to be sure that I had n't inadvertently led up to something contrairy to Miss Summerson 's wishes . Self - praise is no recommendation ; but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man of business neither . ”
379307	379317	379318	379318	he	326	“ Indeed , it has been made so hard , ”
379322	379558	379318	379318	he	326	“ to have any idea what that party was up to in combination with others , that until the loss which we all deplore , I was gravelled — an expression which your Ladyship , moving in the higher circles , will be so good as to consider tantamount to knocked over . Small likewise — a name by which I refer to another party , a friend of mine that your Ladyship is not acquainted with — got to be so close and double - faced that at times it was n't easy to keep one 's hands off his ed . However , what with the exertion of my humble abilities , and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle ( who is of a high aristocratic turn , and has your Ladyship 's portrait always hanging up in his room ) , I have now reasons for an apprehension , as to which I come to put your Ladyship upon your guard . First , will your Ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ? I do n't mean fashionable visitors , but such visitors , for instance , as Miss Barbary 's old servant , or as a person without the use of his lower extremities , carried up - stairs similarly to a Guy ? ”
379559	379562	379292	379293	Mr. Guppy	326	“ No ! ”
379563	379617	379318	379318	he	326	“ Then I assure your Ladyship that such visitors have been here , and have been received here . Because I saw them at the door , and waited at the corner of the square till they came out , and took half - an - hour 's turn afterwards to avoid them . ”
379618	379643	379318	379318	he	326	“ What have I to do with that , or what have you ? I do not understand you . What do you mean ? ”
379644	379766	379767	379768	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your Ladyship , I come to put you on your guard . There may be no occasion for it . Very well . Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson . I strongly suspect ( from what Small has dropped , and from what we have corkscrewed out of him ) that those letters I was to have brought to your Ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed they were . That if there was anything to be blown upon , it is blown upon . That the visitors I have alluded to have been here this morning to make money of it . And that the money is made , or making . ”
379776	379910	379767	379768	Mr. Guppy	326	“ Your Ladyship , you know best , whether there 's anything in what I say , or whether there 's nothing . Something or nothing , I have acted up to Miss Summerson 's wishes in letting things alone , and in undoing what I had begun to do , as far as possible ; that 's sufficient for me . In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your Ladyship on your guard when there 's no necessity for it , you will endeavour , I should hope , to outlive my presumption , and I shall endeavour to outlive your disapprobation . I now take my farewell of your Ladyship , and assure you that there 's no danger of your ever being waited on by me again . ”
379936	379942	379931	379931	she	7899	“ Where is Sir Leicester ? ”
379958	379968	379943	379943	Mercury	302	“ Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning ? ”
380334	380353	380318	380318	he	12145	“ if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take him from my way ! ”
380545	380676	380527	380527	She	7899	“ If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent . Believe no other good of me ; for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge . He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his disclosure of my guilt to you . After he had left me , I went out , on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him , and make one last petition that he would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I had been racked by him , you do not know how long , but would mercifully strike next morning . “
380703	380766	380767	380767	She	7919	“ I have no home left . I will encumber you no more . May you , in your just resentment , be able to forget the unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous devotion — who avoids you , only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself and who writes this last adieu ! ”
381610	381614	381596	381596	he	290	“ Chesney Wold ? ”
381657	381689	381642	381642	she	7950	“ It is not an illness of any serious consequence , Sir Leicester . You will be much better to - morrow , Sir Leicester . All the gentlemen say so . ”
381726	381730	381724	381724	he	290	“ My Lady . ”
381731	381755	381756	381756	He	290	“ My Lady went out , Sir Leicester , before you were taken ill , and do n't know of your illness yet . ”
381806	381817	381797	381797	he	290	“ My Lady . For God 's sake , where ? ”
382147	382183	382184	382185	Sir Leicester	290	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I 'm sorry to see you like this . I hope you 'll cheer up . I 'm sure you will , on account of the family credit . ”
382239	382250	382236	382236	he	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I understand you . ”
382258	382264	382265	382266	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Full forgiveness . Find — ”
382271	382302	382309	382309	he	734	“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I 'll find her . But my search after her must be begun out of hand . Not a minute must be lost . ”
382324	382424	382311	382313	Sir Leicester Dedlock	290	“ Bring it here , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ? Certainly . Open it with one of these here keys ? Certainly . The littlest key ? To be sure . Take the notes out ? So I will . Count 'em ? That 's soon done . Twenty and thirty 's fifty , and twenty 's seventy , and fifty 's one twenty , and forty 's one sixty . Take 'em for expenses ? That I 'll do , and render an account of course . Do n't spare money ? No , I wo n't . ”
382473	382493	382495	382496	Mr. Bucket	734	“ You 're George 's mother , old lady ; that 's about what you are , I believe ? ”
382511	382522	382495	382496	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Yes , sir , I am his distressed mother . ”
382523	382848	382853	382857	Mr. Bucket , buttoned up	734	“ So I thought , according to what he mentioned to me just now . Well , then , I 'll tell you something . You need n't be distressed no more . Your son 's all right . Now do n't you begin a - crying ; because what you 've got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you wo n't do that by crying . As to your son , he 's all right , I tell you ; and he sends his loving duty , and hoping you 're the same . He 's discharged honorable ; that 's about what he is ; with no more imputation on his character than there is on yours , and yours is a tidy one , I 'll bet a pound . You may trust me , for I took your son . He conducted himself in a game way , too , on that occasion ; and he 's a fine - made man , and you 're a fine - made old lady , and you 're a mother and son , the pair of you , as might be showed for models in a caravan . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , what you 've trusted to me , I 'll go through with . Do n't you be afraid of my turning out of my way , right or left ; or taking a sleep , or a wash , or a shave , ' till I have found what I go in search of . Say everything as is kind and forgiving on your part ? Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I will . And I wish you better , and these family affairs smoothed over — as , Lord ! many other family affairs equally has been , and equally will be , to the end of time . ”
382975	382981	382983	382984	Mr. Bucket	734	“ A spicy boudoir this , ”
383003	383030	383047	383047	he	734	“ Must have cost a sight of money . Rum articles to cut away from , these ; she must have been hard put to it ! ”
383061	383082	383084	383085	Mr. Bucket	734	“ One might suppose I was a moving in the fashionable circles , and getting myself up for Almack 's , ”
383087	383105	383084	383085	Mr. Bucket	734	“ I begin to think I must be a swell in the Guards , without knowing it . ”
383151	383162	383164	383165	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Hum ! Let 's have a look at you , ”
383172	383213	383214	383214	He	734	“ What should you be kept by yourself for ? What 's your motive ? Are you her Ladyship 's property , or somebody elses ? You 've got a mark upon you , somewheres or another , I suppose ? ”
383221	383225	383214	383214	He	734	“ Esther Summerson . ”
383226	383229	383231	383232	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Oh ! ”
383243	383251	383231	383232	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Come , I 'll take you . ”
383514	383531	383532	383532	He	734	“ Unbear him half a moment to freshen him up , and I 'll be back . ”
383548	383607	383545	383545	his	11982	“ I thought I should , George , after what you have gone through , my lad . I have n't a word to spare . Now , honor ! All to save a woman . Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died — that was the name , I know — all right!—where does she live ? ”
383626	383721	383608	383609	The trooper	11982	“ You wo n't repent it , George . Good night ! He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire , staring at him open - mouthed ; and gallops away again , and gets out in a cloud of steam again . Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed ; rises from his book , on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell ; and comes down to the door in his dressing - gown . “
383729	383758	383608	383609	The trooper	11982	” In a moment , his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock . “
383821	383822	383818	383819	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
383825	383826	383818	383819	Lady Dedlock	288	” “
383899	383913	383914	383914	I	0	” Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks ? “
384009	384019	384020	384021	Miss Summerson	305	” Mr. Jarndyce , in a troubled voice , repeats “
384023	384024	384020	384021	Miss Summerson	305	” “
384029	384043	384020	384021	Miss Summerson	305	” Mr. Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along ; “
384342	385698	384292	384292	my	0	” This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case can not be questioned . Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there , while he speaks to Miss Summerson . Mr. Bucket says he will ; but , acting on his usual principle , does no such thing — following up - stairs instead , and keeping his man in sight . So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase , while they confer . In a very little time , Mr. Jarndyce comes down , and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly , and place herself under his protection , to accompany him where he pleases . Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval ; and awaits her coming , at the door . There , he mounts a high tower in his mind , and looks out , far and wide . Many solitary figures he perceives , creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on heaths , and roads , and lying under haystacks . But the figure that he seeks , is not among them . Other solitaries he perceives , in nooks of bridges , looking over ; and in shadowed places down by the river 's level ; and a dark , dark , shapeless object drifting with the tide , more solitary than all , clings with a drowning hold on his attention . Where is she ? Living or dead , where is she ? If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able , with an enchanted power , to bring before him the place where she found it , and the night landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he descry her there ? On the waste , where the brick - kilns are burning with a pale blue flare ; where the straw - roofs of the wretched huts in which the bricks are made , are being scattered by the wind ; where the clay and water are hard frozen , and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day , looks like an instrument of human torture;—traversing this deserted blighted spot , there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , pelted by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all companionship . It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is miserably dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall , and out at the great door , of the Dedlock mansion . I HAD gone to bed and fallen asleep , when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly . On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock 's . That my mother had fled ; that a person was now at our door who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness , if he could possibly find her ; and that I was sought for to accompany him , in the hope that my entreaties might prevail upon her , if his failed . Something to this general purpose , I made out ; but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed . But , I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley , or any one ; and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person entrusted with the secret . In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me . Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian 's candle , read to me , in the hall , a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and , I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused , I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets . His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me . These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother ( to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock ) ; when and where I had spoken with her last ; and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief . When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider — taking time to think — whether , within my knowledge , there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide , under circumstances of the last necessity . I could think of no one but my guardian . But , bye and bye , I mentioned Mr. Boythorn . He came into my mind , as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name ; and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister , and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story . My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other . He now told him to go on again ; and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed . He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was ; but I did not feel clear enough to understand it . We had not driven very far from our lodgings , when we stopped in a bye street , at a public - looking place lighted up with gas . Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an arm - chair , by a bright fire . It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall . Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors underground , to which nobody paid any attention . A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together , while one wrote from Mr. Bucket 's subdued dictation . It was a description of my mother that they were busy with ; for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done , and read it in a whisper . It was very accurate indeed . The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out , and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) who took it up and went away with it . All this was done with the greatest dispatch , and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried . As soon as the paper was sent out upon its travels , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with neatness and care . Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the soles of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire . “
385708	385719	385705	385706	Miss Summerson	305	” he asked me , as his eyes met mine . “
385735	385750	385705	385706	Miss Summerson	305	” I told him I cared for no weather , and was warmly clothed . “
385758	385762	385705	385706	Miss Summerson	305	” he observed ; “
385775	385776	385773	385773	miss	9100	” “
385786	385793	385794	385794	You	7994	” said I. He nodded comfortingly . “
385852	385912	385850	385850	Baronet	2252	” He was really very kind and gentle ; and as he stood before the fire warming his boots , and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his sagacity which re - assured me . It was not yet a quarter to two , when I heard horses ' feet and wheels outside . “
385918	385922	385915	385916	Miss Summerson	305	” said he , “
385931	386187	385928	385928	you	305	” He gave me his arm , and the two officers courteously bowed me out , and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche , with a postilion and post horses . Mr. Bucket handed me in , and took his own seat on the box . The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage , then handed him up a dark lantern at his request ; and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away . I was far from sure that I was not in a dream . We rattled with great rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets , that I soon lost all idea where we were ; except that we had crossed and re - crossed the river , and still seemed to be traversing a low - lying , water - side , dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares , chequered by docks and basins , high piles of warehouses , swing - bridges , and masts of ships . At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not purify ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men , who looked like a mixture of police and sailors . Against the mouldering wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could discern the words , “
386191	386527	385928	385928	you	305	” and this , and an inscription about Drags , possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place . I had no need to remind myself that I was not there , by the indulgence of any feeling of mine , to increase the difficulties of the search , or to lessen its hopes , or enhance its delays . I remained quiet ; but what I suffered in that dreadful spot , I never can forget . And still it was like the horror of a dream . A man yet dark and muddy , in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them , was called out of a boat , and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some slippery steps — as if to look at something secret that he had to show . They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared ! After some further conference , Mr. Bucket ( whom everybody seemed to know and defer to ) went in with the others at a door , and left me in the carriage ; while the driver walked up and down by his horses , to warm himself . The tide was coming in , as I judged from the sound it made ; and I could hear it break at the end of the alley , with a little rush towards me . It never did so — and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less — but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ' feet . Mr. Bucket came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat . “
386545	386553	386534	386535	Miss Summerson	305	” he said , turning to me . “
386583	386947	386948	386952	An old acquaintance of yours	8004	” We appeared to retrace the way we had come . Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets . We called at another office or station for a minute , and crossed the river again . During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never relaxed in his vigilance a single moment ; but , when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the alert than before . He stood up to look over the parapet ; he alighted , and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted past us ; and he gazed into the profound black pit of water , with a face that made my heart die within me . The river had a fearful look , so overcast and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore : so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow : so deathlike and mysterious . I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey . In my memory , the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim ; the cutting wind is eddying round the homeless woman whom we pass ; the monotonous wheels are whirling on ; and the light of the carriage lamps reflected back , looks palely in upon me — a face , rising out of the dreaded water . Clattering and clattering through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads , and began to leave the houses behind us . After a while , I recognised the familiar way to St. Albans . At Barnet , fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on . It was very cold indeed ; and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then . “
386960	386967	386957	386958	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Bucket , cheerfully . “
386970	386974	386957	386958	Miss Summerson	305	” I returned . “
386981	386982	386957	386958	Miss Summerson	305	” “
386993	386997	386957	386958	Miss Summerson	305	” he answered ; “
387006	387106	387160	387161	Miss Summerson	305	” He had gone into every late or early public - house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers ) , and had got down to talk to the turnpike - keepers . I had heard him ordering drink , and chinking money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , “
387113	387156	387160	387161	Miss Summerson	305	” With all these stoppages , it was between five and six o'clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans , when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea . “
387182	387193	387194	387194	You	305	” I thanked him , and said I hoped so . “
387204	387208	387210	387210	Lord	16162	” he returned ; “
387235	387264	387228	387228	She	8009	” I do n't know what joyful exclamation I made , or was going to make , but he put up his finger , and I stopped myself . “
387392	387463	387385	387386	my lad	16596	” We were soon in Saint Albans , and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night , and really to believe that they were not a dream . Leaving the carriage at the posting - house , and ordering fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home . “
387477	387481	387471	387472	Miss Summerson	305	” he observed , “
387518	387578	387591	387591	you	9060	” As we ascended the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye — the day was now breaking — and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering with my little servant and poor Jo : whom he called Toughey . I wondered how he knew that . “
387594	387609	387582	387583	a man	9508	” said Mr. Bucket . Yes , I remembered that too , very well . “
387614	387627	387628	387628	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket . Seeing my surprise , he went on : “
387722	387723	387716	387716	you	9060	” “
387730	387734	387716	387716	you	9060	” I asked . “
387741	387752	387716	387716	you	9060	” said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat ; “
387880	387881	387882	387883	Poor creature	8024	” “
387885	387888	387882	387883	Poor creature	8024	” said I. “
387892	387897	387882	387883	Poor creature	8024	” assented Mr. Bucket , “
387935	387941	387930	387930	I	0	” I asked him why ? “
387947	387952	387930	387930	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket . “
387984	388071	387963	387963	He	10315	” Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me . With the same kind intention , manifestly , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view . He still pursued this subject , as we turned in at the garden gate . “
388074	388079	387963	387963	He	10315	” said Mr. Bucket . “
388208	388238	388186	388186	you	8035	” We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the gravel for footprints , before he raised his eyes to the windows . “
388263	388275	388260	388261	Miss Summerson	305	” he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole 's usual chamber . “
388281	388284	388278	388279	Mr. Skimpole	358	” said I. “
388292	388302	388287	388287	you	8035	” returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear . “
388331	388332	388333	388333	Harold	358	” “
388335	388340	388341	388341	Harold	358	” I told him . “
388353	388364	388351	388351	Harold	358	” said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression . “
388371	388374	388365	388365	He	358	” said I. “
388380	388383	388351	388351	Harold	358	” observed Mr. Bucket.—“He
388388	388403	388351	388351	Harold	358	” I involuntarily returned for answer , that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him . “
388415	388419	388407	388407	I	0	” he rejoined . “
388813	388841	388800	388800	he	747	” I regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian , and as passing the usual bounds of his childish innocence . “
388847	388852	388800	388800	he	747	” returned Mr. Bucket . “
389068	389154	389157	389158	Miss Summerson	305	” I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face . The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not diminished by my inquiries . No one , however , had been there . It could not be doubted that this was the truth . “
389160	389165	389157	389158	Miss Summerson	305	” said my companion , “
389219	389528	389529	389529	Liz	447	” We set off again immediately . On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up , and apparently deserted ; but one of the neighbours who knew me , and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear , informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the margin of the piece of ground where the kilns were , and where the long rows of bricks were drying . We lost no time in repairing to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood ajar , I pushed it open . There were only three of them sitting at breakfast ; the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner . It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent . The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a morose nod of recognition . A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him . I had asked leave to enter , of course . Liz ( the only name by which I knew her ) rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead . Now that I had to speak , and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy . It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears . “
389531	389535	389529	389529	Liz	447	” said I , “
389556	389557	389553	389554	a lady	2494	” “
389566	389583	389553	389554	a lady	2494	” Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole group , with a composed propitiatory face ; “
389604	389605	389593	389599	The lady that was here last night	8077	” “
389616	389643	389644	389666	A person of the name of Michael Jackson , in a blue welveteen waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons	8079	” inquired Jenny 's husband , who had made a surly stop in his eating , to listen , and now measured him with his eye . “
389668	389674	389675	389675	He	8079	” Mr. Bucket immediately answered . “
389688	389693	389680	389680	his	8079	” growled the man . “
389703	389713	389694	389694	He	8079	” said Mr. Bucket , apologetically for Michael Jackson , “
389719	389823	389824	389824	I	0	” The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood faltering with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me . I thought she would have spoken to me privately , if she had dared . She was still in this attitude of uncertainty , when her husband , who was eating with a lump of bread and fat in one hand , and his clasp - knife in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table , and told her with an oath to mind her business at any rate , and sit down . “
389834	389838	389830	389830	Jenny	401	” said I , “
389882	389937	389880	389880	she	401	” The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot . He left it to Jenny 's husband to say what he chose , and after a dogged silence the latter turned his shaggy head towards me . “
390065	390066	390058	390058	She	401	” “
390073	390077	390068	390068	she	401	” I asked . “
390091	390103	390086	390086	she	401	” he answered , with a sulky jerk of his head . “
390143	390147	390133	390133	you	8091	” said I , “
390157	390158	390133	390133	you	8091	” “
390175	390181	390182	390183	Your master	13442	” the woman timidly began . “
390185	390197	390182	390183	Your master	13442	” said her husband , muttering an imprecation with slow emphasis , “
390212	390237	390258	390259	the lady	1219	” After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual grumbling unwillingness . “
390502	390508	390499	390499	He	2368	” The other man repeated , “
390515	390516	390499	390499	He	2368	” “
390522	390526	390518	390519	the lady	1219	” I inquired . “
390531	390537	390527	390527	Devil	689	” returned the first man . “
390560	390617	390552	390552	she	1219	” The woman sat with her arms crossed , and her eyes upon the ground . Her husband had turned his seat a little , so as to face her ; and kept his hammer - like hand upon the table , as if it were in readiness to execute his threat if she disobeyed him . “
390630	390634	390656	390656	she	1219	” said I , “
390640	390641	390636	390637	the lady	1219	” “
390645	390652	390636	390637	the lady	1219	” he gruffly cried to her . “
390667	390668	390656	390656	she	1219	” “
390671	390676	390656	390656	she	1219	” replied the woman . “
390684	390685	390687	390687	she	1219	” “
390691	390692	390687	390687	she	1219	” “
390702	390716	390697	390697	her	1219	” She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave . “
390721	390724	390718	390718	she	1219	” said I. “
390732	390733	390718	390718	she	1219	” “
390737	390748	390750	390750	her	1219	” said the husband , in answer to her look . “
390757	390758	390750	390750	her	1219	” “
390782	390783	390777	390777	she	1219	” “
390789	390802	390786	390786	she	1219	here”—I was proceeding , when Jenny 's husband impatiently took me up . “
390848	390901	390904	390905	Miss Summerson	305	” I glanced at my companion ; and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave . The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her . “
390907	390919	390904	390905	Miss Summerson	305	” he said to me , as we walked quickly away . “
390936	390937	390938	390938	You	8117	” “
390942	390946	390938	390938	You	8117	” I exclaimed . “
390954	390958	390938	390938	You	8117	” he returned . “
391057	391086	391051	391051	she	958	” He repeated this question to himself several times , as we hurried on ; appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind . “
391093	391096	391051	391051	she	958	” said Mr. Bucket—“which
391202	391226	391198	391200	the other woman	12117	” I regretted it exceedingly ; for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have resisted no entreaty of mine . “
391234	391243	391231	391232	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , “
391352	391719	391338	391339	Miss Summerson	305	” We called at home once more , that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage . The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes . It had set in snowing at daybreak , and it now snowed hard . The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall , that we could see but a very little way in any direction . Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but partially frozen , and it churned — with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells — under the hoofs of the horses , into mire and water . They sometimes slipped and floundered for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a standstill to rest them . One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so , and was so shaken , that the driver had to dismount from his saddle and lead him at last . I could eat nothing , and could not sleep ; and I grew so nervous under these delays , and the slow pace at which we travelled , that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk . Yielding to my companion 's better sense , however , I remained where I was . All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to ; addressing people whom he had never beheld before , as old acquaintances ; running in to warm himself at every fire he saw ; talking and drinking and shaking hands , at every bar and tap ; friendly with every waggoner , wheelwright , blacksmith , and toll - taker ; yet never seeming to lose time , and always mounting to the box again with his watchful , steady face , and his business - like “
391726	391787	391338	391339	Miss Summerson	305	” When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the stable yard , with the wet snow encrusted upon him , and dropping off him — plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees , as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans — and spoke to me at the carriage side . “
391826	391827	391844	391844	you	16596	” “
391832	391835	391844	391844	you	16596	” said I. “
391874	391875	391876	391876	I	0	” “
391881	391884	391876	391876	I	0	” said I. “
391900	391901	391888	391892	some one else nearer here	8139	” “
391939	392175	392178	392179	my lad	16596	” The sleet fell all that day unceasingly , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or lightened for a moment . Such roads I had never seen . I sometimes feared we had missed the way , and got into the ploughed grounds , or the marshes . If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an indefinite period of great duration ; and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then labored . As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence . He was the same as before with all the roadside people , but he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box . I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth , during the whole of one long weary stage . I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us , what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance . Their replies did not encourage him . He always gave me a re - assuring beck of his finger , and lift of his eyelid as he got upon the box again ; but he seemed perplexed now , when he said , “
392181	393216	392178	392179	my lad	16596	” At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised . It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since . This corroborated the apprehensions I had formed , when he began to look at direction - posts , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time , while he explored them . But , I was not to be down - hearted , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again . The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue . There was a spacious inn here , solitary , but a comfortable substantial building , and as we drove in under a large gateway , before I knew it , where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the carriage door , entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be uncharitable to refuse . They took me up stairs to a warm room , and left me there . It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways . On one side , to a stable - yard open to a bye - road , where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage ; and beyond that , to the bye - road itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging : on the other side , to a wood of dark pine trees . Their branches were encumbered with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window . Night was setting in , and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window - pane . As I looked among the stems of the trees , and followed the discolored marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me , and of my mother lying down in such a wood to die . I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort . They cushioned me up , on a large sofa by the fire ; and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to - night , but must go to bed . But , this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there , that she soon recalled her words , and compromised for a rest of half - an - hour . A good endearing creature she was . She , and her three fair girls all so busy about me . I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and dined elsewhere ; but I could not do it , when a snug round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to disappoint them . However , I could take some toast and some hot negus ; and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some recompense . Punctual to the time , at the half - hour 's end the carriage came rumbling under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , comforted by kindness , and safe ( I assured them ) not to faint any more . After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter — a blooming girl of nineteen , who was to be the first married , they had told me — got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me . I have never seen her from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend . The transparent windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and churning the loose snow . We went on with toil enough ; but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles . My companion smoking on the box — I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so , when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco — was as vigilant as ever ; and as quickly down and up again , when we came to any human abode or any human creature . He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me , to see that I was doing well . There was a folding - window to the carriage - head , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope . We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered . I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change ; but I knew by his yet graver face , as he stood watching the ostlers , that he had heard nothing . Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man . “
393221	393227	392178	392179	my lad	16596	” said I , starting . “
393232	393233	393229	393229	she	8143	” “
393256	393296	393251	393251	I	0	” The crystallised snow was in his eyelashes , in his hair , lying in ridges on his dress . He had to shake it from his face , and get his breath , before he spoke to me . “
393302	393313	393299	393300	Miss Summerson	305	” said he , beating his finger on the apron , “
393365	393385	393387	393387	he	8149	” There was a commotion in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know “
393393	393394	393387	393387	he	8149	” “
393409	393410	393387	393387	he	8149	” “
393413	393419	393387	393387	he	8149	” said I , astonished . “
393428	393429	393430	393431	Miss Summerson	305	” “
393433	393437	393430	393431	Miss Summerson	305	” he answered , “
393463	393464	393465	393466	The other	9883	” “
393468	393472	393465	393466	The other	9883	” I repeated . “
393475	393476	393465	393466	The other	9883	” “
393511	393512	393509	393509	you	305	” “
393550	393563	393564	393564	You	305	” said I , in an agony , and grasping his hand . “
393628	393691	393692	393693	My dear	9060	” These orders , and the way in which he ran about the yard , urging them , caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me than the sudden change . But , in the height of the confusion , a mounted man galloped away to order the relays , and our horses were put to with great speed . “
393695	393708	393692	393693	My dear	9060	” said Mr. Bucket , jumping to his seat , and looking in again—“you'll
393751	393814	393749	393749	you	9060	” I endeavoured to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of deciding what we ought to do ; but was he sure that this was right ? Could I not go forward by myself in search of — I grasped his hand again in my distress , and whispered it to him — of my own mother . “
393818	393822	393749	393749	you	9060	” he answered , “
393851	393859	393843	393843	you	9060	” What could I say but yes ! “
393899	393900	393895	393895	you	9060	” “
393906	393907	393904	393904	sir	9019	” “
393920	394255	394256	394256	Our	8167	” We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come ; tearing up the miry sleet and thawing snow , as if they were torn up by a waterwheel . STILL impassive , as behoves its breeding , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur . There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky ; and , in the same conservatory , there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors . It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently . Rumour , busy overmuch , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire . It persists in flitting and chattering about town . It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been sadly used . It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things . It makes the world of five miles round , quite merry . Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ' is to augur yourself unknown . One of the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats , is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords , on Sir Leicester 's application for a bill of divorce . At Blaze and Sparkle 's the jewellers , and at Sheen and Gloss 's the mercers , it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age , the feature of the century . The patronesses of those establishments , albeit so loftily inscrutable , being as nicely weighed and measured there as any other article of the stock - in - trade , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter . “
394262	394276	394259	394260	Mr. Jones	751	” said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in question on engaging him , “
394319	394382	394310	394311	Mr. Jones	751	” So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to their Jones , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people , and how to bring what they ( Sheen and Gloss ) choose , into fashion . On similar unerring principles , Mr. Sladdery the librarian , and indeed the great farmer of gorgeous sheep , admits this very day , “
394576	394865	394574	394574	sir	9019	” Thus rumour thrives in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire . By half - past five , post meridian , Horse Guards ' time , it has even elicited a new remark from the Honorable Mr. Stables , which bids fair to outshine the old one , on which he has so long rested his colloquial reputation . This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best groomed woman in the stud , he had no idea she was a bolter . It is immensely received in turf - circles . At feasts and festivals also : in firmaments she has often graced , and among constellations she outshone but yesterday , she is still the prevalent subject . What is it ? Who is it ? When was it ? Where was it ? How was it ? She is discussed by her dear friends with all the genteelest slang in vogue , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new drawl , and the perfection of polite indifference . A remarkable feature of the theme is , that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before — positively say things ! William Buffy carries one of these smartnesses from the place where he dines , down to the House , where the Whip for his party hands it about with his snuffbox , to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the Speaker ( who has had it privately insinuated into his own ear under the corner of his wig ) cries “
394871	395194	394574	394574	sir	9019	” three times without making an impression . And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk , is , that people hovering on the confines of Mr. Sladdery 's high connection , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too ; and to retail her at second - hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second - hand but considered equal to new , in inferior systems and to fainter stars . If there be any man of letters , art , or science , among these little dealers , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic crutches ! So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion . How within it ? Sir Leicester lying in his bed can speak a little , though with difficulty and indistinctness . He is enjoined to silence and to rest , and they have given him some opiate to lull his pain ; for his old enemy is very hard with him . He is never asleep , though sometimes he seem to fall into a dull waking doze . He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window , when he heard it was such inclement weather ; and his head to be so adjusted , that he could see the driving snow and sleet . He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day . Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil . The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write , and whispers “
395226	395364	395216	395216	He	8185	” He withdraws his hand , and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again , until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast , that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots . He began to look at them as soon as it was light . The day is not yet far spent , when he conceives it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her . It is very cold and wet . Let there be good fires . Let them know that she is expected . Please see to it yourself . He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys . “
395371	395394	395369	395369	George	368	” the old lady says to her son , who waits below to keep her company when she has a little leisure ; “
395413	395414	395402	395403	my Lady	996	” “
395423	395424	395421	395421	mother	11023	” “
395437	395438	395434	395435	my dear	9060	” “
395447	395448	395445	395445	mother	11023	” “
395486	395487	395464	395464	I	0	” “
395503	395504	395492	395492	You	368	” “
395561	395562	395563	395563	I	0	” “
395569	395570	395567	395567	mother	11023	” “
395655	395656	395662	395662	I	0	” “
395670	395671	395662	395662	I	0	” “
395680	395696	395678	395678	George	368	” the old lady returns , shaking her head , and parting her folded hands . “
395716	395717	395720	395720	her	996	” “
395723	395724	395720	395720	her	996	” “
395738	395739	395734	395734	she	996	” “
395744	395760	395761	395761	I	0	” says the trooper , glancing round him , and speaking in a lower voice , “
395820	396114	396115	396115	He	8211	” He is not far out . As all partings foreshadow the great final one,—so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be . My lady 's state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air . Dark and cold as the wintry day is , it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the grates , and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel . The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs . Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell 's place in the meantime : though pearl necklaces and rouge pots , however calculated to embellish Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the invalid under present circumstances . Volumnia not being supposed to know ( and indeed not knowing ) what is the matter , has found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations ; and consequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of the bed - linen , elaborate locomotion on tiptoe , vigilant peeping at her kinsman 's eyes , and one exasperating whisper to herself of “
396119	396135	396115	396115	He	8211	” In disproof of which superfluous remark , Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate “
396140	396227	396115	396115	He	8211	” Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing . Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow , and listens for the returning steps that he expects . In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had stepped out of an old picture - frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world , the silence is fraught with echoes of her own words , “
396233	396540	396115	396115	He	8211	” He has been under his valet 's hands this morning , to be made presentable ; and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow . He is propped with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a nicety , and he is wrapped in a responsible dressing gown . His eye - glass and his watch are ready to his hand . It is necessary — less to his own dignity now perhaps , than for her sake — that he should be seen as little disturbed , and as much himself , as may be . Women will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no exceptional case . He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else . He is very ill ; but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body , most courageously . The fair Volumnia being one of those sprightly girls who can not long continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon Boredom , soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of undisguisable yawns . Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son ; declaring that he positively is one of the finest figures she ever saw , and as soldierly a looking person she should think , as what 's his name , her favourite Life Guardsman — the man she doats on — the dearest of creatures — who was killed at Waterloo . Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise , and stares about him in such a confused way , that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain . “
396568	396578	396579	396579	George	368	” Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry . “
396590	396598	396583	396583	George	368	” The old housekeeper wipes her eyes . “
396607	396640	396604	396605	Sir Leicester	290	” Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ? Does he think , “
396671	396706	396709	396709	you	363	” It is of no use entreating him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does . In a thick crowd of sounds , but still intelligibly enough to be understood . “
396717	396718	396709	396709	you	363	” “
396742	396806	396728	396728	I	0	” Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell 's son , and that she was not to have told . But Mrs. Rouncewell protests , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better . “
396816	396842	396813	396814	Mrs. Rouncewell	363	” asks Sir Leicester . Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his disregard of the doctor 's injunctions , replies , in London . “
396847	396861	396728	396728	I	0	” Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house . “
396873	397019	397020	397021	Good Heaven	365	” The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him . Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little , to receive him . When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow , and listens again for the returning steps . A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels . He is lying thus , apparently forgetful of his newer and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son . Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside , makes his bow , squares his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself . “
397030	397035	397027	397028	George Rouncewell	368	” exclaims Sir Leicester . “
397043	397085	397037	397037	you	368	” The trooper needs to look at him , and to separate this sound from that sound , before he knows what he has said ; but doing this , and being a little helped by his mother , he replies : “
397106	397107	397104	397104	you	290	” “
397117	397124	397109	397109	I	0	” Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , “
397142	397166	397167	397167	I	0	” He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again . “
397175	397180	397167	397167	I	0	” says the trooper , “
397210	397211	397213	397213	you	290	” “
397226	397253	397255	397255	you	290	” The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly raises him , and turns him with his face more towards the window . “
397264	397269	397259	397260	your mother	9047	” returns Sir Leicester , “
397278	397304	397276	397276	you	290	” He signs to him with his hand not to go away . George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to . “
397312	397323	397307	397307	you	290	” It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this . “
397433	397434	397425	397425	I	0	” “
397441	397446	397435	397435	You	290	” observes Sir Leicester , “
397452	397459	397435	397435	You	290	” George makes his military bow . “
397486	397487	397488	397488	You	290	” “
397492	397504	397488	397488	You	290	” says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him “
397512	397513	397509	397510	George Rouncewell	368	” “
397530	397531	397535	397535	you	290	” “
397560	397572	397696	397696	you	0	” making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side ; “
397576	397694	397696	397696	you	0	” touching his lips . George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow . The different times when they were both young men ( the trooper much the younger of the two ) , and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold , arise before them both , and soften both . Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more . George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he desires to be . “
397733	397767	397720	397720	You	0	” He has put Sir Leicester 's sounder arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again , as he says these words . “
397774	397780	397768	397768	I	0	” he presently goes on , “
397892	397951	397882	397882	my	0	” Volumnia understands him perfectly ; and in truth he delivers himself with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a minute ago . The effort by which he does so , is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face . Nothing but the strength of his purpose enables him to make it . “
398050	398087	398044	398044	I	0	” The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the freshest bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive . “
398179	398193	398169	398169	you	8232	” Volumnia tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions to the letter . “
398323	398655	398314	398314	I	0	” His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something ludicrous in it ; but at this time it is serious and affecting . His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his gallant shielding of her , his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honorable , manly , and true . Nothing less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the commonest mechanic , nothing less worthy can be seen in the best - born gentleman . In such a light both aspire alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally . Overpowered by his exertions , he lays his head back on his pillows , and closes his eyes ; for not more than a minute ; when he again resumes his watching of the weather , and his attention to the muffled sounds . In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become installed as necessary to him . Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood . He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight , and mounts guard a little behind his mother 's chair . The day is now beginning to decline . The mist , and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself , are darker , and the blaze begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture . The gloom augments ; the bright gas springs up in the streets ; and the pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half thawed , twinkle gaspingly , like fiery fish out of water — as they are . The world , which has been rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell “
398659	398797	398314	398314	I	0	” begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to discuss its dear friend , with all the last new modes , as already mentioned . Now , does Sir Leicester become worse ; restless , uneasy , and in great pain . Volumnia lighting a candle ( with a predestined aptitude for doing something objectionable ) is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough . Yet it is very dark too ; as dark as it will be all night . By and by she tries again . No ! Put it out . It is not dark enough yet . His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to uphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late . “
398806	398811	398798	398800	Dear Sir Leicester	290	” she softly whispers , “
398905	398906	398895	398896	My Lady	996	” “
398927	398928	398920	398920	he	290	” “
398944	398945	398934	398935	Sir Leicester	290	” “
398960	399049	399051	399051	you	363	” He says it with a groan that wrings her heart . She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her . Therefore , she sits in the darkness for a while , without a word ; then gently begins to move about ; now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out . Finally he tells her , with recovered self - command , “
399080	399508	399858	399858	miss	9100	” When it is lighted , and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen . But they find that , however dejected and ill he is , he brightens when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms , and being sure that everything is ready to receive her . Poor pretence as it is , these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him . Midnight comes , and with it the same blank . The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement . Upon this wintry night it is so still , that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness . If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is heavier than before . The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed ( not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night ) , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester 's room . As the night lags tardily on — or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o'clock — they find a restless craving on him to know more about the weather , now he can not see it . Hence George , patrolling regularly every half hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , extends his march to the hall - door , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights ; the sleet still falling , and even the stone footways lying ankle - deep in icy sludge . Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the staircase — the second turning past the end of the carving and gilding — a cousinly room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester , banished for its crimes , and commanding in the day a solemn yard , planted with dried - up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black tea — is a prey to horrors of many kinds . Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may befal her little income , in the event , as she expresses it , “
399512	399826	399892	399892	I	0	” to Sir Leicester . Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only , and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world . An effect of these horrors is , that Volumnia finds she can not go to bed in her own room , or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl , and her fair form enrobed in drapery , and parade the mansion like a ghost : particularly haunting the rooms , warm and luxurious , prepared for one who still does not return . Solitude under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance . The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his patrolling , is an assurance of protection and company , both to mistress and maid , which renders them very acceptable in the small hours of the night . Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little decorative preparation to receive him ; at other times , they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion , and dialogues , not wholly free from acerbity , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the fender , was or was not falling into the fire when rescued ( to her great displeasure ) by her guardian genius the maid . “
399837	399848	399834	399835	Mr. George	562	” inquires Volumnia , adjusting her cowl over her head . “
399875	399876	399868	399868	he	290	” “
399883	399888	399878	399878	he	290	” inquires Volumnia tenderly . “
399911	399912	399892	399892	I	0	” “
399923	399924	399920	399921	Mr. George	562	” “
399939	399940	399941	399941	You	9100	” “
399953	399988	399950	399951	Miss Dedlock	287	” quoth the maid , sharply . But Volumnia answers No ! No ! She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment 's notice . She never should forgive herself “
399994	400059	399941	399941	You	9100	” and she was not on the spot . She declines to enter on the question , mooted by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her own room ( which is nearer to Sir Leicester 's ) ; but staunchly declares that on the spot she will remain . Volumnia further makes a merit of not having “
400062	400183	400192	400192	miss	9100	eye”—as if she had twenty or thirty — though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having most indisputably opened two within five minutes . But when it comes to four o'clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia 's constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to strengthen ; for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her ; that , in fact , howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of self - devotion , to desert the spot . So , when the trooper reappears with his “
400194	400206	400192	400192	miss	9100	” and when the maid protests , more sharply than before , “
400219	400226	400216	400217	Miss Dedlock	287	” she meekly rises and says , “
400235	400540	400231	400231	you	8244	” Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony . Accordingly , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his rounds , has the house to himself . There is no improvement in the weather . From the portico , from the eaves , from the parapet , from every ledge and post and pillar , drips the thawed snow . It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door — under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies . It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight ; even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the Ghost 's Walk , on the stone floor below . The trooper , his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house — no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold — goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm 's length . Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic boyhood , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms , and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house up - stairs , and of the foreboding “
400546	400615	400231	400231	you	8244	” he looks here and looks there , and reflects how he might see something now , which it would tax his boldness to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy . But it is all blank ; blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again ; blank as the oppressive silence . “
400625	400626	400622	400623	George Rouncewell	368	” “
400635	400636	400632	400633	Sir Leicester	290	” “
400643	400650	400632	400633	Sir Leicester	290	” The trooper shakes his head . “
400660	400771	400632	400633	Sir Leicester	290	” But he knows there is no such hope as that , and lays his head down without looking for an answer . Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell well lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night ; and , equally familiar with his unexpressed wish , extinguishes the light , and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day . The day comes like a phantom . Cold , colorless , and vague , it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue , as if it cried out , “
400788	400944	400774	400774	I	0	” IT was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country , and to close us in with streets . We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had traversed them by daylight , both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion had never slackened . It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them . They had stopped exhausted halfway up hills , they had been driven through streams of turbulent water , they had slipped down and become entangled with the harness ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the mishap was set right , I had never heard any variation in his cool “
400951	401219	400774	400774	I	0	” The steadiness and confidence with which he had directed our journey back , I could not account for . Never wavering , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London . A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o'clock in the morning , into Islington . I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time , that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute . I think I had some strong hope that he must be right , and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman ; but I tormented myself with questioning it , and discussing it , during the whole journey . What was to ensue when we found her , and what could compensate us for this loss of time , were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite tortured by long dwelling on such reflections , when we stopped . We stopped in a high - street , where there was a coach - stand . My companion paid our two drivers , who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself ; and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it , and into a hackney - coach he had chosen from the rest . “
401225	401234	400774	400774	I	0	” he said , as he did this . “
401240	401351	400774	400774	I	0	” I had not been conscious of it . But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage ; and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up ; and the wet had penetrated my dress . I assured him it was no matter ; but the driver , who knew him , would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw . They shook it out and strewed it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable . “
401357	401375	400774	400774	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up . “
401415	401447	401413	401413	you	9060	” I little thought what it was — little thought in how short a time I should understand it better ; but I assured him that I had confidence in him . “
401456	401460	401449	401449	you	9060	” he returned . “
401556	401563	401542	401542	You	9060	” said Mr. Bucket , warmly ; “
401569	401601	401602	401602	My	0	” I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no hindrance to him ; and that I hoped I should be none now . “
401605	401609	401602	401602	My	0	” he returned , “
401657	401929	401642	401642	She	1295	” With these encouraging words — they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances — he got upon the box , and we once more drove away . Where we drove , I neither knew then , nor have ever known since ; but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and worst streets in London . Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such streets , and we never failed to do so . Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare , or came to a larger building than the generality , well lighted . Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in consultation with others . Sometimes he would get down by an archway , or at a street corner , and mysteriously shew the light of his little lantern . This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many insects , and a fresh consultation would be held . By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits . Single police officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know , and point to him where to go . At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time . When it was finished he came to me , looking very busy and very attentive . “
401935	401941	401642	401642	She	1295	” he said to me , “
402015	402028	402009	402009	you	305	” Of course I got out directly , and took his arm . “
402039	402044	402009	402009	you	305	” said Mr. Bucket ; “
402049	402072	402009	402009	you	305	” Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly , as we crossed a street , I thought I knew the place . “
402078	402083	402009	402009	you	305	” I asked him . “
402086	402091	402009	402009	you	305	” said Mr. Bucket . “
402098	402099	402093	402093	you	305	” “
402106	402107	402093	402093	you	305	” “
402116	402278	402113	402114	my dear	9060	” said Mr. Bucket . We turned down it ; and as we went , shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half - past five . We passed on in silence , and as quickly as we could with such a foothold ; when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room . In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder , and my own name , from Mr. Woodcourt . I knew his voice very well . It was so unexpected , and so — I do n't know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful — to come upon it after my feverish wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes . It was like hearing his voice in a strange country . “
402298	402352	402281	402282	Miss Summerson	305	” He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business , and said so to dispense with any explanation . I told him that we had but just left a coach , and were going — but then I was obliged to look at my companion . “
402361	402370	402358	402359	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” he had caught the name from me ; “
402383	402405	402454	402454	lord	16162	” Mr. Woodcourt , disregarding my remonstrances , had hurriedly taken off his cloak , and was putting it about me . “
402414	402421	402454	402454	lord	16162	” said Mr. Bucket , assisting , “
402427	402428	402454	402454	lord	16162	” “
402435	402451	402454	402454	lord	16162	” said Mr. Woodcourt . I do n't know whether to me or my companion . “
402456	402467	402454	402454	lord	16162	” exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself . “
402473	402494	402470	402470	you	305	” It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak . “
402501	402506	402495	402495	I	0	” said Mr. Woodcourt . “
402519	402520	402507	402507	I	0	” “
402529	402530	402523	402523	me	0	” “
402649	402728	402646	402646	I	0	” His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his unaffected devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ? How thankless I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me , when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : “
402745	402754	402755	402756	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” We now turned into another narrow street . “
402758	402773	402755	402756	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , “
402801	402814	402799	402799	you	497	” He was so quick that he saw it in an instant . “
402833	402834	402837	402837	sir	9019	” “
402839	402844	402837	402837	sir	9019	” said Mr. Bucket . “
402875	402911	402873	402873	him	409	” The last police officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind us . I was not aware of it until he struck in , on my saying I heard some one crying . “
402919	402923	402924	402924	It	409	” he returned . “
402930	402931	402924	402924	It	409	” “
402937	402942	402924	402924	It	409	” said Mr. Bucket , “
402986	402987	402968	402968	I	0	” “
403009	403015	403006	403007	Mr. Bucket	734	” said the other man . “
403028	403029	403016	403016	She	2505	” “
403036	403040	403016	403016	She	2505	” he returned . “
403053	403122	403048	403048	your	9019	” All this passed in a whisper , a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning . In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked . The door was opened , after he had knocked twice ; and he went in , leaving us standing in the street . “
403126	403131	403048	403048	your	9019	” said Mr. Woodcourt ; “
403153	403154	403149	403149	me	0	” “
403160	403164	403155	403155	You	0	” I answered . “
403188	403189	403190	403190	I	0	” “
403212	403213	403214	403214	I	0	” “
403220	403224	403214	403214	I	0	” I said . “
403237	403264	403234	403234	your	0	” After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face . “
403273	403277	403270	403271	Miss Summerson	305	” he said , “
403363	403424	403355	403355	she	4757	” We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it smelt close too from being up all night . In the passage , behind the door , stood a scared , sorrowful - looking little man in a grey coat , who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke meekly . “
403436	403440	403433	403434	Mr. Bucket	734	” said he . “
403485	403533	403471	403471	she	4757	” We went down - stairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be . In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face . “
403538	403547	403471	403471	she	4757	” said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , “
403591	403612	403613	403613	My	0	” She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me . “
403617	403640	403613	403613	My	0	” said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , “
403711	403749	403704	403704	I	0	” He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so unwelcome , that I was going to offer an apology , when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself . “
403755	403759	403797	403797	sir	9019	” said he , “
403780	403781	403782	403782	My	0	” “
403788	403793	403797	403797	sir	9019	” cried Mr. Snagsby . “
403810	403811	403802	403802	I	0	” “
403818	403826	403829	403829	her	8303	” pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , “
403918	403959	403886	403886	you	497	” As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire , and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the fender ; talking all the time . “
404026	404055	404016	404016	I	0	” Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby . “
404137	404157	404160	404161	Mr. Bucket	734	” Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , relented a little , and faltered , what did Mr. Bucket mean ? “
404164	404208	404160	404161	Mr. Bucket	734	” he repeated ; and I saw , by his face , that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter — to my own great agitation ; for I knew then how important it must be ; “
404232	404239	404214	404214	he	734	” Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why . “
404242	404247	404214	404214	he	734	” said Mr. Bucket . “
404371	404387	404367	404369	that young lady	7008	” Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time . “
404541	404556	404529	404530	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” Mrs. Snagsby shook her head , and put her handkerchief to her eyes . “
404561	404568	404529	404530	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” said Mr. Bucket , excitedly . “
404706	404753	404684	404685	the Lord	10540	” He so thoroughly meant what he said now , that I involuntarily clasped my hands , and felt the room turning away from me . But it stopped . Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again . “
404765	404775	404755	404756	Mrs. Snagsby	411	” said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , “
404835	404850	404830	404830	your	411	” In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door . “
404866	404867	404856	404856	you	411	” “
404870	404873	404856	404856	you	411	” said I. “
404879	404920	404921	404921	You	411	” It was my mother 's . A pencil - writing , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet . Folded roughly like a letter , and directed to me , at my guardian 's . “
404926	404930	404921	404921	You	411	” he said ; “
404952	404969	404970	404970	I	0	” It had been written in portions , at different times . I read what follows : “
405080	405081	405074	405074	her	2134	” “
405091	405096	405083	405083	I	0	” said my companion , “
405115	405124	405111	405111	I	0	” The next was written at another time . “
405233	405234	405199	405199	others	9053	” “
405238	405243	405199	405199	others	9053	” said Mr. Bucket . “
405252	405272	405273	405273	I	0	” Those , too , were written at another time . To all appearance , almost in the dark . “
405342	405359	405371	405371	my	0	” Mr. Bucket , supporting me with his arm , lowered me gently into my chair . “
405394	405662	405663	405665	My poor girl	4907	” I did as he required ; but I was left there a long time , praying for my unhappy mother . They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them , and speaking to her often . At length he came in with Mr. Bucket ; and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain . There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions , if she were soothed , and not alarmed . The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were , how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went . Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them . Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my solicitation went in with us . The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down . They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air . She was not pretty , and looked weak and poor ; but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild . I kneeled on the ground beside her , and put her poor head on my shoulder ; whereupon she drew her arm round my neck , and burst into tears . “
405667	405688	405663	405665	My poor girl	4907	” said I , laying my face against her forehead ; for indeed I was crying too , and trembling ; “
405717	405740	405741	405741	We	8351	” She began piteously declaring that she did n't mean any harm , she did n't mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby ! “
405748	405751	405741	405741	We	8351	” said I. “
405761	405762	405757	405757	you	4907	” “
405786	405787	405783	405784	Mrs. Snagsby	411	” “
405794	405797	405788	405788	I	0	” said I. “
405803	405804	405805	405805	I	0	” “
405943	405977	405929	405929	I	0	” It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her : which she did , I must say , with a good deal of contrition : before she could be got beyond this . “
405985	405988	405978	405978	She	8355	” said I. “
405991	406000	405978	405978	She	8355	” cried the girl , shaking her head . “
406048	406049	406034	406034	you	0	” “
406057	406069	406052	406052	Guster	412	” said he , at first not knowing what to say . “
406075	406076	406079	406079	she	8355	” “
406085	406099	406079	406079	she	8355	” said the girl , looking at me with wide - open eyes , “
406197	406231	406167	406167	she	8355	” As I watched her face , and soothed her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm . “
406237	406250	406235	406235	dear	1146	” cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands , “
406308	406309	406310	406310	You	0	” “
406317	406320	406310	406310	You	0	” said I. “
406328	406329	406331	406331	I	0	” “
406359	406367	406353	406353	I	0	” Angry with her , poor soul ! “
406544	406545	406535	406535	she	8372	” “
406552	406553	406548	406548	she	8372	” “
406556	406565	406548	406548	she	8372	” cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry , “
406602	406633	406583	406584	Mrs. Snagsby	411	” Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me . Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street . Mr. Woodcourt hesitated , but I said , “
406640	406646	406647	406647	You	0	” and Mr. Bucket added , “
406664	407050	407051	407052	Miss Summerson	305	” I have the most confused impressions of that walk . I recollect that it was neither night nor day ; that morning was dawning , but the streetlamps were not yet put out ; that the sleet was still falling , and that all the ways were deep with it . I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets . I recollect the wet housetops , the clogged and bursting gutters and water - spouts , the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed , the narrowness of the courts by which we went . At the same time I remember , that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my hearing ; that I could feel her resting on my arm ; that the stained house fronts put on human shapes and looked at me ; that great water - gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head , or in the air ; and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real . At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate , and where the morning faintly struggled in . The gate was closed . Beyond it , was a burial - ground — a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring ; but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonored graves and stones , hemmed in by filthy houses , with a few dull lights in their windows , and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease . On the step at the gate , drenched in the fearful wet of such a place , which oozed and splashed down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying — Jenny , the mother of the dead child . I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me , with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said . I did so , as I thought . I did so , as I am sure . “
407072	407110	407065	407065	They	8377	” They changed clothes at the cottage . I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves ; but I attached no meaning to them in any other connection . “
407115	407120	407122	407122	one	767	” said Mr. Bucket , “
407158	407397	407399	407399	she	8383	” I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant . I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child . She lay there , with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate , and seeming to embrace it . She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother . She lay there , a distressed , unsheltered , senseless creature . She who had brought my mother 's letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me ! I saw , but did not comprehend , the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt 's face . I saw , but did not comprehend , his touching the other on the breast to keep him back . I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something . But my understanding for all this was gone . I even heard it said between them : “
407402	407403	407404	407404	She	8383	” “
407427	407650	407651	407652	Dame Trot	729	” I passed on to the gate , and stooped down . I lifted the heavy head , put the long dank hair aside , and turned the face . And it was my mother , cold and dead . I PROCEED to other passages of my narrative . From the goodness of all about me , I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved . I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not dwell upon my sorrow . I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it , if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy . I proceed to other passages of my narrative . During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us . When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way — though I could have done that sooner , if he would have believed me — I resumed my work , and my chair beside his . He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone . “
407654	407664	407651	407652	Dame Trot	729	” said he , receiving me with a kiss , “
407717	407718	407667	407668	the Growlery	9664	” “
407727	407730	407667	407668	the Growlery	9664	” said I. “
407739	407743	407750	407750	itself	313	” he returned , “
407752	407778	407667	407668	the Growlery	9664	” I thought his tone sounded sorrowful ; but , looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile . “
407782	407797	407667	407668	the Growlery	9664	” he repeated ; and his tone did not sound sorrowful , I found , “
407826	407827	407818	407818	Ada	319	” “
407835	407839	407831	407831	you	9060	” said I , “

408010	408140	408141	408141	Dear	1146	” My dear girl had been to see us lately , every day : sometimes twice in a day . But we had foreseen , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself . We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him , to be sparing of her visits at our house . My guardian 's delicacy had soon perceived this , and had tried to convey to her that he thought she was right . “
408148	408151	408141	408141	Dear	1146	” said I. “
408160	408161	408141	408141	Dear	1146	” “
408176	408181	408162	408162	He	8400	” replied my guardian . “
408210	408217	408190	408190	he	8400	” I could not help adding , “
408221	408222	408190	408190	he	8400	” “
408231	408236	408228	408229	Dame Trot	729	” returned my guardian , “
408318	408347	408296	408296	He	350	” His gentleness and consideration for Richard , whenever we spoke of him , touched me so , that I was always silent on this subject very soon . “
408383	408388	408378	408381	one of their suitors	8408	” pursued my guardian . “
408416	408442	408408	408408	I	0	” He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was , and leaned on the back of my chair instead . “
408557	408580	408582	408582	he	8416	” But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt . “
408586	408591	408582	408582	he	8416	” returned my guardian . “
408636	408668	408629	408629	you	9060	” In answer to this question , which was oddly abrupt , I said I liked her very much , and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be . “
408674	408679	408629	408629	you	9060	” said my guardian . “
408696	408722	408687	408689	Morgan - ap	523	” That was what I meant , I acknowledged ; though he was a very harmless person , even when we had more of him . “
408738	408743	408744	408744	I	0	” said my guardian . “
408767	408849	408763	408764	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	” No . And yet — My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say . I had nothing to say . At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say . I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate , but I could hardly have explained why , even to myself . Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else . “
408853	408858	408763	408764	Mrs. Woodcourt	526	” said my guardian , “
408900	408945	408889	408889	she	526	” Yes . That was undeniable . I had nothing to say against it . I could not have suggested a better arrangement ; but I was not quite easy in my mind . Esther , Esther , why not ? Esther , think ! “
408964	408965	408968	408969	little woman	2052	” “
408971	409000	408968	408969	little woman	2052	” Quite sure . I had had a moment 's time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure . “
409003	409008	408968	408969	little woman	2052	” said my guardian . “
409017	409018	408968	408969	little woman	2052	” “
409022	409114	409115	409115	You	8431	” I repeated , going on with my work . It was a cover for his book - table that I happened to be ornamenting . It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey , and never resumed . I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly . After I had explained the pattern to him , and all the great effects that were to come out by - and - by , I thought I would go back to our last theme . “
409152	409153	409146	409146	you	8431	” “
409162	409163	409146	409146	you	8431	” “

409190	409193	409173	409173	I	0	” said I. “
409200	409214	409173	409173	I	0	” returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very deliberate manner . “
409377	409378	409373	409373	Woodcourt	497	” “
409386	409390	409381	409381	he	497	” I asked . “
409396	409403	409406	409407	an oracle	8450	” returned my guardian , smiling , “
409507	409508	409509	409513	The poor of that place	8455	” “
409531	409532	409529	409529	guardian	9676	” “
409547	410082	410083	410084	My dear	9060	” We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House . But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that accounted for it I considered . I now began to visit my dear girl every day , in the dull dark corner where she lived . The morning was my usual time ; but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane . They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in ( being quite at home , I never knocked ) , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet . On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent . At other times he would be writing , or reading papers in the Cause , at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed . Sometimes I would come upon him , lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes 's office . Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood , lounging about , and biting his nails . I often met him wandering in Lincoln 's Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , O how different , how different ! That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes 's office , I knew very well . It was not a large amount in the beginning ; he had married in debt ; and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes 's shoulder being at the wheel — as I still heard it was . My dear made the best of housekeepers , and tried hard to save ; but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day . She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star . She adorned and graced it so , that it became another place . Paler than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so unshadowed , that I half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his ruinous career . I went one day to dine with them , while I was under this impression . As I turned into Symond 's Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out . She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony . Ada had already told me that she called every Monday at five o'clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her largest reticule of documents on her arm . “
410086	410090	410083	410084	My dear	9060	” she began . “
410137	410138	410120	410120	Our	8461	” “
410147	410150	410140	410140	Richard	320	” said I. “
410167	410168	410171	410171	he	8465	” “
410177	410182	410171	410171	he	8465	” returned Miss Flite . “
410219	410220	410221	410221	I	0	” “
410232	410235	410224	410224	you	0	” said I. “
410239	410244	410224	410224	you	0	” returned Miss Flite , “
410299	410318	410279	410279	He	8467	” It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise . “
410326	410347	410279	410279	He	8467	” pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear , with an air of equal patronage and mystery , “
410378	410379	410374	410374	Ye	2714	” “
410382	410385	410402	410403	my executor	8477	” said I. “
410390	410401	410402	410403	my executor	8477	” repeated Miss Flite , in her most genteel accents , “
410446	410456	410457	410457	I	0	” It made me sigh to think of him . “
410464	410473	410457	410457	I	0	” said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , “
410524	410552	410572	410573	Miss Flite	423	” She carefully opened her reticule a little way , and shewed me a folded piece of paper inside , as the appointment of which she spoke . “
410568	410569	410559	410559	I	0	” “
410575	410608	410572	410573	Miss Flite	423	” said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest . She nodded several times , and her face became overcast and gloomy . “
410681	410844	410849	410850	Miss Summerson	305	” The poor soul kissed me , with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her ; and went her way . Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me . This was not a cheering preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard ( who arrived within a minute or two after me ) brought him to share our dinner . Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together , helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink . Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me . He came to the window where I was sitting , and began upon Symond 's Inn . “
410862	410881	410849	410850	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Vholes , smearing the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me . “
410890	410893	410849	410850	Miss Summerson	305	” said I. “
410900	410905	410898	410898	miss	9100	” returned Mr. Vholes . “
410942	410955	410956	410956	I	0	” I thanked Mr. Vholes , and said he was quite well . “
410972	410977	410956	410956	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes , “
411045	411046	411038	411039	Mr. C	677	” “
411055	411056	411047	411047	He	677	” “
411060	411116	411047	411047	He	677	” said Mr. Vholes . He stood behind me , with his long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms ; feeling the pimples on his face as if they were ornaments , and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature . “
411129	411133	411126	411126	I	0	” he resumed . “
411141	411145	411134	411135	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” I answered . “
411156	411157	411047	411047	He	677	” “
411167	411170	411047	411047	He	677	” said I. “
411174	411215	411216	411217	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Vholes . So slow , so eager , so bloodless and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser , and there were something of the Vampire in him . “
411219	411254	411216	411217	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , “
411267	411326	411263	411264	Mr. C	677	” I begged he would excuse me for discussing it . They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him ( a little indignantly ) , and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter . When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life . “
411330	411336	411263	411264	Mr. C	677	” assented Mr. Vholes again . “
411456	411457	411438	411438	I	0	” “
411480	411484	411477	411478	Mr. Vholes	680	” said I , “
411505	411538	411539	411540	Miss Summerson	305	” Mr. Vholes , with a noiseless cough — or rather gasp — into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that . “
411542	411546	411539	411540	Miss Summerson	305	” he said , “
411729	411730	411721	411722	Mr. C	677	” “
411739	411740	411721	411722	Mr. C	677	” “
411744	411760	411721	411722	Mr. C	677	” returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner , “
412057	412457	412051	412051	you	9019	” He broke off thus , in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room . By this time , I too well understood Mr. Vholes 's scrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability , not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client 's progress . We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously . I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes ( who took off his gloves to dine ) , though he sat opposite to me at the small table ; for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host 's face . I found Richard thin and languid , slovenly in his dress , abstracted in his manner forcing his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness . About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry , there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether I can not use the expression that he looked old . There is a ruin of youth which is not like age ; and into such a ruin , Richard 's youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away . He ate little , and seemed indifferent what it was ; shewed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be ; and was quick , even with Ada . I thought , at first , that his old - light - hearted manner was all gone ; but it shone out of him sometimes , as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass . His laugh had not quite left him either ; but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful . Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there ; and we talked of the old times pleasantly . These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile . He rose shortly after dinner , and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office . “
412465	412469	412472	412473	Mr. C	677	” cried Richard . “
412475	412479	412472	412473	Mr. C	677	” he returned , “
412544	412890	412542	412542	Mr.	8524	” Richard expressed himself quite sure of that , and lighted Mr. Vholes out . On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow , indeed ! He was so defiant about it , that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes . Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers . My dear girl had a cottage piano there , and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard 's favorites ; the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes . I sat between them , at my dear girl 's side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice . I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason . She had been singing some time , rising between - whiles to bend over him and speak to him ; when Mr. Woodcourt came in . Then he sat down by Richard ; and half playfully , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt , and where he had been all day . Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily consenting , they went out together . They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano , and me still sitting beside her . When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist . She put her left hand in mine ( I was sitting on that side ) , but kept her right upon the keys — going over and over them , without striking any note . “
412896	412903	412891	412891	Esther	305	” she said , breaking silence , “
412935	412988	412931	412931	you	0	” I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John 's house , and had known us all there ; and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and — and so forth . “
412992	412996	412931	412931	you	0	” said Ada ; “
413013	413052	413053	413053	Esther	305	” I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way , and to say no more about it . So I said as much . I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling . “
413079	413125	413074	413074	You	305	” I teach ! I said no more ; for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak ; that it was she who had something to say to me . “
413181	413182	413170	413170	I	0	” “
413192	413193	413186	413186	I	0	” “
413271	413310	413311	413311	You	305	” In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still — a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them — I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones . “
413365	413398	413399	413399	I	0	” She spoke so modestly and softly , and her trembling hand expressed such agitation , as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes ! My dear , dear girl ! “
413509	413537	413499	413499	him	8532	” I felt her trembling more . I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was . “
413546	413563	413544	413544	Esther	305	” She stopped a minute . Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion . “
413625	413645	413654	413654	Esther	305	” Her hand stopped now . She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine . “
413773	413792	413805	413805	they	8547	” O , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me ! “
413827	413849	413822	413822	I	0	” I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was ? Sobbing and weeping , she replied : “
413860	414291	414292	414292	My	0	” THE days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened , can never fade in my remembrance . I never see it , and I never wish to see it , now ; I have been there only once since ; but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place , which will shine for ever . Not a day passed , without my going there , of course . At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , idly playing the piano , and talking in his usual vivacious strain . Now , besides my very much mistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety , too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada 's life . I clearly perceived , too , that Ada shared my feelings . I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole , and try delicately to explain myself . My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold . I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for Somers Town . As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole , and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me . However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it . I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole 's door — literally with a hand , for the knocker was gone — and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the lid of a water - butt with a poker , to light the fire with . Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me . Now , who should receive me , he asked ? Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies ? Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ? Or would I have all the daughters at once , in a perfect nosegay ? I replied , half defeated already , that I wished to speak to himself only , if he would give me leave . “
414303	414320	414292	414292	My	0	” he said , bringing his chair near mine , and breaking into his fascinating smile , “
414333	414355	414360	414361	Miss Summerson	305	” I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter . “
414363	414372	414360	414361	Miss Summerson	305	” said he , with the frankest gaiety , “
414453	414473	414474	414474	I	0	” Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject . “
414481	414491	414474	414474	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , with his airy laugh , “
414507	414508	414509	414510	Mr. Skimpole	358	” “
414512	414522	414509	414510	Mr. Skimpole	358	” said I , raising my eyes to his , “
414542	414543	414531	414531	you	358	” “
414565	414572	414563	414563	D	755	” said Mr. Skimpole , brightly . “
414579	414580	414563	414563	D	755	” “
414586	414591	414592	414592	you	358	” I went on , “
414617	414618	414620	414620	me	0	” “
414622	414627	414620	414620	me	0	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
414636	414637	414632	414632	they	8553	” “
414644	414645	414632	414632	they	8553	” “
414650	414660	414632	414632	they	8553	” said Mr. Skimpole , with a delighted countenance . “
414720	414754	414715	414715	you	358	” I was coming to the point with great difficulty , when he took me by both hands , and , with a radiant face and in the liveliest way , anticipated it . “
414956	414984	414951	414951	them	8561	” Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me , as he reasoned thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing . “
414987	415004	414951	414951	them	8561	” he said , pursuing his argument , in his tone of light - hearted conviction , “
415132	415215	415128	415128	I	0	” He finished by genially kissing my hand , and thanking me . Nothing but Miss Summerson 's fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him . I was much disconcerted : but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it . I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that . “
415219	415223	415128	415128	I	0	” said I , “
415308	415309	415303	415303	I	0	” “
415320	415331	415317	415318	Miss Summerson	305	” he returned , inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows . “
415335	415370	415371	415371	You	305	” He thought about it for a little while , with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face ; then quite gave it up , and said , in his most engaging manner : “
415382	415449	415371	415371	You	305	” I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question ; but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand , in the gentlest words I could use , that his conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations . He was much amused and interested when he heard this , and said , “
415454	415459	415371	415371	You	305	” with ingenuous simplicity . “
415491	415496	415497	415497	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
415547	415557	415544	415544	you	305	” I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this . “
415564	415573	415561	415561	you	305	” said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , “
415581	415606	415607	415607	My	0	” I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to betray my guardian 's confidence for a bribe . “
415612	415626	415627	415627	I	0	” he returned , with a candid hilarity that was all his own . “
415633	415634	415627	415627	I	0	” “
415640	415643	415637	415638	Mr. Bucket	734	” said I. “
415646	415650	415637	415638	Mr. Bucket	734	” said he . “
415703	415725	415699	415699	I	0	” I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question . “
415730	415735	415699	415699	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
415819	415861	415815	415817	Cæsar 's wife	8579	” Anything to equal the lightness of his manner , and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself , as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else ! “
416332	416371	416329	416329	he	358	” I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition , and therefore took my leave . Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by “
416375	416587	416372	416373	Little Coavinses	359	” and accompanied me himself . He entertained me , on the way , with a variety of delightful conversation ; and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends . As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history . A coolness arose between him and my guardian , based chiefly on the foregoing grounds , and on his having heartlessly disregarded my guardian 's entreaties ( as we afterwards learned from Ada ) in reference to Richard . His being heavily in my guardian 's debt , had nothing to do with their separation . He died some five years afterwards , and left a diary behind him , with letters and other materials towards his Life ; which was published , and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child . It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book . It was this . “
416606	416865	416601	416604	the Incarnation of Selfishness	8609	” And now I come to a part of my story , touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred . Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind , associated with my poor old face , had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone — gone like my infancy or my childhood . I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them . And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages : which I see now , not so very very far before me . The months were gliding away ; and my dear girl , sustained by the hopes she had confided to me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner . Richard , more worn and haggard , haunted the Court day after day ; listlessly sat there the whole day long , when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned ; and became one of the stock sights of the place . I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there . So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea , that he used to avow in his cheerful moments , that he should never have breathed the fresh air now “
416870	417471	416868	416868	Woodcourt	497	” It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention , for a few hours at a time ; and rouse him , even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on . My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more desperately for her sake . I have no doubt that his desire to retrieve what he had lost , was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the madness of a gamester . I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours . When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together . One evening , he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock . I could not leave , as I usually did , quite punctually to the time , for I was working for my dear girl , and had a few stitches more to do , to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour , when I bundled up my little work - basket , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried down - stairs . Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk . When we came to the usual place of meeting — it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before — my guardian was not there . We waited half an hour , walking up and down ; but there were no signs of him . We agreed that he was either prevented from coming , or that he had come , and gone away ; and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me . It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting . We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way . I did not thank him , in words , for what he had done — my appreciation of it had risen above all words then — but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly . Arriving at home and going up - stairs , we found that my guardian was out , and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too . We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl , when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart ; the very same room , from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight , in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise . We were standing by the opened window , looking down into the street , when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me . I learned in a moment that he loved me . I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him . I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion , was devoted , generous , faithful love . O , too late to know it now , too late , too late . That was the first ungrateful thought I had . Too late . “
417476	417481	417473	417473	I	0	” he told me , “
417521	417522	417525	417526	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” “
417532	417537	417525	417526	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” I entreated him . “
417557	417558	417546	417546	I	0	” “
417567	417571	417546	417546	I	0	” said he , “

417623	417627	417620	417621	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” cried I , “
417700	417813	417814	417814	I	0	” I said it with a stronger heart ; for when he praised me thus , and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it . It was not too late for that . Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to - night , I could be worthier of it all through my life . And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him , when I thought so . He broke the silence . “
417838	417858	417862	417862	her	8613	” and the deep earnestness with which he said it , at once strengthened me and made me weep , “
417967	418020	417962	417962	I	0	” Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the Angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained ! I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me . “
418025	418029	417962	417962	I	0	” said I , “
418060	418084	418086	418086	I	0	” I had to think again of being more deserving of his love , and his affliction , before I could go on . “
418182	418207	418235	418235	you	497	” He covered his eyes with his hand , and turned away his head . How could I ever be worthy of those tears ? “
418316	418339	418340	418340	I	0	” He took my hand , and kissed it . He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged . “
418351	418355	418346	418346	you	497	” said I , “
418366	418367	418368	418368	I	0	” “
418371	418375	418368	418368	I	0	” he answered . “
418402	418403	418392	418392	him	313	” “
418410	418419	418421	418421	Heaven	365	” said I , giving him my hand ; “
418429	418430	418431	418431	I	0	” “
418440	418444	418431	418431	I	0	” he answered ; “

418469	418474	418467	418467	Richard	320	” I exclaimed involuntarily , “
418484	418485	418477	418477	he	313	” “
418509	418547	418500	418502	dear Miss Summerson	305	” One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon , before he left me . I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take , if I reserved it . “
418551	418555	418500	418502	dear Miss Summerson	305	” said I , “
418600	418613	418615	418615	my	0	” It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied . “
418621	418625	418615	418615	my	0	” said I , “
418676	418677	418678	418678	I	0	” “
418683	418687	418688	418688	you	0	” he returned ; “
418694	418695	418691	418692	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” “
418702	418706	418696	418696	You	497	” said I , “
418796	418816	418773	418773	I	0	” He fervently replied , that indeed indeed they would have been . I gave him my hand again . “
418821	418825	418773	418773	I	0	” I said ; “
418830	418831	418773	418773	I	0	” “
418856	418857	418773	418773	I	0	” “
418860	418861	418773	418773	I	0	” “
418870	419251	418773	418773	I	0	” He lest me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street . His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me , that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again , and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears . But they were not tears of regret and sorrow . No . He had called me the beloved of his life , and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then ; and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words . My first wild thought had died away . It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented . How easy my path ; how much easier than his ! I HAD not the courage to see any one that night . I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me . I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep . I had no need of any light to read my guardian 's letter by , for I knew it by heart . I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of integrity and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow . I was up very early in the morning , and called Charley to come for a walk . We bought flowers for the breakfast - table , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible . We were so early , that I had good time still for Charley 's lesson , before breakfast ; Charley ( who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar ) came through it with great applause ; and we were altogether very notable . When my guardian appeared , he said , “
419264	419365	419368	419369	Dame Durden	388	” And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinwillinwodd , expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it . This was all so pleasant , that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before . After breakfast , I waited my opportunity , and peeped about a little , until I saw my guardian in his own room — the room of last night — by himself . Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me . “
419371	419389	419368	419369	Dame Durden	388	” said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing . “
419394	419395	419368	419369	Dame Durden	388	” “
419406	419407	419368	419369	Dame Durden	388	” “
419416	419421	419413	419414	Dame Durden	388	” said my guardian , “
419427	419481	419482	419482	he	8620	” He had laid down his pen , and leaned back in his chair looking at me . I have often spoken of his bright face , but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good . There was a high happiness upon it , which made me think , “
419492	419493	419482	419482	he	8620	” “
419498	419510	419513	419514	Dame Durden	388	” said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , “
419520	419609	419513	419514	Dame Durden	388	” He had never yet altered his old manner . I loved it , and him , so much , that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair , which was always put at his side — for sometimes I read to him , and sometimes I talked to him , and sometimes I silently worked by him — I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast . But I found I did not disturb it at all . “
419613	419617	419610	419611	Dear guardian	11276	” said I , “

419722	419757	419713	419713	I	0	” said my guardian , nodding his head . He had put his arm about me , as if there were something to protect me from ; and looked in my face , smiling . “
419761	419765	419806	419806	him	8626	” said I , “
419776	419796	419806	419806	him	8626	“ And then I said , Bleak House was thinning fast ; and so it was , my dear . ”
419797	419802	419803	419803	I	0	“ And I said , ”
419808	419814	419803	419803	I	0	“ but its mistress remained . ”

419844	419912	419842	419842	I	0	“ I know how you have felt all that has happened , and how considerate you have been . As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject . Perhaps I ought to do so . I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please . ”
419913	419916	419917	419917	he	8626	“ See , ”
419921	419974	419917	419917	he	8626	“ what a sympathy there must be between us ! I have had nothing else , poor Rick excepted — it 's a large exception — in my mind . When you came in , I was full of it . When shall we give Bleak House its mistress , little woman ? ”
419975	419980	419842	419842	I	0	“ When you please . ”
419981	419985	419917	419917	he	8626	“ Next month ? ”
419986	419993	419917	419917	he	8626	“ Next month , dear guardian . ”
419994	420051	420053	420054	my guardian	9683	“ The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life — the day on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than any other man in the world — the day on which I give Bleak House its little mistress — shall be next month , then , ”
420110	420117	420119	420119	he	734	“ Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , ”
420125	420184	420186	420187	Mr. Bucket	734	“ with all apologies for intruding , will you allow me to order up a person that 's on the stairs , and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ? Thank you . Be so good as chair that there Member in this direction , will you ? ”
420249	420257	420258	420258	he	734	“ Now you see , Mr. Jarndyce , ”
420281	420338	420340	420341	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you know me , and Miss Summerson knows me . This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is Smallweed . The discounting line is his line principally , and he 's what you may call a dealer in bills . That 's about what you are , you know , ai n't you ? ”
420381	420389	420391	420392	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Now , Moral , you know ! ”
420398	420501	420391	420392	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Do n't you contradict when there ai n't no occasion , and you wo n't be took in that way . Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I address myself to you . I 've been negociating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal . His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook , Marine Store Dealer — a relation of this gentleman 's , that you saw in his life - time , if I do n't mistake ? ”
420505	420508	420391	420392	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Yes . ”
420509	420517	420519	420520	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Well ! You are to understand , ”
420522	420562	420519	420520	Mr. Bucket	734	“ that this gentleman he come into Krook 's property , and a good deal of Magpie property there was . Vast lots of waste paper among the rest . Lord bless you , of no use to nobody ! ”
420656	420685	420687	420688	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to rummage , do n't you see ? ”
420690	420698	420700	420701	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ To which ? Say that again , ”
420710	420714	420716	420717	Mr. Bucket	734	“ To rummage , ”
420719	420752	420716	420717	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Being a prudent man , and accustomed to take care of your own affairs , you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into ; do n't you ? ”
420753	420759	420761	420762	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Of course I do , ”
420764	420770	420772	420773	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Of course you do , ”
420777	420800	420772	420773	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and much to blame you would be if you did n't . And so you chance to find , you know , ”
420823	420849	420816	420817	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ and so you chance to find , you know , a paper , with the signature of Jarndyce to it . Do n't you ? ”
420865	420920	420922	420923	Mr. Bucket	734	“ And coming to look at that paper , at your full leisure and convenience — all in good time , for you 're not curious to read it , and why should you be!—what do you find it to be but a Will , you see . That 's the drollery of it , ”
420957	420970	420922	420923	Mr. Bucket	734	“ what do you find it to be , but a Will ? ”
420971	420989	420991	420992	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ I do n't know that it 's good as a will , or as anything else , ”
421054	421058	421060	421061	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Notwithstanding which , ”
421063	421086	421060	421061	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it , having a very tender mind of your own . ”
421087	421101	421107	421107	his	539	“ Eh ? What do you say I have got of my own ? ”
421113	421119	421103	421104	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ A very tender mind . ”
421120	421128	421130	421131	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ Ho ! Well , go on , ”
421133	421236	421130	421131	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ And as you 've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case , of the same name ; and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter , and books , and papers , and what not , and never liking to part with 'em , and always a going to teach himself to read ; you begin to think — and you never was more correct in your born days—‘Ecod , if I do n't look about me , I may get into trouble regarding this will . ’ ”
421237	421248	421250	421252	the old man	1258	“ Now , mind how you put it , Bucket , ”
421262	421291	421256	421256	his	1258	“ Speak up ; none of your brimstone tricks . Pick me up ; I want to hear better . O Lord , I am shaken to bits ! ”
421323	421353	421319	421319	his	539	“ O my bones ! O dear ! I 've no breath in my body ! I 'm worse than the chattering , clattering , brimstone pig at home ! ”
421366	421394	421354	421355	Mr. Bucket	734	“ So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , do n't you ? ”
421460	421516	421518	421519	Mr. Bucket	734	“ And I go into the business with you,—very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your well - founded fears , that you will - get - your - self - in - to - a - most precious line if you do n't come out with that there will , ”
421523	421574	421518	421519	Mr. Bucket	734	“ and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce , on no conditions . If it should prove to be valuable , you trusting yourself to him for your reward ; that 's about where it is , ai n't it ? ”
421575	421582	421583	421584	Mr. Smallweed	539	“ That 's what was agreed , ”
421593	421599	421601	421602	Mr. Bucket	734	“ In consequence of which , ”
421619	421651	421601	421602	Mr. Bucket	734	“ you 've got that will upon your person at the present time ; and the only thing that remains for you to do is , just to Out with it ! ”
421843	421944	421837	421837	he	734	“ Had n't settled how to make their market of it . Quarrelled and hinted about it . I laid out twenty pound upon it . First , the avaricious grandchildren split upon him , on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably long , and then they split on one another . Lord ! there ai n't one of the family that would n't sell the other for a pound or two , except the old lady — and she 's only out of it because she 's too weak in her mind to drive a bargain . ”
421945	421949	421951	421952	my guardian	9683	“ Mr. Bucket , ”
421955	421994	421951	421952	my guardian	9683	“ whatever the worth of this paper may be to any one , my obligations are great to you ; and if it be of any worth , I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated accordingly . ”
421995	422004	422006	422007	Mr. Bucket	734	“ Not according to your merits you know , ”
422016	422030	421951	421952	my guardian	9683	“ Do n't you be afraid of that . According to its value . ”
422031	422038	422040	422041	my guardian	9683	“ That is what I mean , ”
422043	422120	422040	422041	my guardian	9683	“ You may observe , Mr. Bucket , that I abstain from examining this paper myself . The plain truth is , I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many years , and my soul is sick of it . But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause , and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested . “
422133	422143	422040	422041	my guardian	9683	” observed Mr. Bucket , to his fellow visitor . “
422183	422318	422319	422319	I	0	” He unbolted the door , called in the bearers , wished us good morning , and with a look full of meaning , and a crook of his finger at parting , went his way . We went our way too , which was to Lincoln 's Inn , as quickly as possible . Mr. Kenge was disengaged ; and we found him at his table in his dusty room , with the inexpressive - looking books , and the piles of papers . Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy , Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office . He turned over his double eye - glass as he spoke , and was more Conversation Kenge than ever . “
422322	422327	422319	422319	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge , “
422336	422342	422333	422334	Miss Summerson	305	” he bowed to me , “

422541	422590	422516	422516	you	308	” said Mr. Kenge . At first he had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper but when he saw it he appeared more interested , and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye - glass , he became amazed . “
422594	422602	422516	422516	you	308	” he said , looking off it , “
422608	422609	422611	422611	I	0	” “

422763	422811	422813	422814	Mr. Kenge	308	“ You ask me what is this to you , Mr. Jarndyce . If you had perused this document , you would have seen that it reduces your interest considerably , though still leaving it a very handsome one , still leaving it a very handsome one , ”
422823	422856	422817	422817	his	308	“ You would further have seen , that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone , and of Miss Ada Clare , now Mrs. Richard Carstone , are very materially advanced by it . ”
422857	422860	422862	422863	my guardian	9683	“ Kenge , ”
422865	422913	422862	422863	my guardian	9683	“ if all the flourishing wealth that the suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins , I should be well contented . But do you ask me to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ”
422914	422960	422961	422962	My guardian	9683	“ O really , Mr. Jarndyce ! Prejudice , prejudice . My dear sir , this is a very great country , a very great country . Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system . Really , really ! ”
422983	423012	422972	422972	He	680	“ How do you do , Mr. Vholes ? Will you be so good as to take a chair here by me , and look over this paper ? ”
423140	423145	423114	423114	he	308	“ Receiver - General , ”
423146	423151	423114	423114	he	308	“ Accountant - General , ”

423183	423197	423199	423200	Mr. Kenge	308	“ Well ! But this is a very remarkable document , Mr. Vholes ? ”
423206	423211	423202	423203	Mr. Vholes	680	“ Very much so . ”
423212	423222	423224	423225	Mr. Kenge	308	“ And a very important document , Mr. Vholes ? ”
423232	423237	423228	423229	Mr. Vholes	680	“ Very much so . ”
423238	423269	423271	423272	Mr. Kenge	308	“ And as you say , Mr. Vholes , when the Cause is in the paper next Term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , ”
423308	423312	423314	423315	my guardian	9683	“ And when , ”
423339	423345	423332	423333	Mr. Vholes	680	“ when is next Term ? ”
423346	423358	423360	423361	Mr. Kenge	308	“ Next Term , Mr. Jarndyce , will be next month , ”
423363	423406	423360	423361	Mr. Kenge	308	“ Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document , and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it ; and of course you will receive our usual notification of the Cause being in the paper . ”
423407	423421	423332	423333	Mr. Vholes	680	“ To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . ”

423445	423519	423520	423520	He	308	“ still bent , even with your enlarged mind , on echoing a popular prejudice ? We are a prosperous community , Mr. Jarndyce , a very prosperous community . We are a great country , Mr. Jarndyce , we are a very great country . This is a great system , Mr. Jarndyce , and would you wish a great country to have a little system ? Now , really , really ! ”
423788	423793	423795	423796	the workman	8684	“ Why , master , ”
423798	423806	423795	423796	the workman	8684	“ do I know my own name ? ”
423807	423820	423822	423823	the trooper	11982	“ ' Tis so well known here , is it , comrade ? ”
423825	423834	423822	423823	the trooper	11982	“ Rouncewells ? Ah ! you 're right . ”
423835	423843	423845	423846	the trooper	11982	“ And where might it be now ? ”
423854	423865	423866	423867	the workman	8684	“ The bank , the factory , or the house ? ”
423872	423881	423883	423884	the trooper	11982	“ Hum ! Rouncewells is so great apparently , ”
423890	423928	423883	423884	the trooper	11982	“ that I have as good as half a mind to go back again . Why , I do n't know which I want . Should I find Mr. Rouncewell at the factory , do you think ? ”
423929	423970	423887	423887	his	11982	“ ' Tain't easy to say where you 'd find him — at this time of the day you might find either him or his son there , if he 's in town ; but his contracts take him away . ”
424290	424305	424307	424308	the trooper	11982	“ This is a place to make a man 's head ache , too ! ”
424319	424353	424307	424308	the trooper	11982	“ Who comes here ? This is very like me before I was set up . This ought to be my nephew , if likenesses run in families . Your servant , sir . ”
424354	424366	424307	424308	the trooper	11982	“ Yours , sir . Are you looking for any one ? ”
424367	424378	424307	424308	the trooper	11982	“ Excuse me . Young Mr. Rouncewell , I believe ? ”
424379	424382	424307	424308	the trooper	11982	“ Yes . ”
424383	424402	424403	424405	The young man	1928	“ I was looking for your father , sir . I wished to have a word with him . ”
424438	424452	424454	424455	the trooper	11982	“ Very like me before I was set up — devilish like me ! ”
424493	424503	424505	424507	the young man	1928	“ What name shall I say to my father ? ”
424521	424524	424505	424507	the young man	1928	“ Steel , ”
424654	424664	424666	424667	the gentleman	1163	“ I am at your service , Mr. Steel , ”
424678	424684	424685	424685	George	562	“ Well , Mr. Rouncewell , ”
424716	424803	424812	424813	the ironmaster	4726	“ I am not without my expectations , that in the present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome . I have served as a Dragoon in my day ; and a comrade of mine that I was once rather partial to , was , if I do n't deceive myself , a brother of yours . I believe you had a brother who gave his family some trouble , and ran away , and never did any good but in keeping away ? ”
424804	424810	424812	424813	the ironmaster	4726	“ Are you quite sure , ”
424820	424827	424812	424813	the ironmaster	4726	“ that your name is Steel ? ”
424855	424863	424865	424866	the trooper	11982	“ You are too quick for me ! ”
424877	424922	424865	424866	the trooper	11982	“ How do you do , my dear old fellow . I never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me as all this . How do you do , my dear old fellow , how do you do ! ”
424942	424953	424955	424955	his	11982	“ How do you do , my dear old fellow ! ”
424976	424982	424983	424983	he	11982	“ So far from it , ”
425001	425064	424983	424983	he	11982	“ I had very little idea of making myself known . I thought , if you took by any means forgivingly to my name , I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter . But I should not have been surprised , brother , if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me . ”
425065	425082	425084	425085	his brother	8721	“ We will show you at home what kind of news we think it , George , ”
425087	425189	425084	425085	his brother	8721	“ This is a great day at home , and you could not have arrived , you bronzed old soldier , on a better . I make an agreement with my son Watt to - day , that on this day twelvemonth he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels . She goes to Germany to - morrow , with one of your nieces , for a little polishing up in her education . We make a feast of the event , and you will be made the hero of it . ”
425535	425592	425594	425595	the trooper	11982	“ Brother , I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly welcome , and a million times more to that for your more than brotherly intentions . But my plans are made . Before I say a word as to them , I wish to consult you upon one family point . How , ”
425610	425622	425594	425595	the trooper	11982	“ how is my mother to be got to scratch me ? ”
425623	425635	425637	425638	the ironmaster	4726	“ I am not sure that I understand you , George , ”
425640	425667	425637	425638	the ironmaster	4726	“ I say , brother , how is my mother to be got to scratch me ? She must be got to do it , somehow . ”
425668	425681	425594	425595	the trooper	11982	“ Scratch you out of her will , I think you mean ? ”
425682	425691	425693	425694	the trooper	11982	“ Of course I do . In short , ”
425703	425712	425693	425694	the trooper	11982	“ I mean — to — scratch me ? ”
425713	425718	425720	425721	his brother	8721	“ My dear George , ”
425723	425735	425720	425721	his brother	8721	“ is it so indispensable that you should undergo that process ? ”
425736	425836	425594	425595	the trooper	11982	“ Quite ! Absolutely ! I could n't be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it . I should never be safe not to be off again . I have not sneaked home to rob your children , if not yourself , brother , of your rights . I , who forfeited mine long ago ! If I am to remain , and hold up my head , I must be scratched . Come . You are a man of celebrated penetration and intelligence , and you can tell me how it 's to be brought about . ”
425837	425845	425847	425848	the ironmaster	4726	“ I can tell you , George , ”
425852	425970	425847	425848	the ironmaster	4726	“ how it is not to be brought about , which I hope may answer the purpose as well . Look at our mother , think of her , recal her emotion when she recovered you . Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favorite son ? Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! ) to propose it ? If you do , you are wrong . No , George ! You must make up your mind to remain unscratched . I think , ”
425995	426013	425983	425983	he	4726	“ I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done , though . ”
426014	426019	425847	425848	the ironmaster	4726	“ How , brother ? ”
426048	426049	426077	426077	you	8721	” “
426054	426075	426077	426077	you	8721	” says the trooper , pondering again . Then he wistfully asks , with his hand on his brother 's , “
426090	426091	426077	426077	you	8721	” “
426096	426097	426077	426077	you	8721	” “
426133	426144	426146	426146	you	8721	” The ironmaster , repressing his amused smile , assents . “
426159	426184	426186	426186	I	0	” says the trooper , with a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms , and puts a hand on each leg ; “
426197	426236	426186	426186	I	0	” The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity , and absence of usage in the ways of the world , is all on the trooper 's side . “
426239	426248	426186	426186	I	0	” he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , “
426310	426320	426303	426303	I	0	” shaking him a long time by the hand . “
426353	426354	426355	426355	My	0	” “
426359	426376	426355	426355	My	0	” returns the elder , concentrating his strong steady brow upon him , and smiling confidently ; “
426387	426393	426384	426384	me	0	” George shakes his head . “
426478	426479	426484	426484	George	562	” “
426486	426501	426484	426484	George	562	” returns the other , with a very slight shade upon his open face , “
426515	426516	426503	426503	you	562	” “
426523	426539	426521	426521	brother	15558	” cries the trooper , checking him , with his hand upon his knee again : “
426753	426754	426755	426755	You	8785	” “
426761	426774	426757	426757	yourself	8785	” says the elder brother , returning the grip of his hand , “
426805	426806	426802	426802	your	8785	” “
426812	426817	426802	426802	your	8785	” returns the trooper . “
426909	426938	426939	426941	MISS ESTHER SUMMERSON	305	” Herewith he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : “
426943	427019	426939	426941	MISS ESTHER SUMMERSON	305	“ A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then unmarried in England . I duly observed the same . “
427075	427196	427197	427197	I	0	“ I further take the liberty to mention , that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat , and shared my last farthing with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been . But he was ( officially ) reported drowned , and assuredly went over the side of a transport - ship at night in an Irish harbor , within a few hours of her arrival from the West Indies , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been ( officially ) confirmed . “
427255	427263	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	“ I have the honor to be , “
427266	427267	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	” “
427272	427285	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	” observes the elder brother , refolding it with a puzzled face . “
427299	427304	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	” asks the younger . “
427309	427534	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	” Therefore it is sealed , and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day . This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party , and prepares to saddle and mount . His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will bait for the night , and there remain with him until morning : a servant riding , for so much of the journey , on the thorough - bred old grey from Chesney Wold . The offer being gladly accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast all in brotherly communion . Then they once more shake hands long and heartily , and part ; the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country . Early in the afternoon , the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue , as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm trees . SOON after I had had that conversation with my guardian , he put a sealed paper in my hand one morning , and said , “
427544	427665	427264	427264	GEORGE	562	” I found in it two hundred pounds . I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary . Regulating my purchases by my guardian 's taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my wardrobe to please him , and hoped I should be highly successful . I did it all so quietly , because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry , and because my guardian was so quiet himself . I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner . Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , “
427682	428462	427667	427667	you	8797	” Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over . I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best . The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt . I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian , and that we had been engaged some time . She highly approved . She could never do enough for me ; and was remarkably softened now , in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her . There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me ; but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little , as gratified her kindness without tasking it . Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian ; and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling . So I had plenty of occupation — which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework . To surround herself with great heaps of it — baskets full and tables full — and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley 's great dignities and delights . Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the Will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations . In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time ; but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now , and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties . From something my guardian said one day , when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the Term - time we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous . The Term was very near indeed , when my guardian was called out of town , and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt 's business . He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary . I had just come in one night from my dear girl 's , and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me , and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me . It asked me to join him in the country ; and mentioned by what stage - coach my place was taken , and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town . It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada . I expected few things less than a journey at that time , but I was ready for it in half - an - hour , and set off as appointed early next morning . I travelled all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose ; but I was never , never , never near the truth . It was night when I came to my journey 's end , and found my guardian waiting for me . This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear ( the more so as his letter was a very short one ) that he might be ill . However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself he has been doing some other great kindness . Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness . Supper was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said : “
428482	428483	428476	428476	I	0	” “
428488	428492	428476	428476	I	0	” said I , “
428513	428514	428505	428505	I	0	” “
428526	428532	428505	428505	I	0	” he returned , gaily , “
428723	428728	428720	428720	she	8810	” said my guardian , “
428735	428767	428720	428720	she	8810	” Because he was so dear , so good , so admirable . I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not articulate a word . “
428772	428777	428720	428720	she	8810	” said my guardian . “
428799	428800	428796	428796	you	8811	” “
428816	428817	428796	428796	you	8811	” “
428822	428826	428831	428831	you	8811	” said he . “
428854	428864	428865	428865	I	0	” I kissed him , and dried my eyes . “
428869	428872	428865	428865	I	0	” said I. “
428884	428885	428873	428873	I	0	” “
428895	428899	428889	428889	you	8811	” said he . “
428911	429066	428902	428903	Dame Durden	388	” He was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all . When I went to bed , I cried . I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure . I repeated every word of the letter twice over . A most beautiful summer morning succeeded ; and after breakfast we went out arm in arm , to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion . We entered a flower - garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key ; and the first thing I saw , was , that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home . “
429073	429091	428902	428903	Dame Durden	388	” observed my guardian , standing still , with a delighted face , to watch my looks ; “
429104	429466	429100	429100	I	0	” We went on by a pretty little orchard , where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves , and the shadows of the apple - trees were sporting on the grass , to the house itself,—a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll 's rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all overhung with summer - growth , there turning a humming mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town , where cricket - players were assembling in bright groups , and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind . And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic verandah doors , and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades , garlanded with woodbine , jasmine , and honeysuckle , I saw , in the papering on the walls , in the colors of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , my little tastes and fancies , my little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere . I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind , when I saw this . I thought , O would he be the happier for it ! Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ? Because , although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him mournfully of what he believed he had lost . I did not wish him to forget me,—perhaps he might not have done so , without these aids to his memory,—but my way was easier than his , and I could have reconciled myself even to that , so that he had been the happier for it . “
429473	429501	429470	429471	little woman	2052	” said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things , and watching my appreciation of them , “
429515	429516	429470	429471	little woman	2052	” “
429525	429526	429527	429528	My child	9062	” “
429530	429534	429527	429528	My child	9062	” said he , “
429539	429562	429527	429528	My child	9062	” He took me to the porch , which he had hitherto avoided , and said , pausing before we went out : “
429574	429575	429569	429569	you	2813	” “
429578	429629	429569	429569	you	2813	” said I. We went out of the porch ; and he showed me written over it , BLEAK HOUSE . He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me , and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus : “
429668	429676	429677	429677	I	0	” smiling as he referred to it , “
429756	429818	429750	429750	I	0	” I was cold , and I trembled violently ; but not a word he uttered was lost . As I sat looking fixedly at him , and the sun 's rays descended , softly shining through the leaves , upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the Angels . “
429874	429893	429861	429861	Woodcourt	497	” I clasped him round the neck , and hung my head upon his breast , and wept . “
429904	429914	429861	429861	Woodcourt	497	” said he , pressing me gently to him . “
429928	429960	429962	429962	me	0	” Soothingly , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and genially , like the ripening weather ; and radiantly and beneficently , like the sunshine ; he went on . “
430123	430156	430159	430160	little woman	2052	” He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh . For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise . “
430182	430188	430175	430175	I	0	” he said , exultingly , “
430414	430422	430423	430423	I	0	” cried my guardian , with enthusiasm , “
430450	430490	430506	430506	he	497	” He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again . What a light , now , on the protecting manner I had thought about ! “
430616	430653	430654	430654	Allan	497	” He rose , and raised me with him . We were no longer alone . My husband — I have called him by that name full seven happy years now — stood at my side . “
430656	430661	430654	430654	Allan	497	” said my guardian , “
430741	430763	430764	430764	Esther	305	” He kissed me once again ; and now the tears were in his eyes , as he said more softly : “
430825	430852	430819	430819	Allan	497	” He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside , and turning cheerfully towards us , said : “
430909	431122	431124	431124	he	8861	” What happiness was our 's that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss ! We were to be married before the month was out ; but when we were to come and take possession of our own house , was to depend on Richard and Ada . We all three went home together next day . As soon as we arrived in town Allan went straight to see Richard , and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling . Late as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep : but I went home with my guardian first , to make his tea for him , and to occupy the old chair by his side ; for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon . When we came home , we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day , to see me ; and that , having been told , on the occasion of his third call , that I was not expected to return before ten o'clock at night , he had left word , “
431130	431188	431124	431124	he	8861	” He had left his card three times . MR . GUPPY . As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal , and his subsequent retractation . “
431192	431197	431124	431124	he	8861	” said my guardian , “
431205	431253	431124	431124	he	8861	” So , instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in , when he came again ; and they were scarcely given when he did come again . He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself , and said , “
431260	431261	431124	431124	he	8861	” “
431269	431274	431124	431124	he	8861	” returned my guardian . “
431284	431289	431276	431276	you	9019	” returned Mr. Guppy . “
431339	431354	431355	431355	Tony	552	” My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down . “
431357	431370	431355	431355	Tony	552	” said Mr. Guppy to his friend , after an awkward silence . “
431377	431378	431372	431372	you	552	” “
431383	431391	431381	431381	yourself	552	” returned the friend , rather tartly . “
431399	431440	431397	431397	sir	9019	” Mr. Guppy , after a moment 's consideration , began ; to the great diversion of his mother , which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow , and winking at me in a most remarkable manner ; “
431484	431485	431486	431487	Miss Summerson	305	” “
431489	431495	431486	431487	Miss Summerson	305	” returned my guardian smiling , “
431506	431507	431486	431487	Miss Summerson	305	” “
431510	431515	431486	431487	Miss Summerson	305	” said Mr. Guppy , “
431600	431601	431603	431603	you	9019	” “
431608	431613	431605	431606	Mr. Guppy	326	” returned my guardian . “
431632	431650	431651	431651	I	0	” Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket , and proceeded without it . “
431672	431705	431658	431659	my mother	2309	” here Mr. Guppy 's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again winked at me ; “
431736	431743	431733	431733	you	9019	” said Mr. Guppy , feelingly . “
431748	431753	431733	431733	you	9019	” returned my guardian . “
431759	431764	431754	431754	I	0	” pursued Mr. Guppy , “
431825	431852	431882	431882	I	0	” Here Mr. Guppy 's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head , and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her . “
431863	431868	431874	431875	my friends	1617	” said Mr. Guppy , “
431902	431913	431893	431893	Jobling	542	” Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air , “
431919	431933	431934	431935	My friend	1760	” Mr. Jobling confirmed this , with a sliding movement of his legs . “
431955	431960	431936	431936	Jobling	542	” said Mr. Guppy . “
432027	432031	431997	431997	Jobling	542	” Mr. Jobling said “
432034	432048	431997	431997	Jobling	542	” and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr. Guppy 's mother . “
432071	432075	432077	432077	mother	11023	” said Mr. Guppy “
432114	432115	432106	432106	I	0	” “
432121	432126	432117	432117	I	0	” returned my guardian . “
432129	432134	432117	432117	I	0	” pursued Mr. Guppy , “
432176	432190	432169	432169	I	0	” My guardian patted me on the shoulder , and seemed much amused . “
432195	432200	432193	432193	sir	9019	” said Mr. Guppy , “
432337	432338	432331	432332	Miss Summerson	305	” “
432346	432351	432344	432344	sir	9019	” observed my guardian . “
432356	432364	432354	432354	sir	9019	” returned Mr. Guppy , with candor , “
432437	432438	432439	432439	I	0	” “
432446	432458	432439	432439	I	0	” said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , “
432490	432491	432470	432470	She	305	” “
432494	432504	432470	432470	She	305	” said Mr. Guppy , with a blank look . “
432520	432521	432470	432470	She	305	” “
432530	432563	432527	432527	you	9019	” returned my guardian . Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend , and at his mother who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling . “
432566	432570	432573	432573	Jobling	542	” said he . “
432609	432629	432587	432587	you	9019	” But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway . She would n't hear of it . “
432637	432644	432647	432647	you	9019	” said she to my guardian , “
432672	432673	432670	432670	you	9019	” “
432678	432683	432670	432670	you	9019	” returned my guardian , “
432699	432700	432701	432701	I	0	” “
432708	432713	432701	432701	I	0	” said Mrs. Guppy . “
432743	432770	432741	432741	'em	8912	” I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy 's power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence . “
432783	432788	432775	432775	somebody	1404	” repeated Mrs. Guppy . “
432792	432818	432775	432775	somebody	1404	” Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy 's mother so much , and to make her so very indignant , as our not getting out . “
432826	432831	432822	432822	you	9019	” said Mrs. Guppy . “
432839	432840	432834	432834	you	9019	” “
432843	432868	432841	432841	Mother	11023	” interposed her son , always getting before her , and pushing her back with one shoulder , as she sidled at my guardian , “
432875	432876	432870	432870	you	9019	” “
432881	432885	432879	432879	William	326	” she returned ; “
432900	433188	432896	432896	I	0	” However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy 's mother ( who began to be quite abusive ) , and took her , very much against her will , down - stairs ; her voice rising a stair higher every time her figure got a stair lower , and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out . THE Term had commenced , and my guardian found an intimation from Mr. Kenge that the Cause would come on in two days . As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the Court that morning . Richard was extremely agitated , and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported . But she looked forward — a very little way now — to the help that was to come to her , and never drooped . It was at Westminster that the Cause was to come on . It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not divest myself of an idea that it might lead to some result now . We left home directly after breakfast , to be at Westminster Hall in good time ; and walked down there through the lively streets — so happily and strangely it seemed!—together . As we were going along , planning what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling “
433197	433538	433195	433195	Esther	305	” And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils ( she had so many ) , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ' distance . I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her . Of course we turned back ; and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so overjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to squeeze my face ( bonnet and all ) between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I do n't know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down , by letting her say and do exactly what she liked . Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off , laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the coach - window as long as she could see us . This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day 's business was begun . Worse than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within . It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh , and a cry of “
433541	433945	433195	433195	Esther	305	” It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer . It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young counsellors in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite doubled themselves up with laughter , and went stamping about the pavement of the hall . We asked a gentleman by us , if he knew what cause was on ? He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce . We asked him if he knew what was doing in it ? He said , really no he did not , nobody ever did ; but as well as he could make out , it was over . Over for the day ? we asked him . No , he said ; over for good . Over for good ! When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement . Could it be possible that the Will had set things right at last , and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ? It seemed too good to be true . Alas it was ! Our suspense was short ; for a break up soon took place in the crowd , and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot , and bringing a quantity of bad air with them . Still they were all exceedingly amused , and were more like people coming out from a Farce or a Juggler than from a court of Justice . We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew ; and presently great bundles of papers began to be carried out — bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers staggered under , and threw down for the time being , anyhow , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more . Even these clerks were laughing . We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an official - looking person who was standing in the midst of them , whether the cause was over . “
433948	433952	433195	433195	Esther	305	” he said ; “
433962	434012	433195	433195	Esther	305	” and burst out laughing too . At this juncture , we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential , and carried his own bag . Mr. Vholes was the first to see us . “
434020	434024	434015	434016	Miss Summerson	305	” he said . “
434029	434030	434026	434027	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” “
434038	434052	434055	434055	you	9019	” said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with polished politeness . “
434069	434081	434063	434064	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” No . He never came there , I reminded him . “
434084	434089	434063	434064	Mr. Jarndyce	313	” returned Mr. Kenge , “
434137	434138	434107	434107	I	0	” “
434148	434152	434153	434153	I	0	” asked Allan . “
434158	434167	434153	434153	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge , with excessive urbanity . “
434176	434177	434153	434153	I	0	” “
434183	434188	434153	434153	I	0	” repeated Mr. Kenge . “
434227	434228	434222	434222	I	0	” “
434239	434243	434245	434245	you	9019	” said Allan ; “
434250	434251	434245	434245	you	9019	” “
434259	434264	434245	434245	you	9019	” said Mr. Kenge ; “
434280	434281	434273	434273	we	8919	” “
434289	434304	434282	434282	We	8919	” repeated Mr. Vholes , as if his low inward voice were an echo . “
434313	434327	434305	434305	You	9019	” observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver trowel , persuasively and smoothingly , “
434368	434369	434354	434354	Jarndyce	313	” “
434380	434384	434354	434354	Jarndyce	313	” said Allan . “
434391	434404	434389	434389	sir	9019	” returned Mr. Kenge , with a certain condescending laugh he had . “
434417	434423	434414	434415	Mr. Woodcourt	497	” becoming dignified to severity , “
434543	434544	434545	434546	Mr. Kenge	308	” “
434548	434559	434545	434546	Mr. Kenge	308	” said Allan , appearing enlightened all in a moment . “
434583	434584	434568	434568	I	0	” “
434591	434596	434587	434587	I	0	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
434605	434606	434602	434602	you	680	” “
434611	434616	434602	434602	you	680	” said Mr. Vholes . “
434627	434628	434602	434602	you	680	” “
434631	434636	434602	434602	you	680	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
434640	434641	434602	434602	you	680	” “
434644	434649	434602	434602	you	680	” said Mr. Vholes . “
434654	434658	434602	434602	you	680	” whispered Allan , “
434666	434722	434602	434602	you	680	” There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his gradual decay , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fulness of her foreboding love , sounded like a knell in my ears . “
434734	434743	434602	434602	you	680	” said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , “
434771	434851	434768	434769	Miss Summerson	305	” As he gave me that slowly devouring look of his , while twisting up the strings of his bag , before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of this client , and his black buttoned - up unwholesome figure glided away to the low door at the end of the hall . “
434856	434860	434768	434769	Miss Summerson	305	” said Allan , “
434893	434946	434947	434948	Little woman	2052	” I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment 's delay , and leave me to do as he wished . Hurrying home , I found my guardian , and told him gradually with what news I had returned . “
434950	434959	434768	434769	Miss Summerson	305	” said he , quite unmoved for himself , “
434986	435271	435272	435273	Dame Durden	388	” We talked about them all the morning , and discussed what it was possible to do . In the afternoon , my guardian walked with me to Symond 's Inn , and left me at the door . I went up - stairs . When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck ; but she composed herself directly , and said that Richard had asked for me several times . Allan had found him sitting in a corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure . On being roused , he had broken away , and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge . He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home . He was lying on the sofa with his eyes closed , when I went in . There were restoratives on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet . Allan stood behind him , watching him gravely . His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of color , and , now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was . But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day . I sat down by his side in silence . Opening his eyes by - and - by , he said , in a weak voice but with his old smile , “
435281	435426	435272	435273	Dame Durden	388	” It was a great comfort and surprise to me , to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward . He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage , than he could find words to tell me . My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both , and wished us all the joy that life could yield us . I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken , when I saw him take my husband 's hand and hold it to his breast . We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet . Ada would contrive to take him , somehow , he said . “
435434	435545	435272	435273	Dame Durden	388	” But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near,—I knew — I knew ! It was not good for him to talk too much ; and when he was silent , we were silent too . Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy . Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm . He dozed often ; and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said , first of all , “
435550	435573	435272	435273	Dame Durden	388	” Evening had come on , when I lifted up my eyes , and saw my guardian standing in the little hall . “
435581	435616	435578	435579	Dame Durden	388	” Richard asked me . The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there . I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded “
435619	435649	435578	435579	Dame Durden	388	” bent over Richard and told him . My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard 's . “
435653	435657	435650	435651	O sir	8936	” said Richard , “
435670	435703	435664	435664	you	8936	” and burst into tears for the first time . My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard 's . “
435708	435712	435706	435706	Rick	350	” said he , “
435753	435754	435755	435755	I	0	” “
435777	435778	435770	435770	I	0	” “
435786	435791	435770	435770	I	0	” cried my guardian . “
435803	435811	435792	435792	I	0	” said Richard with a sad smile . “
435841	435842	435836	435836	I	0	” “
435847	435855	435836	435836	I	0	” said my guardian , comforting him ; “
435865	435866	435867	435867	I	0	” “
435873	435877	435867	435867	I	0	” resumed Richard , “
435931	435932	435937	435937	I	0	” “
435945	435950	435943	435943	Rick	350	” said my guardian , “
435984	436007	436008	436008	I	0	” Richard smiled ; and lifted up his arm to touch him , as he stood behind the head of his couch . “
436014	436018	436008	436008	I	0	” said Richard , “
436067	436103	436059	436061	my dear love	8931	” He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke . He gradually released her ; and she looked upon us , and looked up to Heaven , and moved her lips . “
436112	436116	436105	436105	I	0	” said Richard , “
436144	436145	436136	436136	You	0	” “
436151	436152	436149	436149	Rick	350	” “
436162	436166	436157	436157	you	0	” said Richard . “
436208	436209	436217	436217	I	0	” “
436253	436297	436250	436251	my love	9128	” he repeated to Ada , as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair , and put a lock of it to his lips . ( I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone . ) “
436305	436317	436250	436251	my love	9128	” said Richard , clasping both my guardian 's hands eagerly . “
436326	436327	436250	436251	my love	9128	” “
436358	436359	436329	436329	you	0	” “
436373	436374	436371	436371	Rick	350	” “
436381	436415	436371	436371	Rick	350	” said Richard , with a light in his eyes . My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian . “
436475	436479	436462	436462	I	0	” said Richard . “
436485	436486	436462	436462	I	0	” “
436496	436501	436502	436502	Ada	319	” returned my guardian . “
436507	436535	436502	436502	Ada	319	” He sought to raise himself a little . Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom : which was what he wanted . “
436592	437644	436576	436576	You	350	” A smile irradiated his face , as she bent to kiss him . He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world . Not this world , O not this ! The world that sets this right . When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping to me , and told me that she had given her birds their liberty . THERE is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history . The story goes , that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out , to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , feebly whispering and creeping about , and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away . It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park , where the trees arch darkly overhead , and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home , to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery . Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans — like charmers reduced to flirting with grim Death , after losing all their other beaux — did once occasionally say , when the World assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , entombed in the mausoleum , never rose against the profanation of her company . But the dead - and - gone Dedlocks take it very calmly , and have never been known to object . Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle - road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ' hoofs . Then may be seen Sir Leicester — invalided , bent , and almost blind , but of a worthy presence yet — riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his bridle - rein . When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum door , Sir Leicester 's accustomed horse stops of his own accord , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away . War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now hotly , and now coolly ; flickering like an unsteady fire . The truth is said to be , that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way , and do whatever Sir Leicester would : which Sir Leicester , conceiving to be a concession to his illness or misfortune , took in such high dudgeon , and was so magnificently aggrieved by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself . Similarly Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare , and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church , by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence . But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe , he is really most considerate ; and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being implacable , little supposes how much he is humoured . As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered , in the fortunes of two sisters ; and his antagonist , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him . So the quarrel goes on , to the satisfaction of both . In one of the lodges of the Park ; that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the Keeper 's child ; the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is housed . Some relies of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable - yard to keep gleaming bright . A busy little man he always is , in the polishing at harness - house doors , of stirrup - irons , bits , curb - chains , harness - bosses , anything in the way of a stable - yard that will take a polish : leading a life of friction . A shaggy little damaged man , withal , not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed , who has been considerably knocked about . He answers to the name of Phil . A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper ( harder of hearing now ) going to church on the arm of her son , and to observe — which few do , for the house is scant of company in these times — the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them . They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling , in sequestered sawpits and such nooks of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air , from the trooper 's door . Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge , on the inspiring topic of the British Grenadiers ; and , as the evening closes in , a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , “
437661	438001	437652	437654	the old girl	12856	” The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a show - house no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing - room for all that , and reposes in his old place before my Lady 's picture . Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing - room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more . A little more , in truth , and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight , and looks so obdurate , will have opened and relieved him . Volumnia , growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face and yellower as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings , and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns : of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips . Long - winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle ( it must be one of the two , and can not be anything else ) , are the staple of her reading . Sir Leicester is not particular what it is , and does not appear to follow it very closely ; further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and , sonorously repeating her last word , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued ? However , Volumnia , in the course of her bird - like hopping about and pecking at papers , has lighted on a memorandum concerning herself , in the event of “
438004	438990	437652	437654	the old girl	12856	” to her kinsman , which is handsome compensation for an extensive course of reading , and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay . The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dulness , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the plantations , and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment , for low spirited twos and threes of cousins . The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa - pillows in his gunless hours , and protesting that such fernal old jail's — nough t'sew fler up — frever . The only great occasions for Volumnia , in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire , are those occasions , rare and widely - separated , when something is to be done for the county , or the country , in the way of gracing a public ball . Then , indeed , does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form , and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly - room , fourteen heavy miles off ; which , during three hundred and sixty - four days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of Antipodean lumber - room , full of old chairs and tables , upside down . Then , indeed , does she captivate all hearts by her condescension , by her girlish vivacity , and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth , had not cut one of them at two guineas each . Then does she twirl and twine , a pastoral nymph of good family , through the mazes of the dance . Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage . Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful . Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age , embellishing that assembly - room ; which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem Volumnias . For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees , sighing , wringing their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the window - panes in monotonous depression . A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses , than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound , and go resounding through the building . A waste of unused passages and staircases , in which to drop a comb upon a bed - room floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house . A place where few people care to go about alone ; where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs . Thus Chesney Wold . With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so sombre and motionless always — no flag flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it;—passion and pride , even to the stranger 's eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire , and yielded it to dull repose . FULL seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House . The few words that I have to add to what I have written , are soon penned ; then I , and the unknown friend to whom I write , will part for ever . Not without much dear remembrance on my side . Not without some , I hope , on his or hers . They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her . The little child who was to have done so much , was born before the turf was planted on its father 's grave . It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian , gave him his father 's name . The help that my dear counted on , did come to her ; though it came , in the Eternal wisdom , for another purpose . Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it . When I saw the strength of the weak little hand , and how its touch could heal my darling 's heart , and raise up hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God . They throve ; and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden , and walk there with her infant in her arms . I was married then . I was the happiest of the happy . It was at this time that my guardian joined us , and asked Ada when she would come home ? “
439000	439004	438997	438998	my dear	9060	” said he , “
439033	439037	439042	439042	John	277	” Ada called him “
439044	440397	439042	439042	John	277	” But he said , No , it must be guardian now . He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy 's ; and he had an old association with the name . So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since . The children know him by no other name.—I say the children ; I have two little daughters . It is difficult to believe that Charley ( round - eyed still , and not at all grammatical ) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write , early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round . I hope the miller will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a match — for he is well to do , and was in great request . So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose Time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago ; since little Emma , Charley 's sister , is exactly what Charley used to be . As to Tom , Charley 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in cyphering , but I think it was Decimals . He is apprenticed to the miller , whatever it was ; and is a good bashful fellow , always falling in love with somebody , and being ashamed of it . Caddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us , and was a dearer creature than ever ; perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the children , as if she had never given a dancing - lesson in her life . Caddy keeps her own little carriage now , instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street . She works very hard , her husband ( an excellent one ) being lame , and able to do very little . Still , she is more than contented , and does all she has to do with all her heart . Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall , as he used to do in her old one . I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification , from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits ; but I hope she got over it in time . She has been disappointed in Borrioboola Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the King of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody — who survived the climate — for Rum ; but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one . I had almost forgotten Caddy 's poor little girl . She is not such a mite now ; but she is deaf and dumb . I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who learns , in her scanty intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts , to soften the affliction of her child . As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop . Peepy is in the Custom - house , and doing extremely well . Old Mr. Turveydrop , very apoplectic , still exhibits his Deportment about town ; still enjoys himself in the old manner ; is still believed in , in the old way . He is constant in his patronage of Peepy , and is understood to have bequeathed him a favorite French clock in his dressing - room — which is not his property . With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little Growlery expressly for my guardian ; which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see us . I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end ; but when I write of him , my tears will have their way . I never look at him , but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man . To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the fondest father ; to me , he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ! He is my husband 's best and dearest friend , he is our children 's darling , he is the object of our deepest love and veneration . Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him , and so easy with him , that I almost wonder at myself . I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side . Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little Woman!—all just the same as ever ; and I answer , Yes , dear guardian!—just the same . I have never known the wind to be in the East for a single moment , since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name . I remarked to him , once , that the wind seemed never in the East now : and he said , No , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day . I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever . The sorrow that has been in her face — for it is not there now — seems to have purified even its innocent expression , and to have given it a diviner quality . Sometimes , when I raise my eyes and see her , in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel — it is difficult to express — as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers . I call him my Richard ! But he says that he has two mamas , and I am one . We are not rich in the bank , but we have always prospered , and we have quite enough . I never walk out with my husband , but I hear the people bless him . I never go into a house of any degree , but I hear his praises , or see them in grateful eyes . I never lie down at night , but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain , and soothed some fellow - creature in the time of need . I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration . Is not this to be rich ? The people even praise Me as the doctor 's wife . The people even like Me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed . I owe it all to him , my love , my pride ! They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake . A night or two ago , after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to - morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home . So he said , “
440409	440414	440405	440405	you	8983	” And I said , “
440440	440441	440432	440432	I	0	” “
440452	440457	440444	440444	you	8983	” said Allan then . “
440463	440466	440444	440444	you	8983	” said I. “
440493	440494	440498	440498	you	8983	” “
440508	440512	440498	440498	you	8983	” said Allan . “
440540	440541	440513	440513	I	0	” “
440548	440554	440513	440513	I	0	” said Allan , laughing . “
440563	440564	440565	440565	My	0	” “
440570	440580	440565	440565	My	0	” said Allan , drawing my arm through his , “
440589	440590	440582	440582	you	388	” “
440602	440603	440598	440598	me	0	” “
