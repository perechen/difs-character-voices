0	28	47	48	Paul Bultitude	57	" In England , where boys go to boarding schools , if the holidays were not long there would be no opportunity for cultivating the domestic affections . "—Letter
1468	1470	1431	1431	He	253	" fellows "
1523	1527	1507	1507	he	253	" feeling beastly . "
1711	1730	1699	1699	she	266	" pleasant , good - hearted young gentleman , after all , though that aggravating and contrairy sometimes . "
1749	1772	1733	1733	she	266	" the best boy this next term as ever was , and work hard at all his lessons , and bring home a prize"—but
1824	1859	1798	1799	the cook	269	" Lor bless his heart , what with all these telegrafts and things , time flew so fast nowadays that they 'd be having him back again before they all knew where they were ! "
2242	2249	2250	2250	he	57	" There you are , eh ? "
2274	2352	2250	2250	he	57	" So you 're off at last ? Well , holidays ca n't last for ever — by a merciful decree of Providence , they do n't last quite for ever ! There , good - bye , good - bye , be a good boy this term , no more scrapes , mind . And now you 'd better run away , and put on your coat — you're keeping the cab waiting all this time . "
2353	2360	2362	2362	Dick	60	" No , I 'm not , "
2364	2374	2362	2362	Dick	60	" Boaler has n't gone to fetch one yet . "
2375	2384	2386	2386	Paul	57	" Not gone to fetch a cab yet ! "
2392	2467	2386	2386	Paul	57	" why , God bless my soul , what 's the man thinking about ? You 'll lose your train ! I know you 'll lose the train , and there will be another day lost , after the extra week gone already through that snow ! I must see to this myself . Ring the bell , tell Boaler to start this instant — I insist on his fetching a cab this instant ! "
2468	2480	2482	2482	Dick	60	" Well , it 's not my fault , you know , "
2493	2507	2482	2482	Dick	60	" but Boaler has gone now . I just heard the gate shut . "
2508	2511	2513	2514	his father	242	" Ah ! "
2520	2524	2525	2525	he	242	" and now , "
2528	2554	2525	2525	he	242	" you 'd better shake hands , and then go up and say good - bye to your sister — you've no time to spare . "
2555	2565	2567	2567	Dick	60	" I 've said good - bye to them , "
2569	2581	2567	2567	Dick	60	" May n't I stay here till — till Boaler comes ? "
2617	2627	2628	2628	he	57	" I suppose you can if you want to , "
2632	2665	2628	2628	he	57	" only do one thing or the other — stay outside , or shut the door and come in and sit down quietly . I can not sit in a thorough draught ! "
2805	2821	2822	2822	he	242	" There 's one thing I want to talk to you about before you go , "
2825	3112	2822	2822	he	242	" and that 's this . I had a most unsatisfactory report of you this last term ; do n't let me have that again . Dr. Grimstone tells me — ah , I have his letter here — yes , he says ( and just attend , instead of making yourself ill with preserved ginger)—he says , ' Your son has great natural capacity , and excellent abilities ; but I regret to say that , instead of applying himself as he might do , he misuses his advantages , and succeeds in setting a mischievous example to — if not actually misleading — his companions . ' That 's a pleasant account for a father to read ! Here am I , sending you to an expensive school , furnishing you with great natural capacity and excellent abilities , and — and — every other school requisite , and all you do is to misuse them ! It 's disgraceful ! And misleading your companions , too ! Why , at your age , they ought to mislead you — No , I do n't mean that — but what I may tell you is that I 've written a very strong letter to Dr. Grimstone , saying what pain it gave me to hear you misbehaved yourself , and telling him , if he ever caught you setting an example of any sort , mind that , any sort , in the future — he was to , ah , to remember some of Solomon 's very sensible remarks on the subject . So I should strongly advise you to take care what you 're about in future , for your own sake ! "
3405	3414	3373	3373	He	60	" only so many more weeks and days left "
3472	3475	3467	3467	his	60	" slow . "
3567	3570	3558	3558	Barbara	64	" The Pirates "
3694	3697	3698	3698	he	57	" Heigho ! "
3701	3712	3698	3698	he	57	" Boaler 's an uncommonly long time fetching that cab ! "
3738	3745	3747	3748	his parent	305	" I do wish , sir , "
3751	3834	3747	3748	his parent	305	" you would try to break yourself of that habit of breathing hard . The society of a grampus ( for it 's no less ) delights no one and offends many — including me — and for Heaven 's sake , Dick , do n't kick the leg of the table in that way ; you know it simply maddens me . What do you do it for ? Why ca n't you learn to sit at table like a gentleman ? "
3862	3890	3859	3859	his	60	" Oh , I say , father , will you — can you let me have some pocket - money , please , to go back with ? "
3906	3911	3912	3912	he	57	" Pocket - money ! "
3915	3946	3912	3912	he	57	" why , you ca n't want money . Did n't your grandmother give you a sovereign as a Christmas - box ? And I gave you ten shillings myself ! "
3947	3955	3957	3957	Dick	60	" I do want it , though , "
3959	3978	3957	3957	Dick	60	" that 's all spent . And you know you always have given me money to take back . "
3979	3995	4002	4002	he	57	" If I do give you some , you 'll only go and spend it , "
4010	4055	4002	4002	he	57	" I sha n't spend it all at once , and I shall want some to put in the plate on Sundays . We always have to put in the plate when it 's a collection . And there 's the cab to pay . "
4056	4071	4073	4074	his father	242	" Boaler has orders to pay your cab — as you know well enough , "
4076	4099	4073	4074	his father	242	" but I suppose you must have some , though you cost me enough , Heaven knows , without this additional expense . "
4322	4334	4335	4335	he	242	" An uncommonly liberal allowance for a young fellow like you , "
4338	4391	4335	4335	he	242	" Do n't buy any foolishness with it , and if , towards the end of the term you want a little more , and write an intelligible letter asking for it , and I think proper to let you have it — why , you 'll get it , you know . "
4453	4458	4459	4459	he	60	" I nearly forgot , "
4472	4495	4459	4459	he	60	" I did n't like to take it without asking you , but is this any use ? May I have it ? "
4496	4499	4501	4502	Mr. Bultitude	71	" Eh ? "
4506	4521	4501	4502	Mr. Bultitude	71	" what 's that ? Something else — what is it you want now ? "
4522	4555	4459	4459	he	60	" It 's only that stone Uncle Duke brought mamma from India ; the thing , he said , they called a ' Pagoda stone , ' or something , out there . "
4556	4607	4501	4502	Mr. Bultitude	71	" Pagoda stone ? The boy means Garudâ Stone . I should like to know how you got hold of that ; you 've been meddling in my drawers , now , a thing I will not put up with , as I 've told you over and over again . "
4608	4617	4619	4619	Dick	60	" No , I have n't , then , "
4621	4664	4619	4619	Dick	60	" I found it in a tray in the drawing - room , and Barbara said , perhaps , if I asked you , you might let me have it , as she did n't think it was any use to you . "
4665	4678	4501	4502	Mr. Bultitude	71	" Then Barbara had no right to say anything of the sort . "
4679	4693	4695	4695	Dick	60	" But may I have it ? I may , may n't I ? "
4697	4724	4695	4695	Dick	60	" Have it ? certainly not . What could you possibly want with a thing like that ? It 's ridiculous . Give it to me . "
4915	4922	4952	4952	he	57	" Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis . "
4960	4972	4952	4952	he	57	" What use would a thing like this be to you ? "
5087	5100	5082	5082	he	60	" Oh , I do n't know , I should like it . "
5101	5107	5109	5109	Paul	57	" Well , any way , "
5111	5143	5109	5109	Paul	57	" you certainly wo n't have it . It 's worth keeping , whatever it is , as the only thing your uncle Marmaduke was ever known to give to anybody . "
5179	5185	5186	5186	he	60	" insinuating manners and address , "
5379	5388	5390	5390	Dick	60	" Is n't it a talisman , though ? "
5412	5422	5424	5424	Paul	57	" I 'm sure I ca n't tell you , "
5426	5432	5424	5424	Paul	57	" how do you mean ? "
5433	5521	5528	5529	his father	242	" I do n't know , only Uncle Duke once said something about it . Barbara heard him tell mamma . I say , perhaps it 's like the one in Scott , and cures people of things , though I do n't think it 's that sort of talisman either , because I tried it once on my chilblains , and it was n't a bit of good . If you would only let me have it , perhaps I might find out , you know . "
5522	5526	5528	5529	his father	242	" You might , "
5540	5562	5564	5564	he	333	" but you wo n't have the chance . If it has a secret , I will find it out for myself "
5579	5594	5564	5564	he	333	" and , by the way , there 's your cab — at last . "
5652	5655	5656	5656	he	60	" Father , "
5659	5682	5656	5656	he	60	" there 's something I want to say to you so much before I go . Do let me ask you now . "
5683	5690	5692	5692	Paul	57	" Well , what is it ? "
5694	5704	5656	5656	he	60	" Make haste , you have n't much time . "
5705	5728	5729	5729	Paul	57	" It 's this . I want you to — to let me leave Grimstone 's at the end of the term . "
5738	5761	5762	5762	he	57	" Let you leave Dr. Grimstone 's ( oblige me by giving him his full title when you speak of him ) , "
5766	5873	5762	5762	he	57	" Why , what do you mean ? It 's an excellent school — never saw a better expressed prospectus in my life . And my old friend Bangle , Sir Benjamin Bangle , who 's a member of the School Board , and ought to know something about schools , strongly recommended it — would have sent his own son there , if he had n't entered him at Eton . And when I pay for most of the extras for you too . Dancing , by Gad , and meat for breakfast . I 'm sure I do n't know what you would have . "
5874	5889	5891	5891	Dick	60	" I 'd like to go to Marlborough , or Harrow , or somewhere , "
5893	6015	5762	5762	he	57	" Jolland 's going to Harrow at Easter . ( Jolland 's one of the fellows at Grimstone's — Dr. Grimstone 's I mean . ) And what does old Bangle know about it ? He has n't got to go there himself ! And — and Grimstone 's jolly enough to fellows he likes , but he does n't like me — he 's always sitting on me for something — and I hate some of the fellows there , and altogether it 's beastly . Do let me leave ! If you do n't want me to go to a public school , I — I could stop at home and have a private tutor — like Joe Twitterley ! "
6016	6027	6029	6029	Paul	57	" It 's all ridiculous nonsense , I tell you , "
6032	6115	6029	6029	Paul	57	" ridiculous nonsense ! And , once for all , I 'll put a stop to it . I do n't approve of public schools for boys like you , and , what 's more , I ca n't afford it . As for private tutors , that 's absurd ! So you will just make up your mind to stay at Crichton House as long as I think proper to keep you there , and there 's an end of that ! "
6286	6301	6302	6302	he	57	" Now , you know , it 's no use to cry like that , "
6305	6480	6302	6302	he	57	" It's — ah — the usual thing for boys at school , I 'm quite aware , to go about fancying they 're very ill - used , and miserable , and all the rest of it , just as if people in my position had their sons educated out of spite ! It 's one of those petty troubles all boys have to go through . And you mark my words , my boy , when they go out into the world and have real trials to put up with , and grow middle - aged men , like me , why , they see what fools they 've been , Dick ; they see what fools they 've been . All the — hum , the innocent games and delights of boyhood , and that sort of thing , you know — come back to them — and then they look back to those hours passed at school as the happiest , aye , the very happiest time of their life ! "
6481	6484	6486	6486	Dick	60	" Well , "
6488	6552	6486	6486	Dick	60	" then I hope it wo n't be the happiest time in mine , that 's all ! And you may have been happy at the school you went to , perhaps , but I do n't believe you would very much care about being a boy again like me , and going back to Grimstone 's , you know you would n't ! "
6613	6620	6621	6621	he	57	" Perhaps you will believe me , "
6626	6677	6621	6621	he	57	" when I tell you , old as I am and much as you envy me , I only wish , at this very moment , I could be a boy again , like you . Going back to school would n't make me unhappy , I can tell you . "
6800	6862	6863	6864	For Dick	60	" I should like it , my boy , but what 's the good of wishing ? I only mention it to prove that I was not speaking at random . I 'm an old man and you 're a young boy , and , that being so , why , of course — What the dooce are you giggling about ? "
6912	6935	6905	6905	he	57	" I — ah — I'm not aware that I 've been saying anything particularly ridiculous . You seem to be amused ? "
6936	6940	6942	6942	Dick	60	" Do n't ! "
6944	6969	6905	6905	he	57	" It , it is n't anything you 're saying — it 's , it's — oh , ca n't you feel any difference ? "
6970	6981	6983	6983	Paul	57	" The sooner you go back to school the better ! "
6986	7036	6983	6983	Paul	57	" I wash my hands of you . When I do take the trouble to give you any advice , it 's received with ridicule . You always were an ill - mannered little cub . I 've had quite enough of this . Leave the room , sir ! "
7183	7209	7179	7179	he	242	" Now , perhaps , if you are quite yourself again , you will be good enough to let me know what the joke is ? "
7257	7281	7245	7245	his	60	" Have n't you found it out yet ? Go and look at yourself in the glass — it will make you roar ! "
7561	7579	7580	7580	he	57	" You , you 've been playing some of your infernal tricks with this mirror , sir , "
7584	7592	7580	7580	he	57	" What have you done to it ? "
7593	7612	7548	7548	He	57	" Done ! how could I do anything to it ? As if you did n't know that ! "
7613	7616	7618	7618	Paul	57	" Then , "
7626	7652	7618	7618	Paul	57	" then do you , do you mean to tell me you can see any — alteration in me ? Tell me the truth now ! "
7653	7661	7663	7663	Dick	60	" I should just think I could ! "
7666	7677	7679	7679	he	57	" It 's very queer , but just look here , "
7696	7699	7700	7700	he	57	" Why , "
7707	7720	7700	7700	he	57	" we're — he - he — as like as two peas ! "
7806	7809	7811	7811	Paul	57	" Dick , "
7814	7831	7811	7811	Paul	57	" what is all this ? Who has been , been taking these liberties with me ? "
7832	7841	7843	7843	Dick	60	" I 'm sure I do n't know , "
7845	7859	7843	7843	Dick	60	" It was n't me . I believe you did it all yourself . "
7860	7866	7868	7868	Paul	57	" Did it all myself ! "
7871	7897	7898	7898	he	57	" Is it likely I should ? It 's some trickery , I tell you , some villainous plot . The worst of it is , "
7902	7921	7898	7898	he	57	" I do n't understand who I 'm supposed to be now . Dick , who am I ? "
7922	7929	7931	7931	Dick	60	" You ca n't be me , "
7933	7961	7962	7962	he	57	" because here I am , you know . And you 're not yourself , that 's very plain . You must be somebody , I suppose , "
7966	7977	7979	7979	Paul	57	" Of course I am . What do you mean ? "
7982	8021	7979	7979	Paul	57	" Never mind who I am . I feel just the same as I always did . Tell me when you first began to notice any change . Could you see it coming on at all , eh ? "
8022	8063	7898	7898	he	57	" It was all at once , just as you were talking about school and all that . You said you only wished — — Why of course ; look here , it must be the stone that did it ! "
8064	8070	8072	8072	Paul	57	" Stone ! what stone ? "
8074	8085	8072	8072	Paul	57	" I do n't know what you 're talking about . "
8086	8121	7898	7898	he	57	" Yes , you do — the Garudâ Stone ! You 've got it in your hand still . Do n't you see ? It 's a real talisman after all ! How jolly ! "
8122	8159	7898	7898	he	57	" I did n't do anything to set it off ; and besides , oh , it 's perfectly absurd ! How can there be such things as talismans nowadays , eh ? Tell me that . "
8160	8181	8183	8183	Dick	60	" Well , something 's happened to you , has n't it ? And it must have been done somehow , "
8185	8195	8197	8197	Paul	57	" I was holding the confounded thing , certainly , "
8199	8223	8197	8197	Paul	57	" here it is . But what could I have said to start it ? What has it done this to me for ? "
8224	8228	8230	8230	Dick	60	" I know ! "
8232	8343	8230	8230	Dick	60	" Do n't you remember ? You said you wished you were a boy again , like me . So you are , you see , exactly like me ! What a lark it is , is n't it ? But , I say , you ca n't go up to business like that , you know , can you ? I tell you what , you 'd better come to Grimstone 's with me now , and see how you like it . I should n't mind so much if you came too . Grimstone 's face would be splendid when he saw two of us . Do come ! "
8344	8353	8355	8355	Paul	57	" That 's ridiculous nonsense you 're talking , "
8357	8443	8355	8355	Paul	57	" and you know it . What should I do at school at my age ? I tell you I 'm the same as ever inside , though I may have shrunk into a little rascally boy to look at . And it 's simply an abominable nuisance , Dick , that 's what it is ! Why on earth could n't you let the stone alone ? Just see what mischief you 've done by meddling now — put me to all this inconvenience ! "
8444	8451	8453	8453	Dick	60	" You should n't have wished , "
8455	8458	8453	8453	Dick	60	" Wished ! "
8463	8470	8471	8471	he	57	" Why , to be sure , "
8481	8564	8471	8471	he	57	" of course — I never thought of that . The thing 's a wishing stone ; it must be ! You have to hold it , I suppose , and then say what you wish aloud , and there you are . If that 's the case , I can soon put it all right by simply wishing myself back again . I — I shall have a good laugh at all this by and by — I know I shall ! "
8584	8592	8578	8578	he	57	" I wish I was back again , "
8593	8606	8578	8578	he	57	" I wish I was the man I was five minutes ago , "
8607	8616	8578	8578	he	57	" I wish all this had not happened , "
8686	8693	8694	8694	he	57	" I do n't like this , "
8708	8733	8694	8694	he	57	" It seems to me that this diabolical invention has got out of order somehow ; I ca n't make it work any more ! "
8734	8737	8739	8739	Dick	60	" Perhaps , "
8750	8774	8739	8739	Dick	60	" perhaps it 's one of those talismans that only give you one wish , and you 've had it , you know ? "
8775	8782	8784	8784	Paul	57	" Then it 's all over ! "
8786	8854	8784	8784	Paul	57	" What the dooce am I to do ? What shall I do ? Suggest something , for Heaven 's sake ; do n't stand cackling there in that unfeeling manner . Ca n't you see what a terrible , mess I 've got into ? Suppose — only suppose your sister or one of the servants were to come in , and see me like this ! "
8861	8869	8870	8870	he	60	" Let 's have 'em all up , "
8873	8889	8891	8891	he	60	" it would be such fun ! How they will laugh when we tell them ! "
8897	8905	8907	8907	Paul	57	" Touch that bell if you dare ! "
8909	9038	8907	8907	Paul	57	" I wo n't be seen in this condition by anybody ! What on earth could have induced that scoundrelly uncle of yours to bring such a horrible thing as this over I ca n't imagine ! I never heard of such a situation as this in my life . I ca n't stay like this , you know — it 's not to be thought of ! I — I wonder whether it would be any use to send over to Dr. Bustard and ask him to step in ; he might give me something to bring me round . But then the whole neighbourhood would hear about it ! If I do n't see my way out of this soon , I shall go raving mad ! "
9221	9228	9229	9229	he	60	" I may as well try , "
9232	9238	9229	9229	he	60	" give it to me . "
9239	9247	9249	9249	Paul	57	" Take it , my dear boy , "
9272	9285	9286	9286	Dick	60	" Take it , and wish your poor old father himself again ! "
9305	9312	9313	9313	he	60	" Is n't it any use ? "
9323	9329	9331	9331	Dick	60	" I do n't know , "
9334	9341	9331	9331	Dick	60	" I have n't wished yet . "
9342	9349	9351	9351	Paul	57	" Then do so at once , "
9354	9419	9351	9351	Paul	57	" do so at once . There 's no time to waste , every moment is of importance — your cab will be here directly . Although , although I 'm altered in this ridiculous way , I hope I still retain my authority as a father , and as a father , by Gad , I expect you to obey me , sir ! "
9420	9426	9428	9428	Dick	60	" Oh , all right , "
9431	9441	9428	9428	Dick	60	" you may keep the authority if you like . "
9442	9498	9351	9351	Paul	57	" Then do what I tell you . Ca n't you see how urgent it is that a scandal like this should n't get about ? I should be the laughing - stock of the city . Not a soul must ever guess that such a thing has happened . You must see that yourself . "
9499	9502	9504	9504	Dick	60	" Yes , "
9523	9555	9504	9504	Dick	60	" I see that . It will be all right . I 'm going to wish in a minute , and no one will guess there has been anything the matter . "
9556	9563	9565	9565	Paul	57	" That 's a good boy ! "
9570	9586	9565	9565	Paul	57	" I know your heart is in the right place — only do make haste . "
9587	9591	9351	9351	Paul	57	" I suppose , "
9595	9610	9351	9351	Paul	57	" when you are yourself again , things would go on just as usual ? "
9611	9618	9565	9565	Paul	57	" I — I hope so . "
9619	9638	9565	9565	Paul	57	" I mean you will go on sitting here , and I shall go off to Grimstone 's ? "
9639	9646	9648	9648	Paul	57	" Of course , of course , "
9650	9683	9648	9648	Paul	57	" do n't ask so many questions . I 'm sure you quite understand what has to be done , so get on . We might be found like this any minute . "
9684	9689	9691	9691	Dick	60	" That settles it , "
9693	9702	9691	9691	Dick	60	" any fellow would do it after that . "
9703	9716	9648	9648	Paul	57	" Yes , yes , but you 're so slow about it ! "
9717	9725	9727	9727	Dick	60	" Do n't be in a hurry , "
9729	9743	9727	9727	Dick	60	" you may n't like it after all when I 've done it . "
9744	9748	9750	9751	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Done what ? "
9766	9776	9778	9778	Dick	60	" Well , I do n't mind telling you , "
9780	9802	9778	9778	Dick	60	" it 's fairer . You see , you wished to be a boy just like me , did n't you ? "
9803	9810	9812	9812	Paul	57	" I did n't mean it , "
9814	9875	9812	9812	Paul	57	" Ah , you could n't expect a stone to know that ; at any rate , it made you into a boy like me directly . Now , if I wish myself a man just like you were ten minutes ago , before you took the stone , that will put things all right again , wo n't it ? "
9876	9882	9884	9884	Paul	57	" Is the boy mad ? "
9891	9903	9884	9884	Paul	57	" Why , why , that would be worse than ever ! "
9904	9911	9913	9913	Dick	60	" I do n't see that , "
9917	9927	9913	9913	Dick	60	" No one would know anything about it then . "
9928	9966	9812	9812	Paul	57	" But , you little blockhead , ca n't I make you understand ? It would n't do at all . We should both of us be wrong then — each with the other 's personal appearance . "
9967	9970	9972	9972	Dick	60	" Well , "
9975	9982	9972	9972	Dick	60	" I should n't mind that . "
9983	10046	9884	9884	Paul	57	" But I should — I mind very much . I object strongly to such a — such a preposterous arrangement . And what 's more , I wo n't have it . Do you hear , I forbid you to think of any such thing . Give me back that stone . I ca n't trust you with it after this . "
10047	10054	10056	10056	Dick	60	" I ca n't help it , "
10059	10086	10056	10056	Dick	60	" You 've had your wish , and I do n't see why I should n't have mine . I mean to have it , too . "
10087	10095	10128	10128	he	360	" Why , you unnatural little rascal ! "
10103	10126	10128	10128	he	360	" do you mean to defy me ? I tell you I will have that stone ! Give it up this instant ! "
10195	10211	10212	10212	he	360	" I 'd much rather you would n't make me hit you , you know , "
10215	10259	10212	10212	he	360	" because , in spite of what 's happened , you 're still my father , I suppose . But if you interfere with me before I 've done with this stone , I 'm afraid I shall have to punch your head . "
10369	10376	10377	10377	he	60	" Stand out of my way ! "
10381	10401	10377	10377	he	60	" I am going to do it . I wish I was a man like you were just now ! "
10469	10478	10479	10479	he	60	" It 's all right , you see , "
10482	10506	10479	10479	he	60	" The old stone 's as good as ever . You ca n't say anyone would ever know , to look at us . "
10563	10618	10552	10552	he	60	" Well , you 've had your way , and a pretty mess you 've made of it . We 're both of us in false positions now . I hope you 're satisfied , I 'm sure . Do you think you 'll care about going back to Crichton House in that state ? "
10619	10622	10624	10624	Dick	60	" No , "
10629	10638	10624	10624	Dick	60	" I 'm quite sure I should n't . "
10639	10687	10688	10688	Paul	57	" Well , I ca n't help it . You 've brought it on yourself ; and , provided the Doctor sees no objection to take you back as you are and receive you as one of his pupils , I shall most certainly send you there . "
10756	10759	10760	10760	he	57	" Oh , "
10763	10786	10760	10760	he	57	" you 're going to do that ? But does n't it strike you that things are rather altered with us now ? "
10787	10799	10801	10801	Paul	57	" They are , to a certain extent , of course , "
10803	10823	10801	10801	Paul	57	" through my folly and your wicked cunning ; but a word or two of explanation from me — — "
10824	10837	10839	10839	Dick	60	" You 'll find it will take more explanation than you think , "
10841	10865	10839	10839	Dick	60	" but , of course , you can try , if you think it worth while — when you get to Grimstone 's . "
10866	10879	10881	10881	Paul	57	" When I,—I do n't understand . When I,—what did you say ? "
10883	10889	10891	10891	Dick	60	" Why , you see , "
10893	10955	10891	10891	Dick	60	" it would never have done for us both to go back ; the chaps would have humbugged us so , and as I hate the place and you seem so fond of being a boy and going back to school and that , I thought perhaps it would be best for you to go and see how you liked it ! "
10956	10978	10980	10980	Paul	57	" I never will ! I 'll not stir from this room ! I dare you to try to move me ! "
11016	11024	11026	11026	Dick	60	" You 've no time to lose , "
11028	11034	11026	11026	Dick	60	" get your coat on . "
11053	11118	11046	11046	He	57	" Ha ! ha ! you 've fairly caught your poor father this time ; you 've proved him in the wrong . I admit I said more than I exactly meant . But that 's enough . Do n't drive a good joke too far ; shake hands , and let us see if we ca n't find a way out of this ! "
11144	11256	11130	11130	he	60	" You are going back to an excellent establishment , where you will enjoy all the comforts of home — I can specially recommend the stickjaw ; look out for it on Tuesdays and Fridays . You will once more take part in the games and lessons of happy boyhood . ( Did you ever play ' chevy ' when you were a boy before ? You 'll enjoy chevy . ) And you will find your companions easy enough to get on with , if you do n't go giving yourself airs ; they wo n't stand airs . Now good - bye , my boy , and bless you ! "
11291	11310	11311	11311	he	67	" Had a deal of trouble to find a keb , sir , on a night like this , "
11318	11338	11311	11311	he	67	" but the luggage is all on top , and the man says there 's plenty of time still . "
11339	11348	11350	11350	Dick	60	" Good - bye then , my boy , "
11367	11376	11377	11377	Paul	57	" My compliments to the Doctor , remember . "
11699	11733	11694	11694	he	57	" I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation , for I never knew so young a body with so old a head . "—Merchant
12072	12087	12088	12088	he	57	" I wonder now how the dickens I came to dream such outrageous nonsense ! "
12145	12157	12158	12158	he	57	" Gad , what a shock the thing has given me ! "
12161	12172	12158	12158	he	57	" I can hardly shake off the feeling even now . "
12498	12505	12506	12506	he	57	" If I have dined already , "
12510	12540	12506	12506	he	57	" I ca n't be going home to dinner ; and if I am not going home to dinner , what — what am I doing in this cab ? "
12741	12753	12788	12789	Mr. Bultitude	57	" wear - resisting fabrics , suitable for youths at school , "
12798	12801	12788	12789	Mr. Bultitude	57	" presence , "
13018	13024	13025	13025	he	57	" I must be cool , "
13035	13048	13025	13025	he	57	" quite cool and collected . Everything will depend on that now ! "
13257	13265	13266	13266	he	60	" I wo n't lose a minute ! "
13280	13283	13285	13285	he	60	" Stop ! "
13501	13509	13510	13510	he	84	" I must pay him something extra , "
13513	13525	13510	13510	he	84	" I 'll give him a sovereign to take me back . "
13920	13927	13928	13928	he	57	" Here , you , Clegg ! "
13931	13947	13928	13928	he	57	" why the devil did n't you pull up when I told you ? eh ? "
13985	13993	13994	13994	he	84	" Why did n't I pull up ? "
14004	14025	13994	13994	he	84	" 'Cause I did n't want to lose a good customer , that 's why I did n't pull up ! "
14026	14038	13971	13971	he	84	" Do you mean to say you do n't know me ? "
14039	14043	14045	14045	Clegg	84	" Know yer ? "
14053	14126	14045	14045	Clegg	84	" I 've knowed yer when you was a babby in frocks . I 've knowed yer fust nuss ( and a fine young woman she were till she took to drinking , as has been the ruin of many ) . I 've knowed yer in Infancy 's hour and in yer byhood 's bloom ! I 've druv yer to this ' ere werry station twice afore . Know yer ! "
14136	14164	14165	14165	Clegg	84	" Then , ah — drive me back at once . Let those boxes alone . I — I've important business at home which I 'd forgotten . "
14171	14179	14180	14180	he	84	" Lor , yer at it agin , "
14185	14221	14180	14180	he	84	" What a artful young limb it is ! But it ai n't what yer may call good enough , so to speak , it ai n't . Clegg do n't do that no more ! "
14222	14228	14230	14230	Paul	57	" Do n't do what ? "
14232	14256	14258	14258	Clegg	84	" Do n't drive no young gents as is a - bein ' sent to school back agin into their family 's bosims , "
14261	14350	14258	14258	Clegg	84	" You was took ill sudden in my cab the larst time . Offal bad you was , to be sure — to hear ye , and I druv ' yer back ; and I never got no return fare , I did n't , and yer par he made hisself downright nasty over it , said as if it occurred agin he should n't employ me no more . I durstn't go and offend yer par ; he 's a good customer to me , he is . "
14351	14362	14364	14364	Paul	57	" I 'll give you a sovereign to do it , "
14366	14385	14387	14387	Clegg	84	" If yer would n't tell no tales , I might put yer down at the corner p'raps , "
14396	14416	14417	14417	he	84	" not as it ai n't cheap at that , but let 's see yer suffering fust . Why , "
14436	14651	14423	14423	he	84	" y'ain't got no suffering ! Garn away , and do n't try to tempt a pore cabby as has his livin ' to make . What d'ye think of this , porter , now ? ' Ere 's a young gent a tryin ' to back out o ' going to school when he ought to be glad and thankful as he 's receivin ' the blessin 's of a good eddication . Look at me . I 'm a ' ard - workin ' man . I am . I ai n't ' ad no eddication . The kids , they 're a learnin ' French , and free'and drorin , and the bones on a skellington at the Board School , and I pays my coppers down every week cheerful . And why , porter ? Why , young master ? 'Cause I knows the vally on it ! But when I sees a real young gent a despisin ' of the oppertoonities as a bountiful Providence and a excellent par has ' eaped on his ' ed , it — it makes me sick , it inspires Clegg with a pity and a contemp ' for such ingratitood , which he cares not for to ' ide from public voo ! "
14675	14679	14681	14682	the latter	446	" Go away , "
14684	14693	14681	14682	the latter	446	" that 's enough . You 're drunk ! "
14694	14697	14699	14701	the outraged Clegg	84	" Drunk ! "
14711	14829	14708	14708	his	84	" ' Ear that . ' Ark at this ' ere young cock sparrer as tells a fam'ly man like Clegg as he 's drunk ! Drunk , after drivin ' his par in this ' ere werry cab through frost and fine fifteen year and more ! I wonder yer do n't say the old ' orse is drunk ; you 'll be sayin ' that next ! Drunk ! oh , cert'nly , by all means . Never you darken my cab doors no more . I shall take and tell your par , I shall . Drunk , indeed ! A ill - conditioned young wiper as ever I see . Drunk ! yah ! "
14858	14866	14868	14869	a porter	447	" Where for , sir , please ? "
14886	14889	14891	14892	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Nowhere , "
14894	14913	14891	14892	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I — I'm not going by this train ; find me a cab with a sober driver . "
14942	14955	14956	14956	he	449	" You might find one inside the station by the arrival platform , "
14959	14984	14956	14956	he	449	" but there 'll be sure to be one comin ' up here in another minute , sir , if you like to wait . "
15066	15069	15063	15065	several Cambridge men	456	" going up "
15172	15174	15181	15183	real frantic passengers	467	" rally "
15242	15247	15248	15248	he	471	" Hallo , Bultitude ! "
15251	15267	15248	15248	he	471	" I thought it was you . Here we are again , eh ? Ugh ! "
15337	15349	15351	15352	the boy	246	" You might find a word to say to a fellow ! "
15358	15369	15351	15352	the boy	246	" Look here ; come and get your luggage labelled . "
15370	15378	15380	15380	Paul	57	" I do n't want it labelled , "
15389	15402	15403	15404	The other	2428	" I 'm waiting for a cab to take me home again . "
15410	15476	15403	15404	The other	2428	" That 'll make it rather a short term , wo n't it , if you 're going home for the holidays already ? You 're a cool chap , Bultitude ! If I were to go back to my governor now , he would n't see it . It would put him in no end of a bait . But you 're chaffing — — "
15501	15507	15509	15510	the boy	246	" Are n't you well ? "
15527	15602	15509	15510	the boy	246	" Down in the mouth ? It is beastly , is n't it , having to go back to old Grimstone 's ! The snow gave us an extra week , though — we've that much to be thankful for . I wish it was the first day of the holidays again , do n't you ? What 's the matter with you ? What have I done to put you in a wax ? "
15603	15608	15610	15610	Paul	57	" Nothing at present , "
15612	15636	15610	15610	Paul	57	" I do n't speak to you merely because I do n't happen to have the — ah — pleasure of your acquaintance . "
15637	15651	15653	15654	the other	2428	" Oh , very well , then ; I daresay you know best , "
15657	15696	15653	15654	the other	2428	" Only I thought — considering we came the same half , and have been chums , and always sat next one another ever since — you might perhaps just recollect having met me before , you know . "
15697	15704	15706	15707	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Well , I do n't , "
15709	15769	15770	15770	He	57	" I tell you I have n't the least idea what your name is . The fact is there has been a slight mistake , which I ca n't stop to talk about now . There 's a cab just driven up outside now . You must excuse me , really , my boy , I want to go . "
15799	15808	15809	15809	he	57	" What a fellow you are , Bultitude ! "
15812	15855	15809	15809	he	57	" always up to something or other . You know me well enough . What is the use of keeping it up any longer ? Let 's talk , and stop humbugging . How much grub have you brought back this time ? "
15964	15967	15968	15968	he	57	" Porter ! "
15971	16025	15968	15968	he	57	" Where 's that porter ? I want my box put on that cab . No , I do n't care about the luggage ; engage the cab . Now , you little ruffian , are you going to let me go ? Ca n't you see I 'm anxious to get away ? "
16033	16041	16042	16042	he	78	" Well , you have got cheek ! "
16045	16061	16042	16042	he	78	" Go on , I wish you may get that cab , I 'm sure ! "
16500	16503	16537	16537	He	57	" patent safety "
16591	16657	16580	16580	He	57	" Ha , Bultitude , my boy , how are you ? How are you , Jolland ? Come back braced in body and mind by your vacation , eh ? That 's as it should be . Have you tickets ? No ? follow me then . You 're both over age , I believe . There you are ; take care of them . "
16696	16701	16703	16703	Paul	57	" This is awful , "
16708	16752	16703	16703	Paul	57	" simply awful . He evidently has no idea who I really am . Unless I 'm very careful I shall be dragged off to Crichton House before I can put him right . If I could only get him away alone somewhere . "
16786	16827	16761	16762	the Doctor	248	" I wish to have a little serious conversation with Richard in private . Suppose you go to the bookstall and see if you can find out any of our young friends . Tell them to wait for me there . "
16935	16944	16946	16947	the Doctor	248	" I wished to tell you , Bultitude , "
16961	17004	16951	16951	his	248	" that I hope you are returning this term with the resolve to do better things . You have caused your excellent father much pain in the past . You little know the grief a wilful boy can inflict on his parent . "
17005	17017	17019	17019	Paul	57	" I think I have a very fair idea of it , "
17026	17048	17022	17022	he	57	" I hope you left him in good health ? Such a devoted parent , Richard — such a noble heart ! "
17102	17113	17115	17116	Dr. Grimstone	62	" I had a letter from him during the vacation , "
17118	17139	17115	17116	Dr. Grimstone	62	" a sweet letter , Richard , breathing in every line a father 's anxiety and concern for your welfare . "
17161	17164	17152	17152	he	57	" sweet , "
17199	17260	17166	17166	he	57	" But — and this is what I wanted to say to you , Bultitude — his is no blind doting affection . He has implored me , for your own sake , if I see you diverging ever so slightly from the path of duty , not to stay my hand . And I shall not forget his injunctions . "
17385	17402	17403	17403	he	57	" Perhaps I had better leave him in his error till we get into the train , "
17406	17437	17403	17403	he	57	" then we will get rid of that other boy , and I can break it to him gradually in the railway carriage as I get more accustomed to him . "
17494	17498	17500	17501	the Doctor	248	" And now , "
17523	17540	17500	17501	the Doctor	248	" we must be thinking of starting . But do n't forget what I have said . "
17586	17589	17591	17592	Dr. Grimstone	62	" Aha ! "
17605	17633	17591	17592	Dr. Grimstone	62	" more of my fellows , eh ? We shall be quite a party . How do you do , boys ? Welcome back to your studies . "
17658	17666	17668	17669	the Doctor	248	" Some old friends here , Bultitude , "
17679	17753	17668	17669	the Doctor	248	" You know Tipping , of course ; Coker , too , you 've met before — and Coggs . How are you , Siggers ? You 're looking well . Ah , by the way , I see a new face — Kiffin , I think ? Kiffin , this is Bultitude , who will make himself your mentor , I hope , and initiate you into our various manners and customs . "
17867	17874	17832	17832	Tipping	71	" how - de - do ? "
17932	17940	17901	17901	Siggers	90	" How are you , old boy ? "

18491	18499	18500	18500	he	57	" I will let him speak first , "
18503	18514	18500	18500	he	57	" then I shall be able to feel my way . "
18563	18625	18531	18532	the Doctor	248	" Well , boys , you have had an unusually protracted vacation this time — owing to the unprecedented severity of the weather . We must try to make up for it by the zest and ardour with which we pursue our studies during the term . I intend to reduce the Easter holidays by a week by way of compensation . "
18668	18680	18681	18681	he	57	" I 'm uncommonly glad to hear it , Dr. Grimstone , "
18685	18744	18681	18681	he	57	" an excellent arrangement . Boys have too many holidays as it is . There 's no reason , to my mind , why parents should be the sufferers by every snowstorm . It 's no joke , I can assure you , to have a great idle boy hanging about the place eating his empty head off ! "
18857	18896	18850	18850	he	248	" This is indeed finding Saul amongst the prophets ; your sentiments , if sincere , Bultitude — I repeat , if sincere — are very creditable . But I am obliged to look upon them with suspicion ! "
18911	18924	18907	18907	he	248	" And how have you all been spending your holidays , eh ! "
18945	18951	18965	18965	he	248	" How do you do ? "
18970	19054	18965	18965	he	248	" I took my boy Tom up to town the week before Christmas to see the representation of the ' Agamemnon ' at St. George 's Hall . The ' Agamemnon , ' as most of you are doubtless aware , is a drama by Æschylus , a Greek poet of established reputation . I was much pleased by the intelligent appreciation Tom showed during the performance . He distinctly recognised several words from his Greek Grammar in the course of the dialogue . "
19081	19089	19090	19090	he	57	" I may be old - fashioned , "
19093	19125	19090	19090	he	57	" very likely I am ; but I — ah — decidedly disapprove of taking children to dramatic exhibitions of any kind . It unsettles them , sir — unsettles them ! "
19174	19181	19183	19183	Paul	57	" I 've offended him now , "
19185	19205	19183	19183	Paul	57	" I must be more careful what I say . But I 'll get him into conversation again presently . "
19214	19233	19207	19207	he	62	" You have this evening 's paper , I see . No telegrams of importance , I suppose ? "
19234	19239	19241	19242	the Doctor	248	" No , sir , "
19245	19257	19260	19261	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I saw a report in to - day 's Times , "
19275	19309	19311	19311	he	57	" I saw a report that the camphor crop was likely to be a failure this season . Now , it 's a very singular thing about camphor , that the Japanese — — "
19340	19357	19359	19360	the Doctor	248	" I am already acquainted with the method of obtaining camphor , thank you , Bultitude , "
19366	19378	19380	19380	Paul	57	" I was about to observe , when you interrupted me , "
19382	19406	19380	19380	Paul	57	" ( and this is really a fact that I doubt if you are aware of ) , that the Japanese never — — "
19407	19412	19414	19415	the Doctor	248	" Well , well , "
19421	19446	19414	19415	the Doctor	248	" probably they never do , sir , but I shall have other opportunities of finding out what you have read about the Japanese . "
19504	19508	19510	19510	Bultitude	57	" He 's most uncivil"—Mr
19512	19540	19510	19510	Bultitude	57	himself—"almost insulting , but I 'll go on . I 'm rousing his curiosity . I 'm making way with him ; he sees a difference already . "
19549	19561	19562	19562	he	57	" You 're a smoker , of course , Dr. Grimstone ? "
19565	19605	19562	19562	he	57	" We do n't stop anywhere , I think , on the way , and I must confess myself , after dinner , a whiff or two — I think I can give you a cigar you 'll appreciate . "
19642	19651	19653	19654	the Doctor	248	" If I did not know , sir , "
19660	19722	19653	19654	the Doctor	248	" that this was ill - timed buffoonery , and not an intentional insult , I should be seriously angry . As it is , I can overlook any exuberance of mirth which is , perhaps , pardonable when the mind is elated by the return to the cheerful bustle and activity of school - life . But be very careful . "
19723	19731	19733	19733	Paul	57	" He need n't be so angry , "
19735	19759	19733	19733	Paul	57	" how could I know he does n't smoke ? But I 'm afraid he does n't quite know me , even now . "
19765	19861	19761	19761	he	57	" Did I hear you mention the name of Kiffin amongst those of your pupils here , Doctor ? I thought so . Not the son of Jordan Kiffin , of College Hill , surely ? Yes ? Why , bless my soul , your father and I , my little fellow , were old friends in days before you were born or thought of — born or thought of . He was in a very small way then , a very small — — Eh , Dr. Grimstone , do n't you feel well ? "
19862	19891	19733	19733	Paul	57	" I see what you 're aiming at , sir . You wish to prove to me that I 'm making a mistake in my treatment of you . "
19892	19900	19902	19902	Paul	57	" That was my idea , certainly , "
19907	19918	19902	19902	Paul	57	" I 'm very glad you take me , Doctor . "
19919	19938	19940	19941	the Doctor	248	" I shall take you in a way you wo n't appreciate soon , if this goes on , "
19946	19972	19973	19973	he	248	" When the time comes I shall know how to deal with you . Till then you 'll have the goodness to hold your tongue , "
19977	19989	19990	19990	Paul	57	" It 's not a very polite way of putting it , "
19995	20051	19990	19990	Paul	57	" but , at any rate , he sees how the case stands now , and after all , perhaps , he only speaks like that to put the boys off the scent . If so , it 's uncommonly considerate and thoughtful of him , by Gad . I wo n't say any more . "
20068	20079	20080	20080	he	248	" I 'm sorry to inconvenience you , Dr. Grimstone , "
20097	20149	20080	20080	he	248	" but I positively must ask you either to allow me to have this window up or to change places with you . The night air , sir , at this time of the year is fatal , my doctor tells me , simply fatal to a man of my constitution . "
20167	20174	20175	20175	he	248	" I warn you , Bultitude , "
20178	20185	20175	20175	he	248	" you are acting very imprudently . "
20186	20191	20193	20193	Paul	57	" So I am , "
20195	20313	20193	20193	Paul	57	" so I am . Good of him to remind me . I must keep it up before all these boys . This unpleasant business must n't get about . I 'll hold my tongue till we get in . Then , I daresay , Grimstone will see me off by the next train up , if there is one , and lend me enough for a bed at an hotel for the night . I could n't get to St. Pancras till very late , of course . Or he might offer to put me up at the school . If he does , I think I shall very possibly accept . It might be better . "
20421	20423	20427	20427	they	592	" squirks "
20851	20855	20856	20856	he	589	" Dr. Grimstone , "
20862	20951	20856	20856	he	589	" I 'm not a man to complain without good reason , but really I must ask you to interfere . Will you tell this boy here , on my right , either to control his feelings or to cry into his pocket - handkerchief , like an ordinary human being ? A good honest bellow I can understand , but this infernal whiffling and sniffing , sir , I will not put up with . It 's nothing less than unnatural in a boy of that size . "
20952	20955	20957	20958	the Doctor	248	" Kiffin , "
20960	20965	20957	20958	the Doctor	248	" are you crying ? "
20966	20973	20975	20975	Kiffin	91	" N — no , sir , "
20977	20990	20975	20975	Kiffin	91	" I — I think I must have caught cold , sir . "
20991	21130	20957	20958	the Doctor	248	" I hope you are telling me the truth , because I should be sorry to believe you were beginning your new life in a spirit of captiousness and rebellion . I 'll have no mutineers in my camp . I 'll establish a spirit of trustful happiness and unmurmuring content in this school , if I have to flog every boy in it as long as I can stand over him ! As for you , Richard Bultitude , I have no words to express my pain and disgust at the heartless irreverence with which you persist in mimicking and burlesquing a fond and excellent parent . Unless I perceive , sir , in a very short time a due sense of your error and a lively repentance , my disapproval will take a very practical form . "
21344	21368	21369	21369	he	57	" Do you encourage your boys to make common nuisances of themselves in a public place , may I ask , Dr. Grimstone ? "
21374	21384	21386	21387	the Doctor	248	" Some scarcely seem to require encouragement , Bultitude , "
21390	21397	21386	21387	the Doctor	248	" what is the matter now ? "
21398	21405	21407	21407	Paul	57	" If he takes it medicinally , "
21409	21454	21407	21407	Paul	57	" he should choose some other time and place to treat his complaint . If he has a depraved liking for the abominable stuff , for Heaven 's sake make him refrain from it on occasions when it is a serious annoyance to others ! "
21455	21468	21386	21387	the Doctor	248	" Will you explain ? Who and what are you talking about ? "
21469	21474	21476	21476	Paul	57	" That boy opposite , "
21488	21506	21476	21476	Paul	57	" he 's sucking an infernal peppermint lozenge strong enough to throw the train off the rails ! "
21507	21517	21519	21520	the Doctor	248	" Is what Bultitude tells me true , Coggs ? "
21556	21565	21567	21567	he	89	" bought the lozenges at a chemist 's , "
21580	21592	21594	21595	the Doctor	248	" Have you any more of this pernicious stuff about you ? "
21707	21710	21711	21711	he	62	" Bultitude , "
21714	21771	21711	21711	he	62	" I am obliged to you . A severe cold in the head has rendered me incapable of detecting this insidious act of insubordination and self - indulgence , on which I shall have more to say on another occasion . Your moral courage and promptness in denouncing the evil thing are much to your credit . "
21772	21777	21779	21779	Paul	57	" Not at all , "
21781	21809	21779	21779	Paul	57	" not at all , my dear sir . I mentioned it because I — ah — happen to be peculiarly sensitive on the subject and — — "
21826	21877	21811	21811	he	57	" One of these young savages has just given me a severe kick ; it 's that fellow over there , with the blue necktie . I have given him no provocation , and he attacks me in this brutal manner , sir ; I appeal to you for protection ! "
21878	21882	21884	21884	Coker	88	" So , Coker "
21895	21983	21892	21893	the Doctor	248	" you emulate the wild ass in more qualities than those of stupidity and stubbornness , do you ? You lash out with your hind legs at an inoffensive school - fellow , with all the viciousness of a kangaroo , eh ? Write out all you find in Buffon 's Natural History upon those two animals a dozen times , and bring it to me by to - morrow evening . If I am to stable wild asses , sir , they shall be broken in ! "
22103	22107	22095	22096	melancholy porters	626	" Market Rodwell ! "
22152	22164	22165	22165	he	57	" I should like to tell him all about it now , "
22168	22199	22165	22165	he	57	" if he was n't so busy . I 'll get him to go in a cab alone with me , and get it over before we reach the house . "
22242	22251	22252	22252	he	62	" It 's scandalous , I tell you , "
22256	22361	22252	22252	he	62	" scandalous ! No cabs to meet the train . My school reassembles to - day , and here I find no arrangements made for their accommodation ! Not even an omnibus ! I shall write to the manager and report this . Let some one go for a fly immediately . Boys , go into the waiting room till I come to you . Stay — there are too many for one fly . Coker , Coggs , and , let me see , yes , Bultitude , you all know your way . Walk on and tell Mrs. Grimstone we are coming . "
22427	22434	22435	22435	he	57	" They will be valuable witnesses , "
22440	22454	22435	22435	he	57	" that , whoever else I may be , I am not Dick . "
22545	22548	22550	22550	Paul	57	" Well , "
22558	22607	22550	22550	Paul	57	" here you are , young men , eh ? Holidays all over now ! Work while you 're young , and then — — Gad , you 're walking me off my legs . Stop ; I 'm not as young as I used to be — — "
22608	22621	22623	22623	Coggs	89	" Grim ca n't see us here , can he , Coker ? "
22633	22637	22639	22639	Coker	88	" Not he ! "
22641	22687	22639	22639	Coker	88	" Very well , then . Now then , young Bultitude , you used to be a decent fellow enough last term , though you were coxy . So , before we go any further — what do you mean by this sort of thing ? "
22688	22691	22550	22550	Paul	57	" Because , "
22696	22738	22550	22550	Paul	57	" if you are n't quite right in your head , through your old governor acting like a brute all the holidays , as you said he does , just say so , and we wo n't be hard on you . "
22739	22749	22751	22751	Paul	57	" I — he — always an excellent father , "
22753	22760	22751	22751	Paul	57	" What am I to explain ? "
22761	22782	22784	22784	Coker	88	" Why , what did you go and sneak of him for bringing tuck back to school for , eh ? "
22786	22798	22800	22800	Coggs	89	" Yes , and sing out when he hacked your shin ? "
22802	22827	22800	22800	Coggs	89	" and tell Grimstone that new fellow was blubbing ? Where 's the joke in all that , eh ? Where 's the joke ? "
22828	22856	22858	22859	Mr. Bultitude	57	" You do n't suppose I was bound to sit calmly down and allow you to suck your villainous peppermints under my very nose , do you ? "
22861	22915	22858	22859	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Why should n't I complain if a boy annoys me by sniffing , or kicks me on the ankle ? Just tell me that ? Suppose my neighbour has a noisy dog or a smoky chimney , am I not to venture to tell him of it ? Is he to — — "
22961	22966	22968	22968	Paul	57	" You little brute ! "
22970	22981	22968	22968	Paul	57	" I could have you up for assault for that ! "
22994	23008	23009	23009	they	638	" Last term you 'd have shown fight for much less , Bultitude , "
23022	23035	23037	23037	Coker	88	" Now , perhaps , you 'll drop it for the future , "
23039	23118	23037	23037	Coker	88	" Look here ! we 'll give you one more chance . This sneaking dodge is all very well for Chawner . Chawner could do that sort of thing without getting sat upon , because he 's a big fellow ; but we 're not going to stand it from you . Will you promise on your sacred word of honour , now , to be a decent sort of chap again , as you were last term ? "
23174	23180	23181	23181	he	57	" You do n't understand , "
23185	23194	23181	23181	he	57	" If I could only tell you — — "
23195	23207	23209	23211	the relentless Coggs	89	" We do n't want any fine language , you know , "
23213	23228	23209	23211	the relentless Coggs	89	" Yes or no . Will you promise to be your old self again ? "
23229	23236	23181	23181	he	57	" I only wish I could , "
23240	23245	23181	23181	he	57	Bultitude—"but I ca n't ! "
23246	23252	23254	23254	Coggs	89	" Very well , then , "
23257	23286	23254	23254	Coggs	89	" we must try the torture . Coker , will you screw the back of his hand , while I show him how they make barley - sugar ? "

23447	23458	23436	23436	he	88	" for a father to visit his son 's school ! "
23675	23682	23683	23683	she	100	" Why , here you are ! "
23699	23738	23683	23683	she	100	" How cold you look ! So you actually had to walk . No cabs as usual . You poor boys ! come in and warm yourselves . You 'll find all your old friends in the schoolroom . "
24128	24131	24133	24134	Mrs. Grimstone	100	" There ! "
24137	24159	24133	24134	Mrs. Grimstone	100	" you 'll have plenty to talk to one another about . I 'll send Tom in to see you presently ! "
24236	24240	24242	24243	one boy	671	" I say , "
24250	24291	24242	24243	one boy	671	" did you go to Drury Lane ? Was n't it stunning ! That goose , you know , and the lion in the forest , and all the wooden animals lumbering in out of the toy Noah 's Ark ! "
24292	24306	24308	24308	another	672	" Why could n't you come to our party on Twelfth - night ? "
24310	24323	24242	24243	one boy	671	" We had great larks . I wish you 'd been there ! "
24324	24335	24337	24352	a pale , spiteful - looking boy , with fair hair carefully parted in the middle	673	" I had to go to young Skidmore 's instead , "
24354	24382	24337	24352	a pale , spiteful - looking boy , with fair hair carefully parted in the middle	673	" It was like his cheek to ask me , but I thought I 'd go , you know , just to see what it was like . "
24383	24389	24391	24395	one or two near him	674	" What was it like ? "
24398	24486	24391	24395	one or two near him	674	" Oh , awfully slow ! They 've a poky little house in Brompton somewhere , and there was no dancing , only boshy games and a conjurer , without any presents . And , oh ! I say , at supper there was a big cake on the table , and no one was allowed to cut it , because it was hired . They 're so poor , you know . Skidmore 's pater is only a clerk , and you should see his sisters ! "
24487	24494	24337	24352	a pale , spiteful - looking boy , with fair hair carefully parted in the middle	673	" Why , are they pretty ? "
24495	24535	24391	24395	one or two near him	674	" Pretty ! they 're just like young Skidmore — only uglier ; and just fancy , his mother asked me ' if I was Skidmore 's favourite companion , and if he helped me in my studies ? ' "
24612	24625	24607	24608	some one	260	" Does any one know whether Chawner really has left this time ? "
24626	24631	24633	24637	a big , heavy boy	677	" I hope so , "
24649	24685	24633	24637	a big , heavy boy	677	" He 's been going to leave every term for the last year , but I believe he really has done it this time . He wrote and told me he was n't coming back . "
24686	24690	24692	24692	several	678	" Thank goodness ! "
24747	24755	24756	24756	they	678	" Look out — here 's Grimstone ! "
24860	24866	24867	24867	he	544	" Well , you fellows ? "
24880	24885	24886	24886	they	678	" Why , Chawner ! "
24889	24905	24886	24886	they	678	" how are you , old fellow ? We thought you were n't coming back ! "
24933	24936	24938	24938	Chawner	101	" Well , "
24955	25006	25007	25007	He	101	" I was going to leave , but I thought you 'd be getting into mischief here without me to watch over you . Appleton , and Lench , and Coker want looking after badly , I know . So , you see , I 've come back after all . "
25094	25124	25089	25089	his	95	" I say , you chaps , have you done your holiday task ? Pa says he shall keep everyone in who has n't . I 've done mine ; "
25196	25225	25184	25185	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Why , there 's Dicky Bultitude there all the time , and he never came to shake hands ! Are n't you going to speak to me ? "
25237	25245	25247	25247	Chawner	101	" What 's the matter with him ? "
25249	25260	25247	25247	Chawner	101	" Does anyone know ? Has he lost his tongue ? "
25261	25273	25275	25275	Coker	88	" He had n't lost it coming down in the train , "
25277	25311	25275	25275	Coker	88	" I wish he had . I tell you what , you fellows — He — here 's Grim at last ! I 'll tell you all about it up in the bedroom . "

25607	25617	25618	25618	he	62	" You got into trouble last term , Bultitude , "
25622	25662	25618	25618	he	62	" on account of this same fastidious daintiness . Your excellent father has informed me of your waste and gluttony at his own bountifully spread table . Do n't let me have occasion to reprove you for this again . "

25742	25793	25737	25737	he	57	" Dick seems very unpopular . I wish I did n't feel so low - spirited and unwell . Why ca n't I carry it off easily as — as a kind of joke ? How hard these forms are , and how those infernal boys did jog my back ! "
25920	25924	25925	25925	he	57	" Dr. Grimstone , "
25928	25952	25925	25925	he	57	" before retiring I — I must insist — I mean I must request — — What I wish to say is — — "
25953	25957	25959	25960	the Doctor	248	" I see , "
25967	26004	25959	25960	the Doctor	248	" You wish to apologise for your extraordinary behaviour in the railway carriage ? Well , though you made some amends afterwards , an apology is very right and proper . Say no more about it . "
26005	26011	26013	26013	Paul	57	" It 's not that , "
26016	26023	26013	26013	Paul	57	" I wanted to explain — — "
26024	26061	25959	25960	the Doctor	248	" Your conduct with regard to the bread and butter ? If it was simply want of appetite , of course there is no more to be said . But I have an abhorrence of — — "
26062	26066	26068	26068	Paul	57	" Quite right , "
26073	26090	26068	26068	Paul	57	" I hate waste myself , but there is something I must tell you before — — "
26091	26102	26104	26105	the Doctor	248	" If it concerns that disgraceful conduct of Coker 's , "
26107	26159	26104	26105	the Doctor	248	" you may speak on . I shall have to consider his case to - morrow . Has any similar case of disobedience come to your knowledge ? If so , I expect you to disclose it to me . You have found some other boy with sweetmeats in his possession ? "
26160	26166	26168	26169	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Good Heavens , sir ! "
26175	26266	26168	26169	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I have n't been searching the whole school for sweetmeats ! I have other things to occupy my mind , sir . And , once for all , I demand to be heard ! Dr. Grimstone , there are , ahem , domestic secrets that can only be alluded to in the strictest privacy . I see that one of your assistants is writing at his table there . Can not we go where there will be less risk of interruption ? You have a study , I suppose ? "
26267	26272	26274	26275	the Doctor	248	" Yes , sir , "
26280	26340	26274	26275	the Doctor	248	" I have a study — and I have a cane . I can convince you of both facts , if you wish it . If you insult me again by this brazen buffoonery , I will ! Be off to your dormitory , sir , before you provoke me to punish you . Not another word ! Go ! "
26411	26418	26420	26421	a housemaid	718	" Good night , Master Bultitude , "
26429	26451	26420	26421	a housemaid	718	" you know your bedroom . No . 6 , with Master Coker , and Master Biddlecomb , and the others . "
26543	26557	26558	26558	they	722	" Here he is ! He 's stayed behind to tell more tales ! "
26566	26581	26562	26562	Paul	57	" Now then , Bultitude , what have you got to say for yourself ? "
26635	26648	26650	26650	Tipping	90	" You see he has n't a word to say for himself ! "
26652	26707	26650	26650	Tipping	90	" Look here , what shall we do to him ? Shall we try tossing in a blanket ? I 've never tried tossing a fellow in one myself , but as long as you do n't jerk him too high , or out on the floor , you ca n't hurt him dangerously . "
26708	26722	26724	26724	Biddlecomb	92	" No , I say , do n't toss him in a blanket , "
26736	26756	26727	26727	Paul	57	" anyone coming up would see what was going on . I vote we flick at him with towels . "
26757	26765	26767	26767	Paul	57	" Now just you understand this clearly , "
26786	26839	26767	26767	Paul	57	" I refuse to allow myself to be flicked at with towels . No one has ever offered me such an indignity in my life ! Oh , do you think I 've not enough on my mind as it is without the barbarities of a set of young brutes like you ! "
26933	26959	26926	26926	Biddlecomb	92	" Cave , you fellows ! I hear Grim . Let him undress now , and we can lam it into him afterwards with slippers ! "

27704	27742	27701	27701	she	747	" I am so glad ! I thought you 'd be down early ; as you used to be . I wanted to sit up last night so very much , but mamma would n't let me . "
27854	27857	27858	27858	he	57	" Ah , "
27863	27884	27858	27858	he	57	" and so you 're Dr. Grimstone 's little girl , are you ? How d'ye do , my dear ? "
27901	27909	27910	27910	she	110	" What makes you talk like that ? "
27913	27920	27922	27922	Paul	57	" How ought I to talk ? "
27924	27933	27935	27935	Dulcie	110	" You did n't talk like that before , "
27938	28043	27935	27935	Dulcie	110	" I — I thought perhaps you 'd be glad to see me . You were once . And — and — when you went away last you asked me to — to — kiss you , and I did , and I wish I had n't . And you gave me a ginger lozenge with your name written on it in lead pencil , and I gave you a cough - lozenge with mine ; and you said it was to show that you were my sweetheart and I was yours . But I suppose you 've eaten the one I gave you ? "
28044	28049	28051	28052	Mr. Bultitude	57	" This is dreadful ! "
28054	28072	28051	28052	Mr. Bultitude	57	" What shall I do now ? The child evidently takes me for that little scoundrel Dick . "
28073	28078	28079	28079	he	57	" Tut - tut , "
28083	28115	28079	28079	he	57	" little girls like you are too young for such nonsense . You ought to think about — about your dolls , and — ah , your needlework — not sweethearts ! "
28116	28122	28124	28124	Dulcie	110	" You say that now ! "
28127	28167	28124	28124	Dulcie	110	" You know I 'm not a little girl , and I 've left off playing with dolls — almost . Oh , Dick , do n't be unkind ! You have n't changed your mind , have you ? "
28168	28171	28173	28173	Paul	57	" No , "
28176	28203	28173	28173	Paul	57	" I 've changed my body . But there — you would n't understand . Run away and play somewhere , like a good little girl ! "
28204	28211	28213	28213	Dulcie	110	" I know what it is ! "
28215	28239	28213	28213	Dulcie	110	" You 've been out to parties , or somewhere , and seen some horrid girl ... you like ... better than me ! "
28240	28248	28250	28251	Mr. Bultitude	57	" This is absurd , you know , "
28253	28293	28250	28251	Mr. Bultitude	57	" You ca n't think how absurd it is ! Now , you 'll be a very foolish little girl if you cry . You 're making a mistake . I 'm not the Dick you used to know ! "
28294	28301	28303	28303	Dulcie	110	" I know you 're not ! "
28305	28321	28303	28303	Dulcie	110	" But oh , Dick , you will be . Promise me you will be ! "
28346	28350	28351	28351	he	57	" Good gracious ! "
28354	28387	28351	28351	he	57	" let me go . Do n't do that , for Heaven 's sake ! I can hear some one coming . If it 's your father , it will ruin me ! "
28468	28481	28463	28463	Tipping	90	" What have you been saying to make her cry , eh ? "
28482	28491	28493	28493	Paul	57	" What 's that to you , sir ? "
28502	28512	28514	28514	Tipping	90	" Why , it 's just this to me , "
28516	28578	28514	28514	Tipping	90	" that I 've been spoons on Dulcie myself ever since I came , and she never would have a word to say to me . I never could think why , and now it turns out to be you ! What do you mean by cutting me out like this ? I heard her call you ' dear Dick . ' "
28579	28588	28590	28590	Paul	57	" Do n't be an ass , sir ! "
28593	28604	28606	28606	Tipping	90	" Now , none of your cheek , you know ! "
28628	28716	28606	28606	Tipping	90	" You just mind what I say . I 'm not going to have Dulcie bothered by a young beggar in the second form ; she deserves something better than that , anyway , and I tell you that if I once catch you talking to her in the way you did just now , or if I hear of her favouring you more than any other fellows , I 'll give you the very juiciest licking you ever had in your life . So look out ! "
28758	28769	28770	28770	he	57	" I must tell the Doctor how I 'm situated ! "
28773	28828	28770	28770	he	57	" and yet directly I open my mouth , he threatens to flog me . If I stay here , that little girl will be always trying to speak to me , and I shall be thrashed by the red - haired boy . If I could only manage to speak out after breakfast ! "
28842	28846	28838	28838	he	57	" meat for breakfast "

29426	29479	29418	29419	the Doctor	248	" if it were my custom to rebuke my assistants before the school ( which it is not ) , I should feel forced to remind you that this tardiness in rising is a bad beginning of the day 's work , and sets a bad example to those under your authority . "
29528	29575	29519	29520	the Doctor	248	" Now , boys , you have half - an - hour for ' chevy'—make the most of it . When you come in I shall have something to say to you all . Do n't rise , Mr. Tinkler , unless you have quite finished . "
29602	29606	29600	29600	he	109	" made an excellent breakfast"—which

30183	30246	30176	30176	he	109	" is that a fellow ca n't have his pipe of a morning . I 've been used to it , and so , of course , I miss it . If I chose to insist on it Grimstone could n't say anything ; but with a lot of young fellows like you , you see , it would n't look well ! "
30319	30324	30325	30325	he	109	" Talking of smoking , "
30341	30413	30325	30325	he	109	" did I ever tell you chaps of a tremendous scrape I very nearly got into up at the ' Varsity ? Well , you must know there 's a foolish rule there against smoking in the streets . Not that that made any difference to some of us ! Well , one night about nine , I was strolling down Petty Cury with two other men , smoking ( Bosher of "
30416	30420	30325	30325	he	109	" and Peebles of "
30423	30770	30325	30325	he	109	" both pretty well known up there for general rowdiness , you know — great pals of mine ! ) and , just as we turned the corner , who should we see coming straight down on us but a Proctor with his bull - dogs ( not dogs , you know , but the strongest ' gyps ' in college ) . Bosher said , ' Let 's cut it ! ' and he and Peebles bolted . ( They were neither of them funks , of course , but they lost their heads . ) I went calmly on , smoking my cigar as if nothing was the matter . That put the Proctor in a bait , I can tell you ! He came fuming up to me . ' What do you mean , sir , ' says he , quite pale with anger ( he was a great bull - headed fellow , one of the strongest dons of his year , that 's why they made him a Proctor)—'what do you mean by breaking the University Statutes in this way ? ' ' It is a fine evening , ' said I ( I was determined to keep cool ) . ' Do you mean to insult me ? ' said he . ' No , old boy , ' said I , ' I do n't ; have a cigar ? ' He could n't stand that , so he called up his bull - dogs . ' I give him in charge ! ' he screamed out . ' I 'll have him sent down ! ' ' I 'll send you down first , ' said I , and I just gave him a push — I never meant to hurt the fellow — and over he went . I rolled over a bull - dog to keep him company , and , as the other fellow did n't want any more and stood aside to let me pass , I finished my stroll and my cigar . "
30771	30779	30781	30783	a small boy	801	" Was the Proctor hurt , sir ? "
30788	30798	30800	30801	Mr. Tinkler	109	" More frightened than hurt , I always said , "
30804	30844	30800	30801	Mr. Tinkler	109	" but somehow he never would proctorise any more — it spoilt his nerve . He was a good deal chaffed about it , but of course no one ever knew I 'd had anything to do with it ! "
31113	31117	31118	31118	He	248	" All in ! "
31266	31276	31278	31278	Siggers	90	" He 's sent them out for a walk , "
31286	31292	31278	31278	Siggers	90	" It 's a row ! "
31784	31797	31799	31800	the Doctor	248	" Ever since I have devoted myself to the cause of tuition , "
31802	31853	31799	31800	the Doctor	248	" I have made it my object to provide boys under my roof with fare so abundant and so palatable that they should have no excuse for obtaining extraneous luxuries . I have presided myself at their meals , I have superintended their very sports with a fatherly eye — — "
31881	31889	31891	31891	Paul	57	" He 's wandering from the point , "
31897	31963	31891	31891	Paul	57	" I have done all this on one understanding — that the robustness of your constitutions , acquired by the plain , simple , but abundant regimen of my table , shall not be tampered with by the indulgence in any of the pampering products of confectionery . They are absolutely and unconditionally prohibited — as every boy who hears me now knows perfectly well ! "
31966	31988	31891	31891	Paul	57	" ( here he began gradually to relax his self - restraint and lash himself into a frenzy of indignation ) , "
32064	32098	32099	32099	I	0	" At this every boy , beginning to see the tendency of his denunciations , tried hard to assume an air of conscious innocence and grieved interest , the majority achieving conspicuous failure . "
32106	32111	32099	32099	I	0	" said Dr. Grimstone , "
32175	32213	32216	32217	the being	835	" To this invitation , which indeed resembled that of the duck - destroying Mrs. Bond , no one made any response . They had grown too wary , and now preferred to play a waiting game . "
32246	32285	32287	32287	I	0	" thundered the Doctor , now warmed to his theme . But the being declined from a feeling of modesty , and a faint hope that somebody else might , after all , be the person aimed at . "
32291	32296	32287	32287	I	0	" stormed Dr. Grimstone ; "
32303	32315	32316	32316	Me	0	" Coggs half rose in a limp manner , whimpering feebly , "

32356	32396	32399	32399	Coggs	89	" Here , needless to say , the whole school glared at poor Coggs with as much virtuous indignation as they could summon up at such short notice ; for contempt is very infectious when communicated from high quarters . "
32401	32413	32415	32415	you	89	" said the Doctor , with a slow and withering scorn , "
32543	32581	32540	32540	his	848	" All of which simply meant that the Doctor , having once had a small boy taken seriously ill from the effects of overeating himself , was naturally anxious to avoid such an inconvenience for the future . "
32591	32596	32588	32589	a youth	849	" continued the Doctor , "
32657	32714	32652	32652	your	87	" Mr. Bultitude was too angry and disappointed to speak . He had thought his path was going to be made smooth , and now all this ridiculous fuss was being made about a few peppermint lozenges . He wished he had never mentioned them . It was not the last time he breathed that wish . "
32721	32733	32717	32717	you	87	" said the Doctor , suddenly producing a lithe brown cane , "
32743	32772	32652	32652	your	87	" Coggs stared idiotically and protested , but after a short and painful scene , was sent off up to his bedroom , yelping like a kicked puppy . "
32777	32787	32652	32652	your	87	" said the Doctor , now almost calm again . "
32818	32838	32810	32810	you	87	" ( A thrill and murmur , expressive of intense horror and scorn , went round the benches . ) "
32852	32861	32839	32839	You	87	" ( Again a murmur of assent . ) "
32906	32995	32891	32891	his	850	" There was a general fall of jaws at this very unexpected conclusion ; but contriving to overcome their dismay , they went outside and down through the playground into the box - room , Paul amongst the rest , and amidst universal confusion , everyone opened his box , and , with a consideration especially laudable in heedless boyhood , thoughtfully and carefully removed from it all such dainties as might be calculated to shock or pain their preceptor . Mr. Bultitude found a key which was labelled "
32998	33109	33110	33110	Hallo	114	" and began to open a box which bore Dick 's initials cut upon the lid ; without any apprehensions , however , for he had given too strict orders to his daughter , to fear that any luxuries would be concealed there . But no sooner had he raised the lid than he staggered back with disgust . It was crammed with cakes , butterscotch , hardbake , pots of jam , and even a bottle of ginger wine — enough to compromise a chameleon ! He set himself to pitch them all out as soon as possible with feverish haste , but Tipping was too quick for him . "

33200	33201	33194	33194	you	852	" "
33212	33228	33203	33203	you	0	" said Paul angrily , for he did not like to be called a humbug . "
33237	33241	33203	33203	you	0	" jeered Tipping ; "
33253	33254	33242	33242	I	0	" "
33263	33267	33259	33259	your	0	" growled Paul . "
33289	33290	33279	33279	my	0	" "
33300	33305	33292	33292	you	0	" said Tipping impatiently . "

33335	33340	33331	33331	you	0	" said Tipping easily , "
33366	33366	33359	33359	I	0	"
33410	33417	33418	33418	he	90	" As the box is heavy , "
33426	33436	33438	33438	he	90	" I 'll carry it up for you myself , "
33456	33469	33470	33470	he	90	" Bultitude 's box was rather too heavy for him , sir , "
33495	33505	33478	33479	Dr. Grimstone	62	" liked to see the strong assisting the weak . "
33655	33661	33662	33662	he	248	" Well , my boy , "
33668	33682	33662	33662	he	248	" I 'm not afraid of anything wrong here , at any rate . "
33713	33722	33724	33725	the Doctor	248	" Eh ? Come , open the box , "
33731	33753	33754	33754	He	248	" What are you fumbling at it for in this — this highly suspicious manner ? I 'll open it myself . "
33782	33785	33786	33786	he	248	" Hardbake ! "
33789	33850	33786	33786	he	248	" wine , pots of strawberry jam ! Oh , Bultitude , this is a revelation indeed ! So I have nourished one more viper in my bosom , have I ? A crawling reptile which curries favour by denouncing the very crime it conceals in its playbox ! Bultitude , I was not prepared for such duplicity as this ! "
33851	33862	33866	33866	Paul	57	" I — I swear I never put them in ! "
33868	33904	33866	33866	Paul	57	" I — I never touch such things : they would bring on my gout in half - an - hour . It 's ridiculous to punish me . I never knew they were there ! "
33905	33918	33920	33921	the Doctor	248	" Then why were you so anxious to avoid opening the box ? "
33923	33952	33953	33953	Paul	57	" No , sir , you 're too ingenious ; your guilt is clear . Go to your dormitory , and wait there till I come to you ! "
33995	34001	34002	34002	he	57	" I shall be caned , "
34014	34029	34030	34030	He	57	" I know I shall be caned ! What on earth shall I do ? "
34065	34073	34074	34074	he	57	" What do you want up here ? "
34078	34086	34074	34074	he	57	" Go away , ca n't you ! "
34087	34095	34097	34097	Paul	57	" I wish I could go away , "
34100	34112	34113	34113	he	57	" but I'm — hum — I'm sent up here too , "
34121	34124	34126	34126	Coggs	89	" What ! "
34136	34151	34126	34126	Coggs	89	" you do n't mean to say you 're going to catch it too ? "
34152	34162	34164	34165	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I've — ah — every reason to fear , "
34168	34185	34164	34165	Mr. Bultitude	57	" that I am indeed going to ' catch it , ' as you call it . "
34186	34189	34191	34191	Coggs	89	" Hooray ! "
34194	34241	34191	34191	Coggs	89	" I do n't care now . And I 'll have some revenge on my own account as well . I do n't mind an extra licking , and you 're in for one as it is . Will you stand up to me or not ? "
34242	34249	34251	34251	Paul	57	" I do n't understand you , "
34253	34270	34271	34271	he	57	" Do n't come so near . Keep off , you young demon , will you ! "
34294	34306	34307	34307	he	89	" There , do n't be annoyed , my good boy , "
34318	34340	34307	34307	he	89	" It was a misunderstanding . I wish you no harm . There , my dear young friend ! Do n't ! "
34342	34346	34373	34373	his	89	" dear young friend "
34362	34369	34370	34370	he	89	" When I get at you , "
34382	34394	34370	34370	he	89	" I 'll jolly well teach you to sneak of me ! "
34395	34398	34399	34399	Paul	57	" Murder ! "
34410	34422	34423	34423	They	877	" Unless help comes this young fiend will have my blood ! "
34476	34517	34471	34471	himself	57	" I subscribe to Lucian : ' tis an elegant thing which cheareth up the mind , exerciseth the body , delights the spectators , which teacheth many comely gestures , equally affecting the ears , eyes and soul itself . "—Burton
34522	34527	34529	34530	Dr. Grimstone	62	" What is this ? "
34594	34628	34576	34576	Coggs	89	" Will one of you be good enough to explain how you come to be found struggling in this unseemly manner ? I sent you up here to meditate on your past behaviour . "
34629	34640	34642	34642	Paul	57	" I should be most happy to meditate , sir , "
34656	34709	34642	34642	Paul	57	" if that — that bloodthirsty young ruffian there would allow me to do so . I am going about in bodily fear of him , Dr. Grimstone . I want him bound over to keep the peace . I decline to be left alone with him — he 's not safe ! "
34710	34758	34576	34576	Coggs	89	" Is that so , Coggs ? Are you mean and base enough to take this cowardly revenge on a boy who has had the moral courage to expose your deceit — for your ultimate good — a boy who is unable to defend himself against you ? "
34759	34769	34771	34771	Coggs	89	" He can fight when he chooses , sir , "
34773	34783	34771	34771	Coggs	89	" he blacked my eye last term , sir ! "
34784	34789	34791	34791	Paul	57	" I assure you , "
34800	34845	34791	34791	Paul	57	" that I never blacked anybody 's eye in the whole course of my life . I am not — ah — a pugnacious man . My age , and — hum — my position , ought to protect me from these scandals — — "
34846	34856	34858	34859	Dr. Grimstone	62	" You 've come back this year , sir , "
34861	34908	34858	34859	Dr. Grimstone	62	" with a very odd way of talking of yourself — an exceedingly odd way . Unless I see you abandoning it , and behaving like a reasonable boy again , I shall be forced to conclude you intend some disrespect and open defiance by it . "
34909	34924	34926	34926	Paul	57	" If you would allow me an opportunity of explaining my position , sir , "
34928	34989	34926	34926	Paul	57	" I would undertake to clear your mind directly of such a monstrous idea . I am trying to assert my rights , Dr. Grimstone — my rights as a citizen , as a householder ! This is no place for me , and I appeal to you to set me free . If you only knew one tenth — — "
34990	34999	35001	35002	the Doctor	248	" Let us understand one another , Bultitude , "
35004	35118	35001	35002	the Doctor	248	" You may think it an excellent joke to talk nonsense to me like this . But let me tell you there is a point where a jest becomes an insult . I 've spared you hitherto out of consideration for the feelings of your excellent father , who is so anxious that you should become an object of pride and credit to him ; but if you dare to treat me to any more of this bombast about ' explaining your rights , ' you will force me to exercise one of mine — the right to inflict corporal punishment , sir — which you have just seen in operation upon another . "
35119	35122	35124	35125	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Oh ! "
35139	35149	35151	35152	the Doctor	248	" As for those illicit luxuries in your playbox , "
35154	35198	35151	35152	the Doctor	248	" the fact that you brought the box up as it was is in your favour ; and I am inclined on reflection to overlook the affair , if you can assure me that you were no party to their being put there ? "
35199	35204	35206	35206	Paul	57	" On the contrary , "
35208	35250	35206	35206	Paul	57	" I gave the strictest orders that there was to be no such useless extravagance . I objected to have the kitchen and housekeeper 's room ransacked to make a set of rascally boys ill for a fortnight at my expense ! "
35357	35367	35369	35370	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Take your Livy and Latin Primer , Bultitude , "
35373	35378	35369	35370	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" and sit down . "
35513	35518	35519	35519	he	57	" At dinner time , "
35523	35542	35519	35519	he	57	" I will insist on speaking out , but just now it is simply prudent to humour them . "
35833	35837	35860	35860	he	57	" whipping - boy "
36118	36134	36089	36099	one small smug - faced boy about half - way up	916	" I know , sir . Let me tell him . Ask me , sir ! "
36456	36459	36461	36462	the Doctor	248	" chevy , "
36551	36561	36562	36562	he	57	" I 've put him in a good temper , "
36566	36632	36562	36562	he	57	" if I can only keep him in one till the evening , I really think I might be able to go up and tell him what a ridiculous mess I 've got into . Why should I care , after all ? At least I 've done nothing to be ashamed of . It 's an accident that might have happened to any man ! "
37200	37206	37207	37207	he	57	" If I were there , "
37210	37340	37207	37207	he	57	" I should have been run out and flogged long ago ! How angry those stupid young idiots are making him ! How can I go up and speak to him when he 's like that ? And yet I must . I 'm sitting on dynamite as it is . The very first time they want me to answer any questions from some of their books , I shall be ruined ! Why was n't I better educated when I was a boy , or why did n't I make a better use of my opportunities ! It will be a bitter thing if they thrash me for not knowing as much as Dick . Grimstone 's coming this way now ; it 's all over with me ! "
37400	37411	37393	37393	he	248	" Who were the boys who learnt dancing last term ? "
37428	37490	37424	37425	Dr. Grimstone	62	" Mr. Burdekin was unable to give you the last lesson of his course last term , and has arranged to take you to - day , as he will be in the neighbourhood . So be off at once to Mrs. Grimstone and change your shoes . Bultitude , you learnt last term , too . Go with the others . "
37653	37660	37661	37661	he	57	" I suppose I must go , "
37664	37691	37661	37661	he	57	" I need n't dance . Have n't danced since I was a young man . But I ca n't afford to offend him just now . "
37767	37771	37806	37806	Biddlecomb	92	" Dining Hall , "
38083	38086	38087	38087	she	110	" Dick , "
38090	38100	38087	38087	she	110	" you 're not sulky still , are you ? "
38132	38155	38156	38156	he	71	" I do wish you would n't do this sort of thing in public . You 'll compromise me , you know ! "
38188	38196	38197	38197	she	110	" You did n't mind it once , "
38200	38285	38177	38177	she	110	" I thought you might want to dance with me . You liked to last term . But I 'm sure I do n't care if you choose to be disagreeable . Go and dance with Mary Mutlow if you want to , though you did say she danced like a pair of compasses , and I shall tell her you said so , too . And you know you 're not a good dancer yourself . Are you going to dance with Mary ? "
38289	38297	38298	38298	he	57	" I tell you I never dance , "
38301	38336	38298	38298	he	57	" I ca n't dance any more than a lamp - post . You do n't seem an ill - natured little girl , but why on earth ca n't you let me alone ? "
38342	38350	38351	38351	she	110	" You 're a nasty sulky boy , "
38373	38400	38351	38351	she	110	" I 'll never speak to you or look at you again . You 're the most horrid boy in the school — and the ugliest ! "
38545	38660	38672	38672	he	977	" Good afternoon , madam . Young ladies , I trust I find you well . ( The curtsey just a leetle lower , Miss Mutlow — the right foot less drawn back . Beautiful ! Feet closer at the recovery . Perfect ! ) Young gentlemen , good evening . Take your usual places , please , all of you , for our preliminary exercises . Now , the chassée round the room . Will you lead off , please , Dummer ; the hands just lightly touching the shoulders , the head thrown negligently back to balance the figure ; the whole deportment easy , but not careless . Now , please ! "
38721	38731	38732	38732	he	71	" If my clerks were to see me now ! "
38752	38756	38741	38742	Mr. Burdekin	119	" The Lancers . "
38757	38760	38762	38763	Mr. Burdekin	119	" Bultitude , "
38765	38774	38762	38763	Mr. Burdekin	119	" you will take Miss Mutlow , please . "
38775	38779	38781	38781	Paul	57	" Thank you , "
38783	38793	38781	38781	Paul	57	" but — ah — I do n't dance . "
38794	38827	38828	38828	Paul	57	" Nonsense , nonsense , sir , you are one of my most promising pupils . You must n't tell me that . Not another word ! Come , select your partners . "
38893	38967	38888	38889	Mr. Burdekin	119	" Tops advance , retire and cross . Balance at corners . ( Very nice , Miss Grimstone ! ) More ' abandon , ' Chawner ! Lift the feet more from the floor . Not so high as that ! Oh , dear me ! that last figure over again . And slide the feet , oh , slide the feet ! ( Bultitude , you 're leaving out all the steps ! "
39081	39085	39087	39087	Paul	57	" I suppose , "
39099	39146	39087	39087	Paul	57	" if Dick were ever to hear of this , he 'd think it funny . Oh , if I ever get the upper hand of him again——. How much longer , I wonder , shall I have to play the fool to this infernal fiddle ! "
39171	39235	39166	39167	Mr. Burdekin	119	" I wonder now if we have forgotten our sailor 's hornpipe . Perhaps Bultitude will prove the contrary . If I remember right , he used to perform it with singular correctness . And , let me tell you , there are a great number of spurious hornpipe steps in circulation . Come , sir , oblige me by dancing it alone ! "
39280	39301	39277	39277	he	57	" I shall do nothing of the sort . I 've had quite enough of this — ah — tomfoolery ! "
39302	39362	39451	39451	he	57	" That is a very impolite manner of declining , Bultitude ; highly discourteous and unpolished . I must insist now — really , as a personal matter — upon your going through the sailor 's hornpipe . Come , you wo n't make a scene , I 'm sure . You 'll oblige me , as a gentleman ? "
39363	39371	39373	39374	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I tell you I ca n't ! "
39377	39399	39373	39374	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I never did such a thing in my life ; it would be enough to kill me at my age ! "
39400	39419	39451	39451	he	57	" This is untrue , sir . Do you mean to say you will not dance the hornpipe ? "
39420	39423	39425	39425	Paul	57	" No , "
39427	39436	39425	39425	Paul	57	" I 'll be damned if I do ! "
39485	39534	39480	39481	Mr. Burdekin	119	" After that disgraceful language , sir , in the presence of the fairer sex , I have no more to do with you . You will have the goodness to stand in the centre of that form . Gentlemen , select your partners for the Highland schottische ! "
39785	39788	39802	39802	he	57	" golden , "

39805	39818	39802	39802	he	57	" And pray what may you be doing up there , sir ? "
39819	39828	39830	39831	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Upon my soul I ca n't say , "
39834	39846	39830	39831	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Ask that gentleman there with the fiddle — he knows . "
39883	39902	39903	39903	he	119	" Bultitude was a little inattentive and , I may say , wanting in respect , Dr. Grimstone , "
39917	39929	39903	39903	he	119	" so I ventured to place him there as a punishment . "
39930	39937	39939	39940	the Doctor	248	" Quite right , Mr. Burdekin , "
39942	40022	39939	39940	the Doctor	248	" quite right . I am sorry that any boy of mine should have caused you to do so . You are again beginning your career of disorder and rebellion , are you , sir ? Go up into the schoolroom at once , and write a dozen copies before tea - time ! A very little more eccentricity and insubordination from you , Bultitude , and you will reap a full reward — a full reward , sir ! "

41397	41437	41394	41394	he	57	" why do n't you confide in me ? Do you think I 'm blind to what has happened to you ? I can see the change in you — if others can not . Why not trust me ? "
41504	41512	41513	41513	he	1032	" Do you mean to say really , "
41528	41541	41513	41513	he	1032	" that you — see — the — a — the difference ? "
41542	41549	41551	41552	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I saw it almost directly , "
41558	41566	41568	41568	Paul	57	" That 's the most extraordinary thing , "
41570	41598	41568	41568	Paul	57	" and yet it ought to be evident enough , to be sure . But no , you ca n't have guessed the real state of things ! "
41599	41643	41513	41513	he	1032	" Listen , and stop me if I 'm wrong . Within the last few days a great change has been at work within you . You are not the idle , thoughtless , mischievous boy who left here for his holidays — — "
41644	41647	41649	41649	Paul	57	" No , "
41651	41659	41649	41649	Paul	57	" I 'll swear I 'm not ! "
41660	41692	41513	41513	he	1032	" There is no occasion for such strong expressions . But , at all events , you come back here an altogether different being . Am I right in saying so ? "
41693	41696	41698	41698	Paul	57	" Perfectly , "
41707	41742	41698	41698	Paul	57	" perfectly . You 're a very intelligent young man , sir . Shake hands . Why , I should n't be surprised , after that , if you knew how it all happened ? "
41743	41747	41749	41750	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" That too , "
41753	41769	41749	41750	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I can guess . It arose , I doubt not , in a wish ? "

41797	41838	41698	41698	Paul	57	" Do n't say ' by Gad , ' Bultitude ; it 's inconsistent . It began , I was saying , in a wish , half unconscious perhaps , to be something other than what you had been — — "
41839	41845	41847	41848	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I was a fool , "
41850	41860	41847	41848	Mr. Bultitude	57	" yes , that was the way it began ! "
41861	41884	41698	41698	Paul	57	" Then insensibly the wish worked a gradual transformation in your nature ( you are old enough to follow me ? ) . "

41907	41914	41915	41915	he	57	" Hardly gradual I should say , "
41919	41938	41915	41915	he	57	" But go on , sir , pray go on . I see you know all about it . "
41939	41994	41698	41698	Paul	57	" At first the other part of you struggled against the new feelings . You strove to forget them — you even tried to resume your old habits , your former way of life — but to no purpose ; and when you came here , you found no fellowship amongst your companions — — "
41995	42002	42004	42004	Paul	57	" Quite out of the question ! "
42006	42015	42004	42004	Paul	57	" Their pleasures give you no delight — — "
42016	42021	41698	41698	Paul	57	" Not a bit ! "
42022	42079	41698	41698	Paul	57	" They , on their side , perhaps misunderstand your lack of interest in their pursuits . They can not see — how should they?—that you have altered your mode of life , and when they catch the difference between you and the Richard Bultitude they knew , why , they are apt to resent it . "
42080	42084	41698	41698	Paul	57	" They are , "
42089	42116	42086	42087	Mr. Bultitude	87	" they resent it in a confounded disagreeable way , you know . Why , I assure you , that only last night I was — — "
42117	42120	42122	42123	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Hush , "
42130	42146	42122	42123	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" complaints are unmanly . But I see you wonder at my knowing all this ? "
42147	42150	42152	42152	Paul	57	" Well , "
42154	42160	42152	42152	Paul	57	" I am rather surprised . "
42161	42179	42122	42123	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" What would you say if I told you I had undergone it myself in my time ? "
42180	42198	42200	42200	Paul	57	" You do n't mean to tell me there are two Garudâ Stones in this miserable world ! "
42205	42251	42122	42123	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I do n't know what you mean now , but I can say with truth that I too have had my experiences — my trials . Months ago , from certain signs , I noticed , I foresaw that this was coming upon you . "
42252	42255	42257	42258	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Then , "
42260	42295	42257	42258	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I think , in common decency , you might have warned me . A post - card would have done it . I should have been better prepared to meet this , then ! "
42296	42326	42122	42123	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" It would have been worse than fruitless to attempt to hurry on the crisis . It might have even prevented what I fondly hoped would come to pass . "
42327	42331	42333	42333	Paul	57	" Fondly hoped ! "
42335	42345	42333	42333	Paul	57	" upon my word you speak plainly , sir . "
42346	42349	42351	42352	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Yes , "
42354	42389	42351	42352	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" You see I knew the Dick Bultitude that was , so well ; he was frolicksome , impulsive , mischievous even , but under it all there lay a nature of sterling worth . "
42390	42394	42396	42396	Paul	57	" Sterling worth ! "
42398	42424	42396	42396	Paul	57	" A scoundrel , I tell you , a heartless , selfish young scoundrel . Call things by their right names , if you please . "
42425	42430	42432	42433	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" No , no , "
42435	42453	42432	42433	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" this extreme self - depreciation is morbid , very morbid . There was no actual vice . "
42454	42517	42396	42396	Paul	57	" No actual vice ! Why , God bless my soul , do you call ingratitude — the basest , most unfilial , most treacherous ingratitude — no vice , sir ? You may be a very excellent young man , but if you gloss over things in that fashion , your moral sense must be perverted , sir — strangely perverted . "
42518	42529	42531	42532	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" There were faults on both sides , I fear , "
42547	42669	42396	42396	Paul	57	" I have heard something of what you had to bear with . On the one hand , a father , undemonstrative , stern , easily provoked ; on the other , a son , thoughtless , forgetful , and at times it may be even wilful . But you are too sensitive ; you think too much of what seems to me a not unnatural ( although of course improper ) protest against coldness and injustice . I should be the last to encourage a child against a parent , but , to comfort your self - reproach , I think it right to assure you that , in my judgment , the outburst you refer to was very excusable . "
42670	42673	42675	42675	Paul	57	" Oh , "
42677	42707	42675	42675	Paul	57	" you do ? You call that comfort ? Excusable ! Why , what the dooce do you mean , sir ? You 're taking the other side now ! "
42708	42719	42722	42723	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" This is not the language of penitence , Bultitude , "
42729	42741	42396	42396	Paul	57	" Remember , you have put off the Old Man now ! "
42742	42751	42753	42753	Paul	57	" I 'm not likely to forget that , "
42755	42770	42396	42396	Paul	57	" I only wish I could see my way to putting him on again ! "
42771	42781	42783	42784	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" You want to be your old self again ? "
42786	42794	42796	42796	Paul	57	" Why , of course I do , "
42799	42806	42396	42396	Paul	57	" I 'm not an idiot ! "
42807	42817	42819	42822	the other with reproach	1035	" You are weary of the struggle so soon ? "
42824	42857	42865	42866	Mr. Blinkhorn—"I	128	" Weary ? I tell you I 'm sick of it ! If I had only known what was in store for me before I had made such a fool of myself ! "
42858	42863	42865	42866	Mr. Blinkhorn—"I	128	" This is horrible ! "
42866	42874	42865	42866	Mr. Blinkhorn—"I	128	Blinkhorn—"I ought not to listen to you . "
42875	42880	42882	42882	Paul	57	" But you must , "
42884	42921	42882	42882	Paul	57	" I tell you I ca n't stand it any longer . I 'm not fit for it at my age . You must see that yourself , and you must make Grimstone see it too ! "
42922	42925	42927	42928	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Never ! "
42931	43019	42927	42928	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Nor do I see how that would help you . I will not let you go back in this deplorable way . You must nerve yourself to go on now in the path you have chosen ; you must force your schoolfellows to love and respect you in your new character . Come , take courage ! After all , in spite of your altered life , there is no reason why you should not be a frank and happy - hearted boy , you know . "
43020	43029	43031	43031	Paul	57	" A frank and happy - hearted fiddlestick ! "
43043	43100	43034	43034	he	57	" do n't talk rubbish , sir ! I thought you were going to show me some way out of all this , and instead of that , knowing the shameful way I 've been treated , you can stand there and calmly recommend me to stay on here and be happy - hearted and frank ! "
43101	43162	43200	43200	he	57	" You must be calm , Bultitude , or I shall leave you . Listen to reason . You are here for your good . Youth , it has been beautifully said , is the springtime of life . Though you may not believe it , you will never be happier than you are now . Our schooldays are — — "
43193	43199	43200	43200	he	57	" This is too much ! "
43201	43252	43200	43200	he	57	cried—"you shall not palm off that miserable rubbish on me . I see through it . It 's a plot to keep me here , and you 're in it . It 's false imprisonment , and I 'll write to the Times . I 'll expose the whole thing ! "
43253	43260	43262	43263	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" This violence is only ridiculous , "
43265	43350	43262	43263	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" If I were not too pained by it , I should feel it my duty to report your language to the Doctor . As it is , you have bitterly disappointed me ; I ca n't understand it at all . You seemed so subdued , so softened lately . But until you come to me and say you regret this , I must decline to have anything more to say to you . Take your book and sit down in your place ! "

I saw a leedle gommon dirty boy with a tall round hat on him , and he stand in a side street right out in de road , and he take off his tall round hat , and he put it on de ground , and he stand still and look zo at it . So I shtop too , to see vat he vould do next . And bresently he take out a large sheet of baper and tear it in four pieces very garefully , and stick zem round de tall round hat , and put it on his head again , and zen he set it down on de grount and look at it vonce more , and all de time he never speak von vort . And I look and look and vonder vat he would do next . And a great growd of beoples com , and zey look and vonder too . And zen all at once de leedle dirty boy he take out all de paper and put on de hat , and he valk avay , laughing altogetter foolishly at zomzing I did not understand at all .

And anozer man vith anozer kind heart , he gom up directly and had not seen de cat overrun , but he see de first man stamping and he knock him down for ill - treating animals ; it was quite gurious to see ; till de policeman arrest dem both for fighting . Goggs , degline ' Katze , ' and gif me ze berfect and bast barticiple of ' kampfen , ' to fight . "

46685	46722	46630	46630	Paul	57	" Why , you go about strutting and swelling just like he did when he came about sending you here . I say , do you know what Mums said about him after he went away ? "
46723	46726	46728	46728	Paul	57	" No , "
46730	46752	46728	46728	Paul	57	" your mother struck me as a very sensible and agreeable woman — if I may say so to her son . "
46753	46793	46630	46630	Paul	57	" Well , Mums said your governor seemed to leave you here just like they leave umbrellas at picture galleries , and she believed he had a large - sized money - bag inside him instead of a heart . "
46794	46797	46799	46799	Paul	57	" Oh ! "
46817	46850	46809	46810	Mrs. Grimstone	100	" your mother said that , did she ? Vastly entertaining to be sure — ha , ha ! He would be pleased to know she thought that , I 'm sure . "

46865	46879	46863	46863	Tom	95	" he is an awful brute to you though , is n't he ? "
46880	46883	46885	46886	Mr. Bultitude	57	" If , "
46888	46919	46885	46886	Mr. Bultitude	57	" slaving from morning till night to provide education and luxury for a thankless brood of unprofitable young vipers is ' being a brute , ' I suppose he is . "
46920	46931	46933	46933	Tom	95	" Why , you 're sticking up for him now ! "
46935	46962	46933	46933	Tom	95	" I thought he was so strict with you . Would n't let you have any fun at home , and never took you to pantomimes ? "
46963	47045	46863	46863	Tom	95	" And why should he , sir , why should he ? Tell me that . Tell me why a man is to be hunted out of his comfortable chair after a well - earned dinner , to go and sit in a hot theatre and a thorough draught , yawning at the miserable drivel managers choose to call a pantomime ? Now in my young days there were pantomimes . I tell you , sir , I 've seen — — "
47046	47059	47061	47061	Tom	95	" Oh , if you 're satisfied , I do n't care ! "
47071	47107	46863	46863	Tom	95	" If you choose to come back and play the corker like this , it 's your look - out . Only , if you knew what Sproule major said about you just now — — "

47120	47127	47118	47118	Paul	57	" it does n't concern me . "
47128	47206	46863	46863	Tom	95	" Perhaps it does n't concern you what pa thinks either ? Dad told Mums last night that he was altogether at a loss to know how to deal with you , you had come back so queer and unruly . And he said , let me see , oh , he said that ' if he did n't see an alteration very soon he should resort to more drastic measures'—drastic measures is Latin for a whopping . "
47207	47211	47213	47213	Paul	57	" Good gracious ! "
47215	47257	47213	47213	Paul	57	" I have n't a moment to lose ! he might ' resort to drastic measures ' this very evening . I ca n't change my nature at my time of life . I must run for it , and soon . "
47265	47315	47259	47259	he	57	" Can you tell me , my — my young friend , if , supposing a boy were to ask to leave the field — saying for instance that he was not well and thought he should be better at home — whether he would be allowed to go ? "

47326	47353	47324	47324	Tom	95	" you ought to know that by this time . You 've only to ask Blinkhorn or Tinkler ; they 'll let you go right enough . "
47379	47383	47384	47384	he	57	" Thank you , "
47391	47418	47384	47384	he	57	" thank you . I 'm really uncommonly obliged to you . You 're a very intelligent boy . I should like to give you sixpence . "

47728	47764	47726	47726	Tipping	71	" he used to play up decently . Look here , you young beggar , you 're on my side , and if you do n't play up it will be the worse for you ! "

48290	48314	48283	48283	he	109	" If you please , sir , will you allow me to go home ? I'm — I'm not feeling at all well . "
48315	48326	48328	48329	Mr. Tinkler	109	" Not well ! What 's the matter with you ? "
48354	48361	48362	48362	he	57	" A slight touch of liver , "
48367	48375	48362	48362	he	57	" It takes me after meals sometimes . "
48376	48379	48381	48382	Mr. Tinkler	109	" Liver ! "
48384	48417	48381	48382	Mr. Tinkler	109	" you 've no right to such a thing at your age ; it 's all nonsense , you know . Run in and play , that 'll set you up again . "
48418	48425	48427	48427	Paul	57	" It 's fatal , sir , "
48429	48457	48427	48427	Paul	57	" My doctor expressly warned me against taking any violent exercise soon after luncheon . If you knew what liver is , you would n't say so ! "
48487	48507	48427	48427	Paul	57	" Oh , well , do n't bother me ; I daresay it 's all right . Cut along ! "
48558	48565	48566	48566	he	57	" I 've managed that excellently , "
48582	48598	48566	48566	he	57	" Not the slightest hitch . I defy the fates themselves to stop me now ! "
48686	48695	48696	48696	he	86	" There you are , Bultitude , then , "
48703	48708	48696	48696	he	86	" I want you . "
48709	48715	48717	48717	Paul	57	" I ca n't stop , "
48719	48729	48717	48717	Paul	57	" I 'm in a hurry — another time . "
48730	48737	48739	48740	little Porter	86	" Another time wo n't do , "
48750	48756	48739	48740	little Porter	86	" I want that rabbit . "
48825	48859	48817	48817	He	57	" I tell you , my good boy , I have n't such a thing about me . I have n't indeed . I do n't even know what you 're talking about . "
48865	48872	48873	48873	he	86	" I say , you fellows , "
48877	48900	48873	48873	he	86	" come here ! Do make Bultitude give me my rabbit . He says he does n't know anything about it now ! "
48915	48921	48922	48924	some of them	1146	" What 's the matter ? "
48927	48930	48932	48932	Porter	86	" Why , "
48934	48968	48932	48932	Porter	86	" he promised to bring me back a rabbit this term , and now he pretends he does not know anything about it . Make him say what he 's done with it ! "
48988	48991	48992	48992	he	57	" Gad ! "
49000	49036	48992	48992	he	57	" so I did — to be sure , a rabbit , of course , how could I forget it ? It's — it 's a splendid rabbit . I 'll go and fetch it ! "
49037	49041	49043	49043	Porter	86	" Will you ? "
49048	49055	49043	49043	Porter	86	" Where is it , then ? "
49056	49059	49061	49061	Paul	57	" Where ? "
49071	49086	49061	49061	Paul	57	" Why , in my playbox to be sure ; where should it be ? "
49087	49098	49043	49043	Porter	86	" It is n't in your playbox , I know , "
49103	49148	49043	49043	Porter	86	" because I saw it turned out yesterday and there was no rabbit then . Besides , how could a rabbit live in a playbox ? He 's telling lies . I can see it by his face . He has n't any rabbit ! "
49149	49156	49158	49159	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Of course I have n't ! "
49161	49210	49158	49159	Mr. Bultitude	57	" How should I ? I 'm not a conjurer . It 's not a habit of mine to go about with rabbits concealed on my person . What 's the use of coming to me like this ? It 's absurd , you know ; perfectly absurd ! "
49236	49246	49247	49247	he	57	" What 's the row here , you fellows ? "
49250	49264	49247	49247	he	57	" Bultitude again , of course . What 's he been doing now ? "
49265	49278	49280	49281	little Porter	86	" He had a rabbit he said he was keeping for me , "
49283	49302	49280	49281	little Porter	86	" and now he wo n't give it up or tell me what he 's done with it . "
49303	49316	49318	49323	one or two new - comers	1149	" He has some mice he ought to give us , too , "
49400	49407	49408	49408	he	90	" Keep that for the present , "
49411	49448	49449	49449	He	57	" I say , we ought to have a regular trial over this , and get at the truth of it properly . Let 's fetch him along to the goal - posts and judge him ! "
49592	49601	49602	49602	he	90	" You chaps had better all be jurymen , "
49605	49621	49622	49622	he	90	" I 'll be judge , and unless he makes a clean breast of it , "
49628	49641	49622	49622	he	90	" the court will jolly well punch his ugly young head off . "
49752	49797	49798	49798	he	90	" What are you all doing here ? Why do n't you join the game ? I 've come here to play football with you , and how can I do it if you all slink off and leave me to play by myself ? "
49803	49808	49810	49810	Siggers	90	" Please , sir , "
49821	49832	49810	49810	Siggers	90	" it 's a trial , and I 'm judge . "
49833	49838	49839	49841	the whole ring	1156	" Yes , sir , "
49845	49853	49839	49841	the whole ring	1156	" We 're trying Bultitude , sir . "
49886	49894	49896	49897	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" This is childish , you know , "
49899	49926	49896	49897	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" and it 's not football . The Doctor will be seriously angry if he comes and sees you trifling here . Let the boy go . "
49927	49939	49941	49943	Tipping and Siggers	90	" But he 's cheated some of the fellows , sir , "
49946	49965	49941	49943	Tipping and Siggers	90	" Well , you 've no right to punish him if he has . Leave him to me . "
49966	49992	49896	49897	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Will you see fair play between them , sir ? He ought n't to be let off without being made to keep his word . "
49993	50004	50006	50007	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" If there is any dispute between you and Bultitude , "
50009	50025	50006	50007	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I have no objection to settle it — provided it is within my province . "
50026	50032	50034	50034	Paul	57	" Settle it without me , "
50037	50049	50034	50034	Paul	57	" I 've leave to go home . I 'm ill . "
50050	50059	50061	50062	the master	893	" Who gave you leave to go home ? "
50064	50074	50076	50076	Paul	57	" That young man over there on the rails , "
50078	50096	50098	50099	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I am the proper person to apply to for leave ; you know that well enough , "
50109	50122	50106	50106	his	108	" Now then , Porter , what is all this business about ? "
50123	50128	50130	50130	Porter	86	" Please , sir , "
50132	50199	50130	50130	Porter	86	" he told me last term he had a lot of rabbits at home , and if I liked he would bring me back a lop - eared one and let me have it cheap , and I gave him two shillings , sir , and sixpence for a hutch to keep it in ; and now he pretends he does n't know anything about it ! "
50342	50348	50349	50349	he	60	" It 's extremely unfortunate , "
50352	50380	50349	50349	he	60	" but the fact is I 'm not in a position to meet this — this sudden call upon me . Some other day , perhaps — — "
50381	50390	50392	50392	Tipping	90	" None of your long words , now , "
50408	50417	50392	50392	Tipping	90	" Why have n't you brought the rabbits ? "
50418	50421	50423	50424	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Yes , "
50426	50454	50423	50424	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Why , having promised to bring the rabbits with you , have n't you kept your word ? You must be able to give some explanation . "
50455	50458	50460	50461	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Because , "
50467	50600	50460	50461	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I — that is my father — found out that my young rascal of a son — I mean his young rascal of a son ( me , you know ) was , contrary to my express orders , keeping a couple of abominable rabbits in his bedroom , and a quantity of filthy little white mice which he tried to train to climb up the banisters . And I kept finding the brutes running about my bath - room , and — well , of course , I put a stop to it ; and — no , what am I saying?—my father , of course , he put a stop to it ; and , in point of fact , had them all drowned in a pail of water . "
50763	50793	50794	50794	they	1165	" Why did you let him do it ? They were ours , not his . What right had your governor to go and drown our rabbits , eh ? "
50798	50802	50804	50804	Paul	57	" What right ? "
50806	50839	50804	50804	Paul	57	" Must n't a man do as he pleases in his own house , then ? I — he was not obliged to see the house overrun with vermin , I suppose ? "
50875	50912	50872	50872	he	108	" But you know the Doctor would never allow animals to be kept in the school , if Bultitude had brought them . The whole thing is against the rules , and I shall not interfere . "
50913	50918	50920	50920	Chawner	101	" Ah , but , "
50922	50945	50872	50872	he	108	" he promised them all to day - boarders . The Doctor could n't object to that , could he , sir ? "
50946	50949	50951	50952	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" True , "
50954	50999	50951	50952	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" true . I was not aware of that . Well then , Bultitude , since you are prevented from performing what you promised to do , I 'm sure you wo n't object to do what is fair and right in the matter ? "
51000	51010	51012	51013	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I do n't think I quite follow you , "
51023	51066	51080	51080	Paul	57	" It 's very simple . You have taken money from these boys , and if you ca n't give them value for it , you ought to return all you took from them . I 'm sure you see that yourself . "
51067	51078	51080	51080	Paul	57	" I do n't admit that I owe them anything , "
51082	51096	51080	51080	Paul	57	" and at all events it is highly inconvenient to pay them now . "
51097	51108	51110	51111	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" If your own sense of honour is n't enough , "
51113	51140	51110	51111	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" I must take the matter into my own hands . Let every boy who has any claim upon him tell me exactly what it is . "
51172	51176	51178	51179	two others	1171	" plum saddle , "
51252	51264	51265	51265	he	57	" Give me any money you have about you , Bultitude , "
51268	51284	51265	51265	he	57	" and I 'll satisfy your debts with it , as far as it goes . "
51291	51294	51295	51295	he	57	" No ! "
51299	51379	51295	51295	he	57	" not that ! Do n't make me do that ! I — I ca n't pay them — not now . They do n't understand . If they only give me time they shall have double their money back — waggon - loads of rabbits , the best rabbits money can buy — if they 'll wait . Tell them to wait . My dear sir , do n't see me wronged ! I wo n't pay now ! "
51380	51387	51389	51390	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" They have waited long enough , "
51392	51398	51389	51390	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" you must pay them . "
51399	51407	51409	51409	Paul	57	" I tell you I wo n't ! "
51411	51436	51409	51409	Paul	57	" do you hear ? Not one sixpence . Oh , if you knew ! That infernal Garudâ Stone ! What fools people are ! "
51583	51588	51590	51590	Chawner	101	" Please , sir , "
51592	51612	51590	51590	Chawner	101	" I can feel something like a purse in his pocket . Shall I take it out , sir ? "
51613	51625	51627	51628	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" As he refuses to act with common honesty — yes , "
51675	51680	51682	51683	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" Now , Bultitude , "
51685	51698	51682	51683	Mr. Blinkhorn	108	" if you really wish to leave the field , you may . "
51877	51887	51894	51895	the Doctor	248	" Cave , you fellows , here 's Grim ! "
52126	52195	52124	52124	he	62	on—"Well done , Mutlow ! Finely played , sir ! Dribble it along now . Ah , you 're afraid of it ! Run into it , sir , run into it ! No running with the ball now , Siggers ; play without those petty meannesses , or leave the game ! There , leave the ball to me , will you — leave it to me ! "
52272	52281	52282	52282	he	62	" For which side did I win that ? "
52298	52302	52303	52303	he	62	" Well then , "
52306	52325	52303	52303	he	62	" you fellows must all back me up , or I shall not play for you any more ; "
52591	52593	52590	52590	he	57	" sugared "
53830	53835	53851	53851	she	64	" Master Richard Bultitude , "
54000	54094	54095	54095	I	0	" My dearest darling Dick,—I hope you have not been expecting a letter from me before this , but I had such lots to tell you that I waited till I had time to tell it all at once . For I have such news for you ! You ca n't think how pleased you will be when you hear it . Where shall I begin ? I hardly know , for it still seems so funny and strange — almost like a dream — only I hope we shall never wake up . "
54184	54241	54170	54170	he	1244	" Do you know , I really think that the real reason he was so cross and sharp with us that last week was because you were going away ; for now the wrench of parting is over , he is quite light - hearted again . You know how he always hates showing his feelings . "
54347	54559	54325	54325	he	1244	" We had such fun the other afternoon ; we played at brigands — papa and all of us . Papa had the upper conservatory for a robber - cave , and stood there keeping guard with your pop - gun ; and he would n't let the servants go by without a kiss , unless they showed a written pass from us ! Miss McFadden called in the middle of it , but she said she would n't come in , as papa seemed to be enjoying himself so . Boaler has given warning , but we ca n't think why . We have been out nearly every evening — once to Hengler 's and once to the Christy Minstrels , and last night to the Pantomime , where papa was so pleased with the clown that he sent round afterwards and asked him to dine here on Sunday , when Sir Benjamin and Lady Bangle and Alderman Fishwick are coming . Wo n't it be jolly to see a clown close to ? Should you think he 'd come in his evening dress ? Miss Mangnall has been given a month 's holiday , because papa did n't like to see us always at lessons . Think of that ! "
54633	54697	54598	54598	I	0	" But that is n't the best of it ; we are going to have the big children 's party after all ! No one but children invited , and everyone to do exactly what they like . I wanted so much to have you home for it , but papa says it would only unsettle you and take you away from your work .
54698	54779	54784	54786	your affectionate sister	1257	" Had Dulcie forgotten you ? I should like to see her so much . Now I really must leave off , as I am going to the Aquarium with papa . Mind you write me as good a letter as this is , if that old Doctor lets you . Minnie and Roly send love and kisses , and papa sends his kind regards , and I am to say he hopes you are settling down steadily to work . "
54788	54792	54784	54786	your affectionate sister	1257	" Barbara Bultitude . "
54793	54854	54598	54598	I	0	" P.S.—I nearly forgot to say that Uncle Duke came the other day and has stayed here ever since . He is going to make papa 's fortune ! I believe by a gold mine he knows about somewhere , and a steam tramway in Lapland . But I do n't like him very much — he is so polite . "
54974	55087	54963	54964	Dr. Grimstone	62	" This conduct at table is disgraceful , sir — perfectly disgraceful — unworthy of a civilised being . I have been a teacher of youth for many years , and never till now did I have the pain of seeing a pupil of mine choke in his breakfast - cup with such deplorable ill - breeding . It 's pure greediness , sir , and you will have the goodness to curb your indecent haste in consuming your food for the future . Your excellent father has frequently complained to me , with tears in his eyes , of the impossibility of teaching you to behave at meals with common propriety ! "
55145	55149	55150	55150	he	57	" Dr. Grimstone ! "
55153	55187	55150	55150	he	57	" never mind my behaviour now . I 've something to tell you . I ca n't bear it any longer . I must go home at once — at once , sir ! "
55282	55287	55289	55290	the Doctor	248	" Now , sir , "
55298	55307	55289	55290	the Doctor	248	" why must you go home at once ? "
55308	55316	55318	55318	Paul	57	" I 've just had a letter , "
55320	55330	55318	55318	Paul	57	" No one ill at home , I hope ? "
55331	55336	55338	55338	Paul	57	" No , no , "
55340	55361	55338	55338	Paul	57	" It 's not that ; it 's worse ! She does n't know what horrible things she tells me ! "
55362	55369	55371	55372	the Doctor	248	" Who is ' she ' ? "
55386	55392	55394	55395	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I decline to say , "
55427	55436	55410	55410	he	57	" But indeed I am wanted most badly ! "
55437	55446	55410	55410	he	57	" What are you wanted for , pray ? "
55447	55450	55452	55452	Paul	57	" Everything ! "
55454	55466	55452	55452	Paul	57	" it 's all going to rack and ruin without me ! "
55467	55472	55474	55475	the Doctor	248	" That 's absurd , "
55477	55498	55474	55475	the Doctor	248	" you 're not such an important individual as all that , Bultitude . But let me see the letter . "
55561	55590	55555	55555	Paul	57	" Excuse me , Dr. Grimstone , it is — ah — of a private nature . I do n't feel at liberty to show it to anyone . "
55591	55596	55598	55599	the Doctor	248	" Then , sir , "
55605	55664	55598	55599	the Doctor	248	" if you ca n't tell me who or what it is that requires your presence at home , and decline to show me the letter which would presumably give me some idea on the subject , how do you expect that I am to listen to such a preposterous demand — eh ? Just tell me that ! "
55791	55794	55796	55797	the Doctor	248	" Pooh ! "

57850	57898	57838	57838	he	57	" you see , I do n't want to be mashed . I 'm not a potato . If I understand you aright , you want to fight me because you think me likely to interfere with your claim to that little girl's — ah — affections ? "

65213	65220	65221	65221	he	57	" Look at this , sir ! "
65232	65260	65221	65221	he	57	" Look at this ! what do you mean by receiving a flippant communication like this in a sacred edifice ? What do you mean by it ? "
65261	65270	65272	65272	Paul	57	" I — I did n't receive it , "
65280	65318	65272	65272	Paul	57	" Do n't prevaricate with me , sir ; you know well enough it was intended for you . Have the goodness to read it now , and tell me what you have to say for yourself ! "
65345	65350	65352	65353	the Doctor	248	" Well , sir ? "
65355	65365	65367	65367	Paul	57	" It 's very forward and improper — very , "
65369	65400	65367	65367	Paul	57	" but it 's not my fault — I ca n't help it . I gave the girl no encouragement . I never saw her before in all my life ! "
65401	65420	65352	65353	the Doctor	248	" To my own knowledge , Bultitude , she has sat in that pew regularly for a year . "
65421	65425	65427	65427	Paul	57	" Very probably , "
65429	65450	65427	65427	Paul	57	" but I do n't notice these matters . I 'm past that sort of thing , my dear sir . "
65451	65465	65352	65353	the Doctor	248	" What is her name ? Come , sir , you know that . "
65466	65470	65472	65472	Paul	57	" Connie Davenant , "
65483	65496	65472	65472	Paul	57	" At least , I — I heard so to - day . "
65513	65528	65530	65531	the Doctor	248	" Very odd that you know her name if you never noticed her before , "
65533	65548	65550	65550	Paul	57	" That young fellow — what's - his - name — Jolland told me , "
65552	65576	65550	65550	Paul	57	" Ah , but it 's odder still that she knows yours , for I perceive it is directed to you by name . "
65577	65587	65589	65589	Paul	57	" It 's easily explained , my dear sir , "
65591	65653	65589	65589	Paul	57	" easily explained . I 've no doubt she 's heard it somewhere . At least , I never told her ; it is not likely . I do assure you I 'm as much distressed and shocked by this affair as you can be yourself . I am indeed . I do n't know what girls are coming to nowadays . "
65654	65667	65669	65670	the Doctor	248	" Do you expect me to believe that you are perfectly innocent ? "
65672	65678	65680	65681	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Yes , I do , "
65683	65705	65680	65681	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I ca n't prevent fast young ladies from sending me notes . Why , she might have sent you one ! "
65706	65715	65717	65718	the Doctor	248	" We wo n't go into hypothetical cases , "
65731	65845	65717	65718	the Doctor	248	" she happened to prefer you . But , although your virtuous indignation seems to me a trifle overdone , sir , I do n't see my way clear to punishing you on the facts , especially as you tell me you never encouraged these — these overtures , and my Dulcie , I am bound to say , confirms your statement that it was all the other young lady 's doing . But if I had had any proof that you had begun or responded to her — hem — advances , nothing could have saved you from a severe flogging at the very least — so be careful for the future . "
65846	65849	65851	65851	Paul	57	" Ah ! "
65875	65947	65869	65869	he	57	" May I — ah — take advantage of this — this restored cordiality to — to — in fact to make a brief personal explanation ? It — it 's what I 've been trying to tell you for a long time , ever since I first came , only you never will hear me out . It 's highly important . You 've no notion how serious it is ! "
65948	65960	65962	65963	the Doctor	248	" There 's something about you this term , Richard Bultitude , "
65966	66041	65962	65963	the Doctor	248	" that I confess I do n't understand . This obstinacy is unusual in a boy of your age , and if you really have a mystery it may be as well to have it out and have done with it . But I ca n't be annoyed with it now . Come to me after supper to - night , and I shall be willing to hear anything you may have to say . "

66674	66690	66625	66625	he	101	" if you were near the keyhole at the time , very likely you did . "
66691	66697	66699	66699	Chawner	101	" The door was open , "
66701	66732	66699	66699	Chawner	101	" and I was in the cloak - room , so I heard , and I want to know . What is it you 're going to tell the Doctor ? "
66733	66741	66743	66743	Paul	57	" Mind your own business , sir , "
66746	66753	66755	66755	Chawner	101	" It is my own business , "
66757	66777	66755	66755	Chawner	101	" but I do n't want to be told what you 're going to tell him . I know . "
66778	66782	66784	66785	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Good heavens ! "
66801	66804	66806	66806	Chawner	101	" Yes , "
66808	66824	66806	66806	Chawner	101	" I know , and I tell you what — I wo n't have it ! "
66825	66834	66755	66755	Chawner	101	" Wo n't have it ! and why ? "
66835	66884	66806	66806	Chawner	101	" Never mind why . Perhaps I do n't choose that the Doctor shall be told just yet ; perhaps I mean to go up and tell him myself some other day . I want to have a little more fun out of it before I 've done . "
66885	66890	66892	66892	Paul	57	" But — but , "
66894	66917	66892	66892	Paul	57	" you young ghoul , do you mean to say that all you care for is to see other people 's sufferings ? "
66922	66925	66926	66926	he	101	" Yes , "
66930	66935	66926	66926	he	101	" it amuses me . "
66936	66940	66942	66942	Paul	57	" And so , "
66944	67027	66942	66942	Paul	57	" you want to hold me back a little longer — because it 's so funny ; and then , when you 're quite tired of your sport , you 'll go up and tell the Doctor my — my unhappy story yourself , eh ? No , my friend ; I 'd rather not tell him myself — but I 'll be shot if I let you have a finger in it . I know my own interests better than that ! "
67028	67038	67040	67040	Chawner	101	" Do n't get in a passion , Dickie , "
67042	67068	67040	67040	Chawner	101	" it 's Sunday . You 'll have to let me go up instead of you — when I 've frightened them a little more . "
67069	67079	67081	67081	Paul	57	" Who do you mean by them , sir ? "
67086	67109	67111	67111	Chawner	101	" As if you did n't know ! Oh , you 're too clever for me , Dickie , I can see , "
67113	67122	67124	67125	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I tell you I do n't know ! "
67127	67171	67124	67125	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Look here , Chawner — your confounded name is Chawner , is n't it?—there 's a mistake somewhere , I 'm sure of it . Listen to me . I 'm not going to tell the Doctor what you think I am ! "
67172	67184	67040	67040	Chawner	101	" What do I think you are going to tell him ? "
67185	67203	67124	67125	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I have n't the slightest idea ; but , whatever it is , you 're wrong . "
67204	67242	67124	67125	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Ah , you 're too clever , Dickie ; you wo n't betray yourself ; but other people want to pay Coker and Tipping out as well as you , and I say you must wait . "
67243	67255	67257	67257	Paul	57	" I sha n't say anything to affect anyone but myself , "
67259	67284	67257	67257	Paul	57	" if you know all about it , you must know that — it wo n't interfere with your amusement that I can see . "
67285	67291	67293	67293	Chawner	101	" Yes , it will , "
67296	67345	67293	67293	Chawner	101	" it will — you may n't mean to tell of anyone but yourself ; but directly Grimstone asks you questions , it all comes out . I know all about it . And , anyway , I forbid you to go up till I give you leave . "
67346	67354	67356	67357	Mr. Bultitude	57	" And who the dooce are you ? "
67366	67379	67356	67357	Mr. Bultitude	57	" How are you going to prevent me , may I ask ? "
67380	67388	67390	67390	Chawner	101	" S'sh ! here 's the Doctor , "
67393	67441	67390	67390	Chawner	101	" I 'll tell you after tea . What am I doing out of my place , sir ? Oh , I was only asking Bultitude what was the collect for to - day , sir . Fourth Sunday after the Epiphany ? thank you , Bultitude . "

68796	68830	68781	68781	Paul	57	" perhaps you 'll be good enough to tell me how you mean to prevent me from seeing Dr. Grimstone , and telling him — telling him what I have to tell him ? "
68831	68839	68841	68841	Chawner	101	" I 'll tell you , Dickie , "
68848	68855	68841	68841	Chawner	101	" You shall know soon enough . "
68856	68868	68870	68873	the angry Mr. Bultitude	57	" Do n't stand grinning at me like that , sir , "
68875	68895	68870	68873	the angry Mr. Bultitude	57	" say it out at once ; it will make no difference to me , I give you warning ! "
68896	68935	68841	68841	Chawner	101	" Oh , yes it will , though . I think it will . Wait . I heard all you said to Grimstone in the study to - day about that girl — Connie Davenant , you know . "
68936	68954	68870	68873	the angry Mr. Bultitude	57	" I do n't care ; I am innocent . I have nothing to reproach myself with . "
68955	68962	68964	68964	Chawner	101	" What a liar you are ! "
68972	69009	68964	68964	Chawner	101	" You told him you never gave her any encouragement , did n't you ? And he said if he ever found you had , nothing could save you from a licking , did n't he ? "
69010	69014	69016	69016	Paul	57	" He did , "
69018	69032	69016	69016	Paul	57	" he was quite right from his point of view — what then ? "
69033	69038	69040	69040	Chawner	101	" Why , this , "
69042	69063	69040	69040	Chawner	101	" Do you remember giving Jolland , the last Sunday of last term , a note for that very girl ? "
69064	69069	69071	69073	poor Mr. Bultitude	57	" I never did ! "
69075	69084	69071	69073	poor Mr. Bultitude	57	" I never saw the wretched girl before . "
69085	69088	69090	69090	Chawner	101	" Ah ! "
69092	69147	69090	69090	Chawner	101	" but I 've got the note in my pocket ! Jolland was seedy and asked me to take it for you , and I read it , and it was so nicely written that I thought I should like to keep it myself , and so I did — and here it is ! "
69169	69223	69149	69149	he	101	" Do n't snatch ... it 's rude ; there it is , you see : ' My dear Connie ' ... ' yours ever , Dick Bultitude . ' No , you do n't come any nearer ... there , now it 's safe .... Now what do you mean to do ? "
69224	69232	69234	69234	Paul	57	" I — I do n't know , "
69240	69245	69234	69234	Paul	57	" Give me time . "
69246	69303	69149	69149	he	101	" I tell you what I mean to do ; I shall keep my eye on you , and directly I see you making ready to go to Grimstone , I shall get up first and take him this ... then you 'll be done for . You 'd better give in , really , Dickie ! "
69367	69370	69363	69363	he	1539	" done for "
69427	69430	69432	69432	Chawner	101	" Well ? "
69434	69450	69432	69432	Chawner	101	" make up your mind ; are you going to tell him , or not ? "
69451	69455	69457	69457	Paul	57	" I must ! "
69460	69530	69457	69457	Paul	57	" I promise you I shall not bring any other names in ... I do n't want to ... I only want to save myself — and I ca n't stand it any longer . Why should you stand between me and my rights in this currish way ? I did n't know there were boys like you in the world , sir ; you 're a young monster ! "
69531	69545	69547	69547	Chawner	101	" I do n't mean you to tell the Doctor anything at all , "
69549	69557	69547	69547	Chawner	101	" I shall do what I said . "
69558	69564	69566	69566	Paul	57	" Then do your worst ! "
69572	69578	69580	69580	Chawner	101	" Very well , then , "
69583	69594	69580	69580	Chawner	101	" I will — and we 'll see who wins ! "
69666	69673	69674	69674	he	248	" It 's a foggy evening , "
69680	69709	69674	69674	he	248	" the younger boys had better stay in . Chawner , you and the rest of the first form can go to church ; get ready at once . "
69746	69757	69742	69742	he	101	" Please , sir , may Richard Bultitude come too ? "
69758	69767	69769	69770	the Doctor	248	" Ca n't Bultitude ask leave for himself ? "
69772	69777	69779	69781	the horrified Paul	57	" I , sir ! "
69783	69807	69779	69781	the horrified Paul	57	" it 's a mistake — I do n't want to go . I — I do n't feel very well this evening ! "
69808	69837	69838	69838	Chawner	101	" Then you see , Chawner , you misunderstood him . By the way , Bultitude , there was something you were to tell me , I think ? "
69863	69890	69892	69892	he	101	" Very well , I am going out to see a friend for an hour or so — when I come back I will hear you , "
69962	70001	69946	69946	he	101	" If I get back in time , Bultitude , we 'll see whether you baulk me quite so easily . If I come back and find you 've done it — I shall take in that letter ! "
70002	70011	70013	70013	Paul	57	" You may do what you please then , "
70022	70044	70013	70013	Paul	57	" I shall be well out of your reach by that time . Now have the goodness to take yourself off . "
70053	70082	70049	70050	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I never in all my life saw such a fellow as that , never ! It would give me real pleasure to hire someone to kick him . "
70334	70360	70326	70326	He	57	" You can not , my dear sir , have failed to observe since our meeting this year , a certain difference in my manner and bearing"—one
70481	70495	70496	70496	he	57	" I do n't know how I shall ever get it all out , "
70502	70519	70496	70496	he	57	" if I think about it much longer I shall begin to disbelieve in it myself . "
70534	70537	70538	70538	he	92	" Dick , "
70547	70563	70538	70538	he	92	" did I hear the Doctor say something about your having something to tell him ? "
70564	70575	70577	70577	Paul	57	" Oh Lord , here 's another of them now ! "
70579	70587	70588	70588	he	57	" You are right , young sir , "
70591	70637	70588	70588	he	57	" have you any objection ? mention it , you know , if you have , pray mention it . It 's a matter of life and death to me , but if you at all disapprove , of course that ought to be final ! "
70638	70643	70645	70645	Biddlecomb	92	" No , but , "
70647	70664	70645	70645	Biddlecomb	92	" I , I daresay I 've not treated you very well lately , I — — "
70665	70683	70685	70685	Paul	57	" You were kind enough to suggest several very uncommonly unpleasant ways of annoying me , sir , "
70688	70752	70685	70685	Paul	57	" if you mean that . You 've kicked me more than once , and your handkerchief , unless I am very much mistaken , had the biggest and the hardest knot in it yesterday . If that gives you the right to interfere and dictate to me now , like your amiable friend , Master Chawner , I suppose you have it . "
70753	70759	70761	70761	Biddlecomb	92	" Now you 're angry , "
70764	70802	70761	70761	Biddlecomb	92	" I do n't wonder at it . I 've behaved like a cad , I know , but , and this is what I wanted to say , I was sorry for you all the time . "
70803	70809	70811	70811	Paul	57	" That 's very comforting , "
70814	70825	70811	70811	Paul	57	" thank you . I 'm vastly obliged to you . "
70826	70832	70834	70834	Biddlecomb	92	" I was , though , "
70836	70858	70834	70834	Biddlecomb	92	" I , I was led away by the other fellows — I always liked you , you know , Bultitude . "
70859	70871	70873	70874	Mr. Bultitude	57	" You 've a very odd way of showing your affection , "
70876	70890	70873	70874	Mr. Bultitude	57	" but go on , let me hear all you have to say . "
70891	70897	70899	70899	Biddlecomb	92	" It is n't much , "
70905	70957	70970	70970	Paul	57	" only do n't sneak of me this time , Dick , let me off , there 's a good fellow . I 'll stick up for you after this , I will really . You used not to be a fellow for sneaking once . It 's caddish to sneak ! "
70958	70968	70970	70970	Paul	57	" Do n't be alarmed , my good friend , "
70972	71001	70970	70970	Paul	57	" I wo n't poach on that excellent young man Chawner 's preserves . What I am going to tell the Doctor has nothing to do with you . "
71002	71007	71009	71009	Biddlecomb	92	" On your honour ? "
71012	71015	71017	71017	Paul	57	" Yes , "
71020	71061	71017	71017	Paul	57	" on my honour . Now , perhaps , you 'll let me alone . No , I wo n't shake hands , sir . I 've had to accept your kicks , but I do n't want your friendship . "
71079	71083	71085	71085	Paul	57	" Thank goodness ! "
71087	71116	71085	71085	Paul	57	" he was n't as obstinate as the other fellow . What a set they are ! I knew it , there 's another boy coming up now ! "
71260	71274	71275	71275	he	57	" I do n't know what you 've said to all those chaps , "
71278	71297	71275	71275	he	57	" they 've come back looking precious glum , but they wo n't tell me what you said , "
71324	71354	71275	71275	he	57	" but I 've got something to say to you , and it 's this . I never thought you would quite come down to this sort of thing ! "
71355	71361	71363	71363	Paul	57	" What sort of thing ? "
71374	71542	71363	71363	Paul	57	" Why , going up and letting on against all of us — it 's mean , you know . If you have got bashed about pretty well since you came back , it 's been all your own fault , and you know it . Last term you got on well enough — this time you began to be queer and nasty the very first day you came . I thought it was one of your larks at first , but I do n't know what it is now , and I do n't care . I stood up for you as long as I could , till you acted like a funk yesterday . Then I took my share in lamming you , and I 'd do it again . But if you are cad enough to pay us all out in this way , I 'll have no more to do with you — mind that . That 's all I came to say . "
71602	71655	71666	71666	Jolland	78	" You 're on the wrong tack , my boy , the wrong tack . I 've no wish to tell tales of anyone , as I 've been trying to explain to your friends . There 's something the matter with me which you would n't understand if I told you . "
71656	71664	71666	71666	Jolland	78	" Oh , I did n't know , "
71670	71679	71666	71666	Jolland	78	" if it 's only physic you want . "
71680	71685	71687	71687	Paul	57	" Whatever it is , "
71695	71761	71687	71687	Paul	57	" it wo n't affect you or anyone here , but myself . You 're not a bad young fellow , I believe . I do n't want to get you into trouble , sir ; you do n't want much assistance , I 'm afraid , in that department . So be off , like a good fellow , and leave me in peace . "
72121	72131	72104	72105	the Doctor	248	" Now , Bultitude , I will hear you ! "
72232	72237	72238	72238	he	248	" Now , Bultitude , "
72242	72251	72254	72255	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Might I — might I sit down ? "
72271	72277	72279	72280	the Doctor	248	" Sit by all means , "
72335	72342	72344	72345	the latter	446	" Take your time , Bultitude , "
72362	72370	72344	72345	the latter	446	loudly—"there 's no hurry , my boy . "
72406	72426	72401	72401	he	57	" You see me in a very agitated state , Dr. Grimstone — a very agitated state , sir . "
72436	72441	72442	72442	he	248	" Well , Bultitude , "
72445	72477	72442	72442	he	248	" The fact is , sir , I 'm in a most unfortunate position , and — and the worst of it is , I do n't know how to begin . "
72499	72514	72515	72515	he	57	" Do you see any prospect of your finding yourself able to begin soon ? "
72525	72536	72515	72515	he	57	" Perhaps if you came to me later on — — "
72537	72543	72545	72545	Paul	57	" Not for the world ! "
72553	72589	72545	72545	Paul	57	" I shall begin very soon , Doctor , I shall begin directly . Mine is such a very singular case ; it 's difficult , as you see , to , to open it ! "
72590	72598	72600	72601	the Doctor	248	" Have you anything on your mind ? "
72620	72625	72626	72626	he	57	" Yes — no ! "
72635	72650	72652	72653	the Doctor	248	" That 's a somewhat extraordinary , not to say an ambiguous , reply , "
72655	72664	72652	72653	the Doctor	248	" what am I to understand by — — "
72682	72689	72690	72690	he	57	" Do n't let him in ! "
72699	72726	72690	72690	he	57	" Hear me first — you shall hear me first ! Say that other rascal is not to come in . He wants to ruin me ! "
72727	72737	72739	72740	the Doctor	248	" I was going to say I was engaged , "
72742	72760	72739	72740	the Doctor	248	" but there 's something under this I must understand . Come in , whoever you are . "
72787	72794	72796	72797	the Doctor	248	" Now , then , Chawner , "
72800	72814	72796	72797	the Doctor	248	" what is it ? Have you something on your mind , too ? "
72815	72820	72822	72822	Chawner	101	" Please , sir , "
72824	72832	72822	72822	Chawner	101	" has Bultitude told you anything yet ? "
72833	72853	72796	72797	the Doctor	248	" No , why ? Hold your tongue , Bultitude . I shall hear Chawner now — not you ! "
72854	72859	72861	72861	Chawner	101	" Because , sir , "
72863	72920	72861	72861	Chawner	101	" he knew I had made up my mind to tell you something I thought you ought to know about him , and so he threatened to come first and tell some falsehood ( I 'm sure I do n't know what ) about me , sir . I think I ought to be here too . "
72921	72927	72929	72929	Paul	57	" It 's a lie ! "
72931	72957	72929	72929	Paul	57	" What a villain that boy is ! Do n't believe a word he says , Dr. Grimstone ; it 's all false — all ! "
72958	72964	72966	72967	the Doctor	248	" This is very suspicious , "
72969	73002	73003	73003	he	248	" if your conscience were good , Bultitude , you could have no object in preventing me from hearing Chawner . Chawner , in spite of some obvious defects in his character , "
73023	73046	73003	73003	he	248	" is , on the whole , a right - minded and , ah , conscientious boy . I hear Chawner first . "
73047	73056	73058	73058	Chawner	101	" Then , sir , if you please , "
73089	73115	73117	73117	he	248	" I thought it was my duty to let you see this . I found it to - day in Bultitude 's prayerbook , sir . "
73159	73176	73151	73152	the Doctor	248	" You did well to tell me of this , Chawner ; you may go now . "
73195	73201	73202	73202	he	248	" Contemptible liar and hypocrite , "
73229	73374	73221	73221	Daniel	167	" you are unmasked — unmasked , sir ! You led me to believe that you were as much shocked and pained at this girl 's venturing to write to you as I could be myself . You called it , quite correctly , ' forward and improper ' ; you pretended you had never given her the least encouragement — had not heard her name even — till to - day . And here is a note , written , as I should imagine , some time since , in which you address her as ' Connie Davenant , ' and have the impudence to admire the hat she wore the Sunday before ! I shudder , sir , to think of such duplicity , such precocious and shameless depravity . It astounds me . It deprives me of all power to think ! "
73401	73409	73411	73412	the Doctor	248	" What shall I do with you ? "
73414	73423	73411	73412	the Doctor	248	" how shall I punish such monstrous misconduct ? "
73424	73432	73434	73434	Paul	57	" Do n't ask me , sir , "
73436	73451	73434	73434	Paul	57	desperately—"only , for heaven 's sake , get it over as soon as possible . "
73452	73459	73461	73462	the Doctor	248	" If I linger , sir , "
73464	73493	73461	73462	the Doctor	248	" it is because I have grave doubts whether your offence can be expiated by a mere flogging — whether that is not altogether too light a retribution . "
73494	73503	73505	73505	Paul	57	" He ca n't want to torture me , "
73507	73510	73512	73513	the Doctor	248	" Yes , "
73516	73648	73512	73513	the Doctor	248	" the doubt has prevailed . On a mind so hardened the cane would leave no lasting impression . I can not allow your innocent companions to run the risk of contamination from your society . I must not permit this serpent to glide uncrushed , this cockatrice to practise his epistolary wiles , within my peaceful fold . My mind is made up — at whatever cost to myself — however it may distress and grieve your good father , who is so pathetically anxious for you to do him credit , sir . I must do my duty to the parents of the boys entrusted to my care . I shall not flog you , sir , for I feel it would be useless . I shall expel you . "
73649	73652	73653	73653	Paul	57	" What ! "
73658	73680	73653	73653	Paul	57	" Expel me ? Do I hear you aright , Dr. Grimstone ? Say it again — you will expel me ? "
73681	73687	73688	73689	the Doctor	248	" I have said it , "
73693	73700	73688	73689	the Doctor	248	" no expostulations can move me now "
73712	73774	73688	73689	the Doctor	248	" Mrs. Grimstone will see that your boxes are packed the first thing to - morrow morning , and I shall take you myself to the station and consign you to the home you have covered with blushes and shame , by the 9.15 train , and I shall write a letter to - night explaining the causes for your dismissal . "
73924	73932	73934	73935	the Doctor	248	" But one night more , sir , "
73937	73973	73974	73974	I	0	" shall you pass beneath this roof , and that apart from your fellows . You will occupy the spare bedroom until the morning , when you quit the school in disgrace — for ever . "
74219	74226	74216	74216	their	1613	" Discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras . "
74407	74410	74411	74411	he	248	" Bultitude , "
74415	74442	74411	74411	he	248	" before sending you from us , I should like to hear from your own lips that you are not altogether without contrition for your conduct . "
74472	74481	74458	74458	he	248	" he very much regretted what had passed . "
74482	74490	74492	74493	the Doctor	248	" I am glad to hear that , "
74498	74527	74492	74493	the Doctor	248	" very glad ; it relieves me from a very painful responsibility . It may not impossibly induce me to take a more lenient view of your case . "
74528	74531	74533	74534	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Oh ! "
74543	74651	74533	74534	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Yes ; it is a serious step to ruin a boy 's career at its outset by unnecessary harshness . Nothing , of course , can palliate the extreme baseness of your behaviour . Still from certain faint indications in your character of better things , I do not despair even yet ( after you have received a public lesson at my hands , which you will never forget ) of rearing you to become in time an ornament to the society in which it will be your lot to move . I will not give up in despair — I will persevere a little longer . "
74652	74656	74657	74657	Paul	57	" Thank you ! "
74666	74672	74674	74675	the Doctor	248	" Mrs. Grimstone , too , "
74677	74753	74674	74675	the Doctor	248	" has been interceding for you ; she has represented to me that a public expression of my view of your conduct , together with a sharp , severe dose of physical pain , would be more likely to effect a radical improvement in your character , and to soften your perverted heart , than if I sent you away in hopeless disgrace , without giving you an opportunity of showing a desire to amend . "
74754	74763	74765	74765	Paul	57	" It's — very kind of Mrs. Grimstone , "
74768	74860	74765	74765	Paul	57	" Then I hope you will show your appreciation of her kindness . Yes , I will not expel you . I will give you one more chance to retrieve your lost reputation . But , for your own sake , and as a public warning , I shall take notice of your offence in public . I shall visit it upon you by a sound flogging before the whole school at eleven o'clock . You need not come down till then — your breakfast will be sent up to you . "
74874	74878	74879	74879	he	57	" Dr. Grimstone , "
74882	74901	74879	74879	he	57	" I — I should much prefer being expelled , if it is all the same to you . "
74902	74912	74914	74915	the Doctor	248	" It is not all the same to me , "
74917	74938	74914	74915	the Doctor	248	" This is mere pride and obstinacy , Bultitude ; I should do wrong to take any notice of it . "
74939	74955	74957	74957	Paul	57	" I — I tell you I have great objection to — to being flogged , "
74960	75034	74957	74957	Paul	57	" it would n't improve me at all ; it would harden me , sir,—harden me . I — I can not allow you to flog me , Dr. Grimstone . I have strong prejudices against the system of corporal punishment . I object to it on principle . Expulsion would make me quite a different being , I assure you ; it would reform me — save me — it would indeed . "
75035	75065	75067	75068	the Doctor	248	" So , to escape a little personal inconvenience , you would be content to bring sorrow upon your worthy father 's grey head , would you , sir ? "
75070	75111	75067	75068	the Doctor	248	" I shall not oblige you in this . Nor , I may add , will your cowardice induce me to spare you in your coming chastisement . I leave you , sir — we shall meet again at eleven ! "
75486	75489	75490	75490	she	110	" There ! "
75496	75519	75490	75490	she	110	" I got Mummy to let me take up your breakfast ; and there 's an egg for you , and muffins . "
75529	75538	75540	75540	Dulcie	110	" You might say ' thank you , ' "
75544	75587	75540	75540	Dulcie	110	" That other girl would n't have brought you up much breakfast if she 'd been in my place . I was going to tell you that I 'd forgiven you , because very likely you never meant her to write to you "
75610	75624	75540	75540	Dulcie	110	" But you do n't seem to care whether I do or not . "
75625	75631	75633	75633	Paul	57	" I feel so miserable ! "
75635	75643	75633	75633	Paul	57	" Then you must drink some coffee , "
75648	75671	75645	75645	Dulcie	110	" and you must eat some breakfast . I brought an egg on purpose ; it 's so strengthening , you know . "
75672	75676	75678	75678	Paul	57	" Do n't ! "
75690	75706	75678	75678	Paul	57	" Do n't talk about the — the flogging , I ca n't bear it . "
75707	75722	75724	75724	Dulcie	110	" But it 's not papa 's new cane , you know , Dick , "
75727	75778	75724	75724	Dulcie	110	" I 've hidden that ; it 's only the old one , and you always said that did n't hurt so very much , after a little while . It is n't as if it was the horsewhip , either . Daddy lost that out riding in the holidays . "
75779	75790	75792	75792	Paul	57	" Oh , the horsewhip 's worse , is it ? "
75799	75804	75806	75806	Dulcie	110	" Tom says so , "
75808	75869	75806	75806	Dulcie	110	" After all , Dick , it will be all over in five minutes , or , perhaps , a little longer , and I do think you ought n't to mind that so much , now , after mamma and I have begged you off from being expelled . We might never have seen one another again , Dick ! "
75870	75876	75878	75878	Paul	57	" You begged me off ! "
75880	75883	75885	75885	Dulcie	110	" Yes , "
75887	75913	75885	75885	Dulcie	110	" Daddy would n't change his mind for ever so long — till I coaxed him . I could n't bear to let you go . "
75914	75923	75925	75925	Paul	57	" You 've done a very cruel thing , "
75927	75975	75925	75925	Paul	57	" For such a little girl as you are , you 've done an immense amount of mischief . But for you , that letter would not have been found out . You need not have spoilt my only chance of getting out of this horrible place ! "
75998	76008	76009	76009	she	110	" And is that all you say to me ! "
76020	76025	76027	76027	Paul	57	" That is all , "
76029	76069	76027	76027	Paul	57	" I 've no doubt you meant well , but you should n't have interfered . All this has come upon me through that . Take away the breakfast . It makes me ill even to look at it . "
76101	76107	76108	76108	she	110	" Very well , then , "
76119	76227	76108	76108	she	110	" I 'm very sorry I ever did interfere . I wish I 'd let you be sent home to your papa , and see what he 'd do to you . But I 'll never , never interfere one bit with you again . I wo n't say one single word to you any more .... I 'll never even look at you if you want me to ever so much .... I shall tell Tipping he can hit you as much as ever he likes , and I shall show Tom where I put the new cane — and I only hope it will hurt ! "
76414	76424	76404	76405	the butler	375	" would see him now , if he pleased . "
76519	76521	76532	76532	he	108	" double "
76619	76625	76627	76628	the Doctor	248	" Stand there , sir , "
76642	76656	76627	76628	the Doctor	248	" out there in the middle , where your schoolfellows can see you . "
76675	76681	76683	76684	the Doctor	248	" Some of those here , "
76690	76735	76683	76684	the Doctor	248	" may wonder why I have called you all together on this , the first day of the week ; most of those who reside under my roof are acquainted with , and I trust execrate , the miserable cause of my doing so . "
76755	76759	76683	76684	the Doctor	248	" he continued , "
76780	76834	76836	76836	him	1654	" With the majority I have , I hope , been successful , and it is as painful for me to tell as for you to hear , that there exists in your midst a youthful reprobate , trained in all the arts of ensnaring the vagrant fancies of innocent but giddy girlhood . "
76854	76880	76836	76836	him	1654	" ( the Doctor on occasions like these never spared his best epithets , and Paul soon began to feel himself a very villain ) ; "
76936	77003	76923	76923	I	0	" You do well to shun him as a moral leper ; but how shall I tell you that , not satisfied with pressing his effusions upon the shrinking object of his precocious affections , the impious wretch has availed himself of the shelter of a church to cloak his insidious advances , and even force a response to them from a heedless and imprudent girl ! "
77006	77021	77022	77022	I	0	" continued the Doctor , now allowing his powerful voice to boom to its full compass—"if
77098	77145	77146	77146	I	0	" He shall see whether he will be allowed to trail the fair name of the school for propriety and correctness of deportment in the dust of a pew - floor , and spurn my reputation as a preceptor like a church hassock beneath his feet ! "
77201	77201	77182	77182	I	0	"
77338	77347	77349	77349	some	749	" He 's gone to fetch his cane , "
77448	77458	77459	77459	he	101	" I told you , Dickie , you know , "
77462	77472	77459	77459	he	101	" that it was better not to cross me . "
77485	77490	77483	77483	he	57	" waxing the cane . "
77589	77597	77598	77598	he	248	" I want you outside , Bultitude , "
77632	77646	77648	77649	the Doctor	248	" If anything can strike shame and confusion into your soul , Richard , "
77656	77680	77681	77681	Paul	57	" it will be what I have to tell you now . Your unhappy father is here , in the dining - room . "
77725	77733	77735	77736	the Doctor	248	" I have not seen him yet , "
77738	77747	77735	77736	the Doctor	248	" He has come at a most inopportune moment "
77759	77791	77793	77794	the Doctor	248	" I shall allow you to meet him first , and give you the opportunity of breaking your conduct to him . I know how it will wring his paternal heart ! "

78237	78242	78243	78243	he	170	" You young scoundrel ! "
78250	78280	78243	78243	he	170	" What the devil do you mean by laughing like that ? It 's no laughing matter , let me tell you , sir , for one of us ! "
78281	78288	78290	78290	Dick	60	" I ca n't help laughing , "
78292	78299	78243	78243	he	170	" you do look so queer ! "
78300	78333	78243	78243	he	170	" Queer ! I may well look queer . I tell you that I have never , never in my whole life , spent such a perfectly infernal week as this last ! "
78334	78337	78339	78339	Dick	60	" Ah ! "
78341	78363	78364	78364	he	60	" I thought you would n't find it all jam ! And yet you seemed to be enjoying yourself , too , "
78370	78377	78364	78364	he	60	" from that letter you wrote . "
78378	78405	78243	78243	he	170	" What made you come here ? Could n't you be content with your miserable victory , without coming down to crow and jeer at me ? "
78406	78412	78414	78414	Dick	60	" It is n't that , "
78416	78441	78414	78414	Dick	60	" I — I thought I should like to see the fellows , and find out how you were getting on , you know . "
78466	78471	78473	78474	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Well , sir , "
78480	78588	78473	78474	Mr. Bultitude	57	" you 'll be delighted to hear that I 'm getting on uncommonly well — oh , uncommonly ! Your high - spirited young friends batter me to sleep with slippers on most nights , and , as a general thing , kick me about during the day like a confounded football ! And last night , sir , I was going to be expelled ; and this morning I 'm forgiven , and sentenced to be soundly flogged before the whole school ! It was just about to take place as you came in ; and I 've every reason to believe it is merely postponed ! "
78589	78595	78597	78597	Dick	60	" I say , though , "
78599	78630	78597	78597	Dick	60	" you must have been going it rather , you know . I 've never been expelled . Has Chawner been sneaking again ? What have you been up to ? "
78631	78653	78473	78474	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Nothing . I solemnly swear — nothing ! They 're finding out things you 've done , and thrashing me . "
78654	78657	78659	78659	Dick	60	" Well , "
78662	78698	78659	78659	Dick	60	" you 'll work them all off during the term , I daresay . There are n't many really bad ones . I suppose he 's seen my name cut on his writing - table ? "
78699	78709	78711	78711	Paul	57	" No ; not that I 'm aware of , "
78713	78727	78729	78729	Dick	60	" Oh , he 'd let you hear of it if he had ! "
78731	78759	78729	78729	Dick	60	" It 's good for a swishing , that is . But , after all , what 's a swishing ? I never cared for a swishing . "
78760	78791	78792	78792	he	60	" But I do care , sir . I care very much , and , I tell you , I wo n't stand it . I ca n't ! Dick , "
78802	78831	78792	78792	he	60	" You , you have n't come down here to say you 're tired of your folly , have you ? Do you want to give it up ? "
78832	78836	78838	78838	Dick	60	" Rather not , "
78840	78878	78838	78838	Dick	60	" Why should I ? No school , no lessons , nothing to do but amuse myself , eat and drink what I like , and lots of money . It 's not likely , you know . "
78879	78897	78899	78899	Paul	57	" Have you ever thought that you 're bringing yourself within reach of the law , sir ? "
78906	78947	78899	78899	Paul	57	" Perhaps you do n't know that there 's an offence known as ' false personation with intent to defraud , ' and that it 's a felony . That 's what you 're doing at this moment , sir ! "
78948	78956	78958	78958	Dick	60	" Not any more than you are ! "
78960	79002	78958	78958	Dick	60	" I never began it . I had as much right to wish to be you as you had to wish to be me . You 're just what you said you wanted to be , so you ca n't complain . "
79003	79015	79017	79017	Paul	57	" It 's useless to argue with you , I see , "
79019	79183	79017	79017	Paul	57	" And you 've no feelings . But I 'll warn you of one thing . Whether that is my body or not you 've fraudulently taken possession of , I do n't know ; if it is not , it is very like mine , and I tell you this about it . The sort of life you 're leading it , sir , will very soon make an end of you , if you do n't take care . Do you think that a constitution at my age can stand sweet wines and pastry , and late hours ? Why , you 'll be laid up with gout in another day or two . Do n't tell me , sir . I know you 're suffering from indigestion at this very minute . I can see your liver ( it may be my liver for anything I know ) is out of order . I can see it in your eyes . "
79197	79233	79193	79193	he	60	" Well , and if I am seedy , I can get Barbara to take the stone and wish me all right again , ca n't I ? That 's easy enough , I suppose . "
79234	79240	79242	79242	Paul	57	" Oh , easy enough ! "
79249	79277	79242	79242	Paul	57	" But , Dick , you do n't go up to Mincing Lane in that suit and that hat ? Do n't tell me you do that ! "
79278	79289	79291	79291	Dick	60	" When I do go up , I wear them , "
79294	79387	79291	79291	Dick	60	" Why not ? It 's a roomy suit , and I hate a great topper on my head ; I 've had enough of that here on Sundays . But it 's slow up at your office . The chaps there are n't half up to any larks . I made a first - rate booby - trap , though , one day for an old yellow buffer who came in to see you . He was in a bait when he found the waste - paper basket on his head ! "
79388	79394	79396	79396	Paul	57	" What was his name ? "
79402	79427	79396	79396	Paul	57	" Something like ' Shells . ' He said he was a very old friend of mine , and I told him he lied . "
79428	79450	79452	79453	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Shellack — my Canton correspondent — a man I was anxious to be of use to when he came over ! "
79455	79470	79452	79453	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Miserable young cub , you do n't know what mischief you 've done ! "
79471	79483	79485	79485	Dick	60	" Well , it wo n't matter much to you now , "
79487	79495	79485	79485	Dick	60	" you 're out of it all . "
79496	79514	79516	79516	Paul	57	" Do you — do you mean to keep me out of it for ever , then ? "
79518	79526	79528	79528	Dick	60	" As long as ever I can ! "
79531	79576	79528	79528	Dick	60	" It will be rather interesting to see what sort of a fellow you 'll grow into — if you ever do grow . Perhaps you will always be like that , you know . This magic is a rum thing to meddle with . "
79597	79608	79609	79609	he	57	" Do you think I will put up with it ? "
79616	79761	79762	79762	Dick	60	" Do you suppose I shall stand calmly by and see you degrading and ruining me ? I may never be my old self again , but I do n't mean to play into your hands for all that . You ca n't always keep me here , and wherever I go I 'll tell my tale . I know you , you clumsy rogue , you have n't the sense to play your part with common intelligence now . You would betray yourself directly I challenged you to deny my story .... You know you would .... You could n't face me for five minutes . By Gad ! I 'll do it now . I 'll expose you before the Doctor — before the whole school . You shall see if you can dispose of me quite so easily as you imagine ! "
79799	79830	79795	79795	he	57	" Well , you can do it if you choose , I suppose . I ca n't stop you . But I do n't see what good it would do . "
79831	79844	79846	79846	Paul	57	" It would show people you were an impudent impostor , sir , "
79897	79900	79901	79901	he	57	" Stop ! "
79904	79924	79901	79901	he	57	" Before you call them in , just listen to me for a minute . Do you see this ? "
79978	79986	79988	79988	Dick	60	" You know it , I see , "
80007	80205	79988	79988	Dick	60	" Do n't trouble to come any closer . Well , I give you fair warning . You can make things very nasty for me if you like . I ca n't help that — but , if you do — if you try to score off me in any way , now or at any time — if you do n't keep it up when the Doctor comes in — I tell you what I shall do . I shall go straight home and find young Roly . I shall give him this stone , and just tell him to say some wish after me . I do n't believe there are many things it ca n't do , and all I can say is — if you find yourself and all this jolly old school ( except Dulcie ) taken off somewhere and stuck down all at once thousands of miles away on a desolate island , or see yourself turned into a Red Indian , or , or a cabhorse , you 'll have yourself to thank for it — that 's all . Now you can have them all up and fire away . "
80206	80209	80211	80211	Paul	57	" No , "
80242	80327	79988	79988	Dick	60	" I — I was joking , Dick ; at least I did n't mean it . I know of course I 'm helpless . It 's a sad thing for a father to say , but you 've got the best of it .... I give in ... I wo n't interfere with you . There 's only one thing I ask . You wo n't try any more experiments with that miserable stone .... You 'll promise me that , at least ? "
80328	80331	80333	80333	Dick	60	" Yes , "
80335	80379	80333	80333	Dick	60	" it 's all right . I 'll play fair . As long as you behave yourself and back me up I wo n't touch it . I only want to stay as I am . I do n't want to hurt you . "
80380	80387	80389	80389	Paul	57	" You wo n't lose it ? "
80392	80408	80389	80389	Paul	57	" Could n't you lock it up ? that fastening does n't look very safe . "
80409	80416	80418	80418	Dick	60	" It will do well enough , "
80420	80453	80418	80418	Dick	60	" I got it done at the watchmaker 's round the corner , for sixpence . But I 'll have a stronger ring put in somewhere , if I think of it . "
80488	80677	80472	80472	Dick	60	" Now , you know , it 's much better to take things quietly . It ca n't be altered now , can it ? And it 's not such bad fun being a boy after all — for some things . You 'll get into it by - and - by , you see if you do n't , and be as jolly as a sandboy . We shall get along all right together , too . I sha n't be hard on you . It is n't my fault that you happen to be at this particular school — you chose it ! And after this term you can go to any other school you like — Eton or Rugby , or anywhere . I do n't mind the expense . Of , if you 'd rather , you can have a private tutor . And I 'll buy you a pony , and you can ride in the Row . You shall have a much better time of it than I ever had , as long as you let me go on my own way . "
80721	80729	80730	80730	he	57	" I do n't want your pony , "
80734	80807	80730	80730	he	57	" I might as well have a white elephant , and I do n't suppose I should enjoy myself much more at a public school than I do here . Let 's have no humbug , sir . You 're up and I 'm down — there 's no more to be said — I shall tell the Doctor nothing , but I warn you , if ever the time comes — — "
80808	80814	80816	80816	Dick	60	" Oh , of course , "
80831	80880	80881	80881	Paul	57	" If you can turn me out , I suppose you will — that 's only fair . I shall take care not to give you the chance . And , oh , I say , do you want any tin ? How much have you got left ? "
80911	80928	80901	80901	he	57	" I came away with exactly five shillings , and I have n't a penny now ! "
80929	80933	80935	80935	Dick	60	" I say , "
80937	80962	80935	80935	Dick	60	" you are a fellow ; you must have been going it . How did you get rid of it all in a week ? "
80963	80974	80976	80977	Mr. Bultitude	57	" It went , as far as I can understand , "
80979	81001	80976	80977	Mr. Bultitude	57	" in rabbits and mice . Some boys claimed it as money they paid you to get them , I believe . "
81002	81008	81010	81010	Dick	60	" All your own fault , "
81012	81045	81010	81010	Dick	60	" you would have them drowned . But you 'd better have some tin to get along with . How much do you want ? Will half - a - crown do ? "
81046	81058	81060	81061	his father	242	" Half - a - crown is not much , Dick , "
81066	81081	81083	81083	Dick	60	" It's — ahem — a handsome allowance for a young fellow like you , "
81088	81108	81083	81083	Dick	60	" but I have n't any half - crowns left . I must give you this , I suppose . "
81151	81157	81159	81159	Dick	60	" And now look out , "
81161	81176	81159	81159	Dick	60	" I hear Grim . Remember what I told you ; keep it up . "
81212	81216	81217	81217	he	60	" I hope , "
81221	81251	81217	81217	he	60	" that your son has spared me the pain of going into the details of his misbehaviour ; I wish I could give you a better report of him . "
81302	81307	81308	81308	he	60	" Oh , ah , "
81313	81333	81308	81308	he	60	" you were just going to swish him , were n't you , when I turned up , sir ? "
81334	81340	81342	81343	the Doctor	248	" I found myself forced , "
81355	81402	81342	81343	the Doctor	248	" forced to contemplate administering to him ( for his ultimate benefit ) a sharp corrective in the presence of his schoolfellows . I distress you , I see , but the truth must be told . He has no doubt confessed his fault to you ? "
81403	81406	81408	81408	Dick	60	" No , "
81410	81424	81408	81408	Dick	60	" he has n't though . What 's he been up to now ? "
81425	81498	81500	81500	Dick	60	" I had hoped he would have been more open , more straightforward , when confronted with the father who has proved himself so often indulgent and anxious for his improvement ; it would have been a more favourable symptom , I think . Well , I must tell you myself . I know too well what a shock it will be to your scrupulously sensitive moral code , my dear Mr. Bultitude "
81510	81546	81547	81547	Dick	60	" but I have to break to you the melancholy truth that I detected this unhappy boy in the act of conducting a secret and amorous correspondence with a young lady in a sacred edifice ! "
81551	81557	81558	81558	he	60	" Oh , I say ! "
81561	81565	81558	81558	he	60	" that 's bad "
81590	81618	81568	81568	he	60	" that 's bad ... he should n't do that sort of thing you know , should he ? At his age too ... the young dog ! "
81619	81631	81633	81634	the Doctor	248	" This horror is what I should have expected from you , "
81655	81707	81633	81634	the Doctor	248	" Such boldness is indeed characteristic of the dog , an animal which , as you are aware , was with the ancients a synonym for shamelessness . No boy , however abandoned , should hear such words of unequivocal condemnation from a father 's lips without a pang of shame ! "
81722	81730	81732	81732	Dick	60	" You 're right there , sir , "
81734	81787	81732	81732	Dick	60	" he ought to be well ragged for it ... he 'll break my heart , if he goes on like this , the young beggar . But we must n't be too hard on him , eh ? After all , it 's nature , you know , is n't it ? "
81788	81794	81796	81797	Dr. Grimstone	62	" I beg your pardon ? "
81801	81805	81807	81807	Dick	60	" I mean , "
81821	81846	81807	81807	Dick	60	" we did much the same sort of thing in our time , eh ? I 'm sure I did — lots of times ! "
81847	81905	81732	81732	Dick	60	" I ca n't reproach myself on that head , Mr. Bultitude ; and permit me to say , that such a tone of treating the affair is apt to destroy the effect , the excellent moral effect , of your most impressively conveyed indignation just now . I merely give you a hint , you understand ! "
81906	81911	81913	81913	Dick	60	" Oh , ah , "
81923	81950	81913	81913	Dick	60	" yes , I did n't mean that . But I say , you have n't given him a — a whopping yet , have you ? "
81951	81965	81967	81968	the Doctor	248	" I had just stepped out to procure a cane for that purpose , "
81970	81977	81967	81968	the Doctor	248	" when your name was announced . "
81978	81999	81913	81913	Dick	60	" Well , look here , you wo n't want to start again when I 'm gone , will you ? "
82000	82036	81913	81913	Dick	60	" An ancient philosopher , my dear sir , was accustomed to postpone the correction of his slaves until the first glow of his indignation had passed away . He found that he could — — "
82037	82045	82047	82047	Dick	60	" Lay it on with more science , "
82056	82117	81913	81913	Dick	60	" Perhaps so , but you might forgive him now , do n't you think ? he wo n't do it again . If he goes writing any more love - letters , tell me , and I 'll come and talk to him ; but he 's had a lesson , you know . Let him off this time . "
82118	82129	82131	82132	the Doctor	248	" I have no right to resist such an entreaty , "
82134	82166	82131	82132	the Doctor	248	" though I may be inclined myself to think that a few strokes would render the lesson more permanent . I must ask you to reconsider your plea for his pardon . "
82222	82230	82231	82231	he	57	" I 'd rather let him off , "
82235	82264	82231	82231	he	57	" I do n't approve of caning fellows myself . It never did me any good , I know , and I got enough of it to tell . "
82265	82343	82397	82398	the Doctor	248	" Well , well , I yield . Richard , your father has interceded for you ; and I can not disregard his wishes , though I have my own view in the matter . You will hear no more of this disgraceful conduct , sir , unless you do something to recall it to my memory . Thank your father for his kindness , which you so little deserved , and take your leave of him . "
82344	82354	82356	82356	Dick	60	" Oh , there , it 's all right ! "
82358	82377	82378	82378	he	60	" he 'll behave himself after this , I know . And oh ! I say , sir , "
82382	82390	82378	82378	he	60	" is — is Dulcie anywhere about ? "
82391	82395	82397	82398	the Doctor	248	" My daughter ? "
82400	82408	82397	82398	the Doctor	248	" Would you like to see her ? "
82409	82415	82417	82417	Dick	60	" I should n't mind , "
82422	82439	82441	82442	the Doctor	248	" I 'm sorry to say she has gone out for a walk with her mother , "
82444	82461	82441	82442	the Doctor	248	" I 'm afraid she can not be back for some time . It 's unfortunate . "
82467	82473	82474	82474	he	60	" It does n't matter , "
82478	82487	82474	82474	he	60	" She 's all right , I hope ? "
82488	82511	82462	82462	Dick	60	" She is very seldom ailing , I 'm happy to say ; just now she is particularly well , thank you . "
82512	82518	82520	82520	Dick	60	" Oh , is she ? "
82547	82580	82601	82601	he	242	" Well , do you mind — could I see the fellows again for a minute or two — I mean I should rather like to inspect the school , you know . "
82581	82599	82601	82601	he	242	" See my boys ? Certainly , my dear sir , by all means ; this way , "
82615	82627	82629	82630	the Doctor	248	" You 'll find us at our studies , you see , "
82690	82694	82696	82697	the Doctor	248	" Our workshop , "
82703	82721	82722	82722	Dick	60	" My first form , Mr. Bultitude . Some good workers here , and some idle ones . "
82766	82769	82809	82811	The good boys	1715	" old boys "
82840	82849	82828	82828	Dick	60	" This is Tipping , my head boy , "
82866	82876	82828	82828	Dick	60	" I expect solid results from Tipping some day . "

82934	82958	82959	82959	he	60	" I owe you ninepence — I mean — oh hang it , here 's a shilling for you ! Hallo , Chawner ! "
82969	82986	82959	82959	he	60	" how are you getting on , eh ? Doing much in the sneaking way lately ? "
82987	82992	82994	82995	the Doctor	248	" You know him ! "
83000	83024	82994	82995	the Doctor	248	" No , no ; I do n't know him . I 've heard of him , you know — heard of him ! "

83067	83135	83137	83137	he	60	" I must be off , you know . Got some important business at home this evening to look after . The fellows look very jolly and contented , and all that sort of thing . Enough to make one want to be a boy again almost , eh ? Good - bye , you chaps — ahem , young gentlemen , I wish you good morning ! "
83147	83161	83162	83162	He	60	" young Bultitude 's governor was n't half such a bad old buffer . "
83180	83185	83186	83186	he	60	" Good - bye , "
83189	83221	83222	83222	he	60	" I wish I 'd seen Dulcie . I should like to see your daughter , sir ; but it ca n't be helped . Good - bye ; and you , "
83248	83264	83222	83222	he	60	" you mind what I told you . Do n't try any games with me ! "
83316	83344	83313	83313	his	60	" You do n't happen to know , Richard , my boy , if your father has had any business troubles lately — anything to disturb him ? "

84515	84522	84512	84513	the Doctor	248	" what have you got there ? "

84545	84552	84554	84555	the Doctor	248	" What is in that envelope ? "
84565	84576	84578	84578	Jolland	78	" In the envelope , sir ? Pudding , sir , "
84600	84611	84613	84614	the Doctor	248	" And why did you place pudding in the envelope ? "
84656	84668	84670	84671	the Doctor	248	" Shall I tell you why you did it , sir ? "
84673	84785	84670	84671	the Doctor	248	" You did it , because you were scheming to obtain a second portion — because you did not feel yourself able to eat both portions at your leisure here , and thought to put by a part to devour in secret at a future time . It 's a most painful exhibition of pure piggishness . There shall be no pocketing at this table , sir . You will eat that pudding under my eye at once , and you will stay in and write out French verbs for two days . That will put an end to any more gorging in the garden for a time , at least . "
85063	85067	85038	85038	Dick	60	" R. Bultitude . "
85555	85558	85553	85553	Haydn	175	" Surprise , "

86429	86483	86426	86426	he	57	" and change this sovereign , and ask to look at a timetable — then , if I find I can catch a train at once , I 'll run for it ; if one is not due for some time , I can hang about near the station till it comes in . "
86621	86636	86637	86637	He	57	" I want a pencil - case , one which screws up and down . "
86704	86725	86726	86726	he	2317	" You 're one of Dr. Grimstone 's young gentlemen up at Crichton House , are n't you , sir ? "

86850	86854	86856	86857	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Thank you , "
86859	86870	86856	86857	Mr. Bultitude	57	" but — but I want the up - trains . "

86885	86909	86876	86877	the man	2317	" I thought maybe your par or mar was comin ' down . Ai n't Dr. Grimstone got the times the trains go ? "

86959	86971	86956	86957	the stationer	1821	" I thought you was n't one of his young gentlemen ? "

87007	87042	86995	86997	the little stationer	1824	" Lor bless you , I knew your face the minnit you come in . To go and tell me a brazen story like that ! You 're a young pickle , you are ! "

87065	87095	87059	87059	he	57	" No , no . Heaven knows I 'm no pickle . It 's of no consequence about those trains . Do n't trouble . Good evening to you . "
87096	87099	87101	87102	the man	2317	" Stop , "
87104	87223	87101	87102	the man	2317	" do n't be in such a nurry now . You tell me what you want to know straightforward , and I do n't mean to say as I wo n't help you so far as I can . Do n't be afraid of my telling no tales . I 've bin a schoolboy myself in my time , bless your ' art . I should n't wonder now if I could n't make a pretty good guess without telling at what you 're after . You 've bin a catchin ' of it hot , and you want to make a clean bolt of it . I ai n't very far off , now , am I ? "

I do n't want to get into trouble up at Crichton House and lose good customers , you see . But I like the looks of you , and you 've always dealt ' ere pretty regular . I do n't mind if I give you a lift . Just see here . You want to get off to London , do n't you ? What for is your business , not mine . Well , there 's a train , express , stops at only one station on the way , in at 5.50 . It 's twenty minnits to six now . If you take that road just oppersite , it 'll bring you out at the end of the Station Road ; you can do it easy in ten minnits and have time to spare . So cut away , and good luck to you ? "
87442	87450	87452	87452	Paul	57	" I 'm vastly obliged to you , "
87808	87811	87813	87813	Coker	88	" Hallo ! "

87822	87835	87837	87837	Coggs	89	" What do you mean by cannoning into a fellow like this ? "
87839	87850	87837	87837	Coggs	89	" What are you up to out here , eh ? "
87851	87858	87860	87860	Paul	57	" If it comes to that , "

87880	87883	87885	87885	Chawner	101	" Why , "
87887	87955	87956	87956	Coggs	89	" if you want to know , Dick , we 've been to fetch the St. James ' Gazette for the Doctor . He said I might go if I liked , and I asked for Coker and Coggs to come too ; because there was something I wanted to tell them , very important , and I have told them , have n't I , Corny ? "
87969	88010	87960	87960	Coker	88	" I do n't care when you tell , Chawner . Do it to - night if you like . Let 's talk about something else . Bultitude has n't told us yet how he came out here after us . "
88028	88031	88032	88032	he	57	" Oh , "
88035	88072	88032	88032	he	57	" I ? I came out here , after you , to say that Dr. Grimstone will not require the St. James ' Gazette . He wants the Globe and , ah , the Star instead . "
88110	88120	88122	88122	Coker	88	" Well , we 've got the other now , "
88124	88151	88122	88122	Coker	88	" We shall have to go back and get the fellow at the bookstall to change it , I suppose . Come on , you fellows ! "
88268	88281	88282	88282	he	57	" H - hadn't we better run , do n't you think ? "
88285	88288	88290	88290	Coker	88	" Run ! "
88293	88311	88290	88290	Coker	88	" What for ? I 'm not going to run . You can , if you like . "
88312	88319	88321	88321	Paul	57	" Why , ah , really , "
88330	88340	88321	88321	Paul	57	" do you know , I think I will ! "
88553	88563	88565	88566	Mr. Bultitude	57	" One moment , ma'am , if you please , "
88572	88579	88565	88566	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I 'm pressed for time . "
88580	88593	88595	88597	the old lady	1858	" Now you 've gone and put me out , little boy , "
88600	88641	88595	88597	the old lady	1858	" I shall have to begin all over again . Young man , will you take and count the other end and see if it adds up right ? There 's a halfpenny wrong somewhere ; I know there is . "
88642	88646	88648	88652	the guard from the platform	1861	" Now then , "
88654	88660	88648	88652	the guard from the platform	1861	" Any more going on ? "
88661	88667	88669	88669	Paul	57	" I 'm going on ! "
88671	88684	88669	88669	Paul	57	" Wait for me . First single to St. Pancras , quick ! "
88685	88690	88692	88694	the old lady	1858	" Drat the boy ! "
88697	88736	88692	88694	the old lady	1858	" Do you think the world 's to give way for you ? Such impidence ! Mind your manners , little boy , ca n't you ? You 've made me drop a threepenny bit with your scrouging ! "
88737	88744	88746	88747	the clerk	1859	" First single , five shillings , "
88755	88758	88760	88761	the guard	552	" Right ! "
88767	88775	88760	88761	the guard	552	" Stand back there , will you ! "
88893	88918	88887	88887	Coggs	89	" Hallo ! so you have n't got the Globe and the other thing after all , then ; they 've shut you out ? "
88919	88922	88924	88925	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Yes , "
88931	88938	88924	88925	Mr. Bultitude	57	" they 've shut me out ! "
89188	89200	89202	89202	Chawner	101	" Dickie , you were very anxious to run just now , "
89215	89226	89228	89228	Paul	57	" We were late for tea — late for tea , "
89231	89247	89249	89249	Coggs	89	" If you think the tea worth racing like that for , I do n't , "
89252	89257	89249	89249	Coggs	89	" it 's muck . "
89258	89272	89274	89274	Coker	88	" You do n't catch me racing , except for something worth having , "
89329	89334	89335	89335	he	88	" Why — why , "
89339	89357	89335	89335	he	88	" would you race if you had something worth racing for , hey ? would you now ? "
89358	89362	89364	89364	Coker	88	" Try us ! "
89367	89376	89378	89378	Chawner	101	" What do you call ' something ' ? "
89381	89384	89386	89387	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Well , "

89411	89419	89421	89421	Paul	57	" Here 's a shilling , see , "
89426	89444	89454	89454	Coker	88	" Now then , I 'll give this to any boy I see get into tea first ! "
89445	89452	89454	89454	Coker	88	" Bultitude thinks he can run , "
89464	89480	89454	89454	Coker	88	" He means to get in first and keep the shilling himself , I know . "
89481	89492	89495	89495	Coggs	89	" I 'll back myself to run him any day , "
89497	89502	89504	89504	Chawner	101	" So will I , "
89506	89513	89514	89514	Paul	57	" Well , is it agreed ? "
89518	89523	89514	89514	Paul	57	" Will you try ? "
89524	89528	89530	89530	Chawner	101	" All right , "
89532	89564	89530	89530	Chawner	101	" You must give us a start to the next lamp - post , though . You stay here , and when we 're ready we 'll say ' off ' ! "

I want you to assist me in a very unpleasant affair — the fact is , one of my pupils has had the folly and wickedness to run away . "
91796	91803	91805	91808	the station - master	630	" You do n't say so ! "
91810	91888	91805	91808	the station - master	630	" It 's only too true , I 'm sorry to say ; he seemed happy and contented enough , too ; it 's a black ungrateful business . But I must catch him , you know ; he must be about here somewhere , I feel sure . You do n't happen to have noticed a boy who looked as if he belonged to me ? They ca n't tell me at the booking - office . "
91905	91908	91910	91911	the latter	446	" No , "
91913	91961	91910	91911	the latter	446	" I ca n't say I have , sir , but some of my men may have come across him . I 'll inquire — here , Ing , I want you ; this gentleman here has lost one of his boys , have you seen him ? "
91962	91975	91978	91978	Tommy	95	" What sort of a young gentleman was he to look at ? "
91983	91991	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" A bright intelligent - looking boy , "
91996	92007	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" medium height , about thirteen , with auburn hair . "
92008	92023	92025	92025	Tommy	95	" No , I ai n't seen no intelligent boys with median ' eight , "
92028	92052	92025	92025	Tommy	95	" not leastways , to speak to positive . What might he ' ave on , now , besides his oburn ' air ? "
92053	92063	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" Black cloth jacket , with a wide collar , "
92068	92081	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" grey trousers , and a cloth cap with a leather peak . "
92082	92085	92087	92087	Tommy	95	" Oh , "
92089	92096	92087	92087	Tommy	95	" then I see ' i m. "
92097	92102	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" When — where ? "
92103	92112	91993	91994	the Doctor	248	" ' Bout arf an ' our since . "
92113	92122	92087	92087	Tommy	95	" Do you know where he is now ? "
92123	92126	92128	92128	Tommy	95	" Well , "
92159	92175	92087	92087	Tommy	95	" I dessay I could give a guess if I give my mind to it . "
92176	92192	92194	92206	the station - master , who had apparently just turned to go away	1939	" Out with it , Ing , now , if you know ; no tricks , "
92208	92225	92194	92206	the station - master , who had apparently just turned to go away	1939	" Excuse me , sir , but I 've some matters in there to see after . "
92237	92284	92231	92232	the Doctor	248	" Come , you 're keeping something from me , I will have it out of you . If I find you have deceived me , I 'll write to the manager and get you sent about your business — you'd better tell me the truth . "
92285	92289	92291	92291	Tommy	95	" You see , "
92299	92310	92291	92291	Tommy	95	" that young gent o ' yourn was a gent . "
92311	92322	92324	92325	the Doctor	248	" I tried my very best to render him so , "
92328	92344	92324	92325	the Doctor	248	" here is the result — how did you discover he was one , pray ? "
92345	92353	92355	92355	Tommy	95	" 'Cos he acted like a gent , "
92357	92369	92355	92355	Tommy	95	" he took and give me a ' arf - suffering . "
92370	92379	92381	92382	the Doctor	248	" Well , I 'll give you another , "
92384	92394	92381	92382	the Doctor	248	" if you can tell me where he is . "
92395	92424	92355	92355	Tommy	95	" Thankee , sir , do n't you be afraid — you're a gent right enough , too , though you do ' appen to be a schoolmaster . "
92425	92432	92434	92435	the Doctor	248	" Where is the unhappy boy ? "
92437	92460	92462	92462	Tommy	95	" Seems as if I was a roundin ' on ' i m , like , do n't it a'most , sir ? "
92496	92501	92503	92504	the Doctor	248	" Not at all , "
92506	92526	92503	92504	the Doctor	248	" not at all , my good fellow ; you're — ahem — advancing the cause of moral order . "
92527	92532	92534	92534	Tommy	95	" Oh , ah , "
92541	92626	92534	92534	Tommy	95	" Well , if I 'm a doin' all that , I ca n't go fur wrong , can I ? And arter all , we may n't like schools or schoolmasters , not over above , but we ca n't get on without 'em , I s'pose . But , look ye here , sir — if I goes and tells you where you can get hold of this here boy , you wo n't go and wallop him now , will ye ? "
92627	92634	92636	92637	the Doctor	248	" I can make no bargains , "
92639	92648	92636	92637	the Doctor	248	" I shall act on my own discretion . "
92649	92654	92656	92656	Tommy	95	" That 's it , "
92661	92715	92656	92656	Tommy	95	" spoke like a merciful Christian gen'leman ; if you do n't go actin ' on nothing more nor your discretion , you ca n't hurt him much , I take it . Well then , since you 've spoke out fair , I do n't mind putting you on his track like . "
92770	92776	92779	92779	Tommy	95	" Well , you see , "
92794	93049	92779	92779	Tommy	95	" it was like this here — he comes up to me , and says — your young gen'leman , I mean — says he , ' Porter , I wants to ' ide , I 've run away . ' And I says to him , says I , ' It 's no use your ' anging about ' ere , ' I says , ' 'cause , if you do , your guv'nor ( meanin ' no offence to you , sir ) 'll be comin ' up and ketchin ' of you on the ' op . ' ' Right you are , porter , ' says he to me , ' what do you advise ? ' he says . ' Well , ' I says , ' I do n't know as I 'm right in givin ' you no advice at all , havin' run away from them as has the care on you , ' I says ; ' but if I was a young gen'leman as did n't want to be ketched , I should just walk on to Dufferton ; it ai n't on'y three mile or so , and you 'll ' ave time for to do it before the up - train comes along there . ' ' Thankee , porter , ' he says , ' I 'll do that , ' and away he bolts , and for anything I know , he 's ' arf way there by this time . "
93050	93054	93056	93057	the Doctor	248	" A fly ! "
93072	93110	93061	93061	Tommy	95	" I 'll catch the young rascal now — who has a good horse ? Davis , I 'll take you . Five shillings if you reach Dufferton before the up - train . Take the — — "
93170	93254	93162	93162	Tommy	95	" Are you all right in there , sir ? he 's safe enough now — orf on a pretty dance . You did n't think I was goin' to tell on ye , did ye now ? I ai n't quite sech a cur as that comes to , particular when a young gent saves me from the ' orrors , and gives me a ' arf - suffering . I 'll see you through , you make yourself easy about that . "
93424	93431	93433	93434	honest Tommy	95	" Could n't do it afore , "
93436	93468	93469	93469	He	95	" Our guv'nor would have seen me . Now 's your time . Here 's a empty first - class coach I 've kept for ye . In with you now . "
93514	93518	93519	93519	he	95	" I say , "
93522	93554	93519	93519	he	95	" if I was you , I 'd get under the seat before you gets to Dufferton , otherways your guv'nor'll be spottin ' you . I 'll lock you in . "
93555	93569	93571	93571	Paul	57	" I 'll get under now ; some one might see me here , "
93657	93677	93687	93687	Tommy	95	" Porter ! guard ! Hi , somebody ! open this door , will you ; it 's locked . "
93678	93684	93687	93687	Tommy	95	" This way , sir , "
93693	93700	93687	93687	Tommy	95	" Plenty of room higher up . "
93701	93726	93687	93687	Tommy	95	" I do n't want to go higher up . I 'll go here . Just open it at once , I tell you . "
93742	93752	93754	93755	the first	1957	" Always take the middle carriage of a train , "
93757	93782	93754	93755	the first	1957	" Safest in any accident , y'know . Never heard of a middle carriage of a train getting smashed up , to speak of . "
93825	93828	93829	93829	he	57	" Still , "
93832	93861	93829	93829	he	57	" it is lucky that I had time to get under here before they came in ; it would have seemed odd if I had done it afterwards . "
93874	93885	93887	93888	the first	1957	" What was it we were talking about just now ? "
93890	93917	93887	93888	the first	1957	" Let me see . Ah ! I remember . Yes ; it was a very painful thing — very , indeed , I assure you . "
94033	94036	94037	94038	the speaker	1962	" Yes , "
94041	94109	94037	94038	the speaker	1962	" he was never , according to what I hear , a man of any extraordinary capacity , but he was always spoken of as a man of standing in the City , doing a safe business , not a risky one , and so on , you know . So , of course , his manner , when I called , shocked me all the more . "
94110	94113	94115	94116	the other	2428	" Ah ! "
94118	94127	94115	94116	the other	2428	" Was he violent or insulting , then ? "
94128	94218	94219	94219	Paul	57	" No , no ! I can only describe his conduct as eccentric — what one might call reprehensibly eccentric and extravagant . I did n't call exactly in the way of business , but about a poor young fellow in my house , who is , I fear , rather far gone in consumption , and , knowing he was a Life Governor , y'know , I thought he might give me a letter for the hospital . Well , when I got up to Mincing Lane — — "
94237	94391	94231	94231	they	1964	" When I got there , I sent in my card with a message that , if he was engaged or anything , I would take the liberty of calling at his private house , and so on . But they said he would see me . The clerk who showed me in said : ' You 'll find him a good deal changed , if you knew him , sir . We 're very uneasy about him here , ' which prepared me for something out of the common . Well , I went into a sort of inner room , and there he was , in his shirt - sleeves , busy over some abomination he was cooking at the stove , with the office - boy helping him ! I never was so taken aback in my life . I said something about calling another time , but Bultitude — — "
94413	94470	94482	94483	the other	2428	" Bultitude says , just like a great awkward schoolboy , y'know , ' What 's your name ? How d'ye do ? Have some hardbake , it 's just done ? ' Fancy finding a man in his position cooking toffee in the middle of the day , and offering it to a perfect stranger ! "
94471	94480	94482	94483	the other	2428	" Softening of the brain — must be , "
94485	94556	94482	94483	the other	2428	" I fear so . Well , he asked what I wanted , and I told him , and he actually said he never did any business now , except sign his name where his clerks told him . He 'd worked hard all his life , he said , and he was tired of it . Business was , I understood him to say , ' all rot ! ' "
94557	94633	94482	94483	the other	2428	" Then he would n't promise me votes or give me a letter or anything , without consulting his head clerk ; he seemed to know nothing whatever about it himself , and when that was over , he asked me a quantity of frivolous questions which appeared to have a sort of catch in them , as far as I could gather , and he was exceedingly angry when I would n't humour him . "
94634	94640	94739	94740	the other	2428	" What kind of questions ? "
94641	94722	94482	94483	the other	2428	" Well , really I hardly know . I believe he wanted to know whether I would rather be a bigger fool than I looked or look a bigger fool than I was , and he pressed me quite earnestly to repeat some foolishness after him , about ' being a gold key , ' when he said ' he was a gold lock , ' I was very glad to get away from him , it was so distressing . "
94723	94737	94739	94740	the other	2428	" They tell me he has begun to speculate , too , lately , "
94742	94761	94739	94740	the other	2428	" You see his name about in some very queer things . It 's a pitiful affair altogether . "
94859	94862	94856	94856	they	1969	" risks , "
94870	94872	94856	94856	they	1969	" writing "
94888	94891	94856	94856	they	1969	" on , "
94897	94904	94856	94856	they	1969	" writing five hundred on everything , "
95103	95125	95100	95100	one	271	testily—"Get in , sir ; kindly get in if you 're coming on , please . This draught is most unpleasant ! "
95126	95139	95141	95142	the Doctor	248	" I do not propose to travel by this train , sir , "
95144	95183	95141	95142	the Doctor	248	" but , as a person entrusted with the care of youth , permit me to inquire whether you have seen ( or , it may be assisted to conceal ) a small boy of intelligent appearance — — "
95184	95199	95201	95210	the man who had described his visit to Mincing Lane	1982	" Why should we conceal small boys of intelligent appearance about us , pray ? "
95212	95243	95201	95210	the man who had described his visit to Mincing Lane	1982	" And may we ask you to shut that door , and make any communications you wish to make through the window , or else come in and sit down ? "
95244	95256	95258	95259	the Doctor	248	" That 's not an answer to my question , sir , "
95261	95301	95258	95259	the Doctor	248	" I notice you carefully decline to say whether you have seen a boy . I consider your manner suspicious , sir ; and I shall insist on searching this carriage through and through till I find that boy ! "
95316	95321	95323	95325	the first gentleman	1984	" Guard , guard ! "
95327	95370	95323	95325	the first gentleman	1984	" Come here . Here 's a violent person who will search this carriage for something he has lost . I wo n't be inconvenienced in this way without any reason whatever ! He says we 're hiding a boy in here ! "
95371	95374	95376	95377	the Doctor	248	" Guard ! "
95383	95434	95376	95377	the Doctor	248	" I insist upon looking under these seats before you start the train . I 've looked through every other carriage and he must be in here . Gentlemen , let me pass , I 'll get him if I have to travel in this compartment to town with you ! "
95435	95444	95446	95447	the guard	552	" For peace and quietness sake , gentlemen , "
95449	95486	95446	95447	the guard	552	" let him look round , just to ease his mind . Lend me your stick a minute , sir , please . I 'll turn him out if he 's anywhere about this here compartment ! "
95560	95563	95565	95566	the guard	552	" There , "
95570	95603	95604	95604	he	552	" there really ai n't no one there , sir , you see . I 've felt everywhere and — — Hello , I certainly did feel something just then , gentlemen ! "
95630	95643	95645	95648	one of the passengers	1990	" You touch that again with that confounded stick if you dare ! "
95650	95701	95645	95648	one of the passengers	1990	" That 's a parcel of mine . I wo n't have you poking holes through it in that way . Do n't tell that lunatic behind you , he 'll be wanting it opened to see if his boy 's inside ! Now perhaps you 'll let us alone ! "
95702	95707	95709	95710	the guard	552	" Well , sir , "
95721	95761	95709	95710	the guard	552	" he ai n't in there . There 's nothing under any of the seats . Your boy'll be comin ' on by the next train , most likely — the 8.40 . We 're all behind . Right ! "
95762	95768	95770	95772	the first passenger	1994	" Good night , sir , "
95789	95829	95774	95774	he	1994	" You 've put us to all this inconvenience for nothing , and in the most offensive way too . I hope you wo n't find your boy till you 're in a better temper , for his sake . "
95830	95842	95844	95846	the angry Doctor	1997	" If I had you out on this platform , sir , "
95848	95871	95844	95846	the angry Doctor	1997	" I 'd horsewhip you for that insult . I believe the boy 's there and you know it . I — — "
95899	95910	95912	95916	one of Paul 's companions	2000	" What a violent fellow for a schoolmaster , eh ? "
95925	95952	95912	95916	one of Paul 's companions	2000	" I was n't going to have him turning the cushions inside out here ; we should n't have settled down again before we got in ! "
95953	96010	96059	96059	his	188	" No ; and if the guard has n't , as it is , injured that Indian shawl in my parcel , I shall be — — Why , bless my soul , that parcel 's not under the seat after all ! It 's up in the rack . I remember putting it there now . "
96011	96050	96051	96052	Mr. Goldicutt	188	" The guard must have fancied he felt something ; and yet — — Look here , Goldicutt ; just feel under here with your feet . It certainly does seem as if something soft was — eh ? "
96070	96075	96076	96076	he	188	" Upon my word , "
96081	96165	96076	96076	he	188	" it really does seem very like it . It 's not hard enough for a bag or a hat - box . It yields distinctly when you kick it . Can you fetch it out with your umbrella , do you think ? Shall we tell the guard at the next — — ? Lord , it 's coming out of its own accord . It 's a dog ! No , my stars — it 's the boy , after all ! "
96236	96243	96244	96244	they	901	" Why , you young rascal ! "
96252	96268	96244	96244	they	901	" you do n't mean to say you 've been under there the whole time ? "
96269	96274	96276	96276	Paul	57	" I have indeed , "
96278	96290	96276	96276	Paul	57	" I — I did n't like to come out before . "
96291	96349	96244	96244	they	901	" And are you the boy all this fuss was about ? Yes ? And we kept the schoolmaster off without knowing it ! Why , this is splendid , capital ! You 're something like a boy , you little dog , you ! This is the best joke I 've heard for many a day ! "
96350	96354	96356	96356	Paul	57	" I hope , "
96358	96373	96356	96356	Paul	57	" I have n't inconvenienced you . I could not help it , really . "
96374	96479	96244	96244	they	901	" Inconvenienced us ? Gad , your schoolmaster came very near inconveniencing us and you too . But there , he wo n't trouble any of us now . To think of our swearing by all our gods there was no boy in here , and vowing he should n't come in , while you were lying down there under the seat all the time ! Why , it 's lovely ! The boy 's got pluck and manners too . Shake hands , young gentleman , you owe us no apologies . I have n't had such a laugh for many a day ! "
96480	96491	96494	96494	Paul	57	" Then you — you wo n't give me up ? "
96496	96499	96506	96506	Goldicutt	188	" Well , "
96523	96574	96506	96506	Goldicutt	188	" we 're not exactly going to take the trouble of getting out at the next station , and bringing you back to Dufferton , just to oblige that hot - tempered master of yours , you know ; he has n't been so particularly civil as to deserve that . "
96575	96593	96595	96595	Paul	57	" But if he were to telegraph and get some one to stop me at St. Pancras ? "
96598	96646	96595	96595	Paul	57	" Ah , he might do that , to be sure — sharp boy this — well , as we 've gone so far , I suppose we must go through with the business now and smuggle the young scamp past the detectives , eh , Travers ? "
96762	96765	96744	96744	they	2008	" Jones , "
96824	96830	96832	96833	the latter	446	" Beg pardon , gentlemen , "
96839	96856	96832	96833	the latter	446	" but does that young gent in the corner happen to belong to either of you ? "
96881	96892	96893	96893	he	2014	" Do you hear that , Johnny , my boy , "
96916	96946	96947	96947	he	2014	" they want to know if you belong to me . I suppose you 'll allow a son to belong to his father to a certain extent , eh ? "
96964	96983	96984	96984	he	2014	" We 've orders to look out for a young gent about the size of yours , sir , "
96987	96996	96984	96984	he	2014	" no offence meant , I 'm sure , "
97036	97046	97052	97052	he	188	" Now my advice to you , young man , "
97071	97138	97052	97052	he	188	" is to go straight home to Papa and tell him all about it . I daresay he wo n't be very hard on you — here 's my card , refer him to me if you like . Good - night , my boy , good - night , and good luck to you . Gad , the best joke I 've had for years ! "
98176	98188	98190	98191	the cook	269	" They have n't give me a answer yet , Eliza , "
98199	98204	98206	98206	Eliza	192	" Lor , cook ! "
98208	98223	98206	98206	Eliza	192	" you could n't hardly expect it , seeing you only wrote on Friday . "
98224	98282	98284	98284	she	192	" No more I did , Eliza . You see it on'y began to come into my mind sudden like this last week . I 'm sure I no more dreamt——. But they 've answered a lady who 's bin in much the same situation as me aperiently . You just ' ark to this a minute . "
98292	98365	98284	98284	she	192	" ' Lady Bird.—You ask us ( 1 ) what are the signs by which you may recognise the first dawnings of your lover 's affection . On so delicate a matter we are naturally averse from advising you ; your own heart must be your best guide . But perhaps we may mention a few of the most usual and infallible symptoms'—What sort of a thing is a symptim , Eliza ? "
98366	98372	98374	98374	Eliza	192	" A symptim , cook , "
98376	98416	98374	98374	Eliza	192	" is somethink wrong with the inside . Her at my last place in Cadogan Square had them uncommon bad . She was what they call æsthetical , pore young thing . Them infallible ones are always the worst . "
98417	98429	98284	98284	she	192	" It do n't seem to make sense though , Eliza , "
98434	98712	98284	98284	she	192	" Hear how it goes on : ' Infallible symptoms . If you have truly inspired him with a genuine and lasting passion ' ( do n't he write beautiful ? ) ' passion , he will continually haunt those places in which you are most likely to be found ' ( I could n't tell you the times master 's bin down in my kitching this last week ) ; ' he will appear awkward and constrained in your presence ' ( anything more awkward than master I never set eyes on . He 's knocked down one of the best porcelain vegetables this very afternoon ! ) ; ' he will beg for any little favours , some trifle , it may be , made by your own hand ' ( master 's always a - asking if I 've got any of those doughnuts to give away ) ; ' and , if granted , he will treasure them in secret with pride and rapture ' ( I do n't think master kep ' any of them doughnuts though , Eliza . I saw him swaller five ; but you could n't treasure a doughnut , not to mention — — I 'll make him a pincushion when I 've time , and see what he does with it ) . ' If you detect all these indications of liking in the person you suspect of paying his addresses to you , you may safely reckon upon bringing him to your feet in a very short space of time . ( 2 ) Yes , fuller 's earth will make them exquisitely white . ' "
98713	98718	98727	98727	she	2073	" There , Eliza ! "
98731	98775	98727	98727	she	2073	" if it had been meant for me it could n't have been clearer . Ai n't it written nice ? And on'y to think of my bringing master to my feet ! It seems almost too much for a cook to expect ! "
98776	98882	98284	98284	she	192	" I would n't say so , cook ; I would n't . Have some proper pride . Do n't let him think he 's only to ask and have ! Why , in the London Journal last week there was a dook as married a governess ; and I should ' ope as a cook ranked above a governess . Nor yet master ai n't a dook ; he 's only in the City ! But are you sure he 's not only a - trifling with your affections , cook ? He 's bin very affable and pleasant with all of us lately . "
98883	98896	98727	98727	she	2073	" It ai n't for me to speak too positive , Eliza , "
98902	98942	98944	98944	Eliza	192	" nor to lay bare the feelings of a bosom , beyond what 's right and proper . You 're young yet , Eliza , and do n't understand these things — leastways , it 's to be hoped not "
98952	99024	98944	98944	Eliza	192	" but do you remember that afternoon last week as master stayed at home a - playin ' games with the children ? I was a - goin' upstairs to fetch my thimble , and there , on the bedroom landin ' , was master all alone , with one of Master Dick 's toy - guns in his ' and , and a old slouch ' at on his head . "
99067	99068	99069	99069	I	0	" "
99101	99102	99086	99086	I	0	" "
99114	99123	99104	99104	he	2075	" ( here Paul shivered with shame ) , "
99198	99199	99188	99188	I	0	" "
99209	99213	99202	99202	he	2075	" said Eliza , "
99251	99252	99253	99253	You	192	" "
99259	99265	99253	99253	You	192	" said the cook sentimentally , "
99330	99331	99324	99324	I	0	" "
99341	99345	99339	99339	cook	3659	" said Eliza , "
99381	99382	99395	99395	Lord	2081	" "
99387	99392	99395	99395	Lord	2081	" cried the cook , "
99425	99426	99414	99414	you	194	" "
99439	99445	99437	99437	Jane	195	" said Boaler 's voice . "
99584	99663	99664	99666	That dreadful woman	2093	" So the cook allowed herself to be persuaded by Boaler , and the two went up to the hall , and , to Mr. Bultitude 's intense relief , forgot to close the glazed door which cut him off from the staircase . As he followed them upstairs at a cautious interval , and thought over what he had just so unwillingly overheard , he felt as one who had just been subjected to a moral showerbath . "
99668	99672	99664	99666	That dreadful woman	2093	" he groaned . "
99744	99899	99724	99725	miserable Dick	60	" But more than ever he began to wish that he had stayed in the playground . When he reached the hall he stood there for some moments in anxious deliberation over his best course of proceeding . His main idea was to lie in wait somewhere for Dick , and try the result of an appeal to his better feelings to acknowledge his outcast parent and abdicate gracefully . If that failed , and there was every reason to expect that it would fail , he must threaten to denounce him before the whole party . It would cause a considerable scandal no doubt , and be extremely repugnant to his own feelings , but still he must do it , or frighten Dick by threatening to do it , and at all hazards he must contrive during the interview to snatch or purloin the magic stone ; without that he was practically helpless .
100236	100238	100189	100189	He	2108	" Dundreary "
100280	100283	100269	100269	Paradine	75	" Uncle Marmaduke "
100329	100333	100334	100334	he	57	" No wonder , "
100338	100350	100334	100334	he	57	" the fellow has been living on me for a week ! "
100389	100399	100367	100367	he	2108	" I hope you are making yourself quite comfortable ? "
100408	100418	100419	100419	he	2108	" Uncommonly attentive and polite of you to inquire , "
100438	100469	100419	100419	he	2108	" whoever you are . If it will relieve your mind at all to know , young man , I 'm happy to say I am tolerably comfortable , thanks . "
100470	100478	100480	100480	Paul	57	" I — I concluded as much , "
100487	100496	100498	100499	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" You 've been very nicely brought up , "
100501	100605	100498	100499	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" I can see that at a glance . So you 've come in here , like me , eh ? because the children bore you , and you want a quiet gossip over the world in general ? Sit down then , take a cigar , if you do n't think it will make you very unwell . I should n't recommend it myself , you know , before supper — but you 're a man of the world and know what 's good for you . Come along , enjoy yourself till you find yourself getting queer — then drop it . "
100699	100708	100675	100675	he	57	" Do n't you know me , Paradine ? "
100709	100769	100675	100675	he	57	" I do n't think I have the privilege — you're one of Miss Barbara 's numerous young friends , I suppose ? and yet , now I look at you , you do n't seem to be exactly got up for an evening party ; there 's something in your voice , too , I ought to know . "
100770	100774	100776	100776	Paul	57	" You ought , "
100782	100789	100776	100776	Paul	57	" My name is Paul Bultitude ! "
100790	100795	100797	100797	Marmaduke	75	" To be sure ! "
100799	100896	100797	100797	Marmaduke	75	" By Jove , then , you 're my young nephew , do n't you know ; I 'm your long - lost uncle , my boy , I am indeed ( I 'll excuse you from coming to my arms , however ; I never was good at family embraces ) . But , I say , you little rascal , you 've never been asked to these festivities , you ought to be miles away , fast asleep in your bed at school . What in the name of wonder are you doing here ? "
100897	100903	100905	100905	Paul	57	" I've — left school , "
100907	100984	100905	100905	Paul	57	" So I perceive . Sulky because they left you out of all this , eh ? Thought you 'd turn up in the middle of the banquet , like the spectre bridegroom—'the worms they crawled in , and the worms they crawled out , ' eh ? Well , I like your pluck , but , ahem — I'm afraid you 'll find they 've rather an unpleasant way of laying your kind of apparitions . "
100985	100991	100993	100993	Paul	57	" Never mind about that , "
100996	101017	100993	100993	Paul	57	" I have something I must tell you — I've no time to lose . I 'm a desperate man ! "
101018	101022	101023	101023	Paradine	75	" You are , "
101030	101081	101023	101023	Paradine	75	" oh , you are indeed ! ' a desperate man . ' Capital ! a stern chase , eh ? the schoolmaster close behind with the birch ! It 's quite exciting , you know , but , seriously , I 'm very much afraid you 'll catch it ! "
101082	101085	101087	101088	Mr. Bultitude	57	" If , "
101093	101136	101087	101088	Mr. Bultitude	57	" if I was to tell you that I was not myself at all — but somebody else , a — in fact , an entirely different person from what I seem to you to be — I suppose you would laugh ? "
101137	101143	101145	101150	his brother - in - law	318	" I beg your pardon , "
101153	101164	101145	101150	his brother - in - law	318	" I do n't think I quite catch the idea . "
101165	101205	101087	101088	Mr. Bultitude	57	" When I assure you now , solemnly , as I stand here before you , that I am not the miserable boy whose form I am condemned to — to wear , you 'll say it is incredible ? "
101206	101261	101087	101088	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Not at all — by no means , I quite believe you . Only ( really it 's a mere detail ) , but I should rather like to know , if you 're not that particular boy , what other boy you may happen to be . You 'll forgive my curiosity . "
101262	101292	101145	101150	his brother - in - law	318	" I 'm not a boy at all — I'm your own unhappy brother - in - law , Paul ! You do n't believe me , I see . "
101293	101339	101087	101088	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Oh , pardon me , it 's perfectly clear ! you 're not your own son , but your own father — it 's a little confusing at first , but no doubt common enough . I 'm glad you mentioned it , though . "
101340	101344	101346	101346	Paul	57	" Go on , "
101349	101373	101346	101346	Paul	57	" make light of it — you fancy you are being very clever , but you will find out the truth in time ! "
101374	101384	101386	101386	Paradine	75	" Not without external assistance , I 'm afraid , "
101389	101402	101386	101386	Paradine	75	" A more awful little liar for your age I never saw ! "
101403	101410	101412	101412	Paul	57	" I 'm tired of this , "
101414	101423	101412	101412	Paul	57	" Only listen to reason and common sense ! "
101424	101431	101386	101386	Paradine	75	" Only give me a chance . "
101432	101437	101439	101439	Paul	57	" I tell you , "
101442	101479	101488	101489	the other	2428	" it 's the sober awful truth — I'm not a boy , it 's years since I was a boy — I'm a middle - aged man , thrust into this , this humiliating form . "
101480	101486	101488	101489	the other	2428	" Do n't say that , "
101491	101505	101488	101489	the other	2428	" it 's an excellent fit — very becoming , I assure you . "
101506	101519	101521	101521	Paul	57	" Do you want to drive me mad with your clumsy jeers ? "
101523	101541	101521	101521	Paul	57	" Look at me . Do I speak , do I behave , like an ordinary schoolboy ? "
101542	101556	101558	101559	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" I really hope not — for the sake of the rising generation , "
101569	101587	101589	101589	Paul	57	" You are very jaunty to - day — you look as if you were well off , "
101592	101699	101589	101589	Paul	57	" I remember a time when a certain bill was presented to me , drawn by you , and appearing to be accepted ( long before I ever saw it ) by me . I consented to meet it for my poor Maria 's sake , and because to disown my signature would have ruined you for life . Do you remember how you went down on your knees in my private room and swore you would reform and be a credit to your family yet ? You were n't quite so well off , or so jaunty then , unless I am very much mistaken . "
101735	101740	101741	101741	he	74	" You young hound ! "
101752	101840	101741	101741	he	74	" How did you get hold of that — that lying story ? Your father must have let it out ! Why do you bring up bygones like this ? You — you're a confounded , disagreeable little prig ! Who told you to play an ill - natured trick of this sort on an uncle , who may have been wild and reckless in his youth — was in fact — but who never , never misused his relation towards you as — as an uncle ? "
101841	101851	101853	101853	Paul	57	" How did I get hold of the story ? "
101862	101996	101853	101853	Paul	57	" Do you think if I were really a boy of thirteen I should know as much about you as I do ? Do you want to know more ? Ask , if you dare ! Shall I tell you how it was you left your army coach without going up for examination ? Will you have the story of your career in my old friend Parkinson 's counting - house , or the real reason of your trip to New York , or what it was that made your father add that codicil , cutting you off with a set of engravings of the ' Rake 's Progress , ' and a guinea to pay for framing them ? I can tell you all about it , if you care to hear . "
101997	102000	101741	101741	he	74	" No ! "
102004	102042	101741	101741	he	74	" I wo n't listen . When you grow up , ask your father to buy you a cheap Society journal . You 're cut out for an editor of one . It does n't interest me . "
102043	102052	102054	102054	Paul	57	" Do you believe my story or not ? "
102056	102067	102069	102070	the other	2428	" I do n't know . Who could believe it ? "
102073	102082	102069	102070	the other	2428	" How can you possibly account for it ? "
102083	102102	102104	102104	Paul	57	" Do you remember giving Maria a little sandal - wood box with a small stone in it ? "
102106	102126	102104	102104	Paul	57	" I have some recollection of giving her something of that kind . A curiosity , was n't it ? "
102127	102163	101741	101741	he	74	" I wish I had never seen it . That infernal stone , Paradine , has done all this to me . Did no one tell you it was supposed to have any magic power ? "
102164	102241	102104	102104	Paul	57	" Why , now I think of it , that old black rascal , Bindabun Doss , did try to humbug me with some such story ; said it was believed to be a talisman , but the secret was lost . I thought it was just his stingy way of trying to make the rubbish out as something priceless , as it ought to have been , considering all I did for the old ruffian . "
102242	102283	101741	101741	he	74	" You told Maria it was a talisman . Bindabun what's - his - name was right . It is a talisman of the deadliest sort . I 'll soon convince you , if you will only hear me out . "
102508	102511	102512	102512	he	57	" Well , "
102535	102568	102512	102512	he	57	" suppose I were to say that I think there may be something in this story of yours , what then ? What is it you want me to do for you ? "
102569	102572	102574	102574	Paul	57	" Why , "
102576	102613	102512	102512	he	57	" with all you owe to me , now you know the horrible injustice I have had to bear , you surely do n't mean to say that you wo n't help me to right myself ? "
102614	102625	102512	102512	he	57	" And if I did help you , what then ? "
102626	102643	102645	102646	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Why , I should be able to recover all I have lost , of course , "
102661	102675	102648	102648	He	57	" Ah , but I mean , what 's to become of me ? "
102676	102679	102681	102681	Paul	57	" You ? "
102691	102724	102681	102681	Paul	57	" Well , hum , from what I know and what you know that I know about your past life , you ca n't expect me to encourage you to remain here ? "
102725	102728	102730	102731	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" No , "
102733	102743	102730	102731	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" Of course not ; very right and proper . "
102744	102747	102749	102749	Paul	57	" But , "
102758	102793	102749	102749	Paul	57	" anything I can do to advance your prospects — such as paying your passage out to New York , you know , and so on — I should be very ready to do . "
102794	102798	102800	102801	the other	2428	" Thank you ! "
102803	102823	102825	102825	Paul	57	" And even , if necessary , provide you with a small fund to start afresh upon — honestly , "
102827	102838	102825	102825	Paul	57	" you will not find me difficult to deal with . "
102839	102846	102848	102848	Paradine	75	" It 's a dazzling proposition , "
102851	102951	102848	102848	Paradine	75	" You have such an alluring way of putting things . But the fact , is , you 'll hardly believe it , but I 'm remarkably well off here . I am indeed . Your son , you know , though not you ( except as a mere matter of form ) , really makes , as they say of the marmalade in the advertisements , an admirable substitute . I doubt , I do assure you , whether you yourself would have received me with quite the same warmth and hospitality I have met with from him . "
102952	102957	102959	102959	Paul	57	" So do I , "
102961	102965	102959	102959	Paul	57	" very much . "
102966	103026	102848	102848	Paradine	75	" Just so ; for , without your admirable business capacity and extraordinary firmness of character , you know , he has , if you 'll excuse my saying so , a more open guileless nature , a more entire and touching faith in his fellow - man and brother - in - law , than were ever yours . "
103027	103034	103036	103036	Paul	57	" To say that to me , "
103039	103047	103036	103036	Paul	57	" is nothing less than sheer impudence . "
103048	103265	102848	102848	Paradine	75	" My dear Paul ( it does seem deuced odd to be talking to a little shrimp like you as a grown - up brother - in - law . I shall get used to it presently , I daresay ) . I flatter myself I am a man of the world . We 're dealing with one another now , as the lawyers have it , at arm 's length . Just put yourself in my place ( you 're so remarkably good at putting yourself in other people 's places , you know ) . Look at the thing from my point of view . Accidentally dropping in at your offices to negotiate ( if I could ) a small temporary loan from anyone I chanced to meet on the premises , I find myself , to my surprise , welcomed with effusion into what I then imagined to be your arms . More than that , I was invited here for an indefinite time , all my little eccentricities unmentioned , overlooked . I was deeply touched ( it struck me , I confess , at one time that you must be touched too ) , but I made the best use of my opportunities . I made hay while the sun shone . "
103266	103277	103279	103279	Paul	57	" Do you mean to make me lose my temper ? "
103281	103289	103279	103279	Paul	57	" It will not take much more . "
103290	103392	103393	103393	Paul	57	" I have no objection . I find men as a rule easier to deal with when they have once lost their temper , their heads so often go too . But to return : a man with nerve and his fair share of brains , like myself , only wants a capitalist ( he need not be a millionaire ) at his back to conquer the world . It 's not by any means my first campaign , and I 've had my reverses , but I see victory in my grasp , sir , in my grasp at last ! "
103396	103501	103393	103393	Paul	57	" Now you — it 's not your fault , I know , a mere defect of constitution ; but you , as a speculator , were , if I may venture to put it so , not worth your salt ; no boldness , no dash , all caution . But your promising son is a regular whale on speculation , and I may tell you that we stand in together in some little ventures that would very probably make your hair stand on end — you would n't have touched them . And yet there 's money in every one of them . "
103502	103506	103508	103508	Paul	57	" My money ! "
103511	103520	103508	103508	Paul	57	" and it wo n't come out again . "
103521	103534	103536	103536	Marmaduke	75	" You do n't know much about these things , you see , "
103538	103553	103536	103536	Marmaduke	75	" I tell you I have my eye on some fine openings for capital . "
103554	103565	103567	103567	Paul	57	" Your pockets always were very fine openings for capital , "
103569	103645	103652	103653	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Ha , ha , deuced sharp that ! But , to come to the point , you were always a sensible practical kind of a fellow , and you must see , that , for me to back you up and upset this young rascal who has stepped into your slippers , might be morally meritorious enough , but , treating it from a purely pecuniary point of view , it 's not business . "
103646	103650	103652	103653	Mr. Bultitude	57	" I see , "
103656	103663	103652	103653	Mr. Bultitude	57	" then you side against me ? "
103664	103685	103652	103653	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Did I ever say I would side against you ? Let us hear first what you propose to do . "
103759	103770	103772	103772	Paradine	75	" A good idea that , Paul , my boy , "
103776	103823	103772	103772	Paradine	75	" but you do n't imagine our young friend would be quite such an idiot as not to see your game ! Why , he would pitch the Stone in the gutter or stamp it to powder , rather than let you get hold of it . "
103824	103832	103834	103834	Paul	57	" He 's quite capable of it , "
103836	103883	103772	103772	Paradine	75	" in fact , he threatened to do worse than that . I doubt if I shall ever be able to manage it myself ; but what am I to do ? I must try , and I 've no time to lose about it either . "
103884	103890	103892	103892	Marmaduke	75	" I tell you this , "
103894	103941	103892	103892	Marmaduke	75	" if you let him see you here , it 's all up with you . What you want is some friend to manage this for you , some one he wo n't suspect . Now , suppose I were willing to risk it for you ? "
103942	103945	103947	103947	Paul	57	" You ! "
103953	103957	103959	103959	Marmaduke	75	" Why not ? "
103967	104240	103959	103959	Marmaduke	75	" Ah , I see , you ca n't trust me . You 've got an idea into your head that I 'm a thorough - paced rascal , without a trace of human feeling about me . I daresay I deserve it , I daresay I do ; but it 's not generous , my boy , for all that . I hope to show you your mistake yet , if you give me the chance . You allow yourself to be prejudiced by the past , that 's where you make your mistake . I only put before you clearly and plainly what it was I was giving up in helping you . A fellow may have a hard cynical kind of way of putting things , and yet , take my word for it , Paul , have a heart as tender as a spring chicken underneath . I believe I 'm something like that myself . I tell you I 'm sorry for you . I do n't like to see a family man of your position in such a regular deuce of a hole . I feel bound to give you a lift out of it , and let my prospects take their own chance . I leave the gratitude to you . When I 've done , kick me down the doorsteps if you like . I shall go out into the world with the glow of self - approval ( and rapid motion ) warming my system . Take my advice , do n't attempt to tackle Master Dick yourself . Leave him to me . "
104241	104254	104256	104256	Paul	57	" If I could only make up my mind to trust you ! "
104258	104263	104265	104265	Marmaduke	75	" The old distrust ! "
104267	104329	104265	104265	Marmaduke	75	" you ca n't forget . You wo n't believe a poor devil like me can have any gratitude , any disinterestedness left in him . Never mind , I 'll go . I 'll leave it to you . I 'll send Dick in here , and we shall see whether he 's such a fool as you think him . "
104330	104333	104335	104335	Paul	57	" No , "
104337	104351	104335	104335	Paul	57	" no ; I feel you 're right ; that would never do . "
104352	104363	104365	104366	the other	2428	" It would be for my advantage , I think , "
104368	104404	104365	104366	the other	2428	" but you had better take me while I am in a magnanimous mood , the opportunity may never occur again . Come , am I to help you or not ? Yes or no ? "
104405	104410	104412	104412	Paul	57	" I must accept , "
104415	104448	104412	104412	Paul	57	" I ca n't find Boaler now , and it might take hours to make him see what I wanted . I 'll trust to your honour . What shall I do ? "
104449	104488	104365	104366	the other	2428	" Do ? Get away from this , he 'll be coming in here very soon to see me . Run away and play with the children or hide in the china closet — anything but stay here . "
104489	104502	104504	104504	Paul	57	" I — I must be here while you are managing him , "
104506	104509	104511	104511	Paradine	75	" Nonsense ! "
104514	104563	104511	104511	Paradine	75	" I tell you it will spoil all , unless you — who 's that ? it 's his step — too late now — dash it all ! Behind that screen , quick — don't move for your life till I tell you you may come out ! "
104688	104694	104695	104695	he	60	" So here you are ! "
104698	104735	104695	104695	he	60	" Been lookin ' for you everywhere . What 's good of shutting ' self in here ? Come up and play gamesh . No ? Come in and have shupper . I 've had shupper . "
104736	104741	104743	104744	Uncle Marmaduke	74	" So I perceive , "
104754	104760	104762	104764	the wretched Dick	60	" Tell y'what I did , "
104766	104878	104762	104764	the wretched Dick	60	" You know I never did get what I call regular good blow out — always some one to shay ' had quite ' nough ' ' fore I 'd begun . So I thought this time I would have a tuck - in till — till I felt tired , and I — he - he - he — I got down ' fore anybody elsh and helped myshelf . Had first go - in . No one to help to thingsh . No girlsh to bother . It was prime ! When they 've all gone up again you and me'll go in and have shome more , eh ? "
104879	104886	104888	104889	his uncle	2131	" You 're a model host , "
104891	104898	104899	104899	Dick	60	" It 's a good shupper , "
104903	105047	104899	104899	Dick	60	" I ought to know . I 've had some of everything . It'sh almost too good for kids . But it'sh a good thing I went in first . After I 'd been in a little time I saw a sponge - cake on the table , and when I tried it , what d'ye think I found ? It was as full inside of brandy - an'-sherry as it could be . All it could do to shtand ! I saw d'rectly it washn't in condition come to table , and I said , ' Take it away ! take it away ! It'sh drunk ; it'sh a dishgraceful sight for children ! ' But they would n't take it away ; sho I had to take it away . But you ca n't take away a whole tipshy - cake ! "
105048	105058	105060	105060	Paradine	75	" I am quite sure you did your best , "
105062	105069	105071	105071	Dick	60	" Been having such gamesh upstairs ! "
105077	105116	105071	105071	Dick	60	" That lil ' Dolly Merridew 's jolly girl . Not sho nice as Dulcie , though . Here , you , let'sh go up and let off fireworksh on balcony , eh ? Letsh have jolly lark ! "
105117	105122	105124	105125	his uncle	2131	" No , no , "
105127	105150	105124	105125	his uncle	2131	" You and I are too old for that sort of thing . You should leave the larks to the young fellows . "
105151	105163	105165	105165	Dick	60	" How do you know I 'm too old for sorterthing ? "
105172	105199	105165	105165	Dick	60	" Well , you 're not a young man any longer , you know . You ought to behave like the steady old buffer you look . "
105200	105203	105205	105205	Dick	60	" Why ? "
105207	105259	105205	105205	Dick	60	" why should I behave like shteady ole buffer , when I do n't feel shteady ole buffer ? What do you want shpoil fun for ? Tell you I shall do jus ' zackly wharriplease . And , if you shay any more , I 'll punch y ' head ! "
105260	105265	105267	105268	his uncle	2131	" No , no , "
105276	105292	105267	105268	his uncle	2131	" Come , you 're not going to quarrel with me , I 'm sure ! "
105293	105298	105300	105300	Dick	60	" All ri ' , "
105302	105316	105300	105300	Dick	60	" No ; I won ' quarrel . Don ' wanter quarrel anybody . "
105317	105322	105324	105324	Paradine	75	" That 's right , "
105326	105335	105324	105324	Paradine	75	" I knew you were a noble fellow ! "
105336	105341	105343	105343	Dick	60	" Sho I am , "
105350	105394	105324	105324	Paradine	75	" Sho are you . Nearly ash noble ' sh me . There , you 're jolly good fellow . I say , I 've goo ' mind tell you something . Make you laugh . But I wo n't ; not now . "
105395	105403	105405	105405	Marmaduke	75	" Oh , you can tell me , "
105407	105416	105405	105405	Marmaduke	75	" No secrets between friends , you know . "
105417	105424	105426	105426	Dick	60	" Sha n't tell you now , "
105428	105434	105426	105426	Dick	60	" Keep shecret little longer . "
105435	105472	105473	105473	Dick	60	" Do you know , my friend , that there 's something very odd about you I 've noticed lately ? Something that makes me almost fancy sometimes you 're not what you pretend to be . "
105488	105495	105496	105496	he	60	" Eh , what d'you shay ? "
105499	105503	105496	105496	he	60	" Shay tharragain . "
105504	105510	105512	105512	Marmaduke	75	" You look to me , "
105515	105568	105569	105569	Dick	60	" like some one excellently made up for the part of heavy father , without a notion how to play it . Dick , you young dog , you see I know you ! You ca n't take me in with all this . You 'd better tell me all about it . "
105577	105584	105585	105585	he	60	" You 've found me out , "
105589	105610	105585	105585	he	60	" Then it 's all up . If you 've found me out , everybody elsh can find me out ! "
105611	105681	105496	105496	he	60	" No , no ; it 's not so bad as that , my boy . I 've better eyes than most people , and then I had the privilege of knowing your excellent father rather well once upon a time . You have n't studied his little peculiarities closely enough ; but you 'll improve . By the way , where is your excellent father all this time ? "
105682	105688	105690	105690	Dick	60	" He 's all right , "
105696	105709	105690	105690	Dick	60	" He - he . He 's at school , he is ! "
105710	105757	105496	105496	he	60	" At school . You mean to say you 've put him to school at his time of life ! He 's rather old for that sort of thing , is n't he ? They do n't take him on the ordinary terms , do they ? "
105758	105761	105763	105763	Dick	60	" Ah , "
105765	105785	105763	105763	Dick	60	" that'sh where it is . He is n't old , you see , now , to look at . "
105786	105820	105496	105496	he	60	" Not old to look at ! Then how on earth — — I should like to know how you managed all that . What have you been doing to the poor gentleman ? "
105821	105826	105828	105828	Dick	60	" That'sh my affair , "
105830	105847	105828	105828	Dick	60	" An ' if I don ' tell you you won ' find that out anyway ! "
105848	105860	105862	105862	Paradine	75	" There 's only one way you could have done it , "
105868	105925	105862	105862	Paradine	75	" It must have been done by some meddling with magic . Now what — — Let me see — yes — — Surely the Stone I brought your poor mother from India was given to me as a talisman of some sort ? You ca n't have been sharp enough to get hold of that ! "
105926	105932	105934	105934	Dick	60	" How did you know ? "
105937	105942	105934	105934	Dick	60	" Who told you ? "
105943	105970	105862	105862	Paradine	75	" I am right , then ? Well , you are a clever fellow . I should like to know how you did it , now ? "
105971	105978	105980	105980	Dick	60	" Did it with the Shtone , "
105998	106021	105862	105862	Paradine	75	" All my own idea . No one helped me . It — it washn't sho bad for me , wash it ? "
106022	106029	106031	106031	Marmaduke	75	" Bad ! it was capital ! "
106034	106100	106031	106031	Marmaduke	75	" It was a stroke of genius ! And so my Indian Stone has done all this for you . Sounds like an Arabian Night , by Jove ! By - the - by , you do n't happen to have it about you , do you ? I should rather like to look at it again . It 's a real curiosity after this . "
106140	106146	106147	106147	he	60	" I dareshay you would , "
106150	106173	106147	106147	he	60	" but I 'm not sho green as all that . Do n't let that Stone out of my hands for anyone . "
106174	106190	106192	106192	Marmaduke	75	" Why , I only wanted to look at it for a minute or two , "
106194	106204	106192	106192	Marmaduke	75	" I would n't hurt it or lose it . "
106205	106212	106214	106214	Dick	60	" You won ' get chance , "
106216	106222	106224	106224	Paradine	75	" Oh , very well , "
106227	106261	106224	106224	Paradine	75	" just as you please , it does n't matter ; though when we come to talk things over a little , you may find it better to trust me more than that . "
106262	106269	106271	106271	Dick	60	" Wha ' do you mean ? "
106274	106392	106395	106395	he	60	" Well , I 'll try to explain as well as I can , my boy ( drink a little of this soda water first , it 's an excellent thing after supper ) ; there , you 're better now , are n't you ? Now , I 've found you out , as you see ; but only because I knew something of the powers of this Stone of yours , and guessed the rest . It does n't at all follow that other people , who know nothing at all , will be as sharp ; if you 're more careful about your behaviour in future — unless , unless , young fellow — — "
106399	106403	106405	106405	Dick	60	" Unless what ? "
106408	106421	106405	106405	Dick	60	" Unless I chose to tell them what I 've found out . "
106422	106429	106431	106431	Dick	60	" What would you tell them ? "
106433	106501	106431	106431	Dick	60	" What ? Why , what I know of this talisman ; tell them to use their eyes ; they would n't be very long before they found out that something was wrong . And when one or two of your father 's friends once get hold of the idea , your game will be very soon over — you know that as well as I do . "
106502	106505	106507	106507	Dick	60	" But , "
106509	106531	106507	106507	Dick	60	" you would n't go and do beastly mean thing like that ? I 've not been bad fellow to you . "
106532	106645	106431	106431	Dick	60	" The meanness , my dear boy , depends entirely upon the view you take of it . Now , the question with me , as a man of honour ( and I may tell you an over - nice sense of honour has been a drawback I 've had to struggle against all my life ) , the question with me is this : Is it not my plain duty to step in and put a stop to this topsy - turvy state of things , to show you up as the barefaced young impostor you are , and restore my unhappy brother - in - law to his proper position ? "
106646	106651	106653	106653	Paul	57	" Very well expressed , "
106661	106674	106653	106653	Paul	57	" he has a heart , as he said , after all ! "
106675	106684	106686	106686	Paradine	75	" How does that seem to strike you ? "
106688	106696	106698	106698	Dick	60	" It shtrikes me as awful rot , "
106704	106827	106698	106698	Dick	60	" It 's the language of conscience , but I do n't expect you to see it in the same light . I do n't mind confessing to you , either , that I 'm a poor devil to whom money and a safe and respectable position ( all of which I have here ) are great considerations . But whenever I see the finger of duty and honour and family affection all beckoning me along a particular road , I make a point of obeying their monitions — occasionally . I do n't mean to say that I never have bolted down a back way , instead , when it was made worth my while , or that I never will . "
106828	106838	106840	106840	Paul	57	" I wonder what he 's driving at now , "
106842	106856	106858	106858	Dick	60	" I do n't know about duty and honour , and all that , "
106860	106880	106858	106858	Dick	60	" my head aches , it 's the noise they 're making upstairs . Are you goin' to tell ? "
106881	106954	106698	106698	Dick	60	" The fact is , my dear boy , that when one has had a keen sense of honour in constant use for several years , it 's like most other articles , apt to become a little the worse for wear . Mine is not what it used to be , Dicky ( that 's your name , is n't it ? ) . Our powers fail as we grow old . "
106955	106966	106968	106968	Dick	60	" I don ' know what you 're talking about ! "
106971	106981	106968	106968	Dick	60	" Do tell me what you mean to do . "
106982	106999	107001	107001	Paradine	75	" Well then , your head 's clear enough to understand this much , I hope , "
107006	107049	107001	107001	Paradine	75	" that , if I did my duty and exposed you , you would n't be able to keep up the farce for a single hour , in spite of all your personal advantages — you know that , do n't you ? "
107050	107057	107059	107059	Dick	60	" I shpose I know that , "
107062	107125	107059	107059	Dick	60	" You know too , that if I could be induced — mind , I do n't say I can — to hold my tongue and stay on here and look after you and keep you from betraying yourself by any more of these schoolboy follies , there 's not much fear that anyone else will ever find out the secret — — "
107126	107136	107138	107138	Dick	60	" Which are you going to do , then ? "
107140	107223	107138	107138	Dick	60	" Suppose I say that I like you , that you have shown me more kindness in a single week than ever your respectable father has since I first made his acquaintance ? Suppose I say that I am willing to let the sense of honour and duty , and all the rest of it , go overboard together ; that we two together are a match for Papa , wherever he may be and whatever he chooses to say and do ? "
107264	107270	107272	107272	Dick	60	" Will you say that ? "
107275	107369	107272	107272	Dick	60	" On one condition , which I 'll tell you by - and - by . Yes , I 'll stand by you , my boy , I 'll coach you till I make you a man of business every bit as good as your father , and a much better man of the world . I 'll show you how to realise a colossal fortune if you only take my advice . And we 'll pack Papa off to some place abroad where he 'll have no holidays and give no trouble ! "
107370	107373	107375	107375	Dick	60	" No , "
107378	107393	107375	107375	Dick	60	" I wo n't have that . After all , he 's my governor . "
107394	107432	107272	107272	Dick	60	" Do what you like with him then , he ca n't do much harm . I tell you , I 'll do all this , on one condition — it 's a very simple one — — "
107433	107438	107440	107440	Dick	60	" What is it ? "
107442	107475	107478	107478	Dick	60	" This . You have , somewhere or other , the Stone that has done all this for you — you may have it about you at this very moment — ah ! "
107488	107525	107526	107526	Paul	57	" I thought so ! Well , I want that Stone . You were afraid to leave it in my hands for a minute or two just now ; you must trust me with it altogether . "
107561	107564	107566	107566	Dick	60	" No , "
107568	107580	107566	107566	Dick	60	" I ca n't do that ; I want it too . "
107581	107607	107608	107608	Dick	60	" Why , man , what use is it to you ? it only gives you one wish , you ca n't use it again . "
107623	107635	107637	107638	his uncle	2131	" I suppose I can do that as well as Barbara , "
107640	107665	107637	107638	his uncle	2131	" Come , do n't be obstinate , give me the Stone ; it 's very important that it should be in safe hands . "
107666	107669	107671	107671	Dick	60	" No , "
107685	107693	107674	107674	he	60	" I mean to keep it myself . "
107694	107771	107637	107638	his uncle	2131	" Very well then , I have done with you . To - morrow morning I shall step up to Mincing Lane , and then to your father 's solicitor . I think his offices are in Bedford Row , but I can easily find out at your father 's place . After that , young man , you 'll have a very short time to amuse yourself in , so make the best of it . "
107772	107787	107789	107789	Dick	60	" No , do n't leave me , let me alone for a minute , "
107865	107869	107871	107871	Paradine	75	" Go back ! "
107873	107884	107871	107871	Paradine	75	" You infernal old idiot , you 've ruined everything ! "
107885	107892	107894	107894	Paul	57	" I wo n't go back , "
107896	107920	107894	107894	Paul	57	" I do n't believe in you . I 'll hide no longer . Dick , I forbid you to trust that man . "
107953	108120	107939	107939	he	60	" Badly as you 've treated me , I 'd rather trust you than that shifty plausible fellow there . Just look at me , Dick , and then say if you can let this cruelty go on . If you knew all I 've suffered since I have been among those infernal boys , you would pity me , you would indeed .... If you send me back there again , it will kill me .... You know as well as I do that it is worse for me than ever it could be for you .... You ca n't really justify yourself because of a thoughtless wish of mine , spoken without the least intention of being taken at my word . Dick , I may not have shown as much affection for you as I might have done , but I do n't think I deserve all this . Be generous with me now , and I swear you will never regret it . "
108158	108167	108154	108154	he	60	" Give papa the Stone by all means , "
108171	108212	108169	108169	Paradine	75	" If you do , he will find some one to wish the pair of you back again , and then , back you go to school again , the laughing - stock of everybody , you silly young cub ! "
108213	108222	108224	108224	Paul	57	" Do n't listen to him , Dick , "
108226	108253	108224	108224	Paul	57	" Give it to me , for Heaven 's sake ; if you let him have it , he 'll use it to ruin us all . "
108274	108327	108255	108255	Dick	60	" Papa , I 'm shorry . It is a shame . If I had the Shtone , I really would give it you , upon my word - an'-honour I would . But — but , now I ca n't ever give it up to you . It'sh gone . Losht ! "
108328	108331	108333	108333	Marmaduke	75	" Lost ! "
108335	108352	108333	108333	Marmaduke	75	" When , where ? When do you last recollect seeing it ? you must know ! "
108353	108358	108360	108360	Dick	60	" In the morning , "
108376	108386	108387	108387	he	60	" No ; afternoon . I do n't know , "
108620	108626	108602	108603	The children	2858	" Sir Roger de Coverley , "
108734	108740	108742	108742	Paul	57	" The visitors ' bell ! "
108878	108885	108886	108886	he	57	" It 's all over now , "
108889	108907	108865	108865	He	57	" I 've just seen Dr. Grimstone standing on my doorstep ; he has come after me . "
108916	108926	108927	108927	he	74	" I 'm sorry for you , my friend , "
108930	108939	108927	108927	he	74	" but I really ca n't help it . "
108940	108944	108946	108946	Paul	57	" You can , "
108948	108962	108946	108946	Paul	57	" you can tell him what you know . You can save me . "
108963	108969	108971	108971	Marmaduke	74	" Very poor economy that , "
108974	108996	108971	108971	Marmaduke	74	" I prefer spending to saving , always did . I have my own interests to consider , my dear Paul . "
108997	109000	109003	109004	Mr. Bultitude	57	" Dick , "
109013	109029	109003	109004	Mr. Bultitude	57	" you said you were sorry just now . Will you tell him the truth ? "
109043	109052	109053	109053	he	60	" I dare n't , I dare n't , "
109056	109085	109053	109053	he	60	" I — I ca n't go back to the fellows like this . I 'm afraid to tell him . I — I want to hide somewhere . "
109151	109158	109159	109159	he	57	" Do n't open the door ! "
109162	109179	109159	109159	he	57	" Keep him out , you must n't let him in . It 's Dr. Grimstone . "
109236	109244	109207	109207	he	67	" What name , if you please ? "
109245	109278	109279	109279	he	67	" I must go and ask your Par , then , Master Dick ; there 's time to ' ook it upstairs while I 'm gone . I wo n't say nothing , "
109345	109348	109367	109367	he	57	" Kate Greenaway "
109914	109918	109919	109919	he	205	" Buzzer Dicky , "
109922	109933	109919	109919	he	205	" dear buzzer Dicky , tum ' ome to party ! "
109934	109941	109943	109943	Paul	57	" It 's not brother Dicky , "
109946	109953	109919	109919	he	205	" it 's all a mistake . "
109954	109962	109964	109964	Roly	65	" Oh , but it is though , "
109966	109977	109964	109964	Roly	65	" and you do n't know what Roly 's found . "
109978	109983	109985	109985	Paul	57	" No , no , "
110012	110035	109964	109964	Roly	65	" you shall show me another time . I 'm in a hurry , my boy , I 've got an appointment . "
110036	110045	110047	110048	the child	2694	" Roly 's got something better than that , "
110081	110092	110077	110077	he	57	" Well , what has Roly found — a cracker ? "
110093	110106	110077	110077	he	57	" No , no , better than a cwacker — you guess . "
110107	110113	110115	110115	Paul	57	" I ca n't guess , "
110117	110128	110115	110115	Paul	57	" never mind , I do n't want to know . "
110129	110133	110135	110135	Roly	65	" Well then , "
110137	110140	110135	110135	Roly	65	" there . "
110221	110229	110231	110231	Roly	65	" Is n't it a pitty sing ? "
110242	110248	110250	110251	his father	242	" A very pretty thing , "
110257	110269	110271	110271	he	242	" but it 's mine , Roly , it 's mine ! "
110287	110293	110294	110294	he	65	" It is n't yours , "
110297	110307	110294	110294	he	65	" it 's Roly 's . Roly found it . "
110357	110365	110366	110366	he	57	" Roly shall have it , then , "
110370	110400	110366	110366	he	57	" if he will say after me what I tell him . Say , ' I wish Papa and Brother Dick back as they were before , ' Roly . "
110401	110407	110409	110409	Roly	65	" Ith it a game ? "
110441	110446	110448	110448	Paul	57	" No — yes ! "
110450	110497	110448	110448	Paul	57	" it 's a very funny game ; only do what I tell you . Now say , ' I wish Papa and Brother Dick back again as they were before . ' I 'll give you a sugar - plum if you say it nicely . "
110498	110506	110508	110508	Roly	65	" What sort of sugar - plum ? "
110515	110522	110525	110525	Paul	57	" Any sort you like best ! "
110527	110534	110525	110525	Paul	57	" oh , do get on ! "
110535	110569	110570	110570	he	65	" Lots of sugar - plums , then . ' I with'—I forget what you told me — oh , ' I with Papa and — — ' there'th thomebody tummin ' upsthairs ! "
110575	110596	110570	110570	he	65	" it'h nurth tummin ' to put me to bed . I do n't want to go to bed yet . "
110597	110606	110608	110608	Paul	57	" And you sha n't go to bed ! "
110619	110630	110633	110633	Papa	147	" Never mind nurse , finish the — the game . "
110652	110693	110648	110648	Roly	65	" What a funny — ow , ow , it'h Papa ! it'h Papa ! and he told me it wath Dicky . I 'm afwaid ! Whereth Dicky gone to ? I want Bab , take me to Bab ! "
111041	111046	111047	111047	he	57	" Please , sir , "
111050	111068	111047	111047	he	57	" the schoolmaster gentleman , Master Dick — he've run upstairs , have n't you seen him ? "
111121	111127	111128	111128	he	57	" Do n't be alarmed , "
111145	111178	111128	111128	he	57	" Master Dick is safe enough . I know all about it . Where is Dr. Grimstone ? In the library , eh ? Very well , I will see him there . "
111287	111299	111300	111300	he	57	" I am very glad to see you , Dr. Grimstone , "
111303	111335	111300	111300	he	57	" but your coming at this time forces me to ask if there is any unusual reason for , for my having the — a — pleasure of seeing you here ? "
111336	111349	111351	111352	the Doctor	248	" I am exceedingly distressed to have to say that there is , "
111355	111381	111351	111352	the Doctor	248	" or I should not have troubled you at this hour . Try to compose yourself , my dear sir , to bear this blow . "
111382	111386	111388	111388	Paul	57	" I will , "
111390	111395	111388	111388	Paul	57	" I will try . "
111396	111437	111447	111447	his	57	" The fact is then , and I know how sad a story it must be for a parent 's ear , but the fact is , that your unhappy boy has had the inconceivable rashness to quit my roof . "
111450	111456	111458	111458	Paul	57	" God bless my soul ! "
111460	111467	111458	111458	Paul	57	" You do n't say so ! "
111468	111507	111388	111388	Paul	57	" I do indeed ; he has , in short , run away . But do n't be alarmed , my dear Mr. Bultitude , I think I can assure you he is quite safe at the present moment "
111509	111516	111518	111518	Paul	57	" Thank Heaven , he is ! "
111528	111628	111388	111388	Paul	57	" I should certainly have recaptured him before he could have left the railway station , where he seems to have gone at once , only , acting on information ( which I strongly suspect now was intentionally misleading ) , I drove on to the station on the up - line , thinking to find him there . He was not there , sir , I believe he never went there at all ; but , guessing how matters were , I searched the train , carriage by carriage , compartment by compartment , when it came up . "
111629	111642	111644	111644	Paul	57	" I am very sorry you should have had so much trouble , "
111655	111662	111644	111644	Paul	57	" and so you found him ? "
111663	111668	111670	111671	the Doctor	248	" No , sir , "
111674	111723	111670	111671	the Doctor	248	" I did not find him , but he was there ; he must have been there ! but the shameless connivance of two excessively ill - bred persons , who positively refused to allow me access to their compartment , caused him to slip through my fingers . "
111749	111805	111724	111725	Mr. Bultitude	57	" It was , indeed , but it is of no consequence fortunately . I was forced to wait for the next train , but that was not a very slow one , and so I was able to come on here before a very late hour and acquaint you with what had taken place . "
111806	111812	111814	111814	Paul	57	" Thank you very much , "
111816	111828	111830	111831	the Doctor	248	" It 's a painful thing to occur in a school , "
111836	111840	111842	111842	Paul	57	" Most unfortunate , "
111846	111870	111872	111873	the Doctor	248	" So apt to lead persons who are not acquainted with the facts to imagine that the boy was unhappy under my care , "
111875	111889	111891	111891	Paul	57	" In this case , I assure you , I have no doubts , "
111904	111979	111891	111891	Paul	57	" Very kind of you to say so ; really , it 's a great mystery to me . I certainly , as I felt it my duty to inform you at the time , came very near inflicting corporal punishment upon him this morning — very near . But then he was pardoned on your intercession ; and , besides , the boy would never have run away for fear of a flogging . "
111980	111988	111990	111990	Paul	57	" Oh , no , perfectly absurd ! "
111993	112005	112007	112008	the Doctor	248	" Such a merry , high - spirited lad , too , "
112013	112032	112007	112008	the Doctor	248	" popular with his schoolfellows ; a favourite ( in spite of his faults ) with his teachers . "
112033	112040	112042	112042	Paul	57	" No , was he though ? "
112072	112118	112066	112066	he	57	" All this , added to the comforts ( or , may I say , the luxuries ? ) he enjoyed under my supervision , does make it seem very strange and ungrateful in the boy to take this sudden and ill - considered step . "
112119	112166	112007	112008	the Doctor	248	" Very , indeed ; but do you know , Dr. Grimstone , I ca n't help thinking — and pray do not misunderstand me if I speak plainly — that , perhaps , he had reasons for being unhappy you can have no idea of ? "
112167	112186	112188	112189	the Doctor	248	" He would have found me ready to hear any complaints and prompt to redress them , sir , "
112191	112244	112188	112189	the Doctor	248	" But , now I think of it , he certainly did appear to have something on his mind which he wished to tell me ; but his manner was so strange and he so persistently refused to come to the point , that I was forced to discourage him at last . "
112245	112253	112255	112255	Paul	57	" You did discourage him , indeed ! "
112267	112278	112279	112279	he	57	" Perhaps some of his schoolfellows may have — eh ? "
112283	112288	112290	112291	the Doctor	248	" My dear sir , "
112293	112300	112290	112291	the Doctor	248	" quite out of the question ! "
112301	112307	112309	112309	Paul	57	" Do you think so ? "
112319	112346	112309	112309	Paul	57	" And yet , do you know , some of them did not appear to me to look very — very good - natured , now . "
112347	112362	112364	112365	the Doctor	248	" A more manly , pleasant , and gentlemanly set of youths never breathed ! "
112392	112404	112309	112309	Paul	57	" Curious now that they should have struck you so differently ! "
112405	112414	112416	112416	Paul	57	" They certainly did strike me very differently , "
112418	112425	112416	112416	Paul	57	" But I may be mistaken . "
112426	112449	112309	112309	Paul	57	" You are , my dear sir . And , pardon me , but you had no opportunity of testing your opinion . "
112450	112456	112458	112458	Paul	57	" Oh , pardon me , "
112461	112466	112458	112458	Paul	57	" I had indeed ! "
112467	112472	112474	112475	the Doctor	248	" A cursory visit , "
112477	112532	112474	112475	the Doctor	248	" a formal inspection — you can not fairly judge boys by that . They will naturally be reserved and constrained in the presence of an elder . But you should observe them without their knowledge — you want to know them , my dear Mr. Bultitude , you want to go among them ! "
112566	112570	112572	112573	the Doctor	248	" And now , "
112575	112621	112572	112573	the Doctor	248	" with regard to your misguided boy . I have to tell you that he is here , in this very house . I tracked him here , and , ten minutes ago , saw him with my own eyes at one of your windows . "
112624	112635	112636	112636	you	248	" cried Paul , with a well - executed start ; "
112640	112641	112636	112636	you	248	" "
112652	112657	112636	112636	you	248	" said the Doctor , "
112685	112686	112672	112672	you	0	" "
112692	112696	112689	112689	I	0	" Paul admitted . "
112704	112705	112699	112699	you	0	" "
112748	112749	112750	112750	My	0	" "
112754	112766	112750	112750	My	0	" cried Paul , who saw the conveniences of this theory , "
112780	112781	112750	112750	My	0	" "
112789	112794	112812	112812	You	2230	" said the Doctor , "
112820	112833	112812	112812	You	2230	" The memory of his wrongs overcame Mr. Bultitude for the moment : "
112844	112852	112853	112853	He	2231	" he said , between his teeth . "
112946	113024	112932	112932	I	0	" The Doctor was more angry than an impartial lover of justice might perhaps approve of , but then it must be remembered that he had seen himself completely outwitted and his authority set at nought in a very humiliating fashion . However , his excessive wrath cooled Paul 's own resentment instead of inflaming it ; it made him reflect that , after all , it was he who had the best right to be angry . "
113027	113034	112932	112932	I	0	" he said , rather coldly , "
113062	113062	113056	113056	I	0	"
113200	113208	113210	113210	Paradine	210	" Here he is , my boy , "
113212	113351	113210	113210	Paradine	210	" here 's the scamp who has given us all this trouble ! He came into the billiard - room just now and told me who he was , but I would have nothing to do with him of course . Not my business , as I told him at the time . Then—(I think I have the pleasure of seeing Dr. Grimstone ? just so ) well , then you , sir , arrived — and he made himself scarce . But when I saw him in the act of making a bolt up the area , where he had been taking shelter apparently in the coal - cellar , I thought it was time to interfere , and so I collared him . I have much pleasure in handing him over now to the proper authorities . "
113389	113397	113399	113399	Paul	57	" Stand where you are , sir , "
113404	113423	113399	113399	Paul	57	" No , Dr. Grimstone , allow me — leave him to me for the present , please . "
113424	113430	113432	113432	Paradine	210	" That 's much better , "
113435	113461	113432	113432	Paradine	210	" capital . Keep it up , my boy ; keep it up ! Papa 's as quiet as a lamb now . Go on . "
113514	113528	113529	113529	he	57	" Have the goodness to leave my house at once , will you ! "
113533	113538	113540	113540	Marmaduke	74	" You young fool ! "
113546	113579	113543	113543	his	74	" after all I have done for you , too ! Is this your gratitude ? You know you ca n't get on without me . Take care what you 're about ! "
113580	113594	113596	113596	Paul	57	" If you ca n't see that the tables are turned at last , "
113599	113612	113596	113596	Paul	57	" you 're a duller knave than I take you to be . "
113620	113626	113627	113627	he	74	" It 's a trick , "
113631	113640	113627	113627	he	74	" you want to get rid of me . "
113641	113647	113649	113649	Paul	57	" I certainly intend to , "
113651	113676	113677	113677	Paradine	210	" Are you satisfied ? Do you want proofs — shall I give them — I did just now in the billiard - room ? "
113686	113691	113692	113692	he	210	" You young idiot ! "
113700	113724	113692	113692	he	210	" why did n't you tell me ? What did you let me make a fool of myself like this for , eh ? "
113725	113731	113733	113733	Dick	60	" I did tell you , "
113735	113748	113692	113692	he	210	" only you would n't listen . It just serves you right ! "
113770	113776	113777	113777	he	74	" Only my little joke , "
113782	113826	113777	113777	he	74	" ha , ha , I thought I should take you in ! ... Why , I knew it directly .... I 've been working for you all the time — but it would n't have done to let you see my line . "
113827	113830	113832	113832	Paul	57	" No , "
113834	113846	113832	113832	Paul	57	" it was not a very straight one , as usual . "
113847	113850	113852	113852	Marmaduke	74	" Well , "
113854	113915	113852	113852	Marmaduke	74	" I should n't have stopped Master Dick there if I had n't been on your side , should I now ? I knew you 'd come out of it all right , but I had a difficult game to play , do n't you know ? I do n't wonder that you did n't follow me just at first . "
113916	113923	113925	113925	Paul	57	" You 've lost your game , "
113927	113946	113925	113925	Paul	57	" it 's no use to say any more . So now , perhaps , you 'll go ? "
113947	113952	113954	113954	Paradine	210	" Go , eh ? "
113970	114049	113954	113954	Paradine	210	" oh , very well , just as you please , of course . Let your poor wife 's only brother go from your doors without a penny in the world!—but I warn you that a trifle or so laid out in stopping my mouth would not be thrown away . Some editors would be glad enough of a sensation from real life just now , and I could tell some very odd tales about this little affair ! "
114050	114067	114069	114069	Paul	57	" Tell them , if a character for sanity is of no further use to you , "
114071	114131	114069	114069	Paul	57	" Tell them to anyone you can get to believe you — tell the crossing - sweeper and the policemen , tell your grandmother , tell the horse - marines — it will amuse them . Only , you shall tell them on the other side of my front door . Shall I call anyone to show you out ? "
114148	114157	114158	114158	he	210	" Not on my account , I beg , "
114161	114245	114158	114158	he	210	" Good - bye , Paul , my boy , no more dissolving views . Good - bye , my young friend Richard , it was good fun while it lasted , eh ? like the Servian crown — always a pleasant reminiscence ! Good evening to you , Doctor . By the way , for educational purposes let me recommend a ' Penang lawyer'—buy one as you go back for the boys — just to show them you have n't forgotten them ! "
114339	114342	114344	114345	Mr. Bultitude	87	" Richard , "
114353	114366	114344	114345	Mr. Bultitude	87	" you have not done much to deserve consideration at my hands . "
114367	114372	114374	114375	the Doctor	248	" Or at mine ! "
114378	114381	114383	114383	Dick	60	" No , "
114385	114405	114383	114383	Dick	60	" I know I have n't . I 've been a brute . I deserve a jolly good licking . "
114406	114410	114412	114413	his father	242	" You do , "
114472	114475	114476	114476	he	242	" Well , "
114481	114534	114476	114476	he	242	" you 've acted very wrongly . Because I thought it best that you should not — ahem , leave your studies for this party , you chose to disobey me and alarm your master by defying my orders and coming home by stealth — that was your object , I presume ? "
114535	114540	114542	114542	Dick	60	" Y — yes , "
114557	114562	114542	114542	Dick	60	" that was it . "
114563	114601	114603	114604	the Doctor	248	" You know as well as I do what good cause I have to be angry ; but , if I consent to overlook your conduct this time , if I ask Dr. Grimstone to overlook it too "
114617	114631	114603	114604	the Doctor	248	" will you undertake to behave better for the future — will you ? "
114649	114655	114656	114656	he	60	" Oh , I will ! "
114659	114676	114656	114656	he	60	" I will , really . I never meant to go so far when I began . "
114677	114683	114685	114685	Paul	57	" Then , Dr. Grimstone , "
114687	114788	114685	114685	Paul	57	" you will do me a great favour if you will take no further notice of this . You see the boy is sorry , and I am sure he will apologise to you amply for the grave slight he has done you . And by the way — I should have mentioned it before — but he will have to leave your care at the end of the term for a public school — I intend to send him to Harrow , so he will require some additional preparation , perhaps : I may leave that in your hands ? "
114800	114866	114796	114796	he	62	" I will see to that myself , my dear sir . I am sorry you did not tell me this earlier . But , may I suggest that a large public school has its pitfalls for a boy of your son 's disposition ? And I trust this leniency may not have evil consequences , but I doubt it — I greatly doubt it . "
114909	114912	114913	114913	he	60	" Dad , "
114920	114946	114913	114913	he	60	" you 're a brick ! I do n't deserve any of it , but I 'll never forget this as long as I live . "
114983	114986	114987	114987	he	57	" Well , "
114991	115033	115034	115034	he	57	" prove to me that I have made no mistake . Go back to Crichton House now , work and play well , and try to keep out of mischief for the rest of the term . I trust to you , "
115042	115098	115034	115034	he	57	" while you remain at Market Rodwell , to keep my — my connection with it a secret ; you owe that at least to me . You may probably have — ahem , some inconveniences to put up with — inconveniences you are not prepared for . You must bear them as your punishment . "
115144	115147	115148	115148	he	57	" Mind , "
115151	115206	115148	115148	he	57	" you have been at school all this past week ; you have run away to attend this party , you understand ? Good - bye , my boy , and here 's something to put in your pocket , and another for Jolland ; but he need not know it comes from me . "
115800	115805	115807	115807	his	57	" a little odd . "
116432	116438	116460	116460	she	110	" to see the fellows , "
