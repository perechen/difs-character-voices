9869	10015	9856	9856	he	698	“ though not in its first incidents so grave as we were led to expect , is , in another point of view , very serious . Here is a man , as you have expressed it , ' indifferent ' to his child 's life — animal and spiritual . The mother , with a true Protestant heart , and a fine breast of milk , is longing to nurture her child , and to deliver it from the toils of the Papacy . But the husband , what 's his name ? .... Ginx — Ginx ? a very bad name for a case , by the way — GINX 'S CASE!—this Ginx has given up his child to the Sisters of Misery . How are we to get it away again , without his cooperation ? .... Well , we must try . ”

10072	10097	10067	10067	he	710	“ Oh , yes , Sir Adolphus Stigma is one of our principal supporters , and his son 's heart is thoroughly with us . ”
10153	10198	10131	10132	Mrs. Ginx	75	“ 1 . Whether a summons should be taken out before a magistrate against the Lady Superior of the convent , for enticing away or detaining the infant , under the 56th sect . of 24 and 25 Vict . , c. 100 Or , “
10244	10295	10131	10132	Mrs. Ginx	75	“ 3 . Whether counsel is of opinion that this is a case within Talfourd 's Act , and an application might not be made to the Lord Chancellor , or the Master of the Rolls , on the mother 's behalf for the custody of her child ? And , “
10307	10361	10362	10362	I	0	” Mr. Adolphus Stigma took ten days to consider . Meanwhile , the infant Ambrosius continued to thrive on conventual pap . Then Mr. Stigma wrote his opinion . It was a model for a barrister . You took the advice at your own peril — not his . Therefore I transcribe it . “
10393	10692	10390	10390	I	0	“ 1 . Section 56 of the Act of 24 and 25 Vict . , c. 100 , appears at first sight to be directed against the stealing and abduction of children for marriage , or other improper purposes . It provides that ' Whosoever shall UNLAWFULLY , either by force or fraud , lead or take away , or decoy , or entice away , or detain any child , & c. , with intent to deprive ANY parent , & c. , of the possession of such child'—shall be guilty of felony . It is perfectly clear , that in the case before me , the infant was not , ' by force or fraud , led or taken away , or decoyed , or enticed away . ' The statute , however , uses the word ' detain ; ' and this , it appears to me , has much the same force and intention as the previous words . It is to be noted , however , that it is separated from them by the disjunctive ' or ; ' and , therefore , it might be argued with some plausibility that any act of forceful or fraudulent detention , after notice , by persons who have originally acquired a child 's custody in a lawful way , came within the section . The point is new , and of great importance ; and if the Protestant Detectoral Association feel disposed to try it , they would do so under favorable circumstances in the present case . Should they decide to do so , a written demand should be served upon the authorities of the convent , by the mother , or some one acting on her behalf , to give up the infant . “
10952	11048	11051	11051	I	0	“ 3 . Should the common law remedies fail , resort may perhaps be had to the powers in Chancery under Talfourd 's Act , but on this point I should like to confer with an equity counsel before giving a decided opinion . It has been decided under this Act that the court has power to give the custody of children under seven to the mother . ( Shillito v. Collett , 8 , W. R. 683 - 696 . ) As this infant is but six weeks old it comes within that case . “
11381	11438	11439	11440	Mr. D'ACERBITY	123	“ Mr. Dignam Bailey , Q.C. , ( with whom was Mr. Adolphus Stigma ) , applied for a summons against Mary Dens , commonly called Sister Suspiciosa , of the convent of the Sisters of Misery , in Winkle Street , for abducting and detaining a male child of John Ginx and Mary his wife . “
11449	11491	11446	11446	you	123	“ The learned counsel stated that he was instructed by the Protestant Detectoral Association to apply on behalf of the mother . The case was also watched by the solicitors of the Society for Preventing the Suppression of Women and Children . “
11503	11511	11512	11513	Mr. D'ACERBITY	123	“ Mr. BAILEY . No , sir . “
11525	11552	11553	11554	Mr. D'ACERBITY	123	“ Mr. BAILEY . Perhaps you will allow me , sir , to state the case . The circumstances are peculiar . The fact is — — “
11580	11648	11649	11650	Mr. D'ACERBITY	123	“ Mr. Bailey proceeded to state that the child had been taken by a nun from No . 5 , Rosemary Street , without the mother 's consent , and was now imprisoned in the convent . The father appeared to be indifferent , or to have given a sort of general acquiescence . This was Mrs. Ginx 's thirteenth child , around whom gathered the concentrated affections “
11689	11737	11738	11739	Mr. D'Acerbity	123	“ Mr. Bailey called attention to the consolidated statutes of criminal law , and said he was going for illegal detention rather than abduction , and argued at great length from section 56 . At the conclusion of the argument , after refusing to hear Mr. Stigma , “
11802	11814	11796	11796	He	431	“ Mr. Bailey endeavored to address the magistrate but was stopped . “
11842	11858	11834	11834	I	0	” Mr. D'Acerbity 's law was good , but — what has justice to do with “
11861	11973	11978	11979	the mother	225	” Surely the day after this report appeared the magistrate must have had a letter from the Home Secretary ? The application to the magistrate was far from satisfactory . There had not even been an exposure , and the Windmill Bulletin gayly bantered the Detectoral Association . Meanwhile had happened the grand christening , of which a circumstantial account was in the hands of the council of the Detectoral Association shortly after the ceremony had been performed . Here was a monstrous indignity to a Protestant child ! The account was at once printed , together with a verbatim report of the application to the magistrate as well as one of “
11987	12220	11981	11990	an agent of the Association . ” Board - men	1347	” Board - men paraded the great thoroughfares carrying this appeal : — PROTESTANT DETECTORAL ASSOCIATION . If there was no coherency in this production , it should be noted how little that is of the essence of popular appeal . The metropolis was in an uproar . Meetings were held , subscriptions poured in , dangerous crowds collected in Winkle Street . When Mr. Dignam Bailey , Q. C. , went down to Westminster , to move the Court of Queen 's Bench , multitudes besieged it . Protestant champions and Papal ecclesiastics vied in their efforts to get seats . The writ had gone from judge 's chambers returnable to the full court . Sister Suspiciosa , bearing the infant Ambrosius , and supported by two novices and Father Certificatus , had been smuggled into court through mysterious passages in its rear . Mrs. Ginx also , brought from Rosemary Street by the little man who provided her with a bonnet trimmed with orange - colored ribbons , sat staring with red eyes at her child , now enveloped in a robe that was embroidered with little crosses . Why need I tell you , how dead silence fell upon the Court after the stir caused by the entrance of the judges ; how everybody knew what was coming when a master beneath the bench rose , and called out , “
12231	12280	12228	12229	Mary Ginx	125	” How the Chief Justice , fresh and rosy - looking , then blew his nose in a delicate mauve - colored silk handkerchief : how he tried and discarded half - a - dozen pens , amid breathless silence ; how in his blandest manner he said : “
12287	12379	12284	12285	the Respondent	775	” and Mr. Dignam Bailey , Q. C. , and Mr. Octavius Ernestus , Q. C. , rose together to say that Mr. Ernestus did ! Mr. Ernestus was a Catholic . He was assisted by half - a - dozen counsel . He riddled the affidavits on the other side , and read voluminous ones on his own ; bitterly animadverted upon the absence of an affidavit by the father ; held up to the scorn of a civilized world the course pursued towards his meek and gentle clients by the “
12388	12397	12284	12285	the Respondent	775	” in moving tones referred to the shrinking of “
12411	12495	12602	12602	He	779	” cited cases from the time of Magna Charta , down ; called upon the Court to vindicate Protestant justice , ending his peroration with the aphorism of Lord Mansfield , Fiat justitia ruat caelum . One can not do Justice to Mr. Dignam Bailey 's argument , when after lunch he rose to reply . He was logical and passionate , vindictive and pathetic by turns . He inveighed against the Lady Superior , against her attorneys , against Father Certificatus , against Ginx,—“craven
12506	12601	12602	12602	He	779	freedom,”—against the Roman Catholic religion , the Pope , the Archbishop of Westminster , the Virgin Mary . The Court knew , and every one else knew , that this was pure pyrotechny , and Mr. Bailey knew that best of all ; but , though the Bench is swift to speak , slow to hear , it felt obliged , in a case of this public interest , to sit by , and be witnesses of the exhibition . Mr. Bailey concluded by a play on the aphorism cited by his learned friend . “
12632	12710	12602	12602	He	779	” The Court at once decided that , as the father had confided the custody of the infant to the Sisters of Misery , and did not appear to desire that it should be withdrawn , they , disregarding the religious clouds in which the subject had been too carefully involved on both sides , gave judgment for the defendant , with costs . As they passed out of Court , Mr. Stigma said to his clients , “
12726	12985	12718	12718	I	0	” The infant Ambrosius and his conductors could scarcely reach the convent in safety . The building showed few windows to the street , but they were all broken . What might have happened in a few days , but that Ginx 's Baby took the matter into his own hands , none can say . The treatment to which the little saint was subjected soured his temper . His kind nurses had choked him twice a day with incense , and now he had inhaled for seven hours the air of the Queen 's Bench . On his return to the convent he was hastily fed , and carried to the chapel to give thanks for the victory of the day . Wrapped in a handsome chasuble , they laid him on the steps of the altar . In the most solemn part of the service he coughed , and grew sick . The chasuble was bespattered . When the officiating priest , to save that garment , took the child in his arms , he nefariously polluted the sacerdotal vestments and the altar steps . Then he kicked toward the altar itself , roared lustily , and finally went into convulsions in Sister Suspiciosa 's arms . Like most women , the Lady Superior required her enthusiasm to be fed with success . She began to think that she had been cozened : Ginx 's Baby was too evidently a spiritual miscarriage . He must , like the rest of his family , be , indeed , “
12991	13006	12718	12718	I	0	” Father Certificatus agreed with her . His robes and best chasuble were befouled . “
13017	13021	12718	12718	I	0	” said he ; “
13049	13140	13042	13042	He	1195	” Next morning the solicitors of the Protestant Detectoral Association received a letter from their opponents . In this they said that — presuming Messrs. Roundhead , Roundhead , and Lollard , intended to apply to the Master of the Rolls , the authorities of the convent had decided , after having vindicated themselves in the Queen 's Bench , to give up the child , which would be , for twenty - four hours , at the order and disposal of the Association , and afterwards of his parents . “
13148	13152	13145	13146	our clients	787	” they added , “
13197	13516	13517	13526	a popular , practical peer , of sound Protestant principles	793	” A mass - meeting of Protestants had been summoned for three o'clock on the day designated in the letter of the Papist attorneys , to be held in the Philopragmon Hall . That was the favorite centre of countless movements , both well - meant and well - executed , and of others as futile as they were foolish . Yet one could not say that a larger proportion of the latter were connected with the Hall than existed in as many other human enterprises of any sort . The concession of the Romanists at first dashed the managers of the demonstration . Their grievance was gone . Still there remained topics for a meeting : they would rejoice over victory , and consult about the future of the Protestant Baby . The Secretary was an old hand at these meetings . He planned to import into this one a sensation . Ginx 's Baby , brought from the convent , stripped of his papal swathings and enveloped in a handsome outfit presented by an amiable Protestant Duchess , was placed in a cradle with his head resting on a Bible . I am afraid he was quite as uncomfortable as he had ever been at the convent . When , at the conclusion of the chairman 's speech , in which he informed the audience of their triumph , this exhibition was deftly introduced upon the platform , the huzzas , and clappings , and waving of handkerchiefs were such as even that place had never seen . The child was astounded into quietness . Mr. Trumpeter took the chair — believed by many to be , next to the Queen , the most powerful defender of the faith in the three kingdoms . I never could understand why the newspapers reported his speeches — I can not . When he had done , Lord Evergood , “
13528	13554	13517	13526	a popular , practical peer , of sound Protestant principles	793	” as the Daily Banner alliteratively termed him next morning , rose to move the first resolution , already cut and dried by the committee — “
13594	13650	13652	13652	I	0	” Before Lord Evergood could say a word murmurs arose in every part of the hall . He was a mild , gentlemanly Christian , without guile , and the opposition both surprised and frightened him . He uttered a few sentences in approval of his proposition and sat down . An individual in the gallery shouted—“Sir
13659	13665	13652	13652	I	0	” Cheers , and cries of “
13673	13685	13686	13687	The gentleman	797	” & c. The Chairman , with great blandness , said : “
13713	13786	13701	13701	I	0	” Mr. Valpy , incumbent of St. Swithin's - within , insisted on speaking , but what he said was known only to himself . When he had finished there was an extraordinary commotion . On the platform many ministers and laymen jumped to their feet ; in the hall at least a hundred aspirants for a hearing raised themselves on benches or the convenient backs of friends . The Chairman shouted , “
13804	13894	13895	13896	Mr. Chairman	800	” There seemed to be an unanimous desire to speak . Amid cheers , cries for order , and Kentish fire , you could hear the Rev. Mark Slowboy , Independent , the Rev. Hugh Quickly , Wesleyan , the Rev. Bereciah Calvin , Presbyterian , the Rev. Ezekiel Cutwater , Baptist , calling to the chair . A lull ensued , of which advantage was taken by Mr. Stentor , a well - known Hyde Park orator , who bellowed from a friend 's shoulders in the pit , “
13901	13986	13895	13896	Mr. Chairman	800	” an appeal that was followed by roars of laughter . What was the matter ? Why the proposal to hand over the baby to an Anglican refuge stirred up the blood of every Dissenter present . It was lifting the infant out of the frying - pan and dexterously dropping him into the fire . But the chairman was accustomed to these scenes . He stayed the tumult by proposing that a representative from each denomination should give his opinion to the audience . “
13993	14152	14153	14153	Sir	560	” The loudest cries were for Mr. Cutwater , who stood forth — a weak , stooping , half - halting , little man , with a limp necktie , and trousers puffy at the knees — but with honest use of them , let me say . It is quite credible that if Dr. Watts 's assertion be true that — that arch - enemy was unusually perturbed when Ezekiel Cutwater was upon his . On these he had borne manly contests with evil . Two things — yea , three — were rigid in Ezekiel 's creed ; fire would never have burned them out of him : hatred of Popery , contempt of Anglican priestcraft and apostolic succession , and adhesion to the dogma of adult baptism and total immersion . Whoso should not join with him in these let him be Anathema Maranatha . His eye kindled as he looked at the seething audience . “
14155	14159	14153	14153	Sir	560	” said he , “
14349	14369	14370	14370	Him	812	” The Chairman said that he might as well say that he had authentic information that it was HIM . “
14540	14552	14530	14530	I	0	” said Mr. Cutwater , who knew his cue perfectly well , “
14614	14778	14567	14567	I	0	” By this proposition , which was received with enthusiasm , Ginx 's Baby was to be incontinently pitched into an arena of polemical warfare . Every one was willing that a committee should fight out the question vicariously ; and , therefore , when Mr. Slowboy seconded the amendment , it was carried with loud acclamations . But they were not yet out of the wood . On proceeding to nominate members of the committee , the Unitarians and Quakers claimed to be represented . The platform and the meeting were by the ears again . It was fiercely contended that only Evangelical Christians could have a place in such a work , and many of the nominees declared that they would not sit on a committee with — well , some curious epithets were used . The Unitarians and Quakers took their stand on the Catholic principles embodied in the amendment , and on the fact that Ginx 's Baby had now “
14784	14821	14822	14842	The Branch Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union for promoting the Physical and Spiritual Well - being of Ginx 's Baby	828	” Mr. Cutwater and a few others , moved by the scandal of the dispute , interfered , and the committee was at length constituted to the satisfaction of all parties . It was to be called “
14844	14851	14822	14842	The Branch Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union for promoting the Physical and Spiritual Well - being of Ginx 's Baby	828	” A fourth resolution was adopted , “
14883	14978	14822	14842	The Branch Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union for promoting the Physical and Spiritual Well - being of Ginx 's Baby	828	” This promised well for Master Ginx 's future . The meeting had lasted five hours , and while they were discussing him the child grew hungry . In the tumult every one had forgotten the subject of it , and now it was over , they dispersed without thought of him . But he would not allow those near him at all events to overlook his presence . Some , foreseeing that awkwardness was impending , slipped away ; while three or four stayed to ask what was to be done with him . “
14989	14995	14822	14842	The Branch Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union for promoting the Physical and Spiritual Well - being of Ginx 's Baby	828	” said a Mr. Dove . “
15002	15008	14822	14842	The Branch Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union for promoting the Physical and Spiritual Well - being of Ginx 's Baby	828	” said he , smoothly , “
15027	15076	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” Mr. Dove 's wife was otherwise engaged . The Secretary was unmarried — chambers at Nincome 's Inn . In the midst of their distress a woman who had been hanging about the hall near the platform , came forward and offered to take charge of him , “
15084	15619	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” Every one was relieved . After her name and address had been hastily noted , the Protestant baby was placed in her arms . My Lord Evergood , the Chairman , the clergy , the Secretary , and the mob went home rejoicing . Some hours after , Ginx 's Baby , stripped of the duchess 's beautiful robes , was found by a policeman , lying on a doorstep in one of the narrow streets , not a hundred yards behind the Philopragmon . By an ironical chance he was wrapped in a copy of the largest daily paper in the world . At every breakfast - table in town next morning the report of the great Protestant meeting was read , and a further report , in leaded type , of the discovery of Ginx 's Baby at a later period of the evening by a policeman . A pretty comment on the proceedings ! The Good Samaritan put his patient on his ass and carried him to an inn ; while the priest and the Levite , though the latter looked at him , at least let him alone . To have called a public meeting to discuss his fate before deserting him , would have been a refinement of inhumanity . The committee were rather ashamed when they met . Instant measures were taken to recover the child and place him in good hands . The duchess again provided baby - clothes . The next Sunday sermons were preached on his behalf in a score of chapels . The collections amounted to L 800 , a sum increased by donations and subscriptions to the handsome total of L 1360 10s . 3 1/2d . It will be seen hereafter what the committee did with the baby , but I happen to have an account of what became of the funds . They were spent as follows , according to a balance sheet never submitted to the subscribers : — This left L 108 13s . 9 1/2d . for the baby 's keep . No child could have been more thoroughly discussed , preached and written about , advertised , or advised by counsel ; but his resources dwindled in proportion to these advantages . Benevolent subscribers too seldom examine the financial items of a report : had any who contributed to this fund seen the balance sheet they might have grudged that so little of their bounty went to make flesh , bone , and comfort for the object of it . A cynic would tell them that to look sharply after the disposal of their guerdon was half the gift . Their indifference was akin to that satirized by the poet — In an age of luxury we are grown so luxurious as to be content to pay agents to do our good deeds for us ; but they charge us three hundred per cent . for the privilege . Ginx 's baby had been discovered by a policeman swaddled in a penny paper , distressingly familiar to metropolitan travellers by rail . To omit the details of his treatment at the hands of that great institution , “
15623	16295	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” would be invidious . The member thereof who fell in with him was walking a back street , sighting doors with his bull's - eye . He was provided with massive boots , so that a thief could hear him coming a hundred yards off ; he was personally tall and unwieldy , and a dexterous commissioner had invented a dress designed to enhance these qualities — a heavy coat , a cart - horse belt , and a round cape . He had been carefully drilled not to walk more than three miles an hour . He was not a little startled when the rays of his lamp fell upon a struggling newspaper , out of which , as from a shell , came mysterious cries . He took up a corner of the paper and peeped in upon the face of Ginx 's Baby ; then he occupied a quarter of an hour in embarrassing reflections . A nearly naked child crying in the cold ought to be housed as soon as possible , but X 99 was ON HIS BEAT , and those magic words chained him to certain limits . This , of course , was the rule under a former commissioner , and every one knows that such absurd strategy has been abolished in the existing regime . At that time , however , each watchman had his beat , to leave which was neglect of duty , except with a prisoner , and then it was neglect of all the householders within the magic compass . Had X 99 heard the baby crying across the street , which was part of the beat of X 101 , he would have passed on with a cheery heart , for the case would have been beyond his jurisdiction . Unhappily the baby was on his beat , and he was delivered from the temptation of transferring it to the other by the appearance of X 101 's bull's - eye not far off . What was he to do ? The station was a mile away — the inspector would not arrive for an hour — and it would be awkward , if not undignified , to carry on his rounds a shouting baby wrapped in the largest daily paper . If he left it where it was , and it perished , he might be charged with murder . He was at his wits ' end — but having got there , he resolved on the simplest process , namely to carry it to the station . No provision was made by the regulations of the force to protect a beat casually deserted even for a proper purpose . Hence , while X 99 was absent on his errand of mercy , the valuable shop of Messrs. Trinkett and Blouse , ecclesiastical tailors , was broken into , and several stoles , chasubles , altar - cloths and other decorative tapestries were appropriated to profane uses . At the station the baby was disposed of according to rule . Due entry was first made in the night - book by the superintendent of all the particulars of his discovery . Some cold milk was then procured and poured down the child 's throat . Afterwards , wrapped in a constable 's cape , he was placed in a cell where , when the door was locked , he could not disturb the guardians of the peace . The same night , in the next cell , an innocent gentleman , seized with an apoplexy in the street but entered in the charge - sheet as drunk and incapable , died like a dog . When the committee met , every one discovered his incongruity with the rest . Each was disposed to treat Ginx 's Baby in a different way — in other words , each wished to reflect the views of his particular sect on the object of their charity . They were a new “
16299	16774	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” agreed only in hatred to Popery . Finding at their first meeting that the discussion needed to be brought into a focus , the committee appointed three of their number to draw up a minute of the matters to be argued . This committee reported that there arose , respecting the child , the following questions : — This programme , it appeared to its concoctors , embraced everything that concerned Ginx 's Baby except his death by the act of God or the Queen 's enemies . No sooner was the report made than adopted . Then a member , eager for the fray , moved the postponement of the first division of questions until the others had been determined . Why should apostles of truth trouble themselves to serve tables ? These were very subordinate questions to them — though , I think , of first importance to Ginx 's Baby . It was decided to discuss little Ginx 's future before considering his present . The ball was opened by the Venerable Archdeacon Hotten , who , amid much excitement , contended that from the earliest buddings of thought in an infant mind religion should be engrafted upon it ; there could be no education worth the name that was not religious . That with the A should be taught the origin , and with the Z the final destiny and destruction , of evil . To separate education from religion was to clip the wings of the heavenly dove . He asserted that the committee ought at once to have the child baptized in Westminster Abbey , though he was rather of opinion that the previous baptism was canonically valid ; that he should be taught the truths of our most holy faith , and since there could be no faith without a creed , and the only national creed was that of the Church of England , the baby should be handed over to the care of a clergyman , and then be sent to a proper religious school . He need not say that he excluded Rugby under its then profane management . The Church was , however , divided against itself , for the Dean of Triston said he would give more latitude than his very reverend brother . You ought not to define in an infant mind a rigid outline of creed . In fact , he did not acknowledge any creed , he was not obliged to by law and was disinclined to by his reason . He would rather allow the inner seeds of natural light — the glorious all - pervading efflorescence of the Deity in all men 's hearts , to grow within the young spirit . The Dean was assuredly vague and far less earnest than his brother cleric . The “
16776	17641	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” Mr. Bumpus , Unitarian , met the suggestions of the Archdeacon with the scorn they merited . It was impossible to apply to a representative child of an enlightened age theories so long exploded . The Dean had certainly come nearer the truth with that broad sympathy for which he was noted . He himself proposed that the child should be made a model nursling of the liberalism of a new era . Old things were passing away;—all things had become new . Creeds were the discarded banners of a mediaeval past , fit only to be hung up in the churches , and looked at as historic monuments ; never more to be flaunted in the front of battle ! The education of the day was that which taught a man the introspection whereby he recognized the Divine within himself — under any aspect , under any tuition , whether of Brahma , Confucius , or Christ . Truth was kaleidoscopic , and varied with the media through which it was viewed . As for the child , every aspect of truth and error should be allowed to play upon his mind . Let him acquire ordinary school learning for fifteen years , and then send him to the London University . Here the Chairman , and half - a - dozen members of the committee , protested that the said University was a school of the devil , and several interchanges of discourtesy took place . Mr. Shortt , M. P. , begged to suggest , as a matter of business , that for the present the child was not capable of receiving any ideas whatever , and might die , or prove to be dumb , or an idiot , and so require no education . Ought they not to postpone this discussion until the subject was old enough to be worth consideration ? It was Mr. Shortt 's habit to show his practical vein by business - like obstructions of this kind . He had been able a score of times to demonstrate to the House of Commons how silly it was to consider probabilities . In fact , he was opposed heart and soul to prophetic legislation ; he would live , legislatively , from hand to mouth . But the committee would not allow Mr. Shortt to run away with the bone of contention . The Rev. Dr. M'Gregor Lucas , of the National Caledonian Believers , had been silent too long to contain himself further . This man needs some particular description whenever his name is made public . Nay , for this he lives , and by it , some think . At all events , he appears to be equally eager for rebuke and applause ; they both involve notoriety , and notoriety is sure to pay . Few absurdities had been overlooked by his shallow ingenuity . Simply to have invested his limited mental endowments in trying to make the world believe him a genius , would have been only so like what many thousands are doing as to have absolved him from too harsh a judgment ; but he traded in perilous stuff . Cheap prophecy was his staple . It was his wo nt to give out about once in five years , that the world would shortly come to an end , and , like Mr. Zadkiel , he found people who thought their inevitable disappointment a proof of his inspiration . Had you heard the honeyed words dropping from his lips , you would have taken him for a Scotch angel , and , consequently , a rarity . Could such lips utter harsh sayings , or distil vanities ? Show him a priest , and you would hear ! The Pope was his particular born foe ; Popery his enemies ' country — so he said . It was safe for him to stand and throw his darts . No one could say whether they hit or did not ; while most spectators had the good will to hope that they did . How he would have lived if Daniel and St. John had dreamed no dreams , one can not conjecture . As it was , they provided the doctor with endless openings for his fancy . Since no one could solve the riddle of their prophecies , it was certain that no one could disprove his solutions . Yet these came so often to their own disproof by lapse of time , that I can only think that the good doctor hoped to die before his critical periods came , or was so clever as to trust the infallibility of human weakness . I describe Dr. Lucas at so great a length , because it will be easier and more edifying to the reader to conceive what he said , than for me to recount it . He showed the Baby to be one of seven mysteries . He was in favor of teaching him at once to hate idolatry , music , crosses , masses , nuns , priests , bishops , and cardinals . The “
17644	17655	15024	15025	Mr. Dove	145	” the Shorter Catechism , the Confession of Faith , and “
17662	17704	17705	17705	I	0	” would , in his opinion , be the books to lay the groundwork in the child 's mind of a Christian character of the highest type . Mr. Ogle , M. P. , here vigorously intervened . Said he : — “
17914	17926	17931	17931	you	560	” The Rev. Theodoret Verity , M.A. , rose in anger . “
18068	18087	18030	18030	you	560	” & c. & c. Mr. Verity has been saying the same thing any time these forty years . “
18091	18096	18030	18030	you	560	” replied Mr. Ogle , “
18854	19116	18850	18850	I	0	” This straightforward speech fell like a new apple of discord in the midst of the committee . Angry knots were formed , and the noble chairman found that he could not restore order . An adjournment was agreed to . Luckily for the body of Ginx 's Baby , he had been meanwhile sent to a home where Protestant money secured to him for the time good living , while his benefactors were discussing what to do with his soul . Surely , it were no impertinence to interrupt this history and advert to the fact , that , in the discussion just related , every one was to some extent right and to some extent agreed . That religious teaching was due to an immortal spirit — some notion and evidence of the Divine and the Great Hereafter to be conveyed to it — scarce was disputed . Nor was there collision over the necessity of what is called intellectual cultivation . The boy must be taught something of the world in which he was to live ; nay , this latter knowledge seemed to be most immediately practical . As each disputant fixed his eye on one or the other aim that end appeared to him to be the most important . Hence , by a natural lapse , they came to treat subjects as antagonistic which were , in fact , parallel and quite consistent . The one called the others godless — the others threw back the aspersion of bigotry . Then came complication . What was “
19119	19571	18850	18850	I	0	” Intellectual culture they could agree about — it embraced well - known areas ; but this religion divided itself into many disputable fields . These brother Protestants were like country neighbors who must encounter each other at fairs , markets , meets , and balls , and smile and greet , though each , at heart , is looking savagely at the other 's landmarks , and most are very likely fighting bitter lawsuits all the while . It was because religion meant CREED to most members of the committee , and because it so implies to the vast bodies they represented , that they could not come to terms about Ginx 's Baby or any other infantile immortal . Not always , perhaps , but often , they fought for futile distinctions . Had Mahomet 's creed consisted of but one article , There is one God , the blood of many nations might never have given testimony against the creed they resented when to it he tacked and Mahomet is His prophet . Could Protestants but consent to agree in their agreement and peacefully differ in their petty differences , how would the aggregated impulse of a simple faith roll down before it all the impediments of error ! When Ginx 's Baby had grown to a discretionary age , and was at all able to know truth from error — supposing that to be knowable — there were in the country fifty thousand reverend gentlemen of every tincture of religious opinion who might ply him with their various theories , yet few of these would be contented unless they could seize him while his young nature was plastic , and try to imprint on immortal clay the trade - mark of some human invention . The Committee of the Protestant Detectoral Union on Ginx 's Baby held twenty - three meetings . They were then as far from unity of purpose as when they set out . Variety was given to the meetings by the changing combinations of members in attendance . The finances were little heeded in the intensity of their zeal for truth . These at length fell altogether into the hands of the association 's secretary , and we have seen involved large items of expense . The twenty - three meetings extended over a year . At the end of that time the secretary startled the committee by laying on the table a demand for the board and keep of the Protestant baby for three months , amounting to L 36 ; and adding that the sum in hand was L 1 , 4s . 4 1/2d . In his report he said : “
19660	19778	19637	19638	Dr. Gooddee	169	” The secretary asked the committee to provide the money to discharge the baby 's liabilities ; but they instantly adjourned , and no effort could afterwards get a quorum together . When the persons who had charge of the Protestant foundling discovered the state of affairs they began to dun the secretary and to neglect the child , now about thirteen months old and preparing to walk . Since no money appeared they sold whatever clothes had been provided for him , and absconded from the place where they had been farming him for Protestantism . The secretary , by chance hearing of this , was discreet enough to make no inquiries . Ginx 's Baby , “
19784	19999	19637	19638	Dr. Gooddee	169	” vanished from the world . I never heard that any one was asked what had been done with the funds ; but I have already furnished the account that ought to have been rendered . One night , near twelve o'clock , a shrewd tradesman , looking out of his shopdoor before he turned into bed , heard a cry which proceeded from a bundle on the pavement . This he discovered to be an infant wrapt in a potato - sack . He was quick enough to observe that it had been deftly laid over a line chiselled across the pavement to the corner of his house , which line he knew to be the boundary between his own parish of St. Simon Magus and the adjacent parish of St. Bartimeus . He took note , being a business man , of the exact position of the child 's body in relation to this line , and then conveyed it to the workhouse of the other parish . The infant borne to the workhouse of St. Bartimeus was Ginx 's Baby . When he had been placed on the floor of the matron 's room , and examined by the master , that official turned to the unwelcome bearer of the burden . “

20150	20159	20143	20143	You	891	” Mr. Snigger turned to leave the room . “
20166	20171	20143	20143	You	891	” said Mr. Doll ; “
20237	20244	20222	20223	The coroner	908	” He hurried from the room . “
20247	20252	20253	20253	I	0	” shouted the master , “
20286	20513	20272	20272	We	911	” Mr. Doll was in the street and out of hearing . The Guardians of St. Bartimeus met the day after Mr. Doll 's clever stratagem . Among other business was a report from the master of the workhouse that a child , name unknown , found by Mr. Doll , cheesemonger , of Nether Place , in the Parish of St. Simon Magus , opposite his shop , and , as he alleged , on the nearer side of the parish boundary , had been left at the workhouse , and was now in the custody of the matron . The Guardians were not accustomed to restrain themselves , and did not withhold the expression of their indignation upon this announcement . As Mr. Doll had himself been a guardian of St. Simon Magus , it was clear to their impartial minds that he was trying by a trick to foist a bastard — perhaps his own — on the wrong parish . Mr. Cheekey , a licensed victualler , moved that the master 's report be put under the table . Mr. Slinkum , draper , seconded the motion . Mr. Edge , ironmonger , pointed out that there was no parliamentary precedent for such a disposition of the report , and , further , that such action did not dispose of the baby . “
20516	20525	20272	20272	We	911	” said Mr. Cheekey , turning painfully red , “
20550	20576	20577	20577	He	914	” A churchwarden , who happened to be a gentleman , explained that the Board could not dismiss the question in so summary a way . “
20629	20756	20626	20627	their solicitor	918	” This gentleman was sent for post haste . Meanwhile the baby was ordered to be brought in for inspection . The matron had handed him over to a sort of half - witted inmate of the house , whose wits , however , were strangely about him at the wrong time , to nurse and amuse him . This person brought Ginx 's Baby into the Board - room , and placed him on the table . The Board of Guardians took a good look at him . He was not then in fair condition . He was limp , he was dirty , hollow in the cheeks , white , stiff in his limbs , and half - naked—(to be regardless of gender ) — “
20759	20769	20626	20627	their solicitor	918	” said Mr. Stink , who was a dog - breeder—“What
20774	20787	20626	20627	their solicitor	918	” This brutal joke was well received by some of the Guardians . “
20791	20800	20626	20627	their solicitor	918	” answered the half - wit , gravely , “
20852	20862	20846	20846	you	921	” This pleasantry was less acceptable to the Board . “
20865	20881	20882	20882	I	0	” said Mr. Scoop , grocer , a great stickler for parliamentary modes of procedure , “
20888	20889	20882	20882	I	0	” “
20894	20899	20902	20902	I	0	” said Mr. Stink . “
20905	20916	20902	20902	I	0	” said the half - wit , his eyes twinkling . “
20927	20929	20902	20902	I	0	” exclaimed Scoop—“clear
20935	20974	20923	20924	that man	923	” Davus was expelled , and the baby was then formally consigned to the care of a committee . By this time the legal adviser came in . The facts having been stated to him , he said : “
21150	21151	21147	21148	the public	935	” “
21158	21163	21155	21156	the public	935	” said Mr. Stink . “
21171	21178	21155	21156	the public	935	” said Mr. Phillpotts , smiling , “
21243	21470	21471	21473	Re a Foundling	940	” In a few minutes the committee in charge pinned to the only garment of Ginx 's Baby a paper in the following form : — PARISH OF ST . BARTIMEUS . To — — — — ( name unknown ) , a Foundling , and all other persons interested in the said Foundling . TAKE NOTICE That you , or either of you , have no just or lawful claim to have you or the said infant chargeable on the said Parish . And this is to notify that you , the said infant , are retained in the workhouse of the said Parish under protest , and that whatsoever is or may be done or provided for you is at the proper charge of you , and all such persons as are and were by law bound to maintain and keep the same . When Mr. Phillpotts called upon Doll , the cheesemonger , the latter straightway gave him the facts as they had occurred . He pointed out the exact spot on which the bundle had lain ; he gave an estimate of the number of inches on each side of the line occupied by it , and declared that the head and shoulders of the infant lay in the parish of the solicitor 's clients . Ginx 's Baby , under the title “
21475	21713	21471	21473	Re a Foundling	940	” was once more submitted for the opinion of counsel . They advised the Board that as the child was in both parishes when found , but had been taken up by a ratepayer of St. Simon Magus , the latter parish was bound to support him . Whereupon the Guardians of St. Bartimeus at their next meeting resolved that the Vestry of the other parish should have a written notice to remove the child , failing which application should be made to the Queen 's Bench for a mandamus to compel them to do it . On receiving the challenge the Guardians of St. Simon Magus also took counsel 's opinion . They were advised that as the greater part , and especially the head of the infant , was when discovered in the parish of St. Bartimeus , the latter was clearly chargeable . Both parties then proceeded to swear affidavits . The Attorney - General and Solicitor - General , the two great law - officers of the crown , were retained on opposite sides , and took fees — not for an Imperial prosecution , but as petty Queen 's Counsel in an inter - parochial squabble . The Court of Queen 's Bench , after hearing an elaborate statement from the Attorney - General , granted a rule nisi for a mandamus . This rule was entered for argument in a paper called “
21718	21744	21471	21473	Re a Foundling	940	” and , the list being a heavy one , nearly a year elapsed before it was reached . It was then again postponed several times “
21751	22182	21471	21473	Re a Foundling	940	” The Board of St. Bartimeus chafed under the law 's delay . They became morbidly sensitive to the incubus of Ginx 's Baby , especially as the press had been reviewing some of their recent acts with great bitterness . The Guardians were defiant . Having served their notices , they were induced by Mr. Stink to resolve not to maintain the infant . The poor child was threatened with dissolution . Thus , no doubt , many difficulties in parochial administration are solved — the subject vanishes away . The baby was kept provisionally in a room at the workhouse . On the outside of the door was a notice in fair round - hand : — NOTICE . DOLL 'S FOUNDLING . Pending the legal inquiry into the facts concerning the above infant , and a decision as to its settlement , all officials , assistants , and servants of the workhouse are forbidden to enter the room in which it is deposited , or to render it any service or assistance , on pain of dismissal . No food is to be supplied to it from the workhouse kitchen . N.B. This is not intended to prevent persons other than officials , & c. , from having access to the infant , or assisting it . BY ORDER OF THE BOARD . That any body of human beings , other than Patagonians , could have coolly contemplated such a result as must have followed upon the strict performance of this order , would be incredible except in the instance of the Guardians of St. Bartimeus . There was nothing they could not do — or leave undone . Fortunately for Ginx 's Baby , the order was disobeyed . Occasionally lady visitors went to look at him and give him some food — he was toddling about the room on unsteady legs — but charity seemed to be appalled by the official questions hanging about this child . The master , Snigger , whose business it was every day to ascertain whether the cause of the great parochial quarrel was in , or out of , existence , became a traitor to the Board . When the child grew hungry and dangerously thin , he brought bottles of pap prepared by Mrs. Snigger , and administered it to him . No conclusions to the disfavor of the Board were to be drawn from this conduct , for Snigger was particular to say to the boy in a loud voice , each time he fed him : — “
22203	22655	22656	22656	he	943	” Who , in Master Ginx 's situation , would have had any prejudices to such action , or have expressed them even if they were entertained ? He took no objection as he took the pap ; while Snigger was glad to be able to do an unusual kindness without compromising the parish . Thus things had gone on for many months , when one day an eye of that Argus monster , the Public , was set upon Ginx 's Baby . A well - known nobleman , calling at the workhouse to see a little girl whom he had saved from infamy , as he passed down a corridor was arrested by the notice on the door of our hero 's room . Curiosity took him in , and horror chained him there for some time . Had he not entered , Ginx 's Baby , spite of Snigger , would in twenty - four hours have ceased to supply facts to history . He was suffering from low fever , and his condition was as sensationally shocking as any reporter could have wished . Out rushed the peer for a doctor , took a cab to a magistrate and detailed the whole case , to be repeated in next morning 's papers . Penny - a - liners ran to the spot , wrote vivid descriptions of the baby and the room , and transcribed the notice . The Guardians were drubbed in trenchant leaders and indignant letters . They , instead of bending to the storm , strove to confront it , and passed angry resolutions of a childish and grotesque character . The few of them who possessed any sense of propriety were railed at in the meetings till they ceased to attend . The uproar outside increased . Why did not the President of the Poor - Law Board interfere ? At last he did interfere : that is , instead of visiting the scene himself , and satisfying his own eyes as to the truth of what his ears had heard , a process that would have taken a couple of hours , he appointed a gentleman to hold an inquiry . The Guardians became furious . The reports of their proceedings read like the vagaries of a lunatic asylum or the deliberations of the American Senate . They discharged Snigger for breach of orders , substituting a relative of Mr. Stink . They put a lock on the door , and passed food to the Baby by a stick . A committee was appointed to see him fed , and they forwarded a memorial to the Poor - Law Board , stating that “
22673	22822	22656	22656	he	943	” They refused to allow any doctor but one employed by themselves to see him . They procured from him a certificate that the noble busybody and his physician had made a mistake , and that all the functions of life in the infant appeared to be in perfect order . Then came the gentleman , and the inquiry , and his report , and a letter from the Poor - Law Board , and further discussions and more letters , until the bewildered public gnashed its teeth at the Minister , the Guardians , and the law , and wished them all at Land 's End or beyond it . The case of the Guardians of St. Bartimeus against the Guardians of St. Simon Magus was at length reached . The argument lasted for two days . There is a grim work , the short title whereof is “
22827	22849	22656	22656	he	943	” in five fat volumes , from which the legal Dryasdust turns aghast . In one of these portentous books , title “
22852	23003	22656	22656	he	943	” pp . 1200 , the inquisitive may find a code unrivalled by the most malignant ingenuity of former or contemporary nations : a code wherein , by gradual accretion , has been framed a system of relief to poverty and distress so impolitic , so unprincipled , that none but the driest , mustiest , most petrified parish official could be expected to lift up his voice to defend it ; so complicated that no man under heaven knows its length or breadth or height or depth ; yet it stands to this hour a monument of English stolidity — a marvel of lazy or ignorant statesmanship . Imagine , if you please , a Lord Chief Justice and three Puisnes , all keen , practical men , alive to public policy and the common weal , eager to extricate the truth and do the right , plunging into this “
23007	23174	22656	22656	he	943	” thwarted at every turn , in search of justice for Ginx 's Baby . With all his patient industry and lightning quickness of apprehension , the Chief Justice found it hard to reconcile past and present , or evolve from the vast confusion anything consistent with his moral instincts.—Clear the board , gentlemen . True regenerative legislation will begin by drawing away the rubbish . Reform means more than repair . Mend , patch , take down a little here , prop up some tottering nuisance there , fill in gaping chinks with patent legislative cement , coat old facades with bright paint , hide decay beneath a gloze of novelty , titivate , decorate , furbish — and after all your house is not a new one , but a whited sepulchre shaking to decay . Repair ? There is a Repair party , intermediating between Tories and Reformers — Radicals or Rooters let us call these latter if you like — who cling to “
23177	23298	22656	22656	he	943	” and all other sorts of antique nuisances , yet say they are willing to improve them . REFORM , which means , Pull down with bold statesman 's hand , and with like hand REBUILD , is no darling of your political Repairer . Call the party and the men by their right names : and give me for utility in legislation or administrative action an Old Tory and Obstructive party rather than this middling , meddling , muddling Repairer — Just now all Social Reformation , in its noblest aims and attempts , is fettered by the Repair party . What is termed Sanitary Reform is enfeebled , and the vigor withdrawn from it , by this party . “
23302	23303	22656	22656	he	943	” “
23310	23311	22656	22656	he	943	” “
23317	23318	22656	22656	he	943	” “
23319	23371	22656	22656	he	943	EXPENSE,”—these are the watchwords of the Repairer in opposition to him who , pointing to the pallor and fever of a hundred neighborhoods , calls upon a ministry to cleanse them with imperial force . A comprehensive scheme of National Education is seized and half - throttled by the Repair party . “
23441	23471	23394	23394	sects	946	” The methods of relief to the Poor are old , cumbrous , unequal , as stupid as those who administer them . Forth steps the Reformer , and cries out—“Clear
23528	23547	23551	23552	Queen Elizabeth	950	” You have the Repair party shouting its Non possumus as loudly as any other arch - obstructive : “
23572	23625	23551	23552	Queen Elizabeth	950	” Some one with a long head and a divinely - warmed heart , searching vainly for help to thousands in the packed alleys of his English Home , sends his quick glance across seas to rich lands that daily cry to heaven for strong arms that wield the plough and spade . “
23628	23632	23551	23552	Queen Elizabeth	950	” he shouts , “
23645	23676	23551	23552	Queen Elizabeth	950	” and he calls upon every statesman and patriot to help the good work , and give their energies to frame an Emigration Scheme . Then the Repair party foams : “
23738	24744	24746	24746	he	954	” Thus , according to the gospel of this party , everything must be subject of restoration only . Like antiquarians , they utter groans over the abolition of anything , however ugly it may be , however unfitted for human uses , and with however so elegant a piece of artistry you desire to displace it . For them a Gilbert - Scott politician , reverential restorer of bygone styles , enthusiastic to conserve and amend the grotesque Gothic policies of the past , rather than some Brunel or Stephenson statesman , engineering in novel mastery of circumstances — not fearful to face and conquer even the antique impediments of Nature . Give me a trenchant statesman , or I pray you leave legislation alone . Better things as they are than patched to distraction . At length , by means of some delicate legal adjustments , the judges saw their way to affirming that Ginx 's Baby 's parish was that of St. Bartimeus , and refused the rule for a mandamus . The authorities of St. Bartimeus did not take kindly to the charge imposed upon them by the Queen 's Bench . Some of the Guardians privately hinted to the master that it was unnecessary to overfeed the infant . They did not burthen him with much clothing , and what he had was shared with many lively companions . When you , good matron , look at your little pink - cheeked daughter , so clean and so cosy in her pretty cot , waking to see the well - faced nurse , or you , still sweeter to her eyes , watching above her dreams , perhaps you ought to stop a moment to contrast the scene with the sad tableaux you may get sight of not far away . Ginx 's Baby was not an ill - favored child . He had inherited his father 's frame and strength : these helped him through the changes we are relating . What if these capacities had , by simple nourishing food , cleanly care - taking , and brighter , kindlier associations , been trained into full working order ? Left alone or ill - tended they were daily dwindling , and the depreciation was going on not solely at the expense of little Ginx , but of the whole community . To reduce his strength one - half was to reduce one - half his chances of independence , and to multiply the prospects of his continuous application for STATE AID . The money spent in stopping a hole in a Dutch dyke is doubtless better invested than if it were to be retained until a vast breach had laid half a kingdom under water . Surely your Hollander would agree to be mulcted in one - third of his fortune rather than run the hazard ! Every day through this wealthy country there are men and women busy marring the little images of God , that are by - and - by to be part of its public - shadowing young spirits , repressing their energy , sapping their vigor or failing to make it up , corrupting their nature by foul associations , moral and physical . Some are doing it by special license of the devil , others by Act of Parliament , others by negligence or niggardliness . Could you teach or force these people — many unconsciously engaged in the vile work — to run together , as men alarmed by sudden danger , and throw around a helpless generation influences and a care more akin to your own home ideal , would you not transfigure the next epoch — would not your labor and sacrifice be a GOD - WORK , reaching out weighty , fruit - laden branches far into the grateful future ? ' Tis by feeling and enjoining everywhere the need of such a movement as this that you , O all - powerful woman ! can carry your will into the play of a great economic and social reform . Society that recognizes not a root - truth like that is sowing the wind — God knows what it will reap . So the Guardians , keeping carefully within the law , neglected nothing that could sap little Ginx 's vitality , deaden his happiest instincts , derange moral action , cause hope to die within his infant breast almost as soon as it were born . Good God ! The items the Board were really entitled to charge the rate - payers as supplied to our hero were — Dirt , Fleas , Foul air , Chances of catching skin diseases , fevers , & c. , Vile company , Neglect , Occasional cruelty , and A small supply of bad food and clothing . Every pauper was to them an obnoxious charge by any and every means to be reduced to a minimum or nil . Ginx 's Baby was reduced to a minimum . His constitution enabled him to protest against reduction to nil . But , just after the bills of costs had been taxed , mulcting the rate - payers of St. Bartimeus in a sum of more than L 1,600 , the Guardians were made aware of the name and origin of their charge . One of the persons who had deserted him was arrested for theft , and among other articles in her possession were some of the Baby 's clothes . She confessed the whole story , and declared that the child left in Nether Place was no other than the Protestant Baby , son of Ginx , about whom so much stir had been made two years before . The Guardians were not long in tracing Ginx , and , at his quarters in Rosemary Street , the hapless changeling was one day delivered by a deputy relieving - officer , with the benediction , by me sadly recorded — “
24754	24769	24746	24746	he	954	” I am sure if the Guardians had been there they would have said : “
24772	25218	24746	24746	he	954	” Ginx 's Baby 's brothers and sisters would have nothing to say to him . Mrs. Ginx declared she could see in him no likeness to her own dear lost one ; and her husband swore that the brat never was his . The couple had latterly been pinching themselves and their children to save enough to emigrate . For this purpose aid and counsel were given to them by a neighboring curate , whose name , were my pages destined to immortality , should be printed here in golden letters . Rich and full will be his sheaves when many a statesman reaps tares . Finding that a thirteenth child was imposed on them by so superior a force as the law of England the Ginxes hastened their departure . Their last night in London , towards the small hours , Ginx , carrying our hero , went along Birdcage Walk . He scarcely knew where he was going , or how he was about to dispose of his burden , but he meant to get rid of it . On he went , here and there met by shadowy creatures who came towards his footsteps in the uncertain darkness , and when they could see that he was no quarry for them flitted away again into the night . He passed the dingy houses , since replaced by the Foreign Office , across the open space before the Horse Guards , near the house of a popular Prime Minister , and up the broad steps till he stood under the York Column . The shadow of this was an inviting place , but a policeman turning his lantern suspiciously on the man walking about at that silent hour with a child in his arms frustrated his wish . Slowly Ginx tramped along Pall Mall , with only one other creature stirring , as it seemed for the moment — a gentleman who turned up the steps of a large building . Seating the child on the bottom step and telling him not to cry , Ginx instantly crossed the road , turned into St. James 's Square , passed by the rails , and stealing from corner to corner through the mazes of that locality , reached home by way of Piccadilly and Grosvenor Place . Henceforth this history shall know him no more . Scarcely had the shadow of his parent vanished in the gloom before Ginx 's Baby piped forth a lusty protest : the street rang again . Ere long the doors at the top of the steps swung back , and a portly form stood in the light . “
25226	25237	25219	25219	Halloo	189	” ( This was a general observation into space . ) “
25253	25258	25246	25251	a child crying on the steps	955	” Another form appeared . “
25271	25339	25267	25269	any one there	957	” No answer came save from poor little Ginx , but his was decided . The two servants descended the steps and looked at the miserable boy without touching him . Then they peered into the darkness in hope that they might get a glimpse of his mother or a policeman . A rapid step sounded on the pavement and a gentleman came up to the group . “
25345	25350	25342	25342	we	958	” he said gently . “
25389	25390	25382	25383	a policeman	1504	” “
25395	25411	25391	25393	Poor little fellow	961	” said Sir Charles , stooping to take a fair look at Ginx 's Baby , “
25448	25509	25446	25446	Smirke	191	” The men hesitated a moment before executing so unwonted a demand , but Sir Charles Sterling was a man not safely to be thwarted — a late minister and a member of the committee . The child being carried into the magnificent hall of the Club , stood on its mosaic floor . From above the radiance of the gas “
25511	25837	25865	25865	you	969	” streamed down over the marble pillars , and glanced on gilded cornices and panels of scagliola . A statue of the Queen looked upon him from the niche that opened to the dining - room ; another of the great Puritan soldier , statesman , and ruler , with his stern massive front ; and yet another , with the strong yet gentle features of the champion Free - Trader , seemed to regard him from their several corners . On the walls around were portraits of men who had striven for the deliverance of the people from ancient yokes and fetters . Of course Ginx 's Baby did not see all this . He , poor boy , dazed , stood with a knuckle in his eye , while the porter , lackeys , Sir Charles Sterling , and others who strolled out of the reading - room , curiously regarded him . But any one observing the scene apart might have contrasted the place with the child — the principles and the professions whereof this grandeur was the monument and consecrated tabernacle , with this solitary atomic specimen of the material whereon they were to work . What social utility had resulted from the great movements initiated by them who erected and frequented this place ? Ought they to have had , and did they still need a complement ? While wonderful political changes had been wrought , and benefits not to be exaggerated won for many classes , WHAT HAD BEEN DONE FOR GINX 'S BABY ? The query would not have been very ridiculous . He was an unit of the British Empire — nothing could blot out that fact before heaven ! Had anything been left undone that ought to have been done , or done that had well been left undone , or were better to be undone now ? Of a truth that was worth a thought . “
25843	25862	25865	25865	you	969	” said a big Member of Parliament , a minister renowned for economy in matters financial and intellectual . “

25935	25939	25940	25940	he	970	” said another , “

26024	26038	26002	26002	Glibton	192	” replied the Secretary , who was secretly pleased to be quizzed for his peculiarities—“tell

26058	26062	26002	26002	Glibton	192	” said Sterling . “
26131	26138	26125	26125	your	969	” Ginx 's Baby managed to say “
26141	26142	26125	26125	your	969	” “
26151	26172	26125	26125	your	969	” said an Irish ex - member , with a grave face . Ginx 's Baby to this question responded distinctly “
26175	26176	26125	26125	your	969	” “
26180	26185	26125	26125	your	969	” said the humorist ; “
26197	26215	26194	26195	Wilkie Collins	193	” Everybody laughed at this indifferent pleasantry but our hero . His bosom began to heave ominously . “
26224	26225	26194	26195	Wilkie Collins	193	” “
26232	26233	26194	26195	Wilkie Collins	193	” “
26241	26254	26194	26195	Wilkie Collins	193	” ( there may be brutality among the gods and goddesses ) . “
26261	26262	26258	26259	the porter	2026	” “
26269	26287	26267	26267	sir	560	” said he , promptly . The gentlemen were turning away , when Sir Charles stopped them . “
26291	26304	26305	26306	this boy	985	” he said , taking the boy 's arm and baring it , “
26412	26421	26424	26424	you	192	” The gentlemen were dashed by his earnestness . “
26428	26432	26424	26424	you	192	” said Glibton ; “
26455	26456	26447	26448	the people	944	” “
26459	26466	26468	26468	you	192	” replied the other , sadly , “
26510	26511	26498	26500	a hundred clergymen	991	” “
26515	26519	26498	26500	a hundred clergymen	991	” said Glibton . “
26524	26811	26498	26500	a hundred clergymen	991	” The right honorable gentleman extinguished the subject in his own little brain with his big hat ; but everywhere else the sparks are still aglow , and he , with all like him , may wake up suddenly , as frightened women in the night ; to find themselves environed in the red glare of a popular conflagration . Well for them then if they are not in charge of the State machinery . What an hour will that be for hurrying to and fro with water - pipes and buckets , when proper forethought , diligence , and sacrifice would have made the building fireproof . By the kindness and influence of Sir Charles Sterling , Ginx 's Baby that night , and long after , found shelter in the Radical Club . He gave rise to a discussion in the smoking - room next evening that ought to be chronicled . Several members of the committee supported his benefactor in urging that the child should be adopted by the Club , as a pledge of their resolve to make the questions of which he seemed to be the embodied emblem subjects of legislative action . Others said that those questions being , in their view , social and not political , were not proper ones to give impulse to a party movement , and that the entertainment in the Club of this foundling would be a gross irregularity : they did not want samples of the material respecting which they were theorizing . To some of the latter Sir Charles had been insisting that , whether they kept the child or not , they could not stifle the questions excited by his condition . “

28493	28658	28479	28479	he	190	” By PRACTICAL the minister meant , not that which might well and to advantage be done if good and able men would resolve to do it , spite of all hindrances , but that which , upon a cunning review of party balances and a judicious probing of public opinion , seemed to be a policy fit for his party to pursue . The first , original and masterly statesmen are needed to initiate and perform — the other is simply the art of a genius who knows how most adroitly to manipulate people and circumstances . Sir Charles Sterling , Mr. Joshua Hale , and others continued the conversation interrupted by the minister 's exit . What was to be done with Ginx 's Baby ? In the great dissected map of society what niches were cut out for him and all like him to fill ? Most of the politicians were for leaving that to himself to find out . The term “
28664	28699	28700	28700	statesmen	1074	” was freely bandied between them , as it is in many journals nowadays , with little object save to shut up avenues of discussion by a high - sounding phrase . Then of these “
28702	29225	28700	28700	statesmen	1074	” most clung , if not to self - interest , to personal crotchets . What is more darling to a man than the child of his intellect or fancy ? How the poor poetaster hugs his tawdry verses as if they were the imperial ornaments of genius ! Just in the same way does the politician love the policies himself hath devised , pressing them forward at all hazards , while he is blind to the utility of others . This is the basis of that aspect of selfishness which often mars in the approbation of a country a really honest statesmanship — an egotistic tenacity of one 's own creature as the best , which yet is not the criminal selfishness of ambition . Still that egotism is not seldom disastrous to the people 's interests . While these statesmen nursed their own bantlings and held them up to national notice , they were apt to avoid or too lightly regard the views of men as able as themselves . For instance , Joshua Hale — who is far above these remarks generally — had put forth a scheme for the solution of the St. Helena property question — very likely a good one , albeit revolutionary , and nothing would convince him that any other could succeed . He wished every man in St. Helena — a turbulent adjunct of the British Empire — to be a landowner , and I do think , neither desired nor hoped that any man in that island should be happy until he was one . Yet there were other men ready to offer simpler remedies , and to prove that if every man in St. Helena became a landowner it would become a very hell upon earth , and more unmanageable than it was before . If these gentlemen do not sacrifice their pet fancies for the sake of a settlement , what will become of St. Helena ? Just now they were discussing Ginx 's Baby . One thought that repeal of the Poor - Laws and a new system of relief would reach his case ; another saw the root of the Baby 's sorrow in Trades ' Unions ; a third propounded cooperative manufactures ; a fourth suggested that a vast source of income lay untouched in the seas about the kingdom , which swarmed with porpoises , and showed how certain parts of these animals were available for food , others for leather , others for a delicious oil that would be sweeter and more pleasant than butter ; a fifth desired a law to repress the tendency of Scotch peers to evict tenants and convert arable lands into sheep - walks and deer - forests ; a sixth maintained that there were waste lands in the kingdom of capacity to support hungry millions . In fact earth , heaven , and seas were to be regenerated by Act of Parliament for the benefit of Ginx 's Baby and the people of England . Sir Charles listened impatiently , and at last burst forth again . He said : “
29577	29578	29586	29586	you	190	” “
29605	29606	29620	29620	they	1093	” “

29666	29667	29701	29701	They	1103	” “
29670	29678	29701	29701	They	1103	” interjected Sir Charles Sterling , dryly . “
29688	29689	29690	29690	They	1103	” “
29719	29720	29717	29717	they	1103	” “
29729	29730	29717	29717	they	1103	” “
29742	29747	29748	29748	I	0	” replied Sir Charles . “
29853	29854	29841	29841	you	1107	” “
29863	29870	29841	29841	you	1107	” asked Mr. Fissure , pertinently . “
29913	29914	29892	29892	children	437	” “
29934	29935	29940	29940	you	1107	” “

30136	30139	30142	30142	nurses	1127	” cries Lord Namby—“a
30213	30214	30197	30197	you	1128	” “
30253	30254	30257	30258	most men	1134	” “
30282	30283	30278	30278	you	1128	” “
30608	31300	33347	33348	Lord Munnibagge	201	” Will any sane political practitioner wonder to be told that at the end of this harangue the smoking - room party broke up , and that some , as they laughed good - humoredly over Sterling 's egregia , recalled the number of glasses of inspirited seltzer swallowed by the orator ? He was so far in advance of the most radical reformer that there was no hope of overtaking him for an era or two : so they determined to fancy they had left him behind . In the Club our hero revelled awhile under the protection of Sir Charles Sterling , and the petting of peers , Members of Parliament , and loungers who swarm therein . Certain gentlemen of Stock Exchange mannerism and dressiness gave the protege the go - by , and even sneered at those who noticed him with kindness . But then these are of the men with whom every question is checked by money , and is balanced on the pivot of profit and loss . I dare say some of them thought the worse of Judas only because he had made so small a gain out of his celebrated transaction . To foster Ginx 's Baby in the Club , as a recognition of the important questions surrounding him , though these questions involved hundreds of thousands of other cases , was to them ridiculous . Of far greater consequence was it in their eyes to settle a dispute between two extravagant fools at Constantinople and Cairo , and quicken the sluggishness of Turkish consols or Egyptian 9 per cents . I do not cast stones at them ; every man must look at a thing with his own eyes . But it was curious to note how the Baby 's fortunes shifted in the Club . There were times — when he was a pet chucked under chin by the elder stagers , favored with a smile from a Cabinet Minister , and now and then blessed with a nod from Mr. Joshua Hale . Then , again , every one seemed to forget him , and he was for months left unnoticed to the chance kindness of the menials until some case similar to his own happening to evoke discussion in the press , there would be a general inquiry for him . The porter , Mr. Smirke , had succeeded , by means of a detective , in discovering the boy 's name , but his parents were then half - way to Canada . The members of the Fogey Club opposite , hearing that so interesting a foundling was being cherished by their opponents , politely asked leave to examine him , and he occasionally visited them . They treated him kindly and discussed his condition with earnestness . The leaders of the party debated whether he might not with advantage be taken out of their opponents ' hands . Some thought that a judicious use of him might win popularity ; but others objected that it would be perilous for them to mix themselves up with so doleful an interest . In the result the Fogies tipped young Ginx , but did not commit themselves for or against him . Thus a long time elapsed , and our hero had grown old enough to be a page . He had received food , clothing , and goodwill , but no one had thought of giving him an education . Sometimes he became obstreperous . He played tricks with the Club cutlery , and diverted its silver to improper uses ; he laid traps for upsetting aged and infirm legislators ; he tried the coolness of the youngest and best - natured Members of Parliament by popping up in strange places and exhibiting unseemly attitudes . At length , by unanimous consent , he was decreed to be a nuisance , and a few days would have revoked his license at the Club . No sooner did the Fogies get wind of this than they manoeuvred to get Ginx 's Baby under their own management . They instructed their “
31303	32182	33347	33348	Lord Munnibagge	201	” as they called them , to pipe to popular feeling on the disgraceful apathy of the Radicals in regard to the foundling . They had him waylaid and treated to confectionery by their emissaries ; and once or twice succeeded in abducting him and sending him down to the country with their party 's candidates , for exhibition at elections . The Radicals resented this conduct extremely . Ginx 's Baby was brought back to the Club and restored to favor . The Government papers were instructed to detail how much he was petted and talked about by the party ; to declare how needless was the popular excitement on his behalf ; and to prove that he must , without any special legislation , be benefited by the extraordinary organic changes then being made in the constitution of the country . Sir Charles Sterling resumed his interest in the boy . He had been gallantly aiding his party in other questions . There was the Timbuctoo question . A miserable desert chief had shut up a wandering Englishman , not possessed of wit enough to keep his head out of danger . There was a general impression that English honor was at stake , and the previous Fogey Government had ordered an expedition to cross the desert and punish the sheikh . You would never believe what it cost if you had not seen the bill . Ten millions sterling was as good as buried in the desert , when one - tenth of it would have saved a hundred thousand people from starvation at home , and one - hundredth part of it would have taken the fetters off the hapless prisoner 's feet . There was the St. Helena question always brooding over Parliament . St. Helena was a constituent part of the British Empire . Every patriot agreed that the Empire without it would be incomplete ; and was so far right that its subtraction would have left the Empire by so much less . Most of its inhabitants were aboriginal — a mercurial race , full of fire , quick - witted , and gifted with the exuberant eloquence of savages , but deficient in dignity and self - control . Before any one else had been given them by Providence to fight , they slaughtered and ravaged one another . Our intrusive British ancestors stepped upon the island , and , being strong men , mowed down the islanders like wheat , and appropriated the lands their swords had cleared . Still the aborigines held out in corners , and defied the conquerors . The latter ground them down , confiscated the property of their half - dozen chiefs , and distributed it among themselves . By way of showing their imperial imperiousness , they built over some ruins left by their devastations a great church , in which they ordered all the islanders to worship . This was at first abomination to the islanders , who fought like devils whenever they could , and ended by accepting the religion of their foes . But the conquerors , afterwards choosing to change their own faith , resolved that the islanders should do so too . Forthwith they confiscated the big church and burying - ground , and , distributing part of the land and spoils among their most prominent scamps , erected a new edifice of quite a different character , in which the natives swore they could neither see nor hear , and their own clerics warned them they would certainly be damned . To make the complications more intricate , these clerics owed allegiance to an ancient woman in a distant country , who had all the meddlesomeness and petty jealousy of her sex , and was , besides , much attached to some clever wooers of hers , wily sinners who covered their aims under the semblance of ultra - extreme passion for her . The prominent scamps died , to be succeeded by their children , or other of the hated conquerors , from generation to generation . The islanders went on increasing and protesting . T hey starved upon the lands , and shot the landlords when a few gave them the chance , for most lived away in their own country , and left the property to be administered by agents . The Home Government had again and again been obliged to assist these people with soldiers , to provide an armed police , to shoot down mobs , to catch a ringleader here or there and send him to Fernando Po , or to deprive whole villages of ordinary civil rights . Then the yam crop failed , and nearly half the people left the island and crossed the seas , where they continued to hate and to plot against those whose misfortune it had been to get a legacy of the island from their fathers . It would be wearisome to recount the absurdities on both sides : the stupidity or criminal absence of tact from time to time shown by the Home Government — the resolve never to be quiet exhibited by the natives , under the prompting of their clerics . Upon “
32190	32212	33347	33348	Lord Munnibagge	201	” there were ever springing up fresh difficulties . Secret clubs were formed for murder and reprisal . A body called the “
32214	32598	33347	33348	Lord Munnibagge	201	” had bound themselves by private oaths to keep up the memory of the religious victories of their predecessors , and to worry the clerical party in every possible way . Their pleasure was to go about insanely blowing rams'-horns , carrying flags and bearing oranges in their hands . The islanders hated oranges , and at every opportunity cracked the skulls of the orange - bearers with brutal weapons peculiar to the island . These , in return , cracked native skulls . The whole island was in a state of perpetual commotion . Still , its general condition improved , its farms grew prosperous , and a joint - stock company had built a mill for converting cocoanut fibre into horse - cloths , which yielded large profits . The memory of past events might well have been buried ; but the clerics , in the interest of the old woman , fanned the embers , and the infamous bidding for popularity of parties at home served to keep alive passions that would naturally have died out . Besides , latterly folly had been too organized on both sides to suffer oblivion . Everybody was tired of the squabbles of St. Helena . At length there was a general movement in the interests of peace , and to pacify the islanders Parliament was asked to pull down the wings of the old church edifice , remove some of the graves , and cut off a large piece of the graveyard . Some were in favor also of dividing all the farms in the country among the aborigines , but the difficulty was to know how at the same time to satisfy the present occupiers . These schemes were topics of high debate , upon them the fortunes of Government rose and fell , and while they were agitated Ginx 's Baby could have no chance of a parliamentary hearing . Many other matters of singular indifference had eaten up the legislative time ; but at last the increasing number of wretched infants throughout the country began to alarm the people , and Sir Charles Sterling thought the time had come to move on behalf of Ginx 's Baby and his fellows . While Sir Charles was trying to get the Government to “
32603	33341	33347	33348	Lord Munnibagge	201	” to debate the Ginx 's Baby case , and while associations were being formed in the metropolis for disposing of him by expatriation or otherwise , a busy peer without notice to anybody , suddenly brought the subject before the House of Lords . As he had never seen the Baby , and knew nothing or very little about him , I need scarcely report the elaborate speech in which he asked for aristocratic sympathy on his behalf . He proposed to send him to the Antipodes at the expense of the nation . The Minister for the Accidental Accompaniments of the Empire was a clever man — keen , genial , subtle , two - edged , a gentlemanly and not thorough disciple of Machiavel ; able to lead parliamentary forlorn hopes and plant flags on breaches , or to cover retreats with brilliant skirmishing ; deft , but never deep ; much moved too by the opinions of his permanent staff . These on the night in question had plied him well with hackneyed objections ; but to see him get up and relieve himself of them — the air of originality , the really original air he threw around them ; the absurd light which he turned full on the weaknesses of his noble friend 's propositions , was as beautiful to an indifferent critic as it as saddening to the man who had at heart the sorrows of his kind . If that minister lived long he would be forced to adopt and advocate in as pretty a manner the policy he was dissecting . Lord Munnibagge , a great authority in economic matters , said that a weaker case had never been presented to Parliament . To send away Ginx 's Baby to a colony at imperial expense was at once to rob the pockets of the rich and to decrease our labor - power . There was no necessity for it . Ginx 's Baby could not starve in a country like this . He ( Lord Munnibagge ) had never heard of a case of a baby starving . There was no such wide - spread distress as was represented by the noble lord . There were occasional periods of stagnation in trade , and no doubt in these periods the poorer classes would suffer ; but trade was elastic ; and even if it were granted that the present was a period when employment had failed , the time was not far off when trade would recuperate . ( Cheers . ) Ginx 's Baby and all other babies would not then wish to go away . People were always making exaggerated statements about the condition of the poor . He ( Lord Munnibagge ) did not credit them . He believed the country , though temporarily depressed by financial collapses , to be in a most healthy state . ( Hear , hear . ) It was absurd to say otherwise , when it was shown by the Board of Trade returns that we were growing richer every day . ( Cheers . ) Of course Ginx 's Baby must be growing richer with the rest . Was not that a complete answer to the noble lord 's plaintive outcries ? ( Cheers and laughter . ) That the population of a country was a great fraction of its wealth was an elementary principle of political economy . He thought , from the high rates of wages , that there were not too many but too few laborers in the country . He should oppose the motion . ( Cheers . ) Two or three noble lords repeated similar platitudes , guarding themselves as carefully from any reference to facts , or to the question whether high rates of wages might not be the concomitants simply of high prices of necessaries , or to the yet wider question whether colonial development might not have something to do with progress at home . The noble lord who had rushed unprepared into the arena was unequal to the forces marshalled against him , and withdrew his motion . Thus the great debate collapsed . The Lords were relieved that an awkward question had so easily been shifted . The newspapers on the ministerial side declared that this debate had proved the futility of the Ginx 's Baby Expatriation question . “
33426	33990	33381	33389	the Secretary for the Accidental Accompaniments of the Empire	1171	” Surely after this the Expatriation people hid their lights under a bushel ! The Government refused to find a night for Sir Charles Sterling , and after the Lords ' debate he did not see his way to force a motion in the Lower House . Meanwhile Ginx 's Baby once more decided a turn in his own fate . Tired of the slow life of the Club , and shivering amid the chill indifference of his patrons , he borrowed without leave some clothes from an inmate 's room , with a few silver forks and spoons , and decamped . Whether the baronet and the Club were bashful of public ridicule or glad to be rid of the charge , I know not , but no attempt was made to recover him . Our hero was nearly fifteen years old when he left the Club to plunge into the world . He was not long in converting his spoils into money , and a very short time in spending it . Then he had to pit his wits against starvation , and some of his throws were desperate . Wherever he went the world seemed terribly full . If he answered an advertisement for an errand - boy , there were a score kicking their heels at the rendezvous before him . Did he try to learn a useful trade , thousands of adepts were not only ready to underbid him , but to knock him on the head for an interloper . Even the thieves , to whom he gravitated , were jealous of his accession , because there were too many competitors already in their department . Through his career of penury , of honest and dishonest callings , of ' scapes and captures , imprisonments and other punishments , a year 's reading of Metropolitan Police Reports would furnish the exact counterpart . I do n't know how many years after his flight from Pall Mall , one dim midnight , I , returning from Richmond , lounged over Vauxhall Bridge , listening to the low lapping of the current beneath the arches — looking above to the stars and along the dark polished surface that reflected a thousand lights in its undulations,—feeling the awfulness of the dense , suppressed life that was wrapt within the gloom and calm of the hour . I suddenly saw a shadow , a human shadow , that at the sound of my footstep quickly crossed my dreamy vision — quickly , noiselessly came and went before my eyes until it stood up high and outlined against the strangely - mingled haze . It looked like the ghost of a slight - formed man , hatless and coatless , and for a moment I saw at its upper extremity the dull flash as of a human face in the gloom , before the shadow leaped out far into the night . Splash ! When my startled eyes looked down upon the glancing , waving ebony , I thought I could trace a white coruscation of foam spreading out into the darkness , instantly to dissipate and be lost for ever . I did not then know what form it was that swilled down below the glistening current . Had I known that it was Ginx 's Baby I should perhaps have thought “
