It was the wildest sort of narrative , but I had heard in my time many steep tales which had turned out to be true , and I had made a practice of judging the man rather than the story . If he had wanted to get a location in my flat , and then cut my throat , he would have pitched a milder yarn . '

He was shaved clean , his hair was parted in the middle , and he had cut his eyebrows . Further , he carried himself as if he had been drilled , and was the very model , even to the brown complexion , of some British officer who had had a long spell in India . He had a monocle , too , which he stuck in his eye , and every trace of the American had gone out of his speech . '

Things did happen occasionally , even in this God - forgotten metropolis . I woke next morning to hear my man , Paddock , making the deuce of a row at the smoking - room door . Paddock was a fellow I had done a good turn to out on the Selakwe , and I had inspanned him as my servant as soon as I got to England . He had about as much gift of the gab as a hippopotamus , and was not a great hand at valeting , but I knew I could count on his loyalty . '

4341	4458	4459	4459	Sir	305	' I told Paddock a fine story about how my friend was a great swell , with his nerves pretty bad from overwork , who wanted absolute rest and stillness . Nobody had got to know he was here , or he would be besieged by communications from the India Office and the Prime Minister and his cure would be ruined . I am bound to say Scudder played up splendidly when he came to breakfast . He fixed Paddock with his eyeglass , just like a British officer , asked him about the Boer War , and slung out at me a lot of stuff about imaginary pals . Paddock could n't learn to call me '

7853	8298	7851	7851	guv'nor	484	' I stuck on his flat blue hat and his white overall , picked up the cans , banged my door , and went whistling downstairs . The porter at the foot told me to shut my jaw , which sounded as if my make - up was adequate . At first I thought there was nobody in the street . Then I caught sight of a policeman a hundred yards down , and a loafer shuffling past on the other side . Some impulse made me raise my eyes to the house opposite , and there at a first - floor window was a face . As the loafer passed he looked up , and I fancied a signal was exchanged . I crossed the street , whistling gaily and imitating the jaunty swing of the milkman . Then I took the first side street , and went up a left - hand turning which led past a bit of vacant ground . There was no one in the little street , so I dropped the milk - cans inside the hoarding and sent the cap and overall after them . I had only just put on my cloth cap when a postman came round the corner . I gave him good morning and he answered me unsuspiciously . At the moment the clock of a neighbouring church struck the hour of seven . There was not a second to spare . As soon as I got to Euston Road I took to my heels and ran . The clock at Euston Station showed five minutes past the hour . At St Pancras I had no time to take a ticket , let alone that I had not settled upon my destination . A porter told me the platform , and as I entered it I saw the train already in motion . Two station officials blocked the way , but I dodged them and clambered into the last carriage . Three minutes later , as we were roaring through the northern tunnels , an irate guard interviewed me . He wrote out for me a ticket to Newton - Stewart , a name which had suddenly come back to my memory , and he conducted me from the first - class compartment where I had ensconced myself to a third - class smoker , occupied by a sailor and a stout woman with a child . He went off grumbling , and as I mopped my brow I observed to my companions in my broadest Scots that it was a sore job catching trains . I had already entered upon my part . '
8302	8306	8308	8309	the lady	485	' that gyaird ! '
8312	8328	8308	8309	the lady	485	' He needit a Scotch tongue to pit him in his place . He was complainin '
8330	8335	7851	7851	guv'nor	484	' this wean no haein '
8350	8355	8347	8347	he	487	' to this gentleman spittin '
8357	8562	8347	8347	he	487	' The sailor morosely agreed , and I started my new life in an atmosphere of protest against authority . I reminded myself that a week ago I had been finding the world dull . I had a solemn time travelling north that day . It was fine May weather , with the hawthorn flowering on every hedge , and I asked myself why , when I was still a free man , I had stayed on in London and not got the good of this heavenly country . I did n't dare face the restaurant car , but I got a luncheon - basket at Leeds and shared it with the fat woman . Also I got the morning 's papers , with news about starters for the Derby and the beginning of the cricket season , and some paragraphs about how Balkan affairs were settling down and a British squadron was going to Kiel . When I had done with them I got out Scudder 's little black pocket - book and studied it . It was pretty well filled with jottings , chiefly figures , though now and then a name was printed in . For example , I found the words '
8564	8566	8308	8309	the lady	485	' , '
8568	8571	8308	8309	the lady	485	' , and '
8573	8581	8308	8309	the lady	485	' pretty often , and especially the word '
8583	9360	8308	8309	the lady	485	' . Now I was certain that Scudder never did anything without a reason , and I was pretty sure that there was a cypher in all this . That is a subject which has always interested me , and I did a bit at it myself once as intelligence officer at Delagoa Bay during the Boer War . I have a head for things like chess and puzzles , and I used to reckon myself pretty good at finding out cyphers . This one looked like the numerical kind where sets of figures correspond to the letters of the alphabet , but any fairly shrewd man can find the clue to that sort after an hour or two 's work , and I did n't think Scudder would have been content with anything so easy . So I fastened on the printed words , for you can make a pretty good numerical cypher if you have a key word which gives you the sequence of the letters . I tried for hours , but none of the words answered . Then I fell asleep and woke at Dumfries just in time to bundle out and get into the slow Galloway train . There was a man on the platform whose looks I did n't like , but he never glanced at me , and when I caught sight of myself in the mirror of an automatic machine I did n't wonder . With my brown face , my old tweeds , and my slouch , I was the very model of one of the hill farmers who were crowding into the third - class carriages . I travelled with half a dozen in an atmosphere of shag and clay pipes . They had come from the weekly market , and their mouths were full of prices . I heard accounts of how the lambing had gone up the Cairn and the Deuch and a dozen other mysterious waters . Above half the men had lunched heavily and were highly flavoured with whisky , but they took no notice of me . We rumbled slowly into a land of little wooded glens and then to a great wide moorland place , gleaming with lochs , with high blue hills showing northwards . About five o'clock the carriage had emptied , and I was left alone as I had hoped . I got out at the next station , a little place whose name I scarcely noted , set right in the heart of a bog . It reminded me of one of those forgotten little stations in the Karroo . An old station - master was digging in his garden , and with his spade over his shoulder sauntered to the train , took charge of a parcel , and went back to his potatoes . A child of ten received my ticket , and I emerged on a white road that straggled over the brown moor . It was a gorgeous spring evening , with every hill showing as clear as a cut amethyst . The air had the queer , rooty smell of bogs , but it was as fresh as mid - ocean , and it had the strangest effect on my spirits . I actually felt light - hearted . I might have been a boy out for a spring holiday tramp , instead of a man of thirty - seven very much wanted by the police . I felt just as I used to feel when I was starting for a big trek on a frosty morning on the high veld . If you believe me , I swung along that road whistling . There was no plan of campaign in my head , only just to go on and on in this blessed , honest - smelling hill country , for every mile put me in better humour with myself . In a roadside planting I cut a walking - stick of hazel , and presently struck off the highway up a bypath which followed the glen of a brawling stream . I reckoned that I was still far ahead of any pursuit , and for that night might please myself . It was some hours since I had tasted food , and I was getting very hungry when I came to a herd 's cottage set in a nook beside a waterfall . A brown - faced woman was standing by the door , and greeted me with the kindly shyness of moorland places . When I asked for a night 's lodging she said I was welcome to the '
9365	9513	8308	8309	the lady	485	' , and very soon she set before me a hearty meal of ham and eggs , scones , and thick sweet milk . At the darkening her man came in from the hills , a lean giant , who in one step covered as much ground as three paces of ordinary mortals . They asked me no questions , for they had the perfect breeding of all dwellers in the wilds , but I could see they set me down as a kind of dealer , and I took some trouble to confirm their view . I spoke a lot about cattle , of which my host knew little , and I picked up from him a good deal about the local Galloway markets , which I tucked away in my memory for future use . At ten I was nodding in my chair , and the '
9518	10371	8308	8309	the lady	485	' received a weary man who never opened his eyes till five o'clock set the little homestead a - going once more . They refused any payment , and by six I had breakfasted and was striding southwards again . My notion was to return to the railway line a station or two farther on than the place where I had alighted yesterday and to double back . I reckoned that that was the safest way , for the police would naturally assume that I was always making farther from London in the direction of some western port . I thought I had still a good bit of a start , for , as I reasoned , it would take some hours to fix the blame on me , and several more to identify the fellow who got on board the train at St Pancras . It was the same jolly , clear spring weather , and I simply could not contrive to feel careworn . Indeed I was in better spirits than I had been for months . Over a long ridge of moorland I took my road , skirting the side of a high hill which the herd had called Cairnsmore of Fleet . Nesting curlews and plovers were crying everywhere , and the links of green pasture by the streams were dotted with young lambs . All the slackness of the past months was slipping from my bones , and I stepped out like a four - year - old . By - and - by I came to a swell of moorland which dipped to the vale of a little river , and a mile away in the heather I saw the smoke of a train . The station , when I reached it , proved to be ideal for my purpose . The moor surged up around it and left room only for the single line , the slender siding , a waiting - room , an office , the station - master 's cottage , and a tiny yard of gooseberries and sweet - william . There seemed no road to it from anywhere , and to increase the desolation the waves of a tarn lapped on their grey granite beach half a mile away . I waited in the deep heather till I saw the smoke of an east - going train on the horizon . Then I approached the tiny booking - office and took a ticket for Dumfries . The only occupants of the carriage were an old shepherd and his dog - a wall - eyed brute that I mistrusted . The man was asleep , and on the cushions beside him was that morning 's Scotsman . Eagerly I seized on it , for I fancied it would tell me something . There were two columns about the Portland Place Murder , as it was called . My man Paddock had given the alarm and had the milkman arrested . Poor devil , it looked as if the latter had earned his sovereign hardly ; but for me he had been cheap at the price , for he seemed to have occupied the police for the better part of the day . In the latest news I found a further instalment of the story . The milkman had been released , I read , and the true criminal , about whose identity the police were reticent , was believed to have got away from London by one of the northern lines . There was a short note about me as the owner of the flat . I guessed the police had stuck that in , as a clumsy contrivance to persuade me that I was unsuspected . There was nothing else in the paper , nothing about foreign politics or Karolides , or the things that had interested Scudder . I laid it down , and found that we were approaching the station at which I had got out yesterday . The potato - digging station - master had been gingered up into some activity , for the west - going train was waiting to let us pass , and from it had descended three men who were asking him questions . I supposed that they were the local police , who had been stirred up by Scotland Yard , and had traced me as far as this one - horse siding . Sitting well back in the shadow I watched them carefully . One of them had a book , and took down notes . The old potato - digger seemed to have turned peevish , but the child who had collected my ticket was talking volubly . All the party looked out across the moor where the white road departed . I hoped they were going to take up my tracks there . As we moved away from that station my companion woke up . He fixed me with a wandering glance , kicked his dog viciously , and inquired where he was . Clearly he was very drunk . '

My plan had been to get out at some station down the line , but the train suddenly gave me a better chance , for it came to a standstill at the end of a culvert which spanned a brawling porter - coloured river . I looked out and saw that every carriage window was closed and no human figure appeared in the landscape . So I opened the door , and dropped quickly into the tangle of hazels which edged the line . It would have been all right but for that infernal dog . Under the impression that I was decamping with its master 's belongings , it started to bark , and all but got me by the trousers . This woke up the herd , who stood bawling at the carriage door in the belief that I had committed suicide . I crawled through the thicket , reached the edge of the stream , and in cover of the bushes put a hundred yards or so behind me . Then from my shelter I peered back , and saw the guard and several passengers gathered round the open carriage door and staring in my direction . I could not have made a more public departure if I had left with a bugler and a brass band . Happily the drunken herd provided a diversion . He and his dog , which was attached by a rope to his waist , suddenly cascaded out of the carriage , landed on their heads on the track , and rolled some way down the bank towards the water . In the rescue which followed the dog bit somebody , for I could hear the sound of hard swearing . Presently they had forgotten me , and when after a quarter of a mile 's crawl I ventured to look back , the train had started again and was vanishing in the cutting . I was in a wide semicircle of moorland , with the brown river as radius , and the high hills forming the northern circumference . There was not a sign or sound of a human being , only the plashing water and the interminable crying of curlews . Yet , oddly enough , for the first time I felt the terror of the hunted on me . It was not the police that I thought of , but the other folk , who knew that I knew Scudder 's secret and dared not let me live . I was certain that they would pursue me with a keenness and vigilance unknown to the British law , and that once their grip closed on me I should find no mercy . I looked back , but there was nothing in the landscape . The sun glinted on the metals of the line and the wet stones in the stream , and you could not have found a more peaceful sight in the world . Nevertheless I started to run . Crouching low in the runnels of the bog , I ran till the sweat blinded my eyes . The mood did not leave me till I had reached the rim of mountain and flung myself panting on a ridge high above the young waters of the brown river . From my vantage - ground I could scan the whole moor right away to the railway line and to the south of it where green fields took the place of heather . I have eyes like a hawk , but I could see nothing moving in the whole countryside . Then I looked east beyond the ridge and saw a new kind of landscape - shallow green valleys with plentiful fir plantations and the faint lines of dust which spoke of highroads . Last of all I looked into the blue May sky , and there I saw that which set my pulses racing ... Low down in the south a monoplane was climbing into the heavens . I was as certain as if I had been told that that aeroplane was looking for me , and that it did not belong to the police . For an hour or two I watched it from a pit of heather . It flew low along the hill - tops , and then in narrow circles over the valley up which I had come . Then it seemed to change its mind , rose to a great height , and flew away back to the south . I did not like this espionage from the air , and I began to think less well of the countryside I had chosen for a refuge . These heather hills were no sort of cover if my enemies were in the sky , and I must find a different kind of sanctuary . I looked with more satisfaction to the green country beyond the ridge , for there I should find woods and stone houses . About six in the evening I came out of the moorland to a white ribbon of road which wound up the narrow vale of a lowland stream . As I followed it , fields gave place to bent , the glen became a plateau , and presently I had reached a kind of pass where a solitary house smoked in the twilight . The road swung over a bridge , and leaning on the parapet was a young man . He was smoking a long clay pipe and studying the water with spectacled eyes . In his left hand was a small book with a finger marking the place . Slowly he repeated- As when a Gryphon through the wilderness With winged step , o'er hill and moory dale Pursues the Arimaspian . He jumped round as my step rung on the keystone , and I saw a pleasant sunburnt boyish face . '
11569	11574	11567	11567	you	493	' he said gravely . '

I made out that I was a mining magnate from Kimberley , who had had a lot of trouble with I.D.B. and had shown up a gang . They had pursued me across the ocean , and had killed my best friend , and were now on my tracks . I told the story well , though I say it who should n't . I pictured a flight across the Kalahari to German Africa , the crackling , parching days , the wonderful blue - velvet nights . I described an attack on my life on the voyage home , and I made a really horrid affair of the Portland Place murder . '

12381	12777	12778	12778	Julia	153	' As I entered the inn porch I heard from far off the beat of an engine . There silhouetted against the dusky West was my friend , the monoplane . He gave me a room at the back of the house , with a fine outlook over the plateau , and he made me free of his own study , which was stacked with cheap editions of his favourite authors . I never saw the grandmother , so I guessed she was bedridden . An old woman called Margit brought me my meals , and the innkeeper was around me at all hours . I wanted some time to myself , so I invented a job for him . He had a motor - bicycle , and I sent him off next morning for the daily paper , which usually arrived with the post in the late afternoon . I told him to keep his eyes skinned , and make note of any strange figures he saw , keeping a special sharp look - out for motors and aeroplanes . Then I sat down in real earnest to Scudder 's note - book . He came back at midday with the Scotsman . There was nothing in it , except some further evidence of Paddock and the milkman , and a repetition of yesterday 's statement that the murderer had gone North . But there was a long article , reprinted from The Times , about Karolides and the state of affairs in the Balkans , though there was no mention of any visit to England . I got rid of the innkeeper for the afternoon , for I was getting very warm in my search for the cypher . As I told you , it was a numerical cypher , and by an elaborate system of experiments I had pretty well discovered what were the nulls and stops . The trouble was the key word , and when I thought of the odd million words he might have used I felt pretty hopeless . But about three o'clock I had a sudden inspiration . The name Julia Czechenyi flashed across my memory . Scudder had said it was the key to the Karolides business , and it occurred to me to try it on his cypher . It worked . The five letters of '
12779	12816	12817	12817	Czechenyi	153	' gave me the position of the vowels . A was J , the tenth letter of the alphabet , and so represented by X in the cypher . E was XXI , and so on . '
12818	12933	12817	12817	Czechenyi	153	' gave me the numerals for the principal consonants . I scribbled that scheme on a bit of paper and sat down to read Scudder 's pages . In half an hour I was reading with a whitish face and fingers that drummed on the table . I glanced out of the window and saw a big touring - car coming up the glen towards the inn . It drew up at the door , and there was the sound of people alighting . There seemed to be two of them , men in aquascutums and tweed caps . Ten minutes later the innkeeper slipped into the room , his eyes bright with excitement . '
12943	12947	12948	12948	They	506	' he whispered . '
12949	13022	13023	13023	I	0	're in the dining - room having whiskies - and - sodas . They asked about you and said they had hoped to meet you here . Oh ! and they described you jolly well , down to your boots and shirt . I told them you had been here last night and had gone off on a motor bicycle this morning , and one of the chaps swore like a navvy . '
13092	13143	13144	13144	I	0	' Black Stone . Scudder had got on to this , but he could not act for a fortnight . I doubt if I can do any good now , especially as Karolides is uncertain about his plans . But if Mr T. advises I will do the best I ... '

13253	13294	13249	13249	he	1767	' The dark fellow went as white as death and cursed like blazes , and the fat one whistled and looked ugly . They paid for their drinks with half - a - sovereign and would n't wait for change . '

That was coming , as sure as Christmas : had been arranged , said Scudder , ever since February 1912 . Karolides was going to be the occasion . He was booked all right , and was to hand in his checks on June 14th , two weeks and four days from that May morning . I gathered from Scudder 's notes that nothing on earth could prevent that . His talk of Epirote guards that would skin their own grandmothers was all billy - o. The second thing was that this war was going to come as a mighty surprise to Britain . Karolides '

Three minutes later we drew up before a comfortable - looking shooting box set among pine - trees , and he ushered me indoors . He took me first to a bedroom and flung half a dozen of his suits before me , for my own had been pretty well reduced to rags . I selected a loose blue serge , which differed most conspicuously from my former garments , and borrowed a linen collar . Then he haled me to the dining - room , where the remnants of a meal stood on the table , and announced that I had just five minutes to feed . '

This afternoon I had a wire from the ruffian saying he had got influenza at Blackpool , and here am I left to do the whole thing myself . I had meant to speak for ten minutes and must now go on for forty , and , though I 've been racking my brains for three hours to think of something , I simply can not last the course .

My young gentleman was far too absorbed in his own difficulties to think how odd it was to ask a stranger who had just missed death by an ace and had lost a 1,000 - guinea car to address a meeting for him on the spur of the moment . But my necessities did not allow me to contemplate oddnesses or to pick and choose my supports . '

He found out I knew a bit about horses , and jawed away about the Derby entries ; and he was full of plans for improving his shooting . Altogether , a very clean , decent , callow young man . As we passed through a little town two policemen signalled us to stop , and flashed their lanterns on us . '
16956	16960	16953	16954	Sir Harry	177	' said one . '

16986	17145	16978	16978	yours	177	' said my host , while I thanked Providence for the devious ways I had been brought to safety . After that he spoke no more , for his mind began to labour heavily with his coming speech . His lips kept muttering , his eye wandered , and I began to prepare myself for a second catastrophe . I tried to think of something to say myself , but my mind was dry as a stone . The next thing I knew we had drawn up outside a door in a street , and were being welcomed by some noisy gentlemen with rosettes . The hall had about five hundred in it , women mostly , a lot of bald heads , and a dozen or two young men . The chairman , a weaselly minister with a reddish nose , lamented Crumpleton 's absence , soliloquized on his influenza , and gave me a certificate as a '
17151	17272	16978	16978	yours	177	' . There were two policemen at the door , and I hoped they took note of that testimonial . Then Sir Harry started . I never heard anything like it . He did n't begin to know how to talk . He had about a bushel of notes from which he read , and when he let go of them he fell into one prolonged stutter . Every now and then he remembered a phrase he had learned by heart , straightened his back , and gave it off like Henry Irving , and the next moment he was bent double and crooning over his papers . It was the most appalling rot , too . He talked about the '
17275	17304	16978	16978	yours	177	' , and said it was all a Tory invention to cheat the poor of their rights and keep back the great flood of social reform , but that '
17307	17606	17752	17753	Sir Harry	177	' realized this and laughed the Tories to scorn . He was all for reducing our Navy as a proof of our good faith , and then sending Germany an ultimatum telling her to do the same or we would knock her into a cocked hat . He said that , but for the Tories , Germany and Britain would be fellow - workers in peace and reform . I thought of the little black book in my pocket ! A giddy lot Scudder 's friends cared for peace and reform . Yet in a queer way I liked the speech . You could see the niceness of the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been spoon - fed . Also it took a load off my mind . I might n't be much of an orator , but I was a thousand per cent better than Sir Harry . I did n't get on so badly when it came to my turn . I simply told them all I could remember about Australia , praying there should be no Australian there - all about its labour party and emigration and universal service . I doubt if I remembered to mention Free Trade , but I said there were no Tories in Australia , only Labour and Liberals . That fetched a cheer , and I woke them up a bit when I started in to tell them the kind of glorious business I thought could be made out of the Empire if we really put our backs into it . Altogether I fancy I was rather a success . The minister did n't like me , though , and when he proposed a vote of thanks , spoke of Sir Harry 's speech as '
17608	17613	17617	17619	an emigration agent	666	' and mine as having '
17620	17642	17647	17647	Twisdon	174	' . When we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at having got his job over . '
17649	17653	17647	17647	Twisdon	174	' he said . '

22094	22422	22423	22423	Marmie	192	' One of them gave me a cigar , which I smelt gingerly and stuck in Turnbull 's bundle . They got into their car and were out of sight in three minutes . My heart leaped with an enormous relief , but I went on wheeling my stones . It was as well , for ten minutes later the car returned , one of the occupants waving a hand to me . Those gentry left nothing to chance . I finished Turnbull 's bread and cheese , and pretty soon I had finished the stones . The next step was what puzzled me . I could not keep up this roadmaking business for long . A merciful Providence had kept Mr Turnbull indoors , but if he appeared on the scene there would be trouble . I had a notion that the cordon was still tight round the glen , and that if I walked in any direction I should meet with questioners . But get out I must . No man 's nerve could stand more than a day of being spied on . I stayed at my post till five o'clock . By that time I had resolved to go down to Turnbull 's cottage at nightfall and take my chance of getting over the hills in the darkness . But suddenly a new car came up the road , and slowed down a yard or two from me . A fresh wind had risen , and the occupant wanted to light a cigarette . It was a touring car , with the tonneau full of an assortment of baggage . One man sat in it , and by an amazing chance I knew him . His name was Marmaduke Jopley , and he was an offence to creation . He was a sort of blood stockbroker , who did his business by toadying eldest sons and rich young peers and foolish old ladies . '
22424	22591	22594	22594	Jopley	191	' was a familiar figure , I understood , at balls and polo - weeks and country houses . He was an adroit scandal - monger , and would crawl a mile on his belly to anything that had a title or a million . I had a business introduction to his firm when I came to London , and he was good enough to ask me to dinner at his club . There he showed off at a great rate , and pattered about his duchesses till the snobbery of the creature turned me sick . I asked a man afterwards why nobody kicked him , and was told that Englishmen reverenced the weaker sex . Anyhow there he was now , nattily dressed , in a fine new car , obviously on his way to visit some of his smart friends . A sudden daftness took me , and in a second I had jumped into the tonneau and had him by the shoulder . '
22596	22601	22594	22594	Jopley	191	' I sang out . '
22608	22624	22594	22594	Jopley	191	' He got a horrid fright . His chin dropped as he stared at me . '

Over my dirty trousers and vulgar shirt I put on his smart driving - coat , which buttoned high at the top and thereby hid the deficiencies of my collar . I stuck the cap on my head , and added his gloves to my get - up . The dusty roadman in a minute was transformed into one of the neatest motorists in Scotland . On Mr Jopley 's head I clapped Turnbull 's unspeakable hat , and told him to keep it there . Then with some difficulty I turned the car . My plan was to go back the road he had come , for the watchers , having seen it before , would probably let it pass unremarked , and Marmie 's figure was in no way like mine . '

28040	30846	30850	30850	them	1034	'm no good at these cold - blooded resolutions . Still I managed to rake up the pluck to set my teeth and choke back the horrid doubts that flooded in on me . I simply shut off my mind and pretended I was doing an experiment as simple as Guy Fawkes fireworks . I got a detonator , and fixed it to a couple of feet of fuse . Then I took a quarter of a lentonite brick , and buried it near the door below one of the sacks in a crack of the floor , fixing the detonator in it . For all I knew half those boxes might be dynamite . If the cupboard held such deadly explosives , why not the boxes ? In that case there would be a glorious skyward journey for me and the German servants and about an acre of surrounding country . There was also the risk that the detonation might set off the other bricks in the cupboard , for I had forgotten most that I knew about lentonite . But it did n't do to begin thinking about the possibilities . The odds were horrible , but I had to take them . I ensconced myself just below the sill of the window , and lit the fuse . Then I waited for a moment or two . There was dead silence - only a shuffle of heavy boots in the passage , and the peaceful cluck of hens from the warm out - of - doors . I commended my soul to my Maker , and wondered where I would be in five seconds ... A great wave of heat seemed to surge upwards from the floor , and hang for a blistering instant in the air . Then the wall opposite me flashed into a golden yellow and dissolved with a rending thunder that hammered my brain into a pulp . Something dropped on me , catching the point of my left shoulder . And then I think I became unconscious . My stupor can scarcely have lasted beyond a few seconds . I felt myself being choked by thick yellow fumes , and struggled out of the debris to my feet . Somewhere behind me I felt fresh air . The jambs of the window had fallen , and through the ragged rent the smoke was pouring out to the summer noon . I stepped over the broken lintel , and found myself standing in a yard in a dense and acrid fog . I felt very sick and ill , but I could move my limbs , and I staggered blindly forward away from the house . A small mill - lade ran in a wooden aqueduct at the other side of the yard , and into this I fell . The cool water revived me , and I had just enough wits left to think of escape . I squirmed up the lade among the slippery green slime till I reached the mill - wheel . Then I wriggled through the axle hole into the old mill and tumbled on to a bed of chaff . A nail caught the seat of my trousers , and I left a wisp of heather - mixture behind me . The mill had been long out of use . The ladders were rotten with age , and in the loft the rats had gnawed great holes in the floor . Nausea shook me , and a wheel in my head kept turning , while my left shoulder and arm seemed to be stricken with the palsy . I looked out of the window and saw a fog still hanging over the house and smoke escaping from an upper window . Please God I had set the place on fire , for I could hear confused cries coming from the other side . But I had no time to linger , since this mill was obviously a bad hiding - place . Anyone looking for me would naturally follow the lade , and I made certain the search would begin as soon as they found that my body was not in the storeroom . From another window I saw that on the far side of the mill stood an old stone dovecot . If I could get there without leaving tracks I might find a hiding - place , for I argued that my enemies , if they thought I could move , would conclude I had made for open country , and would go seeking me on the moor . I crawled down the broken ladder , scattering chaff behind me to cover my footsteps . I did the same on the mill floor , and on the threshold where the door hung on broken hinges . Peeping out , I saw that between me and the dovecot was a piece of bare cobbled ground , where no footmarks would show . Also it was mercifully hid by the mill buildings from any view from the house . I slipped across the space , got to the back of the dovecot and prospected a way of ascent . That was one of the hardest jobs I ever took on . My shoulder and arm ached like hell , and I was so sick and giddy that I was always on the verge of falling . But I managed it somehow . By the use of out - jutting stones and gaps in the masonry and a tough ivy root I got to the top in the end . There was a little parapet behind which I found space to lie down . Then I proceeded to go off into an old - fashioned swoon . I woke with a burning head and the sun glaring in my face . For a long time I lay motionless , for those horrible fumes seemed to have loosened my joints and dulled my brain . Sounds came to me from the house - men speaking throatily and the throbbing of a stationary car . There was a little gap in the parapet to which I wriggled , and from which I had some sort of prospect of the yard . I saw figures come out - a servant with his head bound up , and then a younger man in knickerbockers . They were looking for something , and moved towards the mill . Then one of them caught sight of the wisp of cloth on the nail , and cried out to the other . They both went back to the house , and brought two more to look at it . I saw the rotund figure of my late captor , and I thought I made out the man with the lisp . I noticed that all had pistols . For half an hour they ransacked the mill . I could hear them kicking over the barrels and pulling up the rotten planking . Then they came outside , and stood just below the dovecot arguing fiercely . The servant with the bandage was being soundly rated . I heard them fiddling with the door of the dovecote and for one horrid moment I fancied they were coming up . Then they thought better of it , and went back to the house . All that long blistering afternoon I lay baking on the rooftop . Thirst was my chief torment . My tongue was like a stick , and to make it worse I could hear the cool drip of water from the mill - lade . I watched the course of the little stream as it came in from the moor , and my fancy followed it to the top of the glen , where it must issue from an icy fountain fringed with cool ferns and mosses . I would have given a thousand pounds to plunge my face into that . I had a fine prospect of the whole ring of moorland . I saw the car speed away with two occupants , and a man on a hill pony riding east . I judged they were looking for me , and I wished them joy of their quest . But I saw something else more interesting . The house stood almost on the summit of a swell of moorland which crowned a sort of plateau , and there was no higher point nearer than the big hills six miles off . The actual summit , as I have mentioned , was a biggish clump of trees - firs mostly , with a few ashes and beeches . On the dovecot I was almost on a level with the tree - tops , and could see what lay beyond . The wood was not solid , but only a ring , and inside was an oval of green turf , for all the world like a big cricket - field . I did n't take long to guess what it was . It was an aerodrome , and a secret one . The place had been most cunningly chosen . For suppose anyone were watching an aeroplane descending here , he would think it had gone over the hill beyond the trees . As the place was on the top of a rise in the midst of a big amphitheatre , any observer from any direction would conclude it had passed out of view behind the hill . Only a man very close at hand would realize that the aeroplane had not gone over but had descended in the midst of the wood . An observer with a telescope on one of the higher hills might have discovered the truth , but only herds went there , and herds do not carry spy - glasses . When I looked from the dovecot I could see far away a blue line which I knew was the sea , and I grew furious to think that our enemies had this secret conning - tower to rake our waterways . Then I reflected that if that aeroplane came back the chances were ten to one that I would be discovered . So through the afternoon I lay and prayed for the coming of darkness , and glad I was when the sun went down over the big western hills and the twilight haze crept over the moor . The aeroplane was late . The gloaming was far advanced when I heard the beat of wings and saw it volplaning downward to its home in the wood . Lights twinkled for a bit and there was much coming and going from the house . Then the dark fell , and silence . Thank God it was a black night . The moon was well on its last quarter and would not rise till late . My thirst was too great to allow me to tarry , so about nine o'clock , so far as I could judge , I started to descend . It was n't easy , and half - way down I heard the back door of the house open , and saw the gleam of a lantern against the mill wall . For some agonizing minutes I hung by the ivy and prayed that whoever it was would not come round by the dovecot . Then the light disappeared , and I dropped as softly as I could on to the hard soil of the yard . I crawled on my belly in the lee of a stone dyke till I reached the fringe of trees which surrounded the house . If I had known how to do it I would have tried to put that aeroplane out of action , but I realized that any attempt would probably be futile . I was pretty certain that there would be some kind of defence round the house , so I went through the wood on hands and knees , feeling carefully every inch before me . It was as well , for presently I came on a wire about two feet from the ground . If I had tripped over that , it would doubtless have rung some bell in the house and I would have been captured . A hundred yards farther on I found another wire cunningly placed on the edge of a small stream . Beyond that lay the moor , and in five minutes I was deep in bracken and heather . Soon I was round the shoulder of the rise , in the little glen from which the mill - lade flowed . Ten minutes later my face was in the spring , and I was soaking down pints of the blessed water . But I did not stop till I had put half a dozen miles between me and that accursed dwelling . I sat down on a hill - top and took stock of my position . I was n't feeling very happy , for my natural thankfulness at my escape was clouded by my severe bodily discomfort . Those lentonite fumes had fairly poisoned me , and the baking hours on the dovecot had n't helped matters . I had a crushing headache , and felt as sick as a cat . Also my shoulder was in a bad way . At first I thought it was only a bruise , but it seemed to be swelling , and I had no use of my left arm . My plan was to seek Mr Turnbull 's cottage , recover my garments , and especially Scudder 's note - book , and then make for the main line and get back to the south . It seemed to me that the sooner I got in touch with the Foreign Office man , Sir Walter Bullivant , the better . I did n't see how I could get more proof than I had got already . He must just take or leave my story , and anyway , with him I would be in better hands than those devilish Germans . I had begun to feel quite kindly towards the British police . It was a wonderful starry night , and I had not much difficulty about the road . Sir Harry 's map had given me the lie of the land , and all I had to do was to steer a point or two west of south - west to come to the stream where I had met the roadman . In all these travels I never knew the names of the places , but I believe this stream was no less than the upper waters of the river Tweed . I calculated I must be about eighteen miles distant , and that meant I could not get there before morning . So I must lie up a day somewhere , for I was too outrageous a figure to be seen in the sunlight . I had neither coat , waistcoat , collar , nor hat , my trousers were badly torn , and my face and hands were black with the explosion . I daresay I had other beauties , for my eyes felt as if they were furiously bloodshot . Altogether I was no spectacle for God - fearing citizens to see on a highroad . Very soon after daybreak I made an attempt to clean myself in a hill burn , and then approached a herd 's cottage , for I was feeling the need of food . The herd was away from home , and his wife was alone , with no neighbour for five miles . She was a decent old body , and a plucky one , for though she got a fright when she saw me , she had an axe handy , and would have used it on any evil - doer . I told her that I had had a fall - I did n't say how - and she saw by my looks that I was pretty sick . Like a true Samaritan she asked no questions , but gave me a bowl of milk with a dash of whisky in it , and let me sit for a little by her kitchen fire . She would have bathed my shoulder , but it ached so badly that I would not let her touch it . I do n't know what she took me for - a repentant burglar , perhaps ; for when I wanted to pay her for the milk and tendered a sovereign which was the smallest coin I had , she shook her head and said something about '
30857	31225	31338	31338	man	344	' . At this I protested so strongly that I think she believed me honest , for she took the money and gave me a warm new plaid for it , and an old hat of her man 's . She showed me how to wrap the plaid around my shoulders , and when I left that cottage I was the living image of the kind of Scotsman you see in the illustrations to Burns 's poems . But at any rate I was more or less clad . It was as well , for the weather changed before midday to a thick drizzle of rain . I found shelter below an overhanging rock in the crook of a burn , where a drift of dead brackens made a tolerable bed . There I managed to sleep till nightfall , waking very cramped and wretched , with my shoulder gnawing like a toothache . I ate the oatcake and cheese the old wife had given me and set out again just before the darkening . I pass over the miseries of that night among the wet hills . There were no stars to steer by , and I had to do the best I could from my memory of the map . Twice I lost my way , and I had some nasty falls into peat - bogs . I had only about ten miles to go as the crow flies , but my mistakes made it nearer twenty . The last bit was completed with set teeth and a very light and dizzy head . But I managed it , and in the early dawn I was knocking at Mr Turnbull 's door . The mist lay close and thick , and from the cottage I could not see the highroad . Mr Turnbull himself opened to me - sober and something more than sober . He was primly dressed in an ancient but well - tended suit of black ; he had been shaved not later than the night before ; he wore a linen collar ; and in his left hand he carried a pocket Bible . At first he did not recognize me . '
31232	31238	31338	31338	man	344	' here on the Sabbath mornin '
31240	31292	31338	31338	man	344	' he asked . I had lost all count of the days . So the Sabbath was the reason for this strange decorum . My head was swimming so wildly that I could not frame a coherent answer . But he recognized me , and he saw that I was ill . '
31299	31316	31294	31294	ye	1035	' he asked . I fetched them out of my trouser pocket and gave him them . '
31326	31330	31317	31317	Ye'll	1035	' he said . '
31344	31358	31359	31359	I	0	' the legs . Haud up till I get ye to a chair . '
31611	31673	31605	31605	he	188	' old Scotsman , and I noticed that the interest in the Portland Place murder seemed to have died down . There was no mention of it , and I could find very little about anything except a thing called the General Assembly - some ecclesiastical spree , I gathered . One day he produced my belt from a lockfast drawer . '
31680	31684	31685	31685	he	188	' siller in't , '
31688	31698	31685	31685	he	188	' Ye'd better coont it to see it 's a '
31701	31729	31685	31685	he	188	' He never even sought my name . I asked him if anybody had been around making inquiries subsequent to my spell at the road - making . '
31776	31778	31772	31772	he	1043	' o '
31792	31800	31772	31772	he	1043	' . He was a wersh - lookin '
31810	31815	31816	31816	I	0	' his English tongue . '
31962	31967	31958	31958	he	1047	' ae guid turn deservin '
31969	32027	31958	31958	he	1047	' . You would have thought from our leave - taking that we had parted in disgust . Hislop was a cheery soul , who chattered all the way over the pass and down the sunny vale of Annan . I talked of Galloway markets and sheep prices , and he made up his mind I was a '
32031	32568	32569	32570	Annie Laurie	181	' from those parts - whatever that may be . My plaid and my old hat , as I have said , gave me a fine theatrical Scots look . But driving cattle is a mortally slow job , and we took the better part of the day to cover a dozen miles . If I had not had such an anxious heart I would have enjoyed that time . It was shining blue weather , with a constantly changing prospect of brown hills and far green meadows , and a continual sound of larks and curlews and falling streams . But I had no mind for the summer , and little for Hislop 's conversation , for as the fateful fifteenth of June drew near I was overweighed with the hopeless difficulties of my enterprise . I got some dinner in a humble Moffat public - house , and walked the two miles to the junction on the main line . The night express for the south was not due till near midnight , and to fill up the time I went up on the hillside and fell asleep , for the walk had tired me . I all but slept too long , and had to run to the station and catch the train with two minutes to spare . The feel of the hard third - class cushions and the smell of stale tobacco cheered me up wonderfully . At any rate , I felt now that I was getting to grips with my job . I was decanted at Crewe in the small hours and had to wait till six to get a train for Birmingham . In the afternoon I got to Reading , and changed into a local train which journeyed into the deeps of Berkshire . Presently I was in a land of lush water - meadows and slow reedy streams . About eight o'clock in the evening , a weary and travel - stained being - a cross between a farm - labourer and a vet - with a checked black - and - white plaid over his arm ( for I did not dare to wear it south of the Border ) , descended at the little station of Artinswell . There were several people on the platform , and I thought I had better wait to ask my way till I was clear of the place . The road led through a wood of great beeches and then into a shallow valley , with the green backs of downs peeping over the distant trees . After Scotland the air smelt heavy and flat , but infinitely sweet , for the limes and chestnuts and lilac bushes were domes of blossom . Presently I came to a bridge , below which a clear slow stream flowed between snowy beds of water - buttercups . A little above it was a mill ; and the lasher made a pleasant cool sound in the scented dusk . Somehow the place soothed me and put me at my ease . I fell to whistling as I looked into the green depths , and the tune which came to my lips was '
32571	32671	32569	32570	Annie Laurie	181	' . A fisherman came up from the waterside , and as he neared me he too began to whistle . The tune was infectious , for he followed my suit . He was a huge man in untidy old flannels and a wide - brimmed hat , with a canvas bag slung on his shoulder . He nodded to me , and I thought I had never seen a shrewder or better - tempered face . He leaned his delicate ten - foot split - cane rod against the bridge , and looked with me at the water . '
32678	32683	32684	32684	I	0	' he said pleasantly . '
32719	32721	32684	32684	I	0	'em . '

32732	32747	32731	32731	I.	0	' Look ! There ! A yard from the reeds just above that stickle . '
32748	32764	32684	32684	I	0	' I 've got him now . You might swear he was a black stone . '
32765	32768	32769	32769	he	1055	' So , '
32777	32780	32769	32769	he	1055	' Annie Laurie '
32782	32792	32793	32793	he	1055	' Twisdon 's the name , is n't it ? '

32814	32822	32811	32811	I	0	' I mean to say , Yes . '
32831	32843	32844	32844	he	1055	' It 's a wise conspirator that knows his own name , '
32916	32922	32923	32923	he	1055	' I call it disgraceful , '
32930	32963	32923	32923	he	1055	' Disgraceful that an able - bodied man like you should dare to beg . You can get a meal from my kitchen , but you 'll get no money from me . '
32996	33002	33003	33003	he	1055	' That 's my house , '
33016	33029	33003	33003	he	1055	' Wait five minutes and then go round to the back door . '
33086	33093	33094	33094	he	1065	' Come this way , Sir , '
33161	33177	33179	33180	the butler	1069	' Sir Walter thought as how Mr Reggie 's things would fit you , Sir , '
33182	33187	33179	33180	the butler	1069	' He keeps some clothes '

33557	33583	33584	33584	He	182	'm wanted by the police . I 've got to tell you this , and I wo n't be surprised if you kick me out . '
33587	33611	33584	33584	He	182	' That 's all right . Do n't let that interfere with your appetite . We can talk about these things after dinner . '
33827	33835	33836	33836	he	1590	' I 've obeyed Harry 's instructions , '
33839	33859	33836	33836	he	1590	' and the bribe he offered me was that you would tell me something to wake me up . I 'm
33865	33971	33836	33836	he	1590	' I noticed with a start that he called me by my proper name . I began at the very beginning . I told of my boredom in London , and the night I had come back to find Scudder gibbering on my doorstep . I told him all Scudder had told me about Karolides and the Foreign Office conference , and that made him purse his lips and grin . Then I got to the murder , and he grew solemn again . He heard all about the milkman and my time in Galloway , and my deciphering Scudder 's notes at the inn . '
33978	34027	34034	34034	he	177	' he asked sharply , and drew a long breath when I whipped the little book from my pocket . I said nothing of the contents . Then I described my meeting with Sir Harry , and the speeches at the hall . At that he laughed uproariously . '
34070	34140	34067	34068	Mr Hannay	140	' My day as roadman excited him a bit . He made me describe the two fellows in the car very closely , and seemed to be raking back in his memory . He grew merry again when he heard of the fate of that ass Jopley . But the old man in the moorland house solemnized him . Again I had to describe every detail of his appearance . '
34184	34210	34163	34163	you	1099	' Presently I reached the end of my wanderings . He got up slowly , and looked down at me from the hearth - rug . '
34220	34224	34225	34225	You	1099	' he said . '
34226	34237	34163	34163	you	1099	're in no danger from the law of this land . '
34238	34242	34243	34243	I	0	' Great Scot ! '
34246	34253	34243	34243	I	0	' Have they got the murderer ? '
34254	34272	34163	34163	you	1099	' No . But for the last fortnight they have dropped you from the list of possibles . '
34273	34276	34277	34277	I	0	' Why ? '
34282	34392	34277	34277	I	0	' Principally because I received a letter from Scudder . I knew something of the man , and he did several jobs for me . He was half crank , half genius , but he was wholly honest . The trouble about him was his partiality for playing a lone hand . That made him pretty well useless in any Secret Service - a pity , for he had uncommon gifts . I think he was the bravest man in the world , for he was always shivering with fright , and yet nothing would choke him off . I had a letter from him on the 31st of May. '
34393	34404	34163	34163	you	1099	' But he had been dead a week by then . '
34405	34461	34163	34163	you	1099	' The letter was written and posted on the 23rd . He evidently did not anticipate an immediate decease . His communications usually took a week to reach me , for they were sent under cover to Spain and then to Newcastle . He had a mania , you know , for concealing his tracks . '
34462	34468	34469	34469	I	0	' What did he say ? '
34472	34616	34469	34469	I	0	' Nothing . Merely that he was in danger , but had found shelter with a good friend , and that I would hear from him before the 15th of June . He gave me no address , but said he was living near Portland Place . I think his object was to clear you if anything happened . When I got it I went to Scotland Yard , went over the details of the inquest , and concluded that you were the friend . We made inquiries about you , Mr Hannay , and found you were respectable . I thought I knew the motives for your disappearance - not only the police , the other one too - and when I got Harry 's scrawl I guessed at the rest . I have been expecting you any time this past week . '
34656	34667	34669	34670	Sir Walter	182	' Now let us have the little note - book , '
34737	34748	34749	34749	he	182	' I do n't know what to make of it , '
34754	34873	34749	34749	he	182	' He is right about one thing - what is going to happen the day after tomorrow . How the devil can it have got known ? That is ugly enough in itself . But all this about war and the Black Stone - it reads like some wild melodrama . If only I had more confidence in Scudder 's judgement . The trouble about him was that he was too romantic . He had the artistic temperament , and wanted a story to be better than God meant it to be . He had a lot of odd biases , too . Jews , for example , made him see red . Jews and the high finance . '
34878	34882	34749	34749	he	182	' he repeated . '
35078	35087	35055	35055	They	1111	' Just then the butler entered the room . '
35103	35115	35102	35104	Mr ' Eath	210	' Eath , and he wants to speak to you personally . '
35134	35143	35144	35144	he	1590	' I apologize to the shade of Scudder , '
35147	35161	35144	35144	he	1590	' Karolides was shot dead this evening at a few minutes after seven . '
35203	35218	35219	35219	he	1590	' I had a busy hour on the telephone after you went to bed , '
35222	35282	35219	35219	he	1590	' I got my Chief to speak to the First Lord and the Secretary for War , and they are bringing Royer over a day sooner . This wire clinches it . He will be in London at five . Odd that the code word for a Sous - chef d'état Major - General should be " Porker " . '
35294	35373	35283	35283	He	1590	' Not that I think it will do much good . If your friends were clever enough to find out the first arrangement they are clever enough to discover the change . I would give my head to know where the leak is . We believed there were only five men in England who knew about Royer 's visit , and you may be certain there were fewer in France , for they manage these things better there . '
35394	35402	35403	35403	I	0	' Can the dispositions not be changed ? '
35406	35410	35411	35411	he	1590	' They could , '
35414	35571	35411	35411	he	1590	' But we want to avoid that if possible . They are the result of immense thought , and no alteration would be as good . Besides , on one or two points change is simply impossible . Still , something could be done , I suppose , if it were absolutely necessary . But you see the difficulty , Hannay . Our enemies are not going to be such fools as to pick Royer 's pocket or any childish game like that . They know that would mean a row and put us on our guard . Their aim is to get the details without any one of us knowing , so that Royer will go back to Paris in the belief that the whole business is still deadly secret . If they ca n't do that they fail , for , once we suspect , they know that the whole thing must be altered . '
35572	35588	35589	35589	I	0	' Then we must stick by the Frenchman 's side till he is home again , '
35592	35629	35589	35589	I	0	' If they thought they could get the information in Paris they would try there . It means that they have some deep scheme on foot in London which they reckon is going to win out . '
35630	35774	35411	35411	he	1590	' Royer dines with my Chief , and then comes to my house where four people will see him - Whittaker from the Admiralty , myself , Sir Arthur Drew , and General Winstanley . The First Lord is ill , and has gone to Sheringham . At my house he will get a certain document from Whittaker , and after that he will be motored to Portsmouth where a destroyer will take him to Havre . His journey is too important for the ordinary boat - train . He will never be left unattended for a moment till he is safe on French soil . The same with Whittaker till he meets Royer . That is the best we can do , and it 's hard to see how there can be any miscarriage . But I do n't mind admitting that I 'm
35792	35805	35781	35781	Karolides	141	' After breakfast he asked me if I could drive a car . '
35821	35859	35820	35820	You	1115	're about his size . You have a hand in this business and we are taking no risks . There are desperate men against us , who will not respect the country retreat of an overworked official . '
36007	36017	35993	36003	a prim gentleman , with a clean - shaven , lawyer	1130	' I 've brought you the Portland Place murderer , '
36031	36061	35979	35979	he	1069	' It would have been a welcome present , Bullivant . This , I presume , is Mr Richard Hannay , who for some days greatly interested my department . '
36062	36123	35979	35979	he	1069	' Mr Hannay will interest it again . He has much to tell you , but not today . For certain grave reasons his tale must wait for four hours . Then , I can promise you , you will be entertained and possibly edified . I want you to assure Mr Hannay that he will suffer no further inconvenience . '
36130	36142	36143	36143	I	0	' You can take up your life where you left off , '
36147	36203	36143	36143	I	0	' Your flat , which probably you no longer wish to occupy , is waiting for you , and your man is still there . As you were never publicly accused , we considered that there was no need of a public exculpation . But on that , of course , you must please yourself . '
36204	36215	36216	36217	Sir Walter	182	' We may want your assistance later on , MacGillivray , '
36229	36290	36224	36224	he	182	' Come and see me tomorrow , Hannay . I need n't tell you to keep deadly quiet . If I were you I would go to bed , for you must have considerable arrears of sleep to overtake . You had better lie low , for if one of your Black Stone friends saw you there might be trouble . '
36954	36961	36962	36962	he	1645	' By God , the murderer ! '
36965	36987	36988	36988	He	1645	' Here , you fellows , hold him ! That 's Hannay , the man who did the Portland Place murder ! '
37210	37217	37218	37218	I	0	' Oh , damn it all , '
37221	37258	37218	37218	I	0	' make the fellow shut up . I advise you to leave me alone , constable . Scotland Yard knows all about me , and you 'll get a proper wigging if you interfere with me . '
37259	37272	37274	37275	the policeman	595	' You 've got to come along of me , young man , '
37277	37285	37274	37275	the policeman	595	' I saw you strike that gentleman crool '
37316	37573	37574	37574	I	0	' Exasperation and an overwhelming sense that at no cost must I delay gave me the strength of a bull elephant . I fairly wrenched the constable off his feet , floored the man who was gripping my collar , and set off at my best pace down Duke Street . I heard a whistle being blown , and the rush of men behind me . I have a very fair turn of speed , and that night I had wings . In a jiffy I was in Pall Mall and had turned down towards St James 's Park . I dodged the policeman at the Palace gates , dived through a press of carriages at the entrance to the Mall , and was making for the bridge before my pursuers had crossed the roadway . In the open ways of the Park I put on a spurt . Happily there were few people about and no one tried to stop me . I was staking all on getting to Queen Anne 's Gate . When I entered that quiet thoroughfare it seemed deserted . Sir Walter 's house was in the narrow part , and outside it three or four motor - cars were drawn up . I slackened speed some yards off and walked briskly up to the door . If the butler refused me admission , or if he even delayed to open the door , I was done . He did n't delay . I had scarcely rung before the door opened . '
37580	37584	37574	37574	I	0	' I panted . '
37591	37616	37574	37574	I	0	' That butler was a great man . Without moving a muscle he held the door open , and then shut it behind me . '
37638	37686	37634	37634	you	305	' The house was of the old - fashioned kind , with a wide hall and rooms on both sides of it . At the far end was an alcove with a telephone and a couple of chairs , and there the butler offered me a seat . '
37690	37694	37634	37634	you	305	' I whispered . '
37701	37712	37715	37715	him	182	'm in it . But Sir Walter knows , and I 'm
37732	38237	37728	37728	him	242	' He nodded , and presently there was a noise of voices in the street , and a furious ringing at the bell . I never admired a man more than that butler . He opened the door , and with a face like a graven image waited to be questioned . Then he gave them it . He told them whose house it was , and what his orders were , and simply froze them off the doorstep . I could see it all from my alcove , and it was better than any play . I had n't waited long till there came another ring at the bell . The butler made no bones about admitting this new visitor . While he was taking off his coat I saw who it was . You could n't open a newspaper or a magazine without seeing that face - the grey beard cut like a spade , the firm fighting mouth , the blunt square nose , and the keen blue eyes . I recognized the First Sea Lord , the man , they say , that made the new British Navy . He passed my alcove and was ushered into a room at the back of the hall . As the door opened I could hear the sound of low voices . It shut , and I was left alone again . For twenty minutes I sat there , wondering what I was to do next . I was still perfectly convinced that I was wanted , but when or how I had no notion . I kept looking at my watch , and as the time crept on to half - past ten I began to think that the conference must soon end . In a quarter of an hour Royer should be speeding along the road to Portsmouth ... Then I heard a bell ring , and the butler appeared . The door of the back room opened , and the First Sea Lord came out . He walked past me , and in passing he glanced in my direction , and for a second we looked each other in the face . Only for a second , but it was enough to make my heart jump . I had never seen the great man before , and he had never seen me . But in that fraction of time something sprang into his eyes , and that something was recognition . You ca n't mistake it . It is a flicker , a spark of light , a minute shade of difference which means one thing and one thing only . It came involuntarily , for in a moment it died , and he passed on . In a maze of wild fancies I heard the street door close behind him . I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of his house . We were connected at once , and I heard a servant 's voice . '

38257	38262	38249	38250	His Lordship	1179	' said the voice , '
38284	38439	38277	38277	you	1182	' I rang off and almost tumbled into a chair . My part in this business was not yet ended . It had been a close shave , but I had been in time . Not a moment could be lost , so I marched boldly to the door of that back room and entered without knocking . Five surprised faces looked up from a round table . There was Sir Walter , and Drew the War Minister , whom I knew from his photographs . There was a slim elderly man , who was probably Whittaker , the Admiralty official , and there was General Winstanley , conspicuous from the long scar on his forehead . Lastly , there was a short stout man with an iron - grey moustache and bushy eyebrows , who had been arrested in the middle of a sentence . Sir Walter 's face showed surprise and annoyance . '
38453	38461	38462	38462	I	0	' he said apologetically to the company . '
38463	38475	38277	38277	you	1182	'm afraid , Hannay , this visit is ill - timed . '
38483	38492	38493	38493	I	0	' That remains to be seen , Sir , '
38496	38525	38493	38493	I	0	' but I think it may be in the nick of time . For God 's sake , gentlemen , tell me who went out a minute ago ? '
38526	38530	38531	38532	Sir Walter	182	' Lord Alloa , '
38539	38544	38545	38545	I	0	' It was not , '
38548	38609	38545	38545	I	0	' it was his living image , but it was not Lord Alloa . It was someone who recognized me , someone I have seen in the last month . He had scarcely left the doorstep when I rang up Lord Alloa 's house and was told he had come in half an hour before and had gone to bed . '
38610	38614	38615	38615	someone	452	' Who - who- '
38618	38623	38624	38624	I	0	' The Black Stone , '
38646	38649	38651	38655	the official from the Admiralty	1187	' Nonsense ! '
38684	38691	38692	38692	he	182	' I have spoken to Alloa , '
38695	38714	38692	38692	he	182	' Had him out of bed - very grumpy . He went straight home after Mulross 's dinner . '
38715	38721	38724	38725	General Winstanley	215	' But it 's madness , '
38727	38768	38724	38725	General Winstanley	215	' Do you mean to tell me that that man came here and sat beside me for the best part of half an hour and that I did n't detect the imposture ? Alloa must be out of his mind . '
38769	38779	38780	38780	I	0	' Do n't you see the cleverness of it ? '
38783	38834	38780	38780	I	0	' You were too interested in other things to have any eyes . You took Lord Alloa for granted . If it had been anybody else you might have looked more closely , but it was natural for him to be here , and that put you all to sleep . '
38847	38866	38867	38867	He	2201	' The young man is right . His psychology is good . Our enemies have not been foolish ! '
38876	38884	38885	38885	he	2201	' I will tell you a tale , '
38888	39066	38885	38885	he	2201	' It happened many years ago in Senegal . I was quartered in a remote station , and to pass the time used to go fishing for big barbel in the river . A little Arab mare used to carry my luncheon basket - one of the salted dun breed you got at Timbuctoo in the old days . Well , one morning I had good sport , and the mare was unaccountably restless . I could hear her whinnying and squealing and stamping her feet , and I kept soothing her with my voice while my mind was intent on fish . I could see her all the time , as I thought , out of a corner of my eye , tethered to a tree twenty yards away . After a couple of hours I began to think of food . I collected my fish in a tarpaulin bag , and moved down the stream towards the mare , trolling my line . When I got up to her I flung the tarpaulin on her back- '
39073	39132	39067	39067	He	1192	' It was the smell that gave me warning . I turned my head and found myself looking at a lion three feet off ... An old man - eater , that was the terror of the village ... What was left of the mare , a mass of blood and bones and hide , was behind him . '
39133	39137	39138	39138	I	0	' What happened ? '
39157	39190	39191	39191	He	1194	' I stuffed my fishing - rod into his jaws , and I had a pistol . Also my servants came presently with rifles . But he left his mark on me . '
39201	39204	39205	39205	he	1194	' Consider , '
39208	39300	39205	39205	he	1194	' The mare had been dead more than an hour , and the brute had been patiently watching me ever since . I never saw the kill , for I was accustomed to the mare 's fretting , and I never marked her absence , for my consciousness of her was only of something tawny , and the lion filled that part . If I could blunder thus , gentlemen , in a land where men 's senses are keen , why should we busy preoccupied urban folk not err also ? '
39313	39320	39323	39323	Winstanley	215	' But I do n't see , '
39325	39360	39323	39323	Winstanley	215	' Their object was to get these dispositions without our knowing it . Now it only required one of us to mention to Alloa our meeting tonight for the whole fraud to be exposed . '
39366	39396	39361	39362	Sir Walter	182	' The selection of Alloa shows their acumen . Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight ? Or was he likely to open the subject ? '
39412	39420	39422	39423	the General	1196	' The one thing that puzzles me , '
39425	39454	39422	39423	the General	1196	' is what good his visit here would do that spy fellow ? He could not carry away several pages of figures and strange names in his head . '
39455	39461	39462	39463	the Frenchman	2201	' That is not difficult , '
39466	39524	39462	39463	the Frenchman	2201	' A good spy is trained to have a photographic memory . Like your own Macaulay . You noticed he said nothing , but went through these papers again and again . I think we may assume that he has every detail stamped on his mind . When I was younger I could do the same trick . '
39525	39541	39543	39544	Sir Walter	182	' Well , I suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans , '
39553	39563	39564	39564	he	213	' Did you tell Lord Alloa what has happened ? '
39567	39582	39564	39564	he	213	' No ? Well , I ca n't speak with absolute assurance , but I 'm

39708	39712	39686	39687	Good God	147	' said Whittaker , '

39733	39738	39739	39739	You	1206	' said the Frenchman . '
39813	39881	39801	39801	me	0	' Royer 's grave good sense seemed to pull us together . He was the man of action among fumblers . But I saw no hope in any face , and I felt none . Where among the fifty millions of these islands and within a dozen hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest rogues in Europe ? Then suddenly I had an inspiration . '
39888	39895	39884	39884	Scudder	148	' I cried to Sir Walter . '
39906	39965	39884	39884	Scudder	148	' He unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me . I found the place . thirty - nine steps , I read , and again , thirty - nine steps - I counted them - high tide 10.17 P.M. The Admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought I had gone mad . '
39975	39979	39980	39980	Scudder	148	' I shouted . '
40023	40024	40025	40025	They	1215	' '
40031	40035	40037	40037	they	1215	' someone said . '
40080	40085	40059	40059	they	222	' Whittaker brightened up . '
40091	40095	40059	40059	they	222	' he said . '
40104	40129	40059	40059	they	222	' We got into two of the waiting motor - cars - all but Sir Walter , who went off to Scotland Yard - to '
40132	40809	40059	40059	they	222	' , so he said . We marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers where the charwomen were busy , till we reached a little room lined with books and maps . A resident clerk was unearthed , who presently fetched from the library the Admiralty Tide Tables . I sat at the desk and the others stood round , for somehow or other I had got charge of this expedition . It was no good . There were hundreds of entries , and so far as I could see 10.17 might cover fifty places . We had to find some way of narrowing the possibilities . I took my head in my hands and thought . There must be some way of reading this riddle . What did Scudder mean by steps ? I thought of dock steps , but if he had meant that I did n't think he would have mentioned the number . It must be some place where there were several staircases , and one marked out from the others by having thirty - nine steps . Then I had a sudden thought , and hunted up all the steamer sailings . There was no boat which left for the Continent at 10.17 p.m. Why was high tide so important ? If it was a harbour it must be some little place where the tide mattered , or else it was a heavy - draught boat . But there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour , and somehow I did n't think they would travel by a big boat from a regular harbour . So it must be some little harbour where the tide was important , or perhaps no harbour at all . But if it was a little port I could n't see what the steps signified . There were no sets of staircases on any harbour that I had ever seen . It must be some place which a particular staircase identified , and where the tide was full at 10.17 . On the whole it seemed to me that the place must be a bit of open coast . But the staircases kept puzzling me . Then I went back to wider considerations . Whereabouts would a man be likely to leave for Germany , a man in a hurry , who wanted a speedy and a secret passage ? Not from any of the big harbours . And not from the Channel or the West Coast or Scotland , for , remember , he was starting from London . I measured the distance on the map , and tried to put myself in the enemy 's shoes . I should try for Ostend or Antwerp or Rotterdam , and I should sail from somewhere on the East Coast between Cromer and Dover . All this was very loose guessing , and I do n't pretend it was ingenious or scientific . I was n't any kind of Sherlock Holmes . But I have always fancied I had a kind of instinct about questions like this . I do n't know if I can explain myself , but I used to use my brains as far as they went , and after they came to a blank wall I guessed , and I usually found my guesses pretty right . So I set out all my conclusions on a bit of Admiralty paper . They ran like this : FAIRLY CERTAIN ( 1 ) Place where there are several sets of stairs ; one that matters distinguished by having thirty - nine steps . ( 2 ) Full tide at 10.17 p.m. Leaving shore only possible at full tide . ( 3 ) Steps not dock steps , and so place probably not harbour . ( 4 ) No regular night steamer at 10.17 . Means of transport must be tramp ( unlikely ) , yacht , or fishing - boat . There my reasoning stopped . I made another list , which I headed '
40811	40970	40059	40059	they	222	' , but I was just as sure of the one as the other . GUESSED ( 1 ) Place not harbour but open coast . ( 2 ) Boat small - trawler , yacht , or launch . ( 3 ) Place somewhere on East Coast between Cromer and Dover . It struck me as odd that I should be sitting at that desk with a Cabinet Minister , a Field - Marshal , two high Government officials , and a French General watching me , while from the scribble of a dead man I was trying to drag a secret which meant life or death for us . Sir Walter had joined us , and presently MacGillivray arrived . He had sent out instructions to watch the ports and railway stations for the three men whom I had described to Sir Walter . Not that he or anybody else thought that that would do much good . '
40981	40985	40975	40975	I	0	' I said . '
41047	41054	41057	41060	no Inspector of Coastguards	1225	' Then an idea struck me . '
41072	41189	41190	41190	We	1228	' Whittaker said there was , and that he lived in Clapham . He went off in a car to fetch him , and the rest of us sat about the little room and talked of anything that came into our heads . I lit a pipe and went over the whole thing again till my brain grew weary . About one in the morning the coastguard man arrived . He was a fine old fellow , with the look of a naval officer , and was desperately respectful to the company . I left the War Minister to cross - examine him , for I felt he would think it cheek in me to talk . '
41221	41228	41234	41234	you	1229	' He thought for a bit . '
41277	41284	41265	41265	you	1229	' Sir Arthur looked towards me . '
41290	41301	41285	41285	We	1228	' I said . He reflected a minute or two . '

41490	41515	41516	41516	We	1250	' I tore open the Tide Tables and found Bradgate . High tide there was at 10.27 P.m . on the 15th of June . '

41544	41553	41555	41557	the coastguard man	2384	' I can tell you that , Sir , '
41559	41595	41555	41557	the coastguard man	2384	' I once was lent a house there in this very month , and I used to go out at night to the deep - sea fishing . The tide 's ten minutes before Bradgate . '
41607	41626	41627	41627	I	0	' If one of those staircases has thirty - nine steps we have solved the mystery , gentlemen , '
41630	41667	41627	41627	I	0	' I want the loan of your car , Sir Walter , and a map of the roads . If Mr MacGillivray will spare me ten minutes , I think we can prepare something for tomorrow . '
41734	41739	41740	41740	he	211	' I for one , '
41743	41756	41740	41740	he	211	' am content to leave the matter in Mr Hannay 's hands . '
42019	42040	42007	42007	He	224	' Thirty - four , thirty - five , thirty - nine , forty - two , forty - seven , '
42042	42046	42007	42007	He	224	' twenty - one '
43610	43614	43601	43601	his	1373	' he said . '
43641	44101	43627	43627	I	0	' You could n't find anything much more English than that . They all went into the house , and left me feeling a precious idiot . I had been barking up the wrong tree this time . These men might be acting ; but if they were , where was their audience ? They did n't know I was sitting thirty yards off in a rhododendron . It was simply impossible to believe that these three hearty fellows were anything but what they seemed - three ordinary , game - playing , suburban Englishmen , wearisome , if you like , but sordidly innocent . And yet there were three of them ; and one was old , and one was plump , and one was lean and dark ; and their house chimed in with Scudder 's notes ; and half a mile off was lying a steam yacht with at least one German officer . I thought of Karolides lying dead and all Europe trembling on the edge of earthquake , and the men I had left behind me in London who were waiting anxiously for the events of the next hours . There was no doubt that hell was afoot somewhere . The Black Stone had won , and if it survived this June night would bank its winnings . There seemed only one thing to do - go forward as if I had no doubts , and if I was going to make a fool of myself to do it handsomely . Never in my life have I faced a job with greater disinclination . I would rather in my then mind have walked into a den of anarchists , each with his Browning handy , or faced a charging lion with a popgun , than enter that happy home of three cheerful Englishmen and tell them that their game was up . How they would laugh at me ! But suddenly I remembered a thing I once heard in Rhodesia from old Peter Pienaar . I have quoted Peter already in this narrative . He was the best scout I ever knew , and before he had turned respectable he had been pretty often on the windy side of the law , when he had been wanted badly by the authorities . Peter once discussed with me the question of disguises , and he had a theory which struck me at the time . He said , barring absolute certainties like fingerprints , mere physical traits were very little use for identification if the fugitive really knew his business . He laughed at things like dyed hair and false beards and such childish follies . The only thing that mattered was what Peter called '
44103	44316	43627	43627	I	0	' . If a man could get into perfectly different surroundings from those in which he had been first observed , and - this is the important part - really play up to these surroundings and behave as if he had never been out of them , he would puzzle the cleverest detectives on earth . And he used to tell a story of how he once borrowed a black coat and went to church and shared the same hymn - book with the man that was looking for him . If that man had seen him in decent company before he would have recognized him ; but he had only seen him snuffing the lights in a public - house with a revolver . The recollection of Peter 's talk gave me the first real comfort that I had had that day . Peter had been a wise old bird , and these fellows I was after were about the pick of the aviary . What if they were playing Peter 's game ? A fool tries to look different : a clever man looks the same and is different . Again , there was that other maxim of Peter 's which had helped me when I had been a roadman . '
44339	45436	44331	44331	you	1378	' That would explain the game of tennis . Those chaps did n't need to act , they just turned a handle and passed into another life , which came as naturally to them as the first . It sounds a platitude , but Peter used to say that it was the big secret of all the famous criminals . It was now getting on for eight o'clock , and I went back and saw Scaife to give him his instructions . I arranged with him how to place his men , and then I went for a walk , for I did n't feel up to any dinner . I went round the deserted golf - course , and then to a point on the cliffs farther north beyond the line of the villas . On the little trim newly - made roads I met people in flannels coming back from tennis and the beach , and a coastguard from the wireless station , and donkeys and pierrots padding homewards . Out at sea in the blue dusk I saw lights appear on the Ariadne and on the destroyer away to the south , and beyond the Cock sands the bigger lights of steamers making for the Thames . The whole scene was so peaceful and ordinary that I got more dashed in spirits every second . It took all my resolution to stroll towards Trafalgar Lodge about half - past nine . On the way I got a piece of solid comfort from the sight of a greyhound that was swinging along at a nursemaid 's heels . He reminded me of a dog I used to have in Rhodesia , and of the time when I took him hunting with me in the Pali hills . We were after rhebok , the dun kind , and I recollected how we had followed one beast , and both he and I had clean lost it . A greyhound works by sight , and my eyes are good enough , but that buck simply leaked out of the landscape . Afterwards I found out how it managed it . Against the grey rock of the kopjes it showed no more than a crow against a thundercloud . It did n't need to run away ; all it had to do was to stand still and melt into the background . Suddenly as these memories chased across my brain I thought of my present case and applied the moral . The Black Stone did n't need to bolt . They were quietly absorbed into the landscape . I was on the right track , and I jammed that down in my mind and vowed never to forget it . The last word was with Peter Pienaar . Scaife 's men would be posted now , but there was no sign of a soul . The house stood as open as a market - place for anybody to observe . A three - foot railing separated it from the cliff road ; the windows on the ground - floor were all open , and shaded lights and the low sound of voices revealed where the occupants were finishing dinner . Everything was as public and above - board as a charity bazaar . Feeling the greatest fool on earth , I opened the gate and rang the bell . A man of my sort , who has travelled about the world in rough places , gets on perfectly well with two classes , what you may call the upper and the lower . He understands them and they understand him . I was at home with herds and tramps and roadmen , and I was sufficiently at my ease with people like Sir Walter and the men I had met the night before . I ca n't explain why , but it is a fact . But what fellows like me do n't understand is the great comfortable , satisfied middle - class world , the folk that live in villas and suburbs . He does n't know how they look at things , he does n't understand their conventions , and he is as shy of them as of a black mamba . When a trim parlour - maid opened the door , I could hardly find my voice . I asked for Mr Appleton , and was ushered in . My plan had been to walk straight into the dining - room , and by a sudden appearance wake in the men that start of recognition which would confirm my theory . But when I found myself in that neat hall the place mastered me . There were the golf - clubs and tennis - rackets , the straw hats and caps , the rows of gloves , the sheaf of walking - sticks , which you will find in ten thousand British homes . A stack of neatly folded coats and waterproofs covered the top of an old oak chest ; there was a grandfather clock ticking ; and some polished brass warming - pans on the walls , and a barometer , and a print of Chiltern winning the St Leger . The place was as orthodox as an Anglican church . When the maid asked me for my name I gave it automatically , and was shown into the smoking - room , on the right side of the hall . That room was even worse . I had n't time to examine it , but I could see some framed group photographs above the mantelpiece , and I could have sworn they were English public school or college . I had only one glance , for I managed to pull myself together and go after the maid . But I was too late . She had already entered the dining - room and given my name to her master , and I had missed the chance of seeing how the three took it . When I walked into the room the old man at the head of the table had risen and turned round to meet me . He was in evening dress - a short coat and black tie , as was the other , whom I called in my own mind the plump one . The third , the dark fellow , wore a blue serge suit and a soft white collar , and the colours of some club or school . The old man 's manner was perfect . '
45440	45445	44331	44331	you	1378	' he said hesitatingly . '
45475	45506	45507	45507	I	0	' Though I had n't an ounce of confidence in me , I forced myself to play the game . I pulled up a chair and sat down on it . '
45514	45518	45507	45507	I	0	' I said , '
45527	45555	45522	45522	you	140	' The light in the room was dim , but so far as I could see their faces , they played the part of mystification very well . '
45560	45566	45522	45522	you	140	' said the old man . '
45577	45596	45576	45576	I	0	'm afraid you must tell me your errand , Sir , for I really do n't know it . '
45597	45602	45603	45603	I	0	' Well , then , '
45642	45643	45630	45630	I	0	' '
45646	45658	45630	45630	I	0	' said the old man , and he looked really shocked . '
45667	45668	45661	45662	Good God	147	' '
45685	45686	45687	45687	I	0	' '
45694	45711	45687	45687	I	0	' said the old man in a dazed voice . One of the others spoke up . '
45740	45741	45736	45736	you	140	' '
45745	45799	45736	45736	you	140	' I said . After that for a minute there was utter silence . The old man was staring at his plate and fumbling with a nut , the very model of innocent bewilderment . Then the plump one spoke up . He stammered a little , like a man picking his words . '
45807	45811	45805	45805	uncle	1385	' he said . '
45881	45882	45873	45873	you	140	' '
45980	45994	45995	45995	I	0	' He pointed to an object on the table , and laughed nervously . '
46000	46010	45995	45995	I	0	' said the young man , addressing me respectfully , '
46048	46049	46052	46052	Bob	228	' '
46054	46065	46052	46052	Bob	228	' The old fellow seemed to be recovering his voice . '
46097	46098	46090	46090	I	0	' '
46104	46110	46100	46100	Nellie	234	' said the plump man . '
46137	46146	46129	46129	you	305	' and he began to laugh very pleasantly . '
46218	46535	46206	46206	I	0	' It could n't be acting , it was too confoundedly genuine . My heart went into my boots , and my first impulse was to apologize and clear out . But I told myself I must see it through , even though I was to be the laughing - stock of Britain . The light from the dinner - table candlesticks was not very good , and to cover my confusion I got up , walked to the door and switched on the electric light . The sudden glare made them blink , and I stood scanning the three faces . Well , I made nothing of it . One was old and bald , one was stout , one was dark and thin . There was nothing in their appearance to prevent them being the three who had hunted me in Scotland , but there was nothing to identify them . I simply ca n't explain why I who , as a roadman , had looked into two pairs of eyes , and as Ned Ainslie into another pair , why I , who have a good memory and reasonable powers of observation , could find no satisfaction . They seemed exactly what they professed to be , and I could not have sworn to one of them . There in that pleasant dining - room , with etchings on the walls , and a picture of an old lady in a bib above the mantelpiece , I could see nothing to connect them with the moorland desperadoes . There was a silver cigarette - box beside me , and I saw that it had been won by Percival Appleton , Esq . , of the St Bede 's Club , in a golf tournament . I had to keep a firm hold of Peter Pienaar to prevent myself bolting out of that house . '
46538	46545	46547	46547	you	1397	' said the old man politely , '
46555	46563	46564	46564	I	0	' I could n't find a word . '
46598	46604	46605	46606	O Lord	1400	' I shook my head . '
46608	46614	46605	46606	O Lord	1400	' said the young man . '
46622	46623	46605	46606	O Lord	1400	' '
46636	46642	46625	46625	you	1397	' asked the plump one . '
46712	46768	46707	46707	you	1397	' There was nothing to do except to call in my men and have them arrested , or to confess my blunder and clear out . I felt mesmerized by the whole place , by the air of obvious innocence - not innocence merely , but frank honest bewilderment and concern in the three faces . '
46774	46797	46771	46772	Peter Pienaar	229	' I groaned inwardly , and for a moment I was very near damning myself for a fool and asking their pardon . '
46808	46814	46799	46799	I	0	' said the plump one . '
46843	47485	46838	46838	you	1397	' I accepted as if it had been an ordinary invitation at the club . The whole business had mesmerized me . We went into the smoking - room where a card - table was set out , and I was offered things to smoke and drink . I took my place at the table in a kind of dream . The window was open and the moon was flooding the cliffs and sea with a great tide of yellow light . There was moonshine , too , in my head . The three had recovered their composure , and were talking easily - just the kind of slangy talk you will hear in any golf club - house . I must have cut a rum figure , sitting there knitting my brows with my eyes wandering . My partner was the young dark one . I play a fair hand at bridge , but I must have been rank bad that night . They saw that they had got me puzzled , and that put them more than ever at their ease . I kept looking at their faces , but they conveyed nothing to me . It was not that they looked different ; they were different . I clung desperately to the words of Peter Pienaar . Then something awoke me . The old man laid down his hand to light a cigar . He did n't pick it up at once , but sat back for a moment in his chair , with his fingers tapping on his knees . It was the movement I remembered when I had stood before him in the moorland farm , with the pistols of his servants behind me . A little thing , lasting only a second , and the odds were a thousand to one that I might have had my eyes on my cards at the time and missed it . But I did n't , and , in a flash , the air seemed to clear . Some shadow lifted from my brain , and I was looking at the three men with full and absolute recognition . The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten o'clock . The three faces seemed to change before my eyes and reveal their secrets . The young one was the murderer . Now I saw cruelty and ruthlessness , where before I had only seen good - humour . His knife , I made certain , had skewered Scudder to the floor . His kind had put the bullet in Karolides . The plump man 's features seemed to dislimn , and form again , as I looked at them . He had n't a face , only a hundred masks that he could assume when he pleased . That chap must have been a superb actor . Perhaps he had been Lord Alloa of the night before ; perhaps not ; it did n't matter . I wondered if he was the fellow who had first tracked Scudder , and left his card on him . Scudder had said he lisped , and I could imagine how the adoption of a lisp might add terror . But the old man was the pick of the lot . He was sheer brain , icy , cool , calculating , as ruthless as a steam hammer . Now that my eyes were opened I wondered where I had seen the benevolence . His jaw was like chilled steel , and his eyes had the inhuman luminosity of a bird 's . I went on playing , and every second a greater hate welled up in my heart . It almost choked me , and I could n't answer when my partner spoke . Only a little longer could I endure their company . '
47495	47501	47502	47502	You	228	' said the old man . '
47520	47552	47511	47511	Bob	228	' he added , turning to me . The voice rang now as false as hell . I looked at the clock , and it was nearly half - past ten . '
47563	47567	47556	47556	he	228	' I said . '
47572	47578	47556	47556	he	228	' said the young man . '
47609	47610	47601	47601	I	0	' '
47613	47617	47618	47618	you	228	' I said , '
47622	47664	47665	47665	I	0	' At that I think they must have realized that the game was desperate . Their only chance had been to convince me that I was playing the fool , and that had failed . But the old man spoke again . '
47682	47768	47769	47769	Schnell	236	' Was it fancy , or did I detect some halt in the smoothness of that voice ? There must have been , for as I glanced at him , his eyelids fell in that hawk - like hood which fear had stamped on my memory . I blew my whistle . In an instant the lights were out . A pair of strong arms gripped me round the waist , covering the pockets in which a man might be expected to carry a pistol . '
47773	47778	47769	47769	Schnell	236	' cried a voice , '
47785	48004	47782	47783	das Boot	1409	' As it spoke I saw two of my fellows emerge on the moonlit lawn . The young dark man leapt for the window , was through it , and over the low fence before a hand could touch him . I grappled the old chap , and the room seemed to fill with figures . I saw the plump one collared , but my eyes were all for the out - of - doors , where Franz sped on over the road towards the railed entrance to the beach stairs . One man followed him , but he had no chance . The gate of the stairs locked behind the fugitive , and I stood staring , with my hands on the old boy 's throat , for such a time as a man might take to descend those steps to the sea . Suddenly my prisoner broke from me and flung himself on the wall . There was a click as if a lever had been pulled . Then came a low rumbling far , far below the ground , and through the window I saw a cloud of chalky dust pouring out of the shaft of the stairway . Someone switched on the light . The old man was looking at me with blazing eyes . '
48009	48013	48014	48014	You	1411	' he cried . '
48037	48126	48029	48031	Der Schwarze Stein	239	' There was more in those eyes than any common triumph . They had been hooded like a bird of prey , and now they flamed with a hawk 's pride . A white fanatic heat burned in them , and I realized for the first time the terrible thing I had been up against . This man was more than a spy ; in his foul way he had been a patriot . As the handcuffs clinked on his wrists I said my last word to him . '
