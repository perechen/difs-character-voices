4115	4120	4121	4121	I	0	" It is strange , "
4137	4205	4121	4121	I	0	" it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas ; many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend , Mr. Heathcliff ; yet , I 'll venture to say , that , surrounded by your family , and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart — "
4206	4211	4212	4212	he	281	" My amiable lady ! "
4224	4233	4221	4221	his	281	" Where is she — my amiable lady ? "
4234	4244	4221	4221	his	281	" Mrs. Heathcliff , your wife , I mean . "
4245	4285	4221	4221	his	281	" Well , yes — Oh ! you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel , and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights , even when her body is gone . Is that it ? "

Here is the consequence of being buried alive : she has thrown herself away upon that boor , from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed ! A sad pity — I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice . "
4488	4499	4501	4501	Heathcliff	43	" Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter - in - law , "
4552	4571	4572	4572	I	0	" Ah , certainly — I see now ; you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy , "

4958	4989	4991	4991	Heathcliff	43	" Hareton , drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch . They 'll be covered if left in the fold all night ; and put a plank before them , "
4993	4999	5000	5000	I	0	" How must I do ? "
5098	5157	5075	5075	he	304	" Aw woonder hagh yah can faishion tuh stand thear i ' idleness un war , when all on 'em 's goan aght ! Bud yah're a nowt , and it 's noa use talking — yah'll niver mend uh yer ill ways ; bud , goa raight tuh t ' divil , like yer mother afore ye ! "
5207	5213	5214	5214	she	48	" You scandalous old hypocrite ! "
5217	5263	5264	5264	she	48	" Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily , whenever you mention the devil 's name ? I warn you to refrain from provoking me , or I 'll ask your abduction as a special favour . Stop , look here , Joseph , "
5277	5325	5264	5264	she	48	" I 'll show you how far I 've progressed in the Black Art — I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it . The red cow did n't die by chance ; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations ! "
5326	5333	5335	5336	the elder	307	" Oh , wicked , wicked ! "
5338	5347	5264	5264	she	48	" may the Lord deliver us from evil ! "
5348	5416	5417	5419	The little witch	308	" No , reprobate ! you are a castaway — be off , or I 'll hurt you seriously ! I 'll have you all modlled in wax and clay ; and the first who passes the limits , I fix , shall — I'll not say what he shall be done to — but , you 'll see ! Go , I 'm looking at you ! "

5490	5553	5485	5485	I	0	" you must excuse me for troubling you — I presume , because , with that face , I 'm sure you can not help being good - hearted . Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home — I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to London ! "
5554	5561	5562	5562	she	308	" Take the road you came , "
5583	5598	5562	5562	she	308	" It is brief advice ; but , as sound as I can give . "
5599	5633	5485	5485	I	0	" Then , if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog , or a pit full of snow , your conscience wo nt whisper that it is partly your fault ? "
5634	5659	5485	5485	I	0	" How so ? I can not escort you . They would n't let me go to the end of the garden - wall . "
5660	5684	5685	5685	I	0	" You ! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold , for my convenience , on such a night , "
5688	5715	5685	5685	I	0	" I want you to tell me my way , not to show it ; or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide . "
5716	5736	5485	5485	I	0	" Who ? There is himself , Earnshaw , Zillah , Joseph , and I. Which would you have ? "
5737	5746	5485	5485	I	0	" Are there no boys at the farm ? "
5747	5754	5685	5685	I	0	" No , those are all . "
5755	5767	5485	5485	I	0	" Then , it follows that I am compelled to stay . "
5768	5785	5485	5485	I	0	" That you may settle with your host . I have nothing to do with it . "
5786	5807	5809	5809	Heathcliff	43	" I hope it will be a lesson to you , to make no more rash journeys on these hills , "
5818	5847	5809	5809	Heathcliff	43	" As to staying here , I do n't keep accommodations for visiters ; you must share a bed with Hareton , or Joseph , if you do . "
5848	5859	5860	5860	I	0	" I can sleep on a chair in this room , "
5863	5900	5902	5904	the unmannerly wretch	310	" No , no ! A stranger is a stranger , be he rich or poor — it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard ! "
5983	5995	5996	5996	he	259	" I 'll go with him as far as the park , "
5999	6008	6016	6016	he	216	" You 'll go with him to hell ! "
6019	6031	6016	6016	he	216	" And who is to look after the horses , eh ? "
6032	6054	6056	6057	Mrs. Heathcliff	48	" A man 's life is of more consequence than one evening 's neglect of the horses ; somebody must go , "
6065	6071	6073	6073	Hareton	47	" Not at your command ! "
6075	6089	6073	6073	Hareton	47	" If you set store on him , you 'd better be quiet . "
6090	6118	6119	6119	she	48	" Then I hope his ghost will haunt you ; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get another tenant , till the Grange is a ruin ! "
6123	6134	6136	6136	Joseph	45	" Hearken , hearken , shoo 's cursing on em ! "
6184	6196	6198	6199	the ancient	316	" Maister , maister , he 's staling t ' lantern ! "
6205	6224	6198	6199	the ancient	316	" Hey , Gnasher ! Hey , dog ! Hey , wolf , holld him , holld him ! "
6472	6478	6479	6479	she	49	" Well , Mr. Earnshaw , "
6482	6553	6479	6479	she	49	" I wonder what you 'll have agait next ! Are we going to murder folk on our very door - stones ? I see this house will never do for me — look at t ' poor lad , he 's fair choking ! Wisht , wisht ! you mun'n't go on so — come in , and I 'll cure that . There now , hold ye still . "
6965	7111	7112	7112	Earnshaw	54	" In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window , and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw — Heathcliff — Linton , till my eyes closed ; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark , as vivid as spectres — the air swarmed with Catherines ; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name , I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes , and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf - skin . I snuffed it off , and , very ill at ease , under the influence of cold and lingering nausea , sat up , and spread open the injured tome on my knee . It was a Testament , in lean type , and smelling dreadfully musty : a fly - leaf bore the inscription—"Catherine
7117	7285	7112	7112	Earnshaw	54	" and a date some quarter of a century back . I shut it , and took up another , and another , till I had examined all . Catherine 's library was select ; and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used , though not altogether for a legitimate purpose ; scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen and ink commentary , at least , the appearance of one , covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left . Some were detached sentences ; other parts took the form of a regular diary , scrawled in an unformed , childish hand . At the top of an extra page , quite a treasure probably when first lighted on , I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph , rudely yet powerfully sketched . An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine , and I began , forthwith , to decypher her faded hieroglyphics . "
7290	7296	7297	7297	I	0	" commenced the paragraph beneath . "
7334	7479	7328	7328	our	339	" All day had been flooding with rain ; we could not go to church , so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret ; and , while Hindley and his wife basked down stairs before a comfortable fire , doing anything but reading their bibles , I 'll answer for it ; Heathcliff , myself , and the unhappy plough - boy , were commanded to take our Prayer - books , and mount — we were ranged in a row , on a sack of corn , groaning and shivering , and hoping that Joseph would shiver too , so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake . A vain idea ! The service lasted precisely three hours ; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim , when he saw us descending , "
7486	7487	7328	7328	our	339	" "
7519	7529	7531	7532	the tyrant	341	" ' You forget you have a master here , "
7582	7627	7577	7577	him	0	" Frances pulled his hair heartily ; and then went and seated herself on her husband 's knee , and there they were , like two babies , kissing and talking nonsense by the hour — foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of . "
7685	7749	7672	7672	He	45	" ' T ' maister nobbut just buried , and Sabbath nut oe'red , und t ' sabnd , uh't gospel still i ' yer lugs , and yah darr be laiking ! shame on ye ! sit ye dahn , ill chllder ! they 's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em ; sit ye dahn , and think uh yer sowls ! "
7789	7822	7823	7823	Heathcliff	43	" I could not bear the employment . I took my dingy volume by the scroop , and hurled it into the dog - kennel , vowing I hated a good book . "
7831	7838	7823	7823	Heathcliff	43	" Then there was a hubbub ! "
7923	7963	7965	7965	Nick	62	" Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth , and seizing one of us by the collar , and the other by the arm , hurled both into the back - kitchen ; where , Joseph asseverated , "
7966	7993	7994	7994	I	0	" would fetch us as sure as we were living ; and , so comforted , we each sought a separate nook to await his advent . "
8101	8122	8129	8129	Hindley	58	" I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project , for the next sentence took up another subject ; she waxed lachrymose . "
8137	8141	8129	8129	Hindley	58	" she wrote . "
8217	8247	8248	8248	I	0	" He has been blaming our father ( how dared he ? ) for treating H. too liberally ; and swears he will reduce him to his right place — "
8275	8305	8266	8266	I	0	" Seventy Times Seven , and the First of the Seventy First . A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabes Branderham , in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough . "
8533	8537	8540	8540	Joseph	45	text—"Seventy Times Seven ; "
8550	8557	8540	8540	Joseph	45	" First of the Seventy First , "
8851	8865	8840	8840	Joseph	45	" I was condemned to hear all out — finally , he reached the "
8873	8905	8840	8840	Joseph	45	"At that crisis , a sudden inspiration descended on me ; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabes Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon . "
8908	8912	8840	8840	Joseph	45	" I exclaimed , "
9011	9012	9013	9013	Thou	381	" "
9018	9032	9015	9016	the Man	382	" cried Jabes , after a solemn pause , leaning over his cushion . "
9094	9408	9409	9409	I	0	" With that concluding word , the whole assembly , exalting their pilgrim 's staves , rushed round me in a body , and I , having no weapon to raise in self - defence , commenced grappling with Joseph , my nearest and most ferocious assailant , for his . In the confluence of the multitude , several clubs crossed ; blows , aimed at me , fell on other sconses . Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter - rappings . Every man 's hand was against his neighbour ; and Branderham , unwilling to remain idle , poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly , that , at last , to my unspeakable relief , they woke me . And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult , what bad played Jabes ' part in the row ? Merely , the branch of a fir - tree that touched my lattice , as the blast wailed by , and rattled its dry cones against the panes ! I listened doubtingly an instant ; detected the disturber , then turned and dosed , and dreamt again ; if possible , still more disagreebly than before . This time , I remembered I was lying in the oak closet , and I heard distinctly the gusty wind , and the driving of the snow ; I heard also , the firbough repeat its teasing sound , and ascribed it to the right cause : but , it annoyed me so much , that I resolved to silence it , if possible ; and , I thought , I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement . The hook was soldered into the staple , a circumstance observed by me , when awake , but forgotten . "
9416	9490	9409	9409	I	0	" I muttered , knocking my knuckles through the glass , and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch : instead of which , my fingers closed on the fingers of a little , ice - cold hand ! The intense horror of nightmare came over me ; I tried to draw back my arm , but , the hand clung to it , and a most melancholy voice , sobbed , "
9499	9500	9409	9409	I	0	" "
9505	9516	9503	9503	you	387	" I asked struggling , meanwhile , to disengage myself . "
9520	9544	9503	9503	you	387	" it replied , shiveringly , ( why did I think of Linton ? I had read Earnshaw , twenty times for Linton ) "
9559	9627	9503	9503	you	387	" As it spoke , I discerned , obscurely , a child 's face looking through the window — Terror made me cruel ; and , finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off , I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane , and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bed - clothes : still it wailed , "
9632	9645	9503	9503	you	387	" and maintained its tenacious gripe , almost maddening me with fear . "
9650	9656	9503	9503	you	387	" I said at length . "
9670	9733	9734	9734	Begone	68	" The fingers relaxed , I snatched mine through the hole , hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it , and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer . I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour , yet , the instant I listened , again , there was the doleful cry moaning on ! "
9736	9740	9734	9734	Begone	68	" I shouted , "
9756	9757	9758	9758	It	391	" "
9763	9768	9758	9758	It	391	" mourned the voice , "
9781	9910	9775	9776	a waif	392	" Thereat began a feeble scratching outside , and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward . I tried to jump up ; but , could not stir a limb ; and so , yelled aloud , in a frenzy of fright . To my confusion , I discovered the yell was not ideal . Hasty footsteps approached my chamber door : somebody pushed it open , with a vigorous hand , and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed . I sat shuddering , yet , and wiping the perspiration from my forehead : the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself . At last , he said in a half - whisper , plainly not expecting an answer , "
9916	10039	9912	9913	any one	2573	" I considered it best to confess my presence , for I knew Heathcliff 's accents , and feared he might search further , if I kept quiet . With this intention , I turned and opened the panels — I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced . Heathcliff stood near the entrance , in his shirt and trousers ; with a candle dripping over his fingers , and his face as white as the wall behind him . The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock : the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet , and his agitation was so extreme , that he could hardly pick it up . "
10048	10065	10046	10046	slr	397	" I called out , desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further . "
10089	10090	10082	10082	I	0	" "
10107	10128	10102	10102	you	395	" commenced my host setting the candle on a chair , because he found it impossible to hold it steady . "
10138	10159	10102	10102	you	395	" he continued , crushing his nails into his palms , and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions . "
10180	10181	10164	10164	I	0	" "
10189	10206	10187	10187	Zillah	49	" I replied flinging myself , on to the floor , and rapidly resuming my garments . "
10278	10279	10282	10282	you	0	" "
10285	10289	10282	10282	you	0	" asked Heathcliff , "
10336	10337	10349	10349	she	2592	" "
10356	10360	10349	10349	she	2592	" I returned . "
10444	10498	10418	10418	She	2592	" Scarcely were these words uttered , when I recollected the association of Heathcliff 's with Catherine 's name in the book , which had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened . I blushed at my inconsideration ; but without showing further consciousness of the offence , I hastened to add , "
10515	10527	10505	10505	I	0	" Here , I stopped afresh — I was about to say "
10533	10560	10505	10505	I	0	" then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written , as well as their printed contents ; so correcting myself , I went on , "
10588	10589	10592	10592	you	0	" "
10603	10610	10592	10592	you	0	" thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence . "
10630	10678	10679	10680	Catherine Linton	56	" And he struck his forehead with rage . I did not know whether to resent this language , or pursue my explanation ; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams ; affirming I had never heard the appellation of "
10682	10786	10679	10680	Catherine Linton	56	" before , but , reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control . Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed , as I spoke , finally , sitting down almost concealed behind it . I guessed , however , by his irregular and intercepted breathing , that he struggled to vanquish an access of violent emotion . Not liking to show him that I heard the conflict , I continued my toilette rather noisily , looked at my watch , and soliloquised on the length of the night : "
10817	10818	10863	10864	Mr Lockwood	44	" "
10831	10862	10863	10864	Mr Lockwood	44	" said my host , suppressing a groan ; and , as I fancied , by the motion of his shadow 's arm , dashing a tear from his eyes . "
10866	10870	10863	10864	Mr Lockwood	44	" he added , "
10905	10906	10893	10893	your	44	" "
10912	10916	10893	10893	your	44	" I replied . "
10972	10973	10961	10963	A sensible man	420	" "
10977	10981	10961	10963	A sensible man	420	" muttered Heathcliff . "
11045	11125	11038	11038	I	0	" I obeyed , so far as to quit the chamber ; when , ignorant where the narrow lobbies led , I stood still , and was witness , involuntarily , to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord , which belied , oddly , his apparent sense . He got on to the bed , and wrenched open the lattice , bursting , as he pulled at it , into an uncontrollable passion of tears . "
11132	11136	11137	11137	Cathy	56	" he sobbed . "
11165	11519	11160	11160	Catherine	56	" The spectre showed a spectre 's ordinary caprice ; it gave no sign of being ; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through , even reaching my station , and blowing out the light . There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving , that my compassion made me overlook its folly , and I drew off , half angry to have listened at all , and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare , since it produced that agony ; though why , was beyond my comprehension . I descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back - kitchen , where a gleam of fire , raked compactly together , enabled me to rekindle my candle . Nothing was stirring except a brindled , grey cat , which crept from the ashes , and saluted me with a querulous mew . Two benches , shaped in sections of a circle , nearly enclosed the hearth ; on one of these I stretched myself , and Grimalkin mounted the other . We were both of us nodding , ere any one invaded our retreat ; and then it was Joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof , through a trap , the assent to his garret , I suppose . He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs , swept the cat from its elevation , and bestowing himself In the vacancy , commenced the operation of stuffing a three - inch pipe with tobacco ; my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark . He silently applied the tube to his lips , folded his arms , and puffed away . I let him enjoy the luxury , unannoyed ; and after sucking out the last wreath , and heaving a profound sigh , he got up , and departed as solemnly as he came . A more elastic footstep entered next , and now I opened my mouth for a "
11523	11817	11160	11160	Catherine	56	" but closed it again , the salutation unachieved ; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orisons , sotto voce , in a series of curses directed against every object he touched , while he rummaged a corner , for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts . He glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils , and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me , as with my companion , the cat . I guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed , and leaving my hard couch , made a movement to follow him . He noticed this , and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade , intimating by an inarticulate sound , that there was the place where I must go , if I changed my locality . It opened into the house , where the females were already astir . Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows ; and Mrs. Heathcliff , kneeling on the hearth , reading a book by the aid of the blaze . She held her hand interposed between the furnace - heat and her eyes ; and seemed absorbed in her occupation : desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks , or to push away a dog , now and then , that snoozled its nose over forwardly into her face . I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also . He stood by the fire , his back towards me , just finishing a stormy scene to poor Zillah , who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron , and heave an indignant groan . "
11824	11860	11819	11819	you	423	" he broke out as I entered , turning to his daughter - in - law , and employing an epithet as harmless as duck , or sheep , but generally represented by a dash . "
11918	11919	11912	11912	you	423	" "
11937	11954	11928	11928	you	423	" answered the young lady , closing her book , and throwing it on a chair . "
11975	12760	11972	11972	I	0	" Heathcliff lifted his hand , and the speaker sprang to a safer distance , obviously acquainted with its weight . Having no desire to be entertained by a cat and dog combat , I stepped forward briskly , as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth , and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute . Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities ; Heathcliff placed his fists , out of temptation , in his pockets : Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip , and walked to a seat far off ; where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay . That was not long . I declined joining their breakfast , and , at the first gleam of dawn , took an opportunity of escaping into the free air , now clear , and still , and cold as impalpable ice . My landlord hallooed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden , and offered to accompany me across the moor . It was well he did , for the whole hill - back was one billowy , white ocean ; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground — many pits , at least , were filled to a level ; and entire ranges of mounds , the refuse of the quarries , blotted from the chart which my yesterday 's walk left pictured in my mind . I had remarked on one side of the road , at intervals of six or seven yards , a line of upright stones , continued through the whole length of the barren : these were erected , and daubed with lime , on purpose to serve as guides in the dark , and also , when a fall , like the present , confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path : but , excepting a dirty dot pointing up , here and there , all traces of their existence had vanished ; and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right , or left , when I imagined I was following , correctly , the windings of the road . We exchanged little conversation , and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross park , saying , I could make no error there . Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow , and then I pushed forward , trusting to my own resources , for the porter 's lodge is untenanted as yet . The distance from the gate to the Grange is to miles : I believe I managed to make it four ; what with losing myself among the trees , and sinking up to the neck in snow , a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate . At any rate , whatever were my wanderings , the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house ; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights . My human fixture , and her satellites rushed to welcome me ; exclaiming , tumultuously , they had completely given me up ; everybody conjectured that I perished last night ; and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains . I bid them be quiet , now that they saw me returned , and , benumbed to my very heart , I dragged up - stairs , whence , after putting on dry clothes , and pacing to and fro , thirty or forty minutes , to restore the animal heat , I am adjourned to my study , feeble as a kitten , almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire , and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment . What vain weather - cocks we are ! I , who had determined to held myself independent of all social intercourse , and thanked my stars that , at length , I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable . I , weak wretch , after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits , and solitude , was finally compelled to strike my colours ; and , under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment , I desired Mrs. Dean , when she brought in supper , to sit down while I ate it , hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip , and either rouse me to animation , or lull me to sleep by her talk . "
12769	12773	12775	12775	you	426	" I commenced ; "
12781	12782	12775	12775	you	426	" "
12815	12816	12805	12806	the master	430	" "
12819	12875	12805	12806	the master	430	" There ensued a pause . She was not a gossip , I feared , unless about her own affairs , and those could hardly interest me . However , having studied for an interval , with a fist on either knee , and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance , she ejaculated — "
12885	12886	12805	12806	the master	430	" "
12889	12893	12805	12806	the master	430	" I remarked , "
12905	12906	12907	12907	I	0	" "
12914	12918	12907	12907	I	0	" she said . "
12932	12938	12939	12941	A good subject	434	" I thought to myself . "
12988	13014	13016	13016	he	168	" With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliif let Thrushcross Grange , and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior . "
13028	13032	13033	13034	Rich sir	441	" I enquired . "
13036	13040	13041	13041	He	168	" she returned . "
13137	13138	13139	13139	He	168	" "
13147	13148	13151	13151	he	168	" "
13159	13160	13155	13155	he	168	" "
13173	13174	13162	13164	that young lady	448	" "
13177	13178	13162	13164	that young lady	448	" "
13186	13187	13181	13181	she	448	" "
13232	13233	13217	13218	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" "
13239	13259	13236	13237	Catherine Linton	56	" I exclaimed , astonished . But a minute 's reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine . "
13262	13266	13236	13237	Catherine Linton	56	" I continued , "
13274	13275	13272	13272	Linton	56	" "
13279	13280	13272	13272	Linton	56	" "

13313	13314	13308	13309	Mrs. Linton	48	" "
13322	13323	13315	13317	The young lady	276	" "
13356	13357	13358	13358	I	0	" "
13381	13382	13386	13386	sir	2571	" "
13434	13435	13436	13437	Mrs. Heathcliff	48	" "
13457	13458	13439	13439	she	56	" "
13467	13476	13439	13439	she	56	" And how did you like the master ? "
13477	13493	13450	13450	I	0	" A rough fellow , rather , Mrs. Dean . Is not that his character ? "
13494	13516	13439	13439	she	56	" Rough as a saw - edge , and hard as whinstone ! The less you meddle with him the better . "
13517	13543	13439	13439	she	56	" He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl . Do you know anything of his history ? "
13544	13615	13450	13450	I	0	" It 's a cuckoo 's ; sir — I know all about it ; except where he was born , and who were his parents , and how he got his money , at first — And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock — The unfortunate lad is the only one , in all this parish , that does not guess how he has been cheated ! "
13616	13662	13439	13439	she	56	" Well , Mrs. Dean , it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours — I feel I shall not rest , if I go to bed ; so , be good enough to sit , and chat an hour . "
13663	13710	13711	13713	The worthy woman	471	" Oh , certainly , sir ! I 'll just fetch a little sewing , and then I 'll sit as long as you please but you 've caught cold , I saw you shivering , and you must have some gruel to drive it out . "
13820	13828	13829	13829	she	471	" Before I came to live here , "
13840	13901	13829	13829	she	471	" I was almost always at Wuthering Heights ; because , my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw , that was Hareton 's father , and I got used to playing with the children — I ran errands too , and helped to make hay , and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to . "
13979	14034	13971	13971	he	47	" Now my bonny man , I 'm going to Liverpool , to - day . . .What shall I bring you ? You may choose what you like ; only let it be little , for I shall walk there and back ; sixty miles each way , that is a long spell ! "
14278	14292	14293	14293	he	47	" And at the end of it , to be flighted to death ! "
14309	14352	14293	14293	he	47	" See here , wife ; I was never so beaten with anything in my life ; but you must e'en take it as a gift of God ; though it 's as dark almost as if it came from the devil . "
14891	14894	14887	14887	they	335	" Heathcliff , "
15517	15565	15512	15512	he	43	" You must exchange horses with me ; I do n't like mine , and , if you wo n't I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you 've given me this week , and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder . "
15579	15589	15590	15590	he	75	" You 'd better do it , at once , "
15604	15628	15590	15590	he	75	" you will have to , and , if I speak , of these blows , you 'll get them again with interest . "
15629	15633	15635	15635	Hindley	75	" Off dog ! "
15652	15656	15657	15657	he	75	" Throw it , "
15663	15697	15698	15698	Hindley	75	" and then I 'll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died , and see whether he will not turn you out directly . "
15755	15756	15775	15775	he	43	" "
15765	15770	15761	15761	gipsy	539	" said young Earnshaw , "
15829	16273	16274	16274	Hindley	75	" Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast , and shift it to his own stall — He was passing behind it , when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet , and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled , ran away as fast as he could . I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up , and went on with his intention , exchanging saddles and all ; and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned , before he entered the house . I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse ; he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted . He complained so seldom , indeed , of such stirs as these , that I really thought him not vindictive — I was deceived , completely , as you will hear . In the course of time , Mr. Earnshaw began to fail . He had been active and healthy , yet his strength left him suddenly ; and when he was confined to the chimney - corner he grew grievously irritable . A nothing vexed him , and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits . This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon , or domineer over his favourite ; he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him , seeming to have got into his head the notion that , because he liked Heathcliff , all hated , and longed to do him an ill - turn . It was a disadvantage to the lad , for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master , so we humoured his partiality ; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child 's pride and black tempers . Still it became in a manner necessary ; twice , or thrice , Hindley 's manifestations of scorn , while his father was near , roused the old man to a fury . He seized his stick to strike him , and shook with rage that he could not do it . At last , our curate , ( we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws , and farming his bit of land himself , ) he advised that the young man should be sent to college , and Mr , Earnshaw agreed , though with a heavy spirit , for he said — "
16287	16953	16274	16274	Hindley	75	" I hoped heartily we should have peace now . It hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed . I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements , as he would have it that it did — really , you know , sir , it was in his sinking frame . We might have got on tolerably , notwithstanding ; but , for two people . Miss Cathy , and Joseph , the servant ; you saw him , I dare say , up yonder . He was , and is yet , most likely , the wearisomest , self - righteous pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself , and fling the curses on his neighbours . By his knack of sermonizing and pious discoursing , he contrived to make a great impression on Mr. Earnshaw , and , the more feeble the master became , the more influence he gained . He was relentless in worrying him about his soul 's concerns , and about ruling his children rigidly . He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate ; and , night after night , he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine ; always minding to flatter Earnshaw 's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the last . Certainly , she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before ; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day : from the hour she came down stairs , till the hour she went to bed , we had not a minute 's security that she would n't be in mischief . Her spirits were always at high - water mark , her tongue always going — singing , laughing , and plaguing everybody who would not do the same . A wild , wick slip she was — but , she had the bonniest eye , and sweetest smile , and lightest foot in the parish ; and , after all , I believe she meant no harm ; for when once she made you cry in good earnest , it seldom happened that she would not keep you company ; and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her . She was much too fond of Heathcliff . The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him : yet , she got chided more than any of us on his account . In play , she liked , exceedingly , to act the little mistress ; using her hands freely , and commanding her companions : she did so to me , but I would not bear slapping , and ordering ; and so I let her know . Now , Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children : he had always been strict and grave with them ; and Catherine , on her part , had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition , than he was in his prime . His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him ; she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once , and she defying us with her bold , saucy look , and her ready words ; turning Joseph 's religious curses into ridicule , baiting me , and doing just what her father hated most , showing how her pretended insolence , which he thought real , had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness . How the boy would do her bidding in anything , and his only when it suited his own inclination . After behaving as badly as possible all day , she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night . "
16958	16965	16956	16956	Cathy	56	" the old man would say , "
17006	17216	16997	16997	I	0	" That made her cry , at first ; and then , being repulsed continually hardened her , and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her faults , and beg to be forgiven . But the hour came , at last , that ended Mr. Earnshaw 's troubles on earth . He died quietly in his chair one October evening , seated by the fire - side . A high wind blustered round the house , and roared in the chimney : it sounded wild and stormy , yet it was not cold , and we were all together — I , a little removed from the hearth , busy at my knitting , and Joseph reading his Bible near the table , ( for the servants generally sat in the house then , after their work was done . ) Miss Cathy had been sick , and that made her still ; she leant against her father 's knee , and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap . I remember the master , before he fell into a doze , stroking her bonny hair — it pleased him rarely to see her gentle — and saying — "
17229	17245	17227	17227	Cathy	56	" And she turned her face up to his , and laughed , and answered , "
17258	17420	17252	17254	a good man	551	" But as soon as she saw him vexed again , she kissed his hand , and said she would sing him to sleep . She began singing very low , till his fingers dropped from hers , and his head sank on his breast . Then I told her to hush , and not stir , for fear she should wake him . We all kept as mute as mice a full half - hour , and should have done longer , only Joseph , having finished his chapter , got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed . He stepped forward , and called him by name , and touched his shoulder , but he would not move — so he took the candle and looked at him . I thought there was something wrong as he set down the light ; and seizing the children each by an arm , whispered them to "
17444	17445	17438	17438	he	555	" "
17455	17484	17446	17446	I	0	" said Catherine , putting her arms round his neck , before we could hinder her . The poor thing discovered her loss directly — she screamed out — "
17497	17884	17491	17491	Heathcliff	43	" And they both set up a heart - breaking cry . I joined my wail to theirs , loud and bitter ; but Joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in Heaven . He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson . I could not guess the use that either would be of , then . However , I went , through wind and rain , and brought one , the doctor , back with me ; the other said he would come in the morning . Leaving Joseph to explain matters , I ran to the children 's room ; their door was ajar , I saw they had never laid down , though it was past midnight ; but they were calmer , and did not need me to console them . The little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on ; no parson in the world ever pictured Heaven so beautifully as they did , in their innocent talk ; and , while I sobbed , and listened , I could not help wishing we were all there safe together . Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral ; and — a thing that amazed us , and set the neighbours gossipping right and left — he brought a wife with him . What she was , and where she was born he never informed us ; probably , she had neither money nor name to recommend her , or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father . She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account . Every object she saw , the moment she crossed the threshold , appeared to delight her ; and every circumstance that took place about her , except the preparing for the burial , and the presence of the mourners . I thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on ; she ran into her chamber , and made me come with her , though I should have been dressing the children ; and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands , and asking repeatedly — "
17890	18756	17491	17491	Heathcliff	43	" Then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black ; and started , and trembled , and , at last , fell a weeping — and when I asked what was the matter ? answered , she did n't know ; but she felt so afraid of dying ! I imagined her as little likely to die as myself . She was rather thin , but young , and fresh complexioned , and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds . I did remark , to be sure , that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick , that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver , and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes : but , I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended , and had no impulse to sympathize with her . We do n't in general take to foreigners here , Mr. Lockwood , unless they take to us first . Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence . He had grown sparer , and lost his colour , and spoke and dressed quite differently : and , on the very day of his return , he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back - kitchen , and leave the house for him . Indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour ; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor , and huge glowing fire - place , at the pewter dishes , and delf - case , and dog - kennel , and the wide space there was to move about in , where they usually sat , that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort , and so dropped the intention . She expressed pleasure , too , at finding a sister among her new acquaintance , and she prattled to Catherine , and kissed her , and ran about with her , and gave her quantities of presents , at the beginning . Her affection tired very soon , however , and when she grew peevish , Hindley became tyrannical . A few words from her , evincing a dislike to Heathcliff , were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy . He drove him from their company to the servants , deprived him of the instructions of the curate , and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead , compelling him to do so , as hard as any other lad on the farm . He bore his degradation pretty well at first , because Cathy taught him what she learnt , and worked or played with him in the fields . They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages , the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved , and what they did , so they kept clear of him . He would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays , only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves , and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging , and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper . But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day , and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at . The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart , and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached ; they forgot everything the minute they were together again , at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge , and many a time I 've cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily , and I not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures . One Sunday evening , it chanced that they were banished from the sitting - room , for making a noise , or a light offence of the kind , and when I went to call them to supper , I could discover them nowhere . We searched the house , above and below , and the yard , and stables , they were invisible ; and , at last , Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors , and swore nobody should let them in that night . The household went to bed ; and I , too anxious to lie down , opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken , though it rained , determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition , should they return . In a while , I distinguished steps coming up the road , and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate . I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking . There was Heathcliff , by himself ; it gave me a start to see him alone . "
18762	18767	18759	18760	Miss Catherine	56	" I cried hurriedly . "
18774	18775	18759	18760	Miss Catherine	56	" "
18780	18784	18759	18760	Miss Catherine	56	" he answered , "
18805	18806	18794	18794	they	559	" "
18814	18818	18809	18809	you	0	" I said , "
18843	18844	18862	18862	Nelly	80	" "
18864	18894	18862	18862	Nelly	80	" he replied . I bid him beware of rousing the master , and while he undressed , and I waited to put out the candle , he continued — "
18996	18997	18963	18963	you	0	" "
19001	19005	18963	18963	you	0	" I responded . "
19028	19029	19032	19032	you	0	" "
19038	19041	19032	19032	you	0	" he said "
19472	19473	19484	19484	you	0	" "
19478	19482	19484	19484	you	0	" I interrupted . "
19498	19499	19500	19500	I	0	" "
19506	19627	19503	19503	we	562	" he answered . The Linton 's heard us , and with one accord , they shot like arrows to the door ; there was silence , and then a cry , ' Oh , mamma , mamma ! Oh , papa ! Oh , mamma , come here . Oh papa , oh ! ' They really did howl out , something in that way . We made frightful noises to terrify them still more , and then we dropped off the ledge , because somebody was drawing the bars , and we felt we had better flee . I had Cathy by the hand , and was urging her on , when all at once she fell down . "
19634	19638	19630	19630	Heathcliff	43	" she whispered . "
19653	19654	19655	19656	The devil	2631	" "
19756	19765	19740	19744	A beast of a servant	591	" Keep fast , Skulker , keep fast ! "
19766	19810	19811	19812	The man	382	" He changed his note , however , when he saw Skulker 's game . The dog was throttled off , his huge , purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth , and his pendant lips streaming with bloody slaver . "
19845	19846	19833	19833	He	382	" "
19852	19859	19850	19850	Robert	84	" hallooed Linton from the entrance . "
19860	19870	19871	19871	he	382	" Skulker has caught a little girl , sir , "
19881	19891	19877	19878	a lad	593	" ha added , making a clutch at me , "
19969	19970	19975	19975	Robert	84	" "
19977	19983	19975	19975	Robert	84	" said the old fool . "
20108	20142	20154	20154	He	603	" He pulled me under the chandelier , and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror . The cowardly children crept nearer also , Isabella lisping — "
20178	20179	20176	20176	Edgar	81	" "
20229	20230	20213	20213	They	609	" "
20236	20243	20213	20213	They	609	" he whispered to his mother , "
20257	20258	20259	20260	Miss Earnshaw	88	" "
20264	20269	20270	20271	Miss Earnshaw	88	" cried the dame , "
20303	20304	20296	20296	she	2762	" "
20312	20323	20324	20324	I	0	" exclaimed Mr. Linton , turning from me to Catherine . "
20389	20390	20391	20393	A wicked boy	622	" "
20399	20405	20391	20393	A wicked boy	622	" remarked the old lady , "
20433	20434	20435	20435	I	0	" "
20500	20546	20547	20547	She	56	" The curtains were still looped up at one corner ; and I resumed my station as spy , because , if Catherine had wished to return , I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million fragments , unless they let her out . "
20755	20756	20753	20753	Nelly	80	" "
20769	20780	20753	20753	Nelly	80	" I answered covering him up and extinguishing the light , "
20802	21064	20787	20788	Mr. Hindley	75	" My words came truer than I desired . The luckless adventure made Earnshaw furious — And then , Mr. Linton , to mend matters , paid us a visit himself , on the morrow ; and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family , that he was stirred to look about him , in earnest . Heathcliff received no flogging , but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal ; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister - in - law in due restraint , when she returned home employing art , not force — with force she would have found it impossible . Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks , till Christmas . By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured , and her manners much improved . The mistress visited her often , in the interval , and commenced her plan of reform , by trying to raise her self - respect with fine clothes , and flattery , which she took readily : so that , instead of a wild , hatless little savage jumping into the house , and rushing to squeeze us all breathless , there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver , and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in . Hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly , "
21103	21104	21100	21100	she	82	" "
21112	21117	21105	21105	Isabella	82	" replied his wife , "
21155	21429	21150	21150	me	0	" I removed the habit , and there shone forth , beneath a grand plaid silk frock , white trousers , and burnished shoes ; and , while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her , she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments . She kissed me gently , I was all flour making the Christmas cake , and it would not have done to give me a hug ; and , then , she looked round for Heathcliff . Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting , thinking it would enable them to judge , in some measure , what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends . Heathcliff was hard to discover , at first — If he were careless , and uncared for , before Catherine 's absence , he had been ten times more so , since . Nobody , but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy , and bid him wash himself , once a week ; and children of his age , seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water . Therefore , not to mention his clothes , which had seen three month 's service , in mire and dust , and his thick uncombed hair ; the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded . He might well skulk behind the settle , on beholding such a bright , graceful damsel enter the house , instead of a rough - headed counterpart to himself , as he expected . "
21435	21457	21458	21458	Heathcliff	48	" she demanded pulling off her gloves , and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing , and staying in doors . "
21464	21488	21459	21459	you	48	" cried Mr. Hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself . "
21503	21551	21494	21495	Miss Catherine	56	" Cathy , catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment , flew to embrace him , she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second , and , then , stopped , and drawing back , burst into a laugh , exclaiming , "
21593	21620	21589	21589	you	48	" She had some reason to put the question , for shame , and pride threw double gloom over his countenance , and kept him immoveable . "
21626	21633	21624	21624	Heathcliff	48	" said Mr. Earnshaw , condescendingly ; "
21643	21644	21624	21624	Heathcliff	48	" "
21649	21659	21645	21645	I	0	" replied the boy finding his tongue at last , "
21675	21692	21693	21693	I	0	" And he would have broken from the circle , but Miss Cathy seized him again . "
21702	21706	21693	21693	I	0	" she said , "
21757	21789	21752	21752	you	48	" She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own , and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his . "
21797	21832	21835	21835	he	0	" He answered , following her eye and snatching away his hand . I shall be as dirty as I please , and I like to be dirty , and I will be dirty . "
22019	22025	22006	22007	Mrs. Linton	48	" naughty , swearing boy . "
22265	22271	22272	22272	I	0	" Make haste , Heathcliff ! "
22274	22323	22272	22272	I	0	" the kitchen is so comfortable — and Joseph is upstairs ; make haste , and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out — and then you can sit together , with the whole hearth to yourselves , and have a long chatter till bedtime . "
22337	22344	22345	22345	I	0	" Come — are you coming ? "
22348	22372	22345	22345	I	0	" There 's a little cake for each of you , nearly enough ; and you 'll need half an hour 's donning . "
22513	22584	22585	22585	Nelly	80	" In the morning , he rose early ; and , as it was a holiday , carried his ill - humour onto the moors ; not re - appearing till the family were departed for church . Fasting , and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit . He hung about me , for a while , and having screwed up his courage , exclaimed abruptly , "
22598	22599	22585	22585	Nelly	80	" "
22605	22609	22603	22603	Heathcliff	48	" I said , "
22644	22667	22669	22669	she	56	" The notion of envying Catherine was incomprehensible to him , but the notion of grieving her , be understood clearly enough . "
22675	22682	22669	22669	she	56	" he inquired looking very serious . "
22696	22697	22683	22683	She	56	" "
22704	22708	22717	22717	she	56	" he returned , "
22719	22720	22710	22710	I	0	" "
22742	22746	22723	22723	you	48	" said I , "
22895	22914	22892	22892	you	48	" Heathcliff 's face brightened a moment ; then , it was overcast afresh , and he sighed . "
22973	22974	22978	22978	mamma	2869	" "
22984	22988	22978	22978	mamma	2869	" I added , "
23175	23176	23181	23181	I	0	" "
23196	23200	23201	23201	I	0	" he replied . "
23213	23214	23241	23243	a bad one	678	" "
23228	23232	23241	23243	a bad one	678	" I continued , "
23385	23593	23595	23596	the fellow	236	" So I chattered on ; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown , and began to look quite pleasant ; when , all at once , our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court . He ran to the window , and I to the door , just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage , smothered in cloaks and furs , and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses — they often rode to church in winter . Catherine took a hand of each of the children , and brought them into the house , and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces . I urged my companion to hasten now , and show his amiable humour ; and he willingly obeyed : but ill luck would have it , that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side , Hindley opened it on the other ; they met , and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful , or , perhaps , eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust , and angrily bade Joseph "
23635	23636	23612	23612	He	236	" "
23641	23648	23612	23612	He	236	" I could not avoid answering , "
23675	23676	23677	23677	He	236	" "
23696	23700	23687	23687	I	0	" cried Hindley . "
23738	23739	23729	23729	I	0	" "
23746	23758	23729	23729	I	0	" observed Master Linton , peeping from the door - way , "
23780	23948	23772	23773	a colt	699	" He ventured this remark without any intention to insult ; but , Heathcliff 's violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate , even then , as a rival . He seized a tureen of hot apple - sauce , the first thing that came under his gripe , and dashed it full against the speaker 's face and neck — who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the place . Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber , where , doubtless , he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion , for he reappeared red and breathless . I got the dishcloth , and , rather spitefully , scrubbed Edgar 's nose and mouth , affirming , it served him right for meddling . His sister began weeping to go home , and Cathy stood by confounded , blushing for all . "
23957	23964	23949	23949	You	700	" she expostulated with Master Linton . "
24009	24010	24002	24002	you	700	" "
24015	24039	24011	24011	I	0	" sobbed the youth , escaping from my hands , and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket - handkerchief . "
24058	24059	24054	24054	I	0	" "
24066	24072	24054	24054	I	0	" replied Catherine , contemptuously . "
24102	24103	24054	24054	I	0	" "
24114	24121	24122	24126	That brute of a lad	705	" cried Hindley , bustling in . "
24235	24240	24241	24241	I	0	" An unfeeling child , "
24246	24268	24241	24241	I	0	" how lightly she dismisses her old playmate 's troubles . I could not have imagined her to be so selfish . "
24752	24757	24768	24768	them	728	" devil 's psalmody , "
24884	24926	24880	24880	he	720	" I 'm trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back . I do n't care how long I wait , if I can only do it , at last . I hope he will not die before I do ! "
24927	24933	24935	24935	I.	0	" For shame , Heathcliff ! "
24936	24952	24935	24935	I.	0	" It is for God to punish wicked people ; we should learn to forgive . "
24953	24966	24967	24967	he	720	" No , God wo nt have the satisfaction that I shall , "
24970	25004	24967	24967	he	720	" I only wish I knew the best way ! Let me alone , and I 'll plan it out : while I 'm thinking of that , I do n't feel pain . "
25005	25068	25071	25071	herself	730	" But , Mr. Lockwood , I forget these tales can not divert you . I 'm annoyed how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate ; and your gruel cold , and you nodding for bed ! I could have told Heathcliff 's history , all that you need hear , in half - a - dozen words . "
25103	25110	25111	25111	I	0	" Sit still , Mrs. Dean , "
25114	25164	25111	25111	I	0	" do sit still , another half hour ! You 've done just right to tell the story leisurely . That is the method I like ; and you must finish in the same style . I am interested in every character you have mentioned , more or less . "
25165	25177	24967	24967	he	720	" The clock is on the stroke of eleven , sir . "
25178	25208	25111	25111	I	0	" No matter — I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours . One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten . "
25209	25257	25111	25111	I	0	" You should n't lie till ten . There 's the very prime of the morning gone long before that time . A person who has not done one half his day 's work by ten o'clock , runs a chance of leaving the other half undone . "
25258	25291	24967	24967	he	720	" Nevertheless , Mrs. Dean , resume your chair ; because to - morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon . I prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold , at least . "
25292	25319	25111	25111	I	0	" I hope not , sir . Well , you must allow me to leap over some three years , during that space , Mrs. Earnshaw — "
25320	25384	25111	25111	I	0	" No , no , I 'll allow nothing of the sort ! Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which , if you were seated alone , and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you , you would watch the operation so intently that puss 's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper ? "
25385	25395	24967	24967	he	720	" A terribly lazy mood , I should say . "
25396	25583	25111	25111	I	0	" On the contrary , a tiresomely active one . It is mine , at present , and , therefore , continue minutely . I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage , to their various occupants ; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker - on . They do live more in earnest , more in themselves , and less in surface change , and frivolous external things . I could fancy a love for life here almost possible ; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year 's standing — one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite , and do it justice — the other , introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks ; he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole ; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance . "
25584	25603	25605	25606	Mrs. Dean	71	" Oh ! here we are the same as anywhere else , when you get to know us , "
25614	25618	25619	25619	I	0	" Excuse me , "
25622	25704	25619	25619	I	0	" you , my good friend , are a striking evidence against that assertion . Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence ; you have no marks of the manners that I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class . I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think . You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties , for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles . "
25709	25722	25723	25723	she	71	" I certainly esteem myself a steady , reasonable kind of body , "
25726	25845	25723	25723	she	71	" not exactly from living among the hills , and seeing one set of faces , and one series of actions , from year 's end to year 's end : but I have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom ; and then , I have read more than you would fancy , Mr. Lockwood . You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into , and got something out of also ; unless it be that range of Greek and Latin , and that of French — and those I know one from another , it is as much as you can expect of a poor man 's daughter . "
25967	25975	25976	25976	she	736	" Oh , such a grand bairn ! "
25980	26082	25976	25976	she	736	" The finest lad that ever breathed ! but the doctor says missis must go ; he says she 's been in a consumption these many months . I heard him tell Mr. Hindley — and now she has nothing to keep her , and she 'll be dead before winter . You must come home directly . You 're to nurse it , Nelly — to feed it with sugar and milk , and take care of it , day and night — I wish I were you , because it will be all yours when there is no missis ! "
26083	26090	26091	26091	I	0	" But is she very ill ? "
26104	26115	26117	26118	the girl	739	" I guess she is ; yet she looks bravely , "
26120	26301	26117	26118	the girl	739	" and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man . She 's out of her head for joy , it 's such a beauty ! If I were her I 'm certain I should not die . I should get better at the bare sight of it , in spite of Kenneth . I was fairly mad at him . Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master , in the house , and his face just began to light up , then the old croaker steps forward , and , says he:—'Earnshaw , it 's a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son . When she came , I felt convinced we should n't keep her long ; and now , I must tell you , the winter will probably finish her . Do n't take on , and fret about it too much , it ca n't be helped . And besides , you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass ! "
26302	26310	26311	26311	I	0	" And what did the master answer ? "
26314	26336	26338	26338	she	740	" I think he swore — but , I did n't mind him , I was straining to see the bairn , "
26440	26441	26448	26448	Nell	80	" "
26450	26460	26448	26448	Nell	80	" he replied , putting on a cheerful smile . "
26465	26471	26472	26473	the doctor	528	" I ventured to inquire , "
26478	26479	26481	26482	the doctor	528	" "
26484	26490	26481	26482	the doctor	528	" he interrupted , reddening . "
26555	26574	26547	26548	Mr. Kenneth	92	" I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw ; she seemed in flighty spirits , and replied merrily — "
26615	26683	26684	26684	I	0	" Poor soul ! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her ; and her husband persisted doggedly , nay , furiously , in affirming her health improved every day . When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady , and he need n't put him to further expense by attending her , he retorted — "
26736	27352	26694	26694	she	749	" He told his wife the same story , and she seemed to believe him ; but one night , while leaning on his shoulder , in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to - morrow , a fit of coughing took her — a very slight one — he raised her in his arms ; she put her two hands about his neck , her face changed , and she was dead . As the girl had anticipated ; the child Hareton , fell wholly into my hands . Mr. Earnshaw , provided he saw him healthy , and never heard him cry , was contented , as far as regarded him . For himself , he grew desperate ; his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament , he neither wept nor prayed — he cursed and defied — execrated God and man , and gave himself up to reckless dissipation . The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long : Joseph and I were the only two that would stay . I had not the heart to leave my charge ; and besides , you know , I had been his foster sister , and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would . Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers ; and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove . The master 's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and Heathcliff . His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint . And , truly , it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period . He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption ; and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity . I could not half tell what an infernal house we had . The curate dropped calling , and nobody decent came near us , at last ; unless , Edgar Linton 's visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception . At fifteen she was the queen of the country - side ; she had no peer : and she did turn out a haughty , headstrong creature ! I own I did not like her , after her infancy was past ; and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance ; she never took an aversion to me though . She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments ; even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably , and young Linton , with all his superiority , found it difficult to make an equally deep impression . He was my late master ; that is his portrait over the fireplace . It used to hang on one side , and his wife 's on the other ; but her 's has been removed , or else you might see something of what she was . Can you make that out ? Mrs. Dean raised the candle , and I discerned a soft - featured face , exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights , but more pensive and amiable in expression . It formed a sweet picture . The long light hair curled slightly on the temples ; the eyes were large and serious ; the figure almost too graceful . I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual . I marvelled much how he , with a mind to correspond with his person , could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw . "
27358	27365	26694	26694	she	749	" I observed to the housekeeper . "
27370	27371	26694	26694	she	749	" "
27374	27378	26694	26694	she	749	" she answered ; "
27401	27521	27395	27395	he	750	" Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five weeks ' residence among them ; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company , and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy , she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman , by her ingenious cordiality ; gained the admiration of Isabella , and the heart and soul of her brother — acquisitions that flattered her from the first , for she was full of ambition — and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone . In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a "
27526	27528	27395	27395	he	750	" and "
27534	28213	28214	28214	Cathy	56	" she took care not to act like him ; but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at , and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit , nor praise . Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly . He had a terror of Earnshaw 's reputation , and shrunk from encountering him , and yet , he was always received with our best attempts at civility : the master himself , avoided offending him — knowing why he came , and if he could not be gracious , kept out of the way . I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to Catherine ; she was not artful , never played the coquette , and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all : for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton , in his presence , she could not half coincide , as she did in his absence ; and when Linton evinced disgust , and antipathy to Heathcliff , she dare not treat his sentiments with indifference , as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her . I 've had many a laugh at her perplexities , and untold troubles , which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery . That sounds ill - natured — but she was so proud , it became really impossible to pity her distresses , till she should be chastened into more humility . She did bring herself , finally , to confess , and confide in me . There was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser . Mr. Hindley had gone from home , one afternoon ; and Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday , on the strength of it . He had reached the age of sixteen then , I think , and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect , he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of . In the first place , he had , by that time , lost the benefit of his early education : continual hard work , begun soon and concluded late , had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge , and any love for books , or learning . His childhood 's sense of superiority , instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw , was faded away . He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret : but , he yielded completely ; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward , when he found he must , necessarily , sink beneath his former level . Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration ; he acquired a slouching gait , and ignoble look ; his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness ; and he took a grim pleasure , apparently , in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance . Catherine and he were constant companions still , at his seasons of respite from labour ; but , he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words , and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses , as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him . On the before - named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing , while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress — she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle , and imagining she would have the whole place to herself , she managed , by some means , to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother 's absence , and was then preparing to receive him . "
28223	28227	28214	28214	Cathy	56	" asked Heathcliff , "
28233	28234	28214	28214	Cathy	56	" "
28241	28245	28214	28214	Cathy	56	" she answered . "
28256	28260	28248	28248	you	56	" he said , "
28267	28268	28261	28261	Nobody	442	" "
28275	28279	28261	28261	Nobody	442	" stammered Miss , "
28305	28306	28307	28307	Hindley	75	" "
28318	28323	28307	28307	Hindley	75	" observed the boy , "
28340	28341	28334	28334	I	0	" "
28349	28353	28345	28345	Joseph	45	" she suggested , "
28359	28360	28361	28361	Joseph	45	" "
28386	28420	28421	28421	Isabella	82	" So saying he lounged to the fire , and sat down , Catherine reflected an instant , with knitted brows — she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion . "
28432	28444	28424	28425	Edgar Linton	81	" she said at the conclusion of a minute 's silence . "
28476	28477	28479	28479	Ellen	80	" "
28488	28492	28486	28486	Cathy	56	" he persisted , "
28525	28526	28528	28528	they	757	" "
28531	28543	28528	28528	they	757	" cried Catherine , gazing at him with a troubled countenance . "
28547	28559	28560	28560	you	80	" she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands , "
28590	28591	28580	28580	you	80	" "
28604	28619	28580	28580	you	80	" he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window , and continued ; "
28651	28652	28642	28642	you	80	" "
28664	28672	28660	28660	I	0	" replied Catherine in a peevish tone . "
28681	28682	28660	28660	I	0	" "
28691	28695	28660	28660	I	0	" said Heathcliff . "
28705	28713	28698	28698	I	0	" she demanded , growing more irritated . "
28749	28750	28751	28751	You	80	" "
28773	28780	28751	28751	You	80	" exclaimed Heathcliff in much agitation . "
28796	28933	28789	28789	people	445	" she muttered . Her companion rose up , but he had n't time to express his feelings further , for a horse 's feet were heard on the flags , and , having knocked gently , young Linton entered , his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received . Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in , and the other went out . The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak , hilly , coal country , for a beautiful fertile valley ; and his voice , and greeting were as opposite as his aspect — He had a sweet , low manner of speaking , and pronounced his words as you do , that 's less gruff than we talk here and softer . "
28944	28974	28789	28789	people	445	" he said , casting a look at me , I had begun to wipe the plate , and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser . "
28977	28981	28789	28789	people	445	" answered Catherine . "
28990	28991	28984	28984	you	0	" "
28997	29031	28995	28995	Miss	761	" I replied . ( Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay . ) She stepped behind me and whispered crossly , "
29060	29061	29046	29046	servants	2956	" "
29074	29079	29080	29080	he	2968	" I answered aloud , "
29101	29102	29095	29096	Mr. Edgar	91	" "
29113	29142	29105	29105	you	0	" exclaimed the young lady imperiously , not allowing her guest time to speak — she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff . "
29152	29235	29149	29150	Miss Catherine	56	" was my response ; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation . She , supposing Edgar could not see her , snatched the cloth from my hand , and pinched me , with a prolonged wrench , very spitefully on the arm . I 've said I did not love her ; and rather relished mortifying her vanity , now and then ; besides , she hurt me extremely , so I started up from my knees , and screamed out . "
29263	29264	29265	29265	I	0	" "
29275	29313	29265	29265	I	0	" cried she , her fingers tingling to repeat the act , and her ears red with rage . She never had power to conceal her passion , it always set her whole complexion in a blaze . "
29319	29367	29368	29368	Catherine	56	" I retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her . She stamped her foot , wavered a moment , and then , irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her , slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water . "
29374	29395	29372	29372	Catherine	56	" interposed Linton , greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood , and violence which his idol had committed . "
29402	29440	29443	29443	Cathy	56	" she repeated , trembling all over . Little Hareton , who followed me everywhere , and was sitting near me on the floor , at seeing my tears commenced crying himself , and sobbed out complaints against "
29445	29577	29443	29443	Cathy	56	" which drew her fury on to his unlucky head : she seized his shoulders , and shook him till the poor child waxed livid , and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him . In an instant one was wrung free , and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest . He drew back in consternation — I lifted Hareton in my arms , and walked off to the kitchen with him ; leaving the door of communication open , for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement . The insulted visiter moved to the spot where he had laid his hat , pale and with a quivering lip . "
29582	29588	29443	29443	Cathy	56	" I said to myself , "
29609	29610	29613	29613	you	769	" "
29616	29633	29634	29634	You	769	" demanded Catherine , advancing to the door . He swerved aside and attempted to pass . "
29639	29644	29634	29634	You	769	" she exclaimed energetically . "
29650	29658	29645	29645	I	0	" he replied in a subdued voice . "
29661	29669	29634	29634	You	769	" she persisted , grasping the handle ; "
29705	29706	29697	29697	I	0	" "
29716	29724	29725	29725	You	769	" asked Linton . Catherine was mute . "
29736	29740	29725	29725	You	769	" he continued ; "
29748	29760	29762	29762	you	769	" Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle . "
29768	29772	29762	29762	you	769	" he said . "
29777	29784	29773	29773	I	0	" she cried , recovering her speech "
29812	29852	29807	29807	I'll	0	" She dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest . Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court ; there , he lingered . I resolved to encourage him . "
29860	29865	29853	29853	Miss	771	" I called out . "
29891	30240	29873	29873	you'd	2571	" The soft thing looked askance through the window — he possessed the power to depart , as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed , or a bird half eaten — Ah , I thought ; there will be no saving him — He 's doomed , and flies to his fate ! And , so it was ; he turned abruptly , hastened into the house again , shut the door behind him ; and , when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk , ready to pull the old place about our ears , ( his ordinary frame of mind in that condition ) I saw the quarrel had merely affected a closer intimacy — had broken the outworks of youthful timidity , and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship , and confess themselves lovers . Intelligence of Mr. Hindley 's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse , and Catherine to her chamber . I went to hide little Hareton , and to take the shot out of the master 's fowling piece which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement , to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked , or even , attracted his notice too much ; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it , that he might do less mischief , if he did go the length of firing the gun . He entered , vociferating oaths dreadful to hear ; and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard . Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild - beast 's fondness , or his madman 's rage — for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death , and in the other of being flung into the fire , or dashed against the wall — and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him . "
30250	30268	30242	30242	I	0	" cried Hindley , pulling me back by the skin of the neck , like a dog , "
30366	30367	30320	30320	you	777	" "
30380	30399	30369	30369	I	0	" I answered , it has been cutting red herrings — I'd rather be shot if you please . "
30400	30407	30408	30408	he	0	" You 'd rather be damned ! "
30411	30440	30441	30441	He	0	" and so you shall — No law in England can hinder a man from keeping his house decent , and mine 's abominable ! open your mouth . "
30490	30491	30471	30471	I	0	" "
30494	30691	30471	30471	I	0	" said he releasing me , I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton — I beg your pardon , Nell — if it be he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me , and for screaming as if I were a goblin . Unnatural cub , come hither ! I 'll teach thee to impose on a good - hearted , deluded father — Now , do n't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped ? It makes a dog fiercer , and I love something fierce — Get me a scissors — something fierce and trim ! Besides , it 's infernal affectation — devilish conceit , it is to cherish our ears — we're asses enough without them . Hush , child , hush ! well then , it is my darling I wisht , dry thy eyes — there 's a joy ; kiss me ; what it wo n't ? kiss me , Hareton ! Dam'n thee , kiss me ! By God , as if I would rear such a monster ! As sure as I 'm living , I 'll break the brat 's neck . "
30773	30778	30779	30779	he	75	" Who is that ? "
31026	31034	31035	31035	be	75	" It is your fault , Ellen , "
31038	31061	31035	31035	be	75	" you should have kept him out of sight ; you should have taken him from me ! Is he injured anywhere ? "
31062	31065	31066	31066	I	0	" Injured ! "
31070	31119	31120	31120	He	75	" If he 's not killed , he 'll be an idiot ! Oh ! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him . You 're worse than a heathen — treating your own flesh and blood in that manner ! "
31168	31176	31177	31177	I	0	" You shall not meddle with him ! "
31180	31210	31177	31177	I	0	" He hates you — they all hate you — that 's the truth ! A happy family you have ; and a pretty state you 're come to ! "
31211	31223	31225	31227	the misguided man	792	" I shall come to a prettier , yet ! Nelly , "
31233	31289	31293	31293	he	792	" At present , convey yourself and him away — And , hark you , Heathcliff ! clear you too , quite from my reach and hearing . . .I would n't murder you to - night , unless , perhaps I set the house on fire ; but that 's as my fancy goes — "
31311	31316	31317	31317	I	0	" Nay do n't ! "
31320	31341	31317	31317	I	0	" Mr. Hindley do take warning . Have mercy on this unfortunate boy , if you care nothing for yourself ! "
31342	31355	31356	31356	he	792	" Any one will do better for him , than I shall , "
31359	31367	31368	31368	I	0	" Have mercy on your own soul ! "
31380	31404	31406	31407	the blasphemer	793	" Not I ! on the contrary , I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition , to punish its maker , "
31409	31417	31418	31418	He	792	" Here 's to its hearty damnation ! "
31447	31460	31462	31462	Heathcliff	48	" It 's a pity he can not kill himself with drink , "
31476	31532	31462	31462	Heathcliff	48	" He 's doing his very utmost ; but his constitution defies him — Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare , that he 'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton , and go to the grave a hoary sinner ; unless , some happy chance out of the common course befall him . "
31615	31636	31600	31600	I	0	" It was far in the night , and the bairnies grat , The mither beneath the mools heard that . "

31667	31672	31673	31673	I	0	" Yes , Miss , "
31748	31753	31754	31754	she	56	" Where 's Heathcliff ? "
31760	31768	31754	31754	she	56	" About his work in the stable , "
31862	31867	31868	31868	she	56	" Oh , dear ! "
31873	31879	31868	31868	she	56	" I 'm very unhappy ! "
31880	31884	31886	31886	I	0	" A pity , "
31888	31911	31886	31886	I	0	" you 're hard to please — so many friends and so few cares , and ca n't make yourself , content ! "
31912	31923	31924	31924	she	56	" Nelly , will you keep a secret for me ? "
31966	31972	31973	31973	I	0	" Is it worth keeping ? "
31978	32046	31973	31973	I	0	" Yes , and it worries me , and I must let it out ! I want to know what I should do — Today , Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him , and I 've given him an answer — Now , before I tell you whether it was a consent , or denial — you tell me which it ought to have been . "
32047	32058	32059	32059	I	0	" Really , Miss Catherine , how can I know ? "
32062	32109	32059	32059	I	0	" To be sure , considering the exhibition you performed in his presence , this afternoon , I might say it would be wise to refuse him — since he asked you after that , he must either be hopelessly stupid , or a venturesome fool . "
32110	32124	32125	32125	she	803	" If you talk so , I wo nt tell you any more , "
32135	32152	32125	32125	she	803	" I accepted him , Nelly ; be quick , and say whether I was wrong ! "
32153	32179	32059	32059	I	0	" You accepted him ? then , what good is it discussing the matter ? You have pledged your word , and can not retract . "
32180	32193	32194	32194	she	803	" But , say whether I should have done so — do ! "
32209	32226	32227	32227	I	0	" There are many things to be considered , before that question can be answered properly . "
32231	32242	32227	32227	I	0	" First and foremost , do you love Mr. Edgar ? "
32243	32254	32255	32255	she	803	" Who can help it ? of course I do , "
32279	32289	32259	32259	I	0	" Why do you love him , Miss Cathy ? "
32290	32300	32227	32227	I	0	" Nonsense , I do — that 's sufficient . "
32301	32311	32227	32227	I	0	" By no means ; you must say why ? "
32312	32326	32259	32259	I	0	" Well , because he is handsome , and pleasant to be with . "
32327	32330	32332	32332	my	0	" Bad , "
32335	32344	32332	32332	my	0	" And because he is young and cheerful . "
32345	32350	32227	32227	I	0	" Bad , still . "
32351	32359	32227	32227	I	0	" And , because he loves me . "
32360	32366	32332	32332	my	0	" Indifferent , coming there . "
32367	32398	32227	32227	I	0	" And he will be rich , and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood , and I shall be proud of having such a husband . "
32399	32414	32227	32227	I	0	" Worst of all ! And , now , say how you love him ? "
32415	32426	32332	32332	my	0	" As every body loves — You're silly , Nelly . "
32427	32434	32332	32332	my	0	" Not at all — Answer . "
32435	32483	32227	32227	I	0	" I love the ground under his feet , and the air over his head , and everything he touches , and every word he says — I love all his looks , and all his actions , and him entirely , and altogether . There now ! "
32484	32488	32332	32332	my	0	" And why ? "
32489	32514	32516	32518	the young lady	276	" Nay — you are making a jest of it ; it is exceedingly ill - natured ! It 's no jest to me ! "
32529	32540	32541	32541	I	0	" I 'm very far from jesting , Miss Catherine , "
32544	32601	32541	32541	I	0	" you love Mr. Edgar , because he is handsome , and young , and cheerful , and rich , and loves you . The last , however , goes for nothing — You would love him without that , probably , and with it , you would n't unless he possessed the four former attractions . "
32602	32630	32332	32332	my	0	" No , to be sure not — I should only pity him — hate him , perhaps , if he were ugly , and a clown . "
32631	32665	32332	32332	my	0	" But , there are several other handsome , rich young men in the world ; handsomer , possibly , and richer than he is — What should hinder you from loving them ? "
32666	32685	32332	32332	my	0	" If there be any , they are out of my way — I've seen none like Edgar . "
32686	32710	32332	32332	my	0	" You may see some ; and he wo n't always be handsome , and young , and may not always be rich . "
32711	32733	32332	32332	my	0	" He is now ; and I have only to do with the present — I wish you would speak rationally . "
32734	32755	32332	32332	my	0	" Well , that settles it — if you have only to do with the present , marry Mr. Linton . "
32756	32784	32332	32332	my	0	" I do n't want your permission for that — I shall marry him ; and yet , you have not told me whether I 'm right . "
32785	32867	32332	32332	my	0	" Perfectly right ; if people be right to marry only for the present . And now , let us hear what you are unhappy about . Your brother will be pleased . . .The old lady and gentleman will not object , I think — you will escape from a disorderly , comfortless home into a wealthy respectable one ; and you love Edgar , and Edgar loves you . All seems smooth and easy — where is the obstacle ? "
32868	32874	32876	32876	Catherine	56	" Here ! and here ! "
32892	32916	32876	32876	Catherine	56	" In whichever place the soul lives — in my soul , and in my heart , I 'm convinced I 'm wrong ! "
32917	32930	32332	32332	my	0	" That 's very strange ! I can not make it out . "
32931	32970	32971	32971	She	56	" It 's my secret ; but if you will not mock at me , I 'll explain it ; I ca n't do it distinctly — but I 'll give you a feeling of how I feel . "
32991	33001	33002	33002	she	56	" Nelly , do you never dream queer dreams ? "
33013	33014	33002	33002	she	56	" "
33021	33025	33002	33002	she	56	" I answered . "
33094	33095	33076	33076	I'm	0	" "
33104	33108	33101	33102	Miss Catherine	56	" I cried . "
33154	33155	33148	33148	he	97	" "
33221	33222	33223	33223	I	0	" "
33235	33306	33229	33229	I	0	" I repeated , hastily . I was superstitious about dreams then , and am still ; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect , that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy , and foresee a fearful catastrophe . She was vexed , but she did not proceed . Apparently taking up another subject , she re - commenced in a short time . "
33321	33322	33315	33315	I	0	" "
33332	33336	33324	33324	you	80	" I answered . "
33345	33346	33324	33324	you	80	" "
33364	33365	33354	33354	I	0	" "
33386	33409	33380	33380	I	0	" I interrupted again . She laughed , and held me down , for I made a motion to leave my chair . "
33414	33418	33419	33419	I	0	" cried she ; "
33605	33700	33589	33589	Linton	81	" Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff 's presence . Having noticed a slight movement , I turned my head , and saw him rise from the bench , and steal out , noiselessly . He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him , and then he staid to hear no farther . My companion , sitting on the ground , was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure ; but I started , and bade her hush ! "
33703	33711	33589	33589	Linton	81	" she asked , gazing nervously round . "
33716	33733	33712	33712	Joseph	45	" I answered , catching , opportunely , the roll of his cartwheels up the road ; "
33756	33757	33747	33747	he	45	" "
33769	33773	33760	33760	he	45	" said she . "
33833	33834	33835	33835	I	0	" "
33850	33854	33857	33857	you	0	" I returned ; "
33920	33921	33917	33918	Miss Catherine	56	" "
33929	33939	33926	33926	we	823	" she exclaimed , with an accent of indignation . "
34116	34117	34108	34108	him	45	" "
34127	34131	34124	34125	Miss Catherine	56	" I asked . "
34172	34173	34153	34153	I	0	" "
34178	34182	34153	34153	I	0	" retorted she , "
34449	34480	34491	34491	Miss	843	" She paused , and hid her face in the folds of my gown ; but I jerked it forcibly away . I was out of patience with her folly ! "
34493	34497	34482	34482	I	0	" I said , "
34545	34546	34547	34547	You	0	" "
34552	34558	34547	34547	You	0	" she asked , eagerly . "
34566	34671	34561	34561	I	0	" I repeated . She was about to insist , when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation ; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner , and nursed Hareton , while I made the supper . After it was cooked , my fellow servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley ; and we did n't settle it till all was nearly cold . Then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask , if he wanted any , for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been sometime alone . "
34698	34709	34713	34713	him	845	" demanded the old man , looking round for Heathcliff . "
34715	34719	34713	34713	him	845	" I replied . "
34731	34862	34720	34720	He	845	" I went and called , but got no answer . On returning , I whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said , I was sure ; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother 's conduct regarding him . She jumped up in a fine fright — flung Hareton onto the settle , and ran to seek for her friend herself , not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried , or how her talk would have affected him . She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we should wait no longer . He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing . They were "
34870	34950	34720	34720	He	845	" he affirmed . And , on their behalf , he added , that night a special prayer to the usual quarter of an hour 's supplication before meat , and would have tacked another to the end of the grace , had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command , that he must run down the road , and , wherever Heathcliff had rambled , find and make him re - enter directly ! "
34951	34973	34980	34980	he	847	" I want to speak to him , and I must , before I go up - stairs , she said . "
35008	35057	34994	34994	I	0	" Joseph objected at first ; she was too much in earnest , however , to suffer contradiction ; and , at last , he placed his hat on his head , and walked grumbling forth . Meantime , Catherine paced up and down the floor , exclaiming — "
35071	35118	35064	35064	I	0	" What did I say , Nelly ? I 've forgotten . Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon ? Dear ! tell me what I 've said to grieve him ? I do wish he 'd come . I do wish be would ! "
35119	35126	35127	35127	I	0	" What a noise for nothing ! "
35135	35196	35197	35197	I	0	" What a trifle scares you ! It 's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors , or , even lie too sulky to speak to us , in the hay - loft . I 'll engage he 's lurking there . See , if I do n't ferret him out ! "
35218	35226	35228	35228	he	45	" Yon lad gets war un war ! "
35234	35335	35228	35228	he	45	" He 's left th ' yate ut t ' full swing , and miss 's pony has trodden dahn two rigs uh corn , un plottered through , raight o'er intuh t ' meadow ! Hahsomdiver , t ' maister ' ull play t ' divil to - morn , and he 'll do weel . He 's patience itsseln wi ' sich careless , offald craters — patience itsseln he is ! Bud he 'll nut be soa allus — yah 's see , all on ye ! Yah mumn't drive him aht uf his heead fur nowt ! "
35336	35345	35347	35347	Catherine	56	" Have you found Heathcliff , you ass ? "
35349	35361	35347	35347	Catherine	56	" Have you been looking for him , as I ordered ? "
35362	35373	35374	35374	he	848	" Aw sud more likker look for th ' horse , "
35377	35435	35374	35374	he	848	" It ' ud be tuh more sense . Bud , aw can look for norther horse , nur man uf a neeght loike this — as black as t ' chimbley ! und Hathecliff 's noan t ' chap tuh coom ut maw whistle — happen he 'll be less hard uh hearing wi ' ye ! "
35874	35878	35879	35879	I	0	" Well Miss ! "
35886	35981	35879	35879	I	0	" You are not bent on getting your death , are you ? Do you know what o'clock it is ? Half - past twelve . Come ! come to bed ; there 's no use waiting longer on that foolish boy — he'll be gone to Gimmerton , and he 'll stay there now . He guesses we should n't wake for him till this late hour ; at least , he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up ; and he 'd rather avoid having the door opened by the master . "
35982	35993	35995	35995	Joseph	45	" Nay , nay , he 's noan at Gimmerton ! "
35997	36071	36073	36073	he	45	" Aw 's niver wonder , bud he 's at t ' bothoin uf a bog - hoile . This visitation worn't for nowt , und aw wod hev ye tub look aht . Miss,—yah muh be t ' next . Thank Hivin for all ! All warks togither for gooid tuh them as is chozzen , and piked aht froo ' th ' rubbidge ! Yah knaw whet t ' Scripture ses — "
36225	36232	36233	36233	he	45	" What ails you , Cathy ? "
36240	36259	36233	36233	he	45	" You look as dismal as a drowned whelp — Why are you so damp and pale child ? "
36260	36266	36267	36267	she	56	" I 've been wet ; "
36270	36280	36233	36233	he	45	" and I 'm cold , that 's all . "
36281	36288	36289	36289	I	0	" Oh , she is naughty ! "
36300	36331	36289	36289	I	0	" She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening , and there she has sat , the night through , and I could n't prevail on her to stir . "
36340	36345	36346	36346	he	75	" The night through , "
36349	36370	36346	36346	he	75	" What kept her up , not fear of the thunder , surely ? That was over , hours since . "
36446	36457	36440	36440	Catherine	56	" Ellen , shut the window . I 'm starving ! "
36472	36477	36479	36479	Hindley	75	" She 's ill — "
36485	36522	36479	36479	Hindley	75	" I suppose that 's the reason she would not go to bed — Damn it ! I do n't want to be troubled with more sickness , here — What took you into the rain ? "
36523	36531	36533	36533	Joseph	45	" Running after t'lads , as usuald ! "
36550	36731	36533	36533	Joseph	45	" If Aw wur yah , maister , Aw'd just slam t'boards i ' their faces all on 'em , gentle and simple ! Never a day ut yah're off , but yon cat uh Linton comes sneaking hither — and Miss Nelly shoo 's a fine lass ! shoo sits watching for ye i ' t'kitchen ; and as yah're in at one door , he 's aht at t'other — Und , then , wer grand lady goes a coorting uf hor side ! It 's bonny behaviour , lurking amang t'flields , after twelve ut ' night , wi that fahl , flaysome divil uf a gipsy , Heathcliff , ! They think Aw'm blind ; but Aw'm noan , now't ut t'soart ! Aw seed young Linton , boath coming and going , and Aw seed yah ( directing his discourse to me . ) Yah gooid fur nowt , slattenly witch ! nip up nud bolt intuh th ' haks , t ' minute yah heard t'maister 's horse fit clatter up t ' road . "
36736	36740	36734	36734	eavesdropper	872	" cried Catherine , "
36749	36788	36734	36734	eavesdropper	872	" Edgar Linton , came yesterday , by chance , Hindley : and it was I who told him to be off : because , I knew you would not like to have met him as you were . "
36789	36798	36800	36801	her brother	527	" You lie , Cathy , no doubt , "
36803	36920	36800	36801	her brother	527	" and you are a confounded simpleton ! But , never mind Linton , at present — Tell me , were you not with Heathcliff , last night ? Speak the truth , now . You need not be afraid of harming him — Though I hate him as much as ever , he did me a good turn , a short time since , that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck . To prevent it , I shall send him about his business , this very morning ; and after he 's gone , I 'd advise you all to look sharp , I shall only have the more humour for you ! "
36921	36929	36931	36931	Catherine	56	" I never saw Heathcliff last night , "
36938	36972	36931	36931	Catherine	56	" and if yon do turn him out of doors , I 'll go with him . But , perhaps , you 'll never have an opportunity — perhaps , he 's gone . "
38206	38219	38220	38220	she	71	" It wants twenty minutes , sir , to taking the medicine , "
38223	38230	38220	38220	she	71	" Away , away with it ! "
38234	38240	38220	38220	she	71	" I desire to have — "
38241	38251	38190	38190	she	71	" The doctor says you must drop the powders . "
38252	38365	38190	38190	she	71	" With all my heart ! Do n't interrupt me . Come and take your seat here . Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials . Draw your knitting out of your pocket — that will do — now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff , from where you left off , to the present day . Did he finish his education on the Continent , and come back a gentleman ? or did he get a sizer 's place at college ? or escape to America , and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster country ? or make a fortune more promptly , on the English highways ? "
38366	38461	38220	38220	she	71	" He may have done a little in all these vocations , Mr. Lockwood ; but I could n't give my word for any . I stated before that I did n't know how he gained his money ; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk ; but , with your leave , I 'll proceed in my own fashion , if you think it will amuse , and not weary you . Are you feeling better this morning ? "
38462	38465	38190	38190	she	71	" Much . "
38466	38584	38220	38220	she	71	" That 's good news . I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange : and to my agreeable disappointment , she behaved infinitely better than I dared to expect . She seemed almost over fond of Mr. Linton ; and even to his sister , she showed plenty of affection . They were both very attentive to her comfort , certainly . It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles , but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn . There were no mutual concessions ; one stood erect , and the others yielded ; and who can be ill - natured , and bad - tempered , when they encounter neither opposition , nor indifference ? "
38685	38804	38648	38648	He	91	" Not to grieve a kind master I learnt to be less touchy ; and , for the space of half a year , the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand , because no fire came near to explode it . Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence , now and then , they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband , who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution , produced by her perilous illness , as she was never subject to depression of spirits before . The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him . I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness . "
38858	38973	38975	38975	Nelly	80	" On a mellow evening in September , I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering . It had got dusk , and the moon looked over the high wall of the court , causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building . I set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door , and lingered to rest , and draw in a few more breaths of the soft , sweet air ; my eyes were on the moon , and my back to the entrance , when I heard a voice behind me say — "
38982	39038	38975	38975	Nelly	80	" It was a deep voice , and foreign in tone : yet , there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar . I turned about to discover who spoke , fearfully , for the doors were shut , and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps . "
39087	39115	39125	39125	he	0	" ' Who can it be ? ' I thought . ' Mr. Earnshaw ? Oh , no ! The voice has no resemblance to his . ' "
39203	39204	39198	39198	I	0	" "
39207	39229	39198	39198	I	0	" I cried , uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visiter , and I raised my hands in amazement . "
39244	39245	39248	39248	Heathcliff	43	" "
39250	39276	39248	39248	Heathcliff	43	" he replied , glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons , but showed no lights from within . "
39331	39332	39322	39325	some person from Gimmerton	942	" "
39339	39343	39322	39325	some person from Gimmerton	942	" I exclaimed , "
39386	39387	39383	39384	a soldier	943	" "
39395	39408	39409	39409	He	0	" he interrupted impatiently ; I 'm in hell till you do ! "
39629	39641	39674	39674	she	48	" A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you , ma'am . "
39642	39648	39650	39651	Mrs. Linton	48	" What does he want ? "
39653	39660	39661	39661	I	0	" I did not question him , "
39664	39673	39674	39674	she	48	" Well , close the curtains , Nelly , "
39677	39690	39691	39691	She	48	" and bring up tea . I 'll be back again directly . "
39705	39714	39715	39715	I	0	" Some one the mistress does not expect , "
39718	39737	39715	39715	I	0	" That Heathcliff , you recollect him , sir , who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw 's . "
39738	39749	39750	39750	he	91	" What , the gipsy — the plough - boy ? "
39753	39763	39750	39750	he	91	" Why did you not say so to Catherine ? "
39764	39778	39779	39779	I	0	" Hush ! you must not call him by those names , master , "
39782	39812	39779	39779	I	0	" She 'd be sadly grieved to hear you . She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off ; I guess his return will make a jubilee to her . "
39852	39871	39846	39846	he	73	" Do n't stand there love ! Bring the person in , if it be any one particular . "
39915	39922	39923	39923	she	56	" Oh , Edgar , Edgar ! "
39933	39948	39923	39923	she	56	" Oh , Edgar , darling ! Heathcliff 's come back — he is ! "
39958	39963	39965	39966	her husband	2614	" Well , well , "
39970	39996	39965	39966	her husband	2614	" do n't strangle me for that ! He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure . There is no need to be frantic ! "
39997	40006	40007	40007	she	56	" I know you did n't like him , "
40019	40039	40007	40007	she	56	" Yet for my sake , you must be friends now . Shall I tell him to come up ? "
40040	40043	40044	40044	he	2614	" Here , "
40047	40052	40044	40044	he	2614	" into the parlour ? "
40053	40057	40058	40058	she	56	" Where else ? "
40095	40098	40099	40099	she	48	" No , "
40106	40189	40099	40099	she	48	" I can not sit in the kitchen . Set two tables here , Ellen ; one for your master and Miss Isabella , being gentry ; the other for Heathcliff and myself , being of the lower orders . Will that please you , dear ? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere ? If so , give directions . I 'll run down and secure my guest . I 'm afraid the joy is too great to be real ! "
40203	40210	40211	40211	he	91	" You bid him step up , "
40217	40249	40211	40211	he	91	" and , Catherine , try to be glad , without being absurd ! The whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother . "
40524	40530	40531	40531	he	43	" Sit down , sir , "
40537	40569	40531	40531	he	43	" Mrs. Linton , recalling old times , would have me give you a cordial reception , and , of course , I am gratified when anything occurs to please her . "
40570	40575	40577	40577	Heathcliff	43	" And I also , "
40579	40601	40602	40602	He	43	" especially if it be anything in which I have a part . I shall stay an hour or two willingly . "
40721	40732	40733	40733	she	930	" I shall think it a dream to - morrow ! "
40736	40788	40733	40733	she	930	" I shall not be able to believe that I have seen , and touched , and spoken to you once more — and yet , cruel Heathcliff ! you do n't deserve this welcome . To be absent and silent for three years , and never to think of me ! "
40789	40800	40801	40801	he	43	" A little more than you have thought of me ! "
40804	40944	40733	40733	she	930	" I heard of your marriage , Cathy , not long since ; and , while waiting in the yard below , I meditated this plan — just to have one glimpse of your face — a stare of surprise , perhaps , and pretended pleasure ; afterwards settle my score with Hindley ; and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself . Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind ; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time ! Nay , you 'll not drive me off again — you were really sorry for me , were you ? Well , there was cause . I 've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice , and you must forgive me , for I struggled only for you ! "
40945	40963	40965	40965	Linton	56	" Catherine , unless we are to have cold tea , please to come to the table , "
40981	41003	41004	41004	She	979	" Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk , wherever he may lodge to - night ; and I 'm thirsty . "
41101	41108	41109	41109	he	982	" No , to Wuthering Heights , "
41112	41123	41109	41109	he	982	" Mr. Earnshaw invited me when I called this morning . "
41233	41241	41242	41242	she	48	" I can not rest , Ellen ; "
41249	41362	41242	41242	she	48	" And I want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness ! Edgar is sulky , because I 'm glad of a thing that does not interest him — He refuses to open his mouth , except to utter pettish , silly speeches ; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy . He always contrives to be sick at the least cross ! I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff , and he , either for a headache or a pang of envy , began to cry : so I got up and left him . "
41363	41373	41374	41374	I	0	" What use is it praising Heathcliff to him ? "
41377	41422	41374	41374	I	0	" As lads they had an aversion to each other , and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised — it 's human nature . Let Mr. Linton alone about him , unless you would like an open quarrel between them . "
41423	41432	41434	41434	she	986	" But does it not show great weakness ? "
41436	41573	41434	41434	she	986	" I 'm not envious — I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella 's yellow hair , and the whiteness of her skin ; at her dainty elegance , and the fondness all the family exhibit for her . Even you Nelly , if we have a dispute sometimes , you back Isabella , at once ; and I yield like a foolish mother — I call her a darling , and flatter her into a good temper . It pleases her brother to see us cordial , and that pleases me . But , they are very much alike they are spoiled children , and fancy the world was made for their accommodation ; and , though I humour both , I think a smart chastisement might improve them , all the same . "
41574	41582	41584	41584	I	0	" You 're mistaken , Mrs. Linton , "
41586	41663	41584	41584	I	0	" They humour you — I know what there would be to do if they did not ! You can well afford to indulge their passing whims , as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires — You may , however , fall out , at last , over something of equal consequence to both sides ; and , then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you ! "
41664	41680	41681	41681	she	987	" And then we shall fight to the death , sha n't we , Nelly ? "
41685	41716	41681	41681	she	987	" No ! I tell you , I have such faith in Linton 's love that I believe I might kill him , and he would n't wish to retaliate . "
41729	41733	41734	41734	she	987	" I do , "
41737	41837	41734	41734	she	987	" but , he need n't resort to whining for trifles . It is childish ; and , instead of melting into tears , because I said that Heathcliff was now worthy of any one 's regard , and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend ; he ought to have said it for me , and been delighted from sympathy — He must get accustomed to him , and he may as well like him — considering how Heathcliff has reason to object to him , I 'm sure he behaved excellently ! "
41838	41850	41851	41851	I	0	" What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights ? "
41854	41880	41851	41851	I	0	" He is reformed in every respect , apparently — quite a christian — offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all round ! "
41881	41886	41887	41887	she	989	" He explained it , "
41890	42142	41887	41887	she	989	" I wondered as much as you — He said he called to gather information concerning me , from you , supposing you resided there still ; and Joseph told Hindley who came out , and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing , and how he had been living : and finally , desired him to walk in — There were some persons sitting at cards — Heathcliff joined them ; my brother lost some money to him ; and , finding him plentifully supplied , he requested that he would come again in the evening , to which he consented . Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently ; he does n't trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured — But , Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange , and an attachment to the house where we lived together , and , likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton . He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights ; and doubtless my brother 's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms ; he was always greedy , though what he grasps with one hand , he flings away with the other . "
42143	42159	42161	42161	I	0	" It 's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in ! "
42163	42175	41887	41887	she	989	" Have you no fear of the consequences , Mrs. Linton ? "
42176	42182	42183	42183	she	990	" None for my friend , "
42186	42393	42183	42183	she	990	" his strong head will keep him from danger — a little for Hindley ; but , he ca n't be made morally worse than he is ; and I stand between him and bodily harm — The event of this evening has reconciled me to God , and humanity ! I had risen in angry rebellion against providence — Oh , I 've endured very , very bitter misery . Nelly ! If that creature knew how bitter , he 'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance — It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone : had I expressed the agony I frequently felt , he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I — However , it 's over , and I 'll take no revenge on his folly — I can afford to suffer anything , hereafter ! should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek , I 'd not only turn the other , but , I 'd ask pardon for provoking it — and , as a proof , I 'll , go make my peace with Edgar instantly — Good night — I'm an angel ! "
42877	43009	43012	43012	you	1004	" when she had been peculiarly wayward , rejecting her breakfast , complaining that the servants did not do what she told them ; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house , and Edgar neglected her ; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open , and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her ; with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations ; Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to - bed ; and , having scolded her heartily , threatened to send for the doctor . Mention of Kenneth , caused her to exclaim , instantly , that her health was perfect , and it was only Catherine 's harshness which made ber unhappy . "
43022	43033	43034	43034	You	1004	" cried the mistress , amazed at the unreasonable assertion . "

43192	43201	43189	43189	she	1008	" asked Mrs. Linton , appealing to me . "

43236	43240	43229	43229	I	0	" she answered : "

43276	43283	43284	43284	You	82	" she continued , kindling up . "
43304	43305	43306	43306	You	82	" "
43313	43321	43308	43311	an impertinent little monkey	1011	" exclaimed Mrs. Linton , in surprise . "
43360	43367	43369	43371	the infatuated girl	1013	" No , you have not , "
43373	43395	43369	43371	the infatuated girl	1013	" I love him more than ever you loved Edgar ; and he might love me if you would let him ! "
43396	43408	43409	43409	Catherine	56	" I would n't be you for a kingdom , then ! "
43421	43684	43415	43415	she	56	" Nelly , help me to convince her of her madness . Tell her what Heathcliff is — an unreclaimed creature , without refinement — without cultivation ; an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone . I 'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter 's day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him ! It is deplorable ignorance of his character , child , and nothing else , which makes that dream enter your head , pray do n't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior ! He 's not a rough diamond — a pearl - containing oyster of a rustic ; he 's a fierce , pitiless , wolfish man . I never say to him let this or that enemy alone , because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them — I say let them alone , because I should hate them to be wronged : and he 'd crush you , like a sparrow 's egg , Isabella , if he found you a troublesome charge . I know he could n't love a Linton ; and yet , he 'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune , and expectations . Avarice is growing with him a besetting sin . There 's my picture ; and I 'm his friend — so much so , that had he thought seriously to catch you , I should , perhaps , have held my tongue , and let you fall into his trap . "
43697	43704	43705	43705	she	2886	" For shame ! for shame ! "
43710	43722	43705	43705	she	2886	" You are worse than twenty foes , you poisonous friend ! "
43723	43734	43736	43736	Catherine	56	" Ah ! you wo nt believe me , then ? "
43738	43747	43736	43736	Catherine	56	" You think I speak from wicked selfishness ? "
43748	43755	43757	43757	Isabella	82	" I 'm certain you do , "
43759	43766	43757	43757	Isabella	82	" and I shudder at you ! "
43767	43770	43772	43773	the other	289	" Good ! "
43775	43799	43772	43773	the other	289	" Try for yourself , if that be your spirit ; I have done , and yield the argument to your saucy insolence . "
43800	43809	43810	43810	she	82	" And I must suffer for her egotism ! "
43820	43869	43814	43815	Mrs. Linton	48	" All , all is against me ; she has blighted my single consolation . But she uttered falsehoods , did n't she ? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend ; he has an honourable soul , and a true one , or how could he remember her ? "
43870	43879	43880	43880	I	0	" Banish him from your thoughts , miss , "
43883	44033	43880	43880	I	0	" He 's a bird of bad omen ; no mate for you . Mrs. Linton spoke strongly , and yet , I ca n't contradict her . She is better acquainted with his heart than I , or any one besides ; and she never would represent him as worse than he is . Honest people do n't hide their deeds . How has he been living ? how has he got rich ? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights , the house of a man whom he abhors ? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came . They sit up all night together continually ; and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land ; and does nothing but play and drink , I heard only a week ago ; it was Joseph who told me — I met him at Gimmerton . "
44034	44037	44038	44038	he	1017	" Nelly , "
44041	44328	44038	44038	he	1017	" we 's hae a Crahnr 's ' quest enah , at ahr folks . One on 'em 's a ' most getten his finger cut off wi ' hauding t'other froo ' sticking hisseln loike a cawlf .

44412	44621	44395	44395	you	56	" Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself , or persevered in nursing it perpetually , I can not say ; she had little time to reflect . The day after , there was a justice - meeting at the next town ; my master was obliged to attend ; and Mr. Heathcliff , aware of his absence , called rather earlier than usual . Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library , on hostile terms , but silent . The latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion , and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transcient fit of passion ; the former , on mature consideration , really offended with her companion ; and , if she laughed again at her pertness , inclined to make it no laughing matter to her . She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window . I was sweeping the hearth , and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips . Isabella , absorbed in her meditations , or a book , remained till the door opened , and it was too late to attempt an escape , which she would gladly have done had it been practicable . "
44629	44643	44395	44395	you	56	" exclaimed the mistress , gaily , pulling a chair to the fire . "
44760	44778	44755	44755	you	43	" she continued , arresting , with feigned playfulness , the confounded girl who had risen indignantly . "
44854	44855	44856	44856	Catherine	56	" "
44858	44879	44856	44856	Catherine	56	" said Isabella , calling up her dignity , and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her . "
44935	44972	44913	44913	she	1031	" As the guest answered nothing , but took his seat , and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him , she turned , and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor . "
44977	44984	44913	44913	she	1031	" cried Mrs. Linton in answer . "
45087	45088	45089	45089	I	0	" "
45095	45106	45091	45091	you	43	" said Heathcliff , twisting his chair to face them . "
45121	45255	45107	45107	She	1031	" And he stared hard at the object of discourse , as one might do at a strange repulsive animal , a centipede from the Indies , for instance , which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises . The poor thing could n't bear that ; she grew white and red in rapid succession , and , while tears beaded her lashes , bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine , and perceiving that , as fast as she raised one finger off her arm , another closed down , and she could not remove the whole together , she began to make use of her nails , and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer 's with crescents of red . "
45261	45277	45107	45107	She	1031	" exclaimed Mrs. Linton , setting her free , and shaking her hand with pain . "

45699	46285	45681	45681	she	82	" From their tongues , they did dismiss it ; and Catherine , probably , from her thoughts . The other , I felt certain , recalled it often in the course of the evening ; I saw him smile to himself — grin rather — and lapse into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment . I determined to watch his movements . My heart invariably cleaved to the master 's , in preference to Catherine 's side ; with reason , I imagined , for he was kind , and trustful , and honourable : and she — she could not be called the opposite , yet , she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude , that I had little faith in her principles , and still less sympathy for her feelings . I wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff , quietly , leaving us as we had been prior to his advent . His visits were a continual nightmare to me ; and , I suspected , to my master also . His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining . I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings , and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold , waiting his time to spring and destroy . Sometimes , while meditating on these things in solitude , I 've got up in a sudden terror , and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm ; I 've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways ; and then I 've recollected his confirmed bad habits , and , hopeless of benefiting him , have flinched from re - entering the dismal house , doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word . One time , I passed the old gate , going out of my way , on a journey to Gimmerton . It was about the period that my narrative has reached — a bright , frosty afternoon ; the ground bare , and the road hard and dry . I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand ; a rough sand - pillar , with the letters W. H. cut on its north side , on the east , G. , and on the south - west , T. G. It serves as guide - post to the Grange , and Heights , and village . The sun shone yellow on its grey head , reminding me of summer ; and I can not say why , but all at once , a gush of child 's sensations flowed into my heart . Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before . I gazed long at the weather - worn block ; and , stooping down , perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail - shells and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things — and , as fresh as reality , it appeared that I beheld my early play - mate seated on the withered turf ; his dark , square head bent forward , and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate . "
46289	46454	46286	46287	Poor Hindley	115	" I exclaimed , involuntarily . I started — my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine ! It vanished in a twinkling ; but , immediately , I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights . Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse — supposing he should be dead ! I thought — or should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death ! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew : and on catching sight of it , I trembled every limb . The apparition had outstripped me ; it stood looking through the gate . That was my first idea on observing an elf - locked , brown - eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars . Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton , my Hareton , not altered greatly since I left him , ten months since . "
46461	46471	46457	46457	thee	1043	" I cried , forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears . "
46483	46499	46478	46478	Nelly	80	" He retreated out of arm 's length , and picked up a large flint . "
46510	46675	46508	46508	Hareton	47	" I added , guessing from the action that Nelly , if she lived in his memory at all , was not recognised as one with me . He raised his missile to hurl it ; I commenced a soothing speech , but could not stay his hand . The stone struck my bonnet , and then ensued , from the stammering lips of the little fellow , a string of curses which , whether he comprehended them or not , were delivered with practised emphasis , and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity . You may be certain this grieved , more than angered me . Fit to cry , I took an orange from my pocket , and offered it to propitiate him . He hesitated , and then snatched it from my hold , as if he fancied I only intended to tempt , and disappoint him . I showed another keeping it out of his reach . "
46687	46691	46692	46693	The curate	2848	" I inquired . "
46695	46696	46692	46693	The curate	2848	" "
46708	46712	46705	46705	me	0	" he replied . "
46727	46730	46722	46722	you	1047	" said I. "
46735	46736	46737	46738	Devil daddy	1054	" "
46740	46745	46737	46738	Devil daddy	1054	" was his answer . "
46754	46769	46752	46752	Daddy	116	" I continued . He jumped at the fruit ; I raised it higher . "
46776	46780	46772	46772	he	1054	" I asked . "
46783	46787	46772	46772	he	1054	" said he , "
46808	46809	46803	46803	I	0	" "
46822	46826	46813	46814	the devil	2631	" I observed . "
46831	46835	46813	46814	the devil	2631	" he drawled . "
46839	46840	46841	46841	Heathcliff	43	" "
46843	46844	46841	46841	Heathcliff	43	" "
46853	46856	46857	46857	he	1047	" Aye ! "
46906	46907	46897	46897	He	43	" "
46922	46926	46909	46910	the curate	2848	" I pursued . "
46962	47305	47306	47306	Judas	118	" I put the orange in his hand ; and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean , was waiting to speak with him , by the garden gate . He went up the walk , and entered the house ; but , instead of Hindley , Heathcliff appeared on the door stones , and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race , making no halt till I gained the guide post , and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin . This is not much connected with Miss Isabella 's affair ; except , that it urged me to resolve further , on mounting vigilant guard , and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange , even though I should wake a domestic storm , by thwarting Mrs. Linton 's pleasure . The next time Heathcliff came , my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court . She had never spoken a word to her sister - in - law , for three days ; but , she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining , and we found it a great comfort . Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton , I knew . Now , as soon as he beheld her , his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house - front . I was standing by the kitchen window , but I drew out of sight . He then stept across the pavement to her , and said something : she seemed embarrassed , and desirous of getting away ; to prevent it , he laid his hand on her arm : she averted her face ; he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer . There was another rapid glance at the house , and supposing himself unseen , the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her . "
47310	47313	47316	47317	a hypocrite	983	" I ejaculated "
47327	47328	47323	47325	A deliberate deceiver	1061	" "
47333	47358	47331	47331	Nelly	80	" said Catherine 's voice at my elbow — I had been over - intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance . "
47363	47368	47359	47361	Your worthless friend	1062	" I answered warmly , "
47416	47483	47409	47409	he	1062	" Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free , and run into the garden ; and a minute after , Heathcliff opened the door . I could n't withhold giving some loose to my indignation ; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence , and threatened to order me out of the kitchen , if I dared be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue . "
47496	47500	47488	47488	people	445	" She cried . "
47550	47551	47542	47542	Linton	56	" "
47559	47571	47542	47542	Linton	56	" answered the black villain — I detested him just then . "
47590	47591	47581	47581	I	0	" "
47594	47602	47581	47581	I	0	" said Catherine shutting the inner door ! "
47623	47624	47616	47616	she	112	" "
47631	47635	47636	47636	I	0	" he growled , "
47668	47669	47670	47670	I	0	" "
47677	47736	47670	47670	I	0	" replied the mistress , I 'm jealous for you . Clear your face , you sha n't scowl at me ! If you like Isabella , you shall marry her . But , do you like her , tell the truth , Heathcliff ? There , you wo nt answer . I 'm certain you do n't ! "
47737	47750	47751	47751	I	0	" And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man ? "
47754	47760	47762	47763	my lady	1070	" Mr. Linton should approve , "
47766	47774	47776	47776	Heathcliff	43	" He might spare himself the trouble , "
47778	47922	47776	47776	Heathcliff	43	" I could do as well without his approbation — And , as to you , Catherine , I have a mind to speak a few words , now , while we are at it — I want you to be aware that I know you have treated me infernally — infernally ! Do you hear ? And , if you flatter yourself that I do n't perceive it you are a fool — and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot — and if you fancy I 'll suffer unrevenged , I 'll convince you of the contrary , in a very little while ! Meantime , thank you for telling me your sister - in - law 's secret — I swear I 'll make the most of it , and stand you aside ! "
47923	47933	47935	47936	Mrs. Linton	48	" What new phase of his character is this ? "
47941	47970	47935	47936	Mrs. Linton	48	" I 've treated you infernally — and you 'll take revenge ! How will you take it , ungrateful brute ? How have I treated you infernally ? "
47971	47979	47981	47981	Heathcliff	43	" I seek no revenge on you , "
47985	48092	47981	47981	Heathcliff	43	" That 's not the plan — The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they do n't turn against him , they crush those beneath them — You are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement , only , allow me me to amuse myself a little in the same style — And refrain from insult , as much as you are able . Having levelled my palace , do n't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home . If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabella , I 'd cut my throat ! "
48093	48107	48109	48109	Catherine	56	" Oh the evil is that I am not jealous , is it ? "
48111	48221	48109	48109	Catherine	56	" Well , I wo n't repeat my offer of a wife — It is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul — Your bliss lies , like his , in inflicting misery — You prove it — Edgar is restored from the ill - temper he gave way to at your coming ; I begin to be secure and tranquil ; and , you , restless to know us at peace , appear resolved on exciting a quarrel — quarrel with Edgar if you please , Heathcliff , and deceive his sister ; you 'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me . "
48292	48295	48297	48297	he	1071	" Ellen , "
48303	48310	48297	48297	he	1071	" have you seen your mistress ? "
48311	48322	48323	48323	I	0	" Yes , she 's in the kitchen , sir , "
48326	48371	48323	48323	I	0	" She 's sadly put out by Mr. Heathcliff 's behaviour : and , indeed , I do think it 's time to arrange his visits on another footing . There 's harm in being too soft , and now it 's come to this—. "
48447	48452	48453	48453	he	81	" This is insufferable ! "
48456	48505	48453	48453	he	81	" It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend , and force his company on me ! Call me two men out of the hall , Ellen — Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian — I have humoured her enough . "
48599	48604	48606	48606	Linton	48	" How is this ? "
48611	48672	48606	48606	Linton	48	" what notion of propriety must you have to remain here , after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard ? I suppose , because it is his ordinary talk , you think nothing of it — you are habituated to his baseness , and , perhaps , imagine I can get used to it too ! "
48673	48684	48686	48687	the mistress	429	" Have you been listening at the door , Edgar ? "
48761	48773	48774	48774	he	81	" I have been so far forbearing with you , sir , "
48779	48878	48774	48774	he	81	" not that I was ignorant of your miserable , degraded character , but , I felt you were only partly responsible for that ; and Catherine , wishing to keep up your acquaintance , I acquiesced — foolishly . Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous — for that cause , and to prevent worse consequences , I shall deny you , hereafter , admission into this house , and give notice , now , that I require your instant departure . Three minutes ' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious . "
48895	48907	48908	48908	he	43	" Cathy , this lamb of yours threatens like a bull ! "
48911	48942	48908	48908	he	43	" It is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles . By God , Mr. Linton , I 'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down ! "
49003	49007	49008	49008	she	48	" Fair means ! "
49022	49140	49008	49008	she	48	" If you have not the courage to attack him , make an apology , or allow yourself to be beaten . It will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess . No , I 'll swallow the key before you shall get it ! I 'm delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each ! After constant indulgence of one 's weak nature , and the other 's bad one , I earn , for thanks , two samples of blind ingratitude , stupid to absurdity ! Edgar , I was defending you , and yours ; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick , for daring to think an evil thought of me ! "
49234	49248	49250	49251	Mrs. Linton	48	" Oh ! Heavens ! In old days this would win you knighthood ! "
49253	49305	49250	49251	Mrs. Linton	48	" We are vanquished , we are vanquished ! Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice . Cheer up , you sha'n't be hurt ! Your type is not a lamb , it 's a sucking leveret . "
49306	49320	49322	49323	her friend	2906	" I wish you joy of the milk - blooded coward , Cathy ! "
49325	49382	49383	49384	The fellow	236	" I compliment you on your taste : and that is the slavering , shivering thing you preferred to me ! I would not strike him with my fist , but I 'd kick him with my foot , and experience considerable satisfaction . Is he weeping , or is he going to faint for fear ? "
49463	49473	49475	49475	Catherine	56	" There ! you 've done with coming here , "
49477	49541	49475	49475	Catherine	56	" Get away , now — he'll return with a brace of pistols , and half - a - dozen assistants . If he did overhear us , of course , he 'd never forgive you . You 've played me an ill turn , Heathcliff ! But , go — make haste ! I 'd rather see Edgar at bay than you . "
49542	49557	49558	49558	he	1095	" Do you suppose I 'm going with that blow burning in my gullet ? "
49561	49614	49558	49558	he	1095	" By Hell , no ! I 'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel - nut , before I cross the threshold ! If I do n't floor him now , I shall murder him sometime , so , as you value his existence , let me get at him ! "
49615	49621	49622	49622	I	0	" He is not coming . "
49632	49683	49622	49622	I	0	" There 's the coachman , and the two gardeners ; you 'll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them ! Each has a bludgeon , and master will , very likely , be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders . "
49778	49786	49787	49787	she	48	" I 'm nearly distracted , Nelly ! "
49796	50208	49787	49787	she	48	" A thousand smiths ' hammers are beating in my head ! Tell Isabella to shun me — this uproar is owing to her ; and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present , I shall get wild . And , Nelly , say to Edgar , if you see him again to - night , that I 'm in danger of being seriously ill — I wish it may prove true . He has startled and distressed me shockingly ! I want to frighten him . Besides , he might come and begin a string of abuse , or complainings ; I 'm certain I should recriminate , and God knows where we should end ! Will you do so , my good Nelly ? You are aware that I am no way blameable in this matter . What possessed him to turn listener ? Heathcliff 's talk was outrageous , after you left us ; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella , and the rest meant nothing . Now , all is dashed wrong by the fool 's craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon ! Had Edgar never gathered our conversation , he would never have been the worse for it . Really , when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure , after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him ; I did not care , hardly , what they did to each other , especially as I felt that , however the scene closed , we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long ! Well , if I can not keep Heathcliff for my friend — if Edgar will be mean and jealous , I 'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own . That will be a prompt way of finishing all , when I am pushed to extremity ! But it 's a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope — I'd not take Linton by surprise with it . To this this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me ; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy ; and remind him of my passionate temper , verging , when kindled , on frenzy — I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance , and look rather more anxious about me ! "
50277	50279	50284	50284	she	1101	" frighten "
50337	50362	50331	50331	He	430	" Remain where you are , Catherine , ' he said , without any anger in his voice , but with much sorrowful despondency . "
50401	50402	50393	50393	you	0	" "
50410	50419	50393	50393	you	0	" interrupted the mistress , stamping her foot , "
50469	50470	50478	50478	my	0	" "
50481	50486	50487	50487	You	0	" persevered Mr. Linton . "
50558	50559	50560	50560	I	0	" "
50567	50573	50574	50574	I	0	" exclaimed Catherine , furiously . "
50595	50742	50587	50587	Edgar	91	" She rung the bell till it broke with a twang : I entered leisurely . It was enough to try the temper of a saint , such senseless , wicked rages ! There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa , and grinding her teeth , so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters ! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear . He told me to fetch some water . She had no breath for speaking . I brought a glass full ; and , as she would not drink , I sprinkled it on her face . In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff , and turned up her eyes , while her cheeks , at once blanched and livid , assumed the aspect of death . Linton looked terrified . "
50752	50775	50587	50587	Edgar	91	" I whispered . I did not want him to yield , though I could not help being afraid in my heart . "
50783	50789	50776	50776	She	1110	" he said , shuddering . "
50793	50939	50776	50776	She	1110	" I answered , tartly . And I told him how she had resolved , previous to his coming , on exhibiting a fit of frenzy . I incautiously gave the account aloud , and she heard me , for she started up — her hair flying over her shoulders , her eyes flashing , the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally . I made up my mind for broken bones , at least ; but she only glared about her , for an instant , and then rushed from the room . The master directed me to follow ; I did , to her chamber door ; she hindered me from going farther by securing it against me . As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning , I went to ask whether she would have some carried up . "
50942	51385	50776	50776	She	1110	" she replied , peremptorily . The same question was repeated at dinner , and tea ; and again on the morrow after , and received the same answer . Mr. Linton , on his part , spent his time in the library , and did not inquire concerning his wife 's occupations . Isabella and he had had an hour 's interview , during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff 's advances ; but he could make nothing of her evasive replies , and was obliged to close the examination , unsatisfactorily ; adding , however , a solemn warning , that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor , it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him . While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden , always silent , and almost always in tears ; and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened ; wearying , I guessed , with a continual vague expectation that Catherine , repenting her conduct , would come of her own accord to ask pardon , and seek a reconciliation ; and she fasted pertinaciously , under the idea , probably , that at every meal , Edgar was ready to choke for her absence , and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet ; I went about my household duties , convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls , and that lodged in my body . I wasted no condolences on miss , nor any expostulations on my mistress , nor did I pay attention to the sighs of my master who yearned to hear his lady 's name , since he might not hear her voice . I determined they should come about as they pleased for me ; and though it was a tiresomely slow process , I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress , as I thought at first . Mrs. Linton , on the third day , unbarred her door ; and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter , desired a renewed supply , and a basin of gruel , for she believed she was dying . That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar 's ears , I believed no such thing , so I kept it to myself , and brought her some tea and dry toast . She eat and drank eagerly ; and sank back on her pillow again clenching her hands and groaning . "
51392	51396	51388	51388	I	0	" she exclaimed , "
51413	51424	51407	51407	I	0	" Then a good while after I heard her murmur , "
51450	51451	51432	51432	he'd	1112	" "
51459	51481	51453	51453	you	0	" I enquired , still preserving my external composure , in spite of her ghastly countenance , and strange exaggerated manner . "
51489	51503	51453	51453	you	0	" she demanded , pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face . "
51516	51517	51453	51453	you	0	" "
51520	51524	51526	51526	you	0	" replied I ; "
51564	51598	51550	51550	he	1112	" I should not have spoken so , if I had known her true condition , but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder . "
51603	51609	51550	51550	he	1112	" she cried , confounded . "
51633	51651	51626	51626	he	1112	" continued she , staring at her reflection in a mirror , hanging against the opposite wall . "
51753	51754	51744	51744	he	1112	" "
51759	51763	51764	51765	the master	430	" I answered , "
51792	51793	51794	51794	You	1116	" "
51806	51810	51800	51800	you	1116	" she returned ; "
51827	51828	51821	51821	you	3167	" "
51837	51841	51831	51831	you	3167	" I suggested , "
51865	51866	51834	51835	Mrs. Linton	48	" "
51877	51881	51868	51868	I	0	" she interrupted , "
52057	52237	52046	52046	he	91	" She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton 's philosophical resignation . Tossing about , she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness , and tore the pillow with her teeth , then raising herself up all burning , desired that I would open the window . We were in the middle of winter , the wind blew strong from the north - east , and I objected . Both the expressions flitting over her face , and the changes of her moods , began to alarm me terribly ; and brought to my recollection her former illness , and the doctor 's injunction that she should not be crossed . A minute previously she was violent ; now , supported on one arm , and not noticing my refusal to obey her , she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made , and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species : her mind had strayed to other associations . "
52244	52250	52046	52046	he	91	" she murmured to herself ; "
52449	52450	52446	52446	me	0	" "
52459	52485	52430	52430	he	43	" I interrupted , dragging the pillow away , and turning the holes towards the mattress , for she was removing its contents by handfuls . "
52510	52519	52520	52520	I	0	" I went here and there collecting it . "
52527	52533	52534	52536	an aged woman	1133	" she continued , dreamily , "
52658	52667	52668	52668	I	0	" The black press ? where is that ? "
52671	52679	52668	52668	I	0	" You are talking in your sleep ! "
52680	52692	52693	52693	she	80	" It 's against the wall , as it always is , "
52696	52709	52693	52693	she	80	" It does appear odd — I see a face in it ! "
52710	52723	52725	52725	I	0	" There is no press in the room , and never was , "
52742	52750	52751	52751	she	80	" Do n't you see that face ? "
52789	52796	52797	52797	she	80	" It 's behind there still ! "
52802	52811	52797	52797	she	80	" And it stirred . Who is it ? "
52840	52874	52833	52833	I	0	" I took her hand in mine , and bid her be composed , for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame , and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass . "
52880	52884	52833	52833	I	0	" I insisted . "
52899	52900	52901	52901	Myself	0	" "
52903	52907	52901	52901	Myself	0	" she gasped , "
52924	52971	52998	52999	Mrs. Linton	48	" Her fingers clutched the clothes , and gathered them over her eyes . I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband ; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek . The shawl had dropped from the frame . "
52978	52981	52998	52999	Mrs. Linton	48	" cried I. "
53017	53046	53011	53011	I	0	" Trembling and bewildered , she held me fast , but the horror gradually passed from her countenance ; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame . "
53058	53062	53063	53063	I	0	" she sighed . "
53109	53110	53100	53100	I	0	" "
53121	53125	53116	53116	you	0	" I answered ; "
53138	53139	53127	53127	I	0	" "
53155	53165	53127	53127	I	0	" she went on bitterly , wringing her hands . "
53197	53260	53127	53127	I	0	" To pacify her , I held the casement ajar , a few seconds . A cold blast rushed through , I closed it , and returned to my post . She lay still , now : her face bathed in tears — Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit ; our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child ! "
53272	53278	53266	53266	I	0	" she asked suddenly reviving . "
53284	53288	53266	53266	I	0	" I replied , "
53303	53304	53266	53266	I	0	" "
53312	53316	53266	53266	I	0	" she exclaimed . "
53322	53323	53266	53266	I	0	" "
53339	53342	53266	53266	I	0	" observed I. "
53353	53358	53377	53377	Edgar	91	" she muttered doubtfully , "
53947	53948	53951	53951	I	0	" "
53961	53965	53951	53951	I	0	" I answered . "
53979	53984	53976	53976	you	0	" she said sullenly . "
53999	54134	53997	53997	myself	0	" And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her , she crossed the room , walking very uncertainly , threw it back , and bent out , careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife . I entreated , and finally attempted to force her to retire . But I soon found her delirious strengh much surpassed mine ; ( she was delirious I became convinced by her subsequent actions , and ravings . ) There was no moon , and every thing beneath lay in misty darkness ; not a light gleamed from any house , far or near ; all had been extinguished long ago ; and those at Wuthering Heights were never visible . . .still she asserted she caught their shining . "
54137	54142	53997	53997	myself	0	" she cried eagerly , "
54320	54331	54332	54332	He	1170	" She paused , and resumed with a strange smile , "
54369	54471	54364	54364	you	43	" Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity , I was planning how I could reach something to wrap about her , without quitting my hold of herself , for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice ; when to my consternation , I heard the rattle of the door - handle , and Mr. Linton entered . He had only then come from the library ; and , in passing through the lobby , had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity , or fear to examine what it signified , at that late hour . "
54476	54502	54364	54364	you	43	" I cried , checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him , and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber . "
54550	54551	54539	54539	she	1173	" "
54555	54562	54539	54539	she	1173	" he said hastening to us . "
54575	54604	54569	54569	Catherine	56	" He was silent ; the haggardness of Mrs. Linton 's appearance smote him speechless , and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment . "
54611	54615	54605	54605	She	1173	" I continued , "
54655	54661	54662	54662	I	0	" but it is nothing . "
54674	54684	54685	54685	he	430	" It is nothing is it , Ellen Dean ? "
54689	54702	54685	54685	he	430	" You shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this ! "
54775	54788	54789	54789	she	2670	" Ah ! you are come , are you , Edgar Linton ? "
54796	54905	54789	54789	she	2670	."You are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted , and when you are wanted never ! I suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations , now . . .I see we shall . . .but they ca n't keep me from my narrow home out yonder — My resting place where I 'm bound before Spring is over ! There it is , not among the Lintons , mind , under the chapel - roof ; but in the open air with a head - stone , and you may please yourself , whether you go to them , or come to me ! "
54906	54914	54916	54917	the master	430	" Catherine , what have you done ? "
54919	54937	54789	54789	she	2670	" Am I nothing to you , any more ? Do you love that wretch , Heath — "
54938	54941	54943	54944	Mrs. Linton	48	" Hush ! "
54946	55036	54943	54944	Mrs. Linton	48	" Hush , this moment ! You mention that name and I end the matter , instantly , by a spring from the window ! What you touch at present , you may have ; but my soul will be on that hill - top before you lay hands on me again . I do n't want you , Edgar ; I 'm past wanting you . . .Return to your books . . .I'm glad you possess a consolation , for all you had in me is gone . "
55037	55044	55045	55045	I	0	" Her mind wanders , sir , "
55048	55085	55045	55045	I	0	" She has been talking nonsense the whole evening ; but , let her have quiet and proper attendance , and she 'll rally . . .Hereafter , we must be cautious how we vex her . "
55086	55095	55097	55098	Mr. Linton	73	" I desire no further advice from you , "
55100	55146	55147	55147	I	0	" You knew your mistress 's nature , and you encouraged me to harass her . And not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days ! It was heartless ! months of sickness could not cause such a change ! "
55166	55179	55181	55181	I	0	" I knew Mrs. Linton 's nature to be headstrong and domineering , "
55183	55258	55181	55181	I	0	" but I did n't know that you wished to foster her fierce temper ! I did n't know that , to humour her , I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff . I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you , and I have got a faithful servant 's wages ! Well , it will teach me to be careful next time . Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself ! "
55259	55279	55280	55280	he	1180	" The next time you bring a tale to me , you shall quit my service , Ellen Dean , "
55283	55300	55302	55302	I.	1181	" You 'd rather hear nothing about it , I suppose , then , Mr. Linton ? "
55303	55334	55302	55302	I.	1181	" Heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to Miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers , on purpose to poison the mistress against you ? "
55349	55357	55358	55358	she	56	" Ah ! Nelly has played traitor , "
55363	55403	55358	55358	she	56	" Nelly is my hidden enemy — you witch ! So you do seek elf - bolts to hurt us ! Let me go , and I 'll make her rue ! I 'll make her howl a recantation ! "
55744	55748	55750	55750	he	92	" Nelly Dean , "
55752	55825	55750	55750	he	92	" I ca n't help fancying there 's an extra cause for this . What has there been to do at the Grange ? We 've odd reports up here . A stout , hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a trifle ; and that sort of people should not either . It 's hard work bringing them through fevers , and such things . How did it begin ? "
55826	55833	55834	55834	I	0	" The master will inform you , "
55837	55943	55834	55834	I	0	" but you are acquainted with the Earnshaw 's violent dispositions , and Mrs. Linton caps them all . I may say this ; it commenced in a quarrel . She was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit . That 's her account , at least ; for she flew off in the height of it , and locked herself up . Afterwards , she refused to eat , and now she alternately raves , and remains in a half dream , knowing those about her , but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions . "
55944	55951	55953	55953	Kenneth	92	" Mr. Linton will be sorry ? "
55957	55969	55970	55970	I	0	" Sorry ? he 'll break his heart should anything happen ! "
55973	55982	55970	55970	I	0	" Do n't alarm him more than necessary . "
55983	55992	55994	55995	my companion	350	" Well , I told him to beware , "
55997	56019	55994	55995	my companion	350	" and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning ! Has n't he been thick with Mr. Heathcliff lately ? "
56020	56028	56030	56030	I	0	" Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange , "
56032	56090	56030	56030	I	0	" though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy , than because the master likes his company . At present , he 's discharged from the trouble of calling ; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested . I hardly think he 'll be taken in again . "
56091	56103	56105	56106	the doctor	528	" And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him ? "
56111	56119	56121	56121	I	0	" I 'm not in her confidence , "
56129	56138	56139	56139	he	528	" No , she 's a sly one , "
56146	56264	56143	56143	his	528	" She keeps her own counsel ! But she 's a real little fool . I have it from good authority , that , last night , and a pretty night it was ! she and Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house , above two hours ; and he pressed her not to go in again , but just mount his horse and away with him ! My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that , when it was to be , he did n't hear , but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp ! "
56744	56765	56708	56711	One of the maids	1219	" Oh , dear , dear ! What mun we have next ? Master , master , our young lady — "
56766	56771	56773	56773	I	0	" Hold your noise ! "
56782	56793	56795	56796	Mr. Linton	73	" Speak lower , Mary — What is the matter ? "
56798	56805	56795	56796	Mr. Linton	73	" What ails your young lady ? "
56806	56825	56827	56828	the girl	739	" She 's gone , she 's gone ! Yon ' Heathcliff 's run off wi ' her ! "
56830	56836	56838	56838	Linton	73	" That is not true ! "
56844	56875	56877	56877	he	73	" It can not be — how has the idea entered your head ? Ellen Dean , go and seek her — it is incredible — it can not be . "
56903	56918	56919	56919	she	2711	" Why , I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here , "
56922	56964	56919	56919	she	2711	" and he asked whether we wern't in trouble at the Grange — I thought he meant for Missis 's sickness , so I answered , yes . Then says he , they 's somebody gone after 'em , I guess ? "
57144	57212	57135	57135	she	1238	" I ran and peeped , for form 's sake into Isabella 's room : confirming , when I returned , the servant 's statement — Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed ; on my re - entrance , he raised his eyes , read the meaning of my blank aspect , and dropped them without giving an order , or uttering a word . "
57226	57230	57135	57135	she	1238	" I inquired . "
57236	57237	57238	57238	She	1238	" "
57245	57250	57258	57258	she	1238	" answered the master ; "
57290	57586	57285	57285	she	1238	" And that was all he said on the subject ; he did not make a single inquiry further , or mention her in any way , except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home , wherever it was , when I knew it . For two months the fugitives remained absent , in those two months , Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever . No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her . Day and night , he was watching , and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict : and , though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety , in fact , that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity , he knew no limits in gratitude and joy , when Catherine 's life was declared out of danger ; and hour after hour , he would sit beside her , tracing the gradual return to bodily health , and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also , and she would soon be entirely her former self . The first time she left her chamber , was at the commencement of the following March . Mr. Linton had put on her pillow , in the morning , a handful of golden crocuses ; her eye , long stranger to any gleam of pleasure , caught them in waking , and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together . "
57596	57600	57285	57285	she	1238	" she exclaimed . "
57635	57636	57618	57618	Edgar	81	" "
57648	57653	57646	57646	darling	344	" replied her husband , "
57735	57736	57727	57727	I	0	" "
57747	57752	57755	57755	you	56	" said the invalid ; "
57795	58261	57782	57782	you	56	" Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses , and tried to cheer her by the fondest words ; but vaguely regarding the flowers , she let the tears collect on her lashes , and stream down her cheeks unheeding . We knew she was really better , and therefore , decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency , and it might be partially removed by a change of scene . The master told me to light a fire in the many - week 's deserted parlour , and to set an easy - chair in the sunshine by the window ; and then he brought her down , and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat , and , as we expected , revived by the objects round her , which , though familiar , were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick - chamber . By evening , she seemed greatly exhausted ; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment , and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed , till another room could be prepared . To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs , we fitted up this , where you lie at present ; on the same floor with the parlour : and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other , leaning on Edgar 's arm . Ah , I thought myself , she might recover , so waited on as she was . And there was double cause to desire it , for on her existence depended that of another ; we cherished the hope that in a little while , Mr. Linton 's heart would be gladdened , and his lands secured from a stranger 's gripe , by the birth of an heir . I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother , some six weeks from her departure a short note , announcing her marriage with Heathcliff . It appeared dry and cold ; but at the bottom , was dotted in with pencil , an obscure apology , and an entreaty for kind remembrance , and reconciliation , if her proceeding had offended him ; asserting that she could not help it then , and being done , she had now no power to repeal it . Linton did not reply to this , I believe ; and , in a fortnight more , I got a long letter which I considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon . I 'll read it , for I keep it yet . Any relic of the dead is precious , if they were valued living . "
58265	58269	58262	58263	Dear Ellen	80	" it begins . "
58912	58920	58921	58921	I	0	" This is Edgar 's legal nephew , "
58922	58953	58954	58954	I	0	reflected—"mine in a manner ; I must shake hands , and — yes — I must kiss him . It is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning . "
58968	58977	58978	58978	He	1275	" How do you do , my dear ? "
58988	58998	59014	59014	Throttler	123	" Shall you and I be friends , Hareton ? "

59128	59157	59123	59123	his	45	" Mim ! mim ! mim ! Did iver Christian body hear owt like it ? Minching un ' munching ! Hah can Aw tell whet ye say ? "
59158	59173	59174	59174	I	0	" I say , I wish you to come with me into the house ! "
59188	59200	59201	59201	he	45	" Nor nuh me ! Aw getten summut else to do , "
59339	59346	59347	59347	he	45	" What 's your business here ? "
59352	59357	59347	59347	he	45	" Who are you ? "
59358	59365	59366	59366	I	0	" My name was Isabella Linton , "
59369	59399	59366	59366	I	0	" You 've seen me before , sir . I 'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff ; and he has brought me here — I suppose by your permission . "
59400	59408	59410	59411	the hermit	1282	" Is he come back , then ? "
59419	59427	59428	59428	I	0	" Yes — we came just now , "
59431	59471	59428	59428	I	0	" but he left me by the kitchen door ; and when I would have gone in , your little boy played sentinel over the place , and frightened me off by the help of a bull - dog . "
59472	59484	59503	59503	he	1283	" It 's well the hellish villain has kept his word ! "
59521	59523	59555	59555	he	1283	" fiend "
59689	59977	59682	59682	I	0	" You 'll not be surprised , Ellen , at my feeling particularly cheerless , seated in worse than solitude , on that inhospitable hearth , and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home , containing the only people I loved on earth : and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us , instead of those four miles , I could not overpass them ! I questioned with myself — where must I turn for comfort ? and — mind you do n't tell Edgar , or Catherine — above every sorrow beside , this rose pre - eminent — despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against Heathcliff ! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights , almost gladly , because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him ; but he knew the people we were coming amongst , and he did not fear their intermeddling . I sat and thought a doleful time ; the clock struck eight , and nine , and still my companion paced to and fro , his head bent on his breast , and perfectly silent , unless a groan , or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals . I listened to detect a woman 's voice in the house , and filled the interim with wild regrets , and dismal anticipations , which , at last , spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing , and weeping . I was not aware how openly I grieved , till Earnshaw halted opposite , in his measured walk , and gave me a stare of newly awakened surprise . Taking advantage of his recovered attention , I exclaimed — "
60014	60015	60016	60016	We	1289	" "
60020	60024	60016	60016	We	1289	" he answered ; "
60031	60032	60016	60016	We	1289	" "
60040	60067	60069	60069	he	1290	" I sobbed — I was beyond regarding self - respect , weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness . Joseph will show you Heathcliff 's chamber , "

60082	60102	60016	60016	We	1289	" I was going to obey , but he suddenly arrested me , and added in the strangest tone — "

60125	60129	60016	60016	We	1289	" I said . "
60136	60151	60133	60134	Mr. Earnshaw	75	" I did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff . "
60155	60179	60133	60134	Mr. Earnshaw	75	" he replied , pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol , having a double edged spring knife attached to the barrel . "
60368	60378	60380	60380	he	1290	" I do n't care if you tell him , "

62709	62782	62707	62707	ISABELLA	82	" As soon as I had perused this epistle , I went to the master , and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights , and sent me a a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton 's situation , and her ardent desire to see him ; with a wish that he would transmit to her , as early as possible , some token of forgiveness by me . "
62785	62789	62707	62707	ISABELLA	82	" said Linton . "
62881	62882	62884	62884	you	0	" "
62895	62901	62884	62884	you	0	" I asked , imploringly . "
62904	62908	62884	62884	you	0	" he answered . "
62933	63304	63306	63306	you	1344	" Mr. Edgar 's coldness depressed me exceedingly ; and all the way from the Grange , I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said , when I repeated it ; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella . I dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning : I saw her looking through the lattice , as I came up the garden causeway and I nodded to her ; but she drew back , as if afraid of being observed . I entered without knocking . There never was such a dreary , dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented ! I must confess that , if I had been in the young lady 's place , I would , at least , have swept the hearth , and wiped the tables with a duster . But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her . Her pretty face was wan and listless ; her hair uncurled ; some locks hanging lankly down , and some carelessly twisted round her head . Probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening . Hindley was not there . Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table , turning over some papers in his pocket - book ; but he rose when I appeared , asked me how I did , quite friendly , and offered me a chair . He was the only thing there that seemed decent , and I thought he never looked better . So much had circumstances altered their positions , that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman , and his wife as a thorough little slattern ! She came forward eagerly to greet me ; and held out one hand to take the expected letter . I shook my head . She would n't understand the hint , but followed me to a sideboard , where I went to lay my bonnet , and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought . Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manœuvres , and said — "
63342	63343	63326	63326	You	1344	" "
63350	63364	63326	63326	You	1344	" I replied , thinking it best to speak the truth at once . "
63553	63561	63562	63562	I	0	" Mrs Linton is now just recovering , "
63565	63697	63562	63562	I	0	" she 'll never be like she was , but her life is spared , and if you really have a regard for her , you 'll shun crossing her way again . Nay you 'll move out of this country entirely ; and that you may not regret it , I 'll inform you Catherine Linton is as different now , from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw , as that young lady is different from me ! Her appearance is changed greatly , her character much more so ; and the person , who is compelled , of necessity , to be her companion , will only sustain his affection hereafter , by the remembrance of what she once was , by common humanity , and a sense of duty ! "
63698	63704	63706	63706	Heathcliff	43	" That is quite possible , "
63713	63802	63708	63708	himself	43	" quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity , and a sense of duty to fall back upon . But do you imagine that I shall leave Catherine to his duty and humanity ? and can you compare my feelings respecting Catherine , to his ? Before you leave this house , I must exact a promise from you , that you 'll get me an interview with her — consent , or refuse , I will see her ! What do you say ? "
63803	63809	63810	63810	I	0	" I say Mr. Heathcliff , "
63813	63838	63810	63810	I	0	" you must not — you never shall through my means . Another encounter between you and the master , would kill her altogether ! "
63839	63848	63849	63849	he	1355	" With your aid that may be avoided ; "
63852	64046	63849	63849	he	1355	" and should there be danger of such an event — should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence — Why , I think , I shall be justified in going to extremes ! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss . The fear that she would restrains me : and there you see the distinction between our feelings — Had he been in my place , and I in his , though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall , I never would have raised a hand against him . You may look incredulous , if you please ! I never would have banished him from her society , as long as she desired his . The moment her regard ceased , I would have torn his heart out , and drank his blood ! But , till then , if you do n't believe me , you do n't know me — till then , I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head ! "
64047	64098	64242	64242	she	1358	" And yet , I interrupted , you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration , by thrusting yourself in to her remembrance , now , when she has nearly forgotten you , and involving her in a new tumult of discord , and distress . "
64099	64108	64109	64109	he	1356	" You suppose she has nearly forgotten me ? "
64112	64230	64109	64109	he	1356	" Oh Nelly ! you know she has not ! You know as well as I do , that for every thought she spends on Linton , she spends a thousand on me ! At a most miserable period of my life , I had a notion of the kind , it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood , last summer , but only her own assurance , could make me admit the horrible idea again . And then , Linton would be nothing , nor Hindley , nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt . Two words would comprehend my future death and hell — existence , after losing her would be hell . "
64354	64372	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other , as any two people can be ! "
64379	64402	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" No one has a right to talk in that manner , and I wo n't hear my brother depreciated in silence ! "
64403	64417	64419	64419	Heathcliff	43	" Your brother is wondrous fond of you too , is n't he ? "
64422	64434	64419	64419	Heathcliff	43	" He turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity . "
64435	64445	64446	64446	she	82	" He is not aware of what I suffer , "
64449	64457	64446	64446	she	82	" I did n't tell him that . "
64458	64475	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" You have been telling him something , then — you have written , have you ? "
64476	64493	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" To say that I was married , I did write — you saw the note . "
64494	64499	64446	64446	she	82	" And nothing since ? "
64500	64503	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" No . "
64504	64520	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" My young lady is looking sadly the worse , for her change of condition , "
64524	64550	64521	64521	I	0	" Somebody 's love comes short in her case , obviously — whose I may guess ; but , perhaps , I should n't say . "
64551	64560	64562	64562	Heathcliff	43	" I should guess it was her own , "
64564	64635	64562	64562	Heathcliff	43	" She degenerates into a mere slut ! She is tired of trying to please me , uncommonly early — You'd hardly credit it , but the very morrow of our wedding , she was weeping to go home . However , she 'll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice , and I 'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad . "
64636	64641	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" Well , sir ; "
64645	64758	64374	64374	Isabella	82	" I hope you 'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after , and waited on ; and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom every one was ready to serve — You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her , and you must treat her kindly — Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar , you can not doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she would n't have abandoned the elegancies , and comforts , and friends of her former home , to fix contentedly , in such a wilderness as this , with you . "
64759	64767	64768	64768	he	1360	" She abandoned them under a delusion ; "
64771	65323	64768	64768	he	1360	" picturing in me a hero of romance , and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion . I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature , so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character , and acting on the false impressions she cherished . But at last , I think she begins to know me — I do n't perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me , at first ; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation , and herself — It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her . I believed at one time , no lessons could teach her that ! aud yet it is poorly learnt ; for this morning she announced , as a piece of appalling intelligence , that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me ! A positive labour of Hercules , I assure you ! If it be achieved , I have cause to return thanks — Can I trust your assertion , Isabella , are you sure you hate me ? If I let you alone for half - a - day , wo n't you come sighing and wheedling to me again ? I dare say she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you ; it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed . But , I do n't care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side , and I never told her a lie about it . She can not accuse me of showing a bit of deceitful softness . The first thing she saw me do , on coming out of the Grange , was to hang up her little dog , and when she pleaded for it the first words I uttered , were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her , except one : possibly , she took that exception for herself — But no brutality disgusted her — I suppose , she has an innate admiration of it , if only her precious person were secure from injury ! Now , was it not the depth of absurdity — of genuine idiocy , for that pitiful slavish , mean - minded brach to dream that I could love her ? Tell your master , Nelly , that I never , in all my life , met with such an abject thing as she is — She even disgraces the name of Linton ; and I 've sometimes relented , from pure lack of invention , in my experiments on what she could endure , and still creep shamefully cringing back ! But tell him also , to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease , that I keep strictly within the limits of the law — I have avoided , up to this period , giving her the slightest right to claim a separation ; and what 's more , she 'd thank nobody for dividing us — if she desired to go she might — the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her ! "
65324	65328	65330	65330	I	0	" Mr. Heathcliff , "
65332	65405	65330	65330	I	0	" this is the talk of a madman , and your wife , most likely is convinced you are mad ; and , for that reason , she has borne with you hitherto : but now that you say she may go , she 'll doubtless avail herself of the permission — You are not so bewitched ma'am , are you , as to remain with him , of your own accord ? "
65406	65412	65414	65414	Isabella	82	" Take care , Ellen ! "
65442	65587	65330	65330	I	0	" Do n't put faith in a single word he speaks . He 's a lying fiend , a monster , and not a human being ! I 've been told I might leave him before ; and I 've made the attempt , but I dare not repeat it ! Only Ellen , promise you 'll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine — whatever he may pretend , he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation — he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him ; and he sha n't obtain it — I'll die first ! I just hope , I pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence , and kill me ! The single pleasure I can imagine is , is to die , or to see him dead ! "
65588	65598	65600	65600	Heathcliff	43	" There — that will do for the present ! "
65602	65719	65720	65720	He	1363	" If you are called upon in a court of law , you 'll remember her language , Nelly ! And take a good look at that countenance — she 's near the point which would suit me . No , you 're not fit to be your own guardian , Isabella now ; and I , being your legal protector , must retain you in my custody , however distasteful the obligation may be — Go up stairs ; I have something to say to Ellen Dean , in private . That 's not the way — up - stairs , I tell you ! Why this is the road up - stairs , child ! "
65734	65780	65720	65720	He	1363	" I have no pity ! I have no pity ! The worms writhe , the more I yearn to crush out their entrails ! It is a moral teething , and I grind with greater energy , in proportion to the increase of pain . "
65781	65791	65792	65792	I	0	" Do you understand what the word pity means ? "
65800	65813	65792	65792	I	0	" Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life ? "
65814	65819	65820	65820	he	1363	" Put that down ! "
65829	66079	65820	65820	he	1363	" You are not going yet — Come here now , Nelly — I must either persuade , or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine , and that without delay — I swear that I meditate no harm ; I do n't desire to cause any disturbance , or to exasperate , or insult Mr. Linton ; I only wish to hear from herself how she is , and why she has been ill ; and to ask , if anything that I could do would be of use to her . Last night , I was in the Grange garden six hours , and I 'll return there to - night ; and every night I 'll haunt the place , and every day , till I find an opportunity of entering . If Edgar Linton meets me , I shall not hesitate to knock him down , and give him enough to ensure his quiescence while I stay — If his servants oppose me , I shall threaten them off with these pistols — But would n't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them , or their master . And you could do it so easily ! I 'd warn you when I came , and then you might let me in unobserved , as soon as she was alone , and watch till I departed — your conscience quite calm , you would be hindering mischief . "
66115	66123	66124	66124	I	0	" The commonest occurrence startles her painfully , "
66127	66197	66199	66199	Heathcliff	43	" She 's all nerves , and she could n't bear the surprise , I 'm positive — Don't persist , sir ! or else , I shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs , and he 'll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions ! In that case , I 'll take measures to secure you , woman ! "
66201	66489	66199	66199	Heathcliff	43	" you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to - morrow morning . It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me ; and as to surprising her , I do n't desire it , you must prepare her — ask her if I may come . You say she never mentions my name , and that I am never mentioned to her . To whom should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the house ? She thinks you are all spies for her husband — Oh , I 've no doubt she 's in hell among you ! I guess , by her silence as much as any thing , what she feels . You say she is often restless , and anxious looking — is that a proof of tranquillity ? You talk of her mind , being unsettled — How the devil could it be otherwise , in her frightful isolation . And that insipid , paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity ! From pity and charity . He might as well plant an oak in a flower - pot , and expect it to thrive , as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares ! Let us settle it at once ; will you stay here , and am I to fight my way to Catherine over Linton , and his footmen ? Or will you be my friend , as you have been hitherto , and do what I request ? Decide ! because there is no reason for my lingering another minute , if you persist in your stubborn ill - nature ! "
66920	66925	66926	66926	she	240	" In the evening , "
66929	67664	66926	66926	she	240	" the evening of my visit to the Heights , I knew as well as if I saw him , that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place ; and I shunned going out , because I still carried his letter in my pocket , and did n't want to be threatened , or teased any more . I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere ; as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine . The consequence was , that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days . The fourth was Sunday , and I brought it into her room , after the family were gone to church . There was a man servant left to keep the house with me , and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service ; but on that occasion , the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open ; and to fulfil my engagement , as I knew who would be coming , I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges , and he must run over to the village , and get a few , to be paid for on the morrow . He departed , and I went up - stairs . Mrs. Linton sat in a loose , white dress , with a light shawl over her shoulders , in the recess of the open window , as usual . Her thick , long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness ; and now , she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck . Her appearance was altered , as I had told Heathcliff , but when she was calm , there seemed unearthly beauty in the change . The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness ; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her ; they appeared always to gaze beyond , and far beyond — you would have said out of this world — Then , the paleness of her face , its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh , and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state , though painfully suggestive of their causes , added to the touching interest , which she wakened , and invariably to me , I know , and to any person who saw her , I should think , refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay . A book lay spread on the sill before her , and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals . I believe Linton had laid it there , for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading , or occupation of any kind ; and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement . She was conscious of his aim , and in her better moods , endured his efforts placidly ; only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh , and cheeking him at last , with the saddest of smiles and kisses . At other times , she would turn petulantly away , and hide her face in her hands , or even push him off angrily ; and then he took care to let her alone , for he was certain of doing no good . Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing : and the full , mellow flow , of the beck in the valley , came soothingly on the ear . It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the Grange , when the trees were in leaf . At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days , following a great thaw , or a season of steady rain — and , of Wuthering Heights , Catherine was thinking as she listened ; that is , if she thought , or listened , at all ; but she had the vague , distant look , I mentioned before , which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye . "
67675	67691	67672	67673	Mrs. Linton	48	" I said , gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee . "
67710	67711	67705	67705	I	0	" "
67714	67735	67705	67705	I	0	" she answered , without altering the direction of her eyes . I opened it — it was very short . "
67738	67742	67705	67705	I	0	" I continued , "
67746	67790	67705	67705	I	0	" She drew away her hand , and let it fall . I replaced it in her lap , and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down ; but that movement was so long delayed that at last I resumed — "
67804	67882	67801	67802	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" There was a start , and a troubled gleam of recollection , and a struggle to arrange her ideas . She lifted the letter , and seemed to peruse it ; and when she came to the signature she sighed ; yet still I found she had not gathered its import ; for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name , and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness . "
67891	67902	67903	67903	He	43	" said I , guessing her need of an interpreter . "
67922	68185	67903	67903	He	43	" As I spoke , I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath , raise its ears , as if about to bark ; and then smoothing them back , announce by a wag of the tail that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger . Mrs. Linton bent forward , and listened breathlessly . The minute after a step traversed the hall ; the open house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in : most likely he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise , and so resolved to trust to his own audacity . With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber . He did not hit the right room directly ; she motioned me to admit him ; but he found it out , ere I could reach the door , and in a stride or two was at her side , and had her grasped in his arms . He neither spoke , nor loosed his hold , for some five minutes , during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before , I dare say ; but then my mistress had kissed him first , and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear , for downright agony , to look into her face ! The same conviction had stricken him as me , from the instant he beheld her , that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there — she was fated , sure to die . "
68200	68255	67903	67903	He	43	" was the first sentence he uttered , in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair . And now he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes ; but they burned with anguish , they did not melt . "
68259	68287	67903	67903	He	43	" said Catherine , leaning back , and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow — her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices . "
68358	68385	68386	68386	I	0	" Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her ; he attempted to rise , but she seized his hair , and kept him down . "
68393	68399	68388	68388	I	0	" she continued , bitterly , "
68531	68532	68525	68525	you	55	" "
68545	68698	68538	68538	I	0	" cried he , wrenching his head free , and grinding his teeth . The two , to a cool spectator , made a strange and fearful picture . Well might Catherine deem that Heaven would be a land of exile to her , unless , with her mortal body , she cast away her mortal character also . Her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek , and a bloodless lip , and scintillating eye ; and she retained , in her closed fingers , a portion of the locks she had been grasping . As to her companion , while raising himself with one hand , he had taken her arm with the other ; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition , that on his letting go , I saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin . "
68706	68712	68700	68700	you	1390	" he pursued , savagely , "
68804	68805	68806	68806	I	0	" "
68813	68863	68806	68806	I	0	" moaned Catherine , recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent , unequal throbbing of her heart , which beat visibly , and audibly under this excess of agitation . She said nothing further till the paroxysm was over ; then she continued , more kindly — "
68955	69061	69069	69069	he	1392	" Heathcliff went to the back of her chair , and leant over , but not so far as to let her see his face , which was livid with emotion . She bent round to look at him ; he would not permit it ; turning abruptly , he walked to the fire - place , where he stood , silent , with his back towards us . Mrs. Linton 's glance followed him suspiciously : every movement woke a new sentiment in her . After a pause , and a prolonged gaze , she resumed , addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment . "
69122	69128	69114	69114	he	43	" added she , musingly , "
69255	69262	69248	69248	he	43	" She went on to herself . "
69286	69531	69284	69284	Heathcliff	43	" In her eagerness she rose , and supported herself on the arm of the chair . At that earnest appeal , he turned to her , looking absolutely desperate . His eyes wide , and wet , at last , flashed fiercely on her ; his breast heaved convulsively . An instant they held asunder ; and then how they met I hardly saw , but Catherine made a spring , and he caught her , and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be released alive . In fact , to my eyes , she seemed directly insensible . He flung himself into the nearest seat , and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted , he gnashed at me , and foamed like a mad dog , and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy . I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species ; it appeared that he would not understand , though I spoke to him ; so , I stood off , and held my tongue , in great perplexity . A movement of Catherine 's relieved me a little presently : she put up her hand to clasp his neck , and bring her cheek to his , as he held her : while he , in return , covering her with frantic caresses , said wildly — "
69731	69732	69714	69714	you	1396	" "
69741	69745	69714	69714	you	1396	" sobbed Catherine . "
69781	69782	69779	69779	me	0	" "
69802	69806	69820	69820	I	0	" he answered . "
69841	69936	69820	69820	I	0	" They were silent — their faces hid against each other , and washed by each other 's tears . At least , I suppose the weeping was on both sides ; as it seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this . I grew very uncomfortable , meanwhile ; for the afternoon wore fast away , the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand , and I could distinguish , by the shine of the westering sun up the valley , a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch . "
69941	69945	69946	69946	My	0	" I announced . "
69958	70021	69946	69947	My master	530	" Heathcliff groaned a curse , and strained Catherine closer — she never moved . Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing . Mr. Linton was not far behind ; he opened the gate himself , and sauntered slowly up , probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer . "
70027	70031	70023	70023	he	530	" I exclaimed . "
70066	70067	70068	70068	I	0	" "
70074	70088	70072	70072	Cathy	54	" said Heathcliff , seeking to extricate himself from his companion 's arms . "
70115	70116	70105	70105	I	0	" "
70122	70135	70105	70105	I	0	" she answered , holding him as firmly as her strength allowed . "
70144	70145	70140	70140	I	0	" "
70150	70156	70140	70140	I	0	" he pleaded , earnestly . "
70162	70166	70167	70167	I	0	" she replied . "
70176	70208	70170	70170	Linton	73	" persisted the alarmed intruder . He would have risen , and unfixed her fingers by the act — she clung fast gasping ; there was mad resolution in her face . "
70211	70215	70170	70170	Linton	73	" she shrieked . "
70247	70248	70250	70251	the fool	3378	" "
70257	70267	70254	70254	he	3378	" cried Heathcliff , sinking back into his seat . "
70299	70327	70289	70289	I	0	" And there they were fast again . I heard my master mounting the stairs — the cold sweat ran from my forehead ; I was horrified . "
70337	70343	70344	70344	She	54	" I said , passionately . "
70399	70446	70397	70397	servant	1411	" I wrung my hands , and cried out ; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise . In the midst of my agitation , I was sincerely glad to observe that Catherine 's arms had fallen relaxed , and her head hung down . "
70453	70457	70397	70397	servant	1411	" I thought , "
70486	70533	70545	70546	a fiend	2992	" Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest , blanched with astonishment and rage . What he meant to do , I can not tell ; however , the other stopped all demonstrations , at once , by placing the lifeless - looking form in his arms . "
70537	70541	70545	70546	a fiend	2992	" he said , "
70559	70665	70553	70553	you	54	" He walked into the parlour , and sat down . Mr. Linton summoned me , and , with great difficulty , and after resorting to many means , we managed to restore her to sensation ; but she was all bewildered ; she sighed , and moaned , and knew nobody . Edgar , in his anxiety for her , forgot her hated friend . I did not . I went , at the earliest opportunity , and besought him to depart , affirming that Catherine was better , and he should hear from me in the morning , how she passed the night . "
70676	70680	70553	70553	you	54	" he answered ; "
70725	71106	70713	70713	I	0	" He sent a rapid glance through the half - open door of the chamber , and ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true , delivered the house of his luckless presence . About twelve o'clock , that night , was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights , a puny , seven months ' child ; and two hours after the mother died , having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff , or know Edgar . The latter 's distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on ; its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk . A great addition , in my eyes , was his being left without an heir . I bemoaned that , as I gazed on the feeble orphan ; and I mentally abused old Linton for , what was only natural partiality , the securing his estate to his own daughter , instead of his son 's . An unwelcomed infant it was , poor thing ! It might have wailed out of life , and nobody cared a morsel , during those first hours of existence . We redeemed the neglect afterwards ; but it 's beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be . Next morning — bright and cheerful out of doors — stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room , and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow , tender glow . Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow , and his eyes shut . His young and fair features were almost as death - like as those of the form beside him , and almost as fixed ; but his was the hush of exhausted anguish , and her 's of perfect peace . Her brow smooth , her lids closed , her lips wearing the expression of a smile . No angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared ; and I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay . My mind was never in a holier frame , than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest . I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered , a few hours before . "
71131	71315	71129	71129	God	66	" I do n't know if it be a peculiarity in me , but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death , should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me . I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break ; and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter — the Eternity they have entered — where life is boundless in its duration , and love in its sympathy , and joy in its fulness . I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton 's , when he so regretted Catherine 's blessed release ! To be sure one might have doubted , after the wayward and impatient existence she had led , whether she merited a haven of peace at last . One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection , but not then , in the presence of her corpse . It asserted its own tranquillity , which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitants . "
71339	71358	71330	71330	I	0	" I declined answering Mrs. Dean 's question , which struck me as something heterodox . She proceeded : "
71385	71654	71382	71383	her Maker	1423	" The master looked asleep , and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure , refreshing air . The servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch ; in reality my chief motive motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff . If he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange , unless , perhaps , he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to Gimmerton . If he had come nearer he would probably be aware , from the lights flitting to and fro , and the opening and shutting of the outer doors , that all was not right within . I wished yet feared to find him . I felt the terrible news must be told , and I longed to get it over , but how to do it I did not know . He was there — at least a few yards further in the park ; leant against an old ash tree , his hat off , and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches , and fell pattering round him . He had been standing a long time in that position , for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing , scarcely three feet from him , busy in building their nest , and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber . They flew off at my approach , and he raised his eyes and spoke : "
71659	71663	71655	71655	She	1424	" he said ; "
71695	71772	71688	71688	she	1424	" I was weeping as much for him as her : we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others ; and when I first looked into his face I perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe ; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled , and he prayed , because his lips moved , and his gaze was bent on the ground . "
71779	71792	71775	71775	she	1424	" I answered , checking my sobs , and drying my cheeks . "
71825	71826	71828	71828	she	1424	" "
71835	71843	71828	71828	she	1424	" asked Heathcliff , attempting a sneer . "
71865	71907	71910	71910	she	1424	" He endeavoured to pronounce the name , but could not manage it ; and compressing his mouth , he held a silent combat with his inward agony , defying , meanwhile , my sympathy with an unflinching , ferocious stare . "
71913	71954	71910	71910	she	1424	" he resumed , at last — fain , notwithstanding his hardihood , to have a support behind him , for , after the struggle , he trembled , in spite of himself , to his very finger - ends . "
71958	71962	71910	71910	she	1424	" I thought ; "
72008	72009	72012	72013	a lamb	1433	" "
72015	72021	72022	72022	She	1434	" I answered , aloud . "
72059	72060	72065	72065	she	1434	" "
72070	72096	72065	72065	she	1434	" he asked , hesitating , as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear . "
72112	72116	72102	72102	she	1434	" I said . "
72156	72157	72159	72159	she	1434	" "
72164	72186	72159	72159	she	1434	" he cried , with frightful vehemence , stamping his foot , and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion . "
72335	73084	73085	73085	My	0	" He dashed his head against the knotted trunk ; and , lifting up his eyes , howled , not like a man , but like a savage beast getting goaded to death with knives and spears . I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree , and his band and forehead were both stained ; probably the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night . It hardly moved my compassion — it appalled me ; still I felt reluctant to quit him so . But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching , he thundered a command for me to go , and I obeyed . He was beyond my skill to quiet or console ! Mrs. Linton 's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following her decease ; and till then her coffin remained uncovered , and strewn with flowers and scented leaves , in the great drawing - room . Linton spent his days and nights there , a sleepless guardian ; and — a circumstance concealed from all but me — Heathcliff spent his nights , at least , outside , equally a stranger to repose . I held no communication with him ; still I was conscious of his design to enter , if he could ; and on the Tuesday , a little after dark , when my master from sheer fatigue , had been compelled to retire a couple of hours , I went and opened one of the windows , moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the fading image of his idol one final adieu . He did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity , cautiously and briefly ; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise ; indeed , I should n't have discovered that he had been there , except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse 's face , and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair , fastened with a silver thread , which , on examination , I ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine 's neck . Heathcliff had opened the trinket , and cast out its contents , replacing them by a black lock of his own . I twisted the two , and enclosed them together . Mr. Earnshaw was , of course , invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave ; and he sent no excuse , but he never came ; so that besides her husband , the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants . Isabella was not asked . The place of Catherine 's interment , to the surprise of the villagers , was neither in the chapel , under the carved monument of the Lintons ' , nor yet by the tombs of her own relations , outside . It was dug on a green slope , in a corner of the kirkyard , where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor ; and peat mould almost buries it . Her husband lies in the same spot , now ; and they have each a simple headstone , above , and a plain grey block at their feet , to mark the graves . That Friday made the last of our fine days , for a month . In the evening , the weather broke ; the wind shifted from south to north - east , and brought rain , first , and then sleet , and snow . On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer : the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts : the larks were silent , the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened — And dreary , and chill , and dismal that morrow did creep over ! My master kept his room — I took possession of the lonely parlour , converting it into a nursery ; and there I was sitting , with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee ; rocking it to and fro , and watching , meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window , when the door opened , and some person entered out of breath , and laughing ! "
73108	73131	73105	73105	I	0	" Have done ! How dare you show your giddiness , here ? What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you ? "
73132	73136	73162	73163	the speaker	2714	" Excuse me ! "
73142	73158	73162	73163	the speaker	2714	" but I know Edgar is in bed , and I can not stop myself . "
73180	73191	73192	73192	she	2714	" I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights ! "
73199	73278	73192	73192	she	2714	" Except where I 've flown — I could n't count the number of falls I 've had — Oh , I 'm aching all over ! Do n't be alarmed — There shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it — only just have the goodness to step out , and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton , and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe . "
73421	73427	73428	73428	I	0	" My dear young lady , "
73430	73479	73428	73428	I	0	" I 'll stir no - where , and hear nothing , till you have removed every article of your clothes , and put on dry things ; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to - night ; so it is needless to order the carriage . "
73480	73486	73487	73487	she	48	" Certainly , I shall ; "
73490	73525	73526	73526	She	48	" walking or riding — yet I 've no objection to dress myself decently ; and — ah , see how it flows down my neck now ! the fire does make it smart . "
73583	73587	73588	73588	she	48	" Now Ellen , "
73616	73725	73726	73726	she	1451	" You sit down opposite me , and put poor Catherine 's baby away — I do n't like to see it ! You must n't think I care little for Catherine , because I behaved so foolishly on entering — I've cried too , bitterly — yes , more than any one else has reason to cry — we parted unreconciled , you remember , and I sha n't forgive myself . But for all that , I was not going to sympathise with him — the brute beast ! O give me the poker ! This is the last thing of his I have about me , "
73743	73749	73750	73750	she	1451	" I 'll smash it ! "
73757	73765	73767	73767	she	1451	" And then I 'll burn it ! "
73778	73965	73767	73767	she	1451	" There ! he shall buy another , if he gets me back again . He 'd be capable of coming to seek me , to tease Edgar — I dare not stay , lest that notion should possess his wicked head ! And besides , Edgar has not been kind , has he ? And I wo n't come suing for his assistance ; nor will I bring him into more trouble — Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here ; though if I had not learnt he was out of the way , I 'd have halted at the kitchen , washed my face , warmed myself , got you to bring what I wanted , and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed — of that incarnate goblin ! Ah , he was in such a fury — if he had caught me ! It 's a pity , Earnshaw is not his match in strength — I would n't have run , till I 'd seen him all but demolished , had Hindley been able to do it ! "
73966	73977	73978	73978	I	0	" Well , do n't talk so fast , Miss ! "
73981	74028	73978	73978	I	0	" you 'll disorder the handkerchief I have tied round your face , and make the cut bleed again — Drink your tea , and take breath and give over laughing — Laughter is sadly out of place under this roof , and in your condition ! "
74029	74034	74035	74035	she	1452	" An undeniable truth , "
74038	74068	74035	74035	she	1452	" Listen to that child ! It maintains a constant wail — send it out of my hearing , for an hour ; I sha n't stay any longer . "
74116	74117	74118	74118	I	0	" "
74127	74131	74118	74118	I	0	" answered she ; "
74432	74433	74414	74414	Monster	130	" "
74444	74448	74440	74442	a human being	3605	" I said . "
74462	74463	74464	74464	He	81	" "
74471	74475	74467	74469	a human being	3605	" she retorted ; "
74565	74586	74587	74587	You	1463	" And here Isabella began to cry ; but , immediately dashing the water from her lashes , she recommenced . "
74704	74788	74789	74789	Heathcliff	43	" Yesterday , you know , Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral . He kept himself sober , for the purpose — tolerably sober ; not going to - bed mad , at six o'clock and getting up drunk , at twelve . Consequently , he rose , in suicidal low spirits ; as fit for the church , as for a dance ; and instead , he sat down by the fire , and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls . "
74989	75078	75107	75107	he	43	" I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph 's eternal lectures without weeping ; and to move up and down the house , less with the foot of a frightened thief , than formerly . You would n't think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say , but he and Hareton are detestable companions . I 'd rather sit with Hindley , and hear his awful talk , than with ' t ' little maister , ' and his staunch supporter , that odious old man ! "
75203	75209	75182	75182	he	45	" so as by fire . "
75228	75302	75303	75303	Hindley	75	" Yester - evening , I sat in my nook reading some old books , till late on towards twelve . It seemed so dismal to go up - stairs , with the wild snow blowing outside , and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard , and the new made grave ! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me , that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place . "
75470	75523	75450	75450	Heathcliff	43	" That entrance was fastened ; and we heard him coming round to get in by the other . I rose with an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips , which induced my companion , who had been staring towards the door , to turn and look at me . "
75532	75536	75537	75537	You	0	" He exclaimed . "
75542	75543	75537	75537	You	0	" "
75558	75562	75546	75546	you	0	" I answered . "
75577	75654	75655	75655	You	0	" Earnshaw accomplished this , ere his guest reached the front ; he then came , and brought his chair to the other side of my table ; leaning over it , and searching in my eyes , a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his : as he both looked , and felt like an assassin , he could n't exactly find that ; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak . "
75660	75664	75655	75655	You	0	" he said , "
75717	75718	75719	75719	I	0	" "
75726	75730	75719	75719	I	0	" I replied , "

75786	75790	75791	75792	Mrs. Heathcliff	48	" cried Hindley . "
75900	75937	75938	75938	I	0	" He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his breast , and would have turned down the candle — I snatched it away , however , and seized his arm . "
75945	75949	75938	75938	I	0	" I said , "
75966	75967	75950	75950	You	48	" "
75985	75991	75992	75992	I	0	" cried the desperate being , "
76050	76091	76092	76092	You	0	" I might as well have struggled with a bear ; or reasoned with a lunatic . The only resource left me was to run to a lattice , and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him . "
76103	76112	76113	76114	Mr. Earnshaw	75	" I exclaimed in a rather triumphant tone . "
76130	76131	76113	76114	Mr. Earnshaw	75	" "
76141	76159	76139	76139	you	0	" he answered , addressing me by some elegant term that I do n't care to repeat . "
76168	76173	76160	76160	I	0	" I retorted again , "
76191	76388	76389	76389	Isabella	82	" With that I shut the window , and returned to my place by the fire ; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him . Earnshaw swore passionately at me ; affirming that I loved the villain yet : and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced . And I , in my secret heart , ( and conscience never reproached me ) thought what a blessing it would be for him , should Heathcliff put him out of misery : and what a blessing for me , should he send Heathcliff to his right abode ! As I sat nursing these reflections , the casement behind me , was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual ; and his black countenance looked blightingly through . The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow ; and I smiled , exulting in my fancied security . His hair and clothes were whitened with snow , and his sharp cannibal teeth , revealed by cold and wrath , gleamed through the dark . "
76401	76412	76413	76413	I	0	" he ' girned ' , as Joseph calls it . "
76419	76422	76413	76413	I	0	" I replied "
76435	76436	76423	76424	Mr. Hindley	75	" "
76445	76449	76423	76424	Mr. Hindley	75	" he said . "
76457	76579	76450	76450	Hindley	75	" I answered . And that 's a poor love of yours , that can not bear a shower of snow ! We were left at peace in our beds , as long as the summer moon shone , but the moment a blast of winter returns , you must run for shelter ! Heathcliff , if I were you , I 'd go stretch myself over her grave , and die like a faithful dog . . .The world is surely not worth living in now , is it ? You had distinctly impressed on me , the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life — I ca n't imagine how you think of surviving her loss . "
76580	76589	76591	76592	my companion	350	" He 's there . . .is he ? "
76599	76612	76591	76592	my companion	350	" If I can get my arm out I can hit him ! "
76613	76930	76450	76450	Hindley	75	" I 'm afraid Ellen , you 'll set me down , as really wicked — but you do n't know all , so do n't judge ! I would n't have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life , for anything — Wish that he were dead , I must ; and therefore , I was fearfully disappointed , and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on Earnshaw 's weapon and wrenched it from his grasp . The charge exploded , and the knife , in springing back , closed into its owner 's wrist . Heathcliff pulled it away by main force , slitting up the flesh as it passed on , and thrust it dripping into his pocket . He then took a stone , struck down the division between two windows and sprung in . His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain , and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery , or a large vein . The ruffian kicked and trampled on him , and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags ; holding me with one hand , meantime , to prevent me summoning Joseph . He exerted preter - human self denial in abstaining from finishing him , completely ; but getting out of breath , he finally desisted , and dragged the apparently inanimate body onto the settle . There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw 's coat , and bound up the wound with brutal roughness , spitting and cursing , during the operation , as energetically as he had kicked before . Being at liberty , I lost no time in seeking the old servant ; who , having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale , hurried below , gasping , as he descended the steps two at once . "
76947	76948	76591	76592	my companion	350	" "
76955	76959	76450	76450	Hindley	75	" thundered Heathcliff , "
77035	77036	77040	77040	yah	1495	" "
77046	77058	77040	77040	yah	1495	" exclaimed Joseph , lifting his hands and eyes in horror . "
77072	77155	77069	77070	the Lord	2633	" Heathcliff gave him a push onto his knees , in the middle of the blood ; and flung a towel to him ; but instead of proceeding to dry it up , he joined his hands , and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology . I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing ; in fact , I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows . "
77162	77167	77158	77158	I	0	" said the tyrant , "
77199	77735	77188	77188	viper	1500	" He shook me till my teeth rattled , and pitched me beside Joseph , who steadily concluded his supplications , and then rose , vowing he would set off for the Grange directly . Mr. Linton was a magistrate , and though he had fifty wives dead , he should inquire into this . He was so obstinate in his resolution that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel , from my lips , a recapitulation of what had taken place ; standing over me , heaving with malevolence , as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions . It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that he was not the aggressor ; especially with my hardly wrung replies . However , Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still ; he hastened to administer a dose of spirits , and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness . Heathcliff , aware that he was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible , called him deliriously intoxicated ; and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further ; but advised him to get to bed . To my joy , he left us after giving this judicious counsel , and Hindley stretched himself on the hearth - stone . I departed to my own room , marvelling that I had escaped so easily . This morning , when I came down , about half - an - hour before noon , Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire , deadly sick ; his evil genius almost as guant and ghastly , leant against the chimney . Neither appeared inclined to dine ; and having waited till all was cold on the table , I commenced alone . Nothing hindered me from eating heartily ; and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority , as , at intervals , I cast a look towards my silent companions , and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me . After I had done , I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire ; going round Earnshaw 's seat , and kneeling in the corner beside him . Heathcliff did not glance my way , and I gazed up , and contemplated his features , almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone . His forehead , that I once thought so manly , and that I now think so diabolical , was shaded with a heavy cloud ; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness — and weeping , perhaps , for the lashes were wet then : his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer , and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness . Had it been another , , I would have covered my face , in the presence of such grief . In his case , I was gratified : and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy , I could n't miss this chance of sticking in a dart ; his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong . "
77742	77746	77740	77740	Miss	1501	" I interrupted . "
77786	77787	77784	77784	his	66	" "
77801	77805	77799	77799	Ellen	80	" she continued . "
77971	77972	77958	77958	I	0	" "
77980	77984	77958	77958	I	0	" he replied . "
78010	78011	78029	78029	she	54	" "
78017	78023	78029	78029	she	54	" was my next remark . "
78091	78092	78093	78093	I	0	" "
78098	78102	78093	78093	I	0	" he answered ; "
78120	78121	78122	78122	He	1507	" "
78137	78141	78122	78122	He	1507	" I whispered . "
78166	78213	78155	78155	he	1507	" Mr. Earnshaw looked up , like me , to the countenance of our mutual foe ; who , absorbed in his anguish , seemed insensible to anything around him ; the longer he stood , the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features . "
78239	78262	78231	78231	I	0	" groaned the impatient man writhing to rise , and sinking back in despair , convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle . "
78276	78281	78269	78269	he	1507	" I observed aloud . "
78343	78442	78336	78336	I'm	0	" Most likely , Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said , than the spirit of the person who said it . His attention was roused , I saw , for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes , and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs . I stared full at him , and laughed scornfully . The clouded windows of hell flashed , a moment towards me ; the fiend which usually looked out , however , was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision . "
78453	78475	78336	78336	I'm	0	" said the mourner . I guessed he uttered those words , at least , though his voice was hardly intelligible . "
78481	78485	78476	78476	I	0	" I replied . "
78545	78546	78543	78543	her	54	" "
78560	78575	78554	78554	I	0	" he cried , making a movement that caused me to make one also . "
78576	78580	78581	78581	I	0	" But then , "
78590	78639	78581	78581	I	0	" if poor Catherine had trusted you , and assumed the ridiculous , contemptible , degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff , she would soon have presented a similar picture ! She would n't have borne your abominable behaviour quietly ; her detestation and disgust must have found voice . "
78873	79167	79177	79177	they	1524	" Isabella ceased speaking , and took a drink of tea ; then she rose , and bidding me put on her bonnet , and a great shawl I had brought , and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour , she stepped onto a chair , kissed Edgar 's and Catherine 's portraits , bestowed a similar salute on me , and descended to the carriage accompanied by Fanny , who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress , She was driven away , never to revisit this neighbourhood ; but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled . I believe her new abode was in the south , near London ; there she had a son born , a few months subsequent to her escape . He was christened Linton , and , from the first , she reported him to be an ailing , peevish creature . Mr. Heathcliff , meeting me one day in the village , inquired where she lived . I refused to tell . He remarked that it was not of any moment , only she must beware of coming to her brother ; she should not be with him , if he had to keep her himself . Though I would give no information , he discovered , through some of the other servants , both her place of residence , and the existence of the child . Still he did n't molest her ; for which forbearance she might thank his aversion , I suppose . He often asked about the infant , when he saw me ; and on hearing its name , smiled grimly , and observed : "
79179	79180	79177	79177	they	1524	" "
79195	79199	79185	79185	they	1524	" I answered . "
79206	79210	79201	79201	I	0	" he said , "
79222	79925	79928	79928	Nelly	80	" Fortunately , its mother died before the time arrived , some thirteen years after the decease of Catherine , when Linton was twelve , or a little more . On the day succeeding Isabella 's unexpected visit , I had no opportunity of speaking to my master : he shunned conversation , and was fit for discussing nothing . When I could get him to listen , I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband , whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow . So deep and sensitive was his aversion , that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff . Grief , and that together , transformed him into a complete hermit : he threw up his office of magistrate , ceased even to attend church , avoided the village on all occasions , and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds : only varied by solitary rambles on the moors , and visits to the grave of his wife , mostly at evening , or early morning , before other wanderers were abroad . But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long . He did n't pray for Catherine 's soul to haunt him : Time brought resignation , and a melancholy sweeter than common joy . He recalled her memory with ardent , tender love , and hopeful aspiring to the better world , where , he doubted not she was gone . And he had earthly consolation and affections , also . For a few days , I said , he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed : that coldness melted as fast as snow in April , and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step , it wielded a despot 's sceptre in his heart . It was named Catherine , but he never called it the name in full , as he had never called the first Catherine short , probably because Heathcliff , had a habit of doing so . The little one was always Cathy , it formed to him a distinction from the mother , and yet , a connection with her ; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her , far more than from its being his own . I used to draw a comparison between him , and Hindley Earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily , why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances . They had both been fond husbands , and were both attached to their children ; and I could not see how they should n't both have taken the same road , for good or evil . But , I thought in my mind , Hindley with apparently the stronger head , has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man . When his ship struck , the captain abandoned his post ; and the crew , instead of trying to save her , rushed into riot , and confusion , leaving no hope for their luckless vessel . Linton , on the contrary , displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul : he trusted God ; and God comforted him . One hoped , and the other despaired : they chose their own lots , and were righteously doomed to endure them . But you 'll not want to hear my moralizing , Mr. Lockwood : you 'll judge as well as I can , all these things ; at least , you 'll think you will and that 's the same . The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected : it followed fast on his sister 's , there was scarcely six months between them . We , at the Grange , never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it ; all that I did learn , was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral . Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my master . "
79930	79956	79928	79928	Nelly	80	" said he , riding into the yard , one morning , too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news . "
79983	79984	79980	79980	you	80	" "
79987	79994	79980	79980	you	80	" I asked in a flurry . "
79999	80016	79980	79980	you	80	" he returned , dismounting , and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door . "
80034	80035	80026	80026	I	0	" "
80045	80046	80042	80042	I	0	" "
80056	80094	80050	80050	you	0	" said the doctor . No , Heathcliff 's a tough young fellow ; he looks blooming to - day — I've just seen him . He 's rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half . "
80103	80108	80100	80101	Mr. Kenneth	92	" I repeated impatiently . "
80117	80121	80115	80115	Hindley	75	" he replied . "
80229	80291	80292	80292	he	75	" I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton 's death : ancient associations lingered round my heart ; I sat down in the porch , and wept as for a blood relation , desiring Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master . I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question—"Had
80297	80518	80519	80519	His	1534	" Whatever I did that idea would bother me : it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights , and assist in the last duties to the dead . Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent , but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay ; and I said my old master , and foster brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own . Besides , I reminded him that the child , Hareton , was his wife 's nephew ; and , in the absence of nearer kin , he ought to act as its guardian ; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left , and look over the concerns of his brother - in - law . He was unfit for attending to such matters then , but he bid me speak to his lawyer ; and at length , permitted me to go . His lawyer had been Earnshaw 's also : I called at the village , and asked him to accompany me . He shook his head , and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone ; affirming , if the truth were known , Hareton would be found little else than a beggar . "
80525	80529	80519	80519	His	1534	" he said , "
80571	80634	80561	80561	he	1538	" When I reached the Heights , I explained that I had come to see everything carried on decently , and Joseph , who appeared in sufficient distress , expressed satisfaction at my presence . Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted , but I might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral , if I chose . "
80637	80641	80561	80561	he	1538	" he remarked , "
80780	80791	80792	80793	Aw'd rayther	132	" The old servant confirmed this statement , but muttered , "
80824	80957	80813	80813	he	1539	" I insisted on the funeral being respectable — Mr. Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too ; only , he desired me to remember , that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket . He maintained a hard , careless deportment , indicative of neither joy nor sorrow ; if anything , it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work , successfully executed , I observed once , indeed , something like exultation in his aspect . It was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house ; he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner ; and previous to following with Hareton he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table , and muttered with peculiar gusto , "
80989	81020	81021	81022	That boy	1546	" The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech ; he played with Heathcliff 's whiskers , and stroked his cheek , but I divined its meaning and observed tartly , "
81046	81047	81032	81032	Sir	2571	" "
81053	81057	81061	81061	he	73	" he demanded . "
81069	81073	81061	81061	he	73	" I replied . "
81076	81081	81082	81082	We	1545	" said the scoundrel , "
81159	81345	81143	81143	I	0	" This hint was enough to bind our hands . I repeated its substance , on my return , and Edgar Linton , little interested at the commencement , spoke no more of interfering . I 'm not aware that he could have done it to any purpose , had he been ever so willing . The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights : he held firm possession , and proved to the attorney , who , in his turn , proved it to Mr. Linton , that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming : and he , Heathcliff , was the mortgagee . In that manner , Hareton , who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood , was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father 's inveterate enemy ; and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages , and quite unable to right himself , because of his friendlessness , and his ignorance that he has been wronged . "
81350	81355	81143	81143	I	0	" continued Mrs. Dean , "
81620	81626	81609	81610	a servant	269	" I shall tell papa ! "
81820	81853	81816	81816	she	1553	" Ellen , how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills ? I wonder what lies on the other side — is it the sea ? "
81854	81860	81861	81861	I	0	" No , Miss Cathy , "
81865	81874	81861	81861	I	0	" it is hills again just like these . "
81875	81890	81891	81891	she	1553	" And what are those golden rocks like , when you stand under them ? "
81956	81970	81971	81971	she	1553	" And why are they bright so long after it is evening here ? "
81974	81987	81989	81989	I	0	" Because they are a great deal higher up than we are , "
81991	82039	81989	81989	I	0	" you could not climb them , they are too high and steep . In winter the frost is always there before it comes to us ; and , deep into summer , I have found snow under that black hollow on the north - east side ! "
82040	82049	82050	82050	she	1553	" Oh , you have been on them ! "
82055	82075	82050	82050	she	1553	" Then I can go , too , when I am a woman . Has papa been , Ellen ? "
82076	82084	82085	82085	I	0	" Papa would tell you , Miss , "
82090	82125	82085	82085	I	0	" that they are not worth the trouble of visiting . The moors , where you ramble with him , are much nicer ; and Thrushcross park is the finest place in the world . "
82126	82140	82141	82141	she	1553	" But I know the park , and I do n't know those , "
82146	82175	82141	82141	she	1553	" And I should delight to look round me , from the brow of that tallest point — my little pony , Minny , shall take me sometime . "
82228	82241	82247	82247	her	56	" Now , am I old enough to go to Penistone Craggs ? "
82276	82285	82286	82286	I	0	" Not yet , love , not yet . "
82969	82976	82977	82977	he	1593	" I saw her at morn , "
82980	83014	82977	82977	he	1593	" she would have me to cut her a hazel switch ; and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder , where it is lowest , and gallopped out of sight . "
83038	83045	83046	83046	I	0	" What will become of her ? "
83138	83151	83152	83152	I	0	" And what if she should have slipped in clambering among them , "
83155	83167	83152	83152	I	0	" and been killed , or broken some of her bones ? "
83259	83262	83264	83264	she	1608	" Ah , "
83266	83296	83264	83264	she	1608	" you are come a seeking your little mistress ! do n't be frightened . She 's here safe — but I 'm glad it is n't the master . "
83297	83308	83309	83309	I	0	" He is not at home then , is he ? "
83320	83325	83326	83326	she	1608	" No , no , "
83329	83357	83326	83326	she	1608	" both he and Joseph are off , and I think they wo nt return this hour or more . Step in and rest you a bit . "
83455	83461	83462	83462	I	0	" Very well , Miss , "
83473	83501	83462	83462	I	0	" This is your last ride , till papa comes back . I 'll not trust you over the threshold again , you naughty , naughty girl . "
83502	83507	83508	83508	she	1610	" Aha , Ellen ! "
83522	83553	83508	83508	she	1610	" I shall have a pretty story to tell to - night — and so you 've found me out . Have you ever been here in your life before ? "
83554	83565	83567	83567	I.	0	" Put that hat on , and home at once , "
83568	83646	83567	83567	I.	0	" I 'm dreadfully grieved at you , Miss Cathy , you 've done extremely wrong ! It 's no use pouting and crying ; that wo nt repay the trouble I 've had , scouring the country after you . To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in ; and you stealing off so ; it shows you are a cunning little fox , and nobody will put faith in you any more . "
83647	83653	83655	83655	she	1615	" What have I done ? "
83660	83681	83655	83655	she	1615	" Papa charged me nothing — he'll not scold me , Ellen — he 's never cross , like you ! "
83682	83687	83688	83688	I	0	" Come , come ! "
83691	83721	83688	83688	I	0	" I 'll tie the riband . Now , let us have no petulance . Oh , for shame . You thirteen years old , and such a baby ! "
83745	83748	83750	83751	the servant	2711	" Nay , "
83753	83806	83750	83751	the servant	2711	" do n't be hard on the bonny lass , Mrs. Dean . We made her stop — she'd fain have ridden forwards , afeard you should be uneasy . But Hareton offered to go with her , and I thought he should . It 's a wild road over the hills . "
83838	83846	83847	83847	I	0	" How long am I to wait ? "
83856	83892	83847	83847	I	0	" It will be dark in ten minutes . Where is the pony , Miss Cathy ? And where is Phenix ? I shall leave you , unless you be quick , so please yourself . "
83893	83901	83902	83902	she	1617	" The pony is in the yard , "
83905	83947	83902	83902	she	1617	" and Phenix is shut in there . He 's bitten — and so is Charlie . I was going to tell you all about it ; but you are in a bad temper , and do n't deserve to hear . "
84033	84057	84026	84026	I	0	" Well , Miss Cathy , if you were aware whose house this is , you 'd be glad enough to get out . "
84058	84069	84071	84071	she	1617	" It 's your father 's , is n't it ? "
84077	84080	84081	84081	he	47	" Nay , "
84109	84117	84118	84118	she	1617	" Whose then — your master 's ? "
84138	84144	84146	84148	the tiresome girl	1623	" Who is his master ? "
84154	84201	84146	84148	the tiresome girl	1623	" He talked about ' our house , ' and ' our folk . ' I thought he had been the owner 's son . And he never said , Miss ; he should have done , should n't he , if he 's a servant ? "
84234	84241	84242	84242	she	1623	" Now , get my horse , "
84262	84312	84242	84242	she	1623	" And you may come with me . I want to see where the goblin hunter rises in the marsh , and to hear about the fairishes , as you call them — but , make haste ! What 's the matter ? Get my horse , I say . "
84313	84326	84328	84329	the lad	2768	" I 'll see thee damned , before I be thy servant ! "
84331	84339	84341	84341	Catherine	56	" You 'll see me me what ? "
84345	84352	84353	84353	he	2768	" Damned — thou saucy witch ! "
84356	84371	84372	84372	I	0	" There , Miss Cathy ! you see you have got into pretty company , "
84375	84407	84372	84372	I	0	" Nice words to be used to a young lady ! Pray do n't begin to dispute with him — Come , let us seek for Minny ourselves , and begone . "
84408	84412	84414	84414	she	56	" But Ellen , "
84422	84458	84459	84459	Hareton	47	" How dare he speak so to me ? Must n't he be made to do as I ask him ? You wicked creature , I shall tell papa what you said — Now then ! "
84478	84484	84485	84485	she	56	" You bring the pony , "
84493	84502	84485	84485	she	56	" and let my dog free this moment ! "
84503	84508	84510	84511	the addressed	1630	" Softly , Miss , "
84513	84550	84485	84485	she	56	" You 'll lose nothing , by being civil . Though Mr. Hareton , there , be not the master 's son , he 's your cousin ; and I was never hired to serve you . "
84551	84556	84558	84558	Cathy	56	" He my cousin ! "
84564	84569	84571	84571	her	56	" Yes , indeed , "
84574	84587	84588	84588	she	56	" Oh , Ellen ! do n't let them say such things , "
84615	84635	84613	84613	my	0	" she stopped , and wept outright ; upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown . "
84640	84644	84613	84613	my	0	" I whispered , "
84682	84683	84684	84684	He	133	" "
84696	85179	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" she went on , gathering fresh grief from reflection , and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea . I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations ; having no doubt of Linton 's approaching arrival , communicated by the former , being reported to Mr. Heathcliff ; and feeling as confident that Catherine 's first thought on her father 's return , would be to seek an explanation of the latter 's assertion , concerning her rude - bred kindred . Hareton , recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant , seemed moved by her distress ; and , having fetched the pony round to the door , he took , to propitiate her , a fine crooked - legged terrier whelp from the kennel ; and putting it into her hand , bid her wisht for he meant naught . Pausing in her lamentations , she surveyed him with a glance of awe , and horror , then burst forth anew . I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow ; who was a well - made , athletic youth , good looking in features , and stout and healthy , but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm , and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game . Still , I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed . Good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds , to be sure , whose rankness far over - topped their neglected growth ; yet notwithstanding , evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops , under other and favourable circumstances . Mr. Heathcliff , I believe , had not treated him physically ill ; thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression ; it had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill - treatment , in Heathcliff 's judgment . He appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute : he was never taught to read or write ; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper ; never led a single step towards virtue , or guarded by a single precept against vice . And from what I heard , Joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a narrow minded partiality which prompted him to flatter , and pet him , as a boy , because he was the head of the old family . And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw , and Heathcliff , when children , of putting the master past his patience , and compelling him to seek solace in drink , by what he termed , their "
85183	85706	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" so at present , he laid the whole burden of Hareton 's faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property . If the lad swore he would n't correct him ; nor however culpably he behaved . It gave Joseph satisfaction , apparently , to watch him go the worst lengths . He allowed that he was ruined ; that his soul was abandoned to perdition ; but then , he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it . Hareton 's blood would be required at his hands ; and there lay immense consolation in that thought . Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name , and of his lineage ; he would had he dared , have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the Heights , but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition ; and he confined his feelings , regarding him , to muttered inuendo 's and private comminations . I do n't pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days , at Wuthering Heights . I only speak from hearsay ; for I saw little . The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was near , and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants ; but the house , inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management ; and the scenes of riot common in Hindley 's time , were not now enacted within its walls . The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people , good or bad , and he is yet — This , however , is not making progress with my story . Miss Cathy rejected the peace - offering of the terrier , and demanded her own dogs , Charlie and Phenix . They came limping , and hanging their heads ; and we set out for home , sadly out of sorts , every one of us . I could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day ; except that , as I supposed , the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags ; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse , when Hareton happened to issue forth , attended by some canine followers who attacked her train . They had a smart battle , before their owners could separate them : that formed an introduction . Catherine told Hareton who she was , and where she was going ; and asked him to show her the way ; finally , beguilnig him to accompany her . He opened the mysteries of the Fairy cave , and twenty other queer places ; but being in disgrace , I was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw . I could gather however , that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant , and Heathcliff 's housekeeper hurt hers , by calling him her cousin . Then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart ; she who was always "
85709	85711	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" and "
85714	85716	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" and "
85719	85721	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" and "
85724	85928	84694	84694	Ellen	80	" with everybody at the Grange ; to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger ! She did not comprehend it ; and hard work I had , to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father . I explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights , and how sorry he would be to find she had been there ; but , I insisted most on the fact , that if she revealed my negligence of his orders , he would perhaps , be so angry that I should have to leave ; and Cathy could n't bear that prospect : she pledged her word , and kept it , for my sake — after all , she was a sweet little girl . A letter , edged with black , announced the day of my master 's return . Isabella was dead ; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter , and arrange a room , and other accommodations , for his youthful nephew . Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back : and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her "
85930	86002	86003	86003	Linton	56	" cousin . The evening of their expected arrival came . Since early morning , she had been busy , ordering her own small affairs ; and now , attired in her new black frock — poor thing ! her aunt 's death impressed her with no definite sorrow — she obliged me , by constant worrying , to walk with her , down through the grounds , to meet them . "
86013	86035	86003	86003	Linton	56	" she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf , under shadow of the trees . "
86124	86176	86115	86115	Ellen	80	" She ran , and returned and ran again , many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate , and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path , and tried to wait patiently ; but that was impossible ; she could n't be still a minute . "
86182	86186	86115	86115	Ellen	80	" she exclaimed . "
86242	86463	86197	86197	they	1644	" I refused staunchily : and , at length , her suspense was ended : the travelling carriage rolled in sight . Miss Cathy shrieked , and stretched out her arms , as soon as she caught her father 's face , looking from the window . He descended , nearly as eager as herself ; and a considerable interval elapsed , ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves . While they exchanged caresses , I took a peep in to see after Linton . He was asleep , in a corner , wrapped in a warm , fur - lined cloak , as if it had been winter , A pale , delicate , effeminate boy , who might have been taken for my master 's younger brother , so strong was the resemblance , but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect , that Edgar Linton never had . The latter saw me looking ; and having shaken hands , advised me to close the door , and leave him undisturbed ; for the journey had fatigued him . Cathy would fain have taken one glance ; but her father told her to come on , and they walked together up the park , while I hastened before , to prepare the servants . "
86468	86489	86197	86197	they	1644	" said Mr. Linton , addressing his daughter , , as they halted at the bottom of the front steps . "
86557	86558	86555	86555	you	344	" "
86565	86569	86555	86555	you	344	" answered Catherine ; "
86586	86607	86579	86579	he	3950	" The carriage stopped ; and the sleeper , being roused , was lifted to the ground by his uncle . "
86616	86626	86612	86612	Cathy	56	" he said , putting their little hands together . "
86675	86676	86627	86627	She	56	" "
86684	86708	86627	86627	She	56	" answered the boy , shrinking from Catherine 's salute ; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears . "
86719	86727	86728	86728	You	0	" I whispered , leading him in . "
86743	86830	86831	86831	I	0	" I do not know whether it were sorrow for him , but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself , and returned to her father . All three entered , and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready . I proceeded to remove Linton 's cap , and mantle , and placed him on a chair by the table ; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh . My master inquired what was the matter . "
86839	86844	86831	86831	I	0	" sobbed the boy . "
86859	86988	86852	86852	Ellen	80	" answered his uncle , patiently . He had been greatly tried during the journey , I felt convinced , by his fretful , ailing charge . Linton slowly trailed himself off , and lay down . Cathy carried a foot - stool and her cup to his side . At first she sat silent ; but that could not last ; she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin , as she would have him to be ; and she commenced stroking his curls , and kissing his cheek , and offering him tea in her saucer , like a baby . This pleased him , for he was not much better ; he dried his eyes , and lightened into a faint smile . "
86997	87010	86991	86991	he	1651	" said the master to me , after watching them a minute . "
87049	87209	87210	87210	I	0	" Aye , if we can keep him ! I mused to myself ; and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that . And then , I thought , however will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights , between his father and Hareton ? what playmates and instructors they 'll be . Our doubts were presently decided ; even earlier than I expected . I had just taken the children up stairs , after tea was finished ; and seen Linton asleep — he would not suffer me to leave him , till that was the case — I had come down , and was standing by the table in the hall , lighting a bed - room candle for Mr. Edgar , when a maid stepped out of the kitchen , and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff'a servant , Joseph , was at the door , and wished to speak with the master . "
87219	87227	87210	87210	I	0	" I said , in considerable trepidation . "
87258	87321	87252	87253	the master	430	" Joseph had advanced through the kitchen , as I uttered these words , and now presented himself in the hall . He was donned in his Sunday garments , with his most sanctimonious and sourest face ; and holding his hat in one hand , and his stick in the other , he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat . "
87327	87333	87325	87325	Joseph	45	" I said , coldly . "
87343	87344	87325	87325	Joseph	45	" "
87354	87363	87347	87349	Maister Linton Aw	51	" he answered , waving me disdainfully aside . "
87389	87393	87382	87382	he	73	" I continued . "
87409	87410	87404	87404	your	45	" "
87416	87525	87404	87404	your	45	" pursued the fellow , surveying the range of closed doors . I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation ; so very reluctantly , I went up to the library , and announced the unseasonable visiter ; advising that he should be dismissed till next day . Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so , for he mounted close at my heels , and pushing into the apartment , planted himself at the far side of the table , with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick , and began in an elevated tone , as if anticipating opposition . "
87544	87663	87542	87542	him	1658	" Edgar Linton was silent a minute ; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features ; he would have pitied the child on his own account ; but , recalling Isabella 's hopes and fears , and anxious wishes for her son , and her commendations of him to his care , he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up , and searched in his heart how it might be avoided . No plan offered itself : the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory : there was nothing left but to resign him . However , he was not going to rouse him from his sleep . "
87668	87674	87542	87542	him	1658	" he answered , calmly , "
87730	87731	87707	87710	the mother of Linton	1661	" "
87734	87754	87707	87710	the mother of Linton	1661	" said Joseph , giving a thud with his prop on the floor , and assuming an authoritative air . "
87793	87794	87795	87795	You	1660	" "
87802	87808	87795	87795	You	1660	" answered Linton , decisively . "
87833	87859	87889	87889	yah	1664	" And , aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm , he rid the room of him , and closed the door . "
87863	87873	87889	87889	yah	1664	" shouted Joseph , as he slowly drew off . "
87892	87924	87889	87889	yah	1664	" To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled , Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early , on Catherine 's pony , and , said he — "
88008	88085	88086	88087	My father	338	" Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed , at five o'clock , and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling : but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father , Mr. Heathcliff , who wished to see him so much , he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey . "
88089	88097	88086	88087	My father	338	" he cried , in strange perplexity . "
88119	88120	88121	88121	He	338	" "
88130	88134	88121	88121	He	338	" I replied , "
88190	88191	88185	88185	he	338	" "
88202	88206	88185	88185	he	338	" asked Linton ; "
88221	88222	88223	88223	He	338	" "
88233	88237	88223	88223	He	338	" I answered ; "
88251	88252	88244	88244	her	683	" "
88264	88269	88270	88270	She	141	" persevered the child . "
88298	88299	88292	88292	I	0	" "
88308	88312	88302	88303	all children	1684	" I said . "
88358	88359	88361	88361	she	141	" "
88367	88371	88361	88361	she	141	" he demanded . "
88379	88380	88372	88376	The little girl I saw	1688	" "
88384	88387	88389	88389	uncle	1673	" replied I. "
88391	88395	88389	88389	uncle	1673	" he continued . "
88405	88423	88398	88398	I	0	" I said . Linton sank back on his pillow , and fell into a brown study . "
88431	88437	88438	88438	I	0	" he cried at length ; "
88449	88589	88443	88443	you	0	" I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father : still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing ; and I had to call for my master 's assistance , in coaxing him out of bed . The poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short ; that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him ; and other promises , equally ill - founded , which I invented and reiterated , at intervals , throughout the way . The pure heather - scented air , and the bright sunshine , and the gentle canter of Minny relieved his despondency , after a while . He began to put questions concerning his new home , and its inhabitants , with greater interest , and liveliness . "
88601	88633	88443	88443	you	0	" he inquired , turning to take a last glance into the valley , whence a light mist mounted , and formed fleecy cloud , on the skirts of the blue . "
88642	88646	88443	88443	you	0	" I replied , "
88789	88790	88778	88778	he	1701	" "
88798	88802	88804	88804	he	338	" he asked . "
88812	88813	88804	88804	he	338	" "
88819	88822	88814	88814	He	338	" said I "
88897	88898	88881	88881	he	338	" "
88904	88908	88909	88909	I	0	" mused Linton . "
88925	88926	88923	88923	I	0	" "
88930	88990	88923	88923	I	0	" I answered . . .Not a morsel , I thought : surveying with regret the white complexion , and slim frame of my companion , and his large languid eyes . . .his mother 's eyes save that , unless a morbid touchiness kindled them , a moment , they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit . "
89004	89008	89010	89010	he	338	" he murmured . "
89035	89036	89033	89033	him	338	" "
89042	89046	89039	89040	Master Linton	73	" said I , "
89122	89278	89281	89281	Nelly	80	" The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride , till we halted before the farm - house garden gate . I watched to catch his impressions in his countenanance . He surveyed the carved front , and low - browed lattices ; the straggling gooseberry bushes , and crooked firs , with solemn intentness , and then shook his head : his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode ; but he had sense to postpone complaining — there might be compensation within . Before he dismounted , I went and opened the door . It was half - past six ; the family had just finished breakfast ; the servant was clearing and wiping down the table : Joseph stood by his master 's chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse ; and Hareton was preparing for the hay - field . "
89283	89293	89281	89281	Nelly	80	" cried Mr. Heathcliff , when he saw me . "
89325	89356	89313	89313	you	80	" He got up and strode to the door : Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity . Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three . "
89361	89386	89313	89313	you	80	" said Joseph after a grave inspection , ' he 's swopped wi ' ye , maister , an ' yon 's his lass ! "
89403	89417	89418	89418	he	43	" God ! what a beauty ! what a lovely , charming thing ! "
89421	89459	89418	89418	he	43	" Have n't they reared it on snails , and sour milk , Nelly ? Oh , damn my soul ! but that 's worse than I expected — and the devil knows I was not sanguine ! "
89532	89536	89512	89512	he	1714	" come hither , "
89548	89553	89555	89555	Heathcliff	43	" Tut , tut ! "
89579	89619	89620	89620	He	43	" None of that nonsense ! we 're not going to hurt thee , Linton — isn't that thy name ? Thou art thy mother 's child , entirely ! Where is my share in thee , puling chicken ? "
89664	89670	89672	89672	Heathcliff	43	" Do you know me ? "
89687	89690	89692	89692	Linton	142	" No ! "
89701	89712	89692	89692	Linton	142	" You 've heard of me , I dare say ? "
89713	89716	89717	89717	he	43	" No , "
89721	89855	89717	89717	he	43	" No ? What a shame of your mother , never to waken your filial regard for me ! You are my son , then , I 'll tell you ; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed — Now , do n't wince , and colour up ! Though it is something to see you have not white blood — Be a good lad ; and I 'll do for you — Nelly , if you be tired you may sit down , if not get home again — I guess you 'll report what you hear , and see , to the cipher at the Grange ; and this thing wo n't be settled while you linger about it . "
89856	89859	89861	89861	I	0	" Well , "
89863	89905	89861	89861	I	0	" I hope you 'll be kind to the boy , Mr. Heathcliff , or you 'll not keep him long , and he 's all you have akin , in the wide world that you will ever know — remember . "
89918	89923	89925	89926	nobody else	1721	" he said laughing . "
89970	89978	89968	89968	Nell	80	" he added when they were departed , "
90221	90305	90214	90219	the whey - faced whining wretch	1741	" While he was speaking , Joseph returned , bearing a basin of milk - porridge , and placed it before Linton . He stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion , and affirmed he could not eat it . I saw the old man servant shared largely in his master 's scorn of the child , though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart , because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour . "
90311	90335	90214	90219	the whey - faced whining wretch	1741	" repeated he , peering in Linton 's face , and subduing his voice to a whisper , for fear of being overheard . "
90369	90370	90362	90362	yah	1743	" "
90377	90383	90371	90371	I	0	" answered Linton , snappishly . "
90388	90402	90371	90371	I	0	" Joseph snatched up the food indignantly , and brought it to us . "
90411	90423	90371	90371	I	0	" he asked , thrusting the tray under Heathcliff 's nose . "
90429	90433	90371	90371	I	0	" he said . "
90436	90440	90445	90445	he	1745	" answered Joseph , "
90478	90479	90457	90458	His mother	2878	" "
90488	90495	90483	90484	his mother	2878	" said the master , angrily . "
90516	90637	90483	90484	his mother	2878	" I suggested boiled milk or tea ; and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some . Come , I reflected , his father 's selfishness may contribute to his comfort . He perceives his delicate constitution , and the necessity of treating him tolerably . I 'll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff 's humour has taken . Having no excuse for lingering longer , I slipped out , while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep - dog . But he was too much on the alert to be cheated — as I closed the door , I heard a cry , and a frantic repetition of the words — "
90655	90750	90649	90649	I	0	" Then the latch was raised and fell — they did not suffer him to come forth . I mounted Minny , and urged her to a trot ; and so my brief guardianship ended . We had sad work with little Cathy that day : she rose in high glee , eager to join her cousin ; and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure , that Edgar , himself , was obliged to sooth her , by affirming he should come back soon ; he added , however , "
90757	90990	90752	90752	I	0	" and there were no hopes of that . This promise poorly pacified her ; but time was more potent ; and though still , at intervals , she inquired of her father , when Linton would return ; before she did see him again , his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him . When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights , in paying business - visits to Gimmerton , I used to ask how the young master got on ; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself , and was never to be seen . I could gather from her that he continued in weak health , and was a tiresome inmate . She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse , though he took some trouble to conceal it . He had an antipathy to the sound of his voice , and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together . There seldom passed much talk between them ; Linton learnt his lessons , and spent his evenings in a small apartment , they called the parlour ; or else lay in bed all day ; for he was constantly getting coughs , and colds , and aches , and pains of some sort . "
91002	91007	90995	91000	such a faint - hearted creature	1750	" added the woman ; "
91252	91585	91245	91245	he	430	" I divined , from this account , that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable , if he were not so originally ; and my interest in him , consequently , decayed : though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot , and a wish that he had been left with us . Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information ; he thought a great deal about him , I fancy , and would have run some risk to see him ; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village ? She said he had only been twice , on horseback , accompanying his father : and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards . That housekeeper left , if I recollect rightly , two years after he came ; and another , whom I did not know , was her successor : she lives there still . Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way , till Miss Cathy reached sixteen . On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing , because it was , also , the anniversary of my late mistress 's death . Her father invariably spent that day alone in the library ; and walked , at dusk , as far as Gimmerton kirkyard , where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight . Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement . This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day , and when her father had retired , my young lady came down dressed for going out , and said she had asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moors with me ; and Mr. Linton had given her leave , if we went only a short distance , and were back within the hour . "
91592	91596	91597	91597	I	0	" she cried . "
91626	91627	91614	91614	I	0	" "
91636	91640	91614	91614	I	0	" I answered ; "
91652	91653	91614	91614	I	0	" "
91660	91664	91614	91614	I	0	" she said . "
91673	91808	91671	91671	papa	2871	" I put on my bonnet , and sallied out ; thinking nothing more of the matter . She bounded before me , and returned to my side , and was off again like a young greyhound ; and , at first , I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near ; and enjoying the sweet , warm sunshine ; and watching her , my pet , and my delight , with her golden ringlets flying loose behind , and her bright cheek , as soft and pure in its bloom , as a wild rose , and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure . She was a happy creature , and an angel , in those days . It 's a pity she could not be content . "
91811	91815	91671	91671	papa	2871	" said I , "
91844	91845	91857	91857	Ellen	80	" "
91859	91866	91857	91857	Ellen	80	" was her answer , continually . "
91893	92057	91886	91886	I	0	" But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass , that , at length , I began to be weary , and told her we must halt , and retrace our steps . I shouted to her , as she had outstripped me , a long way ; she either did not hear , or did not regard , for she still sprang on , and I was compelled to follow . Finally , she dived into a hollow ; and before I came in sight of her again , she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home ; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her , one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself . Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering , or , at least , hunting out the nests of the grouse . The Heights were Heathcliff 's land , and he was reproving the poacher . "
92067	92086	92058	92058	I	0	" she said , as I toiled to them , expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement . "
92113	92144	92096	92096	papa	2871	" Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill - meaning smile , expressing his acquaintance with the party , and , consequently , his malevolence towards it , and demanded who "
92146	92149	92150	92154	Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange	73	" was ? "
92156	92160	92150	92154	Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange	73	" she replied . "
92179	92180	92170	92170	you	73	" "
92191	92197	92181	92181	You	0	" he said , sarcastically . "
92203	92213	92201	92201	you	73	" inquired Catherine , gazing curiously on the speaker . "
92226	92263	92264	92265	Miss Cathy	56	" She pointed to Hareton , the other individual ; who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition two years to his age : he seemed as awkward and rough as ever . "
92267	92271	92264	92265	Miss Cathy	56	" I interrupted , "
92294	92295	92288	92288	We	1768	" "
92305	92313	92288	92288	We	1768	" answered Heathcliff , pushing me aside . "
92384	92411	92447	92447	he	0	" I whispered Catherine , that she must n't , on any account , accede to the proposal ; it was entirely out of the question . "
92414	92420	92421	92421	I	0	" she asked , aloud . "
92486	92487	92488	92488	I	0	" "
92527	92528	92525	92525	Nelly	80	" "
92540	92594	92531	92531	she	1778	" I cried , struggling to release my arm which he had seized ; but she was almost at the door - stones already , scampering round the brow at full speed . Her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her ; he shyed off by the road side , and vanished . "
92603	92607	92608	92608	you	43	" I continued , "
92642	92643	92644	92644	I	0	" "
92651	92694	92644	92644	I	0	" he answered : he 's looking better these few days ; it 's not not often he 's fit to be seen . And we 'll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret — where is the harm of it ? "
92695	92736	92737	92737	I	0	" The harm of it is , that her father would hate me , if he found I suffered her to enter your house ; and I am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so , "
92740	92758	92759	92759	he	1782	" My design is as honest as possible . I 'll inform you of its whole scope , "
92762	92813	92759	92759	he	1782	" That the two cousins may fall in love , and get married . I 'm acting generously to your master ; his young chit has no expectations , and should she second my wishes , she 'll be provided for , at once , as joint successor with Linton . "
92814	92819	92820	92820	I	0	" If Linton died , "
92823	92837	92820	92820	I	0	" and his life is quite uncertain , Catherine would be the heir . "
92838	92845	92846	92846	he	1782	" No , she would not , "
92849	92888	92846	92846	he	1782	" There is no clause in the will to secure it so ; his property would go to me ; but , to prevent disputes , I desire their union , and am resolved to bring it about . "
92889	92904	92905	92905	I	0	" And I 'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again , "
93082	93089	93091	93092	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" Now , who is that ? "
93098	93103	93091	93092	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" Can you tell ? "
93104	93108	93109	93109	she	56	" Your son ? "
93124	93129	93131	93131	he	43	" Yes , yes , "
93133	93177	93131	93131	he	43	" but is this the only time you have beheld him ? Think ! Ah ! you have a short memory . Linton , do n't you recall your cousin , that you used to tease us so , with wishing to see ? "
93178	93183	93185	93185	Cathy	56	" What , Linton ! "
93195	93213	93214	93215	The youth	293	" Is that little Linton ? He 's taller than I am ! Are you , Linton ? "
93361	93370	93371	93371	she	56	" And you are my uncle , then ! "
93380	93395	93371	93371	she	56	" I thought I liked you , though you were cross , at first . "
93431	93432	93426	93426	you	56	" "
93446	93450	93433	93433	I	0	" he answered . "
93476	93477	93478	93479	Naughty Ellen	145	" "
93481	93495	93496	93497	Wicked Ellen	80	" exclaimed Catherine , flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses . "
93538	93539	93531	93531	you	1673	" "
93543	93565	93531	93531	you	1673	" replied the uncle , with a hardly surpressed grimace , resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visiters . "
93569	93579	93531	93531	you	1673	" he continued , turning towards the young lady . "
93666	93667	93670	93670	you	0	" "
93673	93682	93670	93670	you	0	" asked Catherine , considerably crest - fallen . "
93694	93698	93683	93683	He	73	" answered Heathcliff , "
93719	93720	93713	93713	he	73	" "
93725	93731	93713	93713	he	73	" said the young lady : "
93766	93767	93759	93759	he	73	" "
93776	93781	93759	93759	he	73	" murmured her cousin , "
93813	93826	93827	93827	I	0	" The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt . "
93839	93845	93846	93847	Miss Catherine	56	" he muttered to me . "
93967	93968	93965	93965	Linton	56	" "
93973	93978	93971	93971	father	552	" answered the boy . "
94022	94030	94032	94032	Linton	56	" Would n't you rather sit here ? "
94046	94052	94053	94053	she	56	" I do n't know , "
94138	94148	94150	94151	Miss Cathy	56	" Oh , I 'll ask you , uncle ; "
94159	94169	94150	94151	Miss Cathy	56	" That 's not my cousin , is he ? "
94170	94173	94174	94174	he	259	" Yes , "
94177	94189	94174	94174	he	259	" your mother 's nephew . Do n't you like him ? "
94194	94202	94203	94203	he	259	" Is he not a handsome lad ? "
94260	94370	94371	94371	He	1819	" You 'll be the favourite among us , Hareton ! She says you are a — What was it ? Well , something very flattering — Here ! you go with her round the farm . And behave like a gentleman , mind ! Do n't use any bad words ; and do n't stare , when the young lady is not looking at you , and be ready to hide your face when she is ; and , when you speak , say your words slowly , and keep your hands out of your pockets . Be off , and entertain her as nicely as you can . "
94448	94455	94457	94457	Heathcliff	43	" I 've tied his tongue , "
94459	94504	94457	94457	Heathcliff	43	" He 'll not venture a single syllable , all the time ! Nelly , you recollect me at his age — nay , some years younger — Did I ever look so stupid , so ' gaumless , ' as Joseph calls it . "
94505	94508	94509	94509	I	0	" Worse , "
94512	94519	94509	94509	I	0	" because more sullen with it . "
94520	94528	94529	94529	he	43	" I 've a pleasure in him ! "
94534	94857	94529	94529	he	43	" He has satisfied my expectations — If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much — But he 's no fool ; and I can sympathise with all his feelings , having felt them myself — I know what he suffers now , for instance , exactly — it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer , though . And he 'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness , and ignorance . I 've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me , and lower ; for he takes a pride in his brutishness , I 've taught him to scorn everything , extra - animal , as silly and weak — Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son , if he could see him ? almost as proud as I am of mine — But there 's this difference , one is gold put to the use of paving stones ; and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver — Mine has nothing valuable about it ; yet I shall have the merit , of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go . His had first - rate qualities , and they are lost — rendered worse than unavailing — I have nothing to regret ; he would have more than any , but I , are aware of — And the best of it is , Hareton is damnably fond of me ! You 'll own that I 've out - matched Hindley there — If the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring 's wrongs , I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again , indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world ! "
94946	94954	94955	94955	he	518	" Get up , you idle boy ! "
94961	94980	94955	94955	he	518	" Away after them . . .they are just at the corner , by the stand of hives . "
95032	95039	95040	95040	he	1825	" It 's some damnable writing ; "
95043	95050	95040	95040	he	1825	" I can not read it . "
95051	95057	95059	95059	Catherine	56	" Ca n't read it ? "
95061	95084	95059	95059	Catherine	56	" I can read it . . .It 's English . . .but I want to know , why it is there . "
95097	95105	95106	95106	he	1825	" He does not know his letters , "
95112	95125	95106	95106	he	1825	" Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce ? "
95126	95135	95137	95138	Miss Cathy	56	" Is he all as he should be ? "
95141	95183	95186	95186	his	1825	" or is he simple . . .not right ? I 've questioned him twice now , and each time he looked so stupid , I think he does not understand me ; I can hardly understand him I 'm sure ! "
95209	95224	95225	95225	he	47	" There 's nothing the matter , but laziness , is there , Earnshaw ? "
95228	95245	95225	95225	he	47	" My cousin fancies you are an idiot . . .There you experience the consequence of scorning "
95250	95268	95225	95225	he	47	" as you would say . . .Have you noticed , Catherine , his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation ? "
95269	95280	95282	95282	Hareton	47	" Why , where the devil is the use on't ? "
95330	95342	95344	95344	Linton	56	" Where is the use of the devil in that sentence ? "
95346	95379	95344	95344	Linton	56	" Papa told you not to say any bad words , and you ca n't open your mouth without one . . .Do try to behave like a gentleman , now do ! "
95380	95407	95409	95412	the angry boor retreating	1833	" If thou wern't more a lass than a lad , I 'd fell thee this minute , I would ; pitiful lath of a crater ! "
95621	95624	95625	95625	she	56	" Aha ! "
95628	95715	95625	95625	she	56	" you take papa 's side , Ellen — you are partial . . .I know , or else you would n't have cheated me so many years , into the notion that Linton lived a long way from here . I 'm really extremely angry , only , I 'm so pleased , I ca n't show it ! But you must hold your tongue about my uncle . . .he 's my uncle remember , and I 'll scold papa for quarrelling with him . "
95826	95829	95830	95830	she	56	" Papa ! "
95838	95920	95921	95921	She	56	" guess whom I saw yesterday , in my walk on the moors . . .Ah , papa , you started ! you 've not done right , have you , now ? I saw — But listen , and you shall hear how I found you out , and Ellen , who is in league with you , and yet pretended to pity me so , when I kept hoping , and was always disappointed about Linton 's coming back ! "
95995	96004	96005	96005	she	56	" It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff , "
96008	96024	96025	96025	he	530	" Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours , Cathy ? "
96028	96146	96025	96025	he	530	" No , it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff ; but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me ; and is a most diabolical man , delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates , if they give him the slightest opportunity . I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin , without being brought into contact with him ; and I knew he would detest you , on my account ; so , for your own good , and nothing else , I took precautions that you should not see Linton again — I meant to explain this sometime as you grew older , and I 'm sorry I delayed it ! "
96147	96157	96159	96159	Catherine	56	" But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial , papa , "
96166	96248	96159	96159	Catherine	56	" and he did n't object to our seeing each other : he said I might come to his house , when I pleased , only I must not tell you , because you had quarrelled with him , and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella . And you won't — you are the one to be blamed — he is willing to let us be friends , at least ; Linton and I — and you are not . "
96336	96352	96354	96354	his	530	" She might have been living yet , if it had not been for him ! "
96480	96516	96476	96476	He	91	" You will know hereafter , darling , why I wish you to avoid his house and family — now , return to your old employments and amusements , and think no more about them ! "
96596	96600	96593	96594	silly child	1856	" I exclaimed . "
96687	96688	96689	96689	I	0	" "
96698	96702	96689	96689	I	0	" she answered , "
96741	96742	96729	96729	he	1857	" "
96745	96749	96751	96751	you	56	" said I , "
96812	96813	96797	96797	Linton	56	" "
96830	96838	96816	96816	I	0	" she asked rising to her feet . "
96883	96884	96881	96881	Ellen	80	" "
96892	96898	96881	96881	Ellen	80	" replied I with decision . "
96941	96942	96933	96933	I	0	" "
96950	96960	96881	96881	Ellen	80	" she recommenced , putting on an imploring countenance . "
96963	96967	96881	96881	Ellen	80	" I interrupted . "
96981	97071	97072	97072	You	56	" She threw at me a very naughty look , so naughty that I would not kiss her good - night at first : I covered her up , and shut her door , in great displeasure — but , repenting half - way , I returned softly , and lo ! there was Miss , standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her , and a pencil in her hand , which she guiltily slipped out of sight , on my re - entrance . "
97082	97086	97080	97080	Catherine	56	" I said , "
97102	97126	97095	97095	I	0	" I set the extinguisher on the flame , receiving as I did so , a slap on my hand , and a petulant "
97130	97858	97095	97095	I	0	" I then quitted her again , and she drew the bolt in one of her worst , most peevish humours . The letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk - fetcher who came from the village , but that I did n't learn till some time afterwards . Weeks passed on , and Cathy recovered her temper , though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself , and often , if I came near her suddenly while reading she would start , and bend over the book , evidently desirous to hide it ; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves . She also got a trick of coming down early in the morning , and lingering about the kitchen , as if she were expecting the arrival of something ; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which she would trifle over for hours , and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it . One day , as she inspected this drawer , I observed that the play - things , and trinkets which recently formed its contents , were transmuted into bits of folded paper . My curiosity and suspicions were roused ; I determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures ; so , at night , as soon as she and my master were safe up stairs , I searched and readily found among my house keys , one that would fit the lock . Having opened , I emptied the whole contents into my apron , and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber . Though I could not but suspect , I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence , daily almost , it must have been , from Linton Heathcliff , answers to documents forwarded by her . The earlier dated were embarrassed and short ; gradually however they expanded into copious love letters , foolish as the age of the writer rendered natural , yet with touches , here and there , which I thought , were borrowed from a more experienced source . Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour , and flatness ; commencing in strong feeling , and concluding in the affected , wordy way that a school - boy might use to a fancied , incorporeal sweetheart . Whether they satisfied Cathy , I do n't know , but they appeared very worthless trash to me . After turning over as many as I thought proper , I tied them in a handkerchief , and set them aside , re - locking the vacant drawer . Following her habit , my young lady descended early , and visited the kitchen : I watched her go to the door , on the arrival of a certain little boy ; and , while the dairy maid filled his can , she tucked something into his jacket pocket , and plucked something out . I went round by the garden , and laid wait for the messenger ; who fought valorously to defend his trust , and we spilt the milk between us ; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle ; and threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home , I remained under the wall , and perused Miss Cathy 's affectionate composition . It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin 's , very pretty and very silly . I shook my head , and went meditating into the house . The day being wet , she could not divert herself with rambling about the park ; so , at the conclusion of her morning studies , she resorted to the solace of the drawer . Her father sat reading at the table ; and I , on purpose , had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain , keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings . Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brim - ful of chirping young ones , express more complete despair in its anguished cries , and flutterings , than she by her single "
97861	97877	97095	97095	I	0	" And the change that transfigured her late happy countenance . Mr. Linton looked up . "
97890	97911	97912	97913	No papa	1865	" he said . His tone and look , assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard . "
97915	97919	97920	97920	Ellen	80	" she gasped . "
97932	97943	97946	97946	Ellen	80	" I obeyed her summons , and accompanied her out . "
97953	97969	97948	97948	you	80	" she commenced immediately , dropping on her knees , when we were enclosed alone . "
98019	98034	98011	98011	I	0	" With a grave severity in my manner , I bid her stand up . "
98148	98149	98150	98150	I	0	" "
98158	98168	98154	98154	I	0	" sobbed Cathy , fit to break her heart . "
98179	98180	98169	98169	I	0	" "
98183	98196	98169	98169	I	0	" cried I , as scornfully as I could utter the word . "
98275	98343	98268	98269	your father	2760	" She sprang at her precious epistles , but I held them above my head ; and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them — do anything rather than show them . And being really fully as inclined to laugh as scold , for I esteemed it all girlish vanity , I at length , relented in a measure , and asked , "
98390	98391	98392	98392	We	1872	" "
98398	98408	98392	98392	We	1872	" cried Catherine , her pride overcoming her shame . "
98419	98423	98392	98392	We	1872	" I said . "
98432	98433	98434	98434	I	0	" "
98439	98446	98437	98437	Ellen	80	" she cried catching my dress . "
98458	98492	98497	98497	Ellen	80	" But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker , the sacrifice was too painful to be borne — She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her one or two . "
98506	98529	98530	98530	I	0	" I unknotted the handkerchief , and commenced dropping them in from an angle , and the flame curled up the chimney . "
98539	98565	98535	98537	you cruel wretch	1876	" she screamed , darting her hand into the fire , and drawing forth some half consumed fragments , at the expense of her fingers . "
98579	98597	98598	98598	She	80	" I answered shaking back the rest into the bundle , and turning anew to the door . "
98724	98744	98713	98713	I	0	" Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton as she will not receive them . "
99339	99344	99345	99345	I	0	" Look , Miss ! "
99360	99411	99345	99345	I	0	" Winter is not here yet . There 's a little flower , up yonder , the last bud from the multitude of blue - bells that clouded those turf steps in July with a lilac mist . Will you clamber up , and pluck it to show to papa ? "
99433	99453	99412	99412	Cathy	56	" No , I 'll not touch it — but it looks melancholy , does it not , Ellen ? "
99454	99457	99458	99458	I	0	" Yes , "
99461	99499	99458	99458	I	0	" about as starved and sackless as you — your cheeks are bloodless ; let us take hold of hands and run . You 're so low , I dare say I shall keep up with you . "
99500	99503	99504	99504	she	3319	" No , "
99561	99571	99572	99572	I	0	" Catherine , why are you crying , love ? "
99584	99603	99604	99604	She	3319	" You must n't cry , because papa has a cold ; be thankful it is nothing worse . "
99621	99630	99631	99631	she	3319	" Oh , it will be something worse , "
99634	99689	99631	99631	she	3319	" And what shall I do when papa and you leave me , and I am by myself ? I ca n't forget your words , Ellen , they are always in my ear . How life will be changed , how dreary the world will be , when papa and you are dead . "
99690	99703	99704	99704	I	0	" None can tell , whether you wo nt die before us , "
99707	99795	99704	99704	I	0	" It 's wrong to anticipate evil — we'll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go — master is young , and I am strong , and hardly forty - five . My mother lived till eighty , a canty dame to the last . And suppose Mr. Linton were spared till he saw sixty , that would be more years than you have counted , Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand ? "
99796	99805	99806	99806	she	1895	" But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa , "
99819	99831	99832	99832	I	0	" Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her , "
99835	99952	99832	99832	I	0	" She was n't as happy as master ; she had n't as much to live for . All you need do , is to wait well on your father , and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful ; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject — mind that , Cathy ! I 'll not disguise , but you might kill him , if you were wild and reckless , and cherished a foolish , fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave — and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation , he has judged it expedient to make . "
99953	99965	99967	99968	my companion	350	" I fret about nothing on earth except papa 's illness , "
99970	100057	99967	99968	my companion	350	" I care for nothing in comparison with papa . And I 'll never — never — oh , never , while I have my senses , do an act , or say a word to vex him . I love him better than myself , Ellen ; and I know it by this — I pray every night that I may live after him ; because I would rather be miserable than that he should be — that proves I love him better than myself . "
100058	100062	100063	100063	I	0	" Good words , "
100066	100093	100063	100063	I	0	" But deeds must prove it also ; and after he is well , remember you do n't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear . "
100270	100303	100264	100264	her	3319	" Ellen ! you 'll have to fetch the key , or else I must run round to the porter 's lodge . I ca n't scale the ramparts on this side ! "
100304	100310	100311	100311	I	0	" Stay where you are , "
100314	100340	100311	100311	I	0	" I have my bundle of keys in my pocket ; perhaps I may manage to open it , if not , I 'll go . "
100428	100433	100434	100434	I	0	" Who is that ? "
100437	100448	100434	100434	I	0	" Ellen , I wish you could open the door , "
100456	100462	100464	100466	a deep voice	1907	" Ho , Miss Linton ! "
100474	100500	100464	100466	a deep voice	1907	" I 'm glad to meet you . Do n't be in haste to enter , for I have an explanation to ask and obtain . "
100501	100512	100514	100514	Catherine	56	" I sha nt speak to you , Mr. Heathcliff ! "
100516	100539	100464	100466	a deep voice	1907	" Papa says you are a wicked man , and you hate both him and me ; and Ellen says the same . "
100540	100548	100550	100550	Heathcliff	43	" That is nothing to the purpose , "
100558	100777	100550	100550	Heathcliff	43	" I do n't hate my son , I suppose , and it is concerning him , that I demand your attention . Yes ! you have cause to blush . Two or three months since , were you not in the habit of writing to Linton ? making love in play , eh ? You deserved , both of you , flogging for that ! You especially , the elder , and less sensitive , as it turns out . I 've got your letters , and if you give me any pertness , I 'll send them to your father . I presume you grew weary of the amusement , and dropped it , did n't you ? Well , you dropped Linton with it , into a Slough of Despond . He was in earnest — in love — really . As true as I live , he 's dying for you — breaking his heart at your fickleness , not figuratively , but actually . Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks , and I have used more serious measures , and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy , he gets worse daily , and he 'll be under the sod before summer , unless you restore him ! "
100778	100790	100791	100791	I	0	" How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child ! "
100797	100853	100791	100791	I	0	" Pray ride on ! How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods ? Miss Cathy , I 'll knock the lock off with a stone , you wo nt believe that vile nonsense . You can feel in yourself , it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger . "
100854	100865	100867	100869	the detected villain	1909	" I was not aware there were eaves - droppers , "
100871	100889	100890	100890	he	1909	" Worthy Mrs. Dean , I like you , but I do n't like your double dealing , "
100895	101047	100890	100890	he	1909	" How could you lie so glaringly , as to affirm I hated the ' poor child ? ' And invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door - stones ? Catherine Linton , ( the very name warms me ) , my bonny lass , I shall be from home all this week , go and see if I have not spoken truth ; do , there 's a darling ! Just imagine your father in my place , and Linton in yours ; then think how you would value your careless lover , if he refused to stir a step to comfort you , when your father , himself , entreated him ; and do n't , from pure stupidity , fall into the same error . I swear , on my salvation , he 's going to his grave , and none but you can save him ! "
101058	101065	101067	101067	Heathcliff	43	" I swear Linton is dying , "
101074	101126	101067	101067	Heathcliff	43	" And grief and disappointment are hastening his death . Nelly , if you wo nt let her go , you can walk over yourself . But I shall not return till this time next week ; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin ! "
101127	101131	101133	101133	I	0	" Come in , "
101186	101289	101173	101173	He	2714	" Miss Catherine , I 'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton — and Hareton and Joseph have less . I 'll own that he 's with a harsh set . He pines for kindness , as well as love ; and a kind word from you would be his best medicine . Do n't mind Mrs. Dean 's cruel cautions , but be generous , and contrive to see him . He dreams of you day and night , and can not be persuaded that you do n't hate him , since you neither write nor call . "
101557	101565	101566	101566	she	56	" You may be right , Ellen , "
101569	101606	101566	101566	she	56	" but I shall never feel at ease till I know — and I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I do n't write ; and convince him that I shall not change . "
101861	101866	101867	101867	he	2774	" Na — ay ! "
101877	101891	101867	101867	he	2774	" Na — ay ! yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough . "
101892	101895	101935	101935	Vigorous	150	" Joseph , "
101910	101934	101935	101935	Vigorous	150	" How often am I to call you ? There are only a few red ashes now . Joseph ! come this moment . "
101984	102000	102002	102003	the boy	2803	" Oh , I hope you 'll die in a garret ! starved to death , "
102029	102037	102038	102038	he	2774	" Is that you , Miss Linton ? "
102057	102078	102080	102080	he	2774	" No — don't kiss me . It takes my breath — dear me ! Papa said you would call , "
102099	102134	102092	102092	she	56	" Will you shut the door , if you please ? you left it open — and those — those detestable creatures wo nt bring coals to the fire . It 's so cold ! "
102178	102183	102185	102185	Catherine	56	" Well , Linton , "
102193	102208	102185	102185	Catherine	56	" Are you glad to see me ? Can I do you any good ? "
102209	102217	102218	102218	he	2774	" Why did n't you come before ? "
102221	102285	102218	102218	he	2774	" You should have come , instead of writing . It tired me dreadfully , writing those long letters . I 'd far rather have talked to you . Now , I can neither bear to talk , nor anything else . I wonder where Zillah is ! will you , ( looking at me , ) step into the kitchen and see ? "
102311	102319	102308	102308	I	0	" Nobody is out there but Joseph . "
102320	102326	102327	102327	he	2774	" I want to drink , "
102335	102369	102327	102327	he	2774	" Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went . It 's miserable ! And I 'm obliged to come down here — they resolved never to hear me up stairs . "
102370	102381	102382	102382	I	0	" Is your father attentive to you . Master Heathcliff ? "
102395	102409	102410	102410	he	2774	" Attentive ? He makes them a little more attentive , at least , "
102413	102447	102410	102410	he	2774	" The wretches ! Do you know . Miss Linton , that brute Hareton laughs at me — I hate him — indeed , I hate them all — they are odious beings . "
102505	102514	102516	102516	she	56	" And are you glad to see me ? "
102534	102551	102552	102552	he	2774	" Yes , I am — It 's something new to hear a voice like yours ! "
102555	102631	102552	102552	he	2774	" but I have been vexed , because you would n't come — And papa swore it was owing to me ; he called me a pitiful , shuffling , worthless thing ; and said you despised me ; and if he had been in my place , he would be more the master of the Grange than your father , by this time . But you do n't despise me , do you Miss — "
102632	102643	102645	102647	my young lady	3319	" I wish you would say Catherine , or Cathy ! "
102649	102695	102645	102647	my young lady	3319	" Despise you ? No ! Next to papa , and Ellen , I love you better than anybody living . I do n't love Mr. Heathcliff , though ; and I dare not come when he returns ; will he stay away many days ? "
102696	102700	102702	102702	Linton	56	" Not many : "
102769	102770	102767	102767	you	3319	" "
102773	102782	102767	102767	you	3319	" said Catherine stroking his long soft hair , "
102811	102812	102806	102806	you	3319	" "
102825	102831	102815	102815	you	0	" observed he more cheerfully . "
102862	102863	102855	102855	I	0	" "
102875	102880	102866	102866	I	0	" she returned gravely . "
102924	102987	102988	102988	Papa	133	" Linton denied that people ever hated their wives ; but Cathy affirmed they did , and in her wisdom , instanced his own father 's aversion to her aunt . I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue — I could n't succeed , till everything she knew was out . Master Heathcliff , much irritated , asserted her relation was false . "
102999	103004	103005	103006	My papa	1952	" she answered pertly . "
103010	103014	103015	103015	He	1952	" cried Linton . "
103022	103023	103015	103015	He	1952	" "
103030	103063	103073	103074	the boy	2803	" retorted Catherine , and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says — He must be wicked , to have made aunt Isabella leave him as she did ! "
103064	103071	103073	103074	the boy	2803	" She did n't leave him , "
103076	103083	103073	103074	the boy	2803	" you sha n't contradict me ! "
103084	103088	103090	103092	my young lady	3319	" She did ! "
103094	103102	103104	103104	Linton	56	" Well I 'll tell you something ! "
103105	103115	103073	103074	the boy	2803	" Your mother hated your father , now then . "
103116	103119	103121	103121	Catherine	56	" Oh ! "
103128	103134	103136	103136	he	2803	" And she loved mine ! "
103138	103148	103149	103149	she	56	" You little liar ! I hate you now , "
103160	103167	103169	103169	Linton	56	" She did ! she did ! "
103195	103201	103202	103202	I	0	" Hush , Master Heathcliff ! "
103205	103217	103202	103202	I	0	" that 's your father 's tale too , I suppose . "
103218	103227	103228	103228	he	2803	" It isn't — you hold your tongue ! "
103231	103246	103228	103228	he	2803	" she did , she did , Catherine , she did , she did ! "
103247	103361	103202	103202	I	0	" Cathy , beside herself , gave the chair a violent push , and caused him to fall against one arm . He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph . It lasted so long , that it frightened even me . As to his cousin , she wept with all her might , aghast at the mischief she had done , though she said nothing . I held him , till the fit exhausted itself . Then he thrust me away ; and leant his head down , silently — Catherine quelled her lamentations also , took a seat opposite , and looked solemnly into the fire . "
103371	103379	103364	103364	you	1959	" I inquired after waiting ten minutes . "
103388	103392	103382	103382	she	1960	" he replied , "
103422	103430	103431	103431	I	0	" his voice died in a whimper . "
103437	103503	103431	103431	I	0	" muttered Cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion . He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering ; and kept it up for a quarter of an hour , on purpose to distress his cousin , apparently , for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her , he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice . "
103513	103523	103511	103511	Linton	56	" she said at length , racked beyond endurance . "
103576	103577	103578	103578	I	0	" "
103585	103589	103590	103590	you	0	" he murmured , "
103650	103663	103641	103641	you	0	" And he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself . "
103675	103679	103665	103665	you	1959	" I said , "
103723	103724	103703	103703	she	1963	" "
103729	103738	103703	103703	she	1963	" asked Catherine dolefully , bending over him . "
103748	103749	103740	103740	you	1959	" "
103758	103767	103769	103769	you	0	" he replied pettishly , shrinking from her , "
103783	103784	103769	103769	you	0	" "
103792	103796	103788	103788	I	0	" she repeated . "
103804	103807	103798	103798	me	0	" said he "
103815	103959	103808	103808	I	0	" She lingered , and resisted my persuasions to departure , a tiresome while , but as he neither looked up , nor spoke , she finally made a movement to the door and I followed . We were recalled by a scream — Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone , and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child , determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can . I thoroughly guaged his disposition from his behaviour , and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him . Not so my companion , she ran back in terror , knelt down , and cried , and soothed , and entreated , till he grew quiet from lack of breath , by no means from compunction at distressing her . "
103969	103973	103960	103960	I	0	" I said , "
104056	104104	104105	104105	I	0	" She placed a cushion under his head , and offered him some water , he rejected the latter , and tossed uneasily on the former , as if it were a stone , or a block of wood . She tried to put it more comfortably . "
104112	104116	104105	104105	I	0	" he said , "
104123	104132	104105	104105	I	0	" Catherine brought another to lay above it . "
104138	104144	104105	104105	I	0	" murmured the provoking thing . "
104153	104181	104147	104147	I	0	" she asked despairingly . He twined himself up to her , as she half knelt by the settle , and converted her shoulder into a support . "
104189	104193	104147	104147	I	0	" I said . "
104224	104225	104230	104230	we	1970	" "
104233	104237	104238	104238	He	43	" replied Cathy . "
104304	104305	104294	104294	I	0	" "
104314	104318	104319	104319	You	0	" he answered . "
104355	104356	104353	104353	I	0	" "
104372	104373	104358	104358	you	0	" "
104381	104386	104374	104374	I	0	" said his cousin . "
104410	104411	104396	104396	you	0	" "
104419	104424	104416	104416	I	0	" he replied impatiently . "
104502	104558	104564	104564	Catherine	56	" Catherine repeated the longest she could remember . The employment pleased both mightily . Linton would have another , and after that another ; notwithstanding my strenuous objections ; and so , they went on , until the clock struck twelve , and we heard Hareton in the court , returning for his dinner . "
104574	104588	104564	104564	Catherine	56	" asked young Heathcliff , holding her frock , as she rose reluctantly . "
104591	104595	104564	104564	Catherine	56	" I answered , "
104601	104627	104628	104628	You	56	" She however , gave a different response , evidently , for his forehead cleared , as she stooped , and whispered in his ear . "
104640	104651	104638	104638	Miss	1974	" I commenced when we were out of the house . "
104662	104666	104660	104660	you	56	" She smiled . "
104675	104679	104669	104669	I	0	" I continued , "
104696	104697	104669	104669	I	0	" "
104705	104710	104698	104698	I	0	" she said laughing . "
104838	104839	104832	104832	you	80	" "
104843	104847	104841	104841	him	1979	" I exclaimed . "
104941	104962	104938	104939	Miss Catherine	56	" My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech — To speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings . "
104969	104980	104963	104963	He	1979	" she answered , after a protracted pause of meditation , "
105049	105050	105036	105036	You	0	" "
105055	105059	105036	105036	You	0	" I cried , "
105120	105121	105106	105106	he	73	" "
105127	105132	105106	105106	he	73	" muttered Cathy sulkily . "
105140	105144	105145	105145	We	1989	" I said . "
105149	105427	105145	105145	We	1989	" was her reply , and she set off at a gallop , leaving me to toil in the rear . We both reached home before our dinner - time : my master supposed we had been wandering through the park , and therefore , he demanded no explanation of our absence . As soon as I entered , I hastened to change my soaked shoes , and stockings ; but sitting such a while at the Heights , had done the mischief . On the succeeding morning , I was laid up ; and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties — a calamity never experienced prior to that period , and , never I am thankful to say since . My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me , and cheer my solitude : the confinement brought me exceedingly low — It is wearisome , to a stirring active body — but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had . The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton 's room , she appeared at my bed - side . Her day was divided between us ; no amusement usurped a minute : she neglected her meals , her studies , and her play ; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched : she must have had a warm heart , when she loved her father so , to give so much to me ! I said her days were divided between us ; but the master retired early , and I generally needed nothing after six o'clock , thus the evening was her own . "
105615	105643	105594	105594	She	1992	" Ellen , are not you tired ? Had n't you better lie down now ? You 'll be sick , keeping up so long , Ellen . "
105644	105656	105657	105657	I	0	" No , no , dear , I 'm not tired , "
105690	105697	105666	105666	she	1992	" Ellen , I 'm tired . "
105698	105705	105706	105706	I	0	" Give over then and talk , "
106102	106108	106109	106109	I	0	" My dear Miss Catherine , "
106125	106157	106109	106109	I	0	" where have you been riding out at this hour ? And why should you try to deceive me , by telling a tale . Where have you been ? Speak ! "
106158	106166	106167	106167	she	56	" To the bottom of the park , "
106170	106178	106167	106167	she	56	" I did n't tell a tale . "
106179	106185	106186	106186	I	0	" And no where else ? "
106189	106192	106186	106186	I	0	" No , "
106198	106203	106204	106204	I	0	" Oh , Catherine , "
106209	106252	106204	106204	I	0	" You know you have been doing wrong , or you would n't be driven to uttering an untruth to me . That does grieve me . I 'd rather be three months ill , than hear you frame a deliberate lie . "
106269	106282	106283	106283	she	56	" Well Ellen , I 'm so afraid of you being angry , "
106286	106307	106283	106283	she	56	" Promise not to be angry , and you shall know the very truth . I hate to hide it . "
106343	106634	106340	106340	she	56	" I 've been to Wuthering Heights , Ellen , and I 've never missed going a day since you fell ill ; except thrice before , and twice after you left your room . I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening , and to put her back in the stable ; you must n't scold him either , mind . I was at the Heights by half - past six , and generally stayed till half - past eight , and then gallopped home . It was not to amuse myself that I went ; I was often wretched all the time . Now and then , I was happy , once in a week perhaps . At first , I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton , for I had engaged to call again next day , when we quitted him ; but , as you stayed up stairs on the morrow , I escaped that trouble ; and while Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon , I got possession of the key , and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him , because he was sick , and could n't come to the Grange : and how papa would object to my going . And then I negotiated with him about the pony . He is fond of reading , and he thinks of leaving soon to get married , so he offered , if I would lend him books out of the library , to do what I wished ; but I preferred giving him my own , and that satisfied him better . "
106706	106787	106695	106695	I	0	" She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread ; and appeared exceedingly good - natured ; and Linton sat in the arm - chair , and I in the little rocking chair , on the hearthstone , and we laughed and talked so merrily , and found so much to say ; we planned where we would go , and what we would do in summer . I need n't repeat that , because you would call it silly . "
106986	107233	107234	107234	I	0	" I said his heaven would be only half alive , and he said mine would be drunk ; I said I should fall asleep in his , and he said he could not breathe in mine , and began to grow very snappish . At last , we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came ; and then we kissed each other and were friends . After sitting still an hour , I looked at the great room with its smooth , uncarpeted floor ; and thought how nice it would be to play in , if we removed the table ; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us — and we 'd have a game at blind - man 's buff — she should try to catch us — you used to , you know , Ellen . He would n't ; there was no pleasure in it , he said ; but he consented to play at ball with me . We found two , in a cupboard , among a heap of old toys ; tops , and hoops , and battledoors , and shuttlecocks . One was marked C. , and the other H ; I wished to have the C. , because that stood for Catherine , and the H. might be for Heathcliff , his name ; but the bran came out of H. , and Linton did n't like it . "
107304	107333	107289	107289	he	2023	" Minny and I went flying home as light as air : and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights , and my sweet , darling cousin , till morning . "
107382	107406	107407	107407	I	0	" I shall have another happy evening , I thought to myself , and what delights me more , my pretty Linton will . "
107485	107493	107468	107468	I	0	" He answered in his vulgar accent . "
107514	107563	107565	107566	Miss Catherine	56	" I was half inclined to make it try ; however , he moved off to open the door , and , as he raised the latch , he looked up to the inscription above , and said , with a stupid mixture of awkwardness , and elation : "
107575	107576	107568	107568	I	0	" "
107597	107610	107612	107613	Hareton Earnshaw	47	" He spelt , and drawled over by syllables , the name — "
107615	107616	107612	107613	Hareton Earnshaw	47	" "
107637	107650	107623	107623	I	0	" ' I can not tell them yet , ' he answered . "
107800	107807	107808	107808	I	0	" Stop Miss Catherine , dear ! "
107811	107973	107808	107808	I	0	" I shall not scold , but I do n't like your conduct there . If you had remembered that Hareton was your cousin , as much as Master Heathcliff , you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way . At least , it was praiseworthy ambition , for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton : and probably he did not learn merely to show off ; you had made him ashamed of his ignorance , before : I have no doubt ; and he wished to remedy it and please you . To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding — had you been brought up in his circumstances , would you be less rude ? he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were , and I 'm hurt that he should be despised now , because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly . "
107974	107989	107990	107990	she	2033	" Well , Ellen , you wo n't cry about it , will you ? "
107998	108030	108031	108031	I	0	" But wait , and you shall hear if he conned his a b c , to please me ; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute . "
108048	108059	108060	108060	he	2034	" I 'm ill to - night Catherine , love ; "
108063	108106	108060	108060	he	2034	" and you must have all the talk , and let me listen . Come , and sit by me — I was sure you would n't break your word , and I 'll make you promise again , before you go . "
108107	108200	108237	108237	thou	2038	" I knew now that I must n't tease him , as he was ill ; and I spoke softly and put no questions , and avoided irritating him in any way . I had brought some of my nicest books for him ; he asked me to read a little of one , and I was about to comply , when Earnshaw burst the door open , having gathered venom with reflection . He advanced direct to us ; seized Linton by the arm , and swung him off the seat . "
108207	108226	108060	108060	he	2034	" he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion , and his face looked swelled and furious . "
108252	108343	108347	108347	he	2039	" He swore at us , and left Linton no time to answer , nearly throwing him into the kitchen ; and he clenched his fist , as I followed , seemingly longing to knock me down . I was afraid , for a moment , and I let one volume fall ; he kicked it after me , and shut us out . I heard a malignant , crackly laugh by the fire , and turning beheld that odious Joseph , standing rubbing his bony hands , and quivering . "
108405	108406	108372	108372	he	2039	" "
108412	108426	108427	108427	Linton	56	" I said to my cousin , disregarding the old wretch 's mockery . "
108485	108510	108511	108511	he	2039	" If you do n't let me in I 'll kill you ; If you do n't let me in I 'll kill you ! "
108517	108532	108511	108511	he	2039	" Devil ! devil ! I 'll kill you , I 'll kill you ! "
108533	108541	108468	108468	He	2039	" Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again . "
108548	108586	108587	108587	I	0	" he cried . ' That 's father ! We 've allas summut uh orther side in us — Niver heed Hareton , lad — dunnut be ' feard — he can not get at thee ! ' "
108640	108693	108694	108694	I	0	" I ran into the yard , sick with terror ; and called for Zillah , aa loud as I could . She soon heard me ; she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn ; and hurrying from her work , she inquired what there was to do ? "
108769	108782	108744	108744	he	47	" I exclaimed that he had killed Linton and I would enter . "
108815	108862	108863	108863	Ellen	80	" I stood crying , till the housekeeper re - appeared ; she affirmed he would be better in a bit ; but he could n't do with that shrieking , and din , and she took me , and nearly carried me into the house . "
108909	108912	108918	108918	his	47	" wisht , "
108960	109011	109022	109022	he	0	" Still , I was not rid of him : when at length they compelled me to depart , and I had got some hundred yards off the premises , he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road - side , and checked Minny and took hold of me . "
109034	109075	109022	109022	he	0	" I gave him a cut with my whip , thinking , perhaps he would murder me — He let go , thundering one of his horrid curses , and I gallopped home more than half out of my senses . "
109133	109202	109203	109204	the lad	2768	" On the third day I took courage ; at least , I could n't bear longer suspense and stole off , once more . I went at five o'clock , and walked , fancying I might manage to creep into the house , and up to Linton 's room , unobserved . However , the dogs gave notice of my approach : Zillah received me , and saying "
109209	109303	109203	109204	the lad	2768	" showed me into a small , tidy , carpeted apartment , where , to my inexpressible joy , I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa , reading one of my books . But he would neither speak to me , nor look at me , through a whole hour , Ellen — He has such an unhappy temper — and what quite confounded me , when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood , that I had occasioned the uproar , and Hareton was not to blame ! "
109304	109328	109329	109329	Catherine	56	" Unable to reply , except passionately , I got up , and walked from the room . He sent after me a faint "
109331	109370	109329	109329	Catherine	56	" he did not reckon on being answered so — but I would n't turn back ; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home , nearly determined to visit him no more . "
109433	109436	109431	109431	I	0	" Yes , "
109451	109476	109489	109489	she	49	" I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court ; it was no use trying to conceal my presence . "
109497	109544	109489	109489	she	49	" I went in , Earnshaw was there also , but he quitted the room directly . Linton sat in the great arm chair half asleep ; walking up to the fire , I began in a serious tone , partly meaning it to be true . "
109612	109835	109836	109836	I	0	" ' Sit down and take your hat off , Catherine , ' he answered . ' You are so much happier than I am , you ought to be better . Papa talks enough of my defects , and shows enough scorn of me , to make it natural I should doubt myself — I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me , frequently ; and then I feel so cross and bitter , I hate everybody ! I am worthless , and bad in temper , and bad in spirit , almost always — and if you choose , you may say good - bye — you'll get rid of an annoyance — Only , Catherine , do me this justice ; believe that if I might be as sweet , and as kind , and as good as you are , I would be , as willingly , and more so , than as happy and as healthy . And , believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love , and though I could n't , and can not help showing my nature to you , I regret it , and repent it , and shall regret , and repent it , till I die ! ' "
109919	110004	110005	110006	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" I have always gone to his little parlour , since that night ; because his father returned the day after . About three times , I think , we have been merry , and hopeful , as we were the first evening ; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled — now , with his selfishness and spite ; and now with his sufferings : but I 've learnt to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter . "
110129	110195	110122	110122	he	43	" Now , Ellen , you have heard all ; and I ca n't be prevented from going to Wuthering Heights , except by inflicting misery on two people — whereas , if you 'll only not tell papa , my going need disturb the tranquillity of none . You 'll not tell , will you ? It will be very heartless if you do . "
110196	110214	110215	110215	I	0	" I 'll make up my mind on that point by to - morrow . Miss Catherine , "
110218	110240	110215	110215	I	0	" It requires some study : and so I 'll leave you to your rest , and go think it over . "
110412	110421	110423	110424	Mrs. Dean	71	" These things happened last winter , sir , "
110426	110541	110423	110424	Mrs. Dean	71	" hardly more than a year ago . Last winter , I did not think , at another twelve months ' end , I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them ! Yet , who knows how long you 'll be a stranger ? You 're too young to rest always contented , living by yourself ; and I some way fancy , no one could see Catherine Linton , and not love her . You smile ; but why do you look so lively and interested , when I talk about her — and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace ? and why — "
110542	110549	110550	110550	I	0	" Stop , my good friend ! "
110553	110621	110550	110550	I	0	" It may be very possible that I should love her ; but would she love me ? I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity , by running into temptation ; and then my home is not here . I 'm of the busy world , and to its arms I must return . Go on . Was Catherine obedient to her father 's commands ? "
110622	110626	110628	110629	the housekeeper	240	" She was , "
110631	110696	110628	110629	the housekeeper	240	" Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart ; and he spoke without anger ; he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes , where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her . He said to me , a few days afterwards , "
110741	110742	110715	110715	you	80	" "
110750	110754	110743	110743	He	2069	" I replied ; "
110838	110887	110888	110888	I	0	" Edgar sighed ; and , walking to the window , looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk . It was a misty afternoon , but the February sun shone dimly , and we could just distinguish the two fir trees in the yard , and the sparely scattered gravestones . "
110893	110898	110888	110888	I	0	" he half soliloquized , "
111180	111181	111163	111163	I	0	" "
111193	111197	111185	111185	God	66	" I answered , "
111254	111333	111334	111334	You	0	" Spring advanced ; yet my master gathered no real strength , though he resumed his walks in the grounds , with his daughter . To her inexperienced notions , this itself was a sign of convalescence ; and then his cheek was often flushed , and his eyes were bright , she felt sure of his recovering . On her seventeenth birthday , he did not visit the churchyard , it was raining , and I observed — "
111346	111350	111334	111334	You	0	" He answered — "
111365	111492	111353	111353	I	0	" He wrote again to Linton , expressing his great desire to see him ; and , had the invalid been presentable , I 've no doubt his father would have permitted him to come . As it was , being instructed , he returned an answer , intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange ; but his uncle 's kind remembrance delighted him , and he hoped to meet him , sometimes , in his rambles , and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided . That part of his letter was simple , and , probably his own . Heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently enough for Catherine 's company , then — "
111498	111502	111530	111530	you	2095	" he said , "
111720	112195	111672	111672	You	2098	" Edgar , though he felt for the boy , could not consent to grant his request ; because he could not accompany Catherine . He said , in summer , perhaps , they might meet : meantime , he wished him to continue writing at intervals , and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter ; being well aware of his hard position in his family . Linton complied ; and had he been unrestrained , would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations ; but his father kept a sharp watch over him ; and , of course , insisted on every line that my master sent being shown ; so , instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings , and distresses , the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts , he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love ; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview soon , or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises . Cathy was a powerful ally at home : and , between them , they , at length , persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together , about once a week , under my guardianship , and on the moors nearest the Grange ; for June found him still declining ; and , though he had set aside , yearly , a portion of his income for my young lady 's fortune , he had a natural desire that she might retain , or , at least , return , in a short time , to the house of her ancestors ; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir ; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself ; nor had any one , I believe ; no doctor visited the Heights , and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition , among us . I , for my part , began to fancy my forebodings were false , and that he must be actually rallying , when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors , and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object . I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learnt Heathcliff had treated him , to compel this apparent eagerness ; his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death . Summer was already past its prime , when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties , and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join her cousin . "
112261	112288	112246	112255	a little herd - boy , despatched as a messenger	2108	" Maister Linton wer just ut this side th ' Heights : and he 'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further . "
112289	112302	112303	112303	I	0	" Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle , "
112306	112325	112303	112303	I	0	" he bid us keep on the Grange land , and here we are , off at once . "
112326	112343	112345	112346	my companion	350	" Well , we 'll turn our horses ' heads round , when we reach him , "
112348	112356	112345	112346	my companion	350	" our excursion shall lie towards home . "
112436	112460	112432	112432	I	0	" Why , Master Heathcliff , you are not fit for enjoying a ramble , this morning . How ill you do look ! "
112505	112512	112513	112513	he	2111	" No — better — better ! "
112556	112563	112565	112566	his cousin	4033	" But you have been worse , "
112568	112583	112565	112566	his cousin	4033	" worse than when I saw you last — you are thinner , and — "
112584	112589	112590	112590	he	2111	" I 'm tired , "
112595	112626	112590	112590	he	2111	" It is too hot for walking , let us rest here . And , in the morning , I often feel sick — papa says I grow so fast . "
112640	112648	112650	112650	she	56	" This is something like your paradise , "
112658	112725	112650	112650	she	56	" You recollect the two days we agreed to spend , in the place and way , each thought pleasantest ? This is nearly yours , only there are clouds ; but then , they are so soft and mellow , it is nicer than sunshine . Next week , if you can , we 'll ride down to the Grange Park , and try mine . "
112940	112946	112948	112948	Cathy	56	" But , I think , "
112950	113020	112948	112948	Cathy	56	" you 'd be more comfortable at home than sitting here ; and I can not amuse you to - day , I see , by my tales , and songs , and chatter ; you have grown wiser than I , in these six months ; you have little taste for my diversions now ; or else , if I could amuse you , I 'd willingly stay . "
113021	113027	113028	113028	he	2111	" Stay to rest yourself , "
113031	113089	113028	113028	he	2111	" And , Catherine , do n't think , or say that I 'm very unwell — it is the heavy weather , and heat that make me dull ; and I walked about , before you came , a great deal , for me . Tell uncle , I 'm in tolerable health , will you ? "
113090	113110	113112	113114	my young lady	3319	" I 'll tell him that you say so , Linton . I could n't affirm that you are , "
113128	113136	113138	113138	he	2111	" And be here again next Thursday , "
113145	113211	113138	113138	he	2111	" And give him my thanks for permitting you to come — my best thanks , Catherine . And — and , if you did meet my father , and he asked you about me , do n't lead him to suppose that I 've been extremely silent and stupid — don't look sad and downcast , as you are doing — he'll be angry . "
113212	113220	113222	113222	Cathy	56	" I care nothing for his anger , "
113231	113236	113238	113239	her cousin	462	" But I do , "
113243	113259	113238	113239	her cousin	462	" Do n't provoke him against me , Catherine , for he is very hard . "
113260	113270	113271	113271	I	0	" Is he severe to you , Master Heathcliff ? "
113274	113291	113271	113271	I	0	" Has he grown weary of indulgence , and passed from passive , to active hatred ? "
113378	113388	113389	113389	she	56	" Is it half an hour now , Ellen ! "
113398	113420	113389	113389	she	56	" I ca n't tell why we should stay . He 's asleep , and papa will be wanting us back . "
113421	113431	113432	113432	I	0	" Well , we must not leave him asleep , "
113435	113463	113432	113432	I	0	" wait till he wakes and be patient . You were mighty eager to set off , but your longing to see poor Linton has soon evaporated ! "
113464	113473	113389	113389	she	56	" Why did he wish to see me ? "
113477	113581	113389	113389	she	56	" In his crossest humours , formerly , I liked him better than I do in his present curious mood . It 's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform — this interview — for fear his father should scold him . But , I 'm hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure ; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance . And , though I 'm glad he 's better in health , I 'm sorry he 's so much less pleasant , and so much less affectionate to me . "
113582	113593	113594	113594	I	0	" You think he is better in health , then ? "
113597	113600	113601	113601	she	2121	" Yes , "
113604	113642	113601	113601	she	2121	" because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings , you know . He is not tolerably well , as he told me to tell papa , but he 's better , very likely . "
113643	113653	113654	113654	I	0	" There you differ with me , Miss Cathy , "
113657	113667	113654	113654	I	0	" I should conjecture him to be far worse . "
113688	113691	113693	113693	Catherine	56	" No , "
113695	113718	113693	113693	Catherine	56	" unless in dreams . I can not conceive how you manage to dose , out of doors , in the morning . "
113719	113727	113728	113728	he	2122	" I thought I heard my father , "
113740	113747	113728	113728	he	2122	" You are sure nobody spoke ? "
113748	113752	113754	113755	his cousin	4033	" Quite sure , "
113757	113805	113754	113755	his cousin	4033	" Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your health . Are you truly stronger , Linton , than when we separated in winter ? If you be , I 'm certain one thing is not stronger — your regard for me — speak , are you ? "
113817	113825	113814	113814	he	2122	" Yes , yes , I am ! "
113851	113860	113861	113861	she	56	" For to - day we must part , "
113864	113900	113861	113861	she	56	" And I wo n't conceal that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting , though I 'll mention it to nobody but you — not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff ! "
113901	113904	113906	113906	Linton	56	" Hush , "
113908	113920	113906	113906	Linton	56	" for God 's sake , hush ! He 's coming . "
113957	113965	113966	113966	she	56	" I 'll be here next Thursday , "
113974	113982	113966	113966	she	56	" Good bye . Quick , Ellen ! "
114006	114595	113998	113998	he	2122	" Before we reached home , Catherine 's displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague , uneasy doubts about Linton 's actual circumstances , physical and social ; in which I partook , though I counselled her not to say much , for a second journey would make us better judges . My master requested an account of our on - goings : his nephew 's offering of thanks was duly delivered , Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest : I also , threw little light on his inquiries , for I hardly knew what to hide , and what to reveal . Seven days glided away , every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton 's state . The havoc that months had previously wrought , was now emulated by the inroads of hours . Catherine , we would fain have deluded , yet , but her own quick spirit refused to delude her . It divined , in secret , and brooded on the dreadful probability , gradually ripening into certainty . She had not the heart to mention her ride , when Thursday came round ; I mentioned it for her ; and obtained permission to order her out of doors ; for the library , where her father stopped a short time daily — the brief period he could bear to sit up , and his chamber had become her whole world . She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow , or seated by his side . Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow , and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society , drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death . He had a fixed idea , I guessed by several observations he let fall , that as his nephew resembled him in person , he would resemble him in mind ; for Linton 's letters bore few , or no indications of his defective character . And I through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error ; asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account . We deferred our excursion till the afternoon ; a golden afternoon of August — every breath from the hills so full of life , that it seemed whoever respired it , though dying , might revive . Catherine 's face was just like the landscape — shadows and sunshine flitting over it , in rapid succession ; but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient , and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares . We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before . My young mistress alighted , and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while , I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback ; but I dissented , I would n't risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute ; so we climbed the slope of heath , together . Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion ; not the animation of high spirits though , nor yet of joy ; it looked more like fear . "
114600	114611	113998	113998	he	2122	" he said , speaking short , and with difficulty . "
114626	114627	114621	114621	you	2129	" "
114635	114643	114631	114631	you	0	" cried Catherine , swallowing her greeting . "
114690	114719	114669	114669	you	0	" Linton shivered , and glanced at her , half supplicating , half ashamed , but his cousin 's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour . "
114726	114730	114669	114669	you	0	" she said , "
114791	114795	114796	114796	he	0	" My affectations ! "
114799	114859	114796	114796	he	0	" what are they ? For Heaven 's sake Catherine , do n't look so angry ! Despise me as much as you please ; I am a worthless , cowardly wretch — I ca n't be scorned enough ! but I 'm too mean for your anger — hate my father , and spare me , for contempt ! "
114860	114863	114865	114865	Catherine	56	" Nonsense ! "
114870	114985	114865	114865	Catherine	56	" Foolish , silly boy ! And there ! he trembles , as if I were really going to touch him ! You need n't bespeak contempt , Linton ; anybody will have it spontaneously , at your service . Get off ! I shall return home — it is folly dragging you from the hearth - stone , and pretending — what do we pretend ? Let go my frock — if I pitied you for crying , and looking so very frightened , you should spurn such pity . Ellen , tell him how disgraceful this conduct is . Rise , and do n't degrade yourself into an abject reptile — don't . "
115012	115015	115016	115016	he	2134	" Oh ! "
115019	115110	115016	115016	he	2134	" I can not bear it ! Catherine , Catherine , I 'm a traitor too , and I dare not tell you ! But leave me and I shall be killed ! Dear Catherine , my life is in your hands ; and you have said you loved me — and if you did , it would n't harm you . You 'll not go , then ? kind , sweet , good Catherine ! And perhaps you will consent — and he 'll let me die with you ! "
115144	115149	115150	115150	she	3319	" Consent to what ? "
115153	115244	115150	115150	she	3319	" To stay ? Tell me the meaning of this strange talk , and I will . You contradict your own words , and distract me ! Be calm and frank , and confess at once , all that weighs on your heart . You would n't injure me , Linton , would you ? You would n't let any enemy hurt me , if you could prevent it ? I 'll believe you are a coward , for yourself , but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend . "
115245	115252	115254	115255	the boy	2803	" But my father threatened me , "
115262	115277	115254	115255	the boy	2803	" and I dread him — I dread him ! I dare not tell ! "
115278	115282	115284	115284	Catherine	56	" Oh well ! "
115290	115308	115284	115284	Catherine	56	" keep your secret , I 'm no coward — save yourself , I 'm not afraid ! "
115439	115469	115470	115470	he	43	" It is something to see you so near to my house , Nelly ! How are you at the Grange ? Let us hear ! The rumour goes , "
115477	115494	115470	115470	he	43	" that Edgar Linton is on his death - bed — perhaps they exaggerate his illness ? "
115495	115503	115504	115504	I	0	" No ; my master is dying , "
115507	115529	115470	115470	he	43	" it is true enough . A sad thing it will be for us all , but a blessing for him ! "
115530	115541	115542	115542	he	43	" How long will he last , do you think ? "
115545	115551	115552	115552	I	0	" I do n't know , "
115555	115558	115559	115559	he	43	" Because , "
115600	115655	115599	115599	his	43	account—"Because that lad yonder , seems determined to beat me — and I 'd thank his uncle to be quick , and go before him — Hallo ! Has the whelp been playing that game long ? I did give him some lessons about snivelling . Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally ? "
115656	115668	115669	115669	I	0	" Lively ? no — he has shown the greatest distress ; "
115672	115706	115669	115669	I	0	" To see him , I should say , that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills , he ought to be in bed , under the hands of a doctor . "
115707	115718	115720	115720	Heathcliff	43	" He shall be , in a day or two , "
115721	115733	115734	115734	he	43	" But first — get up , Linton ! Get up ! "
115737	115751	115734	115734	he	43	" Do n't grovel on the ground , there — up this moment ! "
115827	115830	115832	115832	he	43	" Now , "
115837	115863	115832	115832	he	43	" I 'm getting angry — and if you do n't command that paltry spirit of yours — Damn you ! Get up , directly ! "
115864	115870	115871	115871	he	81	" I will , father ! "
115874	115922	115871	115871	he	81	" Only , let me alone , or I shall faint ! I 've done as you wished — I'm sure . Catherine will tell you that I — that I — have been cheerful . Ah ! keep by me Catherine ; give me your hand . "
115923	115927	115929	115930	his father	518	" Take mine , "
115932	115994	115929	115930	his father	518	" stand on your feet ! There now — she'll lend you her arm . . .that 's right , look at her . You would imagine I was the devil himself , Miss Linton , to excite such horror . Be so kind as to walk home with him , will you ? He shudders , if I touch him . "
115995	116000	116002	116002	Catherine	56	" Linton , dear ! "
116004	116031	116002	116002	Catherine	56	" I ca n't go to Wuthering Heights . . .papa has forbidden me . . .He'll not harm you , why are you so afraid ? "
116032	116042	116043	116043	he	2145	" I can never re - enter that house , "
116046	116058	116043	116043	he	2145	" I am not to re - enter it without you ! "
116059	116064	116066	116067	his father	518	" Stop . . . "
116069	116097	116066	116067	his father	518	" We 'll respect Catherine 's filial scruples . Nelly , take him in , and I 'll follow your advice concerning the doctor , without delay . "
116098	116104	116106	116106	I	0	" You 'll do well , "
116108	116126	116106	116106	I	0	" but I must remain with my mistress . To mind your son is not my business . "
116127	116133	116135	116135	Heathcliff	43	" You are very stiff ! "
116137	116179	116180	116180	He	43	" I know that — but you 'll force me to pinch the baby , and make it scream , before it moves your charity . Come then , my hero . Are you willing to return , escorted by me ? "
116313	116346	116305	116306	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" My house is not stricken with the plague , Nelly ; and I have a mind to be hospitable today ; sit down , and allow me to shut the door . "
116357	116368	116369	116369	he	43	" You shall have tea , before you go home , "
116372	116518	116369	116369	he	43	" I am by myself . Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees — and Zillah and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure . And , though I 'm used to being alone , I 'd rather have some interesting company , if I can get it . Miss Linton , take your seat by him . I give you what I have ; the present is hardly worth accepting ; but , I have nothing else to offer . It is Linton , I mean . How she does stare ! It 's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me ! Had I been born where laws are less strict , and tastes less dainty , I should treat myself to a slow vivifisection of those two , as an evening 's amusement . "
116534	116542	116522	116522	his	2152	" By hell ! I hate them . "
116543	116551	116553	116553	Catherine	56	" I 'm not afraid of you ! "
116580	116591	116592	116592	she	56	" Give me that key — I will have it ! "
116594	116607	116592	116592	she	56	" I would'nt eat or drink here , if I were starving . "
116687	116693	116694	116694	he	43	" Now , Catherine Linton , "
116697	116716	116694	116694	he	43	" stand off , or I shall knock you down ; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad . "
116733	116738	116739	116739	she	56	" We will go ! "
116878	116882	116872	116872	I	0	" You villain ! "
116888	116892	116883	116883	I	0	" you villain ! "
116994	117005	117013	117013	he	3327	" I know how to chastise children , you see , "
117029	117104	117013	117013	he	3327	" Go to Linton now , as I told you ; and cry at your ease ! I shall be your father to - morrow — all the father you 'll have in a few days — and you shall have plenty of that — you can bear plenty — you're no weakling — you shall have a daily taste , if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again ! "
117199	117205	117206	117206	he	43	" Wash away your spleen , "
117209	117238	117206	117206	he	43	" And help your own naughty pet and mine . It is not poisoned , though I prepared it . I 'm going out to seek your horses . "
117283	117287	117288	117288	I	0	" Master Linton , "
117297	117328	117288	117288	I	0	" You know what your diabolical father is after , and you shall tell us , or I 'll box your ears , as he has done your cousin 's . "
117329	117338	117340	117340	Catherine	56	" Yes , Linton ; you must tell , "
117342	117361	117340	117340	Catherine	56	" It was for your sake I came ; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse . "
117362	117379	117380	117380	he	2158	" Give me some tea , I 'm thirsty , and then I 'll tell you , "
117383	117423	117424	117424	Catherine	56	" Mrs. Dean , go away . I do n't like you standing over me . Now , Catherine , you are letting your tears fall into my cup ! I wo nt drink that . Give me another . "
117508	117516	117517	117517	he	2158	" Papa wants us to be married , "
117527	117593	117517	117517	he	2158	" And he knows your papa would n't let us marry now ; and he 's afraid of my dying , if we wait ; so we are to be married in the morning , and you are to stay here all night ; and , if you do as he wishes , you shall return home next day , and take me with you . "
117594	117603	117604	117604	I	0	" Take you with her , pitiful changeling ? "
117607	117722	117604	117604	I	0	" You marry ? Why , the man is mad , or he thinks us fools , every one . And , do you imagine that beautiful young lady , that healthy , hearty girl , will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you ? Are you cherishing the notion that anybody , let alone Miss Catherine Linton , would have you for a husband ? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all , with your dastardly , puling tricks ; and — don't look so silly now ! I 've a very good mind to shake you severely , for your contemptible treachery , and your imbecile conceit . "
117755	117762	117763	117763	she	56	" Stay all night ? No ! "
117770	117786	117763	117763	she	56	" Ellen , I 'll burn that door down , but I 'll get out . "
117824	117869	117813	117813	He	2163	" Wo n't you have me , and save me — not let me come to the Grange ? Oh ! darling Catherine ! you must n't go , and leave me , after all . You must obey my father , you must ! "
117870	117877	117878	117878	she	56	" I must obey my own , "
117881	117943	117878	117878	she	56	" and relieve him from this cruel suspense . The whole night ! What would he think ? he 'll be distressed already . I 'll either break or burn a way out of the house . Be quiet ! You 're in no danger — but , if you hinder me — Linton , I love papa better than you ! "
118007	118014	118015	118015	he	2169	" Your beasts have trotted off ; "
118018	118154	118155	118155	He	2170	" and — Now , Linton ! snivelling again ? What has she been doing to you ? Come , come — have done , and get to bed . In a month or two , my lad , you 'll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies , with a vigorous hand — you're pining for pure love , are you not ? nothing else in the world — and she shall have you ! There , to bed ! Zillah wo nt be here to - night ; you must undress yourself . Hush ! hold your noise ! Once in your own room , I 'll not come near you , you need n't fear . By chance , you 've managed tolerably . I 'll look to the rest , "
118258	118279	118250	118250	he	43	" Oh , you are not afraid of me ? Your courage is well disguised — you seem damnably afraid ! "
118280	118286	118287	118287	she	56	" I am afraid now , "
118290	118359	118287	118287	she	56	" because if I stay , papa will be miserable ; and how can I endure making him miserable — when he — when he — Mr. Heathcliff , let me go home ! I promise to marry Linton — papa would like me to , and I love him — and why should you wish to force me to do what I 'll willingly do of myself ? "
118360	118368	118369	118369	I	0	" Let him dare to force you ! "
118372	118420	118369	118369	I	0	" There 's law in the land , thank God , there is ! though we be in an out - of - the - way place . I 'd inform , if he were my own son , and it 's felony without benefit of clergy ! "
118421	118424	118426	118427	the ruffian	3793	" Silence ! "
118429	118531	118426	118427	the ruffian	3793	" To the devil with your clamour ! I do n't want you to speak . Miss Linton , I shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable ; I shall not sleep for satisfaction . You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof , for the next twenty - four hours , than informing me that such an event would follow . As to your promise to marry Linton ; I 'll take care you shall keep it , for you shall not quit the place till it is fulfilled . "
118532	118545	118547	118547	Catherine	56	" Send Ellen then , to let papa know I 'm safe ! "
118552	118575	118547	118547	Catherine	56	" Or marry me now . Poor papa ! Ellen , he 'll think we 're lost . What shall we do ? "
118576	118600	118602	118602	Heathcliff	43	" Not he ! He 'll think you are tired of waiting on him , and run off , for a little amusement , "
118604	118867	118602	118602	Heathcliff	43	" You can not deny that you entered my house of your own accord , in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary . And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age ; and that you should weary of nursing a sick man , and that man , only your father . Catherine , his happiest days were over when your days began . He cursed you , I dare say , for coming into the world , ( I did , at least ) . And it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it . I 'd join him . I do n't love you ! How should I ? Weep away . As far as I can see , it will be your chief diversion hereafter : unless Linton make amends for other losses ; and your provident parent appears to fancy he may . His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly . In his last , he recommended my jewel to be careful of his ; and kind to her when he got her . Careful and kind — that 's paternal ! But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself Linton can play the little tyrant well . He 'll undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn , and their claws pared . You 'll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness , when you get home again , I assure you . "
118868	118874	118875	118875	I	0	" You 're right there ! "
118878	118909	118875	118875	I	0	" explain your son 's character . Show his resemblance to yourself ; and then , I hope , Miss Cathy will think twice , before she takes the cockatrice ! "
118910	118923	118924	118924	he	0	" I do n't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now , "
118927	118982	118924	118924	he	0	" because she must either accept him , or remain a prisoner , and you along with her , till your master dies . I can detain you both , quite concealed , here , If you doubt , encourage her to retract her word , and you 'll have an opportunity of judging ! "
118983	118991	118993	118993	Catherine	56	" I 'll not retract my word , "
118995	119184	118993	118993	Catherine	56	" I 'll marry him , within this hour , if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards . Mr. Heathcliff , you 're a cruel man , but you 're not a fiend ; and you wo nt , from mere malice , destroy , irrevocably , all my happiness . If papa thought I had left him , on purpose ; and if he died before I returned , could I bear to live ? I 've given over crying ; but I 'm going to kneel here , at your knee ; and I 'll not get up , and I 'll not take my eyes from your face , till you look back at me ! No , do n't turn away ! do look ! You 'll see nothing to provoke you . I do n't hate you . I 'm not angry that you struck me . Have you never loved anybody , in all your life , uncle ? never ? Ah ! you must look once — I'm so wretched — you ca n't help being sorry and pitying me . "
119185	119202	119204	119204	Heathcliff	43	" Keep your eft 's fingers off ; and move , or I 'll kick you ! "
119210	119235	119236	119236	He	43	" I 'd rather be hugged by a snake . How the devil can you dream of fawning on me ? I detest you ! "
119361	119371	119372	119372	I	0	" I thought it had been your cousin Hareton , "
119377	119393	119372	119372	I	0	" I wish he would arrive ! Who knows but he might take our part ? "
119394	119407	119409	119409	Heathcliff	43	" It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange , "
119414	119451	119409	119409	Heathcliff	43	" You should have opened a lattice , and called out ; but I could swear that chit is glad you did n't . She 's glad to be obliged to stay , I 'm certain . "
119699	119702	119689	119689	She	56	" Yes . "
119703	119707	119708	119708	he	43	" Here then , "
119736	119740	119741	119741	he	43	" Be patient , "
119744	119755	119741	119741	he	43	" I 'll send up your breakfast in a while . "
119815	119824	119778	119778	He	43	" I 've brought you something to eat , "
119829	119835	119778	119778	He	43	" oppen t ' door ! "
119853	119857	119858	119858	he	43	" Tak it ! "
119868	119873	119874	119874	I	0	" Stay one minute , "
119877	119880	119882	119882	he	43	" Nay ! "
119899	120028	119891	119891	I	0	" And there I remained enclosed , the whole day , and the whole of the next night ; and another , and another . Five nights and four days I remained , altogether , seeing nobody but Hareton , once every morning , and he was a model of a jailer — surly , and dumb , and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion . On the fifth morning , or rather afternoon , a different step approached — lighter and shorter — and , this time , the person entered the room . It was Zillah ; donned in her scarlet shawl , with a black silk bonnet on her head , and a willow basket swung to her arm . "
120036	120040	120033	120034	Mrs. Dean	71	" she exclaimed . "
120132	120133	120134	120134	Your	634	" "
120141	120145	120137	120139	a true scoundrel	2195	" I replied . "
120168	120169	120172	120172	you	3179	" "
120175	120179	120172	120172	you	3179	" asked Zillah . "
120212	120213	120202	120202	I	0	" "
120247	120248	120249	120249	He	3179	" "
120267	120282	120261	120261	I	0	" The master listened , and he just smiled to himself , and said — "
120401	120402	120403	120404	Mr. Edgar	91	" "
120409	120413	120403	120404	Mr. Edgar	91	" I gasped . "
120420	120421	120418	120418	Zillah	49	" "
120434	120438	120439	120439	you	49	" she replied , "
120468	120579	120459	120459	I	0	" Instead of sitting down , I snatched my outdoor things , and hastened below , for the way was free . On entering the house , I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine . The place was filled with sunshine , and the door stood wide open , but nobody seemed at hand . As I hesitated whether to go off at once , or return and seek my mistress , a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth . Linton lay on the settle , sole tenant , sucking a stick of sugar - candy , and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes . "
120585	120614	120582	120583	Miss Catherine	56	" I demanded , sternly , supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence , by catching him thus , alone . He sucked on like an innocent . "
120619	120623	120616	120616	she	56	" I said . "
120626	120630	120616	120616	she	56	" he replied ; "
120648	120649	120650	120650	You	2211	" "
120659	120663	120667	120667	her	56	" I exclaimed . "
120680	120681	120672	120672	I	0	" "
120696	120700	120701	120701	He	133	" he answered . "
120780	120799	120800	120801	Master Heathcliff	43	" He resumed his former occupation , closing his lids , as if he meant to drop asleep . "
120803	120807	120800	120801	Master Heathcliff	43	" I resumed , "
120916	120938	120947	120947	she	56	" The corner , of Linton 's mouth fell , and he took the sugar - candy from his his lips . "
120951	120955	120947	120947	she	56	" I continued . "
121092	121093	121094	121094	I	0	" "
121101	121106	121094	121094	I	0	" he answered crossly . "
121190	121191	121160	121160	she	56	" "
121197	121218	121219	121219	He	43	" I inquired , perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin 's mental tortures . "
121225	121229	121219	121219	He	43	" he replied , "
121517	121518	121498	121498	he	2871	" "
121528	121540	121541	121541	I	0	" I asked : having my designs in encouraging his talk . "
121544	121548	121541	121541	I	0	" he answered . "
121692	121693	121679	121679	she	56	" "
121704	121708	121679	121679	she	56	" I said . "
121718	121721	121679	121679	she	56	" he answered "
121732	121733	121723	121723	I	0	" "
121740	121744	121747	121747	he	0	" I asked . "
121788	121960	121961	121961	Catherine	56	" And he turned his face onto his arm , and shut his eyes , again . I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff ; and bring a rescue for my young lady , from the Grange . On reaching it the astonishment of my fellow servants to see me , and their joy also , was intense ; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe , two or three were about to hurry up , and shout the news at Mr. Edgar 's door : but I bespoke the announcement of it , myself . How changed I found him , even in those few days ! He lay an image of sadness , and resignation , waiting his death . Very young he looked : though his actual age was thirty - nine ; one would have called him ten years younger , at least . He thought of Catherine for he murmured her name . I touched his hand , and spoke . "
121968	121972	121961	121961	Catherine	56	" I whispered , "
121990	122493	121973	121973	she	56	" I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence : he half rose up , looked eagerly round the apartment , and then sunk back in a swoon . As soon as he recovered , I related our compulsory visit , and detention at the Heights : I said Heathcliff forced me to go in , which was not quite true ; I uttered as little as possible against Linton ; nor did I describe all his father 's brutal conduct — my intentions being to add no bitterness , if I could help it , to his already overflowing cup . He divined that one of his enemy 's purposes was to secure the personal property , as well as the estate to his son , or rather himself ; yet why he did not wait till his decease , was a puzzle to my master ; because ignorant how nearly he , and his nephew would quit the world together . However he felt his will had better be altered — instead of leaving Catherine 's fortune at her own disposal , he determined to put it in the hands of trustees , for her use during life ; and for her children , if she had any , after her . By that means , it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die . Having received his orders , I despatched a man to fetch the attorney , and four more , provided with serviceable weapons , to demand my young lady of her jailer . Both parties were delayed very late . The single servant returned first . He said Mr. Green , the lawyer , was out when he arrived at his house , and he had to wait two hours for his re - entrance : and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village , that must be done , but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning . The four men came back unaccompanied , also . They brought word that Catherine was ill , too ill to quit her room , and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her . I scolded the stupid fellows well , for listening to that tale , which I would not carry to my master ; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights , at daylight , and storm it , literally , unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us . Her father shall see her , I vowed , and vowed again , if that devil be killed on his own doorstones , in trying to prevent it ! Happily , I was spared the journey , and the trouble . I had gone down stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water ; and was passing through the hall , with it in my hand , when a sharp knock , at the front door , made me jump . "
122508	122576	122506	122506	Green	159	" and I went on , intending to send somebody else to open it ; but the knock was repeated , not loud , and still importunately . I put the jug on the bannister , and hastened to admit him , myself . The harvest moon shone clear outside . It was not the attorney . My own sweet little mistress sprung on my neck sobbing , "
122585	122586	122582	122582	papa	133	" "
122589	122593	122597	122597	he	133	" I cried , "
122611	122808	122809	122809	I	0	" She wanted to run , breathless as she was , up - stairs to Mr , Linton 's room ; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair , and made her drink , and washed her pale face , chafing it into a faint colour with my apron . Then I said I must go first , and tell of her arrival ; imploring her to say , she should be happy , with young Heathcliff . She stared , but soon comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood , she assured me she would not complain . I could n't abide to be present at their meeting . I stood outside the chamber - door , a quarter of an hour , and hardly ventured near the bed , then . All was composed , however ; Catherine 's despair was as silent as her father 's joy . She supported him calmly , in appearance ; and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy . He died blissfully , Mr. Lockwood ; he died so , kissing her cheek , he murmured , "
122824	123468	122816	122816	you	2253	" and never stirred or spoke again , but continued that rapt , radiant gaze , till his pulse imperceptibly stopped , and his soul departed . None could have noticed the exact minute of his death , it was so entirely without a struggle . Whether Catherine had spent her tears , or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow , she sat there dry - eyed till the sun rose — she sat till noon , and would still have remained , brooding over that death - bed , but I insisted on her coming away , and taking some repose . It was well I succeeded in removing her , for at dinner - time appeared the lawyer , having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave . He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff , and that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master 's summons . Fortunately , no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter 's mind , to disturb him , after his daughter 's arrival . Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place . He gave all the servants but me , notice to quit . He would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside his wife , but in the chapel , with his family . There was the will however , to hinder that , and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions . The funeral was hurried over ; Catherine , Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now , was suffered to stay at the Grange , till her father 's corpse had quitted it . She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of liberating her . She heard the men I sent , disputing at the door , and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff 's answer . It drove her desperate — Linton , who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left , was terrified into fetching the key before his father re - ascended . He had the cunning to unlock , and re - lock the door , without shutting it ; and when he should have gone to bed , he begged to sleep with Hareton , and his petition was granted , for once . Catherine stole out before break of day . She dare not try the doors , lest the dogs should raise an alarm ; she visited the empty chambers , and examined their windows ; and , luckily , lighting on her mother 's , she got easily out of its lattice , and onto the ground , by means of the fir tree , close by . Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape , notwithstanding his timid contrivances . The evening after the funeral , my young lady and I were seated in the library ; now musing mournfully , one of us despairingly , on our loss ; now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future . We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine , would be a permission to continue resident at the Grange , at least , during Linton 's life : he being allowed to join her there , and I to remain as housekeeper . That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for , and yet I did hope , and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home , and my employment , and , above all , my beloved young mistress , when a servant — one of the discarded ones , not yet departed — rushed hastily in , and said , "
123472	123697	123471	123471	Heathcliff	43	" was coming through the court , should he fasten the door in his face ? If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding , we had not time . He made no ceremony of knocking , or announcing his name ; he was master , and availed himself of the master 's privilege to walk straight in , without saying a word . The sound of our informant 's voice directed him to the library : he entered ; and motioning him out , shut the door . It was the same room into which he had been ushered , as a guest , eighteen years before : the same moon shone through the window ; and the same autumn landscape lay outside . We had not yet lighted a candle , but all the apartment was visible , even to the portraits on the wall — the splendid head of Mrs. Linton , and the graceful one of her husband . Heathcliff advanced to the hearth . Time had little altered his person either . There was the same man ; his dark face rather sallower , and more composed , his frame a stone or two heavier , perhaps , and no other difference . Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out , when she saw him . "
123700	123710	123471	123471	Heathcliff	43	" he said , arresting her by the arm . "
123930	123931	123920	123920	I	0	" "
123939	123943	123935	123935	Catherine	56	" I pleaded , "
123977	123978	123979	123979	I	0	" "
123988	123992	123979	123979	I	0	" he answered ; "
124048	124049	124050	124050	I	0	" "
124053	124057	124050	124050	I	0	" said Catherine . "
124119	124120	124112	124112	I	0	" "
124127	124131	124121	124121	You	2263	" replied Heathcliff ; "
124244	124245	124246	124246	I	0	" "
124254	124257	124248	124248	he	73	" Catherine ; "
124364	124402	124358	124358	I	0	" Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph : she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family , and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies . "
124412	124421	124403	124403	You	43	" said her father - in - law . "
124438	124511	124512	124512	I	0	" She scornfully withdrew . In her absence , I began to beg for Zillah 's place at the Heights , offering to resign her mine ; but he would suffer it on no account . He bid me be silent , and then , for the first time , allowed himself a glance round the room , and a look at the pictures . Having studied Mrs. Linton , he said — "
124527	124554	124555	124555	I	0	" He turned abruptly to the fire , and continued , with what , for lack of a better word , I must call a smile — "
124716	124717	124718	124718	You	2281	" "
124726	124730	124732	124732	you	2281	" I exclaimed ; "
124740	124741	124732	124732	you	2281	" "
124748	124752	124754	124754	I	0	" he replied ; "
124845	124846	124820	124820	I	0	" "
124867	124871	124861	124861	you	0	" I said . "
124883	124887	124861	124861	you	0	" he answered . "
125002	125064	125082	125082	I	0	" The day she was buried there came a fall of snow . In the evening I went to the churchyard . It blew bleak as winter — all round was solitary : I did n't fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the den so late — and no one else had business to bring them there . "
125087	125126	125082	125082	I	0	" ' I 'll have her in my arms again ! If she be cold , I 'll think it is this north wind that chills me , and if she be motionless , it is sleep . ' "
125311	125399	125298	125298	Cathy	56	" A sudden sense of relief flowed , from my heart , through every limb . I relinquished my labour of agony , and turned consoled at once , unspeakably consoled . Her presence was with me ; it remained while I re - filled the grave , and led me home . You may laugh , if you will , but I was sure I should see her there . I was sure she was with me , and I could not help talking to her . "
125582	125762	125579	125579	Linton	56	" When I sat in the house with Hareton , it seemed that on going out , I should meet her ; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in . When I went from home , I hastened to return , she must be somewhere at the Heights , I was certain ! And when I slept in her chamber — I was beaten out of that — I could n't lie there ; for the moment I closed my eyes , she was either outside the window , or sliding back the panels , or entering the room , or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child . And I must open my lids to see . And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a - night — to be always disappointed ! It racked me ! I 've often groaned aloud , till that old rascal Joseph , no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me . "
125811	125951	125579	125579	Linton	56	" Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead — his hair clung to it , wet with perspiration ; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire ; the brows not contracted , but raised next the temples , diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance , but imparting a peculiar look of trouble , and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject . He only half addressed me , and I maintained silence — I did n't like to hear him talk ! After a short period , he resumed his meditation on the picture , took it down , and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage ; and while so occupied Catherine entered , announcing that she was ready , when her pony should be saddled . "
125959	125972	125579	125579	Linton	56	" said Heathcliff to me , then turning to her he added , "
126012	126013	125579	125579	Linton	56	" "
126020	126038	126018	126018	Ellen	80	" whispered my dear little mistress . As she kissed me , her lips felt like ice . "
126049	126050	126043	126043	Ellen	80	" "
126062	126068	126059	126060	Mrs. Dean	71	" said her new father . "
126091	126207	126085	126085	your	80	" He signed her to precede him ; and casting back a look that cut my heart , she obeyed . I watched them from the window , walk down the garden . Heathcliff fixed Catherine 's arm under his , though she disputed the act , at first , evidently , and with rapid strides , he hurried her into the alley , whose trees concealed them . I have paid a visit to the Heights , but I have not seen her since she left ; Joseph held the door in his hand , when I called to ask after her , and would n't let me pass . He said Mrs. Linton was "
126210	126385	126085	126085	your	80	" and the master was not in . Zillah has told me something of the way they go on , otherwise I should hardly know who was dead , and who living . She thinks Catherine , haughty , and does not like her , I can guess by her talk . My young lady asked some aid of her , when she first came , but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business , and let his daughter - in - law look after herself , and Zillah willingly acquiesced , being a narrow - minded selfish woman . Catherine evinced a child 's annoyance at this neglect ; repaid it with contempt , and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies , as securely as if she had done her some great wrong . I had a long talk with Zillah , about six weeks ago , a little before you came , one day , when we foregathered on the moor ; and this is what she told me . "
126393	126397	126389	126390	Mrs. Linton	48	" she said , "
126470	126471	126446	126446	she	48	" "
126476	126480	126446	126446	she	48	" answered Heathcliff , "
126500	126501	126491	126491	I	0	" "
126511	126515	126503	126503	I	0	" she said , "
126527	126528	126523	126523	he	462	" "
126535	126540	126523	126523	he	462	" cried the master , "
126580	126838	126565	126566	the nurse	2319	" Then she began to bother me , and I said I 'd had enough plague with the tiresome thing ; we each had our tasks , and hers was to wait on Linton , Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her . How they managed together , I ca n't tell . I fancy he fretted a great deal , and moaned hisseln , night and day ; and she had precious little rest , one could guess by her white face , and heavy eyes — she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like , and looked as if she would fain beg assistance : but I was not going to disobey the master — I never dare disobey him , Mrs. Dean , and though I thought it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for , it was no concern of mine , either to advise or complain ; and I always refused to meddle . Once or twice , after we had gone to bed , I 've happened to open my door again , and seen her sitting crying , on the stairs ' top ; and then I 've shut myself in , quick , for fear of being moved to interfere . I did pity her then , I 'm sure ; still I did n't wish to lose my place , you know ! At last , one night she came boldly into my chamber , and frightened me out of my wits , by saying "
126863	126892	126893	126893	She	2322	" Having uttered this speech , she vanished again . I lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling — Nothing stirred — the house was quiet . "
126914	126977	126978	126978	I	0	" And I began to dose . But my sleep was marred a second time , by a sharp ringing of the bell — the only bell we have , put up on purpose for Linton , and the master called to me , to see what was the matter , and inform them that he would n't have that noise repeated . "
127058	127075	127053	127053	he	475	" ' Now — Catherine , ' he said , ' how do you feel ? ' "
127081	127094	127117	127117	she	56	" How do you feel , Catherine ? ' he repeated . ' "
127155	127276	127281	127281	he	2326	" And she looked like it , too ! I gave her a little wine . Hareton and Joseph who had been wakened by the ringing , and the sound of feet , and heard our talk from outside , now entered . Joseph was fain , I believe , of the lad 's removal : Hareton seemed a thought bothered , though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton . But the master bid him get off to bed again — we did n't want his help . He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber , and told me to return to mine , and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself . "
127325	127509	127322	127322	he	43	" ' Well , let her be till after the funeral ; and go up dow and then to get her what is needful ; and as soon as she seems better , tell me . ' Cathy stayed up - stairs a fortnight , according to Zillah , who visited her twice a - day , and would have been rather more friendly , but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled . Heathcliff went up once , to show her Linton 's will . He had bequeathed the whole of his , and what had been her moveable property to his father . The poor creature was threatened , or coaxed into that act , during her week 's absence , when his uncle died . The lands , being a minor he could not meddle with . However , Mr. Heathcliff has claimed , and kept them in his wife 's right , and his also — I suppose legally , at any rate Catherine , destitute of cash and friends , can not disturb his possession . "
127512	127516	127510	127510	Nobody	442	" said Zillah , "
127553	127645	127646	127646	Joseph	45	" She had cried out , when I carried up her dinner that she could n't bear any longer being in the cold ; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange ; and Earnshaw and I need n't hinder her from descending ; so , as soon as she heard Heathcliff 's horse trot off , she made her appearance , donned in black , and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears , as plain as a quaker , she could n't comb them out . "
127700	127705	127706	127706	she	71	" Joseph had gone , "
127709	127796	127706	127706	she	71	" but I thought proper to bide at home . Young folks are always the better for an elder 's over - looking , and Hareton with all his bashfulness , is n't a model of nice behaviour . I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us , and she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected , so he had as good leave his guns , and bits of in - door work alone , while she stayed . "
127894	127900	127901	127901	she	2343	" Now , Mrs. Dean , "
127913	127995	127901	127901	she	2343	" you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton , and happen you 're right — but , I own , I should love well to bring her pride a peg lower . And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her , now ? She 's as poor as you , or I — poorer — I'll be bound , you 're saving — and I 'm doing my little all , that road . "
128041	128046	128047	128047	she	49	" Missis walked in , "
128050	128112	128047	128047	she	49	" as chill as an icicle , and as high as a princess . got up and offered her my seat in the arm«chair . No , she turned up her nose at my civility . Earnshaw rose too , and bid her come to the settle , and sit close by the fire ; he was sure she was starved . "
128138	128158	128124	128124	she	49	" And she got a chair for herself , and placed it at a distance from both of us . "
128202	128238	128182	128182	she	49	" Her cousin , after watching her endeavours a while , at last summoned courage to help her ; she held her frock , and he filled it with the first that came to hand . "
128333	128446	128467	128467	she	49	" She continued reading , or seeking for something to read . His attention became , by degrees , quite centred in the study of her thick , silky curls — her face he could n't see , and she could n't see him . And , perhaps , not quite awake to what he did , but attracted like a child to a candle , at last , he proceeded from staring to touching ; he put out his hand and stroked one curl , as gently as if it were a bird . He might have stuck a knife into her neck , she started round in such a taking . "
128497	128543	128546	128546	you	2768	" Mr. Hareton recoiled , looking as foolish as he could do ; he sat down in the settle , very quiet , and she continued turning over her volumes , another half hour — finally , Earnshaw crossed over , and whispered to me . "
128587	128620	128621	128621	She	49	" ' Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us , ma'am , ' I said , immediately . ' He 'd take it very kind — he'd be much obliged . ' "
128631	128731	128621	128621	She	49	" ' Mr. Hareton , and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocricy to offer ! I despise you , and will have nothing to say to any of you ! When I would have given my life for one kind word , even to see one of your faces , you all kept off . But I wo n't complain to you ! I 'm driven down here by the cold , not either to amuse you , or enjoy your society . ' "
128752	128777	128791	128791	he	0	" ' Oh ! you are an exception , ' answered Mrs. Heathcliff . ' I never missed such a concern as you . ' "
128813	128843	128844	128844	Hareton	47	" ' Be silent ! I 'll go out of doors , or anywhere , rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear ! ' said my lady . "
128871	129017	128862	128862	himself	47	" He talked now , freely enough ; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude ; but the frost had set in , and , in spite of her pride , she was forced to condescend to our company , more and more . However , I took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature — ever since , I 've been as stiff as herself — and she has no lover , or liker among us — and she does not deserve one — for , let them say the least word to her , and she 'll curl back without respect of any one ! She 'll snap at the master himself ; and , as good as dares him to thrash her ; and the more hurt she gets , the more venomous she grows . "
129099	129475	129476	129476	She	2354	" Thus ended Mrs. Dean 's story . Notwithstanding the doctor 's prophecy , I am rapidly recovering strength , and , though it be only the second week in January , I propose getting out on horseback , in a day or two , and riding over to Wuthering Heights , to inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six months in London ; and , if he likes , he may look out for another tenant to take the place , after October — I would not pass another winter here , for much . Yesterday was bright , calm , and frosty . I went to the Heights as I proposed ; my house - keeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady , and I did not refuse , for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request . The front door stood open , but the jealous gate was fastened , as at my last visit ; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden beds ; he unchained it , and I entered . The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen . I took particular notice of him this time ; but then , he does his best , apparently , to make the least of his advantages . I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home ? He answered , no ; but he would be in at dinner - time . It was eleven o'clock , and I announced my intention of going in , and waiting for him , at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me , in the office of watchdog , not as a substitute for the host . We entered together ; Catherine was there , making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal ; she looked more sulky , and less spirited than when I had seen her first . She hardly raised her eyes to notice me , and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness , as before ; never returning my bow and good morning , by the slightest acknowledgment . "
129483	129487	129476	129476	She	2354	" I thought , "
129511	129523	129497	129497	She	2354	" Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen . "
129528	129611	129526	129526	yourself	2357	" she said ; pushing them from her , as soon as she had done ; and retiring to a stool by the window , where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts , out of the turnip parings in her lap . I approached her , pretending to desire a view of the garden ; and , as I fancied , adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean 's note onto her knee , unnoticed by Hareton — but she asked aloud — "
129616	129622	129497	129497	She	2354	" And chucked it off . "
129636	129797	129626	129628	your old acquaintance	2358	" I answered , annoyed at her exposing my kind deed , and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own . She would gladly have gathered it up , at this information , but Hareton beat her ; he seized , and put it in his waistcoat , saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first . Thereat , Catherine silently turned her face from us , and , very stealthily , drew out her pocket - handkerchief and applied it to her eyes ; and her cousin , after struggling a while to keep down his softer feelings , pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could . Catherine caught , and perused it eagerly ; then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates , rational and irrational , of her former home ; and gazing towards the hills , murmured in soliloquy . "
129828	129868	129869	129870	Mrs. Heathcliff	48	" And she leant her pretty head back against the sill , with half a yawn and half a sigh , and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness , neither caring , nor knowing whether we remarked her . "
129872	129882	129869	129870	Mrs. Heathcliff	48	" I said , after sitting some time mute , "
129952	129963	129943	129943	you	48	" She appeared to wonder at this speech and asked , "
129969	129970	129943	129943	you	48	" "
129976	129981	129943	129943	you	48	" I replied unhesitatingly . "
129987	129991	129982	129982	You	0	" she continued , "
130019	130020	129985	129985	her	2362	" "
130024	130028	129985	129985	her	2362	" I exclaimed . "
130075	130076	130077	130077	I	0	" "
130087	130091	130077	130077	I	0	" said Catherine , "
130264	130290	130256	130256	you	47	" Earnshaw blushed crimson , when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations , and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations . "
130302	130311	130312	130312	He	47	" I said , coming to his rescue . "
130332	130333	130335	130335	he	47	" "
130346	130350	130335	130335	he	47	" answered Catherine . "
130421	130481	130396	130396	you	47	" The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance , and then laughed at for trying to remove it . I had a similar notion , and , remembering Mrs. Dean 's anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared , I observed , "
130521	130522	130542	130542	he	47	" "
130525	130529	130542	130542	he	47	" she replied , "
130622	130720	130601	130601	he	47	" Hareton 's chest heaved in silence a minute ; be laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath , which it was no easy task to suppress . I rose , and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment , took up my station in the door - way surveying the external prospect , as I stood . He followed my example , and left the room , but presently re - appeared , bearing half - a - dozen volumes in his hands , which he threw into Catherine 's lap , exclaiming , "
130739	130740	130741	130741	I	0	" "
130749	130753	130741	130741	I	0	" she answered . "
130765	130798	130754	130754	I	0	" She opened one that had obviously been often turned over , and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner ; then laughed , and threw it from her . "
130802	131021	130754	130754	I	0	" she continued provokingly , commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion . But his self - love would endure no further torment — I heard , and not altogether disapprovingly , a manual check given to her saucy tongue — The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin 's sensitive though uncultivated feelings , and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflicter . He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire . I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen — I fancied that as they consumed , he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted ; and the triumph , and ever increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them — and I fancied , I guessed the incitement to his secret studies , also . He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjyoments , till Catherine crossed his path — Shame at her scorn , and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits ; and instead of guarding him from one , and winning him the other , his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result . "
131040	131057	131058	131058	You	2376	" cried Catherine , sucking her damaged lip , and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes . "
131067	131125	131062	131062	your	2376	" he answered fiercely . And his agitation precluding further speech , he advanced hastily to the entrance , where I made way for him to pass . But , ere he had crossed the door - stones , Mr. Heathcliff , coming up the causeway , encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder , asked . "
131135	131136	131062	131062	your	2376	" "
131141	131166	131062	131062	your	2376	" he said , and broke away , to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude . Heathcliff gazed after him , and sighed . "
131177	131188	131173	131173	I	0	" he muttered , unconscious that I was behind him . "
131224	131288	131222	131222	him	677	" He bent his eyes to the ground , and walked moodily in . There was a restless , anxious expression in his countenance , I had never remarked there before , and he looked sparer in person . His daughter - in - law on perceiving him through the window , immediately escaped to the kitchen , so that I remained alone . "
131303	131312	131300	131301	Mr. Lockwood	44	" he said in reply to my greeting , "
131345	131346	131332	131332	I	0	" "
131355	131360	131353	131353	sir	2571	" was my answer , "
131419	131437	131438	131438	he	2571	" Oh , indeed ! you 're tired of being banished from the world , are you ? "
131441	131478	131438	131438	he	2571	" But , if you be coming to plead off paying for a place , you wo n't occupy , your journey is useless — I never relent in exacting my due , from any one . "
131479	131490	131491	131491	I	0	" I 'm coming to plead off nothing about it ! "
131497	131510	131512	131512	I	0	" Should you wish it , I 'll settle with you now , "
131520	131525	131526	131526	he	2571	" No , no , "
131530	131592	131526	131526	he	2571	" you 'll leave sufficient behind , to cover your debts , if you fail to return . . .I'm not in such a hurry — sit down and take your dinner with us — a guest that is safe from repeating his visit , can generally be made welcome — Catherine ! bring the things in — where are you ? "
131606	131615	131593	131593	Catherine	56	" You may get your dinner with Joseph , "
131620	131631	131593	131593	Catherine	56	" and remain in the kitchen till he is gone . "
131751	131761	131762	131762	I	0	" How dreary life gets over in that house ! "
131771	131819	131762	131762	I	0	" What a realization of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff , had she and I struck up an attachment , as her good nurse desired , and migrated together , into the stirring atmosphere of the town ! "
131895	131917	131892	131892	he	2392	" Yon 's frough Gimmerton , nah ! They 're alias three wick ' after other folk wi ' ther harvest . "
131918	131921	131922	131922	I	0	" Gimmerton ? "
131937	131950	131922	131922	I	0	" Ah ! I know ! How far is it from this ? "
131951	131966	131967	131967	he	2392	" Happen fourteen mile ' o'er th ' hills , and a rough road , "
132266	132272	132273	132273	I	0	" Is Mrs. Dean within ? "
132279	132285	132286	132286	she	2879	" Mistress Dean ? Nay ! "
132289	132304	132286	132286	she	2879	" shoo does n't bide here ; shoe 's up at th ' Heights . "
132305	132313	132314	132314	I	0	" Are you the housekeeper , then ? "
132317	132326	132327	132327	she	2879	" Eea , Aw keep th ' hause , "
132330	132360	132327	132327	she	2879	" Well , I 'm Mr. Lockwood , the master — Are there any rooms to lodge me in , I wonder ? I wish to stay here all night "
132361	132366	132367	132367	she	2879	" T ' maister ! "
132372	132585	132367	132367	she	2879	" Whet , whoiver knew yah wur coming ? Yah sud ha ' send word ! They 's nowt norther dry — nor mensful abaht t ' place — nowt there is n't ! ' She threw down her pipe and bustled in , the girl followed , and I entered too ; soon perceiving that her report was true , and , moreover , that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition . I bid her be composed — I would go out for a walk ; and , meantime , she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting - room for me to sup in , and a bed - room to sleep in — No sweeping and dusting , only good fires and dry sheets were necessary . She seemed willing to do her best ; though she thrust the hearth - brush into the grates in mistake for the poker ; and mal - appropriated several other articles of her craft ; but I retired , confiding in her energy for a resting - place against my return . Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion . An after - thought brought me back , when I had quitted the court . "
132592	132599	132367	132367	she	2879	" I enquired of the woman . "
132607	132934	132604	132605	Ee knaw	163	" she answered , skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders . I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange ; but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis , so , I turned away and made my exit , rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind , and the mild glory of a rising moon in front ; one fading , and the other brightening , as I quitted the park , and climbed the stony by - road branching off to Mr. Heathcliff 's dwelling . Before I arrived in sight of it , all that remained of day was a beamless , amber light along the west ; but I could see every pebble on the path , and every blade of grass by that splendid moon . I had neither to climb the gate , nor to knock — it yielded to my hand . That is an improvement ! I thought . And I noticed another , by the aid of my nostrils ; a fragrance of stocks and wall flowers , wafted on the air , from amongst the homely fruit trees . Both doors and lattices were open ; and , yet , as is usually the case in a coal district , a fine , red fire illumined the chimney ; the comfort which the eye derives from it , renders the extra heat endurable . But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large , that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence ; and , accordingly , what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows . I could both see them and hear them talk before I entered ; and , looked and listened in consequence , being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity , and envy that grew as I lingered . "
132939	132949	132955	132955	you	2415	" said a voice , as sweet as a silver bell—"That
132976	132977	132958	132958	I	0	" "
132982	133004	132958	132958	I	0	" answered another , in deep , but softened tones . And now , kiss me , for minding so well . "
133005	133019	133020	133022	The male speaker	2416	" No , read it over first correctly , without a single mistake . "
133344	133371	133373	133377	the tenant of the kitchen	2430	" Aw'd rayther , by th ' haulf , hev 'em swearing i ' my lugs frough morn tuh neeght , nur hearken yah , hahsiver ! "
133389	133460	133461	133461	he	2430	" It 's a blazing shaime , ut Aw cannut oppen t ' Blessed Book , bud yah set up them glories tuh sattan , un ' all t ' flay some wickednesses ut iver wer born intuh t ' warld ! Oh ! yah're a raight nowt ; un ' shoo 's another ; un ' that poor lad ' ull be lost , atween ye . Poor lad ! "
133468	133495	133461	133461	he	2430	" he 's witched , Aw'm sartin on't ! O , Lord , judge 'em , fur they 's norther law nur justice amang wer rullers ! "
133496	133511	133513	133514	the singer	2432	" No ! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots , I suppose , "
133516	133553	133513	133514	the singer	2432	" But wisht , old man , and read your Bible , like a christian , and never mind me . This is ' Fairy Annie 's Wedding'—a bonny tune — it goes to a dance . "
133578	133612	133570	133570	she	71	" Why , bless you , Mr. Lockwood ! How could you think of returning in this way ? All 's shut up at Thrushcross Grange . You should have given us notice ! "
133613	133630	133631	133631	I	0	" I 've arranged to be accommodated there , for as long as I shall stay , "
133634	133656	133631	133631	I	0	" I depart again to - morrow . And how are you transplanted here , Mrs. Dean ? tell me that . "
133657	133697	133570	133570	she	71	" Zillah left , and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come , soon after you went to London , and stay till you returned . But , step in , pray ! Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening ? "
133698	133703	133704	133704	I	0	" From the Grange , "
133707	133741	133704	133704	I	0	" and , while they make me lodging room there , I want to finish my business with your master , because I do n't think of having another opportunity in a hurry . "
133742	133748	133750	133750	Nelly	80	" What business , sir ? "
133758	133773	133750	133750	Nelly	80	" He 's gone out , at present , and wo nt return soon . "
133774	133779	133780	133780	I	0	" About the rent , "
133783	133796	133797	133797	she	80	" Oh ! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle , "
133800	133827	133797	133797	she	80	" or rather with me . She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet , and I act for her ; there 's nobody else . "
133832	133847	133848	133848	she	80	" Ah ! you have not heard of Heathcliff 's death , I see ! "
133851	133855	133848	133848	she	80	" Heathcliff dead ? "
133861	133866	133848	133848	she	80	" How long ago ? "
133867	133905	133797	133797	she	80	" Three months since — but , sit down , and let me take your hat , and I 'll tell you all about it . Stop , you have had nothing to eat , have you ? "
133906	133954	133848	133848	she	80	" I want nothing . I have ordered supper at home . You sit down too . I never dreamt ot his dying ! Let me hear how it came to pass You say you do n't expect them back for some time — the young people ? "
133955	134000	134001	134001	She	2434	" No — I have to scold them every evening , for their late rambles — but they do n't care for me . At least , have a drink of our old ale — it will do you good — you seem weary . "
134019	134062	134015	134015	Joseph	45	" it warn't a crying scandal that she should have fellies at her time of life ? And then , to get them jocks out uh t ' Maister 's cellar ! He fair shaamed to ' bide still and see it . "
134110	134112	134107	134107	He	43	" queer "
134120	134136	134137	134137	she	2434	" I was summoned to Wuthering Heights , within a fortnight of your leaving us , "
134140	134151	134137	134137	she	2434	" and I obeyed joyfully , for Catherine 's sake . "
134236	134282	134224	134224	he	43	" She seemed pleased at this arrangement ; and , by degrees , I smuggled over a great number of books , and other articles , that had formed her amusement at the Grange ; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort . "
134376	134505	134521	134521	she	2443	" I did not mind their skirmishes ; but Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also , when the master wanted to have the house to himself ; and , though , in the beginning , she either left it at his approach , or quietly joined in my occupations , and shunned remarking , or addressing him — and though he was always as sullen and silent , as possible — after a while , she changed her behaviour , and became incapable of letting him alone . Talking at him ; commenting on his stupidity and idleness ; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived — how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire , and dozing . "
134525	134584	134521	134521	she	2443	" or a cart - horse ? He does his work , eats his food , and sleeps , eternally ! What a blank , dreary mind he must have ! Do you ever dream , Hareton ? And , if you do , what is it about ? But , you ca n't speak to me ! ' "
134603	134631	134586	134586	she	2443	" ' He 's perhaps , dreaming now , ' she continued . ' He twitched his shoulder as Juno twitches hers . Ask him , Ellen . "
134632	134676	134693	134693	she	2445	" ' Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up stairs , if you do n't behave ! ' I said . He had not only twitched his shoulder , but clenched his fist , as if tempted to use it . "
134748	134765	134772	134772	she	2445	" ' Were not you naughty ? ' I said ; ' answer me that . ' "
134808	134841	134851	134851	she	2445	" She placed one she had been perusing on his hand ; he flung it off , and muttered , if she did not give over , he would break her neck . "
134868	135134	134851	134851	she	2445	" Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it , and departed . But he would not come near it , and so I informed her in the morning , to her great disappointment . I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence — her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself — she had done it effectually . But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury ; while I ironed , or pursued other stationary employments I could not well do in in the parlour — she would bring some pleasant volume , and read it aloud to me . When Hareton was there , she generally paused in an interesting part , and left the book lying about — that she did repeatedly ; but he was as obstinate as a mule , and , instead of snatching at her bait , in wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph , and they sat like automatons , one on each side of the fire , the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense , as he would have called it , the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it . On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions , and Catherine yawned and sighed , and teased me to talk to her , and ran off into the court or garden , the moment I began ; and , as a last resource , cried and said , she was tired of living , her life was useless . "
135237	135280	135231	135231	he	43	" It suited Catherine to have him there : at any rate , it made her hate her room up stairs , more than ever ; and she would compel me to find out business below , that she might accompany me . "
135376	135416	135363	135364	her cousin	462	" At a notice that I could do with her no longer , intercepting my light , she removed to the hearthstone . I bestowed little attention on her proceedings , but , presently , I heard her begin — "
135461	135467	135480	135480	she	2455	" Hareton returned no answer . "
135483	135499	135480	135480	she	2455	" ' Get off wi ' ye ! ' he growled , with uncompromising gruffness . "
135523	135549	135508	135508	she	2455	" Before he could attempt to recover it , it was broken , and behind the fire . He swore at her and seized another . "
135581	135603	135554	135554	she	2455	" ' Will you go to the devil ! ' he exclaimed , ferociously , ' and let me be ! ' "
135680	135740	135741	135741	Catherine	56	" ' I shall have naught to do wi ' you , and your mucky pride , and your damned , mocking tricks ! ' he answered . ' I 'll go to hell , body and soul , before I look sideways after you again ! side out of t ' gait , now ; this minute ! ' "
135773	135823	135829	135829	he	2458	" ' You should be friends with your cousin , Mr. Hareton , ' I interrupted , ' since she repents of her sauciness ! it would do you a great deal of good — it would make you another man , to have her for a companion . ' "
135872	135914	135916	135916	You	2461	" ' It is not I who hate you , it is you who hate me ! ' wept Cathy , no longer disguising her trouble . ' You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does , and more . ' "
135981	136032	136033	136033	She	2461	" ' I did n't know you took my part , ' she answered , drying her eyes ; ' and I was miserable and bitter at every body ; but , now I thank you , and beg you to forgive me , what can I do besides ? ' "
136045	136071	136042	136042	her	2461	" He blackened , and scowled like a thunder cloud , and kept his fists resolutely clenched , and his gaze fixed on the ground . "
136116	136144	136104	136104	she	56	" The little rogue thought I had not seen her , and , drawing back , she took her former station by the window , quite demurely . "
136159	136202	136153	136153	she	2461	" ' Well ! what should I have done , Ellen ? He would n't shake hands , and he would n't look — I must show him some way that I like him , that I want to be friends . ' "
136248	136299	136323	136323	she	2466	" Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper ; and having tied it with a bit of ribband , and addressed it to ' Mr. Hareton Earnshaw , ' she desired me to be her ambassadress , and convey the present to its destined recipient . "
136347	136474	136323	136323	she	2466	" I carried it , and repeated the message , anxiously watched by my employer . Hareton would not open his fingers , so I laid it on his knee . He did not strike it off either . I returned to my work : Catherine leaned her head and arms on the table , till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed , then she stole away , and quietly seated herself beside her cousin . He trembled , and his face glowed — all his rudeness , and all his surly harshness had deserted him — he could not summon courage , at first , to utter a syllable , in reply to her questioning look , and her murmured petition . "
136499	136505	136485	136485	You	2468	" He muttered something inaudible . "
136520	136559	136516	136516	Catherine	56	" ' Nay ! you 'll be ashamed of me every day of your life , ' he answered . ' And the more , the more you know me , and I can not bide it . ' "
136585	136639	136571	136571	she	56	" I overheard no further distinguishable talk ; but on looking round again , I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book , that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified , on both sides , and the enemies were , thenceforth , sworn allies . "
136779	136832	136772	136772	he	45	" ' Tak ' these in tuh t ' maister , lad , ' he said , ' un ' bide theare ; Aw 's gang up tuh my awn rahm . This hoile 's norther mensful , nor seemly fur us — we mun side aht , and seearch another ! ' "
136862	136902	136921	136921	Joseph	45	" ' It is not eight o'clock ! ' she answered , rising unwillingly , ' Hareton , I 'll leave this book upon the chimney - piece , and I 'll bring some more to - morrow . ' "
136945	136999	136921	136921	Joseph	45	" Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers ; and , smiling as she passed Hareton , went singing up stairs , lighter of heart , I venture to say , than ever she had been under that roof before ; except , perhaps , during her earliest visits to Linton . "
137076	137142	137066	137066	they	2478	" You see , Mr. Lockwood , it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff 's heart ; but now , I 'm glad you did not try — the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two ; I shall envy no one on their wedding - day — there wo n't be a happier woman than myself in England ! "
137143	137255	137256	137256	I	0	" On the morrow of that Monday , Earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments , and , therefore , remaining about the house , I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me , as heretofore . She got down stairs before me , and out into the garden ; where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work ; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast , I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes , and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the Grange . "
137301	137382	137285	137285	she	2480	" ' There ! That will be all shewn to the master , ' I exclaimed , ' the minute it is discovered . And what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden ? We shall have a fine explosion on the head of it : see if we do n't ! Mr. Hareton , I wonder you should have no more wit , than to go and make that mess at her bidding ! ' "
137410	137477	137401	137401	I	0	" We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff . I held the mistress 's post in making tea and carving ; so I was indispensable at table . Catherine usually sat by me ; but to - day , she stole nearer to Hareton , and I presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship , than she had in her hostility . "
137523	137535	137540	137540	she	2486	" ' I 'm not going to , ' she answered . "
137556	137654	137540	137540	she	2486	" He dared not speak to her , there ; he dared hardly look ; and yet she went on teasing , till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh ; and I frowned , and then , she glanced towards the master , whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company , as his countenance evinced , and she grew serious for an instant , scrutinizing him with deep gravity . Afterwards she turned , and re - commenced her nonsense ; at last , Hareton uttered a smothered laugh . "
137684	137695	137696	137696	he	43	" It is well you are out of my reach ; "
137699	137740	137696	137696	he	43	" What fiend possesses you to stare back at me , continually , with those infernal eyes ? Down with them ! and do n't remind me of your existence again . I thought I had cured you of laughing ! "
137741	137746	137748	137748	Hareton	47	" It was me , "
137750	137756	137758	137759	the master	430	" What do you say ? "
137890	138051	137887	137887	he	45	" Aw mun hev my wage , and Aw mun goa ! Aw he d aimed tuh dee , wheare Aw'd sarved fur sixty year ; un ' Aw thowt Aw'd lug my books up intuh t ' garret , un ' all my bits uh stuff , un ' they sud hev t ' kitchen tuh theirseln ; fur t ' sake uh quietness .

138052	138059	138061	138061	Heathcliff	43	" Now , now , idiot ! "
138063	138098	138061	138061	Heathcliff	43	" cut it short ! What 's your grievance ? I 'll interfere in no quarrels between you , and Nelly — She may thrust you into the coal - hole for anything I care "
138099	138105	138107	138107	Joseph	45	" It 's noan Nelly ! "
138109	138226	138229	138229	he	2493	" Aw sudn't shift fur Nelly — Nasty , ill nowt as shoo is , Thank God ! shoo can not stale t'sowl uh nob'dy !

138250	138256	138258	138259	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" Is the fool drunk ? "
138261	138272	138258	138259	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" Hareton is it you he 's finding fault with ? "
138273	138282	138284	138286	the young man	259	" Iv'e pulled up two or three bushes , "
138288	138298	138284	138286	the young man	259	" but I 'm going to set 'em again . "
138307	138319	138302	138302	you	259	" said the master . Catherine wisely put in her tongue . "
138328	138332	138320	138320	We	2495	" she cried . "
138349	138350	138344	138344	him	2493	" "
138366	138378	138353	138354	the devil	2631	" demanded her father - in - law , much surprised , "
138387	138403	138404	138404	You	259	" he added turning to Hareton . The latter was speechless ; his cousin replied — "
138427	138428	138429	138429	Your	259	" "
138440	138444	138446	138446	my	0	" said Heathcliff . "
138449	138473	138446	138446	my	0	" she continued , returning his angry glare , and meantime , biting a piece of crust , the remnant of her breakfast . "
138476	138480	138517	138517	him	47	" he exclaimed . "
138487	138488	138490	138490	Hareton	47	" "
138498	138504	138505	138505	Hareton	47	" pursued the reckless thing . "
138522	138551	138514	138514	I	0	" The master seemed confounded a moment , he grew pale , and rose up , eyeing her all the while , with an expression of mortal hate . "
138566	138575	138563	138563	she	259	" so you may as well sit down . "
138576	138595	138597	138597	Heathcliff	43	" If Hareton does not turn you out of the room , I 'll strike him to Hell , "
138599	138644	138648	138648	his	47	" Damnable witch ! dare you pretend to rouse him against me ? Off with her ! Do you hear ? Fling her into the kitchen ! I 'll kill her , Ellen Dean , if you let her come into my sight again ! "
138656	138661	138662	138662	he	47	" Drag her away ! "
138666	138673	138675	138675	he	47	" Are you staying to talk ? "
138683	138696	138698	138698	Catherine	56	" He 'll not obey you , wicked man , any more ! "
138713	138714	138701	138701	he	47	" "
138719	138726	138701	138701	he	47	" muttered the young man reproachfully . "
138740	138741	138747	138747	him	47	" "
138751	138755	138743	138743	you	47	" she cried . "
138759	138776	138743	138743	you	47	" he whispered earnestly . It was too late — Heathcliff had caught hold of her . "
138781	138787	138778	138778	you	47	" he said to Earnshaw . "
138815	138924	138793	138793	she	2504	" He had his hand in her hair ; Hareton attempted to release the locks , entreating him not to hurt her that once . His black eyes flashed , he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces , and I was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue , when of a sudden , his fingers relaxed , he shifted hs grasp from her head , to her arm , and gazed intently in her face — Then , he drew his hand over his eyes , stood a moment to collect himself apparently , and turning anew to Catherine , said with assumed calmness , "
139016	139872	139014	139014	me	0	" I led my young lady out ; she was too glad of her escape , to resist ; the other followed , and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself , till dinner . I had counselled Catherine to get hers upstairs ; but , as soon as he perceived her vacant seat , he sent me to call her . He spoke to none of us , eat very little , and went out directly afterwards , intimating that he should not return before evening . The two new friends established themselves in the house , during his absence , where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin , on her offering a revelation of her father - in - law 's conduct to his father . He said he would n't suffer a word to be uttered to him , in his disparagement ; if he were the devil , it did n't signify ; he would stand by him ; and he 'd rather she would abuse himself , as she used to , than begin on Mr. Heathcliff . Catherine was waxing cross at this ; but he found means to make her hold her tongue , by asking , how she would like him to speak ill of her father ? and then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master 's reputation home to himself : and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break — chains , forged by habit , which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen . She showed a good heart , thenceforth , in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff ; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton — indeed , I do n't believe she has ever breathed a syllable , in the latter 's hearing , against her oppressor , since . When this slight disagreement was over , they were thick again , and as busy as possible , in their several occupations , of pupil , and teacher , I came in to sit with them , after I had done my work , and I felt so soothed , and comforted to watch them , that I did not notice how time got on . You know , they both appeared in a measure , my children : I had long been proud of one , and now , I was sure , the other would be a source of equal satisfaction . His honest , warm , and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance , and degradation in which it had been bred ; and Catherine 's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry . His brightening mind brightened his features , and added spirit and nobility to their aspect — I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights , after her expedition to the Crags . While I admired , and they laboured , dusk drew on , and with it returned the master . He came upon us quite unexpectedly , entering by the front way , and had a full view of the whole three , ere we could raise our heads to glance at him . Well , I reflected , there was never a pleasanter , or more harmless sight ; and it will be a burning shame to scold them . The red fire - light glowed on their two bonny heads , and revealed their faces , animated with the eager interest of children ; for , though he was twenty - three , and she eighteen , each had so much of novelty to feel , and learn , that neither experienced , nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity . They lifted their eyes together , to encounter Mr. Heathcliff — perhaps , you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar , and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw . The present Catherine has no other likeness to her , except a breadth of forehead , and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty , whether she will , or not . With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther , it is singular , at all times — then it was particularly striking : because his senses were alert , and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity . I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff : he walked to the hearth in evident agitation , but it quickly subsided , as he looked at the young man ; or , I should say , altered its character , for it was there yet . He took the book from his hand , and glanced at the open page , then returned it without any observation ; merely signing Catherine away — her companion lingered very little behind her , and I was about to depart also , but he bid me sit still . "
139883	139899	139014	139014	me	0	" he observed , having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed . "
140061	140195	140196	140196	he	2512	" Nelly , there is a strange change approaching — I'm in its shadow at present — I take so little interest in my daily life , that I hardly remember to eat , and drink — Those two , who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me ; and , that appearance causes me pain , amounting to agony . About her I wo n't speak ; and I do n't desire to think ; but I earnestly wish she were invisible — her presence invokes only maddening sensations . He moves me differently ; and yet if I could do it without seeming insane , I 'd never see him again ! You 'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so , "
140205	140261	140196	140196	he	2512	" if I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations , and ideas he awakens , or embodies — But you 'll not talk of what I tell you , and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself , it is tempting , at last , to turn it out to another . "
140302	140444	140279	140279	I	0	" In the first place , his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her — That however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination , is actually the least — for what is not connected with her to me ? and what does not recall her ? I can not look down to this floor , but her features are shaped on the flags ! In every cloud , in every tree — filling the air at night , and caught by glimpses in every object , by day I am surrounded with her image ! The most ordinary faces of men , and women — my own features mock me with a resemblance . The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist , and that I have lost her ! "
140480	140552	140459	140459	my	0	" But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you ; only it will let you know , why , with a reluctance to be always alone , his society is no benefit , rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer — and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together . I can give them no attention , any more . "
140565	140651	140556	140556	you	0	" I said , alarmed at his manner , though he was neither in danger of losing his senses , nor dying , according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy ; and , as to his reason , from childhood , he had a delight in dwelling on dark things , and entertaining odd fancies — he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol ; but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine . "
140662	140666	140667	140667	I	0	" he said , "
140676	140677	140678	140678	You	0	" "
140688	140692	140686	140686	you	0	" I asked . "
140701	140705	140697	140697	I	0	" he answered . "
140715	140719	140708	140708	you	0	" I pursued . "
140722	140725	140726	140726	he	0	" No ! "
140729	140923	140726	140726	he	0	" I have neither a fear , nor a presentiment , nor a hope of death — Why should I ? With my hard constitution , and temperate mode of living , and unperilous occupations , I ought to , and probably shall remain above ground , till there is scarcely a black hair on my head — And yet I can not continue in this condition!—I have to remind myself to breathe — almost to remind my heart to beat ! And it is like bending back a stiff spring . . .it is by compulsion , that I do the slightest act , not prompted by one thought , and by compulsion , that I notice anything alive , or dead , which is not associated with one universal idea . . .I have a single wish , and my whole being , and faculties are yearning to attain it . They have yearned towards it so long , and so unwaveringly , that I 'm convinced it will be reached — and soon — because it has devoured my existence — I am swallowed in the anticipation of its fulfilment . "
140965	141250	140951	140951	God	66	" He began to pace the room , muttering terrible things to himself ; till I was inclined to believe , as he said Joseph did , that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell — I wondered greatly how it would end . Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind , even by looks , it was his habitual mood , I had no doubt : he asserted it himself — but , not a soul , from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact . You did not , when you saw him , Mr. Lockwood — and at the period of which I speak , he was just the same as then , only fonder of continued solitude , and perhaps still more laconic in company . For some days after that evening , Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals ; yet he would not consent , formally , to exclude Hareton and Cathy . He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings , chosing , rather , to absent himself — And eating once in twenty - four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him . One night , after the family were in bed , I heard him go down stairs , and out at the front door : I did not hear him re - enter and , in the morning , I found he was still away . We were in April then , the weather was sweet and warm , the grass as green as showers and sun could make it , and the two dwarf apple trees , near the southern wail , in full bloom . "
141316	141371	141380	141380	she	54	" I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around , and the beautiful soft blue overhead , when my young lady , who had run down near the gate , to procure some primrose roots for a border , returned only half laden , and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was coming in . "
141387	141398	141380	141380	she	54	" ' What did he say ? ' asked Hareton . "
141415	141435	141412	141412	she	54	" But he looked so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him . "
141443	141470	141440	141440	he	45	" ' Why , almost bright and cheerful — No , almost nothing — very much excited , and wild and glad ! ' she replied . "
141480	141532	141533	141533	Heathcliff	43	" I remarked , affecting a careless manner . In reality , as surprised as she was ; and , anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement , for to see the master looking glad would not be an every day spectacle , I framed an excuse to go in . "
141571	141594	141552	141552	he	43	" ' Will you have some breakfast ? ' I said , ' You must be hungry rambling about all night ! ' "
141613	141651	141652	141652	I	0	" ' No , I 'm not hungry , ' he answered , averting his head , and speaking rather contemptuously , as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour . "
141674	141736	141746	141746	he	0	" ' I do n't think it right to wander out of doors , ' I observed , ' instead of being in bed : it is not wise , at any rate , this moist season . I dare say you 'll catch a bad cold , or a fever — you have something the matter with you now ! ' "
141773	141792	141757	141757	you	0	" I obeyed ; and , in passing , I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat . "
141802	141822	141797	141797	I	0	" we shall have a fit of illness . I can not conceive what he has been doing ! ' "
141855	141895	141896	141896	He	0	" ' I 've neither cold , nor fever , Nelly , ' he remarked , in allusion to my morning 's speech . ' And I 'm ready to do justice to the food you give me . ' "
141938	141982	141992	141992	Catherine	54	" We saw him walking , to and fro , in the garden , while we concluded our meal ; and Earnshaw said he 'd go , and ask why he would not dine ; he thought we had grieved him some way . "
141999	142057	141992	141992	Catherine	54	" ' Nay , ' he answered , ' but he 's not angry ; he seemed rare and pleased indeed ; only , I made him impatient by speaking to him twice ; and then he bid me be off to you ; he wondered how I could want the company of any body else . ' "
142160	142180	142325	142325	I	0	" I will ask what is the matter , I thought , or who should ? And I exclaimed — "
142198	142231	142192	142192	You	0	" ' Where should good news come from , to me ? ' he said . ' I 'm animated with hunger ; and , seemingly , I must not eat . ' "
142251	142313	142239	142239	I	0	" ' I do n't want it now , ' he muttered , hastily . ' I 'll wait till supper . And , Nelly , once for all , let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from me . I wish to be troubled by nobody — I wish to have this place to myself . ' "
142360	142449	142239	142239	I	0	" ' You are putting the question through very idle curiosity , ' he interrupted , with a laugh . ' Yet , I 'll answer it . Last night , I was on the threshold of hell . To - day , I am within sight of my heaven — I have my eyes on it — hardly three feet to sever me ! And now you 'd better go — You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you , if you refrain from prying . ' "
142467	142511	142512	142512	He	2520	" He did not quit the house again that afternoon , and no one intruded on his solitude , till , at eight o'clock , I deemed it proper , though unsummoned , to carry a candle , and his supper to him . "
142597	142626	142737	142737	he	2520	" I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate , and commenced shutting the casements , one after another , till I came to his . "
142649	142729	142634	142634	I	0	" The light flashed on his features , as I spoke . Oh , Mr. Lockwood , I can not express what a terrible start I got , by the momentary view ! Those deep black eyes ! That smile , and ghastly paleness ! It appeared to me , not Mr. Heathcliff , but a goblin ; and , in my terror , I let the candle bend towards the wall , and it left me in darkness . "
142769	142785	142787	142788	The master	430	" I hurried out in a foolish state of dread , and said to Joseph — "
142860	142926	142929	142929	he	43	" We heard him mount the stairs directly ; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber , but turned into that with the panelled bed – its window , as I mentioned before , is wide enough for anybody to get through , and it struck me , that he plotted another midnight excursion , which he had rather we had no suspicion of . "
142998	143168	143169	143169	Dawn	167	" ' But , where did he come from , the little dark thing , harboured by a good man to his bane ? ' muttered superstition , as I dozed into unconsciousness . And I began , half dreaming , to weary myself with imaging some fit parentage for him ; and repeating my waking meditations , I tracked his existence over again , with grim variations ; at last , picturing his death and funeral ; of which , all I can remember is , being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument , and consulting the sexton about it ; and , as he had no surname , and we could not tell his age , we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word , ' Heathcliff . ' That came true ; we were . If you enter the kirkyard , you 'll read on his headstone , only that , and the date of his death . "
143207	143231	143298	143299	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" ' He has stayed at home , ' I thought , ' and he 'll be all right , to - day ! "
143232	143289	143298	143299	Mr. Heathcliff	43	" I prepared breakfast for the household ; as was my usual custom , but told Hareton , and Catherine to get theirs , ere the master came down , for he lay late . They preferred taking it out of doors , under the trees , and I set a little table to accommodate them . "
143346	143431	143324	143324	he	43	" When Joseph quitted the room , he took his seat in the place he generally chose , and I put a basin of coffee before him . He drew it nearer , and then rested his arms on the table , and looked at the opposite wall , as I supposed , surveying one particular portion , up and down , with glittering , restless eyes , and with such eager interest , that he stopped breathing , during half a minute together . "
143467	143492	143437	143437	I	0	" He did n't notice me , and yet he smiled . I 'd rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so . "
143521	143553	143500	143500	I	0	" ' Do nt , for God 's sake , shout so loud , ' he replied . ' Turn round , and tell me , are we by ourselves ? ' "
143571	143587	143595	143595	he	43	" Still , I involuntarily obeyed him , as if I were not quite sure . "
143617	143688	143595	143595	he	43	" Now , I perceived he was not looking at the wall , for when I regarded him alone , it seemed , exactly , that he gazed at something within two yards distance . And , whatever it was , it communicated , apparently , both pleasure and pain , in exquisite extremes , at least , the anguished , yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea . "
143719	143776	143777	143777	I	0	" I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food ; if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties , if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread , his fingers clenched , before they reached it , and remained on the table , forgetful of their aim . "
143846	143870	143836	143836	I	0	" Having uttered these words , he left the house ; slowly sauntered down the garden path , and disappeared through the gate . "
143954	144039	144040	144040	I	0	" I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff 's step , restlessly measuring the floor ; and he frequently broke the silence , by a deep inspiration , resembling a groan . He muttered detached words , also ; the only one , I could catch , was the name of Catherine , coupled with some wild term of endearment , or suffering ; and spoken as one would speak to a person present — low and earnest , and wrung from the depth of his soul . "
144100	144118	144091	144091	He	43	" ' Nelly , come here — is it morning ? Come in with your light . ' "
144125	144129	144091	144091	He	43	" I answered ; "
144149	144188	144091	144091	He	43	" ' No , I do n't wish to go up stairs , ' he said . ' Come in , and kindle me a fire , and do anything there is to do about the room . ' "
144214	144247	144204	144204	I	0	" He roamed to and fro , meantime , in a state approaching distraction : his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between . "
144325	144340	144342	144342	your	43	" ' I would not talk so , Mr. Heathcliff , ' I interposed . "
144462	144593	144600	144600	I	0	" ' It is not my fault , that I can not eat or rest , ' he replied . ' I assure you it is through no settled designs . I 'll do both , as soon as I possibly can . But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water , rest within arms - length of the shore ! I must reach it first , and then I 'll rest . Well , never mind , Mr. Green ; as to repenting of my injustices , I 've done no injustice , and I repent of nothing — I'm too happy , and yet I 'm not happy enough . My soul 's bliss kills my body , but does not satisfy itself . ' "
144628	144643	144653	144653	I	0	" ' What is that ? ' he asked . ' Give it . ' "
144771	144781	144782	144782	he	43	" I 'm rather obliged than angry , Nelly , "
144880	144881	144870	144870	others	3719	" "
144910	144919	144898	144898	they	2542	" I said shocked at his godless indifference . "
144926	144927	144928	144928	They	2542	" "
144934	144938	144940	144940	they	2542	" he replied , "
144969	145070	145071	145071	I	0	" As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den , and I breathed freer — But in the afternoon , while Joseph and Hareton were at their work , he came into the kitchen again , and with a wild look , bid me come , and sit in the house — he wanted somebody with him . I declined , telling him plainly , that his strange talk and manner , frightened me , and I had neither the nerve , nor the will to be his companion , alone . "
145079	145088	145073	145073	you	2546	" he said , with his dismal laugh , "
145099	145124	145073	145073	you	2546	" Then turning to Catherine , who was there , and who drew behind me at his approach , he added , half sneeringly . "
145131	145192	145193	145193	He	2549	" I 'll not hurt you . No ! to you , I 've made myself worse than the devil . Well , there is one who wo nt shrink from my company ! By God ! she 's relentless . Oh , damn it ! It 's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear , even mine . "
145387	145628	145629	145629	Th	2556	" Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key , I ran to unclose the panels , for the chamber was vacant — quickly pushing them aside , I peeped in . Mr. Heathcliff was there — laid on his back . His eyes met mine so keen , and fierce , I started ; and then , he seemed to smile . I could not think him dead — but his face , and throat were washed with rain ; the bed - clothes dripped , and he was perfectly still . The lattice , flapping to and fro , had grazed one hand that rested on the sill — no blood trickled from the broken skin , and when I put my fingers to it , I could doubt no more — he was dead and stark ! I hasped the window ; I combed his black long hair from his forehead ; I tried to close his eyes — to extinguish , if possible , that frightful , life - like gaze of exultation , before any one else beheld it . They would not shut — they seemed to sneer at my attempts , and his parted lips , and sharp , white teeth sneered too ! Taken with another fit of cowardice , I cried out for Joseph . Joseph shuffled up , and made a noise , but resolutely refused to meddle with him . "
145637	145641	145643	145643	he	2556	" he cried , "
145670	146133	145661	145663	a wicked un	2557	" and the old sinner grinned in mockery . I thought be intended to cut a caper round the bed ; but suddenly composing himself , he fell on his knees , and raised his hands , and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights . I felt stunned hy the awful event ; and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness . But poor Hareton the most wronged , was the only one that really suffered much . He sat by the corpse all night , weeping in bitter earnest . He pressed its hand , and kissed the sarcastic , savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating ; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart , though it be tough as tempered steel . Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died . I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days , fearing it might lead to trouble , and then , I am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose ; it was the consequence of his strange illness , not the cause . We buried him , to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood , as he had wished . Earnshaw , and I , the sexton and six men to carry the coffin , comprehended the whole attendance . The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave : we stayed to see it covered . Hareton , with a streaming face , dug green sods , and laid them over the brown mould himself , at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds — and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly . But the country folks , if you asked them , would swear on their bible that he walks . There are those who speak to having met him near the church , and on the moor , and even within this house — Idle tales , you 'll say , and so say I. Yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber window , on every rainy night , since his death — and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago . I was going to the Grange one evening — a dark evening threatening thunder — and , just at the turn of the Heights , I encountered a little boy with a sheep , and two lambs before him , he was crying terribly , and I supposed the lambs were skittish , and would not be guided . "
146148	146178	146145	146145	I	0	" ' They 's Heathcliff , and a woman , yonder , under t ' Nab , ' he blubbered , ' un ' Aw darnut pass 'em . ' "
146203	146281	146194	146194	I	0	" He probably raised the phantoms from thinking , as he traversed the moors alone , on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat — yet still , I do n't like being out in the dark , now — and I do n't like being left by myself in this grim house — I can not help it , I shall be glad when they leave it , and shift to the Grange ! "
146282	146291	146292	146292	I	0	" They are going to the Grange then ? "
146295	146298	146292	146292	I	0	" Yes , "
146303	146321	146300	146301	Mrs. Dean	71	" as soon as they are married ; and that will be on New Year 's day . "
146322	146330	146194	146194	I	0	" And who will live here then ? "
146331	146368	146194	146194	I	0	" Why , Joseph will take care of the house , and , perhaps , a lad to keep him company . They will live in the kitchen , and the rest will be shut up . "
146369	146382	146383	146383	I	0	" For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it , "
146386	146392	146394	146394	Nelly	80	" No , Mr. Lockwood , "
146400	146421	146397	146397	her	80	" I believe the dead are at peace , but it is not right to speak of them with levity . "
146436	146443	146444	146444	I	0	" They are afraid of nothing , "
146454	146465	146444	146444	I	0	" Together they would brave satan and all his legions . "
