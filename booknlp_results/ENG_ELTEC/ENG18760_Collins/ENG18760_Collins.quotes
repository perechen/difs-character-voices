101	173	86	91	my brother - in - law	150	“ at a very interesting period of his life . My last news of him tells me that he is just married . I know nothing of the lady , or of the circumstances under which my friend first met with her . But of this I am certain : married or single , George Germaine will give you and your wife a hearty welcome to England , for my sake . ”
316	332	334	335	the lady	2202	“ It is the first dinner we give , on our return from our wedding tour ”
339	356	334	335	the lady	2202	“ and you will only be introduced to a few of my husband ’s old friends . ”

901	907	889	890	Mr. Germaine	74	“ Where is your wife ? ”
927	956	957	957	Mr.	199	“ I am very sorry . Mrs. B has got a bad headache . She is subject to bad headaches . She begs me to make her excuses . ”
1049	1059	1060	1060	she	75	“ Shall we have dinner at once , George ? ”
1066	1077	1060	1060	she	75	“ Or shall we wait for Mr. and Mrs. C ? ”
1078	1085	1086	1086	he	206	“ We will wait five minutes , ”
1199	1205	1206	1206	he	74	“ Is your wife ill ? ”
1277	1303	1257	1257	he	84	“ Mrs. C is so sorry . She has got such a bad cold . She does so regret not being able to accompany me . ”
1322	1331	1332	1332	he	74	“ Two bad colds and one bad headache , ”
1339	1367	1332	1332	he	74	“ I do n’t know how your wives agree , gentlemen , when they are well . But when they are ill , their unanimity is wonderful ! ”
1698	1700	1726	1726	I	0	“ martyrdom ”
2060	2066	2067	2067	she	75	“ Wait a few minutes , ”
2077	2089	2067	2067	she	75	“ I have something to say to you before you go . ”
2140	2149	2150	2150	he	201	“ Do as you please , my love , ”
2155	2163	2150	2150	he	201	“ I leave it entirely to you . ”
2202	2217	2218	2218	she	75	“ No words of mine can tell you how gratefully I feel your kindness , ”
2234	2303	2218	2218	she	75	“ Under very trying circumstances , you have treated me with the tenderness and the sympathy which you might have shown to an old friend . The one return I can make for all that I owe to you is to admit you to my fullest confidence , and to leave you to judge for yourselves whether I deserve the treatment which I have received to - night . ”
2365	2375	2376	2376	she	75	“ I have a few words more to say , ”
2383	2655	2376	2376	she	75	“ You are the only married woman who has come to our little dinner party . The marked absence of the other wives explains itself . It is not for me to say whether they are right or wrong in refusing to sit at our table . My dear husband — who knows my whole life as well as I know it myself — expressed the wish that we should invite these ladies . He wrongly supposed that his estimate of me would be the estimate accepted by his friends ; and neither he nor I anticipated that the misfortunes of my past life would be revealed by some person acquainted with them , whose treachery we have yet to discover . The least I can do , by way of acknowledging your kindness , is to place you in the same position toward me which the other ladies now occupy . The circumstances under which I have become the wife of Mr. Germaine are , in some respects , very remarkable . They are related , without suppression or reserve , in a little narrative which my husband wrote , at the time of our marriage , for the satisfaction of one of his absent relatives , whose good opinion he was unwilling to forfeit . The manuscript is in this portfolio . After what has happened , I ask you both to read it , as a personal favor to me . It is for you to decide , when you know all , whether I am a fit person for an honest woman to associate with or not . ”
2785	2791	2792	2792	I	0	“ Before I open this , ”
2803	2835	2836	2836	He	206	“ my mind is made up , sir , about one thing . If I was n’t married already , I tell you this — I should envy you your wife . ”
2845	2853	2854	2854	he	206	“ Read what I have written there , ”
2857	2876	2854	2854	he	206	“ and you will understand what those false friends of mine have made me suffer to - night . ”

4108	4113	4074	4074	herself	85	“ What is it ? ”
4114	4126	4074	4074	herself	85	“ It ’s a surprise . I wo n’t tell you . ”
4127	4135	4141	4141	her	351	“ Will you give me a kiss ? ”
4154	4164	4141	4141	her	351	“ As many kisses as you like , George . ”
4229	4238	4239	4239	he	352	“ Ah , Master George , Master George ! ”
4242	4266	4239	4239	he	352	“ When your father comes home , do you think he will approve of his son and heir kissing his bailiff ’s daughter ? ”
4267	4274	4275	4275	I	0	“ When my father comes home , ”
4282	4301	4275	4275	I	0	“ I shall tell him the truth . I shall say I am going to marry your daughter . ”
4316	4321	4324	4324	him	320	“ Well , well ! ”

4418	4479	4412	4413	the doctor	364	“ and he is getting a great deal too clever for a boy at his age . Remove him from school , ma’am , for six months ; let him run about in the open air at home ; and if you find him with a book in his hand , take it away directly . There is my prescription . ”

6538	6561	6524	6524	I	0	“ I wo n’t tell upon you , Dame . My mother sha n’t know that you hid me in your bedroom . ”
6589	6592	6593	6593	she	92	“ Boy ! ”
6607	6653	6654	6654	She	92	“ Do you dare suppose that I ever did anything that I was ashamed of ? Do you think I am ashamed of what I have done now ? Wait there . Your mother may mistake me too . I shall write to your mother . ”
6738	6741	6742	6742	she	92	“ There ! ”
6757	6782	6742	6742	she	92	“ His mind and my mind are written there . Go , boy . I pardon you . Give my letter to your mother . ”
6835	6893	6831	6832	Dame Dermody	88	“ MADAM — I have taken what you may be inclined to think a great liberty . I have assisted your son George in setting his uncle ’s authority at defiance . I have encouraged your son George in his resolution to be true , in time and in eternity , to my grandchild , Mary Dermody . “
6918	6985	6903	6903	I	0	“ I hold the belief that all love that is true is foreordained and consecrated in heaven . Spirits destined to be united in the better world are divinely commissioned to discover each other and to begin their union in this world . The only happy marriages are those in which the two destined spirits have succeeded in meeting one another in this sphere of life . “
7121	7156	7101	7101	I	0	“ This is my belief . I have proved it by my own life . Maid , wife , and widow , I have held to it , and I have found it good . “
7294	7322	7277	7277	him	522	“ You will now understand the view I take of the tie which unites the young spirits of our children at the bright outset of their lives . “
7543	7556	7575	7575	your	526	“ Now my mind is unburdened . Now I have said all . “
7594	8038	7591	7592	HELEN DERMODY	95	” So the letter ended . To me it is something more than a mere curiosity of epistolary composition . I see in it the prophecy — strangely fulfilled in later years — of events in Mary ’s life , and in mine , which future pages are now to tell . My mother decided on leaving the letter unanswered . Like many of her poorer neighbors , she was a little afraid of Dame Dermody ; and she was , besides , habitually averse to all discussions which turned on the mysteries of spiritual life . I was reproved , admonished , and forgiven ; and there was the end of it . For some happy weeks Mary and I returned , without hinderance or interruption , to our old intimate companionship The end was coming , however , when we least expected it . My mother was startled , one morning , by a letter from my father , which informed her that he had been unexpectedly obliged to sail for England at a moment ’s notice ; that he had arrived in London , and that he was detained there by business which would admit of no delay . We were to wait for him at home , in daily expectation of seeing him the moment he was free . This news filled my mother ’s mind with foreboding doubts of the stability of her husband ’s grand speculation in America . The sudden departure from the United States , and the mysterious delay in London , were ominous , to her eyes , of misfortune to come . I am now writing of those dark days in the past , when the railway and the electric telegraph were still visions in the minds of inventors . Rapid communication with my father ( even if he would have consented to take us into his confidence ) was impossible . We had no choice but to wait and hope . The weary days passed ; and still my father ’s brief letters described him as detained by his business . The morning came when Mary and I went out with Dermody , the bailiff , to see the last wild fowl of the season lured into the decoy ; and still the welcome home waited for the master , and waited in vain . The narrative may now follow my little sweetheart and myself , on our way to Dermody 's cottage As we approached the garden gate , I saw a servant from the house waiting there . He carried a message from my mother — a message for me . “
8091	8103	8064	8064	My	0	” Mary ’s attentive face saddened when she heard those words . “
8112	8116	8110	8110	George	74	” she whispered , “
8130	8136	8121	8121	I	0	” I remembered Mary ’s promised “
8139	8354	8121	8121	I	0	” the secret of which was only to be revealed to me when we got to the cottage . How could I disappoint her ? My poor little lady - love looked ready to cry at the bare prospect of it . I dismissed the servant with a message of the temporizing sort . My love to my mother — and I would be back at the house in half an hour . We entered the cottage . Dame Dermody was sitting in the light of the window , as usual , with one of the mystic books of Emanuel Swedenborg open on her lap . She solemnly lifted her hand on our appearance , signing to us to occupy our customary corner without speaking to her . It was an act of domestic high treason to interrupt the Sibyl at her books . We crept quietly into our places . Mary waited until she saw her grandmother ’s gray head bend down , and her grandmother ’s bushy eyebrows contract attentively , over her reading . Then , and then only , the discreet child rose on tiptoe , disappeared noiselessly in the direction of her bedchamber , and came back to me carrying something carefully wrapped up in her best cambric handkerchief . “
8360	8368	8121	8121	I	0	” I whispered . Mary whispered back : “
8374	8375	8121	8121	I	0	” “
8380	8381	8121	8121	I	0	” “
8392	8413	8427	8427	I	0	” I guessed three times , and each guess was wrong . Mary decided on helping me by a hint . “
8418	8422	8415	8415	your	556	” she suggested ; “
8431	8435	8427	8427	I	0	” I began : “
8448	8454	8427	8427	I	0	” There she stopped me . “
8463	8467	8427	8427	I	0	” she said ; “
8473	8477	8478	8478	Fern	96	” I guessed , “
8480	8481	8482	8482	Feather	97	” “
8484	8485	8486	8486	Fife	98	” “
8488	8504	8486	8486	Fife	98	” And here my resources failed me . Mary sighed , and shook her head . “
8511	8515	8505	8505	You	556	” she said . “
8555	8556	8557	8557	I	0	” “
8562	8563	8564	8564	You	556	” “
8567	8568	8564	8564	You	556	” “
8574	8591	8564	8564	You	556	” Mary refused to let me give it up . She helped me by another hint . “
8605	8609	8594	8594	you	556	” she asked . “
8615	8626	8594	8594	you	556	” I inquired , at a loss for an answer . “
8662	8738	8656	8656	George	74	” Too true , of me and of my brethren , old and young alike ! It is always his love that forgets , and her love that remembers . We were only two children , and we were types of the man and the woman already . Mary lost patience with me . Forgetting the terrible presence of her grandmother , she jumped up , and snatched the concealed object out of her handkerchief . “
8741	8747	8656	8656	George	74	” she cried , briskly , “
8756	8937	8938	8938	Mary	85	” I remembered at last . The thing I had wished for in my boat , all those months ago , was a new flag . And here was the flag , made for me in secret by Mary ’s own hand ! The ground was green silk , with a dove embroidered on it in white , carrying in its beak the typical olive - branch , wrought in gold thread . The work was the tremulous , uncertain work of a child ’s fingers . But how faithfully my little darling had remembered my wish ! how patiently she had plied the needle over the traced lines of the pattern ! how industriously she had labored through the dreary winter days ! and all for my sake ! What words could tell my pride , my gratitude , my happiness ? I too forgot the presence of the Sibyl bending over her book . I took the little workwoman in my arms , and kissed her till I was fairly out of breath and could kiss no longer . “
8940	8953	8938	8938	Mary	85	” I burst out , in the first heat of my enthusiasm , “
8981	8982	8973	8973	I	0	” “
8985	8998	8983	8983	Boy	2251	” said the awful voice at the other end of the room . “
9002	9062	8983	8983	Boy	2251	” Dame Dermody ’s mystic book was closed ; Dame Dermody ’s weird black eyes were watching us in our corner . I approached her ; and Mary followed me timidly , by a footstep at a time . The Sibyl took me by the hand , with a caressing gentleness which was new in my experience of her . “
9069	9078	9064	9064	you	0	” she inquired , looking at the flag . “
9082	9091	9064	9064	you	0	” she cried , before I could answer . “
9103	9104	9064	9064	you	0	” “
9111	9115	9116	9116	I	0	” I asked . “
9128	9129	9116	9116	I	0	” “
9142	9165	9130	9130	You	0	” With that answer she took the flag from me and thrust it impatiently into the breast - pocket of my jacket . “
9173	9184	9171	9171	grandmother	563	” said Mary , piteously . I repeated my question : “
9198	9215	9237	9238	the prophet	565	” Dame Dermody laid her hand on the closed volume of Swedenborg lying in her lap . “
9227	9231	9218	9218	I	0	” she said . “
9262	9282	9258	9258	I	0	” she went on , pointing to the place where a ray of sunlight poured slanting into the room , “
9333	9363	9303	9303	his	2225	” She paused . Her voice faltered . She looked at us with softening eyes , as those look who know sadly that there is a parting at hand . “
9366	9378	9303	9303	his	2225	” she said , in low tones of awe and grief . “
9406	9453	9466	9466	God	570	” We knelt close together at her feet . I could feel Mary ’s heart throbbing , as she pressed nearer and nearer to my side . I could feel my own heart quickening its beat , with a fear that was a mystery to me . “
9490	9535	9583	9583	Dermody	88	” As the last words fell from her lips the cottage door was thrust open . My father — followed by the bailiff — entered the room . Dame Dermody got slowly on her feet , and looked at him with a stern scrutiny . “
9540	9546	9547	9547	It	571	” she said to herself . “
9564	9579	9580	9580	You	573	” My father broke the silence that followed , addressing himself to the bailiff . “
9585	9589	9583	9583	Dermody	88	” he said , “
9607	9633	9634	9634	George	74	” He turned , and looked at me as I stood with my arm round little Mary , patiently waiting for my opportunity to speak . “
9636	9661	9634	9634	George	74	” he said , with the hard smile which was peculiar to him , when he was angry and was trying to hide it , “
9680	9721	9722	9722	Papa	99	” Now , or never , was my time to declare myself . Judging by appearances , I was still a boy . Judging by my own sensations , I had developed into a man at a moment ’s notice . “
9724	9728	9722	9722	Papa	99	” I said , “
9775	9818	9819	9819	I	0	” My father burst out laughing . Before I could speak again , his humor changed . He had observed that Dermody , too , presumed to be amused . He seemed to become mad with anger , all in a moment . “
9828	9832	9819	9819	I	0	” he said , “
9884	9898	9903	9903	I	0	” He turned to me again , before the bailiff could defend himself . “
9921	9922	9906	9906	I	0	” “
9927	9931	9925	9925	papa	584	” I answered . “
9951	9966	9971	9971	your	99	” Angry as he was , my father was positively staggered by my audacity . “
9976	9981	9982	9982	I	0	” he burst out . “
10039	10040	10025	10025	I’ll	0	” “
10048	10062	10041	10041	I	0	” Dermody interposed , very respectfully and very firmly at the same time . “
10114	10121	10122	10122	You	99	” My father checked him there . “
10130	10134	10135	10135	We	596	” he said . “
10197	10229	10230	10230	I	0	” The bailiff steadily met my father on his ground . He was no longer the easy , sweet - tempered , modest man who was the man of my remembrance . “
10242	10246	10240	10240	sir	2230	” he answered . “
10282	10283	10273	10273	I	0	” “
10289	10294	10284	10284	We	603	” retorted my father . “
10303	10317	10320	10320	me	0	” He stepped across the room and put his hand on my shoulder . “
10322	10334	10320	10320	me	0	” he said , making a last effort to control himself . “
10375	10410	10413	10413	papa	584	” His heavy hand , pressing on my shoulder , seemed to press the spirit of resistance out of me . I so far gave way as to try to melt him by entreaties . “
10417	10421	10415	10415	papa	584	” I cried . “
10463	10490	10456	10456	I	0	” I could say no more . My poor little Mary burst out crying . Her tears and my entreaties were alike wasted on my father . “
10495	10499	10492	10492	your	610	” he said , “
10528	10529	10518	10518	I	0	” “
10539	10548	10531	10531	you	610	” interposed a voice , speaking behind us . “
10564	10664	10665	10665	I	0	” My father looked round quickly , and discovered Dame Dermody facing him in the full light of the window . She had stepped back , at the outset of the dispute , into the corner behind the fireplace . There she had remained , biding her time to speak , until my father ’s last threat brought her out of her place of retirement . They looked at each other for a moment . My father seemed to think it beneath his dignity to answer her . He went on with what he had to say to me . “
10671	10675	10665	10665	I	0	” he resumed . “
10707	10708	10691	10691	I	0	” “
10715	10720	10691	10691	I	0	” said Dame Dermody , “
10735	10736	10726	10726	his	616	” “
10747	10769	10770	10770	You	615	” asked my father , stung into speaking to her this time . The answer followed instantly in these startling words : “
10783	10798	10770	10770	You	615	” My father turned his back on the prophetess with a smile of contempt . “
10801	10840	10770	10770	You	615	” he said , beginning to count . I set my teeth , and clasped both arms round Mary as he spoke . I had inherited some of his temper , and he was now to know it . “
10843	10865	10770	10770	You	615	” proceeded my father , after waiting a little . Mary put her trembling lips to my ear , and whispered : “
10894	10909	10889	10889	he	74	” My father lifted his forefinger as a preliminary warning before he counted Three . “
10912	10928	10889	10889	he	74	” cried Dame Dermody . My father looked round at her again with sardonic astonishment . “
10945	10949	10950	10950	Man	178	” he asked . “
10952	10957	10958	10958	you	178	” returned the Sibyl , “
11186	11260	11265	11265	George	74	” In spite of himself , my father was struck by the irresistible strength of conviction which inspired those words . The bailiff ’s mother had impressed him as a tragic actress might have impressed him on the stage . She had checked the mocking answer on his lips , but she had not shaken his iron will . His face was as hard as ever when he turned my way once more . “
11267	11277	11265	11265	George	74	” he said , and counted the last number : “
11280	11288	11289	11289	You	74	” I neither moved nor answered him . “
11294	11319	11289	11289	You	74	” he said , as he fastened his hold on my arm . I fastened my hold on Mary ; I whispered to her , “
11326	11376	11289	11289	You	74	” She seemed not to hear me . She trembled from head to foot in my arms . A faint cry of terror fluttered from her lips . Dermody instantly stepped forward . Before my father could wrench me away from her , he had said in my ear , “
11387	11416	11384	11385	Master George	74	” and had released his child from my embrace . She stretched her little frail hands out yearningly to me , as she lay in Dermody ’s arms . “
11423	11478	11421	11421	dear	638	” she said , faintly . I saw her head sink on her father ’s bosom as I was dragged to the door . In my helpless rage and misery , I struggled against the cruel hands that had got me with all the strength I had left . I cried out to her , “
11503	11569	11501	11501	you	639	” Step by step , I was forced further and further away . The last I saw of her , my darling ’s head was still resting on Dermody ’s breast . Her grandmother stood near , and shook her withered hands at my father , and shrieked her terrible prophecy , in the hysteric frenzy that possessed her when she saw the separation accomplished . “
11582	11844	11579	11579	your	639	” While her voice still rang in my ears , the cottage door was opened and closed again . It was all over . The modest world of my boyish love and my boyish joy disappeared like the vision of a dream . The empty outer wilderness , which was my father ’s world , opened before me void of love and void of joy . God forgive me — how I hated him at that moment ! FOR the rest of the day , and through the night , I was kept a close prisoner in my room , watched by a man on whose fidelity my father could depend . The next morning I made an effort to escape , and was discovered before I had got free of the house . Confined again to my room , I contrived to write to Mary , and to slip my note into the willing hand of the housemaid who attended on me . Useless ! The vigilance of my guardian was not to be evaded . The woman was suspected and followed , and the letter was taken from her . My father tore it up with his own hands . Later in the day , my mother was permitted to see me . She was quite unfit , poor soul , to intercede for me , or to serve my interests in any way . My father had completely overwhelmed her by announcing that his wife and his son were to accompany him , when he returned to America . “
11853	11858	11847	11847	he	641	” said my mother , “
11930	12195	12196	12196	We	649	” An hour afterward the post - chaise was at the door . My father himself took me to the carriage . I broke away from him , with a desperation which not even his resolution could resist . I ran , I flew , along the path that led to Dermody ’s cottage . The door stood open ; the parlor was empty . I went into the kitchen ; I went into the upper rooms . Solitude everywhere . The bailiff had left the place ; and his mother and his daughter had gone with him . No friend or neighbor lingered near with a message ; no letter lay waiting for me ; no hint was left to tell me in what direction they had taken their departure . After the insulting words which his master had spoken to him , Dermody ’s pride was concerned in leaving no trace of his whereabouts ; my father might consider it as a trace purposely left with the object of reuniting Mary and me . I had no keepsake to speak to me of my lost darling but the flag which she had embroidered with her own hand . The furniture still remained in the cottage . I sat down in our customary corner , by Mary ’s empty chair , and looked again at the pretty green flag , and burst out crying . A light touch roused me . My father had so far yielded as to leave to my mother the responsibility of bringing me back to the traveling carriage . “
12205	12211	12203	12203	George	74	” she said , gently . “
12225	12286	12223	12223	me	0	” I rose and silently gave her my hand . Something low down on the clean white door - post caught my eye as we passed it . I stooped , and discovered some writing in pencil . I looked closer — it was writing in Mary ’s hand ! The unformed childish characters traced these last words of farewell : “
12298	13298	13299	13299	Trim	86	” I knelt down and kissed the writing . It comforted me — it was like a farewell touch from Mary ’s hand . I followed my mother quietly to the carriage . Late that night we were in London . My good mother did all that the most compassionate kindness could do ( in her position ) to comfort me . She privately wrote to the solicitors employed by her family , inclosing a description of Dermody and his mother and daughter and directing inquiries to be made at the various coach - offices in London . She also referred the lawyers to two of Dermody ’s relatives , who lived in the city , and who might know something of his movements after he left my father ’s service . When she had done this , she had done all that lay in her power . We neither of us possessed money enough to advertise in the newspapers . A week afterward we sailed for the United States . Twice in that interval I communicated with the lawyers ; and twice I was informed that the inquiries had led to nothing . With this the first epoch in my love story comes to an end . For ten long years afterward I never again met with my little Mary ; I never even heard whether she had lived to grow to womanhood or not . I still kept the green flag , with the dove worked on it . For the rest , the waters of oblivion had closed over the old golden days at Greenwater Broad . WHEN YOU last saw me , I was a boy of thirteen . You now see me a man of twenty - three . The story of my life , in the interval between these two ages , is a story that can be soon told . Speaking of my father first , I have to record that the end of his career did indeed come as Dame Dermody had foretold it . Before we had been a year in America , the total collapse of his land speculation was followed by his death . The catastrophe was complete . But for my mother ’s little income ( settled on her at her marriage ) we should both have been left helpless at the mercy of the world . We made some kind friends among the hearty and hospitable people of the United States , whom we were unaffectedly sorry to leave . But there were reasons which inclined us to return to our own country after my father ’s death ; and we did return accordingly . Besides her brother - in - law ( already mentioned in the earlier pages of my narrative ) , my mother had another relative — a cousin named Germaine — on whose assistance she mainly relied for starting me , when the time came , in a professional career . I remember it as a family rumor , that Mr. Germaine had been an unsuccessful suitor for my mother ’s hand in the days when they were young people together . He was still a bachelor at the later period when his eldest brother ’s death without issue placed him in possession of a handsome fortune . The accession of wealth made no difference in his habits of life : he was a lonely old man , estranged from his other relatives , when my mother and I returned to England . If I could only succeed in pleasing Mr. Germaine , I might consider my prospects ( in some degree , at least ) as being prospects assured . This was one consideration that influenced us in leaving America . There was another — in which I was especially interested — that drew me back to the lonely shores of Greenwater Broad . My only hope of recovering a trace of Mary was to make inquiries among the cottagers in the neighborhood of my old home . The good bailiff had been heartily liked and respected in his little sphere . It seemed at least possible that some among his many friends in Suffolk might have discovered traces of him , in the year that had passed since I had left England . In my dreams of Mary — and I dreamed of her constantly — the lake and its woody banks formed a frequent background in the visionary picture of my lost companion . To the lake shores I looked , with a natural superstition , as to my way back to the one life that had its promise of happiness for me — my life with Mary . On our arrival in London , I started for Suffolk alone — at my mother ’s request . At her age she naturally shrank from revisiting the home scenes now occupied by the strangers to whom our house had been let . Ah , how my heart ached ( young as I was ) when I saw the familiar green waters of the lake once more ! It was evening . The first object that caught my eye was the gayly painted boat , once mine , in which Mary and I had so often sailed together . The people in possession of our house were sailing now . The sound of their laughter floated toward me merrily over the still water . Their flag flew at the little mast - head , from which Mary ’s flag had never fluttered in the pleasant breeze . I turned my eyes from the boat ; it hurt me to look at it . A few steps onward brought me to a promontory on the shore , and revealed the brown archways of the decoy on the opposite bank . There was the paling behind which we had knelt to watch the snaring of the ducks ; there was the hole through which “
13301	13664	13299	13299	Trim	86	” the terrier , had shown himself to rouse the stupid curiosity of the water - fowl ; there , seen at intervals through the trees , was the winding woodland path along which Mary and I had traced our way to Dermody ’s cottage on the day when my father ’s cruel hand had torn us from each other . How wisely my good mother had shrunk from looking again at the dear old scenes ! I turned my back on the lake , to think with calmer thoughts in the shadowy solitude of the woods . An hour ’s walk along the winding banks brought me round to the cottage which had once been Mary ’s home . The door was opened by a woman who was a stranger to me . She civilly asked me to enter the parlor . I had suffered enough already ; I made my inquiries , standing on the doorstep . They were soon at an end . The woman was a stranger in our part of Suffolk ; neither she nor her husband had ever heard of Dermody ’s name . I pursued my investigations among the peasantry , passing from cottage to cottage . The twilight came ; the moon rose ; the lights began to vanish from the lattice - windows ; and still I continued my weary pilgrimage ; and still , go where I might , the answer to my questions was the same . Nobody knew anything of Dermody . Everybody asked if I had not brought news of him myself . It pains me even now to recall the cruelly complete defeat of every effort which I made on that disastrous evening . I passed the night in one of the cottages ; and I returned to London the next day , broken by disappointment , careless what I did , or where I went next . Still , we were not wholly parted . I saw Mary — as Dame Dermody said I should see her — in dreams . Sometimes she came to me with the green flag in her hand , and repeated her farewell words—“Don’t
13668	13734	13735	13735	We	651	” Sometimes she led me to our well - remembered corner in the cottage parlor , and opened the paper on which her grandmother had written our prayers for us . We prayed together again , and sung hymns together again , as if the old times had come back . Once she appeared to me , with tears in her eyes , and said , “
13748	13771	13735	13735	We	651	” Twice I saw her looking at me , like one disturbed by anxious thoughts ; and twice I heard her say , “
13784	13842	13778	13778	George	74	” We settled in London , where my education was undertaken by a private tutor . Before we had been long in our new abode , an unexpected change in our prospects took place . To my mother ’s astonishment she received an offer of marriage ( addressed to her in a letter ) from Mr. Germaine . “
13854	13862	13843	13843	I	0	” ( the old gentleman wrote ) . “
13966	14348	14349	14349	I	0	” My mother ( looking almost as confused , poor soul ! as if she had become a young girl again ) left the whole responsibility of decision on the shoulders of her son ! I was not long in making up my mind . If she said Yes , she would accept the hand of a man of worth and honor , who had been throughout his whole life devoted to her ; and she would recover the comfort , the luxury , the social prosperity and position of which my father ’s reckless course of life had deprived her . Add to this , that I liked Mr. Germaine , and that Mr. Germaine liked me . Under these circumstances , why should my mother say No ? She could produce no satisfactory answer to that question when I put it . As the necessary consequence , she became , in due course of time , Mrs. Germaine . I have only to add that , to the end of her life , my good mother congratulated herself ( in this case at least ) on having taken her son ’s advice . The years went on , and still Mary and I were parted , except in my dreams . The years went on , until the perilous time which comes in every man ’s life came in mine . I reached the age when the strongest of all the passions seizes on the senses , and asserts its mastery over mind and body alike . I had hitherto passively endured the wreck of my earliest and dearest hopes : I had lived patiently , and lived innocently , for Mary ’s sake . Now my patience left me ; my innocence was numbered among the lost things of the past . My days , it is true , were still devoted to the tasks set me by my tutor ; but my nights were given , in secret , to a reckless profligacy , which ( in my present frame of mind ) I look back on with disgust and dismay . I profaned my remembrances of Mary in the company of women who had reached the lowest depths of degradation . I impiously said to myself : “
14381	16254	14379	14379	her	659	” From the moment when I dropped into this degradation , I might sometimes think regretfully of Mary — at the morning time , when penitent thoughts mostly come to us ; but I ceased absolutely to see her in my dreams . We were now , in the completest sense of the word , parted . Mary ’s pure spirit could hold no communion with mine ; Mary ’s pure spirit had left me . It is needless to say that I failed to keep the secret of my depravity from the knowledge of my mother . The sight of her grief was the first influence that sobered me . In some degree at least I restrained myself : I made the effort to return to purer ways of life . Mr. Germaine , though I had disappointed him , was too just a man to give me up as lost . He advised me , as a means of self - reform , to make my choice of a profession , and to absorb myself in closer studies than any that I had yet pursued . I made my peace with this good friend and second father , not only by following his advice , but by adopting the profession to which he had been himself attached before he inherited his fortune — the profession of medicine . Mr. Germaine had been a surgeon : I resolved on being a surgeon too . Having entered , at rather an earlier age than usual , on my new way of life , I may at least say for myself that I worked hard . I won , and kept , the interest of the professors under whom I studied . On the other hand , it can not be denied that my reformation was , morally speaking , far from being complete . I worked ; but what I did was done selfishly , bitterly , with a hard heart . In religion and morals I adopted the views of a materialist companion of my studies — a worn - out man of more than double my age . I believed in nothing but what I could see , or taste , or feel . I lost all faith in humanity . With the one exception of my mother , I had no respect for women . My remembrances of Mary deteriorated until they became little more than a lost link of association with the past . I still preserved the green flag as a matter of habit ; but it was no longer kept about me ; it was left undisturbed in a drawer of my writing - desk . Now and then a wholesome doubt , whether my life was not utterly unworthy of me , would rise in my mind . But it held no long possession of my thoughts . Despising others , it was in the logical order of things that I should follow my conclusions to their bitter end , and consistently despise myself . The term of my majority arrived . I was twenty - one years old ; and of the illusions of my youth not a vestige remained . Neither my mother nor Mr. Germaine could make any positive complaint of my conduct . But they were both thoroughly uneasy about me . After anxious consideration , my step - father arrived at a conclusion . He decided that the one chance of restoring me to my better and brighter self was to try the stimulant of a life among new people and new scenes . At the period of which I am now writing , the home government had decided on sending a special diplomatic mission to one of the native princes ruling over a remote province of our Indian empire . In the disturbed state of the province at that time , the mission , on its arrival in India , was to be accompanied to the prince ’s court by an escort , including the military as well as the civil servants of the crown . The surgeon appointed to sail with the expedition from England was an old friend of Mr. Germaine ’s , and was in want of an assistant on whose capacity he could rely . Through my stepfather ’s interest , the post was offered to me . I accepted it without hesitation . My only pride left was the miserable pride of indifference . So long as I pursued my profession , the place in which I pursued it was a matter of no importance to my mind . It was long before we could persuade my mother even to contemplate the new prospect now set before me . When she did at length give way , she yielded most unwillingly . I confess I left her with the tears in my eyes — the first I had shed for many a long year past . The history of our expedition is part of the history of British India . It has no place in this narrative . Speaking personally , I have to record that I was rendered incapable of performing my professional duties in less than a week from the time when the mission reached its destination . We were encamped outside the city ; and an attack was made on us , under cover of darkness , by the fanatical natives . The attempt was defeated with little difficulty , and with only a trifling loss on our side . I was among the wounded , having been struck by a javelin , or spear , while I was passing from one tent to another . Inflicted by a European weapon , my injury would have been of no serious consequence . But the tip of the Indian spear had been poisoned . I escaped the mortal danger of lockjaw ; but , through some peculiarity in the action of the poison on my constitution ( which I am quite unable to explain ) , the wound obstinately refused to heal . I was invalided and sent to Calcutta , where the best surgical help was at my disposal . To all appearance , the wound healed there — then broke out again . Twice this happened ; and the medical men agreed that the best course to take would be to send me home . They calculated on the invigorating effect of the sea voyage , and , failing this , on the salutary influence of my native air . In the Indian climate I was pronounced incurable . Two days before the ship sailed a letter from my mother brought me startling news . My life to come — if I had a life to come — had been turned into a new channel . Mr. Germaine had died suddenly , of heart - disease . His will , bearing date at the time when I left England , bequeathed an income for life to my mother , and left the bulk of his property to me , on the one condition that I adopted his name . I accepted the condition , of course , and became George Germaine . Three months later , my mother and I were restored to each other . Except that I still had some trouble with my wound , behold me now to all appearance one of the most enviable of existing mortals ; promoted to the position of a wealthy gentleman ; possessor of a house in London and of a country - seat in Perthshire ; and , nevertheless , at twenty - three years of age , one of the most miserable men living ! And Mary ? In the ten years that had now passed over , what had become of Mary ? You have heard my story . Read the few pages that follow , and you will hear hers . WHAT I have now to tell you of Mary is derived from information obtained at a date in my life later by many years than any date of which I have written yet . Be pleased to remember this . Dermody , the bailiff , possessed relatives in London , of whom he occasionally spoke , and relatives in Scotland , whom he never mentioned . My father had a strong prejudice against the Scotch nation . Dermody knew his master well enough to be aware that the prejudice might extend to him , if he spoke of his Scotch kindred . He was a discreet man , and he never mentioned them . On leaving my father ’s service , he had made his way , partly by land and partly by sea , to Glasgow — in which city his friends resided . With his character and his experience , Dermody was a man in a thousand to any master who was lucky enough to discover him . His friends bestirred themselves . In six weeks ’ time he was placed in charge of a gentleman ’s estate on the eastern coast of Scotland , and was comfortably established with his mother and his daughter in a new home . The insulting language which my father had addressed to him had sunk deep in Dermody ’s mind . He wrote privately to his relatives in London , telling them that he had found a new situation which suited him , and that he had his reasons for not at present mentioning his address . In this way he baffled the inquiries which my mother ’s lawyers ( failing to discover a trace of him in other directions ) addressed to his London friends . Stung by his old master ’s reproaches , he sacrificed his daughter and he sacrificed me — partly to his own sense of self - respect , partly to his conviction that the difference between us in rank made it his duty to check all further intercourse before it was too late . Buried in their retirement in a remote part of Scotland , the little household lived , lost to me , and lost to the world . In dreams , I had seen and heard Mary . In dreams , Mary saw and heard me . The innocent longings and wishes which filled my heart while I was still a boy were revealed to her in the mystery of sleep . Her grandmother , holding firmly to her faith in the predestined union between us , sustained the girl ’s courage and cheered her heart . She could hear her father say ( as my father had said ) that we were parted to meet no more , and could privately think of her happy dreams as the sufficient promise of another future than the future which Dermody contemplated . So she still lived with me in the spirit — and lived in hope . The first affliction that befell the little household was the death of the grandmother , by the exhaustion of extreme old age . In her last conscious moments , she said to Mary , “
16288	17731	14379	14379	her	659	” While those words were still vividly present to Mary ’s mind , our visionary union by dreams was abruptly broken on her side , as it had been abruptly broken on mine . In the first days of my self - degradation , I had ceased to see Mary . Exactly at the same period Mary ceased to see me . The girl ’s sensitive nature sunk under the shock . She had now no elder woman to comfort and advise her ; she lived alone with her father , who invariably changed the subject whenever she spoke of the old times . The secret sorrow that preys on body and mind alike preyed on her . A cold , caught at the inclement season , turned to fever . For weeks she was in danger of death . When she recovered , her head had been stripped of its beautiful hair by the doctor ’s order . The sacrifice had been necessary to save her life . It proved to be , in one respect , a cruel sacrifice — her hair never grew plentifully again . When it did reappear , it had completely lost its charming mingled hues of deep red and brown ; it was now of one monotonous light - brown color throughout . At first sight , Mary ’s Scotch friends hardly knew her again . But Nature made amends for what the head had lost by what the face and the figure gained . In a year from the date of her illness , the frail little child of the old days at Greenwater Broad had ripened , in the bracing Scotch air and the healthy mode of life , into a comely young woman . Her features were still , as in her early years , not regularly beautiful ; but the change in her was not the less marked on that account . The wan face had filled out , and the pale complexion had found its color . As to her figure , its remarkable development was perceived even by the rough people about her . Promising nothing when she was a child , it had now sprung into womanly fullness , symmetry , and grace . It was a strikingly beautiful figure , in the strictest sense of the word . Morally as well as physically , there were moments , at this period of their lives , when even her own father hardly recognized his daughter of former days . She had lost her childish vivacity — her sweet , equable flow of good humor . Silent and self - absorbed , she went through the daily routine of her duties enduringly . The hope of meeting me again had sunk to a dead hope in her by this time . She made no complaint . The bodily strength that she had gained in these later days had its sympathetic influence in steadying her mind . When her father once or twice ventured to ask if she was still thinking of me , she answered quietly that she had brought herself to share his opinions . She could not doubt that I had long since ceased to think of her . Even if I had remained faithful to her , she was old enough now to know that the difference between us in rank made our union by marriage an impossibility . It would be best ( she thought ) not to refer any more to the past , best to forget me , as I had forgotten her . So she spoke now . So , tried by the test of appearances , Dame Dermody ’s confident forecast of our destinies had failed to justify itself , and had taken its place among the predictions that are never fulfilled . The next notable event in the family annals which followed Mary ’s illness happened when she had attained the age of nineteen years . Even at this distance of time my heart sinks , my courage fails me , at the critical stage in my narrative which I have now reached . A storm of unusual severity burst over the eastern coast of Scotland . Among the ships that were lost in the tempest was a vessel bound from Holland , which was wrecked on the rocky shore near Dermody ’s place of abode . Leading the way in all good actions , the bailiff led the way in rescuing the passengers and crew of the lost ship . He had brought one man alive to land , and was on his way back to the vessel , when two heavy seas , following in close succession , dashed him against the rocks . He was rescued , at the risk of their own lives , by his neighbors . The medical examination disclosed a broken bone and severe bruises and lacerations . So far , Dermody ’s sufferings were easy of relief . But , after a lapse of time , symptoms appeared in the patient which revealed to his medical attendant the presence of serious internal injury . In the doctor ’s opinion , he could never hope to resume the active habits of his life . He would be an invalid and a crippled man for the rest of his days . Under these melancholy circumstances , the bailiff ’s employer did all that could be strictly expected of him , He hired an assistant to undertake the supervision of the farm work , and he permitted Dermody to occupy his cottage for the next three months . This concession gave the poor man time to recover such relics of strength as were still left to him , and to consult his friends in Glasgow on the doubtful question of his life to come . The prospect was a serious one . Dermody was quite unfit for any sedentary employment ; and the little money that he had saved was not enough to support his daughter and himself . The Scotch friends were willing and kind ; but they had domestic claims on them , and they had no money to spare . In this emergency , the passenger in the wrecked vessel ( whose life Dermody had saved ) came forward with a proposal which took father and daughter alike by surprise . He made Mary an offer of marriage ; on the express understanding ( if she accepted him ) that her home was to be her father ’s home also to the end of his life . The person who thus associated himself with the Dermodys in the time of their trouble was a Dutch gentleman , named Ernest Van Brandt . He possessed a share in a fishing establishment on the shores of the Zuyder Zee ; and he was on his way to establish a correspondence with the fisheries in the North of Scotland when the vessel was wrecked . Mary had produced a strong impression on him when they first met . He had lingered in the neighborhood , in the hope of gaining her favorable regard , with time to help him . Personally he was a handsome man , in the prime of life ; and he was possessed of a sufficient income to marry on . In making his proposal , he produced references to persons of high social position in Holland , who could answer for him , so far as the questions of character and position were concerned . Mary was long in considering which course it would be best for her helpless father , and best for herself , to adopt . The hope of a marriage with me had been a hope abandoned by her years since . No woman looks forward willingly to a life of cheerless celibacy . In thinking of her future , Mary naturally thought of herself in the character of a wife . Could she fairly expect in the time to come to receive any more attractive proposal than the proposal now addressed to her ? Mr. Van Brandt had every personal advantage that a woman could desire ; he was devotedly in love with her ; and he felt a grateful affection for her father as the man to whom he owed his life . With no other hope in her heart — with no other prospect in view — what could she do better than marry Mr. Van Brandt ? Influenced by these considerations , she decided on speaking the fatal word . She said , “
17734	18048	14379	14379	her	659	” At the same time , she spoke plainly to Mr. Van Brandt , unreservedly acknowledging that she had contemplated another future than the future now set before her . She did not conceal that there had once been an old love in her heart , and that a new love was more than she could command . Esteem , gratitude , and regard she could honestly offer ; and , with time , love might come . For the rest , she had long since disassociated herself from the past , and had definitely given up all the hopes and wishes once connected with it . Repose for her father , and tranquil happiness for herself , were the only favors that she asked of fortune now . These she might find under the roof of an honorable man who loved and respected her . She could promise , on her side , to make him a good and faithful wife , if she could promise no more . It rested with Mr. Van Brandt to say whether he really believed that he would be consulting his own happiness in marrying her on these terms . Mr. Van Brandt accepted the terms without a moment ’s hesitation . They would have been married immediately but for an alarming change for the worse in the condition of Dermody ’s health . Symptoms showed themselves , which the doctor confessed that he had not anticipated when he had given his opinion on the case . He warned Mary that the end might be near . A physician was summoned from Edinburgh , at Mr. Van Brandt ’s expense . He confirmed the opinion entertained by the country doctor . For some days longer the good bailiff lingered . On the last morning , he put his daughter ’s hand in Van Brandt ’s hand . “
18055	18064	14379	14379	her	659	” he said , in his simple way , “
18077	18356	18066	18066	you	2230	” The same day he died quietly in his daughter ’s arms . Mary ’s future was now entirely in her lover ’s hands . The relatives in Glasgow had daughters of their own to provide for . The relatives in London resented Dermody ’s neglect of them . Van Brandt waited , delicately and considerately , until the first violence of the girl ’s grief had worn itself out , and then he pleaded irresistibly for a husband ’s claim to console her . The time at which they were married in Scotland was also the time at which I was on my way home from India . Mary had then reached the age of twenty years . The story of our ten years ’ separation is now told ; the narrative leaves us at the outset of our new lives . I am with my mother , beginning my career as a country gentleman on the estate in Perthshire which I have inherited from Mr. Germaine . Mary is with her husband , enjoying her new privileges , learning her new duties , as a wife . She , too , is living in Scotland — living , by a strange fatality , not very far distant from my country - house . I have no suspicion that she is so near to me : the name of Mrs. Van Brandt ( even if I had heard it ) appeals to no familiar association in my mind . Still the kindred spirits are parted . Still there is no idea on her side , and no idea on mine , that we shall ever meet again . “
18368	18372	18357	18357	I	0	” she said . “
18387	18406	18382	18382	your	657	” I rose and followed her . She pointed to a miniature portrait , hanging above the mantelpiece . “
18415	18425	18426	18426	George	74	” she asked , half sadly , half playfully . “
18439	18698	18429	18429	you	657	” How should I recognize myself ? Worn by sickness and sorrow ; browned by the sun on my long homeward voyage ; my hair already growing thin over my forehead ; my eyes already habituated to their one sad and weary look ; what had I in common with the fair , plump , curly - headed , bright - eyed boy who confronted me in the miniature ? The mere sight of the portrait produced the most extraordinary effect on my mind . It struck me with an overwhelming melancholy ; it filled me with a despair of myself too dreadful to be endured . Making the best excuse I could to my mother , I left the room . In another minute I was out of the house . I crossed the park , and left my own possessions behind me . Following a by - road , I came to our well - known river ; so beautiful in itself , so famous among trout - fishers throughout Scotland . It was not then the fishing season . No human being was in sight as I took my seat on the bank . The old stone bridge which spanned the stream was within a hundred yards of me ; the setting sun still tinged the swift - flowing water under the arches with its red and dying light . Still the boy ’s face in the miniature pursued me . Still the portrait seemed to reproach me in a merciless language of its own : “
18713	18917	18429	18429	you	657	” I hid my face in the soft , fragrant grass . I thought of the wasted years of my life between thirteen and twenty - three . How was it to end ? If I lived to the ordinary life of man , what prospect had I before me ? Love ? Marriage ? I burst out laughing as the idea crossed my mind . Since the innocently happy days of my boyhood I had known no more of love than the insect that now crept over my hand as it lay on the grass . My money , to be sure , would buy me a wife ; but would my money make her dear to me ? dear as Mary had once been , in the golden time when my portrait was first painted ? Mary ! Was she still living ? Was she married ? Should I know her again if I saw her ? Absurd ! I had not seen her since she was ten years old : she was now a woman , as I was a man . Would she know me if we met ? The portrait , still pursuing me , answered the question : “
18932	19979	18429	18429	you	657	” I rose and walked backward and forward , and tried to turn the current of my thoughts in some new direction . It was not to be done . After a banishment of years , Mary had got back again into my mind . I sat down once more on the river bank . The sun was sinking fast . Black shadows hovered under the arches of the old stone bridge . The red light had faded from the swift - flowing water , and had left it overspread with one monotonous hue of steely gray . The first stars looked down peacefully from the cloudless sky . The first shiverings of the night breeze were audible among the trees , and visible here and there in the shallow places of the stream . And still , the darker it grew , the more persistently my portrait led me back to the past , the more vividly the long - lost image of the child Mary showed itself to me in my thoughts . Was this the prelude of her coming back to me in dreams ; in her perfected womanhood , in the young prime of her life ? It might be so . I was no longer unworthy of her , as I had once been . The effect produced on me by the sight of my portrait was in itself due to moral and mental changes in me for the better , which had been steadily proceeding since the time when my wound had laid me helpless among strangers in a strange land . Sickness , which has made itself teacher and friend to many a man , had made itself teacher and friend to me . I looked back with horror at the vices of my youth ; at the fruitless after - days when I had impiously doubted all that is most noble , all that is most consoling in human life . Consecrated by sorrow , purified by repentance , was it vain in me to hope that her spirit a nd my spirit might yet be united again ? Who could tell ? I rose once more . It could serve no good purpose to linger until night by the banks of the river . I had left the house , feeling the impulse which drives us , in certain excited conditions of the mind , to take refuge in movement and change . The remedy had failed ; my mind was as strangely disturbed as ever . My wisest course would be to go home , and keep my good mother company over her favorite game of piquet . I turned to take the road back , and stopped , struck by the tranquil beauty of the last faint light in the western sky , shining behind the black line formed by the parapet of the bridge . In the grand gathering of the night shadows , in the deep stillness of the dying day , I stood alone and watched the sinking light . As I looked , there came a change over the scene . Suddenly and softly a living figure glided into view on the bridge . It passed behind the black line of the parapet , in the last long rays of the western light . It crossed the bridge . It paused , and crossed back again half - way . Then it stopped . The minutes passed , and there the figure stood , a motionless black object , behind the black parapet of the bridge . I advanced a little , moving near enough to obtain a closer view of the dress in which the figure was attired . The dress showed me that the solitary stranger was a woman . She did not notice me in the shadow which the trees cast on the bank . She stood with her arms folded in her cloak , looking down at the darkening river . Why was she waiting there at the close of evening alone ? As the question occurred to me , I saw her head move . She looked along the bridge , first on one side of her , then on the other . Was she waiting for some person who was to meet her ? Or was she suspicious of observation , and anxious to make sure that she was alone ? A sudden doubt of her purpose in seeking that solitary place , a sudden distrust of the lonely bridge and the swift - flowing river , set my heart beating quickly and roused me to instant action . I hurried up the rising ground which led from the river - bank to the bridge , determined on speaking to her while the opportunity was still mine . She neither saw nor heard me until I was close to her . I approached with an irrepressible feeling of agitation ; not knowing how she might receive me when I spoke to her . The moment she turned and faced me , my composure came back . It was as if , expecting to see a stranger , I had unexpectedly encountered a friend . And yet she was a stranger . I had never before looked on that grave and noble face , on that grand figure whose exquisite grace and symmetry even her long cloak could not wholly hide . She was not , perhaps , a strictly beautiful woman . There were defects in her which were sufficiently marked to show themselves in the fading light . Her hair , for example , seen under the large garden hat that she wore , looked almost as short as the hair of a man ; and the color of it was of that dull , lusterless brown hue which is so commonly seen in English women of the ordinary type . Still , in spite of these drawbacks , there was a latent charm in her expression , there was an inbred fascination in her manner , which instantly found its way to my sympathies and its hold on my admiration . She won me in the moment when I first looked at her . “
19990	20025	19981	19981	I	0	” I asked . Her eyes rested on my face with a strange look of inquiry in them . She did not appear to be surprised or confused at my venturing to address her . “
20035	20040	20026	20026	I	0	” I went on . “
20050	20128	20130	20130	you	0	” She still looked at me with steady , inquiring eyes . For a moment , stranger as I was , my face seemed to trouble her as if it had been a face that she had seen and forgotten again . If she really had this idea , she at once dismissed it with a little toss of her head , and looked away at the river as if she felt no further interest in me . “
20150	20461	20462	20462	Christ	94	” She spoke coldly , but courteously . Her voice was delicious ; her bow , as she left me , was the perfection of unaffected grace . She left the bridge on the side by which I had first seen her approach it , and walked slowly away along the darkening track of the highroad . Still I was not quite satisfied . There was something underlying the charming expression and the fascinating manner which my instinct felt to be something wrong . As I walked away toward the opposite end of the bridge , the doubt began to grow on me whether she had spoken the truth . In leaving the neighborhood of the river , was she simply trying to get rid of me ? I at once resolved to put this suspicion of her to the test . Leaving the bridge , I had only to cross the road beyond , and to enter a plantation on the bank of the river . Here , concealed behind the first tree which was large enough to hide me , I could command a view of the bridge , and I could fairly count on detecting her , if she returned to the river , while there was a ray of light to see her by . It was not easy walking in the obscurity of the plantation : I had almost to grope my way to the nearest tree that suited my purpose . I had just steadied my foothold on the uneven ground behind the tree , when the stillness of the twilight hour was suddenly broken by the distant sound of a voice . The voice was a woman ’s . It was not raised to any high pitch ; its accent was the accent of prayer , and the words it uttered were these : “
20469	21046	20462	20462	Christ	94	” There was silence again . A nameless fear crept over me , as I looked out on the bridge . She was standing on the parapet . Before I could move , before I could cry out , before I could even breathe again freely , she leaped into the river . The current ran my way . I could see her , as she rose to the surface , floating by in the light on the mid - stream . I ran headlong down the bank . She sank again , in the moment when I stopped to throw aside my hat and coat and to kick off my shoes . I was a practiced swimmer . The instant I was in the water my composure came back to me — I felt like myself again . The current swept me out into the mid - stream , and greatly increased the speed at which I swam . I was close behind her when she rose for the second time — a shadowy thing , just visible a few inches below the surface of the river . One more stroke , and my left arm was round her ; I had her face out of the water . She was insensible . I could hold her in the right way to leave me master of all my movements ; I could devote myself , without flurry or fatigue , to the exertion of taking her back to the shore . My first attempt satisfied me that there was no reasonable hope , burdened as I now was , of breasting the strong current running toward the mid - river from either bank . I tried it on one side , and I tried it on the other , and gave it up . The one choice left was to let myself drift with her down the stream . Some fifty yards lower , the river took a turn round a promontory of land , on which stood a little inn much frequented by anglers in the season . As we approached the place , I made another attempt ( again an attempt in vain ) to reach the shore . Our last chance now was to be heard by the people of the inn . I shouted at the full pitch of my voice as we drifted past . The cry was answered . A man put off in a boat . In five minutes more I had her safe on the bank again ; and the man and I were carrying her to the inn by the river - side . The landlady and her servant - girl were equally willing to be of service , and equally ignorant of what they were to do . Fortunately , my medical education made me competent to direct them . A good fire , warm blankets , hot water in bottles , were all at my disposal . I showed the women myself how to ply the work of revival . They persevered , and I persevered ; and still there she lay , in her perfect beauty of form , without a sign of life perceptible ; there she lay , to all outward appearance , dead by drowning . A last hope was left — the hope of restoring her ( if I could construct the apparatus in time ) by the process called “
21050	21092	21093	21094	Good God	672	” I was just endeavoring to tell the landlady what I wanted and was just conscious o f a strange difficulty in expressing myself , when the good woman started back , and looked at me with a scream of terror . “
21102	21106	21093	21094	Good God	672	” she cried . “
21117	21423	21426	21426	doctor	674	” In the moment when she spoke to me I knew what had happened . The old Indian wound ( irritated , doubtless , by the violent exertion that I had imposed on myself ) had opened again . I struggled against the sudden sense of faintness that seized on me ; I tried to tell the people of the inn what to do . It was useless . I dropped to my knees ; my head sunk on the bosom of the woman stretched senseless upon the low couch beneath me . The death - in - life that had got her had got me . Lost to the world about us , we lay , with my blood flowing on her , united in our deathly trance . Where were our spirits at that moment ? Were they together and conscious of each other ? United by a spiritual bond , undiscovered and unsuspected by us in the flesh , did we two , who had met as strangers on the fatal bridge , know each other again in the trance ? You who have loved and lost — you whose one consolation it has been to believe in other worlds than this — can you turn from my questions in contempt ? Can you honestly say that they have never been your questions too ? THE morning sunlight shining in at a badly curtained window ; a clumsy wooden bed , with big twisted posts that reached to the ceiling ; on one side of the bed , my mother ’s welcome face ; on the other side , an elderly gentleman unremembered by me at that moment — such were the objects that presented themselves to my view , when I first consciously returned to the world that we live in . “
21439	21440	21430	21430	He	675	” “
21454	21475	21476	21476	doctor	674	” My mother was rejoicing over me on one side of the bed ; and the unknown gentleman , addressed as “
21478	21498	21476	21476	doctor	674	” was offering me a spoonful of whisky - and - water on the other . He called it the “
21502	21609	21430	21430	He	675	” ; and he bid me remark ( speaking in a strong Scotch accent ) that he tasted it himself to show he was in earnest . The stimulant did its good work . My head felt less giddy , my mind became clearer . I could speak collectedly to my mother ; I could vaguely recall the more marked events of the previous evening . A minute or two more , and the image of the person in whom those events had all centered became a living image in my memory . I tried to raise myself in the bed ; I asked , impatiently , “
21614	21635	21640	21640	sir	2230	” The doctor produced another spoonful of the elixir of life , and gravely repeated his first address to me . “
21649	21657	21640	21640	sir	2230	” I persisted in repeating my question : “
21662	21671	21640	21640	sir	2230	” The doctor persisted in repeating his formula : “
21678	21705	21640	21640	sir	2230	” I was too weak to contest the matter ; I obeyed . My medical attendant nodded across the bed to my mother , and said , “
21712	21730	21708	21708	he	2230	” My mother had some compassion on me . She relieved my anxiety in these plain words : “
21745	21776	21741	21742	the doctor	364	” I looked at my professional colleague with a new interest . He was the legitimate fountainhead of the information that I was dying to have poured into my mind . “
21783	21787	21779	21779	you	364	” I asked . “
21793	21806	21779	21779	you	364	” The doctor held up his hand , warning me to stop . “
21819	21829	21830	21830	You	2230	” he began , in a very positive manner . “
21950	22016	21938	21939	the poet	687	” So he spoke , pronouncing in his strong Scotch accent the most carefully selected English I had ever heard . A hard - headed , square - shouldered , pertinaciously self - willed man — it was plainly useless to contend with him . I turned to my mother ’s gentle face for encouragement ; and I let my doctor have his own way . “
22020	22024	22026	22026	MacGlue	104	” he proceeded , “
22088	22095	22098	22098	me	0	” There my patience gave way . “
22100	22104	22098	22098	me	0	” I interposed . “
22111	22112	22108	22109	the lady	2202	” “
22121	22128	22116	22116	your	688	” cried Mr. MacGlue , severely . “
22148	22164	22140	22140	I	0	” he went on , after he had forced me to submit to the penalty . “
22562	22563	22564	22564	He	2230	” “
22573	22584	22564	22564	He	2230	” said my mother , interpreting my wishes for me . “
22590	22613	22587	22588	the lady	2202	” resumed Mr. MacGlue , with the air of a man who found no great attraction in the subject proposed to him . “
22869	22883	22863	22863	she	2202	” I was too much excited to be able to exercise my ingenuity . “
22889	22895	22863	22863	she	2202	” I said , impatiently . “
22903	22908	22912	22912	she	2202	” remarked Mr. MacGlue . “
23440	23441	23429	23429	she	759	” “
23456	23460	23442	23442	You	0	” I exclaimed . “
23467	23477	23464	23464	I	0	” said the doctor , as positively as ever . “
23590	23603	23587	23587	him	768	” With those parting words , Mr. MacGlue left us to ourselves . “
23609	23616	23587	23587	him	768	” I said to my mother . “
23629	23630	23634	23634	her	2202	” “
23638	23643	23636	23636	George	74	” my mother answered . “
23657	23665	23644	23645	The lady	2202	” I was bitterly disappointed . Yes : “
23667	23680	23636	23636	George	74	” is the word — though she was a stranger to me . “
23687	23691	23682	23682	you	0	” I asked . “
23711	23712	23715	23715	she	2202	” “
23718	23719	23715	23715	she	2202	” “
23946	23947	23949	23949	she	781	” “
23955	23956	23949	23949	she	781	” “
24012	24013	24014	24015	Van Brandt	103	” “
24017	24021	24014	24015	Van Brandt	103	” I repeated . “
24046	24047	24050	24050	she	781	” “
24055	24060	24050	24050	she	781	” suggested my mother ; “
24072	24293	24294	24294	I	0	” The idea of her being a married woman had something in it repellent to me . I wished my mother had not thought of that last suggestion . I refused to receive it . I persisted in my own belief that the stranger was a single woman . In that character , I could indulge myself in the luxury of thinking of her ; I could consider the chances of my being able to trace this charming fugitive , who had taken so strong a hold on my interest — whose desperate attempt at suicide had so nearly cost me my own life . If she had gone as far as Edinburgh ( which she would surely do , being bent on avoiding discovery ) , the prospect of finding her again — in that great city , and in my present weak state of health — looked doubtful indeed . Still , there was an underlying hopefulness in me which kept my spirits from being seriously depressed . I felt a purely imaginary ( perhaps I ought to say , a purely superstitious ) conviction that we who had nearly died together , we who had been brought to life together , were surely destined to be involved in some future joys or sorrows common to us both . “
24302	24448	24449	24449	Friend	2715	” was my last thought before my weakness overpowered me , and I sunk into a peaceful sleep . That night I was removed from the inn to my own room at home ; and that night I saw her again in a dream . The image of her was as vividly impressed on me as the far different image of the child Mary , when I used to see it in the days of old . The dream - figure of the woman was robed as I had seen it robed on the bridge . She wore the same broad - brimmed garden - hat of straw . She looked at me as she had looked when I approached her in the dim evening light . After a little her face brightened with a divinely beautiful smile ; and she whispered in my ear , “
24456	24753	24452	24452	you	2715	” I knew her , most assuredly ; and yet it was with an incomprehensible after - feeling of doubt . Recognizing her in my dream as the stranger who had so warmly interested me , I was , nevertheless , dissatisfied with myself , as if it had not been the right recognition . I awoke with this idea ; and I slept no more that night . In three days ’ time I was strong enough to go out driving with my mother , in the comfortable , old - fashioned , open carriage which had once belonged to Mr. Germaine . On the fourth day we arranged to make an excursion to a little waterfall in our neighborhood . My mother had a great admiration of the place , and had often expressed a wish to possess some memorial of it . I resolved to take my sketch - book : with me , on the chance that I might be able to please her by making a drawing of her favorite scene . Searching for the sketch - book ( which I had not used for years ) , I found it in an old desk of mine that had remained unopened since my departure for India . In the course of my investigation , I opened a drawer in the desk , and discovered a relic of the old times — my poor little Mary ’s first work in embroidery , the green flag ! The sight of the forgotten keepsake took my mind back to the bailiff ’s cottage , and reminded me of Dame Dermody , and her confident prediction about Mary and me . I smiled as I recalled the old woman ’s assertion that no human power could “
24770	24885	24452	24452	you	2715	” What had become of the prophesied dreams in which we were to communicate with each other through the term of our separation ? Years had passed ; and , sleeping or waking , I had seen nothing of Mary . Years had passed ; and the first vision of a woman that had come to me had been my dream a few nights since of the stranger whom I had saved from drowning . I thought of these chances and changes in my life , but not contemptuously or bitterly . The new love that was now stealing its way into my heart had softened and humanized me . I said to myself , “
24892	25291	25292	25292	George	74	” and I kissed the green flag , in grateful memory of the days that were gone forever . We drove to the waterfall . It was a beautiful day ; the lonely sylvan scene was at its brightest and best . A wooden summer - house , commanding a prospect of the falling stream , had been built for the accommodation of pleasure parties by the proprietor of the place . My mother suggested that I should try to make a sketch of the view from this point . I did my best to please her , but I was not satisfied with the result ; and I abandoned my drawing before it was half finished . Leaving my sketch - book and pencil on the table of the summer - house , I proposed to my mother to cross a little wooden bridge which spanned the stream , below the fall , and to see how the landscape looked from a new point of view . The prospect of the waterfall , as seen from the opposite bank , presented even greater difficulties , to an amateur artist like me , than the prospect which he had just left . We returned to the summer - house . I was the first to approach the open door . I stopped , checked in my advance by an unexpected discovery . The summer - house was no longer empty as we had left it . A lady was seated at the table with my pencil in her hand , writing in my sketch - book ! After waiting a moment , I advanced a few steps nearer to the door , and stopped again in breathless amazement . The stranger in the summer - house was now plainly revealed to me as the woman who had attempted to destroy herself from the bridge ! There was no doubt about it . There was the dress ; there was the memorable face which I had seen in the evening light , which I had dreamed of only a few nights since ! The woman herself — I saw her as plainly as I saw the sun shining on the waterfall — the woman herself , with my pencil in her hand , writing in my book ! My mother was close behind me . She noticed my agitation . “
25294	25298	25292	25292	George	74	” she exclaimed , “
25306	25319	25304	25304	you	74	” I pointed through the open door of the summer - house . “
25322	25327	25304	25304	you	74	” said my mother . “
25335	25336	25330	25330	I	0	” “
25354	25361	25341	25341	somebody	793	” My mother eyed me quickly . “
25370	25538	25540	25540	me	0	” I heard her say to herself . At the same moment the woman laid down the pencil and rose slowly to her feet . She looked at me with sorrowful and pleading eyes : she lifted her hand and beckoned me to approach her . I obeyed . Moving without conscious will of my own , drawn nearer and nearer to her by an irresistible power , I ascended the short flight of stairs which led into the summer - house . Within a few paces of her I stopped . She advanced a step toward me , and laid her hand gently on my bosom . Her touch filled me with strangely united sensations of rapture and awe . After a while , she spoke in low melodious tones , which mingled in my ear with the distant murmur of the falling water , until the two sounds became one . I heard in the murmur , I heard in the voice , these words : “
25546	25874	25875	25875	Somebody	793	” Her hand dropped from my bosom ; a momentary obscurity passed like a flying shadow over the bright daylight in the room . I looked for her when the light came back . She was gone . My consciousness of passing events returned . I saw the lengthening shadows outside , which told me that the evening was at hand . I saw the carriage approaching the summerhouse to take us away . I felt my mother ’s hand on my arm , and heard her voice speaking to me anxiously . I was able to reply by a sign entreating her not to be uneasy about me , but I could do no more . I was absorbed , body and soul , in the one desire to look at the sketch - book . As certainly as I had seen the woman , so certainly I had seen her , with my pencil in her hand , writing in my book . I advanced to the table on which the book was lying open . I looked at the blank space on the lower part of the page , under the foreground lines of my unfinished drawing . My mother , following me , looked at the page too . There was the writing ! The woman had disappeared , but there were her written words left behind her : visible to my mother as well as to me , readable by my mother ’s eyes as well as by mine ! These were the words we saw , arranged in two lines , as I copy them here : I POINTED to the writing in the sketch book , and looked at my mother . I was not mistaken . She had seen it , as I had seen it . But she refused to acknowledge that anything had happened to alarm her — plainly as I could detect it in her face . “
25886	26134	25884	25884	George	74	” she said . I made no reply . It was needless to say anything . My poor mother was evidently as far from being satisfied with her own shallow explanation as I was . The carriage waited for us at the door . We set forth in silence on our drive home . The sketch - book lay open on my knee . My eyes were fastened on it ; my mind was absorbed in recalling the moment when the apparition beckoned me into the summer - house and spoke . Putting the words and the writing together , the conclusion was too plain to be mistaken . The woman whom I had saved from drowning had need of me again . And this was the same woman who , in her own proper person , had not hesitated to seize the first opportunity of leaving the house in which we had been sheltered together — without stopping to say one grateful word to the man who had preserved her from death ! Four days only had elapsed since she had left me , never ( to all appearance ) to see me again . And now the ghostly apparition of her had returned as to a tried and trusted friend ; had commanded me to remember her and to go to her ; and had provided against all possibility of my memory playing me false , by writing the words which invited me to meet her “
26146	26214	25884	25884	George	74	” What had happened in the interval ? What did the supernatural manner of her communication with me mean ? What ought my next course of action to be ? My mother roused me from my reflections . She stretched out her hand , and suddenly closed the open book on my knee , as if the sight of the writing in it were unendurable to her . “
26225	26229	26218	26218	you	796	” she said . “
26239	26240	26232	26232	you	796	” “
26248	26252	26253	26253	I	0	” I answered . “
26293	26304	26283	26283	I	0	” I touched the sketch - book as I spoke . “
26311	26315	26283	26283	I	0	” I said , “
26323	26340	26341	26341	He	797	” My mother looked at me as if she doubted the evidence of her own senses . “
26351	26355	26341	26341	He	797	” she exclaimed . “
26417	26426	26427	26427	I	0	” I opened the sketch - book again . “
26437	26441	26431	26431	her	221	” I answered . “
26454	26479	26431	26431	her	221	” My mother refused to look at it . Steadily as she persisted in taking the rational view , nevertheless the writing frightened her . “
26487	26492	26431	26431	her	221	” she went on , “
26562	26604	26560	26560	yourself	74	” She tried to set the example of laughing at me — with the tears in her eyes , poor soul ! as she made the useless effort . I began to regret having opened my mind so freely to her . “
26615	26619	26613	26613	mother	805	” I said . “
26676	26677	26669	26669	you	805	” “
26680	26687	26669	26669	you	805	” cried my mother , fervently . “
26714	26715	26711	26712	the doctor	364	” “
26766	26990	26763	26764	the doctor	364	” I spoke lightly , but I really meant what I said . My mind was sadly disturbed ; my nerves were so shaken that the slightest noises on the road startled me . The opinion of a man like Mr. MacGlue , who looked at all mortal matters from the same immovably practical point of view , might really have its use , in my case , as a species of moral remedy . We waited until the dessert was on the table , and the servants had left the dining - room . Then I told my story to the Scotch doctor as I have told it here ; and , that done , I opened the sketch - book to let him see the writing for himself . Had I turned to the wrong page ? I started to my feet , and held the book close to the light of the lamp that hung over the dining table . No : I had found the right page . There was my half - finished drawing of the waterfall — but where were the two lines of writing beneath ? Gone ! I strained my eyes ; I looked and looked . And the blank white paper looked back at me . I placed the open leaf before my mother . “
27000	27004	26991	26991	You	813	” I said . “
27020	27034	26991	26991	You	813	” My mother sunk back in her chair with a cry of terror . “
27037	27041	26991	26991	You	813	” I asked . “
27044	27088	27089	27089	I	0	” I turned to the doctor . He took me completely by surprise . No incredulous smile appeared on his face ; no jesting words passed his lips . He was listening to us attentively . He was waiting gravely to hear more . “
27100	27106	27089	27089	I	0	” I said to him , “
27180	27181	27170	27170	yourself	813	” “
27190	27197	27170	27170	yourself	813	” Mr. MacGlue repeated , quietly . “
27211	27216	27218	27219	my mother	365	” I went on , “
27232	27233	27226	27226	she	365	” “
27245	27257	27239	27239	you	813	” answered Mr. MacGlue , with a composure that surprised me . “
27264	27268	27259	27259	you	813	” I asked . “
27271	27277	27259	27259	you	813	” said the impenetrable doctor , “
27392	27393	27389	27390	Mr. Germaine	74	” “
27417	27418	27419	27419	I	0	” “
27425	27430	27419	27419	I	0	” answered Mr. MacGlue ; “
27451	27463	27441	27441	I	0	” This was surprising , to say the least of it . “
27470	27483	27466	27466	you	0	” I inquired . Mr. MacGlue declined to let me hurry him . “
27488	27492	27466	27466	you	0	” he said . “
27760	27777	27747	27747	I	0	” Mr. MacGlue ’s sublime indifference to both sides of the question began to irritate me . “
27784	27788	27747	27747	I	0	” I said , “
27806	27807	27808	27808	I	0	” “
27821	27826	27808	27808	I	0	” answered the doctor . “
27993	28008	28011	28011	sir	2230	” At those words my mother joined in the conversation for the first time . “
28013	28017	28011	28011	sir	2230	” she said , “
28059	28070	28086	28086	he	574	” Even this revelation entirely failed to surprise Mr. MacGlue . “
28127	28142	28144	28144	you	0	” This was a startling announcement . Did he really mean what he said ? “
28151	28155	28144	28144	you	0	” I asked . “
28162	28167	28156	28156	I	0	” said Mr. MacGlue . “
28258	28259	28261	28261	you	2230	” “
28267	28271	28261	28261	you	2230	” I said , “
28286	28287	28276	28284	another man who has seen what I have seen	845	” “
28298	28303	28292	28292	I	0	” rejoined the doctor . “
28812	29116	28802	28802	I	0	“ Well ( it ’s fine old wine , that ; look at the oily drops running down the glass)—well , steering to the north - west , you will understand , was out of the captain ’s course . Nevertheless , finding no solution of the mystery on board the ship , and the weather at the time being fine , the captain determined , while the daylight lasted , to alter his course , and see what came of it . Toward three o’clock in the afternoon an iceberg came of it ; with a wrecked ship stove in , and frozen fast to the ice ; and the passengers and crew nigh to death with cold and exhaustion . Wonderful enough , you will say ; but more remains behind . As the mate was helping one of the rescued passengers up the side of the bark , who should he turn out to be but the very man whose ghostly appearance Bruce had seen in the captain ’s cabin writing on the captain ’s slate ! And more than that — if your capacity for being surprised is n’t clean worn out by this time — the passenger recognized the bark as the very vessel which he had seen in a dream at noon that day . He had even spoken of it to one of the officers on board the wrecked ship when he woke . ‘ We shall be rescued to - day , ’ he had said ; and he had exactly described the rig of the bark hours and hours before the vessel herself hove in view . Now you know , Mr. Germaine , how my wife ’s far - away cousin kept an appointment with a ghost , and what came of it . ”

29150	29157	29158	29158	I	0	“ The writing on the slate , ”
29161	29178	29158	29158	I	0	“ Did it remain there , or did it vanish like the writing in my book ? ”
29239	29303	29304	29304	I	0	“ There ’s a marvelous resemblance , Mr. Germaine , between your story and Bruce ’s story . The main difference , as I see it , is this . The passenger ’s appointment proved to be the salvation of a whole ship ’s company . I very much doubt whether the lady ’s appointment will prove to be the salvation of You . ”
29353	29366	29367	29367	she	365	“ I wish you had kept your story to yourself , doctor , ”
29372	29380	29367	29367	she	365	“ May I ask why , madam ? ”
29381	29401	29335	29336	My mother	365	“ You have confirmed my son , sir , in his resolution to go to Saint Anthony ’s Well . ”
29413	29426	29427	29427	he	104	“ It ’s the full moon on the ninth of the month , ”
29430	29487	29427	29427	he	104	“ That gives Mr. Germaine some days of rest , ma’am , before he takes the journey . If he travels in his own comfortable carriage — whatever I may think , morally speaking , of his enterprise — I ca n’t say , medically speaking , that I believe it will do him much harm . ”
29488	29498	29499	29499	I	0	“ You know where Saint Anthony ’s Well is ? ”
29502	29515	29517	29518	the doctor	364	“ I must be mighty ignorant of Edinburgh not to know that , ”
29520	29529	29517	29518	the doctor	364	“ Is the Well in Edinburgh , then ? ”
29530	29664	29665	29666	My mother	365	“ It ’s just outside Edinburgh — looks down on it , as you may say . You follow the old street called the Canongate to the end . You turn to your right past the famous Palace of Holyrood ; you cross the Park and the Drive , and take your way upward to the ruins of Anthony ’s Chapel , on the shoulder of the hill — and there you are ! There ’s a high rock behind the chapel , and at the foot of it you will find the spring they call Anthony ’s Well . It ’s thought a pretty view by moonlight ; and they tell me it ’s no longer beset at night by bad characters , as it used to be in the old time . ”
29683	29691	29692	29692	she	365	“ I confess you have disappointed me , ”
29698	29720	29692	29692	she	365	“ I should have thought you would have been the last man to encourage my son in an act of imprudence . ”
29721	29783	29784	29785	Mr. MacGlue	104	“ Craving your pardon , madam , your son requires no encouragement . I can see for myself that his mind is made up . Where is the use of a person like me trying to stop him ? Dear madam , if he wo n’t profit by your advice , what hope can I have that he will take mine ? ”
29835	29867	29869	29871	the prudent doctor	891	“ Take two days to do the journey , and you may start , if you ’re bent on it , at the beginning of the week . But mind this , ”
29873	29911	29869	29871	the prudent doctor	891	“ though I own I ’m anxious to hear what comes of your expedition — understand at the same time , so far as the lady is concerned , that I wash my hands of the consequences . ”

30470	30476	30477	30477	she	907	“ What did I say ? ”
30480	30486	30477	30477	she	907	“ What did I write ? ”
30487	30516	30456	30456	She	907	“ You said , ‘ Remember me . Come to me . ’ You wrote , ‘ When the full moon shines on Saint Anthony ’s Well . ’ ”

30699	30744	30696	30696	she	907	“ And I do . I am not so ungrateful as I seem . I am not a wicked woman , sir — I was mad with misery when I tried to drown myself . Do n’t distrust me ! Do n’t despise me ! ”
30797	30801	30802	30802	she	907	“ Mind this ! ”
30809	30870	30802	30802	she	907	“ you were dreaming when you thought you saw me writing . You did n’t see me ; you never heard me speak . How could I say those familiar words to a stranger like you ? It ’s all your fancy — and you try to frighten me by talking of it as if it was a real thing ! ”
30912	30920	30923	30923	her	907	“ What is the matter with me ? ”
30928	30950	30923	30923	her	907	“ Why do I trust this man in my dreams ? And why am I ashamed of it when I wake ? ”
30970	30985	30986	30986	I	0	“ If you trust me in your dreams , you only do me justice , ”
30989	31023	30986	30986	I	0	“ Do me justice now ; give me your confidence . You are alone — you are in trouble — you want a friend ’s help . I am waiting to help you . ”

31247	31267	31239	31239	she	907	“ The name is common enough : one meets with it everywhere as a man ’s name And yet — ”

32023	32035	32036	32036	I	0	“ You spoke a little while since of dreaming of me , ”

I went upstairs ( at the inn where I am staying ) , and lay down , quite worn out , on my bed . I do n’t know whether I fainted or whether I slept ; I lost all consciousness of what was going on about me , and I got some other consciousness in its place . If this was dreaming , I can only say it was the most vivid dream I ever had in my life . ”
32504	32513	32514	32514	I	0	“ Did it begin by your seeing me ? ”
32517	32539	32514	32514	I	0	“ It began by my seeing your drawing - book — lying open on a table in a summer - house . ”

32646	32653	32654	32654	she	949	“ You have mentioned it already , ”
32657	32701	32654	32654	she	949	“ There is no need for me to go over the words again . Tell me one thing — when you were at the summer - house , did you wait a little on the path to the door before you went in ? ”

I spoke to you as I might have spoken to my oldest and dearest friend . I said , ‘ Remember me . Come to me . ’ Oh , I was so ashamed of myself when I came to my senses again , and recollected it . Was there ever such familiarity — even in a dream — between a woman and a man whom she had only once seen , and then as a perfect stranger ? ”
32880	32889	32890	32890	I	0	“ Did you notice how long it was , ”

33224	33277	33221	33221	I	0	“ I will not ask you to admit me any further into your confidence until we meet again . Only let me hear how I can relieve your most pressing anxieties . What are your plans ? Can I do anything to help them before you go to rest to - night ? ”
33302	33310	33311	33311	I	0	“ Do you propose staying in Edinburgh ? ”
33314	33384	33385	33385	She	962	“ Oh no ! I do n’t wish to remain in Scotland . I want to go much further away . I think I should do better in London ; at some respectable milliner ’s , if I could be properly recommended . I am quick at my needle , and I understand cutting out . Or I could keep accounts , if — if anybody would trust me . ”
33431	33442	33443	33443	I	0	“ I can give you exactly the recommendation you want , ”
33446	33459	33443	33443	I	0	“ whenever you like . Now , if you would prefer it . ”
33467	33478	33479	33479	she	962	“ Oh , you are indeed a friend to me ! ”
33498	33504	33505	33505	she	962	“ Have I any right , ”
33510	33518	33505	33505	she	962	“ to accept what you offer me ? ”
33519	33527	33528	33528	I	0	“ Let me give you the letter , ”
33531	33546	33528	33528	I	0	“ and you can decide for yourself whether you will use it or not . ”
33667	33670	33649	33649	she	962	“ bar , ”
33833	33850	33828	33828	she	962	“ I do n’t think you ought to write your letter to - night , sir . ”
33851	33855	33828	33828	she	962	“ Why not ? ”
33856	33973	33974	33974	Her	981	“ You know nothing of me . Surely you ought not to recommend a person who is a stranger to you ? And I am worse than a stranger . I am a miserable wretch who has tried to commit a great sin — I have tried to destroy myself . Perhaps the misery I was in might be some excuse for me , if you knew it . You ought to know it . But it ’s so late to - night , and I am so sadly tired — and there are some things , sir , which it is not easy for a woman to speak of in the presence of a man . ”
34070	34076	34077	34077	I	0	“ In the mean time , ”
34080	34139	34077	34077	I	0	“ I have the most perfect confidence in you ; and I beg as a favor that you will let me put it to the proof . I can introduce you to a dressmaker in London who is at the head of a large establishment , and I will do it before I leave you to - night . ”
34385	34395	34380	34380	she	992	“ Would you mind adding a postscript , sir ? ”
34415	34421	34422	34422	she	992	“ Would you please say , ”
34426	34447	34422	34422	she	992	“ that I am only to be taken on trial , at first ? I am not to be engaged for more”—her
34462	34470	34422	34422	she	992	words—“for more than three months , certain . ”
34521	34530	34531	34531	I	0	“ Have you some other employment in prospect ? ”
34534	34537	34538	34538	she	992	“ None , ”
34571	34578	34579	34579	I	0	“ Have you some absent friend , ”
34583	34603	34579	34579	I	0	“ who is likely to prove a better friend than I am , if you only give him time ? ”
34626	34637	34638	34638	she	992	“ I have not got a friend in the world , ”
34641	34656	34638	34638	she	992	“ For God ’s sake , ask me no more questions to - night ! ”
34694	34701	34702	34702	she	992	“ How can I thank you ? ”
34707	34727	34702	34702	she	992	“ Oh , sir , I will indeed be worthy of the confidence that you have shown in me ! ”
34784	34789	34781	34781	I	0	“ I love you ! ”
34856	34871	34872	34872	she	992	“ How dare you take advantage of me ! How dare you touch me ! ”
34875	34919	34920	34920	she	992	“ Take your letter back , sir ; I refuse to receive it ; I will never speak to you again . You do n’t know what you have done . You do n’t know how deeply you have wounded me . Oh ! ”
34935	34959	34920	34920	she	992	“ shall I ever recover my self - respect ? shall I ever forgive myself for what I have done to - night ? ”
35030	35039	35040	35040	I	0	“ You will give me time for atonement ? ”
35043	35091	35040	35040	I	0	“ You will not lose all confidence in me ? Let me see you again , if it is only to show that I am not quite unworthy of your pardon — at your own time ; in the presence of another person , if you like . ”
35092	35099	35100	35100	she	992	“ I will write to you , ”
35103	35108	35100	35100	she	992	“ To - morrow ? ”
35109	35114	35115	35115	I	0	“ To - morrow . ”
35126	35134	35135	35135	I	0	“ Make your goodness to me complete , ”
35138	35150	35135	35135	I	0	“ Do n’t mortify me by refusing to take my letter . ”
35151	35158	35159	35159	she	992	“ I will take your letter , ”
35164	35181	35159	35159	she	992	“ Thank you for writing it . Leave me now , please . Good - night . ”
35587	35596	35598	35600	this obstinate person	1013	“ I have given the lady my promise , ”
35602	35659	35598	35600	this obstinate person	1013	“ to answer not one word to any question that you may ask me about her . In my belief , she is acting as becomes an honest woman in removing herself from any further communication with you . I saw you through the keyhole last night , sir . I wish you good - morning . ”
35750	35769	35778	35779	the three	1021	“ elegant young ladies , with their veils down , and with traveling - bags in their hands , ”
35878	36033	35864	35864	she	1015	“ DEAR SIR — Forgive me for leaving you again as I left you in Perthshire . After what took place last night , I have no other choice ( knowing my own weakness , and the influence that you seem to have over me ) than to thank you gratefully for your kindness , and to bid you farewell . My sad position must be my excuse for separating myself from you in this rude manner , and for venturing to send you back your letter of introduction . If I use the letter , I only offer you a means of communicating with me . For your sake , as well as for mine , this mu st not be . I must never give you a second opportunity of saying that you love me ; I must go away , leaving no trace behind by which you can possibly discover me . “
36115	36192	36194	36194	me	0	“ I was married , not very long since , to a Dutch gentleman , whose name is Van Brandt . Please excuse my entering into family particulars . I have endeavored to write and tell you about my dear lost father and my old home . But the tears come into my eyes when I think of my happy past life . I really can not see the lines as I try to write them . “
36321	36346	36347	36347	I	0	“ So the time went on , sir , prosperously enough , until the evening came when you and I met on the bridge . “
36730	36765	36707	36707	I	0	“ How long a time passed I do n’t know . My anxiety got to such a pitch at last that I could bear it no longer . I ventured back to the house . “
36799	36898	36790	36790	I	0	“ The room was empty . There was a letter on the table . It was in my husband ’s handwriting , and it was addressed to me . I opened it and read it . The letter told me that I was deserted , disgraced , ruined . The woman with the fiery face and the impudent eyes was Van Brandt ’s lawful wife . She had given him his choice of going away with her at once or of being prosecuted for bigamy . He had gone away with her — gone , and left me . “
36975	37057	36961	36961	I	0	“ Mind this : I believe I should never have attempted to destroy myself if I could only have burst out crying . No tears came to me . A dull , stunned feeling took hold like a vise on my head and on my heart . I walked straight to the river . I said to myself , quite calmly , as I went along , ‘ There is the end of it , and the sooner the better . ’ “
37097	37347	37083	37083	I	0	“ I had but one reason , sir , for going away by the first conveyance that I could find to take me , and this was the fear that Van Brandt might discover me if I remained in Perthshire . The letter that he had left on the table was full of expressions of love and remorse , to say nothing of excuses for his infamous behavior to me . He declared that he had been entrapped into a private marriage with a profligate woman when he was little more than a lad . They had long since separated by common consent . When he first courted me , he had every reason to believe that she was dead . How he had been deceived in this particular , and how she had discovered that he had married me , he had yet to find out . Knowing her furious temper , he had gone away with her , as the one means of preventing an application to the justices and a scandal in the neighborhood . In a day or two he would purchase his release from her by an addition to the allowance which she had already received from him : he would return to me and take me abroad , out of the way of further annoyance . I was his wife in the sight of Heaven ; I was the only woman he had ever loved ; and so on , and so on . “
37458	37507	37508	37508	I	0	“ The coachman recommended me to the house in the Canongate where you found me lodging . I wrote the same day to relatives of my father , living in Glasgow , to tell them where I was , and in what a forlorn position I found myself . “
37561	37661	37534	37534	They	428	“ They arrived , as they had promised , and they expressed themselves civilly enough . Moreover , they did certainly lend me a small sum of money when they found how poorly my purse was furnished . But I do n’t think either husband or wife felt much for me . They recommended me , at parting , to apply to my father ’s other relatives , living in England . I may be doing them an injustice , but I fancy they were eager to get me ( as the common phrase is ) off their hands . “
37734	37863	37868	37868	I	0	“ In this wretched condition you discovered me on that favorite walk of mine from Holyrood to Saint Anthony ’s Well . Believe me , your kind interest in my fortunes has not been thrown away on an ungrateful woman . I could ask Providence for no greater blessing than to find a brother and a friend in you . You have yourself destroyed that hope by what you said and did when we were together in the parlor . I do n’t blame you : I am afraid my manner ( without my knowing it ) might have seemed to give you some encouragement . I am only sorry — very , very sorry — to have no honorable choice left but never to see you again . “
37939	37944	37935	37937	your grateful servant	1078	“ M. VAN BRANDT . “
38047	38236	38044	38044	you	2230	” So the letter concluded . I read it in the temper of a thoroughly disappointed and thoroughly unreasonable man . Whatever poor Mrs. Van Brandt had done , she had done wrong . It was wrong of her , in the first place , to have married at all . It was wrong of her to contemplate receiving Mr. Van Brandt again , even if his lawful wife had died in the interval . It was wrong of her to return my letter of introduction , after I had given myself the trouble of altering it to suit her capricious fancy . It was wrong of her to take an absurdly prudish view of a stolen kiss and a tender declaration , and to fly from me as if I were as great a scoundrel as Mr. Van Brandt himself . And last , and more than all , it was wrong of her to sign her Christian name in initial only . Here I was , passionately in love with a woman , and not knowing by what fond name to identify her in my thoughts ! “
38241	38285	38286	38286	Mary	85	” I might call her Maria , Margaret , Martha , Mabel , Magdalen , Mary — no , not Mary . The old boyish love was dead and gone , but I owed some respect to the memory of it . If the “
38287	38322	38323	38323	Mary	85	” of my early days were still living , and if I had met her , would she have treated me as this woman had treated me ? Never ! It was an injury to “
38324	38617	38286	38286	Mary	85	” to think even of that heartless creature by her name . Why think of her at all ? Why degrade myself by trying to puzzle out a means of tracing her in her letter ? It was sheer folly to attempt to trace a woman who had gone I knew not whither , and who herself informed me that she meant to pass under an assumed name . Had I lost all pride , all self - respect ? In the flower of my age , with a handsome fortune , with the world before me , full of interesting female faces and charming female figures , what course did it become me to take ? To go back to my country - house , and mope over the loss of a woman who had deliberately deserted me ? or to send for a courier and a traveling carriage , and forget her gayly among foreign people and foreign scenes ? In the state of my temper at that moment , the idea of a pleasure tour in Europe fired my imagination . I first astonished the people at the hotel by ordering all further inquiries after the missing Mrs. Van Brandt to be stopped ; and then I opened my writing desk and wrote to tell my mother frankly and fully of my new plans . The answer arrived by return of post . To my surprise and delight , my good mother was not satisfied with only formally approving of my new resolution . With an energy which I had not ventured to expect from her , she had made all her arrangements for leaving home , and had started for Edinburgh to join me as my traveling companion . “
38627	38631	38625	38625	George	74	” she wrote , “
38643	38898	38633	38633	I	0	” In three days from the time when I read those words our preparations were completed , and we were on our way to the Continent . WE visited France , Germany , and Italy ; and we were absent from England nearly two years . Had time and change justified my confidence in them ? Was the image of Mrs. Van Brandt an image long since dismissed from my mind ? No ! Do what I might , I was still ( in the prophetic language of Dame Dermody ) taking the way to reunion with my kindred spirit in the time to come . For the first two or three months of our travels I was haunted by dreams of the woman who had so resolutely left me . Seeing her in my sleep , always graceful , always charming , always modestly tender toward me , I waited in the ardent hope of again beholding the apparition of her in my waking hours — of again being summoned to meet her at a given place and time . My anticipations were not fulfilled ; no apparition showed itself . The dreams themselves grew less frequent and less vivid and then ceased altogether . Was this a sign that the days of her adversity were at an end ? Having no further need of help , had she no further remembrance of the man who had tried to help her ? Were we never to meet again ? I said to myself : “
38915	39085	39086	39086	George	74	” She still kept her place in my memory , say what I might . I saw all the wonders of Nature and Art which foreign countries could show me . I lived in the dazzling light of the best society that Paris , Rome , Vienna could assemble . I passed hours on hours in the company of the most accomplished and most beautiful women whom Europe could produce — and still that solitary figure at Saint Anthony ’s Well , those grand gray eyes that had rested on me so sadly at parting , held their place in my memory , stamped their image on my heart . Whether I resisted my infatuation , or whether I submitted to it , I still longed for her . I did all I could to conceal the state of my mind from my mother . But her loving eyes discovered the secret : she saw that I suffered , and suffered with me . More than once she said : “
39104	39120	39086	39086	George	74	” More than once I answered , with the bitter and obstinate resolution of despair : “
39134	39265	39126	39128	more new people	1087	” It was only when I found her health and strength beginning to fail under the stress of continual traveling that I consented to abandon the hopeless search after oblivion , and to turn homeward at last . I prevailed on my mother to wait and rest at my house in London before she returned to her favorite abode at the country - seat in Perthshire . It is needless to say that I remained in town with her . My mother now represented the one interest that held me nobly and endearingly to life . Politics , literature , agriculture — the customary pursuits of a man in my position — had none of them the slightest attraction for me . We had arrived in London at what is called “
39272	39494	39126	39128	more new people	1087	” Among the operatic attractions of that year — I am writing of the days when the ballet was still a popular form of public entertainment — there was a certain dancer whose grace and beauty were the objects of universal admiration . I was asked if I had seen her , wherever I went , until my social position , as the one man who was indifferent to the reigning goddess of the stage , became quite unendurable . On the next occasion when I was invited to take a seat in a friend ’s box , I accepted the proposal ; and ( far from willingly ) I went the way of the world — in other words , I went to the opera . The first part of the performance had concluded when we got to the theater , and the ballet had not yet begun . My friends amused themselves with looking for familiar faces in the boxes and stalls . I took a chair in a corner and waited , with my mind far away from the theater , from the dancing that was to come . The lady who sat nearest to me ( like ladies in general ) disliked the neighborhood of a silent man . She determined to make me talk to her . “
39502	39506	39499	39500	Mr. Germaine	74	” she said . “
39524	40183	39508	39508	you	74	” She handed me her opera - glass as she spoke . I moved to the front of the box to look at the audience . It was certainty a wonderful sight . Every available atom of space ( as I gradually raised the glass from the floor to the ceiling of the building ) appeared to be occupied . Looking upward and upward , my range of view gradually reached the gallery . Even at that distance , the excellent glass which had been put into my hands brought the faces of the audience close to me . I looked first at the persons who occupied the front row of seats in the gallery stalls . Moving the opera - glass slowly along the semicircle formed by the seats , I suddenly stopped when I reached the middle . My heart gave a great leap as if it would bound out of my body . There was no mistaking that face among the commonplace faces near it . I had discovered Mrs. Van Brandt ! She sat in front — but not alone . There was a man in the stall immediately behind her , who bent over her and spoke to her from time to time . She listened to him , so far as I could see , with something of a sad and weary look . Who was the man ? I might , or might not , find that out . Under any circumstances , I determined to speak to Mrs. Van Brandt . The curtain rose for the ballet . I made the best excuse I could to my friends , and instantly left the box . It was useless to attempt to purchase my admission to the gallery . My money was refused . There was not even standing room left in that part of the theater . But one alternative remained . I returned to the street , to wait for Mrs. Van Brandt at the gallery door until the performance was over . Who was the man in attendance on her — the man whom I had seen sitting behind her , and talking familiarly over her shoulder ? While I paced backward and forward before the door , that one question held possession of my mind , until the oppression of it grew beyond endurance . I went back to my friends in the box , simply and solely to look at the man again . What excuses I made to account for my strange conduct I can not now remember . Armed once more with the lady ’s opera - glass ( I borrowed it and kept it without scruple ) , I alone , of all that vast audience , turned my back on the stage , and riveted my attention on the gallery stalls . There he sat , in his place behind her , to all appearance spell - bound by the fascinations of the graceful dancer . Mrs. Van Brandt , on the contrary , seemed to find but little attraction in the spectacle presented by the stage . She looked at the dancing ( so far as I could see ) in an absent , weary manner . When the applause broke out in a perfect frenzy of cries and clapping of hands , she sat perfectly unmoved by the enthusiasm which pervaded the theater . The man behind her ( annoyed , as I supposed , by the marked indifference which she showed to the performance ) tapped her impatiently on the shoulder , as if he thought that she was quite capable of falling asleep in her stall . The familiarity of the action — confirming the suspicion in my mind which had already identified him with Van Brandt — so enraged me that I said or did something which obliged one of the gentlemen in the box to interfere . “
40191	40195	40196	40196	you	1090	” he whispered , “
40202	40346	40196	40196	you	1090	” He spoke with the authority of an old friend . I had sense enough left to take his advice , and return to my post at the gallery door . A little before midnight the performance ended . The audience began to pour out of the theater . I drew back into a corner behind the door , facing the gallery stairs , and watched for her . After an interval which seemed to be endless , she and her companion appeared , slowly descending the stairs . She wore a long dark cloak ; her head was protected by a quaintly shaped hood , which looked ( on her ) the most becoming head - dress that a woman could wear . As the two passed me , I heard the man speak to her in a tone of sulky annoyance . “
40352	40356	40196	40196	you	1090	” he said , “
40369	40370	40371	40371	I	0	” “
40376	40390	40391	40391	I	0	” she answered with her head down and her eyes on the ground . “
40400	40401	40391	40391	I	0	” “
40409	40410	40411	40411	I	0	” “
40419	40550	40411	40411	I	0	” I followed them unperceived , waiting to present myself to her until the crowd about them had dispersed . In a few minutes they turned into a quiet by - street . I quickened my pace until I was close at her side , and then I took off my hat and spoke to her . She recognized me with a cry of astonishment . For an instant her face brightened radiantly with the loveliest expression of delight that I ever saw on any human countenance . The moment after , all was changed . The charming features saddened and hardened . She stood before me like a woman overwhelmed by shame — without uttering a word , without taking my offered hand . Her companion broke the silence . “
40556	40586	40553	40554	this gentleman	184	” he asked , speaking in a foreign accent , with an under - bred insolence of tone and manner . She controlled herself the moment he addressed her . “
40592	40596	40589	40590	Mr. Germaine	74	” she answered : “
40608	40635	40589	40590	Mr. Germaine	74	” She raised her eyes for a moment to mine , and took refuge , poor soul , in a conventionally polite inquiry after my health . “
40646	40674	40643	40644	Mr. Germaine	74	” said the soft , sweet voice , trembling piteously . I made the customary reply , and explained that I had seen her at the opera . “
40681	40685	40676	40676	you	74	” I asked . “
40696	40707	40708	40708	My	0	” Her companion answered for her before she could speak . “
40736	40811	40728	40728	We	1099	” Saying those words , he took off his hat with a sardonic assumption of respect ; and , holding her arm in his , forced her to walk on abruptly with him . Feeling certainly assured by this time that the man was no other than Van Brandt , I was on the point of answering him sharply , when Mrs. Van Brandt checked the rash words as they rose to my lips . “
40816	41227	40728	40728	We	1099	” she whispered , over her shoulder , with an imploring look that instantly silenced me . After all , she was free ( if she liked ) to go back to the man who had so vilely deceived and deserted her . I bowed and left them , feeling with no common bitterness the humiliation of entering into rivalry with Mr. Van Brandt . I crossed to the other side of the street . Before I had taken three steps away from her , the old infatuation fastened its hold on me again . I submitted , without a struggle against myself , to the degradation of turning spy and following them home . Keeping well behind , on the opposite side of the way , I tracked them to their own door , and entered in my pocket - book the name of the street and the number of the house . The hardest critic who reads these lines can not feel more contemptuously toward me than I felt toward myself . Could I still love a woman after she had deliberately preferred to me a scoundrel who had married her while he was the husband of another wife ? Yes ! Knowing what I now knew , I felt that I loved her just as dearly as ever . It was incredible , it was shocking ; but it was true . For the first time in my life , I tried to take refuge from my sense of my own degradation in drink . I went to my club , and joined a convivial party at a supper table , and poured glass after glass of champagne down my throat , without feeling the slightest sense of exhilaration , without losing for an instant the consciousness of my own contemptible conduct . I went to my bed in despair ; and through the wakeful night I weakly cursed the fatal evening at the river - side when I had met her for the first time . But revile her as I might , despise myself as I might , I loved her — I loved her still ! Among the letters laid on my table the next morning there were two which must find their place in this narrative . The first letter was in a handwriting which I had seen once before , at the hotel in Edinburgh . The writer was Mrs. Van Brandt . “
41232	41238	41229	41229	your	1100	” ( the letter ran ) “
41308	41359	41287	41298	the miserable woman who now writes to you for the last time	1102	” Those sad lines were signed in initials only . It is needless to say that they merely strengthened my resolution to see her at all hazards . I kissed the paper on which her hand had rested , and then I turned to the second letter . It contained the “
41361	41377	41378	41380	Mr. Van Brandt	102	” to which my correspondent had alluded , and it was expressed in these terms : “
41471	41689	41690	41690	My	0	” That Mr. Van Brandt had some sordid interest of his own to serve in writing this grotesquely impudent composition , and that the unhappy woman who bore his name was heartily ashamed of the proceeding on which he had ventured , were conclusions easily drawn after reading the two letters . The suspicion of the man and of his motives which I naturally felt produced no hesitation in my mind as to the course which I had determined to pursue . On the contrary , I rejoiced that my way to an interview with Mrs. Van Brandt was smoothed , no matter with what motives , by Mr. Van Brandt himself . I waited at home until noon , and then I could wait no longer . Leaving a message of excuse for my mother ( I had just sense of shame enough left to shrink from facing her ) , I hastened away to profit by my invitation on the very day when I received it . As I lifted my hand to ring the house bell , the door was opened from within , and no less a person than Mr. Van Brandt himself stood before me . He had his hat on . We had evidently met just as he was going out . “
41733	41762	41722	41724	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” He threw open the door of a room on the ground - floor . His politeness was ( if possible ) even more offensive than his insolence . “
41774	41795	41772	41772	you	1103	” He turned to the open door , and called up the stairs , in a loud and confident voice : “
41802	41803	41804	41804	Mary	85	” “
41805	41965	41966	41966	I	0	” ! I knew her Christian name at last , and knew it through Van Brandt . No words can tell how the name jarred on me , spoken by his lips . For the first time for years past my mind went back to Mary Dermody and Greenwater Broad . The next moment I heard the rustling of Mrs. Van Brandt ’s dress on the stairs . As the sound caught my ear , the old times and the old faces vanished again from my thoughts as completely as if they had never existed . What had she in common with the frail , shy little child , her namesake , of other days ? What similarity was perceivable in the sooty London lodging - house to remind me of the bailiff ’s flower - scented cottage by the shores of the lake ? Van Brandt took off his hat , and bowed to me with sickening servility . “
41972	41976	41989	41991	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” he said , “
42000	42025	42026	42027	Mr. Germaine	74	” The house door opened and closed again . The rustling of the dress came slowly nearer and nearer . She stood before me . “
42029	42046	42026	42027	Mr. Germaine	74	” she exclaimed , starting back , as if the bare sight of me repelled her . “
42104	42132	42099	42099	you	74	” Her reproaches passed by me unheeded . They only heightened her color ; they only added a new rapture to the luxury of looking at her . “
42144	42148	42134	42134	you	74	” I said , “
42176	42193	42205	42205	You	0	” She suddenly approached me , and fixed her eyes in eager scrutiny on my face . “
42200	42204	42205	42205	You	0	” she said . “
42221	42222	42215	42215	you	0	” “
42234	42235	42229	42229	I	0	” “
42248	42249	42242	42242	you	0	” “
42252	42290	42242	42242	you	0	” She sat down by the table , and , leaning her arms on it , covered her face with her hands . My answers seemed not only to have distressed , but to have perplexed her . “
42296	42302	42303	42303	I	0	” I heard her say . “
42325	42362	42303	42303	I	0	” I closed the door and seated myself by her side . She removed her hands from her face when she felt me near her . She looked at me with a cold and steady surprise . “
42370	42374	42365	42365	you	1111	” she asked . “
42390	42394	42395	42395	I	0	” I said . “
42420	42482	42395	42395	I	0	” She started to her feet , and looked round her incredulously , as if doubting whether she had rightly heard and rightly interpreted my last words . Before I could speak again , she suddenly faced me , and struck her open hand on the table with a passionate resolution which I now saw in her for the first time . “
42485	42489	42395	42395	I	0	” she cried . “
42531	42551	42525	42525	I	0	” There was no choice but to answer her . She was indeed in earnest — vehemently in earnest . “
42557	42561	42563	42563	he	572	” I said , “
42569	42583	42563	42563	he	572	” She sat down again , and turned her face away from me . “
42595	42599	42588	42588	he	572	” she asked . “
42612	42636	42605	42605	him	572	” I thought of the suspicion that had crossed my mind when I read Van Brandt ’s letter . I made no reply . “
42646	42651	42637	42637	You	0	” she went on . “
42849	42895	42896	42896	I	0	” I drew closer to her . She tried to get up and leave me . I knew my power over her , and used it ( as any man in my place would have used it ) without scruple . I took her hand . “
42906	42910	42911	42911	You	0	” I said . “
42965	42985	42958	42958	you	0	” She struggled to free her hand ; I still held it . She tried to change the subject . “
42997	43008	42990	42990	you	0	” she said , with a faint , forced smile . “
43022	43023	43010	43010	you	0	” “
43046	43047	43034	43034	you	0	” “
43064	43111	43060	43060	you	0	” If we had continued to speak on this subject , we must surely have recognized each other . But the subject dropped . Instead of answering her question , I drew her nearer to me — I returned to the forbidden subject of my love . “
43116	43120	43060	43060	you	0	” I pleaded , “
43176	43244	43158	43158	you	0	” I spoke as I felt — fervently , passionately . She made a last effort to repel me , and yielded even as she made it . Her hand closed on mine , a low sigh fluttered on her lips . She answered with a sudden self - abandonment ; she recklessly cast herself loose from the restraints which had held her up to this time . “
43251	43255	43245	43245	I	0	” she said . “
43281	43282	43275	43275	your	0	” “
43287	43291	43283	43283	You	0	” I whispered . “
43295	43299	43293	43293	you	0	” she repeated . “
43342	43371	43340	43340	you	0	” She threw her arms round my neck , and held me to her with all her strength . The moment after , she dropped on her knees . “
43379	43383	43340	43340	you	0	” she murmured . “
43391	43410	43340	43340	you	0	” I was beside myself . I spoke as recklessly to her as she had spoken to me . “
43417	43421	43413	43413	you	0	” I said . “
43464	43465	43458	43458	your	0	” “
43468	43478	43458	43458	your	0	” she answered , crouching low at my feet . “
43487	43488	43489	43489	I	0	” “
43501	43502	43495	43495	I	0	” “
43508	43509	43504	43504	you	0	” “
43544	43558	43537	43537	you	0	” She had roused my jealousy . I positively refused to leave her . “
43570	43574	43559	43559	I	0	” I said . “
43595	43616	43588	43588	I	0	” She looked at me wildly , with a cry of terror . She saw my resolution in my face . “
43622	43626	43628	43628	me	0	” she said . “
43631	43656	43628	43628	me	0	” She reflected for a moment . Her eyes brightened , as if some new way out of the difficulty had occurred to her . “
43663	43667	43628	43628	me	0	” she asked . “
43670	43671	43628	43628	me	0	” “
43682	43683	43673	43673	you	0	” “
43694	43702	43692	43692	her	1138	” She considered with herself once more . “
43713	43719	43703	43703	I	0	” she said , thoughtfully . “
43722	43723	43703	43703	I	0	” “
43732	43754	43703	43703	I	0	” She raised herself on her knees ; the tears suddenly filled her eyes . She drew me to her gently . “
43758	43762	43756	43756	me	0	” she whispered . “
43777	43806	43703	43703	I	0	” My lips had barely touched hers , when she started to her feet and snatched up my hat from the chair on which I had placed it . “
43811	43815	43816	43816	He	1140	” she said . “
43821	43894	43816	43816	He	1140	” My duller sense of hearing had discovered nothing . I rose and took my hat to quiet her . At the same moment the door of the room opened suddenly and softly . Mr. Van Brandt came in . I saw in his face that he had some vile motive of his own for trying to take us by surprise , and that the result of the experiment had disappointed him . “
43901	43916	43917	43917	I	0	” he said , speaking to me with his eye on Mrs. Van Brandt . “
43949	43950	43951	43951	You	0	” “
43956	43960	43951	43951	You	0	” I answered . “
43981	44062	43974	43976	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” I took leave of her as I spoke . She turned deadly pale when she shook hands with me at parting . Had she any open brutality to dread from Van Brandt as soon as my back was turned ? The bare suspicion of it made my blood boil . But I thought of her . In her interests , the wise thing and the merciful thing to do was to conciliate the fellow before I left the house . “
44075	44087	43974	43976	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” I said , as we walked together to the door . “
44096	44102	44089	44089	you	0	” His eyes twinkled cunningly . “
44114	44118	44105	44105	you	0	” he asked . “
44183	44207	44174	44174	we	1142	” She had followed us to the door , keeping behind Van Brandt while he was speaking to me . When he mentioned the “
44210	44213	44174	44174	we	1142	” and the “
44218	44246	44174	44174	we	1142	” her face expressed the strongest emotions of shame and disgust . The next moment ( when she had heard him fix the date of the dinner for “
44253	44279	44174	44174	we	1142	” ) her features became composed again , as if a sudden sense of relief had come to her . What did the change mean ? “
44283	44345	44174	44174	we	1142	” was the day she had appointed for seeing my mother . Did she really believe , when I had heard what passed at the interview , that I should never enter the house again , and never attempt to see her more ? And was this the secret of her composure when she heard the date of the dinner appointed for “
44352	44431	44432	44432	You	1146	” ? Asking myself these questions , I accepted my invitation , and left the house with a heavy heart . That farewell kiss , that sudden composure when the day of the dinner was fixed , weighed on my spirits . I would have given twelve years of my life to have annihilated the next twelve hours . In this frame of mind I reached home , and presented myself in my mother ’s sitting - room . “
44443	44447	44432	44432	You	1146	” she said . “
44458	44469	44470	44470	George	74	” She paused , and looked at me more closely . “
44472	44476	44432	44432	You	1146	” she exclaimed , “
44488	44534	44485	44485	you	74	” I told her the truth as honestly as I have told it here . The color deepened in my mother ’s face . She looked at me , and spoke to me with a severity which was rare indeed in my experience of her . “
44556	44560	44536	44536	I	0	” she asked . “
44580	44581	44576	44576	her	237	” “
44606	44610	44576	44576	her	237	” I interposed . “
44627	44637	44623	44623	I	0	” My mother looked at me in blank dismay . “
44651	44652	44639	44639	you	74	” “
44655	44656	44639	44639	you	74	” “
44663	44664	44665	44665	She	237	” “
44698	44730	44689	44689	She	237	” The serious nature of the emergency had its effect . My mother yielded . She handed me the little ivory tablets on which she was accustomed to record her engagements . “
44738	44743	44689	44689	She	237	” she said resignedly . “
44750	44754	44744	44744	I	0	” I answered , “
44784	44785	44774	44776	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” “
44795	44796	44793	44793	George	74	” “
44808	44917	44793	44793	George	74	” HOW long was I left alone in the carriage at the door of Mrs. Van Brandt ’s lodgings ? Judging by my sensations , I waited half a life - time . Judging by my watch , I waited half an hour . When my mother returned to me , the hope which I had entertained of a happy result from her interview with Mrs. Van Brandt was a hope abandoned before she had opened her lips . I saw , in her face , that an obstacle which was beyond my power of removal did indeed stand between me and the dearest wish of my life . “
44923	44935	44793	44793	George	74	” I said , as we drove away from the house , “
44942	44943	44793	44793	George	74	” “
44953	44960	44962	44962	she	0	” my mother answered , sadly , “
45081	45082	45056	45056	she	0	” “
45106	45107	45102	45102	her	0	” “
45245	45296	45299	45299	she	1162	” My mother paused . I thought directly of the strange postscript which Mrs. Van Brandt had made me add to the letter that I wrote for her at the Edinburgh inn . In that case also she had only contemplated remaining in her employment for three months ’ time . “
45306	45310	45299	45299	she	1162	” I asked . “
45319	45324	45325	45325	She	1162	” replied my mother . “
45582	45591	45596	45596	she	1175	” I interrupted the narrative at that point . “
45603	45607	45596	45596	she	1175	” I said . “
45614	45619	45596	45596	she	1175	” my mother rejoined , “
45637	45657	45627	45627	she	1175	” The question passed by me unheeded : my thoughts were dwelling bitterly on Van Brandt and his advertisement . “
45666	45670	45658	45658	She	1175	” I said . “
45678	45684	45685	45685	She	1175	” my mother went on . “
45967	45997	45964	45964	she	0	” At that crowning point in the narrative , my mother stopped . Was she afraid to go on ? or did she think it needless to say more ? “
46000	46004	45964	45964	she	0	” I said . “
46028	46075	46019	46019	you	1180	” There were two difficulties in the way of my understanding her . I had a man ’s bluntness of perception , and I was half maddened by suspense . Incredible as it may appear , I was too dull to guess the truth even now . “
46082	46087	46077	46077	she	0	” my mother resumed , “
46160	46365	46139	46139	she	0	” Van Brandt ’s child ! Van Brandt ’s child ! The postscript which she had made me add to my letter ; the incomprehensible withdrawal from the employment in which she was prospering ; the disheartening difficulties which had brought her to the brink of starvation ; the degrading return to the man who had cruelly deceived her — all was explained , all was excused now ! With an infant at the breast , how could she obtain a new employment ? With famine staring her in the face , what else could the friendless woman do but return to the father of her child ? What claim had I on her , by comparison with him ? What did it matter , now that the poor creature secretly returned the love that I felt for her ? There was the child , an obstacle between us — there was his hold on her , now that he had got her back ! What was my hold worth ? All social proprieties and all social laws answered the question : Nothing ! My head sunk on my breast ; I received the blow in silence . My good mother took my hand . “
46373	46379	46382	46382	mother	805	” she said , sorrowfully . “
46388	46389	46382	46382	mother	805	” “
46578	46790	46807	46807	You	74	” So this scene in my life was , to all appearance , a scene closed forever . As it had been with my love , in the days of my boyhood , so it was again now with the love of my riper age ! Later in the day , when I had in some degree recovered my self - possession , I wrote to Mr. Van Brandt — as she had foreseen I should write!—to apologize for breaking my engagement to dine with him . Could I trust to a letter also , to say the farewell words for me to the woman whom I had loved and lost ? No ! It was better for her , and better for me , that I should not write . And yet the idea of leaving her in silence was more than my fortitude could endure . Her last words at parting ( as they were repeated to me by my mother ) had expressed the hope that I should not think hardly of her in the future . How could I assure her that I should think of her tenderly to the end of my life ? My mother ’s delicate tact and true sympathy showed me the way . “
46798	46802	46796	46796	George	74	” she said , “
46817	46863	46807	46807	You	74	” God knows I was not hard on the child ! I went out myself and bought her a toy . I brought it home , and before I sent it away , I pinned a slip of paper to it , bearing this inscription : “
46873	47142	46807	46807	You	74	” There is nothing very pathetic , I suppose , in those words . And yet I burst out crying when I had written them . The next morning my mother and I set forth for my country - house in Perthshire . London was now unendurable to me . Traveling abroad I had tried already . Nothing was left but to go back to the Highlands , and to try what I could make of my life , with my mother still left to live for . THERE is something repellent to me , even at this distance of time , in looking back at the dreary days , of seclusion which followed each other monotonously in my Highland home . The actions of my life , however trifling they may have been , I can find some interest in recalling : they associate me with my fellow - creatures ; they connect me , in some degree , with the vigorous movement of the world . But I have no sympathy with the purely selfish pleasure which some men appear to derive from dwelling on the minute anatomy of their own feelings , under the pressure of adverse fortune . Let the domestic record of our stagnant life in Perthshire ( so far as I am concerned in it ) be presented in my mother ’s words , not in mine . A few lines of extract from the daily journal which it was her habit to keep will tell all that need be told before this narrative advances to later dates and to newer scenes . “
47286	47520	47523	47523	George	74	“ 25th.—A long conversation about George with Mr. MacGlue . I have never liked this Scotch doctor since he encouraged my son to keep the fatal appointment at Saint Anthony ’s Well . But he seems to be a clever man in his profession — and I think , in his way , he means kindly toward George . His advice was given as coarsely as usual , and very positively at the same time . ‘ Nothing will cure your son , madam , of his amatory passion for that half - drowned lady of his but change — and another lady . Send him away by himself this time ; and let him feel the want of some kind creature to look after him . And when he meets with that kind creature ( they are as plenty as fish in the sea ) , never trouble your head about it if there ’s a flaw in her character . I have got a cracked tea - cup which has served me for twenty years . Marry him , ma’am , to the new one with the utmost speed and impetuosity which the law will permit . ’ I hate Mr. MacGlue ’s opinions — so coarse and so hard - hearted!—but I sadly fear that I must part with my son for a little while , for his own sake . “
47561	47742	47743	47743	30th.—I	1220	“ 29th.—I have always believed in special providences ; and I am now confirmed in my belief . This morning has brought with it a note from our good friend and neighbor at Belhelvie . Sir James is one of the commissioners for the Northern Lights . He is going in a Government vessel to inspect the lighthouses on the North of Scotland , and on the Orkney and Shetland Islands — and , having noticed how worn and ill my poor boy looks , he most kindly invites George to be his guest on the voyage . They will not be absent for more than two months ; and the sea ( as Sir James reminds me ) did wonders for George ’s health when he returned from India . I could wish for no better opportunity than this of trying what change of air and scene will do for him . However painfully I may feel the separation myself , I shall put a cheerful face on it ; and I shall urge George to accept the invitation . “
47775	47893	47771	47771	he	1221	“ 31st.—Another wakeful night . George must positively send his answer to Sir James to - day . I am determined to do my duty toward my son — he looks so dreadfully pale and ill this morning ! Besides , if something is not done to rouse him , how do I know that he may not end in going back to Mrs. Van Brandt after all ? From every point of view , I feel bound to insist on his accepting Sir James ’s invitation . I have only to be firm , and the thing is done . He has never yet disobeyed me , poor fellow . He will not disobey me now . “
48038	48070	48030	48030	God	93	“ 10th.—Very uneasy . No letter from George . Ah , how full of trouble this life is ! and how strange that we should cling to it as we do ! “
48131	48301	48319	48320	The guide	1238	“ 2d October.—Another letter . They are safe in the harbor of Lerwick , the chief port in the Shetland Islands . The weather has not latterly been at all favorable . But the amendment in George ’s health remains . He writes most gratefully of Sir James ’s unremitting kindness to him . I am so happy , I declare I could kiss Sir James — though he is a great man , and a Commissioner for Northern Lights ! In three weeks more ( wind and weather permitting ) they hope to get back . Never mind my lonely life here , if I can only see George happy and well again ! He tells me they have passed a great deal of their time on shore ; but not a word does he say about meeting any ladies . Perhaps they are scarce in those wild regions ? I have heard of Shetland shawls and Shetland ponies . Are there any Shetland ladies , I wonder ? ”
48302	48310	48319	48320	The guide	1238	“ I ca n’t say for certain . ”

51255	51270	51271	51271	I	0	“ Do you mean that you have brought us here without first asking leave ? ”
51298	51306	51307	51307	he	1238	“ That ’s just what I mean ! ”
51424	51436	51407	51407	he	1397	“ I bid you welcome , gentlemen , to my house . ”
51472	51484	51485	51485	he	1397	“ I happened to send for my servant a minute since , ”
51488	51524	51525	51525	he	1397	“ and I only then heard that you were here . It is a custom of the house that nobody interrupts me over my books . Be pleased , sir , to accept my excuses , ”
51533	51602	51525	51525	he	1397	“ for not having sooner placed myself and my household at your disposal . You have met , as I am sorry to hear , with an accident . Will you permit me to send for medical help ? I ask the question a little abruptly , fearing that time may be of importance , and knowing that our nearest doctor lives at some distance from this house . ”
51855	51866	51867	51867	he	1397	“ We are so used here to our Shetland hospitality , ”
51870	52023	51867	51867	he	1397	“ that we are slow to understand the hesitation which a stranger feels in taking advantage of it . Your guide is in no respect to blame , gentlemen . Every house in these islands which is large enough to contain a spare room has its Guests ’ Chamber , always kept ready for occupation . When you travel my way , you come here as a matter of course ; you stay here as long as you like ; and , when you go away , I only do my duty as a good Shetlander in accompanying you on the first stage of your journey to bid you godspeed . The customs of centuries past elsewhere are modern customs here . I beg of you to give my servant all the directions which are necessary to your comfort , just as freely as you could give them in your own house . ”
52062	52075	52077	52080	The Master of Books	3303	“ Strangers can not be expected to understand our ways , Andrew , ”
52082	52096	52077	52080	The Master of Books	3303	“ But you and I understand one another — and that is enough . ”
52219	52233	52235	52236	Mr. Dunross	122	“ You will move the medicine - chest into this room , Peter , ”
52238	52393	52235	52236	Mr. Dunross	122	“ And you will wait on this gentleman , who is confined to his bed by an accident , exactly as you would wait on me if I were ill . If we both happen to ring for you together , you will answer his bell before you answer mine . The usual changes of linen are , of course , ready in the wardrobe there ? Very good . Go now , and tell the cook to prepare a little dinner ; and get a bottle of the old Madeira out of the cellar . You will least , in this room . These two gentlemen will be best pleased to dine together . Return here in five minutes ’ time , in case you are wanted ; and show my guest , Peter , that I am right in believing you to be a good nurse as well as a good servant . ”
52583	52592	52593	52593	he	186	“ Is there anything else I can do , ”

52639	52706	52627	52627	He	186	“ This will be a dull life , I am afraid , sir , for you . If you happen to be fond of angling , I can offer you some little amusement in that way . The lake is well stocked with fish ; and I have a boy employed in the garden , who will be glad to attend on you in the boat . ”
52738	52902	52907	52907	he	1441	“ You may safely trust my man Peter to wait on you , Mr. Germaine , while you are so unfortunate as to be confined to this room . He has the advantage ( in cases of illness ) of being a very silent , undemonstrative person . At the same time he is careful and considerate , in his own reserved way . As to what I may term the lighter duties at your bedside such as reading to you , writing your letters for you while your right hand is still disabled , regulating the temperature in the room , and so on — though I can not speak positively , I think it likely that these little services may be rendered to you by another person whom I have not mentioned yet . We shall see what happens in a few hours ’ time . In the meanwhile , sir , I ask permission to leave you to your rest . ”

53871	53878	53879	53879	she	721	“ You have not been asleep , ”
53882	53900	53879	53879	she	721	“ for more than two hours . The mist has disappeared , and the sun is shining . ”

53936	53953	53984	53984	her	721	“ Yes — with your permission . I own I should like to see the sunlight . ”
53954	53963	53879	53879	she	721	“ I will send Peter to you immediately . ”
54001	54007	54008	54008	I	0	“ Pray do n’t go ! ”
54011	54040	54008	54008	I	0	“ I can not think of troubling you to take a trifling message for me . The servant will come in , if I only ring the bell . ”
54063	54086	54041	54041	She	721	“ Peter will not let in the daylight while I am in the room . He closed the curtains by my order . ”
54174	54181	54182	54182	I	0	“ Invalids only think of themselves , ”
54185	54199	54200	54200	She	721	“ I supposed that you had kindly darkened the room on my account . ”
54223	54246	54212	54212	she	721	“ You were mistaken , Mr. Germaine . Your room has been darkened — not on your account , but on mine . ”
54422	54435	54436	54436	she	721	“ If you wish to see much of me , Mr. Germaine , ”
54439	55090	54436	54436	she	721	“ you must accustom yourself to the world of shadows in which it is my lot to live . Some time since , a dreadful illness raged among the people in our part of this island ; and I was so unfortunate as to catch the infection . When I recovered — no ! ‘ Recovery ’ is not the right word to use — let me say , when I escaped death , I found myself afflicted by a nervous malady which has defied medical help from that time to this . I am suffering ( as the doctors explain it to me ) from a morbidly sensitive condition of the nerves near the surface to the action of light . If I were to draw the curtains , and look out of that window , I should feel the acutest pain all over my face . If I covered my face , and drew the curtains with my bare hands , I should feel the same pain in my hands . You can just see , perhaps , that I have a very large and very thick veil on my head . I let it fall over my face and neck and hands , when I have occasion to pass along the corridors or to enter my father ’s study — and I find it protection enough . Do n’t be too ready to deplore my sad condition , sir ! I have got so used to living in the dark that I can see quite well enough for all the purposes of my poor existence . I can read and write in these shadows — I can see you , and be of use to you in many little ways , if you will let me . There is really nothing to be distressed about . My life will not be a long one — I know and feel that . But I hope to be spared long enough to be my father ’s companion through the closing years of his life . Beyond that , I have no prospect . In the meanwhile , I have my pleasures ; and I mean to add to my scanty little stack the pleasure of attending on you . You are quite an event in my life . I look forward to reading to you and writing for you , as some girls look forward to a new dress , or a first ball . Do you think it very strange of me to tell you so openly just what I have in my mind ? I ca n’t help it ! I say what I think to my father and to our poor neighbors hereabouts — and I ca n’t alter my ways at a moment ’s notice . I own it when I like people ; and I own it when I do n’t . I have been looking at you while you were asleep ; and I have read your face as I might read a book . There are signs of sorrow on your forehead and your lips which it is strange to see in so young a face as yours . I am afraid I shall trouble you with many questions about yourself when we become better acquainted with each other . Let me begin with a question , in my capacity as nurse . Are your pillows comfortable ? I can see they want shaking up . Shall I send for Peter to raise you ? I am unhappily not strong enough to be able to help you in that way . No ? You are able to raise yourself ? Wait a little . There ! Now lie back — and tell me if I know how to establish the right sort of sympathy between a tumbled pillow and a weary head . ”
55218	55227	55228	55228	she	1483	“ You have been trying to see me , ”
55231	55255	55228	55228	she	1483	“ Has my hand warned you not to try again ? I felt that it startled you when you touched it just now . ”
55310	55318	55319	55319	she	1483	“ If we are to be friends , ”
55322	55494	55495	55495	she	1484	“ we must begin by understanding one another . Do n’t associate any romantic ideas of invisible beauty with me , Mr. Germaine . I had but one beauty to boast of before I fell ill — my complexion — and that has gone forever . There is nothing to see in me now but the poor reflection of my former self ; the ruin of what was once a woman . I do n’t say this to distress you — I say it to reconcile you to the darkness as a perpetual obstacle , so far as your eyes are concerned , between you and me . Make the best instead of the worst of your strange position here . It offers you a new sensation to amuse you while you are ill . You have a nurse who is an impersonal creature — a shadow among shadows ; a voice to speak to you , and a hand to help you , and nothing more . Enough of myself ! ”
55504	55513	55514	55514	She	1484	“ What can I do to amuse you ? ”
55519	55526	55527	55527	she	1484	“ I have some odd tastes , ”
55530	55563	55527	55527	she	1484	“ and I think I may entertain you if I make you acquainted with one of them . Are you like most other men , Mr. Germaine ? Do you hate cats ? ”
55590	55595	55596	55596	I	0	“ To my thinking , ”
55599	55700	55596	55596	I	0	“ the cat is a cruelly misunderstood creature — especially in England . Women , no doubt , generally do justice to the affectionate nature of cats . But the men treat them as if they were the natural enemies of the human race . The men drive a cat out of their presence if it ventures upstairs , and set their dogs at it if it shows itself in the street — and then they turn round and accuse the poor creature ( whose genial nature must attach itself to something ) of being only fond of the kitchen ! ”
55719	55731	55732	55732	she	127	“ We have one sympathy in common , at any rate , ”
55735	55747	55748	55748	She	127	“ Now I can amuse you ! Prepare for a surprise . ”
55778	55783	55785	55786	Miss Dunross	127	“ Move the screen , ”
55806	55841	55842	55842	she	127	“ Open the door of the cats ’ room , Peter ; and bring me my harp . Do n’t suppose that you are going to listen to a great player , Mr. Germaine , ”
55855	55950	55951	55951	She	127	“ or that you are likely to see the sort of harp to which you are accustomed , as a man of the modern time . I can only play some old Scotch airs ; and my harp is an ancient instrument ( with new strings)—an heirloom in our family , some centuries old . When you see my harp , you will think of pictures of St. Cecilia — and you will be treating my performance kindly if you will remember , at the sam e time , that I am no saint ! ”
56076	56088	56089	56089	she	127	“ You will have light enough to see the cats by , ”
56092	56131	56089	56089	she	127	“ without having too much light for me . Firelight does not give me the acute pain which I suffer when daylight falls on my face — I feel a certain inconvenience from it , and nothing more . ”
56479	56496	56497	56497	She	127	“ I am soon tired — I must leave my cats to conclude their performances tomorrow . ”
56505	56517	56518	56518	she	127	“ I leave you to see the sunset through your window , ”
56521	56852	56853	56853	She	1496	“ From the coming of the darkness to the coming of breakfast - time , you must not count on my services — I am taking my rest . I have no choice but to remain in bed ( sleeping when I can ) for twelve hours or more . The long repose seems to keep my life in me . Have I and my cats surprised you very much ? Am I a witch ; and are they my familiar spirits ? Remember how few amusements I have , and you will not wonder why I devote myself to teaching these pretty creatures their tricks , and attaching them to me like dogs ! They were slow at first , and they taught me excellent lessons of patience . Now they understand what I want of them , and they learn wonderfully well . How you will amuse your friend , when he comes back from fishing , with the story of the young lady who lives in the dark , and keeps a company of performing cats ! I shall expect you to amuse me to - morrow — I want you to tell me all about yourself , and how you came to visit these wild islands of ours . Perhaps , as the days go on , and we get better acquainted , you will take me a little more into your confidence , and tell me the true meaning of that story of sorrow which I read on your face while you were asleep ? I have just enough of the woman left in me to be the victim of curiosity , when I meet with a person who interests me . Good - by till to - morrow ! I wish you a tranquil night , and a pleasant waking.—Come , my familiar spirits ! Come , my cat children ! it ’s time we went back to our own side of the house . ”
57077	57088	57089	57089	he	3303	“ Do not hesitate to let her attend on you , ”
57092	57162	57089	57089	he	3303	“ Whatever interests or amuses her , lengthens her life . In her life is the breath of mine . She is more than my daughter ; she is the guardian - angel of the house . Go where she may , she carries the air of heaven with her . When you say your prayers , sir , pray God to leave my daughter here a little longer . ”
57206	57212	57213	57213	he	1505	“ I sleep next door , ”
57216	57223	57213	57213	he	1505	“ Ring when you want me . ”
57295	57323	57389	57389	she	127	“ I CONGRATULATE you , Mr. Germaine , on your power of painting in words . Your description gives me a vivid idea of Mrs. Van Brandt . ”
57324	57334	57389	57389	she	127	“ Does the portrait please you , Miss Dunross ? ”
57335	57344	57389	57389	she	127	“ May I speak as plainly as usual ? ”
57345	57348	57389	57389	she	127	“ Certainly ! ”
57349	57365	57389	57389	she	127	“ Well , then , plainly , I do n’t like your Mrs. Van Brandt . ”
57565	57574	57564	57564	she	127	“ carried the air of heaven with her . ”
57762	57771	57747	57748	a woman	237	written—“I do n’t like your Mrs. Van Brandt ! ”
57772	57776	57777	57777	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
57784	57794	57780	57780	She	127	“ Because you ought to love nobody but Mary . ”
57795	57811	57780	57780	She	127	“ But Mary has been lost to me since I was a boy of thirteen . ”
57812	57889	57890	57890	Her	1522	“ Be patient , and you will find her again . Mary is patient — Mary is waiting for you . When you meet her , you will be ashamed to remember that you ever loved Mrs. Van Brandt — you will look on your separation from that woman as the happiest event of your life . I may not live to hear of it — but you will live to own that I was right . ”
57912	57921	57922	57922	I	0	“ You seem to agree with Dame Dermody , ”
57925	57966	57922	57922	I	0	“ You believe that our two destinies are one . No matter what time may elapse , or what may happen in the time , you believe my marriage with Mary is still a marriage delayed , and nothing more ? ”
57967	57973	58014	58014	she	1522	“ I firmly believe it . ”
57974	57992	57993	57993	She	1522	“ Without knowing why — except that you dislike the idea of my marrying Mrs. Van Brandt ? ”
58022	58032	58033	58033	she	1522	“ Why do you call her Mrs. Van Brandt ? ”
58036	58064	58033	58033	she	1522	“ Mrs. Van Brandt is the namesake of your first love . If you are so fond of her , why do n’t you call her Mary ? ”
58108	58116	58117	58117	I	0	“ The man who has parted us , ”
58120	58156	58117	58117	I	0	“ called her Mary . I hate him with such a jealous hatred that he has even disgusted me with the name ! It lost all its charm for me when it passed his lips . ”
58186	58196	58197	58197	she	1522	“ How fond you must be of that woman ! ”
58200	58208	58197	58197	she	1522	“ Do you dream of her now ? ”
58209	58217	58172	58172	her	1522	“ I never dream of her now . ”
58218	58230	58172	58172	her	1522	“ Do you expect to see the apparition of her again ? ”
58231	58262	58172	58172	her	1522	“ It may be so — if a time comes when she is in sore need of help , and when she has no friend to look to but me . ”
58263	58275	58172	58172	her	1522	“ Did you ever see the apparition of your little Mary ? ”
58276	58279	58172	58172	her	1522	“ Never ! ”
58280	58297	58172	58172	her	1522	“ But you used once to see her — as Dame Dermody predicted — in dreams ? ”
58298	58307	58172	58172	her	1522	“ Yes — when I was a lad . ”
58308	58378	58172	58172	her	1522	“ And , in the after - time , it was not Mary , but Mrs. Van Brandt who came to you in dreams — who appeared to you in the spirit , when she was far away from you in the body ? Poor old Dame Dermody . She little thought , in her life - time , that her prediction would be fullfilled by the wrong woman ! ”
58451	58455	58456	58456	she	1524	“ Tell me , ”
58460	58486	58456	58456	she	1524	“ If you met with your little Mary now , what would she be like ? What sort of woman would you expect to see ? ”
58493	58499	58500	58500	I	0	“ How can I tell , ”
58503	58510	58500	58500	I	0	“ at this distance of time ? ”
58511	58514	58515	58515	she	1524	“ Try ! ”
58654	58663	58665	58666	Miss Dunross	127	“ I infinitely prefer your portrait of Mary , ”
58668	58764	58765	58765	She	127	“ to your portrait of Mrs. Van Brandt . Mary realizes my idea of what a really attractive woman ought to be . How you can have felt any sorrow for the loss of that other person ( I detest buxom women ! ) passes my understanding . I ca n’t tell you how interested I am in Mary ! I want to know more about her . Where is that pretty present of needle - work which the poor little thing embroidered for you so industriously ? Do let me see the green flag ! ”
58787	58806	58777	58777	I	0	“ I am sorry to disappoint you . The green flag is somewhere in my house in Perthshire . ”
58807	58816	58817	58817	she	127	“ You have not got it with you ? ”
58820	58869	58870	58870	She	127	“ You leave her keepsake lying about anywhere ? Oh , Mr. Germaine , you have indeed forgotten Mary ! A woman , in your place , would have parted with her life rather than part with the one memorial left of the time when she first loved ! ”
58892	58897	58898	58898	I	0	“ Dear Miss Dunross , ”
58901	58908	58898	58898	I	0	“ the flag is not lost . ”
58909	58915	58916	58916	she	127	“ I should hope not ! ”
58921	58948	58916	58916	she	127	“ If you lose the green flag , you lose the last relic of Mary — and more than that , if my belief is right . ”
58949	58955	58898	58898	I	0	“ What do you believe ? ”
58956	58988	58898	58898	I	0	“ You will laugh at me if I tell you . I am afraid my first reading of your face was wrong — I am afraid you are a hard man . ”
58989	59020	58916	58916	she	127	“ Indeed you do me an injustice . I entreat you to answer me as frankly as usual . What do I lose in losing the last relic of Mary ? ”
59021	59032	59033	59033	she	1530	“ You lose the one hope I have for you , ”
59036	59266	59033	59033	she	1530	gravely—“the hope of your meeting and your marriage with Mary in the time to come . I was sleepless last night , and I was thinking of your pretty love story by the banks of the bright English lake . The longer I thought , the more firmly I felt the conviction that the poor child ’s green flag is destined to have its innocent influence in forming your future life . Your happiness is waiting for you in that artless little keepsake ! I ca n’t explain or justify this belief of mine . It is one of my eccentricities , I suppose — like training my cats to perform to the music of my harp . But , if I were your old friend , instead of being only your friend of a few days , I would leave you no peace — I would beg and entreat and persist , as only a woman can persist — until I had made Mary ’s gift as close a companion of yours , as your mother ’s portrait in the locket there at your watch - chain . While the flag is with you , Mary ’s influence is with you ; Mary ’s love is still binding you by the dear old tie ; and Mary and you , after years of separation , will meet again ! ”
59323	59337	59338	59338	I	0	“ I will look for it the moment I am at home again , ”
59341	59356	59338	59338	I	0	“ and I will take care that it is carefully preserved for the future . ”
59357	59364	59365	59365	she	1533	“ I want more than that , ”
59368	59435	59365	59365	she	1533	“ If you ca n’t wear the flag about you , I want it always to be with you — to go wherever you go . When they brought your luggage here from the vessel at Lerwick , you were particularly anxious about the safety of your traveling writing - desk — the desk there on the table . Is there anything very valuable in it ? ”
59436	59490	59491	59492	Miss Dunross	127	“ It contains my money , and other things that I prize far more highly — my mother ’s letters , and some family relics which I should be very sorry to lose . Besides , the desk itself has its own familiar interest as my constant traveling companion of many years past . ”
59507	59518	59519	59519	she	127	“ Let Mary ’s flag be your constant traveling companion , ”
59522	59579	59519	59519	she	127	“ You have spoken far too gratefully of my services here as your nurse . Reward me beyond my deserts . Make allowances , Mr. Germaine , for the superstitious fancies of a lonely , dreamy woman . Promise me that the green flag shall take its place among the other little treasures in your desk ! ”
61200	61208	61209	61209	she	127	“ It ’s not Peter ’s fault , ”
61212	61231	61209	61209	she	127	“ I told him not to hurry your return to the house . Have you enjoyed your walk ? ”

61394	61418	61356	61356	I	0	“ No , thank you . I shall do very well here . I see you are kindly ready to write for me . ”
61419	61422	61423	61423	she	127	“ Yes , ”
61426	61442	61423	61423	she	127	“ at your own convenience . When you are ready , my pen is ready . ”

61687	61690	61691	61691	I	0	“ Suffering ? ”
61694	61700	61691	61691	I	0	“ Her letters say nothing — ”
61701	61714	61715	61716	Miss Dunross	127	“ You forget that you have allowed me to read her letters , ”
61719	61803	61715	61716	Miss Dunross	127	“ I see the unwritten and unconscious confession of anxiety in every line that she writes to you . You know , as well as I do , that there is cause for her anxiety . Make her happy by telling her that you sail for home with your friends . Make her happier still by telling her that you grieve no more over the loss of Mrs. Van Brandt . May I write it , in your name and in those words ? ”
61872	61881	61882	61882	I	0	“ We have plenty of time before us , ”

My education , as I have told you , has been the education of a medical man . I am well acquainted with some of the greatest living physicians , in Edinburgh as well as in London . Will you allow me to describe your malady ( as I understand it ) to men who are accustomed to treat cases of intricate nervous disorder ? And will you let me write and tell you the result ? ”
62093	62108	62109	62109	I	0	“ In any case , I may find it necessary to write to you , ”
62113	62147	62109	62109	I	0	“ You firmly believe that I and my little Mary are destined to meet again . If your anticipations are realized , you will expect me to tell you of it , surely ? ”

62730	62769	62727	62727	she	127	“ that your infatuation for Mrs. Van Brandt is at an end . Will you put it in your own words ? Or shall I write it for you , imitating your language as well as I can ? ”
62791	62825	62785	62785	I	0	“ If I say No , she will only return to the subject again , and she will end ( after all I owe to her kindness ) in making me say Yes . ”

64208	64232	64205	64205	She	127	“ I have been filled with a deadly fear . I have seen nothing but the writing - case lifted from my lap . ”
64233	64243	64168	64168	she	127	“ Did you see the hand that lifted it ? ”
64244	64247	64168	64168	she	127	“ No . ”
64248	64263	64205	64205	She	127	“ Did you see a starry light , and a figure standing in it ? ”
64264	64267	64168	64168	she	127	“ No . ”
64268	64284	64168	64168	she	127	“ Did you see the writing - case after it was lifted from your lap ? ”
64285	64294	64205	64205	She	127	“ I saw it resting on my shoulder . ”
64295	64310	64168	64168	she	127	“ Did you see writing on the letter , which was not your writing ? ”
64311	64329	64168	64168	she	127	“ I saw a darker shadow on the paper than the shadow in which I am sitting . ”
64330	64335	64205	64205	She	127	“ Did it move ? ”
64336	64343	64168	64168	she	127	“ It moved across the paper . ”
64344	64352	64168	64168	she	127	“ As a pen moves in writing ? ”
64353	64363	64168	64168	she	127	“ Yes . As a pen moves in writing . ”
64364	64371	64168	64168	she	127	“ May I take the letter ? ”
64378	64385	64372	64372	She	127	“ May I light a candle ? ”
64579	64587	64568	64569	a man	2326	“ Remember me . Come to me ; ”
64595	64610	64568	64569	a man	2326	“ At the month ’s end , In the shadow of Saint Paul ’s . ”
64767	64771	64753	64753	My	0	“ Saint Paul ’s ”
65082	65090	65091	65091	she	1634	“ Do you wish to see Peter ? ”
65094	65106	65091	65091	she	1634	“ No . I wish to know where Miss Dunross is . ”
65107	65123	65124	65124	I	0	“ Miss Dunross is in her room . She has sent me with this letter . ”
65162	65170	65171	65171	I	0	“ Are you Miss Dunross ’s maid ? ”
65174	65184	65171	65171	I	0	“ I have served Miss Dunross for many years , ”
65193	65211	65171	65171	I	0	“ Do you think she would receive me if I sent you with a message to her ? ”
65212	65235	65236	65236	We	1638	“ I ca n’t say , sir . The letter may tell you . You will do well to read the letter . ”
65333	65392	65396	65396	you	1644	“ I write , instead of speaking to you , because my self - control has already been severely tried , and I am not strong enough to bear more . For my father ’s sake — not for my own — I must take all the care I can of the little health that I have left . “
65603	65626	65582	65582	I	0	“ Having written so far , I leave the subject — not to return to it , except in my own thoughts . “
65678	65797	65671	65671	I	0	“ The little services which you have allowed me to render you have brightened the closing days of my life . You have left me a treasury of happy memories which I shall hoard , when you are gone , with miserly care . Are you willing to add new claims to my grateful remembrance ? I ask it of you , as a last favor — do not attempt to see me again ! Do not expect me to take a personal leave of you ! The saddest of all words is ‘ Good - by ’ : I have fortitude enough to write it , and no more . God preserve and prosper you — farewell ! “
65877	65981	65855	65855	you	1653	” To say that these melancholy lines brought the tears into my eyes is only to acknowledge that I had sympathies which could be touched . When I had in some degree recovered my composure , the impulse which urged me to write to Miss Dunross was too strong to be resisted . I did not trouble her with a long letter ; I only entreated her to reconsider her decision with all the art of persuasion which I could summon to help me . The answer was brought back by the servant who waited on Miss Dunross , in four resolute words : “
65987	65999	65855	65855	you	1653	” This time the woman spoke out before she left me . “
66009	66014	65855	65855	you	1653	” she said sternly , “
66024	66198	66199	66202	The Master of Books	3303	” She looked at me with a last lowering frown , and left the room . It is needless to say that the faithful servant ’s words only increased my anxiety to see Miss Dunross once more before we parted — perhaps forever . My one last hope of success in attaining this object lay in approaching her indirectly through the intercession of her father . I sent Peter to inquire if I might be permitted to pay my respects to his master that evening . My messenger returned with an answer that was a new disappointment to me . Mr. Dunross begged that I would excuse him , if he deferred the proposed interview until the next morning . The next morning was the morning of my departure . Did the message mean that he had no wish to see me again until the time had come to take leave of him ? I inquired of Peter whether his master was particularly occupied that evening . He was unable to tell me . “
66203	66806	66199	66202	The Master of Books	3303	” was not in his study , as usual . When he sent his message to me , he was sitting by the sofa in his daughter ’s room . Having answered in those terms , the man left me by myself until the next morning . I do not wish my bitterest enemy a sadder time in his life than the time I passed during the last night of my residence under Mr. Dunross ’s roof . After walking to and fro in the room until I was weary , I thought of trying to divert my mind from the sad thoughts that oppressed it by reading . The one candle which I had lighted failed to sufficiently illuminate the room . Advancing to the mantel - piece to light the second candle which stood there , I noticed the unfinished letter to my mother lying where I had placed it , when Miss Dunross ’s servant first presented herself before me . Having lighted the second candle , I took up the letter to put it away among my other papers . Doing this ( while my thoughts were still dwelling on Miss Dunross ) , I mechanically looked at the letter again — and instantly discovered a change in it . The written characters traced by the hand of the apparition had vanished ! Below the last lines written by Miss Dunross nothing met my eyes now but the blank white paper ! My first impulse was to look at my watch . When the ghostly presence had written in my sketch - book , the characters had disappeared after an interval of three hours . On this occasion , as nearly as I could calculate , the writing had vanished in one hour only . Reverting to the conversation which I had held with Mrs. Van Brandt when we met at Saint Anthony ’s Well , and to the discoveries which followed at a later period of my life , I can only repeat that she had again been the subject of a trance or dream , when the apparition of her showed itself to me for the second time . As before , she had freely trusted me and freely appealed to me to help her , in the dreaming state , when her spirit was free to recognize my spirit . When she had come to herself , after an interval of an hour , she had again felt ashamed of the familiar manner in which she had communicated with me in the trance — had again unconsciously counteracted by her waking - will the influence of her sleeping - will ; and had thus caused the writing once more to disappear , in an hour from the moment when the pen had traced ( or seemed to trace ) it . This is still the one explanation that I can offer . At the time when the incident happened , I was far from being fully admitted to the confidence of Mrs. Van Brandt ; and I was necessarily incapable of arriving at any solution of the mystery , right or wrong . I could only put away the letter , doubting vaguely whether my own senses had not deceived me . After the distressing thoughts which Miss Dunross ’s letter had roused in my mind , I was in no humor to employ my ingenuity in finding a clew to the mystery of the vanished writing . My nerves were irritated ; I felt a sense of angry discontent with myself and with others . “
66811	66818	66199	66202	The Master of Books	3303	” ( I thought impatiently ) , “
66837	68301	68302	68302	God	93	” As I still paced backward and forward in my room — it was useless to think now of fixing my attention on a book — I fancied I understood the motives which made men as young as I was retire to end their lives in a monastery . I drew aside the window curtains , and looked out . The only prospect that met my view was the black gulf of darkness in which the lake lay hidden . I could see nothing ; I could do nothing ; I could think of nothing . The one alternative before me was that of trying to sleep . My medical knowledge told me plainly that natural sleep was , in my nervous condition , one of the unattainable luxuries of life for that night . The medicine - chest which Mr. Dunross had placed at my disposal remained in the room . I mixed for myself a strong sleeping draught , and sullenly took refuge from my troubles in bed . It is a peculiarity of most of the soporific drugs that they not only act in a totally different manner on different constitutions , but that they are not even to be depended on to act always in the same manner on the same person . I had taken care to extinguish the candles before I got into my bed . Under ordinary circumstances , after I had lain quietly in the darkness for half an hour , the draught that I had taken would have sent me to sleep . In the present state of my nerves the draught stupefied me , and did no more . Hour after hour I lay perfectly still , with my eyes closed , in the semi - sleeping , semi - wakeful state which is so curiously characteristic of the ordinary repose of a dog . As the night wore on , such a sense of heaviness oppressed my eyelids that it was literally impossible for me to open them — such a masterful languor possessed all my muscles that I could no more move on my pillow than if I had been a corpse . And yet , in this somnolent condition , my mind was able to pursue lazy trains of pleasant thought . My sense of hearing was so acute that it caught the faintest sounds made by the passage of the night - breeze through the rushes of the lake . Inside my bed - chamber , I was even more keenly sensible of those weird night - noises in the heavy furniture of a room , of those sudden settlements of extinct coals in the grate , so familiar to bad sleepers , so startling to overwrought nerves ! It is not a scientifically correct statement , but it exactly describes my condition , that night , to say that one half of me was asleep and the other half awake . How many hours of the night had passed , when my irritable sense of hearing became aware of a new sound in the room , I can not tell . I can only relate that I found myself on a sudden listening intently , with fast - closed eyes . The sound that disturbed me was the faintest sound imaginable , as of something soft and light traveling slowly over the surface of the carpet , and brushing it just loud enough to be heard . Little by little , the sound came nearer and nearer to my bed — and then suddenly stopped just as I fancied it was close by me . I still lay immovable , with closed eyes ; drowsily waiting for the next sound that might reach my ears ; drowsily content with the silence , if the silence continued . My thoughts ( if thoughts they could be called ) were drifting back again into their former course , when I became suddenly conscious of soft breathing just above me . The next moment I felt a touch on my forehead — light , soft , tremulous , like the touch of lips that had kissed me . There was a momentary pause . Then a low sigh trembled through the silence . Then I heard again the still , small sound of something brushing its way over the carpet ; traveling this time from my bed , and moving so rapidly that in a moment more it was lost in the silence of the night . Still stupefied by the drug that I had taken , I could lazily wonder what had happened , and I could do no more . Had living lips really touched me ? Was the sound that I had heard really the sound of a sigh ? Or was it all delusion , beginning and ending in a dream ? The time passed without my deciding , or caring to decide , those questions . Minute by minute , the composing influence of the draught began at last to strengthen its hold on my brain . A cloud seemed to pass softly over my last waking impressions . One after another , the ties broke gently that held me to conscious life . I drifted peacefully into perfect sleep . Shortly after sunrise , I awoke . When I regained the use of my memory , my first clear recollection was the recollection of the soft breathing which I had felt above me — then of the touch on my forehead , and of the sigh which I had heard after it . Was it possible that some one had entered my room in the night ? It was quite possible . I had not locked the door — I had never been in the habit of locking the door during my residence under Mr. Dunross ’s roof . After thinking it over a little , I rose to examine my room . Nothing in the shape of a discovery rewarded me , until I reached the door . Though I had not locked it overnight , I had certainly satisfied myself that it was closed before I went to bed . It was now ajar . Had it opened again , through being imperfectly shut ? or had a person , after entering and leaving my room , forgotten to close it ? Accidentally looking downward while I was weighing these probabilities , I noticed a small black object on the carpet , lying just under the key , on the inner side of the door . I picked the thing up , and found that it was a torn morsel of black lace . The instant I saw the fragment , I was reminded of the long black veil , hanging below her waist , which it was the habit of Miss Dunross to wear . Was it her dress , then , that I had heard softly traveling over the carpet ; her kiss that had touched my forehead ; her sigh that had trembled through the silence ? Had the ill - fated and noble creature taken her last leave of me in the dead of night , trusting the preservation of her secret to the deceitful appearances which persuaded her that I was asleep ? I looked again at the fragment of black lace . Her long veil might easily have been caught , and torn , by the projecting key , as she passed rapidly through the door on her way out of my room . Sadly and reverently I laid the morsel of lace among the treasured memorials which I had brought with me from home . To the end of her life , I vowed it , she should be left undisturbed in the belief that her secret was safe in her own breast ! Ardently as I still longed to take her hand at parting , I now resolved to make no further effort to see her . I might not be master of my own emotions ; something in my face or in my manner might betray me to her quick and delicate perception . Knowing what I now knew , the last sacrifice I could make to her would be to obey her wishes . I made the sacrifice . In an hour more Peter informed me that the ponies were at the door , and that the Master was waiting for me in the outer hall . I noticed that Mr. Dunross gave me his hand , without looking at me . His faded blue eyes , during the few minutes while we were together , were not once raised from the ground . “
68317	68321	68302	68302	God	93	” he said . “
68358	68517	68521	68521	your	1663	” He was scrupulously , almost painfully , courteous ; but there was something in his manner which , for the first time in my experience , seemed designedly to keep me at a distance from him . Knowing the intimate sympathy , the perfect confidence , which existed between the father and daughter , a doubt crossed my mind whether the secret of the past night was entirely a secret to Mr. Dunross . His next words set that doubt at rest , and showed me the truth . In thanking him for his good wishes , I attempted also to express to him ( and through him to Miss Dunross ) my sincere sense of gratitude for the kindness which I had received under his roof . He stopped me , politely and resolutely , speaking with that quaintly precise choice of language which I h ad remarked as characteristic of him at our first interview . “
68526	68530	68521	68521	your	1663	” he said , “
68641	68679	68633	68633	I	0	” A faint color flushed his pale cheeks . He waited , with a certain proud resignation , for my reply . I respected her secret , respected it more resolutely than ever , before her father . “
68690	68694	68695	68695	your	0	” I answered , “
68701	68921	68922	68922	You	1672	” Saying that , and saying no more , I bowed to him with marked respect , and left the house . Mounting my pony at the door , I looked up at the center window , as she had bidden me . It was open ; but dark curtains , jealously closed , kept out the light from the room within . At the sound of the pony ’s hoofs on the rough island road , as the animal moved , the curtains were parted for a few inches only . Through the gap in the dark draperies a wan white hand appeared ; waved tremulously a last farewell ; and vanished from my view . The curtains closed again on her dark and solitary life . The dreary wind sounded its long , low dirge over the rippling waters of the lake . The ponies took their places in the ferryboat which was kept for the passage of animals to and from the island . With slow , regular strokes the men rowed us to the mainland and took their leave . I looked back at the distant house . I thought of her in the dark room , waiting patiently for death . Burning tears blinded me . The guide took my bridle in his hand : “
68929	68933	68927	68927	sir	2230	” he said ; “
68940	69256	68922	68922	You	1672	” When I looked again at the landscape round me , we had descended in the interval from the higher ground to the lower . The house and the lake had disappeared , to be seen no more . I had left her for my sea - voyage very unwillingly — seeing that she was in delicate health . On my return , I was grieved to observe a change for the worse , for which her letters had not prepared me . Consulting our medical friend , Mr. MacGlue , I found that he , too , had noticed my mother ’s failing health , but that he attributed it to an easily removable cause — to the climate of Scotland . My mother ’s childhood and early life had been passed on the southern shores of England . The change to the raw , keen air of the North had been a trying change to a person at her age . In Mr. MacGlue ’s opinion , the wise course to take would be to return to the South before the autumn was further advanced , and to make our arrangements for passing the coming winter at Penzance or Torquay . Resolved as I was to keep the mysterious appointment which summoned me to London at the month ’s end , Mr. MacGlue ’s suggestion met with no opposition on my part . It had , to my mind , the great merit of obviating the necessity of a second separation from my mother — assuming that she approved of the doctor ’s advice . I put the question to her the same day . To my infinite relief , she was not only ready , but eager to take the journey to the South . The season had been unusually wet , even for Scotland ; and my mother reluctantly confessed that she “
69262	69490	68927	68927	sir	2230	” for the mild air and genial sunshine of the Devonshire coast . We arranged to travel in our own comfortable carriage by post — resting , of course , at inns on the road at night . In the days before railways it was no easy matter for an invalid to travel from Perthshire to London — even with a light carriage and four horses . Calculating our rate of progress from the date of our departure , I found that we had just time , and no more , to reach London on the last day of the month . I shall say nothing of the secret anxieties which weighed on my mind , under these circumstances . Happily for me , on every account , my mother ’s strength held out . The easy and ( as we then thought ) the rapid rate of traveling had its invigorating effect on her nerves . She slept better when we rested for the night than she had slept at home . After twice being delayed on the road , we arrived in London at three o’clock on the afternoon of the last day of the month . Had I reached my destination in time ? As I interpreted the writing of the apparition , I had still some hours at my disposal . The phrase , “
69497	69523	68927	68927	sir	2230	” meant , as I understood it , at the last hour of the last day in the month . If I took up my position “
69532	69940	68927	68927	sir	2230	” say , at ten that night , I should arrive at the place of meeting with two hours to spare , before the last stroke of the clock marked the beginning of the new month . At half - past nine , I left my mother to rest after her long journey , and privately quit the house . Before ten , I was at my post . The night was fine and clear ; and the huge shadow of the cathedral marked distinctly the limits within which I had been bid to wait , on the watch for events . The great clock of Saint Paul ’s struck ten — and nothing happened . The next hour passed very slowly . I walked up and down ; at one time absorbed in my own thoughts ; at another , engaged in watching the gradual diminution in the number of foot passengers who passed me as the night advanced . The City ( as it is called ) is the most populous part of London in the daytime ; but at night , when it ceases to be the center of commerce , its busy population melts away , and the empty streets assume the appearance of a remote and deserted quarter of the metropolis . As the half hour after ten struck — then the quarter to eleven — then the hour — the pavement steadily became more and more deserted . I could count the foot passengers now by twos and threes ; and I could see the places of public refreshment within my view beginning already to close for the night . I looked at the clock ; it pointed to ten minutes past eleven . At that hour , could I hope to meet Mrs. Van Brandt alone in the public street ? The more I thought of it , the less likely such an event seemed to be . The more reasonable probability was that I might meet her once more , accompanied by some friend — perhaps under the escort of Van Brandt himself . I wondered whether I should preserve my self - control , in the presence of that man , for the second time . While my thoughts were still pursuing this direction , my attention was recalled to passing events by a sad little voice , putting a strange little question , close at my side . “
69965	69994	69948	69948	you	1674	” I looked round , and discovered a poorly clad little boy , with a basket over his arm , and a morsel of paper in his hand . “
70003	70007	69948	69948	you	1674	” I said . “
70022	70023	70024	70024	I	0	” “
70031	70037	70024	70024	I	0	” replied the small stranger . “
70069	70107	70063	70063	somebody	793	” The little creature looked at me under the street lamp with such a forlorn experience of being beaten for trifling offenses in his face , that it was impossible to resist the impulse to help him . “
70116	70120	70121	70121	I	0	” I asked . “
70128	70129	70121	70121	I	0	” “
70138	70147	70133	70134	a doctor	1685	” He held out his morsel of paper . “
70153	70228	70229	70230	Mrs. Brand	130	” he said . I took the paper from him , and looked at it . It was an ordinary prescription for a tonic mixture . I looked first at the doctor ’s signature ; it was the name of a perfectly obscure person in the profession . Below it was written the name of the patient for whom the medicine had been prescribed . I started as I read it . The name was “
70232	70259	70229	70230	Mrs. Brand	130	” The idea instantly struck me that this ( so far as sound went , at any rate ) was the English equivalent of Van Brandt . “
70272	70276	70280	70280	sir	2230	” I asked . “
70372	70392	70397	70398	my man	3349	” Here my little friend ’s sense of his unmerited misfortunes overpowered him , and he began to cry . “
70400	70404	70397	70398	my man	3349	” I said ; “
70423	70424	70425	70425	She	1686	” “
70436	70461	70425	70425	She	1686	” My heart quickened its beat . The boy ’s answer reminded me of that other little girl whom my mother had once seen . “
70470	70475	70463	70464	the lady	2202	” I asked next . “
70501	70509	70494	70494	he	1697	” I put a last conclusive question . “
70516	70520	70521	70521	Mother	805	” I inquired . “
70528	70554	70555	70556	Mrs. Brand”—poor	132	” the boy answered . I turned away to hide my agitation . Even the child might have noticed it ! Passing under the name of “
70556	70692	70555	70556	Mrs. Brand”—poor	132	Brand”—poor , so poor that she was obliged to pawn her ring — left , by a man who was a foreigner , alone with her little girl — was I on the trace of her at that moment ? Was this lost child destined to be the innocent means of leading me back to the woman I loved , in her direst need of sympathy and help ? The more I thought of it , the more strongly the idea of returning with the boy to the house in which his mother ’s lodger lived fastened itself on my mind . The clock struck the quarter past eleven . If my anticipations ended in misleading me , I had still three - quarters of an hour to spare before the month reached its end . “
70698	70864	70555	70556	Mrs. Brand”—poor	132	” I asked . The boy mentioned a street , the name of which I then heard for the first time . All he could say , when I asked for further particulars , was that he lived close by the river — in which direction , he was too confused and too frightened to be able to tell me . While we were still trying to understand each other , a cab passed slowly at some little distance . I hailed the man , and mentioned the name of the street to him . He knew it perfectly well . The street was rather more than a mile away from us , in an easterly direction . He undertook to drive me there and to bring me back again to Saint Paul ’s ( if necessary ) , in less than twenty minutes . I opened the door of the cab , and told my little friend to get in . The boy hesitated . “
70879	70883	70555	70556	Mrs. Brand”—poor	132	” he asked . “
70895	70903	70886	70886	You	1706	” The boy began to cry again . “
70919	70920	70921	70921	I	0	” “
70952	70983	70940	70940	I	0	” The announcement of my profession appeared to inspire the boy with a certain confidence . But he still showed no disposition to accompany me to his mother ’s house . “
70993	70997	70985	70985	you	1706	” he asked . “
71022	71023	71010	71010	Mother	805	” “
71033	71045	71024	71024	I	0	” I answered . The boy instantly got into the cab . “
71049	71053	71024	71024	I	0	” he said , “
71062	71265	71057	71057	mother	805	” Alas for the poor ! The child ’s education in the sordid anxieties of life was completed already at ten years old ! We drove away . THE poverty - stricken aspect of the street when we entered it , the dirty and dilapidated condition of the house when we drew up at the door , would have warned most men , in my position , to prepare themselves for a distressing discovery when they were admitted to the interior of the dwelling . The first impression which the place produced on my mind suggested , on the contrary , that the boy ’s answers to my questions had led me astray . It was simply impossible to associate Mrs. Van Brandt ( as I remembered her ) with the spectacle of such squalid poverty as I now beheld . I rang the door - bell , feeling persuaded beforehand that my inquiries would lead to no useful result . As I lifted my hand to the bell , my little companion ’s dread of a beating revived in full force . He hid himself behind me ; and when I asked what he was about , he answered , confidentially : “
71279	71313	71274	71274	mother	805	” A tall and truculent woman answered the bell . No introduction was necessary . Holding a cane in her hand , she stood self - proclaimed as my small friend ’s mother . “
71326	71340	71341	71341	He	1723	” she explained , as an apology for the exhibition of the cane . “
71362	71377	71378	71378	I	0	” I interceded for the unfortunate boy before I entered on my own business . “
71389	71393	71381	71381	you	0	” I said . “
71409	71461	71462	71462	You	0	” The woman ’s astonishment when she heard what I had done , and discovered her son behind me , literally struck her dumb . The language of the eye , superseding on this occasion the language of the tongue , plainly revealed the impression that I had produced on her : “
71479	71480	71472	71473	Mr. Stranger	133	” “
71495	71500	71489	71489	Brand	130	” I went on . “
71548	71558	71559	71560	My lodger	1735	” The woman recovered the use of her tongue . “
71580	71609	71566	71568	that little fool	1736	” She emphasized those words by shaking her brawny fist at her son — who instantly returned to his place of refuge behind the tail of my coat . “
71616	71631	71611	71611	you	0	” inquired the terrible person , shouting at her hidden offspring over my shoulder . “
71646	71688	71611	71611	you	0	” The boy showed himself again , and put the money into his mother ’s knotty hand . She counted it , with eyes which satisfied themselves fiercely that each coin was of genuine silver — and then became partially pacified . “
71693	71701	71611	71611	you	0	” she growled , addressing her son ; “
71722	71731	71717	71717	she	2202	” the woman proceeded , turning to me . “
71823	71981	71982	71983	Mrs. Brand	130	” I listened to the woman , still feeling persuaded that I had acted under a delusion in going to her house . How was it possible to associate the charming object of my heart ’s worship with the miserable story of destitution which I had just heard ? I stopped the boy on the first landing , and told him to announce me simply as a doctor , who had been informed of Mrs. Brand ’s illness , and who had called to see her . We ascended a second flight of stairs , and a third . Arrived now at the top of the house , the boy knocked at the door that was nearest to us on the landing . No audible voice replied . He opened the door without ceremony , and went in . I waited outside to hear what was said . The door was left ajar . If the voice of “
71984	72024	71982	71983	Mrs. Brand	130	” was ( as I believed it would prove to be ) the voice of a stranger , I resolved to offer her delicately such help as lay within my power , and to return forthwith to my post under “
72032	72048	71982	71983	Mrs. Brand	130	” The first voice that spoke to the boy was the voice of a child . “
72060	72061	72056	72056	I’m	0	” “
72074	72075	72067	72067	I’ve	0	” “
72084	72102	72067	72067	I’ve	0	” There was a momentary pause ; and then I heard the boy ’s voice once more . “
72155	72176	72153	72153	ma’am	2244	” I could barely hear the answering voice — it was so faint ; and it uttered but one word : “
72179	72185	72153	72153	ma’am	2244	” The boy spoke again . “
72201	72220	72153	72153	ma’am	2244	” This time there was no audible reply . The boy showed himself to me at the door . “
72236	72595	72228	72228	I	0	” It would have been misplaced delicacy to have hesitated any longer to enter the room . I went in . There , at the opposite end of a miserably furnished bed - chamber , lying back feebly in a tattered old arm - chair , was one more among the thousands of forlorn creatures , starving that night in the great city . A white handkerchief was laid over her face as if to screen it from the flame of the fire hard by . She lifted the handkerchief , startled by the sound of my footsteps as I entered the room . I looked at her , and saw in the white , wan , death - like face the face of the woman I loved ! For a moment the horror of the discovery turned me faint and giddy . In another instant I was kneeling by her chair . My arm was round her — her head lay on my shoulder . She was past speaking , past crying out : she trembled silently , and that was all . I said nothing . No words passed my lips , no tears came to my relief . I held her to me ; and she let me hold her . The child , devouring its bread - and - butter at a little round table , stared at us . The boy , on his knees before the grate , mending the fire , stared at us . And the slow minutes lagged on ; and the buzzing of a fly in a corner was the only sound in the room . The instincts of the profession to which I had been trained , rather than any active sense of the horror of the situation in which I was placed , roused me at last . She was starving ! I saw it in the deadly color of her skin ; I felt it in the faint , quick flutter of her pulse . I called the boy to me , and sent him to the nearest public - house for wine and biscuits . “
72601	72605	72228	72228	I	0	” I said ; “
72622	72639	72228	72228	I	0	” The boy looked at me , spit on the coins in his hand , said , “
72645	72679	72228	72228	I	0	” and ran out of the room as never boy ran yet . I turned to speak my first words of comfort to the mother . The cry of the child stopped me . “
72690	72712	72685	72685	I	0	” I set more food before the famished child and kissed her . She looked up at me with wondering eyes . “
72719	72725	72714	72714	you	0	” the little creature asked . “
72733	72764	72714	72714	you	0	” I looked at the mother . Her eyes were closed ; the tears flowed slowly over her worn , white cheeks . I took her frail hand in mine . “
72770	72774	72714	72714	you	0	” I said ; “
72781	72928	72775	72775	you	0	” There was no answer . She still trembled silently , and that was all . In less than five minutes the boy returned , and earned his promised reward . He sat on the floor by the fire counting his treasure , the one happy creature in the room . I soaked some crumbled morsels of biscuit in the wine , and , little by little , I revived her failing strength by nourishment administered at intervals in that cautious form . After a while she raised her head , and looked at me with wondering eyes that were pitiably like the eyes of her child . A faint , delicate flush began to show itself in her face . She spoke to me , for the first time , in whispering tones that I could just hear as I sat close at her side . “
72944	72980	72931	72931	you	1757	” She paused ; painfully recalling the memory of something that was slow to come back . Her color deepened ; she found the lost remembrance , and looked at me with a timid curiosity . “
72986	72990	72931	72931	you	1757	” she asked . “
72996	72997	72993	72993	my	0	” “
73014	73667	73668	73668	You	1760	” I lifted her gently , and laid her on the wretched bed . The child followed us , and climbing to the bedstead with my help , nestled at her mother ’s side . I sent the boy away to tell the mistress of the house that I should remain with my patient , watching her progress toward recovery , through the night . He went out , jingling his money joyfully in his pocket . We three were left together . As the long hours followed each other , she fell at intervals into a broken sleep ; waking with a start , and looking at me wildly as if I had been a stranger at her bedside . Toward morning the nourishment which I still carefully administered wrought its healthful change in her pulse , and composed her to quieter slumbers . When the sun rose she was sleeping as peacefully as the child at her side . I was able to leave her , until my return later in the day , under the care of the woman of the house . The magic of money transformed this termagant and terrible person into a docile and attentive nurse — so eager to follow my instructions exactly that she begged me to commit them to writing before I went away . For a moment I still lingered alone at the bedside of the sleeping woman , and satisfied myself for the hundredth time that her life was safe , before I left her . It was the sweetest of all rewards to feel sure of this — to touch her cool forehead lightly with my lips — to look , and look again , at the poor worn face , always dear , always beautiful , to my eyes . change as it might . I closed the door softly and went out in the bright morning , a happy man again . So close together rise the springs of joy and sorrow in human life ! So near in our heart , as in our heaven , is the brightest sunshine to the blackest cloud ! I REACHED my own house in time to snatch two or three hours of repose , before I paid my customary morning visit to my mother in her own room . I observed , in her reception of me on this occasion , certain peculiarities of look and manner which were far from being familiar in my experience of her . When our eyes first met , she regarded me with a wistful , questioning look , as if she were troubled by some doubt which she shrunk from expressing in words . And when I inquired after her health , as usual , she surprised me by answering as impatiently as if she resented my having mentioned the subject . For a moment , I was inclined to think these changes signified that she had discovered my absence from home during the night , and that she had some suspicion of the true cause of it . But she never alluded , even in the most distant manner , to Mrs. Van Brandt ; and not a word dropped from her lips which implied , directly or indirectly , that I had pained or disappointed her . I could only conclude that she had something important to say in relation to herself or to me — and that for reasons of her own she unwillingly abstained from giving expression to it at that time . Reverting to our ordinary topics of conversation , we touched on the subject ( always interesting to my mother ) of my visit to Shetland . Speaking of this , we naturally spoke also of Miss Dunross . Here , again , when I least expected it , there was another surprise in store for me . “
73675	73680	73668	73668	You	1760	” said my mother , “
73709	73710	73701	73701	you	1760	” “
73713	73714	73701	73701	you	1760	” “

73758	73763	73741	73741	I	0	” My mother smiled . “
73809	73810	73791	73791	you	74	” “
73844	73859	73828	73828	I	0	” The smile left my mother ’s face . She looked at me attentively . “
73873	73877	73878	73878	I	0	” she said . “
73889	73890	73882	73882	I	0	” “
73924	73925	73909	73910	Miss Dunross	127	” “
73946	73961	73963	73964	Miss Dunross	127	” My mother paused a little before she put her next question to me . “
73984	73985	73967	73967	her	127	” “
73988	73989	73990	73990	She	127	” “

74053	74054	74046	74047	Miss Dunross	127	” “
74070	74071	74063	74063	she	127	” “
74077	74078	74074	74074	you	74	” “
74109	74312	74105	74105	she	127	” I was silent . The suspicion which those words implied had never occurred to my mind . I had read in medical books of cases of morbid nervous sensitiveness exactly similar to the case of Miss Dunross , as described by herself — and that had been enough for me . Now that my mother ’s idea had found its way from her mind to mine , the impression produced on me was painful in the last degree . Horrible imaginings of deformity possessed my brain , and profaned all that was purest and dearest in my recollections of Miss Dunross . It was useless to change the subject — the evil influence that was on me was too potent to be charmed away by talk . Making the best excuse that I could think of for leaving my mother ’s room , I hurried away to seek a refuge from myself , where alone I could hope to find it , in the presence of Mrs. Van Brandt . THE landlady was taking the air at her own door when I reached the house . Her reply to my inquiries justified my most hopeful anticipations . The poor lodger looked already “
74316	74336	74105	74105	she	127	” ; and the child was at that moment posted on the stairs , watching for the return of her “
74340	74341	74105	74105	she	127	” “
74361	74367	74354	74354	sir	2230	” the woman went on . “
74416	74442	74445	74445	he	1775	” Absorbed in the higher and dearer interests that filled my mind , I had thus far forgotten the very existence of Mr. Van Brandt . “
74447	74451	74445	74445	he	1775	” I asked . “
74458	74463	74445	74445	he	1775	” was the answer . “
74469	74577	74578	74578	Mamma	135	” In those days a man imprisoned for debt was not infrequently a man imprisoned for life . There was little fear of my visit being shortened by the appearance on the scene of Mr. Van Brandt . Ascending the stairs , I found the child waiting for me on the upper landing , with a ragged doll in her arms . I had bought a cake for her on my way to the house . She forthwith turned over the doll to my care , and , trotting before me into the room with her cake in her arms , announced my arrival in these words : “
74596	74675	74589	74589	You	135	” The mother ’s wasted face reddened for a moment , then turned pale again , as she held out her hand to me . I looked at her anxiously , and discerned the welcome signs of recovery , clearly revealed . Her grand gray eyes rested on me again with a glimmer of their old light . The hand that had lain so cold in mine on the past night had life and warmth in it now . “
74690	74696	74677	74677	I	0	” she asked , softly . “
74713	74737	74698	74698	you	135	” Before I was aware of her , she bent her head over my hand , and touched it tenderly with her lips . “
74745	74747	74738	74738	I	0	” she murmured—“and
74758	74768	74749	74749	I	0	” The child looked up quickly from her cake . “
74776	74801	74772	74772	you	135	” the quaint little creature asked , with a broad stare of astonishment . Her head sunk on her breast . She sighed bitterly . “
74807	74826	74805	74805	Me	0	” she said , suddenly recovering her composure , and suddenly forcing herself to look at me again . “
74838	74839	74805	74805	Me	0	” “
74844	74848	74805	74805	Me	0	” I answered , “
74858	74867	74853	74854	Saint Anthony	105	” She raised herself eagerly in the chair . “
74887	74891	74875	74875	you	135	” she exclaimed . “
74899	74900	74875	74875	you	135	” “
74914	74915	74868	74868	You	135	” “
74929	74992	74868	74868	You	135	” I related what had happened as exactly as I could , consistently with maintaining the strictest reserve on one point . Concealing from her the very existence of Miss Dunross , I left her to suppose that the master of the house was the one person whom I had found to receive me during my sojourn under Mr. Dunross ’s roof . “
74997	75011	74868	74868	You	135	” she exclaimed , after she had heard me attentively to the end . “
75016	75033	74868	74868	You	135	” I asked . She hesitated , searching my face earnestly with her large grave eyes . “
75041	75045	75034	75034	I	0	” she said . “
75100	75101	75085	75098	one old man for your companion while you were at the house in Shetland	1784	” “
75112	75116	75117	75117	I	0	” I inquired . “
75120	75124	75117	75117	I	0	” she answered , “
75134	75234	75128	75132	a lady in the house	1787	” I can not positively say that the reply took me by surprise : it forced me to reflect before I spoke again . I knew , by my past experience , that she must have seen me , in my absence from her , while I was spiritually present to her mind in a trance or dream . Had she also seen the daily companion of my life in Shetland — Miss Dunross ? I put the question in a form which left me free to decide whether I should take her unreservedly into my confidence or not . “
75239	75243	75236	75236	I	0	” I began , “
75270	75271	75255	75255	you	1789	” “
75274	75278	75255	75255	you	1789	” she answered . “
75317	75318	75307	75307	you	1789	” “
75325	75326	75321	75321	you	1789	” “
75436	75437	75420	75420	I	0	” “
75449	75450	75451	75451	I	0	” “
75559	75610	75555	75555	I	0	” She stopped , shuddering as if a sudden fear had laid its hold on her . Seeing this , and dreading the effect of any violent agitation , I hastened to suggest that we should say no more , for that day , on the subject of her dream . “
75613	75619	75555	75555	I	0	” she answered , firmly . “
75667	75707	75658	75658	I	0	” She stopped again . Was she approaching the subject of the shrouded figure , with the black veil over its head ? Was she about to describe her first discovery , in the dream , of Miss Dunross ? “
75714	75718	75658	75658	I	0	” she resumed . “
75749	75750	75745	75745	you	1789	” “
75754	75755	75745	75745	you	1789	” “
75774	75775	75745	75745	you	1789	” “
75778	75779	75745	75745	you	1789	” “
75791	75792	75793	75793	I	0	” “
75798	75799	75793	75793	I	0	” “
75816	75838	75839	75839	I	0	” It would have been worse than useless ( after what I had now heard ) to attempt to deceive her . “
75844	75848	75841	75842	another companion	1801	” I answered . “
75860	75925	75857	75858	a woman	237	” Her face showed , as I spoke , that she was again shaken by the terrifying recollection to which she had just alluded . I had , by this time , some difficulty myself in preserving my composure . Still , I was determined not to let a word escape me which could operate as a suggestion on the mind of my companion . “
75935	75941	75927	75927	you	237	” was all I said . “
75945	75949	75927	75927	you	237	” she answered . “
75961	75962	75965	75965	She	1785	” “
75987	76005	75965	75965	She	1785	” Mrs. Van Brandt leaned back in her chair , and covered her eyes with her hands . “
76024	76028	76008	76008	your	0	” she said . “
76072	76099	76100	76101	Good God	93	” Those words literally electrified me . My conversation of that morning with my mother instantly recurred to my memory . I started to my feet . “
76103	76107	76110	76110	you	0	” I exclaimed , “
76113	76114	76110	76110	you	0	” “
76121	76130	76110	76110	you	0	” she asked in amazement on her side . “
76152	76153	76147	76147	you	0	” “
76199	76200	76160	76161	the lady	2202	” “
76212	76213	76214	76214	You	0	” “
76250	76251	76242	76242	you	0	” “
76267	76268	76269	76269	I	0	” “
76275	76279	76269	76269	I	0	” I answered . “
76287	76288	76280	76280	She	2202	” “
76424	76454	76395	76395	You	0	” At those words , she abruptly checked herself . I could say nothing — my face spoke for me . She saw it , and guessed the truth . “
76458	76462	76463	76463	you	0	” she cried , “
76581	76821	76822	76822	You	1819	” So she ran on , trying vainly to forget the shock that she had inflicted on me in talking nursery nonsense to the child . Recovering my composure in some degree , I did my best to second the effort that she had made . My quieter thoughts suggested that she might well be self - deceived in believing the horrible spectacle presented to her in the vision to be an actual reflection of the truth . In common justice toward Miss Dunross I ought surely not to accept the conviction of her deformity on no better evidence than the evidence of a dream ? Reasonable as it undoubtedly was , this view left certain doubts still lingering in my mind . The child ’s instinct soon discovered that her mother and I were playfellows who felt no genuine enjoyment of the game . She dismissed her make - believe guests without ceremony , and went back with her doll to the favorite play - ground on which I had met her — the landing outside the door . No persuasion on her mother ’s part or on mine succeeded in luring her back to us . We were left together , to face each other as best we might — with the forbidden subject of Miss Dunross between us . FEELING the embarrassment of the moment most painfully on her side , Mrs. Van Brandt spoke first . “
76831	76835	76822	76822	You	1819	” she began . “
76850	76851	76852	76852	I	0	” “
76861	76865	76852	76852	I	0	” I answered . “
76875	76876	76877	76877	My	0	” “
76887	76888	76877	76877	My	0	” “
76894	76905	76877	76877	My	0	” she exclaimed , with an entreating look at me . “
76942	76961	76962	76962	I	0	” I forced myself to mention Van Brandt ’s name , rather than hear it pass her lips . “
76976	76980	76967	76969	Mr. Van Brandt	102	” I said . “
76995	76996	76997	76997	He	102	” “
77012	77018	76997	76997	He	102	” she rejoined , sadly . “
77038	77052	77053	77053	I	0	” Even this negative defense of Van Brandt stung me to the quick . “
77063	77069	77053	77053	I	0	” I said , bitterly . “
77100	77119	77122	77122	you	0	” She put her hand on my mouth , and stopped me before I could say any more . “
77129	77133	77122	77122	you	0	” she asked . “
77274	77275	77263	77263	you	0	” “
77285	77289	77276	77277	The child	2711	” I said . “
77309	77310	77276	77277	The child	2711	” “
77313	77317	77276	77277	The child	2711	” she repeated . “
77521	77618	77516	77516	you	0	” I yielded—-and spoke of it no more . Every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom I had loved , and lost . What refuge was now left to me ? But one refuge ; I could still offer to her the sacrifice of myself . Bitterly as I hated the man who had parted us , I loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake . Hopeless infatuation ! I do n’t deny it ; I do n’t excuse it — hopeless infatuation ! “
77624	77628	77619	77619	You	0	” I said . “
77662	77663	77657	77657	I	0	” “
77673	77679	77657	77657	I	0	” she answered , gratefully . “
77707	77708	77709	77710	A doctor	1685	” “
77719	77723	77709	77710	A doctor	1685	” I repeated . “
77729	77730	77726	77726	you	0	” “
77739	77743	77731	77731	I	0	” she said , “
77752	77753	77748	77750	Mr. Van Brandt	102	” “
77765	77769	77748	77750	Mr. Van Brandt	102	” I asked . “
77790	77803	77781	77781	I	0	” She looked at me for a moment , in silent distress . “
77820	77831	77832	77832	I	0	” she asked , as soon as she could speak . “
77886	77887	77888	77888	Your	0	” “
77891	77895	77888	77888	Your	0	” I exclaimed . “
78016	78212	78213	78213	You	1857	” To insure her life ! The snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words . In the eye of the law she was , of course , a single woman : she was of age ; she was , to all intents and purposes , her own mistress . What was there to prevent her from insuring her life , if she pleased , and from so disposing of the insurance as to give Van Brandt a direct interest in her death ? Knowing what I knew of him — believing him , as I did , to be capable of any atrocity — I trembled at the bare idea of what might have happened if I had failed to find my way back to her until a later date . Thanks to the happy accident of my position , the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach . I could offer to lend the scoundrel the money that he wanted at an hour ’s notice , and he was the man to accept my proposal quite as easily as I could make it . “
78223	78242	78213	78213	You	1857	” she said , noticing , in evident perplexity , the effect which she had produced on me . “
78262	78263	78264	78264	You	1857	” “
78269	78273	78264	78264	You	1857	” I replied . “
78323	78324	78298	78298	you	1857	” “
78331	78337	78298	78298	you	1857	” she said , sadly . “
78368	78382	78360	78360	they	1859	” Cautiously as I had expressed myself , her delicacy took the alarm . “
78400	78404	78385	78385	you	1857	” she rejoined , “
78413	78498	78508	78508	you	1857	” I could honestly promise that . My one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that I had now determined to pursue . I rose to go , while my resolution still sustained me . The sooner I made my inquiries ( I reminded her ) the more speedily our present doubts and difficulties would be resolved . She rose , as I rose — with the tears in her eyes , and the blush on her cheeks . “
78502	78506	78508	78508	you	1857	” she whispered , “
78533	78626	78527	78527	your	1857	” I pressed her to my heart , with the unacknowledged tenderness of a parting embrace . It was impossible to disguise the position in which I had now placed myself . I had , so to speak , pronounced my own sentence of banishment . When my interference had restored my unworthy rival to his freedom , could I submit to the degrading necessity of seeing her in his presence , of speaking to her under his eyes ? That sacrifice of myself was beyond me — and I knew it . “
78632	78645	78527	78527	your	1857	” I thought , as I held her to me for a moment longer—“for
78650	78808	78527	78527	your	1857	” The child ran to meet me with open arms when I stepped out on the landing . My manhood had sustained me through the parting with the mother . It was only when the child ’s round , innocent little face laid itself lovingly against mine that my fortitude gave way . I was past speaking ; I put her down gently in silence , and waited on the lower flight of stairs until I was fit to face the world outside . DESCENDING to the ground - floor of the house , I sent to request a moment ’s interview with the landlady . I had yet to learn in which of the London prisons Van Brandt was confined ; and she was the only person to whom I could venture to address the question . Having answered my inquiries , the woman put her own sordid construction on my motive for visiting the prisoner . “
78822	78826	78527	78527	your	1857	” she asked . “
78857	79037	79038	79038	I	0	” The woman ’s coarse warning actually proved useful to me ; it started a new idea in my mind ! Before she spoke , I had been too dull or too preoccupied to see that it was quite needless to degrade myself by personally communicating with Van Brandt in his prison . It only now occurred to me that my legal advisers were , as a matter of course , the proper persons to represent me in the matter — with this additional advantage , that they could keep my share in the transaction a secret even from Van Brandt himself . I drove at once to the office of my lawyers . The senior partner — the tried friend and adviser of our family — received me . My instructions , naturally enough , astonished him . He was immediately to satisfy the prisoner ’s creditors , on my behalf , without mentioning my name to any one . And he was gravely to accept as security for repayment — Mr. Van Brandt ’s note of hand ! “
79058	79064	79040	79040	I	0	” the senior partner remarked . “
79127	79181	79184	79184	George	74	” I left him , and went home . The servant who opened the door had a message for me from my mother . She wished to see me as soon as I was at leisure to speak to her . I presented myself at once in my mother ’s sitting - room . “
79186	79201	79184	79184	George	74	” she said , without a word to prepare me for what was coming . “
79210	79219	79206	79208	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” I was completely thrown off my guard . “
79232	79236	79237	79237	My	0	” I asked . “
79330	79412	79413	79413	I	0	” Those were the words ! Hardly an hour had elapsed since Mrs. Van Brandt ’s own lips had told me that our union was impossible . Not even half an hour had passed since I had given the directions which would restore to liberty the man who was the one obstacle to my marriage . And this was the time that my mother had innocently chosen for consenting to receive as her daughter - in - law Mrs. Van Brandt ! “
79420	79424	79416	79416	I	0	” she resumed . “
79592	79628	79590	79590	her	1876	” I could not trust myself to speak . I could only kneel at my mother ’s feet , and hide my face on her knees , as if I had been a boy again . “
79635	79639	79633	79633	George	74	” she said . “
79661	79728	79646	79646	you	74	” She lifted my head and kissed me . As I rose to leave her , I saw something in the dear old eyes that met mine so tenderly , which struck a sudden fear through me , keen and cutting , like a stroke from a knife . The moment I had closed the door , I went downstairs to the porter in the hall . “
79736	79740	79646	79646	you	74	” I asked , “
79747	79748	79646	79646	you	74	” “
79753	79754	79646	79646	you	74	” “
79760	79761	79762	79763	One visitor	1882	” “
79769	79770	79762	79763	One visitor	1882	” “
79778	79843	79772	79772	you	0	” The porter mentioned the name of a celebrated physician — a man at the head of his profession in those days . I instantly took my hat and went to his house . He had just returned from his round of visits . My card was taken to him , and was followed at once by my admission to his consulting - room . “
79850	79854	79844	79844	You	2230	” I said . “
79884	79895	79896	79896	Your	0	” The great man took me kindly by the hand . “
79918	79922	79906	79906	she	365	” he said . “
79987	80040	80042	80042	me	0	” He gave me time to steady myself under the blow ; and then he placed his vast experience , his matured and consummate knowledge , at my disposal . From his dictation , I committed to writing the necessary instructions for watching over the frail tenure of my mother ’s life . “
80050	80058	80042	80042	me	0	” he said , as we parted . “
80139	80224	80225	80226	My lawyers	1859	” That evening I made my excuse . It was easily found . I had only to tell my poor mother of Mrs. Van Brandt ’s refusal to marry me , and there was an intelligible motive assigned for my proposing to leave London . The same night I wrote to inform Mrs. Van Brandt of the sad event which was the cause of my sudden departure , and to warn her that there no longer existed the slightest necessity for insuring her life . “
80227	80232	80225	80226	My lawyers	1859	” ( I wrote ) “
80264	80451	80248	80248	he	102	” The last lines of the letter assured her of my unalterable love , and entreated her to write to me before she left England . This done , all was done . I was conscious , strange to say , of no acutely painful suffering at this saddest time of my life . There is a limit , morally as well as physically , to our capacity for endurance . I can only describe my sensations under the calamities that had now fallen on me in one way : I felt like a man whose mind had been stunned . The next day my mother and I set forth on the first stage of our journey to the south coast of Devonshire . THREE days after my mother and I had established ourselves at Torquay , I received Mrs. Van Brandt ’s answer to my letter . After the opening sentences ( informing me that Van Brandt had been set at liberty , under circumstances painfully suggestive to the writer of some unacknowledged sacrifice on my part ) , the letter proceeded in these terms : “
80549	80576	80579	80579	You	1891	“ We leave England for the Continent early tomorrow morning . Shall I tell you in what part of Europe my new residence is to be ? “
80676	80722	80728	80728	you	1891	“ I shall not be without some consolation on my side , when I too look back at the past . I have been a better woman since I met with you . Live as long as I may , I shall always remember that . “
81035	81062	81064	81065	VAN BRANDT	103	“ Farewell , my beloved benefactor , my only friend ! The child sends you a kiss ; and the mother signs herself your grateful and affectionate “
81067	82482	81064	81065	VAN BRANDT	103	” When I first read those lines , they once more recalled to my memory — very strangely , as I then thought — the predictions of Dame Dermody in the days of my boyhood . Here were the foretold sympathies which were spiritually to unite me to Mary , realized by a stranger whom I had met by chance in the later years of my life ! Thinking in this direction , did I advance no further ? Not a step further ! Not a suspicion of the truth presented itself to my mind even yet . Was my own dullness of apprehension to blame for this ? Would another man in my position have discovered what I had failed to see ? I look back along the chain of events which runs through my narrative , and I ask myself , Where are the possibilities to be found ( in my case , or in the case of any other man ) of identifying the child who was Mary Dermody with the woman who was Mrs. Van Brandt ? Was there anything left in our faces , when we met again by the Scotch river , to remind us of our younger selves ? We had developed , in the interval , from boy and girl to man and woman : no outward traces were discernible in us of the George and Mary of other days . Disguised from each other by our faces , we were also disguised by our names . Her mock - marriage had changed her surname . My step - father ’s will had changed mine . Her Christian name was the commonest of all names of women ; and mine was almost as far from being remarkable among the names of men . Turning next to the various occasions on which we had met , had we seen enough of each other to drift into recognition on either side , in the ordinary course of talk ? We had met but four times in all ; once on the bridge , once again in Edinburgh , twice more in London . On each of these occasions , the absorbing anxieties and interests of the passing moment had filled her mind and mine , had inspired her words and mine . When had the events which had brought us together left us with leisure enough and tranquillity enough to look back idly through our lives , and calmly to compare the recollections of our youth ? Never ! From first to last , the course of events had borne us further and further away from any results that could have led even to a suspicion of the truth . She could only believe when she wrote to me on leaving England — and I could only believe when I read her letter — that we had first met at the river , and that our divergent destinies had ended in parting us forever . Reading her farewell letter in later days by the light of my matured experience , I note how remarkably Dame Dermody ’s faith in the purity of the tie that united us as kindred spirits was justified by the result . It was only when my unknown Mary was parted from Van Brandt — in other words , it was only when she was a pure spirit — that she felt my influence over her as a refining influence on her life , and that the apparition of her communicated with me in the visible and perfect likeness of herself . On my side , when was it that I dreamed of her ( as in Scotland ) , or felt the mysterious warning of her presence in my waking moments ( as in Shetland ) ? Always at the time when my heart opened most tenderly toward her and toward others — when my mind was most free from the bitter doubts , the self - seeking aspirations , which degrade the divinity within us . Then , and then only , my sympathy with her was the perfect sympathy which holds its fidelity unassailable by the chances and changes , the delusions and temptations , of mortal life . I am writing prematurely of the time when the light came to me . My narrative must return to the time when I was still walking in darkness . Absorbed in watching over the closing days of my mother ’s life , I found in the performance of this sacred duty my only consolation under the overthrow of my last hope of marriage with Mrs. Van Brandt . By slow degrees my mother felt the reviving influences of a quiet life and a soft , pure air . The improvement in her health could , as I but too well knew , be only an improvement for a time . Still , it was a relief to see her free from pain , and innocently happy in the presence of her son . Excepting those hours of the day and night which were dedicated to repose , I was never away from her . To this day I remember , with a tenderness which attaches to no other memories of mine , the books that I read to her , the sunny corner on the seashore where I sat with her , the games of cards that we played together , the little trivial gossip that amused her when she was strong enough for nothing else . These are my imperishable relics ; these are the deeds of my life that I shall love best to look back on , when the all - infolding shadows of death are closing round me . In the hours when I was alone , my thoughts — occupying themselves mostly among the persons and events of the past — wandered back , many and many a time , to Shetland and Miss Dunross . My haunting doubt as to what the black veil had really hidden from me was no longer accompanied by a feeling of horror when it now recurred to my mind . The more vividly my later remembrances of Miss Dunross were associated with the idea of an unutterable bodily affliction , the higher the noble nature of the woman seemed to rise in my esteem . For the first time since I had left Shetland , the temptation now came to me to disregard the injunction which her father had laid on me at parting . When I thought again of the stolen kiss in the dead of night ; when I recalled the appearance of the frail white hand , waving to me through the dark curtains its last farewell ; and when there mingled with these memories the later remembrance of what my mother had suspected , and of what Mrs. Van Brandt had seen in her dream — the longing in me to find a means of assuring Miss Dunross that she still held her place apart in my memory and my heart was more than mortal fortitude could resist . I was pledged in honor not to return to Shetland , and not to write . How to communicate with her secretly , in some other way , was the constant question in my mind as the days went on . A hint to enlighten me was all that I wanted ; and , as the irony of circumstances ordered it , my mother was the person who gave me the hint . We still spoke , at intervals , of Mrs. Van Brandt . Watching me on those occasions when we were in the company of friends and acquaintances at Torquay , my mother plainly discerned that no other woman , whatever her attractions might be , could take the place in my heart of the woman whom I had lost . Seeing but one prospect of happiness for me , she steadily refused to abandon the idea of my marriage . When a woman has owned that she loves a man ( so my mother used to express her opinion ) , it is that man ’s fault , no matter what the obstacles may be , if he fails to make her his wife . Reverting to this view in various ways , she pressed it on my consideration one day in these words : “
82514	82515	82510	82512	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” “
82519	82523	82510	82512	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” I said , “
82537	82538	82510	82512	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” “
82786	82979	82782	82784	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” Here was the idea of which I had been vainly in search ! Quite superfluous as a method of pleading my cause with Mrs. Van Brandt , the portrait offered the best of all means of communicating with Miss Dunross , without absolutely violating the engagement to which her father had pledged me . In this way , without writing a word , without even sending a message , I might tell her how gratefully she was remembered ; I might remind her of me tenderly in the bitterest moments of her sad and solitary life . The same day I went to the artist privately . The sittings were afterward continued during the hours while my mother was resting in her room , until the portrait was completed . I caused it to be inclosed in a plain gold locket , with a chain attached ; and I forwarded my gift , in the first instance , to the one person whom I could trust to assist me in arranging for the conveyance of it to its destination . This was the old friend ( alluded to in these pages as “
82982	83251	82782	82784	Mrs. Van Brandt	103	” ) who had taken me with him to Shetland in the Government yacht . I had no reason , in writing the necessary explanations , to express myself to Sir James with any reserve . On the voyage back we had more than once spoken together confidentially of Miss Dunross . Sir James had heard her sad story from the resident medical man at Lerwick , who had been an old companion of his in their college days . Requesting him to confide my gift to this gentleman , I did not hesitate to acknowledge the doubt that oppressed me in relation to the mystery of the black veil . It was , of course , impossible to decide whether the doctor would be able to relieve that doubt . I could only venture to suggest that the question might be guardedly put , in making the customary inquiries after the health of Miss Dunross . In those days of slow communication , I had to wait , not for days , but for weeks , before I could expect to receive Sir James ’s answer . His letter only reached me after an unusually long delay . For this , or for some other reason that I can not divine , I felt so strongly the foreboding of bad news that I abstained from breaking the seal in my mother ’s presence . I waited until I could retire to my own room , and then I opened the letter . My presentiment had not deceived me . Sir James ’s reply contained these words only : “
83281	83308	83274	83274	I	0	” The letter thus described was addressed to Sir James by the doctor at Lerwick . I copy it ( without comment ) in these words : “
83383	83401	83369	83381	a friend of yours whose name you are not at liberty to mention	1913	“ In transmitting these instructions , you have innocently placed me in a position of extreme difficulty . “
83492	83616	83617	83617	I	0	“ In this state of doubt I have ventured on opening the locket , and my hesitation is naturally increased . I am quite ignorant of the remembrances which my unhappy patient may connect with the portrait . I do n’t know whether it will give her pleasure or pain to receive it , in her last moments on earth . I can only decide to take it with me , when I see her to - morrow , and to let circumstances determine whether I shall risk letting her see it or not . Our post to the South only leaves this place in three days ’ time . I can keep my letter open , and let you know the result . “
83655	83755	83640	83640	I	0	“ Her sinking energies , when I first saw her this morning , had rallied for the moment . The nurse informed me that she had slept during the early hours of the new day . Previously to this , there were symptoms of fever , accompanied by some slight delirium . The words that escaped her in this condition appear to have related mainly to an absent person whom she spoke of by the name of ‘ George . ’ Her one anxiety , I am told , was to see ‘ George ’ again before she died . “
83879	83944	83945	83945	She	1918	“ It was a risk to run . The black veil which she always wears was over her face . I had nothing to tell me of the effect which I was producing on her , except the changing temperature , or the partial movement , of her hand , as it lay in mine , just under the silk coverlet of the bed . “
83994	84004	84005	84005	I	0	“ ‘ Is he here ? ’ she asked . “
84016	84024	84025	84025	I	0	“ ‘ Is there a letter ? ’ “
84031	84075	84076	84076	I	0	“ She was silent for a while . Her hand turned cold ; the grasp of her fingers loosened . She spoke again : ‘ Be quick , doctor ! Whatever it is , give it to me , before I die . ’ “
84093	84227	84081	84081	I	0	“ So far as I could discover , she refrained from looking at it at first . She said , ‘ Turn me in the bed , with my face to the wall . ’ I obeyed her . With her back turned toward me she lifted her veil ; and then ( as I suppose ) she looked at the portrait . A long , low cry — not of sorrow or pain : a cry of rapture and delight — burst from her . I heard her kiss the portrait . Accustomed as I am in my profession to piteous sights and sounds , I never remember so completely losing my self - control as I lost it at that moment . I was obliged to turn away to the window . “
84282	84294	84267	84267	she	1923	“ ‘ Put it round my neck , ’ she whispered . “
84321	84333	84334	84334	I	0	“ ‘ Help me to hide it , ’ she said . “
84407	84435	84436	84436	I	0	“ ‘ Promise , ’ she said , ‘ that no stranger ’s hand shall touch me . Promise to bury me as I am now . ’ “
84442	84458	84436	84436	I	0	“ Her failing breath quickened . She was just able to articulate the next words : “
84466	84502	84436	84436	I	0	“ I drew the veil over her face . She rested a while in silence . Suddenly the sound of her laboring respiration ceased . She started , and raised her head from my shoulder . “
84513	84524	84510	84510	I	0	“ ‘ I am in heaven ! ’ she answered . “
84573	84585	84566	84566	God	93	“ I return to my letter before the post goes out . “
84657	84881	84647	84647	his	1925	“ I observe a passage in your letter to which I have not yet replied . You ask me if there was any more serious reason for the persistent hiding of her face under the veil than the reason which she was accustomed to give to the persons about her . It is true that she suffered under a morbid sensitiveness to the action of light . It is also true that this was not the only result , or the worst result , of the malady that afflicted her . She had another reason for keeping her face hidden — a reason known to two persons only : to the doctor who lives in the village near her father ’s house , and to myself . We are both pledged never to divulge to any living creature what our eyes alone have seen . We have kept our terrible secret even from her father ; and we shall carry it with us to our graves . I have no more to say on this melancholy subject to the person in whose interest you write . When he thinks of her now , let him think of the beauty which no bodily affliction can profane — the beauty of the freed spirit , eternally happy in its union with the angels of God . “
84944	85970	85972	85972	you	1930	” So the letter ended . I put it away , and went out . The solitude of my room forewarned me unendurably of the coming solitude in my own life . My interests in this busy world were now narrowed to one object — to the care of my mother ’s failing health . Of the two women whose hearts had once beaten in loving sympathy with mine , one lay in her grave and the other was lost to me in a foreign land . On the drive by the sea I met my mother , in her little pony - chaise , moving slowly under the mild wintry sunshine . I dismissed the man who was in attendance on her , and walked by the side of the chaise , with the reins in my hand . We chatted quietly on trivial subjects . I closed my eyes to the dreary future that was before me , and tried , in the intervals of the heart - ache , to live resignedly in the passing hour . The last parting is over . Prolonged by my care , the days of my mother ’s life have come to their end . She has died in my arms : her last words have been spoken to me , her last look on earth has been mine . I am now , in the saddest and plainest meaning of the words , alone in the world . The affliction which has befallen me has left certain duties to be performed that require my presence in London . My house is let ; I am staying at a hotel . My friend , Sir James ( also in London on business ) , has rooms near mine . We breakfast and dine together in my sitting - room . For the moment solitude is dreadful to me , and yet I can not go into society ; I shrink from persons who are mere acquaintances . At Sir James ’s suggestion , however , one visitor at the hotel has been asked to dine with us , who claims distinction as no ordinary guest . The physician who first warned me of the critical state of my mother ’s health is anxious to hear what I can tell him of her last moments . His time is too precious to be wasted in the earlier hours of the day , and he joins us at the dinner - table when his patients leave him free to visit his friends . The dinner is nearly at an end . I have made the effort to preserve my self - control ; and in few words have told the simple story of my mother ’s last peaceful days on earth . The conversation turns next on topics of little interest to me : my mind rests after the effort that it has made ; my observation is left free to exert itself as usual . Little by little , while the talk goes on , I observe something in the conduct of the celebrated physician which first puzzles me , and then arouses my suspicion of some motive for his presence which has not been acknowledged , and in which I am concerned . Over and over again I discover that his eyes are resting on me with a furtive interest and attention which he seems anxious to conceal . Over and over again I notice that he contrives to divert the conversation from general topics , and to lure me into talking of myself ; and , stranger still ( unless I am quite mistaken ) , Sir James understands and encourages him . Under various pretenses I am questioned about what I have suffered in the past , and what plans of life I have formed for the future . Among other subjects of personal interest to me , the subject of supernatural appearances is introduced . I am asked if I believe in occult spiritual sympathies , and in ghostly apparitions of dead or distant persons . I am dexterously led into hinting that my views on this difficult and debatable question are in some degree influenced by experiences of my own . Hints , however , are not enough to satisfy the doctor ’s innocent curiosity ; he tries to induce me to relate in detail what I have myself seen and felt . But by this time I am on my guard ; I make excuses ; I steadily abstain from taking my friend into my confidence . It is more and more plain to me that I am being made the subject of an experiment , in which Sir James and the physician are equally interested . Outwardly assuming to be guiltless of any suspicion of what is going on , I inwardly determine to discover the true motive for the doctor ’s presence that evening , and for the part that Sir James has taken in inviting him to be my guest . Events favor my purpose soon after the dessert has been placed on the table . The waiter enters the room with a letter for me , and announces that the bearer waits to know if there is any answer . I open the envelope , and find inside a few lines from my lawyers , announcing the completion of some formal matter of business . I at once seize the opportunity that is offered to me . Instead of sending a verbal message downstairs , I make my apologies , and use the letter as a pretext for leaving the room . Dismissing the messenger who waits below , I return to the corridor in which my rooms are situated , and softly open the door of my bed - chamber . A second door communicates with the sitting - room , and has a ventilator in the upper part of it . I have only to stand under the ventilator , and every word of the conversation between Sir James and the physician reaches my ears . “
85978	85992	85972	85972	you	1930	” are the first words I hear , in Sir James ’s voice . “
85996	86001	85972	85972	you	1930	” the doctor answers . “
86017	86022	86005	86005	my	0	” Sir James proceeds . “
86110	86111	86080	86080	You	1934	” “
86119	86126	86080	86080	You	1934	” I hear the physician reply . “
86333	86334	86325	86325	he	1931	” “
86338	86343	86325	86325	he	1931	” Sir James remarks . “
86355	86360	86325	86325	he	1931	” the doctor rejoins . “
86373	86374	86325	86325	he	1931	” “
86381	86386	86325	86325	he	1931	” persists Sir James . “
86448	86449	86432	86432	you	674	” “
86456	86461	86432	86432	you	674	” answers the doctor . “
86538	86539	86540	86540	You	674	” “
86554	86555	86552	86552	doctor	674	” “
86585	87293	86573	86573	he	1944	” Hearing this , I wait to hear no more . I return to the sitting - room ( by way of the corridor ) and resume my place at the table . The indignation that I feel — naturally enough , I think , under the circumstances — makes a good actor of me for once in my life . I invent the necessary excuse for my long absence , and take my part in the conversation , keeping the strictest guard on every word that escapes me , without betraying any appearance of restraint in my manner . Early in the evening the doctor leaves us to go to a scientific meeting . For half an hour or more Sir James remains with me . By way ( as I suppose ) of farther testing the state of my mind , he renews the invitation to his house in Scotland . I pretend to feel flattered by his anxiety to secure me as his guest . I undertake to reconsider my first refusal , and to give him a definite answer when we meet the next morning at breakfast . Sir James is delighted . We shake hands cordially , and wish each other good - night . At last I am left alone . My resolution as to my next course of proceeding is formed without a moment ’s hesitation . I determine to leave the hotel privately the next morning before Sir James is out of his bedroom . To what destination I am to betake myself is naturally the next question that arises , and this also I easily decide . During the last days of my mother ’s life we spoke together frequently of the happy past days when we were living together on the banks of the Greenwater lake . The longing thus inspired to look once more at the old scenes , to live for a while again among the old associations , has grown on me since my mother ’s death . I have , happily for myself , not spoken of this feeling to Sir James or to any other person . When I am missed at the hotel , there will be no suspicion of the direction in which I have turned my steps . To the old home in Suffolk I resolve to go the next morning . Wandering among the scenes of my boyhood , I can consider with myself how I may best bear the burden of the life that lies before me . After what I have heard that evening , I confide in nobody . For all I know to the contrary , my own servant may be employed to - morrow as the spy who watches my actions . When the man makes his appearance to take his orders for the night , I tell him to wake me at six the next morning , and release him from further attendance . I next employ myself in writing two letters . They will be left on the table , to speak for themselves after my departure . In the first letter I briefly inform Sir James that I have discovered his true reason for inviting the doctor to dinner . While I thank him for the interest he takes in my welfare , I decline to be made the object of any further medical inquiries as to the state of my mind . In due course of time , when my plans are settled , he will hear from me again . Meanwhile , he need feel no anxiety about my safety . It is one among my other delusions to believe that I am still perfectly capable of taking care of myself . My second letter is addressed to the landlord of the hotel , and simply provides for the disposal of my luggage and the payment of my bill . I enter my bedroom next , and pack a traveling - bag with the few things that I can carry with me . My money is in my dressing - case . Opening it , I discover my pretty keepsake — the green flag ! Can I return to “
87297	87969	86573	86573	he	1944	” can I look again at the bailiff ’s cottage , without the one memorial of little Mary that I possess ? Besides , have I not promised Miss Dunross that Mary ’s gift shall always go with me wherever I go ? and is the promise not doubly sacred now that she is dead ? For a while I sit idly looking at the device on the flag — the white dove embroidered on the green ground , with the golden olive - branch in its beak . The innocent love - story of my early life returns to my memory , and shows me in horrible contrast the life that I am leading now . I fold up the flag and place it carefully in my traveling - bag . This done , all is done . I may rest till the morning comes . No ! I lie down on my bed , and I discover that there is no rest for me that night . Now that I have no occupation to keep my energies employed , now that my first sense of triumph in the discomfiture of the friends who have plotted against me has had time to subside , my mind reverts to the conversation that I have overheard , and considers it from a new point of view . For the first time , the terrible question confronts me : The doctor ’s opinion on my case has been given very positively . How do I know that the doctor is not right ? This famous physician has risen to the head of his profession entirely by his own abilities . He is one of the medical men who succeed by means of an ingratiating manner and the dexterous handling of good opportunities . Even his enemies admit that he stands unrivaled in the art of separating the true conditions from the false in the discovery of disease , and in tracing effects accurately to their distant and hidden cause . Is such a man as this likely to be mistaken about me ? Is it not far more probable that I am mistaken in my judgment of myself ? When I look back over the past years , am I quite sure that the strange events which I recall may not , in certain cases , be the visionary product of my own disordered brain — realities to me , and to no one else ? What are the dreams of Mrs. Van Brandt ? What are the ghostly apparitions of her which I believe myself to have seen ? Delusions which have been the stealthy growth of years ? delusions which are leading me , by slow degrees , nearer and nearer to madness in the end ? Is it insane suspicion which has made me so angry with the good friends who have been trying to save my reason ? Is it insane terror which sets me on escaping from the hotel like a criminal escaping from prison ? These are the questions which torment me when I am alone in the dead of night . My bed becomes a place of unendurable torture . I rise and dress myself , and wait for the daylight , looking through my open window into the street . The summer night is short . The gray light of dawn comes to me like a deliverance ; the glow of the glorious sunrise cheers my soul once more . Why should I wait in the room that is still haunted by my horrible doubts of the night ? I take up my traveling - bag ; I leave my letters on the sitting - room table ; and I descend the stairs to the house door . The night - porter at the hotel is slumbering in his chair . He wakes as I pass him ; and ( God help me ! ) he too looks as if he thought I was mad . “
87978	88630	88633	88633	his	1954	” he says , looking at the bag in my hand . Mad or sane , I am ready with my reply . I tell him I am going out for a day in the country , and to make it a long day , I must start early . The man still stares at me . He asks if he shall find some one to carry my bag . I decline to let anybody be disturbed . He inquires if I have any messages to leave for my friend . I inform him that I have left written messages upstairs for Sir James and the landlord . Upon this he draws the bolts and opens the door . To the last he looks at me as if he thought I was mad . Was he right or wrong ? Who can answer for himself ? How can I tell ? MY spirits rose as I walked through the bright empty streets , and breathed the fresh morning air . Taking my way eastward through the great city , I stopped at the first office that I passed , and secured my place by the early coach to Ipswich . Thence I traveled with post - horses to the market - town which was nearest to Greenwater Broad . A walk of a few miles in the cool evening brought me , through well - remembered by - roads , to our old house . By the last rays of the setting sun I looked at the familiar row of windows in front , and saw that the shutters were all closed . Not a living creature was visible anywhere . Not even a dog barked as I rang the great bell at the door . The place was deserted ; the house was shut up . After a long delay , I heard heavy footsteps in the hall . An old man opened the door . Changed as he was , I remembered him as one of our tenants in the by - gone time . To his astonishment , I greeted him by his name . On his side , he tried hard to recognize me , and tried in vain . No doubt I was the more sadly changed of the two : I was obliged to introduce myself . The poor fellow ’s withered face brightened slowly and timidly , as if he were half incapable , half afraid , of indulging in the unaccustomed luxury of a smile . In his confusion he bid me welcome home ag ain , as if the house had been mine . Taking me into the little back - room which he inhabited , the old man gave me all he had to offer — a supper of bacon and eggs and a glass of home - brewed beer . He was evidently puzzled to understand me when I informed him that the only object of my visit was to look once more at the familiar scenes round my old home . But he willingly placed his services at my disposal ; and he engaged to do his best , if I wished it , to make me up a bed for the night . The house had been closed and the establishment of servants had been dismissed for more than a year past . A passion for horse - racing , developed late in life , had ruined the rich retired tradesman who had purchased the estate at the time of our family troubles . He had gone abroad with his wife to live on the little income that had been saved from the wreck of his fortune ; and he had left the house and lands in such a state of neglect that no new purchaser had thus far been found to take them . My old friend , “
88636	89568	88633	88633	his	1954	” had been put in charge of the place . As for Dermody ’s cottage , it was empty , like the house . I was at perfect liberty to look over it if I liked . There was the key of the door on the bunch with the others ; and here was the old man , with his old hat on his head , ready to accompany me wherever I pleased to go . I declined to trouble him to accompany me or to make up a bed in the lonely house . The night was fine , the moon was rising . I had supped ; I had rested . When I had seen what I wanted to see , I could easily walk back to the market - town and sleep at the inn . Taking the key in my hand , I set forth alone on the way through the grounds which led to Dermody ’s cottage . Again I followed the woodland paths along which I had once idled so happily with my little Mary . At every step I saw something that reminded me of her . Here was the rustic bench on which we had sat together under the shadow of the old cedar - tree , and vowed to be constant to each other to the end of our lives . There was the bright little water spring , from which we drank when we were weary and thirsty in sultry summer days , still bubbling its way downward to the lake as cheerily as ever . As I listened to the companionable murmur of the stream , I almost expected to see her again , in her simple white frock and straw hat , singing to the music of the rivulet , and freshening her nosegay of wild flowers by dipping it in the cool water . A few steps further on and I reached a clearing in the wood and stood on a little promontory of rising ground which commanded the prettiest view of Greenwater lake . A platform of wood was built out from the bank , to be used for bathing by good swimmers who were not afraid of a plunge into deep water . I stood on the platform and looked round me . The trees that fringed the shore on either hand murmured their sweet sylvan music in the night air ; the moonlight trembled softly on the rippling water . Away on my right hand I could just see the old wooden shed that once sheltered my boat in the days when Mary went sailing with me and worked the green flag . On my left was the wooden paling that followed the curves of the winding creek , and beyond it rose the brown arches of the decoy for wild fowl , now falling to ruin for want of use . Guided by the radiant moonlight , I could see the very spot on which Mary and I had stood to watch the snaring of the ducks . Through the hole in the paling before which the decoy - dog had shown himself , at Dermody ’s signal , a water - rat now passed , like a little black shadow on the bright ground , and was lost in the waters of the lake . Look where I might , the happy by - gone time looked back in mockery , and the voices of the past came to me with their burden of reproach : See what your life was once ! Is your life worth living now ? I picked up a stone and threw it into the lake . I watched the circling ripples round the place at which it had sunk . I wondered if a practiced swimmer like myself had ever tried to commit suicide by drowning , and had been so resolute to die that he had resisted the temptation to let his own skill keep him from sinking . Something in the lake itself , or something in connection with the thought that it had put into my mind , revolted me . I turned my back suddenly on the lonely view , and took the path through the wood which led to the bailiff ’s cottage . Opening the door with my key , I groped my way into the well - remembered parlor ; and , unbarring the window - shutters , I let in the light of the moon . With a heavy heart I looked round me . The old furniture — renewed , perhaps , in one or two places — asserted its mute claim to my recognition in every part of the room . The tender moonlight streamed slanting into the corner in which Mary and I used to nestle together while Dame Dermody was at the window reading her mystic books . Overshadowed by the obscurity in the opposite corner , I discovered the high - backed arm - chair of carved wood in which the Sibyl of the cottage sat on the memorable day when she warned us of our coming separation , and gave us her blessing for the last time . Looking next round the walls of the room , I recognized old friends wherever my eyes happened to rest — the gaudily colored prints ; the framed pictures in fine needle - work , which we thought wonderful efforts of art ; the old circular mirror to which I used to lift Mary when she wanted “
89577	89670	89571	89571	her	1955	” Whenever the moonlight penetrated there , it showed me some familiar object that recalled my happiest days . Again the by - gone time looked back in mockery . Again the voices of the past came to me with their burden of reproach : See what your life was once ! Is your life worth living now ? I sat down at the window , where I could just discover , here and there between the trees , the glimmer of the waters of the lake . I thought to myself : “
89686	90327	88633	88633	his	1954	” Who would grieve for me if my death were reported to - morrow ? Of all living men , I had perhaps the smallest number of friends , the fewest duties to perform toward others , the least reason to hesitate at leaving a world which had no place in it for my ambition , no creature in it for my love . Besides , what necessity was there for letting it be known that my death was a death of my own seeking ? It could easily be left to represent itself as a death by accident . On that fine summer night , and after a long day of traveling , might I not naturally take a bath in the cool water before I went to bed ? And , practiced as I was in the exercise of swimming , might it not nevertheless be my misfortune to be attacked by cramp ? On the lonely shores of Greenwater Broad the cry of a drowning man would bring no help at night . The fatal accident would explain itself . There was literally but one difficulty in the way — the difficulty which had already occurred to my mind . Could I sufficiently master the animal instinct of self - preservation to deliberately let myself sink at the first plunge ? The atmosphere in the room felt close and heavy . I went out , and walked to and fro — now in the shadow , and now in the moonlight — under the trees before the cottage door . Of the moral objections to suicide , not one had any influence over me now . I , who had once found it impossible to excuse , impossible even to understand , the despair which had driven Mrs. Van Brandt to attempt self - destruction — I now contemplated with composure the very act which had horrified me when I saw it committed by another person . Well may we hesitate to condemn the frailties of our fellow - creatures , for the one unanswerable reason that we can never feel sure how soon similar temptations may not lead us to be guilty of the same frailties ourselves . Looking back at the events of the night , I can recall but one consideration that stayed my feet on the fatal path which led back to the lake . I still doubted whether it would be possible for such a swimmer as I was to drown himself . This was all that troubled my mind . For the rest , my will was made , and I had few other affairs which remained unsettled . No lingering hope was left in me of a reunion in the future with Mrs. Van Brandt . She had never written to me again ; I had ( forgiven ) her for having forgotten me . My thoughts of her and of others were the forbearing thoughts of a man whose mind was withdrawn already from the world , whose views were narrowing fast to the one idea of his own death . I grew weary of walking up and down . The loneliness of the place began to oppress me . The sense of my own indecision irritated my nerves . After a long look at the lake through the trees , I came to a positive conclusion at last . I determined to try if a good swimmer could drown himself . RETURNING to the cottage parlor , I took a chair by the window and opened my pocket - book at a blank page . I had certain directions to give to my representatives , which might spare them some trouble and uncertainty in the event of my death . Disguising my last instructions under the commonplace heading of “
90335	90963	90965	90965	me	0	” I began to write . I had filled one page of the pocket - book , and had just turned to the next , when I became conscious of a difficulty in fixing my attention on the subject that was before it . I was at once reminded of the similar difficulty which I felt in Shetland , when I had tried vainly to arrange the composition of the letter to my mother which Miss Dunross was to write . By way of completing the parallel , my thoughts wandered now , as they had wandered then , to my latest remembrance of Mrs. Van Brandt . In a minute or two I began to feel once more the strange physical sensations which I had first experienced in the garden at Mr. Dunross ’s house . The same mysterious trembling shuddered through me from head to foot . I looked about me again , with no distinct consciousness of what the objects were on which my eyes rested . My nerves trembled , on that lovely summer night , as if there had been an electric disturbance in the atmosphere and a storm coming . I laid my pocket - book and pencil on the table , and rose to go out again under the trees . Even the trifling effort to cross the room was an effort made in vain . I stood rooted to the spot , with my face turned toward the moonlight streaming in at the open door . An interval passed , and as I still looked out through the door , I became aware of something moving far down among the trees that fringed the shore of the lake . The first impression produced on me was of two gray shadows winding their way slowly toward me between the trunks of the trees . By fine degrees the shadows assumed a more and more marked outline , until they presented themselves in the likeness of two robed figures , one taller than the other . While they glided nearer and nearer , their gray obscurity of hue melted away . They brightened softly with an inner light of their own as they slowly approached the open space before the door . For the third time I stood in the ghostly presence of Mrs. Van Brandt ; and with her , holding her hand , I beheld a second apparition never before revealed to me , the apparition of her child . Hand - in - hand , shining in their unearthly brightness through the bright moonlight itself , the two stood before me . The mother ’s face looked at me once more with the sorrowful and pleading eyes which I remembered so well . But the face of the child was innocently radiant with an angelic smile . I waited in unutterable expectation for the word that was to be spoken , for the movement that was to come . The movement came first . The child released its hold on the mother ’s hand , and floating slowly upward , remained poised in midair — a softly glowing presence shining out of the dark background of the trees . The mother glided into the room , and stopped at the table on which I had laid my pocket - book and pencil when I could no longer write . As before , she took the pencil and wrote on the blank page . As before , she beckoned to me to step nearer to her . I approached her outstretched hand , and felt once more the mysterious rapture of her touch on my bosom , and heard once more her low , melodious tones repeating the words : “
90971	91685	92164	92165	Van Brandt	103	” Her hand dropped from my bosom . The pale light which revealed her to me quivered , sunk , vanished . She had spoken . She had gone . I drew to me the open pocket - book . And this time I saw , in the writing of the ghostly hand , these words only : I looked out again at the lonely night landscape . There , in mid - air , shining softly out of the dark background of the trees , still hovered the starry apparition of the child . Advancing without conscious will of my own , I crossed the threshold of the door . The softly glowing vision of the child moved away before me among the trees . I followed , like a man spellbound . The apparition , floating slowly onward , led me out of the wood , and past my old home , back to the lonely by - road along which I had walked from the market - town to the house . From time to time , as we two went on our way , the bright figure of the child paused , hovering low in the cloudless sky . Its radiant face looked down smiling on me ; it beckoned with its little hand , and floated on again , leading me as the Star led the Eastern sages in the olden time . I reached the town . The airy figure of the child paused , hovering over the house at which I had left my traveling - carriage in the evening . I ordered the horses to be harnessed again for another journey . The postilion waited for his further directions . I looked up . The child ’s hand was pointing southward , along the road that led to London . I gave the man his instructions to return to the place at which I had hired the carriage . At intervals , as we proceeded , I looked out through the window . The bright figure of the child still floated on before me gliding low in the cloudless sky . Changing the horses stage by stage , I went on till the night ended — went on till the sun rose in the eastern heaven . And still , whether it was dark or whether it was light , the figure of the child floated on before me in its changeless and mystic light . Mile after mile , it still led the way southward , till we left the country behind us , and passing through the din and turmoil of the great city , stopped under the shadow of the ancient Tower , within view of the river that runs by it . The postilion came to the carriage door to ask if I had further need of his services . I had called to him to stop , when I saw the figure of the child pause on its airy course . I looked upward again . The child ’s hand pointed toward the river . I paid the postilion and left the carriage . Floating on before me , the child led the way to a wharf crowded with travelers and their luggage . A vessel lay along - side of the wharf ready to sail . The child led me on board the vessel and paused again , hovering over me in the smoky air . I looked up . The child looked back at me with its radiant smile , and pointed eastward down the river toward the distant sea . While my eyes were still fixed on the softly glowing figure , I saw it fade away upward and upward into the higher light , as the lark vanishes upward and upward in the morning sky . I was alone again with my earthly fellow - beings — left with no clew to guide me but the remembrance of the child ’s hand pointing eastward to the distant sea . A sailor was near me coiling the loosened mooring - rope on the deck . I asked him to what port the vessel was bound . The man looked at me in surly amazement , and answered : “
91689	92163	92164	92165	Van Brandt	103	” IT mattered little to me to what port the vessel was bound . Go where I might , I knew that I was on my way to Mrs. Van Brandt . She had need of me again ; she had claimed me again . Where the visionary hand of the child had pointed , thither I was destined to go . Abroad or at home , it mattered nothing : when I next set my foot on the land , I should be further directed on the journey which lay before me . I believed this as firmly as I believed that I had been guided , thus far , by the vision of the child . For two nights I had not slept — my weariness overpowered me . I descended to the cabin , and found an unoccupied corner in which I could lie down to rest . When I awoke , it was night already , and the vessel was at sea . I went on deck to breathe the fresh air . Before long the sensation of drowsiness returned ; I slept again for hours together . My friend , the physician , would no doubt have attributed this prolonged need of repose to the exhausted condition of my brain , previously excited by delusions which had lasted uninterruptedly for many hours together . Let the cause be what it might , during the greater part of the voyage I was awake at intervals only . The rest of the time I lay like a weary animal , lost in sleep . When I stepped on shore at Rotterdam , my first proceeding was to ask my way to the English Consulate . I had but a small sum of money with me ; and , for all I knew to the contrary , it might be well , before I did anything else , to take the necessary measures for replenishing my purse . I had my traveling - bag with me . On the journey to Greenwater Broad I had left it at the inn in the market - town , and the waiter had placed it in the carriage when I started on my return to London . The bag contained my checkbook , and certain letters which assisted me in proving my identity to the consul . He kindly gave me the necessary introduction to the correspondents at Rotterdam of my bankers in London . Having obtained my money , and having purchased certain necessaries of which I stood in need , I walked slowly along the street , knowing nothing of what my next proceeding was to be , and waiting confidently for the event which was to guide me . I had not walked a hundred yards before I noticed the name of “
92166	92271	92272	92275	Mr. Ernest Van Brandt	102	” inscribed on the window - blinds of a house which appeared to be devoted to mercantile purposes . The street door stood open . A second door , on one side of the passage , led into the office . I entered the room and inquired for Mr. Van Brandt . A clerk who spoke English was sent for to communicate with me . He told me there were three partners of that name in the business , and inquired which of them I wished to see . I remembered Van Brandt ’s Christian name , and mentioned it . No such person as “
92276	92283	92272	92275	Mr. Ernest Van Brandt	102	” was known at the office . “
92298	92303	92294	92295	Van Brandt	103	” the clerk explained . “
92329	92436	92325	92325	you	1962	” It mattered nothing to me where I went , so long as I was on my way to Mrs. Van Brandt . It was too late to travel that day ; I slept at a hotel . The night passed quietly and uneventfully . The next morning I set forth by the public conveyance for Amsterdam . Repeating my inquiries at the head office on my arrival , I was referred to one of the partners in the firm . He spoke English perfectly ; and he received me with an appearance of interest which I was at a loss to account for at first . “
92447	92451	92325	92325	you	1962	” he said . “
92475	92484	92485	92485	I	0	” I answered in the affirmative ; adding , “
92503	92521	92522	92522	You	1963	” The merchant ’s next words explained the appearance of interest with which he had received me . “
92527	92531	92522	92522	You	1963	” he said . “
92861	92893	92894	92894	she	2202	” With what breathless interest I listened to these words it is needless to say . Van Brandt had deserted her ! Surely ( as my poor mother had once said ) “
92901	92950	92894	92894	she	2202	” The hopes that had abandoned me filled my heart once more ; the future which I had so long feared to contemplate showed itself again bright with the promise of coming happiness to my view . I thanked the good merchant with a fervor that surprised him . “
92961	92965	92967	92967	I	0	” I said , “
92974	92975	92967	92967	I	0	” “
92985	92990	92967	92967	I	0	” the merchant replied . “
93004	93005	93001	93001	you	0	” “
93010	93011	93001	93001	you	0	” “
93075	95781	93064	93065	the Englishman	1993	” In a few minutes more the clerk and I were on our way to the harbor . Difficulties which I had not anticipated occurred in finding the boat and in engaging a crew . This done , it was next necessary to purchase provisions for the voyage . Thanks to the experience of my companion , and to the hearty good - will with which he exerted it , my preparations were completed before night - fall . I was able to set sail for my destination on the next day . The boat had the double advantage , in navigating the Zuyder Zee , of being large , and of drawing very little water ; the captain ’s cabin was at the stern ; and the two or three men who formed his crew were berthed forward , in the bows . The whole middle of the boat , partitioned off on the one side and on the other from the captain and the crew , was assigned to me for my cabin . Under these circumstances , I had no reason to complain of want of space ; the vessel measuring between fifty and sixty tons . I had a comfortable bed , a table , and chairs . The kitchen was well away from me , in the forward part of the boat . At my own request , I set forth on the voyage without servant or interpreter . I preferred being alone . The Dutch captain had been employed , at a former period of his life , in the mercantile navy of France ; and we could communicate , whenever it was necessary or desirable , in the French language . We left the spires of Amsterdam behind us , and sailed over the smooth waters of the lake on our way to the Zuyder Zee . The history of this remarkable sea is a romance in itself . In the days when Rome was mistress of the world , it had no existence . Where the waves now roll , vast tracts of forest surrounded a great inland lake , with but one river to serve it as an outlet to the sea . Swelled by a succession of tempests , the lake overflowed its boundaries : its furious waters , destroying every obstacle in their course , rested only when they reached the furthest limits of the land . The Northern Ocean beyond burst its way in through the gaps of ruin ; and from that time the Zuyder Zee existed as we know it now . The years advanced , the generations of man succeeded each other ; and on the shores of the new ocean there rose great and populous cities , rich in commerce , renowned in history . For centuries their prosperity lasted , before the next in this mighty series of changes ripened and revealed itself . Isolated from the rest of the world , vain of themselves and their good fortune , careless of the march of progress in the nations round them , the inhabitants of the Zuyder Zee cities sunk into the fatal torpor of a secluded people . The few members of the population who still preserved the relics of their old energy emigrated , while the mass left behind resignedly witnessed the diminution of their commerce and the decay of their institutions . As the years advanced to the nineteenth century , the population was reckoned by hundreds where it had once been numbered by thousands . Trade disappeared ; whole streets were left desolate . Harbors , once filled with shipping , were destroyed by the unresisted accumulation of sand . In our own times the decay of these once flourishing cities is so completely beyond remedy , that the next great change in contemplation is the draining of the now dangerous and useless tract of water , and the profitable cultivation of the reclaimed land by generations that are still to come . Such , briefly told , is the strange story of the Zuyder Zee . As we advanced on our voyage , and left the river , I noticed the tawny hue of the sea , caused by sand - banks which color the shallow water , and which make the navigation dangerous to inexperienced seamen . We found our moorings for the night at the fishing island of Marken — a low , lost , desolate - looking place , as I saw it under the last gleams of the twilight . Here and there , the gabled cottages , perched on hillocks , rose black against the dim gray sky . Here and there , a human figure appeared at the waterside , standing , fixed in contemplation of the strange boat . And that was all I saw of the island of Marken . Lying awake in the still night , alone on a strange sea , there were moments when I found myself beginning to doubt the reality of my own position . Was it all a dream ? My thoughts of suicide ; my vision of the mother and daughter ; my journey back to the metropolis , led by the apparition of the child ; my voyage to Holland ; my night anchorage in the unknown sea — were these , so to speak , all pieces of the same morbid mental puzzle , all delusions from which I might wake at any moment , and find myself restored to my senses again in the hotel at London ? Bewildered by doubts which led me further and further from any definite conclusion , I left my bed and went on deck to change the scene . It was a still and cloudy night . In the black void around me , the island was a blacker shadow yet , and nothing more . The one sound that reached my ears was the heavy breathing of the captain and his crew sleeping on either side of me . I waited , looking round and round the circle of darkness in which I stood . No new vision showed itself . When I returned again to the cabin , and slumbered at last , no dreams came to me . All that was mysterious , all that was marvelous , in the later events of my life seemed to have been left behind me in England . Once in Holland , my course had been influenced by circumstances which were perfectly natural , by commonplace discoveries which might have revealed themselves to any man in my position . What did this mean ? Had my gifts as a seer of visions departed from me in the new land and among the strange people ? Or had my destiny led me to the place at which the troubles of my mortal pilgrimage were to find their end ? Who could say ? Early the next morning we set sail once more . Our course was nearly northward . On one side of me was the tawny sea , changing under certain conditions of the weather to a dull pearl - gray . On the other side was the flat , winding coast , composed alternately of yellow sand and bright - green meadow - lands ; diversified at intervals by towns and villages , whose red - tiled roofs and quaint church - steeples rose gayly against the clear blue sky . The captain suggested to me to visit the famous towns of Edam and Hoorn ; but I declined to go on shore . My one desire was to reach the ancient city in which Mrs. Van Brandt had been left deserted . As we altered our course , to make for the promontory on which Enkhuizen is situated , the wind fell , then shifted to another quarter , and blew with a force which greatly increased the difficulties of navigation . I still insisted , as long as it was possible to do so , on holding on our course . After sunset , the strength of the wind abated . The night came without a cloud , and the starry firmament gave us its pale and glittering light . In an hour more the capricious wind shifted back again in our favor . Toward ten o’clock we sailed into the desolate harbor of Enkhuizen . The captain and crew , fatigued by their exertions , ate their frugal suppers and went to their beds . In a few minutes more , I was the only person left awake in the boat . I ascended to the deck , and looked about me . Our boat was moored to a deserted quay . Excepting a few fishing vessels visible near us , the harbor of this once prosperous place was a vast solitude of water , varied here and there by dreary banks of sand . Looking inland , I saw the lonely buildings of the Dead City — black , grim , and dreadful under the mysterious starlight . Not a human creature , not even a stray animal , was to be seen anywhere . The place might have been desolated by a pestilence , so empty and so lifeless did it now appear . Little more than a hundred years ago , the record of its population reached sixty thousand . The inhabitants had dwindled to a tenth of that number when I looked at Enkhuizen now ! I considered with myself what my next course of proceeding was to be . The chances were certainly against my discovering Mrs. Van Brandt if I ventured alone and unguided into the city at night . On the other hand , now that I had reached the place in which she and her child were living , friendless and deserted , could I patiently wait through the weary interval that must elapse before the morning came and the town was astir ? I knew my own self - tormenting disposition too well to accept this latter alternative . Whatever came of it , I determined to walk through Enkhuizen on the bare chance of meeting some one who might inform me of Mrs. Van Brandt ’s address . First taking the precaution of locking my cabin door , I stepped from the bulwark of the vessel to the lonely quay , and set forth upon my night wanderings through the Dead City . I SET the position of the harbor by my pocket - compass , and then followed the course of the first street that lay before me . On either side , as I advanced , the desolate old houses frowned on me . There were no lights in the windows , no lamps in the streets . For a quarter of an hour at least I penetrated deeper and deeper into the city , without encountering a living creature on my way — with only the starlight to guide me . Turning by chance into a street broader than the rest , I at last saw a moving figure , just visible ahead , under the shadows of the houses . I quickened my pace , and found myself following a man in the dress of a peasant . Hearing my footsteps behind him , he turned and looked at me . Discovering that I was a stranger , he lifted a thick cudgel that he carried with him , shook it threateningly , and called to me in his own language ( as I gathered by his actions ) to stand back . A stranger in Eukhuizen at that time of night was evidently reckoned as a robber in the estimation of this citizen ! I had learned on the voyage , from the captain of the boat , how to ask my way in Dutch , if I happened to be by myself in a strange town ; and I now repeated my lesson , asking my way to the fishing office of Messrs. Van Brandt . Either my foreign accent made me unintelligible , or the man ’s suspicions disinclined him to trust me . Again he shook his cudgel , and again he signed to me to stand back . It was useless to persist . I crossed to the opposite side of the way , and soon afterward lost sight of him under the portico of a house . Still following the windings of the deserted streets , I reached what I at first supposed to be the end of the town . Before me , for half a mile or more ( as well as I could guess ) , rose a tract of meadow - land , with sheep dotted over it at intervals reposing for the night . I advanced over the grass , and observed here and there , where the ground rose a little , some moldering fragments of brickwork . Looking onward as I reached the middle of the meadow , I perceived on its further side , towering gaunt and black in the night , a lofty arch or gateway , without walls at its sides , without a neighboring building of any sort , far or near . This ( as I afterward learned ) was one of the ancient gates of the city . The walls , crumbling to ruin , had been destroyed as useless obstacles that cumbered the ground . On the waste meadow - land round me had once stood the shops of the richest merchants , the palaces of the proudest nobles of North Holland . I was actually standing on what had been formerly the wealthy quarter of Enkhuizen ! And what was left of it now ? A few mounds of broken bricks , a pasture - land of sweet - smelling grass , and a little flock of sheep sleeping . The mere desolation of the view ( apart altogether from its history ) struck me with a feeling of horror . My mind seemed to lose its balance in the dreadful stillness that was round me . I felt unutterable forebodings of calamities to come . For the first time , I repented having left England . My thoughts turned regretfully to the woody shores of Greenwater Broad . If I had only held to my resolution , I might have been at rest now in the deep waters of the lake . For what had I lived and planned and traveled since I left Dermody ’s cottage ? Perhaps only to find that I had lost the woman whom I loved — now that I was in the same town with her ! Regaining the outer rows of houses still left standing , I looked about me , intending to return by the street which was known to me already . Just as I thought I had discovered it , I noticed another living creature in the solitary city . A man was standing at the door of one of the outermost houses on my right hand , looking at me . At the risk of meeting with another rough reception , I determined to make a last effort to discover Mrs. Van Brandt before I returned to the boat . Seeing that I was approaching him , the stranger met me midway . His dress and manner showed plainly that I had not encountered this time a person in the lower ranks of life . He answered my question civilly in his own language . Seeing that I was at a loss to understand what he said , he invited me by signs to follow him . After walking for a few minutes in a direction which was quite new to me , we stopped in a gloomy little square , with a plot of neglected garden - ground in the middle of it . Pointing to a lower window in one of the houses , in which a light dimly appeared , my guide said in Dutch : “
95789	95917	95784	95785	Van Brandt	103	” bowed , and left me . I advanced to the window . It was open , and it was just high enough to be above my head . The light in the room found its way outward through the interstices of closed wooden shutters . Still haunted by misgivings of trouble to come , I hesitated to announce my arrival precipitately by ringing the house - bell . How did I know what new calamity might not confront me when the door was opened ? I waited under the window and listened . Hardly a minute passed before I heard a woman ’s voice in the room . There was no mistaking the charm of those tones . It was the voice of Mrs. Van Brandt . “
95922	95926	95920	95920	darling	1052	” she said . “
95943	95950	95951	95951	I	0	” The child ’s voice answered , “
95958	95959	95951	95951	I	0	” “
96004	96005	95998	95998	I	0	” “
96014	96023	96024	96024	My	0	” the child returned , with strong emphasis . “
96047	96064	96065	96065	You	1052	” The mother answered sharply , as if the child ’s strange words had irritated her . “
96070	96074	96065	96065	You	1052	” she said ; “
96095	96110	96089	96090	Mr. Germaine	74	” I could restrain myself no longer . I called out under the window : “
96116	96151	96111	96112	Mr. Germaine	74	” A CRY of terror from the room told me that I had been heard . For a moment more nothing happened . Then the child ’s voice reached me , wild and shrill : “
96170	96244	96158	96158	I	0	” There was still an interval of hesitation before the mother opened the shutters . She did it at last . I saw her darkly at the window , with the light behind her , and the child ’s head just visible above the lower part of the window - frame . The quaint little face moved rapidly up and down , as if my self - appointed daughter were dancing for joy ! “
96252	96258	96246	96246	I	0	” said Mrs. Van Brandt . “
96265	96266	96262	96263	Mr. Germaine	74	” “
96275	96280	96269	96269	you	0	” cried the child . “
96296	96522	96290	96290	I	0	” There was a world of difference between the coldly doubtful tone of the mother and the joyous greeting of the child . Had I forced myself too suddenly on Mrs. Van Brandt ? Like all sensitively organized persons , she possessed that inbred sense of self - respect which is pride under another name . Was her pride wounded at the bare idea of my seeing her , deserted as well as deceived — abandoned contemptuously , a helpless burden on strangers — by the man for whom she had sacrificed and suffered so much ? And that man a thief , flying from the employers whom he had cheated ! I pushed open the heavy oaken street - door , fearing that this might be the true explanation of the change which I had already remarked in her . My apprehensions were confirmed when she unlocked the inner door , leading from the courtyard to the sitting - room , and let me in . As I took her by both hands and kissed her , she turned her head , so that my lips touched her cheek only . She flushed deeply ; her eyes looked away from me as she spoke her few formal words of welcome . When the child flew into my arms , she cried out , irritably , “
96529	96554	96526	96527	Mr. Germaine	74	” I took a chair , with the little one on my knee . Mrs. Van Brandt seated herself at a distance from me . “
96572	96618	96566	96566	you	74	” she said , turning pale again as suddenly as she had turned red , and keeping her eyes fixed obstinately on the floor . Before I could answer , the child burst out with the news of her father ’s disappearance in these words : “
96646	96655	96636	96636	I	0	” She put her arms round my neck . “
96663	96796	96636	96636	I	0	” she cried , at the shrillest pitch of her voice . The mother looked at us . For a while , the proud , sensitive woman struggled successfully with herself ; but the pang that wrung her was not to be endured in silence . With a low cry of pain , she hid her face in her hands . Overwhelmed by the sense of her own degradation , she was even ashamed to let the man who loved her see that she was in tears . I took the child off my knee . There was a second door in the sitting - room , which happened to be left open . It showed me a bed - chamber within , and a candle burning on the toilet - table . “
96803	96807	96808	96808	I	0	” I said . “
96816	96830	96813	96814	your mamma	1750	” The child pouted : my proposal did not appear to tempt her . “
96838	96842	96813	96814	your mamma	1750	” she said . “
96861	96916	96851	96851	me	0	” Her busy little hands began to search in my coat - pockets . I let her take what she pleased , and so bribed her to run away into the inner room . As soon as she was out of sight , I approached the poor mother and seated myself by her side . “
96924	96928	96921	96921	I	0	” I said . “
96945	96959	96936	96936	he	2006	” She lifted her head instantly ; her eyes flashed through her tears . “
96967	96971	96962	96962	he	2006	” she answered , “
96981	96982	96972	96972	I	0	” “
96985	96989	96972	96972	I	0	” I asked . “
96992	96998	96972	96972	I	0	” she repeated , passionately . “
97020	97075	96972	96972	I	0	” It was hopeless to attempt to reason with her in her present frame of mind . I tried to attract her attention to a less painful subject by referring to the strange succession of events which had brought me to her for the third time . She stopped me impatiently at the outset . “
97091	97095	97084	97084	we	2010	” she answered . “
97123	97124	97116	97116	I	0	” “
97127	97131	97116	97116	I	0	” I said . “
97153	97172	97145	97145	you	0	” That reply roused her . She started , and looked nervously toward the bed - chamber door . “
97178	97182	97145	97145	you	0	” she said . “
97232	97241	97242	97242	I	0	” She paused , leaving the sentence unfinished . “
97251	97255	97242	97242	I	0	” she resumed ; “
97297	97648	97649	97649	She	2018	” I was at a loss to understand the embarrassment which she appeared to feel in putting her question . There was nothing very wonderful , to my mind , in the discovery that she had been in Suffolk , and that she was acquainted with Greenwater Broad . The lake was known all over the county as a favorite resort of picnic parties ; and Dermody ’s pretty cottage used to be one of the popular attractions of the scene . What really surprised me was to see , as I now plainly saw , that she had some painful association with my old home . I decided on answering her question in such terms as might encourage her to take me into her confidence . In a moment more I should have told her that my boyhood had been passed at Greenwater Broad — in a moment more , we should have recognized each other — when a trivial interruption suspended the words on my lips . The child ran out of the bed - chamber , with a quaintly shaped key in her hand . It was one of the things she had taken out of my pockets and it belonged to the cabin door on board the boat . A sudden fit of curiosity ( the insatiable curiosity of a child ) had seized her on the subject of this key . She insisted on knowing what door it locked ; and , when I had satisfied her on that point , she implored me to take her immediately to see the boat . This entreaty led naturally to a renewal of the disputed question of going , or not going , to bed . By the time the little creature had left us again , with permission to play for a few minutes longer , the conversation between Mrs. Van Brandt and myself had taken a new direction . Speaking now of the child ’s health , we were led naturally to the kindred subject of the child ’s connection with her mother ’s dream . “
97656	97662	97649	97649	She	2018	” Mrs. Van Brandt began ; “
97830	97831	97825	97825	you	0	” “
97924	97925	97914	97914	you	0	” “
98093	98144	98146	98146	she	2711	” There was good reason for my feeling startled , and showing it . On the day and at the hour when the child had come to herself , I had stood on the deck of the vessel , and had seen the apparition of her disappear from my view . “
98150	98154	98146	98146	she	2711	” I asked , “
98161	98162	98146	98146	she	2711	” “
98442	98495	98426	98426	We	2048	” It was not easy to return to the topic of her child ’s health . She had revived my curiosity on the subject of her association with Greenwater Broad . The child was still quietly at play in the bedchamber . My second opportunity was before me . I took it . “
98502	98506	98496	98496	I	0	” I began . “
98532	98561	98562	98562	I	0	” As the fatality that pursued us willed it , it was her turn now to be innocently an obstacle in the way of our discovering each other . “
98572	98579	98562	98562	I	0	” she interposed , rising impatiently . “
98625	98654	98655	98655	You	2054	” She turned to enter the bed - chamber . Acting headlong on the impulse of the moment , I took her by the hand and stopped her . “
98661	98665	98655	98655	You	2054	” I said , “
98678	98679	98680	98680	Mine	2054	” “
98682	98686	98680	98680	Mine	2054	” she repeated . “
98692	98693	98689	98689	you	2054	” “
98698	98702	98689	98689	you	2054	” I replied , “
98717	98728	98730	98730	you	2054	” She looked at me half bewildered , half angry . “
98736	98740	98730	98730	you	2054	” she asked . “
98749	98753	98741	98741	I	0	” I answered . “
98762	98779	98780	98780	You	2054	” She advanced a step nearer to me , with her eyes riveted on my face . “
98790	98794	98780	98780	You	2054	” she said . “
98807	98808	98801	98802	the child	2711	” “
98815	98819	98809	98810	The child	2711	” I rejoined , “
98831	98832	98821	98821	I	0	” “
98837	98838	98821	98821	I	0	” “
98843	98844	98821	98821	I	0	” “
98855	98856	98846	98846	you	2054	” “
98870	98871	98867	98868	my wife	144	” “
98878	98879	98867	98868	my wife	144	” “
98965	98985	99017	99017	you	2054	” I tried to take her in my arms . She drew back as if I had frightened her . “
98988	99013	99014	99014	You	2054	” she said , firmly . I whispered my next words , so that the child in the inner room might not hear us . “
99021	99022	99014	99014	You	2054	” “
99028	99029	99023	99023	I	0	” “
99035	99036	99023	99023	I	0	” “
99042	99043	99023	99023	I	0	” “
99047	99067	99023	99023	I	0	” She yielded mechanically ; she kissed me — with cold lips , with big tears in her eyes . “
99074	99081	99082	99082	You	2054	” I burst out , angrily . “
99108	99120	99102	99102	You	2054	” She looked at me sadly , with a patient smile . “
99134	99138	99121	99123	One of us	358	” she said . “
99215	99274	99210	99210	I	0	” I was too passionately in love with her to feel the sympathy on which she evidently counted in saying those words . A man can respect a woman ’s scruples when they appeal to him mutely in her looks or in her tears ; but the formal expression of them in words only irritates or annoys him . “
99283	99289	99290	99290	I	0	” I retorted , coldly . “
99362	99377	99347	99347	My	0	” She dropped into a chair ; her hands fell helplessly into her lap . “
99381	99385	99347	99347	My	0	” she murmured , “
99392	99404	99347	99347	My	0	” She waited a little , and recovered her fatal firmness . “
99407	99411	99347	99347	My	0	” she said . “
99450	99460	99443	99443	God	93	” I made a last appeal to her tenderness . “
99474	99478	99462	99462	you	0	” I asked . “
99586	99619	99583	99584	my wife	144	” She dropped on her knees , and taking my hand put it silently to her lips . I tried to raise her . It was useless : she steadily resisted me . “
99625	99629	99583	99584	my wife	144	” I asked . “
99633	99642	99583	99584	my wife	144	” she said in faint , broken tones , “
99708	99893	99702	99702	I	0	” She let go of my hand , and sank on the floor . The utter despair of that action told me , far more eloquently than the words which she had just spoken , that her resolution was immovable . She had deliberately separated herself from me ; her own act had parted us forever . I MADE no movement to leave the room ; I let no sign of sorrow escape me . At last , my heart was hardened against the woman who had so obstinately rejected me . I stood looking down at her with a merciless anger , the bare remembrance of which fills me at this day with a horror of myself . There is but one excuse for me . The shock of that last overthrow of the one hope that held me to life was more than my reason could endure . On that dreadful night ( whatever I may have been at other times ) , I myself believe it , I was a maddened man . I was the first to break the silence . “
99897	99924	99702	99702	I	0	” I said coldly . She lifted her face from the floor , and looked at me as if she doubted whether she had heard aright . “
99932	99936	99702	99702	I	0	” I resumed . “
99952	99970	99937	99937	I	0	” She rose slowly . Her eyes rested on my face with a dull , bewildered look . “
99982	100015	100016	100016	I	0	” she asked . The child heard her . The child ran up to us with her little hat in one hand , and the key of the cabin in the other . “
100020	100024	100025	100025	I	0	” she said . “
100032	100088	100025	100025	I	0	” Her mother signed to her to go back to the bed - chamber . She went back as far as the door which led into the courtyard , and waited there , listening . I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt with immovable composure , and answered the question which she had addressed to me . “
100093	100097	100089	100089	You	2094	” I said , “
100187	100188	100189	100189	I	0	” “
100197	100201	100189	100189	I	0	” she said . “
100216	100217	100213	100213	you	0	” “
100227	100231	100213	100213	you	0	” I proceeded . “
100285	100405	100279	100279	I	0	” I stopped . The unexpressed idea in my mind was to tell her that she would inherit a legacy under my will , and that she might quite as becomingly take money from me in my life - time as take it from my executors after my death . In forming this thought into words , the associations which it called naturally into being revived in me the memory of my contemplated suicide in the Greenwater lake . Mingling with the remembrance thus aroused , there rose in me unbidden , a temptation so overpoweringly vile , and yet so irresistible in the state of my mind at the moment , that it shook me to the soul . “
100422	100429	100431	100431	your	0	” the fiend in me whispered . “
100450	100746	100431	100431	your	0	” While I was still looking at her , while my last words to her faltered on my lips , the horrible facilities for the perpetration of the double crime revealed themselves enticingly to my view . My boat was moored in the one part of the decaying harbor in which deep water still lay at the foot of the quay . I had only to induce her to follow me when I stepped on the deck , to seize her in my arms , and to jump overboard with her before she could utter a cry for help . My drowsy sailors , as I knew by experience , were hard to wake , and slow to move even when they were roused at last . We should both be drowned before the youngest and the quickest of them could get up from his bed and make his way to the deck . Yes ! We should both be struck together out of the ranks of the living at one and the same moment . And why not ? She who had again and again refused to be my wife — did she deserve that I should leave her free to go back , perhaps , for the second time to Van Brandt ? On the evening when I had saved her from the waters of the Scotch river , I had made myself master of her fate . She had tried to destroy herself by drowning ; she should drown now , in the arms of the man who had once thrown himself between her and death ! Self - abandoned to such atrocious reasoning as this , I stood face to face with her , and returned deliberately to my unfinished sentence . “
100785	100820	100859	100859	Elfie	139	” A change passed over her face as I spoke ; a vague doubt of me began to show itself in her eyes . She drew back a little , without making any reply . “
100826	100830	100859	100859	Elfie	139	” I reiterated . “
100836	100856	100859	100859	Elfie	139	” With that answer , she looked across the room at the child , still waiting by the door . “
100861	100876	100859	100859	Elfie	139	” she said , calling the little creature by one of her favorite nicknames . “
100881	101031	100859	100859	Elfie	139	” I too looked at Elfie . Might she not , I asked myself , be made the innocent means of forcing her mother to leave the house ? Trusting to the child ’s fearless character , and her eagerness to see the boat , I suddenly opened the door . As I had anticipated , she instantly ran out . The second door , leading into the square , I had not closed when I entered the courtyard . In another moment Elfie was out in the square , triumphing in her freedom . The shrill little voice broke the death - like stillness of the place and hour , calling to me again and again to take her to the boat . I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt . The stratagem had succeeded . Elfie ’s mother could hardly refuse to follow when Elfie led the way . “
101038	101042	101033	101033	you	2108	” I asked . “
101054	101081	101082	101082	You	0	” Her eyes rested on me for a moment with a deepening expression of distrust , then looked away again . She began to turn pale . “
101091	101137	101082	101082	You	0	” she said . Without a word more , she took her hat and cloak and went out before me into the square . I followed her , closing the doors behind me . She made an attempt to induce the child to approach her . “
101142	101146	101140	101140	darling	1052	” she said , enticingly—“come
101152	101174	101140	101140	darling	1052	” But Elfie was not to be caught : she took to her heels , and answered from a safe distance . “
101177	101182	101183	101183	you	0	” said the child ; “
101194	101207	101183	101183	you	0	” She retreated a little further , and held up the key : “
101213	101217	101208	101208	I	0	” she cried , “
101223	101263	101208	101208	I	0	” She trotted off a few steps in the direction of the harbor , and waited for what was to happen next . Her mother suddenly turned , and looked close at me under the light of the stars . “
101272	101344	101265	101266	the sailors	2112	” she asked . The question startled me . Had she any suspicion of my purpose ? Had my face warned her of lurking danger if she went to the boat ? It was impossible . The more likely motive for her inquiry was to find a new excuse for not accompanying me to the harbor . If I told her that the men were on board , she might answer , “
101362	101375	101376	101376	They	2116	” I took care to anticipate the suggestion in making my reply . “
101382	101390	101376	101376	They	2116	” I said , watching her carefully ; “
101405	101426	101428	101433	the sailors on board the boat	2119	” To my surprise , she watched me just as carefully on her side , and deliberately repeated her question : “
101435	101485	101428	101433	the sailors on board the boat	2119	” I informed her that the captain and crew slept in the boat , and paused to see what would follow . My reply seemed to rouse her resolution . After a moment ’s consideration , she turned toward the place at which the child was waiting for us . “
101496	101573	101428	101433	the sailors on board the boat	2119	” she said , quietly . I made no further remark . Side by side , in silence we followed Elfie on our way to the boat . Not a human creature passed us in the streets ; not a light glimmered on us from the grim black houses . Twice the child stopped , and ( still keeping slyly out of her mother ’s reach ) ran back to me , wondering at my silence . “
101580	101584	101577	101577	you	2122	” she asked . “
101591	101942	101586	101586	you	2122	” I was incapable of answering her — I could think of nothing but my contemplated crime . Neither fear nor remorse troubled me . Every better instinct , every nobler feeling that I had once possessed , seemed to be dead and gone . Not even a thought of the child ’s future troubled my mind . I had no power of looking on further than the fatal leap from the boat : beyond that there was an utter blank . For the time being — I can only repeat it , my moral sense was obscured , my mental faculties were thrown completely off their balance . The animal part of me lived and moved as usual ; the viler animal instincts in me plotted and planned , and that was all . Nobody , looking at me , would have seen anything but a dull quietude in my face , an immovable composure in my manner . And yet no madman was fitter for restraint , or less responsible morally for his own actions , than I was at that moment . The night air blew more freshly on our faces . Still led by the child , we had passed through the last street — we were out on the empty open space which was the landward boundary of the harbor . In a minute more we stood on the quay , within a step of the gunwale of the boat . I noticed a change in the appearance of the harbor since I had seen it last . Some fishing - boats had come in during my absence . They moored , some immediately astern and some immediately ahead of my own vessel . I looked anxiously to see if any of the fishermen were on board and stirring . Not a living being appeared anywhere . The men were on shore with their wives and their families . Elfie held out her arms to be lifted on board my boat . Mrs. Van Brandt stepped between us as I stooped to take her up . “
101948	101952	101943	101943	We	2124	” she said , “
101964	102050	102051	102051	I	0	” Those words placed it beyond all doubt that she had her suspicions of me — suspicions , probably , which led her to fear not for her life , but for her freedom . She might dread being kept a prisoner in the boat , and being carried away by me against her will . More than this she could not thus far possibly apprehend . The child saved me the trouble of making any remonstrance . She was determined to go with me . “
102057	102066	102067	102067	I	0	” she cried , holding up the key . “
102074	102230	102072	102072	myself	0	” She twisted herself out of her mother ’s hands , and ran round to the other side of me . I lifted her over the gunwale of the boat in an instant . Before I could turn round , her mother had followed her , and was standing on the deck . The cabin door , in the position which she now occupied , was on her left hand . The child was close behind her . I was on her right . Before us was the open deck , and the low gunwale of the boat overlooking the deep water . In a moment we might step across ; in a moment we might take the fatal plunge . The bare thought of it brought the mad wickedness in me to its climax . I became suddenly incapable of restraining myself . I threw my arm round her waist with a loud laugh . “
102233	102243	102072	102072	myself	0	” I said , trying to drag her across the deck—“come
102250	102423	102424	102424	I	0	” She released herself by a sudden effort of strength that astonished me . With a faint cry of horror , she turned to take the child by the hand and get back to the quay . I placed myself between her and the sides of the boat , and cut off her retreat in that way . Still laughing , I asked her what she was frightened about . She drew back , and snatched the key of the cabin door out of the child ’s hand . The cabin was the one place of refuge now left , to which she could escape from the deck of the boat . In the terror of the moment , she never hesitated . She unlocked the door , and hurried down the two or three steps which led into the cabin , taking the child with her . I followed them , conscious that I had betrayed myself , yet still obstinately , stupidly , madly bent on carrying out my purpose . “
102431	102437	102439	102439	I	0	” I thought to myself , “
102449	102548	102439	102439	I	0	” My lamp was burning as I had left it ; my traveling - bag was on the table . Still holding the child , she stood , pale as death , waiting for me . Elfie ’s wondering eyes rested inquiringly on my face as I approached them . She looked half inclined to cry ; the suddenness of the mother ’s action had frightened the child . I did my best to compose Elfie before I spoke to her mother . I pointed out the different objects which were likely to interest her in the cabin . “
102555	102559	102563	102563	yourself	2131	” I said , “
102565	102571	102563	102563	yourself	2131	” The child still hesitated . “
102578	102582	102573	102573	you	2132	” she asked . “
102587	102588	102573	102573	you	2132	” “
102595	102596	102590	102590	you	2132	” “
102600	102608	102573	102573	you	2132	” I turned to Mrs. Van Brandt . “
102618	102758	102612	102612	I	0	” I said . She was perfectly aware , in her critical position , of the necessity of humoring me . Between us , we succeeded in composing the child . She turned away to examine , in high delight , the new and strange objects which surrounded her . Meanwhile her mother and I stood together , looking at each other by the light of the lamp , with an assumed composure which hid our true faces like a mask . In that horrible situation , the grotesque and the terrible , always together in this strange life of ours , came together now . On either side of us , the one sound that broke the sinister and threatening silence was the lumpish snoring of the sleeping captain and crew . She was the first to speak . “
102768	102780	102760	102760	you	2134	” she said , trying to propitiate me in that way , “
102789	102837	102781	102781	I	0	” I unlocked my traveling - bag . As I looked into it for the leather case which held my money , my overpowering desire to get her on deck again , my mad impatience to commit the fatal act , became too strong to be controlled . “
102845	102849	102781	102781	I	0	” I said . “
102858	102901	102902	102902	We	2135	” She showed wonderful courage . I could almost see the cry for help rising to her lips . She repressed it ; she had still presence of mind enough to foresee what might happen before she could rouse the sleeping men . “
102913	102917	102902	102902	We	2135	” she answered . “
102945	103105	102943	102943	herself	139	” Her eyes rested on me as she spoke . Something in the expression of them quieted me for the time . I was able to pause and think . I might take her on deck by force before the men could interfere . But her cries would rouse them ; they would hear the splash in the water , and they might be quick enough to rescue us . It would be wiser , perhaps , to wait a little and trust to my cunning to delude her into leaving the cabin of her own accord . I put the bag back on the table , and began to search for the leather money - case . My hands were strangely clumsy and helpless . I could only find the case after scattering half the contents of the bag on the table . The child was near me at the time , and noticed what I was doing . “
103113	103124	102943	102943	herself	139	” she burst out , in her frankly fearless way . “
103136	103266	102943	102943	herself	139	” I granted the request impatiently . Elfie ’s restless desire to be always doing something , instead of amusing me , as usual , irritated me now . The interest that I had once felt in the charming little creature was all gone . An innocent love was a feeling that was stifled in the poisoned atmosphere of my mind that night . The money I had with me was mostly composed of notes of the Bank of England . Carefully keeping up appearances , I set aside the sum that would probably be required to take a traveler back to London ; and I put all that remained into the hands of Mrs. Van Brandt . Could she suspect me of a design on her life now ? “
103274	103278	102943	102943	herself	139	” I said . “
103295	103338	103288	103290	Messrs. Van Brandt	136	” She took the money mechanically . Her hand trembled ; her eyes met mine with a look of piteous entreaty . She tried to revive my old tenderness for her ; she made a last appeal to my forbearance and consideration . “
103344	103354	103339	103339	We	2141	” she said , in low , trembling tones . “
103382	103426	103339	103339	We	2141	” She offered me her hand . I looked at her without taking it . I penetrated her motive in appealing to my old regard for her . Still suspecting me , she had tried her last chance of getting safely on shore . “
103438	103446	103339	103339	We	2141	” I answered , with ironical politeness . “
103467	103475	103453	103453	you	0	” I looked round at the child . “
103481	103485	103479	103479	Elfie	139	” I said ; “
103492	103508	103486	103487	your mamma	1750	” I opened the cabin door , and offered my arm to Mrs. Van Brandt . “
103519	103523	103486	103487	your mamma	1750	” I resumed . “
103546	103579	103541	103541	Pray	140	” She started back . For the second time she was on the point of crying for help , and for the second time she kept that last desperate alternative in reserve . “
103588	103609	103580	103580	I	0	” she said , her eyes wild with fear , a forced smile on her lips , as she spoke . “
103631	103714	103715	103715	My	0	” She turned away to get nearer to the child , under pretense of looking round the cabin . I stood on guard before the open door , watching her . She made a second pretense : she noisily overthrew a chair as if by accident , and then waited to discover whether her trick had succeeded in waking the men . The heavy snoring went on ; not a sound of a person moving was audible on either side of us . “
103721	103728	103715	103715	My	0	” I said , smiling significantly . “
103753	103932	103933	103933	Mamma	1997	” She made no reply . My patience was exhausted . I left the door and advanced toward her . She retreated in speechless terror , passing behind the table to the other end of the cabin . I followed her until she had reached the extremity of the room and could get no further . She met the look I fixed on her ; she shrunk into a corner , and called for help . In the deadly terror that possessed her , she lost the use of her voice . A low moaning , hardly louder than a whisper , was all that passed her lips . Already , in imagination , I stood with her on the gunwale , already I felt the cold contact of the water — when I was startled by a cry behind me . I turned round . The cry had come from Elfie . She had apparently just discovered some new object in the bag , and she was holding it up in admiration , high above her head . “
103937	103944	103935	103935	mamma	1997	” the child cried , excitedly , “
103964	104061	103933	103933	Mamma	1997	” Her mother ran to her , eager to seize the poorest excuse for getting away from me . I followed ; I stretched out my hands to seize her . She suddenly turned round on me , a woman transformed . A bright flush was on her face , an eager wonder sparkled in her eyes . Snatching Elfie ’s coveted object out of the child ’s hand , she held it up before me . I saw it under the lamp - light . It was my little forgotten keepsake — the Green Flag ! “
104068	104100	103933	103933	Mamma	1997	” she asked , in breathless anticipation of my reply . Not the slightest trace was left in her face of the terror that had convulsed it barely a minute since ! “
104107	104179	104103	104103	you	2156	” she repeated , seizing me by the arm and shaking me , in the ungovernable impatience that possessed her . My head turned giddy , my heart beat furiously under the conflict of emotions that she had roused in me . My eyes were riveted on the green flag . The words that I wanted to speak were words that refused to come to me . I answered , mechanically : “
104190	104246	104103	104103	you	2156	” She dropped her hold on me , and lifted her hands with a gesture of ecstatic gratitude . A lovely , angelic brightness flowed like light from heaven over her face . For one moment she stood enraptured . The next she clasped me passionately to her bosom , and whispered in my ear : “
104258	104367	104252	104252	I	0	” The shock of discovery , following so closely on all that I had suffered before it , was too much for me . I sank , fainting , in her arms . When I came to myself I was lying on my bed in the cabin . Elfie was playing with the green flag , and Mary was sitting by me with my hand in hers . One long look of love passed silently from her eyes to mine — from mine to hers . In that look the kindred spirits were united ; The Two Destinies were fulfilled . THERE was a little introductory narrative prefixed to “
104372	104552	104553	104554	Mary Germaine	141	” which you may possibly have forgotten by this time . The narrative was written by myself — a citizen of the United States , visiting England with his wife . It described a dinner - party at which we were present , given by Mr. and Mrs. Germaine , in celebration of their marriage ; and it mentioned the circumstances under which we were intrusted with the story which has just come to an end in these pages . Having read the manuscript , Mr. and Mrs. Germaine left it to us to decide whether we should continue our friendly intercourse with them or not . At 3 o’clock P.M. we closed the last leaf of the story . Five minutes later I sealed it up in its cover ; my wife put her bonnet on , and there we were , bound straight for Mr. Germaine ’s house , when the servant brought a letter into the room , addressed to my wife . She opened it , looked at the signature , and discovered that it was “
104556	104633	104634	104635	DEAR MADAM	2985	” Seeing this , we sat down side by side to read the letter before we did anything else . On reflection , it strikes me that you may do well to read it , too . Mrs. Germaine is surely by this time a person in whom you feel some interest . And she is on that account , as I think , the fittest person to close the story . Here is her letter : “
104667	104742	104654	104654	you	2985	“ After you went away last night , my husband decided on taking this journey . Seeing how keenly he felt the insult offered to me by the ladies whom we had asked to our table , I willingly prepared for our sudden departure . When Mr. Germaine is far away from his false friends , my experience of him tells me that he will recover his tranquillity . That is enough for me . “
104840	104919	104814	104816	The good lady	685	“ You have probably by this time read the narrative which I have committed to your care . I hardly dare ask how I stand in your estimation now . Is it possible that I might have seen you and your good husband if we had not left London so suddenly ? As things are , I must now tell you in writing what I should infinitely have preferred saying to you with your friendly hand in mine . “
105123	105302	105112	105112	you	2185	“ I inform you of what has happened without making any comment . Mr. Germaine ’s narrative has already told you that I foresaw the deplorable consequences which might follow our marriage , and that I over and over again ( God knows at what cost of misery to myself ) refused to be his wife . It was only when my poor little green flag had revealed us to each other that I lost all control over myself . The old time on the banks of the lake came back to me ; my heart hungered for its darling of happier days ; and I said Yes , when ( as you may think ) I ought to have still said No . Will you take poor old Dame Dermody ’s view of it , and believe that the kindred spirits , once reunited , could be parted no more ? Or will you take my view , which is simpler still ? I do love him so dearly , and he is so fond of me ! “
105432	105503	105509	105509	I	0	“ You talked of traveling on the Continent when you dined with us . If you should wander our way , the English consul at Naples is a friend of my husband ’s , and he will have our address . I wonder whether we shall ever meet again ? It does seem hard to charge the misfortunes of my life on me , as if they were my faults . “
105576	105675	105676	105677	MARY GERMAINE	141	“ The traveling - carriage is at the door : I must say good - by . My husband sends to you both his kindest regards and best wishes . His manuscript will be quite safe ( when you leave London ) if you send it to his bankers , at the address inclosed . Think of me sometimes — and think of me kindly . I appeal confidently to your kindness , for I do n’t forget that you kissed me at parting . Your grateful friend ( if you will let her be your friend ) , “
105679	105725	105676	105677	MARY GERMAINE	141	” We are rather impulsive people in the United States , and we decide on long journeys by sea or land without making the slightest fuss about it . My wife and I looked at each other when we had read Mrs. Germaine ’s letter . “
105730	105753	105760	105760	she	2200	” I remarked , and waited to see what came of it . My wife read my remark the right way directly . “
