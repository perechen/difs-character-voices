29970	37348	37367	37369	the old man	1380	’ frist in these fair meadows , when I return from the outermost marches of the south , whereto I am now wending . But when the battle is done , then let all men bow to the judgment of God , whether he be well content or not , and this on peril of life and limb . And now let there be deep peace between all men meanwhile ; and if any break the peace , be he high or low , rich or unrich , churl or earl , I swear it by the souls of my fathers that he shall lose nought save his life therefor . At these words was there a rumour of yeasay , and all men were content , save we three poor maidens , into whose hearts had now entered fear of loss and death . But our kindreds on both sides were glad and proud , and they were not so bitter against us as they had been ; they put hand to pouch , and let rear for us a fair pavilion of painted timber , all hung with silk and pictured cloths and Saracen tapestry , by the very lake - side ; and gay boats gaily bedight lay off the said pavilion for our pleasure ; and when all was done , it yet lacked a half month of the day of battle , and thither were we brought in triumph by the kindreds on a fair day of May , and there was not a sword or a spear amongst the whole company , and peaceful and merry was all by seeming . But we were not suffered to meet our lovers all this while , from the time when the mote was . Now on a day came a messenger on the spur , and did us to wit that the king would be with us on the morrow , and that the day after , the fateful field should be foughten . Then , though the coming of this day had been so longed for by us , yet now it was at hand it cast us into all unrest and trouble , so that we scarce knew whether to go , or stand , or sit , or what to do with our bodies . Our folk , and all other men withal , were so busy making ready for the morrow of tomorrow , that they left us alone to wear through the day as we might . Now it was afternoon , and the day hot and hazy , and we stood on the very lip of the land wearied with hope and fear , and striving to keep good countenance to each other ; and there came a boat unto the shore gaily painted and gilded , and bedight with silken cloths and cushions ; and the steerer thereof was a woman , not young , by seeming of fifty winters ; red - haired she was , thin - lipped and narrow - eyed , flat - breasted and strait - hipped ; an ungoodly woman , though her skin was white and smooth as for her age . Hast thou ever seen such an one , guest ? Said Birdalone , smiling : Forsooth that have I ; for such an one is my mistress to behold . Well , said Atra , this dame stretched out her hands to us , and said : Will not the pretty ladies , the dear ladies , who have nought on hand this afternoon , come into my boat and look on the face of the water , so calm and fair as it is , and let their lovely hands go over the gunwale and play with the ripple , and so beguile this heavy time for a two hours ; and then give a little gift of a piece or two of silver to a poor carline , who loveth all fair ladies and bright warriors , and who needeth a little livelihood ? Now the woman seemed nought lovely unto us , and to me forsooth she seemed hateful ; but we looked on each other , and we found that we were utterly weary of going up and down on the meadow , and lying about in the pavilion , and it seemed as if this would give us a little rest ; withal we saw not that the woman could do us any hurt , whereas we were three , and strong enough as women go ; nor were we mariners so evil but that we might sail or steer a boat at a pinch . So we stepped into the boat straightway , and the woman sat aft and paddled deftly with the steering oar , and we glided away from the land . Soon we were come so far that we could but just see our pavilion through the haze , which had somewhat thickened , and we said to the woman that she should go about and make for the shore , and that then we would go to and fro a while along by our stead . She nodded yeasay , and began by seeming to dight the craft for return . But therewith the haze was grown suddenly into a low cloud , which came down upon us from the south - west in the arms of a cold breeze , that grew stronger every minute , so no wonder it was though the steerer might not keep head to wind ; and then who was afraid and ashamed save ourselves ? But the woman said , and there seemed to be a mock in her voice : Ill luck , pretty ladies ! Now is there nought for it but to drive , if we would not drown . But belike this duskiness will clear presently , and then at least we shall know whither we be going ; and we may either turn back , or seek some other shelter , for I know the lake well ; I know , I know . We were too terror - stricken to speak , for we felt that still the wind grew stronger , and the lake began to rise into waves , and the craft to wallow ; but well - nigh therewith was the dusk and the mist gone ; the sky was bright blue overhead , and the westering sun shone cloudless ; but on no land it shone , or on aught save the blue waters and the white wave - crests . Then wept Aurea , and this Viridis here , but as to me , I grew wroth and cried out to the steerer : Accursed carline ! thou hast betrayed us ; never now may we get back to our pavilion till the fight is foughten , and our lovers will deem that we have forsaken them , and we are shamed for ever . Well , well , said the carline , what remedy save patience for the winds and waves ? And she laughed mockingly . Quoth I : There is this remedy , that we three arise and lay hands on thee , and cast thee outboard , save thou straightway turn the boat ’s head and back to the main . Forsooth I doubt not but that as thou hast raised this foul wind against us , thou canst raise a fair wind for us . Hearken to the lovely lady ! quoth the carline , how she deemeth me to be none other than the great God himself , to hold the winds in the hollow of my hand , and still the waves with a word ! What ! am I wrought somewhat after his image , kind ladies ? And she grinned horribly therewith . Then she said again : As to thy remedy , sweetling , meseemeth it nought . For how shall ye sail this stormy water when your captain is gone , and ye but holiday sailors belike ? As she spake , a great wave came up from the windward , and brake over us , and half filled the craft , and lifted her bows up towering , and then down we went into the trough ; and I sat cowed and quaking , and spake never another word . Now began the sun to sink , and the wind abated , and the sea went down , but the boat sped on as swift as ever over the landless waters . Now the sun was down , and dusk was at hand , and the carline spake , and drew a bright - gleaming sax from under her raiment : Damsels , I warn you that now it were best that ye obey me in all things ; for though ye be three and I one , yet whereas I have here an edge - friend , I may take the life of any one of you , or of all three , as simply as I could cut a lamb ’s throat . Moreover it will serve you better in the house whereto ye are wending , that I make a good tale of you rather than a bad . For the mistress of that house is of all might ; and I must say it of her , though she is my very sister , yet she is not so sweet - tempered and kind of heart as I am , but somewhat rough and unyielding of mood , so that it is best to please her . Wherefore , maidens , I rede you be sage . Our unhappy hearts were now so sunken in wan - hope , that we had no word wherewith to answer her , and she spake : Now obey ye my bidding and eat and drink , that ye may come hale and sound to your journey ’s end , for I would not give starvelings to my dear sister . Therewith she brought forth victual for us , and that nought evil , of flesh and bread , and cheese and cakes , and good wine withal ; and we were hunger - weary as well as sorrow - weary ; and hunger did at that moment overcome sorrow , so we ate and drank , and , would we , would we not , something of heart came back to us thereby . Then again spake the carline : Now my will is that ye sleep ; and ye have cushions and cloths enough to dight you a fair bed ; and this bidding is easy for you to obey . Forsooth , so weary were we with sorrow , and our hunger was now quenched , that we laid us down and slept at once , and forgat our troubles . When we awoke it was after the first dawn , and we were come aland even where thou didst this morning , guest . And thou mayst deem it wondrous , but so it was , that close to where our boat took land lay the ferry which brought thee hither . Now the carline bade us get ashore , and we did so , and found the land wondrous fair , little as that solaced us then . But she said unto us : Hearken ! now are ye come home ; and long shall ye dwell here , for never shall ye depart hence save by the will of my sister and me , wherefore , once more , I rede you be good , for it will be better for you . Go forth now unto yonder house , and on the way ye shall meet the Queen of this land , and ye have nought to do but to say to her that ye are the Gift ; and then shall she see to your matter . Therewith she gat into her own craft , the Sending Boat , and therein did the deed and spake the words ye wot of , and was gone north - away ; and when we turned to seek for our boat wherein we had come hither , it was gone . We stood miserably for a while on the lip of the land , and then I said that we might as well go meet our fate as die there of grief and hunger . So we went , and came into those fair gardens , and as we went slowly up toward the house came on us a woman clad in red scarlet and grandly dight . A big woman she was , and like to her that beguiled us , but far younger and fairer of favour , foolish and proud of visage . She stared on us , and seemed half afeard of us at first , but asked us what we were , and I answered that we were the Gift . The Gift ? said she , what meaneth that ? Will ye obey me in all things ? If ye gainsay it , ye will perish , unless ye can eat grass ; for on this isle everything cometh from my hand . What might we do ? We all knelt down before her , and swore to do her will . Then she said , after she had stared on us a while : Now I know : ye are they of whom my sister spake , that she would fetch me a gift of a leash of damsels for my service . Now I take the Gift and thank her good heart . But if ye would do my will , then . . . But she broke off here and stared at us a long while , and then she said : Now I know ; she bade me treat you well , and hold my hand from you , or evil would come of it , belike at last my bane . So go ye home to the house , and I will give you meat and drink , and show you my stores and the Wonder - coffer , and ye shall serve me in honour . Even so did we ; and we ate and drank and rested , and nought we lacked , save leave to depart home to our lovers , and some mistress better than this stupid and proud lump of flesh . But the next morning when we came before the lady , she knew nought of what we were ; and again we had to tell her that we were the Gift , and again she glared at us balefully , and again she called to mind her sister and her rede concerning us . And this went on for many days , till at last she got to know what we were ; and she followed her sister ’s rede in that she never mishandled us , though we could see that it irked her to forbear , nor did she speak to us more roughly than her fool ’s wo nt was ; and we had in our hands all that was needed for our sustenance , and lived easily enough . Now our coming hither betid three years ago , and a month thereafter comes thy witch hither in her ferry , and she greeted us when we met , and asked us , grinning , had she not been kind to win us such good days ? Yea , and over kind , said she , ye would deem me , knew ye what would have betid you save for my good word . Forsooth we deemed it no kind deed to steal us from our lovers ; but we kept good tongues in our heads , for thralls must needs kiss the rod . She went away in two days , but came again many times thereafter , till we won the secret of the Sending Boat , and her spell therewith ; but we knew not that was banned against us . Wherefore on a day in the grey of the morning , when we had been on this isle somewhat less than a year , we went down to it and stepped in , and reddened stem and stern and said the spell - words . But straightway arose an hideous braying and clatter , and thunder came therewith , and trembling of the earth , and the waters of the lake arose in huge waves ; nor might we move from our seats in the boat till the two witches came running down to us , and haled us out ashore , and had us up into the house , and into this very prison - chamber , wherein we are now sitting so merry . And here we bore what was laid upon us , whereof , dear guest , we shall tell thee nought . But this came of it , that never thereafter durst we try the adventure of the Sending Boat , but have lived on in lazy sorrow and shameful ease , till thou , dear guest and sister , wert sent hither by heaven for our helping . Now what became of the king ’s court , and the hazelled field of our champions , we wot not , or whether they be yet alive we can not tell thee ; but if they be alive , it is to them that we would have thee do our errand , and thereof will we tell thee closely tomorrow . And so , sweetling , an end of my tale . Chapter VII ~ The Three Damsels Take Birdalone Out of the Witch ’s Prison Birdalone thanked Atra much for her tale , and strange it was to her to hear of such new things and the deeds of folk ; but the dealing of the witches with those three was familiar to her and was of her world . Now they talked merrily , till there came a footstep to the door and one without knocked . Viridis paled thereat , and a pang of fear smote Birdalone , and she swiftly got from out the chair and sat down on a stool ; but when Atra opened , it was but Aurea come from her service to bid Atra take her place . So she went , and again was there pleasant converse betwixt Aurea and the other twain ; and certain matters did Aurea tell Birdalone which had been left untold by Atra . And chiefly , when Birdalone asked if any other folk had come into the isle while they dwelt there , she said yea ; once had come a knight with a lady , his love , fleeing from war and mishap , and these had the witch overcome by wizardry , and destroyed them miserably : and that again another had strayed thither , and him also the witch undid , because he would not do her will and lie in her bed . Withal had come drifting there a young damsel , a castaway of the winds and waves ; her the witch kept as a thrall , and after a while took to mishandling her so sorely , that at last , what for shame and what for weariness of life , she cast herself into the water and was drowned . None of these folk might the damsels help so as to do them any good , though they tried it , and went nigh to suffer therefor themselves . Now the day wore , and in a while Atra came back , and Viridis must serve . At last the dusk and the dark was come . Then said Atra : Now must we twain begone to wait upon our lady , as the wo nt is : and that is now for our good hap , for if we be with her all three , and especially , to say sooth , if I be with her , we may well keep her from visiting thee here ; since belike she shall yet dimly remember that thou art in her prison . Therefore thou must forgive it if I shackle thy wrists again . And now if thou wilt follow my rede , thou shalt try to sleep some deal , and it were well if thou might’st sleep till we come for thee in the grey dawn . Therewith they left her there , and she nestled in the corner once more , and there did verily fall asleep , and slept till the key in the lock and the opening door awakened her , and Atra came stealing soft - footed into the prison . Eager she was and panting , and she kneeled before Birdalone and unlocked her leg - shackles , and then stood up and did the like by the irons on her wrists . Then she said : Look up , dear friend , to thy prison windows , and behold the dawn beginning to break on the day of thy deliverance , and ours maybe . But come now at once : and again , wilt thou pardon me , that we clothe thee not here for thy journey ? For from our own bodies must we clothe thee , and if by any hap our lady were to see any one of us more or less unclad , it might draw her on to see what was toward , and we might yet be found out , for our undoing . Therewith she took her hand , and led her forth of the prison , and locked the door behind her ; and then downstairs they went , and out - a - doors by a little wicket at the stair - end . The dawn drew on apace now , and Birdalone saw at once the other twain lurking in the wall - nook hard by . No word was spoken between them , and with noiseless feet they went forth into the orchard , where the blackbirds and thrushes were beginning their first morning song , and ere they came out on to the meadow the full choir of them was a - singing . Chapter VIII ~ In What Wise Birdalone Was Clad , and How She Went Her Ways from the Isle of Increase Unsought When they were all clear of the orchard trees the three damsels kept Birdalone between them closely , so that her white body should not be seen if the lady were awake and looking forth . Thus they brought her to where a few thorn - bushes made a cover for them close to the water ’s edge , some twenty yards from the Sending Boat . There they stood together , and Atra said : Now , dear guest , and dearest messenger , it is our matter to clothe thee from our very bodies ; and do thou , Viridis , begin . Viridis came forward blushing , as her wo nt was , and took off her green gown and laid it on the grass ; then she set her hand to her smock , and did it off , and stood naked , knee set to knee , and swaying like the willow branch ; and then was seen all the dainty fashion of her body , and how lovely of hue and sweet of flesh she was . But she said : Dear sister Birdalone , here is my smock , which I lend thee , but as to my love , I give it thee therewith ; therefore grudge it not , though thou give me back the linen , for happy will be the day to me when I have it again ; for now none may do it on me save the Green Knight , my own love . Therewith she gave her the smock , and kissed her , and Birdalone did it on , and felt the valianter and mightier when she had a garment upon her . Then Aurea did off her golden gown , and stood in smock alone , so that her naked arms shone more precious than the golden sleeves that had covered them . And she spake : Birdalone , dear messenger , take now my golden gown , and send it back to me when thou hast found the man unto whom it is due ; and think meanwhile that , when thou wearest it , thou wearest my love , and that when thou pullest it off , thou art clad with my love instead of it . So Birdalone did on the gown , and became to look on as the daintiest of the queens of the earth ; and she turned her head about to look on her gold - clad flanks , and wondered . Thereafter Atra knit up her skirts into her girdle , and then did off her shoon , so that her slim feet shone like pearls on the green grass ; and she said : Birdalone , sweet friend ! wilt thou be my messenger to bear these shoon to my Black Squire , and meanwhile put my love for thee under thy feet , to speed thee and to bear thee up ? Wherefore be good to me . Birdalone then shod herself , and though pity it were to hide her feet from the eyes of Earth , yet felt she the stouter - hearted thereby , and her cheeks flushed and her eyes brightened . Thereafter Aurea gave her withal a golden collar for the neck , and Viridis a girdle of silver well - wrought , and Atra a gold finger - ring set with a sapphire stone ; and all these she did on her ; but yet she knew that they were tokens to be delivered to the three lovers according as was due . Then spake Atra : Lo , sister , we pray thee to bear these lendings on thy body in such wise that when thou comest to the mainland they may be seen by knights seeking adventures , and that thou mayst answer to any who may challenge thee thereof and say that thou bearest this raiment and these jewels from Aurea and Viridis and Atra to Baudoin the Golden Knight , and to Hugh the Green Knight , and to Arthur the Black Squire . And if thou deem that thou hast found these , then shall they tell thee a token , such as we shall tell thee , that they be truly these and none other ; and thereafter , when thou art made sure , they shall take of thee the raiment , the gems , and the Sending Boat , and come hither if they may . And God look to the rest ! But as for the token to be told aforesaid , we have determined that each of us shall tell thee privily what question thou shalt ask for her , and what answer thou must look for . When she had done speaking , each came up to Birdalone and spake something into her ear amidst blushes enough forsooth . And what they said will be seen hereafter . Then again said Atra : Now by this errand shall we be well paid for the care we have had of thee . It may be , forsooth , that thou shalt not find our speech - friends ; for they may be dead , or they may deem us untrue , and may have forsaken us and their land ; and in any such case thou art free of our errand ; but whatsoever may betide us , God speed thee ! Then Viridis drew forth a basket from under a bush , and said : We know not how long thy voyage may be , but some little provision for the way we may at least give thee : now wilt thou bear this aboard thyself ; for we dare not touch thy craft , nay , nor come nigh it , no one of us . And she set down the basket and cast her arms about her , and kissed her and wept over her ; and the other twain , they also kissed her lovingly . Birdalone wept even as Viridis , and said : May ye do well , who have been so kind to me ; but now am I both so glad and so sorry , that the voice of me will not make due words for me . O farewell ! Therewith she took up her basket , and turned and went speedily to the Sending Boat ; and they beheld her how she stepped aboard and bared her arm , and drew blood from it with the pin of her girdle - buckle , and therewith reddened stem and stern ; and a pang of fear smote into their hearts lest their lady had banned it for Birdalone as for them . But Birdalone sat down on the thwart , and turned her face south , and spake : The red raven - wine now Hast thou drunk , stern and bow ; Awake then , awake ! And the southward way take : The way of the Wender forth over the flood , For the will of the Sender is blent with the blood . No cloud barred the gateway of the sun as she spoke ; no wave rose upon the bosom of the lake ; no clatter nor tumult was there ; but the Sending Boat stirred , and then shot out swiftly into the wide water ; and the sun arose as they looked , and his path of light flashed on Birdalone ’s golden gown for a moment , and then it grew grey again , and presently she was gone from before their eyes . So they turned up into the orchard : and now was Viridis of good cheer , and Aurea no less ; but Atra lagged behind , and as she went , some passion took her , she knew not wherefore ; her bosom swelled , her shoulders heaved therewith , and she wept . Chapter IX ~ How Birdalone Came to the Isle of the Young and the Old All went well with Birdalone when she had left the Isle of Increase Unsought , much as it had on her first voyage , save that now she was both clad and victualled , and her heart , if yet it harboured fear , was also full of new and strange hope ; and oft , even as she sat there amidst the waste of waters , she wondered what new longing this was which wrought so sweet a pain in her , that it made her cheeks burn , and her eyes dim , and her hands and her limbs restless . And then would she set her mind to her friends and their errand , and would hope and pray for them ; but again would she fall to picture to herself what manner of men they were who were so sore longed for by those three beauteous women ; and she deemed that since they were thus desired , they must be fairer even than her friends of the isle ; and again the nameless longing overtook her , and held her till it wearied her into sleep . When she awoke again the boat had stayed , and she was come aland ; but the dawn was not yet come , and the night was moonless , yet was there light enough to see , from the water and the stars , that the bows of the boat were lying safe on a little sandy beach . So she stepped out and looked around , and deemed she could see great trees before her , and imagined also dark masses of she knew not what . So she walked warily up the said strand till she came on to soft grass , and smelled the scent of the clover as her foot - soles crushed it . There she sat down , and presently lay along and went to sleep . After a while she awoke , and felt happy and well at ease , and had no will to move : the sun was shining brightly , but had not been up long : the song of birds was all about her , but amidst it she deemed she heard some speech of man , though it were not like to what she had heard in her life before . So she raised herself on her elbow , and looked up and saw a new thing , and sat up now , and beheld and wondered . For there stood before her , gazing wide - eyed on her , two little children , some three winters of age , a man and a woman as it seemed . The man - child with light and fine white - golden hair , falling straight down and square over his brow , and blue - grey eyes which were both kind and merry , and shyly seeking as it were . Plump and rosy he was , sturdy and stout - limbed . No less fair was the woman ; her hair golden - brown , as oft it is with children who grow up dark - haired , and curling in fair little rings all over her head ; her eyes were big and dark grey ; she was thinner than the lad , and somewhat taller . These two babes had between them a milk - white she - goat , and had been playing with her , and now she turned her head to this and that one of them , bleating , as if to crave more of the game ; but they had no eyes for her , but stood staring with might and main on the new - comer and her shining golden gown . Birdalone laughed with joy when she saw the little ones , and a dim memory of the days of Utterhay passed before her : she stretched out a hand to them , and spake softly and caressingly , and the little lad came forward smiling , and took her hand , and made as if he would help her up for courtesy ’s sake . She laughed on him , and arose ; and when she stood up , tall and golden , he seemed somewhat afeard of so big a creature , but stood his ground valiantly . Then she stooped down to him and kissed him , and he naysaid her not , but seemed rather glad when it was over ; but when Birdalone went to the little maid , and kissed her , the child clung to her as if she were her mother , and babbled to her . Then comes the lad to her , and takes her hand , and would draw her away , and speaks to her in his prattle , and she understood him to mean that she should come with him to see the father . So she went , wondering what should next betide ; and the little maiden went on the other side of her , holding by a fold of her skirt . Forsooth the goat followed bleating , not well pleased to be forgotten . Now had Birdalone time to look about her , though the two babes fell to prattling with her in their way , and she thought it sweet to look down on the two little faces that looked up to her so pleased and merry . She was in a grassy plain , somewhat over rough and broken to be called a meadow , and not enough be - timbered to be called a wood ; it rose up a little and slowly as they left the water , but scarce so much as one might call it a hill . Straight before her on the way that they were going went up into the air great masses of grey stone builded by man ’s hand , but looking , even from this way off , ragged and ruinous . It may well be thought that Birdalone wondered what things might lie betwixt the trees and the towers . Now as they went they came on other goats , who seemed tame , and these joined them to their fellow , and suffered the younglings to play with them . Moreover there were rabbits great plenty scuttling in and out of the brakes and the rough ground upon the way , and the younglings beheld them , and the little lad said , after his fashion : Why do the rabbits run away from us , and the goats follow us ? Now , sooth to say , Birdalone scarce knew why , and had no word ready for the child ; but she said at last : Mayhappen they will come to me ; so it was once when I dwelt away from here . Shall I go fetch thee one ? The little ones yeasaid that , though somewhat shyly and doubtfully . Then said Birdalone : Do ye , sweetlings , abide me here , and go not away . They nodded their heads thereat , and Birdalone kilted her skirts and went her ways to some broken bushed ground , where was a many rabbits playing about ; but she went not out of eye - shot of the babes . Before she was well - nigh to the little beasts , she fell to talking to them in a low sweet voice , as had been her wo nt when she was little ; and when they heard it , those who had not scuttled away at first glance of her , fell to creeping little short creeps one to the other , as their manner is when they be alone together and merry ; and they suffered her to come quite amongst them , and crept about her feet while she stood , still talking unto them . Then she stooped down and took up one in her arms and caressed it , and then laid him down and took up another , and so with three or four of them ; and she fell to pushing them , and rolling them over with her foot ; then she turned a little away from them toward the children , and then a little more , and the rabbits fell to following her , and she turned and took up one in her arms , and went straight on toward the children , but turning and talking to the rabbits now and again . As to the babes , she saw the goats , of whom were now a dozen , or thereabouts , standing together in a kind of ring , and the little ones going from one to the other playing with them happily . But presently the lad turned and saw her coming with her tail of little beasts , and he cried out a great Oh and ran toward her straightway , and the maiden after him ; and he held out his arms to have the rabbit she bore , and she gave it to him smiling , and said : Lo now ! here be pretty playmates ; but look to it that ye be soft and kind with them , for they are but feeble people . So the younglings fell to sporting with their new friends , and for a little forgat both goats and golden lady ; but the goats drew nigh , and stood about them bleating , nor durst they run at the rabbits to butt them , because of Birdalone and the little ones . There then stood the slim maiden , tall and gleaming above her little flock ; and her heart was full of mirth and rest , and the fear was all forgotten . But as she looked up toward the grey walls , lo , new tidings to hand ! For she saw an old man with a long white beard slowly coming toward them : she started not , but abode his coming quietly , and as he drew nigh she could see of him that he was big and stark , and , old as he was , not yet bowed with his many years . He stood looking on this Queen and her court silently a while , and then he spake : Such a sight I looked not to see on this Isle of the Young and the Old . She said : But meseemeth it is full meet that these younglings should sport with the creatures . He smiled and said : Such a voice I looked not to hear on the Isle of the Young and the Old . Birdalone became somewhat troubled , and said : Am I welcome here ? for if I be not , I will pray thy leave to depart . He said : Thou art as welcome as the very spring , my child ; and if thou have a mind to abide here , who shall naysay thee ? For surely thou art young ; nay , in regard to me thou art scarce older than babes . All blessings be with thee . But though thou art true and kind , as is clear to be seen by thy playing with these children and the landward beasts in peace and love , yet it may be so that thou hast brought hither somewhat less than peace . And he smiled upon her strangely . She looked somewhat scared at his last words , and said : But how so ? If I might I would bear nought but peace and happiness to any place . The old carle laughed outright now , and said : How so , dear child ? because ladies so sweet and lovesome as thou be sent by love , and love rendeth apart that which was joined together . She wondered at his word , and was bewildered by it , but she held her peace ; and he said : Now we may talk hereof later on ; but the matter to hand now is the quenching of thine hunger ; for I will not ask thee whereby thou camest , since by water thou needs must have come . Wherefore now I bid thee to our house , and these little ones shall go with us , and the three of these horned folk whom we are wo nt to tether amidst the wrack and ruin of what once was fair ; the rest have our leave to depart , and these nibblers also ; for we have a potherb garden by our house , and are fain to keep the increase of the same for ourselves . Birdalone laughed , and shook her skirts at the coneys , and they all scuttled away after the manner of their kind . Thereat the little lad looked downcast and well - nigh tearful , but the maid stamped her foot , and roared well - favouredly . Birdalone did her best to solace her , and plucked a bough from a hawthorn bush far above the little ones ’
43092	43395	43428	43428	she	1616	’ seven hours ago , whereas till that time her bread had lain unbroken in her scrip . Fear and anguish smote her therewith , for she saw that in that dull land , every piece whereof was like every other piece , she must have gone about in a ring , and come back again to where she first turned to make for the northern shore . Yet would she not cast aside all hope , but clad herself in her valiancy . Forsooth she knew it availed nought to try to move on in the twilight ; so she laid herself down on that waste , and made up her mind to sleep if she might , and abide the new day there , and then to strive with the way once more , for belike , she thought , it may be fair tomorrow , and the sun shining . And as she was very weary with tramping the waste all day , she fell asleep at once , and slept the short night through . But when she awoke , and saw what the new day was , her heart fell indeed , for now was she encompassed and shut in with a thick dark mist ( though it seemed to be broad day ) , so that had there been aught to see she would not have seen it her own length away from her . So there she stood , hanging her head , and striving to think ; but the master - thought of death drawing nigh scattered all other thoughts , or made them dim and feeble . Long she stood there ; but suddenly something came into her mind . She set her hand to the fair - broidered pouch which hung from Viridis ’
47815	47998	47795	47795	she	108	’ smock might be the plainer to see : which smock was noteworthy , for the breast thereof was broidered with green boughs , whence brake forth little flames of fire , and all so dainty - wrought as if the faery had done it . Withal she gathered up the gown into her girdle , and let the skirt - hem clear her ankles , so that Atra ’s shoon might be seen at once ; and they were daintily dight with window - work and broidery of gold and green stones , and blue . And forsooth it was little likely that any man should stand before her a minute ere his eyes would seek to her feet and ankles , so clean and kindly as they were fashioned . Therewith she set her hands to her head , and trussed up her hair , and bound it closely to her head , so that it might hide no whit of her borrowed attire . There she stood , with Aurea ’s collar lying on her dear neck , and Viridis ’
49006	52237	48996	48996	his	1341	’ smock ; and thereat she shrank aback somewhat , but said : Sir , it is sooth that the smock is for thee when thou hast answered me a question or two . Meanwhile I pray thee forbear a little ; for , as I trow , all is well , and thou shalt see my dear friend Viridis again . He withdrew him a little , flushed and shamefaced . He was a young man exceeding beauteous , clear - skinned and grey - eyed , with curly golden hair , and he bore his armour as though it were silken cloth . Birdalone looked upon him kindly though shyly , and was glad to the heart ’s root that Viridis had so lovely a man to her darling . As for the Golden Knight , as Birdalone might see now , he stood a little aloof ; he was a very goodly man of some five and thirty winters ; tall he was , broad - shouldered and thin - flanked , black - haired , with somewhat heavy eyebrows , and fierce hawk - eyes ; a man terrible of aspect , when one first beheld him . Now when the Black Squire had hearkened Birdalone ’s word concerning Viridis , he threw himself down on the ground before her , and fell to kissing her feet ; or , if you will , Atra ’s shoon which covered them . When she drew back a little , he rose on one knee and looked up at her with an eager face , and she said : To thee also I have an errand from Atra , thy speech - friend , if thou be Arthur the Black Squire . He spake not , but still gazed on her till she reddened . She knew not whether to deem him less goodly than the other twain . He also was a young man of not over five and twenty years , slim and lithe , with much brown hair ; his face tanned so dark that his eyes gleamed light from amidst it ; his chin was round and cloven , his mouth and nose excellently fashioned ; little hair he had upon his face , his cheeks were somewhat more hollow than round . Birdalone noted of his bare hands , which were as brown as his face , that they were very trim and shapely . Now he rose to his feet , and the three stood together and gazed on her ; as how might they do otherwise ? Birdalone hung her head , and knew not what next to do or say . But she thought within herself , would these three men have been as kind to her as her three friends of the Isle , had she happened on them in like case as she was that time ? And she settled with herself that they would have been no less kind . Now spake the Golden Knight , and said : Will the kind maiden do her errand to us here and now ? for we be eager and worn with trouble . Birdalone looked adown and was somewhat confused . Fair sirs , said she , I will do your will herein . But the Black Squire looked on her and saw that she was troubled , and he said : Your pardon , fair fellows , but is it not so that we have an house somewhat anigh , not ill purveyed of many things ? By your leave I would entreat this kind and dear lady to honour us so much as to enter the Castle of the Quest with us , and abide there so long as she will ; and therein may she tell us all her errand at her leisure ; and already we may see and know , that it may not be aught save a joyous one . Then spake the Golden Knight , and said : I will ask the lady to pardon me , and will now join my prayer to thine , brother , that she come home with us . Lady , he said , wilt thou not pardon me , that in the eager desire to hear tidings of my speech - friend I forgat all else . And therewithal he knelt before her , and took her hand and kissed it ; and for all his fierce eyes and his warrior ’s mien , she deemed him kind and friendly . Then needs must the Green Knight kneel and kiss also , though he had no pardon to crave ; but a fair sweet lad she thought him , and again her heart swelled with joy to think that her friend Viridis had so dear a speech - friend to long for her . Then came the turn of the Black Squire , and by then were the two others turned away a little toward their horses ; and he knelt down on both knees before Birdalone and took her right arm above the wrist , and looked at the hand and kissed it as if it were a relic , but stood not up ; and she stood bending over him , and a new sweetness entered into her , the like of which she had never felt . But as for the Black Squire , it seemed that one hand would not suffice him , and he took her left hand and fell to kissing it , and then both the hands together all over the backs of them , and then the palms thereof , and he buried his face in the two palms , and held them to his cheeks ; and the dear hands suffered it all , and consented to the embracing of his cheeks . But Birdalone deemed that this was the kindest and sweetest of the three kind warriors , and sorry she was when he let go her hands and stood up . His face was flushed , but his speech calm , as he spake so that the other knights might hear him : Now will we straight to the castle , lady , and we will ask thee which of us three thou wilt honour by riding his horse there ; shall it be Baudoin ’s bright bay , or Hugh ’s dapple - grey , or my red roan ? And therewith he took her by the hand and led her toward the horses . But she laughed , and turning a little , pointed to the castle , and said : Nay , sweet lords , but I will fare afoot , such a little way as it is , and I all unwont to the saddle . Spake the Green Knight : If that be so , lady , then shall we three walk afoot with thee . Nay , nay , she said ; I have nought to carry but myself ; but ye have your byrnies and your other armour , which were heavy for you to drag on afoot , even a little way . Moreover , I were fain to see you mount your horses , and ride and run about the meadow with tossing manes and flashing swords , while I trudge quietly toward the gate ; for such things , and so beauteous , are all new unto me , as ye shall learn presently when I tell you my story . Do so much to pleasure me , kind knights . The tall Baudoin nodded to her , smiling kindly , as much as to say that he thought well of her desire . But the Green Knight ran to his horse with a glad shout , and anon was in the saddle with his bright sword in his fist ; then he spurred , and went a - gallop hither and thither over the mead , making his horse turn short and bound , and playing many tricks of the tilt - yard , and crying , A Hugh , A Hugh , for the Green Gown ! The Golden Knight was slower and more staid , but in manywise he showed his war - deftness , riding after Hugh as if he would fall on him , and staying his way just as it became perilous ; and he cried , Baudoin , Baudoin , for Gold - sleeves ! And all this seemed to Birdalone both terrible and lovely . But for the Black Squire , he was slow to let loose Birdalone ’s hand ; but thereafter he was speedy to vault into his saddle , and he made courses over the meadow , but ever came back to Birdalone as she went her ways , riding round and round her , and tossing his sword into the air the while and catching it as it fell . And no less lovely did this seem to Birdalone , and she smiled on him and waved her hand to him . Going slowly in this wise , she came at last to the castle gate ; and now had all those three out - gone her and stood afoot in the wicket to welcome her , and the Golden Knight , who was the oldest of the three , was the speaker of the welcome . Over the threshold of the Castle of the Quest went Birdalone ’s feet then , and she was grown so happy as she had never deemed she should be all her life long . Chapter V ~ Birdalone Has True Tokens from the Champions of the Quest Now they brought Birdalone into a very fair chamber , where was presently everything she might need , save a tiring woman , which , forsooth , was no lack unto her , since never had she had any to help her array her body . So she did what she might to make herself the trimmer ; and in a while came two fair swains of service , who brought her in all honour into the great hall , where were the three lords abiding her . There were they served well and plenteously , and fair was the converse between them ; and in especial was the talk of Arthur the Black Squire goodly and wise and cheery , and well - measured ; and the Green Knight ’s speech merry and kind , as of an happy child ; and the Golden Knight spake ever free and kindly , though not of many words was he . And who was happy if Birdalone were not ? But when they had eaten and washed their hands , then spake the Golden Knight : Dear maiden , now are we ready to hear the innermost of thine errand , all we together , if thou wilt . Birdalone smiled and reddened withal , as she said : Fair lords , I doubt not but ye are even they unto whom I was sent , but they who sent me , and who saved me from death and worse , bade me do mine errand in such a way , that I should speak with each one of you privily , and that for a token each should tell me a thing known but to him and his love , and to me unto whom she hath told it . Now am I all ready to do mine errand thus , and no other wise . Laughed they now , and were merry , and the Green Knight blushed like a maiden ; forsooth like to his very speech - friend Viridis . But the Black Squire said : Fair fellows , get we all into the pleasance this fair morn , and sit there on the grass , and our sweet lady shall take us one after other into the plashed alley , and have the tokens of us . Even so they did , and went into the pleasance , which was a goodly little garth south of the castle , grassed , and set thick with roses and lilies and gillyflowers , and other fragrant flowers . There then they sat on the daisied greensward , the three lords together , and Birdalone over against them , and they three watched her beauty and loveliness and wondered thereat . But she said : Now it comes to the very point of mine errand ; wherefore I bid thee , Baudoin the Golden Knight , to come apart with me and answer to my questions , so that I may know surely that I am doing mine errand aright . Therewith she arose to her feet , and he also , and he led her into the plashed alley , out of earshot of the other twain , who lay upon the grass biding their turn with but little patience . But when those two were in the deep shade of the alley , Birdalone said : Thou must know , Sir Golden Knight , that the three lovers of you three were good to me in my need , and clad my nakedness from their very bodies , but this raiment they lent me , and gave it not ; for they bade me give it up piece by piece each unto the one who had given it to his love , whom I should know by the token that he should tell truly the tale of its giving . Now , fair sir , I know well , for I have been told , what was the tale of thy giving this golden gown to Aurea , and that same tale shalt thou now tell me , and if thou tell it aright , then is the gown thine . Begin , then , without more tarrying . Lady , said the knight , thus it was : Aurea , my sweetling , abode with an ancient dame , a kinswoman of hers , who was but scantly kind to her ; and on a day when we had met privily , and were talking together , my love lamented the niggard ways of her said kinswoman , and told how she had no goodly gown to make her fair when feasts were toward ; but I laughed at her , and told her that so clad as she was ( and her attire was verily but simple ) she was fairer than any other ; and then , as ye may wot , there was kissing and clipping between us ; but at last , as from the first I meant it , I promised her I would purvey her such a gown as no lady should go with a better in all the country - side ; but I said that in return I must have the gown she went in then , which had so long embraced her body and been strained so close to her body and her sides , and was as it were a part of her . That she promised me with kisses , and I went away as merry as a bird . Straightway thereafter I did do make this very gown , which thou bearest , dear maiden , and on the appointed day she came out to me unto the same place clad as she was before ; but the new gown I had with me . Hard by our trysting - place was a hazel - copse thick enow , for it was midsummer , and she said she would go thereinto and shift gowns , and bear me out thence the gift of the old clout ( so she called it , laughing merrily ) . But I said : Nay , I would go into the copse with her to guard her from evil things , beasts or men ; and withal to see her do off the old gown , that I might know before I wedded her whatlike stuffing and padding went to make the grace of her flanks and her hips . And again was she merry , and she said : Come , then , thou Thomas unbelieving , and see the side of me . So we went into that cover together , and she did off her gown before mine eyes , and stood there in her white coat with her arms bare , and her shoulders and bosom little covered , and she was as lovely as a woman of the faery . Then I made no prayer unto her for leave , but took my arms about her , and kissed her arms and shoulders and bosom all she would suffer me , for I was mad with love of her naked flesh . Then she did on this golden gown , and departed when she had given me the old clout aforesaid , and I went away with it , scarce feeling the ground beneath my feet ; and I set the dear gown in a fair little coffer , and here in this castle I have it now , and many times I take it forth and kiss it and lay my head upon it . Now this is a simple tale , lady , and I am ashamed that I have made it so long for thee . And yet I know not ; for thou seemest to me so kind and loving and true , that I am fain that thou shouldest know how sorely I love thy friend and mine . Birdalone deemed Baudoin a good man indeed , and the tears came into her eyes as she answered and said : True is thy tale , dear friend , and I have deemed it rather short than long . I see well that thou art Aurea ’s very lover ; and it joys me to think that thou , O terrible champion , art yet so tender and true . Now is the golden gown thine , but I will pray thee to lend it me a little longer . But this jewel shalt thou have from my neck here and now ; and thou knowest whence it came , thine Aurea ’s neck forsooth . Therewith she betook it him , and he held it in his hand doubtfully a while , and then he said : Dear maiden , I thank thee , but I will take this collar , and lay it in my casket , and be glad thereof ; and that the more , as , now I look on thee , I see nought missing from the loveliness of thine own neck . Go to thy fellows now , said Birdalone , and send me the Green Knight , the goodly lad . So went he , and presently came Hugh thither merry and smiling , and said : Thou hast been long about the first token , sweet mistress ; I fear me I shall make no such goodly story as hath Baudoin . And yet , said she , Viridis ’
56664	59050	59071	59071	she	1985	’ shift and Atra ’s shoon . Rather sunrise than sunset it seemed , as verily Birdalone she came into the hall with bright eager eyes , and flushed cheeks , and countenance smiling with love . The men stood up all , and would come down from the dais to meet her ; but she bade them go back , and sit each in his place till she stood before them . Up the hall then she walked , and every step of hers seemed lovelier than the last , till she came to them and gave unto each his keepsake , and said : Champions , now is mine errand all done , save that tomorrow I must show you the manner of the Sending Boat . Now there is nought save the darkness of the coming night to hinder you from this last deal of your Quest ; and it is I that have brought you to this , and have done this good unto you , if no more good I do in the world . Wherefore I pray you to love me ever , and bear me ever in your minds . They gazed on her , and were overcome by her loveliness and grace , and by the kindness and valiancy of her heart . Next arose the Golden Knight , Baudoin to wit , and took a cross from his breast , and held it up , and spake : Maiden , thou sayest well , and never shall we forget thee , or cease to love thee ; and here I swear by God upon the Tree , that it shall be a light thing for me to die for thee , if in any need I find thee . Brethren , will ye not swear the same ? And this is but thy due , maiden , for I declare unto thee , that when thou didst enter the hall e’en now , it was as if the very sun of heaven was coming in unto us . Thereon the other two took the Rood and swore upon it : and Hugh was hushed and meek and sad - faced after he had sworn ; but Arthur the Black Squire bowed down his head and wept , and his fellows marvelled nought thereat , neither did Birdalone ; and all her body yearned toward him to solace him . Now turned Sir Baudoin to the castellan and said : Sir Aymeris , I will now swear thee to guard this lady as the apple of thine eye whiles we three be away , and therein to spare neither thyself nor others . For thou seest well what grief it would be to us if she came to any harm . And to me also , said the castellan . And therewith he swore upon the Rood , and then came round the table , and knelt before Birdalone , and kissed her hands . Thereafter were they all silent a space ; and then came Birdalone to the inner side of the table and sat betwixt Baudoin and Hugh . But the Black Squire took up the word and spake : Birdalone , sweet child , one thing is to be said , to wit , that it were well that thou keep within walls while we be away ; or at least that thou go but a little beyond the castle , and never but within a half bowshot , save thou be well accompanied . For there be men of violence dwelling no great way off , reivers and rovers , who would be well pleased to take from us anything which we deem dear ; besides others who would think the lifting of such a jewel good hap indeed . Sir Aymeris , have a care of the Red Knight ; and if thou mightest come by a few more stout lads , to wage them , it were well . Birdalone heeded not what the castellan answered , such a shaft of joy went to her heart when she heard that friend speak her own name in such wise as he had never done erst , and that before them all . She but murmured some yeasay to that which Arthur had spoken unto her , and then she held her peace for the sweetness of that moment . So there they sat and talked a while in dear and pleasant converse ; and Hugh fell to asking her of her life in the House under the Wood , and she answered all frankly and simply , and the more she told the dearer she seemed to them . Thus drew night in , till folk came flockmeal into the hall ; for needs must be feast and banquet for triumph of the furtherance of the Quest ; and the most of men were merry ; but somewhat sober were all the three Champions , so that whoso ran might read it in their faces . As for Birdalone , she showed cheerful to all that folk which loved her and praised her ; but inwardly sorrow had come home to her heart . Chapter X ~ The Champions Go Their Ways in the Sending Boat When the sun was arisen on the morrow the three Champions went down to the landing - place , and there was none with them ; for they had given command that no man should pry into their doings . Thither to them cometh Birdalone , clad no more in her gay attire , but in a strait black coat and with unshod feet ; and she looked no sorrier than she was . By Birdalone ’s rede the Champions bore down in their own hands the victual and weapons and armour that they needed for the voyage ; for she knew not but that the Sending Boat might take it amiss that any should touch her save the senders . And when they had done lading her , then all four stood together by the water ’s edge , and Birdalone spake to her friends , and again bade them beware of the wiles of the Isle of Nothing ; and again she told them of the woful images of the Isle of Kings and the Isle of Queens , and the strange folk of the Isle of the Young and the Old . Then she said : Now when ye come to the Isle of Increase Unsought , what think ye to do ? Said the Green Knight : If I might rule , we should go straight up to the witch sitting in her hall , as thou toldest us , my dear , and then and there smite the head from off her . His eyes flashed and his brow knitted , and so fierce he looked that Birdalone shrank back from him ; but the Black Squire smiled and said : It may come to the smiting off of heads in the end ; yet must we so fashion our carving , that it avail us for the freeing of our friends ; else may the witch die , and the secret of the prison - house die with her . How sayest thou , dear Birdalone ? She reddened at the caress of his voice , and answered : By my rede ye shall seek and find your speech - friends ere ye make open war upon the witch ; else may her malice destroy them ere ye undo her . Her face flushed yet more as she spake again : But concerning all things , I deem that Atra may give you the best rede , when ye have met the loves ; for that she knoweth more of the isle and its guiles than the others . Quoth Baudoin : Herein is wisdom , sweet maiden , for as guileless as thou mayst be ; and so far as we may we shall follow thy rede ; but all lieth in the fathom of the coming time . And now this moment is the moment of sundering and farewell . Came he then to Birdalone and took his two hands about her head , and lifted her face unto him , and kissed it kindly , as a father might kiss a daughter , and said : Farewell , dear child , and take heed to the word that Arthur spake yesterday , and go not from the castle even a little way save with good and sure company . Then came Hugh to her , and took her hand somewhat timidly ; but she put up her face to him in simple wise , and he kissed either cheek of her , and said no more than : Farewell , Birdalone ! Lastly came Arthur , and stood before her a little ; and then he knelt down on the stones before her and kissed her feet many times , and she shuddered and caught her breath as they felt his kisses ; but neither he nor she spake a word , and he stood up and turned away at once toward the Sending Boat , and boarded her first of the three ; and the others followed straightway . Thereafter the Champions bared each an arm , and let blood flow thence into a bowl , and reddened stem and stern of their barge , and then all three spake the spell together thus , as Birdalone had taught them : The red raven - wine now Hast thou drunk , stern and bow : Wake then , and awake , And the northern way take ! The way of the Wenders forth over the flood , For the will of the Senders is blent with the blood . Went all as before thereafter , that the Sending Boat stirred under them , and then turned about and pointed her bows to the northward , and sped swiftly over the waters . It was a fair sunny day , with no cloud , nought save the summer haze lying on the lake far away . Birdalone stood watching the speeding of the boat , till she could see it no longer , not even as a fleck on the face of the waters . Then she turned away and went toward her chamber , saying to herself that the sundering was easier to bear than she had deemed it would be , and that she had a many things to do that day . But when she came into her chamber , and shut the door , she looked about her on the things which had grown so familiar to her in these few latter days , and she stood watching the bright sunshine that streamed across the floor and lay warm upon her feet ; then she took three steps toward the window , and saw the lake lying all a - glitter under the sun , and her heart failed her withal , and she had no might so much as to think about her sorrow and caress it , but fell down where she was swooning on to the floor , and lay there , while all the house began to stir about her . Now came Birdalone to herself , and that was but little joy unto her , and she yet lay still on the floor for a while , for she loathed the hour that was to come . Then the life stirred in her , and whereas she would not that her women should find her there , she stood up , and clad herself somewhat more seemly ; yet she did on her black raiment ; and determined in her mind that nought would she wear save black unadorned while her friends were away . She betook her now to the chamber where her women were gathered together , and watched them working a while , but spake nought . Then she went her ways into the pleasance , and paced the plashed alley up and down , letting the tears run down from her as they would . Then she turned back into the castle , and went out - a - gates and walked over the meadow a little , and might well have gone further than wisdom would . But the castellan espied her from a window , and came hurrying out after her , and with many prayers for pardon , brought her back again , babbling to her by the way ; but not a word might he get from her ; and when he came into the hall with her , and , after his wo nt , knelt down to kiss her hands , she caught them away from him peevishly , and was sorry for it thereafter . Long she sat in the hall , scarce moving , till she heard one entering from the screen , and lo it was Leonard the chaplain . He came her way , and showed her rueful countenance ; and pity of him smote her , and she remembered therewith how they first went out of gates together ; and at the thought thereof her tears brake forth again , but she made him a sign with her hand to sit down beside her , and he did so ; and when she might for her weeping , she looked kindly on him , and he fell to talk , making as if he noted not her tears and sorrow ; but she answered him little , for she had shame to begin the talk concerning the Champions and their Quest , and their departure ; yet might she not bring her tongue to make any speech else . But presently he took up the word , and asked her how long a while she deemed they would be away , and she answered , smiling on him for thanks , and having reckoned the days on her fingers : If all go better than well , they may be back in ten days ’
60112	60797	60804	60804	My	0	’ . Maybe Sir Aymeris looked to buy tidings from them as well as beef . Anyhow they departed when they had gotten their money and drunk a cup . And now it is said that the Red Knight hath been hurt in some fray , and keepeth his bed ; wherefore the land shall have peace of him awhile . Said Birdalone : I thank thee , good Catherine ; I shall lie a little longer ; depart now . The woman went her ways ; and when she was gone , Birdalone wept and sobbed , and writhed upon her bed , and found no solace to her grief . But she arose and paced the chamber , and sithence looked out of the window over the empty water , and wept again . Then she said : Yet they may come ere noon , or it may be ere evening , or perchance tomorrow morning . And she stayed her weeping , and was calmer . But still she walked the floor , and whiles looked out of window , and whiles she looked on her limbs , and felt the sleekness of her sides , and she said : O my body ! how thou longest ! But at last she clad herself in haste , and went stealthily from the chamber , as if she feared to meet anyone ; and she stole up to the tower - top that was nighest , and looked through the door on to the leads , and saw no one there ; so she went out , and stood by the battlement , and gazed long over the water , but saw neither boat nor burning mountain coming towards her . Chapter III ~ Now Would Birdalone Ride Abroad After a while she came down again , and went to the women , and sat working with them a while , and so wore away two hours . Then she sent for the priest and had her lesson of him ; and when she had been at it another two hours , she bade him begin and learn her writing ; and nought loth he was thereto ; forsooth he had been longing to pray her to suffer him learn her , but durst not . For in such teaching needs must he sit full nigh to her , and watch her hands , and her fingers striving to shape the letters ; nay , whiles must he touch her hand with his , and hold it . Wherefore now he promised himself a taste of Paradise . Withal he was full meet to learn her , whereas he was one of the best of scribes , and a fair - writer full handy . So they fell to the lesson , and she became eager thereover , and learned fast , and clave to the work , while his soul was tormented with longing for her . And thus wore a three hours , and then suddenly she looked up wearily from her work , and her trouble was awake , and the longing for her speech - friend , and she gave the priest leave for that day , but suffered him to kiss her hand for wages . Then she hurried up to the tower - top , when the afternoon was wearing into evening ; and abode there a long while looking over the waters , till it began to dusk , and then came down miserably and went to her women . The next day was like unto this ; nought betid , and she wore the hours whiles going up to the tower - top and looking over the lake , whiles broidering amidst her maids , whiles learning her clerk ’s work with Sir Leonard , but ever eating her heart out with her longing . On the third of these days she called the castellan to her for a talk , and asked him what he thought of it , this delay of his lords ’
62459	64285	62457	62458	the ladies	1877	’ tent ; and Birdalone and hers went down into the water and washed the weariness off them ; and her ladies wondered at the deftness of Birdalone ’s swimming ; for they bathed in a pool somewhat great into which the stream widened , so that there was space enough for her therein . By then they were washen and clad goodly in raiment which they had brought on the sumpters , the men had lighted fires and were cooking the venison , and anon there was supper and banquet in the wildwood , with drinking of wine and pleasant talk and the telling of tales and singing of minstrelsy ; and so at last , when night was well worn , and out in the open meadows the eastern sky was waxing grey , then Birdalone and her ladies went to bed in their fair tents , and the men - at - arms lay down on the greensward under the bare heaven . Chapter V ~ Sir Aymeris Showeth Birdalone the Mountains Afar Off When it was morning and they arose , the day was as fair as yesterday , and folk were even as joyous as they had been then , all but Birdalone , and she was silent and downcast , even when she came forth from the fresh water into the sweetness of the midsummer wood . She had dreamed in the night that she was all alone in the Castle of the Quest , and that her old mistress came to her from out of the Sending Boat to fetch her away , and brought her aboard , and stripped her of her rich garments and sat facing her , drawing ugsome grimaces at her ; and she thought she knew that her friends were all dead and gone , and she had none to pity or defend her . Then somehow were they two , the witch and she , amidmost of the Isle of Nothing , and the witch drew close anigh her , and was just going to whisper into her ear something of measureless horror , when she awoke ; and the sun was bright outside the shaded whiteness of her tent ; the shadows of the leaves were dancing on the ground of it ; the morning wind was rustling the tree - boughs , and the ripple of the stream was tinkling hard by . At first was Birdalone joyous that what she had awakened from was but a dream ; but presently she felt the burden of her longing , and she said to herself that when they came back to the castle they should find tidings , and that she should know either that her friends were indeed dead , or that they were come back again alive and well . And then she thought within herself , suppose the three Champions and their loves were dead and gone , how would she do with those that were left her , as Sir Aymeris , and Leonard the priest , and her women ? and her soul turned with loathing from a life so empty as that would be ; and yet she blamed herself that she was so little friendly to these lesser friends , whom forsooth she loved because of her love for the greater ones . So , as abovesaid , she was troubled and silent amongst the joy of the others . That saw Sir Aymeris the castellan ; and when they had broken fast and were getting to horse , he came to her and said : Lady , the day is yet young , and if we fetch a compass by a way that I wot of we shall see places new to thee , and mayhappen somewhat wonderful , and yet come home timely to the castle . Wilt thou ? Birdalone was still somewhat distraught , but she knew not how to naysay him , though at heart she would liefer have gone back to the castle by the shortest way . So folk brought her her palfrey , and they rode their ways , the castellan ever by her side . And by fair ways indeed they went , and so joyous was all about them , that little by little Birdalone ’s gladness came back to her , and she made the most of it to be as merry of seeming as she might be . Now they rode fair and softly by thicket and copse and glade of the woodland , following up the stream aforesaid for the more part , till at last the trees failed them suddenly , and they came forth on to a wide green plain , all unbuilded , so far as their eyes could see , and beyond it the ridges of the hills and blue mountains rising high beyond them . When Birdalone ’s eyes beheld this new thing , of a sudden all care left her , and she dropped her rein , and smote her palms together , and cried out : Oh ! but thou art beautiful , O earth , thou art beautiful ! Then she sat gazing on it , while the greyhead turned and smiled on her , well pleased of her pleasure . After a while she said : And might we go nigher ? Yea , certes , said he , yet I doubt if thou wilt like it the better , the nigher thou art . Ah ! she said , but if I were only amidst it , and a part of it , as once I was of the woodland ! So thitherward they rode over the unharvested mead , and saw hart and hind thereon , and wild kine , and of smaller deer great plenty , but of tame beasts none ; and the hills were before them like a wall . But as they drew nigher , they saw where the said wall of the hills was cloven by a valley narrow and steep - sided , that went right athwart the lie of the hills ; the said valley was but little grassed , and the bare rocks were crow - black . When they had gone a little further , they could see that the ground near the foot of the hills rose in little knolls and ridges , but these were lower and fewer about the entry into that valley . Also presently they came upon a stream which ran out of the said valley , and Sir Aymeris said that this was the water whereby they had lain last night ; albeit here it was little indeed . Now when they had ridden some five miles over the plain , they came amongst those knolls at the mouth of the valley , and Sir Aymeris led Birdalone up to the top of one of the highest of them , and thence they could look into that dale and see how it winded away up toward the mountains , like to a dismal street ; for not only was it but little grassed , but withal there was neither tree nor bush therein . Moreover , scattered all about the bottom of the dale were great stones , which looked as if they had once been set in some kind of order ; and that the more whereas they were not black like the rocks of the dale - side , but pale grey of hue , so that they looked even as huge sheep of the giants feeding down the dale . Then spake Birdalone : Verily , sir knight , thou saidst but sooth that I should see things new and strange . But shall we go a little way into this valley today ? Nay , lady , said Sir Aymeris , nor tomorrow , nor any day uncompelled ; neither shall we go nigher unto it than now we be . Wherefore not ? said Birdalone , for meseemeth it is as the gate of the mountains ; and fain were I in the mountains . Lady , said the castellan , overmuch perilous it were to ride the valley , which , as thou sayest , is the very gate of the mountains . For the said dale , which hight the Black Valley of the Greywethers , hath a bad name for the haunting of unmanlike wights , against which even our men - at - arms might make no defence . And if any might escape them , and win through the gates and up into the mountains , I wot not if suchlike devils and things unkent be there in the mountain - land , but of a sooth there be fierce and wild men , like enough to devils , who know no peace , and slay whatsoever cometh unto them , but if they themselves be slain of them . Well , said Birdalone , then today , at least , we go not into the dale ; but knowest thou any tales of these wild places ? Many have I heard , said he , but I am an ill minstrel and should spoil them in the telling . Ask them of Sir Leonard our priest , he knoweth of them better than others , and hath a tongue duly shapen for telling them . Birdalone answered nought thereto ; she but turned her horse ’s head and rode down the knoll ; and so they came unto their company , and all went their ways toward the Castle of the Quest . Nought befell them on their way home ; but the nigher they came to the castle the more pensive waxed Birdalone , and , though she hid it , when they were come to the gate she scarce had her wit ; for it was as if she thought to have one rushing out and crying : Tidings , tidings ! they are come . Nowise it so befell ; they were no more come than was the Day of Doom . And a little after they were within gates ; it was night , and Birdalone crept wearily up to her chamber , and gat to bed , and so tired was she that she fell asleep at once and dreamed not . Chapter VI ~ Birdalone Heareth Tell Tales of the Black Valley of the Greywethers On the morrow was Birdalone heavier of heart than ever yet , and wearier for tidings ; and she wondered how she could have been so joyous that day in the wildwood . Yet she thought much of the Valley of the Greywethers , and that solaced her somewhat after a while , so sore she longed to go thither ; and , as ’
64376	65367	65372	65372	they	2115	’ tis said that they try their luck overmuch who go thither twice . Birdalone said : Tell me now of the tales that be told of that valley . Quoth Leonard : They be many ; but the main of them is this : that those Greywethers be giants of yore agone , or landwights , carles , and queans , who have been turned into stone by I wot not what deed ; but that whiles they come alive again , and can walk and talk as erst they did ; and that if any man may be so bold as to abide the time of their awakening , and in the first moment of their change may frame words that crave the fulfilment of his desire , and if therewith he be both wise and constant , then shall he have his desire fulfilled of these wights , and bear his life back again from out the dale . And thus must he speak and no otherwise : O Earth , thou and thy first children , I crave of you such and such a thing , whatsoever it may be . And if he speak more than this , then is he undone . He shall answer no question of them ; and if they threaten him he shall not pray them mercy , nor quail before their uplifted weapons ; nor , to be short , shall he heed them more than if they still were stones unchanged . Moreover , when he hath said his say , then shall these wights throng about him and offer him gold and gems , and all the wealth of the earth ; and if that be not enough , they shall bring him the goodliest of women , with nought lacking in her shape , but lacking all raiment , so that he shall see her as she is verily shapen . But whoso shall take any one of all these gifts is lost for ever , and shall become one of that Stony People ; and whoso naysayeth them all until the cock crow , and abideth steady by his one craving , shall win fulfilment thereof , and , as some say , all those gifts aforesaid ; for that the Stony People may not abide the day to take them back again . He was silent therewith , and nought spake Birdalone , but looked down on the ground , and longing encompassed her soul . Then the priest spake again : This were a fair adventure , lady , for a hapless one , but for the happy it were a fool ’s errand . She answered not , and they parted for that time . But the next week , there being yet no tidings come to hand , Birdalone prayed the castellan to take her out - a - gates again , that she might once more behold the mountains , and the gates thereof ; and he yeasaid her asking , and went with her , well accompanied , as before ; but this time , by Birdalone ’s will , they rode straight to the plain aforesaid , and again she looked into that dale of the Greywethers from the knoll . Somewhat belated they were , so that they might not get back to the castle before dusk , wherefore again they lay out in the wildwood , but there lacked somewhat of the triumph and joyance which they had had that other day . They came back to the castle on the morrow somewhat after noon , and found no news there ; nor , to say sooth , did Birdalone look for any ; and her heart was heavy . Chapter VII ~ Birdalone Beguileth the Priest to Help Her to Outgoing Now had the time so worn that the season was in the first days of August , and weariness and heartsickness increased on Birdalone again , and she began to look pined and pale . Yet when she spake of the tarrying of the Champions both to the castellan and Sir Leonard the priest ( who was the wiser man of the two ) , each said the same thing , to wit , that it was no marvel if they were not yet come , seeing whatlike the adventure was ; and neither of those two seemed in anywise to have lost hope . Thrice in these last days did Birdalone go out - a - gates with Sir Aymeris and his company ; and the last of the three times the journey was to the knoll that looked into the Black Valley ; but now was Birdalone ’s pleasure of the sight of it afar off marred by her longing to be amidst thereof ; yet she did not show that she was irked by the refraining of her desire to enter therein , and they turned , and came home safely to the castle . On the morrow she sat with Sir Leonard the priest over the writing lesson , and she let it be long , and oft he touched her hand , so that the sweetness of unfulfilled desire went deep to his heart . At last Birdalone looked up and said : Friend , I would ask thee if thou seest any peril in my entering the Black Valley of the Greywethers by daylight if I leave it by daylight ? Alone ? quoth he . Yea , she said , alone . He pondered a little , and then said : Sooth to say I deem the peril little in the valley itself , if thou be not overcome by terror there . Yea , for my part I am not all so sure that thou shalt see the wonder of the Stony Folk coming alive ; for ’
65772	74295	74314	74314	he	2135	’ space , or three at the most , thou wilt wot that I have fared amiss , and then mayst thou let it be known whither I went , and men will seek me and deliver me maybe . Therewith she stayed her words suddenly , and turned very pale , and laid her hand on her bosom , and said faintly : But O my heart , my heart ! If they should come while I am away ! And she seemed like to swoon . Leonard was afraid thereat , and knew not what to do ; but presently the colour came into her face again , and in a little while she smiled , and said : Seest thou not , friend , how weak I am gotten to be , and that I must now beyond doubt have the remedy ? Wilt thou not help me do it ? Yea verily , said he ; but in what wise wilt thou have it ? He spake as a man distraught and redeless ; but she smiled on him pleasantly , and said : Now by this time shouldst thou have devised what was to do , and spared me the pain thereof . Two things I need of thee : the first and most , to be put out of the castle privily betimes in the morning when nought is stirring ; the second , to have my palfrey awaiting me somewhat anigh the gate , so that I may not have to go afoot : for I am become soft and feeble with all this house - life . Leonard seemed to wake up with that word , and said : I have the key of the priest ’s door of the chapel , and the postern beyond it ; that shall be thine out - gate , lady . I will come and scratch at thy chamber - door much betimes , and I will see to it that thy palfrey is bestowed in the bower wherein thou didst rest the first night thou camest amongst us . She said : I trust thee , friend . And she thanked him sweetly , and then rose up and fell to pacing the hall up and down . Leonard hung about watching her a while , she nought forbidding him , for her thoughts were elsewhere , and she had forgotten him ; and at last he went his ways to set about doing what she would . Chapter VIII ~ Birdalone Fares On Her Adventure Dawn was but just beginning when Birdalone awoke , and though she had not heard Leonard at the door , she sprang out of bed and clad herself , doing on her black gown ; and she had a scrip with some bread therein , and a sharp knife at her girdle . Then even as she had done she heard the priest ’s nail on the door , and she turned thereto ; but as she went , her eye caught her bow and quiver of arrows where they hung on the wall , so she took the bow in her hand and slung the quiver over her shoulder ere she opened the door and found Leonard standing there . Neither of them spake aught , but they stole downstairs , and so to the chapel and out by the priest ’s door and the postern in the wall - nook , and were presently out in the fresh morning air ; and Birdalone was joyous and lightfoot , and scarce felt the earth beneath her soles for pleasure of her hope , whereas she deemed she had a thing to crave of the Stony Folk , if they should come alive before her . Fain were she , if she might withal , to give a joy to some other ; so that when they were gone but a little way from the castle she reached out her hand to Leonard and took his , and said : Hand in hand we walked when first I went this way , and I deemed thee kind and friendly then , and even so hast thou been sithence . He was dumbfoundered at first for joy of the touch of her hand and the sweetness of her words ; but presently he spake to her confused and stammering , and praised her that she had thought to take her bow and arrows ; for , said he , that they might stand her in stead for defence or for getting of food , or for an excuse for wending the woods . She nodded yeasay unto him , and bade him again to bide three days for her , and if she came not again in that time , to make a clean breast of it to Sir Aymeris . Yea , said the priest , and then . . . Why , what then ? He can but shove me out by the shoulders , and then I can seek to the little house of canons that is at Gate Cross on the road to Greenford . Ah , my friend ! said Birdalone , how we women think of nothing at all but ourselves ! And wilt thou be thrust out of thine home for helping me herein ? Why did I not look to my palfrey myself ? And the keys I might have stolen from thee , always with thy good will . But now I see that I have done thee a hurt . Said Sir Leonard : Lady , a priest hath a home wheresoever is an house of religion . There is no harm done , save Sir Aymeris bethink him of hanging me over the battlements ; as I doubt he will not with a priest . Moreover , I pray thee believe , that wert thou gone from the castle , house and home were none for me there . And he looked upon her piteously , as if he were beseeching . But she knew not what to say , and hung her head adown ; and presently they were come to the bower in the copse , which this time was a stable for Birdalone ’s palfrey instead of a chamber for herself . So Leonard went in and fetched out the comely beast ; and Birdalone stood with him just in the cover of the copse waiting to put her foot in the stirrup ; but she might not but abide to look upon the priest , who stood there as if he were striving with his words . So she said : Now is need of haste to be gone . Yet one word , my friend : Is there aught betwixt us wherein I have done thee wrong ? If so it be , I pray thee to say out what it is ; for it may be ( though I think it not ) thou shalt not see me again from henceforth . He caught his breath , as if he had much ado to refrain the sobbing ; but he mastered it , and said : Lady and dear friend , if I see thee not again , I heed not what shall befall me . Thou hast done me no wrong . There is this only betwixt us , that I love thee , and thou lovest not me . She looked on him sweetly and pitifully , and said : I may not choose but understand thy word , to wit , that thy love for me is the desire of a man toward a woman ; and that is unhappy ; for I love thee indeed , but not as a woman loveth a man . It is best to say thus much to thee downright . But I feel in my heart that when I have said it , it is as much as to say that I can not help thee , and therefore am I sorry indeed . He stood before her abashed , but he said at last : Now art thou so sweet , and so kind , and so true , that I must perforce love thee yet more ; and this maketh me bold to say that thou mayst help me a little , or so meseemeth . How so ? said Birdalone . Quoth he : If thou wouldst suffer me to kiss thy face this once . She shook her head , and spake : How may it avail thee , when it is for once , and once only , as forsooth it must be ? Yet it is thy choice , not mine , and I will not naysay thee . And therewith she put up her face to him , and he kissed her cheek without touching her otherwise , and then he kissed her mouth ; and she knew that he was both timorous and sad , and she was ashamed to look on him , or to speak to him any more , lest she should behold him ashamed ; so she but said : Farewell , friend , till tomorrow at least . And therewith her foot was in the stirrup , and anon she sat in the saddle , and her palfrey was ambling briskly on the way she would . Chapter IX ~ Birdalone Comes to the Black Valley Little is to tell of Birdalone ’s journey unto the knoll above the Black Valley of the Greywethers . It was about noon when she came there , and had met but few folk on the way , and those few were husbandmen , or carlines , or maidens wending afield betimes not far from the Castle of the Quest . Now she sat on her horse and looked down into the dale and its stony people once more , and saw nought stirring save three ravens who , not far off , were flapping about from stone to stone of the Greywethers , and croaking loud to each other as if some tidings were toward . She watched their play for a little , and then gat off her horse , and sat down on the grass of the knoll , and drew forth her victual , and ate and drank ; for she deemed it happier to eat and drink there than in the very jaws of the Black Valley . Soon was her dinner done , and then she got to her saddle again , and rode slowly down to the little stream , and along it toward the valley and the gates of the mountains , which she had been fain to pass through ; but now , as had happed with her that morning when she was boun for the Sending Boat , somewhat she hung back from the adventure , and when she lacked but some five score yards from the very dale itself , she lighted down again , and let her way - beast bite the grass , while she sat down and watched the rippling water . In a while she drew off shoon and hosen , and stood in the shallow ripple , and bathed her hands and face withal , and stooped up - stream and drank from the hollow of her hands , and so stepped ashore and was waxen hardier ; then she strung her bow and looked to the shafts in her quiver , and did on her foot - gear , and mounted once more , and so rode a brisk amble right on into the dale , and was soon come amongst the Greywethers ; and she saw that they were a many , and that all the bottom of the dale was besprinkled with them on either side of the stream , and some stood in the very stream itself , the ground whereof was black even as the rest of the valley , although the water ran over it as clear as glass . As for the dale , now she was fairly within it , she could see but a little way up it , for it winded much , and at first away from her left hand , and the sides of it went up in somewhat steep screes on either side , which were topped with mere upright staves and burgs of black rock ; and these were specially big and outthrusting on the right hand of her ; and but a furlong ahead of where she was , one of these burgs thrust out past the scree and came down sheer into the dale , and straitened it so much that there was but little way save by the stream itself , which ran swift indeed , but not deep , even there where it was straitened by the sheer rocks . But up the dale would she go , whatever was before her ; and now she told herself her very purpose , as forsooth she scarce had heretofore ; to wit , that she would abide in the dale the night over and see what should betide , and if those wights should chance to come alive , then she looked to have valiance enough to face them and crave the fulfilment of her desire . So she took the water and rode the stream till she was past the said sheer rock , and then the valley widened again , and presently was wider than it was in the beginning ; and here again were the Greywethers grown many more and closer together , and , as she deemed , were set in rings round about one very big one , which , forsooth , was somewhat in the shape of a man sitting down with his hands laid on his knees . Birdalone reined up for a minute , and looked about her , and then went up on to the grass , and rode straight to the said big stone , and there lighted down from off her horse again , and stood by the stone and pondered . Presently she deemed that she saw something dark moving just beyond the stone , but if it were so , it was gone in a twinkling ; nevertheless she stood affrighted , and stared before her long , and saw no more , but yet for a while durst not move hand nor foot . At last her courage came again , and she thought : Yet how if this great chieftain be inwardly stirring and will come awake ? Shall I say the word now , lest hereafter it be of no avail ? Therewith she stretched out her right hand and laid it on the stone , and spake aloud : O Earth , thou and thy first children , I crave of you that he may come back now at once and loving me . And her voice sounded strange and unkent to her in that solitude , and she rued it that she had spoken . Chapter X ~ How Birdalone Fell in with A Man in the Black Valley of the Greywethers Came new tidings therewithal ; for the moment after she had spoken , a tall man drew out from behind the big stone , and stood before her ; and at first it was in her mind that this was the very chieftain come alive for her , and for terror she was like to swoon this time ; but he spake nought a while , but looked on her eagerly and curiously . She came to herself presently , so much that she could see him clearly , and was now growing more shamefast than afraid , when she saw beyond doubt that the man was of the sons of Adam ; but what with her shame that was now , and her fear that had been , she yet had no might to move , but stood there pale and trembling like a leaf , and might scarce keep her feet . Now the new - comer bowed before her smiling , and said : I ask thy pardon , fair damsel ( or indeed I should say fairest damsel ) , that I have scared thee . But sooth to say I beheld thee coming riding , and even from a little aloof I could see that nought which might befall could ever make it up to me for not seeing thee close at hand and hearing thee speak . Wherefore I hid myself behind the king ’s stone here ; and no harm is done thereby I trow ; for now I see that the colour is coming into thy cheeks again , and thy fear is gone . And as for me , thou hast not fled away from me , as thou wouldst have done had I not hidden and come on thee suddenly ; and then thou being horsed and I unhorsed , thou wouldst have escaped me , whereas now thou art within reach of my hand . Then he smiled , and said : Furthermore , thou hast told so little of thy secret to this stony king here , that I am little the wiser for thy word , and thou the little more betrayed . Only this I will say , that if He loveth thee not , He is more of a fool than I be . He reached out his hand to hers , but she drew it aback , and grew yet more ashamed , and could find no word for him . His voice was soft and full , and he spake deftly , but she was not content with it for its kindness , as she had been with all the other men whom she had met since she left the House under the Wood , and she durst not trust her hand to him . As for his aspect , she saw that he was tall and well - knit , and goodly of fashion ; dark - haired , with long hazel eyes , smooth - cheeked and bright - skinned ; his nose long , and a little bent over at the end , and coming down close to his lips , which were full and red ; his face was hairless save for a little lip - beard . He was so clad , that he had no helm on his head , but a little hat with a broad gold piece in the front thereof ; he was girt to a long sword , and had an anlace also in his belt , and Birdalone saw the rings of a fine hauberk at his collar and knees ; otherwise he was not armed . Over his hauberk he wore a black surcoat , without device of any kind , and his foot and leg gear were of the same hue ; wherefore may we call him the Black Knight . Sooth to say , for all his soft speech , she feared him and rued the meeting of him . Now he spake to her again : I see that thou art wroth with me , lady ; but mayhappen it is not so ill that I have happened on thee ; for this dale hath a bad name for more than one thing , and is scarce meet for damsels to wander in . But now since thou hast a weaponed man with thee , and thou , by All - hallows ! not utterly unarmed , thou mayst well go up the valley and see something more thereof . So come now , mount thine horse again , and I will lead him for thee . Now Birdalone found speech and said : Knight , for such thou seemest to me , I deem now that I have no need to fare further in this dale , but I will get me into the saddle and turn my horse ’s head outward again , giving thee good day first and thanking thee for thy courtesy . And therewith she turned to get to her palfrey , but sore trembling the while ; but he followed her and said , with brow somewhat knitted : Nay , lady , I have left my horse somewhat further up , and I must go back to fetch him , that we may wend out of the dale together . For I will not suffer thee to flee from me and fall into the hands of evil wights , be they ghosts or living men , and that the less since I have heard the speech in thy mouth , as of honey and cream and roses . Therefore if thou go out of the dale , I shall go with thee afoot , leading thine horse . And look to it if it be courteous to unhorse a knight , who is ready to be thy servant . Moreover , since thou hast come to this dale of wonder , and mayst leave it safely , pity it were that thou shouldst see nought thereof , for strange is it forsooth , and belike thou shalt never seek thither again . Wherefore I crave of thee , once more , to mount thine horse and let me lead thee up the dale . He spake these last words rather as one giving a command than making a prayer , and Birdalone feared him now sorely . Forsooth she had her bended bow in hand ; but let alone that the knight was over - near to her that she might get a shaft out of her quiver and nock it , ere he should run in on her , and let alone also that he was byrnied , she scarce deemed that it behoved her to slay or wound the man because she would be quit of him . Wherefore angrily , and with a flushed face , she answered him : So shall it be then , Sir Knight ; or rather so must it be , since thou compellest me . He laughed and said : Nay , now thou art angry . I compel thee not , I but say that it will not do for thee to compel me to leave thee . Go which way thou wilt , up the dale , or down it and out of it ; it is all one unto me , so long as I am with thee . Forsooth , damsel , I have said harder words to ladies who have done my pleasure and not deemed themselves compelled . She paled but answered nought ; then she mounted her palfrey , and the knight went to her bridle - rein without more words , and so led her on up the valley by the easiest way amongst the Greywethers . Chapter XI ~ Birdalone is Led Up the Black Valley As they went , the knight fell a - talking to Birdalone , and that without any of the covert jeering which he had used erewhile ; and he showed her places in the dale , as caverns under the burgs , and little eyots in the stream , and certain stones amongst the Greywethers whereof stories ran ; and how this and the other one had fared in dealings with the land - wights , and how one had perished , and another had been made happy , and so forth . Withal he told of the mountain - folk , and in especial how they of the plains , when he was scarce more than a boy , had met them in battle in that same dale , and how fierce the fight was ; whereas the mountain - men were fighting for a life of desires accomplished , which hitherto had been but a dream unto them ; and the men of the plain fought for dear life itself , and for all that made it aught save death in life . Wherefore up and down the dale they fought , at first in ordered ranks and then in knots , and lastly sword to sword and man to man , till there was no foot of grass or black sand there which had not its shower of blood ; and the stream was choked with the dead , and ran red out of the dale ; till at last well - nigh all the host of the mountain - men was fallen , and scarce less of the folk of the plains , but these men held the field and had the victory . All this he told her deftly and well , and though he said not so right out , yet let her wot that , youth as he was , he was of the battle ; and his voice was clear and good , and Birdalone ’s wrath ran off her , and she hearkened his tale , and even asked him a question here and there ; and so courteous was this Black Knight now become , that Birdalone began to think that she had fallen short of courtesy to him , because of her fear and the weariness of the waiting which so oppressed her ; and that shamed and irked her , for she would fain be of all courtesy . Wherefore now she deemed that perchance she had erred in deeming him an evil man ; and she looked on him from time to time , and deemed him goodly of fashion ; she thought his eyes were deep , and his face sober and fair of aspect , but that his nose turned down at the end , and was over thin at the bridge , and moreover his lips looked over - sweet and licorous . Now when the knight was silent of his tales , Birdalone fell to asking him questions sweetly concerning this Stony People which was all about them ; and he told her all he knew , soberly enough at first , yet indeed ended by mocking them somewhat , but mocked not at her any more . At last he said : Fair lady , that thou hast not come here all for nought I partly know by those words which I heard come from thy mouth at the King ’s Stone ; wherefore I marvelled indeed when I heard thee say that thou wouldst go straight out of the dale ; for I had deemed thee desirous of trying the adventure of waking this Stony People a - night - tide . Forsooth was this thy mind when thou soughtest hither to the dale ? She reddened at his word , and yeasaid him shortly . Then said he : Is it not thy mind still ? Sir , said she , as now I have got to fear it . Yea ? and that is strange , said he , for thou wouldst have waked the dale alone ; and now thou art no longer alone , but hast me to watch and ward thy waking , thou art more afeard . She looked on his face steadily , to wot if there were no half - hidden smile therein ; but herseemed that he spake in all soberness ; and she had nought to say to him save this : Sir , I am now become afraid of the waking . And he said no more thereof . Now they went thus , and Birdalone not without pleasure , since her fear of the knight was minished , some three hours up the dale , and still were the Greywethers everywhere about them , so that there were well - nigh as many hours as miles in their wending . At last they seemed to be drawing nigh to the head of the dale , and the burgs and the rocks were before them all round it as a wall , though yet about a mile aloof at the further end ; and this end it was wider than elsewhere . Came they then to a level space of greensward clear of the grey stones , which were drawn all around it in ordered rings , so that it was as some doom - ring of an ancient people ; and within the said space Birdalone beheld a great black horse tethered and cropping the grass . The knight led her into the ring , and said : Now are we come home for the present , my lady , and if it please thee to light down we shall presently eat and drink , and sithence talk a little . And he drew nigh to help her off her horse , but she suffered him not , and lighted down of herself ; but if she suffered not his hand , his eyes she must needs suffer , as he gazed greedily on the trimness of her feet and legs in her sliding from her horse . Howsoever , he took her hand , and led her to a little mound on the other side of the ring , and bade her sit down there , and so did she , and from under the nighest of the stones he drew forth a pair of saddle - bags , and took victual and wine thence , and they ate and drank together like old companions . And now Birdalone told herself that the knight was frank and friendly ; yet forsooth she wotted that her heart scarce trowed what it feigned , and that she yet feared him . Chapter XII ~ How Those Twain Get Them from Out of the Black Valley of the Greywethers When they had dined , and had sat a while talking , the knight said : I will ask thee once more wherefore thou must needs depart from this dale leaving the Greywethers unwaked ? Yet this must I tell thee first , that this ring at the dale ’s end is the only one due place where the Greywethers can be rightly waked , and that there be few who wot this . Wilt thou not tell me then what is in thy mind ? Birdalone gazed down on the ground a while ; then she lifted up her head and looked on the Black Knight , and said : Sir Knight , we have been brought so close together today , and as meseemeth I am so wholly in thy power , that I will tell thee the very truth as it is . My mind it was to wake the dale here to - night , and take what might befall me . And well indeed might I fear the adventure , which few , meseemeth , would not fear . But so strong is my longing for that which I would crave of these wights , that it overmastered my fear , and my purpose held when I entered the dale . Then I met thee ; and here again is the truth , take it how thou wilt , that presently I feared thee , and yet I fear thee ; for I have noted thee closely all this while , and have seen of thee , that thou art over heedful of my poor body , and wouldst have it for thine own if thou mightest . And there is this in thee also , as I deem , though thou thyself mayst not know it , that thou wouldst have thy pleasure of me whether it pleasure me or grieve me ; and this thy pleasure must I needs gainsay ; for though thou mayest hereafter become my friend , yet are there other friends of mine , who be such , that my grief would mar any pleasure they might have . Hast thou heard and understood ? She looked on his face steadily as she spake , and saw that it flushed , and darkened , and scowled , and that his hands were clenched , and his teeth set hard together . And again she spake : Sir , thou shalt know that beside these shot - weapons , I have a thing here in my girdle that may serve either against thee or against me , if need drive me thereto ; wherefore I will pray thee to forbear . Forsooth , thou shalt presently happen on other women , who shall be better unto thee than I can be . By then Birdalone had spoken the word , the knight ’s face had cleared , and he laughed aloud and said : As to thy last words , therein at least thou liest , my lady . But for the rest , I see that it must all be as thou wiliest . Yea , if such be thy will , we shall presently to horse and ride down the dale again , and at the end thereof I shall leave thee to go home alone at thy will . She said : For that I can thee thanks with all my heart . But why hast thou not asked me of whence I am , and whither I would go home ? Again he laughed and said : Because I know already . I have had more than two or three tales from them who have seen thee , or spoken unto others who have seen thee , how the gay Champions of the Castle of the Quest had fished up a wondrous pearl of price from out of the Great Water ; and when I set eyes on thy beauty , I knew that the said pearl could be nowhere else than under mine eyes . Let that pass , she said , and blushed not ; but now tell me the truth as I have told thee , why thou art so instant with me to wake the Greywethers to - night ? He kept silence a while , and , as she looked on him , she thought she saw confusion in his face ; but at last he said : Thou wert wrong in saying that I heeded not thy pleasure , and solace , and welfare . Meseemed , and yet doth , that it might be to thine avail to wake the Greywethers to - night ; and never again mayst thou have a chance of the waking , as erst I said . I say I wish thee to have fulfilment of thy craving . Nor hast thou aught to fear of them , seeing that it is but dastards and fools that they undo . He broke off his speech , and Birdalone yet looked on him , and after a little he said : Thou drawest the truth out of me ; for moreover I would have thee with me longer than thou wouldst be if we but rode together down the water and out of the dale , and thou to fare away alone . Birdalone spake in a while , and that while he gazed upon her eagerly ; she said : I shall now tell thee that I shall abide the adventure of the waking to - night , whatever befall . And I , said he , will so do that thou mayst fear me the less ; for I will unarm me when the night cometh , and thou thyself shalt keep mine hauberk and sword and anlace . She said : It is well ; I will take that , lest desire overmaster thee . They spake no more of it at that time , and it was now five hours after noon . Birdalone arose , for she found it hard to sit still and abide nightfall : she went without the two first rings of the Greywethers , which were set in more open order beyond that , and she looked all about her , to the black rocks on either side , and to the great black wall at the dale ’s ending , and the blue mountains aloof beyond it ; then down toward the plain of the dale came her eyes , and she looked through the tangle of the grey stones . Now she seemed to be looking more intently upon some one thing ; with that she called to her the Black Knight , who was hanging about watching her , and she said to him : Fair sir , art thou clear - seeing and far - seeing ? I am not thought to be purblind , quoth he . Then Birdalone reached out her hand and pointed and said : Canst thou see aught which thou didst not look to see , there , up the dale as I point ? Said he : All too clear I see the hand and the wrist of thee , and that blinds me to aught else . I pray thee fool not , she said , but look heedfully , and thou mayst see what I see , and then tell me what it means . Though forsooth I am exceeding in far sight . He looked under the sharp of his hand heedfully , then he turned unto her and said : By All - hallows ! there is in thee every excellency ! Thou art right ; I see a bay horse up there feeding on the bites of grass amongst the Greywethers . Look again ! she said ; what else canst thou see ? Is there aught anigh to the bay horse which is like to the gleam and glitter of metal . Christ ! said he , once more thou art right . There be weaponed men in the dale . Tarry not , I beseech thee , but get to horse forthright , and I will do no less . There goeth the waking of the dale for this time , said Birdalone , laughing . But art thou not in haste , fair sir ? may not these be friends ? The knight laid his hand upon her shoulder , and thrust her on toward her palfrey , and spake fiercely , but not loud : Thee I pray not to fool now ! There is not a minute to spare . If thou deemest me evil , as I think thou dost , there are worser than I , I tell thee , there are worser . But we will talk of it when we be in the saddle , and clear of this accursed dale . Birdalone knew not what to do save obey him , so she lightly gat into her saddle , and followed him , for he was mounted in a twinkling , and riding on . He led out of the ring , and fell to threading the maze of the Greywethers , keeping ever toward the steep side of the dale , which was on that hand that looked toward the Castle of the Quest , that is to say , the eastern bent . Birdalone wondered at this leading , and when she was come up with the knight she spake to him breathlessly , and said : But , fair sir , why wend we not down the dale ? He answered : First , lady , because we must hide us from them straightway ; and next because they be more than we , many more , and their horses be fresh , while thine at least is somewhat spent ; and if they were to spur down the dale in chase , they would soon be upon us ; for think not that I would escape and leave thee behind . Said Birdalone : But thou knowest them , then , what they be ? since thou wottest of their numbers and their riding . Hearken now ! Upon thy soul and thy salvation , be they more friends unto thee than unto me ? He said , as be rode on a little slower than erst : Upon my soul and my salvation I swear it , that the men yonder be of the worst unfriends to thee that may be in the world . And now , lady , I promise thee that I will unravel thee the riddle , and tell thee the whole truth of these haps , whatsoever may come of my words , when we be in a safer place than this ; and meantime I beseech thee to trust in me thus far , as to believe that I am leading thee out of the very worst peril that might befall thee . Nay , thou must needs trust me ; for I tell thee , that though I now love thee better than all the world and all that is in it , I would slay thee here in this dale rather than suffer thee to fall into the hands of these men . Birdalone heard him with a sick heart ; but such passion went with his words that she believed what he said ; and she spake softly : Sir , I will trust thee thus far ; but I beseech thee to have pity upon a poor maiden who hath had but little pity shown unto her until these latter days ; and then : O woe ’s me , to have fallen out of the kindness and love once more ! The Black Knight spake to her in a little while , and said : What pity I can to thee , that I will . Once more I tell thee , that if thou but knew it thou wouldst thank me indeed for what I have done for thee in this hour ; and henceforth I will do and forbear with thee to the uttermost that love will suffer me . But lo thou ! here are we safe for this present ; but we must nowise tarry . Birdalone looked and saw that they were come to the wall of the dale , and that there it went down sheer to the plain thereof , and that before them was a cleft that narrowed speedily , and over which the rocks well - nigh met , so that it was indeed almost a cave . They rode into it straightway , and when that they had gone but a little , and because it had winded somewhat , they could but see the main valley as a star of light behind them , then it narrowed no more , but was as a dismal street of the straitest , whiles lighter and whiles darker , according as the rocks roofed it in overhead or drew away from it . Long they rode , and whiles came trickles of water from out the rocks on one hand or the other ; and now and again they met a stream which covered all the ground of the pass from side to side for the depth of a foot or more . Great rocks also were strewn over their path every here and there , so that whiles must they needs dismount and toil afoot over the rugged stones ; and in most places the way was toilsome and difficult . The knight spake little to Birdalone , save to tell her of the way , and warn her where it was perilous ; and she , for her part , was silent , partly for fear of the strange man , or , it might be , even for hatred of him , who had thus brought her into such sore trouble , and partly for grief . For , with all torment of sorrow , she kept turning over and over in her mind whether her friends had yet come home to the Castle of the Quest , and whether they would go seek her to deliver her . And such shame took hold of her when she thought of their grief and confusion of soul when they should come home and find her gone , that she set her mind to asking if it had not been better had she never met them . Yet in good sooth her mind would not shape the thought , howsoever she bade it . Chapter XIII ~ Now They Rest for the Night in the Strait Pass At last , when they had been going a long while , it might be some six hours , and it had long been night in the world without , but moon - lit , and they had rested but seldom , and then but for short whiles , the knight drew rein and spake to Birdalone , and asked her was she not weary . O yea , she said ; I was at point to pray thee suffer me to get off and lie down on the bare rock . To say sooth , I am now too weary to think of any peril , or what thou art , or whither we be going . He said : By my deeming we be now half through this mountain highway , and belike there is little peril in our resting ; for I think not that any one of them knoweth of this pass , or would dare it if he did ; and they doubtless came into the dale by the upper pass , which is strait enough , but light and open . As he spoke , Birdalone bowed forward on her horse ’s neck , and would have fallen but that he stayed her . Then he lifted her off her horse , and laid her down in the seemliest place he might find ; and the pass there was much widened , and such light as there was in the outer world came down freely into it , though it were but of the moon and the stars ; and the ground was rather sandy than rocky . So he dight Birdalone ’s bed as well as he might , and did off his surcoat and laid it over her ; and then stood aloof , and gazed on her ; and he muttered : It is an evil chance ; yet the pleasure of it , the pleasure of it ! Yea , said he again , she might well be wearied ; I myself am ready to drop , and I am not the least tough of the band . And therewith he laid him down on the further side of the pass , and fell asleep straightway . Chapter XIV ~ The Black Knight Tells the Truth of Himself When the morning was come down into the straitness of their secret road , Birdalone opened her eyes and saw the Black Knight busy over dighting their horses : so she arose and thrust her grief back into her heart , and gave her fellow - farer the sele of the day , and he brought her victual , and they ate a morsel , and gat to horse thereafter and departed ; and the way became smoother , and it was lighter overhead everywhere now , and the rocks never again met overhead athwart the way ; and it seemed to Birdalone that now they were wending somewhat downward . The knight was courteous unto Birdalone , and no longer for the present thrust his love upon her , so that now she had some solace of his fellowship , though he was but few - spoken to her . It was betimes when they arose , and they rode all the morning till it was noon , which they might well wot of , because the way was much wider , and the cliff - walls of the pass much lower , so that the sun shone in upon them and cheered them . Now the Black Knight drew rein and said : Shall we rest , lady , and eat ? And thereafter , if thou wilt , I shall tell thee my tale . Or rather , if thou wilt suffer me , I shall speak first and eat afterwards , or else the morsel might stick in my throat . Knight , said Birdalone , smiling , I hope thou hast no lie to swallow down before the meat . Nay , lady , said he ; no lie that is of moment at least . So they lighted down , and Birdalone sat on the wayside under a birch - bush that came thrusting out from the rock , and the knight stood before her , hanging his head , as though he were one accused who would plead his cause ; and he began : Lady , I must tell thee first of all , that today I have done as an unfaithful servant and a traitor to my lord . Said Birdalone simply : Shall I tell thee the truth , and say that from the first I seemed to see in thee that thou wert scarce trusty ? He said : Well , that mind I saw in thee , and it went to my heart that thou shouldest think it , and that it should be no less than true . But now I must tell thee , that it is for thy sake that I have been untrusty to my lord . How so ? said she . Quoth he : Heardest thou ever of the Red Knight ? Yea , said Birdalone , I have heard of him ever as a tyrant and oppressor . Then she grew pale , and said : Art thou he ? Nay , said the knight , I am but a kinsman of his , and his best - trusted man ; nor have I failed him ever till yesterday . He kept silence a while , and then said : This is the true tale : that we have had tidings of thee and of thy ridings abroad with that old fool , Sir Aymeris , and how thou hadst been twice to look into the Black Valley . This I say hath the Red One heard , and the heart of him was touched by the mere hearsay of thee ; and moreover ’
80002	81753	80001	80001	Hearts	146	’ Hope ; and as he went he fell to framing in his mind the words which he should say to the castellan . Thus came he , haggard and hapless , on the leads of the tower , which were nought small ; and there gathered together in a knot , and all gazing eagerly out over the lake , he found a dozen of men - at - arms and the castellan amongst them . They took no heed of him as he came up , though he stumbled as he crossed the threshold and came clattering over the lead floor , and he saw at once that there was something unwonted toward ; but he had but one thought in his mind , to wit , the rescuing of Birdalone . He went up now behind where the castellan was leaning over the battlement , and pulled his skirt , and when Sir Aymeris turned round , he said : Lord , I have a word for thine ear . But the old knight did but half turn round , and then spake peevishly : Tush , man ! another time ! seest thou not I have got no eyes for aught save what we see on the lake ? Yea , but what then ? said the priest . There cometh a boat , said Sir Aymeris , not looking back at him , and our thought is that therein be our lords . When the priest heard that word , it was to him as if hell had opened underneath his feet ; and he had no might to speak for a minute ; then he cried out : Sir Aymeris , hearken , I pray thee . But the old knight but thrust him back with his hand , and even therewith one of the men - at - arms cried out : I hear the voice of their horn ! Then shouted Sir Aymeris : Where art thou , Noise ? Blow , man , blow , if ever thou blewest in all thy life ! And therewithal came the blare of the brass , and Sir Aymeris nodded to the trumpeter , who blew blast after blast with all his might , so that the priest might as well have been dumb for any hearing he might get ; and all the while to Leonard the minutes seemed hours , and he was well - nigh distraught . And then when the knight held up his hand for the Noise to stay his blowing , and Leonard strove to speak , the castellan turned on him and said : Peace , Sir Leonard ; dost thou not know that now we would listen with our ears to heed if they answer us ? Not a word any one man of you , learned or lewd , or ye shall rue it ! Even therewith came clearly the sound of the horn from the water , and again and yet again ; and no man spake but the chaplain , who cried out : Hearken , knight , it is of Birdalone . But Sir Aymeris laid his hand on his shoulder and said in an angry whisper : Thou shalt be put downstairs , priest , if thou hold not thy peace . Leonard drew aback scowling , and went out of the door , and so slowly down the stair , and withdrew him into the cover of the door of the first chamber down from the tower - top , with the mind to waylay Sir Aymeris as he came down ; and meanwhile he cursed him for a fool and a dull - wit , and himself yet more , as was but right , for a fool and a licorous traitor . But he had not tarried there more than a score of minutes , ere he heard a great shout from those up above : They are come ! they are come ! And next thereafter came all the men clattering down the stair past him , scarce refraining them from shoving each his neighbour on to the next one ; Leonard followed on them , and presently arose great shouting and tumult through all the house , and all folk , men and women , hurried flock - meal toward the water - gate , and with them went Leonard perforce ; and sick of heart he was , calling to mind the first coming thither of Birdalone . But now when they came to the water - gate , there verily was the Sending Boat just coming to hand ; and in the stern stood the three knights together , all clad in their armour , and before them sat three lovely ladies , clad one in gold , one in green , and one in black : and lo , there was the Quest come home . Chapter II ~ Now Ask They of Birdalone , and Sir Leonard Speaks Now the prow touched the stones of the stair , and folk were busy to lay hold of it that the wayfarers might land , but Sir Baudoin cried out in a great voice : Let none be so hardy as to touch this ferry , either now or hereafter ; for there is peril therein . And therewith he took Aurea by the hand , and led her out of the boat and up the stair , and she all joyous and wondering ; and thereafter came Hugh and his darling , and last of all Arthur and Atra , and she alone of the three women looked downcast , and her eyes wandered about the throng that was before them there , as though she sought something , yet feared to see it . But when they were all standing together on the landing - plain , and the folk were all about them in a ring , Sir Baudoin spake to the castellan and said : Sir Aymeris , thee and other folk I see here , the sight of whom doth me great joy ; but where , I pray thee , is the lady , our friend Birdalone , by whom it is that all we are come happily hither ? And he looked around with an anxious face ; but Arthur was as pale as ashes , yet he spake nought , and Atra let her hand fall away from his . Then spake the castellan , and said : No harm hath befallen the Lady Birdalone ; but whiles she hath been somewhat ailing of late , and it is like that she wotteth not what is toward , and keepeth her chamber now , for it is yet betimes in the morning . As he spake , came thrusting a man through the throng , eager and pale - faced ; who but the chaplain ; and he said : He would not let me speak , this fool ; I can not choose my time . Lords , I bear evil tidings and an ugly welcome home . The Lady Birdalone is in peril , and she is not in the castle ; I wot not where she is . Ye must send armed men to seek her out . Thereat fell the silence of woe upon the throng ; but Arthur ran forward on the priest with drawn sword , and cried out : I misdoubt me that thou art a traitor ; speak ! or I will slay thee here and now . If I be a traitor , quoth Leonard , I shall tell thee in little while what ye must do to undo my treason , if there be yet time thereto ; so slay me not till ye have heard , and then do what ye will with me . But Baudoin put Arthur aside , and said : Refrain thee a little , fair brother , else shall words tumble over each other and we shall know nothing clear . Sir Aymeris , bring our dear ladies to the fairest chambers , and do all honour and courtesy to them . And ye , sweetlings , ye will not begrudge us that we go to seek your friend . Thou priest , come with us a little apart , and tell thy tale as shortly as thou mayst , and fear nought ; we be not God ’s dastards , as the Red Knight and his men . Viridis wept and kissed her love before all folk , and bade him go and do his best to find her friend , or never come back to her else . Much moved , even to tears , was Aurea withal , and reached her hand to Baudoin , and said : If any man on earth can help us it is thou . Go thou . But Atra wept not , and but said to Arthur : Go thou , it is meet . Therewith were the ladies brought to fair chambers ; but the three knights went with the priest and Sir Aymeris into the solar , and set a guard at the door that their talk should be privy . Chapter III ~ How They Follow the Slot of Birdalone and the Black Knight It was but five minutes ere the priest had told them all that need was ; so they let him abide alone there , though sooth to say there was none of them but had good will to break his neck ; and the same rede had all three , that there was nought for it but to go their ways with all speed to the Black Valley of the Greywethers , and follow up the slot of Birdalone if it might yet be found ; wherefore they bade saddle their horses straightway ; and while that was a - doing they ate a morsel , and bade farewell to their lovelings . And they dight them to go , they three together , with but one squire and a sergeant , who were both of them keen trackers and fell woodsmen . But ere they went , by the rede of Arthur they bade Sir Aymeris to arm a two score of men and ride toward the Red Hold , and beset the ways ‘
82040	83570	82010	82010	they	2369	’ bidding and the luck of the Quest . Thereafter turned the talk as to what had befallen Birdalone , and the chances of coming on her ; and , as folk will in such a plight , they talked the matter over and over again till they were weary and could say no more . Then they went to sleep , and nought befell them till they awoke in the broad daylight ; but they had little inkling of what hour it was , for all the dale was full of thick white mist that came rolling down from the mountains , so that they could scarce see their hands before them , and there they had to tarry still , would they , would they not ; and the sergeant fell to telling tales of folk who had been lost in that stony maze ; and all of them deemed , more or less , that this was the work either of evil wights , or it might be of the wizardry of the Red Knight ; and , to be short , they all deemed that he it was who had wielded it , save the sergeant , who said that the mountain wights were the masters and not the servants of him of the Red Hold . Thus , then , it betided ; but when the said mist had been hanging upon them for some six hours , it rolled up like a curtain , and lo the blue sky and the sun , and the mountains as clear blue as in a picture ; and they saw by the sun that it was but a little after high noon . But as they rejoiced herein , and betook them once more to tracking out the slot of Birdalone and the other , the sky became suddenly overcast , and down from the jaws of the mountain came a storm of wind and rain , and thunder and lightning , so great that they might scarce see each other ’s faces , and when it cleared off , in about an hour and a half , and went down the wind to the south - east , the stream was waxen great , and ran brown and furious down the dale , so that it was fordable only here and there ; and as for tracking the slot of those twain , there was no need to talk thereof , for the fury of the driving rain had washed all away . Thus fared they the whole day betwixt fog and clear weather , and they laid them down to rest at night sore disheartened . When the day broke they talked together as to what was best to do ; and the sergeant aforesaid spake : Lords , said he , meseemeth I am more at home in the Black Valley than ye be ; heed ye not wherefore . Now so it is that if we tarry here till night come we wot not what of evil may betide us , or at the least we do nought . Or if we turn back and go southward out of the dale we shall be safe indeed ; but safe should we have been at your house , lords , and should have done no less . But now I shall tell you that , if ye will , lords , I shall guide you to a pass that goeth out of the head of the dale to our right hands , and so turneth the flank of the mountains , and cometh out into the country which lieth about the Red Hold ; and meseemeth it is thitherward that we must seek if we would hear any tidings of the lady ; for there may we lay in ambush and beset the ways that lead up to the Hold , by which she must have been brought if she hath not been carried through the air . How say ye , lords ? Soothly there is peril therein ; yet meseemeth peril no more than in our abiding another night in the Black Valley . Said Arthur : We heed not the peril if there be aught to be done ; wherefore let us be stirring straightway . And so said they all . Wherefore they gat to horse , and rode up to the very head of the valley , and the weather was now calm and bright . But the sergeant brought them to the pass whereof the stranger knight had spoken to Birdalone , which led into the Red Knight ’s country , and without more ado they entered it when it was now about three hours after noon . But the way was both steep and rough , so that they had much toil , and went not very far ere night fell upon them , and the moon was not yet up . So when they had stumbled on another two hours , and their horses were much spent and they themselves not a little weary , they laid them down to sleep , after they had eaten such meat as they had with them , in a place where was a little grass for the horses to bite ; for all the road hitherto had been mere grim stones and big rocks , walled on either side by stony screes , above which rose steep and beetling crags . In the dawn they arose again , and made no ado till they were in the saddle , and rode till they came to the crest of the pass , and came out thence after a while on to the swelling flank of a huge mountain ( as it might be the side of the mountain of Plinlimmon in Wales ) , which was grassed and nought craggy , but utterly treeless . Now the sergeant led them somewhat athwart the said mountain till they began to go down , and saw below them a country of little hills much covered with wood , and in a while , and ere it was noon , they were among the said woods , which were grown mostly with big trees , as oak here and beech there , and the going was good for them . Chapter IV ~ Of the Slaying of Friend and Foe So came they , three hours after noon , to where was a clearing in the woodland , and a long narrow plain some furlong over lay before them , with a river running along it , and the wood rose on the other side high and thick , so that the said plain looked even as a wide green highway leading from somewhence to somewhither . At the edge hereof their way - leader , the sergeant , bade draw rein , and said : Lords , we are now in the lands of the Red Hold , and therein is mickle peril and dread to any save stout hearts as ye be ; but meseems we are so steaded , that whatever may come out of the Black Valley of the Greywethers to the Red Hold , ye now may scarce miss . Yonder along this plain to the north lies the way to the said Hold , and any man coming from the head of the valley is sure to come by the way we have come , and will pass us not many yards at the worst from where we now be . On the other hand , if any come to the Hold from the mouth of the Black Valley , then along this green road must they needs pass under your very eyes . Lastly , if we do what we are come to do , to wit , to deliver the lady from the Red Knight , then , the deed done , we have to take the green road southward , and ride it for a league and then turn east , and we shall have our heads turned toward the Castle of the Quest , and shall speedily fall in with Sir Aymeris and our men who be guarding the out - gates of the Red Knight ’s country toward our house . So now , by my rede , ye shall lay in covert here and abide a while what may befall ; if nought come hereby ere two hours be lacking of sunset , then may we seek further . They all yeasaid this , and gat off their horses , and lay quiet on the grass , not even speaking save softly . And when they had abided thus scarce an hour ’s space , the squire , who was a man of very fine ear , held up his hand as though to bid utter silence , and all hearkened eagerly . Presently he said : Hear ye not ? Said Arthur : Meseemeth I hear a faint tinkle as of a sheep - bell . Said the squire : ’
83585	83802	82010	82010	they	2369	’ tis but of two : ride we thither ? Quoth Baudoin : Nay , not by my rede ; for if we can hear them they can hear us ; let us quietly edge along afoot somewhat nigher their way , ever keeping the cover of the wood betwixt us and the open plain . Now then to it ; and let each man keep his weapons ready . Even so did they , and spread out in a line as they went , in such wise that there was some six paces betwixt each man of them , and they went softly forward ; Baudoin went first , Hugh second , then Arthur ; then the squire and the sergeant last of all . Now when they had gone but a quarter of an hour , the squire caught up with Arthur , and spake to him softly , and said : The voice of the swords has been silent now a while , and I heard a voice crying out e’en now , a woman ’s voice . And now again I could well - nigh deem that I hear horse - hoofs . Arthur nodded to him , and they went but a little further ere he said : Lo , lo ! ’
83931	87289	87298	87298	Birdalone	108	‘ twixt her and the horse that she might walk , and round about her neck was hung a man ’s head newly hewn off . This sight they all saw at once , and were out of the wood in a trice with weapons aloft , for they knew both the man and the woman , that they were the Red Knight and Birdalone . So swift and sudden had they been , that he had no time either to spur or even to draw his sword ; but he had a heavy steel axe in his hand as the first man came up to him , which was the tall Baudoin ; and therewith he smote down on Baudoin so fierce and huge a stroke , that came on him betwixt neck and shoulder , that all gave way before it , and the Golden Knight fell to earth all carven and stark dead : but even therewith fell Hugh , the squire , and the sergeant on the Red Knight ; for Arthur had run to Birdalone and sheared her loose from her tether . The sergeant smote him on the right arm with a maul , so that the axe fell to the ground ; the squire ’s sword came on the side of his head , and , as it was cast back beneath the stroke , Hugh thrust his sword through the throat of him , and down he fell unto the earth and was dead in less than a minute . Then gathered the others round about Baudoin , and saw at once that he was dead ; and Birdalone came thrusting through the press of them , and knelt down beside him , and when she saw her friend so piteously dight , she wept and wailed over him as one who might not be comforted ; and Hugh stood over her and let his tears fall down upon the dead man ; and withal the squire and the sergeant did not refrain their lamentations , for sore beloved was Sir Baudoin the Golden Knight . But Arthur spake dry - eyed , though there was grief in his countenance , and he said : Fellows , and thou , lady , let us lament afterwards , but now is time for us to get us gone hence as speedily as may be . Yet I will ask , doth any know whose is this head that the slain tyrant here had hung about the lady ’s neck ? May the fiends curse him therefor ! Said the sergeant : Yea , lords , that wot I ; this is the head of the Red Knight ’s captain and head man , Sir Thomas of Estcliffe ; one of the hardiest of knights he was while he was alive , as ye surely wot , lords ; neither , as I have heard say , was he as cruel a tyrant as his lord that lieth there ready for the ravens . Now had Birdalone arisen and was standing facing Arthur ; her face was pale and full of anguish , and she was dabbled with blood from the dead man ’s neck ; but there was nought of shame in her face as she stood there and spoke : O my living friends , who have but now saved me , ye and my dead friends , from what shame and death I know not , the tale of this woeful hap is over long to tell if there be peril at hand , and I scarce alive from dread and sorrow ; but shortly thus it is : This man , whose head here lieth , entrapped me as I foolishly wandered in the Black Valley , and afterwards delivered me , and was leading me to your castle , my friends , when this other one , his master , the tyrant of the Red Hold , came upon him , and fell upon him and slew him as a traitor , and dighted me as ye saw . And woe ’s me ! I am the fool whose folly has slain your friend and mine . Wherefore I am not worthy of your fellowship , and ye shall cast me forth of it ; or to slay me were better . So she spake , gazing earnestly on Arthur ; and so troubled and grieved , that she might well have died but for her woodland breeding , and the toil of the days she had won through in the House under the Wood . But Hugh spake gently to her and said : Keep up thine heart yet , maiden ; for the hand of Fate it is that led thee , and none doeth grievously amiss but if he mean wrong - doing in his heart ; and we know thee for true ; and thou hast been our helper , and brought our lovelings unto us to make us happy . But she brake out weeping afresh , and said : O no , no ! it is but woe and weariness I have brought unto my friends ; and to myself woe and weariness yet more . And she looked piteously into Arthur ’s face , and hard and stern it seemed unto her ; and she writhed and wrung her hands for anguish . But he spake and said : This will we look into when we be safe behind our walls , and see what she hath done amiss and what not amiss . But now is there but one thing to do , and that is to get us speedily on our way to the Castle of the Quest , and bind our fellow ’s body on his horse that he also may ride with us , and the lady shall ride the horse of the accursed thief . Then they turned to go toward their horses ; but therewith Birdalone smote her foot against the slain knight ’s head , and shrank aback from it , and pointed down toward it and spake no word ; and Hugh said : Friends , the lady is right , this at least we will cover with earth . Do ye go fetch hither our horses , since we be on the road , and I will do here what need is meanwhile . So they went on that errand , and then Hugh and Birdalone between them dug a hole with the swords and laid the head of the captain of the Red Knight therein . And forsooth , somewhat would Birdalone have wept for him had she had a tear to spare . Then they fell to and bound the dead Baudoin on the Red Knight ’s mighty bay steed , so that no time might be wasted ; and when that was done , and the others had not come back with their horses , Hugh took Birdalone ’s hand and led her down to the stream and washed the gore off her bosom , and she washed her face and her hands and let him lead her back again in such wise that now she could hearken to the words of comfort he spake to her , and piteous kind he seemed unto her ; so that at last she plucked up heart , and asked him how Viridis did . Quoth he : They be all safe at home in the castle , and Viridis is well and loveth thee well . And Aurea was well , woe worth the while for her now ! As for Atra , she has not been so glad as the other twain , I wot not wherefore . Even as he spake were the others come up with the horses , and Arthur nodded yeasay when he saw what had been done with Baudoin dead ; and so they gat to horse , and Birdalone it was that rode Baudoin ’s steed . Then they went their ways , crossing the river into the wood ; and the sergeant was ever way - leader , but the squire led the horse which bore the sorrowful burden of the dead Knight of the Quest . Chapter V ~ They Come Home to the Castle of the Quest Now they had gone but some three hours , riding dreary and nigh speechless all of them , ere they began to know the land they were in , and that they were coming to the place where they might look presently to fall in with Sir Aymeris and his company ; and even so the meeting betid , that they saw men standing and going about their horses beside a little wood , and knew them presently for their folk , who mounted at once and spurred forward to meet them , spears aloft . Speedily then was the joy of those abiders turned into sorrow , nor may the grief of Sir Aymeris be told , so great it was ; and Birdalone looked on and saw the mourning and lamentation of the warriors , and eked was her anguish of mind ; and she beheld Arthur the Black Squire , how he sat still upon his horse with a hard and dreary countenance , and looked on those mourners almost as if he contemned them . But Sir Aymeris came up to Birdalone , and knelt before her and kissed her hand , and said : If my heart might rejoice in aught , as some day it will , it would rejoice in seeing thee safe and sound , lady ; here at least is gain to set beside the loss . She thanked him , but looked askance toward Arthur , who said : If that be gain , yet is there more , for the Red Knight lieth in the green plain for a supper to the wolf and the crow . Vengeance there hath been , and belike more yet may come . But now , if ye have lamented as much as ye deem befitteth warriors , let us tarry here no longer ; for even yet meseemeth shall we be safer behind walls , now that our chief and captain is slain , I scarce know in what quarrel . None naysaid it , so they all rode forth together , and the sergeant and the squire and Sir Hugh told of their tale what they might to Sir Aymeris and the others ; but Arthur held his peace , and rode aloof from Birdalone , whereas Sir Aymeris and Hugh rode on either side of her , and did not spare to comfort her what they might . They rode straight on , and made no stay for nightfall , and thus came home to the Castle of the Quest before the day was full ; and woeful was their entry as they went in the dawn underneath the gate of the said castle , and soon was the whole house astir and lamenting . As for Birdalone , when she got down from her horse in the gateway , and was stiff and weary of body , and all dazed and confused of mind , there was but little life in her ; nor could she so much as think of the new day and Aurea ’s awakening , but crept up unto her own chamber , so long as it seemed since she had left it , though it was but a little while ; and she cast herself upon the bed and fell asleep whether she would or not , and so forgat her much sorrow and her little hope . Chapter VI ~ Of the Talk Betwixt Birdalone and Viridis When she woke again , she had slept the night away , and it was broad day , and for a moment she lay wondering what was the burden upon her ; but presently she called it all to mind , and deemed it were well might she forget it all again . Anon she became aware of someone moving about the chamber , and she looked about unhappily ; and lo ! a woman , fair and dainty , clad all in green , and it was Viridis that had come there . But when she saw Birdalone stirring , she came up to her and kissed her sweetly and kindly , and wept over her , so that Birdalone might nowise refrain her tears . But when she might cease weeping , she said to Viridis : Tell me , art thou weeping for thy friend who is lost , and who shall be thy friend no more ; or thy friend whom thou hast found ? Said Viridis : Forsooth I have wept for Baudoin plenteously , and he is worthy of it , for he was valiant and true and kind . Said Birdalone : True is that ; but I meant not my question so ; but rather I would ask thee if thou weepest because thine heart must needs cast me away , or because thou hast found me again ? Quoth Viridis : Whoso may be dead , or whoso alive , but if it were Hugh , my loveling , I were rejoiced beyond measure to find thee , my friend . And again she kissed her as one who was glad and kind . But for new rest of soul and for joy , Birdalone fell a - weeping afresh . Again she spake : And what mind have the others about me ? For thou art but one , though the dearest , save . . . And would they punish me for my fault and folly that has slain the best man in the world ? If the punishment be short of putting me forth of their fellowship , I were fain thereof . Viridis laughed : Forsooth , she said , they have much to punish thee for ! whereas it was by thy doing and thy valiance that we all came together again and the Quest was accomplished . Nay , but tell me , said Birdalone , what do they say of me , each one of them ? Viridis reddened ; she said : Hugh , my mate , saith all good of thee ; though no one of carl - folk may be sorrier of the loss of his fellow . Aurea layeth not the death of her man upon thee ; and she saith : When the fountain of tears is dried up in me , I will see her and comfort her , as she me . Atra saith : she saith but little , yet she saith : So is it fated . I had done belike no better , but worse than she . Now turned Birdalone red and then pale again , and she said , but in a quavering voice : And the Black Squire , Arthur , what sayeth he ? Said Viridis : He sayeth nought of thee , but that he would hear all the tale of what befell thee in the Black Valley . Sweet friend , said Birdalone , I pray thee of thy kindness and sweetness that thou go unto him presently and bring him in hither , and then I will tell him all ; and he and thou and I together . Viridis said : There is this to be said , that when a man loveth a woman he coveteth her , to have her all wholly to himself , and hard and evil he groweth for the time that he misdoubteth her whom he loveth . And I will tell thee that this man is jealous lest thou wert never so little kind to the slain stranger knight whose head the tyrant hung about thee . Furthermore , I fear there is no help for it that thou wilt undo the happiness of one of us , that is Atra ; yet were it better that that befell later than sooner . And if Sir Arthur come in here to thee , and hath thy tale with none beside save me , meseems the poor Atra will feel a bitter smart because of it . Were it not better that we all meet presently in the solar , and that there thou tell thy tale to us all ? and thereafter shall we tell the tale of our deliverance and our coming hither . And thus doing , it will seem less like to the breaking up of our fellowship . Said Birdalone : It will be hard for me to tell my tale before Atra and before him . Might it not be that thou hearken to it here and now , and tell it to the others hereafter ? Nay , nay , said Viridis , I am not a proper minstrel to take the word out of thy mouth . Never shall I be able to tell it so that they shall trow it as if they had seen it all . Besides , when all is told , then shall we be more bound together again . I pray thee , and I pray thee , sweet , do so much for me as to tell thy tale to the fellowship of us . And if it be hard to thee , look upon it as my share of the punishment which is due to thee for falling into that mishap . Smiled Birdalone ruefully , and said : So be it ; and may the share of the others be as light as thine , sister . Yet soothly were I liefer that my body and my skin should pay the forfeit . But now , since I must needs do this , the sooner is the better meseemeth . In a little half hour , said Viridis , will I bring what is left of our fellowship into the solar to hearken thee . So come thou there unto us when thou art clad . And hear thou ! be not too meek and humble , and bow thyself to us in fear of our sorrow . For whereas thou didst speak of our punishing thee , there will be one there whom thou mayst easily punish to thy pleasure ; forsooth , friend , I rue that so it is ; but since it will not better be , what may I do but wish thee happy and him also . Therewith she turned and went out of the chamber , and Birdalone , left to herself , felt a secret joy in her soul that she might not master , despite the sorrow of her friends , whatever it might be . Chapter VII ~ Birdalone Telleth the Tale of Her Wandering Up the Valley of the Greywethers Now Viridis did as she said , and brought them all in to the solar ; there was none lacking save Baudoin , and they sat silently in a half ring , till the door opened and Birdalone came in to them , clad all simply in but a black coat ; and she made obeisance to them , and stood there with her head bent down as if they were her judges , for so in sooth she deemed them . Then Hugh bade her sit down amongst them ; but she said : Nay , I will not sit amongst you till ye have heard my story , and ye have told me that I am yet of your fellowship . None said aught ; Atra looked straight before her , and her eyes met not Birdalone ’s eyes ; Arthur looked down on the ground ; but Hugh and Viridis looked kindly on Birdalone , and to Viridis ’

So I arose , but smiled on him and said : Hold up thine heart , friend ! for thee shall be no prison at the Castle of the Quest , but the fair welcome of friends . He said nought , and mended not his cheer ; and in this plight we gat to horse and rode on for some three hours more , till we came out of the thick forest into a long clearing , which went like a wide highway of greensward between the thicket , and it seemed as if the hand of man had cleared that said green road . Thereto we had come , following a little river which came out on to the clearing with us , and then , turning , ran well - nigh amidst it toward the north . Now when we were come thither , and were betwixt the thicket and the water ’s edge , we drew rein , and it seemed to me as fair a stead as might be in the woodland , and I looked thereon well pleased and with a happy heart . But the knight said : Lady , art thou not exceeding weary ? Nay , said I , not in any wise . Said he : It is strange then , for so weary am I , that I must in any case get off my horse and lay me down on the grass here , or I shall drop from the saddle . And therewith he lighted down and stood by me a little , as to help me off my horse ; but I said to him : Knight , I pray thee , even if ye be weary , to struggle forward a little , lest we be in peril here . In peril ? quoth he ; yea , that might be if the Red Knight knew of our whereabouts ; but how should that be ? He spoke this heavily , as one scarce awake ; and then he said : I pray thee pardon me , lady , but for nought may I hold my head up ; suffer me to sleep but a little , and then will I arise and lead thee straight to thy journey ’s end . Therewithal he laid him down on the grass and was presently asleep , and I sat down by him all dismayed . At first , indeed , I doubted some treachery in him , for how might I trust him wholly after all that had come and gone ? but when I saw that there was no feigning in his sleep , I set that doubt aside , and knew not what to make of it . Thus passed an hour , and from time to time I shook him and strove to waken him , but it was all in vain ; so I knew none other rede than to abide his awakening ; for I knew not the way to take toward this castle ; and , moreover , though he were a knight , and armed , yet might it be perilous for him if he were left there alone and unguarded ; so I abode . But now came new tidings . Methought I heard the sound of the tinkling of weapons and armour ; the green highway so turned that a wood neb about an hundred yards to the north hid it from my sight , so that a man might have drawn somewhat near to us without being seen , came he on the hither side of the river . So I stood up hastily , and strung my bow , and took a shaft in my fingers , and no sooner was it done than there came a rider round about the aforesaid wood neb . He was all - armed and had a red surcoat , and rode a great shining bay horse . I kept my eye upon him while I stirred the sleeping knight with my foot , and cried to him to wake , but he scarce moved , and but uttered words without sense . Now the new - comer drew rein for a moment when he saw us , and then moved on a little toward me , but I nocked a shaft and pointed it at him , and cried out to him to stay . Then I heard a great rattling laugh come from him , and he shouted : Nay , do thou stay , fair wood - wife , and I will risk thy shafts to come at thee . But why doth not the sluggard at thy feet rise up and stand before me , if he be thy loveling ? Or is he dead ? His voice was harsh and big , and I feared him sore ; and it was as much because of fear as of hardihood , that I drew and loosed straightway ; and doubtless it was because of fear that I saw my shaft fly an inch or so over his right shoulder . I heard his rattling laugh again , and saw him bend forward as he spurred ; I knew that time lacked for drawing another shaft , so I caught up my skirts and ran all I might ; but swift - foot as I be , it availed me nought , for I was cumbered with my gown , and moreover I was confused with not knowing whither to run , since I wotted that in the water the horse would do better than I. So he was up with me in a twinkling , and reached out his hand and caught hold of me by the hair , and tugged me to him as he reined back his horse . Then he laughed again and said : Forsooth she will look better when she is no longer reddened and roughened with fleeing ; and , by Red Peter ! what limbs she hath . Then he let me loose and got off his horse , and shoved me on before him till we came to where the Black One lay still sleeping heavily . Then the Red Knight stood against me , and looked hard into my face ; and I saw how huge a man he was , and how a lock of bright red hair came out from under his sallet . His eyes were green and fierce underneath shaggy red eyebrows ; terrible he was to look on . Now he spake fiercely and roughly , and as though he had something against me : Tell me , thou , who thou art and who this is ? I answered nought , for fear had frozen my speech . He stamped his foot on the ground and cried : Hah ! art thou gone dumb ? Speak ! thou wert best ! I said , all quaking : My name is Birdalone ; I belong to no one ; I have no kindred : as for this man , I know not his name . He said : Comest thou from the Castle of the Quest ? Art thou the whore of those lily - and - rose champions there ? My heart was hot with anger in spite of my dread , but I spake : I came from the Castle of the Quest . He said : And this man ( therewith he turned about and spurned him in the side ) , where didst thou happen upon him ? Again I was silent , and he roared out at me : So thou wilt not answer ! Beware , or I may see how to compel the speech of thee . Now answer me this : Was it in the Black Valley of the Greywethers that ye two came together ? Again I knew not how to answer , lest I might do a wrong to him who had repented him of the wrong he had done me . But the Red Knight burst out a - laughing and said : It shall be remembered against thee , first , that thou didst let fly a shaft at me ; second , that thou didst run from me ; and thirdly , that thou hast been slack in answering my questions . But all this scathes me nought ; first , because thy shaft missed me ; second , because thy legs failed thee ( though they were fair to look on , running ) ; and third , because all thou canst tell me I know without thine answering . Now thee will I tell that this is Friday , and that ye two first met in the Black Valley on Tuesday ; now I will ask this last question , and thou mayst answer it or not as thou wilt ; for presently I shall wake this brisk and stirring knight , and I deem that he will tell me the truth of this if of nought else . Tell me , thou whore of the Questing Champions , where and how many times thou hast lain in this good knight ’s arms since last Tuesday ? Nowhere and never , quoth I. Thou liest , I doubt thee , said the Red Knight ; howsoever , let us see what this doughty one will say . Hah ! thou deemest he shall be hard to wake up , dost thou not ! Well , I shall see to that . He who giveth sleep may take it away again . Therewith he went up to the Black One and stooped adown over his head , and spake some words over him , but so softly that I heard not their import ; and straightway the sleeper rose up so suddenly that he wellnigh smote against the Red Knight . He stood awhile staggering , and blinking at the other one , but somehow got his sword drawn forth , and the Red Knight hindered him nought therein , but spake anon when the other was come to himself somewhat : The sele of the day to thee , Sir Thomas , True Thomas ! Fair is thy bed , and most fair thy bedfellow . The Black Knight drew aback from him and was now come awake , wherefore he stood on his guard , but said nought . Then said the Red Knight : Sir Thomas , I have been asking this fair lady a question , but her memory faileth her and she may not answer it ; perchance thou mayst do better . Tell me where and how many times hast thou bedded her betwixt last Tuesday and this ? Nowhere and never , cried Sir Thomas , knitting his brows and handling his sword . Hah , said the Red Knight , an echo of her speech is this . Lo , the tale ye have made up betwixt you . But at least , having done mine errand , though meseemeth somewhat leisurely , and having gotten the woman for me , thou art now bringing her on to the Red Hold , whatever thou hast done with her on the road ? I am not , said my fellow , I am leading her away from the Red Hold . Pity of thee , quoth the other , that thou hast fallen in with me , and thou but half - armed . And he raised aloft his sword ; but presently sank it again , and let the point rest on the earth . Then he spoke again , not mockingly as erst : A word before we end it , Thomas : thou hast hitherto done well by me , as I by thee . I say thou hast gotten this woman , and I doubt not that at first thou hadst the mind to bring her to me unminished ; but then thou wert overcome by her beauty , as forsooth I know thee woman - mad , and thou hadst meant to keep her for thyself , as forsooth I marvel not . But in thy love - making thou hast not bethought thee that keep her to thyself thou mayst not while I am above ground , save thou bewray me , and join thee to my foemen and thine . Because I am such a man , that what I desire that will I have . For this reason , when I misdoubted me of thee for thy much - tarrying , I cast the sleep over thee , and have caught thee . For what wilt thou do ? Doubt it not , that if our swords meet , I shall pay thee for trying to take my bedthrall from me by taking from thee no more than thy life . But now will I forgive thee all if thou wilt ride home quietly with me and this damsel - errant to the Red Hold , and let her be mine and not thine so long as I will ; and then afterwards , if thou wilt , she shall be thine as long as thou wilt . Now behold , both this chance and thy life is a mere gift of me to thee , for otherwise thou shalt have neither damsel nor life . Yea , yea , said my friend , I know what thou wouldest : I have been no unhandy devil to thee this long while , and thou wouldst fain keep me still ; but now I will be devil no longer , on this earth at least , but will die and take my luck of it . And do thou , God , see to the saving of this damsel , since thou hast taken the matter out of my hands . Farewell , dear maiden ! Scarce was the word out of his mouth ere his sword was in the air , and he smote so fierce and straight that he beat down the huge man ’s blade , and , ere he could master it again , smote the Red Knight so heavily on the crest that he fell to his knees ; and the heart rose in me , for I deemed that he might yet prevail ; and in as ’
93087	94026	93056	93056	she	109	’ church at Greenford , a fair picture of the Blessed , and they walking in the meads of Paradise , clad in like raiment , men and women ; their heads flower - crowned , their feet naked in the harmless blossomed grass ; hand in hand they walk , with all wrath passed for ever , all desire changed into loving - kindness , all the anguish of forgiveness forgotten . And underneath the picture is it writ : Bitter winter , burning summer , never more shall waste and wear ; Blossom of the rose undying brings undying springtide there . O for the hope of it , that I might hope it ! O for the days to be and the assuaging of sorrow : I speak the word , and the hope springeth ; the word is spoken , and there abideth desire barren of hope ! And she bowed down her head and wept bitterly ; and Birdalone called to mind her kindness of the past and wept for her , she also . After a while Atra lifted up her head , and thus she spake : I hate thee not , Birdalone ; nor doth one say such things to a foe . Yea , furthermore , I will crave somewhat of thee . If ever there come a time when thou mayst do something for me , thou wilt know it belike without my telling thee . In that day and in that hour I bid thee remember how we stood together erst at the stair - foot of the Wailing Tower in the Isle of Increase Unsought , and thou naked and fearful and quaking , and what I did to thee that tide to comfort thee and help and save thee . And then when thou hast called it to mind , do thou for me what thou canst do . Wilt thou promise this ? Yea , yea , said Birdalone ; and with all the better will , that oft and over again have I called it to mind . Wherefore I behight thee to let me serve thee if I may whenso the occasion cometh , even if it be to my own pain and grief ; for this I know thou meanest . See thou to this then , said Atra coldly ; and thou shalt be the better for it in the long run belike : for thou art a happy woman . She arose as she spake , and said : Hist ! here come the lords from the murder - council ; and lo , now that he cometh , my heart groweth evil toward thee again , and well - nigh biddeth me wish that thou wert naked and helpless before me again . Lo my unhap ! that he should mark my face that it shows as if I were fain to do thee a mischief . And nought of that would I do ; for how should it avail me , and thou my fellow and the faithful messenger of the Quest ? Now little of her last words did Birdalone meet , as into the hall came Hugh and Arthur ; and though she strove to sober her mind and think of her she - friend and her unhappiness , yet she could not choose but to be full of joy in her inmost heart now she knew without doubt that she was so well - beloved of her beloved : and she deemed that Atra was in the right indeed to call her a happy woman . So now they all went into the solar together , and sat them down with the two others ; and Hugh did them to wit , how they had ordered all the matter of the messengers who were to summon the knights and chiefs of thereabouts , and the aldermen of Greenford , to meet at the Castle of the Quest , that they might set afoot the hosting to go against the Red Hold . Chapter IX ~ Hugh Tells the Story of the Quest ’s Ending . When this was said , and there had been silence a while , Birdalone took up the word , and spake meekly and sweetly , saying : Dear friends , how it fared with you on the isle from the time of my leaving you , and how with you , true knights , from the time of your departure , I both were fain to know for the tale ’s sake , and also I would take the telling thereof as a sign of your forgiveness of my transgression ; so I would crave the same of you but if it weary you overmuch . All they yeasaid her kindly , and Hugh spake and said : By your leave , fellows , I will tell in few words what betid us on our way to the Isle of Increase Unsought , and then shall Viridis take up the tale from the time that Birdalone left the said isle in the witch ’s ferry . None said aught against it , and Hugh went on : Short is my tale of the journey : We came to the Isle of Nothing on the morrow ’s morn of our departure , and being warned of thee , Birdalone , we abode there but a little while to rest us from the boat , and went nowhither from the strand , and so went on our way in a three hours ’
103980	110123	103970	103970	Atra	109	’ ) , we so clad them with kisses that they were not ill - covered belike . So gat we aboard our ferry , and did blood - offering to the wight thereof , and so sped merrily and lovingly over the wide lake back on our homeward road . And we said : This hath the dear Birdalone done for us . And now , my Viridis , I will that thou fill up the tale by telling to Birdalone , as ye told us , how it fared with you three and the evil one from the time that ye sped Birdalone on her way till the moment when mine eyes first beheld you made fast to the pillars of the palace which has crumbled into dust . Chapter X ~ How It Fared with the Three Ladies After the Escape of Birdalone Viridis took up the word without more ado , and said : I will do my best herein , and ye , sisters , must set me right if I err . When we had seen the last of you , dear Birdalone , that early morning , we turned back again to the house as speedily and as covertly as we might , lest the witch might espy our disarray and question us thereover . Then we went to the wonder - coffer , and gat thereout raiment for that which we had given away , which was easy for us to do , whereas the witch - mistress was so slothful that she had given to us the words of might wherewith to compel the coffer to yield , so that we might do all the service thereof , and she not to move hand or foot in the matter . So when we were clad , and the time was come , we went into the hall , by no means well assured of our mistress . When we came before her , she looked on us in surly wise , as her wo nt was , and said nought for a while ; she stared on us and knit her brows , as if she strove to call to mind something that ran to and fro in her memory ; and I noted that , and for my part I trembled before her . But she spake at last : Meseemeth as if there is a woman in the isle besides you three ; some misdoer that I was minded to punish . Tell me , you ! was there not a naked one who came into this hall a while ago , one whom I threatened with pining ? Atra , who was the boldest of us , bowed the knee before her , and said : Nay , our lady , since when do stranger women come naked into thine hall , and dare thee there ? Said the witch : Yet have I an image of a naked woman standing down there before me ; and if I have it in mine eye , so should ye . Tell me therefore , and beware , for We are not bidden to hold Our hand from you if We take you in misdeeds . If I quaked before , now much more I quaked , till my legs well - nigh failed me for fear ; but Atra said : Great lady , this image will belike be of that one whom a while ago ye had stripped and tied to a pillar here , and tormented while ye feasted . The lady looked on her hard , and again seemed striving to gather up the thrums of some memory , and then her face became smooth again , and she spake lightly : All that may well be ; so do ye go about your due service , and trouble Our rest here no longer ; for We love not to look on folk who be not wholly Our own to pine or to spare , to slay or let live , as We will ; and We would that the winds and the waves would send Us some such now ; for it is like to living all alone to have but such as you with Us , and none to cower before Us and entreat Us of mercy . So begone , I bid you . Thus for that time were we saved from the witch ’s cruelty ; but our time came before long . The days wore heavily , nor kept we count of them lest we should lose heart for the weariness of waiting . But on a day as we stood on the steps of the perron and served my lady with dainties , of a hot afternoon , came two great white doves a - flying , who pitched down right before our mistress ’s feet ; and each had a gold ring about his neck , and a scroll tied thereto , and the witch bade us take the doves and take off the scrolls and give them unto her ; and she looked on the gold rings which the doves bore , and for a moment on the scrolls , and then she said : Take ye the doves and cherish them , lest We have need of them ; take also the two scrolls and keep them till tomorrow morning , and then give them into Our hands . And look ye to this , that if ye give them not unto Us it will be treason against Us , and We shall have a case against you , and your bodies will be Ours . Then she rose up slowly , and bade me to her that she might lean upon my shoulder and be helped upstairs , so slothful a beast as she was ; and as we went up I heard her say softly to herself : Weary on it , now must I drink a sup of the Water of Might , that I may remember and do and desire . But dear is my sister , and without doubt she hath matters of import to tell me by these doves . So when we were together alone I told the others hereof , and we talked it over ; and they deemed the tidings ill , even as I did ; for we might not doubt but that the doves were a sending from the witch - sister who dwelt at the House under the Wood ; and sore we misdoubted that they were sped to our mistress to tell her of thee , Birdalone , and mayhappen of the Quest , so wise as we knew she was . As to the two scrolls , forsooth , they were open , and not sealed ; but when we looked on them we could make nought of it ; for though they were writ fairly in Latin script , so that we read them , yet of the words no whit might we understand , so we feared the worst . But what might we do ? we had but two choices , either to cast ourselves into the water , or abide what should befall ; and this last one we chose because of the hope of deliverance . Next morning , therefore , we came before our mistress in the hall , and we found her pacing up and down before the dais ; though her wo nt was at that hour to be sitting in her throne of gold and ivory , lying back on the cushions half asleep . So Atra went up to her , and knelt before her and gave her the scrolls , and she looked on her grimly , and smiled evilly , and said : Kneel there yet ; and ye others kneel also , till I see what befitteth you . So did we , and indeed I was fain to kneel , for I might scarce stand up for terror ; and all of us , our hearts died within us . But the witch read those scrolls to herself , sitting in her throne , and spake not a long while ; then she said : Come hither , and grovel before Us , and hearken ! Even so we did ; and she said again : Our sister , who hath been so kind unto you , and saved you from so many pains , here telleth Us , by the message of the two doves , that ye have betrayed Us and her , and have stolen her thrall and her Sending Boat , and sent her an errand for Our destruction ; and therewith she delivereth you into Our hands , and ye are Ours henceforward ; nor is it to be thought that ye may escape Us . Now , for your treason , some would slay you outright here and now , but We will be merciful , and let you live , and do no more than chastise you sharply now ; and thereafter shall ye be Our very thralls to do as We will with : thereafter , that is to say , when they whom ye have sent Our sister ’s thrall to fetch have come hither ( as belike I may scarce stay them ) , and I have foiled them and used them , and sent them away empty . Now I tell you , that meanwhile of their coming shall ye suffer such things as We will ; and when they be here We will not forbid you to be anigh them ; but We shall see that there will be little joy to you in that nighness . Yea , ye shall know now to what market ye have brought your wares , and what the price of treason is therein . Verily then we suffered at her hand what she would , whereof it would shame me to tell more as at this present ; and thereafter did she chain us to those three pillars of the hall whereas ye found us chained ; and we were fed as dogs be , and served as dogs , but we endured all for the sake of hope ; and when we durst , and deemed the witch would not hear us , we spake together and enheartened each other . But on the fourth day of our torment came the witch to us , and gave us to drink a certain red water from out of a leaden flasket ; and when I drank I deemed it was poison , and was glad , if gladness might be in me at such a tide ; and when I had drunk I felt an icy chill go through all my body , and all things swam before my eyes , and deadly sickness came over me . But that passed away from me presently , and I felt helpless and yet not feeble ; all sounds heard I clearer than ever yet in my life ; also I saw the hall , every arch and pillar and fret , and the gleam on the pavement from the bright sun that might not enter ; and the witch I saw walking up and down the hall by the dais ; but my sisters I saw not when I looked across to their pillars . Moreover , I might not see myself when I reached out my hand or my foot , though I saw the chain which made my ankle fast to the pillar ; and withal , when I set my hand on my face , or any other part of my body , or what else I might touch , I felt there what I looked to feel , were it flesh or linen , or the cold iron of my fetter , or the polished face of the marble pillar . Now I knew scarce if I were alive or dead , or if I were but beginning to be dead ; but there came upon me the desire of life , and I strove to cry out to the sisters , but though I formed the words in my mouth , and did with my throat as when one cries out aloud , yet no sound of a voice came from me , and more helpless did I feel than erst . But even therewith I saw the witch come toward me , and therewith all my body felt such fear of her that I knew I was not dead . Then she came before me and said : O shadow of a thrall , whom none can see but them unto whom wisdom hath given eyes to see wonders withal , now have I tidings for thee and thy sisters , to wit , that your lovers and seekers are at hand ; and presently I shall bring them into this hall , and they shall be so nigh unto you that ye might touch them if I did not forbid it ; but they shall not see you , but shall wonder where I have hidden you , and shall go seeking you today and many days , and shall find you not at all . So make ye the most of the sight of them , for in them henceforward ye have no other part or lot . Therewith she spat out at me , and went over to my sisters , and said words of like import to those which she had said unto me . And presently she went out of the hall ; and not long afterwards I heard voices speaking on the perron , and knew one for the voice of the witch , and the other for the voice of my lord Baudoin ; and then again wore a little while , and I saw the witch come through the great door of the hall leading Sir Arthur by the hand , as if she were his dear friend , and Baudoin and Hugh , my man , following them . And the said witch was clad full fair , and had laid by her sloth and stupid pride , as meseemed ; and her limbs were grown rounder and sleeker , and her skin fairer , so that to them that knew her not she might well seem to be a goodly woman . Now they sat to meat as my man hath told you , and then departed from the hall , and the witch also . But after a while she came back again and loosed us , and grimly bade us go with her , and needs must we , though we could not so much as see our own feet upon the floor . And she set us to tasks about the house , and stood by while we toiled for her , and mocked us not without stripes , and in all ways was as rough and cruel and hard with us as she had been smooth and debonair to our lords ; but after noon she brought us back and chained us to our pillars again . And when the evening came and the banquet was , it was we who were the unseen players of the string - play ; and we might play no other melody than what the witch bade us ; else belike , could we have held converse , we might have played such tunes as would have smitten the hearts of our loves , and told them that we were anigh . To make a short story of it , thus did she day by day , and no comfort or converse might we sisters have of each other , or of aught else save the sight of our beloved ones , and a glimmer of hope therewith . And , forsooth , for as grievously as my heart was wrung by the yearning of me for my love , yet was it a joy unto me to think that he went there desiring me , and that whom he desired was not the poor wretched creature chained there in her nakedness , with her body spoiled by torment and misery , but the glad maiden whom he had so often called fair and lovesome . So passed the days , and at last hope had grown so pale and wan , that she was no more to be seen by us than we were by our lords ; and now it seemed to me that death was coming , so feeble and wretched as I grew . But the witch would not let us die , but sustained us from time to time with some little draughts of a witch - drink that revived us . So wore the time till that evening , when came hope together with the fulfilment of hope , so that one minute we durst hope for deliverance , and the next we were delivered . Nor is there more to tell , Birdalone , my dear , save that we came safely to the Isle of the Young and the Old in the full morning - tide ; and as our ferry drew nigh the green shore , there were the two younglings whereof thou didst tell us awaiting our landing , and when we stepped ashore they came to us bearing cakes and fruit in a fair basket , and they made much of us and we of them . And so we came to the old man , who was exceeding fain of us , and grand and courteous , till he became a little drunk , and then he was somewhat over - kind to us women . Nevertheless , there in that pleasant isle we rested us for three days , that we might somewhat calm and refresh our spirits with what was small and of little account . And when we departed , the old man followed us down to the strand , and lamented our departure , as he had done with our lords erewhile ; only this time yet greater was his lamentation , and needs must we kiss him , each one of us , or never had he been done . So he turned up landward , bewailing the miss of us , but presently , before we had seen the last of him , was cheerful again and singing . So we went on our way ; and we also , we maidens , in our turn , saw those woeful images of the Isle of Queens and the Isle of Kings ; and we came to the Isle of Nothing , and abode warily by our ferry , and so came away safe , and thus , as thou wottest , home to the castle to hear evil tidings of thee . Now is this all my tale . Birdalone sat shyly and hushed when all was done ; and then all they did somewhat to comfort her , each after their own fashion ; and now sorrow for the slain man was made softer and sweeter for them , whereas they had to lose not two fellows , but one only . Yet , despite of all , trouble and care was on Birdalone ’s soul betwixt the joy of loving and being beloved , and the pain and fear of robbing a friend of her love . For Atra ’s face , which she might not hate , and scarce might love , was a threat to her day by day . Chapter XI ~ Birdalone and the Black Squire Talk Together in the Hall of the Castle . Now within a few days was the body of Baudoin laid in earth in the chapel of the castle ; and in the solemnest of fashions was the burial done . When it was over , the two knights and Sir Aymeris turned them heartily to dighting the war against the Red Hold , and less than a month thereafter was the hosting at the Castle of the Quest , and if the host were not very many ( for it went not above sixteen hundreds of men all told ) , yet the men were of the choicest , both of knights and sergeants and archers . There then they held a mote without the castle , whereas Arthur the Black Squire was chosen for captain , and in three days they were to depart for the Red Hold . Now this while Birdalone had seen but little of Arthur , who was ever busy about many matters , and never had she had any privy talk with him , though sore she longed for it ; yet indeed it was more by her will than his that so it was . But when it was come to the very last day before the departure , she said that she must needs see him before he went , and he perchance never to come back again . So when men were quiet after dinner she went into the hall and found him there , pacing up and down the floor . For indeed she had sent a word to him by Leonard the priest that he should be there . So she went up to him , and all simply she took him by the hand and led him into a shot - window and set him down by her ; and he , all trembling for love and fear of her , might not forbear , but kissed her face and her mouth many times ; and she grew as hot as fire , and somewhat she wept . Then she spake after a while : Dear friend , I had it in my mind to say to thee many things that meseems were sage , but now neither will the thought of them come into my mind , nor the words into my mouth . And this is a short hour . And therewith she fell to kissing him , till he was well - nigh beside himself betwixt desire and joy and the grief of departure , and the hardness of the case . But at last she forbore and said : Will it not be when thou art gone tomorrow as it was when ye were away upon the Quest , and I knew not how to bear myself , so heavy lay all the world and its doings and its fashion upon me ? It will be hard to me , he said ; evil and grim will be the days . She said : And yet , even now in these last days , when I see thee oft , every day my soul is worn with grief , and I know not what to do with myself . I shall come back , he said , and bear my love with me , and then belike we shall seek some remedy . She was silent a while , and then she said : Meanwhile of thy coming , and I see thee not at all for many days , how will it be with my grief then ? Quoth he : More than enough of grief no soul may bear ; for either death comes , or else some dullness of the pain , and then by little and little the pain weareth . Then she said : And how would it be if thou come not back and I see thee never again , or if when thou come back thou find me not , for that I be either dead or gone away out of thy reach ? He said : I know not how it would be . When thou sayest thou shalt die , dost thou wholly believe it in thy sense or thy body otherwise than Holy Church would ? I will tell thee , she said , that now I am sitting by thee and seeing thy face and hearing thy voice , it is that only which I believe in ; for I may think of nought else of either grief or joy . Yea , when I wept e’en now , it was not for sorrow that I wept , but for I can not rightly tell what . And she took his hand and looked fondly upon him . But presently she looked on his hand , and said : And now meseemeth that we twain are grown to be such close friends that I may ask thee what I will , and thou be neither angry , nor wonder thereat . I see on thy finger here the ring that I brought with me from the Isle of Increase , and which thereafter thou hadst of me when I gave thee back also the shoon which were lent unto me . Tell me how thou hadst it back from Atra , as I suppose thou gavest it unto her . But how now art thou angry ? for I see the blood come up in thy face . Nay , beloved , said he , I am not angry , but whenso I hear of Atra , or think of her closely , shame comes on me and confusion , and maybe fear . But now will I answer thee . For even in those hours which we wore on the Isle of the Young and the Old , when all we should have been so happy together , she divined somewhat of my case , or indeed , why do I not say it out , all thereof . And she spake to me such words ( for she is both tender and wise and strong of heart ) that I cowered before her and her grief and pain ; and she gave me back the said ring , which forsooth I gave to her in the Sending Boat in the first hour that the Isle of Increase lay astern of us . And I wear it now as a token of my grief for her grief . See now , love , since I have answered thee this question without anger or amaze , thou needest not fear to ask me any other ; for this of all things lies closest to my heart . Birdalone drooped her head , and she spake in a low voice : Lo now ! the shadow of parting and the shadow of death could not come between our present joy ; but this shadow of the third one cometh between us and is present between us . Woe ’s me ! how little did I think of this when thou wert away and I was sick of longing for the sight of thee , and deemed that that would heal it all . He spake not , but took her hand and held it ; and presently she looked up again and said : Thou art good , and wilt not be angry if I ask thee something else ; this it is : Why wert thou so grim with me that other day when ye found me in that evil plight in tow of the Red Tyrant , so that I deemed that thou of all others hadst cast me off ? That was worse to me than the witch ’s stripes , and I kept thinking to myself : How simple was my trouble once , and now how tangled and weary ! Then he might not refrain him , but threw himself upon her , and clipped her and kissed her all he might , and she felt all the sweetness of love , and lacked nought of kindness and love to him . And thereafter they sat still awhile , and he said , as if her question had but that moment left her lips : This , forsooth , was the cause that I looked grim on thee : first , that from the time I first saw thee and heard thy tale , and of thy deeds , I had deemed thee wise above the wisdom of women . But this going forth of thee to the Black Valley , whereof came the slaying of Baudoin , seemed unto me a mere folly , till again I had heard thy tale of that also ; and then the tale and thy speech overcame me . But again , though I was grieved and disappointed hereat , belike that had passed from me speedily , but then there was this also which would not let my soul rest , to wit , that I feared concerning that slain knight whose head the Red One had hung about thy neck ; for how else , methought , might he have been so wroth with him and thee ; and meseemed , moreover , that thou wert kind in thine heart to the dead man , even when we were come to thee ; and then , seest thou , my desire for thee and the trouble of Baudoin ’s slaying , and the black trouble aforesaid . Lo now , I have told thee this . When wilt thou cease to be angry with me ? She said : I ceased to be grieved with thine anger when thine anger died ; yet strange , meseemeth , that thou shouldst trust me so little when thou lovest me so much ! And she leaned against him and caressed him gently , and again was he at point to take her in his arms , when lo ! the sound of men coming unto the screen of the hall ; so then those two stood up and went to meet them , and there was the speech of their sundering done . Yet belike for a little while both those twain were happy . Chapter XII ~ The Knights and Their Fellows Betake Them to the Assaulting of the Red Hold On the morrow , when the day was yet young , the knights were ready for departure , and in the very gate they bade farewell to the ladies , who kissed them kindly one and all , and Viridis wept sore ; and Atra constrained herself to do even as the others did ; but pale she was and quaking when she kissed Arthur and watched him get a - horseback . But the knights bade their ladies be of good cheer , for that they would send them tidings of how they sped every seven days at least , whereas it was no long way thence to the Red Hold , save there were battle on the road , and they deemed their host which should beset the Hold would be enough to clear all the ways behind it . For that same cause withal they had Sir Aymeris with them , nor left a many men behind them , and they under the rule of three squires , whereof two were but young , and the third , who was made the captain of the castle , was an old and wise man of war , who had to name Geoffrey of Lea . There , withal , was the priest Sir Leonard , who went about now much hushed and abashed , and seemed to fear to give a word to Birdalone ; albeit she deemed of him that his thoughts of her were the same as erst they had been . So now when the knights were departed , and all the host was gone out of sight , it was heavy time indeed in the Castle of the Quest till they should hear tidings of them again . Both Aurea and Atra kept much to themselves , and did I know not what to wear away the time ; for now it was not to be looked for that they should venture out - a - gates . But as for Viridis , she waxed of better cheer after a while , but whatever betid she would not sunder herself from Birdalone ; nay , not for an hour ; and Birdalone took all her kindness kindly , though forsooth it was somewhat of a pain unto her ; it shall be told wherefore ere long . Withal , as if to wear the time , Birdalone betook her diligently to her needlework , and fell to the cunningest of broidery ; so that Viridis and the others wondered at her , for when they were done it seemed indeed that the flowers and creatures and knots had grown of themselves upon the cloth , such wondrous work it was . Moreover , to his great joy , the very first day of the departure of the host she called Sir Leonard unto her , and prayed to go on again with the learning her fair scribe - craft ; and therein also was she diligent hours of every day ; and Viridis would sit beside her wondering at the deftness of her fingers , and crying out for joy as the page grew fair and well - learned under them . Thus wore a week , and at the end thereof came a messenger from the host and told how they had come before the Red Hold and had summoned them thereof to yield , which they had utterly denied to do , but defied the host ; wherefore the host had now beset the Hold , and more folk were daily flocking unto them ; but that the said Hold would be hard to win by plain assault , whereas it was both strong and well - manned ; but few of the host had been slain or hurt as yet , and of the chieftains not one . Right glad were they of the castle because of these tidings ; though , forsooth , the men - at - arms knew well enough that the time would soon come when some fierce assault would be made , and then , forsooth , would be sore peril of life and limb unto the chieftains . Chapter XIII ~ Birdalone Bethinks Her to Fulfil the Promise Made Unto Atra Again wore a week , and once more came the messenger , and did them of the castle to wit that there had been nought more done at the Red Hold , save skirmishing at the barriers , wherein few were hurt on either side ; and also that the engines for battering the walls were now well - nigh all dight , and they would begin to play upon the Hold , and in especial one which hight Wall - wolf , which had been set up by the crafts of Greenford . This tidings also was deemed good by all , save it might be by Atra , who , as Birdalone deemed , pined and fretted herself at the delay , and would fain that , one way or other , all were over . Atra spake but little to Birdalone , but watched her closely now ; oft would she gaze on her wistfully , as if she would that Birdalone would speak unto her ; and Birdalone noted that , but she might not pluck up heart thereto . Wore a third week , and again came the messenger , and told how three days ago , whenas Wall - wolf had sorely battered one of the great towers which hight the Poison - jar , and overthrown a pan of the wall there beside , they had tried an assault on the breach , and hard had been the battle there , and in the end , after fierce give and take , they of the Hold had done so valiantly that they had thrust back the assailants , and that in the hottest brunt the Black Squire had been hurt in the shoulder by a spear - thrust , but not very grievously ; but withal that he sent , in so many words , forbidding the ladies to make any account of so small a matter . And , quoth the sergeant , most like my lord will wear his armour in four days ’
113339	116067	116075	116076	the master	2080	’ riding ; and on the third day a little town , hight Upham , where are but few folk save at the midsummer wool - fair , which is now gone by . Now there is a highway cometh into this road from out of the tilled country and Appleham , a good town , and goeth through it toward the tillage , and the City of the Bridges and the liberties thereof ; and all the land is much builded and plentiful ; but , if thou wilt , we will not take either highway , but wend over the downland which lieth north - east of Upham , and though it be roadless , yet is it not ill - going , and I know it well and its watering - places , little dales and waters therein all running north - east , wherein be certain little thorps here and there , which shall refresh us mightily . Over that downland we may wend a four days , and then the land will swell up high , and from the end of that high land we shall behold below us a fair land of tillage , well watered and wooded , and much builded ; and in the midst thereof a great city with walls and towers , and a great white castle and a minster , and lovely houses a many . In that city mayst thou dwell and earn thy livelihood if thou canst do aught of crafts . And if thou mayst not , then may we find somewhat to swink at for a wage , and so maintain thee and us . But the said city is called the City of the Five Crafts , and the land round about it is the frank thereof ; and oftenest , frank and city and all , it is called the Five Crafts all simply . Now what sayest thou hereof , my lady ? She said : I say that we will go thither , and that I thank thee and thy sons of thy good - will , and so may God do to me as I reward you well therefor . But tell me , good Gerard , how it is that thou art so willing to leave kith and kin to follow a gangrel wife along the ways ? Said Gerard : Dame , I think that the face and body of thee might lead any man that yet had manhood in him to follow thee , even if he left house and all to go with thee . But as for us , we have no longer a house or gear , whereas they of the Red Hold lifted all my bestial , and burned my house and all that was therein a month ago . Yea , said Birdalone , and how befalleth it , then , that ye are not before the Red Hold to avenge thee ? Dame , said he , when the muster was I was deemed somewhat over old , wherefore the sheriff took me not , but suffered my sons also to abide behind to earn a living for me ; may God be good to him therefor , and St. Leonard ! But as to my kindred , I must tell thee that I am not kinned hereabout , but in a good town hight Utterhay , and that when our alderman sent for me to bring me to thee , I was more than half - minded to get me back thither . Now sooth it is that the best way thither , though it may be indeed the safest rather than the shortest , lies through the Five Crafts ; for the road goes thence to Utterhay a three score miles or so , making the longer of it , as it skirteth ever some way off a perilous forest , a place of sore dread and devilish , which hight Evilshaw , on the edge whereof lieth Utterhay , a merry cheaping - stead and a plenteous , and the home of my kindred . Wherefore now is the City of the Five Crafts handy to us ; because when thou hast done with us , as I hope it may be long first , then are we others nigh home , and may all simply wend our way thither . Birdalone thanked him again full heartily ; but therewithal as they rode along there seemed to stir in her some memory of the earliest of her days in the witch ’s house , and she began to have a longing to betake her to Utterhay and the skirts of Evilshaw . Chapter II ~ Of Birdalone and Her Fellowship , Their Faring Over the Downland Thus rode they along and loitered not , though they talked blithely together ; and Birdalone wondered to herself that she might so much as hold up her head for bitter thoughts of the days and the longings but late passed away , but so it was , that it was only now and again that they stung her into despair and silence , and for the most part she hearkened to the talk of the old man and the lads about the days of Greenford and the alarms of lifting and unpeace , and the ways of the chapmen and the craftsmen . An hour after noon they rested in a little dale of the downland where was a pool and three thorn - bushes thereby ; and when they had lighted down , the old man knelt before Birdalone and took her hand , and swore himself her man to do her will , whatso it were ; and then he stood up and bade his sons do likewise ; so they two knelt before her in turn , somewhat shy and abashed , for all that they were such stout , bold fellows , and found it hard to take her hand , and then when they had it in theirs , hard to let it go again . A score of miles and five they rode that day , and had no roof over them at night save the naked heaven , but to Birdalone that was but little scathe : they made a shift to have some fire by them , and the three men sat long about it that even while Birdalone told them somewhat of her life ; and as she told of the House under the Wood and the Great Water , Gerard had some inkling of whereabouts it was ; but was nought so sure , because , as abovesaid in this tale , seldom did any from the world of men venture in Evilshaw , or know of the Great Water from its banks that gave unto the forest . In like wise they rode the next day , and came at eventide to a thorp in a fair little dale of the downland , and there they guested with the shepherd - folk , who wondered much at the beauty of Birdalone , so that at first they scarce durst venture to draw nigh unto her until Gerard and his sons had had some familiar converse with them ; then indeed they exceeded in kindness toward them , in their rough upland fashion , but ever found it hard to keep their eyes off Birdalone , and that the more after they had heard the full sweetness of her voice ; whereas she sang to them certain songs which she had learned in the Castle of the Quest , though it made her heart sore ; but she deemed she must needs pay that kindly folk for their guestful and blithe ways . And thereafter they sang to the pipe and the harp their own downland songs ; and this she found strange , that whereas her eyes were dry when she was singing the songs of love of the knighthood , the wildness of the shepherd - music drew the tears from her , would she , would she not . Homelike and dear seemed the green willowy dale to her , and in the night ere she slept , and she lay quiet amidst of the peaceful people , she could not choose but weep again , for pity of the bitter - sweet of her own love , and for pity of the wide world withal , and all the ways of its many folk that lay so new before her . Chapter III ~ They Come to the City of the Five Crafts , and Birdalone Meets with the Poor - Wife They made not so much way that they came to the Five Crafts on the fourth day , but lay under the bare heavens in a dale below the big swell of the downland , whereof Gerard spake . But betimes in the morning Birdalone arose and stirred up her men , and they gat to horse , and rode the hill before them till they came on to the crest thereof . Then Birdalone cried aloud with joy to see the lovely land before her , and the white walls and the towers of the great city , whereas Greenford was but small beside it . So they rode down into the frank , and entered the gates of the city a little after noon , and again was Birdalone in all amaze at the going to and fro in the streets and the thronging of the markets , and the divers folk , as chapmen and men - at - arms , and craftsmen and lords , who used the said city ; and to say sooth , somewhat her heart sank within her , and it seemed to her that it would be hard and troublous to have to deal with so much folk , and that they must needs go past her on the right hand and the left without heeding her life . Howsoever , Gerard , who knew the city , brought her to a fair hostel , where she was well lodged , she and her men . Straightway , then , before she went out into the streets again , she fell to getting together what she had of fine broidered work and of fair script , and to finishing what she had unfinished . And she sent forth Gerard and his sons to find out where was the market for such goods , and if she would have leave to sell the same therein , or anywhere in the town ; and Gerard found the hall of the embroiderers , and therein the master of the craft , and he received the carle courteously when he heard that there was fine work come to town , and did him to wit that none in any such craft might have freedom of the market save by leave of the guild of the craft ; but , said he , the guilds were open - handed and courteous , and were nowise wo nt to refuse the said leave , were the work good and true ; and he bade Gerard withal tell his mistress that she were best to bring samplings of her work to the Guildhall so soon as she might . So the very next day went Birdalone thither , and found the master a well - looked tall man of some five - and - forty winters , who looked on her from the first as if he deemed it were no ill way of wearing the time . To this man she showed her work , and though he found it not easy to take his eyes off Birdalone herself , yet when he looked at her handiwork , he found it better than very good , and he said to her : Damsel , here is what will be sought for at a great price by the great lords and ladies of the land , and the rich burgesses , and especially by the high prelates ; and so much of it as thou hast a mind to do is so much coined gold unto thee ; and now I see thee what thou art , I were fain that thou gathered good to thee . But as diligent as thou mayst be , thou hast but one pair of hands , wonderful soothly , and yet but one pair . He broke off at that word , for he was verily staring at her hands , and longing to see more of her arms than the wrists only , so that he scarce knew what he was saying . Then he turned red and said : Soothly I wot that no other hands save thine may do such needlework , or make the draughts for them . But thou wilt need women - servants to help thee , both in dighting the house for thee ( for this big old carle here will be scarce meet thereto ) and as apprentices to help thee about the work itself ; and if thou wilt , I shall seek the best ones out for thee . Moreover I must tell thee , that though I know for sure how that no woman in the world may work such needlework as thine , yet whiles there cometh hither a woman of middle age , a woman worn by troubles , pious , meek , and kind ; and by St. Lucia ! now I look on thee again , she might be somewhat like unto thee , were she young and fresh - looking and strong as thou art . Now this woman I say , and thereat I marvel , doeth needlework that is somewhat after the manner of thine , and which seemed to us excellent till I had seen thine . Good livelihood she earneth thereby , and is diligent therein ; but she hath no heart to get apprentices , or be made one of our guild , both of which were lawful to her as to thee , lovely damsel . But now I shall counsel her to be made of our guild along with thee , if thou wilt have it so , and then may ye both have three apprentices each , and may make in our city a goodly school , so that our guild shall be glorified thereby , for there will be none such work in the world . How sayest thou ? She thanked him much , and yeasaid him , and thought in her heart that such work which would keep her hands and her head both busy , would solace the grief of her heart , and wear away the time , that she might live till hope might peradventure arise in her . Then said the master : There is one thing else , that is , thy dwelling - place ; and if thou wilt I shall hire thee a house in the street of the Broiderers , a goodly one : sooth to say , that same is mine own , so thou mayst deem that I tell thee hereof to mine own gain ; and that may be ( and he reddened therewith ) ; but there is this in it , that if thou lackest money I shall let thee live therein without price till thou shalt have earned more than enough to pay me . Birdalone thanked him well , but she did him to wit that she was nowise penniless ; and presently she departed well pleased , though she deemed that the said master was well - nigh more friendly than might be looked for . And the next day he came to her in the hostelry , and without more ado brought her to the house in the street of the Broiderers , and she found it fair and well plenished , and so she fell to work to get all things ready . Now the next week was the day appointed when she should be received into the broiderers ’
120509	122290	120502	120502	Birdalone	108	’ sake , while the witch was unto her neither fearful nor irksome , and forsooth nought save a mouthpiece for words that both grieved Birdalone and yet were an eager pleasure unto her . But in the midst thereof , and ere the dream had time to change , Birdalone awoke , and it was an early morning of later spring , and the sky was clear blue and the sun shining bright , and the birds singing in the garden of the house , and in the street was the sound of the early market - folk passing through the street with their wares ; and all was fresh and lovely . She awoke sobbing , and the pillow was wet with her tears , and yet she felt as if something strange and joyous were going to betide her , and for joy of the love of life the heart beat fast in her bosom . She arose all darling naked as she was , and went to the window and looked out on the beauty of the spring , while the sound of the market - wains brought to her mind the thought of the meads , and the streams of the river , and the woodsides beyond the city ; and she fell a - longing for them , as a while she knelt on the window - seat , half dreaming and asleep again , till the sun came round that way , and its beams fell upon her bosom and her arms ; and she stood up and looked on the fairness of her body , and a great desire took hold of her heart that it might be loved as it deserved by him whom she desired . And thus she stood there till she became ashamed , and hastened to do on her raiment ; but even as she was about it , it came upon her that what she had will to do was to seek to the Castle of the Quest , and find out where was her love if there he were not , and so to seek him the world over till she found him . And such a flood of joy possessed her when she thought this , and so eager to begone she was , that she deemed every minute wasted till she were on the road . Nevertheless , in a while , when her mind was steadied , she knew that she had somewhat to do ere she might be gone , and that here , as oft , it would be more haste less speed . So she abode a little , and then came into her hall duly dight , and found Gerard and his sons there to serve her ; and she brake her fast , and bade them sit by her at table , as oft she did ; and she spake to them of this and that , and Gerard answered lightly again ; but the two Gerardsons looked at one another , as though they would speak and ask a question from time to time , but forbore because they durst not . But Gerard looked on them , and deemed he wotted what was in their minds ; so at last he spake : Our lady , both I , and meseemeth my sons also , deem that there is some tidings toward which are great unto thee ; for thine eyes sparkle , and the red burns in thy cheeks , and thine hands may not be quiet , nor thy feet abide in one place ; wherefore I see that thou hast something in thy mind which strives to be forth of it . Now thou wilt pardon us , our dear lady , that we ask concerning this , because it is in our love for thee that we speak , lest there be some change toward which shall be a grief to some of us . My men , said Birdalone , flushing red , sooth it is that there is a change at hand , and I shall tell you straightway what it is . Years ago I told you that I was fleeing from my friends ; now the change hath betid that I would seek them again ; and needs must I leave the Five Crafts behind to do so . And moreover there is this ill word to be said , which I will say at once , to wit , that when I am but a little way gone from the Five Crafts I must wend the other deal of my journey birdalone , as my name is . All those three sat silent and aghast at that word , and the young men grew pale ; but after a while spake Gerard : Our lady most well - beloved , this word which thou hast spoken , to wit , that thou needest us no longer , I have looked to hear any time this five years ; and praise be to the saints that it hath come late and not soon . Now there is no more to be said but that thou tell us what is thy will that we should do . Birdalone hung her head awhile for sorrow of sundering from these men ; then she looked up and said : It seemeth , my friends , as if ye deem I have done you a wrong in sundering our fellowship ; but all I may say hereon is to pray you to pardon me , that I needs must go alone on my quest . And now what I would have you do , is first of all to fetch hither a notary and scrivener , that he may draw up a deed of gift to you , Gerard and Gerardsons , of this house and all that is therein , saving what money I may need for my journey , and gifts such as I shall bid you to be given to my workwomen . Ye must needs yeasay this , or ye are forsworn of your behest to do my will . But furthermore , I will have you to let the workwomen of mine ( and the head one ruling ) to hire the aforesaid house , if so they will ; for now are they skilled , and may well earn good livelihood by the work . But the next work is simple ; it is to furnish for me the array of a young man , with such armour as I may easily bear , to dight me for my road . Forsooth ye wot that not unseldom do women use the custom of going arrayed like men , when they would journey with hidden head ; and ye may happen upon such gear as hath been made for such a woman rather than any man ; but thou shalt get me also a short bow and a quiver of arrows , for verily these be my proper weapons that I can deal with deftly . Now my last command is that , when all is done , maybe tomorrow , or maybe the next day , ye bring me out of the city and the frank of the Five Crafts , and bring me somewhat on my way over the downs , for loth am I to part from you ere needs must . Then they knelt before her and kissed her hands , and they were full of grief ; but they saw that so it had to be . Thereafter Gerard spake with his sons apart , and in a while came to Birdalone , and said : Our lady , we will do your will in all wise ; but we shall tell thee , that the Five Crafts will look but strange to us when thou art gone , and that we have a mind to betake us to Utterhay and the land of our kindred . Wherefore we pray thee to give this house that hath been so dear to us unto thy workwoman and her mates ; for we need it not , nor the hire thereof , but shall do well enough with what money or good thou mayst give us . Is this according to thy will , or have I spoken rashly ? She said : Ye are good and ungreedy , and I bless you for it ; be it as ye will ; and this the more , as I were fain that ye go to Utterhay ; for whiles I have deemed that I myself am drawn thitherward , wherefore it may be that we shall meet again in that place . And when she had so spoken , she might not refrain her tears ; and the Gerardsons turned away , for they were ashamed , both that they should see her weep , or she them . But at last she called to them and said : Now make we the speediest end we may of this , for sorry work is the tarrying of farewell ; so I pray you , my friends , to go about the work I have bidden you . So all was done as she would , and the day after the morrow was Birdalone abiding the coming of Gerard and his sons with the horses ; and despite of the sundering of friends and the perils that belike lay before her , the world seemed fair to her , and life beginning anew . And she made no doubt that she would soon be at the Castle of the Quest , and there find all things much as she had left them ; and there at least would be the welcome of her dear friend Viridis . Chapter VI ~ Of the Sundering of Birdalone from Gerard and His Sons Presently were the horses come with Gerard and his sons , and Birdalone gat to horse amongst them . She was armed in a light hauberk , and over it a long and loose surcoat that came down beneath the knee of her ; and a sallet she had upon her head , wide but light , so that not very much of her face was to be seen . She had made up her mind to this tale upon the road , when she was among folk , that she was under a vow not to do off her helm for a seven days ’
126044	128649	126025	126027	the Black Squire	1325	’ ride hence , and the land is goodly and peaceable , and if they be not dead , most like they be there yet . How sayest thou then , thou dearest and kindest , wilt thou thither to them ? For if so , I may well lead thee thither . Birdalone shook her head . Nay , she said , I deem that I am drawn elsewhither , but soon I shall tell thee . Lo now the gate . But ere we enter , tell me of Sir Geoffrey of Lea , and why it was that they might not abide the uncouth things , or if there were any such . Spake Leonard : Things uncouth there were , and I was called upon to lay them , and I did as biddeth Holy Church in all wise , but prevailed not against them , and still were they seen and heard , till folk might endure it no longer . And what like were these things ? said Birdalone , and are they yet seen and heard ? Said Leonard : Strange it is , but last night I went into the great hall where they mostly betid , and laid me down there , as whiles I do , for I fear them not , and would see if they yet appear ; but all night came nothing at all . As to the likeness of them . . . Then he stopped , but said presently : Hard it is to tell thee of them , but needs must I. There be two of these things ; and one is an image of a tall woman of middle - age , red - haired , white - skinned , and meagre , and whiles she has a twiggen rod in her hand , and whiles a naked short sword , and whiles nought at all . But the voice of her is cursing and blaspheming and ill - saying . Said Birdalone : This is then a fetch of my witch - mistress of whom I told thee erst , and the image of her ; what is the other ? Said Leonard : I were fain not to tell thee . Yet needs must thou , said Birdalone . Dear lady , said Leonard , the other is an image of thee , and even most like unto thee ; but whiles clad in a scanty grey coat and barefoot , and whiles clad in a fair green gown goodly broidered , and broidered shoon ; and whiles all mother - naked . And what voice cometh from mine image ? said Birdalone , smiling , yet somewhat pale withal . Said Leonard : One while a voice of sweet singing , as of a bird in the brake , and that is when thou art clad ; and again , when thou art naked , a voice of shrieking and wailing , as of one enduring torments . Spake Birdalone : And when did these wonders begin ? Said he : Not till after Sir Hugh and thy she - friends were gone hence . Pondered Birdalone a little ; then she said : I see herein the malice of my witch - mistress ; she would not send these fetches while Hugh was here , lest he should turn to seeking me with all his might . But when they departed , she would have the castle waste , and then she sent them , wotting that thereby she would rid her of Sir Geoffrey of Lea ; while , on the other hand , I was nought so much unto him that he would spend all his life seeking me . But now I deem I know so much of her that I may bid thee to look on her as dead if these fetches come not again within a little while . Then mayst thou send and do Sir Geoffrey to wit thereof , and belike he will come back again ; and fain were I thereof for it will be merrier if the Castle of the Quest be dwelt in once more . Yea , verily , said Leonard ; but far merrier yet wert thou to dwell there . Nay , she said , but now I see that it is not fated for me . Let us go in , for I would get to what I would do . So therewith they passed under the shadow of the archway , and Birdalone stayed not but went straightway into the hall , and through it ; and the priest , who lagged somewhat behind her speedy feet , cried out unto her : Whither wilt thou ? what chamber wilt thou visit first ? But she stayed not , and spake to him over her shoulder as she went : Follow me if thou wilt ; I have but one place only to come to ere I leave the Castle of the Quest , save I must needs turn back on my footsteps . Then Leonard came up with her , and she went her ways out of the hall , and out on to the waterswale of the castle , and so to the little haven of the water - gate . There Birdalone looked about her eagerly ; then she turned to Leonard and pointed with her finger and said : Lo thou ! there yet lieth my ferry of old time , the Sending Boat ; now wot I wherefore I was drawn hither . And her eyes glittered and her body quivered as she spake . Yea forsooth , said Leonard , there it lieth ; who of all folk in the castle had durst to touch it ? But what hath it to do with thee , O kindest lady ? Friend , she said , if this day weareth , and I am yet within these walls , then meseemeth there must I abide for evermore ; and there perchance shall I meet that seeming of myself , maybe for this night , maybe for ever , till I die here in this castle void of all that I love , and I over - young for it , friend . And I know now that there is hope within me ; for I bethink me of a dear friend over yonder water of whom I have never told any , nor will tell thee now , save this , that she is the wisdom of my life . Wherefore now I will try this ferry and wot if the wight thereof will yet obey the voice of the speaker of the spell , who has shed of her blood to pay therefor . Put not forth a hand therefore nor speak a word to let me , but take this farewell of me , with my pity and such love as I may give thee , and let me go , and think kindly of me . Then she went up to him , and laid her hands upon his shoulders , and kissed him , and turned about without more ado and stepped into the boat ; then she sat down and stripped her arm of its sleeve , and drew forth a knife and let blood of her arm , and then arose and smeared stem and stern therewith , and then sat down with her face to the stern and sang : The red raven - wine now Hast thou drunk , stern and bow ; Wake then and awake And the Northward way take : The way of the Wenders forth over the flood , For the will of the Senders is blent with the blood . Then she abode a little , while Leonard stood staring on her speechless with grief and blinded with his bitter tears , till the boat began to move under her , and presently glided out of the little haven into the wide lake ; then she turned her face back unto him and waved her hand , and he knelt down and blessed her , weeping . And so she vanished away from before him . Chapter IX ~ Birdalone Findeth the Isle of Nothing Greatly Bettered , and is Kindly Entreated There Now it was scarce noon when she departed , and the dark night came upon her in the midst of the water ; and she fell asleep in the boat ere the night had grown very old , and woke up in the morning , not exceeding early , maybe about six o’clock ; then she looked ahead and thought presently to see the ill - favoured blotch of the Isle of Nothing on the bosom of the blue waters , whereas it was a fair and cloudless morning of latter May. Sure enough she saw land ahead , and it lay low down on the water , but she deemed from the first that it was green of hue , and as she neared it she saw that it was verily as green as emerald . Thereat she was a little troubled , because she thought that mayhappen the Sending Boat had gone astray , and that if the wight thereof were not wending the old road , maybe he was not making for the old haven . For now indeed she told herself right out that her will was to go back again to the House under the Wood , and see what might betide there , and if she and the wood - mother together might not overcome the witch . But whatever might happen nought could she do but sit in her place and wend as the Sending Boat would ; and in an hour ’s space she was right under the lee of the land , and she saw that it was shapen even as the Isle of Nothing had been aforetime . But this made her wonder , that now the grass grew thick down to the lip of the water , and all about from the water up were many little slim trees , and some of them with the May - tide blossom yet on them , as though it were a fair and great orchard that she was nearing ; and moreover , beyond all that she saw the thatched roofs of houses rising up . Presently then the Sending Boat had brought her to the land , and she stepped ashore , but was wary , and gat her bow bent and set an arrow thereto she began to go up from the water . Yet she thought within herself , it will be nought ill if I be come amongst folk , so long as they be peaceful , or else how might I live the journey out to all the isles and so home to the House under the Wood ? So she turned her face to where she had seen those roofs , which now she saw no longer because of the thick leaves of the little trees , and so went along a narrow path , which grew to be more and more closely beset with trees , and were now no longer apple and pear and quince and medlar , but a young - grown thicket of woodland trees , as oak and hornbeam and beech and holly . At last as she went she heard voices before her , so she stole warily to the edge of the copse , finger on shaft ; and presently could see clear of the saplings and out on to a wide space of greensward , beyond which was a homestead of many houses and bowers , like unto that of a good yeoman in peaceful lands , save that the main building was longer , though it were low . But amidst the said greensward was a goodly flock of sheep that had been but of late washed for the shearing , and along with the sheep four folk , two carles and two queans , all of them in their first youth , not one by seeming of over a score and two of summers . These folk were clad but simply , man and woman , in short coats of white woollen ( but the women ’s coats a little longer than the men ’s ) , without shoon or hosen ; they had garlands of green leaves on their heads , and were wholly unarmed , save that one of the men bore an ashen wand in his hand . As for their bodies , they were goodly of fashion , tanned indeed by the sun ’s burning , but all sweet of flesh were they , shapely and trim , clean - made , and light and slim . Birdalone ’s heart yearned toward them , and she stepped straightway from out of the cover of the coppice , and the sun flamed from her sallet and glittered in the rings of her hauberk , so that the folk might not fail to see her ; the sheep fled bundling from her past their keepers , who stood firm , but seemed somewhat scared , and moved not toward Birdalone . She gave them the sele of the day and stood still herself ; but the man with the ash - wand said : Hail , thou man ; but we would have thee come no nearer a while , though thy voice be sweet : for we know what things they be which thou bearest , and that thou art a warrior . Wilt thou hurt us ? Birdalone laughed as sweetly as the blackbird sings , and she did off her sallet and shook the plenteous hair down over her , and then drew forth her sword and dagger and cast them to earth , and laid her bow and quiver of arrows upon them , and said : Now will I come to you , or ye shall come to me , whereas I am unweaponed , and no warrior , but a woman , and ye are four to one , and two of you carles ; wherefore now ye may bind me or slay me if you will ; but in any case I pray you first to give me a mouthful of meat . When she had done her speech , she went up to the fairest of the women and kissed her ; but the two carles made no more ado but came to Birdalone and kissed her one after other , and that as men who needed nought to compel them therein , and each thereafter took a hand of her and held it and caressed it . But the other woman had run into the house as soon as Birdalone spoke , and came back again with a treen bowl full of milk and a little loaf , not white but brown ; and there blundered about her legs as she came a little lad of some three winters old , naked and brown , who was shy of the gleaming new - comer , and hid him behind the woman one while , and the other while came forth to see the new thing . But the woman said : Dear woman , here is for thee some of the ewes ’
128692	129068	129081	129081	me	0	’ milk , and we be now at point to go milk them . Birdalone thanked her with a heart full of content , and was not ill - pleased to get her hands free from the two carles ; so she sat down and ate her breakfast while they talked with her , and told her of diverse work of theirs ; as to how their trees were waxing , and new tillage they had done the past spring , and how it befell to the kine and the goats ; of their children also they spake , and how there were already four thereof , and one of the women , the meat - bringer , already quickened with child once more . So that ere we die , quoth the carle who was speaking , we look to see many grandchildren , and shall have some stout carles and queans here . And by that time will some of the trees be well grown , so that we may fell timber and make us some keel that will wend the lake , and help us a - fishing ; or we may go to other lands ; or whiles folk may come to us , even as thou hast , thou dear - handed , sweet - voiced woman . But wilt thou abide here ever ? Yea , said the other , but that is looking forward a long while , that building of ships . What is nearer and well to think of is , that these apple and pear trees be so well fruited , small as they be , that this harvest we shall be able to make us cider and perry ; yea , and no little deal thereof . But art thou minded to abide with us ever ? That were dear to us ; and belike thou wouldest bear us children , thou also . Then spake the meat - fetching woman and laughed withal : Nay , thou also lookest aloof a pretty deal ; whereas what is now to do is to go milk the kine , and to take this guest with us , so that she may drink somewhat better than ewes ’
129231	139823	129225	129225	Birdalone	108	’ milk , and then went and lay down under the shade of the little young trees , and talked and were merry together . But the men were both of them somewhat willing at first to kiss Birdalone and toy with her , but when she let them know that she desired it not they refrained them without grudging . All this while of their talk they asked Birdalone nought of whence and whither , and she would not ask them , lest it might stir their asking , and then she would have to tell them some deal of her story ; and telling it was now become unto her somewhat weary work . In a while they arose all , and the men and one woman went their ways to deal with the acre - land , but the meat - fetcher went back with Birdalone into the house ; and she showed her all that was therein , which was for the more part , forsooth , the four babes aforesaid . The others came back in the eventide , bearing with them foison of blue hare - bells , and telling joyously how they had found them anigh the coppice edge in such a place : and thereafter they were merry , and sang and talked the evening away , and showed Birdalone at last to a fair little chamber wherein was a bed of dry grass , where she lay down and slept in all content . Chapter X ~ Of Birdalone ’s Flitting from the Isle of Nothing On the morrow Birdalone arose betimes , and would not tarry despite all the kindness of that folk and the change which had come over the Isle of Nothing ; so the friends saw her down to the boat all together , and bore down with them a deal of bread and cheese and late apples of the last year , for her provision on the road , and a pail of milk withal ; and men and women they kissed her at departure , and the meat - fetcher said : If by any means thou mayst find a keel which will carry thee hither , at some time , I would thou wouldst come ; for even if thou be old , and we passed away , yet here shall be our children or our grandchildren to welcome thee ; and we will tell them the tale of thee that they remember it and long for thee . Then Birdalone kissed her again , and made much of her , and so stepped into the boat , and fell to her sacrifice to the wight thereof ; and those others stared at her and wondered , and spake nought unto her till she was gone gliding over the face of the waters ; but as they walked back to the house , they spake amongst themselves that this must be some goddess ( for of Holy Church they knew nought ) who had come to visit them in her loveliness ; and in after times , when this folk waxed a many , and tilled all the isle and made ships and spread to other lands and became great , they yet had a memory of Birdalone as their own very lady and goddess , who had come from the fertile and wise lands to bless them , when first they began to engender on that isle , and had broken bread with them , and slept under their roof , and then departed in a wonderful fashion , as might be looked for of a goddess . But as for Birdalone , she came not back ever , nor saw that folk again , and now she sped over the water toward the Isle of Kings . Chapter XI ~ Coming to the Isle of Kings Birdalone Findeth There A Score and Two of Fair Damsels Who Would Fain Have Her Company Birdalone came ashore at the said isle at the day - dawn , and saw but little change in the isle when it grew light , and still the castle stood looking down awfully on to the meadows . But when she had set foot on the land , she handled her bow lest the worst might befall , and looked about her , deeming that this time she would not go her ways to the dread show that was arrayed in the castle , if forsooth those dead folk yet abode there . So now as she looked across the meadow , she saw one with light and fluttering raiment come forth from the trees , and look toward her whereas she stood flashing and gleaming in the sun like an image of the God of Love turned warrior . Now Birdalone deemed for sure that this was a woman ; she saw her come a little nigher to her , and then stand looking at her under the sharp of her hand ; then she turned about and ran back to the brake whence she came ; and presently Birdalone heard the sound of voices coming thence , and in a little while thereafter came forth from the said brake a rout of women ( one score and two as they were told thereafter ) and walked over the meadow straight unto her . She stood where she was , so as to be nigh unto her ferry in case they willed her unpeace ; for though they were weaponless by seeming , they were a many . When they were come near they stood about her in a half ring , whispering and laughing each to each . Birdalone saw that they were all young , and that none of them might be called ungoodly , and some were full fair . They were bright and fine of array . Most bore gold and gems on fingers and neck and arms ; they were clad in light , or it may be said wanton raiment of diverse colours , which had only this of their fashion in common , that they none of them hid over - much of their bare bodies ; for either the silk slipped from the shoulder of her , or danced away from her flank ; and she whose feet were shod , spared not to show knee and some deal of thigh ; and she whose gown reached unsheared from neck to heel , wore it of a web so thin and fine that it hid but little betwixt heel and neck . Birdalone stood gazing on them and wondering , and she had a mind to think that they were some show sent by her old mistress the witch for her undoing , and she loosened her sword in its sheath and nocked an arrow . But then ran forward two of the damsels and knelt before her , and each took an hand of her and fell to kissing it , and she felt their hands that they were firm and their lips that they were soft and warm , and they were doubtless alive and real . Then spake one of them and said : Hail our lord ! How can words say how we rejoice in thy coming this happy morn ! Now do all we give ourselves to thee as thy slaves to do as thou wilt with . Yet we pray thee be merciful to us and our longings . Therewith all the sort of them knelt down on the grass before Birdalone and joined their hands as praying to her . And Birdalone was full ill at ease , and wotted not where she was . But she said : Hail ! and good days and fulfilment of wishes unto you , fair damsels ! But tell me , is this the Isle of Kings , as I deemed ; for strange it is for me to see ye womenfolk here ? Said she who had spoken afore : Yea verily this is the Isle of Kings ; but long ago are the kings dead , and yet they sit dead in the great hall of the castle yonder , as thou mayst see if thou , who art a man and a valiant warrior , durst follow up yon mountain path thereto ; but we , weak women and little - hearted , durst not go anigh it ; and we tremble when whiles a - nights cometh down thence the sound of clashing swords and clattering shields , and the cries of men in battle . But , praise be to the God of Love , nought cometh down from thence unto us . Therefore do we live peaceful lives and pleasant here , lacking nought but thee , lord ; and lo now thou hast come unto us , and we are happy in our inmost hearts . Now was Birdalone perplexed and knew not what to do ; but at last she said : Gentle maidens , I pray you pardon me , but I must depart straightway ; for I have an errand , and life or death lieth on it . In all else than my abiding here may ye have your will . Therewith did she move a little way toward her ferry ; but forthwith all they brake out weeping and wailing and lamenting , and some of them came up to Birdalone and cast themselves down before her , and clasped her knees , and took hold of her skirts , and besought her piteously to abide with them . But she put them aside as well as she might , and stepped aboard the Sending Boat , and stood amidst it waiting on their departure ; but they went not , and stood along on the lip of the land crying out and beseeching with much clamour . Then Birdalone waxed somewhat wrath at their noise and tumult , and she drew forth her knife and bared her arm and let blood from it . But when they saw the whiteness and roundness of it , and how fine and sleek it was , straightway they changed their tune , and cried out : A woman , a woman , a fool of a woman ! and they laughed in scorn and mockery . And the speaker of them said : Now there is but one thing for thee to do , and that is to come forth from thy boat and strip off thy stolen raiment , and we shall make thee as fine as ourselves , and thou shalt come with us , and with us abide the coming of our lord . Nay , thou art so fair and lovely , that thou shalt be the Lady and Queen of us , and we will do after thy commands , and thou mayst chastise us if we fail therein . But now if thou wilt not come forth of the boat uncompelled , we shall pluck thee forth of it . And therewith she set her foot on the gunwale of the boat , and two or three others did the like . But now had Birdalone her sword naked in her hand , and she waxed as red as blood , and cried out : Forbear I bid you ! Yea verily I am a woman ; but I will not take this offer either , whereas I have an errand , as I told you . And so stern it is , that if ye now let my departure I will not spare to smite with this sword whoso first cometh aboard my ferry , and though I be not a man , yet shall ye find that in this matter I shall be little worse , whereas I am armed and ye be naked . Then they drew back and stood gibing and jeering at her ; but she heeded it no whit , but reddened stem and stern of the Sending Boat , and sang her spell , and forth glided the ferry , while the damsels stood and stared astonished . As for Birdalone , as she sped on her way she might not refrain her laughter . Thus she wended the wet highway . Chapter XII ~ Birdalone Cometh Again to the Isle of Queens , and Findeth A Perilous Adventure Therein It was not yet daybreak when Birdalone came ashore again , and the moon was down , and it was dark ; wherefore she durst not go up on the land , but lay down in the ferry and fell asleep there . When she woke again it was broad daylight , the sun was up , and a little ripple was running over the face of the water . She stepped ashore straightway , and looked up the land and to the right hand and the left , and saw at once that it was indeed the Isle of Queens , and the house stood trim and lovely as of old time ; then she longed somewhat to tread the green meadow a little , for yet young was the day , and she saw nought stirring save the throstle and a few small beasts . However , she said to herself that she would go nowhere nigh to the goodly house wherein abode those images of death . Yet her body longed so sore for the springtide freshness of the grass , and was so bewooed of the flowery scent thereof , that though she durst not go unarmed , she did off her footgear and went stealing softly barefoot and with naked legs over the embroidered greensward , saying aloud to herself : If run for the ferry I needs must , lighter shall I run so dight . Nonetheless , she had gone but a little way ere a terror took hold of her , though she saw no child of Adam anigh , and she turned and ran back swiftly to her old place and sat down under a twisted oak - tree hard by the Sending Boat , and abode there panting and quaking , and scarce daring to look up from the grass for a while . Then her heart came back to her , and she laughed , and said to herself : I am a fool , for I need fear nought on this Isle of Queens save women like myself . Yet she sat there a little while longer without stirring ; then she stood up and looked keenly around , and , as aforesaid , exceeding far - sighted she was ; but still she saw neither man nor maid nor suckling child . Then her eyes sought the lips of the lake , and rested on a little bight some stone ’s throw ahead of the Sending Boat , where , a little back from the water , slim willows made a veil betwixt the water of the meadow ; and she looked , and saw how pleasant a place it were for a one to stand and look on the ripple just left , while the water dripped from the clear body on to the grass . And her bare feet fell to telling her clad sides of the sweet coolness of the water , and waited for no naysay , but lightly bore her toward the willowy bight . And when she was there , she did off her sallet and ungirt her , and laid her sword on the grass , and did off her surcoat and hauberk , and so was a woman again in one white coat above her smock . Then she looked heedfully betwixt the willow - boughs , and saw no more than before , nought but a little whitethorn brake , now white indeed with blossom , some fifty yards landward from where she stood . So she laughed , and did off her other raiment , and slid swiftly into the water , that embraced her body in all its fresh kindness ; and as for Birdalone , she rewarded it well for its past toil by sporting and swimming to her full . Then she came forth from the water , and clad herself in no great haste , and did on her hauberk and sallet and sword , and so went back to her place , and sat down and began to do on her foot - gear . But as she looked up from her work a moment , lo ! a tall man coming toward her , and just about the willows whereby she had bathed . Her heart beat quick and her face changed , yet she hastened , and was shod and stood up in knightly array by then he stayed his steps some five paces from her , and gave her the sele of the day in courteous wise ; and she strove to think that he had not seen her , or at least noted her otherwise dight ; yet her heart misgave her . He was a grizzled - haired man of over fifty summers by seeming , but goodly enough and well - knit ; he was clad in a green coat more than a little worn , but made after the fashion of knighthood ; he had nought on his head but an oak - chaplet , and no weapons but a short sword by his side and a stout staff in his hand . She gave back his greeting in a quavering voice ; and he said : Welcome again , young man . Art thou come to dwell with us ? Truly thou art trim now , but ere some few months thine attire will be not so much fairer than ours , and thine hauberk will be rusted , for here be no joyous tiltings nor deeds of arms , and no kind ladies to give the award of honour , so that if we fight amongst ourselves it will be because we have fallen out , and spitefully . Yet ( and he laughed , mockingly , as she thought ) thou mayst bring us luck , and draw some fair damsels unto us , for that is what we await in this isle , which is barren of their fair bodies , despite of its deceitful name . Thereat Birdalone reddened , deeming that he divined her womanhood , but she enforced her to speak hardily , and as manly as she might , and said : Yea , fair sir , and if I be the God of Love , as thou deemest , and not merely a poor squire ( Louis Delahaye , at thy service ) , how many damsels shall I send thee if there must needs be one to each man of you ? Quoth he : Thou must make up the tale to a score or more , or some of us must lack . Sooth to say , at this time thou needest not haste overmuch for all the tale , whereas there is but one other of the company near at hand , a mere foolish young man ; the others are gone to the leeward side of the isle , to fetch us venison and fish , both of which are more plenty there than here ; wherefore are we two somewhat lonesome in this stead , all the more as we be over - nigh to the sorcery in the great house , which we durst not enter ; for though nought cometh out thence down unto us , yet hear we a - night - tides , first songs , and then cries and shrieking , come out therefrom . Then he stayed his speech , and drew a little nigher to Birdalone , and then grinned , and said : Forsooth we can spare him , we twain . And he looked on her hard , and the colour came into her cheeks , and she laughed uneasily , as a dainty lady when she heareth some unmeet tale . But again the old carle drew nigher to her , and said : Thou seemest to have a good bow and store of arrows ; if thou wouldst lend them to me for a little , and come with me into the wood hard by , I might shoot thee some venison with little toil to thee ; whereas , forsooth , thou lookest scarce like one who is meet for over - much toil . Again she reddened , and spake nought this time ; and he said : Deem not there be no deer this end of the isle because I said that the others were gone to fetch home venison ; only the deer be tamer there and more , and we have but evil shooting - gear , whereas thou art well found therein . Wilt thou not come ? we shall have merry feast after the hunt . Now had Birdalone come to her wits again , and she answered like a merry youth , with a flavour of mockery in her speech : Fair sir , thou shalt not deem that I need much help in slaying the dun deer ; for I do thee to wit that I shoot not ill in the bow ; neither am I heavy - footed . But I will not hunt in your park today , for I have an errand which calleth me away , so that I shall depart hence presently . Besides , wise elder , there is thine errand to see to ; and if I be the God of Love , as thou sayest , I must not keep thee and thy valiant fellows languishing mateless ; so with thy leave I will now depart , that I may send you a score of fair damsels for your company . And she turned about and made a step toward her boat ; but the carle drew nearer , laughing ; and he said : Truly sayest thou that thou art not heavy - footed , for never saw I feet lighter or fairer than glided over the meadow e’en now ; nor a fairer body than came like rosy - tinted pearl fresh out of the water while I lay hidden in yonder thorn - brake that while . Wherefore trouble not thyself to bring any more damsels than thyself , fairest Goddess of Love , for thou art enough for me . And therewith he ran forward , and stretched out a hand to her ; but in that nick of time had she her sword naked in her hand , and the carle drew back before the glitter thereof , and cried out : Ho , ho ! is it to be battle , my mistress ? Deemest thou that thou wilt slay me as lightly as the dun deer , and thou with thy bow unstrung at thy back ? Now shall I show thee a trick of fence ; but fear not that I shall hurt thee to spoil thee . He advanced on her with his staff aloft , and her heart failed her , and she quaked , and lightly he beat down her guard and did the sword out of her hand ; and again he turned on her to take her , but she sprang aside and ran from him , but ran landward perforce , as he was betwixt her and the boat ; and he followed heavily , and had nought to do in the race . But she had not gone a two - score yards ere she heard a great shout , and another man came running over the meadow ; a slim young man was this , and worse of attire than the old carle , for so tattered was his raiment that he was half naked ; but he was goodly of fashion , fresh - coloured and black - haired . Birdalone stayed her feet when she saw him , for though she doubted not to outrun him , yet whither should she run , since her ferry was behind her ? So the young man came up to her , and the old carle met him all panting , and the young man said : How now , Antony ! what battle is this ? and wherefore art thou chasing this fair knight ? And thou , fair sir , why fleest thou this grey dastard ? Said Antony : Thou art but a young fool , Otter , this is no man , but a woman , and I have taken her , and she is mine . Well , said Otter , I say she is as much mine as thine ; nay , more , if she will give herself unto me . But if she will not , she shall go whither she will in thy despite . Or art thou a woman ? Yea , yea , said Birdalone ; and I pray thee , by thy mother ’s head , suffer me to depart ; for heavy and full of need is the errand that I am about . Go thou shalt then , said Otter ; lead back to thy place , and I will walk with thee . So did they : and Birdalone went beside the young man quaking ; but he put out no hand unto her ; and sooth to say , she deemed that she had seldom seen so fair a young man , but it were Arthur or Hugh . Now he , as Antony , was girt with a short sword , but he let it be in its sheath ; and as they went , Antony drew his blade again , and hove it up to smite Otter , but as it befell Birdalone saw him , and turned round sharp upon him and gat hold of his wrist , and therewith Otter turned also , and caught the old carle by the nape as he turned away , and put a foot before his and shoved mightily , so that he went noseling to the earth . Then turned Otter about again , laughing , and he said to Birdalone : By Saint Giles ! thou art well - nigh too valiant for a woman , and I would that we two might be together ; and then between us we might achieve the adventure of the dead ladies up yonder . She hung her head , and said : Fair sir , it may not anywise be ; yet I thank thee , I thank thee . So came they to the water - side and the Sending Boat , and Birdalone stayed her feet there , and the young man said : What is this keel , that seemeth unto me as if it were a ferry for malefactors wending to a death of torment , so grey and bleared and water - logged and sun - bleached as it is , and smeared over with stains of I know not what ? Said Birdalone : Such as it is , it is my ferry over the water to where I would be . Strange ! said Otter ; to my mind it is like to our fortunes on this isle , we who were once knights and merry squires and are now as gangrel men , and of ill conditions , thinking of nought save our first desires , even those which we share with the wolf and the kite . She said : But art thou of evil conditions , thou who hast just delivered me from trouble ? He smiled grimly : Damsel , said he , I have not delivered thee yet from me , though I have from him . But tell me , art thou a sorceress ? Not a black one , said Birdalone ; but I will tell thee at once that I have been bred by a witch most mighty , and some deal of lore have I learned . And therewith she told him of the Sending Boat , and how she would have to speed it on the way . He looked on her a little and then turned away , and saw her sword lying on the grass ; so he went to it and picked it up and brought it to her , and said : Thou mayst yet need this keen friend . So she took it and thrust it back into the scabbard , quaking somewhat because of him ; so feeble and frail as she felt before him . Then he said : If thou deemest thou hast somewhat to reward me for , I have a boon to ask of thee , and granting that , we shall be quits again . Yea , she said faintly , and what is the boon ? He said : Art thou pressed to depart now , this minute ? Nay , said Birdalone , not for an hour if there be no peril here from other men , and . . . and . . . And if I be true to thee and will let thee go ? said he , laughing ; hah ! is that not thy word ? fear not , I swear by thine eyes that thou shalt depart whenso thou wilt . Now then , the boon I crave is , that thou wilt sit down here beside me and tell me the tale of thy life that has been . Said she : It wearies me to think thereof ; yet hast thou a right to crave somewhat of me , and this is not hard to grant . And she sat down by him ; but he said : Do this also for me , take off thine headpiece , since now that we know thee for a woman it serveth thee nought . So did she , and began her tale straightway , and told him all thereof , save as to the wood - wife , and he sat hearkening and watching her face ; and when she had made an end , he said : Now shall I ask none other boon of thee , though I long sore for it ; but best it is that we sunder straightway , else maybe I might yet be for hindering thee . Therewith he stood up , and Birdalone also , and he looked on her eagerly , and said : I am now to bid thee farewell , and it is most like that I shall never see thee again , wherefore I will ask thee yet to let one thing come from thy mouth ; for I deem thee the dearest of all women I have ever seen . What shall I say ? said Birdalone , smiling on him kindly ; must thou needs put the word in my mouth ? Thou hast been friendly with me here when need was to me of friendliness ; wherefore I say , I would I might see thee again , and thou better bestead than now thou art . The young man ’s face brightened , and he said : Spake I not that thou wert the dearest of all ? This was even the word I would have put in thy mouth . But now see thou , one goeth on from one thing to another , and I must now ask thee , is there aught which thou hast a mind to give me ere I depart , some keepsake which I durst not ask for ? She flushed red and said : I will with a good heart give thee my bow and arrows for a keepsake ; whereas the old carle told me that ye be ill furnished of shooting - gear . And she would have taken her bow from her back , but he laughed aloud , and said : Nay , nay , I will not have that ; for there be those who gird them to a sword and know not how to use it , but few will cumber their shoulders with bow and quiver who can not shoot therewith ; I deem it like that thou art a fell bowman . Keep thy bow therefore , and if thou wilt go without any other gift , even so be it . And he made as if he would turn away ; but she put forth both her hands and took his in them , and lifted up her face and kissed him kindly , and then turned away to her ferry ; while Otter stood still and said in a merry voice : Now is it better than well , for thou art in all ways what I would have thee , and there is nought like unto thee . And therewith he turned away and departed ere Birdalone had stepped into the Sending Boat , and she blushing like a rose the while . Then she did due sacrifice to the wight of the witch - ferry , and sped on her way without any hindrance . Chapter XIII ~ Coming to the Isle of the Young and the Old , Birdalone Findeth It Peopled with Children Midst all this had worn some hours , but yet it was barely noon ; wherefore it was yet dark by then Birdalone made the Isle of the Young and the Old ; so she stepped out of the boat , and lay down on the grass and abode the dawn sleeping . And she awoke with the clatter of shrill voices , and she rose up and looked , and lo a multitude of children all about her , both men and women children , and , as it seemed , from five years old upward to fifteen . They cried and crowed merrily when they saw her stand up , and pressed on her to see her the nearer and to touch her hands or her raiment . They were but little clad , and the younger ones not at all , but were goodly younglings and merry . So great was the noise they raised , that loud were the thunder which had not been hushed thereby ; and Birdalone stood looking on them , smiling , and knew not what to do . Anon she turned to a tall thin lad of some fifteen winters , and said unto him : Wilt thou now take me unto the house , and the place where dwelleth the old man ? Quoth he : I neither know of an old man , nor rightly what it means , the word . Am not I old enough for thee ? I am the oldest of these here . But belike thou art hungry ; wherefore if thou come to the place where we sleep a - nights , and where we shelter us from the storm and the rain when need is , I will give thee to eat ; for we have both bread and milk and cheese , and raisins of the sun . So he took her hand and led her along , and asked her by the way concerning her armour and weapons , and of the fashion of battle , and she told him thereof what she would . Thus came they to the place where erst had been the cot under the ruin of the great ancient house ; but now was gone all that ruin and the great grey walls , though the cot was left ; and all about it were low bowers built of small wood and thatched undeftly . But the lad smiled when he saw it , as if the sight thereof made him happy ; and he said : All these have we made since I have dwelt here , and no other home have I known . And he led her into the cot , and set her down to eat and to drink , and through the open door she could see the children swarming , and they that were nighest thrusting each other this way and that to catch a sight of her . Now she said : Fair child , how gattest thou this victual if there be no older folk to help you ? Said he : We dig the ground and sow it , and the wheat comes up , and we reap it in harvest , and make bread of it ; and we have goats and kine , and we milk them , and turn the milk with a little blue flower , which is fair to see . And there are in this isle little hills where the grapes grow plenty ; and some we eat and some we dry for store . Lo thou , such be our ways for victual . But tell me , said he , thou sayest old , and I know not the word ; art thou old ? She laughed : Not very , said she , yet older than thou . Said the lad : Thou art fair and dear to look on , and thy voice is sweet ; wilt thou not abide with us , and teach us what it is to be old ? Nay , said she , I may not , for I have an errand which driveth me on ; wherefore I must be gone within this hour . Forsooth , she was growing eager now to be done with her journey and come to the House under the Wood , whatever should befall her there . Moreover she deemed it would not be restful to her to abide among all these restless children , with their ceaseless crying and yelping : if rest she might , she would rest , she deemed , in the Isle of Increase Unsought , if there were no ill things abiding there . Wherefore now she arose , when she had sat hearkening the sound of the lad ’s prattle for a while , for as to the sense thereof she might not heed it over - much . The youngling would not leave her , but led her , holding her hand , down to her ferry again ; she kissed him in thanks for his meat , and he reddened thereat but said nought . All the whole rout of little ones had followed her down to the water , and now they stood , as thick as bees on a honeycomb , on the bank , to watch her departure . But if they were keen to see her doings before , how much keener were they when it came to the baring of her arm and the smearing of the Sending Boat . To be short , so keen were they , and pushed and shoved each other so sturdily , that more than one or two fell into the water , and Birdalone was frighted lest they should drown ; but they swam like ducks , and got on to the land when they would , which was not so very soon , for some of them hung unto the gunwale of the boat , and hove their faces up to look over into it , and left not hold till the ferry was fairly under weigh and beginning to quicken its speed . So left Birdalone the isle , and nought befell her on the way to the Isle of Increase Unsought . Chapter XIV ~ The Sending Boat Disappeareth from the Isle of Increase Unsought , and Birdalone Seeketh to Escape Thence by Swimming It was as before that Birdalone came to the shore of the isle while it was yet night ; but the wizard keel was so loathsome to her , that she stepped out of it and laid her down on the land for what was left of the night ; yet hard she found her bed , and neither grassy nor flowery . For all that , she slept , for she was weary , and it was broad day and not very early when she awoke . She stood up trembling , for she foreboded evil , so near as she was to the dwelling of her old mistress ; and she looked up to where in time past was the fair and wicked house , and saw that all was changed indeed ; for no longer was the isle goodly with meadow and orchard and garden , but was waste and bare , and nought grew on it save thin and wiry grass , already seeding even ere June was born , and here and there hard and ugly herbs , with scarce aught that might be called a flower amongst them . Trees there were yet , but the most of them stark dead , and the best dying fast . No beasts she saw , nor fowl ; nothing but lizards and beetles , and now and again a dry grey adder coiled up about a sun - burned stone . But of great carrion flies , green and blue , were there a many , and whiles they buzzed about her head till she sickened with loathing of them . All this she found on her way as she went up toward the place where erst was the great perron . But when she came to the top there was no sign either of the stairs or the house , or aught that ever was builded ; there was nought but the bare bent top , ungrassed , parched by wind , scorched by sun , washed by rain . She wandered about the isle , to places where she had not been herself , but which she deemed she might have known by the telling of the Green Knight ’s tale , had there been no change since those days ; but now was all changed , and the whole isle was a mere waste , and withal poisonous of aspect to her mind , as if many corpses lay underneath the wretched stones of it . Nevertheless , though it seemed so evil unto Birdalone , she lingered on it , wandering about till she was to - wearied , for she had no will to depart at such time as she would be like to come to her old abiding - place by night and cloud ; wherefore she dallied with the time , and came not back to the haven of her ferry till it was nigh sunset , and the westering sun was in her eyes when she came there ; and she said to herself that this was the cause why she might not see the Sending Boat . So she cleared her eyes and looked on the thin grass awhile , and then down over the edge of the land , and still she saw not her boat . She turned pale , and a pang of anguish went to her heart ; but she walked a little east , deeming that perchance she had erred as to the place of the haven on that dull and empty shore ; but yet there was no boat . Then she turned back wild with terror , and sought where erst she had missed it , and found neither boat nor the world ’s end . And she deemed that there might be some devilish malice of the wight of the Sending Boat , to torment her with fear , and she walked along the land ’s edge up and down , and down and up , further each time , and still there was no boat . Then she stood still and strove to think , and might not , nor might she do aught , but spread abroad her hands and moaned in her agony ; for now indeed she felt herself in the trap ; and she said that all her past life of hope and desire and love and honour was all for nought , and that she was but born to die miserably in that foul ruin of an isle envenomed with the memories of bygone cruelty and shame . But in a little while she came somewhat to herself , and she said : At least this hideous land shall not mock my dying anguish ; I will give myself to the water and let it do with me as it will . Therewith she cast off her helm and hauberk first , and her weapons , and her pouch with the treasure that could buy nought for her now , and thereafter all her raiment , till she was as naked as when she first came aland there that other time . Again she moaned , and put up her hand to her bosom and felt a little gold box lying there betwixt the fragrant hills of her breasts , which hung to a thin golden thread about her neck ; and a thought came into her mind , and she stooped adown and drew from her pouch flint and fire - steel , and then opened the said golden box and drew thence the tress which Habundia the wood - wife had given to her those years agone , and all trembling she drew two hairs from it , as erst she did on the Isle of Nothing , and struck fire and kindled tinder and burnt the said hairs , and then hung the golden box with the tress therein about her neck again ; and she said : O wood - mother , if only thou couldst know of me and see me , thou wouldst help me ! Thereafter she sought along the bank for bread which she had taken from her store that morning , and she found it , and compelled herself to eat of it for the strengthening of her body , and then she stood and abode tidings ; and by then the sun had just sunk below the rim of the lake , and the stars began to twinkle , for the night was cloudless , and exceeding fair , and very warm . No visible token came to her , but her heart grew stronger , and she seemed to see herself yet alive and in hope on the other side of the water ; and she said : Who wotteth what Weird may do , or where the waters may bear me ? and there is no swimmer stronger than I. So then without more ado Birdalone slipped into the water , which lay before her as calm and plain as a great sheet of glass , and fell to rowing with her arms and her legs as though she were but swimming from Green Eyot to the mainland , as so oft she had done in the other days . Chapter XV ~ Birdalone Lacketh Little of Drowning , But Cometh Latterly to the Green Eyot On swam Birdalone , not as one who had a mind to drown her for the forgetting of troubles , but both strongly and wisely ; and she turned over on to her back , and looked on the stars above her , and steered herself by them thitherward whereas she deemed was the land under the wood . When she had been gone from the evil isle for an hour or so , there rose a fair little wind behind her , which helped her forward , but scarce raised the water more than a little ripple . Still she swam on , and it was some three hours she began to weary , and then she floated on her back and let the wind and water have its way with her ; and now the night was as dark as it would be ere dawn . Thus it went for another hour , that whiles she swam on and whiles she floated ; and now her heart began to fail her , and the great water was no longer unto her a wet highway , but a terrible gulf over which she hung fainting . Nevertheless she did not give up doing what she might : she floated supine a long while , and then , when she had gathered a little strength , turned over again and struck out , still steering her by the stars . But she had scarce made three strokes ere her arms met something hard and rough ; and at first in her forlornness she deemed she had happened on some dread water monster , and for terror of it she sank down into the deep , but came up presently blinded and breathless , and spread abroad her arms , and again they came on the thing aforesaid , and this time found that it was nought alive , but the bole of a tree sitting high out of the water . So she clomb up on to it with what might she had left , and sat her down , and saw in the dim light that it was big , and that there was a fork betwixt two limbs reaching up into the air , and she thrust herself in between these two limbs and embraced one of them , so that she might scarce tumble off ; and a great content and happiness came over her that she had thus escaped from the death of the deep ; but therewithal weariness overcame her , and she slept , whether she would or not ; and the bole went on over the waters no slower than might have been looked for , whether it were by the pushing on of the south wind , or by the hand of Weird that would not have her die . Long she slumbered , for when she awoke it was broad day and the sun was shining high in the heavens , and she cleared her eyes and looked around , and saw before her the land , but yet blue in the offing . And the tree - bole was yet speeding on towards the shore , as if it were being drawn there by some bidding of might . Now indeed grew Birdalone happy , and she thought if any had helped her it must have been the wood - mother once again ; and she said to herself that she should soon meet with that helper ; nor heeded she that she was naked and unfurnished of any goods , whereas she deemed indeed that it was but to ask and have of her friend . For a while indeed she knew not whither she was wending , and if her face were verily turned toward the land under the wood ; but as the morning wore the blue distance began to grow green , and then she saw that a great wood was indeed before her , and thereafter , as it cleared yet more , she knew the land she was nearing for the meadows of the House under the Wood , and it was not long thence ere she saw clear and close Green Eyot and Rocky Eyot , though the house was yet hidden from her by the green shores of the first of those two isles . Shortly to tell it , her tree - bole floated with her past the outer ness of Green Eyot , and came ashore in that same sandy bight where erst she was wonted to make her body ready for the water . She stepped ashore all glad to feel the firm warm sand underneath her foot - soles , and as one drunk with joy she was when the tall flowery grass of the latter May was caressing her legs as they shook the seed - dust off the bents , and smote the fragrance out of the blossoms ; and she might scarce at first lift her eyes from their familiar loveliness . Glad she was indeed , but exceeding worn and weary with the long voyage , and all the longing and fear and hope which had encompassed her that while . She lifted up her eyes but once , and saw the witch ’s house standing where it was wo nt , but no shape of man moving about it ; then she turned aside to a little brake of thorn and eglantine in the meadow hard by , and laid her down on the grass in the shade thereof , and almost before her head touched the ground she fell asleep , and slept there long and peacefully . Chapter XVI ~ Birdalone Findeth Her Witch - Mistress Dead It was some while after noon when she wakened , and the sun was shining bright and hot . Somewhat she felt the burden of fear upon her , even before she was fully come to herself , and knew not what it was that she feared ; but when she called to mind that it was even the meeting with her old mistress , her flesh quaked indeed with the memory of bygone anguish , but valiantly she arose and faced the dwelling of the witch despite her naked helplessness . As she went she looked up unto it , and saw no smoke coming from the chimney , but marvelled little thereat since it was not yet cooking - time and the weather hot . She drew nigher , and saw someone sitting on the bench without the door whereas the witch was wonted ; and her heart beat quick , for she saw presently that it was none other than her mistress . Moreover , near to her stood three of the milch - kine lowing uneasily and as in reproach , even as such beasts use when their udders be full and they desire to be milked . Birdalone stayed a minute , and her legs nigh failed her for fear , and then because of the very fear she hastened on till she came within ten paces of the said witch ; and sore she missed her bow and arrows , and the cutting blade of her feigned squirehood , lest the carline should arise and come raging and shrieking at her . Then spake Birdalone in no feeble voice , and said : Dame , I am come back unto thee , as thou seest , in even such plight as I fled from thee ; and I have a mind to dwell in this land : what sayest thou ? The witch neither moved nor spake at her word ; and the kine , who had held silence when she first came up , and had turned from her , fell to their peevish lowing again . Birdalone drew a step nigher , and said : Dost thou hear me , dame , or art thou exceeding wroth with me , and art pondering what vengeance thou wilt take on me ? Still no answer came from the carline , and the kine kept on lowing now and again . Once more Birdalone drew nigher , and spake loudly and said : Tell me at least , is it peace between us or unpeace ? But now when she looked she saw that the eyes of the witch were open and staring , and her lips white , and her hands hard writhen ; and she cried out and said : Is she dead ? or will she waken presently and beat me ? surely she is dead . And she put forth her hand and touched her face , and it was stone - cold ; and she found that she was dead beyond any question . Then was a great weight lifted off her heart , and she turned about and looked on the meadows and up to the trees of the wood and down to the rippling stream before her , and fair and sweet and joyous were they gotten unto her ; and she looked at the kine who were drawing up towards her , and she laughed merrily , and went to the out - house hard by and took forth a milking - pail and a stool and fell to milking them one after the other , and the beasts went off down the meadow lowing in a changed voice , for joy to wit , this time . But Birdalone knelt down and drank a long draught of the sweet warm milk , and then arose and went swiftly into the house , and saw nought changed or worsened so far as she could see . There was her own bed in the corner , and the mistress ’s , greater and much fairer , over against it ; and the hutch by the door wherein the victual was kept : she opened it now , and found three loaves there on the shelf , and a meal - tub down below , and she took a loaf and broke it and fell to eating it as she walked about the chamber . There was her bow standing in a nook beside the hutch , and the quiver of arrows hanging on the wall above it . There was the settle lying athwart from the hearth ; and she smiled , and fitted her wrists to the back of the carven bear which made its elbow , whereto the witch was wo nt to tie them when she chastised her . Then she went to the coffers that stood against the wall behind it , and threw up the lid of one of them , and found therein a smock or two of her own , yellowed by the lapse of time , and her old grey coat , ragged as it was when last she wore it , and now somewhat moth - eaten withal ; and she drew forth both smocks and coat and laid them on the settle . Then she opened another coffer , and therein were gay and gaudy gowns and gear of the witch ’s wear ; but lying amongst them , as if the witch had worn them also , her green gown and shoon which her own hands had broidered . But she said : Nay , ye have been in ill company , I will wear you not , though ye be goodly , at least not till ye have been fumigated and hallowed for me . Therewith she turned back to the settle and did on her her old smock and her ragged grey coat , and said : To - day at least will these be good enough for today ’s work . And she knit her brow withal , and walked with a firm step out - a - doors and stood a while gazing on the dead corpse of her enemy ; and she thought how that here was that which once was so great a thing unto her for the shaping of her life - days , and which so oft came to her waking thoughts after she had escaped from her hands , ( though , as aforesaid , she seldom dreamed of her a - night - time ) , and moreover an hour ago she yet feared it so sore that she scarce might stand for the fear of it ; and now it was nought but a carven log unto her . But she told herself that the work was to be done ; so she dragged the body away thence , and across the brook , and a little way into the meadow , and then she went back and fetched mattock and spade from the outhouse , where she knew they lay , and so fell to digging a grave for the corpse of her dead terror . But howso hard she might toil , she was not through with the work ere night began to fall on her , and she had no mind to go on with her digging by night . Wherefore she went back into the house , and lighted candles , whereof was no lack , and made her supper of the bread and the milk ; and then sat pondering on her life that had been till the passion arose in her bosom , and the tears burst out , and long she wept for desire of others and pity for herself . Then she went to the bed she had been erst wo nt to , and laid her down and fell asleep . And her mistress walked not , nor meddled with her peace ; nor did Birdalone so much as dream of her , but of her mother and Master Jacobus in the fair city of the Five Crafts ; and in her sleep she wept for thinking of them . Chapter XVII ~ Birdalone Layeth to Earth the Body of the Witch , and Findeth the Sending Boat Broken Up When morning was , Birdalone awoke , and felt a weight upon her heart , and called to mind the task which lay before her . So she arose and clad herself , and went straight to the grave begun , and toiled hard till she had digged it out deep , and sithence she dragged the witch thereinto and heaped the earth upon her . Then she bathed her in the nighest pool of the brook , and went back into the house and made her breakfast on the bread and milk , and it was then about mid - morning . Thereafter she went about the house , and saw to the baking of bread , and so out to the meadow to see to the kine and the goats , and then stored the milk for making butter and cheese , and did in all wise as if she were to dwell long in that stead ; but thereafter she rested her body , whiles her thought went wide about . But she said to herself that she would not go up to the Oak of Tryst to meet the wood - mother that day , but would abide the night , in case aught befell that she should tell her . But when the sun was getting low she roused herself and went out , and walked about the meadow , and hearkened to the birds ’
141483	143566	141469	141469	thou	3491	’ houses ; or have I not seen thy grey coat of old time , while thou wert living amidst the witch ’s cruelty ? Yea forsooth , said Birdalone ; thou needest not to ask this . Verily not , said Habundia , nor why thou art not clad in the fair green gown which thou didst broider ; for whiles I have seen the witch flaunting it on the wooden ugly body of her , and thou wouldst not wear it after she had cursed it with her foulness . Is it not so ? Yea , it is even so , said Birdalone ; dost thou love me the less therefor ? Habundia laughed again : Were I a man of Adam ’s sons , said she , I might make thee many words on the seemliness of thy short coat , and the kindness of it , that it will be for ever slipping off one or other of thy shoulders . But now am I at least enough thy mother , and thou art dwelling even so much in my house , that the next time we meet ( and that shall be tomorrow ) I shall fetch thee raiment which shall make us forget that thou camest back again to this land as naked as thou didst depart thence . Birdalone reddened and hung down her head , but the wood - mother sat down beside her and kissed her and said : But now forget all save thy tale , and tell all as closely as thou mayest , for I would lose nought thereof . Yea , said Birdalone ; and where shall I begin ? Said Habundia : I know nought thereof save the beginning , that thou fledst away naked and escaped the witch ; and the ending , to wit , that the Sending Boat failed thee at the last of the Wonder Isles , and that thou calledst on me not wholly in vain , whereas the witch was dead , and therefore there was nought to stay me from sending thee one of my trees and the wight thereof ( whom belike I may show to thee one day ) to save thee from the bottom of the deep water . At that word Birdalone threw herself on the wood - wife and clipped and kissed her , and thanked her for the helping with all the dearest words she might . But the wood - mother laughed for joy , and stroked her cheeks and said : Now I deem thee my daughter again , whereas thou thankest me with such sweet passion for doing to thee as a kind mother needs must without any thought thereof . And I bid thee , my dear , never again to go so far from me as that I may not easily help thee and comfort thee from out of my realm wherein I am mighty . And now tell me all in thy dear speech . Therewith Birdalone began her story without more ado , even as ye have heard it afore . Yea and many more things than we can set down did she tell , for full filled she was with the wisdom of the wood . And between whiles the wood - mother fed her with dainty meat and drink , such as Birdalone had never erst tasted the like of . And by then she had got so far as her flight from the Isle of Increase Unsought , the sun was set and the twilight begun . And the wood - wife said : Now shalt thou go home to thine house ; and have no fear of witch or evil thing , for I am not far from thee and will watch over thee . Sweet is thy tale , my daughter , and dear are thy she - friends ; and if ever it may be that I may do them any pleasure , fain were I ; and that especially to thy Viridis , who meseemeth is both sweet and wise even as thou thyself art . Nay , dost thou begrudge my loving her ? Nay , nay , said Birdalone , laughing ; but I rejoice in it . And hereafter when I tell thee how sorely they paid for helping me , I will bid thee to love them yet more than now thou dost . Therewith they parted , and Birdalone came to her house ; and on the way she made as it were a feigned tale in mockery of her old trouble , that there would be the witch - mistress awaiting her to whip her . So that when she came to the door she was half frighted with her own mock , lest the witch might now at last have taken to walking . But all was quiet when she entered with the last of the twilight , and she rested that night in all peace , as in the best of her days in the Five Crafts . Chapter XIX ~ Habundia Hideth Birdalone ’s Nakedness with Faery Raiment Next morning Birdalone tarried about the house as little a while as she might , and then went hastening up to the wood ; and when she came within sight of the Trysting Tree , lo ! there was Habundia before her , and the hands of her busy turning over goodly raiment , so that it was well - nigh as if the days had gone back to the time of the Captivity , and the sitter under the oak was Birdalone herself dealing with her half - finished gown . Joyously they met and embraced each other , and then spake the wood - wife : Now , thou darling of the world , I have been no worse than my word , and if thou durst wear web of the Faery thou shalt presently be clad as goodly as ever thou wert down there amongst the knighthood ; and then thy tale , my dear , and , if it may be , the wisdom of the barren wood - wife set thereto . And therewith she laid on Birdalone ’s outstretched arms the raiment she had brought with her , and it was as if the sunbeam had thrust through the close leafage of the oak , and made its shadow nought a space about Birdalone , so gleamed and glowed in shifty brightness the broidery of the gown ; and Birdalone let it fall to earth , and passed over her hands and arms the fine smock sewed in yellow and white silk , so that the web thereof seemed of mingled cream and curd ; and she looked on the shoon that lay beside the gown , that were done so nicely and finely that the work was as the feather - robe of a beauteous bird , whereof one scarce can say whether it be bright or grey , thousand - hued or all simple of colour . Birdalone quivered for joy of the fair things , and crowed in her speech as she knelt before Habundia to thank her : then in a twinkling had she done off her beggar ’s raiment , and then the smock clung about her darling nakedness , and next the gown was shimmering all over her , and the golden girdle embraced her loins as though it loved them worthily ; and Birdalone looked to the wood round about her and laughed , while Habundia lay in her place and smiled upon her with gentle loving - kindness . But in a little while was Birdalone sobered ; for the thought of how fair she should look to the eyes of her beloved when she was shown unto him on the day of days , thrust her light and eager pleasure aside ; and she took up her shoes from the ground ( for she had not done them on ) , and sat down beside the wood - wife and fell a - toying with the marvel of them ; and thus without more ado began her tale again , whereas she had left it last even , when she had told of how the Sending Boat was speeding her over the waters toward the Isle of the Young and the Old . Chapter XX ~ Birdalone Telleth Habundia of Her Love for Arthur , and Getteth from Her Promise of Help Therein Long they sat there that day , and until the sun was down , and by then had Birdalone little to tell of her story , for she was gotten therein to the days of the Five Crafts . Many times had she wept and turned to Habundia for solace as she told , not without shame , but without any covering up , all the tale of her love for Arthur the Black Squire , and how she was surprised by the love of him , and of his wisdom and grace and loveliness . And the wood - mother was ever as sweet and kind unto her as could be ; yet might another than a lover have seen that much of all this was strange unto her , and she looked upon Birdalone as a child who has broken her toy , and is hard to comfort for the loss of it , though there be a many more in the world . But when it grew dusk as aforesaid , and it was time to part , she spake to Birdalone , and said : True it is , my child , that thou hast lived long in these six years time ; neither do I wonder at the increase of thy beauty , and the majesty thereof ; for fair is the life thou hast lived , although thou hast been grieved and tormented by it at whiles . And now I know what it is for which thou longest ; and herein again will I play the mother unto thee , and seek about to fetch thee that thou wouldst have ; so be not over - anxious or troubled ; and thou mayest be good herein , as my fair child should be ; for this I have noted in thee , that Love is not so tyrannous a master but that his servants may whiles think of other matters , and so solace their souls , that they may live despite of all . Now was Birdalone arisen , and stood before her friend confused and blushing . But Habundia put her two hands on her shoulders and kissed her , and said : Go home now and sleep , and come again tomorrow and let us hear the last of thy tale ; and when that is done , maybe I shall be able to do something for thine avail . So they parted , and on the morrow Birdalone came again and told the remnant of her story , which was not so long now that the Black Squire was out of it . And when she had done , Habundia kept silence awhile , and then she said : One thing I will tell thee , that whereas erewhile it was but seldom indeed that any son of Adam might be seen in the woodland here , of late , that is , within the last three years , there be many such amongst us ; and to our deeming they be evil beasts , more pitiless and greedy than any bear ; and but that we have nought to do with them , for they fear us and flee from us , we should have destroyed them one and all . And now that I have heard all thy story , it seemeth unto me not so unlike but these may be the remnants of the bands of the Red Hold , and that they have drifted hither fleeing before the might of thy friends of the knighthood . Wherefore now , trust me that I will look into this , but I must needs be away from here for a little ; so hold thy soul in patience though hear thou nought of me , and dwell quietly at home for seven days ’
143706	149643	143679	143679	she	108	’ raiment and bearing something over the left arm , for her bow was in her right hand . So Birdalone ran to meet her , and embraced and kissed her , and was merry over her , and said : Dear mother , thou farest far from thy fastness today . Said Habundia : There is nought in the meadows now save the neat and the goats and thou ; of none of that folk am I afraid . But mayhappen thou shalt be afraid to come with me into the depths of the wildwood , for thither would I lead thee . I will be afraid of nought with thee beside me , said Birdalone . But come now and look upon the house that I have won for me . And she took her hand and led her along ; and the wood - wife said no more till they were across the brook and standing by the porch . Then said Birdalone : Thou hast a green gown over thine arm ; is that also for me ? Yea , certes , said Habundia ; the old rag which thou hast on thee , and which thou lovest so sore , is not fine enough for my company ; and the glitter - gown I gave thee may be too fine for the thorns and the briars , and moreover thou mayst be over - easily seen if thou bear that broidered sunshine mid the boughs . Wherefore go in now and do on this other coat , though the faery have made it , and then come out to me with thy bow and thy quiver , and I shall find thee sandal - shoon and girdle withal . Nay , wood - mother , said Birdalone , hallow my house by entering it , and eat a morsel with me and drink the wine of the horned folk ere we go our ways . Habundia shook her head and knit her brows somewhat as she looked hard on the house ; then she said : I know not , Adam ’s daughter ; I have little to do with houses , and doubt if a house be safe for me . And this one that the witch builded ! and belike she buried some human being at one of its four corners . Tell me , fair child , sawest thou ever here at night - tide the shape of a youngling crowned with a garland straying about the house ? Nay , never at all , said Birdalone . Said the wood - wife : Then maybe thou hast hallowed it with the wisdom and love of thee , and I may venture ; and moreover I note that it is all builded of trees and the grass of the earth ; and thou art free to use them by my leave . But if aught befall of my coming under thy roof , heed it not too much , but think , whatsoever my aspect may be , I am thy wood - mother and wisdom - mother that loveth thee . And I bid thee also wish with all thy might that my aspect may not change to thee . Also , if I eat , thou wert best not to sign the meat as Adam ’s sons are wo nt . Lead in then ; for now am I grown wilful , and will enter whatever betide . Birdalone marvelled at those words , but she fell to wishing strongly that her friend might not lose her lovely youthful shape either then or ever , and she took her hand , which trembled somewhat , and led her over the threshold ; and when they were under the roof herseemed that the wood - mother dwindled in a wondrous way , though her face was as sweet and her limbs as shapely as ever ; and she laughed shrilly yet sweetly , and spake in a thin clear voice : Birdalone , my dear , wish strongly , wish strongly ! though thou shalt see nothing worse of me than this . And she was scarce three feet high , but as pretty as a picture . Thereat indeed was Birdalone affrighted , but she wished all she might , and stooped down to kiss this little creature ; and therewith again the wood - wife seemed to wax again as great and tall as ever she was , and her voice came full and strong again , as she laughed and said : Now is it all over for this time , and I see how well thou lovest me ; and I pray thee love me no less for this wonder thou hast seen in me . But now it were better that I never go under a roof again . And she took her arms about Birdalone and clipped her lovingly ; and glad was Birdalone to feel her so strong and solid again . Then they sat to the board and ate a simple meal of bread and cheese and wood - berries , and drank milk withal ; and the wood - mother was merry , and the smiles danced over her face as she looked on Birdalone with all loving - kindness , so that Birdalone wondered what was toward ; but so light - hearted and happy she grew , that she deemed it might be nought save good . But when they had eaten , then Birdalone did off her old coat , which she said was meet enough for her daily toil , and did on the fair green hunting - gown and the sandal - shoon , and girt her with the fair girdle which Habundia had fetched her , and drew up the laps of her gown therethrough till her legs were all free of the skirts . And Habundia looked on her , and laughed and said : Now are these white and smooth legs as bad as the gleam - gown for the lying hid ; but it may no better be , and thou must draw thy skirts down and stumble , if needs must be , when we come to the ambushment . Birdalone reddened as she laughed at the word , and took down her bow and hung her quiver at her back and thrust her sharp knife into her girdle , and forth they went both of them , and were presently past the bent which went up from the meadows and in amongst Habundia ’s trees . Chapter XXII ~ Birdalone Wendeth the Wildwood in Fellowship with Habundia Now as they went their ways lightly through the wood , spake Habundia and said : Birdalone , my child , fair is the gold ring with the sapphire stone that the third finger of thy right hand beareth ; seldom have I seen so fair a stone as that deep blue one ; hangeth any tale thereby ? Said Birdalone : Did I not tell thee thereof , wood - mother , how that my beloved who is lost gave it unto me the very last time I saw him , woe worth the while ? Nay , said Habundia , I mind not the tale . But deemest thou he would know it again if he saw it ? Yea , surely , said Birdalone , hanging her head ; for when first he gave it , the gift was not to me , but to another woman . And she held her peace , and went on with hanging head and all the glee faded out of her a while . At last she turned to Habundia , and said : I have now bethought me to ask thee whither we be going and on what errand ; for at first I was so glad at heart , I know not why , and it was so merry to be wending the wood with thee freely , that I had no thought in me as to whither and wherefore . But now wilt thou tell me ? Said the wood - wife : How if I were to tell thee we were going a - hunting ? Birdalone said : Then I should ask thee what like the quarry were . And suppose it were men ? said the wood - wife . Birdalone turned somewhat pale . My mother , she said , if we be going against some of those men of the Red Bands , I am not happy over it . I am no warrior , and fear strokes . Said Habundia , laughing : Yet art thou a fell archer ; and thou mayest shoot from an ambush of the thick leaves , since June is in today . But neither would I slay or hurt any man , said Birdalone , but it were to save me from present death . Habundia looked on her with a sly smile and said : Well maybe though we take cover and get within wind of our quarry thou shalt not need to speed an arrow to him . Have patience therefore . For this is a strange beast which I have marked down ; he is not ill to look on , and his voice , which we may well hearken , for whiles he singeth , is rather sweet than surly . What meanest thou , mother ? said Birdalone , growing red and then paler yet ; what man is it ? since thy calling him a beast is a jest , is it not ? Nay , said Habundia , I neither name him nor know him ; only I deem him by no means to be one of the Red Band . For the rest , he may be a man in a beast ’s skin , or a beast in a man ’s skin , for aught I know ; whereas he seems , so far as I have seen him , to be not wholly man - like or wholly beast - like . But now let us hold our peace of him till we be come nigher to his haunt . So they went on their way , and Birdalone said but little , while the wood - wife was of many words and gay . They made all diligence , for Birdalone was not soon wearied , and moreover as now she was anxious and eager to see what would befall , which she might not but deem would be something great . They went without stay till past noon , when they were come to a little shady dale wherethrough ran a clear stream ; there they rested and bathed them , and thereafter sat under the boughs and ate the dainty meat which the wood - wife provided , howsoever she came by it ; and when they had rested a while , the wood - wife turned the talk once more unto Arthur the Black Squire , and would have Birdalone tell her all nicely what manner of man he was ; and Birdalone was nothing loth thereto ; for had she her will she had talked of him day - long . Chapter XXIII ~ The Wood - Wife Bringeth Birdalone to the Sight of Arthur in the Wildwood Now they go on again , no less speedily than before , and rest but little , until it was hard on an hour before sunset . And now Habundia began to go warily , as if they were come anigh to their journey ’s end and the thing that they sought . They were come by now to a long bent of the forest well grown with big - boled oak - trees , not very close together , so that short fine greensward was all underneath them ; and Habundia went heedfully from bole to bole , as if she would be ready to cover herself if need were ; and Birdalone went after her , and was now flushed of face , and her eyes glittered , and her heart beat fast , and her legs trembled under her , as she went running from tree to tree . So came they nigh to the crown of the bent , and before them were the oak - trees sparser and smaller as they went down the further side , which seemed by their sudden shortening to be steeper than the hither side ; and betwixt them showed the topmost of thorn and whitebeam and logwood , intertwined with eglantine and honeysuckle and the new shoots of the traveller ’s joy . There the wood - wife put forth her hand to bid Birdalone stay , who came up to her friend and stood before her eager and quivering : and anon came the sound of a man ’s voice singing , though they could hear no words in it as yet amidst the rustle of the trees and the tumult of song which the blackbirds and throstles raised in the dale below them . Then spake the wood - wife softly : Hearken , we are right and the time is good , our beast is giving tongue : now below us is the bent - side steep , and goeth down into a very little dale with a clear stream running amidst ; and therein is the very lair of the thing that we are hunting . Wherefore now let us slip warily down between the bushes till we get close to the bottom , and then belike we shall see the very creature quite close , and we shall then consider and think what we shall do with him . Birdalone had no voice wherewith to answer her , but she stole quietly along by her side till they came to the bank of the dale and plunged into the thicket that flourished there , and fell to threading it , making them as small as might be . But ere they had gone but a little way the wordless song of what was below had ceased , and they heard the sweet tingle of the string - play , and the wood - wife stayed her to hearken , and the smiles went rippling over her face and she beat time with her fingers ; but Birdalone , she stared wildly before her , and would have scrambled down the bank straightway at all hazards , for that string - play was a melody of the Castle of the Quest , but Habundia withheld her by the arm . And then suddenly the music died , and there came up a voice of wailing and lamenting , and Birdalone put her hands and held the palms tight against her ears , and was at point to cry out aloud herself ; but Habundia drew a hand of her down and whispered into her ear : Child , child , make thyself strong and forbear , and then perchance joy may come to thee ; hold thy peace and come softly along with me ! So Birdalone forbore , and strove with her passion , though the sobs rent her bosom for a while ; and by then the loud lamenting waned and was done , and the sound of sobbing came up from below , as it had been an echo of Birdalone ’s grief . Then Habundia drew her on again till they saw the level of the dale and its stream piecemeal betwixt the leaves , and they had a glimpse of a man on the hither side of the stream ; and again they went lower , till they were well - nigh on a level with the greensward of the dale ; and as Birdalone knelt with head bent low , and her hands covering her eyes , the wood - wife put away from before her the thick leaves of a hazel - bush , and whispering said : Child , child ! look forth now and see what is before thee , and see if thou knowest him , or if he be strange to thee , and thy mother hath done nought for thee when all is said . Birdalone looked up , pale and wild - eyed , and into the dale , and saw a man sitting on the grass by the stream - side with his head bowed down on to his knees and his face covered with his hands ; he was clad but in two or three deerskins hung about him , with a strip of skin for a girdle , wherein was thrust a short sword ; his brown hair hung down long and shaggy over his face . Close by his side lay a little harp , and further off a short spear roughly hefted with an ash - staff . He was beating the earth with his feet and writhing him about over them . And Birdalone looked , and her breath well - nigh failed her . For presently he sat more quietly , and lifted up his head , and she saw his face that it was Arthur , her beloved ; and now she durst not move lest he should spring up and flee away ; and the mingled pain and longing within her was sweet indeed , but well - nigh deadly . Now his hand sought round to his harp , and he took it in his arms and fondled it as it were , and his fingers went among the strings , and anon the voice of it came forth , and it was nought changed from the last time it spake , and Birdalone hearkened breathlessly , till the melody died again and Arthur looked about him and raised his face as a dog when it fares to howl . Then Birdalone gave a great cry , and leapt forth out of the thicket and stood on the greensward with nought betwixt them two , and she stretched out her arms to her beloved and cried out : O ! no , no , no ! do it not , I beseech thee , lest I deem that thou art all changed , and that the man and the dear heart beloved of thee has gone out of thee and left thee but a beast in a man ’s shape ! He leapt up as she spake , and thrust forward his head and looked fierce at her , and cried out : What ! art thou come again ? This is the second time I have seen thee , thou image of her that hath tormented me so long ; of her that left me in my most need and hid herself away from me . Hah ! a man , sayest thou ? Did I not strive with it , and hold my manhood so long as I might ; and at last it might no longer be , and I became a beast and a man - slayer ? But what avails it to talk with thee , since thou art but the image of her that hath wasted my life . Yet perchance of the image I may make an end since I may not lay hand on the very destroyer herself ; and , woe ’s me , how I loved her ! yea , and do still ; but not thee , O false image ! And forthwith he drew the blade from his girdle and sprang forward at Birdalone ; and she cowered and cringed , but moved not else . But therewithal the wood - wife came leaping through the bushes , and she nocked an arrow on her bended bow , and threatened him therewith , and cried out : Thou man - beast , I will slay thee if thou hurt my child and my dear ; so forbear ! Nay , I tell thee more , unless thou make her as glad at the sight of thee as I meant her to be , I will in the long run slay thee ; so look to it . He laughed and said : What ! there is another image of the love that wasted me , is there ! Nay , but by the Hallows , this new - comer is the first one , and the one who chattered at me is the second . Or is it this , that all women now have the semblance of the evil one that has undone me , and there is nought else left ? And he stood staring at Birdalone and moved not a while ; and she stood with her hands before her face cringing before him . Then he raised his arm and cast the weapon far into the bushes of the bank - side , and then came forward and stood before Birdalone , and drew down her hands from her face and stared in the eyes of her , holding her by the two arms ; and he said : Thou hast forgotten now , belike , how fair a life we two might have lived if thou hadst not fled from me and spoiled me . And thou ! by the looks of thee , for thou art sleek and fair , though this moment thou art pale for fear of me , thou hast lived a happy life through all these years , with many a merry thing to think of : and dost thou deem that my life was happy , or that I thought of any merry thing , or of anything save my sorrow ? Dost thou doubt it ? go ask the good spears of Greenford , or the Riders of the Red Hold , and the field of the slaughter ! If there was little joy there , less was there elsewhere . He left go of her therewith and stood trembling before her , and she bowed down and put palm to palm and held them out to him as one who prays ; and she knew not what she did . Then he cried out with a lamentable cry and said : O woe ’s me ! for I have frighted her and scared the wit out of her , so that she knows not who I am nor what I would ; and I would pray to her and beseech her to pity me , and not depart from me again or mock me with images of herself . Then he went down on his knees to her , and he also joined his hands to pray to her ; but it seemed as if she was stricken to stone , so wholly she moved not . But for him , he sank his forehead to earth , and then he rolled over and his limbs stretched out , and his head turned aside and blood gushed out from his mouth . But Birdalone shrieked out and cast herself on his body , and cried : I have found him , and he is dead ! he is dead , and I have slain him , because I was a timorous fool and feared him ; and he was coming to his right mind and knew me for what I was ! But Habundia came and stood over them , and drew up Birdalone , and said : Nay , nay , be comforted ! for now he is thus , and the strength is gone out of him for a while , we may deal with him . Abide , and I will fetch the blood - staunching herb and the sleepy herb , and then we will heal him , and he will come to his right mind and be a man again . Therewith she hastened away and was gone but a little ; and meanwhile Birdalone knelt down by her love and wiped the blood from him , and caressed his sword - hardened hands and moaned over him . But when the wood - wife came back she put Birdalone aside once more , and knelt down by the squire and raised his head , and laid the blood - stauncher to his mouth and his heart , and muttered words over him , while Birdalone looked over her shoulder with her pale face ; then the she - leech fetched water from the stream in a cup which she drew from her wallet , and she washed his face , and he came somewhat to himself , so that she might give him drink of the water ; and yet more he came to himself . So then she took the sleepy herb and bruised it in her hands and put in his mouth and again said words over him , and presently his head fell back and his eyes closed and he slept peacefully . She stood up then and turned to Birdalone and said : Now , my child , have we done all that we may do , save that we shall bring him to a place where the dew and the sun shall not torment him and sicken him ; for he shall lie thus till the sun comes up tomorrow , or longer ; and fear nor , for when he awaketh he shall be in his right mind , and shall know thee and love thee . This I swear to thee by the earth and the sun and the woodland . Said Birdalone , trembling yet : O mother , but may I kiss him and caress him ? Yea , surely , said the wood - mother , smiling in her face , but be not too long over it , for lo ! the last of the sun , and it were better that he be under cover ere the twilight falls . Birdalone knelt down by her love quietly at that word , and fell to kissing him softly , and laid her cheek to his , and called him gentle names such as none can tell again without shame , till the wood - wife laid her hand on her shoulder and said kindly and sweetly : Rise up now , for thou must make it enough for this present ; thou shalt have time enough hereafter for more and much more . So Birdalone arose and said : How shall we bear him to his place ? Shall I not take him by the shoulders and thou by the legs ? For I am stronger than thou after all these years . Laughed the wood - wife : Nay , little one , said she ; thou knowest me not utterly as yet . Thou shalt not bear him at all , nor any part of him ; I am strong enough for more than that ; see thou ! And she stooped down and took him up in her arms as if he were a little child , and stepped off lightly with him ; but looked back over her shoulder and said to Birdalone : But thou mayest walk by me and hold a hand of him as we go , though it will hinder me somewhat ; but I know thine heart and would pleasure thee , my child . Birdalone ran up to her and thanked her and kissed her , and took Arthur ’s left hand , while Habundia bore him on down the dale and out of it , and still along the stream till they came to a place where it was narrow on either side thereof , and a sheer rock came down so near to the water that there was but a strip of greensward three yards wide betwixt water and rock ; and in the face of the rock was a cave wide enough for a man to enter by stooping somewhat . Therein the wood - wife lightly bore Arthur , and Birdalone followed ; and they found the cave dry and roomy within ; there was a bed therein of dry heather and bracken , and thereon Habundia laid her burden , and said : Now , my child , there is nought to do but abide till he comes to himself again , which may be some time tomorrow ; and be of good cheer , for he will come to his right self , but he will be weak and humble ; but I shall have meat and drink ready for him . Now if thou wilt be ruled by me , thou wilt keep out of the way when he awakens ; moreover , be thou not scared if I meet his awakening with another shape than that which thou hast known of me ; for sure it is that it will trouble his wits over - much if again he seeth the two of us alike . But fear not ; for thy sake , my child , I will take no ugly shape , though it may well be less beauteous than thine . I will do what thou wilt , mother , said Birdalone , for I see that thou art helping me all thou mayest ; yet I beseech thee let me sit by him till the time of his awakening draweth nigh . The wood - wife smiled and nodded yeasay on her , and they sat down , both of them , beside the sleeping man , and the day died into the night as they sat hearkening to the ripple of the brook and the song of the nightingales . Chapter XXIV ~ The Wood - Mother Changeth Her Form to That of A Woman Stricken in Years When the morrow came , there yet lay Arthur sleeping peacefully , and Birdalone awoke from the slumber which had at last fallen on her , and looked about her and saw not Habundia in the cave ; so she arose and bent over Arthur and kissed him , and so went forth and stood in the door and looked about her . And she was still dim - eyed with her just departed slumber and the brightness of the morning sunlight , and she scarce knew whether it were a part of a dream , or a sight that was verily before her , that she seemed to see one coming across the brook toward her , stepping heedfully from stone to stone thereof : a woman stricken in years , but slim and trim and upright , clad in a gown of green cloth , with a tippet of some white fur . When she was come on to the greensward she spake to Birdalone in a sweet voice , but thin with eld , and gave her the sele of the day ; and Birdalone was somewhat afraid to see a newcomer , but she greeted her , drawing back a little from her shyly . But the old woman said : What maketh thee here , my daughter ? Dost thou not know that this is my land and my house , and that I am said not to be unmighty in these woods ? I pray thee pardon me if I have done amiss , said Birdalone ; but here have I a sick friend , a young man , and I would pray thee suffer him to abide here in this cave a little longer ; for there hath been also another friend , a woman , but she hath gone out while I slept , belike to gather simples , for she is wise in leechcraft , and is tending the sick man . I pray thee humbly to suffer us lest we lose our friend . As she spake , she heard the carline chuckle softly , and at last she said : Why , Birdalone , my dear , dost thou not know me after all these years ? Look on me again , look ! and thou shalt see that I am not so much changed from what thou sawest me last night . I am still thine image , my dear , only I was the image of what thou wert , and now I the image of what thou shalt be when two score years and ten of happy life have worn for thee . Tell me , am I now aught like to thy mother in the flesh ? How hast thou frighted me , mother , said Birdalone ; I thought that my friend had forsaken me , and that perchance the new - comer was another witch like unto the old one , and that I was never to be at rest and happy . But as to my mother in the flesh , nay , thou art not now wholly like unto her ; and sooth to say I shall be fainer when thou hast thine own shape of me young back again , for I love thee not so much as now thou art . The wood - wife laughed : Well , she said , thou shalt not see over - much of me in this shape ; and that the less because of something I shall now tell thee , to wit , that I have been thinking the matter over , and I would have thee leave us twain together alone before the young man awaketh . I would have thee get thee home and abide him there ; it shall not be long I promise thee ; and this also , that he shall come home to thee sound in body and whole in limb . Birdalone ’s countenance fell , and she said : Why this second mind , mother ? why , I pray thee ? Said Habundia : I fear for thy love lest he be not strong enough to open his eyes upon thy face ; but after he hath been a day in the woods , and I have spoken to him diversely and cheered him with the hope of meeting thee , he may well be strong enough to seek thee for a mile ’s length , and find thine house first and then thee . So now wilt thou obey me ? Nay , if thou must needs weep , I will be gone into the thicket till thou hast done , thou wilful ! Birdalone smiled through her tears , and said : I pray thee pardon my wilfulness , mother , and I will depart without turning back into the cave . Nay , said Habundia , there is no need for so much haste as that : I will in now , and do my leechdoms with the sick man . But do thou go across the stream , thou barefoot , and thou wilt find on the other side , by the foot of the quicken - tree yonder , honeycombs and white bread and a bicker of wild goats ’
158405	159393	159423	159423	One	504	’ time I will bring you your friends all safe and sound . Now they both said that they would not for aught that they should have no hand in the deliverance of them ; so the wood - wife said : Come with me , and I shall lead you to the place of your ambush . Then all they went on together , and fared a long way west , and toward the place where erst they two had found Arthur ; and at last , two hours before sunset , they came to where was a glade or way between the thickets , which was as it were a little beaten by the goings of man - folk . And the wood - wife did them to wit , that the evil folk aforesaid had so used it and beaten it , that it might just look as if folk were wo nt to pass that way , whereas it was not very far from their chiefest haunt and stronghold . A little on the north side of this half - blind way , and some ten yards through the thicket , the ground fell away into a little dale , the bottom whereof was plain and well grassed , and watered by a brook . Thither the wood - wife brought the twain ; and when they all stood together on the brook - side , she said to them : Dear friends , this is your woodland house for this time , and I rede you go not forth of it , lest ye happen upon any of those evil men ; for nought have ye to fear from any save them . Here amidst these big stones , which make , see ye , as it were a cavern , have I stowed victual for you ; and armour therewithal , because , though both of you are in a manner armed , yet who knoweth where a shaft drawn at a venture may reach . And from the said stones she drew forth two very fair armours , helm and hauberk , and leg and arm wards ; and they were all of green , and shone but little , but were fashioned as no smith of man - folk could have done the like . This is thine , Sir Arthur , said the wood - wife , and thou wilt wear it like as it were silk ; and this thine , my child , and thou art strong enough to bear such light gear . And I charge you both to do on this gear presently , nor do it off till ye have achieved the adventure . And now this is the last word : here is a horn of oliphant which thou shalt wear about thy neck , Birdalone ; and if thou be sore bestead , or thy heart faileth thee , blow in it , yet not before the onfall ; and then , whether thou blow much or little , thou shalt be well holpen . Now be not downcast if nought befall to - night or tomorrow , or even the day after ; but if the third day be tidingless , then at sunset burn a hair of my head , Birdalone , and I will come to you . And now farewell ! for I have yet to do in this matter . With that she kissed Birdalone fondly and embraced Arthur , and went her way ; and those twain abode in the dale , and slept and watched by turns , and all was tidingless till the morrow ’s dawn ; neither was there aught to tell of on that day and the night that ended it . Chapter XXXII ~ Of the Fight in the Forest and the Rescue of Those Friends from the Men of the Red Company Light was growing on the dawn of the next day , and the colours of things could be seen , when Birdalone , who was holding this last watch of the night , stood still and hearkened , deeming that she could hear some noise that was neither the morning wind in the tree - boughs nor the going of the wild things anear them in the wood . So she did off her helm to hear the better , and stood thus a little ; then she turned about and stooped down to Arthur , who was yet sleeping , and put forth a hand to rouse him . But or ever she touched him , broke forth a sound of big and rough voices and laughter , and amidst it two shrieks as of women . Arthur heard it , and was on his feet in a moment , and helmed , and he caught up his bended bow and cast on the quiver ( for Birdalone was already weaponed ) , and without more words they went forth swiftly up the bank and through the thicket till they were looking on the half - blind way , but under cover , and there was nothing before them as yet . There they stayed and hearkened keenly . There were no more shrieks of women , nor heard they any weapon clash , but the talking and laughter of men went on ; and at last they heard a huge and grim whoop of many men together ; and then thereafter was less sound of talking , but came the jingle as of arms and harness ; and Arthur whispered in Birdalone ’s ear : Stand close ! they have gotten to horse , and will be coming our way . Nock an arrow . And even so did he . Therewith they heard clearly the riding of men , and in less than five minutes ’

Atra rode upright , and looking straight before her ; Aurea hung her head all she might , and her long red hair fell about her face ; but Viridis had swooned , and was held up in the saddle by one of the caitiffs on each side of her . They were but little disarrayed , save that some felon had torn the bosom of Viridis ’
163548	163776	163825	163825	Birdalone	108	’ tale , save that she told how that it was she that had uttered those two shrieks which Arthur and Birdalone had heard from the thicket ; and that she had so done when the two false way - leaders laid hold of her to drag her away from her man , who stood there before her bound to a tree that he might perish there , whereon the two caitiffs had smitten her into unwit that they might have no more of her cries . Now when all this had been told , and they had abided awhile in the fair little dale , and had said many kind endearing words of friendship , they went up on the green way again , and took what of the horses they needed and trussed their goods thereon ( and Birdalone would not leave that brave armour which Habundia had given her ) , and they dight others for their home - riding , and the rest they turned loose into the woods , and so rode their ways , Birdalone going ever with Atra , and Arthur by Aurea ; but Viridis must needs have Hugh within reach of her hand all the way . Good speed they made , so that ere the night had fallen on them , though the sun was set , they ‘
