1630	1635	1637	1638	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Ah , Ellis , "
1651	1663	1637	1638	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" we must try to be a comfort to poor papa ! "

2407	2411	2402	2403	the Doctor	326	" very particular , "
2762	2774	2775	2775	he	90	" I hope you have had something to eat , Lucilla , "
2778	2832	2775	2775	he	90	" do n't get into that foolish habit of flying to tea as a man flies to a dram . It 's a more innocent stimulant , but it 's the same kind of intention . I am not so much against a fire ; it has always a kind of cheerful look . "
2833	2838	2840	2841	his daughter	286	" Oh , papa , "
2850	2865	2840	2841	his daughter	286	" you ca n't suppose I want anything to look cheerful this dreadful day . "
2866	2877	2879	2880	the Doctor	326	" I am far from blaming you , my dear , "
2882	2958	2879	2880	the Doctor	326	" it is natural you should cry . I am sorry I did not write for my sister to come , who would have taken care of you ; but I dislike strangers in the house at such a time . However , I hope , Lucilla , you will soon feel yourself able to return to school ; occupation is always the best remedy , and you will have your friends and companions — — "
2959	2962	2964	2965	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Papa ! "
3034	3037	3038	3038	she	88	" Papa ! "
3059	3136	3138	3138	Lucilla	119	" oh , do n't send me away ! I was only a silly girl the other day , but this has made me a woman . Though I can never , never hope to take dear mamma 's place , and be — all — that she was to you , still I feel I can be a comfort to you if you will let me . You shall not see me cry any more , "
3147	3210	3138	3138	Lucilla	119	" I will never give way to my feelings . I will ask for no companions — nor — nor anything . As for pleasure , that is all over . Oh , papa , you shall never see me regret anything , or wish for anything . I will give up everything in the world to be a comfort to you ! "
3228	3234	3225	3225	He	90	" Get up , Lucilla ; "
3288	3303	3304	3304	she	324	" It is only for this once — I can — cannot help it , "
3556	3570	3571	3571	he	326	" It is very good of you to propose sacrificing yourself for me , "
3574	3696	3703	3703	he	326	" and if you would sacrifice your excitement in the meantime , and listen to me quietly , it would really be something — but you are only fifteen , Lucilla , and I have no wish to take you from school just now ; wait till I have done . Your poor mother is gone , and it is very natural you should cry ; but you were a good child to her on the whole , which will be a comfort to you . We did everything that could be thought of to prolong her days , and , when that was impossible , to lessen what she had to suffer ; and we have every reason to hope , "
3718	3780	3703	3703	he	326	" that she 's far better off now than if she had been with us . When that is said , I do n't know that there is anything more to add . I am not fond of sacrifices , either one way or another ; and I 've a great objection to any one making a sacrifice for me — — "
3781	3794	3796	3796	Lucilla	119	" But , oh , papa , it would be no sacrifice , "
3798	3811	3796	3796	Lucilla	119	" if you would only let me be a comfort to you ! "
3812	3823	3825	3827	the steady Doctor	409	" That is just where it is , my dear , "
3829	3884	3886	3887	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" I have been used to be left a great deal to myself ; and I am not prepared to say that the responsibility of having you here without a mother to take care of you , and all your lessons interrupted , would not neutralise any comfort you might be . You see , "
3896	3936	3886	3887	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" a man is what his habits make him ; and I have been used to be left a great deal to myself . It answers in some cases , but I doubt if it would answer with me . "
3972	3994	3995	3995	she	119	" Of course , papa , if I ca n't be any comfort — I will — go back to school , "
4012	4026	4028	4030	the peremptory father	411	" Yes , my dear , you will certainly go back to school , "
4032	4124	4028	4030	the peremptory father	411	" I never had any doubt on that subject . You can stay over Sunday and rest yourself . Monday or Tuesday will be time enough to go back to Mount Pleasant ; and now you had better ring the bell , and get somebody to bring you something — or I 'll see to that when I go downstairs . It 's getting late , and this has been a fatiguing day . I 'll send you up some negus , and I think you had better go to bed . "
4435	4442	4443	4443	she	88	" Papa thought me too young , "
4452	4513	4443	4443	she	88	" though it was dreadful to come away and leave him alone with only the servants ; but , dear Miss Martha , you will let me learn all about political economy and things , to help me manage everything ; for now that dear mamma is gone , there is nobody but me to be a comfort to papa .

6383	6427	6378	6381	one of her companions	508	" you will marry some enchanting Italian with a beautiful black beard , and a voice like an angel ; and he 'll sing serenades to you , and do all sorts of things : oh , how I wish I was you ! "
6428	6433	6435	6436	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" That may be , "
6438	6574	6435	6436	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" but I shall never marry an Italian , my dear . I do n't think I shall marry anybody for a long time . I want to amuse myself . I wonder , by the way , if it would improve my voice to take lessons in Italy . Did I ever tell you of the Italian nobleman that was so very attentive to me that Christmas I spent at Sissy Vernon 's ? He was very handsome . I suppose they really are all very handsome — except , of course , the Italian masters ; but I did not pay any attention to him . My object , dear , and you know it , is to return home as well educated as possible , to be a comfort to dear papa . "
6575	6581	6583	6585	the sympathetic girl	510	" Yes , dear Lucilla , "
6587	6617	6583	6585	the sympathetic girl	510	" and it is so good of you ; but do tell me about the Italian nobleman — what did he look like — and what did he say ? "
6618	6634	6636	6636	Lucilla	119	" Oh , as for what he said , that is quite a different matter , "
6638	6702	6636	6636	Lucilla	119	" but it is not what they say , but the way they say it , that is the fun . I did not give him the least encouragement . As for that , I think a girl can always stop a man when she does not care for him . It depends on whether you intend him to commit himself or not , "
6722	6744	6746	6747	her companion	512	" Whether I intend?—oh , goodness , Lucilla ! how can you speak so ? as if I ever intended anything , "
6774	6789	6791	6791	Lucilla	119	" No , I never supposed you did ; I was thinking of myself , "
6806	6899	6791	6791	Lucilla	119	" You know I have seen a good deal of the world , one way and another , with going to spend the holidays , and I could tell you quantities of things . It is quite astonishing how much experience one gets . When I was at Midhurst , at Easter , there was my cousin Tom , who was quite ridiculous ; I declare he nearly brought things to an explanation , Fanny — which , of course , of all things in the world I most wanted to avoid . "
6900	6908	6910	6910	Fanny	106	" Oh , but why , Lucilla ? "
6918	6949	6910	6910	Fanny	106	" I do so want to know what they say when they make — explanations , as you call them . Oh , do tell me , Lucilla , why ? "
6950	6954	6956	6957	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" My dear , "
6959	7067	6956	6957	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" a cousin of my own ! and only twenty - one , and reading for the bar ! In the first place , my aunt would never have forgiven me , and I am very fond of my aunt . It 's so nice to like all one 's relations . I know some girls who ca n't bear theirs . And then a boy not much older than myself , with nothing but what his mother pleases ! Fortunately he did not just say the words , so I escaped that time ; but , of course , I could understand perfectly what he meant . "
7068	7080	7082	7084	the persistent questioner	515	" But , oh , Lucilla , tell me the words , "
7086	7148	7082	7084	the persistent questioner	515	" do , there 's a darling ! I am quite sure you have heard them — and I should so like to know exactly what they say;—do they go down on their knees?—or do they try to take your hand as they always do in novels?—or what do they do?—Oh , Lucilla , tell me , there 's a dear ! "
7149	7152	7154	7154	Lucilla	119	" Nonsense , "
7156	7204	7154	7154	Lucilla	119	" I only want you to understand that I am not likely to fall into any danger of that sort . My only ambition , Fanny , as I have told you often , is to go home to Carlingford and be a comfort to dear papa . "
7205	7208	7210	7210	Fanny	106	" Yes , "
7217	7245	7247	7249	the intelligent girl	517	" and it is so good of you , dear ; but then you can not go on all your life being a comfort to dear papa , "
7265	7273	7275	7276	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" We must leave that to Providence , "
7295	7306	7307	7307	she	88	" I have always been guided for the best hitherto , "

8764	8817	8818	8819	Miss Bury	114	" It is a great pity , my dear , that your husband 's carelessness should deprive you of the benefit of Christian conversation ; but , to be sure , it is your duty to stay with him , and I hope it will be made up to you at home , "

10171	10180	10182	10183	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" My daughter is coming home , Nancy , "
10185	10221	10182	10183	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" You will have to make preparations for her immediately . So far as I can make out from this letter , she will arrive to - morrow by the half - past five train . "
10222	10227	10229	10229	Nancy	102	" Well , sir , "
10245	10344	10229	10229	Nancy	102	" it ai n't every young lady as would have the sense to fix an hour like that . Ladies is terrible tiresome in that way ; they 'll come in the middle o ' the day , when a body do n't know in the world what to have for them ; or they 'll come at night , when a body 's tired , and ai n't got the heart to go into a supper . There was always a deal of sense in Miss Lucilla , when she had n't got nothing in her head . "
10345	10349	10351	10352	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" Just so , "
10367	10396	10229	10229	Nancy	102	" You will see that her room is ready , and everything comfortable ; and , of course , to - morrow she and I will dine alone . "
10397	10402	10404	10404	Nancy	102	" Yes , sir , "
10474	10481	10483	10483	Nancy	102	" If you please , sir , "
10485	10571	10573	10573	Nancy	102	" not to give you no vexation nor trouble , which every one knows as it has been the aim o ' my life to spare you , as has so much on your mind . But it 's best to settle afore commencing , and then we need n't have no heartburning . If you please , am I to take my orders of Miss Lucilla , or of you , as I 've always been used to ? In the missus 's time , "
10579	10700	10702	10704	the domestic oracle	667	" as was a good missus , and never gave no trouble as long as she had her soup and her jelly comfortable , it was always you as said what there was to be for dinner . I do n't make no objection to doing up a nice little luncheon for Miss Lucilla , and giving a little more thought now and again to the sweets ; but it ai n't my part to tell you , sir , as a lady 's taste , and more special a young lady 's , ai n't to be expected to be the same as yours and mine as has been cultivated like . I 'm not one as likes contention , "
10706	10778	10702	10704	the domestic oracle	667	" but I could n't abear to see a good master put upon ; and if it should be as Miss Lucilla sets her mind upon messes as ai n't got no taste in them , and milk - puddings and stuff , like the most of the ladies , I 'd just like to know out of your own mouth , afore the commencement , what I 'm to do ? "
10802	10814	10815	10815	he	90	" It is to be hoped Miss Lucilla will know better , "
10818	10848	10815	10815	he	90	" She has a great deal of good sense , and it is to be hoped that she will be wise enough to consult the tastes of the house . "
10861	10874	10876	10876	Nancy	102	" As you say , sir , everything 's to be hoped , "
10879	10935	10876	10876	Nancy	102	" but there 's a - many ladies as do n't seem to me to have got no taste to their mouths ; and it ai n't as if it was a thing that could be left to hopes . Supposin ' as it comes to that , sir , what am I to do ? "
10936	10939	10941	10942	the Doctor	326	" Well , "
10951	10974	10941	10942	the Doctor	326	" you know Miss Lucilla is nineteen , Nancy , and my only child , and the natural mistress of the house . "
10975	10978	10980	10980	Nancy	102	" Sir , "
10983	11021	10980	10980	Nancy	102	" them is things as it ai n't needful to name ; that ai n't the question as I was asking . Supposin ' as things come to such a point , what am I to do ? "
11022	11033	11035	11036	the Doctor	326	" Bless me ! it 's half - past nine , "
11038	11064	11065	11065	he	326	" and I have an appointment . You can come just as usual when we are at breakfast , that will be the best way , "
11088	11100	11101	11101	he	326	" Lucilla is her mother 's daughter , it is true , "
11144	11154	11155	11155	he	326	" but she is my child all the same , "
12361	12371	12373	12377	the moderate and unexcited father	720	" Well , Lucilla ; so this is you ! "
12379	12388	12390	12391	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Yes , papa , it is me , "
12393	12401	12390	12391	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" and very glad to get home ; "
12440	12455	12456	12456	he	326	" Nancy is always very punctual , and I am sure you are hungry , "
12459	12477	12456	12456	he	326	" so I 'll go upstairs , with your permission , Lucilla , and change my coat ; "
12978	12990	12992	12993	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I am afraid I have taken your seat , papa , "
12999	13024	12992	12993	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" But then I should have had to move the urn , and all the things , and I thought you would not mind . "
13030	13033	13025	13026	The Doctor	326	" Humph ! "
13091	13110	13112	13113	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" It is so dreadful to think papa should have been bothered with all these things so long , "
13115	13179	13112	13113	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" After this I am sure you and I , Nancy , can arrange it all without giving him the trouble . Perhaps this morning , papa , as I am a stranger , you will say if there is anything you would like , and then I shall have time to talk it all over with Nancy , and find out what is best,"—and
13231	13237	13238	13238	he	326	" Very well , Lucilla , "
13241	13277	13238	13238	he	326	" you shall try what you can do . I daresay Nancy will be glad to have me back again before long ; but in the meantime I am quite content that you should try , "
13306	13313	13315	13316	the Doctor	326	" I forgot to tell you , "
13318	13359	13315	13316	the Doctor	326	" that Tom Marjoribanks is coming on Circuit , and that I have asked him to stay here , as a matter of course . I suppose he 'll arrive to - morrow . Good - bye till the evening . "
13388	13392	13393	13393	she	119	" Tom Marjoribanks ! "
13401	13414	13393	13393	she	119	" Of all people in the world , and at this moment ! "
13465	13471	13449	13449	She	119	" I sent papa away , "
13476	13589	13591	13591	Lucilla	119	" because I wanted to have a good talk with you , Nancy . I want to tell you my object in life . It is to be a comfort to papa . Ever since poor mamma died that is what I have been thinking of ; and now I have come home , and I have made up my mind that he is not to be troubled about anything . I know what a good , faithful , valuable woman you are , I assure you . You need not think me a foolish girl who is not able to appreciate you . The dinner was charming last night , Nancy , "
13597	13614	13591	13591	Lucilla	119	" and I never saw anything more beautifully cooked than papa 's cutlets to - day . "
13615	13632	13634	13634	Nancy	102	" Miss Lucilla , I may say as I am very glad I have pleased you , "
13658	13668	13670	13672	the prime minister	749	" Master is particular , I do n't deny , "
13679	13853	13670	13672	the prime minister	749	" I 've always done my best to go in with his little fancies , and I do n't mean to say as it is n't right and natural as you should be the missis . But I ai n't used to have ado with ladies , and that 's the truth . Ladies is stingy in a - many things as is the soul of a good dinner to them as knows . I may be valleyable or not , it ai n't for me to say ; but I 'm not one as can always be kept to a set figger in my gravy - beef , and my bacon , and them sorts of things . As for the butter , I do n't know as I could give nobody an idea . I ai n't one as likes changes , but I ca n't abide to be kept to a set figger ; and that 's the chief thing , Miss Lucilla , as I 've got to say . "
13854	13860	13862	13863	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" And quite reasonable too , "
13865	13958	13862	13863	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" you and I will work perfectly well together , Nancy . I am sure we have both the same meaning ; and I hope you do n't think I am less concerned about dear papa than about the gravy - beef . He must have been very desolate , with no one to talk to , though he has been so good and kind and self - sacrificing in leaving me to get every advantage ; but I mean to make it up to him , now I 've come home .

13959	13964	13966	13966	Nancy	102	" Yes , miss , "
13971	14053	14055	14055	Nancy	102	" not but what master has had his little parties now and again , to cheer him up a bit ; and I make bold to say , miss , as I have heard compliments , which it was Thomas that brought 'em downstairs , as might go nigh to turn a body 's head , if it was vanity as I was thinking of ; but I ai n't one as thinks of anything but the comfort of the family , "
14078	14109	14055	14055	Nancy	102	" and I 'm always one as does my best , Miss Lucilla , if I ai n't worried nor kept to a set figger with my gravy - beef . "
14110	14119	14121	14121	Lucilla	119	" I have heard of papa 's dinners , "
14124	14207	14209	14211	the new sovereign	750	" and I do n't mean to let down your reputation , Nancy . Now we are two women to manage everything , we ought to do still better . I have two or three things in my head that I will tell you after ; but in the meantime I want you to know that the object of my life is to be a comfort to poor papa ; and now let us think what we had better have for dinner , "

15310	15317	15318	15318	she	119	" Is Miss Lake at home ? "
15434	15439	15441	15441	Lucilla	119	" Is it Rose ? "
15499	15502	15504	15505	Miss Lake	118	" No , "
15591	15594	15596	15596	Lucilla	119	" Then , "
15616	15737	15596	15596	Lucilla	119	" it is Barbara — and that is a great deal better ; Rose is a good little thing , but — she is different , you know . It is so odd you should not remember me ; I thought everybody knew me in Carlingford . You know I have been a long time away , and now I have come home for good . Your voice is just the very thing to go with mine : was it not a lucky thing that I should have passed just at the right moment ? I do n't know how it is , but somehow these lucky chances always happen to me . I am Lucilla Marjoribanks , you know . "
15738	15741	15743	15743	Barbara	99	" Indeed ! "
15755	15765	15743	15743	Barbara	99	" I did not recognise you in the least . "
15766	15778	15780	15781	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Yes , I remember you were always shortsighted a little , "
15784	15879	15780	15781	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I should so like if we could try a duet . I have been having lessons in Italy , you know , and I am sure I could give you a few hints . I always like , when I can , to be of use . Tell me what songs you have that we could sing together . You know , my dear , it is not as if I was asking you for mere amusement to myself ; my grand object in life is to be a comfort to papa — — "
15880	15887	15889	15891	the uncivil Barbara	99	" Do you mean Dr Marjoribanks ? "
15893	15917	15889	15891	the uncivil Barbara	99	" I am sure he does not care in the least for music . I think you must be making a mistake — — "
15918	15923	15925	15925	Lucilla	119	" Oh , no , "
15927	16046	15925	15925	Lucilla	119	" I never make mistakes . I do n't mean to sing to him , you know ; but you are just the very person I wanted . As for the ridiculous idea some people have that nobody can be called on who does not live in Grange Lane , I assure you I mean to make an end of that . Of course I can not commence just all in a moment . But it would always be an advantage to practise a little together . I like to know exactly how far one can calculate upon everybody ; then one can tell , without fear of breaking down , just what one may venture to do . "
16047	16056	16058	16058	Barbara	99	" I do n't understand in the least , "
16067	16077	16058	16058	Barbara	99	" Perhaps you think I am a professional singer ? "
16078	16088	16090	16091	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" My dear , a professional singer spoils everything , "
16093	16157	16090	16091	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" it changes the character of an evening altogether . There are so few people who understand that . When you have professional singers , you have to give yourself up to music ; and that is not my view in the least . My great aim , as all my friends are aware , is to be a comfort to dear papa . "
16158	16168	16170	16170	Lucilla	119	" I wish you would not talk in riddles , "
16183	16204	16178	16178	her	806	" I suppose you really are Miss Marjoribanks . I have always heard that Miss Marjoribanks was a little — — "
16205	16208	16210	16210	Lucilla	119	" There ! "
16213	16291	16293	16294	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" really it is almost like a recitativo to hear you speak . I am so glad . What have you got there ? Oh , to be sure , it 's that duet out of the Trovatore . Do let us try it ; there is nobody here , and everything is so convenient — and you know it would never do to risk a breakdown . Will you play the accompaniment , or shall I ? "
16592	16604	16605	16605	she	88	" I do not want to tire you , you know , "
16608	16670	16672	16674	the bland Lucilla	119	" that will do for to - day . I told you your voice was the very thing to go with mine . Give my love to Rose when she comes in , but do n't bring her with you when you come to me . She is a good little thing — but then she is different , you know , "
17109	17111	17113	17113	she	120	" style "
17714	17724	17707	17707	himself	90	" in a person of her age and sex , "
17746	17750	17736	17736	her	119	" bad style . "
18353	18372	18373	18373	Lucilla	119	" If he had waited till things were organised , he might have been of a little use , "
18378	18429	18373	18373	Lucilla	119	" for at least he could have brought some of the men that come on circuit , and that would have made a little novelty ; but , of course , just now it would never do to make a rush at people , and invite them all at once . "
18482	18491	18492	18492	she	88	" Of course it is not his fault , "
18498	18522	18492	18492	she	88	" but it is astonishing how things happen with some men always at the wrong moment ; and it is so like Tom . "
18576	18594	18595	18597	the old lady	870	" My dear , you have grown ever so much since the last time I saw you , "
18604	18661	18595	18597	the old lady	870	" and stout with it , which is such a comfort with a tall girl ; and then your poor dear mamma was so delicate . I have always been a little anxious about you on that account , Lucilla ; and I am so glad , my dear , to see you looking so strong . "
18662	18667	18669	18670	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Dear Mrs Chiley , "
18691	18707	18686	18688	the old lady	870	" the great aim of my life is to be a comfort to dear papa . "
18767	18779	18781	18782	Mrs Chiley	96	" And one of them was a baronet , my dear , "
18983	19000	19002	19003	the mimic	883	" I am sure by her face she has been telling you about my niece Susan , "
19020	19091	19013	19013	her	96	" and that one of them was a baronet , my dear . I always know from her looks what she has been saying ; and ' the Colonel was much as usual , but suffering a little from the cold , as he always does in this climate . ' She must be a good soul , for she always has her favourite little speeches written in her face . "
19092	19101	19103	19104	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I am sure I do n't know , "
19117	19233	19235	19235	Lucilla	119	" there has always been one thing remarked of me all my life , that I never have had a great sense of humour . I know it is singular , but when one has a defect , it is always so much better to confess it . I always get on very well with anything else , but I never had any sense of humour , you know ; and I am very fond of Mrs Chiley . She has always had a fancy for me from the time I was born ; and she has such nice manners . But then , it is so odd I should have no sense of humour , "
19252	19262	19240	19241	Mrs Centum	98	" Do n't you think it is very odd ? "
19263	19272	19274	19275	Mrs Centum	98	" I am sure it is very nice , "
19277	19328	19274	19275	Mrs Centum	98	" I hate people that laugh at everything . I do n't see much to laugh at myself , I am sure , in this distracting world ; any one who has a lot of children and servants like me to look after , finds very little to laugh at . "
19667	19718	19720	19721	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Tell Nancy not to put herself about , but to send up something cold — the cold pie , or anything she can find handy . Tell her I am so vexed , but it is just like Mr Tom ; and he never knows what he is eating , "
19740	19786	19737	19737	She	102	" I 'll thank Miss Lucilla to mind her own business . The cold pie is for master 's breakfast . I ai n't such a goose as not to know what to send upstairs , and that Tummas can tell her if he likes . "
20081	20094	20095	20095	he	117	" I do n't think I ever saw you looking so well , "
20099	20110	20095	20095	he	117	" and you know my opinion generally on that subject . "
20129	20133	20134	20134	she	119	" What subject ? "
20137	20205	20206	20206	Lucilla	119	" my looks ? I am sure they ca n't be interesting to you . You are as hungry as ever you can be , and I can see it in your eyes . Papa , he is famishing , and I do n't think he can contain himself any longer . Do take him downstairs , and let him have something to eat . For myself , "
20214	20242	20206	20206	Lucilla	119	" it is my duty that keeps me up . You know it has always been the object of my life to be a comfort to papa . "
20243	20249	20251	20252	the Doctor	326	" Come along , Tom , "
20254	20267	20251	20252	the Doctor	326	" Do n't waste your time philandering when your supper is ready . "
20398	20403	20377	20378	the Doctor	326	" keep him company , "
20863	20871	20873	20873	her	119	" What were you doing , Lucilla ? "
20874	20895	20873	20873	her	119	father,—"rehearsing Lady Macbeth , I suppose . At least you looked exactly like it when we came into the room . "
20896	20901	20903	20903	Lucilla	119	" No , papa , "
20906	21008	21010	21011	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I was only measuring to see how much carpet we should want ; and that , you know , and Tom 's coming , made me think of old times . You are so much downstairs in the library that you do n't feel it ; but a lady has to spend her life in the drawing - room — and then I always was so domestic . It does not matter what is outside , I always find my pleasure at home . I can not help if it has a little effect on my spirits now and then , "
21019	21032	21010	21011	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" to be always surrounded with things that have such associations — — "
21033	21037	21039	21041	the amazed Doctor	942	" What associations ? "
21091	21104	21269	21270	Tom Marjoribanks	117	" Really , Lucilla , I do n't know what you mean . "
21105	21110	21112	21113	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" No , papa , "
21118	21208	21210	21210	Lucilla	119	" I know you do n't , and that is what makes it so sad . But talking of new carpets , you know , I had such an adventure to - day that I must tell you — quite one of my adventures — the very luckiest thing . It happened when I was out walking ; I heard a voice out of a house in Grove Street , just the very thing to go with my voice . That is not a thing that happens every day , "
21212	21255	21210	21210	Lucilla	119	" for all the masters have always told me that my voice was something quite by itself . When I heard it , though it was in Grove Street , and all the people about , I could have danced for joy . "
21256	21267	21269	21270	Tom Marjoribanks	117	" It was a man 's voice , I suppose , "
21286	21317	21319	21320	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" It 's a wonderful advantage to be so pleased about trifles . What number was it ? For my part , I have not many patients in Grove Street , "
21322	21340	21319	21320	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" I would find a voice to suit you in another quarter , if I were you . "
21341	21356	21358	21358	Lucilla	119	" Dear papa , it 's such a pity that you do n't understand , "
21361	21396	21358	21358	Lucilla	119	" It turned out to be Barbara Lake ; for , of course , I went in directly , and found out . I never heard a voice that went so well with mine . "
21461	21465	21467	21468	the Doctor	326	" Barbara Lake ? "
21470	21520	21467	21468	the Doctor	326	" There 's something in that . If you can do her any good or get her teaching or anything — I have a regard for poor Lake , poor little fellow ! He 's kept up wonderfully since his wife died ; and nobody expected it of him , "
21574	21577	21579	21579	Lucilla	119	" Yes , "
21581	21620	21579	21579	Lucilla	119	" I mean her to come here and sing with me ; but , then , one needs to organise a little first . I am nineteen — how long is it since you were married , papa ? "
21621	21629	21631	21632	the Doctor	326	" Two - and - twenty years , "
21730	21738	21740	21740	Lucilla	119	" Two - and - twenty years ! "
21742	21892	21894	21895	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I do n't mind talking before Tom , for he is one of the family . The things are all the same as they were when mamma came home , though , I am sure , nobody would believe it . I think it is going against Providence , for my part . Nothing was ever intended to last so long , except the things the Jews , poor souls ! wore in the desert , perhaps . Papa , if you have no objection , I should like to choose the colours myself . There is a great deal in choosing colours that go well with one 's complexion . People think of that for their dresses , but not for their rooms , which are of so much more importance . I should have liked blue , but blue gets so soon tawdry . I think , "
21907	21923	21901	21901	herself	88	" that I have enough complexion at present to venture upon a pale spring green . "
22020	22022	22010	22011	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" talent "
22184	22193	22195	22196	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" For one can change one 's dress , "
22198	22375	22195	22196	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" as often as one likes — at least as often , you know , as one has dresses to change ; but the furniture remains the same . I am always a perfect guy , whatever I wear , when I sit against a red curtain . You men say that a woman always knows when she 's good - looking , but I am happy to say I know when I look a guy . What I mean is a delicate pale green , papa . For my part , I think it wears just as well as any other colour ; and all the painters say it is the very thing for pictures . The carpet , of course , would be a darker shade ; and as for the chairs , it is not at all necessary to keep to one colour . Both red and violet go beautifully with green , you know . I am sure Mr Holden and I could settle all about it without giving you any trouble . "
22376	22383	22385	22386	the Doctor	326	" Who told you , Lucilla , "
22388	22397	22398	22398	He	326	" that I meant to refurnish the house ? "
22445	22464	22466	22467	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" I never heard that was a sort of thing a man had to do for his daughter , "
22469	22506	22466	22467	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" and I would like to know what I should do with all that finery when you get married — as I suppose you will by and by — and leave me alone in the house ? "
22507	22516	22518	22518	Tom	117	" Ah , that is the important question , "
22556	22564	22566	22567	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Perhaps I may marry some time , "
22572	22706	22566	22567	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" it would be foolish , you know , to make any engagements ; but that will depend greatly upon how you behave , and how Carlingford behaves , papa . I give myself ten years here , if you should be very good . By twenty - nine I shall be going off a little , and perhaps it may be tiring , for anything I can tell . Ten years is a long time , and naturally , in the meantime , I want to look as well as possible . Stop a minute ; I forgot to put down the number of paces for the length . Tom , please to do it over again for me ; of course , your steps are a great deal longer than mine . "
22707	22712	22714	22715	the Doctor	326	" Tom is tired , "
22717	22757	22714	22715	the Doctor	326	" and there are no new carpets coming out of my pockets . Besides , he 's going to bed , and I 'm going downstairs to the library . We may as well bid you good - night . "
23169	23178	23180	23180	Lucilla	119	" I never said you were to stride , "
23182	23225	23227	23228	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" take moderate steps , and do n't be so silly . I was doing it myself famously if you had not come in and interrupted me . It is frightful to belong to a family where the men are so stupid , "
23326	23334	23335	23335	she	119	" It is what he always does , "
23377	23395	23397	23398	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" I can tell you the size of the room , if that is all you want , "
23400	23438	23397	23398	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" I suppose you mean to give parties , and drive me out of my senses with dancing and singing.—No , Lucilla , you must wait till you get married — that will never do for me . "
23439	23443	23445	23445	Lucilla	119	" Dear papa , "
23448	23500	23502	23503	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" it is so dreadful to hear you say parties . Everybody knows that the only thing I care for in life is to be a comfort to you ; and as for dancing , I saw at once that was out of the question . Dancing is all very well , "
23506	23592	23594	23594	Lucilla	119	" but it implies quantities of young people — and young people can never make what I call society . It is Evenings I mean to have , papa . I am sure you want to go downstairs , and I suppose Tom would think it civil to sit with me , though he is tired ; so I will show you a good example , and Thomas can pick up the table and the flowers at his leisure . Good - night , papa , "
23681	23694	23696	23697	Miss Marjoribanks;—perhaps	128	" If you only would look a little where you are going , "
23763	23774	23779	23779	himself	326	" She knows how to put him down at least , "
23846	23856	23858	23859	the Doctor	326	" So it is Evenings she means to have ? "
24046	24061	24063	24063	Lucilla	119	" I shall go down and ask Mrs Chiley to come with the Colonel , "
24065	24110	24063	24063	Lucilla	119	" I have always meant to do that . We ca n't have a full dinner - party , you know , as long as the house is so shabby ; but I am sure Mrs Chiley will come to take care of me . "
24111	24129	24131	24132	the Doctor	326	" To take care of you!—in your father 's house ! Do you think they 'll bite ? "
24147	24157	24158	24158	she	119	" I must have a chaperone , you know , "
24161	24203	24205	24207	the experienced Lucilla	119	" I do n't say it is not quite absurd ; but then , at first , I always make it a point to give in to the prejudices of society . That is how I have always been so successful , "
24209	24232	24205	24207	the experienced Lucilla	119	" I never went in the face of anybody 's prejudices . Afterwards , you know , when one is known — — "
24593	24598	24604	24604	her	88	" Do go away , "
24608	24682	24684	24684	Lucilla	119	" You can come back to luncheon if you like;—that is to say , if you can pick up anybody that is very amusing , you may bring him here about half - past one , and if any of my friends have come to call by that time , I will give you lunch ; but it must be somebody very amusing , or I will have nothing to say to you , "
24834	24837	24810	24810	she	119	" go off "
24966	24981	24982	24984	the old lady	870	" But , my dear , you must tell me what to put on , "
24987	25072	24982	24984	the old lady	870	" I do n't think I have had anything new since you were home last . I have heard so much about Dr Marjoribanks 's dinners that I feel a little excited , as if I was going to be made a freemason or something . There is my brown , you know , that I wear at home when we have anybody — and my black velvet ; and then there is my French gray that I got for Mary Chiley 's marriage . "
25073	25078	25080	25080	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley , "
25082	25122	25080	25080	Lucilla	119	" it does n't matter in the least what you wear ; there are only to be gentlemen , you know , and one never dresses for gentlemen . You must keep that beautiful black velvet for another time . "
25123	25129	25131	25132	Mrs Chiley	96	" Well , my dear , "
25134	25161	25131	25132	Mrs Chiley	96	" I am long past that sort of thing — but the men think , you know , that it is always for them we dress . "
25162	25165	25167	25168	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Yes , "
25170	25201	25203	25203	Lucilla	119	" their vanity is something dreadful — but it is one of my principles never to dress unless there are ladies . A white frock , high in the neck , "
25207	25218	25203	25203	Lucilla	119	simplicity—"as for anything else , it would be bad style . "
25234	25240	25242	25244	the old lady	870	" The sense she has ! "
25266	25269	25275	25275	She	870	" The Gentlemen "
25340	25360	25362	25365	the penitent old lady	1029	" I dare say Lucilla does not spend so much time on such vanity , and she only nineteen , "
25462	25482	25442	25442	she	88	" If you are honest and want to work , I will try to find you something to do , "
25621	25630	25631	25631	Lucilla	119	" It is just the tint I want , "
26256	26259	26255	26266	the " somebody amusing " whom Lucilla had commissioned him to bring	1048	" somebody amusing "
26359	26374	26376	26378	the amusing man	1053	" I think they are going to hang that fellow that killed the tailor , "
26380	26495	26376	26378	the amusing man	1053	" that will stir you up a little in Carlingford , I should suppose . It is as good as a play for a country town . Of course , there will be a party that will get up a memorial , and prove that a man so kind - hearted never existed out of paradise ; and there will be another party who will prove him to be insane ; and then at the end all the blackguards within a hundred miles will crowd into Carlingford , and the fellow will be hanged , as he deserves to be ; but I assure you it 's a famous amusement for a country town . "
26496	26499	26501	26502	Miss Bury	114	" Sir , "
26516	26537	26510	26510	her	114	" when you speak of amusement , does it ever occur to you what will become of his miserable soul ? "
26538	26551	26553	26555	the young barrister	1054	" I assure you , wretches of that description have no souls , "
26557	26592	26553	26555	the young barrister	1054	" or else , of course , I would not permit myself to speak so freely . It is a conclusion I have come to not rashly , but after many opportunities of observing , "
26601	26642	26593	26595	the young man	890	" on the whole , my opinion is , that this is the great difference between one portion of mankind and the other : that description of being , you may take my word for it , has no soul . "
26643	26661	26663	26664	Miss Bury	114	" I never take anybody 's word for what is so plainly stated in the Holy Scriptures , "
26666	26692	26694	26695	the Rector	567	" I never heard any one utter such a terrible idea . I am sure I do n't want to defend a — a murderer , "
26702	26749	26751	26752	Miss Bury	114	" but I have heard of persons in that unfortunate position coming to a heavenly frame of mind , and giving every evidence of being truly converted . The law may take their lives , but it is an awful thing — a truly dreadful thing , "
26758	26767	26751	26752	Miss Bury	114	" to try to take away their soul . "
26768	26787	26789	26789	Tom	117	" Oh , nonsense , Lucilla . By Jove ! he does not mean that , you know , "
26797	26808	26810	26811	Miss Bury	114	" Do you believe in Jove , Mr Thomas Marjoribanks , "
26842	26855	26856	26856	he	1058	" No , Miss Bury , I ca n't say I do , "
26966	26986	26988	26988	Lucilla	119	" It is dreadful sometimes to see what straits people are put to , to keep up the conversation , "
26990	27091	27093	27093	Lucilla	119	" Tom in particular , for I think he has a pleasure in talking nonsense . But you must not suppose I am of that opinion . I remember quite well there was a dreadful man once here in jail for something , and Mr Bury made him the most beautiful character ! Every creature has a soul . I am sure we say so in the Creed every day of our lives , and especially in that long creed where so many people perish everlastingly . So far from laughing , it is quite dreadful to think of it , "
27095	27154	26962	26962	her	119	" It is one of my principles never to laugh about anything that has to do with religion . I always think it my duty to speak with respect . It has such a bad effect upon some minds . Miss Bury , if you will not take anything more , I think we had better go upstairs . "
27334	27338	27340	27341	Miss Bury	114	" Poor dear , "
27343	27412	27340	27341	Miss Bury	114	" it is dreadful indeed if this is the sort of society you are subjected to . I could recommend to Dr Marjoribanks a most admirable woman , a true Christian , who would take charge of things and be your companion , Lucilla . It is not at all nice for you , at your age , to be obliged to receive young men like these alone . "
27413	27418	27420	27420	Lucilla	119	" I had you ! "
27429	27494	27420	27420	Lucilla	119	" I felt it was such a blessing . I would not have let Tom stay for luncheon if you had not been there ; and now I am so glad , because it has shown me the danger of letting him bring people . I am quite sure it was a special providence that made you think of coming here to - day . "
27495	27501	27503	27504	Miss Bury	114	" Well , my dear , "
27517	27598	27503	27504	Miss Bury	114	" I am very glad to have been of use to you . If there is anything I desire in this life , it is to be useful to my fellow - creatures , and to do my work while it is called day . I should not think the time lost , my dear Lucilla , if I could only hope that I had impressed upon your mind that an account must be given of every careless word — — "
27599	27604	27606	27606	Lucilla	119	" Oh , yes , "
27608	27657	27606	27606	Lucilla	119	" that is so true ; and besides , it is quite against my principles . I make it a point never to speak of anything about religion except with the greatest respect ; and I am quite sure it was a special providence that I had you . "
28064	28109	28110	28110	she	96	" My dear Lucilla , I feel exactly as if I was going to be made a freemason ; and as if your dear good papa had to blindfold me , and make me swear all sorts of things before he took me downstairs , "
28160	28164	28166	28167	the Colonel	595	" My love , "
28171	28243	28245	28246	Mrs Chiley	96	" I never realised before what it was to have a genius . You should be very thankful to Providence for giving you such a gift . I have given dinners all my life — that is , all my married life , my dear , which comes to almost the same thing , for I was only a baby — but I never could come up to anything like that , "
28277	28288	28289	28289	she	96	" I am sure you always give very nice dinners , "
28292	28402	28289	28289	she	96	" and then , you know , the Colonel has his favourite dishes — whereas , I must say for papa , he is very reasonable for a man . I am so glad you are pleased . It is very kind of you to say it is genius , but I do n't pretend to anything but paying great attention and studying the combinations . There is nothing one can not manage if one only takes the trouble . Come here to this nice easy - chair — it is so comfortable . It is so nice to have a little moment to ourselves before they come upstairs . "
28403	28411	28413	28414	Mrs Chiley	96	" That is what I always say , "
28416	28460	28413	28414	Mrs Chiley	96	" but there are not many girls so sensible as you , Lucilla . I hear them all saying it is so much better French fashion . Of course , I am an old woman , and like things in the old style . "
28461	28474	28476	28477	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I do n't think it is because I am more sensible , "
28482	28524	28525	28525	Lucilla	119	" I do n't pretend to be better than other people . It is because I have thought it all over , you know — and then I went through a course of political economy when I was at Mount Pleasant , "
28545	28617	28525	28525	Lucilla	119	" But for all that , something dreadful happened to - day . Tom brought in one of his friends with him , you know , and Miss Bury was here , and they talked — I want to tell you , in case she should say something , and then you will know what to believe . I never felt so dreadfully ashamed in my life — they talked — — "
28618	28629	28631	28633	the old lady	870	" My dear ! not anything improper , I hope , "
28638	28643	28645	28645	Lucilla	119	" Oh , no , "
28647	28691	28645	28645	Lucilla	119	" but they began laughing about some people having no souls , you know — as if there could be anybody without a soul — and poor Miss Bury nearly fainted . You may think what a dreadful thing it was for me . "
28692	28702	28704	28705	Mrs Chiley	96	" My dear child , if that was all , "
28707	28778	28779	28781	the old lady	870	reassured—"as for everybody having a soul , I am sure I can not say . You never were in India , to be sure ; but Miss Bury should have known better than to faint at a young man 's talk , and frighten you , my poor dear . She ought to be ashamed of herself , at her age . Do you think Tom has turned out clever ? "
28798	28805	28807	28808	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Not in the very least , "
28811	28867	28807	28808	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" he is just as awkward as he used to be . It is dreadful to have him here just now , when I have so many things to do — and then he would follow me about everywhere if I would let him . A cousin of that sort is always in the way . "
28868	28881	28883	28884	Mrs Chiley	96	" I am always afraid of a cousin , for my part , "
28886	28947	28883	28884	Mrs Chiley	96	" and talking of that , what do you think of Mr Cavendish , Lucilla ? He is very nice in himself , and he has a nice property ; and some people say he has a very good chance to be member for Carlingford when there is an election . I think that is just what would suit you . "
28948	28958	28960	28960	Lucilla	119	" I could not see him for the lamp , "
28962	29003	28960	28960	Lucilla	119	" it was right between us , you know — but it is no use talking of that sort of thing just now . Of course , if I had liked , I never need have come home at all , "
29011	29045	29004	29005	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" and , now I have come home , I have got other things to think of . If papa is good , I will not think of leaving him for ten years . "
29046	29059	29061	29062	Mrs Chiley	96	" Oh , yes ; I have heard girls say that before , "
29064	29090	29061	29062	Mrs Chiley	96	" but they always changed their minds . You would not like to be an old maid , Lucilla ; and in ten years — — "
29091	29105	29107	29108	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I should have begun to go off a little , no doubt , "
29110	29145	29147	29147	Lucilla	119	" No , I ca n't say I wish to be an old maid . Can they be coming upstairs already , do you think ? Oh , it is Tom , I suppose , "
29343	29352	29353	29353	she	119	" I only sang it to amuse you , "
29415	29434	29435	29436	Mr Cavendish	115	" I hope next time you will be more charitable , and not tantalise us in this way , "
29542	29555	29556	29557	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" for people can stand a man being sceptical , you know , "
29561	29583	29556	29557	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" but everybody knows how unbecoming it is in a woman — and me who have such a respect for religion ! "
30154	30156	30159	30171	the accompanying mute in black , whose office the culprit could not divine	1118	" faithful "
30279	30289	30290	30290	Lucilla	119	" It is so good of you to come , "
30293	30322	30290	30290	Lucilla	119	" you that have so much to do . I scarcely could believe it when I saw you come in : I thought it must be for papa . "
30323	30332	30334	30335	the Rector	567	" I did hope to find Dr Marjoribanks , "
30337	30360	30362	30363	Mr Bury	109	" but as he is not at home , I thought it best to come to you . This is Mrs Mortimer , "
30478	30481	30486	30489	the figure in black	1130	" good . "
30564	30573	30575	30576	Mr Bury	109	" My sister told me what happened yesterday , "
30578	30697	30575	30576	Mr Bury	109	" She is very sorry for you , Miss Marjoribanks . It is sad for you to be left alone so young , and without a mother , and exposed to — to temptations which it is difficult to withstand at your age . Indeed , at all ages , we have great occasion to pray not to be led into temptation ; for the heart of man is terribly deceitful . After hearing what she had to say , I thought it best to come up at once this morning and talk to Dr Marjoribanks . I am sure his natural good sense will teach him that you ought not to be left alone in the house . "
30698	30709	30711	30711	Lucilla	119	" I do not see how papa can help it , "
30713	30755	30711	30711	Lucilla	119	" I am sure it is very sad for him as well ; but since dear mamma died there has been nobody but me to be a comfort to him . I think he begins to look a little cheerful now , "
30771	30788	30756	30757	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Everybody knows that to be a comfort to him is the object of my life . "
30789	30797	30799	30800	the Rector	567	" That is a very good feeling , "
30802	30891	30799	30800	the Rector	567	" but it does not do to depend too much upon our feelings . You are too young to be placed in a position of so much responsibility , and open to so much temptation . I was deeply grieved for Dr Marjoribanks when his partner in life was taken from him ; but my dear Miss Lucilla , now you have come home , who stand so much in need of a mother 's care , we must try to find some one to fill her place . "
30953	30967	30968	30968	she	119	" Do you mean you have found some one for him to marry ? "
31007	31016	31017	31017	he	567	" Of course not , of course not , "
31141	31156	31158	31158	Lucilla	119	" It is very dreadful for me that am so young to go against you "
31160	31225	31227	31228	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" but if it is that , I can not be expected to take any part in it — it would not be natural . It is the great object of my life to be a comfort to papa ; but if that is what you mean , I could not give in to it . I am sure Miss Bury would understand me , "
31252	31268	31270	31271	Mr Bury	109	" Nothing of the kind , my dear Miss Lucilla — nothing of the kind , "
31273	31313	31270	31271	Mr Bury	109	" such an idea never came into my mind . I can not imagine how I could have said anything — I ca n't fancy what put such an idea —— Mrs Mortimer , you are not going away ? "
31383	31397	31398	31398	she	948	" I had better go — I am sure I had better go , "
31421	31438	31398	31398	she	948	" Miss Marjoribanks will understand you better , and you will perhaps understand Miss Marjoribanks — — "
31439	31448	31450	31451	Mr Bury	109	" Oh , sit down , sit down , "
31460	31625	31627	31628	the Rector	567	" Perhaps I expressed myself badly . What I meant to say was , that Mrs Mortimer , who has been a little unfortunate in circumstances — sit down , pray — had by a singular providence just applied to me when my sister returned home yesterday . These things do not happen by chance , Lucilla . We are taken care of when we are not thinking of it . Mrs Mortimer is a Christian lady for whom I have the greatest respect . A situation to take the superintendence of the domestic affairs , and to have charge of you , would be just what would suit her . It must be a great anxiety to the Doctor to leave you alone , and without any control , at your age . You may think the liberty is pleasant at first , but if you had a Christian friend to watch over and take care of you —— What is the matter ? "
31818	31826	31812	31813	the Rector	567	" She will be all right directly , "
31832	31880	31812	31813	the Rector	567	" luckily she never went right off . When you do n't go right off , lying down is everything . If there had been any one to run and get some water she would have got over it ; but luckily I saw it in time . "
32069	32078	32085	32085	she	88	" I do n't think she is strong , "
32096	32140	32142	32142	Lucilla	119	" her colour changes so ; she never would be able for what there is to do here , even if papa would consent to think of it . For my part I am sure I should be glad of a little assistance , "
32144	32199	32201	32202	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" but I never like to give false hopes , and I do n't think papa would consent;—she looks nice if she was not so weak , poor thing!—and there are such quantities of things to be done here : but if you wish it , Mr Bury , I will speak to papa , "
32278	32294	32295	32295	he	567	" Yes , I should be glad if you would mention it to Dr Marjoribanks , "
32363	32371	32373	32373	Lucilla	119	" Please , leave her a little , "
32375	32426	32373	32373	Lucilla	119	" and I can make acquaintance with her , you know , in case papa should be disposed to think of it;—she must lie still till it quite wears off . I would ask you to stay to lunch if I was not afraid of wasting your precious time — — "
32538	32543	32535	32536	Mr Bury	109	" like them all , "
32678	32687	32688	32689	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I knew it would hurt your feelings , "
32693	32727	32688	32689	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" but I could not do anything else — and you know it was Mr Bury 's fault ; but I am sure if I can be of any use to you — — "
33127	33137	33138	33138	she	119	" He can not help it , you know , "
33146	33158	33138	33138	she	119	" I suppose some people are born to do ridiculous things . "
33612	33619	33620	33620	she	119	" Ring , please , Tom , "
33623	33678	33620	33620	she	119	" I want to know if they have finished upstairs . I am so sorry you are going away ; but you know it is one of my principles never to neglect my duty . I am sure they must be waiting for me — if you would only be kind enough to ring . "
33679	33682	33684	33684	Tom	117	" Lucilla , "
33686	33731	33733	33735	the young man	890	" you know I would do anything in the world you liked to tell me ; but do n't ask me to ring just now : I am going to leave you , and there is something I must say to you , Lucilla , "
33848	33851	33852	33852	she	88	" Yes , "
33868	33904	33906	33909	the designing young woman	1202	" I am sure I am very sorry ; but then , you know , with the house in such a condition ! Next time you come I shall be able to enjoy your society , "
33911	33974	33906	33909	the designing young woman	1202	" but at present I am so busy . It is one of my principles , you know , that things are never rightly done if the lady of the house does not pay proper attention . They are sure to make some dreadful mistake upstairs if I do n't look after them . I shall see you again before you go . "
33975	33984	33991	33991	he	117	" Lucilla , do n't be so cruel ! "
34002	34030	34032	34034	the unfortunate lover	1205	" do stop a moment and listen to me . Lucilla ! what does it matter about furniture and things when a man 's heart is bursting ? "
34090	34101	34103	34103	Lucilla	119	" What in the world can you have been doing ? "
34106	34183	34103	34103	Lucilla	119	" you used always to tell me , you know , when you got into any difficulty , and I am sure if I can be of any use to you , Tom —— But as for furniture and things , they matter a great deal , I assure you , to people 's happiness ; and then , you know , it is the object of my life to be a comfort to dear papa . "
34270	34280	34281	34281	he	117	" I know how good you are , Lucilla , "
34287	34325	34281	34281	he	117	" but then my uncle , you know — I do n't think he is a man to appreciate —— Oh , Lucilla ! why should you go and sacrifice to him the happiness of your life ? "
34326	34329	34331	34332	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Tom , "
34338	34407	34409	34411	the devoted daughter	324	" I wish you would not talk to me of happiness . I have always been brought up to believe that duty was happiness ; and everybody has known for a long time what was the object of my life . As for poor papa , it is the worse for him if he does not understand ; but that does not make any difference to my duty , "
34477	34483	34472	34472	she	119	" saying the very words , "
34499	34521	34523	34523	Tom	117	" Lucilla , when you are so good to my uncle , you ought to have a little pity on me , "
34531	34566	34568	34571	the unfortunate young man	1211	" How do you think I can bear it , to see you getting everything done here , as if you meant to stay all your life — when you know I love you ? "
34573	34613	34568	34571	the unfortunate young man	1211	" when you know I have always been so fond of you , Lucilla , and always looked forward to the time — — ; and now it is very hard to see you care so little for me . "
34614	34617	34619	34620	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Tom , "
34626	34724	34726	34726	Lucilla	119	" how can you say I care little for you ? you know I was always very fond of you , on the contrary . I am sure I always stood your friend at home , whatever happened , and never said a word when you broke that pretty little pearl ring I was so fond of , and tore the scarf that my aunt gave me . I wonder , for my part , how you can be so unkind as so say so . We have always been the very best friends in the world , "
34734	34760	34726	34726	Lucilla	119	" I always said at school I liked you the best of all my cousins ; and I am very fond of all my cousins . "
34770	34786	34761	34762	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" It is so unkind to tell me that I do n't care for you . "
34984	34995	34997	34997	Lucilla	119	" I have always been like a sister to you , "
34999	35014	34997	34997	Lucilla	119	" how can you be so unkind as to say I do n't care ? "
35051	35065	35066	35066	he	105	" You know very well that is not what I mean , Lucilla , "
35070	35116	35066	35066	he	105	" It is you who are unkind . I do n't know why it is that ladies are so cruel ; I am not such a snob as to persecute anybody . But what is the good of pretending not to know what I mean ? "
35117	35122	35124	35125	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Tom , listen ! "
35132	35184	35124	35125	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I feel sure they must have finished . There is Mr Holden going through the garden . And everybody knows that hanging pictures is just the thing of all others that requires a person of taste . If they have spoiled the room , it will be all your fault . "
35185	35197	35199	35199	Tom	105	" Oh , for Heaven 's sake never mind the room ! "
35201	35234	35236	35237	the lover	1214	" I never thought you would have trifled with a man , Lucilla . You know quite well what I mean ; you know it is n't a — a new thing , "
35246	35291	35236	35237	the lover	1214	" You know that is what I have been thinking of all along , as soon as ever I had anything to live on . I love you , Lucilla ; you know I love you ! how can you trifle with me so ? "
35292	35300	35302	35303	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" It is you who are trifling , "
35305	35346	35348	35348	Lucilla	119	" especially when you know I have really something of importance to do . You can come upstairs with me if you like . Of course we all love each other . What is the good of being relations otherwise ? "
35351	35406	35348	35348	Lucilla	119	" it is such a natural thing , you know . I suppose it is because you are going away that you are so affectionate to - day . It is very nice of you , I am sure ; but , Tom , I feel quite certain you have not packed your things , "
35416	35423	35407	35408	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Come along with me upstairs . "
35516	35521	35522	35522	himself	105	" worked himself up to it"—set
35535	35538	35540	35542	the unlucky fellow	1192	" Lucilla , "
35544	35659	35540	35542	the unlucky fellow	1192	" is it possible that you really have misunderstood me all this time ? Do you mean to say that you do n't know ? Oh , Lucilla , listen just five minutes . It is n't because I am your cousin . I wish to Heaven I was not your cousin , but some one you had never seen before . I mean I want you to consent to — to — to — marry me , Lucilla . That is what I mean . I am called to the bar , and I can work for you , and make a reputation . Lucilla , listen to what I have to say . "
35692	35703	35704	35704	she	88	" Have you gone out of your senses , Tom ? "
35745	35758	35760	35760	Lucilla	119	" If you have any feeling as if fever was coming on , "
35762	35806	35760	35760	Lucilla	119	" I think you should go upstairs and lie down a little till papa comes in . I heard there had been some cases down about the canal . I hope it is not the assizes that have been too much for you . "
35888	35899	35901	35903	the young man	890	" You are trying to drive me mad , Lucilla ! "
35905	35960	35962	35962	Tom	105	" I have got no fever . It is only you who are driving me out of my senses . This time you must hear me . I will not let you go till you have given me an answer . I am called to the bar , and I have begun my Career , "
35970	36035	36037	36037	Tom	105	" I knew you would have laughed at me when I was depending on my mother ; but now all that is over , Lucilla . I have loved you as long as I can remember ; and I always thought — that you — cared for me a little . If you will have me , there is nothing I could not do , "
36047	36080	36037	36037	Tom	105	" and if you will not have me , I will not answer for the consequences . If I go off to India , or if I go to the bad — — "
36081	36084	36086	36086	Lucilla	119	" Tom , "
36098	36148	36154	36154	her	88	" if you ever want to get married , I think the very best thing you can do is to go to India . As for marrying just now at your age , you know you might as well jump into the sea . You need not be vexed , "
36158	36272	36154	36154	her	88	" I would not speak so if I was not your best friend . As for marrying me , you know it is ridiculous . I have not the least intention of marrying anybody . If I had thought of that , I need never have come home at all . As for your going to the bad , I am not afraid of that . If I were to let you carry on with such a ridiculous idea , I should never forgive myself . It would be just as sensible to go into a lunatic asylum at once . It is very lucky for you that you said this to me , "
36277	36367	36273	36273	Lucilla	119	" and not to one of the girls that think it great fun to be married . And if I were you , Tom , I would go and pack my things . You know you are always too late ; and do n't jump on your portmanteau and make such a dreadful noise if it wo n't shut , but ring the bell for Thomas . You know we are to dine at half - past five to - day , to give you time for the train . "
36477	36480	36431	36431	she	88	" match . "
36609	36621	36622	36622	Lucilla	119	" But , after all , everything is for the best , "
36982	36995	36997	36999	the exasperated mother	1250	" It is all very well to make pretty pictures about Christmas , "
37001	37123	37124	37124	she	1250	" but I should like to know how one can enjoy anything with such a commotion going on . I get up every morning with a headache , I assure you ; and then Mr Centum expects me to be cheerful when he comes in to dinner ; men are so unreasonable . I should like to know what they would do if they had what we have to go through : to look after all the servants — and they are always out of their senses at Christmas — and to see that the children do n't have too much pudding , and to support all the noise . The holidays are the hardest work a poor woman can have , "
37223	37226	37240	37242	Low - Church	1256	" took off "
37465	37493	37494	37496	the old lady	870	" I mean to work her a footstool in water - lilies , my dear , like the one I did for you when you were married , "
37512	37523	37494	37496	the old lady	870	" My opinion is that it must be in crimson , "
37533	37599	37529	37529	she	99	" for I know your aunt 's water - lilies . When I see them growing , I always think of you . It would be quite like Lucilla Marjoribanks to have it in crimson — for it is a cheerful colour , you know , and quite different from the old furniture ; and that would always be a comfort to her dear papa . "
37688	37699	37701	37702	Miss Brown	138	" I think it is blue , for my part , "
37725	37744	37701	37702	Miss Brown	138	" Lucilla was always a great one for blue ; she thinks it is becoming to her complexion ; "
37780	37792	37793	37793	she	88	" For my part , I am fond of neutral tints , "
37805	37869	37871	37871	Lucilla	119	" anybody who knows me can easily guess my taste . I should have been born a Quaker , you know , I do so like the drabs and grays , and all those soft colours . You can have as much red and green as you like abroad , where the sun is strong , but here it would be bad style , "
37910	37918	37919	37920	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Do n't expect any regular invitation , "
37923	38006	38008	38008	Lucilla	119	" I hope you will all come , or as many of you as can . Papa has always some men to dinner with him that day , you know , and it is so dreadfully slow for me with a heap of men . That is why I fixed on Thursday . I want you to come every week , so it would be absurd to send an invitation ; and remember it is not a party , only an Evening , "
38010	38030	38008	38008	Lucilla	119	" I shall wear a white frock high , as I always do . Now be sure you come . "
38031	38043	38045	38046	Mrs Chiley	96	" But we ca n't all go in high white frocks , "
38105	38115	38117	38118	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" But , my dear , you are married , "
38120	38164	38117	38118	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" that makes it quite different : come in that pretty pink that is so becoming . I do n't want to have any dowdies , for my part ; and do n't forget that I shall expect you all at nine o'clock . "
38246	38255	38256	38256	Lucilla	119	" And she has a nice little voice , "
38609	38616	38600	38600	his	115	" How charming is divine philosophy ! "
38867	38886	38887	38889	the old lady	870	" My dear Lucilla , it is just the position that would suit you — with your talents ! "
38973	38990	38991	38992	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" But it is a great deal too soon to think of anything of that sort , "
38996	39024	38991	38992	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" If I had thought of that , I need never have come home at all ; and especially when papa has been so good about everything . "
39245	39258	39259	39259	Lucilla	119	" My dear , you must leave yourself entirely in my hands , "
39272	39329	39259	39259	Lucilla	119	" Do n't get impatient . I dare say you do n't know many people , and it may be a little slow for you at first ; but everybody has to put up with that , you know , for a beginning . And , by the bye , what are you going to wear ? "
39330	39338	39340	39340	Barbara	120	" I have not thought about it , "
39567	39574	39576	39577	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" There will be no dress , "
39582	39653	39576	39577	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I have insisted upon that . You know it is not a party , it is only an Evening . A white frock , high — that is all I mean to wear ; and mind you do n't lose patience . I shall keep my eye on you ; and after the first , I feel sure you will enjoy yourself . Good - bye for the present . "
40027	40043	40017	40018	Mrs Woodburn	99	" To see her eat her dinner as if she had nothing on her mind ! "
40050	40085	40086	40086	she	88	" as for me , though nobody can blame me if anything goes wrong , I could enjoy nothing for thinking of it . And I must say I was disappointed with the dinner , "
40118	40170	40172	40173	the banker	1343	" The fuss the men have always made about these dinners ! and except for a few made dishes that were really nothing , you know , I ca n't say I saw anything particular in it . And as for Lucilla , I ca n't think she has any feeling , "
40177	40191	40193	40194	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Oh , my dear , it is because you do n't understand , "
40196	40229	40193	40194	Mrs Woodburn	99	" She is kept up , you know , by a sense of duty . It is all because she has set her heart on being a comfort to her dear papa ! "
40461	40472	40473	40481	the persons who felt themselves threatened in their turn	1356	" She is never ill - tempered , you know , "
40571	40583	40584	40586	the old lady	870	" You know there is nothing to take off in me , "
40590	40613	40584	40586	the old lady	870	" I always was a simple body : and then I am old enough to be all your grandmothers , my dear ; "
40741	40744	40748	40748	her	119	" pieces . "
40821	40875	40877	40878	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Do go away , like a good man , and make yourself agreeable . There are so few men , you know , who can flirt in Carlingford . I have always reckoned upon you as such a valuable assistant . It is always an advantage to have a man who flirts , "
41068	41087	41088	41088	she	119	" Miss Lake ! what Miss Lake ? Good gracious ! Lake the drawing - master 's daughter ! "
41654	41668	41669	41669	she	88	" Come with me a minute ; I want to show you something , "
42168	42182	42184	42187	the banker 's wife	1344	" Mr Centum never listens to a note if he can help it , "
42189	42204	42184	42187	the banker 's wife	1344	" and how could he know whether she had a nice voice or not ? "
42431	42437	42447	42447	her	88	" Almost everybody can sing , "
42451	42476	42447	42447	her	88	" Perhaps Miss Brown will sing us something ; but as for me , you know , I am the mistress of the house . "
42555	42562	42539	42539	She	119	" Miss Marjoribanks would not be pleased "
42797	42808	42810	42811	Mr Cavendish	115	" You have never told us who your unknown was , "
42813	42832	42810	42811	Mr Cavendish	115	" I suppose she is professional . Carlingford could not possibly possess two such voices in private life . "
42833	42845	42847	42848	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Oh , I do n't know about two such voices , "
42850	42916	42847	42848	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" her voice suits mine , you know . It is always a great thing to find two voices that suit . I never would choose to have professional singers , for my part . You have to give yourself up to music when you do such a thing ; and that is not my idea of society . I am very fond of music , "
42918	42981	42810	42811	Mr Cavendish	115	Lucilla—"excessively fond of it ; but then everybody is not of my opinion — and one has to take so many things into consideration . For people who give one party in the year it does very well — but then I hate parties : the only pleasure in society is when one 's friends come to see one without any ado . "
42982	42989	42991	42992	Mrs Woodburn	99	" In white frocks , high , "
43037	43054	43055	43055	she	99	" Yes ; I hate a grand toilette when it is only a meeting of friends , "
43056	43082	43084	43084	Lucilla	119	said—"for the girls , you know ; of course you married ladies can always do what you like . You have your husbands to please , "
43128	43134	43136	43137	Mr Cavendish	115	" But about the contralto , "
43178	43226	43136	43137	Mr Cavendish	115	" You are always statesmanlike in your views ; but I can not understand why you let poor little Molly Brown carry on her chirping when you had such an astonishing force in reserve . She must have been covered with confusion , the poor little soul . "
43227	43233	43235	43236	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Nothing of the sort , "
43245	43273	43235	43236	Mrs Woodburn	99	" She only said , ' Goodness me ! how high Lucilla goes ! Do you like that dreadfully high music ? ' and made little eyebrows . "
43365	43375	43377	43377	Lucilla	119	" Molly Brown has a very nice little voice , "
43384	43434	43436	43437	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I like to hear her sing , for my part — the only thing is that she wants cultivation a little . It does n't matter much you know , whether or not you have a voice to begin with . It is cultivation that is the thing , "
43440	43543	43436	43437	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I hope you really thought it was a pleasant evening . Of course everybody said so to me ; but then one can never put any faith in that . I have said it myself ever so many times when I am sure I did not mean it . For myself , I do n't give any importance to the first evening . Anybody can do a thing once , you know ; the second and the third , and so on — that is the real test . But I hope you thought it pleasant so far as it went . "
43544	43554	43556	43557	Mr Cavendish	115	" It was a great deal more than pleasant , "
43559	43573	43556	43557	Mr Cavendish	115	" and as for your conception of social politics , it is masterly , "
43662	43680	43681	43681	she	119	" Oh , you know , I went through a course of political economy at Mount Pleasant , "
43688	43721	43681	43681	she	119	" One of the Miss Blounts was dreadfully strong - minded . I wonder , for my part , that she did not make me literary ; but fortunately I escaped that . "
43722	43727	43729	43730	Mr Cavendish	115	" Heaven be praised ! "
43732	43812	43729	43730	Mr Cavendish	115	" I think you ought to be Prime Minister . That contralto of yours is charming raw material ; but if I were you I would put her through an elementary course . She knows how to sing , but she does not know how to move ; and as for talking , she seems to expect to be insulted . If you make a pretty - behaved young lady out of that , you will beat Adam Smith . "
43813	43825	43827	43828	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Oh , I do n't know much about Adam Smith , "
43830	43932	43827	43828	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I think Miss Martha thought him rather old - fashioned . As for poor Barbara , she is only a little shy , but that will soon wear off . I do n't see what need she has to talk — or to move either , for that matter . I thought she did very well indeed for a girl who never goes into society . Was it not clever of me to find her out the very first day I was in Carlingford ? It has always been so difficult to find a voice that went perfectly with mine . "
43933	43949	43951	43952	Mr Cavendish	115	" For my part , I think it was a great deal more than clever , "
43968	44087	43955	43956	Mrs Woodburn	99	" It was a stroke of genius . So her name is Barbara ? I wonder if it would be indiscreet to ask where Mademoiselle Barbara comes from , or if she belongs to anybody , or lives anywhere . My own impression is that you mean to keep her shut up in a box all the week through , and produce her only on the Thursday evenings . I have a weakness for a fine contralto . If she had been existing in an ordinary habitation like other people in Carlingford , I should have heard her , or heard of her . It is clear to me that you keep her shut up in a box . "
44088	44091	44093	44093	Lucilla	119	" Exactly , "
44095	44184	44093	44093	Lucilla	119	" I do n't mean to tell you anything about her . You may be sure , now I have found her out , I mean to keep her for myself . Her box is quite a pretty one , like what Gulliver had somewhere . It is just time for lunch , and you are both going to stay , I hope ; and there is poor Mary Chiley and her husband coming through the garden . What a pity it is he is such a goose ! "
44185	44203	44205	44207	the incorrigible mimic	1439	" Yes ; but you know she never would take her uncle 's advice , my dear , "
44216	44242	44243	44244	Mrs Woodburn	99	" and being an orphan , what could anybody do ? And then she does not get on with his family . By the way , "
44251	44265	44243	44244	Mrs Woodburn	99	tone—"I wonder if anybody ever does get on with her husband 's family ? "
44313	44339	44340	44340	she	99	" I shall be quite interested to watch you , Lucilla , when it comes to be your turn , and see how you manage , "
44391	44396	44398	44398	she	119	" engaged her affections , "
44482	44496	44498	44499	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I always make it a point never to shock anybody 's prejudices , "
44501	44551	44553	44553	Lucilla	119	" I should do just the same with them as with other people ; all you have to do is to show from the first that you mean to be good friends with everybody . But then I am so lucky : I can always get on with people , "
44604	44608	44602	44602	he	115	" quite devoted , "
44745	44751	44740	44740	She	99	" one of the Cavendishes , "
45130	45134	45122	45122	her	88	" saying the words "
45226	45231	45234	45234	herself	88	" for the best , "
45455	45458	45477	45478	poor man	4438	" nice , "
45742	45755	45734	45734	She	120	" What is the matter ? is there anything wrong at home ? "
45768	45773	45775	45775	Barbara	120	" Oh , Rose , "
45783	45824	45775	45775	Barbara	120	" only fancy ; I have just seen him . I met him right in front of Masters 's , and he took off his hat to me . I feel in such a way — I can scarcely speak . "
45825	45830	45832	45832	Rose	108	" Met — who ? "
45900	45908	45910	45910	Barbara	120	" Oh , you stupid little thing ! "
45914	45917	45910	45910	Barbara	120	" a shake "
45923	46006	46008	46008	Barbara	120	" I tell you , him!—the gentleman I met at Lucilla Marjoribanks 's . He looked as if he was quite delighted to see me again ; and I am sure he turned round to see where I was going . He could n't speak to me , you know , the first time ; though indeed I should n't be the least surprised if he had followed — at a distance , you know , only to see where I live , "
46062	46082	46083	46083	she	120	" I am quite sure he will find out before long ; and do n't forget I said so , "
46094	46108	46110	46110	Rose	108	" I do n't see what it matters if he found out directly , "
46112	46202	46204	46204	Rose	108	" Papa would not let anybody come to our house that he did not approve of ; and then , you know , he will never have anything to say to people who are patronising . I do n't want to hear any more about your fine gentleman . If you were worried as I am , you would think much more of getting home than of anybody bowing to you in the street . One of the gentlemen from Marlborough House once took off his hat to me , "
46211	46252	46204	46204	Rose	108	" Of course I was pleased ; but then I knew it was my design he was thinking of — my Honiton flounce , you know . I suppose this other one must have thought you had a pretty voice . "
46270	46281	46282	46282	she	120	" I wish you would not be such a goose , "
46285	46462	46464	46464	Barbara	120	" who cares about your Honiton flounce ? He took off his hat because — because he admired me , I suppose — and then it was a great deal more than just taking off his hat . He gave me such a look ! Papa has no sense , though I suppose you will blaze up when I say so . He ought to think of us a little . As for patronising , I should soon change that , I can tell you . But then papa thinks of nothing but paying his bills and keeping out of debt , as he says — as if everybody was not in debt ; and how do you suppose we are ever to get settled in life ? It would be far more sensible to spend a little more , and go into society a little , and do us justice . Only think all that that old Doctor is doing for Lucilla ; and there are four of us when the little ones grow up , "
46472	46494	46464	46464	Barbara	120	" I should like to know what papa is thinking of ? If mamma had not died when she did — — "
46495	46504	46506	46506	Rose	108	" It was not poor mamma 's fault , "
46508	46546	46548	46555	the little mistress of the School of Design	1494	" I dare say she would have lived if she could for all our sakes . But then you have always taken a false view of our position , Barbara . We are a family of artists , "
46579	46595	46597	46597	Rose	108	" When papa is appreciated as he deserves , and when Willie has made a name "
46603	46675	46597	46597	Rose	108	" things will be different . But the true strength of our position is that we are a family of artists . We are everybody 's equal , and we are nobody 's equal . We have a rank of our own . If you would only remember this , you would not grudge anything to Lucilla Marjoribanks ; and then I am sure she has been very kind to you . "
46676	46681	46683	46685	the unfeeling Barbara	120	" Oh , bother ! "
46687	46799	46683	46685	the unfeeling Barbara	120	" You do nothing but encourage papa with your nonsense . And I should like to know what right Lucilla Marjoribanks has to be kind to me ? If I am not as good as she , it is a very strange thing . I should never take the trouble to think about him if it was not that Lucilla believes he is paying her attention — that is the great fun . It would be delicious to take him from her , and make game of her and her kindness . Goodness ! there he is again . I felt sure that he would try to find out the house . "
46957	46969	46970	46970	she	120	" I knew he was trying to find out the house , "
46978	46988	46970	46970	she	120	" And Lucilla thinks he is paying her attention ! "
47193	47202	47203	47203	she	119	" It is the second time that counts , "
47211	47251	47253	47253	Lucilla	119	" Last Thursday they wanted to see the drawing - room , and they wanted to know what sort of thing it was to be . Dear Mrs Chiley , it is to - night that is the test , "
47333	47343	47344	47346	the old lady	870	" She wants a little support , poor dear , "
47406	47427	47433	47433	her	96	" He will come and give you his assistance as soon as ever he can get away from the gentlemen , "
47437	47450	47433	47433	her	96	" but , good gracious , Lucilla , what is the matter ? "
47507	47536	47538	47541	this overplus of society	1515	" There is no room , Lucilla . Lucilla , everybody in Carlingford is here . Do make a little room for us in the drawing - room , "
47631	47645	47656	47656	her	88	" They will not be able to get in when they come upstairs , "
47721	47758	47760	47760	Lucilla	119	" You girls have no business to get into corners . The corners are for the people that can talk . It is one of my principles always to flirt in the middle of the company , "
48295	48300	48301	48301	she	119	" My dear Barbara , "
48318	48356	48301	48301	she	119	" that is enough for to - night . Mr Cavendish will take you downstairs and get you a cup of tea ; for you know there is no room to - night to serve it upstairs . "
48569	48584	48585	48586	Mrs Chiley	96	" My dear , I would have nothing to do with that bold girl , "
48593	48649	48585	48586	Mrs Chiley	96	" I will go down and look after them if you like . A girl like that always leads the gentlemen astray , you know . I never liked the looks of her . Let me go downstairs and look after them , my dear . I am sure I want a cup of tea . "
48650	48663	48665	48666	Miss Marjoribanks—"some	152	" You shall have a cup of tea , dear Mrs Chiley , "
48666	48731	48733	48733	Lucilla	119	Marjoribanks—"some of them will bring you one ; but I ca n't let you take any trouble about Barbara . She had to be stopped , you know , or she would have turned us into a musical party ; and as for Mr Cavendish , he is the best assistant I have . There are so few men in Carlingford who can flirt , "
48783	48792	48797	48797	he	153	" But then I do n't know how , "
48846	48857	48858	48858	she	119	" I did not mean you , my dear Osy , "
48866	48892	48893	48893	she	119	" When you are a little older we shall see what you can do ; but you are not at all disagreeable for a boy , "
49564	49575	49555	49556	Mrs Chiley	96	" I confess I was a little nervous this evening , "
49581	49645	49646	49646	Lucilla	119	" You know it is always the second that is the test . But I think , on the whole , it has gone off very well . Mr Cavendish , you promised to tell me the truth ; for you know I have great confidence in your judgment . Tell me sincerely , do you think it has been a pleasant evening ? "
49746	49754	49755	49755	he	115	" Not so pleasant as last Thursday , "
49758	49790	49792	49794	the future M.P.	1436	" I am not fit to be a lady 's adviser , for I am too sincere ; but I incline to think it is the third that is the test , "
49832	49843	49845	49846	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" If everybody would only help me as you do ! "
49848	49896	49898	49898	Lucilla	119	" Good - night ; I am so sorry you have not enjoyed yourself . But then it is such a consolation to meet with people that are sincere . And I think , on the whole , it has gone off very well for the second , "
49900	49911	49898	49898	Lucilla	119	" though I say it that should not say it . "
49966	49970	49971	49971	she	119	" Next Thursday , "
50074	50079	50083	50085	the weary entertainer	1599	" All is vanity , "
50643	50647	50631	50631	Lucilla	119	" the gentlemen , "
50715	50735	50736	50736	she	88	" For you know , after all , in Carlingford , one is obliged to take them into consideration , "
50744	50769	50736	50736	she	88	" So many of you poor dear people have to go where they like , and see the people they want you to see , "
50862	50874	50875	50876	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I never pretend I do n't try to please them , "
51270	51274	51268	51269	Mr Cavendish	115	" my dear , "
51370	51373	51362	51362	she	99	" take off "
51612	51622	51623	51623	he	93	" Her talent has taken another development from ours , "
51633	51654	51623	51623	he	93	" but still she has the artist temperament . All my children have been brought up to love the beautiful ; "
51676	51686	51688	51688	Rose	108	" And then Barbara has such a noble head , "
51690	51775	51777	51777	Rose	108	" when nobody is looking at her she always makes a fine composition . To be sure , when she is observed she gets awkward , and puts herself out of drawing ; but that is not to be wondered at . I do n't want her to be fine , or to imitate the Grange Lane people ; but then , you know , papa , you always say that we have a rank of our own , being a family of artists , "
51803	51818	51819	51819	he	1652	" If one could only have made a study of her at that moment , "
52499	52503	52526	52526	his	115	" taking off , "
52834	52850	52852	52854	the old lady	870	" My dear , I would never let her enter my door again — never ! "
52856	52915	52916	52917	Mrs Chiley	96	" I told you long ago I never could bear her looks — you know I warned you , Lucilla . As for her singing , what does it matter ? You have a much prettier voice than she has : everybody knows that a soprano is perfect by itself , but a contralto is only a second , "
52926	52947	52916	52917	Mrs Chiley	96	" and , my dear , I should never let her enter my house again , if it was me . "
52948	52953	52955	52955	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley , "
52969	53047	52955	52955	Lucilla	119	" it is so nice of you to be vexed . You know I would do anything to please you;—but , after all , there are thousands and thousands of gentlemen , and it is not so easy to find a voice that goes with mine . All my masters always said it was a quite peculiar second I wanted ; and suppose Barbara is foolish , that is not to say I should forget my duties , "
53057	53073	53048	53049	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" and then , you know , she has no mother to keep her right . "
53074	53084	53086	53087	Mrs Chiley	96	" And neither have you , my poor dear , "
53116	53121	53122	53122	she	96	" I have you , "
53129	53136	53138	53138	Lucilla	119	" and then I am different , "
53285	53287	53309	53310	Mrs Chiley	96	" cool "
53394	53411	53412	53412	she	88	" It might have been different , you know , if my affections had been engaged , "
53785	53790	53758	53758	She	99	" for just one song "
54240	54250	54251	54251	Lucilla	119	" I am so afraid you have caught cold , "
54255	54309	54251	54251	Lucilla	119	" if you do n't feel clear in your lower notes , we can pass over this passage , you know , for to - day . You must see papa before you go away , and he will order you something ; but , my dear Barbara , you must take care . "
54836	54839	54789	54789	Providence	107	" evening . "
55421	55454	55456	55456	Lucilla	119	" What can you be thinking of to let her stand so near the window ? If she were to catch cold and lose her voice , what should we all do ? "
55473	55486	55488	55488	her	119	" Take care she does not go back again into the draught , "
55565	55573	55574	55574	Lucilla	119	" Fortunately my affections never were engaged , "
55719	55729	55730	55731	Mr Centum	98	" I never imagined Cavendish was such a fool , "
55742	55767	55730	55731	Mr Centum	98	" if he likes that style of philandering , it is nothing to me , but he need not make an idiot of himself . "
55786	55794	55795	55795	he	162	" It must be all your fault , "
55821	55880	55882	55884	the uncivil husband	1774	" you ought to tell him he 's making an ass of himself . Why the deuce do you let him go on with that tomfoolery ? He 'll lose all his chances in life , and then , I hope , you 'll be satisfied . You women can never see an inch before your own noses ! "
56818	56822	56825	56825	he	326	" young puppy , "
56972	56982	56983	56983	Barbara	120	" She is such an actor , you know , "
56986	57054	56983	56983	Barbara	120	" she never will give in to let you know how she is feeling — not if she can help it ; but for all that she must have felt it . Nobody could help feeling it , though she carried it off so well . I knew how it would be , as soon as I had on a dress that was fit to be seen . "
57055	57066	57068	57068	Rose	108	" What is it that she could not help feeling ? "
57070	57079	57068	57068	Rose	108	" I suppose it is Lucilla you mean ? "
57080	57096	57098	57098	Barbara	120	" I should like to know what right she had to be kind to me , "
57109	57159	57161	57162	the contralto	799	" and invite me there , and introduce me in her grand way , as if she was any better than I am ! And then to look at all her India muslins ; but I knew it would be different as soon as I had a decent dress , "
57384	57387	57379	57379	she	108	" sweet feeling "
57509	57521	57523	57523	Rose	108	" I wish you would not talk in that foolish way , "
57525	57595	57523	57523	Rose	108	" nobody need be any better than you , as you say . To be sure , we do n't live in Grange Lane , nor keep a carriage ; but I wish you would recollect that these are only accidental circumstances . As for dress , I do n't see that you require it ; our position is so clearly defined ; we are a family of — — "
57596	57613	57615	57615	Barbara	120	" Oh , for goodness gracious sake , do be quiet with your family of artists ! "
57617	57733	57735	57736	the contralto	799	" Speak for yourself , if you please . I am not an artist , and never will be , I can tell you . There are better places to live in than Grange Lane ; and as for keeping a carriage , I would never call a little bit of a brougham a carriage , if it was me . Lucilla made believe to take no notice , but she did not deceive me with that . She was as disappointed as ever she could be — I dare say now she 's sitting crying over it . I never would have cared one straw if I had not wanted to serve Lucilla out ! "
57812	57821	57823	57823	Rose	108	" Do n't put yourself out of drawing , "
57825	57864	57866	57873	the little Preraphaelite , with a rising colour	1823	" I wish you would not do that so often . When the facial angle is disturbed to that extent —— But about Lucilla , I think you are excessively ungrateful . Gratitude is not a servile sentiment , "
57875	57921	57866	57873	the little Preraphaelite , with a rising colour	1823	" It is a slavish sort of idea to think any one has done you an injury by being kind to you . If that is the sort of thing you are going to talk of , I think you had better go to bed . "
57922	57935	57937	57937	Barbara	120	" Then I will , and I sha n't tell you anything , "
57938	58069	58071	58071	Barbara	120	angrily—"you are so poor - spirited . For my part , do you think I 'd ever have gone to help Lucilla and sing for her , and all that sort of thing , if it had not been to better myself ? Nor I would n't have thought of him just at first , if it had n't been to spite her . And I 've done it too . I 'd just like to look in at her room window and see what she 's about . I dare say she is crying her eyes out , for all her looking as if she took no notice . I know better than to think she does n't care . And , Rose , he 's such a dear , "
58137	58149	58151	58151	Rose	108	" I do n't want to hear any more about it , "
58165	58199	58201	58201	Rose	108	" I ca n't think how it is you have no sense of honour , and you one of the Lakes . I would not be a traitor for a dozen Mr Cavendishes ! "
58210	58236	58201	58201	Rose	108	" He must be a cheat , since you are a traitor . If he was a true man he would have found you out . "
58237	58246	58248	58248	Barbara	166	" You had better be quiet , Rose , "
58250	58281	58248	58248	Barbara	166	" you may be sure I shall never do anything for you after we are married , if you talk like that ; and then you 'll be sorry enough . "
58282	58296	58298	58298	Rose	108	" After you are married ! has he asked you to marry him ? "
58370	58385	58386	58386	she	166	" You do n't suppose I am going to answer after your insulting ways , "
58481	58499	58501	58501	Rose	108	" To think she should be one of us , and not to know what honour means , "
58503	58524	58501	58501	Rose	108	" and as for this man , he must be a cheat himself , or he would find her out . "
58839	58846	58847	58847	she	1843	" You know best , papa , "
58859	58889	58847	58847	she	1843	" if there is anybody who is ill and ca n't come , it must be your fault — but I did not hear that any one was ill . "
58890	58894	58896	58897	the Doctor	326	" Nor I , "
59253	59275	59276	59276	Nancy	102	" I ai n't one as goes just upon fish and flesh and fowl , like some as call themselves cooks , "
59279	59392	59393	59393	Nancy	102	" If I have a failing , it 's for things as suits . When it 's brown , make it brown , and do n't be mean about the gravy - beef — that 's my principle ; and when it ai n't brown , mind what you 're a - doing of — and do n't go and throw a heap of entrys and things at a gentleman 's head without no ' armony . I always says to Miss Lucilla as ' armony 's the thing ; and when I 've set it all straight in my mind , I ai n't one as likes to be put out , "
59507	59525	59527	59527	Nancy	102	" I heard as master said , there was some gentleman as was n't a - coming , "
59529	59611	59613	59613	Nancy	102	" Not as one makes no difference in a dinner ; but I allays likes to know . I do n't like no waste , for my part . I ai n't one as calk'lates too close , but if there 's one thing as I hates like poison , it 's waste . I said as I would ask , for Thomas ai n't as correct as could be wished . Is it one less than usual , Miss Lucilla ? "
59636	59648	59650	59651	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Oh , no ; it is just the usual number , "
59653	59670	59650	59651	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" It was only a joke of papa's — they are all just as usual — — "
59735	59739	59741	59741	her	102	" Poor dear ! "
59797	59819	59821	59821	Nancy	102	" Miss Lucilla , I would say as you 've been doing too much , if anybody was to ask me , "
59827	59873	59875	59875	Nancy	102	impulse—"all them practisings and things . They 're well enough for young ladies as ai n't got nothing else to do ; but you as has such a deal in your hands —— If there was any little thing as you could fancy for dinner , "
59883	59918	59875	59875	Nancy	102	" I 've set it all down as I thought would be nicest , allays if you approves , Miss Lucilla ; but if there was any little thing as you could fancy — — "
59919	59931	59932	59932	she	102	" Poor dear , it 's all as we can do , "
60095	60107	60108	60108	she	102	" I always said as she had a deal of sense , "
60113	60135	60108	60108	she	102	" There ai n't one young lady in a hundred as knows what 's good for her , like Miss Lucilla . "
60167	60186	60188	60190	her faithful retainer	1865	" I would n't worrit myself with all them practisings , Miss Lucilla , if I was you , "
60192	60261	60188	60190	her faithful retainer	1865	" They 're a deal too much for you . I 've took the liberty , when all was cleaned up , to go on the stair and listen a bit , and there ai n't nothing to equal it when you 're a - singing by yourself . I do n't think nothing of them duets — and as for that bold - faced brazen thing — — "
60262	60269	60271	60271	Lucilla	119	" Oh , Nancy , hush ! "
60273	60325	60327	60327	Lucilla	119	" Miss Lake has a beautiful voice . If she does not look quite like a lady , it is not her fault , poor thing . She has no mamma to set her right , you know . She is the best assistant I have — she and Mr Cavendish , "
60378	60388	60389	60389	she	119	" But I would n't worrit about them duets , "
60399	60460	60389	60389	she	119	" I would n't , not if I was you , Miss Lucilla , asking pardon for the liberty : as for having no mamma , you have no mamma yourself , and you the young lady as is most thought upon in Carlingford , and as different from that brazen - faced thing , with her red cheeks — — "
60461	60469	60470	60470	Lucilla	119	" Hush , oh hush , Nancy , "
60512	60529	60530	60530	she	119	" Poor Barbara ! I wish she could only look a little bit like a lady , "
60894	60910	60877	60877	She	870	" Oh , yes , my dear , I am sure it will be charming , "
60922	60944	60945	60946	Mrs Chiley	96	" Let us go in and sit down a moment , for I have something to say to you , Lucilla , "
60980	60991	60993	60994	Mrs Chiley	96	" You have not been to see me since Monday , "
60996	61040	60993	60994	Mrs Chiley	96	" I am sure you are not well , or you could not have stayed away so long ; but if you did not feel equal to going out , why did you not send for me , Lucilla , my poor dear ? "
61147	61152	61154	61154	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley ! "
61156	61175	61154	61154	Lucilla	119	" I am quite well , and I meant to have come to see you to - day . "
61176	61181	61183	61184	Mrs Chiley	96	" My poor dear ! "
61187	61303	61305	61306	Mrs Chiley	96	" You say you are quite well for you have such a spirit ; but I can see what you have been going through . I do n't understand how you can keep on , and do so much . But it was not that that brought me here . There is some one coming to Carlingford that I want you to meet , Lucilla . He is a relation of Mary Chiley 's husband , and as she does not get on very well with them , you know , I think it is our duty to be civil . And they say he is a very nice man ; and young — enough , "
61363	61371	61372	61372	she	88	" Do n't be sorry for me , "
61375	61414	61415	61415	Lucilla	119	" I told you that fortunately my affections were not engaged . I do n't want any new gentleman introduced to me . If that was what I was thinking of , I never need have come home , "
61486	61495	61497	61498	Mrs Chiley	96	" My dear , he is a clergyman , "
61516	61701	61702	61704	the old lady	870	" and you know a nice clergyman is always nice , and you need not think of him as a young man unless you like . He has a nice property , and he is Rector of Basing , which is a very good living , and Archdeacon of Stanmore . He has come here to hold a visitation , you know ; and they say that if Carlingford was made into a bishopric , he is almost sure to be the first bishop ; and you know a bishop , or even an archdeacon , has a very nice position . I want to be civil to him for Mary Chiley 's sake , who is not on such terms as we could wish with her husband 's friends ; and then I suppose he will have to be a great deal in Carlingford , and I should like him to form a good impression . I want you and your dear good papa to come and meet him ; and then after that — but one thing is enough at a time , "
61755	61765	61767	61767	Lucilla	119	" I am sure papa will be very happy , "
61769	61866	61767	61767	Lucilla	119	" and , indeed , if you like , I shall be very glad to ask him here . If he is a friend of yours , that is quite enough for me . It is very nice to know a nice clergyman ; but as for being a young man , I ca n't see how that matters . If I had been thinking of that , I need never — but I should think papa would like to meet him ; and you know it is the object of my life to please papa . "
61867	61874	61876	61877	the Colonel	595	" Yes , my poor dear , "
61881	61937	61938	61939	Mrs Chiley	96	" and he would be hard - hearted indeed if he was not pleased ; but still we must consider you a little , Lucilla . You do everything for other people , and you never think of yourself . But I like to see you with nice people round you , for my part , "
61940	61954	61767	61767	Lucilla	119	added—"really nice people , and not these poor - spirited , ungrateful — — "
61955	61960	61962	61962	Lucilla	119	" Hush , hush ! "
61964	62020	61962	61962	Lucilla	119	" I do n't know such nice people anywhere as there are in Carlingford . Some people are never pleased with their neighbours , but I always get on so well with everybody . It is my good luck , you know ; and so long as I have you , dear Mrs Chiley — — "
62021	62026	62028	62030	the old lady	870	" Ah , Lucilla ! "
62032	62146	62148	62149	Mrs Chiley	96	" that is very kind of you — and you could not have anybody that is fonder of you than I am ; but still I am an old woman , old enough to be your grandmother , my dear — and we have your future interests to think of . As for all the vexations you have had , I think I could find it in my heart to turn that ungrateful creature to the door . Do n't let her come here any more . I like your voice a great deal better when you are singing by yourself — and I am sure the Archdeacon would be of my opinion , "
62213	62228	62230	62230	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley , it is so nice of you to be vexed , "
62245	62328	62330	62330	Lucilla	119	" Papa will be delighted , I am sure , and I can come in the evening . The Colonel likes to have only six people , and you will be three to start with , so there ca n't be any room for me at dinner ; and you know I do n't mind about dinner . I shall come in the evening and make tea for you — and if you think he would like to come next Thursday — — "
63376	63381	63382	63383	Dr Marjoribanks	90	" You are late , "
63498	63502	63493	63493	she	96	" my dear . "
63503	63512	63513	63514	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Dinner is on the table , papa , "
63660	63676	63677	63677	she	119	" When the servants are gone I will tell you what we are laughing at , "
63688	63693	63695	63695	she	96	" more than delighted , "
63730	63745	63746	63746	Lucilla	119	" I could not think how I was going to get her to consent , "
63749	63776	63746	63746	Lucilla	119	" but you know she thought I was in low spirits , the dear old soul , and that it would be a comfort to me . "
64336	64355	64356	64357	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" The air is so delicious to - night that I had some seats placed in the garden , "
64360	64437	64439	64439	Lucilla	119	" and if you all like we will sing to you up here , and give you as much music as ever you please . You know I never would consent to be too musical when everybody was in one room . It does not matter so much , when there are a suite ; but then papa , you know , is only a professional man , and I have but one drawing - room , "
64474	64520	64461	64472	a lady who liked to be the great lady of the party	1976	" It is only in summer that we can be a little like you fine people , who have as many rooms as you please . When you are at a little distance we will sing to you all the evening , if you like . "
64521	64538	64540	64541	Lady Richmond	164	" But , my dear , are you sure you feel able for so much exertion ? "
64584	64599	64601	64603	that gentle martyr	1980	" Dear Lady Richmond , I hope I am always able for my duty , "
64605	64638	64566	64566	she	164	" Papa would be wretched if he did not think we were all enjoying ourselves ; and you know it is the object of my life to be a comfort to papa . "
64740	64753	64754	64755	Lady Richmond	164	" I am afraid that dear girl is keeping up too well , "
64758	64809	64754	64755	Lady Richmond	164	" I never saw such fortitude . All the young people say she does not feel it ; but as soon as I fixed my eyes on her I saw the difference . You can always find out what a girl 's feelings are when you look into her eyes . "
64810	64813	64815	64816	Mrs Chiley	96	" Yes , "
64869	64887	64888	64890	the old lady	870	" She goes through a great deal , and it never seems to do her any harm , "
64898	64928	64888	64890	the old lady	870	" It is such a comfort that she has a good constitution , especially as her mother was so delicate ; and then Lucilla has such a spirit — — "
64929	64940	64942	64943	Lady Richmond	164	" But one may try a good constitution too far , "
64945	64998	65000	65002	the county lady	1990	" and I am certain she is full of feeling . It is sure to come out when she sings , and that is why I came to this seat . I should not like to lose a note . And do tell me who is that horrid flirting , disagreeable girl , "
65162	65168	65146	65146	girls	4764	" just for this bar , "
65225	65238	65241	65241	everybody	300	" Nobody but Lucilla ever could have thought of anything so delicious , "
65257	65267	65246	65248	the two singers	2003	" Do you think they are all by themselves ? "
65421	65424	65414	65414	his	103	" Brava ! "
66324	66338	66340	66341	the Colonel	595	" But you have broken your music - stand or something , Lucilla , "
66343	66365	66367	66368	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Oh , no ; it is only a portfolio . I ca n't think what could make me so awkward , "
66370	66386	66367	66368	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I suppose it was seeing some one come in whom I did n't know . "
66410	66423	66425	66427	the old soldier	2047	" We used to have the best of it in our day , "
66429	66438	66425	66427	the old soldier	2047	" but now you churchmen are the men . "
66887	66910	66911	66913	the old lady	870	" Coming to you the very first night , and almost in his travelling things , to take the cream off everything , "
66924	66940	66911	66913	the old lady	870	" and after that , what have we to show him in Carlingford , Lucilla ? "
66972	66979	66980	66980	she	88	" They never know any better , "
66984	67014	67016	67016	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley , there was nothing else to be expected ; but , at the same time , I do n't think things are so very bad , "
67057	67079	67080	67080	he	5143	" I have no doubt it was a very pleasant party , if one could have got the key - note , "
67778	67782	67776	67777	the Archdeacon	5143	" my dear , "
68075	68094	68096	68101	his brother - in - law	1953	" After making such a deuced ass of himself , by George ! what could the fellow do ? "
68546	68563	68564	68564	Lucilla	119	" I have always thought it very strange that I never had any sense of humour , "
68567	68603	68564	68564	Lucilla	119	" but it would not do , you know , if all the world was like me ; and society would be nothing if everybody did not exert themselves to the best of their abilities . "
68713	68724	68725	68725	Lucilla	119	" I have nothing to say against any of you , "
68748	68793	68795	68806	the woman of genius , with the candour of a great mind	2140	" I dare say you will all fall in love with somebody sooner or later , and be very happy and good for nothing ; but you are no assistance in any way to society . It is Mr Cavendish I am sighing for , "
69181	69183	69185	69187	her own person	523	" viewy "
69629	69642	69643	69643	Rose	108	" I do not ask you to have a sense of duty , "
69652	69663	69643	69643	Rose	108	" but at least you might have a proper pride . "
69759	69764	69780	69780	her	2159	" she was not able "
69796	69805	69806	69806	she	108	" What do you mean by lying there ? "
69825	69896	69806	69806	she	108	" will that do any good ? You would try to look better than usual , and sing better than usual , if you had any proper pride . I did not fall ill when my flounce was passed over at the exhibition . I made up my mind that very evening about the combination for my veil . I would die rather than give in if I were you . "
69897	69901	69806	69806	she	108	" Your flounce ! "
69903	69969	69806	69806	she	108	Barbara—"oh , you unfeeling insensible thing!—as if your h - heart had anything to do with — that . I only went to s - spite Lucilla — and I wo n't go — no more — oh , no more — now he 's been and deserted me . You ca n't understand my feelings — g - go away and leave me alone . "
69970	69973	69975	69975	Rose	108	" Barbara , "
69980	70042	69975	69975	Rose	108	" I would forgive you if you would not be mean . I do n't understand it in one of us . If Mr Cavendish has gone away , it shows that he does not care for you ; and you would scorn him , and scorn to show you were thinking of him , if you had any proper pride . "
70432	70442	70444	70444	Rose	108	" I came to speak to you about Barbara , "
70446	70534	70536	70536	Rose	108	" She is not fit to come out this morning . I told her it was very ungrateful not to make an effort after you had been so kind ; but I am sorry to say she has not a strong sense of duty ; and I do n't think she would be able to sing or do anything but look stupid . I hope you will not think very badly of her . There are some people who ca n't help giving in , I suppose , "
70544	70556	70558	70558	Lucilla	119	" And so this is you , you dear little Rose ! "
70560	70639	70558	70558	Lucilla	119	" and I have never seen you before since I came home — and you always were such a pet of mine at Mount Pleasant ! I ca n't think why you never came to see me before ; as for me , you know , I never have any time . Poor papa has nobody else to take care of him , and it always was the object of my life to be a comfort to papa . "
70640	70643	70645	70645	Rose	108	" Yes , "
70660	70670	70671	70671	she	108	" I have a great deal to do too , "
70674	70711	70712	70712	Rose	108	" and then all my spare moments I am working at my design . Papa always says that society accepts artists for what they can give , and does not expect them to sacrifice their time , "
70789	70798	70800	70801	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I should like to see your design , "
70804	70909	70800	70801	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" You made such a pretty little wreath for the corner of my handkerchief — don't you remember?—all frogs ' legs and things . It looked so sweet in the old satin stitch . What is the matter with poor Barbara ? I felt sure she would catch cold and lose her voice . I shall tell papa to go and see her . As for to - night , it will be a dreadful loss to be sure , for I never could find a voice that went so well with mine . But if you are sure she ca n't come — — "
70910	70920	70922	70922	Rose	108	" When people have not a sense of duty , "
70929	70977	70979	70981	the little artist	2159	" nor any proper pride,——Some are so different . Barbara ought to have been some rich person 's daughter , with nothing to do . She would not mind being of no use in the world . It is a kind of temperament I do n't understand , "
71097	71110	71112	71112	Lucilla	119	" You must come yourself this evening , you dear old Rose , "
71114	71175	71177	71178	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" You know I always was fond of you . Oh , yes , I know you ca n't sing like Barbara . But the Archdeacon is coming , who understands about art ; and if you would like to bring your design —— My principle has always been , that there should be a little of everything in society , "
71180	71210	71177	71178	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I dare say you will feel a little strange at first with not knowing the people , but that will soon pass off — and you must come . "
71249	71257	71259	71260	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I am sure you can talk , "
71266	71278	71262	71262	She	119	" Go away now , and leave me to my arrangements ; "
71528	71533	71556	71556	she	108	" a family of artists "
71546	71555	71556	71556	she	108	" We have a rank of our own , "
71582	71616	71556	71556	she	108	ground—"We are everybody 's equal , and we are nobody 's equal — and when papa begins to be appreciated as he ought to be , and Willie has made a Name — — "
71649	71651	71556	71556	she	108	" compositions "
72628	72633	72635	72636	Mr Beverley	170	" By the bye , "
72638	72727	72729	72730	the Archdeacon	5143	" I meant to ask if any one knew a man whom I am sure I caught a glimpse of the first day I was in Carlingford . Perhaps it was in the morning after I arrived , to be precise . I ca n't recollect exactly . If he lives about here , he ought to be known , for he is a clever amusing sort of fellow . I do n't know if Carlingford is more blessed than other country towns with people of that complexion , "
72828	72835	72837	72838	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Everybody is nice in Carlingford , "
72840	72868	72837	72838	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" some people are always finding fault with their neighbours , but I always get on so well with everybody — I suppose it is my luck . "
73023	73038	73040	73041	the Archdeacon	5143	" You must not expect me to believe in the perfection of human society , "
73050	73084	73086	73092	the Broad - Churchman in a parenthesis	2256	" I would much rather pin my faith to the amiable dispositions of one young lady who always finds her neighbours agreeable — and I hope she makes no exception to the rule , "
73110	73231	73103	73103	he	5143	" The man I speak of is really a very amusing fellow , and very well got up , and calculated to impose upon ordinary observers . It is quite a curious story ; he was a son of a trainer or something of that sort about Newmarket . Old Lord Monmouth took an extraordinary fancy to him , and had him constantly about his place — at one time , indeed , he half brought him up along with his grandson , you know . He always was a handsome fellow , and picked up a little polish ; and really , for people not quite used to the real thing , was as nearly like a gentleman — — "
73232	73246	73248	73249	Mr Woodburn	162	" Come , now , I do n't put any faith in that , "
73251	73287	73105	73105	his	5143	" I do n't pretend to be much of a one for fine company myself , but I know a gentleman when I see him ; a snob always overdoes it , you know — — "
73288	73298	73300	73301	the Archdeacon	5143	" I never said this man was a snob , "
73317	73340	73300	73301	the Archdeacon	5143	" on the contrary , if he had only been honest , he would have been really a very nice fellow — — "
73341	73346	73348	73349	Mr Bury	109	" My dear sir , "
73351	73446	73448	73449	the Rector	567	" excuse me for breaking in — perhaps I am old - fashioned , but do n't you think it 's a pity to treat the question of honesty so lightly ? A dishonest person has a precious soul to be saved , and may be a most deeply interesting character ; but to speak of him as a very nice fellow , is — pardon me — I think it 's a pity ; especially in mixed society , where it is so important for a clergyman to be guarded in his expressions , "
73496	73508	73510	73511	the Archdeacon	5143	" I hope Mr Bury 's dishonest friends will pardon me , "
73513	73578	73510	73511	the Archdeacon	5143	" I mean no harm to their superior claims . Does anybody know the man here , I wonder ? He had changed his name when I knew him , and there is no telling what he may call himself now . I assure you he was a very good - looking fellow — dark , good features , nearly six feet high — — "
73579	73589	73591	73592	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Oh , please do n't say any more , "
73608	73671	73595	73595	she	88	" if you tell me what he is like , I shall fancy everybody I meet is him ; Mr Centum is dark , and has good features , and is nearly six feet high . Never mind what he is like ; you gentlemen can never describe anybody — you always keep to generals ; tell us what he has done . "
74111	74120	74121	74122	the Archdeacon	5143	" He has a mark on his face , "
74143	74156	74158	74158	Lucilla	119	" Do n't tell us what marks he has on his face , "
74160	74239	74241	74242	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I know that I shall think every man who is dark , and has good features , and is six feet , must be him . I wonder if it could be my cousin Tom ; he has a little mark on his face — and it would be just like his dreadful luck , poor fellow . Would it be right to give up one 's own cousin if it should turn out to be Tom ? "
74630	74646	74648	74649	Mrs Chiley	96	" You are not in spirits to - night , Lucilla , my poor dear , "
74686	74691	74693	74694	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Dear Mrs Chiley , "
74696	74746	74748	74748	Lucilla	119	" I am in perfect spirits ; it is only the responsibility , you know . Poor Barbara is ill , and we ca n't have any music , and what if people should be bored ? When one has real friends to stand by one it is different , "
74761	74770	74748	74748	Lucilla	119	" and I always stand by my friends . "
75387	75392	75382	75382	Barbara	99	" to spite Lucilla , "
75618	75627	75629	75630	Mrs Chiley	96	" A disappointment may happen to any one , "
75632	75678	75680	75682	the old lady	870	" and so long as they had done nothing unbecoming , nobody could blame them ; but , my dears , whatever you do , do n't show it like that ! It makes me ashamed of my sex . And only look at Lucilla ! "
75969	75981	75983	75985	the old lady	870	" He is not like what clergymen were in our day , "
75987	76061	76063	76064	Mrs Chiley	96	" but still he is very nice , and has a nice position , and it would just suit Lucilla ; but to think of her going and leaving him with these Lake girls , notwithstanding the lesson she has had ! and I have no doubt the little one is just as designing and nasty as the other . If it should come to anything , she has only herself to blame , "
76086	76095	76097	76099	the old soldier	2047	" You may trust a parson for that , "
76101	76125	76097	76099	the old soldier	2047	" He knows what he is about . You will never find him make such an ass of himself as young Cavendish did . "
76136	76141	76143	76145	the old lady	870	" Poor Mr Cavendish ! "
76147	76192	76194	76197	the Colonel 's wife	1027	" I will never blame him , poor fellow . It was all that deceitful thing laying her snares for him . For my part I never like to have anything to do with those artist kind of people — they are all adventurers , "
76388	76397	76399	76400	Mr Beverley	170	" She has a fine clear candid nature , "
77034	77037	77018	77019	Mrs Woodburn	99	" taken off "
77149	77161	77162	77162	Barbara	99	" I feel as if I should never see him more , "
77201	77230	77231	77231	Rose	108	" Never mind them , dear ; they have no feeling . We must cling together all the closer , and try to be everything to each other , "
77313	77327	77289	77289	she	108	" Dear , never mind , we will be everything to each other , "
77407	77415	77416	77416	she	108	" And he was such a dear ! "
77573	77579	77580	77581	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" As for enjoying it , "
77584	77708	77580	77581	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" that is quite a different matter . Now and then perhaps for a minute one enjoys it ; but that is not what I am thinking of . One owes something to one 's fellow - creatures , you know ; and if it made the evening go off well , I should not mind in the least to be hustled up in a corner and contradicted . To be sure , I do n't remember that it ever happened to me ; but then I have such luck ; and I am sure I give you full leave to box the Archdeacon 's ears next Thursday ; or to tell him he does not know anything in the world about art , "
77723	77729	77731	77731	Rose	108	" Thank you , Lucilla , "
77733	77780	77731	77731	Rose	108	" but I shall not come back again . I am much obliged to you . It does not do for people who have work to do . My time is all I have , and I can not afford to waste it , especially — — "
77781	77784	77786	77787	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Rose , "
77789	77869	77871	77871	Lucilla	119	" how are you ever to be an artist if you do not know life ? That is just the very reason why you ought to go out into the world ; and I do n't see , for my part , that it matters whether it is pleasant or not . To practise scales all day long is anything but pleasant , but then one has to do it , you know . I do n't blame you , "
77877	77940	77941	77942	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" You are a dear little thing , and you do n't know any better ; but I went through Political Economy , and learnt all about that;—you do n't think I choose it for the pleasure ? But you all know what is the object of my life , and I hope I am not one to shrink from my duty , "
78393	78401	78402	78402	Lucilla	119	" He gave that little nervous cough , "
78405	78435	78402	78402	Lucilla	119	" and pulled his cravat just so , and stared into his hat as if he had it all written down there ; and looked as They always look , "
78854	78858	78860	78861	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" A fortnight ! "
78863	78897	78899	78899	Lucilla	119	" how happy you must have been while you have been away!—for I assure you a month is a month at Carlingford ; and one does not get such ornaments in two weeks , "
78921	78932	78933	78933	he	115	" It is a souvenir of where I have been , "
78936	78990	78991	78992	Mr Cavendish	115	" I could imagine I had been gone two years , judging by my own feelings . I am so pleased to see that you remember how long it is . I dare say it looked a little droll running away so , but I dared not trust myself with leave - takings , "
79001	79059	79060	79060	he	115	" I have been watching over a poor friend of mine on his sick - bed . He was once very good to me , and when he sent for me I could not delay or refuse him . I found he had telegraphed for me when I got home the last Thursday evening I was here , "
79103	79133	79135	79136	Mr Cavendish	115	" I started by the night - train , and crossed the Channel while you were all fast asleep . I wonder if any one gave me a thought , "
79163	79188	79190	79191	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I can not say about that night in particular , but I am sure a great many people have given you a thought , "
79193	79229	79231	79231	Lucilla	119	" We have all been wondering what had become of you , where you were , and when you were coming back . So far as I am concerned , I have missed you dreadfully , "
79259	79268	79269	79269	he	115	" I scarcely hoped for so much happiness , "
79318	79328	79329	79329	she	119	" He is thinking of the music - stand , "
79378	79429	79431	79431	Lucilla	119	" Ah , yes — not only for the flirting , you know , which of itself is a dreadful loss ; but then you were so good in keeping the gentlemen to their duty . I missed you dreadfully — there has been nobody at all to help me , "
79480	79491	79492	79492	he	2414	" But I heard you had some distinguished strangers here , "
79512	79546	79492	79492	he	2414	" My sister wrote — that is to say I heard — I really do n't remember how I got the news ; a dean , or bishop , or something — — ? "
79547	79565	79567	79567	Lucilla	119	" Oh , yes , Mr Archdeacon Beverley ; he came precisely the night you went away , "
79569	79653	79567	79567	Lucilla	119	" Did n't you see him ? I thought you stayed till after he came into the room . A nice clergyman is very nice , you know ; but , after all , a man who has some experience in society — and we have had no music to speak of since you went away . Poor dear Barbara has had such a bad cold . In short , we have all been at sixes and sevens ; and the Archdeacon — — "
79654	79662	79664	79665	Mr Cavendish	115	" Oh , never mind the Archdeacon , "
79790	79798	79800	79801	Mr Cavendish	115	" I do n't like nice clergymen , "
79803	79827	79800	79801	Mr Cavendish	115	" especially not when it is you who find them so . If I could really flatter myself that you missed me — — "
79828	79833	79835	79835	Lucilla	119	" We all did , "
79837	79856	79835	79835	Lucilla	119	" there is no compliment about it ; and poor dear Barbara has had such a cold — — "
79857	79860	79862	79864	the unfortunate aspirant	2418	" Ah ! "
80011	80023	80024	80024	he	115	" If I could flatter myself that you had missed me , "
80027	80044	80024	80024	he	115	" you — not any one else — I might have the courage to ask — — "
80280	80292	80294	80294	Lucilla	119	" I know you have come to have lunch with me , "
80296	80331	80294	80294	Lucilla	119	" You are always so nice — just when I wanted you ; for , of course , I dared not have asked Mr Cavendish to go downstairs if I had been all alone . "
80332	80336	80338	80340	the old lady	870	" Mr Cavendish ! "
80347	80417	80419	80420	Mrs Chiley	96	" So he has really come back ! I am so glad to see you . I ca n't tell you how glad I am to see you ; and , I declare , with a beard ! Oh , you need not blush for what I say . I am old enough to be both your grandmothers , and I am so glad to see you together again ! "
80560	80567	80568	80568	he	2430	" Miss Marjoribanks is very good , "
80571	80627	80568	80568	he	2430	" and I am very glad to see you so soon after my return , Mrs Chiley — though , of course , I should have called ; but I may have to go away in a day or two ; and I am afraid I can not have the pleasure of staying to lunch . "
80628	80637	80639	80640	Mrs Chiley	96	" Oh , yes , you must stay , "
80642	80756	80639	80640	Mrs Chiley	96	" I want to hear all about it . Go away again in a day or two ? If I were Lucilla I would not let you go away . She is queen now in Carlingford , you know;—and then poor old Mr Chiltern is so ill . I hope you wo n't think of going away . They all say it would be such a pity if anything happened to him while you were away . Tell me where you have been , and what you have been doing all this time . We have missed you so dreadfully . And now you look quite like a military man with that beard . "
80757	80770	80772	80773	Mr Cavendish	115	" I have been nursing a sick friend — on the Continent , "
80775	80826	80828	80830	the embarrassed man	2434	" not very cheerful work . I am sorry about Mr Chiltern , but I can not help it . I have doubts now whether , even if he were to die , I should offer myself . I could n't give pledges to all the shopkeepers about my opinions , "
80848	80874	80837	80837	he	2434	" I must not detain you from your lunch . Good - bye , Miss Marjoribanks ; I am very sorry I ca n't stay . "
80875	80891	80893	80894	Mrs Chiley	96	" But , dear me , stop a minute — don't run away from us , "
80896	80928	80930	80932	the old lady	870	" Come and talk it all over with the Colonel , there is a dear — and do n't do anything rash . Good - bye , if you will go , "
80957	80969	80971	80972	Mrs Chiley	96	" Did I come in at a wrong time , Lucilla ? "
80977	81004	80971	80972	Mrs Chiley	96	" Have you refused him , my dear ? What is the matter ? I am so dreadfully afraid I came in at the wrong time . "
81005	81010	81012	81012	Lucilla	119	" Dear Mrs Chiley , "
81015	81065	81012	81012	Lucilla	119	" you can never come in at a wrong time ; and it is just as well , on the whole , that he didn't — for I was not prepared to give him any answer . I am sure , on the contrary , it was quite providential , "
81214	81224	81225	81227	the old lady	870	" If you had only said you were engaged , "
81230	81280	81282	81283	Mrs Chiley	96	" or not at home — or anything , Lucilla ! You know , you need never stand on ceremony with me . No wonder he looked as if he could eat me ! Poor fellow ! and I dare say he has gone away with his heart full , "
81308	81352	81354	81357	the kind old woman	2441	" Poor dear boy ! He need not have been so put out with an old woman like me . He might have known if he had given me the least hint , or even a look , I would have gone away , "
81359	81409	81354	81357	the kind old woman	2441	" But you must be all the kinder to him when he comes back , Lucilla . And , my dear , if I were you , I would stay in this afternoon . He is sure to come back , and I would not keep him in pain . "
81410	81420	81421	81421	Lucilla	119	" I do n't think he will come back , "
81575	81588	81589	81589	she	870	" I ought to be on the Archdeacon 's side , Lucilla , "
81598	81658	81589	81589	she	870	" I know I ought , when it was I that brought him here : but I ca n't help feeling for the other , my dear . He always was so nice — a great deal nicer , to my way of thinking , than Mr Beverley ; not to say but that the Archdeacon is very agreeable , "
81712	81723	81724	81726	the old lady	870	" I never blamed Mr Cavendish about that Lake girl , "
81729	81816	81724	81726	the old lady	870	" It was not his fault , poor young man . I know he was always devoted to you in his heart ; and to think he should come here the very first place as soon as he returned ! I only wish I had had one of my headaches this morning , my dear , to keep me indoors for an old Malaprop . I do indeed , Lucilla . It would have served me right , and I should not have minded the pain . "
81817	81829	81831	81832	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" But indeed I do n't wish anything of the sort , "
81834	81934	81831	81832	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I would not have the best man in the world at the cost of one of those dreadful headaches of yours . It is so good of you to say so ; but you know very well it is not that sort of thing I am thinking of . If I were to go off and marry just now , after all that has been done to the drawing - room and everything , I should feel as if I were swindling papa ; and it is the object of my life to be a comfort to him . "
81935	81941	81943	81944	Mrs Chiley	96	" Yes , my dear , "
81946	82011	81943	81944	Mrs Chiley	96	" but we must not neglect your own interest for all that . I think it is most likely he will come this evening . He has just come from the Continent , you know , where people do make calls in the evening . I meant to have asked you to come down to us , as we shall be all alone — — "
82012	82022	82024	82024	Lucilla	119	" All alone ? Then where is the Archdeacon ? "
82026	82044	82046	82047	Mrs Chiley	96	" He has gone out to Sir John 's for a day or two , my dear , "
82066	82190	82050	82050	she	96	" He left word with me for you that he would be sure to be back before Thursday , but seeing Mr Cavendish when I came in made me forget all about it . He would be quite distressed , poor man ! if he thought I had forgotten to give you his message . I wo n't ask you now to come down and cheer me up a little , Lucilla . I think poor Mr Cavendish is sure to come this evening , and I will not stand in his way again . But , my dear , you must send me a little note after he has been . Now promise . I shall be quite in suspense all night . "
82191	82204	82206	82207	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Dear Mrs Chiley , I do n't think he will come , "
82209	82268	82206	82207	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" For my part , I think it was providential your coming to - day — for I am sure I do n't know what I should have said to him . And it is so odd the Archdeacon should be away just at this moment . I feel quite sure he will not come to - night . "
82269	82278	82280	82281	Mrs Chiley	96	" There is nothing odd about the Archdeacon , "
82283	82316	82317	82319	the old lady	870	" It was for to - day he was asked , you know ; that is simple enough . If you are sure that you prefer the Archdeacon , my dear — — "
82350	82363	82365	82367	the injured maiden	2450	" I hope you do n't think I prefer any of them , "
82369	82406	82408	82408	Lucilla	119	" If I had been thinking of that sort of thing , you know , I need never have come home . If they would only let one do one 's duty in peace and quiet , "
82762	82765	82745	82745	her	99	" taking off "
82777	82785	82786	82786	she	99	" So you did not do it , "
82789	82848	82786	82786	she	99	" Why did n't you do it ? when you knew so much depended upon it ! You know I did not wish for it myself , at first . But now since this man has come , and you have got into such a panic , and never will have the courage to face it out — — "
82849	82861	82863	82864	Mr Cavendish	115	" How can I have the courage to face it out ? "
82870	82898	82863	82864	Mr Cavendish	115	" It is all very easy for a woman to speak who has only to criticise other people . If you had to do it yourself — — "
82899	82907	82909	82910	the sister	2470	" Ah , if I only had ! "
82912	83000	82909	82910	the sister	2470	" You may be sure I would not make so much fuss . After all , what is there to do ? Take your place in society , which you have worked for and won as honestly as anybody ever won it , and look another man in the face who is not half so clever nor so sensible as you are . Why , what can he say ? If I only could do it , you may be sure I should not lose any time . "
83001	83004	83006	83007	Mr Cavendish	115	" Yes , "
83013	83055	83010	83010	his	115	" To be sure , you 're a mimic — you can assume any part you like ; but I am not so clever . I tell you again , the only thing I can do is to go away — — "
83056	83063	83065	83066	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Run away , you mean , "
83068	83107	83109	83110	the mimic	883	" I should be foolish , indeed , if I were trusting to your cleverness to assume a part . My dear good brother , you would find it impossible to put yourself sufficiently in sympathy with another , "
83135	83150	83152	83153	Mr Cavendish	115	" Oh , for Heaven 's sake , Nelly , no foolery just now , "
83155	83186	83152	83153	Mr Cavendish	115	" I do n't understand how you can be so heartless . To mimic a man who has my position , my reputation , my very existence in his hands ! "
83187	83193	83195	83196	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Have you murdered anybody ? "
83202	83263	83265	83266	the mimic	883	" Have you robbed anybody ? If you have , I can understand all this stuff . He is the very man to mimic , on the contrary . I 'd like to let you see him as he was on that famous occasion when he delivered his opinions on art in Lucilla 's drawing - room . Look here , "
83300	83312	83314	83316	the exasperated brother	2474	" I think you must have vowed to drive me crazy , "
83318	83344	83314	83316	the exasperated brother	2474	" Put aside for once that confounded vanity of yours — as if a man had always leisure to look at your playing the fool . "
83403	83418	83419	83419	she	99	" You have always the leisure to play the fool yourselves , you men , "
83422	83542	83543	83543	she	99	" Vanity , indeed ! as if it were not simply to show you that one can laugh at him without being stricken with thunder . But leave that if you like . You know quite well if you married Lucilla Marjoribanks that there would be no more about it . There could be no more about it . Why , all Grange Lane would be in a sort of way pledged to you . I do n't mean to say I am attached to Lucilla , but you used to be , or to give yourself out for being . You flirted with her dreadfully in the winter , I remember , when those terrible Woodburns were here , "
83550	83571	83543	83543	she	99	" If you married Lucilla and got into Parliament , you might laugh at all the archdeacons in the world . "
83572	83583	83585	83587	the reluctant wooer	2476	" It is very easy for a woman to talk , "
83590	83603	83605	83606	his sister	577	" I can tell you something it is not easy to do , "
83608	83742	83605	83606	his sister	577	" It is frightfully hard for a woman to stand by and see a set of men making a mess of things , and not to dare to say a word till all is spoiled . What is this Archdeacon , I would like to know , or what could he say ? If you only would have the least courage , and look him in the face , he would be disabled . As if no one had ever heard of mistaken identity before ? And in the meantime go and see Lucilla , and get her consent . I ca n't do that for you ; but I could do a great deal of the rest , if you would only have a little pluck and not give in like this . "
83743	83751	83753	83755	the unfortunate man	360	" A little pluck , by George ! "
83767	83786	83787	83787	he	360	" I am not in love with Lucilla Marjoribanks , and I do n't want to marry her , "
83827	83840	83841	83841	she	99	" Perhaps you will tell me who you are in love with , "
83845	83960	83962	83963	Mrs Woodburn	99	" but I did not ask to be taken into your confidence in such an interesting way . What I wish to know is , whether you want a wife who will keep your position for you . I am not in the least fond of her , but she is very clever . Whether you want the support of all the best people in Carlingford , and connections that would put all that to silence , and a real position of your own which nobody could interfere with — that is what I want to know , Harry ; as for the sentimental part , I am not so much interested about that , "
84024	84036	84037	84037	he	1449	" You said once that Woodburn was necessary to your happiness , "
84048	84062	84037	84037	he	1449	" though I ca n't say I saw it , for my part . "
84063	84067	84068	84068	she	99	" Did I ? "
84079	84154	84156	84157	Mrs Woodburn	99	" I saw what was necessary on another score , as you do n't seem to do . When a man has nobody belonging to him , it is connections he ought to try for : and Lucilla has very good connections ; and it would be as good as securing the support of Grange Lane . Do it for my sake , Harry , if you wo n't do it for your own , "
84165	84220	84156	84157	Mrs Woodburn	99	" If you were to let things be said , and give people an advantage , think what would become of me . Woodburn would not mind so much if somebody else were involved ; but oh , Harry ! if he should find out he had been cheated , and he only — — "
84221	84240	84242	84243	Mr Cavendish	115	" He was not cheated ! You were always a great deal too good for him , Nelly , "
84253	84267	84242	84243	Mr Cavendish	115	" and as for his friends and family , and all that — — "
84268	84279	84281	84282	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Oh , please , do n't speak of them , "
84288	84309	84281	84282	Mrs Woodburn	99	" but there are only two of us in the world ; and , Harry , for my sake — — "
84339	84357	84358	84358	he	115	" I told you I had almost done it , when that confounded old woman came in , "
84361	84370	84358	84358	he	115	" that could not be called my fault ? "
84371	84381	84383	84384	the mimic	883	" And she said she was both your grandmothers , "
84398	84421	84383	84384	the mimic	883	" I know how she did it . She ca n't be there still , you know — go now and try . "
84422	84434	84436	84437	her brother	1449	" Let alone a little ; do n't hurry a fellow , "
84442	84460	84436	84437	her brother	1449	" a man ca n't move himself up to the point of proposing twice in one day . "
84461	84473	84475	84476	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Then promise that you will do it to - morrow , "
84478	84512	84475	84476	Mrs Woodburn	99	" I shall have to go in , for there is somebody coming . Harry , before I go , promise that you will do it to - morrow , for my sake . "
84513	84518	84520	84521	Mr Cavendish	115	" Oh , bother ! "

87617	87626	87628	87629	Mr Lake	93	" My dear , what does this mean ? "
87631	87656	87658	87658	Rose	108	" It means , papa , that she has encouraged him to come , and invited him in , and been singing to him , "
87660	87774	87776	87776	Barbara	99	" To think she should be one of us , and have no proper pride ! If he was fond of her , he would tell her so , and ask your permission ; but she is laying herself out to please him , and is content that they should all jeer at her in Lucilla 's parties , and say she is trying to catch him . I thought I could have died of shame when I saw him here to - night ; and compromising you , as if that was why you were so civil . If it were for her good , do you think I would ever interfere ? "
87840	87848	87850	87850	Barbara	99	" It was all your coming in , "
87852	87902	87904	87907	the injured young woman	2568	" if you had only had the sense to see it . That was what he meant . If I was singing , it was just to pass the time ; I know that was what he came for . And you to send him away with your airs ! "
87943	87946	87947	87947	he	2569	" Girls , "
87955	88021	88023	88025	the poor man	2570	" this is all perfectly new to me . I do n't understand . If Mr Cavendish , or — or any one , wishes to pay his addresses to my daughter , it is , of course , his business to apply to me in the first place . Barbara , do n't cry . You know how I dislike to hear you cry , "
88032	88077	88079	88081	the unfortunate widower	2571	" Do n't make a fuss , Rose ; for Heaven 's sake , girls , ca n't you say at once what you mean , and do n't worry me to death ? Ah , if your poor mother had but been spared ! "
89195	89247	89191	89192	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" Dearest Mrs Chiley,—I never expected him to come , and he has not . I dare say he never meant it . I am so glad . It was Providence that sent you at that particular moment to - day.—Always in haste , with fond love , your most truly affectionate "
89250	89607	89248	89248	Lucilla	119	" And when she had sent Thomas with this note , Miss Marjoribanks felt her mind relieved . Not that it had been much distressed before , but when she had put it in black and white , and concluded upon it , her satisfaction was more complete ; and no such troublous thoughts as those which disturbed the hero of this day 's transactions — no such wild tears as poured from the eyes of Barbara Lake — interfered with the maidenly composure of Lucilla 's meditations . Notwithstanding all that people say to the contrary , there is a power in virtue which makes itself felt in such an emergency . Miss Marjoribanks could turn from Mr Cavendish , who had thus failed to fulfil the demands of his position , to the serene idea of the Archdeacon , with that delightful consciousness of having nothing to reproach herself with , which is balm to a well - regulated mind . She had done her duty , whatever happened . She had not injudiciously discouraged nor encouraged the possible Member for Carlingford ; and at the same time she was perfectly free to turn her attention to the possible Bishop ; and neither in one case nor the other could anybody say that she had gone a step too far , or committed herself in any way whatsoever . While these consoling reflections were passing through Lucilla 's mind , Dr Marjoribanks came upstairs , as had grown to be his custom lately . Sometimes he took a cup of tea , though it was against his principles , and sometimes he only sat by while his daughter had hers , and amused himself with her chat before he went to bed . He was later than usual to - night , and naturally the tea - tray had disappeared some time before . As for Lucilla , she did not for a moment permit her own preoccupation to interfere with the discharge of her immediate duty , which was unquestionably to be amusing and agreeable , and a comfort to her dear papa . "
89617	89622	89609	89609	you	2601	" said the Doctor . "
89657	89658	89646	89646	he	115	" "
89671	89689	89659	89659	He	115	" said Lucilla , with that largeness of geographical expression which is natural to the insular mind . "
89699	89764	89697	89697	papa	295	" added Miss Marjoribanks , with confiding simplicity ; and it was beautiful to see how the daughter looked up into her father 's face , with that angelic confidence in his knowledge on all subjects which is so rarely to be met with in the present generation . But it was not a question to which the Doctor found it easy to respond . "
89770	89775	89776	89776	He	115	" said Dr Marjoribanks . "
89814	89838	89839	89839	I	0	" said the philosophical old Scotchman ; and there , as it appeared , he was quite content to let the matter drop . "
89852	89856	89857	89858	The Archdeacon	170	" said Lucilla . "
89894	89895	89890	89891	the Cavendishes	160	" "
89914	89919	89907	89907	you	0	" said the Doctor . "
90007	90012	89995	89995	Nobody	4434	" said Dr Marjoribanks . "
90048	90049	90050	90051	Dear papa	303	" "
90053	90057	90050	90051	Dear papa	303	" said Lucilla , "
90114	90120	90123	90123	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added prudently . "
90156	90163	90145	90145	my	0	" Dr Marjoribanks indulged in a faint "
90166	90624	90145	90145	my	0	" under his breath , as he lighted his candle ; for , as has been already said , he was not a man to feel so keenly as some men might have felt the enthusiasm of filial devotion which beautified Lucilla 's life . But at the same time he had that respect for his daughter 's genius , which only experience could have impressed upon him ; and he did not venture , or rather he did not think it necessary , to enter into any further explanations . Dr Marjoribanks did not in the least degree share the nervousness of Mr Cavendish , who was afraid of deceiving Lucilla . As for her father , he felt a consoling conviction that she was quite able to conduct her own affairs , and would do him no discredit in any engagements she might form . And at the same time he was amused by the idea that he might be swindled in respect to the drawing - room , if she married at this early moment . He took it for wit , when it was the most solid and sensible reality ; but then , fortunately , the points in which he misapprehended her redounded as much to Lucilla 's credit , as those in which he seized her meaning clearest , so that on every side there was something to be gained . And when Miss Marjoribanks too retired to her maidenly chamber , a sentiment of general content and satisfaction filled her mind . It is true that for the moment she had experienced a natural womanly vexation to see a proposal nipped in the bud . It annoyed her not so much on personal as on general principles ; for Lucilla was aware that nothing could be more pernicious to a man than when thus brought to the very point to be thrown back again , and never permitted to produce that delicate bloom of his affections . It was like preventing a rose from putting forth its flowers , a cruelty equally prejudicial to the plant and to the world . But when this pang of wounded philanthropy was over , Miss Marjoribanks felt in her heart that it was Providence that had sent Mrs Chiley at that special moment . There was no telling what embarrassments , what complications she might not have got into , had Mr Cavendish succeeded in unbosoming himself . No doubt Lucilla had a confidence that , whatever difficulties there might have been , she would have extricated herself from them with satisfaction and even éclat , but still it was better to avoid the necessity . Thus it was with a serene conviction that "
90631	90982	90983	90983	I	0	" that Miss Marjoribanks betook herself to her peaceful slumbers . There are so many people in the world who hold , or are tempted to hold , an entirely different opinion , that it is pleasant to linger over the spectacle of a mind so perfectly well regulated . Very different were the sentiments of Mr Cavendish , who could not sleep for the ghosts that kept tugging at him on every side ; and those of Barbara Lake , who felt that for her too the flower of her hero 's love had been nipped in the bud . But , to be sure , it is only natural that goodness and self - control should have the best of it sometimes even in this uncertain world . The Archdeacon returned to Carlingford before Thursday , as he had anticipated ; but in the interval Mr Cavendish had not recovered his courage so far as to renew his visit to Miss Marjoribanks , or to face the man who had alarmed him so much . Everybody in Grange Lane remarked at the time how worried poor Mrs Woodburn looked . Her eyes lost their brightness , which some people thought was the only beauty she had , and her nerves and her temper both failed her , no one could tell why . The personal sketches she made at this moment were truculent and bitter to an unheard - of degree . She took off Mr Beverley with a savage force which electrified her audience , and put words into his mouth which everybody admitted were exactly like him , if he could ever be imagined to have fallen into the extraordinary circumstances in which the mimic placed him . In short , Mrs Woodburn made a little drama out of the Archdeacon . Mr Beverley , of course , knew nothing about this , and showed some surprise now and then at the restrained laughter which he heard in the corners ; but when anybody spoke of Mrs Woodburn , he showed an instinctive want of confidence . "
90996	91068	90983	90983	I	0	" he said , which was certainly the very reverse of her deliverance upon him . To tell the truth , she had rather studied him too much , and gave too keen an edge to his characteristic qualities , as is natural to all literary portraiture , and even went so far that , in the end , people began to ask whether she had any personal spite against him . "
91075	91090	91069	91069	She	2624	" Mr Woodburn said , when he heard some faint echo of this suggestion . "
91163	91468	91153	91153	everybody	300	" the simple man said , with a little natural pride ; for in his heart he was vain of his fashionable brother - in - law . As for Mr Cavendish himself , it began to be understood that he was with a friend who was sick , on the Continent ; and soon — for news had a wonderful tendency to increase and grow bigger as it spread in Grange Lane — that his friend was dying , and that a probable large increase of fortune to the popular favourite would be the result , which was an idea that did credit to the imagination of Carlingford . He had disappeared completely once more after the eventful day which we have described , carrying out in the fullest way Lucilla 's prediction , but striking Barbara Lake with bitter disappointment . Miss Marjoribanks had a great many things to occupy her , but Barbara had nothing except the humble duty of looking after her little brothers and sisters , and attending to her father 's comfort , which had never been occupations particularly to her mind . And then Barbara was aware that , if she neglected her duties , Rose , on her return from the School of Design , would do them , though with a fierce little outbreak of indignation , which the elder sister felt she could bear ; and accordingly , she did little else but brood over his sudden disappearance , and spend her time at the window looking for his return . Lucilla conducted herself , as might have been expected , in a much more rational and dignified manner . She made herself very agreeable to the Archdeacon , who unbended very much , and grew very nice , as Mrs Chiley herself allowed . "
91481	92039	91474	91474	I	0	" the old lady said . He certainly had a very free way of talking , and was ready to discuss anything , and was not approved of by Mr Bury . But still he had very good connections and a nice position , and had always a chance of being Bishop of Carlingford ; and in marriage it is well known that one never can have everything one wants . So that , on the whole , even Mrs Chiley did not see what difference his opinions made , so far as Lucilla was concerned . When Miss Marjoribanks went down to Colonel Chiley 's in the evening and made tea for the old people , like a daughter of the house , Mr Beverley was always disposed to go over to the enemy , as the old Colonel said . No doubt he had enough of Colonel Chiley , who had not received a new idea into his mind since the battle of Waterloo , and did not see what people had to do with such nonsense . And then the Archdeacon would very often walk home with the young visitor . During this time , as was natural , Mr Beverley heard Mr Cavendish 's name a hundred times , and regretted , like all the world , that so eminent a member of the Carlingford commonwealth should be absent during his visit ; but , at the same time , Lucilla took great care to avoid all personalities , and kept a discreet silence even about the gifts and accomplishments of her almost - lover . Mrs Chiley sighed , poor soul , when she saw how her young friend avoided this subject , and thought sometimes that he was forgotten , sometimes that the poor dear was breaking her heart for him ; but it is needless to say that neither of these suppositions was in the least true . And then it began to be considered rather odd in Carlingford that the Archdeacon should pay such a long visit . Mrs Chiley no doubt was very kind and hospitable , and exceedingly glad to receive such a distinguished clergyman ; but when a man has been six weeks in any one 's house , and shows no inclination of going , it is natural that people should feel a little surprised . His visitation was over , and he had dined with everybody , and studied the place and its characteristics , and entered into everything that was going on . The only thing , indeed , that he did not seem to think of , was going away . If it had been Mr Cavendish , the chances are that he would have made himself so much one of the family , that his departure would have been felt as a domestic calamity ; but the Archdeacon was very different from Mr Cavendish . So long as he was in the house it was impossible to forget either his position or his ways of thinking , or the absence of any real connection between himself and his hosts . He did not combat or contradict anybody , but he would give a faint smile when the Colonel uttered his old - fashioned sentiments , which drove the old soldier frantic . "
92054	92126	92127	92127	You	2630	" Colonel Chiley said ; while , on the other hand , the Archdeacon was quite ready to enter into the young people 's absurd theories , and discuss the very Bible itself , as if that were a book to be discussed . As for the Rector , he turned his head away when he passed Colonel Chiley 's door , and Miss Bury made visits of condolence and sympathy . "
92140	92169	92127	92127	You	2630	" the Rector 's sister would say , though naturally without any distinct explanation of her meaning ; and then she would look at Mrs Chiley and sigh . "
92181	92197	92172	92172	I	0	" Mrs Chiley answered , not willing to let down the prestige of her guest . "
92235	92236	92231	92232	Mary Chiley	129	" "
92242	92247	92231	92232	Mary Chiley	129	" said Miss Bury . "
92283	92284	92274	92274	she	873	" "
92293	92302	92274	92274	she	873	" said Mrs Chiley , a little doubtfully ; "
92378	92379	92359	92360	the Colonel	595	" "
92388	92398	92380	92380	One	4465	" said Miss Bury , in her instructive way . "
92407	92411	92399	92399	I	0	" she added ; "
92442	92443	92421	92421	I	0	" "
92453	92459	92421	92421	I	0	" said Mrs Chiley briskly . "
92500	92529	92494	92494	he	5143	" said the imprudent old woman . And this was precisely what Miss Bury wanted , as any one of acute perceptions might have seen from the first . "
92539	92556	92494	92494	he	5143	" said the Rector 's sister , with a sigh , pressing Mrs Chiley 's hand . "
92606	92718	92596	92596	I	0	" said Miss Bury , with a look that made the old lady nervous in spite of herself . Thus , notwithstanding all her sense of the duties of hospitality , and her anxiety about Lucilla 's interests , she could not but feel that it would be rather a relief to get so formidable a guest fairly out of the house . It is uncomfortable , it must be allowed , to entertain in your house anybody , particularly a clergyman of whom your Rector does not approve ; and there could be no doubt that the Archdeacon was not like the clergymen that Mrs Chiley had been accustomed to . "
92727	92771	92720	92720	he	5143	" she said to herself , by way of conciliating her own weariness with her visitor 's advantage and the interests of Lucilla . But notwithstanding these reflections on Mrs Chiley 's part and notwithstanding the Colonel 's less amiable growl , uttered every morning—"Does
92780	92811	92812	92815	that parson of yours"—whereas	5527	away?"—the Archdeacon showed no intention of budging . It was poor Mrs Chiley who had all the brunt to bear , to exhaust herself in civilities and to be upbraided with "
92815	93104	92812	92815	that parson of yours"—whereas	5527	yours"—whereas he was not in the least her parson , nor even the kind of man she approved of as a clergyman . All this , however , the brave old woman bore with fortitude for Lucilla 's sake : certainly it must be Lucilla who kept him in Carlingford — if it were not something else . Things were in this condition , Mr Cavendish having again disappeared into utter darkness , and Carlingford beginning to enter warmly into the question whether or not Mr Beverley was paying attention to Lucilla , when it happened to Miss Marjoribanks one morning to meet the Archdeacon in a little lane running between Grove Street and Grange Lane . Opening from this lane was a little door in the wall , which admitted to a little garden very bright with flowers of the simplest old - fashioned kinds , with a little house planted at its extremity , which had pretensions to be an old - fashioned and quasi - rural cottage , on the score of being very rickety , uncomfortable , and badly arranged . But it must be a very impracticable erection indeed which does not look tolerable under the bright sunshine on a summer noon , at the end of a pretty garden where children are playing and birds singing , and a woman or two about . Lucilla was standing at the door of this little closed - up hermitage , almost filling up the opening with her crisp summer draperies , and affording only a very partial and tempting glimpse of its flowers and shrubs and whitewashed walls inside ; and when Mr Beverley came up to Miss Marjoribanks he felt his curiosity excited . "
93116	93148	92812	92815	that parson of yours"—whereas	5527	" said the Archdeacon ; and he made a dead stop before the door , not knowing any more than any other blind mortal what he was going to find inside . "
93157	93162	93149	93149	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
93224	93225	93212	93212	I	0	" "
93230	93293	93228	93228	children	815	" said Mr Beverley , with a doubtful air ; for , to tell the truth , he had come to the age at which men think it best to avoid children , unless , indeed , they happen to have a personal interest in them ; and he stretched his neck a little to see in over Miss Marjoribanks 's head . "
93307	93311	93303	93305	a pretty governess	2654	" said Lucilla . "
93398	93399	93391	93391	I	0	" "
93408	93413	93400	93400	You	2657	" said Mr Beverley ; "
93467	93468	93469	93469	I	0	" "
93479	93483	93484	93484	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
93530	93531	93519	93519	she	2665	" "
93543	93548	93557	93557	them	2667	" said the Archdeacon ; "
93627	93658	93659	93661	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" said Mr Beverley ; and he fixed his eyes on the ground and entered meditatively , without looking where he was going , in his Broad - Church way . "
93666	93687	93659	93661	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" said Lucilla , who was a little puzzled for the moment , and did not know what to say . "
93699	94424	93659	93661	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" said the Archdeacon . He spoke in a tone which settled the question , and from which there was no appeal ; and no doubt what he said was perfectly true , though it was not a very distinct characterisation . Thus they went in together into the bright little garden , thinking of nothing in particular , and loitering as people do who do not know what is coming . There was something that morning in Mr Beverley 's tone and manner which struck Lucilla as something more than usual . She was not a young woman to attach undue importance to looks and tones ; but the Archdeacon 's manner was so softened and mellowed , and his eyes had so much expression in them , and he looked at Lucilla with such marked regard , that it was impossible for her not to recognise that a crisis might be approaching . To be sure , it was not by any means so near as that crisis manqué which had so lately passed over her head in respect to Mr Cavendish . But still Miss Marjoribanks could not but remark the signs of a slowly approaching and most likely more important climax ; and as she remarked it , Lucilla naturally by anticipation prepared herself for the coming event that thus threw a shadow upon her . She did not make up her mind to accept Mr Beverley any more than she had made up her mind to accept Mr Cavendish ; but she thought it only her duty to him and to herself , and to society in general , to take his claims into full consideration . And no doubt , if these claims had seemed to her sufficiently strong to merit such a reward , Miss Marjoribanks had it in her to marry the Archdeacon , and make him an admirable wife , though she was not at the present moment , so far as she was aware , absolutely what foolish people call in love with him . At the same time , she made herself all the more agreeable to Mr Beverley from her sense of the dawn of tenderness with which he regarded her . And in this way they went up the broad central path which traversed the little garden , neither looking to the left nor the right , but presenting all that appearance of being occupied with each other , which , especially to a female observer , is so easy of interpretation . For , to be sure , the Archdeacon had not the remotest idea into whose house he was going , nor who it was whom he was about to see . But as it happened , Lucilla 's protégée , who had seen better days , had just finished one of her lessons , and sent her little pupils out into the garden . She was preparing for the next little class , when , raising her eyes accidentally , she saw Miss Marjoribanks coming through the garden with the Archdeacon by her side . She was the same person whom Mr Bury had brought to Lucilla with the idea of recommending her to Dr Marjoribanks as a companion and chaperone for his daughter ; but since then Mrs Mortimer 's appearance had considerably changed . She had grown younger by ten years during the period of comparative comfort and tranquillity which Lucilla 's active help and championship had procured for her . Her house , and her garden , and her little scholars , and the bloom on her cheeks , and the filling - up of her worn frame , were all Miss Marjoribanks 's doing . In the intervals of her legislative cares Lucilla had run about all over Carlingford searching for pupils , and at the same moment had cut and stitched and arranged , and papered walls , and planted flower - beds , for the feeble creature thus thrown upon her . This was a side of Lucilla 's character which certainly she did nothing to hide from the public , but which , at the same time , she never made any fuss about ; and it was an endless pleasure to her to find a protégée so perfectly content to be "
94428	94629	93659	93661	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" and do as she was told to do . It was thus that the poor faded widow , who was sensitive and had feelings , and forgot herself so far as to faint , or nearly to faint , just at the most unlucky moment possible , when the Rector 's character and dignity demanded superior self - control on her part , had found her youth again and her good looks under Lucilla 's shadow . When she looked up and saw the two approaching , Mrs Mortimer 's first impulse was to smile at the conjunction ; but the next moment she had dropped the books out of her hands , and was standing gazing out like a woman in a dream , with the colour all gone out of her cheeks , and even out of her lips , in the surprise of the moment . It was only surprise and a kind of dismay ; it was not terror , like that which Mr Cavendish had exhibited at the same apparition . She dropped into her chair without knowing it , and probably would have fainted this time also , if something more urgent than mere "
94631	94985	94993	94993	you	2673	" had not roused her up . As it was , it happened very happily for her that she had thus a little preparation . When she saw that her patroness was leading Mr Beverley up to the door , and that in a minute more he would inevitably be brought to her very side , Mrs Mortimer roused up all her strength . She gathered up her books in her hand without knowing very well what she was doing , and , taking virtue from necessity , went desperately out to meet them . It was Miss Marjoribanks who first saw her , white and tottering , leaning against the trellis of the little porch , and Lucilla could not but give a little cry of alarm and wonder . What kind of man could this be , who thus struck down another victim without even so much as a glance ? It was just then that the Archdeacon raised his eyes , and saw standing before him , among the faded roses , the woman whom he had been approaching so indifferently — the faded existence that had seen better days . He saw her , and he stood stock - still , as if it was she who was the basilisk , and the look of pleased interest went out of his face in a moment . In that moment he had become as unconscious of the presence of Lucilla as if he had never in his life softened his voice to her ear , or talked nonsense to please her . His eyes did not seem big enough to take in the figure which stood shrinking and looking at him in the porch . Then he made one long step forward , and took hold of her sleeve — not her hand — as if to convince himself that it was something real he saw . He showed no joy , nor satisfaction , nor anything but sheer amaze and wonder , at this unexpected appearance , for he had not had time to prepare himself as she had . "
94995	95154	95157	95157	you	2673	" he said , in a voice that sounded as different from the voice with which he had been speaking to Lucilla , as if years had elapsed between the two . And it would be vain to describe the amazement and singular sense that the earth had suddenly given way under her feet , with which Miss Marjoribanks stood by and looked on . Miss Marjoribanks was naturally the first to recover her senses in this emergency . Even she , self - possessed as she was , felt the natural giddiness inseparable from such a strange reversal of the position . But she did not lose her head like the others . She looked at the widow standing white and tremulous in the shadow of the little porch , and on the Archdeacon , whose manly countenance had paled to a corresponding colour . A man does not seize a woman by the sleeve and ask , "
95159	95270	95157	95157	you	2673	" without some reason for an address so destitute of ordinary courtesy ; and Lucilla was sufficiently versed in such matters to know that so rude and startling an accost could be only addressed to some one whose presence set the speaker 's heart beating , and quickened the blood in his veins . It was odd , to say the least , after the way in which he had just been speaking to herself ; but Miss Marjoribanks , as has been already said , was not the woman to lose her head . She recovered herself with the second breath she drew , and took her natural place . "
95284	95288	95289	95290	Mrs Mortimer	133	" said Lucilla . "
95318	95927	95312	95312	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added , nodding pleasantly to the Archdeacon — and she went away to the other end of the garden , calling to the children with that self - possession which is the gift only of great minds . But when Lucilla found herself at a safe distance , and saw the Archdeacon stoop to go in under the porch , it can not be denied that her mind was moved by the sight . It was she who had seen after the putting - up of that trellis round that porch , and the arrangement of the wistaria , which had been sprawling all over the front of the house uncared for . If there was any place in the world where she should have been free from such a shock , it certainly should have been here , in this spot , which she had , so to speak , created . Naturally the unfitness of these surroundings to witness a revolution so unlooked - for and disagreeable struck Lucilla . If she had to be again humiliated , and to submit once more to see another preferred to herself , it certainly should have been under other circumstances . When we admit that such a thought did pass through the mind of Miss Marjoribanks , it will prove to all who know her that Lucilla found her position sufficiently aggravating . She had exerted herself for Mrs Mortimer as nobody else in Carlingford would have exerted themselves . She had not only found pupils and a means of living for the widow , which , perhaps , a committee of ladies might have done at the end of a year , had it been put into their hands ; but Miss Marjoribanks had done it at once , and had taken charge of that timid and maladroit individual herself , and set her up , and done everything for her . It was Dr Marjoribanks 's gardener , under Lucilla 's orders , who had arranged and planted the garden , and trained the embowering foliage which had just brushed the Archdeacon 's clerical hat as he went in ; and in the act of refurnishing her drawing - room , Miss Marjoribanks had managed to procure , without costing anybody anything except a little trouble , as she herself said , many accessories , which gave an air of comfort to the little parlour , in which , no doubt , at that moment , Mr Beverley and Mrs Mortimer were explaining themselves . Lucilla had a great deal too much good sense to upbraid anybody with ingratitude , or even to make any claim upon that slippery quality ; but she knew at the same time that the widow was the very last person from whom a new discomfiture should come , and that to enter in under that trellis when he left her was , on the Archdeacon 's part , an aggravation of the change in his sentiments which it was difficult to bear . She walked along the garden path very briskly under the influence of these thoughts , and it was not in nature to do otherwise than snub the children when she joined them . Lucilla was a woman of genius , but she was not faultless ; and when she found Ethelinda and Ethelfreda Lake , the two twins , the one with her clean frock all muddy and stained , the other with the front breadth torn right up the middle , it is scarcely to be wondered at if she lost her patience . "
95934	95938	95928	95928	You	2677	" she said , "
95969	96206	95963	95963	Barbara	120	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with a fine intonation of scorn , of which the culprits were insensible ; and she gave Ethelinda a shake , who was sitting on the wet ground , all muddy with recent watering , and who , besides , was the one who most resembled Barbara . When this temporary ebullition had taken place , Lucilla began gradually to right herself . It was a grand sight , if anybody had been there to witness it , or if anybody could have seen into Miss Marjoribanks 's maiden bosom ; but the spectacle of a great mind thus recovering its balance is one which can rarely be visible except in its results . While she set the children to rights , and represented to Mrs Mortimer 's little servant , who was in the garden furtively on a pretence of cabbages , the extreme folly , and indeed idiocy , of letting them get to the water and make a mess of themselves , Lucilla was in reality coming to herself . Perhaps she spoke with a little more energy than usual ; but the offenders were so well aware of their guilt , and so thoroughly satisfied of the justice of the reproof addressed to them , that no other explanation was necessary ; and , little by little , Miss Marjoribanks felt herself restored to her natural calm . "
96217	96221	96209	96209	I	0	" she said ; "
96248	96249	96225	96225	anybody	313	" "
96271	96277	96280	96280	she	185	" said the little maid . "
96307	96392	96300	96300	nobody	4434	" said Mary Jane . There was something even in that small and humble testimony to Lucilla 's sovereignty which helped on the process which was operating in her mind . She regained bit by bit that serene self - consciousness which places the spirit above the passing vexations of the world . What did it matter what other people might be doing or saying ? Was not she still Lucilla Marjoribanks ? and when one had said that , one had said all . "
96405	96409	96396	96396	you	2683	" said Lucilla ; "
96490	96525	96479	96479	I	0	" Saying which , Miss Marjoribanks herself saw the hats brought out , and the little scholars sent away . She took matters into her own hand with the confidence of a superior nature . "
96546	96800	96534	96534	she	2689	" Lucilla said magnanimously to herself ; and she again made the tour of the garden , inspecting everything , to see that all was in order . With every step that she took , Miss Marjoribanks became more and more herself . As we have already said , it was a grand and inspiring sight ; but then , to be sure , as in the former case , her affections , fortunately , were not engaged . She was not in love with the Archdeacon , any more than she had been in love with Mr Cavendish;—though it is true , love is not everything . And to think how he had been looking and talking not much more than half an hour ago , and to reflect that now he had most likely forgotten her very existence , and was explaining himself , and placing that position which would have just suited Lucilla at the feet of the object of her bounty , was enough to have driven a young woman of ordinary mind half out of her senses with disgust and indignation . But , fortunately , Lucilla 's mind was not an ordinary one ; and every step she took round the garden restored her more and more entirely to herself . Instead of conceiving any jealous dislike to Mrs Mortimer , she had already , as has been stated , exerted herself with her usual benevolence to leave the widow free for the rest of the day . "
96824	97197	97198	97198	I	0	" Lucilla said to herself . And when she had arrived at this perfectly true and profoundly philosophical conclusion , it may be said that the crisis was at an end . But then where personal offence and indignation ( if the natural shock to Miss Marjoribanks 's feelings could be called by such hard names ) ended , bewilderment and curiosity began . Who could this Archdeacon be who had frightened the most popular man in Carlingford out of the place , and whose unlooked - for appearance had driven Mrs Mortimer back out of her recovered good looks and cheerfulness into pallor and trembling ? It is true that Lucilla knew quite well who he was — the second son of Mr Beverley of Trent Valley , a family as well known as any family in England . Everybody knew all about the Archdeacon : his career from his youth up was as clearly traceable as if he had been killed in a railway accident and had had his memoir published in the Times . There was nothing in the smallest degree secret or mysterious about him ; and yet how could it come about that the sight of him should frighten Mr Cavendish out of his senses , and make Mrs Mortimer , who was utterly unconnected with Mr Cavendish , all but faint , as she had done on a former occasion ? Was it his mission to go about the world driving people into fits of terror or agitation ? To be sure , he was a Broad - Churchman , and not the type of clergyman to which Lucilla in her heart inclined ; but still a man may be Broad Church , and speak a little freely on religious matters , without being a basilisk . As these thoughts went through her mind , Miss Marjoribanks could not help observing that the branches of the pear - tree , which was all that the garden contained in the shape of fruit , had come loose from the wall , and were swaying about greatly to the damage of the half - grown pears,—not to say that it gave a very untidy look to that corner . "
97210	97414	97201	97201	Crawford	188	" Lucilla said to herself , and then went on with what she was thinking ; and she made one or two other remarks of the same description in a parenthesis as she made her tour . After all , it is astonishing how many little things go wrong when the man or woman with a hundred eyes is absent for a few days from the helm of affairs . It was nearly a week since Miss Marjoribanks had been round Mrs Mortimer 's garden , and in that time the espalier had got detached , some of the verbenas were dead in the borders , and the half of the sticks that propped up the dahlias had fallen , leaving the plants in miserable confusion . Lucilla shook her head over this , as she asked herself what mysterious influence there could be in the Archdeacon . For her own part , she was not in the slightest degree afraid of him , nor could she confess to having felt agitated even when he walked with her into this fated garden ; but there could be no doubt of the seriousness of the effect produced by his appearance on the two others . "
97427	98672	97415	97415	They	2693	" Lucilla said to herself , as she pursued her musings . For her large mind was incapable , now that its perfect serenity was happily regained , of confining itself , unless with a very good reason , to one sole subject . When she had finished her inspection , and saw that nobody had yet appeared at the door , Miss Marjoribanks collected the books which the children had left lying in the summer - house , and put them under cover — for , to tell the truth , it looked a little like rain ; and having done this , and looked all round her to see if anything else required her immediate care , Lucilla carried philosophy to its highest practical point by going away , which is , perhaps , a height of good sense which may be thought too much for humanity . It was not too much for Miss Marjoribanks 's legislative soul and knowledge of human nature;—and in thus denying herself she was perfectly aware of her advantages , and of the inevitable result . She knew , just as well as if she had already received it , that Mrs Mortimer would write her a little three - cornered note , marked Private , as soon as the Archdeacon was gone ; and she thought it was highly probable that Mr Beverley himself would come to give some explanation . With this tranquil assurance in her mind , Lucilla turned her face towards Grange Lane . She began to have a kind of conviction too , since this had happened , either that Carlingford would not be raised into a bishopric , or that the Archdeacon at least would not be the first bishop . It was difficult to give any ground for the idea , but it came into her mind with a kind of quiet certainty ; and with this conviction , in which she recognised that beautiful self - adjusting balance of compensations which keeps everything right in the world , Lucilla , quite recovered from her shock , had on the whole a pleasant walk home . As for the two who were shut up together in Mrs Mortimer 's parlour , their state of mind was far from partaking of the virtuous peace and serenity which filled Miss Marjoribanks 's bosom . It was more than an hour before the Archdeacon went away ; and when Mrs Mortimer had a little collected her faculties , the result arrived which had been foreseen by Lucilla . In the first place , terror seized the widow as to what had become of her pupils , whom all this time she had forgotten , and deep was her gratitude when she had ascertained that her protecting genius had sent them away . But with that gratitude came a sudden recollection of the manner in which Mr Beverley and Miss Marjoribanks had been coming together up the garden path , before the mistress of the house showed herself . Mrs Mortimer wrung her hands when she recollected the looks and attitude of the two , and the rumour which had reached her ears that the Archdeacon was paying attention to Miss Marjoribanks . What was she to do?—was her miserable presence here to dispel perhaps the youthful hopes of her benefactress , and make a revolution in Lucilla 's prospects ? The poor woman felt herself ready to sink into the earth at the thought . She went to the window and looked out disconsolately into the rain — for it had come on to rain , as Lucilla supposed it would — and felt like a creature in a cage , helpless , imprisoned , miserable , not knowing what to do with herself , and the cause of trouble to her best friends . A little house in a garden may look like a little paradise in the sunshine , and yet feel like a dungeon when a poor woman all alone looks out across her flowers in the rain , and sees nothing but the wall that shuts her in , and thinks to herself that she has no refuge nor escape from it — nobody to tell her what to do , nothing but her own feeble powers to support her , and the dreadful idea that she has done harm and can do no good to her only protector . Any reasonable creature would have said , that to be there in her own house , poor enough certainly , but secure , and no longer driven lonely and distressed about the world , was a great matter . But yet , after all , the walls that shut her in , the blast of white , sweeping , downright rain , which seemed to cut her off from any succour outside , and the burden of something on her mind which by herself she was quite unable to bear , was a hard combination ; and wringing one 's hands , and feeling one 's mind ready to give way under a new and unexpected burden , could not advance matters in the slightest degree . She was not strong - minded , as has been already proved ; nor , indeed , had she the ordinary amount of indifference to other people , or confidence in herself , which stands in the place of self - control with many people . After she had wrung her hands , and looked out again and again with a vague instinct of perhaps finding some suggestion of comfort outside , Mrs Mortimer relapsed by necessity into the one idea that had been a support to her for so many months past . All that she could do was to consult Lucilla — it might be to wound Lucilla , for anything she could tell ; but when a poor creature is helpless and weak , and has but one friend in the world who is strong , what can she do but apply to her sustainer and guardian ? When , after beating about wildly from one point to another , she arrived ultimately , as might have been predicted , and as Miss Marjoribanks had expected from the first , at that conclusion , there remained a further difficulty in respect to the means of communication . Lucilla had settled quite calmly in her own mind that it would be by the medium of a three - cornered note , a matter in which there was no difficulty whatever , for the widow was sufficiently fluent with her pen ; but then Lucilla had not thought of Mary Jane , who was the only possible messenger . It was to this point now that Mrs Mortimer 's ideas addressed themselves . At that moment the rain poured down fiercer than ever , the bricks of the uncovered wall grew black with the wet , and the wistaria crouched and shivered about the porch as if it wanted to be taken indoors . And then to get wet , and perhaps catch cold , was a thing Mary Jane conscientiously avoided , like the rest of the world ; and it was with a sense of alarm even stronger than that excited by the possibility of injuring Lucilla , that Mrs Mortimer very gently and modestly rang her bell . "
98683	98700	98673	98673	I	0	" said the timid experimentalist , feeling her heart beat as she made this doubtful statement . "
98711	98712	98673	98673	I	0	" "
98715	98724	98673	98673	I	0	" said the little handmaiden , with precaution ; "
98753	98754	98748	98748	mother	876	" "
98764	98769	98748	98748	mother	876	" said Mrs Mortimer ; "
98838	99197	98826	98826	I	0	" Mary Jane regarded the rain gloomily from the window ; but her reluctance was at an end from the moment she heard that it was to Miss Marjoribanks she was going . To be sure , the distance between the Serenissime Nancy and Thomas , and the other inmates of the Doctor 's kitchen , and Mrs Mortimer 's little handmaiden , was as great as that which exists between an English Duke and the poorest little cadet of a large family among his attendant gentry ; but , correspondingly , the merest entrance into that higher world was as great a privilege for Mary Jane , as the Duke 's notice would be to the Squire 's youngest son . She kept up a momentary show of resistance , but she accepted the goloshes , and even after a moment agreed in her mistress 's trembling assertion about the rain . And this was how the three - cornered note got conveyed to its destination in the heaviest of the storm , between three and four o'clock in the afternoon . Mrs Mortimer still sat at her window , wringing her hands from time to time , with her head aching and her heart beating , and a dreadful question in her mind as to what Lucilla would say , or whether perhaps she might reject altogether in her natural indignation the appeal made to her ; which was an idea which filled the widow with inexpressible horror . While at the same moment Miss Marjoribanks sat looking for that appeal which she knew was sure to come . The rain had set in by this time with an evident intention of lasting , and even from the windows of Lucilla 's drawing - room the prospect of the garden walls and glistening trees was sufficiently doleful . Nobody was likely to call , nothing was doing ; and Lucilla , who never caught cold , had not the least fear of wetting her feet . And besides , her curiosity had been rising every moment since her return ; and the widow 's pathetic appeal , "
99220	99272	99275	99275	you	119	" had its natural effect upon a mind so feeling . Miss Marjoribanks got up as soon as she had read the note , and changed her dress , and put on a great waterproof cloak . Instead of thinking it a trouble , she was rather exhilarated by the necessity . "
99291	99298	99275	99275	you	119	" she said to Mary Jane . "
99316	99452	99299	99299	She	2700	" for the little maid had betrayed the fact that Mrs Mortimer could not eat anything , and had sent away her dinner , which was naturally an alarming and wonderful occurrence to Mary Jane . The widow was still sitting at the window when Lucilla appeared tripping across the wet garden in her waterproof cloak , if not a ministering angel , at least a substantial prop and support to the lonely woman who trusted in her , and yet in the present instance feared her . But anything more unlike a disappointed maiden , whose wooer had been taken away from her under her very eyes , could not have been seen . On the contrary , Miss Marjoribanks was radiant , with raindrops glistening on her hair , and what Mrs Chiley called "
99457	99529	99530	99530	I	0	" If there was one thing in the world more than another which contented Lucilla , it was to be appealed to and called upon for active service . It did her heart good to take the management of incapable people , and arrange all their affairs for them , and solve all their difficulties . Such an office was more in her way than all the Archdeacons in the world . "
99542	99546	99532	99532	you	2703	" said Lucilla . "
99603	99630	99591	99591	he	2704	" Mrs Mortimer did not directly answer this question — she fixed her mind upon one part of it , like an unreasonable woman , and repeated "
99634	99642	99648	99649	a gentleman	5077	" with a kind of interrogative gasp . "
99651	99667	99648	99649	a gentleman	5077	" said Lucilla , with rapid intelligence ; and then there was a little pause . "
99676	99681	99682	99682	you	2710	" Miss Marjoribanks continued ; "
99721	99722	99708	99708	you	2710	" "
99744	99754	99742	99742	him	2704	" said poor Mrs Mortimer , with a sigh . "
99761	99792	99742	99742	him	2704	" said Lucilla , with ingenuous sympathy ; and she drew her chair close to that of her friend , and took her hand in a protecting , encouraging way . "
99810	99811	99797	99797	you	2710	" "
99821	99827	99797	99797	you	2710	" said the poor widow . "
99876	99877	99878	99878	My	0	" "
99881	99891	99878	99878	My	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a little severity , "
99950	99951	99938	99938	you	2710	" "
99962	99974	99985	99985	you	2710	" said the trembling woman , whose agitation was coming to a climax—"I
100014	100089	100011	100011	anybody	313	" But here Mrs Mortimer broke down , and could say no more . To be sure , she did not faint this time any more than she did on the first occasion when she made Miss Marjoribanks 's acquaintance ; but Lucilla thought it best , as then , to make her lie down on the sofa , and keep her quite quiet , and hasten Mary Jane with the cup of tea . "
100102	100106	100096	100096	you	2710	" said Lucilla . "
100194	100239	100265	100265	Lucilla	119	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with that almost imperceptible tone of contempt which she was sometimes known to use when speaking of Their absurd peculiarities . As for Mrs Mortimer , the inference conveyed by these words brought the colour to her pale cheeks . "
100247	100251	100265	100265	Lucilla	119	" she said , "
100311	100398	100303	100303	he	285	" said the widow . Lucilla could not but look on in surprise and even consternation , while Mrs Mortimer thus expressed herself . A warm flush animated the pale and somewhat worn face — and a gleam of something that looked absolutely like resolution shone in the yielding woman 's mild eyes . Was it possible that even she had one point upon which she could be firm ? Miss Marjoribanks stood still , petrified , in the very act of pouring out the tea . "
100418	100445	100411	100411	I	0	" said Lucilla , with a vague sense that this sort of self - assertion must be put a stop to , mingling with her surprise . "
100448	100463	100411	100411	I	0	" said Mrs Mortimer again , with a still more distinct gleam of resolution . "
100520	100569	100514	100514	you	119	" she cried , with a sob . As for Miss Marjoribanks , if it is possible to imagine her clear spirit altogether lost in bewilderment , it would have been at that moment ; but she recovered as soon as she had administered her cup of tea . "
100577	100613	100572	100572	me	0	" said Lucilla , again sitting down by the sofa ; and this time Mrs Mortimer , to whom her excitement had given a little spur and stimulus , did not waste any more time . "
100619	100623	100614	100614	He	4817	" she said ; "
100656	100657	100653	100653	Lucilla	119	" "
100665	100674	100653	100653	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , pressing her hand . "
100683	100690	100700	100700	he	4817	" said Mrs Mortimer , faltering ; "
100821	100822	100796	100796	he	191	" "
100827	100831	100796	100796	he	191	" said Lucilla , "
100864	100865	100844	100844	he	191	" "
100870	100879	100880	100880	you	119	" said the widow , with momentary exasperation , "
100947	100962	100963	100963	He	191	" said Mrs Mortimer , once more lighting up with exceptional and unwonted energy . "
101039	101046	101032	101032	He	191	" said Mrs Mortimer , wiping her eyes—"never
101077	101144	101071	101071	he	191	" Lucilla 's head began to whirl ; but after her first unsuccessful essay , she was wise enough not to ask any more direct questions . She made all the efforts possible , with ears and eyes intent , to disentangle this web of pronouns , and failing , waited on in the hope that time and patience would throw a little light upon them . "
101155	101167	101147	101148	Mr Beverley	170	" she said , when the narrator paused to take breath . "
101176	101181	101172	101172	I	0	" said Mrs Mortimer . "
101299	101311	101297	101297	Lucilla	119	" said Mrs Mortimer , raising herself up on the sofa , "
101336	101337	101338	101338	You	119	" "
101343	101348	101354	101355	a dear	4479	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
101387	101435	101436	101436	He	190	" Lucilla continued , with the natural humility of imperfect comprehension . It was perhaps the first time in her life that such a singular chance had happened to Miss Marjoribanks , as to have a matter explained to her , and yet be unable to understand . "
101487	101488	101480	101480	I	0	" "
101500	101546	101547	101547	I	0	" cried Lucilla , fairly losing the thread and her balance in this confusing circle . Mrs Mortimer grew pale , and rose quite up from the sofa , and went with the air of an insulted woman to seat herself in her usual chair . "
101558	101562	101552	101552	you	0	" she said . "
101604	101619	101634	101634	you	0	" said the widow , losing a little of her dignity , and growing again pathetic—"I
101651	101652	101653	101653	I	0	" "
101670	101692	101656	101656	I	0	" said Lucilla , who , in the utter confusion of her faculties , began to feel offended in her turn . "
101706	101711	101718	101718	he	2742	" cried Mrs Mortimer . "
101807	101839	101788	101788	you	0	" said the widow , turning eyes of indignant inquiry upon her visitor ; and Miss Marjoribanks for once was so utterly perplexed that she did not know how to respond . "
101850	101867	101841	101841	you	0	" said Lucilla , who felt that the tables were turned upon her for the moment . "
101887	101957	101958	101958	I	0	" This was said in the most deprecating tone in the world , but still it irritated Mrs Mortimer , whose mind was all unhinged , and who somehow felt that she was not finding in Miss Marjoribanks the help and support to which her clear and detailed explanation entitled her . Though her head was aching dreadfully , she sat up more upright than ever in her chair . "
101972	101977	101962	101962	you	0	" said the widow , "
102045	102052	102036	102036	you	0	" said Mrs Mortimer , faltering , "
102060	102061	102036	102036	you	0	" "
102066	102070	102036	102036	you	0	" said Lucilla , "
102117	102136	102108	102108	you	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added , making a dexterous strategical movement . But Mrs Mortimer only shook her head . "
102149	102153	102157	102157	Edward	190	" she said ; "
102221	102232	102214	102214	he	190	" said the widow , with tears in her eyes . "
102310	102379	102302	102302	he	190	" Mrs Mortimer continued , fixing a pathetic look upon her friend . What could Lucilla do ? She was burning to take it all in her own hands , and arrange it somehow , and unite the two lovers who had been so long separated ; but unless she could understand what the point was on which Mrs Mortimer made her stand , what could she do ? "
102385	102411	102446	102446	Lucilla	119	" said the widow , who began to feel her heart sick with the disappointment of that hope which she had fixed in Miss Marjoribanks , "
102463	102464	102460	102460	you	119	" "
102474	102646	102470	102471	Mr Kavan	192	" said Miss Marjoribanks , much startled . She had for the moment forgotten the Archdeacon 's discovery and her own suspicions ; and the idea of connecting the man who had ( apparently ) fled from Mr Beverley 's presence , with the innocent and helpless woman upon whom the appearance of the Broad Churchman had so overwhelming an effect , had never hitherto entered her imagination . But this name , which was not the name of anybody she knew , and yet seemed to bear an odd sort of rudimentary relationship to another name , struck her like a sudden blow and brought everything back to her mind . It was a bewildering sort of explanation , if it was an explanation ; but still a confused light began to break upon Lucilla 's understanding . If this was what it all meant then there was the widest opening for charitable exertions , and much to be done which only a mind like Miss Marjoribanks 's could do . "
102654	102659	102470	102471	Mr Kavan	192	" said Mrs Mortimer , "
102753	102767	102743	102743	me	0	" she added , a moment after , as another idea struck her . "
102832	103249	102824	102824	I	0	" said the poor woman , in piteous tones . If Miss Marjoribanks had pressed her , and insisted upon knowing what was the idea which had moved her friend to ask her advice , Mrs Mortimer would no doubt have found it very hard to reply ; but Lucilla had no such cruel intentions ; and the widow , notwithstanding her piteous denial of any motive , now that her mind was cleared , and she had caught the comprehension of her auditor , began to regard her with a certain instinct of hope . As for Miss Marjoribanks , this revelation at once troubled and cleared her mind . If this was the culprit , he was a culprit and yet he was innocent ; and to heap coals of fire upon his head was in some respects a Christian duty . Her ideas went forward at a bound to a grand finale of reconciliation and universal brotherhood . She saw the tools under her hands , and her very fingers itched to begin . Large and varied as her experience was , she had never yet had any piece of social business on so important a scale to manage , and her eyes sparkled and her heart beat at the idea . Instead of shrinking from interference , her spirits rose at the thought . To vanquish the Archdeacon , to pluck out from the darkness , and rehabilitate and set at his ease the mysterious adventurer , whom , to be sure , she could not say she knew — for Lucilla was very careful , even in her own thoughts , not to commit herself on this subject — and to finish off by a glorious and triumphant marriage — not her own , it is true , but of her making , which was more to the purpose — such was the programme she made out for herself with the speed of lightning , the moment she had laid hold of the clue which guided or seemed to guide her through the labyrinth . It would be too lengthy a matter to go into all her tender cares for the widow 's comfort during the rest of her stay , and the pains and delicacy with which she managed to elicit further particulars , and to make out her brief , so to speak , while she cheered up and encouraged the witness . Miss Marjoribanks jumped to the conclusion that "
103252	104590	103251	103251	Edward	190	" had been , after all , but a temporary tenant of the heart , which was now again free for the reception of the Archdeacon , if he could be got to accept the conditions . When half - past six arrived , and Thomas came for her with the great umbrella , she went off quite resplendent in her waterproof cloak , and utterly indifferent to the rain , leaving Mrs Mortimer worn out , but with a glimmer of hope in her mind . Such was the great work which , without a moment 's hesitation , Lucilla took upon her shoulders . She had no more fear of the result than she had of wetting her feet , which was a thing Mrs Mortimer and Thomas were both concerned about . But then Lucilla knew her own resources , and what she was capable of , and proceeded upon her way with that unconscious calm of genius which is always so inexplicable to the ordinary world . It was the most unlucky moment for the weather to change , being the middle of July , and as near as possible to St Swithin 's Day ; but the season had been so delightful up to that time that nobody in Carlingford at least had any reason to complain . So far as Miss Marjoribanks was concerned , she was rather glad , on the whole , that the next day was wet , and that she could not go out all the morning , nor was likely to be interrupted by visitors . She had all her plans to settle and mature for the great enterprise which she had taken in hand . By this time , so far from feeling any personal interest in the Archdeacon , or considering herself injured by his sudden desertion , that little episode had gone out of Lucilla 's mind as completely as if it had never been . In one point , however , Miss Marjoribanks 's conviction remained firm ; it was impressed upon her mind that Carlingford would not be made into a bishopric , or , if made into a bishopric , that it was not Mr Beverley who would be chosen to occupy the new see . It was one of those instinctive certainties which are not capable of explanation , which was thus borne in upon her spirit , and she could not have felt more sure of it had she seen it under the Queen 's own hand and seal . While she went about her usual morning occupations , her mind was full of her great and novel undertaking . Mr Beverley was not a man to be revolutionised in a moment ; and many people would have shrunk from the attempt to work in a few days or weeks , with no better arms than those of acquaintance , a change which the influence of love had not been able to do in so many years . But it was not in Lucilla 's nature to be daunted by a difficulty so unimportant . There was , thank Heaven , some difference between herself and the widow , who , in a strait , could think of nothing better to do , poor soul ! than to faint ; and Miss Marjoribanks had the advantage of never as yet having been beaten , whereas Mrs Mortimer had undergone numberless defeats . The hardest matter in the whole business , however , was the identification of the Mr Kavan whom the Archdeacon thought he had seen in Carlingford , and was not afraid to speak of as a clever rascal and adventurer . Mr Beverley had never seen the fellow again , as he had told Lucilla not many days back , and Miss Marjoribanks had been unfeignedly glad to hear it ; but now matters had changed . In the course of her reflections , she decided that it would now be best that these two men , if possible , should meet and recognise each other , and that the business should once for all be definitively settled . If all the offence he had committed against society was to have had a large sum of money left him by a childless old man , Lucilla saw no reason why this mysterious culprit should conceal himself ; and even if he had taken a little liberty with his name , that was not a crime — his name was his own surely , if anything was his own . At the same time , Miss Marjoribanks took pains to impress upon herself , as it is to be hoped a friendly audience will also have the goodness to do , that she had no real foundation for her suspicions as to the identity of this personage , and might turn out to be completely mistaken . He might have made no change whatever on his name ; he might be flourishing in some other quarter of England or the world , with all his antecedents perfectly well known , and unconscious of anything to be ashamed about ; which , to tell the truth , was , as Lucilla confessed to herself , a much more likely hypothesis than the supposition which had taken such possession of her mind . But then Miss Marjoribanks had a just faith in her instincts , and in those brief but telling pieces of evidence which supported her conclusion . She was thinking over this important branch of the subject with the greatest care and devotion , when , looking out by chance into the rain , she saw the Archdeacon crossing the garden . Perhaps it was just as well that she thus had warning and a moment to prepare for his visit ; not that Lucilla was a person to be taken at disadvantage ; but still , in a matter so practical and pressing , it was always better to be prepared . Mr Beverley came in with an air and expression so different from that which he had borne in their intercourse no further gone than yesterday , that , notwithstanding the corresponding revolution in her own mind , Miss Marjoribanks could not but regard him with mingled admiration and surprise . She judged him as the general world so often judged herself , and gave him credit for skill and courage in assuming such an attitude , when the fact was he was only preoccupied and natural , and did not think of his attitude at all . It did not occur to the Archdeacon that he had sinned towards Lucilla . He thought it right to explain to her his extreme surprise at the sight of Mrs Mortimer , and possibly to make her aware , at the same time , of his grievances , in so far as Mrs Mortimer was concerned ; but perhaps Mr Beverley was , on the whole , innocent of those intentions which Mrs Chiley had attributed to him , and which even Lucilla , more clear - sighted , had seen dawning in their last interview ; for , to be sure , this is one of the questions which the female intellect is apt to judge in a different light from that in which it is regarded by a man . The Archdeacon , accordingly , came in preoccupied , with a cloud on his brow , but without the smallest appearance of penitence or deprecation ; by which demeanour he gained , without deserving it , the respect , and to a certain extent the admiration , of Lucilla . His expression was not that of a man repentant , but of a man aggrieved . He had a cloud upon his countenance , and a certain air of offence and temper ; and when he sat down , he breathed a short impatient sigh . "
104599	104603	104592	104592	you	2756	" he said . "
104629	104671	104614	104614	You	2756	" Mr Beverley continued , with subdued exasperation ; for naturally , being a clergyman , he was a little impatient to find , when it was he who wanted her , any of his female friends out of the way . "
104674	104692	104614	104614	You	2756	" said Lucilla , who thought it was best to open her battery boldly and at once . "
104711	104766	104706	104706	she	133	" and to meet Mr Beverley 's ill - temper , Miss Marjoribanks put on her most heavenly air of sympathy , and rounded her words with a soft sigh , as different from his as a flute is from a trumpet . It was with an exclamation of impatience that the Archdeacon replied . "
104771	104775	104767	104769	Poor Mrs Mortimer	133	" he cried ; "
104798	104806	104795	104795	I	0	" he added , in a parenthesis . "
104854	104862	104847	104847	I	0	" said Mr Beverley , controlling himself , "
104925	104926	104894	104894	She	133	" "
104934	104943	104928	104928	she	133	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with fine scorn . "
104974	105023	104964	104964	you	133	" The Archdeacon glanced up with a momentary intense surprise , as if it was within the possibilities that such a change might have taken place in the widow 's nature ; and then he caught Lucilla 's eye , and grew red and more aggrieved than ever . "
105034	105043	105024	105025	Mrs Mortimer	133	" he said , in his authoritative voice . "
105143	105144	105149	105149	she	133	" "
105156	105160	105149	105149	she	133	" said Lucilla . "
105219	105225	105210	105210	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added prudently ; "
105234	105235	105210	105210	I	0	" "
105239	105244	105210	105210	I	0	" said Mr Beverley , "
105278	105291	105292	105292	Her	133	" said the Archdeacon , once more making an effort upon himself . "
105344	105358	105359	105359	He	194	" the Broad - Churchman said , with a certain air of disapproval . "
105450	105477	105438	105438	He	2100	" cried Mr Beverley , with a momentary inclination , as Lucilla thought , to get aground among the pronouns , as Mrs Mortimer had done . "
105485	105508	105438	105438	He	2100	" the Archdeacon continued , with an air so severe and indignant that it was evident he was contradicting his own sentiments , "
105528	105529	105520	105520	her	133	" "
105534	105538	105539	105539	you	2774	" said Lucilla ; "
105596	105597	105589	105589	you	2774	" "
105601	105627	105628	105628	You	2774	" said the Archdeacon ; and he smiled one of those disagreeable smiles which youthful writers describe by saying that his lip curled with scorn . "
105661	105675	105647	105647	he	2100	" said Mr Beverley , grinding his teeth slightly with a savage expression . "
105699	105740	105741	105741	I	0	" After such a truculent statement , what was the peacemaker to do ? She left the fire to blaze out by itself for a minute or two , and then she came down upon the enemy on another wind . "
105749	105754	105744	105744	I	0	" said Lucilla softly , "
105820	105827	105836	105836	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a sigh—"what
105885	105889	105880	105880	you	2774	" cried Lucilla . "
105896	105897	105892	105892	anybody	313	" "
105909	105914	105907	105907	she	133	" said the Archdeacon . "
105962	106018	105954	105954	you	2774	" Mr Beverley added ; and he did not show so much as a symptom of yielding . To say that Miss Marjoribanks was not discouraged would be more than the truth ; but she was still at the beginning of her forces , and no thought of giving in was in her courageous soul . "
106028	106033	106019	106019	I	0	" said Lucilla frankly . "
106085	106135	106136	106136	She	133	" said Miss Marjoribanks , and she looked up with that ingenuous look of appeal , which was always so touching in her , to the Archdeacon 's face . As for Mr Beverley , in his haste and excitement , he gave vent to two very contradictory statements . "
106150	106158	106142	106142	I	0	" he said , with some heat . "
106208	106243	106199	106199	she	133	" said the Broad Churchman , with a sudden flash of jealousy and anger . It occurred to Lucilla then for the first time that she had found the grand clue to the whole . "
106249	106254	106256	106256	she	133	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
106306	106311	106297	106297	I	0	" said Lucilla sadly . "
106369	106511	106365	106365	you	2791	" cried Lucilla , deeply moved . She put her handkerchief to her eyes , and yet she kept watch upon the Archdeacon through one of the corners . He had got up by this time , and was walking about the room like any other man in trouble . To throw suspicion on the widow , or separate her from so effectual a protector , was the very last thing he had any inclination to do : for , to tell the truth , he made that jealous suggestion only in order to receive an indignant denial , and to be assured that such a thing was impossible . But then Mr Beverley did not know whom he had to deal with , nor that he was not the first man whom Miss Marjoribanks had reduced to his proper place . "
106518	106526	106538	106539	Mr Beverley	170	" said Lucilla , drying her eyes , "
106599	106608	106593	106593	she	2793	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a sob , "
106622	106623	106593	106593	she	2793	" "
106634	106700	106630	106630	you	2794	" said the Archdeacon . He had grown as pale as he was before red , and came to a dead stop in front of Lucilla , and stood lowering and menacing over her . His shadow was so big and strong , and stood so directly between her and the window , that Miss Marjoribanks 's heart gave one bound of something like alarm . "
106705	106709	106630	106630	you	2794	" said Lucilla , "
106750	106759	106791	106791	you	195	" said the young moralist , with solemnity , "
106833	106837	106791	106791	you	195	" sobbed Lucilla , "
106853	106901	106839	106839	she	2793	" The Archdeacon , though he was not a weakling , was altogether stunned by this address . He sank into the nearest chair , and drew it closer to Lucilla , and looked perfectly flabby and ghastly in his white tie , with his alarmed countenance . "
106911	106921	106839	106839	she	2793	" said Mr Beverley , bending forward towards her , "
106935	107062	106839	106839	she	2793	" Now was the critical moment , and Lucilla felt it . If Mrs Chiley , for example , had only advised herself to come in then instead of interrupting people 's proposals , and driving a likely suitor to desperation ! But such happy chances do not occur at the real crises of life . What she wanted was , naturally , not to explain herself , but to let that arrow rankle in her opponent 's heart until it should have served her purpose . All that she said in answer to Mr Beverley 's appeal was to hide her face in her handkerchief , which was the only means that occurred to her for the moment of gaining a little time for reflection . "
107077	107081	107093	107093	she	2797	" said Lucilla , "
107182	107183	107184	107184	My	0	" "
107189	107195	107184	107184	My	0	" said the Archdeacon solemnly , "
107216	107217	107196	107196	I	0	" "
107228	107241	107220	107220	I	0	" said Lucilla , partially raising her face out of her handkerchief ; "
107316	107320	107303	107303	she	2807	" said Lucilla . "
107361	107370	107358	107358	you	195	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with sad decision . "
107409	107542	107406	107406	you	195	" Mr Beverley was driven as nearly out of his senses by this counsel as it was possible for a man of ordinary self - control and warm temper to be . He got up again and made a stride to and fro , and wiped the moisture from his forehead , which , as Lucilla remarked at the moment , had a Low - Church look , which she would not have expected from him . But , on the other hand , he gave vent to some stifled and unintelligible exclamations which , whatever they might be , were not blessings . Then he came to himself a little , which was what Miss Marjoribanks was most afraid of , and stood over her , large and imposing as before . "
107555	107560	107552	107552	you	195	" cried the Archdeacon . "
107610	107623	107598	107598	She	176	" said Mr Beverley , with a hoarse and perfectly unmirthful laugh , "
107662	107733	107734	107735	Mr Beverley	195	" he added , once more wiping his forehead . It was a very Low - Church , not to say Dissenterish , sort of thing to do , and it unconsciously reduced her adversary 's dignity in Miss Marjoribanks 's opinion , besides affording a proof that he was not nearly so much convinced of what he said , as he professed to be , in his secret heart . "
107744	107751	107739	107739	you	195	" said Lucilla , with dignity . "
107787	107796	107797	107797	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with calm grace : "
107859	107875	107854	107854	he	2817	" said the bold experimentalist , fixing her eyes calmly upon the Archdeacon 's face . "
107940	107974	107937	107938	some people	443	" said Lucilla . She got up as she spoke and went to the mirror , and looked at herself with that beautiful simplicity which was one of Miss Marjoribanks 's distinguishing features . "
107984	108015	108016	108016	I	0	" she said , with a little anxiety . As for Mr Beverley , his state of mind , as the newspapers say , could better be imagined than described . "
108021	108030	108016	108016	I	0	" he said , taking up his hat . "
108047	108070	108044	108045	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" continued the Archdeacon , taking her hand , and holding it fast over his hat to give emphasis to his address , "
108114	108139	108106	108106	I	0	" Mr Beverley said , with emphasis ; but by this time Miss Marjoribanks considered it time to bring the crisis to an end . "
108148	108152	108106	108106	I	0	" she said ; "
108180	108185	108169	108169	you	0	" said Lucilla airily ; "
108207	108276	108277	108277	You	2825	" At this moment some one rang the door - bell . Lucilla knew perfectly well that it was only the baker , but it could not be expected that the Archdeacon should be similarly initiated into the secrets of the house . He thought , as was natural , that it was the people she expected , and almost wrung her hand as he let it go . "
108286	108296	108277	108277	You	2825	" he said , in a tone of entreaty . "
108319	108413	108415	108415	he	0	" cried Mr Beverley . If anybody had but heard him ! as Lucilla said to herself the minute he was gone . And the truth was that Thomas did hear him , who had just opened the door to tell his young mistress that her luncheon was waiting , and whom the Archdeacon did all but knock downstairs in his sudden and unlooked - for exit . The impression naturally conveyed to Thomas by these words was of the clearest and most distinct description . He was even known to say afterwards , "
108425	109472	108418	108419	a gentleman	5077	" But Mr Beverley rushed downstairs , without thinking of Thomas , in a most unenviable frame of mind , into the rain . He was more afraid of meeting Miss Marjoribanks 's friends than a man of his size and principles should have been afraid of meeting anybody ; but then there is a vast distinction , as everybody is aware , and no one more than the Archdeacon , between physical and moral strength . As for Lucilla , her tears and anxieties passed off in a miraculous manner as soon as her visitor was gone . She went downstairs and ate her luncheon with the serenest brow and a most agreeable ladylike appetite . And it was not a fib , as may perhaps be supposed , that she was expecting people — for at that hour Miss Marjoribanks always did expect people , who , to be sure , might be kept back by the rain , but whom she was always justified in looking for . Perhaps , on the whole , notwithstanding her warm sense of the duties of hospitality , Lucilla was glad that it rained so heavily , and that nobody came . She had a great deal to think of as she took her maidenly and delicate repast . The first step had been taken , and taken triumphantly . Henceforward , whatever the Archdeacon 's illusions might be , he could no longer stand calm upon his eminence , and conclude that it was he , and he alone , who could raise the widow from her lowly estate . Lucilla , it is true , knew that no such idea as that of marrying her uncle 's heir would ever present itself to Mrs Mortimer ; and that — at least so far as Miss Marjoribanks 's information went — such a thought was equally removed from the mind of the personage unknown , whom Mr Beverley denounced as an impostor . But this did not in the least affect the value of the suggestion as an instrument to be used against the Archdeacon , who was big enough to defend himself , and on whose account the young philanthropist had no compunctions . The first step was thus taken , and taken successfully , but it was only after this that the real difficulties began ; and Lucilla knew no more as yet how she was to find and identify , not to say assail and vanquish , the other side , the mysterious Mr Kavan , the man whom the Archdeacon abused and the widow defended , than even the greatest military genius knows at the commencement of the first campaign how to conduct the second . This was what she considered so closely as she sat alone in the dull afternoon . She did not go to Mrs Mortimer , because it was impossible that every day could be a half - holiday , and because , on the whole , she judged it best not to subject herself , in the present undeveloped state of the position , to much questioning ; but she sent her a little note to satisfy her mind , telling her to keep herself easy , and not to let the Archdeacon bully her , and to confide in the devotion of her affectionate Lucilla . When she had thus satisfied the immediate demands of friendship , Miss Marjoribanks took her work and sat down to reflect . Nothing could be more exciting than the position in which she found herself ; but the difficulties were only such as stimulated her genius ; and then it was not any selfish advantage , but the good of her neighbour in its most sublime manifestation — the good of her neighbour who had injured her , and been insensible to her attractions , which , according to the world in general , is the one thing unpardonable to a woman — which Lucilla sought . And it was not even the scriptural coals of fire she was thinking of as she pondered her great undertaking in her mind . The enterprise might not be free from a touch of human vanity , but it was vanity of a loftier description : the pleasure of exercising a great faculty , and the natural confidence of genius in its own powers . The fruit of Lucilla 's long and mature reflection was that next morning being fine and all the clouds dispersed , she went out with her usual firm step and self - possession , and , what was rather unusual with her , except on necessary occasions of ceremony , knocked at Mrs Woodburn 's door . Mrs Woodburn and Miss Marjoribanks had never , as people say , taken to each other . They were as different in their ways as it is possible to imagine . The mimic was a little indolent , and would not take the trouble to make any exertions for the good of the community , except in the exercise of her peculiar talent , though she had been known , when excited , to go through real fatigue for that ; but she had none of the steady force , the persevering energy — or , to sum up all in one word , the genius — of Miss Marjoribanks , who , for her part , recognised the use of such an instrument of entertainment as Mrs Woodburn possessed without appreciating it in her own person ; for Lucilla had no sense of humour , as she candidly admitted , with that consciousness of her own faults , and slight disposition to consider them virtues , which is common to persons of great endowments . It was accordingly with a slight sense of effort on both sides that they met thus in the familiarity of an early visit , at a moment when people doing their duty to each other in a ceremonial way would not have thought of calling . She was aware that Mrs Woodburn regarded her , even when she kissed her in the most neighbourly and affectionate manner , with a look which seemed to say , "
109483	109645	109475	109475	she	2828	" As for Lucilla , she was too wise to pretend that it was a mere visit of regard . She was too wise , and her interlocutor was too clever , and prone to catch every touch of expression , though Miss Marjoribanks flattered herself she had sufficient experience to enable her to dismiss , when there was occasion for it , all expression from her face . But such was not her policy at this moment . When the two faces had touched each other in that loving and sisterly salutation , their owners immediately separated , and regarded each other from two opposite chairs , without decided hostility , it is true , but with the watchful air of two people whom the fates may range on different sides , and whom it behoves to be mutually watchful . And Lucilla thought it the most expedient course , under the circumstances , to begin her investigations at once . "
109654	109658	109646	109646	I	0	" she said ; "
109722	109726	109699	109699	He	115	" said Lucilla ; "
109741	109798	109799	109799	My	0	" Mrs Woodburn fairly gasped in her companion 's face . She could no more tell what this meant , than if she had been a person utterly unacquainted with human motives and ways of working ; and , indeed , it was only the tricks of the surface for which she had any real insight . "
109802	109922	109799	109799	My	0	" she exclaimed , with something between an impulse of defence and denial , and a quite opposite instinct of confidence . Had he proposed , after all , without telling his sister ? Had Lucilla a right to ask the question she uttered so frankly ? Had he been prudent for once in his life , and secured this sensible alliance and prop to his position ? All these questions rushed at lightning - speed through Mrs Woodburn 's mind ; but she was not so prompt as Miss Marjoribanks would have been under the circumstances , and all she did was to open her eyes wide , and give a start on her chair , and say , "
109926	109940	109799	109799	My	0	" with a voice which trembled , and was half extinguished by surprise . "
109946	109950	109943	109944	Mr Cavendish	115	" said Lucilla . "
110047	110126	110043	110043	you	2834	" Mrs Woodburn had recovered a little , and found a moment to think , but her faculties were not so handy , except in her own particular way , as might have been expected from such a clever woman . She could even at that moment have taken off Miss Marjoribanks to the life , but she was in the most profound bewilderment as to what Lucilla could mean ; whether she was really laying herself out to "
110128	110179	110183	110183	he	2643	" Mr Cavendish , or whether she was merely talking nonsense without any particular meaning ; or whether she was feigning indifference by way of getting information ; and the stupidest person in Carlingford would have acquitted herself as well as Mrs Woodburn felt able to do in the emergency . "
110198	110247	110249	110249	me	0	" she said , in a tremulous way ; finding nothing better come to her lips than the echo of an old compliment , which went against her nature , but yet with an instinct of serving her brother so far as it might be in her power . "
110251	110256	110249	110249	me	0	" said Lucilla frankly . "
110296	110301	110290	110290	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
110354	110355	110356	110356	I	0	" "
110366	110371	110356	110356	I	0	" said Mrs Woodburn ; "
110420	110455	110411	110411	you	2838	" said the anxious sister , who had recovered her head , and thought it might be possible to get at the secret , if there was a secret , by means like this . "
110458	110463	110464	110464	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
110481	110487	110475	110476	nobody else	1541	" said the candid Lucilla , "
110539	110540	110541	110541	His	2643	" "
110544	110565	110541	110541	His	2643	" said Mrs Woodburn , with a little cry , like an imprudent woman ; and then she recovered herself . "
110576	110580	110582	110582	he	2643	" she said , "
110632	110633	110623	110623	I	0	" "
110647	110651	110623	110623	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
110702	110873	110696	110696	people	505	" Mrs Woodburn had grown quite pale — perhaps because she began to see that there was some method in these questions , perhaps with simple and unreasonable fright at the suggestion . She could not say a word for a moment , so startling was the question ; and then there was something in Lucilla 's early visit , and in her instant onslaught upon Mr Cavendish , which was alarming . She was so frightened and driven into a corner that she could not tell how to answer . It occurred to her all at once that perhaps Mr Cavendish had opened his heart to Miss Marjoribanks and given her an inkling of his secret ; and what would Lucilla think if she contradicted her brother ? Never was a poor woman in a greater difficulty . All her fun and her mimicry collapsed . She no more noticed the peculiarities of Lucilla 's look and manner than if she had been an ordinary inhabitant of Grange Lane . "
110878	110914	110696	110696	people	505	" she faltered , in a blank sort of interrogative way ; and in spite of herself faltered and shook , and conveyed to Lucilla the most perfect assurance that what she supposed was true . "
110959	110963	110946	110946	you	2855	" said Lucilla . "
111014	111015	111016	111016	I	0	" "
111025	111038	111016	111016	I	0	" said Mrs Woodburn , with something like the instinct of despair ; "
111059	111079	111080	111080	I	0	" and then the poor lady stopped short , as if she had something choking her in her throat . "
111089	111090	111087	111087	he	115	" "
111098	111107	111087	111087	he	115	" said Lucilla , in her easy way . "
111156	111161	111162	111162	She	2863	" continued Miss Marjoribanks . "
111178	111189	111164	111164	he	115	" Mrs Woodburn recovered herself a little as Lucilla spoke . "
111199	111203	111196	111197	Mr Cavendish	115	" she said . "
111218	111267	111196	111197	Mr Cavendish	115	" At that moment there was a sound in the house of a heavy step , and Mr Woodburn 's whistle became audible in the distance . Then the poor woman , who had a secret , fixed haggard eyes upon Miss Marjoribanks . She dared not say , "
111277	111327	111196	111197	Mr Cavendish	115	" She dared not utter a word to awaken suspicion on one side or the other . She knew very well that if Mr Woodburn heard of the existence of any old friends of his brother - in - law , he would insist upon having them produced , and "
111332	111478	111196	111197	Mr Cavendish	115	" ; and at the same time Mrs Woodburn could not so far confide in Lucilla as to beg her to keep silent . This was what her brother 's poltroonery brought upon the unfortunate woman . And when the emergency came she was not as equal to it as she expected to be . Her talents were not of a nature to do her any good in such a strait . She collapsed entirely , and looked round her in a flutter of fright and despair , as if to find some means of escape . But this terror all arose from the fact that she did not know Miss Marjoribanks , who was generous as she was strong , and had no intention of going to extremities . Lucilla got up from her chair when she heard Mr Woodburn 's whistle coming nearer . "
111484	111488	111481	111481	somebody	312	" she said , "
111543	111554	111526	111526	me	0	" continued Lucilla , as Mr Woodburn entered the room . "
111579	112291	112293	112293	you	2873	" And then , as was natural , Woodburn , with his usual absurdity , as his wife explained afterwards , struck in with some boisterous badinage . As for Mrs Woodburn , in her mingled terror and relief , she was too much excited to know what he said . But when Lucilla , serenely smiling , was gone , the mimic , with her nerves strung to desperation , burst into the wildest comic travesty of Miss Marjoribanks 's looks and manners , and her inquiries about Harry , and sent her unsuspicious husband into convulsions of laughter . He laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks — the unconscious simpleton ; and all the time his wife could have liked to throw him down and trample on him , or put pins into him , or scratch his beaming , jovial countenance . Perhaps she would have gone into hysterics instead if she had not possessed that other safety - valve , for Mrs Woodburn had not that supreme composure and self - command which belonged to Lucilla 's higher organisation . She wrote a long letter that afternoon , and had a dreadful headache all the evening after it , which , considering all things , was to be expected under the circumstances , and was a weak - minded woman 's last resource . No headache , however , disturbed Miss Marjoribanks 's beneficent progress . She went home conscious that , if she had not acquired any distinct information , she had at least gained a moral certainty . And besides , she had measured the forces of Mr Cavendish 's bodyguard , and had found them utterly unequal to any prolonged resistance . All that was wanted was prudence and care , and that good luck which was as much an endowment in its way as the other qualities by which Lucilla might be said to have secured it . She went home meditating her next step , and with a certain enjoyment in the sense of difficulty and the consciousness of how much skill and power would be required to carry on three different threads of innocent intrigue with the three different persons in the drama , without ever letting the general web get confused , or confounding one strand with another . She had to frighten the Archdeacon with the idea that Mrs Mortimer might marry the impostor , and she had to keep the widow in the profoundest ignorance of this suggestion , and she had to manage and guide the impostor himself , to save his position , and deliver him from his enemies , and make his would - be persecutor for ever harmless . If by chance she should forget herself for a moment , and say to Mr Beverley what she meant for Mr Cavendish , or betray her mode of dealing with either to the third person interested , then farewell to all her hopes . But when all that was required was skill and self - possession and courage , Miss Marjoribanks knew herself too well to be afraid . She came in with that sense of having done her duty which is so sweet to a well - regulated mind . But it was not to that internal satisfaction alone that Providence limited Lucilla 's reward . There are exceptional cases to be found here and there even in this world , in which virtue finds its just acknowledgment , and disinterested well - doing is recompensed as it deserves . While Miss Marjoribanks was still occupied with the arrangement of her plans she was interrupted by a visitor , who entered with a brow clouded by care , and yet exalted by the sense of a charge and dignity which is not afforded to every woman . It was Mrs Centum who thus came to unfold to Lucilla the new event which was about to happen in Carlingford . She had a great deal to say first , as was natural , of the dreadful vexation of such a thing happening in holiday - time when the boys were all at home , and when she did not know what to do . "
112312	112317	112293	112293	you	2873	" said Mrs Centum ; "
112393	112394	112396	112396	officers	2884	" "
112398	112444	112396	112396	officers	2884	" said Lucilla , pricking up her ears — for to tell the truth , the very name of officers in a place like Carlingford , where nobody could flirt but Mr Cavendish , was as water in the desert to Miss Marjoribanks 's soul . "
112452	112455	112447	112448	the Doctor	326	" said Mrs Centum—"but
112631	112635	112636	112636	he	2891	" said Mrs Centum solemnly;—"if
112665	112666	112660	112660	they	2897	" "
112670	112675	112660	112660	they	2897	" cried Miss Marjoribanks naturally excited—"the
112683	112684	112660	112660	they	2897	" "
112693	112702	112689	112690	Mr Centum	98	" said the visitor , with a sigh ; "
112844	112845	112841	112842	a dear	4479	" "
112850	112855	112846	112848	Dear Mrs Centum	97	" cried Miss Marjoribanks , "
112886	112891	112907	112907	Lucilla	119	" said Lucilla sweetly , "
112900	112901	112907	112907	Lucilla	119	" "
112909	112915	112907	112907	Lucilla	119	" said Mrs Centum anxiously , "
112962	113089	113090	113090	I	0	" Mrs Centum fixed her eyes with true solicitude on Lucilla 's face . Miss Marjoribanks was magnanimous , but the paté in question was one of the greatest triumphs of the Doctor 's table . She thought , and with truth , that it was a great deal for any one to ask ; but then it is true that genius has duties as well as privileges ; and to impress upon mediocrity the benefit of loyally following and copying superior intelligence , is of itself a moral effect of the greatest importance . And besides , the woman who at such a moment produced a live General in Carlingford , and held out hopes of officers , was not a woman to be denied . "
113098	113103	113090	113090	I	0	" said Lucilla graciously , "
113151	113152	113129	113131	Dear Mrs Centum	97	" "
113160	113166	113129	113131	Dear Mrs Centum	97	" cried the grateful woman ; "
113194	113202	113185	113185	I	0	" added Mrs Centum , with effusion ; "
113256	113288	113244	113244	he	2891	" she added , in the fulness of her enthusiasm and gratitude . As for Miss Marjoribanks , she shook her head , but nevertheless received the assurance with a smile . "
113301	113305	113296	113296	I	0	" said Lucilla : "
113347	113352	113343	113345	nice new people	2920	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
113371	114108	114109	114109	I	0	" With this benign acknowledgment of the General 's merits , Lucilla received Mrs Centum 's affectionate leave - takings . To be sure , she knew nothing , and did not occupy herself much at that moment about General Travers . But at the same time Miss Marjoribanks , with her usual piety , recognised the approval of Providence in this new occurrence , and was naturally both encouraged and exhilarated . It is but in rare cases , as has been said , that the reward of virtue is given so promptly , and with such beautiful discrimination : and there are even people in the world who profess to have no faith in any prompt or visible recompense . But Lucilla was not of that new and heretical school . For her own part , she felt it very natural that her exertions for the good of her kind should thus be recognised and acknowledged , and returned to her plans with that sweet and exhilarating sense of moral harmony , which an approving Heaven , and a sense of blessings earned and goodness recompensed , are so well calculated to give . Miss Marjoribanks 's mind had scarcely subsided out of the first exhilarating sense of a great many things to do , and a truly important mission in hand , when little Rose Lake sought her with that confession of family troubles , and prayer for counsel and aid in the extremity , which opened a new way and mode of working to Lucilla . Rose was proud , poor little soul , not only of her exceptional position , and that of her family , as a family of artists , but also with a constitutional and individual pride as one of the natural conservators of domestic honour , who would rather have died than have heard the Lakes lightly spoken of , or upbraided with debt or indecorum , or any other crime . She had been silent as long as she could about Barbara 's shortcomings , jealously concealing them from all the world , and attacking them with a violence which made her big elder sister , who was twice as big and six times as strong as she , tremble before her when they were alone . But little Rose had at length found things come to a point beyond which her experience did not go . Barbara began to have secret meetings with a man whose presence nobody was aware of , and who did not come openly to the house to seek her , and persevered , in spite of all remonstrances , in this clandestine career ; and all the prejudices and all the instincts of the young artist rose up against her . A vague presentiment of greater evil behind impelled her to some action , and shame and pride combined at the same time to keep her silent . She could not speak to her father , because the poor man lost his head straightway , and made piteous appeals to her not to make a fuss , and threw the burden back again upon her with a double weight ; and besides , he was only a man , though he was her father , and Rose had the pride of a woman in addition to her other pride . In these painful circumstances , it occurred to her to consult Lucilla , who had been , as has been recounted in an early part of this history , a great authority at Mount Pleasant , where her heroic belief in herself led , as was natural , others to believe in her . And then Miss Marjoribanks was one of the people who can keep counsel ; and Rose felt , besides , that Lucilla had been injured , and had not revenged herself , and that to put confidence in her would be , to a certain extent , to make up for the offence . All these motives , combined with an intolerable sense of having upon her shoulders a burden greater than she could bear , drove the young artist at last to Grange Lane , where Lucilla , as we have said , was still in the state of mental exhilaration and excitement naturally consequent upon having a very important piece of work in hand . "
114117	114121	114109	114109	I	0	" said Rose ; "
114227	114236	114220	114225	any nice old ladies in Carlingford	2929	" added the Preraphaelist , with a sigh . "
114243	114247	114250	114251	Mrs Chiley	96	" cried Lucilla , "
114272	114273	114274	114274	Lucilla	119	" "
114276	114281	114274	114274	Lucilla	119	" said Rose solemnly , "
114333	114344	114323	114324	a family	710	" said the young artist , with a certain severity , "
114353	114415	114416	114416	I	0	" This exordium had its natural effect upon Miss Marjoribanks ; her imagination leaped forward a long way beyond the reality which her companion talked of so solemnly , and she changed her colour a little , as even a woman of her experience might be excused for doing in the presence of something terrible and disastrous so near at hand . "
114424	114428	114418	114418	you	2938	" said Lucilla ; "
114467	114541	114542	114542	nobody	4434	" But these soothing tones were too much for Rose 's composure . She cried , and her cheeks flushed , and her dewy eyes enlarged and lightened when they had thrown off a little part of their oppression in the form of those hot salt tears . Miss Marjoribanks had never seen her look so pretty , and said so to herself , with a momentary and perfectly disinterested regret that there was "
114543	114613	114665	114666	a dear	4479	" to see her — a regret which probably changed its character before Rose left the house . But in the meantime Lucilla soothed her and kissed her , and took off her hat and shed her pretty curls off her forehead . These curls were not by any means so strong and vehement in their twist as Miss Marjoribanks 's own , but hung loosely and softly with the "
114616	114621	114622	114622	You	2943	" of the poet . "
114635	114644	114622	114622	You	2943	" Lucilla said , in her maternal way . "
114668	114669	114665	114666	a dear	4479	" "
114674	114682	114665	114666	a dear	4479	" said Rose , drying her tears , "
114743	114756	114737	114737	I	0	" said the poor little sister pathetically , with a regretful sob . "
114811	114821	114802	114802	I	0	" cried Rose , her eyes lighting up passionately . "
114847	114848	114849	114849	You	119	" "
114863	114869	114859	114859	you	119	" said the experienced Lucilla ; "
114905	114906	114896	114896	you	119	" "
114915	114919	114907	114907	Lucilla	119	" said Rose ; "
114960	114979	114951	114951	she	4479	" said the reverent little maiden , whose voice changed and softened under the influence of that supposition ; "
114993	115002	114989	114989	he	5077	" she went on , with new vehemence . "
115109	115110	115112	115112	me	0	" "
115115	115120	115112	115112	me	0	" said Lucilla gravely . "
115158	115159	115160	115160	I	0	" "
115168	115172	115160	115160	I	0	" said Rose ; "
115202	115226	115227	115227	I	0	" the Preraphaelist went on , faltering a little , and not feeling quite so sure of the fact on that special occasion . "
115244	115245	115246	115247	My dear	4403	" "
115249	115257	115259	115259	you	119	" said Lucilla , with great seriousness , "
115341	115342	115327	115327	You	119	" "
115348	115456	115457	115457	My	0	" echoed poor Rose , in dismay . She had been waiting for Lucilla 's advice with a great deal of anxiety ; but at the present moment it would be vain to conceal that the proposed expedient seemed to her altogether inadequate for the emergency . The light went out of her face as she opened her eyes wide and fixed them on Lucilla ; and for one moment , one desperate moment , Rose was disloyal , and lost faith in the only person who could help her ; which , perhaps , under the circumstances , was not a thing to cause much surprise . "
115483	115491	115471	115471	I	0	" said Lucilla , with great gravity . "
115534	115539	115525	115525	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
115581	115582	115568	115568	We	2967	" "
115588	115610	115585	115585	Lucilla	119	" said Rose , with consternation ; and then she stopped short , and could not tell what more to say . "
115617	115622	115611	115611	You	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
115691	115695	115683	115683	you	119	" said Lucilla . "
115716	115721	115713	115713	my	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added , "
115743	115744	115683	115683	you	119	" "
115747	115796	115683	115683	you	119	" said Rose ; but perhaps it was still doubtful how far she understood the mode of operations proposed . Lucilla 's prompt and facile genius was too much for the young artist , and there was , as she herself would have said , an entire want of "
115798	116134	115683	115683	you	119	" between her own sense of the position , tragical and desperate as that was , and any state of matters which could be ameliorated by the fact of Miss Marjoribanks coming to tea . It had been Rose 's only hope , and now it seemed all at once to fail her ; and yet , at the same time , that instinctive faith in Lucilla which came naturally to every one under her influence struggled against reason in Rose 's heart . Her red soft lips fell apart with the hurried breath of wonder and doubt ; her eyes still expanded , and clearer than usual after their tears , were fixed upon Lucilla with an appealing , questioning look ; and it was just at this moment , when Rose was a great deal too much absorbed in her disappointment and surprise , and lingering hope , to take any notice of strange sounds or sights , or of anybody coming , that Thomas all at once opened the door and showed Mrs Centum into the room . Now it would have mattered very little for Mrs Centum — who , to be sure , knew Lucilla perfectly well , and would never have dreamed for a moment of identifying such a trifling little person as Rose Lake in any way with Miss Marjoribanks ; but then Mrs Centum happened at that precise moment to be bringing the new arrival , the important stranger , who had so much in his power — General Travers himself — to be introduced to Lucilla ; and it was not the fault either of Rose or the General if it was on the young mistress of the Female School of Design that the warrior 's first glance fell . Naturally the conversation had run upon Miss Marjoribanks on the past evening , for Mrs Centum was full of the enthusiasm and excitement incident to that paté which Lucilla had so magnanimously enabled her to produce . "
116139	116151	116152	116152	We	2971	" General Travers had demanded , as was to be expected . "
116156	116166	116152	116152	We	2971	" Mrs Centum had replied , and made a long pause—"would
116174	116302	116167	116167	you	2972	" and Charles had been equally dubious in his response ; for , to be sure , it was a dereliction from Miss Marjoribanks 's dignity to call her pretty , which is a trifling sort of qualification . But when the General entered the drawing - room , which might be called the centre of Carlingford , and saw before him that little dewy face , full of clouds and sunshine , uncertain , unquiet , open - eyed , with the red lips apart , and the eyes clear and expanded with recent tears — a face which gave a certain sentiment of freshness and fragrance to the atmosphere like the quiet after a storm — he did not understand what his hosts could mean . "
116309	116486	116305	116305	her	2970	" he said , under his breath , to his interested and delighted chaperone ; and we are surely justified in appealing to the readers of this history , as Lucilla , who was always reasonable , afterwards did to herself , whether it could be justly said under all the circumstances , that either Rose or the General were to blame ? The little artist got up hurriedly when she awoke to the fact that other visitors had come into the room , but she was not at all interested in General Travers , whom Rose , with the unconscious insolence of youth , classified in her own mind as an elderly gentleman . Not that he was at all an elderly gentleman ; but then a man of forty , especially when he is a fine man and adequately developed for his years , has at the first glance no great attraction for an impertinent of seventeen . Rose did not go away without receiving another kiss from Lucilla , and a parting reminder . "
116508	116643	116496	116496	you	2973	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; and Rose , half ashamed , put on her hat and went away , without so much as remarking the admiration in the stranger 's eyes , nor the look of disappointment with which he saw her leave the room . Rose thought no more of him than if he had been a piece of furniture ; but as for the General , when he found himself obliged to turn to Lucilla and make himself agreeable , the drawback of having thus had his admiration forestalled and drawn away from its legitimate object was such , that he did not find her at all pretty ; which , after all , on a first interview at least , is all They think about , as Miss Marjoribanks herself said . "
116658	116663	116664	116664	You	2976	" said Mrs Centum . "
116701	116715	116693	116693	we	2974	" said the injudicious woman , who did not know what to say . "
116720	116725	116693	116693	we	2974	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
116780	116788	116777	116777	my	0	" Lucilla added , with a sigh , "
116797	116798	116799	116799	Lucilla	119	" "
116801	116810	116799	116799	Lucilla	119	" cried Mrs Centum , a little shocked , "
116852	116853	116829	116829	she	2982	" "
116858	116863	116854	116856	Dear Mrs Centum	97	" said Lucilla sweetly , "
116904	116914	116888	116888	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks continued , with her usual politeness ; "
116950	116987	116992	116992	you	2991	" said Lucilla . Perhaps it was not quite civil ; but then it must be admitted , that to see a man look blankly in your face as if he were saying in his mind , "
117006	117093	117003	117004	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" was about as exasperating a sensation as one is likely to meet with . Lucilla understood perfectly well General Travers 's look , and for the moment , instead of making herself agreeable , it was the contrary impulse that moved her . She looked at him , not blankly as he looked at her , but in a calmly considerate way , as she might have looked at Mr Holden the upholsterer , had he proposed a new kind of tapisserie to her judgment . "
117108	117113	117105	117106	General Travers	199	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
117124	117257	117258	117258	Lucilla	119	" As for Mrs Centum , she was quite incapable of managing such a terrible crisis . She felt it , indeed , a little hard that it should be her man who was defied in this alarming way , while Mr Cavendish and the Archdeacon , the two previous candidates , had both been received so sweetly . To be sure , it was his own fault ; but that did not mend matters . She looked from one to the other with a scared look , and grew very red , and untied her bonnet ; and then , as none of these evidences of agitation had any effect upon the other parties involved , plunged into the heat of the conflict without considering what she was about to say . "
117266	117271	117264	117264	you	119	" said Mrs Centum , "
117302	117303	117296	117296	you	119	" "
117313	117339	117340	117340	I	0	" said General Travers , interposing , with that holy horror of a quarrel between women which is common to the inferior half of creation . "
117428	117429	117419	117424	this fellow you are talking of	3003	" "
117434	117439	117419	117424	this fellow you are talking of	3003	" said Mrs Centum . "
117482	117536	117477	117477	herself	99	" she continued , beginning to let the interesting suspicion enter her mind ; for , to be sure , they were about of a standing , and the banker 's wife had sometimes felt a little sore at the idea that her neighbour possessed distinctions of family which were denied to herself . "
117551	117686	117543	117543	her	99	" said Mrs Centum , and she began to forget the General , and Lucilla 's reception of him , in this still more interesting subject . It was the first time that the authenticity of the Cavendishes had been attacked in Carlingford ; and , to be sure , what is the good of having fine connections if they can not be produced ? While Mrs Centum pondered a suggestion so interesting , Lucilla , on her part , also took advantage of the occasion , and descended from the calm heights of dignity on which she had placed herself . And the General , who was a well - bred man , had got over for the moment the unlucky impression made upon him by the fresh face of little Rose Lake . "
117693	117698	117687	117688	Mr Cavendish	115	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
117789	117790	117781	117781	he	115	" "
117799	117811	117792	117792	somebody	312	" said the General , feeling it was expected of him . "
117823	117827	117815	117815	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
117891	117896	117906	117907	the officers	2875	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
117941	117950	117935	117935	one	4465	" Lucilla added , with a gentle sigh . "
117959	117965	117952	117952	I	0	" said the amused soldier . "
117985	117986	117952	117952	I	0	" "
117989	117997	117952	117952	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with resignation , "
118037	118392	118016	118016	I	0	" Lucilla continued , after a pause , with a gracious smile ; and then she led her guests downstairs to luncheon , which was every way satisfactory . As for the General , it can not be doubted that he had the worst of it in this little encounter , and felt himself by no means such a great personage in Carlingford as his hospitable entertainers had persuaded him he should be . Mrs Centum declared afterwards that she could not form the least idea what Lucilla meant by it , she who was generally so civil to everybody . But it is not necessary to say that Miss Marjoribanks knew perfectly well what she was doing , and felt it imperatively necessary to bring down General Travers to his proper level . Carlingford could exist perfectly well without him and his officers ; but Lucilla did not mean that the society she had taken so much pains to form should be condescended to by a mere soldier . And then , after all , she was only human , and it was not to be expected she could pass over the blank look with which her visitor turned to herself , after having by evil fortune cast his eyes upon Rose Lake . At the same time , Miss Marjoribanks , always magnanimous , did not blame Rose , who had no hand whatever in the matter ; and if she avenged herself in a ladylike and satisfactory manner , it is not to be supposed that it was simply a sense of offence which actuated Lucilla . She did it , on the contrary , on strictly philosophical principles , having perceived that Mrs Centum was spoiling her General , and that it was absolutely necessary that he should be disabused . When they left , Mrs Centum was almost afraid to put the question that trembled on her lips . She uttered it at last , faltering , and with a very doubtful expression , for she could not conceal from herself the fact that the General had been snubbed . "
118399	118477	118395	118395	you	3020	" she said , in the most humble way ; and then she turned away her face . She could bear it , whatever it might be . She said to herself that so long as the children were well , and the holidays about over , she could bear anything ; and what did it matter to her about the officers?—but at the same time she preferred to avert her face when she received the blow . "
118496	118508	118488	118488	I	0	" said the General , and he gave a little laugh . "
118534	118554	118527	118527	I	0	" said the unsuspecting man ; and then Mrs Centum turned round upon him with a kind of horror . "
118588	118593	118585	118586	an heiress	3026	" cried Mrs Centum , "
118675	118689	118664	118666	little Rose Lake	108	" said Mrs Centum , with cruel distinctness . The General only said , "
118692	119535	119536	119536	She	3036	" but it was in a crestfallen tone ; for to be snubbed by one lady , and struck with sudden enthusiasm for another , who , after all , was not a lady to speak of , but only a drawing - master 's daughter , was rather hard upon the poor man . Thus it was the soldier , who in ordinary circumstances ought to have been the most successful , who began in the most cruel and uncomfortable way his campaign in Carlingford . Miss Marjoribanks , except for her habitual walk , did not go out much that day . She was too much occupied with what she had in hand . She could not conceive — for Lucilla naturally took a reasonable view of affairs in general , and did not account for the action of any such unknown quantity as love , for example — why Mr Cavendish should conceal himself so carefully from society in Carlingford , and yet run all the risk of meeting Barbara Lake in the evenings . It seemed to Lucilla inconceivable , and yet it was impossible not to believe it . Mr Cavendish , though she had seen him on the very verge of a proposal , did not present himself to her mind in the aspect of a man who would consider the world well lost for any such transitory passion ; neither , as was natural , did Barbara Lake appear to Lucilla the least like a person calculated to call forth that sentiment ; but nevertheless it must be true , and the only way to account for it was by thinking , after all , what fools They were , and what poor judges , and how little to be depended on , when women were concerned . Miss Marjoribanks was determined to lose no more time , but to speak to Mr Cavendish , if it was Mr Cavendish , and she could get the chance , quite plainly of the situation of affairs — to let him know how much she knew , and to spur him up to come forward like a man and brave anything the Archdeacon could do . Had it been any small personal aim that moved Lucilla , no doubt she would have shrunk from such a decided step ; but it was , on the contrary , the broadest philanthropical combination of Christian principles , help to the weak and succour to the oppressed , and a little , just a very little , of the equally Evangelical idea of humbling the proud and bringing down the mighty . She was so much occupied with her plans that it was with a little difficulty she roused herself to keep up the conversation with her father at dinner , and be as amusing and agreeable as ordinary ; which indeed was more than ordinarily her duty , since Dr Marjoribanks came in , in a fractious and disturbed state of mind , discontented with things in general . The truth was , he had got a letter from Tom Marjoribanks from India , where that unlucky man had gone . It was all very well and natural to go to India , and Lucilla had felt , indeed , rather satisfied with herself for having helped forward that desirable conclusion , especially after the Doctor had taken pains to explain to her , not knowing that she had any share in it , that it was the very best thing for Tom to do . For it has been already said that Dr Marjoribanks , though he liked Tom , and thought it very odd that Providence should have given the girl to him , and the boy to his incapable sister - in - law , who did not in the least know how to manage him , had no desire to have his nephew for a son - in - law . Going to India was very right and proper , and the best thing to do ; for a man might get on there , even at the bar , who would have no chance here ; but after he had made one step in the right direction , it was only to be expected that all sorts of misfortunes should happen to Tom . He was wrecked , which might have been looked for , and he lost his boxes , with the greater part of his outfit , either at that unhappy moment , or in the Desert , or at an after part of his unlucky career ; and the object of the letter which Dr Marjoribanks had just received was to get money to make up for his losses . Tom , who was a very good son , did not want to vex his mother , and accordingly it was his uncle whom he applied to , to sell out a portion of the money he had in the Funds . "
119562	119566	119536	119536	She	3036	" wrote Tom , "
119580	119581	119568	119568	you	3037	" "
119591	119612	119568	119568	you	3037	" said Dr Marjoribanks , as if that could possibly be brought against the unfortunate young man as a crime . "
119622	119626	119619	119619	his	3038	" said Lucilla ; "
119662	119663	119654	119654	he	3038	" "
119676	119681	119666	119666	he	3038	" said the Doctor . "
119724	119725	119726	119726	Papa	94	" "
119733	119738	119726	119726	Papa	94	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
119795	119796	119797	119797	I	0	" "
119806	119811	119797	119797	I	0	" said Dr Marjoribanks , "
119833	119921	119924	119924	he	3038	" When he said this the Doctor gave a sharp glance at his daughter , to see if by chance that might perhaps be what she was thinking of ; but naturally the maiden candour and unsuspecting innocence of Lucilla was proof to such glances . She took no notice at all of the implied suspicion . But though it was very absurd for anybody to think that she would have married him , it was not in Miss Marjoribanks 's nature to be disloyal to Tom . "
119934	119938	119939	119939	she	4476	" said Lucilla ; "
120011	120554	120007	120007	he	3038	" and with this calm expression of her interest Miss Marjoribanks went upstairs . When the Doctor became thus aware of his daughter 's sentiments , it seemed to him that he was more at liberty to be kind to his nephew . He had never been able to divest himself of a little lurking dread , an inherent idea which was so obstinate that it felt like a prophecy , that somehow or other , after costing her father so much , and making such a difference in the house , Lucilla , who on the whole was a dear production , would fall to Tom 's share , with all Dr Marjoribanks 's other possessions ; and the Doctor saw no reason why he should work and lay up money for a boy whom Providence , with a wonderful want of discrimination , had bestowed , not upon him , but upon Mrs John Marjoribanks . However , when that question was settled and done with , his heart began to relent to Tom the unlucky , who , after all , when the son - in - law hypothesis was fully dismissed , was his natural born nephew , and , as Lucilla said , very nice in his way , poor fellow ! The Doctor began to write him a letter , and softened more and more with every line he wrote ; but as for Lucilla , she had something more immediately important to occupy her upstairs . The fact was that Miss Marjoribanks had found a shadowy figure in black in the corner of one of the sofas when she came into the drawing - room — a - figure with a veil down , and a large shawl , and a tremulous air . It was very seldom that Mrs Mortimer took courage to visit her young patroness ; and to go out at night , except sometimes to Salem Chapel when there was a meeting , and when the timid woman represented to herself that it was her duty , was a thing unknown to her . But yet , nevertheless , it was Mrs Mortimer who sat waiting for Lucilla . They had not met since that momentous interview in which the widow revealed her history to Miss Marjoribanks 's sympathetic ears , and the poor woman had been able to bear no longer the solitude of her cottage , and her garden - walls , and her little pupils , and Mary Jane . To know that something was going on outside that concerned her — to hear the waves , as it were , beating round the walls of her prison , and never to have even so much as a peep at them , what they were about , if the tide was beginning to turn , or the wind to change , or the lifeboat to appear — was more than Mrs Mortimer , even with all her training to patience , could put up with ; and accordingly she had made a frantic rush out , under cover of night , to see if there was anything to see , and hear if there was anything to hear . "
120577	120582	120555	120555	You	3048	" said the widow . "
120616	120617	120599	120599	I	0	" "
120628	120632	120633	120633	You	3048	" said Lucilla . "
120665	120666	120650	120650	you	3048	" "
120676	120681	120650	120650	you	3048	" said Mrs Mortimer ; "
120800	120801	120786	120786	he	3049	" "
120812	120816	120807	120807	himself	3049	" said Lucilla . "
120847	120848	120853	120853	Lucilla	119	" "
120859	120865	120853	120853	Lucilla	119	" said the poor widow . "
120906	120969	120970	120970	You	119	" As she made this forlorn statement it was only natural that the poor woman should cry a little . This was no doubt the result of the four garden - walls that closed in so tightly , and the aggravating little pupils ; but Miss Marjoribanks felt it was not a state of feeling that could be allowed to go on . "
120999	121088	120994	120994	you	119	" said Lucilla , with a certain reproachful tenderness . As for Mrs Mortimer , she raised her head and dried her eyes when Miss Marjoribanks began to speak , and looked at her in a somewhat eager , inquiring way ; but when Lucilla uttered those last reassuring words , it is undeniable that the widow 's countenance fell a little . She faltered and grew pale again , and only cried the more — perhaps with gratitude , perhaps with disappointment . And when she said , "
121099	121231	121092	121092	you	119	" which was all the poor soul could utter , it was in a very tremulous undecided voice . The fact that she had always the sympathy and co - operation of such a friend as Miss Marjoribanks , did not seem to have the exhilarating effect upon her that it ought to have had . It did not apparently do any more for her than the similar reassurance that Lucilla was coming to tea did for Rose Lake . But then , like every other benefactor of the human race , Miss Marjoribanks was aware that the human mind has its moments of unbelief . It was a discouraging experience to meet with ; but she never permitted it seriously to interrupt her exertions for the good of her kind . "
121244	121263	121264	121264	You	119	" said Lucilla , who after all was giving only a stone when her suppliant asked for bread . "
121285	121286	121291	121291	you	119	" "
121301	121309	121291	121291	you	119	" cried Mrs Mortimer , with compunction . "
121354	121367	121346	121346	one	4465	" said the widow , with more feeling than distinctness of expression , "
121440	121441	121442	121442	My	0	" "
121445	121450	121442	121442	My	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
121547	121556	121535	121535	you	119	" said Lucilla , with a little scorn . "
121601	121807	121810	121810	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , piercing through and through the thin armour of her incapable assailant . Naturally all the widow 's defences fell before this ruthless response . She cried with a mingled sensation of shame at being found out , and penitence for being so ungrateful , and a certain desolate distress with her own incapacity and want of power to defend herself . It was an acute variety of feminine anguish on the whole . The idea that she , a mature woman , a married woman and widow , who ought to have been done with all these vanities , should have been found out by a young girl to be thinking about a gentleman , struck poor Mrs Mortimer with a sharp sense of shame as if her wistful preoccupation had been a crime . Indeed the chances are , if it had been a crime , she would not have been nearly so much ashamed of it . She hid her face in her hands and blushed down to the very edge of her black dress and up into the glooms of her widow 's veil ; and all the self - defence she was capable of was a faint "
121812	121835	121810	121810	Lucilla	119	" a mere appeal of weakness without reason — a virtual throwing of herself in acknowledged guilt at her judge 's feet . "
121843	121848	121836	121836	Thomas	117	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
121910	121915	121916	121916	I	0	" said Lucilla seriously . "
121963	121964	121939	121939	I	0	" "
121999	122375	121997	121997	Lucilla	119	" said poor Mrs Mortimer . But Lucilla would not let her go home ; and by the time tea was ready , and Dr Marjoribanks had come upstairs , she had so managed to soothe her visitor 's nerves , and console her spirits , that the Doctor himself grew complimentary . He was so civil , in fact , that Lucilla felt slightly startled , and on the whole thought it was as well that the Archdeacon was at hand , and affairs in a promising way ; for it was doubtful whether even Miss Marjoribanks 's magnanimity could have got over any ridiculous exhibition of interest on the part of her father , who certainly was old enough to know better . Even to see him taking Mrs Mortimer 's tea to her , and congratulating her upon her improved looks , and felicitating himself and the world in general on the fact that Carlingford agreed with her , was aggravating to his daughter — more aggravating , though it is strange to say so , than even the blank looks of General Travers in the morning , or his transference of the homage intended for herself to little Rose Lake ; that was no more than a blunder , and Lucilla felt a consolatory conviction that , so far as incivility went , the General had received a very satisfactory set - off . But to see Dr Marjoribanks exerting himself in such an unheard - of way made her open her eyes . If he were still accessible to such influences , nobody could answer for anything that might happen ; and the widow was so grateful for his kindness , that at one moment it was all that Lucilla could do to keep her lips shut fast , and restrain herself from a tempting allusion which would have made an end of Mrs Mortimer . It was the first time that Lucilla 's protégée had ventured to come thus familiarly and uninvited to her friend 's house ; and the Doctor , who knew no special reason for the visit , expressed his satisfaction with a warmth which was quite uncalled - for , and hoped that Lucilla might often "
122383	122392	121997	121997	Lucilla	119	" and actually betrayed symptoms of a disposition to "
122397	122495	121997	121997	Lucilla	119	" if Miss Marjoribanks had not already made provision for that emergency . When the visitor had finally departed , under the charge of Thomas and Mary Jane , the father and daughter regarded each other , for the first time , with dubious glances — for , as far as Lucilla was concerned , it was a revelation to her of a new and altogether unsuspected danger ; and the Doctor , for his part , was very conciliatory , and showed a certain consciousness of having committed himself , which made matters twenty times worse . "
122508	122513	122498	122498	Lucilla	119	" said Dr Marjoribanks . "
122542	122562	122563	122563	I	0	" he added incautiously ; as if he , at his age , had anything to do with that . "
122573	122582	122571	122571	papa	295	" said Lucilla , in her dutiful way . "
122667	123303	123304	123305	Poor Tom	105	" Miss Marjoribanks continued , with an inflection of compassionate tolerance in her voice . As for the Doctor , he mistook her as usual , and took her tone of pity and kindly patronising disdain for another instance of his daughter 's policy and high art ; whereas the truth was she was quite in earnest , and meant every word she said . And then Dr Marjoribanks 's sense of humour was keener than that of Lucilla . After this the conversation flagged slightly , for Miss Marjoribanks had undeniably received a shock . In the midst of her benevolent preoccupation and care for other people , it had suddenly dawned upon her that her own stronghold might be attacked , and the tables turned upon her in the twinkling of an eye . There are days of discouragement in the most triumphant career and this was one of those uncomfortable moments . Her faith in herself did not fail her for an instant ; but the faith of her natural born subjects — the creatures of her bounty — had visibly failed her . Neither Rose Lake nor Mrs Mortimer had shown that confidence in Lucilla 's genius which experience and loyalty both called upon them to show . When Dr Marjoribanks had gone downstairs to resume the case which he was writing out for the Lancet , Lucilla passed through one of those moments of sublime despondency which now and then try the spirits of the benefactors of their race . A few tears came to her eyes as she reflected upon this great problem . Without such trials genius would not fully know itself nor be justly aware of its own strength . For no temptation to give up her disinterested exertions had any effect upon the mind of Miss Marjoribanks ; and even her sense of pain at the unbelief of her followers was mingled with that pity for their weakness which involves pardon . Even when they wounded her she was sorry for them . It was nature that was in fault , and not the fallible human creatures who had it not in them to believe in the simple force of genius . When Lucilla had shed these few tears over her subjects ' weakness and want of faith , she rose up again in new strength from the momentary downfall . It was , as we have said , a sublime moment . The idea of giving them up , and leaving their affairs to their own guidance , never for an instant penetrated into her heroic mind ; but she was human , and naturally she felt the prick of ingratitude . When the crisis was over she rose up calmly and lighted her candle , and went to her room with a smile upon her magnanimous lips . As she performed that simple action , Lucilla had lifted up the feeble widow , and taken the family of Lakes , and Mr Cavendish , and even the burly Archdeacon himself , upon her shoulders . They might be ungrateful , or even unaware of all she was doing for them ; but they had the supreme claim of Need upon Strength ; and Miss Marjoribanks , notwithstanding the wound they had given her , was loyal to that appeal , and to her own consciousness of superior Power . At the same time , it would not be just to omit all mention of a consolatory recollection which occurred to Lucilla in this moment of her weakness . At such a crisis the mind of genius may be supported by a matter very trifling in itself . Even at the instant when the moisture sprang to her eyes , Miss Marjoribanks said to herself , "
123307	123424	123304	123305	Poor Tom	105	" and felt that the bitterness , to a certain extent , had evaporated out of her tears . He was a long way off , and Lucilla would have thought it madness indeed to connect herself in any way with the fortunes of her unlucky cousin ; yet it gave her a certain support to think that , amid all the want of faith she was encountering , Tom believed in her , heart and soul . It was an insignificant matter , so far as any practical result was concerned , if , indeed , anything can be called insignificant which gives strength to a great mind in a moment of discouragement . She said "
123428	123517	123304	123305	Poor Tom	105	" and felt as if for the moment she had something to lean on , and was comforted . We mention this fact rather as a contribution to the history of those phenomena of the human mind , which have as yet escaped the metaphysician , than as an actual circumstance in the life of Miss Marjoribanks . She was a woman of genius , and he only a very simple , unlucky fellow ; and yet a sensation of comfort came to Lucilla 's heart when she said "
123521	123948	123949	123949	I	0	" Lucilla prepared her toilette the next evening , to take tea with the Lakes , with greater care than she would have spent upon a party of much greater pretensions . She was , to be sure , dressed as usual in the white dress , high , which she had brought into fashion in Carlingford ; but then that simple evening toilette required many adjuncts which were not necessary on other occasions , seeing that this time she was going to walk to her destination , and had in her mind the four distinct aims of pleasing Rose , of dazzling Barbara , of imposing upon Mr Cavendish , and , finally , of being , as always , in harmony with herself . She was as punctual to the hour and minute of her engagement as if she had been a queen ; and , indeed , it was with a demeanour as gracious that she entered the little house in Grove Street , where , naturally , there had been also sundry preparations made for her visit . Mr Lake himself , who had postponed his usual walk , and was taking his tea an hour later than usual , received his young visitor with all the suavity natural to him ; and as for Barbara , she did the honours with a certain suppressed exultation and air of triumph , which proved to Lucilla that her plan was indeed an inspiration of genius . As for Rose , it would be impossible to describe what were her sensations . Her faith still failed her at that momentous hour . She was sceptical of Lucilla , and naturally of all the world , and regarded everybody with jealous scrutiny and expectation and distrust , as was natural to a young conspirator . She was profoundly excited and curious to know what Miss Marjoribanks meant to do ; and at the same time she did not believe in Miss Marjoribanks , and was almost disposed to betray and interfere with her , if such treachery had been possible . It was Rose Lucilla specially came to visit , and yet Rose was the only one who was cool to her , and did not seem fully to appreciate her condescension ; but then , happily , Miss Marjoribanks was magnanimous , and at the same time had a purpose to support her , which was much more comprehensive and of larger application than anything that had entered into the mind of Rose Lake . "
123962	123967	123949	123949	I	0	" said Mr Lake . "
124025	124111	124112	124112	I	0	" said the drawing - master , with mild grandeur ; and he looked round upon the walls of his parlour , which were hung with his own drawings , and where one of Willie 's held the place of honour . In all Carlingford there was no other house that enjoyed a similar distinction ; and , consequently , it was with a delicious sense of chivalrous deference yet equality that the exceptional man of Grove Street received the young sovereign of Grange Lane . "
124122	124126	124119	124120	Mr Lake	93	" said Lucilla . "
124183	124213	124177	124177	anybody	313	" said Miss Marjoribanks . And as for Mr Lake , he was so overpowered by this implied reproach upon his hospitality that he scarcely knew how to reply . "
124236	124242	124243	124243	I	0	" said Mr Lake anxiously . "
124288	124289	124284	124284	I	0	" "
124301	124961	124294	124294	I	0	" said Lucilla . And when the tea came it was all she could do to keep herself quiet , and remember that she was a visitor , and not take it out of the incapable hands of Barbara , who never gave her father the right amount of sugar in his tea . To tell the truth , Barbara 's thoughts were occupied by a very different subject ; and even Rose had but little attention to spare for her papa 's comforts at that special moment . But Lucilla 's larger mind embraced everything . She sat with her very fingers itching to cut the bread - and - butter for him , and give him a cup of tea as he liked it ; and asked herself , with indignation , what was the use of that great creature , with her level eyebrows and her crimson bloom , who could not take the trouble to remember that three lumps was what Mr Lake liked . Miss Marjoribanks had never taken tea with him before ; but his second cup , had she dispensed it , would have been exactly to his taste — which was a thing Barbara had not learned to make it in all these years . No wonder that a certain sense of contemptuous indignation arose for one moment , even in the calm and impartial bosom of genius . Perhaps Rose would not have done much better ; but then Rose was good for something else , which was always a set - off on the other side . Thus it will be seen that Lucilla had a respect for use , even of a kind which in her own person she did not much appreciate , as became a person of a truly enlightened mind ; but a creature who was of no earthly good irritated her well - regulated spirit ; for , to be sure , the possession of a fine contralto ( which is , at the same time , not fine enough to be made use of professionally ) is not a matter of sufficient moment in this world to excuse a young woman for not knowing how to give her father a comfortable cup of tea . It was nearly nine o'clock before Mr Lake went out for his walk , and by that time it was almost dark , and the lamp outside was lighted , which was not far from the door . Lucilla had taken a seat near the window , with the view of witnessing everything ; and it can not be denied that she felt a little excited when Barbara went out of the room after her father , leaving Rose alone with her guest . Miss Marjoribanks 's heart gave a beat or two the more in the first minute , though before the next had passed it had fallen into its usual measure . There were no candles as yet in the parlour , and Grove Street — or at least the bit of it which lay before the window , lighted by the lamp outside , and relieved against a little square of bluish - green sky which intervened between Miss Hemmings 's house and that of old Mr Wrangle on the opposite side — was very clear to the interested spectator . There was nobody visible but an organ - man , who was grinding a popular melody very dolorously out of his box , in what Rose would have called the middle distance ; and beyond , Miss Jane Hemmings looking out of the long staircase window , and three little boys in different attitudes below,—that is , if one did not count a tall figure which , perhaps with the view of listening to the music of the organ , was coming and going in a limited circuit round the light of the lamp . "
124973	124977	124294	124294	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
125036	125037	125038	125038	She	120	" "
125043	125063	125038	125038	She	120	" said Rose , who began to feel all the enormity of her conduct in thus betraying her sister . "
125091	125092	125086	125086	you	119	" "
125097	125102	125095	125095	Rose	108	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
125172	125195	125169	125169	I	0	" said Lucilla , with gentle satisfaction . But by this time poor little Rose had roused herself into an innocent fury . "
125203	125217	125200	125200	you	0	" said Rose , laying an impatient grasp on Miss Marjoribanks 's arm . "
125296	125622	125623	125623	My	0	" Miss Marjoribanks , as was natural , took no notice of this childish fury . She was sitting just where she had been sitting all the evening , within sight of the street lamp and the organ - grinder , and Miss Jane Hemmings at the staircase window;—just where Barbara had placed her , and where that young woman calculated on finding her , when she made a promenade of triumph up the partially lighted street by the side of her clandestine suitor . Perhaps Barbara had seen Miss Jane as well , and knew that public opinion was thus watching over her ; but at all events she was not at all ashamed of herself , or indignant at being spied upon . On the contrary , it was a kind of apotheosis for Barbara , only second to the grand and crowning triumph which would be accomplished in Carlingford Church under the shadow of that veil of real Brussels , which grew more and more real every day . Thus neither the actors in the drama , nor the principal spectator , were in the smallest degree disturbed by horror or shame or sense of guilt , excepting always the fanciful little Rose , who suffered for everybody ; who could have wished that the earth would open and swallow up Barbara and her lover ; who could have slaughtered Lucilla on the spot , and given herself over to any kind of torture for her treachery . Naturally nobody paid any sort of attention to Rose . Barbara , for her part , took her admirer 's arm in the twilight with a swelling of exultation , which the gaining of the very highest prize in the department of ornamental art could scarcely have conveyed to the bosom of the little artist ; and Lucilla put back her small assailant softly with her hand , and smoothed down her ruffled plumes . "
125634	125638	125628	125629	Miss Hemmings	202	" said Lucilla ; "
125676	126045	125665	125666	a dear	4479	" And then there followed a pause , which was a terrible pause for Rose . The organ - grinder stopped his doleful ditty , and there was scarcely any sound to be heard in the street except the footsteps approaching and retiring , the measured tread of two people occupied with each other , going now more slowly , now more quickly , as the humour seized them , or as their conversation grew in interest ; even the sound of their voices came by times to the auditors — Barbara 's with an occasional laugh or tone of triumph , and the other deeper , with which Rose had but little acquaintance , but which was perfectly known to Lucilla . All this time , while her companion sat panting in the dark corner , Miss Marjoribanks was looking to the joints of her harness , and feeling the edge of her weapons . For , after all , it was no small enterprise upon which she was going forth . She was going to denounce the faithless knight to his face , and take him out of the hands of the enchantress ; but then she herself meant to take him in hand , and show him his true dangers , and vindicate his honour . A more disinterested enterprise was never undertaken by any knight - errant . Yet , at the same time , Lucilla could not help entertaining a certain involuntary contempt for the man who had deserted her own standard to put himself under that of Barbara Lake , and who was being paraded up and down here without knowing it , to gratify the vanity of his new sovereign , and make an exhibition of his weakness . Lucilla would have been more than mortal if she had not felt the difference between her own rule , which would have been all to his good , and the purely egotistical sway of Barbara ; and even in her magnanimous mind , it was impossible that pity itself should not be mingled with a certain disdain . She sat quite still for so long that Barbara grew intoxicated with her triumph . "
126053	126127	125665	125666	a dear	4479	" Lucilla said to herself , with a movement of compassion ; and the breadth of her human sympathy was such that she waited till the very latest moment , and let the deluded young woman have the full enjoyment of her imaginary victory . Then Miss Marjoribanks rose with a certain solemnity , and put on her hat , and gave an unappreciated kiss to Rose , who kept in her corner . "
126136	126468	126132	126132	I	0	" said Lucilla . The words were simple enough , but yet they rang in Rose 's ears like the signal of a conspiracy . When the calm leader of the expedition went forth , sensible of the importance of her mission , but tranquil as great minds always are in a moment of danger , Rose got up too and followed , trembling in every limb . She was capable of having thrown herself upon the spears in her own person in a sudden élan of indignation and passion ; but she was not capable of waiting till the right moment , and meeting her antagonists in reasonable combat . Miss Marjoribanks went out deliberately , without any unnecessary haste , sweeping into the dusky twilight with her virginal white draperies . It was a very ordinary scene , and yet , even in the midst of her excitement , Rose could not help observing involuntarily its pictorial qualities — if only any painter could have transferred to his canvas the subdued musical hum of surrounding life , the fragrance of the mignonette , and the peaceful stillness of the summer night . The sky shone out green - blue , lambent and wistful , from the vacant space between Miss Hemmings 's and Mr Wrangle 's , and there were the dusky twilight shadows below , and the yellow gleam of the lamp , and Barbara 's exulting , triumphant figure , and the white robes of the avenging angel . Rose could not have observed all this if she had not been stilled into a kind of breathless awe by the solemn character of the situation , which struck her as being somehow like one of Millais 's pictures . As for the lovers , they had just turned at the moment that Miss Marjoribanks came out , and consequently met her straight in the face , as she stood suave and smiling at the little garden door . "
126474	126478	126471	126472	Mr Cavendish	115	" said Lucilla ; "
126515	126840	126512	126512	your	115	" This was the greeting she addressed to Barbara Lake 's lover . For his part he stood before her , growing red and growing pale , struck dumb by the unlooked - for meeting , and with such a sense of being ashamed of himself as never before had entered his mind , though , no doubt , he had done worse actions in his day . Even Barbara had not calculated upon this open encounter ; and instead of giving him any assistance , as was a woman 's duty in such a case , she only tossed her head , and giggled with an embarrassment which was more pride than shame . As for Mr Cavendish , he would have liked to disappear under the pavement , if it had been possible . For once he and Rose were agreed . If a gulf had opened before him , he would have jumped into it without ever pausing to ask himself why . And yet all the time Miss Marjoribanks was looking as placid as if she had been in her own drawing - room , and expecting his reply to her friendly observations . When he realised that he ought to say something , Mr Cavendish felt that he had as much need to wipe his forehead as ever the Archdeacon had . He turned hot and cold , and felt his mind and his tongue frozen , and could not find a word to say . With a sudden horror he woke up , like one of Comus 's revellers , and found himself changed into the likeness of the creature he consorted with . If he had found an ass 's head on his shoulders , he could not have felt more startled and horrified than when he heard himself , in the imbecility of the moment , giggle like Barbara , and answer to Lucilla 's remark , "
126850	126851	126512	126512	your	115	" "
126862	126867	126852	126852	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
126926	126987	126916	126916	you	3104	" said Lucilla , pressing another kiss upon her little friend 's unwilling cheek . When she had done this , she put out her hand to Barbara , and passed her , sweeping her white garments through the narrow gateway . She took Mr Cavendish 's arm as if he had been a young brother come to fetch her . "
126996	127001	127002	127002	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
127030	127763	127022	127023	your papa	3111	" This was how she carried off Mr Cavendish finally out of Barbara 's very fingers , and under her very eyes . When the two sisters were left standing together at the door , they could do nothing but stare at each other in the extremity of their amazement . Rose , for her part , remained but a moment , and then , feeling by far the guiltiest and most miserable of the whole party , ran upstairs to her own room and cried as if her heart would break . Barbara , on the contrary , who was past crying , stood still at the door , and watched Lucilla 's white dress disappearing on the way to Grange Lane with indescribable emotions . A young woman can not call the police , or appeal to the crier , when it is her lover whom she has lost : but to see him carried off by the strong hand — to watch him gradually going away and disappearing from her eyes — to hear his steps withdrawing into the distance — was such a trial as few are called upon to bear . She stood and looked after him , and could not believe her eyes . And then it was all so sudden — an affair of a moment . Barbara could not realise how the world had turned round , and this revolution had been effected;—one minute she had been leaning on his arm triumphant , making a show and exhibition of him in the pride of her heart , though he did not know it ; and the next was not she standing here watching him with a blank countenance and a despairing heart , while Lucilla had pounced upon him and carried him off in her cruel grasp ? The blow was so sudden , that Barbara stood speechless and motionless till the two departing figures had vanished in the darkness . Would he come back again to - morrow , or was he gone for ever and ever ? Such were the thoughts of the forsaken maiden , as she stood paralysed under this sudden change of fortune , at her father 's door . If some cruel spectator had thrown into the fire that Brussels veil with which her imagination had so long played , and Barbara had stood heart - struck , watching the filmy tissue dissolve into ashes before her eyes , her sense of sudden anguish could not have been more acute . Yet , after all , Barbara 's pangs were nothing to those of Mr Cavendish , as he felt Miss Marjoribanks 's light touch on his arm , and felt his doomed feet turn in spite of himself in the most dangerous direction , and became conscious that he was being led beyond all possibility of resistance , back to Grange Lane and to his fate . To be sure it was dark , which was one consolation ; but it was not dark enough to conceal Lucilla 's white dress , nor the well - known form and lineaments of the young monarch of Grange Lane , in whose company nobody could pass unobserved . Mr Cavendish could have faced danger by sea and land with the average amount of courage ; but the danger of the walk down the little street , which afterwards led to St Roque 's , and up the embowered stillness of Grange Lane , was more than he was equal to . He could not be sure of making a single step by these garden - walls without meeting somebody who knew him — somebody whose curiosity might ruin him in Carlingford ; or even without the risk of encountering in the face of that arch - enemy , who would not go away , and whose presence had banished him from the place . It may be supposed that , under these terrible circumstances , Mr Cavendish 's thoughts of Barbara , who had got him into this scrape , were far from lover - like . He was a man universally popular among ladies , and who owed a great deal of the social consideration which he prized so highly to this fact ; and yet the most gentle sentiment in his mind at that moment , was a "
127768	127832	127022	127023	your papa	3111	" which he breathed to himself , all low and deep , as he went slowly along by Lucilla 's side . As for Miss Marjoribanks , her thoughts were of a very much more serious description than anything her unlucky escort was thinking of , and a minute or two passed in silence before she could make up her mind to speak . "
127852	127856	127833	127833	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
127876	127877	127864	127864	I	0	" "
127892	127901	127882	127882	you	3113	" said the victim , with rueful politeness . "
127931	127932	127920	127920	she	4404	" "
127935	127948	127920	127920	she	4404	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a certain solemnity , interrupting him ; "
127968	128024	127965	127966	Mr Cavendish	115	" When she had said this Lucilla sighed , and her sigh found a terrible echo in her hearer 's bosom . She knew that he turned green in the darkness as he gave an anxious look at her . But he was too much alarmed to give her an opportunity of studying his face . "
128029	128038	127965	127966	Mr Cavendish	115	" he said , and tried to laugh ; "
128047	128074	128041	128043	my kind friends	3116	" and for one moment the sufferer tried to delude himself that it was some innocent gossip about Barbara which might be circulating in Grange Lane . "
128077	128081	128041	128043	my kind friends	3116	" said Lucilla , "
128123	128238	128112	128113	Mr Cavendish	115	" Miss Marjoribanks added , waving her hand in the direction of Grove Street . And then Barbara Lake and everything connected with her vanished like a shadow from the unfortunate man 's mind . It was horribly ungrateful on his part , but it was , as Miss Marjoribanks would have said , just what might have been expected , and how They always behave . He had no longer any time or patience for the object which had been giving occupation and interest to his solitude . He woke up in a moment , and gave a passing curse to his folly , and faced the real danger as he best could . "
128249	128257	128246	128247	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" he said , with some bitterness ; "
128298	128372	128289	128289	he	3118	" said Mr Cavendish . He breathed a deep hard breath as he spoke , and the blood came back to his face . Perhaps for the first moment he felt satisfied , and breathed freer after it was over ; but at the same time it was very dreadful to him to feel that he was found out , and that henceforth Grange Lane would shut its doors and avert its countenance . "
128388	128394	128381	128381	I	0	" he continued , bitterly . "
128410	128460	128461	128461	You	0	" This the poor man said in his despair , because he did not know what he was saying ; for in reality he knew that women had been his best friends , and that he had still a chance , if the judgment was to rest with them . "
128469	128474	128461	128461	You	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
128516	128625	128626	128627	A lady	4506	" said Lucilla ; and then there was a pause . As for Mr Cavendish , it would be altogether impossible to describe the state of his mind . He was like a man suddenly reprieved , but giddy with the shock , and feeling the halter still round his neck , and knowing that he had himself undermined the ground on which he was standing . It was Lucilla who supported him in the shock of the moment , for all his self - command could not keep him from a momentary shiver and stagger when he found that things were not so bad as he thought . "
128636	128654	128630	128630	she	4506	" he muttered , under his breath ; and then he made an effort to recover himself . "
128686	128780	128683	128684	a lady	4506	" said Mr Cavendish , and he laughed again in a discordant unsteady way . Lucilla regarded him through all these fluctuations with natural pity , and at the same time with the calmness of a knowledge which was aware of all and had nothing more to discover ; and at the end Mr Cavendish perceived her calm , and the absence of wonder and curiosity in her face , and began to perceive that he had something very serious to deal with — more serious even than he had at first supposed . "
128791	128796	128781	128781	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
128819	128993	128811	128811	I	0	" It was for this they stopped short at the foot of Grange Lane just where the land was already parcelled out for St Roque 's . What Lucilla was going to say was too important to be spoken while walking , and she withdrew her hand from Mr Cavendish 's arm . They were both so much absorbed that they did not see anybody coming , nor indeed had any attention to spare for external affairs . The blood had deserted Mr Cavendish 's face , and he was once more green with anxiety and inquietude . He stood facing her , feeling that the crisis of his fate had come , and not knowing whether it was absolute despair or a faint dawning of hope that possessed him . If he had been the most passionate of lovers , and if she had held in her hands the dreadful alternative between rapture and misery , there could not have been a more rapt and absorbing attention in Mr Cavendish 's face . "
129012	129016	129017	129017	you	3127	" said Lucilla ; "
129040	129044	129033	129033	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added compassionately—"everything
129088	129161	129081	129081	you	3127	" What Mr Cavendish might have answered to this solemn appeal it would be vain to imagine ; for the truth was , he was stopped before he could utter a word . He was stopped and seized by the hand , and greeted with a frankness which was , perhaps , all the more loud and cordial from what appeared to the new - comer the comic character of the situation . "
129169	129187	129164	129164	Cavendish	115	" the intruder exclaimed , waving his hand to some people who were coming on behind him . "
129226	129321	129326	129326	me	0	" General Travers added , taking off his hat . It was Mr and Mrs Centum who were coming down behind him — she with a light shawl thrown over her head , tempted out by the beauty of the evening ; and Lucilla saw in a moment the consequences of this encounter , and how it would be over all Carlingford before to - morrow morning that she and Mr Cavendish were betrothed at the very least . Miss Marjoribanks had all her wits about her , as ever , fortunately for both . "
129328	129333	129326	129326	me	0	" she said calmly ; "
129380	129397	129374	129374	we	3133	" Lucilla added , with a smile , taking once more the unfortunate man 's arm . "
129406	129823	129374	129374	we	3133	" said Mrs Centum , with a laugh ; but yet , notwithstanding , everybody felt sure that it was all Lucilla 's cleverness , and that Barbara Lake was a myth and fiction . And it was thus , with Miss Marjoribanks leaning on his arm , and General Travers , in all the warmth of renewed friendship , guarding him on the other side , that Mr Cavendish , whose head was in a whirl of excitement , and who did not know what he was doing , was led back in triumph past Colonel Chiley 's very door , where the Archdeacon was lying in wait to crunch his bones , back from all his aberrations into the very heart of Grange Lane . Mr Cavendish was led back to his own house that evening by General Travers , whose claim of acquaintance was too decided to be rejected . He never knew very well what passed between the moment when Miss Marjoribanks began to expound to him the urgent necessity that he should confide in her , and the moment in which he found himself in his own house , admitted eagerly by the surprised and anxious servants , and conducted by the energetic soldier . That he had taken leave of Lucilla at her own door , that he had watched her white dress sweep away into the dark garden with a faint sense that it was his only remaining protector who thus left him , and that after that he had smoked a horrible cigar with Mr Centum , and been accompanied home by the old acquaintance , who had turned up at so unlucky a moment,—was all that the poor man was aware of . And yet it is to be supposed that on the whole he behaved himself very much like other people , since General Travers had no distinct idea that his company was undesirable , or that his cordial recognition was anything but welcome . The General , indeed , took it as quite natural , under the circumstances , that Cavendish should be a little confused . A man who is no longer a very young man , and has a character to support , does not care to be found mooning with the object of his affections on a summer evening , like a boy of twenty ; and General Travers was perfectly aware that he had thus a very good joke against Cavendish . "
129841	129846	129848	129848	Jove	130	" the General said . "
129869	129906	129859	129860	a fellow	5393	" and for his own part he was very ready to seize upon his former acquaintance , a man who belonged to his club , and had a chance to know what he was talking about . "
129912	129917	129859	129860	a fellow	5393	" the soldier said , "
129965	130042	130044	130044	himself	206	" General Travers added , with flattering cordiality ; and if poor Mr Cavendish was not grateful , it certainly was not his friend 's fault . He led the way into his house with a glum countenance and a sinking heart , though fortunately the latter was not visible . It was a very nice house , fitted up with all that luxury of comfort which a man who has , as Mrs Centum said , "
130049	130199	130044	130044	himself	206	" can afford to collect around him . Mr Cavendish had only himself , and he had made his habitation perfect , though , on the whole , he did not pass a very great deal of his time at home . He had some nice pictures and a good library , though he was not particularly given to the arts ; and he had an admirable cellar , as all the gentlemen owned in Carlingford , though , for his own part , he was very moderate in that point , and did not give himself any airs on the subject . Mr Centum , on the contrary , was one of the men who talk about vintages , and raise expectations never to be carried out . And General Travers could not but feel the force of the contrast as he sat deep into the night , and "
130204	130526	130044	130044	himself	206	" with the man who by that time he felt convinced was one of his best friends . As for Mr Cavendish , it would be very difficult to describe his feelings . He had been knocking about in all sorts of poor places , making clandestine visits to his sister , and hovering round the more than suburban simplicity of Grove Street , and the sense of being once more enveloped and surrounded by all that was pleasant to the eye and comfortable to the outer man was wonderfully consolatory and agreeable . But his mind was in a dreadfully harassed condition all the same . He was preoccupied to the last degree , wondering what Miss Marjoribanks really knew , and how far he had betrayed himself , and to what extent it would be safe , as she herself said , to confide in Lucilla ; and at the same time he was obliged to listen to and show a certain interest in the General 's stories , and to make now and then a painful effort of mind to recall some of the mutual friends referred to , whose names and persons had in the meantime slipped out of his memory . All the babble of the club , which General Travers felt must be so refreshing to the ears of a rusticated member , fell as flat upon Mr Cavendish , whose mind was full of other matters , as if it had been the merest old woman 's gossip , which , to be sure , it slightly resembled in some points . The gallant General made himself so agreeable that he nearly drove the unfortunate man out of his senses , and , when he had exhausted all other means of aggravation , returned with fresh zest to the sentimental circumstances in which , as he supposed , he had found his companion out . "
130533	130538	130044	130044	himself	206	" said General Travers . "
130632	130656	130630	130630	Cavendish	115	" said the friendly critic , with effusion ; and somehow this applause irritated its recipient more than all that had gone before . "
130667	130672	130660	130660	I	0	" said Mr Cavendish , "
130745	130812	130734	130734	She	88	" said the sufferer , with some heat . He was not in the least in love with Lucilla , and indeed had a certain dread of her at this present moment ; but he could not forget that she had once stood by him in his need — and , besides , he was glad of any subject on which he could contradict his visitor . "
130831	130861	130828	130828	you	3142	" said Mr Cavendish , trying to laugh . As for the General , he leaned back on his chair with an indulgent air , and stroked his mustache . "
130870	130874	130828	130828	you	3142	" he said . "
130924	130925	130828	130828	you	3142	" "
130928	130982	130828	130828	you	3142	" said Mr Cavendish . It was a frightful want of self - control ; but he had been a long time at full strain , and he could not help it . It did not occur to him , for the moment , that nobody in his senses would have applied the term "
130985	131044	130828	130828	you	3142	" to Barbara ; and , after all the slow aggravation that he had been submitting to , the idea of this insolent soldier interfering in Grove Street was beyond his power of endurance . As for the General , the tone of this exclamation was such that he too turned round on his chair , and said , "
131047	131161	130828	130828	you	3142	" with equally unmistakable meaning , startled , but ready for the emergency , whatever it might be . Thus the two looked at each other for a second , friends in the ordinary acceptation of the word , and yet , perhaps , on the eve of becoming enemies . Mr Cavendish had , up to that moment , pretty nearly forgotten Barbara Lake . It was a piquant sort of occupation when he had nothing else to do , and when the world , according to his morbid fancy , was on the eve of turning its back upon him — but from the moment when he had said between his teeth "
131166	131289	130828	130828	you	3142	" and had felt the excitement of the approaching crisis , Barbara , and her crimson cheeks , and her level eyebrows , and her contralto , had gone altogether out of his mind . At the same time , it is quite true that a man may feel himself at liberty to forget a woman when other matters of more immediate interest are absorbing his attention , and yet be driven furious by the idea suddenly presented to him that somebody else , who has nothing earthly to do with it , is about to interfere . Mr Cavendish , however , recovered himself while the General sat staring at him , and began to see how ridiculous his defiance was . "
131299	131355	131293	131293	I	0	" he said , and lighted another cigar . Yet he did not face his companion as a friendly listener should , but began to beat measure to an irritating imaginary air on the table , with a certain savage energy by moments , as if he were beating time on the General 's head . "
131367	131372	131359	131359	you	3152	" said General Travers ; "
131446	131454	131425	131444	my friend;—a little thing , round - faced , hazel - eyed — a little soft rosebud sort of creature	3157	" said the General , growing eloquent . "
131480	131481	131476	131476	you	3152	" "
131489	131550	131484	131484	Rose	108	" said Mr Cavendish , relieved in a moment ; and , to tell the truth , he could not help laughing . The more eloquent and angry the General grew , the more amused and contemptuous grew his entertainer . He was so tickled by the position of affairs , that he actually forgot his anxieties for the moment . "
131557	131678	131555	131555	Rose	108	" he repeated , and laughed ; Rose ! what anybody could see in that little dragon ! And then the contrast between the soldier , who prided himself on his knowledge of the world , and liked to talk of his family and position , to the annoyance of those who had none , and the amusement of those who happen to possess these valuable qualifications — and the mistress of the Female School of Design , filled Mr Cavendish with amusement : perhaps all the more because he himself was in a similar scrape . As for General Travers , he was as much disposed to be angry as , a moment before , Mr Cavendish had been . "
131684	131688	131682	131682	Rose	108	" he said , "
131733	131749	131750	131750	they	3159	" said the soldier ; and then he resumed , after a disagreeable little pause , "
131781	132094	132095	132095	You	3163	" He looked as he spoke , with what seemed to his victim an insulting consciousness , in poor Cavendish 's face . But , in reality , the General did not mean to be insulting , and knew nothing whatever of the horrible internal pang which rent his companion when it was thus recalled to him that it was to - morrow — a fact which , up to this moment , had not occurred to the unfortunate . To - morrow ; and not even to - morrow — to - day — for by this time it was two o'clock in the morning , and the unwelcome intruder was wasting the little time he had for deciding what he should do . Once more his own personal anxieties , which he had put aside for a moment at the sudden dictate of jealousy , surged over everything , and swallowed up all lesser sensations . To - morrow!—and by this time everybody knew that he was in Carlingford , and he could not stay away from the weekly assembly without attracting general attention to himself , and throwing open the flood - gates of suspicion . What was he to do ? should he turn his back on the enemy once for all , and run away and break off his connection with Carlingford ? or should he dare everything and face the Archdeacon , and put his trust in Lucilla , as that high - minded young woman had invited him to do ? With these thoughts in his mind , it may be supposed that Mr Cavendish gave but a very mingled attention to the babble of his visitor , who found the wine and the cigars so good , and perhaps had begun to be a little moved out of his ordinary lucidity by their effect . "
132105	132110	132103	132103	Cavendish	115	" said the General , "
132179	132261	132159	132159	you	3163	" said the philosophical warrior ; and poor Cavendish smiled a ghastly smile , with the strongest inclination all the time to take him by the collar and turn him out of doors . But then he was a warrior and a general officer , and a member of the same club , and six feet high — all which particulars , not to speak of the sacred rights of hospitality , made it somewhat difficult to carry this idea out . "
132274	132279	132159	132159	you	3163	" he said mildly ; "
132292	132482	132483	132483	I	0	" the victim added , with a sigh . The last words were an involuntary utterance of his own despair , but fortunately they struck General Travers 's vein of humour , which happened to be lively at the moment , and worked the desired but unexpected result . The General laughed loud and long , and declared that he respected a man who was above - board , and meant to look respectable for Miss Marjoribanks 's sake ; and then he poured a mighty libation to Lucilla , and took an affectionate leave of her supposed lover . The General made a great commotion in the decorous quiet of Grange Lane when he knocked at Mr Centum 's door . Though it was nearly three o'clock in the morning , nothing but his inherent dread of a woman would have prevented him from knocking up the banker to share his hilarity ; but Mrs Centum , in her nightcap , peaceably asleep as she was at the moment , daunted the soul of the gallant soldier ; and naturally his recollection was not very perfect next day . "
132503	132559	132497	132497	I	0	" General Travers said next morning when he met his host at breakfast ; and thus one bad joke at least was spared . But Mr Cavendish shut his door upon his departing guest , without any sense , poor fellow , of having done or said anything in the least funny . He said , "
132563	133415	132497	132497	I	0	" with a kind of groan of relief when his troublesome visitor was gone . And then he went back again into his library , where they had been sitting . Perhaps he had never fully appreciated before the comfort of everything , the handsome house which he had enjoyed so long without thinking anything of it , and all the pleasant luxurious accessories of life . He had been doing without them for a week or two , and he had not liked it ; and yet at that moment it seemed to Mr Cavendish that he could rather be content to lose them all at a stroke , to make it known in Carlingford that he was ruined and had lost his fortune , than that Carlingford should find out that he was not , after all , one of the Cavendishes , nor the person it took him for . But , alas ! all his fortune could not bring reality to these pretensions , nor hinder the exposure to which he looked forward with such horror . It is true that he was an adventurer , but he was not a base one ; nor had he done anything dishonourable either to gain his fortune or to captivate the good opinion of society , which had become so important to him . But there are actual crimes that would be sooner forgiven to a man than the folly of having permitted himself to be considered one of the Cavendishes , and having set his heart on making a figure in that mild provincial world . Mr Cavendish knew enough of human nature to know that a duchess or a lord - chamberlain would forgive more readily than Mr and Mrs Centum any such imposition upon them , and intrusion into their exclusive circle . And then his sister , who could not run away ! For her sake it seemed to him that he had better rush off at once , and sell his house and furniture and horses , and give up Carlingford . As he thought of that , all the advantages of Carlingford came upon him stronger than ever . Perhaps a man who has always been used to be recognised as one of the members of a local aristocracy , would not have seen anything half so precious as Mr Cavendish saw in the fact of being everywhere known and acknowledged as a constituent part of Grange Lane;—recognised by the county people , and by the poor people , and pointed out as he passed by one and another to any stranger who might happen to be so ignorant as not to know Mr Cavendish . To people who are not used to it , there is a charm in this universal acknowledgment . And then he had more need of it than most men have ; and , when Carlingford signed his patent of gentility , and acknowledged and prized him , it did an infinite deal more than it had any intention of doing . To keep its regard and recognition he would have done anything , given up the half or three parts , or even , on emergency , all he had . Perhaps he had an undue confidence in the magnanimity of society , and was too sure that in such a case it would behave with a grandeur worthy of the occasion ; but still he was quite right in thinking that it could forgive the loss of his fortune sooner than his real offence . And now it was Thursday morning , the day upon which he must either fight or flee . He too had laughed at Miss Marjoribanks 's evenings in his time , and thought of Thursday lightly as Lucilla 's day ; but there was nothing in the least amusing in the prospect of that assembly now . When a man has thoughts like these to entertain him , nothing can be more useless than to go to bed , although in ordinary circumstances , at three o'clock in the morning , that is about the only thing one can do . Poor Mr Cavendish , however , was not quite free to act as he thought proper . He had been a long time away from home , and he did not feel himself in a position to shock his servants ' feelings with impunity . He went to his room , accordingly , like a martyr , carrying all his difficulties with him , and these unpleasant companions naturally made a night of it when they had him all to themselves . When sheer fatigue and exhaustion procured him a moment 's sleep , it was only getting deeper and deeper into trouble : for then it was the Archdeacon who had planted a heavy foot on his neck , or General Travers , who , with still more fatal force , had found out the way to Grove Street . When Mr Cavendish awoke , he said to himself , "
133420	133817	132497	132497	I	0	" with more fervour than ever ; but , at the same time , he swore a mighty oath to himself that he would horsewhip the fellow who ventured to come in his way . Barbara Lake might be no great things , but at least it was to him , and no one else , that she belonged . Such was the complication that afforded him a little outlet for his temper in the midst of the dreadful difficulties of his position , and the question which was constantly renewing itself in his thoughts , as to whether he should go or stay . The idea of presenting himself in the centre of society in Miss Marjoribanks 's drawing - room , and being met by the Archdeacon , and held up to public contempt there and then , with all the world looking on , and even Travers , who would carry the narrative out of Carlingford , was something too horrible to be contemplated ; and yet how was he to escape ? He was still in this state of mind , driven backwards and forwards by every new wind , when the morning came , and when Miss Marjoribanks 's note was put into his hand . For the truth was , that , after long consideration , Lucilla had determined that the matter was one which could not be permitted to stand over . She was of too energetic a temperament to let things linger on in an uncertain way when they could be made an end of , and brought to a conclusion ; and then , as nobody can predict what sudden and unexpected turn human affairs may take , it was always possible that , if Miss Marjoribanks did not make an end of the business dramatically , and to the satisfaction of everybody concerned , it might be found some fine day to have resolved itself by means of some one of those illegitimate and incomplete expedients which abound in ordinary life . It was with this view that Miss Marjoribanks took the step of writing to Mr Cavendish . She had written in the sacred retirement of her own maiden chamber , when all the world was still ; perhaps at the moment when General Travers was , as he would himself have vulgarly called it , "
133819	133933	133934	133934	My	0	" Cavendish about the beautiful and disinterested friendship which united him to the young sovereign of Grange Lane . But naturally such poor raillery was far from the virginal thoughts of Lucilla at that retired and sacred hour ; and we may venture to add that the elevating influence of the maiden 's bower in which she composed it , and of that tranquil moment of meditation and solitude , breathed in every line , and gave force to every sentiment of the letter which Mr Cavendish tore open with an excited hand . Perhaps he was too anxious and curious to give it the solemn perusal which it ought to have received . "
134063	134435	134436	134437	Lucilla Marjoribanks	119	" Dear Mr Cavendish , it is not the Archdeacon who has said anything . He does not know it is you ; therefore , of course , he could not say anything directly bearing upon you . But then , you know , if he were to meet you by hazard , as he is sure to do some day — and for my part I rather think he is fond of Grove Street — you would be exposed at once , and everything would be lost , for we all know the prejudices that exist in Carlingford . I have another plan of operations to propose to you , which I feel quite sure is for your good , and also naturally for the good of anybody to whom you may intend to unite your fortunes . I feel quite sure that it is far safer to adopt a bold resolution , and to have it over at once . Come to dinner to - morrow . If you may happen to find an enemy , you will find also an unlooked - for friend ; and , so far as I am concerned , you know that you may calculate on my support . I do not wonder at your being anxious about it ; but if you will only have full confidence in me and a little in yourself , believe me it will be all over in a night . If there had ever been anything between you and me , as these stupid people suppose , I might have felt hesitation in writing to you like this ; but when I know a thing to be right , I hope I will never be afraid to do it . I have been called upon to do many things that are not common for girls of my age , and perhaps that is why I made up my mind at once to set this all straight for you . Once more I repeat , dear Mr Cavendish , have confidence in me . Come to - morrow evening as if nothing had happened ; and take my word for it that all will go well.—Your friend , "
134439	134492	134436	134437	Lucilla Marjoribanks	119	" P.S.—If you would like to come and talk it over with me to - morrow , I shall be at home till twelve o'clock ; but unless it will be a satisfaction to your own mind , it is not necessary for me , for I have all my plans laid . "
134617	134630	134631	134632	Mr Cavendish	115	" It stands to reason as there 's a cause for it , "
135098	135115	135123	135123	she	3197	" Perhaps I ought not to say so , but I know she has missed you , "
135186	135196	135177	135177	He	115	" I am going to call on Miss Marjoribanks ; "
135223	135257	135258	135259	Mrs Chiley	96	" She is sure to be in just now , and I am so glad ; and , my dear , you need not mind me , for I am both your friends , "
135588	135605	135607	135607	Barbara	120	" Oh , I am sure I never thought of seeing you here , Mr Cavendish , "
135646	135656	135658	135661	the foolish young woman	3208	" Perhaps you are going to see Miss Marjoribanks , "
135781	135792	135793	135793	he	115	" Yes , I am going to see Miss Marjoribanks , "
136631	136640	136641	136641	he	115	" It ca n't be worse than ruin , "
136811	136823	136825	136826	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Harry , if you are going to Lucilla — — ! "
136828	136854	136856	136858	the anxious sister	5894	" wait and rest yourself a little , and I will get you a glass of wine . Keep still ; there 's some Tokay , "
136860	136884	136825	136826	Mrs Woodburn	99	" Do n't you go and worry yourself . You shall see nobody . I 'll bring it you with my own hand . "
136885	136892	136894	136895	Mr Cavendish	115	" Oh , confound the Tokay ! "
136897	136978	136894	136895	Mr Cavendish	115	" I know what Woodburn 's Tokay is — if that mattered . Look here , I want to speak to you . I was going to Lucilla , but I 'm not up to it . Oh , not in the way you think ! Do n't be a fool like everybody . I tell you she would n't have me , and I wo n't ask her . Read this , which is much more to the purpose , "
137049	137058	137059	137059	he	115	" Do n't make a row about it , "
137071	137130	137132	137133	Mr Cavendish	115	" It 's all right . I ca n't ask Lucilla Marjoribanks to have me after that , but I mean to put my trust in her , as she says . I was going to ask her to explain ; but after all , on thinking of it , I do n't see the good of explanations , "
137139	137165	137132	137133	Mr Cavendish	115	" The fact is , she is right , Nelly , and , stand or fall , we 'll have it out to - night . "
137184	137195	137197	137199	the trembling woman	5741	" Oh , good heavens ! what does she know ? "
137201	137376	137197	137199	the trembling woman	5741	" What do you suppose she can know ? She gave me a dreadful fright , coming and asking about you and your name . And then she never was a great friend of mine — and if she should say anything to Woodburn ! Oh , Harry , go away , go away , and do n't face her . You know you slighted her , and she is laying a snare for us . Oh , Harry , go away ! She ca n't do you much harm , but she could ruin me , and any little peace I have ! Woodburn would never — never forgive — he would be frantic , you know . It has always been he that made a fuss about the Cavendishes — and , good heavens ! to be in a girl 's power , and she one that you have slighted , Harry ! Oh , for Heaven 's sake , for pity 's sake , if you care anything for me — — "
137377	137384	137386	137387	Mr Cavendish	115	" Hold your tongue , Nelly , "
137389	137496	137386	137387	Mr Cavendish	115	" Do n't make a row . What on earth is the use of Heaven's - saking ? I tell you I am going to make an end of it . If I were to run away now , it would turn up again at some other corner , and some other moment . Give me a pen and a bit of paper . I will write a note , and say I am coming . I do n't want any explanations . If it 's all a mistake , so much the better ; but I 'm going to face it out to - night . "
137593	137605	137606	137607	Mr Cavendish	115	" You must have been giving yourself airs on the subject , "
137617	137630	137611	137611	he	115	" I never was so foolish as that , for my part ; "
137668	137674	137676	137677	Mrs Woodburn	99	" If you do go , "
137681	137786	137676	137677	Mrs Woodburn	99	" oh , Harry , for goodness ' sake , mind that you deny everything . If you confess to anything , it will all be proved against you ; do n't allow a single thing that 's said to you . It is a mistaken identity , you know — that is what it is ; there was a case in the papers just the other day . Oh , Harry , for Heaven 's sake do n't be weak!—deny everything ; you do n't know anything about it — you do n't know what they mean — you ca n't understand — — "
137787	137799	137801	137802	Mr Cavendish	115	" It is I that have to do it , Nelly , "
137811	137821	137823	137823	he	115	" You must let me do it my way ; "
139079	139090	139091	139091	she	119	" At all events I have to do my duty , "
139449	139467	139468	139468	Lucilla	119	" There are a great many people in Carlingford who have not nearly such a pleasant lookout , "
139471	139500	139468	139468	Lucilla	119	" for my part , I think it is a very pretty garden . The wistaria has grown quite nice , and there is a little of everything , "
139527	139554	139556	139557	the widow	1180	" Oh , yes , it is very pretty ; and I am sure I am very grateful to Providence for giving me such a home , "
139658	139668	139670	139671	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" You ought to take a walk every day , "
139673	139757	139759	139759	Lucilla	119	" that is what is the matter with you ; but , in the meantime , there is something else I want you to do . This is Thursday , you know , and I have always some people on Thursday . It is not a party — it is only an Evening — and no dress to speak of . Your black silk will look quite nice , and be all that is necessary . Black is very becoming to some people , "
139794	139802	139803	139804	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" And some lace for your head , "
139807	139835	139803	139804	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" I do n't think you have gone off at all , and I am sure you will look very nice . It is at nine o'clock . "
139836	139842	139844	139845	Mrs Mortimer	133	" This evening , Lucilla ! "
139849	139881	139844	139845	Mrs Mortimer	133	" but you know I never go out — I am not fit for society . Oh , do n't ask me , please ! Since poor Edward died — — ' "
139884	139888	139844	139845	Mrs Mortimer	133	" said Lucilla , "
139970	139980	139981	139981	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a little anxiety . "
140048	140049	140052	140052	Lucilla	119	" "
140059	140064	140052	140052	Lucilla	119	" said the widow . "
140089	140090	140091	140091	My	0	" "
140099	140107	140094	140094	you	4403	" said Lucilla , with tender reproach . "
140188	140200	140177	140177	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added , giving her friend an affectionate kiss ; "
140208	140209	140177	140177	I	0	" "
140215	140265	140212	140212	Lucilla	119	" cried Mrs Mortimer . It was vain to make any further protest , however , for Lucilla was gone , having , in the first place , communicated her requirements to Mary Jane , who was not likely to forget , nor to let her mistress be late . "
140272	140604	140268	140268	she	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks emphatically , as she went out at the door . It was necessary she should be nice ; without that the intended situation which Lucilla was preparing — the grand finale of her exertions — would fall flat , and probably fail of its effect . For this it was necessary that the widow should look not only pretty , but interesting , and a little pathetic , and all that a widow should look when first dragged back into society . Miss Marjoribanks gave a momentary sigh as she emerged from the garden door , and could not but feel conscious that in all this she might be preparing the most dread discomfiture and downfall for herself . Even if it passed over as it ought to do , and nobody was charmed but the Archdeacon , who was the right person to be charmed , Lucilla felt that after this she never could have that entire confidence in her father which she had had up to this moment . The incipient sentiment Dr Marjoribanks had exhibited was one that struck at the roots of all faith in him as a father ; and every person of sensibility will at once perceive how painful such a suggestion must have been to the mind of a young woman so entirely devoted as was Miss Marjoribanks to the consolation and comfort of her dear papa . Lucilla was not allowed to spend the rest of this momentous afternoon in maturing her plans , as might have been necessary to a lesser intelligence ; and when the refreshing moment came at which she could have her cup of tea before preparing for the fatigues of the evening , it was Mrs Chiley who came to assist at that ceremony . The old lady came in with an important air , and gave Lucilla a long , lingering kiss , as old ladies sometimes do when they particularly mean it . "
140628	140708	140620	140620	you	4403	" the kind old woman said , arranging herself in her chair with the satisfaction of a listener who expects to be confided in . As for Lucilla , who had no clue to Mrs Chiley 's special curiosity , and who had a good many things on her mind just at that moment which she rather preferred not to talk about , she was for once struck with veritable astonishment , and did not know what to say . "
140721	140726	140727	140727	You	96	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
140743	140764	140727	140727	You	96	" and by way of staving off more particular questions , she took her old friend a cup of tea . "
140774	140789	140727	140727	You	96	" said Mrs Chiley , but at the same time her disappointment was evident . "
140894	140938	140978	140978	He	3299	" Miss Marjoribanks grew more and more surprised as she listened . She put away the kettle without filling the teapot , and left her own cup standing untasted , and went and sat down on the stool by Mrs Chiley 's feet . "
140957	140968	140949	140949	I	0	" said Lucilla ; and then her visitor burst forth . "
141061	141066	141067	141067	I	0	" cried Mrs Chiley . "
141185	141192	141176	141176	you	119	" Mrs Chiley said , piteously ; "
141219	141220	141210	141210	I	0	" "
141227	141243	141221	141221	I	0	" said Lucilla , with a modest innocence that it was a pleasure to see ; "
141250	141259	141246	141248	dear Mrs Chiley	96	" she continued , raising her drooping eyelids , "
141344	141365	141366	141366	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a certain mild wonder at the inexplicable creatures whom she thus condescended to discuss . "
141402	141403	141398	141398	he	3317	" "
141406	141493	141404	141404	Lucilla	119	" cried Mrs Chiley , almost with a shriek of horror . She thought , as was perhaps natural , that there was some pique in what her young companion said ; not doing Miss Marjoribanks justice — as indeed few people did — for that perfect truthfulness which it was Lucilla 's luck always to be able to maintain . Mrs Chiley thought it was her young friend 's maidenly pride and determination not to take up the part of a woman slighted or jilted . "
141510	141516	141503	141503	your	96	" said the old lady ; "
141561	141573	141551	141551	I	0	" said Mrs Chiley , putting her handkerchief to her eyes ; "
141636	141675	141634	141634	Lucilla	119	" she cried , putting her arm round her favourite . As for Miss Marjoribanks , she gave her old friend a close embrace , which was the only thing that even her genius could suggest to do . "
141681	141702	141679	141679	you	119	" said Lucilla , with touching eloquence ; and then she freed herself a little from Mrs Chiley 's arms . "
141773	141778	141769	141769	himself	170	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
141832	141844	141826	141826	you	119	" Lucilla added tenderly , by way of breaking the shock , "
141853	141879	141848	141848	you	119	" But instead of being pleased , Mrs Chiley was speechless for the moment . Her fresh old cheeks grew ashy with dismay and horror . "
141884	141892	141880	141881	The Archdeacon	5143	" she cried , gasping for breath . "
141901	141956	141899	141899	you	119	" Then the kind old lady held Miss Marjoribanks fast , and sobbed over her in the despair of the moment . To think , after all the pains that had been taken , and all the hopes and all the speculations , that neither the one nor the other was coming to anything ! "
141974	142008	141968	141968	I	0	" sobbed Lucilla 's anxious friend . But Miss Marjoribanks 's genius carried her through this trial , as well as through all the others which she had yet encountered on her way . "
142013	142017	141968	141968	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
142070	142085	142086	142086	My	0	" Upon which Mrs Chiley kissed her young friend once more with lingering meaning . "
142097	142104	142105	142105	everybody	300	" she said , with indignation ; "
142138	142452	142453	142453	You	3341	" said Mrs Chiley , with indignant tenderness . Perhaps Miss Marjoribanks was in some respects of the same way of thinking . She conducted her sympathetic friend to the garden door , when it came to be time for everybody to go and dress , with a certain pathetic elevation in her own person , which was not out of accord with Mrs Chiley 's virtuous wrath . To have Mrs Mortimer and Barbara Lake preferred to her did not wound Lucilla 's pride — one can be wounded in that way only by one 's equals . She thought of it with a certain mild pity and charitable contempt . Both these two men had had the chance of having her , and this was how they had chosen ! And there can be little wonder if Miss Marjoribanks 's compassion for them was mingled with a little friendly and condescending disdain . It was , however , an ease to Lucilla 's mind that she had let Mrs Chiley know , and was so far free to work out her plans without any fear of misconception . And on the whole , her old friend 's tender indignation was not disagreeable to her . Thus it was , without any interval of repose to speak of , that her lofty energies went on unwearied to overrule and guide the crisis which was to decide so many people 's fate . Dr Marjoribanks was not a man to take very much notice of trivial external changes ; and he knew Lucilla and her constitution , and , being a medical man , was not perhaps so liable to parental anxieties as an unprofessional father might have been ; but even he was a little struck by Miss Marjoribanks 's appearance when he came into the drawing - room . He said , "
142465	142497	142453	142453	You	3341	" with the calmness of a man who knew there was not much the matter — but yet he did observe that her colour was not exactly what it always was . "
142508	142889	142503	142503	papa	295	" said Lucilla , which , to be sure , was a fact the Doctor had never doubted ; and then the people began to come in , and there was no more to be said . But there could be no doubt that Lucilla had more colour than usual . Her pulse was quite steady , and her heart going on at its ordinary rate ; but her admirable circulation was nevertheless so far affected , that the ordinary rose - tints of her complexion were all deepened . It was not so distinctly an improvement as it would have been had she been habitually pale ; but still the flush was moderate , and did Miss Marjoribanks no harm . And then it was a larger party than usual . The Centums were there , who were General Travers 's chaperons , and so were the Woodburns , and of course Mrs Chiley , which made up the number of ladies beyond what was general at Dr Marjoribanks 's table . Lucilla received all her guests with the sweetest smiles and all her ordinary ease and self - possession , but at the same time her mind was not free from some excitement . She was on the eve of a crisis which would be the greatest failure or the greatest success of her public life , and naturally she anticipated it with a certain emotion . Mr Cavendish , for his part , had sufficient sense to come very early , and to get into a dark corner and keep himself out of the way ; for though he was screwed up to the emergency , his self - possession was nothing to that of Lucilla . But on the whole , it was perhaps Mrs Woodburn who suffered the most . Her heightened colour was more conspicuous than that of Miss Marjoribanks , because as a general rule she was pale . She was pale , almost white , and had dark eyes and dark hair , and possessed precisely all the accessories which make a sudden change of complexion remarkable ; and the effect this evening was so evident that even her husband admired her for a moment , and then stopped short to inquire , "
142899	143385	142894	142894	she	3343	" to which question Mrs Woodburn naturally replied only by an indignant shrug of her white shoulders and aversion of her head . She would not have been sorry , perhaps , for this night only , if he had believed that it was rouge , and not emotion . Of all the people at Dr Marjoribanks 's table , she perhaps was the only one really to be pitied . Even Mr Cavendish , if vanquished , would at the most receive only the recompense of his deeds , and could go away and begin over again somewhere else , or bury himself in the great depths of general society , where nobody would be the wiser ; but as for his sister , she could not go away . The first result for her would be to give the master to whom she belonged , and for whom she had , with some affection , a great deal of not unnatural contempt , a cruel and overwhelming power over her ; and she knew , poor soul , that he was not at all too generous or delicate to make use of such a power . In such a case she would be bound to the rock , like a kind of hapless Andromeda , to be pecked at by all the birds and blown at by all the winds , not to speak of the devouring monster from whom no hero could ever deliver her ; and with all these horrible consequences before her eyes , she had to sit still and look on and do nothing , to see all the hidden meaning of every look and movement without appearing to see it , to maintain ordinary conversation when her ear was strained to the uttermost to hear words of fate on which her whole future depended . No wonder her colour was high ; and she could not go into a corner , as Mr Cavendish did , nor keep silent , nor withdraw herself from observation . Neither her pulse nor her heart would have borne the scrutiny to which Miss Marjoribanks 's calm organs might have been subjected with perfect security ; and the chances are , if the Doctor had by any hazard put his finger on her wrist when he shook hands with her , that instead of handing her over to General Travers to be taken down to dinner , he would have , on the contrary , sent her off to bed . Fortunately by this time the year was declining , and that happy season had returned in which people once more begin to dine by artificial light ; and at the same time it was not absolutely dark in the drawing - room , so that Lucilla had not , as she said , thought it necessary to have the candles lighted . "
143412	143417	143421	143421	you	3344	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
143430	143469	143470	143470	she	3345	" This was addressed to the Archdeacon , to whom Lucilla was very particular in her attentions at that moment . Mrs Chiley , who was looking on with a great sense of depression , could not help wondering why—"When
143479	143595	143470	143470	she	3345	" the old lady said to herself , with natural indignation . For her part , she did not see what right a man had to introduce himself thus under false pretences into the confiding bosom of society — when he was as bad as married , or even indeed worse . She was ruffled , and she did not think it worth while to conceal that she was so ; for there are limits to human patience , and a visitor who stays six weeks ought at least to have confidence in his entertainers . Mrs Chiley for once in her life could have boxed Lucilla 's ears for her uncalled - for civility . "
143612	143619	143605	143610	the General who takes her downstairs	3347	" she said to Mrs Centum . "
143652	143687	143646	143646	I	0	" said the indiscreet old lady . As for Mrs Centum , she felt the neglect , but she had too much proper pride to own that her man was not receiving due attention . "
143700	143774	143694	143695	General Travers	199	" she said , reserving the question ; and so in the uncertain light , when nobody was sure who was his neighbour , the procession filed downstairs . To enter the dining - room , all brilliant and shining as it was , radiant with light and flowers and crystal and silver , and everything that makes a dinner - table pretty to look upon , was , as Mrs Centum said , "
143779	144070	143694	143695	General Travers	199	" A close observer might have remarked , as Mrs Woodburn and Lucilla took their places , that both of them , instead of that flush which had been so noticeable a short time before , had become quite pale . It was the moment of trial . Poor Mr Cavendish , in his excitement , had taken just the place he ought not to have taken , immediately under the lamp at the centre of the table . During the moment when the unsuspecting Archdeacon said grace with his eyes decorously cast down , Miss Marjoribanks owned the ordinary weakness of humanity so much as to drop her fan and her handkerchief , and even the napkin which was arranged in a symmetrical pyramid on her plate . Such a sign of human feebleness could but endear her to everybody who was aware of the momentous character of the crisis . When these were all happily recovered and everybody seated , Lucilla kept her eyes fixed upon the Archdeacon 's face . It was , as we have said , a terrible moment . When he raised his head and looked round him , naturally Mr Beverley 's eyes went direct to the mark like an arrow ; he looked , and he saw at the centre of the table , surrounded by every kind of regard and consideration , full in the light of the lamp , his favourite adventurer , the impostor whom he had denounced the first time he took his place by Miss Marjoribanks 's side . The Archdeacon rose to his feet in the excitement of the discovery ; he put his hand over his eyes as if to clear them . He said , "
144074	144145	144146	144147	Mr Beverley	170	" loud out , with an accent of horror which paralysed the two people lower down than himself . As for Miss Marjoribanks , she was not paralysed — she who had not lost a single glance of his eyes or movement of his large person . Lucilla rose to the height of the position . She put her hand upon his arm sharply , and with a certain energy . "
144157	144198	144149	144149	Thomas	105	" said Miss Marjoribanks . The Archdeacon turned round to see what it was , conscious that somebody had spoken to him , but as indifferent to his companion and to civility as he was to Thomas and the soup . "
144201	144260	144149	144149	Thomas	105	" he said hoarsely , interrupting his scrutiny for the moment . But when he had met Miss Marjoribanks 's eye the Archdeacon sat down . Lucilla did not liberate him for a moment from that gaze . She fixed her eyes upon his eyes , and looked at him as people only look when they mean something . "
144276	144333	144272	144272	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . She spoke so that nobody could hear but himself ; and in the meantime General Travers at her left hand was making himself excessively agreeable to Mrs Woodburn , and no doubt occupying all her attention ; and Lucilla never turned her eyes for a moment from the Archdeacon 's face . "
144339	144344	144336	144336	your	3354	" said Mr Beverley . "
144388	144399	144384	144384	I	0	" the Archdeacon said , drawing a rapid forcible breath . "
144411	144412	144404	144404	you	88	" "
144417	144426	144427	144427	Perfectly	216	" said Lucilla , softening into a smile . "
144459	144512	144449	144449	he	3356	" Miss Marjoribanks added . She laughed as she spoke , a kind of laugh which is only appropriate to one subject , and which is as good , any day , as a confession ; and the flush was so obliging as to return at that moment to her ingenuous countenance . "
144522	144553	144449	144449	he	3356	" Lucilla went on after that pretty pause ; and then she raised her confiding eyes , which had been cast down , once more to the Archdeacon 's face . "
144566	144784	144563	144564	Mr Beverley	170	" said Miss Marjoribanks . She clasped her hands together , just for a moment , as she did so , with an eloquent meaning which it was impossible to mistake . The Archdeacon , for his part , gazed at her like a man in a dream . Whether it was true — or whether he was being made a fool of more completely than ever man before was — or whether he was the victim of an optical or some other kind of delusion,—the poor man could not tell . He was utterly stricken dumb , and did not know what to say . He accepted the soup humbly , which Thomas set before him , though it was a white soup , an effeminate dish , which went utterly in the face of his principles . And then he looked at the innocent young creature at his side in that flutter of happy confusion . It was a terrible position for the Broad - Churchman . After such a tacit confession he could not spring from his seat and hurl the impostor out of the room , as in the first place he had a mind to do . On the contrary , it was with a voice trembling with emotion that he spoke . "
144790	144795	144785	144785	My	0	" said the Archdeacon , "
144842	144843	144830	144830	You	88	" "
144848	144855	144830	144830	You	88	" said Lucilla , with another little laugh—"everything
144878	145058	144871	144871	He	3364	" said Miss Marjoribanks . She caught Mr Cavendish 's eye at the moment , who was casting a stealthy glance in her direction , and who looked cowed and silenced and unquiet to the most miserable degree ; and she gave him a little reassuring nod , which the Archdeacon watched with an inward groan . What was he to do ? He could not publicly expose the man who had just received this mark of confidence from his young hostess , who knew everything . Perhaps it was one of the greatest trials of Christian patience and fortitude which the Archdeacon , who was not great , as he himself would have said , in the passive virtues , had undergone in all the course of his life . He was so utterly subdued and confounded that he ate his soup , and never found out what kind of soup it was . That is , he consumed it in large spoonfuls without being aware , by way of occupying his energies and filling up the time . "
145065	145073	145074	145074	You	3365	" he said , after a pause . "
145135	145136	145127	145127	he	3367	" "
145146	145151	145144	145144	him	3367	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
145211	145223	145203	145203	he	295	" said Lucilla , with an imperceptible elevation of her voice . "
145233	145312	145226	145226	he	3367	" said the Archdeacon . He too had raised his voice without knowing it , and several people looked up , who were not at the moment engaged in active conversation of their own . The owner of that name , for his part , also turned his face towards the upper end of the table . He was sick of the suspense and continued endurance , and by this time was ready to rush upon his fate . "
145319	145363	145314	145315	any one	4391	" he said ; and there was a little pause , and the company in general fixed its regard upon those three people with a sense that something remarkable was going on among them , though it could not tell what or why . "
145372	145377	145364	145365	The Archdeacon	5143	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
145406	145410	145396	145396	you	3365	" Lucilla added ; "
145435	145443	145444	145444	You	3365	" she continued , lowering her voice . "
145469	145721	145462	145462	you	3365	" said Miss Marjoribanks . As for the Archdeacon , words could not give any idea of the state of his mind . He ate his dinner sternly after that , and did not look at anything but his plate . He consumed the most exquisite plats , the tenderest wings of chicken and morsels of paté , as if they had been his personal enemies . For , to tell the truth , he felt the tables altogether turned upon him , and was confounded , and did not know what it could mean . It was the General who took up Mr Beverley 's abandoned place in the conversation . The gallant soldier talked for two with the best will in the world . He talked of Cavendish , and all the pleasant hours they had spent together , and what a good fellow he was , and how much the men in the club would be amused to hear of his domesticity . It was a kind of talk very natural to a man who found himself placed at table between his friend 's sister , and , as he supposed , his friend 's future bride . And naturally the Archdeacon got all the benefit . As for Lucilla , she received it with the most perfect grace in the world and saw all the delicate points of the General 's wit , and appreciated him so thoroughly , that he felt half inclined to envy Cavendish . "
145733	146043	145725	145725	he	130	" General Travers said ; and probably it was the charms of his intelligent and animated conversation that kept the ladies so long at table . Mrs Chiley , for her part , did not know what to make of it . She said afterwards that she kept looking at Lucilla until she was really quite ashamed ; and though she was at the other end of the table , she could see that the poor dear did not enjoy her dinner . It happened , too , that when they did move at last , the drawing - room was fuller than usual . Everybody had come that evening — Sir John , and some others of the county people , who only came now and then , and without any exception everybody in Carlingford . And Lucilla certainly was not herself for the first half - hour . She kept close to the door , and regarded the staircase with an anxious countenance . When she was herself at the helm of affairs , there was a certain security that everything would go on tolerably — but nobody could tell what a set of men left to themselves might or might not do . This was the most dreadful moment of the evening . Mrs Mortimer was in the drawing - room , hidden away under the curtains of a window , knowing nobody , speaking to nobody , and in a state of mind to commit suicide with pleasure ; but Miss Marjoribanks , though she had cajoled her into that martyrdom , took no notice of Mrs Mortimer . She was civil , it is true , to her other guests , but there could not be a doubt that Lucilla was horribly preoccupied , and in a state of mind quite unusual to her . "
146052	146064	146044	146044	I	0	" Mrs Chiley said , who was watching her from afar . "
146073	146162	146044	146044	I	0	dinner"—and the kind old lady got up slowly and extricated herself from the crowd , and put herself in motion as best she could , to go to her young friend 's aid . It was at this moment that Lucilla turned round radiant upon the observant assembly . The change occurred in less than a moment , so suddenly that nobody saw the actual point of revolution . Miss Marjoribanks turned round upon the company and took Mr Cavendish 's arm , who had just come upstairs . "
146182	146221	146165	146172	a very , very old friend of yours	3379	" said Lucilla ; and she led him across the room as a conqueror might have led a captive . She took him through the crowd , to whom she dispensed on every side her most gracious glances . "
146227	146314	146222	146222	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks said — for naturally she was called on all sides . What most people remarked at this moment was , that the Archdeacon , who had also come in with the other gentlemen , was standing very sullen and lowering at the door , watching that triumphal progress . And it certainly was not Lucilla 's fault if Mrs Chiley and Lady Richmond , and a few other ladies , were thus led to form a false idea of the state of affairs . "
146326	146759	146315	146315	I	0	" Lady Richmond said , not thinking that Barbara Lake was standing by and heard her . According to appearances , it was all perfectly right between them . Miss Marjoribanks , triumphant , led Mr Cavendish all the length of the room to the corner where the widow sat among the curtains , and the Archdeacon looked on with a visible passion , and jealous rage , which were highly improper in a clergyman , but yet which were exciting to see . And this was how the little drama was to conclude , according to Lady Richmond and Mrs Chiley , who , on the whole , were satisfied with the conclusion . But , naturally , there were other people to be consulted . There was Mr Beverley , whom Miss Marjoribanks held in leash , but who was not yet subdued ; and there was Dr Marjoribanks , who began to feel a little curiosity about his daughter 's movements , and did not make them out ; and there was Barbara Lake , who had begun to blaze like a tempest with her crimson cheeks and black bold eyes . But by this time Lucilla was herself again , and felt the reins in her hands . When she had deposited Mr Cavendish in safety , she faced round upon the malcontents and upon the observers , and on the world in general . Now that her mind was at rest , and everything under her own inspection , she felt herself ready and able for all . The Archdeacon stood before the fireplace with Dr Marjoribanks and a host of other gentlemen . Mr Beverley 's countenance was covered with clouds and darkness . He stood , not with the careless ease of a man amusing himself , but drawn up to his full height and breadth , a formidably muscular Christian , in a state of repression and restraint , which it was painful , and at the same time pleasing to see . The Berserker madness was upon him ; and yet such are the restraints of society , that a young woman 's eye was enough to keep him down — Lucilla 's eye , and the presence of a certain number of other frivolous creatures in white muslin , and of some old women , as he irreverently called them , who were less pleasant , but not more imposing . He was an Archdeacon , and a leading man of his party , whose name alone would have conferred importance upon any "
146762	146938	146942	146943	pretty girls	3383	" and whom his bishop himself — not to speak of the clergy whom he charged in his visitation addresses like a regiment of cavalry — stood a little in awe of . Yet such are the beneficial restraints of society , that he dared not follow his natural impulses , nor even do what he felt to be his duty , for fear of Miss Marjoribanks , which was about the highest testimony to the value of social influence that could be given . At the same time , it was but natural that under such circumstances the Archdeacon should feel a certain savage wrath at the bond that confined him , and be more indignant than usual at the false and tyrannical conventionalism called society . And it was at this moment , of all times in the world , that General Travers , like a half - educated brute as ( according to Mr Beverley 's ideas ) he was , took the liberty of calling his attention to what the soldier called "
146945	146946	146942	146943	pretty girls	3383	" "
146956	146974	146954	146954	Jove	130	" he added ; not having the remotest idea what effect so simple an observation might produce . "
146983	146995	146996	146996	You	3384	" said the Archdeacon , with a snarl of concealed ferocity . "
147038	147043	147036	147036	God	215	" said the Broad - Churchman—"the
147064	147162	147163	147163	I	0	" It may be supposed that everybody was stricken with utter amazement by this unlooked - for remark . Dr Marjoribanks , for his part , took a pinch of snuff , which , as a general rule , he only did at consultations , or in the face of a difficulty ; and as for the unlucky soldier who had called it forth , there can be no doubt that a certain terror filled his manly bosom ; for he naturally felt as if he must have said something extraordinary to call forth such a response . "
147174	147184	147163	147163	I	0	" the General said , and he grew pale . "
147210	147249	147203	147203	Cavendish	115	" the soldier added , looking round him , scared and nervous — for it was evident that his only policy was to escape from society in which he was thus liable to commit himself without knowing how . "
147257	147260	147203	147203	Cavendish	115	" said Mr Beverley—"always
147310	147569	147572	147572	his	3391	" The critic paused . It was not that his emotions were too much for him ; it was because the crowd opened a moment , and afforded him a glimpse of a figure in black silk , with the lace for which Miss Marjoribanks had stipulated falling softly over a head which had not quite lost its youthful grace . He gave a glance round him to see if the coast was clear . Lucilla was out of the way at the other end of the room , and he was free . He made but one stride through the unconscious assembly which he had been criticising so severely , and all but knocked down little Rose Lake , who was not looking at the Archdeacon , though she stood straight in his way . He might have stepped over her head without knowing it , so much was he moved . All the gay crowd gave way before him with a cry and flutter ; and Lucilla , for her part , was out of the way ! But there are moments when to be out of the way is the highest proof of genius . Miss Marjoribanks had just had a cup of tea brought her , of which she had great need , and her face was turned in the other direction , but yet she was aware that the Archdeacon had passed like a Berserker through those ranks which were not the ranks of his enemies . She felt without seeing it that the "
147574	147835	147836	147836	I	0	" agitated his own large coat tails and heavy locks , and made a perfect hurricane among the white muslin . Lucilla 's heart beat quicker , and she put down her tea , though she had so much need of it . She could not swallow the cordial at such a moment of excitement . But she never once turned her head , nor left off her conversation , nor betrayed the anxiety she felt . Up to this time she had managed everything herself , which was comparatively easy ; but she felt by instinct that now was the moment to make a high effort and leave things alone . And it may be added that nothing but an inherent sense of doing the right thing under the circumstances could have inspired Miss Marjoribanks to the crowning achievement of keeping out of the way . When Mr Beverley arrived in front of the two people who were seated together in the recess of the window , he made no assault upon them , as his manner might have suggested . On the contrary , he placed himself in front of them , with his back to the company , creating thus a most effectual moral and physical barrier between the little nook where his own private vengeance and fate were about to be enacted , and the conventional world which he had just been denouncing . The Archdeacon shut the two culprits off from all succour , and looked down upon them , casting them into profound shade . "
147849	147853	147836	147836	I	0	" he said , "
147870	148028	147863	147863	I	0	" and it was with dry lips and the calmness of passion that he spoke . Mrs Mortimer gave a little cry of terror , but her companion , for his part , sat quite dumb and immovable . The moment had arrived at last , and perhaps he too was glad it had come . He sat still , expecting to see the earth crumble under his feet , expecting to hear the humble name he had once borne proclaimed aloud , and to hear ridicule and shame poured upon the impostor who had called himself one of the Cavendishes . But it was no use struggling any longer . He did not even raise his eyes , but sat still , waiting for the thunderbolt to fall . But to tell the truth , the Archdeacon , though a torrent of words came rushing to his lips , felt at a difficulty how to begin . "
148050	148069	148042	148048	the man who has ruined your prospects	3393	" he said , with a slight incoherence ; and then he changed the direction of his attack . "
148081	148085	148073	148073	you	3392	" he said ; "
148189	148190	148191	148192	A criminal	3399	" "
148197	148277	148194	148195	a conspirator	3400	" said Mr Cavendish , and he looked in his accuser 's face with an amazement which , notwithstanding his rage , struck the Archdeacon . If he had called him an impostor , the culprit would have quailed and made no reply . But the exaggeration saved him . After that first look of surprise , he rose to his feet and confronted the avenger , who saw he had made a blunder without knowing what it was . "
148286	148290	148293	148293	you	3401	" he said . "
148321	148322	148313	148313	you	3401	" "
148332	148388	148389	148389	You	3401	" said the Archdeacon ; but there can be no doubt that his certainty was diminished by the surprise with which his accusation was received . It checked his first heat , and it was with a slightly artificial excitement that he went on , trying to work himself up again to the same point . "
148407	148463	148389	148389	You	3401	" said Mr Beverley ; and then in spite of himself he stopped short ; for it was easier to say such things to a woman , who contradicted without giving much reason , than to a man who , with an air of the utmost astonishment , stood regarding his accuser in the face . "
148470	148475	148389	148389	You	3401	" said Mr Cavendish . "
148489	148589	148477	148477	you	3401	" He was not angry to speak of , because he had been entirely taken by surprise , and because at the same time he was unspeakably relieved , and felt that the real danger , the danger which he had so much dreaded , was past and over . He recovered all his coolness from the moment he found out that it was not a venial imposition practised upon society , but a social crime of the ugliest character , of which he was accused . He was innocent , and he could be tranquil on that score . "
148596	148604	148605	148605	she	133	" he added with a little impatience , "
148626	148627	148613	148613	I	0	" "
148633	148664	148631	148631	Her	133	" cried the Archdeacon , restored to all his first impetuosity . He could not swear , because it was against his cloth and his principles ; but he said , "
148668	148683	148631	148631	Her	133	" in a tone which would have perfectly become a much less mild expletive . "
148694	148698	148699	148699	I	0	" he said . "
148800	148811	148797	148797	my	0	" said Mr Beverley , with solemnity , taking breath , "
148843	148862	148865	148865	Charles	206	" But he was interrupted once more . Mrs Mortimer made her faint voice heard in a remonstrance . "
148879	148979	148865	148865	Charles	206	" cried the terrified widow ; but that was not what stopped the Archdeacon . It was because his adversary laughed that he stopped short . No doubt it was the metallic laugh of a man in great agitation , but still Mr Beverley 's ear was not fine enough at that moment to discriminate . He paused as a man naturally pauses at the sound of ridicule , still furious , yet abashed , and half conscious of a ludicrous aspect to his passion — and turned his full face to his antagonist , and stood at bay . "
148988	148993	148865	148865	Charles	206	" Mr Cavendish said . "
149027	149033	149034	149034	I	0	" said the accused energetically ; "
149076	149154	149155	149155	I	0	" he added hastily ; and it was well for him that , instead of looking at the shrinking widow beside him as he said so , his eye had been caught by the eager eye of his sister , who was watching from her corner . With that stimulus he went on , calming himself down , and somehow subduing and imposing upon the angry man by the mere act of encountering him fairly and openly . "
149179	149204	149155	149155	I	0	" said the defendant , with a nervous moderation and self - restraint , in which there was also a certain thrill of indignation . "
149303	149329	149290	149290	You	206	" Mr Cavendish said , with an abrupt laugh , which this time was more feeble , and proved that his composure was giving way , "
149365	149366	149359	149359	you	206	" "
149375	149446	149367	149367	I	0	" said the Broad - Churchman hotly ; and then he made a pause , and that sense of ridicule which is latent in every Englishman 's mind , came to the Archdeacon 's aid . He began to feel ashamed of himself , and at the same time his eye caught his own reflection in a mirror , and the clerical coat which contrasted so grotesquely with his offer of "
149449	149461	149367	149367	I	0	" Mr Beverley started a little , and changed his tone . "
149468	149478	149367	149367	I	0	" he said , in his abrupt imperious way . "
149497	149721	149722	149722	You	3420	" the Archdeacon added austerely , with a significance which it is impossible to describe . His air and his words were full of severe and hostile meaning , and yet he did not know what he meant any more than Mr Cavendish did , who took him at his word , and retired , and made an end of the interview . Whatever the Archdeacon meant , it was his adversary who was the victor . He went off , threading his way through the curious spectators with a sense of relief that almost went the length of ecstasy . He might have been walking on his head for anything he knew . His senses were all lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming and incredible consciousness of safety . Where were they to meet elsewhere ? With pistols in a corner of Carlingford Common , or perhaps with their fists alone , as Mr Beverley was Broad - Church ? When a man has been near ruin and has escaped by a hair - breadth , he may be permitted to be out of his wits for a few minutes afterwards . And the idea of fighting a duel with a dignitary of the Church so tickled Mr Cavendish , that he had not the prudence to keep it to himself . "
149733	150295	149722	149722	You	3420	" he said to General Travers as he passed ; and the air of utter consternation with which the warrior regarded him , drove Mr Cavendish into such agonies of laughter , that he had to retire to the landing - place and suffocate himself to subdue it . If any man had said to him that he was hysterical , the chances are that it was he who would have called that man out , or at least knocked him down . But he had to steal downstairs afterwards and apply to Thomas for a cordial more potent than tea ; for naturally , when a man has been hanging over an abyss for ever so long , it is no great wonder if he loses his head and balance when he suddenly finds himself standing on firm ground , and feels that he has escaped . As for the Archdeacon , when the other was gone , he sat down silently on his abandoned chair . He was one of the men who take pride in seeing both sides of a question ; and to tell the truth , he was always very candid about disputed points in theology , and ready to entertain everybody 's objection ; but it was a different thing when the matter was a matter of fact . He put down his face into his hands , and tried to think whether it was possible that what he had just heard might be the true state of the case . To be sure , the widow who was seated half fainting by his side had given him the same account often enough , but somehow it was more effective from the lips of a man who confronted him than from the mild and weeping woman whom he loved better than anything else in the world , but whose opinion on any earthly ( or heavenly ) subject had not the weight of a straw upon him . He tried to take that view of it ; and then it occurred to him that nothing was more ludicrous and miserable than the position of a man who goes to law without adequate reason , or without proof to maintain his cause . Such a horrible divergence from everything that was just and right might be , as that the well - known and highly - esteemed Archdeacon Beverley might be held up for the amusement and edification of the country in a Times leader , which was a martyrdom the Archdeacon would have rather liked than otherwise in a worthy cause , but not for a wretched private business connected with money . He sighed as he pondered , feeling , as so many have felt , the difficulties which attend a good man 's progress in this life — how that which is just is not always that which is expedient , and how the righteous have to submit to many inconveniences in order that the adversary may have no occasion to blaspheme . In this state of mind a man naturally softens towards a tender and wistful sympathiser close at hand . He sighed once more heavily , and lifted his head , and took into his own a soft pale hand which was visible near him among the folds of black silk . "
150307	150313	150305	150305	Helen	176	" the Archdeacon said pathetically ; "
150323	150324	150305	150305	Helen	176	" "
150329	150335	150305	150305	Helen	176	" said Mrs Mortimer timidly ; "
150382	150505	150371	150371	I	0	" Here the poor woman stopped short all at once . What she meant to have said was , that she would make him a good wife , which nature and truth and the circumstances all prompted her to say — as the only possible solution to the puzzle . But when she had got so far , the poor widow stopped , blushing and tingling all over , with a sense of shame , more overwhelming than if she had done a wicked action . It was nothing but pure honesty and affection that prompted her to speak ; and yet , if it had been the vilest sentiment in human nature , she would not have been so utterly ashamed . "
150515	150629	150510	150510	I	0	" she cried , with sharp and sudden wretchedness ; and was not the least ashamed of telling a downright lie instead . But , to tell the truth , the Archdeacon was paying no particular attention . He had never loved any other woman ; but he was a little indifferent as to what innocent nonsense she might please to say . So that her confusion and misery , and even the half offer of herself which occasioned these feelings , were lost upon him . He kept her hand and caressed it in the midst of his own thoughts , as if it was a child 's head he was patting . "
150634	150650	150510	150510	I	0	" he said , coming back to her when he found she had stopped speaking , "
150676	150737	150510	150510	I	0	" he said reflectively . He went to that sort of thing often himself , and rather liked it , and did not think of any afterwards ; but perhaps the case of a weak woman was different , or perhaps it was only that he happened to be after his downfall in a pathetic and reflective state of mind . "
150740	150818	150510	150510	I	0	" said Mrs Mortimer . She did not take the word in any religious or philosophical , but in its merest matter - of - fact meaning , and she was sadly hurt and wounded to see that he had not even noticed what she said , much as she had been ashamed of saying it . She drew away her hand with a quick movement of despite and mortification , which filled Mr Beverley with surprise . "
150850	150957	150510	150510	I	0	" said the widow , with a rush of tears to her eyes . Why they did not fall , or how she kept herself from fainting — she who fainted so easily — she never , on reviewing the circumstances , could tell ; and Miss Marjoribanks always attributed it to the fact that she was absent , and there was no eau - de - Cologne on the table . But whatever the cause might be , Mrs Mortimer did not faint ; and perhaps there never was anything so like despair and bitterness as at that moment in her mild little feminine soul . "
150963	151035	150510	150510	I	0	" said the Archdeacon , rousing up a little ; and then he put out his large hand and took back the other , as if it had been a pencil or a book that he had lost . All this , let it be known , was well in the shadow , and could not be seen by the world in general to teach the young people a bad lesson . "
151049	151197	151043	151043	I	0	" said Mr Beverley ; and he stopped short , and resisted the effort his prisoner made to withdraw . Oddly enough at that moment his Rectory rose suddenly before him as in a vision — his Rectory , all handsome and sombre , without a soul in it , room after room uninhabited , and not a sound to be heard , except that of his own foot or his servant 's . It was curious what connection there could be between that and the garden , with its four walls , and the tiny cottage covered with wistaria . Such as it was , it moved the Archdeacon to a singular , and , considering the place and moment , rather indecorous proceeding . Instead of contenting himself with the resisting hand , he drew the widow 's arm within his as they sat together . "
151209	151212	151198	151198	I	0	" he said confidentially—"we
151280	151309	151272	151272	He	3367	" said the Archdeacon , with some satisfaction ; and then he added in a parenthesis , as if she had expressed some ridiculous doubt on the subject , "
151324	151470	151472	151472	him	3433	" It was in this rapid and summary manner that the whole business was settled . Naturally his companion had nothing to say against such a reasonable arrangement . She had never contradicted him in her life about anything but one thing ; and that being set aside , there was no possible reason why she should begin now . This was how the crisis came to an end , which had been of so much interest to the parties immediately affected . Mrs Woodburn had one of her nervous attacks next morning , and was very ill , and alarmed Dr Marjoribanks ; but at her very worst moment the incorrigible mimic convulsed her anxious medical adviser and all her attendants by a sudden adoption of the character of Mrs Mortimer , whom she must have made a careful study of the previous night . "
151480	151488	151489	151489	I	0	" cried the half - dead patient ; "
151517	151534	151508	151508	he	3433	" Mrs Woodburn said pathetically , with closed eyes and a face as pale as death . "
151544	151657	151535	151535	She	3435	" Dr Marjoribanks said afterwards ; and Mr Woodburn , who was fond of his wife in his way , and had been crying over her , burst into such an explosion of laughter that all the servants were scandalised . And the patient improved from that moment . She was perfectly well and in the fullest force a week afterwards , when she came to see Lucilla , who had also been slightly indisposed for a day or two . When Thomas had shut the door , and the two were quite alone , Mrs Woodburn hugged Miss Marjoribanks with a fervour which up to that moment she had never exhibited . "
151676	151992	151993	151993	You	3439	" she said , lifting her finger like the Archdeacon ; and for all the rest of that autumn and winter Mrs Woodburn kept society in Carlingford in a state of inextinguishable laughter . The odd thing was that Miss Marjoribanks , who had been one of her favourite characters , disappeared almost entirely from her repertory . Not quite altogether , because there were moments of supreme temptation which the mimic could not resist ; but as a general rule Lucilla was the only woman in Carlingford who escaped the universal critic . No sort of acknowledgment passed between them of the obligations one had to the other , and , what was still more remarkable , no discussion of the terrible evening when Lucilla had held the Archdeacon with her eye , and prevented the volcano from exploding . Perhaps Mrs Woodburn , for her part , would have been pleased to have had such an explanation , but Miss Marjoribanks knew better . She knew it was best not to enter upon confidences which neither could ever forget , and which might prevent them meeting with ease in the midst of the little world which knew nothing about it . What Lucilla knew , she knew , and could keep to herself ; but she felt at the same time that it was best to have no expansions on the subject . She kept it all to herself , and made the arrangements for Mrs Mortimer 's marriage , and took charge of everything . Everybody said that nothing could be more perfect than the bride 's toilette , which was as nice as could be , and yet not like a real bride after all ; a difference which was only proper under the circumstances ; for she was married in lavender , poor soul , as was to be expected . "
152015	152116	152013	152013	you	3439	" Lucilla said , as she kissed her that morning — and naturally all Carlingford knew that it was owing to her goodness that the widow had been taken care of and provided for , and saved up for the Archdeacon . Miss Marjoribanks , in short , presided over the ceremony as if she had been Mrs Mortimer 's mother , and superintended the wedding breakfast , and made herself agreeable to everybody . And in the meantime , before the marriage took place , most people in Carlingford availed themselves of the opportunity of calling on Mrs Mortimer . "
152142	152244	152118	152118	she	3441	" somebody said , with natural dismay . Lucilla did not discourage the practical result of this suggestion , but she felt an instinctive certainty in her mind that now Mr Beverley would never be bishop of Carlingford , and indeed that the chances were Carlingford would never be elevated into a bishopric at all . It was not until after the marriage that Mr Cavendish went away . To be sure , he was not absolutely present at the ceremony , but there can be no doubt that the magnificent parure which Mrs Mortimer received the evening before her marriage , "
152250	152275	152118	152118	she	3441	" which made everybody 's mouth water , and which she herself contemplated with mingled admiration and dismay , was sent by Mr Cavendish . "
152290	152299	152277	152277	you	3446	" the bride said , bewildered and bewildering . "
152315	152416	152417	152417	Women	492	" But Lucilla , for her part , had no doubt whatever on the subject ; and the perfect good taste of the offering made Miss Marjoribanks sigh , thinking once more how much that was admirable was wasted by the fatal obstacle which prevented Mr Cavendish from aspiring to anybody higher than Barbara Lake . As for the Archdeacon , he too found it very easy to satisfy his mind as to the donor of the emeralds . He put them away from him severely , and did not condescend to throw a second glance at their deceitful splendour . "
152422	152442	152417	152417	Women	492	" said Mr Beverley , who was still at the height of superiority , though he was a bridegroom . "
152464	152465	152417	152417	Women	492	" "
152481	152540	152541	152542	the gentlemen	574	" said Lucilla , moved for once in her life to be impertinent , like an ordinary girl . For really when a man showed himself so idiotic as to despise a beautiful set of emeralds , it went beyond even the well - known tolerance and compassionate good - humour with which Miss Marjoribanks regarded the vagaries of "
152544	152560	152561	152561	I	0	" There is a limit in all things , and this was going too far . "
152572	152577	152561	152561	I	0	" said the Archdeacon , "
152615	152628	152612	152612	Her	3450	" Mr Beverley added , with a little concession to the circumstances . "
152665	152666	152612	152612	Her	3450	" "
152669	152687	152612	152612	Her	3450	" said Miss Marjoribanks , who knew in her heart that the Archdeacon was afraid of her . "
152740	152774	152732	152732	I	0	" said Lucilla sweetly ; and the Archdeacon was so much frightened by the threat that he turned his ring instinctively , and quenched the glitter of the diamond in his closed hand . "
152780	152890	152732	152732	I	0	" he said hastily , and went away to seek some better occupation than tilting with the womankind , who naturally had possession of the bride 's little house and everything in it at that interesting moment . It was the last evening of Lucilla 's reign , and she was disposed to take the full good of it . And though Mrs Mortimer 's trousseau was modest , and not , as Lydia Brown repeated , like that of a real bride , it was still voluminous enough to fill the room to overflowing , where it was all being sorted and packed under Miss Marjoribanks 's eye . "
152899	152903	152732	152732	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
152943	152949	152938	152938	they	3456	" said Miss Marjoribanks reflectively , "
152983	152991	152978	152978	They	3456	" Lucilla added , with natural derision ; "
153020	153021	153022	153022	Lucilla	119	" "
153024	153029	153022	153022	Lucilla	119	" said the widow , "
153081	153150	153072	153072	they	574	" for indeed the bride thought it her duty , having won the prize in her own person , to point out to her young friend how , to attain the same end , she ought to behave . Miss Marjoribanks did not laugh , for her sense of humour , as has been said , was not strong , but she kissed her friend with protecting tenderness . "
153170	153488	153553	153553	she	3463	" said Lucilla ; and her superiority was so calm and serene , that Mrs Mortimer felt entirely ashamed of herself for making the suggestion . The widow was simple - minded , and , like most other women , it gratified her to believe that here and there , as in Miss Marjoribanks 's case , there existed one who was utterly indifferent to the gentlemen , and did not care whether they were pleased or not ; which restored a little the balance of the world to the widow - bride , who felt with shame that she cared a great deal , and was quite incapable of such virtue . As for Lucilla herself , she was not at that moment in conscious enjoyment of the strength of mind for which her friend gave her credit . On the contrary , she could not help a certain sense of surprised depression as she superintended the packing of the boxes . The man had had it in his power to propose to her , and he was going to be married to Mrs Mortimer ! It was not that Lucilla was wounded or disappointed , but that she felt it as a wonderful proof of the imperfection and weakness of human nature . Even in the nineteenth century , which has learnt so much , such a thing was possible ! It filled her with a gentle sadness as she had the things put in , and saw the emeralds safely deposited in their resting - place . Not that she cared for the Archdeacon , who had thus disposed of himself ; but still it was a curious fact that such a thing could be . Altogether it must be admitted that at this special moment Miss Marjoribanks occupied a difficult position . She had given the Archdeacon to understand that Mr Cavendish was a "
153492	153549	153550	153550	I	0	" ; and even when the danger was past , Lucilla scorned to acknowledge her pious prevarications . During all this interval she continued so gracious to him that everybody was puzzled , and Mrs Woodburn even insisted on her brother , after all , making his proposal , which would be better late than never . "
153559	153565	153553	153553	she	3463	" said the softened mimic , "
153584	153695	153696	153696	I	0	" for it has been already said that Mrs Woodburn , notwithstanding her knack of external discrimination , had very little real knowledge of character . And even at moments , Mr Cavendish himself , who ought to have known better , was half tempted to believe that Lucilla meant it . The effect upon Dr Marjoribanks was still more decided . He thought he saw in his daughter the indications of that weakness which is sometimes so surprising in women , and it disturbed the Doctor 's serenity ; and he actually tried to snub Lucilla on sundry occasions , with that wonderful fatuity which is common to men . "
153715	153749	153709	153709	I	0	" Dr Marjoribanks said one day at dessert , when they were alone . He took some chestnuts as he spoke , and burned his fingers , which did not improve his temper . "
153769	153790	153791	153792	Dear papa	303	" the Doctor added morosely , which was not a kind of address which Miss Marjoribanks was used to hear . "
153794	153798	153791	153792	Dear papa	303	" said Lucilla , "
153829	153905	153906	153906	I	0	" the dutiful daughter added , with a sigh . Nobody could doubt who knew Lucilla that she would have gladly taken the world on her shoulders , and saved everybody from those little misadventures ; but how could she help it if people absolutely would not take care of themselves ? The Doctor smiled grimly , but he was not satisfied . He was , on the contrary , furious in a quiet way . "
153925	153930	153923	153923	Lucilla	119	" said her father ; "
153946	153947	153948	153948	Papa	94	" "
153955	153978	153948	153948	Papa	94	" cried Miss Marjoribanks . She was really alarmed this time , and she did not hesitate to let it be apparent . "
153996	154000	153986	153986	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
154042	154074	154036	154036	I	0	" she said , with natural horror ; for the accusation , as everybody will perceive , was hard to bear . The Doctor laughed again , but with increased severity . "
154080	154084	154075	154075	We	3473	" he said . "
154162	154167	154186	154186	he	3474	" said Dr Marjoribanks ; "
154225	154226	154214	154214	I	0	" "
154237	154251	154252	154252	I	0	" said Lucilla , fixing her candid eyes upon her father 's face . "
154290	154299	154287	154288	Mr Cavendish	115	" she continued regretfully , after a pause . "
154323	154344	154345	154345	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks would have scorned to conceal the unfeigned regret which filled her mind when she uttered these words . "
154363	154424	154351	154351	I	0	" she said , and sighed once more . As for the Doctor , he forgot all about his chestnuts , and sat and stared at her , thinking in his ignorance that it was a piece of acting , and not knowing whether to be angry or to yield to the amusement which began to rise in his breast . "
154434	154439	154351	154351	I	0	" said Dr Marjoribanks , "
154465	154466	154456	154456	he	115	" "
154474	154482	154472	154472	papa	295	" said Lucilla , with pensive gravity . "
154534	154544	154527	154527	he	115	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with her usual candour . "
154557	154585	154527	154527	he	115	" For it was a moment of emotion , and she could not help giving utterance to the surprise with which this consideration naturally filled her mind . "
154595	154620	154527	154527	he	115	" said Dr Marjoribanks , growing more and more bewildered . But Lucilla only put aside her plate and got up from her chair . "
154629	154633	154627	154627	you	295	" she said . "
154703	154707	154712	154712	papa	295	" said Lucilla ; "
154728	155247	155248	155248	I	0	" Thus Miss Marjoribanks left the table , leaving her father in a singular state of satisfaction and surprise . He did not believe a word of what she had been saying , with that curious perversity common to the people who surrounded Lucilla , and which arose not so much from doubt of her veracity as from sheer excess of confidence in her powers . He thought she had foiled him in a masterly manner , and that she was only , as people say , amusing herself , and had no serious intentions ; and he laughed quietly to himself when she left him , in the satisfaction of finding there was nothing in it . Miss Marjoribanks , for her part , went on tranquilly with the arrangements for the marriage ; one by one she was disembarrassing herself from the complications which had grown round her during the first year of her reign in Carlingford ; and now only the last links of the difficulty remained to be unrolled . The explanation she had with Mr Cavendish himself was in every way more interesting . It happened pretty late one evening , when Lucilla was returning with her maid from the widow 's little cottage , which was so soon to be deserted . She was just at that moment thinking of the wistaria which had grown so nicely , and of all the trouble she had taken with the garden . Nobody could tell who might come into it now , after she had done so much for it ; and Miss Marjoribanks could not but have a momentary sense that , on the whole , it was a little ungrateful on the part of Mrs Mortimer , when everybody had taken such pains to make her comfortable . At this moment , indeed , Lucilla was slightly given to moralising , though with her usual wisdom she kept her meditations to herself . She was thinking with a momentary vexation of all the plants that had been put into the beds , and of so much time and trouble lost — when Mr Cavendish came up to her . It was a cold evening , and there was nothing in common between this walk and the walk they had taken together from Grove Street to Grange Lane on an earlier occasion . But this time , so far from being reluctant to accompany her , Mr Cavendish came to her side eagerly . The maid retired a little behind , and then the two found themselves in that most perfect of all positions for mutual confidence — a street not too crowded and noisy , all shrouded in the darkness , and yet twinkling with the friendly lights of an autumn evening . Nothing could have been more perfect than their isolation from the surrounding world , if they thought proper to isolate themselves ; and yet it was always there to be taken refuge in if the confidence should receive a check , or the mind of the chance companions change . "
155263	155298	155299	155300	the Beverleys	218	" said Mr Cavendish , after they had talked a little in the ordinary way , as everybody was doing in Grange Lane , about the two people henceforward to be known in Carlingford as "
155302	155303	155299	155300	the Beverleys	218	" "
155332	155333	155324	155324	I	0	" "
155342	155346	155324	155324	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
155448	155463	155467	155467	you	3487	" said Lucilla ; and there was a certain aggrieved tone in her voice . "
155483	155514	155467	155467	you	3487	" said Mr Cavendish , though he could not help laughing a little ; and then he paused , and his voice softened in the darkness by Lucilla 's side . "
155524	155528	155518	155518	us	3495	" he said . "
155555	155671	155551	155552	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" And here he came to a pause . He was fluttered and frightened , which was what she , and not he , ought to have been . And at the bottom of his heart he did not wish to say it , which gave far more force to his hesitation than simply a doubt whether he might dare . Perhaps Lucilla 's heart fluttered too , with a sense that the moment which once would not have been an unwelcome moment , had at last arrived . Her heart , it is true , was not very particularly engaged ; but still she was sensible of all Mr Cavendish 's capacities , and was "
155674	156058	156059	156059	I	0	" of him , as she said ; and her exertions on his behalf had produced their natural effect , and moved her affections a little . She made an involuntary pause for the hundredth part of a minute , and reckoned it all up again , and asked herself whether it were possible . There was something , in the first place , becoming and suitable in the idea that she , who was the only person who knew his secret , should take him and it together and make the best of them . And Lucilla had the consciousness that she could indeed make a great deal of Mr Cavendish . Nobody had ever crossed her path of whom so much could be made ; and as for any further danger of his real origin and position being found out and exposed to the world , Miss Marjoribanks was capable of smiling at that when the defence would be in her own hands . She might yet accept him , and have him elected member for Carlingford , and carry him triumphantly through all his difficulties . For a small part — nay , even for the half of a minute — Lucilla paused , and made a rapid review of the circumstances , and reconsidered her decision . Perhaps if Mr Cavendish had been really in earnest , that which was only a vague possibility might have become , in another minute , a fact and real . It was about the first time that her heart had found anything to say in the matter ; and the fact was that it actually fluttered in her reasonable bosom , and experienced a certain malaise which was quite new to her . Was it possible that she could be in love with Mr Cavendish ? or was it merely the excitement of a final decision which made that unusual commotion far away down at the bottom of Lucilla 's heart ? However that might be , Miss Marjoribanks triumphed over her momentary weakness . She saw the possibility , and at the same moment she saw that it could not be ; and while Mr Cavendish hesitated , she , who was always prompt and ready , made up her mind . "
156079	156094	156064	156064	I	0	" she said , ignoring the other part of her companion 's faltering address , "
156158	156192	156149	156149	I	0	" said Lucilla ; and , notwithstanding her courage , she too faltered a little , and felt that it was rather a serious piece of business that she had taken in hand . "
156195	156217	156149	156149	I	0	" Mr Cavendish said , like an echo of her voice ; but that was all he found time to say . "
156233	156237	156227	156227	you	3497	" said Lucilla ; "
156278	156293	156271	156271	you	3497	" said Lucilla , making a slight pause , and looking in his face . "
156297	156337	156271	156271	you	3497	" cried the assaulted man , in the extremity of his amazement and horror . As for Lucilla , she came a little closer to him , and shook her head in a maternal , semi - reproving way . "
156345	156350	156351	156351	you	3497	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
156392	156409	156390	156390	Rose	108	" said Lucilla , with admirable prudence , keeping off the difficult subject of Barbara herself , "
156444	156747	156428	156428	I	0	" she continued , with an effort . It was a bold thing to say , and Lucilla 's throat even contracted a little , as if to prevent the words from getting utterance ; but then she was not a person , when she knew a thing was right , to hesitate about doing it ; and in Miss Marjoribanks 's mind duty went before all , as has already been on several occasions said . After this a horrible silence fell upon the two — a silence which , like darkness , could be felt . The thunderbolt fell upon the victim 's unprotected head without any warning . The idea that Lucilla would talk to him about Barbara Lake was the very last that could have entered Mr Cavendish 's mind . He was speechless with rage and mortification . He took it for an insult inflicted upon him in cold blood , doing Lucilla much injustice as the other people who took the candid expression of her sentiments for a piece of acting . He was a gentleman , notwithstanding his doubtful origin , and civilised down to his very finger - tips ; but he would have liked to have knocked Miss Marjoribanks down , though she was a woman . And yet , as she was a woman , he dared not for his life make any demonstration of his fury . He walked along by her side down into the respectable solitude of Grange Lane , passing through a bright bit of George Street , and seeing askance , by the light from the shop windows , his adviser walking beside him , with the satisfaction of a good conscience in her face . This awful silence lasted until they reached Dr Marjoribanks 's door . "
156757	156766	156749	156749	you	3507	" said Lucilla , holding out her hand . "
156797	156808	156790	156790	you	3507	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with a touch of pathos ; "
156834	156835	156826	156826	I	0	" "
156847	156856	156840	156840	I	0	" said Mr Cavendish , with quiet fury , "
156889	156926	156886	156886	your	3507	" said the ungrateful man , with the most truculent meaning . As for Miss Marjoribanks , she pressed quite kindly the hurried hand with which he touched hers , and went in , still saying , "
156931	157299	156886	156886	your	3507	" She had done her duty , whatever might come of it . He rushed home furious ; but she went to a little worsted - work with a mind at peace with itself and all men . She was gentler than usual even to the maids , who always found Miss Marjoribanks a good mistress — but she felt a little sad in the solitude of her genius . For it is true that to be wiser and more enlightened than one 's neighbours is in most cases a weariness to the flesh . She had made a sacrifice , and nobody appreciated it . Instead of choosing a position which pleased her imagination , and suited her energies , and did not go against her heart , Lucilla , moved by the wisest discretion , had decided , not without regret , to give it up . She had sacrificed her own inclination , and a sphere in which her abilities would have had the fullest scope , to what she believed to be the general good ; and instead of having the heroism acknowledged , she was misunderstood and rewarded with ingratitude . When Miss Marjoribanks found herself alone in the solitude of her drawing - room , and in the still greater solitude , as we have said , of her genius , she felt a little sad , as was natural . But at the same moment there came into Lucilla 's mind a name , a humble name , which has been often pronounced in the pages of this history , and it gave her once more a certain consolation . A sympathetic presence seemed to diffuse itself about her in her loneliness . There are moments when the faith of a very humble individual may save a great soul from discouragement ; and the consciousness of being believed in once more came with the sweetest and most salutary effect upon Lucilla 's heart . It was the very day after the marriage , and two or three days after this conversation , that Mr Cavendish left Carlingford . He went to spend the winter in Italy , which had long been "
157302	157322	156869	156869	You	3507	" of his , as he explained to some of the young ladies — most of whom had the same "
157325	157605	156869	156869	You	3507	" without the enviable power of carrying it out . He made very brief and formal adieux to Lucilla , to the extreme amazement of all the surrounding world , and then disappeared , leaving — just at that moment after the excitement of the marriage was over , when Grange Lane stood most in need of somebody to rouse its drooping spirits — a wonderful blank behind him . Lucilla said much less about her feelings on this occasion than she was in the habit of doing , but there could be no doubt that she felt it , and felt it acutely . And the worst of it was , that it was she who was universally blamed for the sudden and unexplained departure of the most popular man in Carlingford . Some people thought he had gone away to escape from the necessity of proposing to her ; and some of more friendly and charitable disposition believed with Mrs Chiley that Lucilla had refused him ; and some , who were mostly outsiders and of a humble class , were of opinion that Miss Marjoribanks had exercised all her influence to send Mr Cavendish out of the way of Barbara Lake . It was with this impression that Rose made her way one of those foggy autumn mornings through the fallen leaves with which the garden was carpeted , to see if any explanation was to be got from Lucilla . The art - inspectors from Marlborough House had just paid their annual visit to Carlingford , and had found the Female School of Design in a condition which , as they said in their report , "
157611	157759	157760	157760	I	0	" and Rose had also won a prize for her veil in the exhibition at Kensington of ornamental art . These were triumphs which would have made the little artist overwhelmingly happy , if they had not been neutralised by other circumstances ; but as it was , they only aggravated the difficulties of the position in which she found herself . She came to Lucilla in a bonnet — a circumstance which of itself was solemn and ominous ; for generally that portentous article of dress , which was home - made , and did not consist with cheerful dispositions , was reserved by Rose for going to church ; and her soft cheeks were pale , and the hazel eyes more dewy than usual , though it was rain , and not dew , that had been falling from them during those last painful days . "
157770	157774	157760	157760	I	0	" said Rose ; "
157837	157843	157828	157828	You	3508	" said the straightforward Rose . "
157867	157868	157869	157869	My	0	" "
157879	157884	157872	157872	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
157924	157925	157926	157926	Lucilla	119	" "
157928	157936	157926	157926	Lucilla	119	" cried Rose , with flashing eyes , "
157993	157999	158000	158000	You	119	" cried the little artist . "
158063	158084	158085	158085	I	0	" Lucilla was in a subdued state of mind , as may have been perceived , and answered quite meekly . "
158099	158108	158090	158090	you	3513	" she said , more sadly than surprised . "
158138	158213	158131	158131	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added . She sat down as she spoke , after being repulsed by Rose , with an air of depression which was quite unusual to her ; for to be blamed and misunderstood on all sides was hard for one who was always working in the service of her fellow - creatures , and doing everything for the best . As for Rose , her heart smote her on the instant . "
158220	158242	158215	158215	you	119	" she said , in her innocence . It was the first time such an idea had entered into her mind . "
158252	158269	158270	158270	I	0	" said Lucilla ; though even as she said it she began to recover her spirits . "
158296	158297	158300	158300	you	119	" "
158309	158351	158300	158300	you	119	" Rose began to say , for she was in her way a wise little woman ; but her heart smote her again , and she restrained the truism , and then after a little pause she resumed her actual business . "
158370	158374	158375	158375	She	119	" said Rose . "
158386	158387	158375	158375	She	119	" "
158400	158444	158445	158445	I	0	" asked Miss Marjoribanks . She was sorry , for it was quite the contrary of the advice she had given , but still it would be wrong to deny that Mr Cavendish rose higher in Lucilla 's opinion when she heard it . "
158474	158486	158470	158470	she	119	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with perhaps a touch of contempt . "
158501	158502	158495	158495	she	119	" "
158512	158529	158506	158506	you	0	" said Rose , with some indignation — for at seventeen a broken heart comes natural . "
158547	158557	158558	158558	I	0	" cried the little artist , changing her tone . "
158645	158678	158636	158636	I	0	" cried Rose , with a sudden outburst of tears . All this was sufficiently unintelligible to Miss Marjoribanks , who was not the least in anxiety about Barbara 's breaking heart . "
158693	158727	158728	158728	I	0	" said Lucilla , forgetting how little her past exertions had been appreciated ; and Rose , with equal inconsistency , dried her tears at the sound of Miss Marjoribanks 's reassuring voice . "
158740	158744	158730	158730	I	0	" she said . "
158793	158794	158783	158783	She	119	" "
158801	158813	158783	158783	She	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , who could not believe her ears . "
158818	158858	158859	158859	She	119	" said Rose calmly ; for though she had been partly brought up at Mount Pleasant , she had not the elevated idea of an instructress of youth which might have been expected from a pupil of that establishment . "
158866	158874	158859	158859	She	119	" Rose added , with quiet despair , "
158910	158939	158940	158940	Her	119	" When she had said this she brushed the last tear off her eyelashes , and sat straight up , a little martyr and heroic victim to duty . "
158953	158982	158983	158983	She	119	" ; but still there was a certain desperation in the composure with which Rose regarded , after the first outburst , the abandonment of all her hopes . "
158989	158994	158995	158995	she	119	" said Lucilla indignantly ; "
159081	159082	159085	159085	I	0	" "
159087	159091	159085	159085	I	0	" said Rose ; "
159149	159213	159144	159144	nobody	4434	" said Rose , with big tears coming to her eyes . Her Career was dear to her heart , and those two tears welled up from the depths ; but then there would be nobody else to do it — a consideration which continually filters out the people who are good for anything out of the muddy current of the ordinary world . "
159229	159233	159234	159234	You	3526	" cried Lucilla . "
159286	159287	159283	159283	you	3526	" "
159294	159298	159283	159283	you	3526	" said Rose . "
159313	159362	159308	159308	She	3536	" said the little martyr , and the two big tears fell , making two big round blotches upon the strings of that bonnet which Lucilla had difficulty in keeping her hands off . But when she had thus expressed her feelings , Rose relented over her sister . "
159382	159389	159378	159378	herself	3536	" said the young artist mournfully . "
159396	159398	159391	159391	I	0	" said Rose—"quite
159424	159475	159409	159409	her	3536	" And this time the tears were dashed away by an indignant little hand . Barbara 's heart , if she had such an organ , had never in its existence cost such bitter drops . But as for Lucilla , what could she do ? She could only repeat , "
159484	159949	159477	159477	I	0	" with a melancholy sense that she was here balked and could do no more . For even the aid of Miss Marjoribanks was as nothing against dead selfishness and folly , the two most invincible forces in the world . Instead of taking the business into her own hands , and carrying it through triumphantly as she had hitherto been in the habit of doing , Lucilla could only minister to the sufferer , and keep up her courage , and mourn over the Career thus put in danger . Barbara 's advertisement was in the newspapers , and her foolish mind was made up ; and the hope that nobody would have her was a forlorn hope , for somebody always does have the incapable people , as Miss Marjoribanks was well aware . And the contralto had been of some use in Grange Lane and a little in Grove Street , and it would be difficult , either in the one sphere or the other , to find any one to fill her place . It was thus amid universal demolition that Christmas approached , and Miss Marjoribanks ended the first portion of her eventful career . One fytte of Lucilla 's history is here ended , and another is to be told . We have recorded her beginning in all the fulness of youthful confidence and undaunted trust in her own resources ; and have done our best to show that in the course of organising society Miss Marjoribanks , like all other benefactors of their kind , had many sacrifices to make , and had to undergo the mortification of finding out that many of her most able efforts turned to other people 's profit and went directly against herself . She began the second period of her career with , to some certain extent , that sense of failure which is inevitable to every high intelligence after a little intercourse with the world . She had succeeded in a great many things , but yet she had not succeeded in all ; and she had found out that the most powerful exertions in behalf of friends not only fail to procure their gratitude , but sometimes convert them into enemies , and do actual harm ; which is a discovery which can only be made by those who devote themselves , as Miss Marjoribanks had done , to the good of the human species . She had done everything for the best , and yet it had not always turned out for the best ; and even the people who had been most ready to appeal to her for assistance in their need , had proved the readiest to accuse her when something disagreeable happened , and to say "
159955	162499	159952	159952	your	3545	" In the second stage of her progress Miss Marjoribanks found herself , with a great responsibility upon her shoulders , with nearly the entire social organisation of Carlingford depending upon her ; and , at the same time , with her means of providing for the wants of her subjects sensibly diminished , and her confidence in the resources of the future impaired to an equal degree . One thing was sure , that she had taken the work upon her shoulders , and that she was not the woman to draw back , whatever the difficulties might be . She did not bate a jot of her courage , though the early buoyancy of hope had departed , never to return . It is true that she was not so joyful and triumphant a figure as when she conquered Nancy , and won over Dr Marjoribanks , and electrified Mr Holden by choosing curtains which suited her complexion ; but with her diminished hopes and increased experience and unabated courage , no doubt Miss Marjoribanks presented a still nobler and more imposing aspect to everybody who had an eye for moral grandeur , though it would be difficult to tell how many of such worthy spectators existed in Grange Lane . There was , as our readers are aware , another subject also on which Lucilla had found her position altered . It was quite true that , had she been thinking of that , she never need have come home at all ; and that , in accepting new furniture for the drawing - room , she had to a certain extent pledged herself not to marry immediately , but to stay at home and be a comfort to her dear papa . This is so delicate a question that it is difficult to treat it with the freedom necessary for a full development of a not unusual state of mind . Most people are capable of falling in love only once or twice , or at the most a very few times , in their life ; and disappointed and heartbroken suitors are not so commonly to be met with as perhaps could be wished . But at the same time , there can be little doubt that the chief way in which society is supposed to signify its approval and admiration and enthusiasm for a lady , is by making dozens of proposals to her , as may be ascertained from all the best - informed sources . When a woman is a great beauty , or is very brilliant and graceful , or even is only agreeable and amusing , the ordinary idea is that the floating men of society , in number less or more according to the lady 's merits , propose to her , though she may not perhaps accept any of them . In proportion as her qualities rise towards the sublime , these victims are supposed to increase ; and perhaps , to tell the truth , no woman feels herself set at her true value until some poor man , or set of men , have put , as people say , their happiness into her hands . It is , as we have said , a delicate subject to discuss ; for the truth is , that this well - known and thoroughly established reward of female excellence had not fallen to Miss Marjoribanks 's lot . There was Tom , to be sure , but Tom did not count . And as for the other men who had been presented to Lucilla as eligible candidates for her regard , none of them had given her this proof of their admiration . The year had passed away , and society had laid no tribute of this description upon Lucilla 's shrine . The Archdeacon had married Mrs Mortimer instead , and Mr Cavendish had been led away by Barbara Lake ! After such an experience nothing but the inherent sweetness and wholesome tone of Miss Marjoribanks 's character could have kept her from that cynicism and disbelief in humanity which is so often the result of knowledge of the world . As for Lucilla , she smiled as she thought of it , not cynically , but with a sweetly melancholy smile . What she said to herself was , Poor men ! they had had the two ways set before them , and they had not chosen the best . It made her sad to have this proof of the imperfection of human nature thrust upon her , but it did not turn her sweet into bitter , as might have been the case with a more ordinary mind . Notwithstanding that this universal reward , which in other cases is , as everybody knows , given so indiscriminately , and with such liberality , had altogether failed in her case , Lucilla still resumed her way with a beautiful constancy , and went forward in the face of fate undaunted and with a smile . It was thus that she began the second period of her career . Up to this moment there had never been a time in which it was not said in Carlingford that some one was paying attention to Miss Marjoribanks ; but at present no one was paying attention to her . There were other marriages going on around her , and other preliminaries of marriage , but nobody had proposed to Lucilla . Affairs were in this state when she took up her burden again boldly , and set out anew upon her way . It was a proof of magnanimity and philanthropy which nobody could have asked from her , if Lucilla had not been actuated by higher motives than those that sway the common crowd . Without any assistance but that of her own genius — without the stimulating applause of admirers , such as a woman in such circumstances has a right to calculate upon — with no sympathising soul to fall back upon , and nothing but a dull level of ordinary people before her,—Miss Marjoribanks , undaunted , put on her harness and resumed her course . The difficulties she had met only made her more friendly , more tender , to those who were weaker than herself , and whom evil fortune had disabled in the way . When Barbara Lake got her situation , and went out for a governess , and Rose 's fears were realised , and she had with bitter tears to relinquish her Career , Lucilla went and sat whole afternoons with the little artist , and gave her the handiest assistance , and taught her a great many things which she never could have learned at the School of Design . And the effect of this self - abnegation was , that Lucilla bore General Travers 's decision , and gave up all hope of the officers , with a stout - heartedness which nobody could have looked for , and did not hesitate to face her position boldly , and to erect her standard , and to begin her new campaign , unaided and unappreciated as she was . People who know no better may go away upon marriage tours , or they may fly off to foreign travel , or go out as governesses , when all things do not go just as they wish . But as for Miss Marjoribanks , she stood bravely at her post , and scorned to flinch or run away . Thus commenced , amid mists of discouragement , and in an entire absence of all that was calculated to stimulate and exhilarate , the second grand period of Lucilla 's life . It would be vain to follow Lucilla in detail through her consistent and admirable career ; nor is it necessary to say that she went on steadily in face of all her discouragements , with that mixture of success and failure which comes natural to all human affairs . The singular thing about it was , that the years passed on , and that she was permitted by the world in general to fulfil her own promise and prophecy about remaining ten years at home to be a comfort to her dear papa . She had been nineteen when she began her career , and she was nine - and twenty when that little episode occurred with young Dr Rider , before he was married to his present wife . There would have been nothing in the least unsuitable in a marriage between Dr Rider and Miss Marjoribanks , though people who were the best informed never thought either of them had any serious meaning ; but , of course , the general public , having had Lucilla for a long time before their eyes , naturally added on seven or eight years to her age , and concluded her to be a great deal older than the young doctor , though everybody allowed that it would have been a most advantageous match for him in every possible point of view . But , however , it did not come to anything , no more than a great many other nibbles of the same kind did . The period arrived at which Lucilla had thought she might perhaps have begun to go off in her looks , but still there was no immediate appearance of any change of name or condition on her part . Many people quite congratulated themselves on the fact , as it was impossible to imagine what might be the social condition of Grange Lane without Miss Marjoribanks ; but it is doubtful whether Lucilla congratulated herself . She was very comfortable , no doubt , in every way , and met with little opposition to speak of , and had things a great deal more in her own hands than she might have had , had there been a husband in the case to satisfy ; but notwithstanding , she had come to an age when most people have husbands , and when an independent position in the world becomes necessary to self - respect . To be sure , Lucilla was independent ; but then — there is a difference , as everybody knows . And Miss Marjoribanks could not but feel that the world had not shown that appreciation of her , to which , in her earlier days , she looked forward with so little fear . The ten years , as they had really gone by , were very different from the ten years she had looked forward to , when , in the triumph of her youth , she named that period as the time when she might probably begin to go off , and would be disposed to marry . By this time the drawing - room carpets and curtains had faded a little , and Lucilla had found out that the delicate pale green which suited her complexion was not to call a profitable colour ; and nobody could have thought or said that to marry at this period would be in the least degree to swindle the Doctor . Thus the moment had arrived to which she looked forward , but the man had not arrived with it . Ten years had passed , during which she had been at the head of society in Grange Lane , and a great comfort to her dear papa ; and now , if there remained another development for Lucilla 's character , it was about time that it should begin to show itself . But at the same time , the main element necessary for that new development did not seem at present likely to be found in Grange Lane . Unless , indeed , it might happen to be found in the person of Mr Ashburton , who was so often in Carlingford that he might be said to form a part of society there . It was he who was related to the Richmonds , who were a family much respected in the county . He had been at the bar , and even begun to distinguish himself , before old Miss Penrhyn died and left him the Firs . He had begun to distinguish himself , but he had not , it appeared , gone so far as to prevent him from coming down to his new property and settling upon it , and taking his place as a local notability . He was not a man who could be expected to care for evening parties in a provincial town ; but he never refused to dine with Dr Marjoribanks , and was generally popular upstairs , where he always paid a little attention to Lucilla , though nothing very marked and noticeable . Mr Ashburton was not like Mr Cavendish , for instance ( if anybody remembered Mr Cavendish ) , a man whose money might be in the Funds , but who more probably speculated . Everybody knew everything about him , which was an ease to the public mind . The Firs was as well known as Carlingford steeple , and how much it was worth a year , and everything about it ; and so was the proprietor 's pedigree , which could be traced to a semi - mythical personage known as old Penrhyn , whose daughter was Sir John Richmond 's grandmother . The Firs , it is true , had descended in the female line , but still it is something to know where a man comes from , even on one side . Mr Ashburton made himself very agreeable in the neighbourhood , and was never above enlightening anybody on a point of law . He used to say that it was kind to give him something to do , which was an opinion endorsed practically by a great many people . It is true that some of his neighbours wondered much to see his patience , and could not make out why he chose to rusticate at the Firs at his age , and with his abilities . But either he never heard these wonderings , or at least he never took any notice of them . He lived as if he liked it , and settled down , and presented to all men an aspect of serene contentment with his sphere . And it would be difficult to say what suggestion or association it was which brought him all of a sudden into Miss Marjoribanks 's head , one day , when , seeing a little commotion in Masters 's shop , she went in to hear what it was about . The cause of the commotion was an event which had been long expected , and which , indeed , ten years before , had been looked on as a possible thing to happen any day . The wonder was , not that old Mr Chiltern should die , but that he should have lived so long . The ladies in Masters 's cried , "
162505	162833	162500	162503	Poor dear old man	3546	" and said to each other that however long it might have been expected , a death always seemed sudden at the last . But , to tell the truth , the stir made by this death was rather pleasant than sad . People thought , not of the career which was ended , but of the one which must now begin , and of the excitement of an election , which was agreeable to look forward to . As for Lucilla , when she too had heard the news , and had gone upon her way , it would be vain to assert that a regretful recollection of the time when Mr Cavendish was thought a likely man to succeed Mr Chiltern did not occur to her . But when Miss Marjoribanks had dismissed that transitory thought , Mr Ashburton suddenly came into her head by one of those intuitions which have such an effect upon the mind that receives them . Lucilla was not of very marked political opinions , and perhaps was not quite aware what Mr Ashburton 's views were on the Irish Church question , or upon parliamentary reform ; but she said after , that it came into her mind in a moment , like a flash of lightning , that he was the man . The idea was so new and so striking , that she turned back and went , in the excitement of the moment , to suggest it to Mrs Chiley , and see what her old friend and the Colonel would say . Of course , if such a thing was practicable , there was no time to lose . She turned round quickly , according to her prompt nature ; and such was her absorbed interest in the idea of Mr Ashburton , that she did not know until she had almost done it , that she was walking straight into her hero 's arms . "
162839	162848	162851	162851	you	222	" said Lucilla , with a little scream , "
162885	162886	162876	162876	I	0	" "
162890	162931	162876	162876	I	0	" said Mr Ashburton , looking at her with a smile and a sudden look of interest ; for it is always slightly exciting to the most philosophical mortal to know that somebody else 's mind is full of him . "
162942	162943	162933	162933	you	222	" "
162951	162956	162944	162944	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
162978	162998	162973	162974	Mr Chiltern	140	" Lucilla put the question solemnly , and her companion grew a little red as he looked at her . "
163005	163064	163002	163002	my	0	" he said , though he still smiled ; and then he grew redder and redder , though he ought to have been above showing such signs of emotion ; and looked at her curiously , as if he would seize what she was going to say out of her eyes or her lips before it was said . "
163073	163077	163078	163078	He	140	" said Lucilla . "
163122	163129	163114	163114	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , solemnly ; "
163224	163280	163217	163217	you	3550	" said Lucilla . It was not a thing to speak lightly about , and for her part she spoke very solemnly ; and as for Mr Ashburton , his face flushed deeper and deeper . He stood quite still in the excitement of the moment , as if she had given him a blow . "
163293	163313	163284	163284	I	0	" he cried ; and then he put out his hand in an agitated way and grasped her hand . "
163331	163458	163314	163314	You	88	" he said , in a trembling voice . It was a little public at the top of Grange Lane , where people were liable to pass at every moment ; but still Miss Marjoribanks accepted the pressure of the hand , which , to be sure , had nothing whatever to do with love - making . She was more shy of such demonstrations than she had been in her confident youth , knowing that in most cases they never came to anything , and at the same time that the spectators kept a vivid recollection of them ; but still , in the excitement of the moment , Miss Marjoribanks accepted and returned in a womanly way the pressure of Mr Ashburton 's hand . "
163468	163677	163463	163463	us	3554	" Lucilla said , feeling that no time was to be lost . It was a conference very different from that which , had Mr Chiltern been so well advised as to die ten years before , might have been held in Dr Marjoribanks 's drawing - room over his successor 's prospects ; but at the same time there was something satisfactory to the personal sentiments of both in the way in which this conversation had come about . When Lucilla took off her hat and sat down to give him all her attention , Mr Ashburton could not but feel the flattering character of the interest she was taking in him . She was a woman , and young ( comparatively speaking ) , and was by no means without admirers , and unquestionably took the lead in society ; and to be divined by such a person was perhaps , on the whole , sweeter to the heart of the aspirant than if Colonel Chiley had found out his secret , or Dr Marjoribanks , or even the Rector : and Lucilla for her part had all that natural pleasure in being the first to embrace a new interest which was natural under the circumstances . "
163685	163698	163679	163679	us	3555	" she said , giving Mr Ashburton a chair near her own . "
163759	163760	163741	163742	Mr Ashburton	222	" "
163782	163787	163741	163742	Mr Ashburton	222	" said Mr Ashburton , "
163812	163813	163797	163797	me	0	" "
163821	163832	163797	163797	me	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with her usual good sense , "
163879	163880	163881	163881	My	0	" "
163886	163900	163881	163881	My	0	" Mr Ashburton said , with a smile , and a little hesitation , "
163935	163936	163931	163931	my	0	" "
163952	163956	163947	163947	we	3563	" said Lucilla : "
164029	164034	164017	164017	you	3564	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
164056	164057	164044	164044	you	3564	" "
164069	164150	164151	164151	I	0	" said Mr Ashburton , and he laughed ; but , to tell the truth , he was not a man of very quick understanding , and at the first outset of the thing he did not understand Lucilla ; and he was a little — just a very little — disappointed . She had divined him , which was a wonderful proof of her genius ; but yet at the bottom she was only an ignorant woman after all . "
164161	164166	164151	164151	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
164278	164582	164270	164270	them	3576	" said Lucilla , with energy . She stopped short , with her colour rising and her eyes brightening . She felt herself inspired , which was a new sensation , and very pleasant ; and then the idea of such a coming struggle was sweet to Miss Marjoribanks , and the conviction burst upon her that she was striking out a perfectly new and original line . As for her candidate , he smiled , and hesitated , and paid her pretty little compliments for a few minutes longer , and said it was very good of her to interest herself in his fortunes . All which Lucilla listened to with great impatience , feeling that it had nothing to do with the matter in hand . But then after these few minutes had elapsed the meaning of his fair adviser , as he called her , began to dawn upon Mr Ashburton 's mind . He began to prick up his mental ears , so to speak , and see that it was not womanish ignorance , but an actual suggestion . For , after all , so long as he was the Man for Carlingford , all the rest was of little importance . He took something out of his pocket , which was his address to the constituency of Carlingford ( for being anxious on the subject , he had heard of Mr Chiltern 's death an hour or two before anybody else ) , and choke - full of political sentiments . In it he described to the electors what he would do if they sent him to Parliament , as carefully as if their election could make him Prime Minister at least ; and naturally a man does not like to sacrifice such a confession of faith . "
164592	164617	164583	164583	I	0	" he said , spreading it out with affectionate care : but Lucilla had already arranged her plans , and knew better than that . "
164627	164632	164619	164619	you	3577	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
164712	164726	164754	164755	Mr Ashburton	222	" said Lucilla , with fine satire , of which she was unconscious , "
164765	164875	164754	164755	Mr Ashburton	222	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with all the warmth of sudden conviction . She felt a little like Joan of Arc as she spoke . When an army has the aid of a sacred maiden to bring inspiration to its counsels , the idea of going on in the old formal way is no longer to be tolerated . And such was the force of Lucilla 's conviction , that Mr Ashburton , though he felt a little affronted , and could not but look with fond and compunctious regret upon his address , yet began more and more to feel that there was justice in what she said . "
164884	164956	164876	164876	I	0	" he said , rather stiffly , and put up his address — for it was natural , when he had done her such an honour as to offer to read it to her , that he should be affronted by her refusal . It was a bold experiment on Lucilla 's part , but then she was carried out of herself at the moment by this singular flash of inspiration . "
164965	164970	164962	164962	you	0	" Mr Ashburton continued ; "
165006	165033	164996	164996	I	0	" And here he stopped short , and looked as if he were going to get up and go away , which would have spoiled all . "
165042	165046	165047	165047	somebody	312	" said Lucilla ; "
165118	165119	165114	165114	you	0	" "
165122	165126	165114	165114	you	0	" said the candidate eagerly—"about
165137	165153	165132	165132	myself	0	" Lucilla smiled compassionately , and with the gentlest tolerance , at this wild suggestion . "
165161	165180	165154	165154	I	0	" she said , with that meekness which people assume when it is of no use being impatient . "
165229	165401	165223	165223	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . As for Mr Ashburton , he did not begin to laugh until he had fixed upon her that gaze of utter amazement and doubt with which on many similar occasions ordinary people had regarded Lucilla — thinking she was joking , or acting , or doing something quite different from the severe sincerity which was her leading principle . She was so used to it , that she waited with perfect patience till her companion 's explosion of amusement was over . He was thinking to himself what a fool she was , or what a fool he was to think of taking a woman into his counsels , or what curious unintelligible creatures women were , made up of sense and folly ; and all the time he laughed , which was a relief to his feelings . Miss Marjoribanks laughed a little too , to keep him in countenance , for she was always the soul of good nature ; and then she repeated , "
165415	165416	165403	165403	you	3591	" "
165428	165433	165437	165437	you	3591	" said the candidate , "
165464	165519	165454	165454	I	0	" Mr Ashburton added , laughing , and making a mock bow to her , and getting his hat as he did so — for he had naturally calmed down a little from the first enthusiasm with which he had hailed the woman who divined him , and he did not mean to stay . "
165528	165533	165535	165535	you	3591	" said Lucilla thoughtfully , "
165561	165755	165555	165555	you	3591	" As she spoke she took up a handful of ribbons which were lying by , and put them up to her face with an air of serious deliberation which once more disturbed Mr Ashburton 's gravity . And yet , when a young woman who is not at all bad - looking puts up a rustling , gleaming knot of ribbons to her hair and asks a man 's opinion of the same , the man must be a philosopher or a wretch indeed who does not give a glance to see the effect . The candidate for Carlingford looked and approached , and even , in the temptation of the moment , took some of the long streamers in his hand . And he began to think Miss Marjoribanks was very clever , and the most amusing companion he had met with for a long time . And her interest in him touched his heart ; and , after all , it is no drawback to a woman to be absurd by moments . His voice grew quite soft and caressing as he took the end of ribbon into his hand . "
165766	165908	165555	165555	you	3591	" he said , with a sense of patronage and protection which was very delightful ; and the two were still talking and laughing over the silken link thus formed between them , when the people came in whom Lucilla was expecting to lunch , and who were naturally full of Mr Chiltern 's death , which , poor old man ! was so sudden at the last . Mr Ashburton stayed , though he had not intended it , and made himself very pleasant . And Lucilla took no pains to conceal her opinion that the thing was neither to consider Whigs nor Tories , but a good Man . And Major Brown , who had come with his daughters , echoed this sentiment so warmly that Mr Ashburton was entirely convinced of the justice of Miss Marjoribanks 's ideas . "
165921	165935	165913	165916	a tip - topper	3599	" Major Brown said , who was not very refined in his expressions ; "
165965	166100	166105	166105	his	3603	" Mr Ashburton did not declare himself to Major Brown , but he dashed off his new address ten minutes after he had taken leave of Miss Marjoribanks , and put the other one in the fire like a Christian , and telegraphed for his agent to town . Lucilla , for her part , made an effort equally great and uncompromising . She took the ribbon Mr Ashburton had played with , and cut it up into cockades of all descriptions . It was an early moment , but still there was no time to be lost in a matter of such importance . And she wore one on her breast and one in her hair when Mr Ashburton 's address was published , and all the world was discussing the new candidate . "
166115	166119	166111	166111	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
166237	166267	166231	166231	Minerva	227	" said Miss Marjoribanks . And she took up Mr Ashburton 's cause openly , and unfurled his standard , and did not even ask her father 's opinion . "
166285	166489	166274	166274	he	94	" said Lucilla . And , naturally , she threw all the younger portion of Grange Lane , which was acquainted with Mr Ashburton , and looked forward eagerly to a little excitement , and liked the idea of wearing a violet - and - green cockade , into a flutter of excitement . Among these rash young people there were even a few individuals who took Lucilla 's word for it , and knew that Mr Ashburton was very nice , and did not see that anything more was necessary . To be sure , these enthusiasts were chiefly women , and in no cases had votes ; but Miss Marjoribanks , with instinctive correctness of judgment , decided that there were more things to be thought of than the electors . And she had the satisfaction of seeing with her own eyes and hearing with her own ears the success of that suggestion of her genius . Carlingford had rarely been more excited by any public event than it was by the address of the new candidate , who was in the field before anybody else , and who had the boldness to come before them without uttering any political creed . "
166532	166538	166540	166540	they	3605	" said the daring candidate : "
166578	167017	167018	167018	I	0	" This was what Mr Ashburton said in his address , though at that moment he had still his other address in his pocket , in which he had entered at some length into his distinctive personal views . It was thus that an independent candidate , unconnected with party , took the field in Carlingford , with Miss Marjoribanks , like another Joan of Arc , wearing a knot of ribbons , violet and green , in her hair , to inspire and lead him on . Life with most people is little more than a succession of high and low tides . There are times when the stream runs low , and when there is nothing to be seen but the dull sandbanks , or even mud - banks , for months , or even years together ; and then all at once the waters swell , and come rushing twice a day like the sea , carrying life and movement with them . Miss Marjoribanks had been subject to the eaux mortes for a long time : but now the spring - tides had rushed back . A day or two after Mr Ashburton had been revealed to her as the predestined member , something occurred , not in itself exciting , but which was not without its ultimate weight upon the course of affairs . It was the day when Aunt Jemima was expected in Grange Lane . She was Aunt Jemima to Lucilla ; but the Doctor called her Mrs John , and was never known to address her by any more familiar title . She was , as she herself described it , a widow lady , and wore the dress of her order , and was the mother of Tom Marjoribanks . She was not a frequent visitor at Carlingford , for she and her brother - in - law had various points on which they were not of accord . The Doctor , for his part , could not but feel perennially injured that the boy had fallen to the lot of Mrs John , while he had only a girl — even though that girl was Lucilla ; and Aunt Jemima could not forgive him for the rude way in which he treated her health , which was so delicate , and his want of sympathy for many other people who were delicate too . Even when she arrived , and was being entertained with the usual cup of tea , fears of her brother - in - law 's robustness and unsympathetic ways had begun to overpower her . "
167032	167063	167030	167030	Lucilla	119	" she said , as she sat in her easy - chair , and took her tea by the fire in the cosy room which had been prepared for her . "
167095	167124	167091	167091	you	3613	" and Mrs John looked with a certain pathos at her niece , as though she saw signs of evil in Lucilla 's fresh complexion and substantial frame . "
167136	167141	167133	167134	Aunt Jemima	230	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
167169	167170	167153	167153	I	0	" "
167180	167191	167153	167153	I	0	" said Aunt Jemima , with a passing gleam of worldly wisdom—"one
167217	167218	167212	167214	Your poor mamma	3616	" "
167233	167238	167229	167229	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
167300	167312	167313	167313	He	117	" said Lucilla , with a slight but not unapparent sigh . "
167323	167329	167313	167313	He	117	" said Tom 's mother ; "
167370	167371	167372	167372	I	0	" "
167386	167396	167379	167379	he	117	" said Lucilla , with a little natural irritation , "
167438	167439	167417	167417	I	0	" "
167445	167452	167417	167417	I	0	" said Aunt Jemima , placidly , "
167488	167539	167540	167540	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks 's bosom swelled when she heard these words — it swelled with that profound sense of being unappreciated and misunderstood , which is one of the hardest trials in the way of genius ; but naturally she was not going to let her aunt see her mortification . "
167553	167561	167584	167584	he	3629	" she said , making a gulp of it—"I
167601	167682	167584	167584	he	3629	" Lucilla added , graciously . She was a little excited about the candidate , as was not unnatural — more excited , perhaps , than she would have been ten years ago , when life was young ; and then it was not to be expected that she could be pleased with Aunt Jemima for thinking it was so fortunate ; though even that touch of wounded pride did not lead Miss Marjoribanks to glorify herself by betraying Tom . "
167696	167701	167692	167694	a dreadful Radical	3633	" said Aunt Jemima ; "
167777	167894	167764	167764	I	0	" added Mrs John , with a little heat — for , to tell the truth , she too felt a slight vexation on her part that the Doctor had the girl — even though not for twenty girls would she have given up Tom . Miss Marjoribanks looked upon the weak woman who thus ventured to address her with indescribable feelings ; but after all she was not so much angry as amused and compassionate . She could not help thinking to herself , if she had been Mrs John 's daughter , how perfectly docile Aunt Jemima would have been by this time , and how little she would have really ventured to interfere . "
167902	167912	167764	167764	I	0	" she said , with a meditative realisation of the possibility—"though
167943	167944	167929	167929	I	0	" "
167953	167958	167929	167929	I	0	" said Mrs John ; "
168045	168046	168047	168049	Dear Aunt Jemima	230	" "
168051	168060	168047	168049	Dear Aunt Jemima	230	" said her affectionate niece , kissing her , "
168086	168103	168062	168062	papa	295	" Mrs John was softened in spite of herself ; but still she shook her head . "
168117	168121	168109	168109	you	3642	" she said , "
168194	168195	168185	168185	he	3111	" "
168204	168590	168180	168180	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; and then the conversation came to a pause , as it was time to dress for dinner . Mrs John Marjoribanks had a very nice room , and everything that was adapted to make her comfortable ; but she too had something to think of when the door closed upon Lucilla , and she was left with her maid and her hot water and her black velvet gown . Perhaps it was a little inconsistent to wear a black velvet gown with her widow 's cap ; it was a question which she had long debated in her mind before she resigned herself to the temptation — but then it always looked so well , and was so very profitable ! and Mrs John felt that it was incumbent upon her to keep up a respectable appearance for Tom 's sake . Tom was very much in her mind at that moment , as indeed he always was ; for though it was a long time ago , she could not get the idea out of her head that he must have said something to Lucilla before he went off to India ; and he had a way of asking about his cousin in his letters ; and though she would have done anything to secure her boy 's happiness , and was on the whole rather fond of her niece , yet the idea of the objections her brother - in - law would have to such a match , excited to the uttermost the smouldering pride which existed in Aunt Jemima 's heart . He was better off , and had always been better off , than her poor John — and he had robust health and an awful scorn of the coddling , to which , as he said , she had subjected his brother ; and he had money enough to keep his child luxuriously , and make her the leader of Carlingford society , while her poor boy had to go to India and put himself in the way of all kinds of unknown diseases and troubles . Mrs John was profoundly anxious to promote her son 's happiness , and would gladly have given every penny she had to get him married to Lucilla , "
168598	168950	168595	168595	he	3655	" as she justly said ; but to have her brother - in - law object to him , and suggest that he was not good enough , was the one thing she could not bear . She was thinking about this , and whether Tom really had not said anything , and whether Lucilla cared for him , and what amid all these perplexities she should do , while she dressed for dinner ; and , at the same time , she felt her palpitation worse than usual , and knew Dr Marjoribanks would smile his grim smile if she complained , so that her visit to Grange Lane , though Lucilla meant to take good care of her , was not altogether unmingled delight to Mrs John . But , nevertheless , Dr Marjoribanks 's dinner - table was always a cheerful sight , even when it was only a dinner - party of three ; for then naturally they used the round table , and were as snug as possible . Lucilla wore her knot of green and violet ribbons on her white dress , to her aunt 's great amazement , and the Doctor had all the air of a man who had been out in the world all day and returned in the evening with something to tell — which is a thing which gives great animation to a family party . Mrs John Marjoribanks had been out of all that sort of thing for a long time . She had been living quite alone in a widowed , forlorn way , and had half forgotten how pleasant it was to have somebody coming in with a breath of fresh air about him and the day 's budget of news — and it had an animating effect upon her , even though she was not fond of her brother - in - law . Dr Marjoribanks inquired about Tom in the most fatherly way , and what he was about , and how things were looking for him , and whether he intended to come home . "
168955	168958	168595	168595	he	3655	" the Doctor said,—"I
168991	168992	168993	168993	Tom	117	" "
169004	169016	168993	168993	Tom	117	" said his mother , with a fine instinct of opposition . "
169060	169061	169053	169053	he	117	" "
169071	169085	169086	169086	Somebody	312	" said the Doctor , and then he gave a rather grim chuckle . "
169137	169138	169134	169134	yours	0	" "
169149	169154	169134	169134	yours	0	" cried Miss Marjoribanks ; "
169193	169219	169220	169220	I	0	" asked Lucilla , though certainly she had a very much better notion of political matters than Aunt Jemima had , to say the least . "
169234	169239	169223	169223	you	0	" said Mrs John ; "
169317	169378	169306	169306	I	0	" said the poor lady . As for the Doctor , he did not accept the challenge thus thrown to him . Tom Marjoribanks was not the foremost figure in the world in his eyes , as the absent wanderer was in that of his mother ; and he had not yet unburdened himself of what he had to say . "
169391	169396	169379	169379	I	0	" said the Doctor . "
169445	169761	169438	169438	you	0	" said Dr Marjoribanks . He had kept back until the things were taken off the table , for he had a benevolent disinclination to spoil anybody 's dinner . Now , when all the serious part of the meal was over , he tossed the Carlingford Gazette across the table , folded so that she could not miss what he wanted her to see . Lucilla took it up lightly between her finger and thumb ; for the Carlingford papers were inky and badly printed , and soiled a lady 's hand . She took it up delicately without either alarm or surprise , knowing very well that the Blues and the Yellows were not likely without a struggle to give up to the new standard , which was violet and green . But what she saw on that inky broadsheet overwhelmed in an instant Miss Marjoribanks 's self - possession . She turned pale , though her complexion was , if possible , fresher than ever , and even shivered in her chair , though her nerves were so steady . Could it be a trick to thwart and startle her ? or could it be true ? She lifted her eyes to her father with a look of horror - stricken inquiry , but all that she met in return was a certain air of amusement and triumph , which struck her at the tenderest point . He was not sorry nor sympathetic , nor did he care at all for the sudden shock she had sustained . On the contrary , he was laughing within himself at the utterly unexpected complication . It was cruel , but it was salutary , and restored her self - command in a moment . She might have given way under kindness , but this look of satisfaction over her discomfiture brought Lucilla to herself . "
169771	169811	169764	169764	I	0	" said Dr Marjoribanks dryly ; and he took his first glass of claret with a slow relish and enjoyment , which roused every sentiment of self - respect and spark of temper existing in his daughter 's mind . "
169853	170189	169851	169851	Lucilla	119	" This was all the feeling he showed for her in her unexpected dilemma . Miss Marjoribanks 's heart gave one throb , which made the green and violet ribbons jump and thrill ; and then she came to herself , and recognised , as she had so often done before , that she had to fight her way by herself , and had nobody to look to . Such a thought is dreary enough sometimes , and there are minds that sink under it ; but at other times it is like the touch of the mother earth which gave the giant back its strength ; and Lucilla was of the latter class of intelligence . When she saw the triumph with which her embarrassment was received and that she had no sympathy nor aid to look for , she recovered herself as if by magic . Let what would come in the way , nothing could alter her certainty that Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford ; and that determination not to be beaten , which is the soul of British valour , sprang up in an instant in Miss Marjoribanks 's mind . There was not even the alternative of victory or Westminster Abbey for Lucilla . If she was ever to hold up her head again , or have any real respect for herself , she must win . All this passed through her head in the one bewildering moment , while her father 's words were still making her ears tingle , and that name , printed in big inky letters , seemed to flutter in all the air round her . It was hard to believe the intelligence thus conveyed , and harder still to go on in the face of old friendships and the traditions of her youth ; but still duty was dearer than tradition , and it was now a necessity to fight the battle to the last , and at all risks to win . "
170204	170208	170196	170196	papa	295	" said Lucilla . "
170336	170369	170326	170326	he	295	" As she spoke , Lucilla turned Aunt Jemima , to whom she had given her arm , quite round , that she might look into the great glass over the mantelpiece : "
170387	170396	170400	170400	he	295	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with candid impartiality ; "
170423	171378	170414	170415	Mr Ashburton	222	" She said the words with a certain solemnity , and turned Mrs John , who was so much surprised as to be speechless , round again , and led her upstairs . It was as if they were walking in a procession of those martyrs and renouncers of self , who build up the foundations of society ; and it would not be too much to say that under her present circumstances , and in the excitement of this singular and unexpected event , such was the painful but sublime consciousness which animated Lucilla 's breast . As for Dr Marjoribanks , his triumph was taken out of him by that spectacle . He closed the door after the ladies had gone , and came back to his easy - chair by the side of the fire , and could not but feel that he had had the worst of it . It was actually Mr Cavendish who had come home , and whose address to the electors of Carlingford , dated from Dover on his return to England , the Doctor had just put into his daughter 's hand . But wonderful and unlooked - for as was the event , Lucilla , though taken unawares , had not given in , nor shown any signs of weakness . And the effect upon her father of her last utterance and confession was such that he took up the paper again and read both addresses , which were printed side by side . In other days Mr Cavendish had been the chosen candidate of Grange Lane ; and the views which he expressed ( and he expressed his views very freely ) were precisely those of Dr Marjoribanks . Yet when the Doctor turned to Mr Ashburton 's expression of his conviction that he was the right man for Carlingford , it can not be denied that the force of that simple statement had a wonderful effect upon his mind — an effect all the greater , perhaps , in comparison with the political exposition made by the other unexpected candidate . The Doctor 's meditations possibly took a slumbrous tone from the place and the moment at which he pursued them ; for the fact was that the words he had just been hearing ran in his head all through the reading of the two addresses . Mr Cavendish would think Lucilla had gone off ; but yet she had not gone off so much as might have been expected , and Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford . Dr Marjoribanks laughed quietly by himself in his easy - chair , and then went back to Mr Cavendish 's opinions ; and ended again , without knowing it , in a kind of odd incipient agreement with Lucilla . The new candidate was right in politics ; but , after all , Mr Ashburton was a more satisfactory sort of person . He was a man whom people knew everything about , and a descendant of old Penrhyn , and had the Firs , and lived in it , and spent about so much money every year honestly in the face of the world . When a man conducts himself in this way , his neighbours can afford to be less exacting as to his political opinions . This comparison went on in the Doctor 's thoughts until the distinction between the two grew confused and faint in that ruddy and genial glow of firelight and lamplight and personal well - being which is apt to engross a man 's mind after he has come in out of the air , as people say , and has eaten a good dinner , and feels himself comfortable ; and at last all that remained in Dr Marjoribanks 's mind was that Mr Cavendish would think Lucilla had gone off , though she had not gone off nearly so much as might have been expected ; at which he laughed with an odd sound , which roused him , and might have induced some people to think he had been sleeping — if , indeed , anybody had been near to hear . But this news was naturally much more serious to Miss Marjoribanks when she got upstairs , and had time to think of it . She would not have been human if she had heard without emotion of the return of the man whom she had once dreamed of as member for Carlingford , with the addition of other dreams which had not been altogether without their sweetness . He had returned now and then for a few days , but Lucilla knew that he had never held up his head in Grange Lane since the day when she advised him to marry Barbara Lake . And now when he had bethought himself of his old ambition , had he possibly bethought himself of other hopes as well ? And the horrible thing was , that she had pledged herself to another , and put her seal upon it that Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford ! It may be supposed that , with such a complication in her mind , Miss Marjoribanks was very little capable of supporting Aunt Jemima 's questions as to what it was about , and who was Mr Cavendish , and why was his return of consequence to Lucilla ? Mrs John was considerably alarmed and startled , and began to think in earnest that Tom was fond of his cousin , and would never forgive his mother for letting Lucilla perhaps marry some one else , and settle down before her very eyes . "
171392	171426	171387	171387	I	0	" Mrs John said , with a little asperity ; but that was after she had made a great many attempts , which were only partially successful , to find it all out . "
171431	171435	171387	171387	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
171479	171506	171472	171472	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks said , with a sigh ; and it may be supposed that Mrs John 's curiosity was not lessened by such a response . "
171529	171539	171522	171522	I	0	" said Tom 's mother , with natural indignation . "

171590	171595	171579	171581	My dear aunt	3694	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "

171620	171648	171613	171613	Tom	117	" said Mrs John impetuously ; and then she blushed , though she was past the age of blushing , and made haste to cover her imprudence . "
171663	171674	171676	171676	I	0	" she said , with suspicion , but some justice ; "

171740	171769	171770	171770	papa	295	" Miss Marjoribanks added ; and then , in spite of herself , a sigh of doubt and anxiety escaped her bosom . It was easy to say that "
171782	172524	171774	171775	Mr Ashburton	222	" but nobody had known that Mr Cavendish was coming to drive everything topsy - turvy ; and Lucilla , though she professed to know only who was the man for Carlingford , had at the same time sufficient political information to be aware that the sentiments propounded in Mr Cavendish 's address were also Dr Marjoribanks 's sentiments ; and she did not know the tricks which some green - and - violet spirit in the dining - room was playing with the Doctor 's fancy . Perhaps it might turn out to be Mr Cavendish 's committee which her father would be on ; and after she had pledged herself that the other man was the man for Carlingford ! Lucilla felt that she could not be disloyal and go back from her word , neither could she forget the intimation which had so plainly indicated to her that Mr Ashburton was the man ; and yet , at the same time , she could not but sigh as she thought of Mr Cavendish . Perhaps he had grown coarse , as men do at that age , just as Lucilla herself was conscious that he would find her stouter . Perhaps he had ceased to flirt , or be of any particular use of an evening ; possibly even he might have forgotten Miss Marjoribanks — but naturally that was a thing that seemed unlikely to Lucilla . And oh ! if he had but come a little earlier , or for ever stayed away ! But while all these thoughts were going through her mind , her fingers were still busy with the violet - and - green cockades which Aunt Jemima , after making sure that Mr Ashburton was not a Radical , had begun to help her with . And they sat and talked about Mrs John 's breathing , which was so bad , and about her headaches , while Lucilla by snatches discussed the situation in her mind . Perhaps , on the whole , embarrassment and perplexity are a kind of natural accompaniment to life and movement ; and it is better to be driven out of your senses with thinking which of two things you ought to do than to do nothing whatever , and be utterly uninteresting to all the world . This at least was how Lucilla reasoned to herself in her dilemma ; and while she reasoned she used up yard upon yard of her green ribbon ( for naturally the violet bore but a small proportion to the green ) . Whatever she might have to do or to suffer — however her thoughts might be disturbed or her heart distracted — it is unnecessary to add that it was impossible to Lucilla either to betray or to yield . It was a very good thing for Lucilla that Mrs John was so much of an invalid , notwithstanding that the Doctor made little of her complaints . All that Dr Marjoribanks said was — with that remnant of Scotch which was often perceptible in his speech — that her illnesses were a fine thing to occupy her , and he did not know what she would do without them — a manner of speaking which naturally lessened his daughter 's anxiety , though her sympathetic care and solicitude were undiminished . And no doubt , when she had been once assured that there was nothing dangerous in her aunt 's case , it was a relief to Miss Marjoribanks at the present juncture that Mrs John got up late and always breakfasted in her own room . Lucilla went into that sanctuary after she had given her father his breakfast , and heard all about the palpitation and the bad night Aunt Jemima had passed ; and then when she had consoled her suffering relative by the reflection that one never sleeps well the first night or two , Miss Marjoribanks was at liberty to go forth and attend a little to her own affairs , which stood so much in need of being attended to . She had had no further talk with the Doctor on the subject , but she had read over Mr Cavendish 's address , and could not help seeing that it went dead against her candidate ; neither could Lucilla remain altogether unaffected by the expression of feeling in respect to "
172547	173113	173114	173114	He	3700	" and the touching haste with which the exile had rushed back as soon as he heard of the old member 's death . If it touched Miss Marjoribanks , who was already pledged to support another interest , what might it not do to the gentlemen in Grange Lane who were not pledged , and who had a friendship for Mr Cavendish ? This was the alarming thought that had disturbed her sleep all night , and returned to her mind with her first awakening ; and when she had really her time to herself , and the fresh morning hours before her , Lucilla began , as everybody ought to do , by going to the very root and foundation , and asking herself what , beyond all secondary considerations , it was right to do . To change from one side to the other and go back from her word was a thing abhorrent to her ; but still Miss Marjoribanks was aware that there are certain circumstances in which honesty and truth themselves demand what in most cases is considered an untruthful and dishonest proceeding . Thus in order to come to a right decision , and with a sense of the duty she owed to her country which would have shamed half the electors in England , not to say Carlingford , Lucilla , who naturally had no vote , read the two addresses of the two candidates , and addressed herself candidly and impartially to the rights of the subject . Mr Cavendish was disposed , as we have said , to be pathetic and sentimental , and to speak of the claims the borough had upon his affections , and the eagerness with which he had rushed home at the earliest possible moment to present himself to them . If poor old Mr Chiltern had been King Bomba , or a gloomy Oriental tyrant , keeping all possible reformers and successors banished from his dominions , the new candidate could not have spoken with more pathos . It was a sort of thing which tells among the imaginative part of the community , or so , at least , most people think ; and Miss Marjoribanks was moved by it for the first moment ; but then her enlightened mind asserted its rights . She said to herself that Mr Cavendish might have come home at any hour , by any steamboat ; that Calais and Boulogne , and even Dieppe , were as open to him as if he had been an actual refugee , and that consequently there was nothing particular to be pathetic about . And then , if the town had such claims on his affections , why had he stayed so long away ? These two rationalistic questions dispersed the first attendrissement which had begun to steal over Lucilla 's mind . When she came to this conclusion , her difficulties cleared away . She had no reason to go back from her engagements and reject that intimation which had so impressed it on her , that Mr Ashburton was the man . It was a sacrifice which ancient truth and friendship did not demand , for verity was not in the document she had just been reading , and that appeal to sentiment was nothing more than what is generally called humbug . "
173124	173130	173457	173457	she	3704	" Lucilla said to herself ; "
173163	173453	173457	173457	she	3704	" When this view of the subject occurred to her , Lucilla felt more indignation than sympathy . And then , as Dr Marjoribanks had done , she turned to the calm utterance of her own candidate — the man who was the only man for Carlingford — and that sweet sense of having given sound counsel , and of having at last met with some one capable of carrying it out , which makes up for so many failures , came like balm to Lucilla 's bosom . There was nothing more necessary ; the commotion in her mind calmed down , and the tranquillity of undisturbed conviction came in its place . And it was with this sense of certainty that she put on her bonnet and issued forth , though it snowed a little , and was a very wintry day , on Mr Ashburton 's behalf , to try her fortune in Grange Lane . She went to Mrs Chiley 's , who was now very old , poor old lady ! and feeble , and did not like to leave her sofa . Not but what she could leave the sofa , she said to her friends , but at that time of the year , and at her time of life , it was comfortable . The sofa was wheeled to the side of the fire , and Mrs Chiley reclined upon it , covered with knitted rugs of the brightest colours , which her young friends all worked for her . The last one arrived was what used to be called an Afghanistan blanket , done in stripes of all sorts of pretty tints , which was a present from Mrs Beverley . "
173462	173468	173457	173457	she	3704	" said the old lady ; "
173494	173632	173486	173489	the Archdeacon 's nieces	3707	" But still it had the place of honour at present , covering Mrs Chiley 's feet , and affording something to talk about when any one came in . And by her side was a little table , upon which stood one China rose , in a glass of water — a pale rose , almost as pale as her soft old cheeks , and chilled like them by the approaching frost . And the fire burned with an officious cheerfulness at her elbow , as if it thought nothing of such accidental circumstances as winter and old age . To be sure this was a reflection which never came into Mrs Chiley 's head , who was , on the contrary , very thankful for the fire , and said it was like a companion . "
173670	173773	173657	173657	they	6413	" the kind old lady would say . She did say so now when Lucilla came in , glowing with cold and her rapid walk , and with a flake or two of snow slowly melting on her sealskin cloak . Perhaps it was not a sentiment the Colonel agreed with , for he gave a humph and a little hoist of his shoulders , as if in protest , being himself a good deal limited in his movements , and not liking to own it , by the wintry torpor within his big old frame , and the wintry weather outside . "
173787	173815	173782	173782	Lucilla	119	" Mrs Chiley said , as she drew down her young friend 's glowing face to her own , and gave her one of her lingering kisses ; "
173864	173865	173881	173881	you	119	" "
173873	173878	173867	173867	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
173906	173936	173899	173899	I	0	" And then Mrs Chiley 's countenance fell . She was not very strong , poor old lady , and she could have cried , as she said afterwards . "
173948	173957	173941	173941	I	0	" she said , after a little pause ; "
174044	174045	174034	174034	I	0	" "
174056	174060	174046	174046	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
174105	174121	174122	174122	I	0	" Upon which the Colonel himself drew a little nearer , and poked the fire . "
174134	174138	174127	174127	you	119	" he said . "
174206	174333	174187	174187	he	115	" Colonel Chiley added , smashing a great piece of coal with the poker , with a blow full of energy , yet showing a slight unsteadiness in it , which sent a host of blazing splinters into the hearth . He was a man who wore very well , but he was not so steady as he once was , and nowadays was apt , by some tremulous movement , to neutralise the strength which he had left . Mrs Chiley , for her part , was apt to be made very nervous by her husband 's proceedings . She was possessed by a terror that the splinters some day would jump out of the hearth on to the carpet and fly into the corners , "
174344	174367	174368	174368	He	115	" as she said . She gave a little start among her cushions , and stooped down to look over the floor . "
174377	174427	174373	174373	he	115	" she said in Lucilla 's ear , who instantly came to her side to see what she wanted ; and thus the two old people kept watch upon each other , and noted , with a curious mixture of vexation and sympathy , each other 's declining strength . "
174446	174451	174432	174432	I	0	" said Mrs Chiley , "
174486	174487	174467	174467	Lucilla	119	" "
174490	174512	174473	174473	him	115	" said Miss Marjoribanks — but she spoke with a gravity and hesitation which did not fail to reach Mrs Chiley 's ear—"I
174541	174733	174531	174532	Mr Ashburton	222	" she said slowly . She said it with reluctance , for she knew it would shock her audience , but , at the same time , she did not shrink from her duty ; and the moment had now arrived when Lucilla felt concealment was impossible , and that the truth must be said . As for Mrs Chiley , she was so distressed that the tears came to her eyes ; and even the Colonel laughed , and did not understand it . Colonel Chiley , though he was by no means as yet on Mr Cavendish 's side , was not any more capable than his neighbours of understanding Miss Marjoribanks 's single - minded devotion to what was just and right ; and why she should transfer her support to Ashburton , who was not a ladies ' man , nor , in the Colonel 's opinion , a marrying man , nor anything at all attractive , now that the other had come back romantic and repentant to throw his honours at her feet , was beyond his power of explanation . He contented himself with saying "
174735	174762	174763	174763	I	0	" ; but his wife was not so easily satisfied . She took Lucilla by the hand and poured forth a flood of remonstrances and prayers . "
174771	174776	174777	174777	He	3735	" said Mrs Chiley . "
174912	174913	174901	174901	you	3734	" "
174921	174928	174901	174901	you	3734	" said Lucilla , with solemnity . "
175061	175113	175118	175118	him	222	" Lucilla spoke with great gravity , but she did not impress her audience , who were people of sceptical minds . Mrs Chiley , for her part , was almost angry , and could scarcely forgive Lucilla for having made her give grave attention to such a piece of nonsense . "
175120	175128	175118	175118	him	222	" she said , with some wrath , "
175181	175227	175175	175175	you	3742	" the old lady said severely . And Colonel Chiley , who had been a little curious too , laughed and coughed over the joke ; for the two old people were of the old school , and of a very unbelieving frame of mind . "
175234	175239	175230	175230	you	3742	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
175286	175290	175277	175277	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
175351	175410	175343	175343	nobody	4434	" There followed a pause upon this declaration ; for Miss Marjoribanks , though she had no vote , was a person of undoubted influence , and such a conviction on her part was not to be laughed at . Even Colonel Chiley , who was undecided in his own mind , was moved by it a little . "
175417	175421	175413	175414	the Doctor	326	" he asked . "
175444	175445	175440	175440	you	3747	" "
175450	175454	175440	175440	you	3747	" cried Lucilla , "
175536	175569	175530	175530	I	0	" Lucilla added , with humility . As for the Colonel , he took up the poker , perhaps to hide a little pleasant confusion , and again drew near the fire . "
175581	175665	175573	175573	I	0	" he said , with a certain agreeable consciousness . Perhaps he did not quite recollect at what moment of his life he had originated that sentiment , but he thought he could recollect having said it ; and it was with the view of carrying off the bashfulness of genius , and not because the coals had any need of it , that he took up the poker — a proceeding which was always regarded with alarm and suspicion by his wife . "
175672	175677	175678	175678	I	0	" said Mrs Chiley . "
175756	175757	175758	175758	I	0	" "
175765	175769	175758	175758	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
175836	175837	175830	175830	nobody	4434	" "
175848	175853	175854	175854	I	0	" cried Mrs Chiley . "
175912	175913	175909	175909	Lucilla	119	" "
175918	175923	175909	175909	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
175989	176053	176055	176055	you	119	" When Lucilla had thus dismissed the subject , she came to her old friend 's side and bent over her in her sealskin cloak , to say good - bye . Mrs Chiley took her by both hands as she thus stood with her back to the old Colonel , and drew her down close , and looked searchingly into her eyes . "
176076	176082	176063	176063	you	119	" said the old lady . "
176089	176222	176083	176083	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with evasive fondness , as she kissed the soft old withered cheek ; and naturally , with the Colonel behind , who was standing up before the fire shadowing over them both , and quite unaware of this little whispered episode , it would have been impossible to say more had there been ever so much to say . But it had been a close encounter in its way , and Lucilla was rather glad to get off without any further damage . She did not feel quite successful as she went out ; but still she had left a very wholesome commotion behind her ; for Colonel Chiley could not but feel that the sentiment which she had quoted from himself was a very just sentiment . "
176234	177235	176226	176226	Lucilla	119	" he said again , after she was gone ; and in fact went through a process very similar to that which had modified the sentiments of Dr Marjoribanks on the previous night . Mr Cavendish was a young fellow who had rushed off among a set of Frenchmen , because Lucilla Marjoribanks would not have him , or because he could not marry Barbara Lake in addition , or at least somehow because he failed of having his own way . It was all very well for him to come back and make a commotion , and be sentimental about it . But what if , after all , Ashburton , who had the Firs , and lived there , and spent his money like a Christian , was the man for Carlingford ? The Colonel 's mind still wavered and veered about ; yet it had received an impulse which was by no means unworthy of consideration . As for Mrs Chiley , she laid back her head upon her pillows and painfully questioned with herself whether Lucilla could have any particular reason for taking Mr Ashburton 's part so warmly . She thought with justice that Miss Marjoribanks was looking brighter and better , and had more of her old animation than she had shown for a long time — which arose from the simple fact that she had something in hand , though the old lady thought it might have a more touching and delicate motive . If that was the case , it would make a great difference . Mrs Chiley was no longer able to go out in the evening , and had to be dependent on other people 's observation for a knowledge of what happened — and she was wounded by a sense that her young friend had not been appreciated as her worth deserved . If Mr Ashburton had the sense to see what was for his own advantage , it would be a frightful thing , as Mrs Chiley said to herself , if Lucilla 's friends should fly in his face . And though it was a hard trial to give up Mr Cavendish , still if anything of the kind had happened —— Thus it will be evident that Lucilla 's visit , though it was not a long one , nor the least in the world an argumentative visit , was not without its fruit . She went up Grange Lane again cheerful and warm in her sealskin coat . It was a thing that suited her remarkably well , and corresponded with her character , and everybody knows how comfortable they are . The snowflakes fell softly , one at a time , and melted away to nothing upon her sleeves and her shoulders without leaving any trace — and Lucilla , with the chill air blowing in her face , and those feathery messengers in the air , could not but feel that her walk and the general readiness which she felt to face all kinds of objections and difficulties , and to make a sacrifice of her own feelings , had in them a certain magnanimous and heroic element . For after all she had no particular reason , as Mrs Chiley said . Mr Ashburton was a dry man , and of very little use in a social point of view , and had never paid her any attention to speak of , nor at all put himself forth as a candidate for her favour . If he had done so , she would not have felt that thrill of utter disinterestedness which kept her as warm within as her sealskin did without . There was not a soul to be seen in Grange Lane at that moment in the snow , which came on faster and faster , but one of Mr Wentworth 's ( who at that time was new in St Roque 's ) gray sisters , and another lady who was coming down , as quickly as Lucilla was going up , by the long line of garden walls . The gentlemen were either at business or at their club , or keeping themselves snug indoors ; and it was only these devoted women who braved the elements outside . The figure in the gray cloak was occupied simply with the poor people , and that is not our present business ; but the other two were otherwise inspired . Mr Cavendish , who had lately arrived , had not been able to make up his mind to face the weather ; but his sister was of a different way of thinking . She was not of half the capacity of Lucilla , but still she felt that something ought to be done , and that there was not a moment to be lost . When she saw it was Miss Marjoribanks that was advancing to meet her , a momentary chill came over Mrs Woodburn . She was thinking so much of her own errand that she could not but jump at the idea that nothing less important could have induced Lucilla to be out of doors on such a day ; and her heart beat loud as the two drew near each other . Was it an unexpected and generous auxiliary , or was it a foe accomplished and formidable ? For one thing , she was not coming out of Mr Centum 's , where Mrs Woodburn herself was going , which at least was a relief . As they came nearer the two ladies instinctively looked to their weapons . They had met already in many a little passage of arms , but nothing like this had ever occurred to them before . If they were to work in union , Mrs Woodburn felt that they would carry all before them ; and if not , then it must be a struggle unto the death . "
177243	177247	177239	177239	you	3762	" she said ; "
177284	177285	177286	177286	I	0	" "
177294	177299	177291	177292	Mrs Chiley	96	" said Lucilla sweetly ; "
177340	177341	177342	177342	You	3762	" "
177350	177370	177342	177342	You	3762	" said Mrs Woodburn , who was a little nervous , though perhaps that might only be the cold ; "
177429	177430	177424	177424	Harry	165	" "
177438	177456	177431	177431	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , whose perfect serenity offered a curious contrast to her companion 's agitation . "
177498	177499	177520	177520	you	119	" "
177502	177507	177520	177520	you	119	" said Mrs Woodburn ; "
177558	177592	177548	177548	I	0	" said the poor woman , faltering ; for Lucilla listened with a smile that was quite unresponsive , and did not change countenance in the least , even at this tender suggestion . "
177626	177701	177617	177617	you	119	" said Mrs Woodburn . Her voice quite vibrated with agitation as she made this hurried , perhaps injudicious , appeal , thinking within herself at the same moment what would Harry say if he knew that she was thus committing him . As for Lucilla , she received it all with the same tranquillity , as if she expected it , and was quite prepared for everything that her assailant had to say . "
177712	177716	177707	177707	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
177766	177767	177768	177768	You	3774	" "
177782	177787	177768	177768	You	3774	" said Mrs Woodburn ; "
177849	178050	177844	177844	he	165	" said the eager advocate . She was only wrapped in a shawl herself , and when she looked at Lucilla 's sealskin coat , and saw how rosy and comfortable she looked , and how serene and immovable , poor Mrs Woodburn was struck with a pang of envy . If Miss Marjoribanks had married ten years ago , it might have been she now who would have had to stand trembling with anxiety and eagerness among the falling snow , knowing sundry reasons why Mr Cavendish should be disposed to go into Parliament more substantial than that of gratifying a young lady , and feeling how much depended on her ability to secure support for him . This , as it happened , had fallen to his sister 's share instead , and Lucilla stood opposite to her looking at her , attentive and polite , and unresponsive . If Harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago ! for Mrs Woodburn began to think now with Aunt Jemima , that Lucilla did not marry because she was too comfortable , and , without any of the bother , could have everything her own way . "
178056	178061	178063	178063	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "

178122	178127	178116	178116	I	0	" said Mrs Woodburn , "
178194	178213	178178	178178	you	3782	" the mimic added , with a feeble exercise of her gift which it was sad to see . "
178244	178273	178236	178236	I	0	" and with this Mrs Woodburn took her young friend 's hand and looked in her face with a pathetic emphasis which it would be impossible to describe . "
178281	178784	178236	178236	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with cheerful certainty ; and then they kissed each other in the midst of the falling snow . Mrs Woodburn 's face was cold , but Lucilla 's cheek was warm and blooming as only a clear conscience and a sealskin cloak could have made it ; and then they went their several ways through the wintry solitude . Ah , if Harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago ! Mrs Woodburn was not an enthusiastic young wife , but knew very well that marriage had its drawbacks , and had come to an age at which she could appreciate the comfort of having her own way without any of the bother . She gave a furtive glance after Lucilla , and could not but acknowledge to herself that it would be very foolish of Miss Marjoribanks to marry , and forfeit all her advantages , and take somebody else 's anxieties upon her shoulders , and never have any money except what she asked from her husband . Mrs Chiley , to be sure , who was more experienced than Mrs Woodburn , and might have been her grandmother , took a different view of the subject ; but this was what the middle - aged married woman felt , who had , as may be said , two men to carry on her shoulders , as she went anxiously down Grange Lane to conciliate Mrs Centum , wrapping her shawl about her , and feeling the light snow melt beneath her feet , and the cold and discomfort go to her heart . She had her husband to keep in good humour , and her brother to keep up and keep to the mark , and to do what she could to remedy in public the effects of his indolent Continental habits , and carry , if it was possible , the election for him — all with the horrid sense upon her mind that if at any time the dinner should be a little less cared for than usual , or the children more noisy , Woodburn would go on like a savage . Under such circumstances , the poor woman , amid her cares , may be excused if she looked back a little wistfully at Lucilla going home all comfortable and independent and light - hearted , with no cares , nor anybody to go on at her , in her sealskin coat . This was how Lucilla commenced that effective but decorous advocacy which did Mr Ashburton so much good in Carlingford . She did not pretend to understand about politics , or to care particularly about Reform or the Income - tax ; but she expressed with quiet solemnity her conviction that it was not opinions but a good man that was wanted ; that it was not a prime minister they were going to elect , and that Mr Ashburton was the man for Carlingford . "
178796	178801	178788	178788	Lucilla	119	" Colonel Chiley said ; "
178808	178842	178788	178788	Lucilla	119	" and the people in Grange Lane soon began to echo the Colonel 's sentiments , which were so sound and so just . As for Miss Marjoribanks , nobody had any occasion to "
178845	178948	178788	178788	Lucilla	119	" about any neglect on her part of her household duties . Dr Marjoribanks 's dinners were always excellent , and it was now , as ever , a privilege to be admitted to his table ; and nothing could be more exemplary than the care Lucilla took of Aunt Jemima , who had always such bad nights . Even on this snowy afternoon she went in from her more important cares , with a complexion freshened by the cold , and coaxed Mrs John into eating something , and made her as comfortable as possible at the drawing - room fireside . "
178957	179555	178955	178955	Tom	117	" Lucilla said , when she had got her work and settled herself comfortably for a quiet afternoon — for the snow had come on heavier than ever , and unless it might be a sister of charity , or such another sister not of charity , as Lucilla had already encountered , nobody was like to stir abroad or to disturb the two ladies in their work and their talk . Lucilla had some very interesting worsted - work in hand ; and the drawing - room never looked more cosy , with somebody to talk to inside , and the wintry world and driving snow without . And such an invitation as Miss Marjoribanks had just given lifted Aunt Jemima into a paradise of content . She took Lucilla at her word , and told her , as may be supposed , all about Tom , including many things which she was quite acquainted with and knew by heart ; and at the same time there was something implied all through , but never obtrusively set forth , which was not displeasing to the auditor . Miss Marjoribanks listened with affectionate satisfaction , and asked a great many questions , and supplied a great many reminiscences , and entered quite into the spirit of the conversation , and the two spent a very pleasant afternoon together,—so pleasant that Mrs John felt quite annoyed at the reflection that it must come to an end like everything else that is good , and that she must get herself once more into her velvet gown and dine with her brother - in - law . If Providence had only given her the girl instead of the Doctor , who would no doubt have got on quite well without any children ! but then , to be sure , if Lucilla had been hers to start with , she never could have married Tom . For this was the extravagant hope which had already begun to blossom in his mother 's breast . To be sure a woman might marry Tom , who was too comfortable at home to think of marrying just anybody who might make her an offer . But it was not easy to tell how Lucilla herself felt on this subject . Her complexion was so bright with her walk , her sensations so agreeable after that warm , cheerful , pleasant afternoon , her position so entirely everything that was to be desired , and her mind so nobly conscious of being useful to her kind and country , that , even without any additional argument , Miss Marjoribanks had her reward , and was happy . Perhaps a touch more exquisite might still come in to round the full proportions of content . But , to tell the truth , Lucilla was so well off that it was not necessary to invent any romantic source of happiness to account for the light of well - being and satisfaction that shone in her eyes . The result of Miss Marjoribanks 's wise precaution and reticence was that Sir John Richmond and the Doctor and Colonel Chiley were all on Mr Ashburton 's committee . They might not agree with his principles ; but then when a man does not state any very distinct principles , it is difficult for any one , however well disposed , to disagree with him ; and the fact that he was the man for Carlingford was so indisputable , that nobody attempted to go into the minor matters . "
179566	179790	179791	179791	he	3788	" Sir John said , with great effect , in his nomination speech ; and it was a sentence which went to the hearts of his audience . The other candidate had been a long time from home , and it was longer still since anybody in Carlingford could be said to have benefited by his residence there . He had had all his things down from town , as Mr Holden , the upholsterer , pithily remarked — and that made a great difference to start with . As for Mr Ashburton , though it is true nobody knew what he thought about Reform or the Income - tax , everybody knew that he lived at the Firs , and was supplied in a creditable way by George Street tradesmen . There was no mystery whatever about him . People knew how much he had a year , and how much he paid for everything , and the way in which his accounts were kept , and all about him . Even when he had his wine direct from the growers ( for naturally his own county could not supply the actual liquor ) , it was put in Carlingford bottles , and people knew the kinds he had , and how much , and a hundred agreeable details . And then , "
179804	180259	179791	179791	he	3788	" as some of the people said . All this furnished an immense body of evidence in his favour , and made Sir John 's remark eloquent . And then Carlingford , as a general rule , did not care the least in the world about Reform . There were a few people who had once done so , and it was remarked in Grove Street that Mr Tozer had once been in a dreadful state of mind about it . But he was quite tranquil on the subject now , and so was the community in general . And what was really wanted , as Lucilla 's genius had seen at a glance , was not this or that opinion , but a good man . But at the same time it would be vain to deny that Miss Marjoribanks looked forward to a possible visit from Mr Cavendish with a certain amount of anxiety . She was not frightened , for she knew her own powers ; but she was a little excited and stimulated by the idea that he might come in at any minute , bringing back a crowd of recollections with him ; and it was a perpetual wonder to her how he would take the inevitable difference , whether he would accept it as natural , or put on the airs of an injured man . Lucilla did not go out the two afternoons after her meeting with Mrs Woodburn , partly that she might not miss him if he called — for it was better to have it over ; but Mr Cavendish did not come on either of these days . After that , of course , she did not wait for him any longer . But on the third or fourth day , when she was in Miss Brown 's photographing room ( the eldest Miss Brown was not married , and was a mother to the younger girls , and always enthusiastic about sitters ) , Mr Ashburton called about business , and Thomas came to fetch Miss Marjoribanks . She was sitting with the greatest good - nature for half a dozen pictures , knowing in her secret heart all the time that she would look a perfect fright , and that all Carlingford would see her grinning with imbecile amiability out of the hazy background of Miss Brown 's cartes . Lucilla knew this , and had hitherto avoided the process with success ; but now she gave in ; and as the Major was there , of course they talked of the coming election , which , indeed , at present was almost the only topic of conversation in Grange Lane . "
180271	180275	180276	180276	you	3790	" said Lucilla ; "
180296	180297	180287	180287	you	3790	" "
180303	180391	180300	180300	I	0	" asked Major Brown , with an air of dismay ; for , to tell the truth , his heart inclined a little towards poor Mr Cavendish , who was an old neighbour , and to whom Major Brown could not but think the Marjoribanks and others had behaved rather cruelly . But then in these electioneering matters one never knows what one may have done to compromise oneself without meaning it ; and the Major was a little anxious to find out what he had said . "
180396	180402	180392	180394	Dear Major Brown	241	" said Lucilla , seriously , "
180489	180500	180468	180468	you	3792	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with sad yet gentle reproachfulness . "
180515	180516	180506	180506	you	241	" "
180530	180535	180536	180536	I	0	" said Major Brown . "
180591	180592	180580	180580	you	3792	" "
180601	180606	180580	180580	you	3792	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
180646	180647	180639	180639	you	3792	" "
180658	180786	180653	180653	I	0	" cried the accused , with dismay . And he grew quite inarticulate in his confusion , and red in the face , and lost his head altogether , while Lucilla sat calmly looking on with that air of virtue at once severe and indulgent , which pities , and blames , and hopes that perhaps there is not so much harm done as might have been expected . This was the position of affairs when Thomas came to say that Miss Marjoribanks was wanted , as she had told him to do when her candidate came ; for , to be sure , it was only next door . It was terrible to hear the soft sigh she gave when she shook hands with Major Brown . "
180809	180851	180801	180801	I	0	" said Lucilla ; and she went away , leaving the good man in a state of bewilderment and embarrassment and doubt , which would have been much more unpleasant if he had not felt so flattered at the same time . "
180863	180881	180882	180882	I	0	" he said , with a comical mixture of complacence and dismay , when Lucilla was gone . "
180904	181266	180887	180887	papa	295	" Miss Brown replied , as she gave the final bath to her negatives ; and they both left off work with a certain glow of comforted amour propre , and the most benevolent sentiments towards Mr Ashburton , who , to tell the truth , until he got his lesson from Miss Marjoribanks , had never once thought about the opinion of Major Brown . He was sitting with Aunt Jemima when Lucilla came in , and talking to her in a steady sort of a way . Nothing could have made Mr Ashburton socially attractive , but still there are many people to whom this steady sort of talk is more agreeable than brilliancy . When a man is brilliant there is always a doubt in some minds whether he is trustworthy , or sincere , or to be relied upon ; but an ordinary commonsense sort of talker is free from such suspicion . Mr Ashburton was very sorry to hear that Mrs John Marjoribanks had bad nights , and suggested that it might be nervousness , and hoped that the air of Carlingford would do her good , and was very glad to hear that her son was getting on so well in India ; and Aunt Jemima could not help approving of him , and feeling that he was a person of substance and reflection , and not one of those fly - away young men who turn girls ' heads , and never mean anything . Lucilla herself gained something in Mrs John 's eyes from Mr Ashburton 's high opinion ; but at the same time it was quite clear that he was not thinking of anything sentimental , but was quite occupied about his election , as a man of sense should be . Lucilla came in with a fine bloom on her cheeks , but still with a shade of that sadness which had had so great an effect upon Major Brown . She had taken off her hat before she came in , and dropped into her chair with an air of languor and fatigue which was quite unusual to her . "
181283	181329	181330	181330	You	3804	" said Lucilla , and she sighed , as was but natural ; for though that did not affect the energy of her proceedings , she knew and remembered at moments of discouragement how seldom one 's most disinterested exertions are appreciated at the end . "
181338	181343	181330	181330	You	3804	" said Mrs John . "
181348	181359	181345	181345	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a mournful affectionate smile . "
181433	181437	181426	181426	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
181449	181450	181451	181452	These amateurs	3812	" "
181457	181467	181454	181455	terrible people	3813	" said Mr Ashburton , in his steady way ; "
181480	181481	181476	181476	my	0	" "
181487	181492	181493	181493	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
181548	181945	181543	181543	I	0	" said Lucilla . She was lying back negligently in her seat , with that air of languor which so many young ladies excel in , but which was for her a novel indulgence . Her hand hung over the arm of her chair as if there was no longer any force in it . Her head fell back , her eyes were half closed ; it was a moment of abandonment to her sensations , such as a high - principled young woman like Miss Marjoribanks seldom gives way to . But Lucilla went into it conscientiously , as into everything she did , that she might regain her strength for the necessary duties that were before her . And it was at this moment that Thomas appeared at the door with a suspicion of a grin appearing at the corners of his sober mouth , and announced Mr Cavendish , who came in before an ordinary woman would have had time to open her eyes . This was the moment he had chosen for his first visit ; and yet it was not he who had chosen it , but fate , who seemed to have in this respect a spite against Lucilla . It was not only the embarrassing presence of his rival , but the fact that neither of the two people in the room knew or had ever seen Mr Cavendish , that put a climax to the horror of the situation . She alone knew him , and had to take upon herself to present and introduce him , and bridge over for him the long interval of absence , and all this with the sense of being in the enemy 's interest , and to a certain extent false to Mr Cavendish ! Lucilla rose at once , but she was not a woman to make pretences . She did not throw off all in a moment her fatigue , and dash into spasmodic action . She held out her hand silently to Mr Cavendish , with a look which spoke only affectionate satisfaction in a friend 's return . She did not even speak at all for the first moment , but contented herself with a look , which indeed , if he had been younger and less preoccupied , would no doubt have touched his very heart . "
181953	181957	181947	181947	you	3816	" she said . "
182019	182020	182011	182011	you	3816	" "
182028	182188	182021	182021	I	0	" said Mr Cavendish ; but he was considerably embarrassed , and he was a great deal stouter , and altogether different from what he used to be , and he had not the light hand of his youth for a compliment . And then he sat down on the chair Thomas had given him ; and he looked uncomfortable , to say the least of it ; and he was getting large in dimensions and a little red in the face , and had by no means the air of thinking that it did n't matter for a gentleman . As for Miss Marjoribanks , it would be impossible to say what mists of illusion dropped away from her mind at the sight of him . Even while she smiled upon the new - comer , she could not but ask herself , with momentary dismay — Had she really gone off as much in the same time ? "
182196	182201	182189	182189	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks resumed ; "
182294	182355	182263	182264	each other	679	" But the two candidates did not shake hands : they bowed to each other in an alarming way , which did not promise much for their future brotherliness , and then they both stood bolt upright and stared at Miss Marjoribanks , who had relapsed , in the pleasantest way in the world , into her easy - chair . "
182366	182370	182263	182264	each other	679	" said Lucilla ; "
182431	182477	182478	182478	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , turning a reflective glance upon her own candidate with a certain sadness ; and then they both laughed as if it was a joke ; but it was no joke , as one of them at least must have known . "
182480	182488	182478	182478	Lucilla	119	" said Mrs John , with consternation , "
182517	182518	182513	182514	Mr Cavendish	115	" "
182523	182527	182529	182529	you	230	" said Lucilla , "
182582	182583	182578	182578	you	230	" "
182604	182609	182586	182586	you	230	" said Mr Cavendish ; "
182624	182664	182612	182612	I	0	" This was said with a slight touch of gentlemanly spite , if there is such a thing ; for , after all , he was an old power in Carlingford , though he had been so long away . "
182667	182672	182612	182612	I	0	" said Lucilla reflectively , "
182695	182696	182730	182731	that fellow	3829	" "
182700	182729	182730	182731	that fellow	3829	" said Mr Cavendish , with a laugh ; but he felt horribly disconcerted all the same , and savage with Miss Marjoribanks , and could not think why "
182732	182796	182730	182731	that fellow	3829	" did not go away . What had he to do in Lucilla 's drawing - room ? what did he mean by sitting down again and talking in that measured way to the old lady , as if all the ordinary rules of good breeding did not point out to him that he should have gone away and left the field clear ? "
182809	182819	182830	182830	he	7389	" said Lucilla ; and then she turned to Mr Ashburton—"I
182864	182865	182860	182860	he	7389	" "
182869	182878	182860	182860	he	7389	" said Mr Ashburton in his business way . "
182909	182916	182899	182899	I	0	" And then Mr Cavendish laughed . "
182924	182928	182920	182920	I	0	" he said . "
182981	182982	182971	182971	one	4465	" "
182985	182989	182996	182996	you	0	" said Lucilla , "
183036	183037	183019	183019	I	0	" "
183052	183076	183047	183047	you	230	" said Mr Cavendish ; and it was with this pretty speech that he took her downstairs to the well - remembered luncheon . "
183096	183109	183078	183078	you	230	" he said in her ear , as they went down together , "
183128	183129	183120	183121	a fellow	5393	" "
183137	183142	183120	183121	a fellow	5393	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
183189	183411	183412	183412	I	0	" said Lucilla sweetly , and she gave the one rival her hand while she held the arm of the other , at the door of the dining - room , in which Mr Ashburton had gallantly deposited Aunt Jemima before saying good - bye . They were both looking a little black , though the gloom was moderate in Mr Ashburton 's case ; but as for Lucilla , she stood between them a picture of angelic sweetness and goodness , giving a certain measure of her sympathy to both — Woman the Reconciler , by the side of those other characters of Inspirer and Consoler , of which the world has heard . The two inferior creatures scowled with politeness at each other , but Miss Marjoribanks smiled upon them both . Such was the way in which she overcame the difficulties of the meeting . Mr Ashburton went away a little annoyed , but still understanding his instructions , and ready to act upon them in that businesslike way he had , and Mr Cavendish remained , faintly reassured in the midst of his soreness and mortification , by at least having the field to himself and seeing the last ( for the present ) of his antagonist — which was a kind of victory in its way . "
183434	183439	183421	183421	you	3842	" said Mr Cavendish . "
183459	183486	183454	183457	a prig like that	3836	" He became indeed quite violent , as Aunt Jemima said afterwards , and met with that lady 's decided disapproval , as may be supposed . "
183497	183505	183487	183488	Mr Ashburton	222	" Mrs John said , with emphasis . "
183519	183520	183521	183522	Young men	1101	" "
183524	183529	183521	183522	Young men	1101	" said Mr Cavendish . "
183574	183598	183568	183568	he	222	" said the unhappy man . He thought he was pointing out his rival 's weakness to Lucilla , and he went on with energy—"I
183618	183619	183568	183568	he	222	" "
183632	183636	183622	183622	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
183673	183713	183662	183662	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks added compassionately ; and as she spoke she looked so like the Lucilla of old , who had schemed and plotted for Mr Cavendish , that he could not believe in her desertion in his heart . "
183723	183727	183728	183728	I	0	" he said . "
183770	183846	184019	184019	you	3853	" This Mr Cavendish said in a low voice , but it did not the less horrify Aunt Jemima , who felt prepared for any atrocity after it . She would have withdrawn , in justice to her own sense of propriety ; but then she thought it was not impossible that he might propose to Lucilla on the spot , or take her hand or something , and for propriety 's sake she stayed . "
183849	184011	184019	184019	you	3853	" said Lucilla — and her heart did for one little moment give a faint thump against her breast . She could not help thinking what a difference it might have made to him , poor fellow , had he been under her lawful and righteous sway these ten years . But as she looked at him it became more and more apparent to Miss Marjoribanks that Mr Cavendish had gone off , whatever she herself might have done . The outlines of his fine figure had changed considerably , and his face was a little red , and he had the look of a man whose circumstances , spiritual and temporal , would not quite bear a rigid examination . As she looked at him her pity became tinged by a certain shade of resentment to think that after all it was his own fault . She could not , notwithstanding her natural frankness of expression , say to him , "
184031	184048	184019	184019	you	3853	" Lucilla carried honesty very far , but she could not go as far as that . "
184051	184073	184019	184019	you	3853	" she said , turning her eyes upon him with a sort of abstract sympathy , and then she added softly , "
184081	184162	184075	184075	you	3853	" with a lowering of her voice . This interesting question , which utterly bewildered Aunt Jemima , drove Mr Cavendish wild with rage . Mrs John said afterwards that she felt a shiver go through her as he took up the carving - knife , though it was only to cut some cold beef . He grew white all at once , and pressed his lips tightly together , and fixed his eyes on the wall straight before him . "
184191	184262	184180	184180	you	3857	" he said , with a chill which fell upon the whole table , and took the life out of everything , and dimmed the very fire in the chimney . And after that the conversation was of a sufficiently ordinary description until they went back again into the drawing - room , by which time Mr Cavendish seemed to have concluded that it was best to pocket the affront . "
184274	184278	184279	184279	I	0	" he said . "
184311	184329	184349	184355	the most popular man in Grange Lane	3861	different"—and he gave Lucilla a look which she thought on the whole it was best to meet . "
184332	184341	184349	184355	the most popular man in Grange Lane	3861	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with cruel distinctness , "
184373	184381	184363	184363	I	0	" said Lucilla , with a sigh . "
184394	184400	184401	184401	You	0	" said the unlucky candidate . "
184429	184782	184421	184427	the most popular man in Grange Lane	3861	" Miss Marjoribanks sighed again , but she did not say anything . On the contrary she turned to Aunt Jemima , who kept in the background an alarmed and alert spectator , to consult her about a shade of wool ; and just then Mr Cavendish , looking out of the window , saw Major Brown conducting his rival through his garden , and shaking hands with him cordially at the door . This was more than the patience of the other candidate could bear . A sudden resolution , hot and angry , as are the resolutions of men who feel themselves to have a failing cause , came into his mind . He had been badgered and baited to such an extent ( as he thought ) that he had not time to consider if it was wise or not . He , too , had sat to Maria Brown , and commanded once the warmest admiration of the household . He thought he would put it to the test , and see if after all his popularity was only a thing to be remembered like yesterday;—and it was with this intention that he bade a hurried good - bye to Lucilla , and , rushing out , threw himself at once upon the troubled waves of society , which had once been as smooth as glass to the most popular man in Grange Lane . Mr Cavendish thought he had been an object of admiration to Maria Brown , as we have said . He thought of it with a little middle - aged complacency , and a confidence that this vague sentiment would stand the test he was about to apply to it , which did honour to the freshness of his heart . With this idea it was Miss Brown he asked for as he knocked at the Major 's door ; and he found them both in the drawing - room , Maria with gloves on to hide the honourable stains of her photography , which made her comparatively useless when she was out of her "
184783	184858	184862	184862	you	3865	studio"—and her father walking about in a state of excitement , which was , indeed , what Mr Cavendish expected . The two exchanged a guilty look when they saw who their visitor was . They looked as people might well look who had been caught in the fact and did not know how to get over it . They came forward , both of them , with a cowardly cordiality and eagerness to welcome him—"How
184871	184952	184862	184862	you	3865	" Miss Brown said , and fluttered and looked at her father , and could not tell what more to say . And then a dead pause fell upon them — such a pause as not unfrequently falls upon people who have got through their mutual greetings almost with an excess of cordiality . They stopped short all at once , and looked at each other , and smiled , and made a fatal conscious effort to talk of something . "
184964	184969	184958	184958	you	3865	" Miss Brown repeated ; "
184978	184997	184971	184971	you	3865	" and then she stopped again , slightly tremulous , and turned an appealing gaze to her papa . "
185005	185016	184998	184998	I	0	" said Mr Cavendish , plucking up all his courage . "
185063	185075	185061	185061	Lydia	161	" said the candidate , looking about him with a smile . "
185080	185087	185078	185078	Lydia	161	" said her sister , with a sigh—"her
185129	185130	185119	185119	she	161	" "
185134	185147	185119	185119	she	161	" said Mr Cavendish , and then he turned to the Major . "
185216	185257	185211	185211	you	3872	" the candidate said , with a great deal more confidence than he felt in his voice . Major Brown cleared his throat ; his heart was moved by the familiar voice , and he could not conceal his embarrassment . "
185265	185269	185211	185211	you	3872	" he said , "
185303	185435	185295	185295	You	3876	" and he held out his hand . But he grew red as he thought of his treachery , and Maria , who was quaking over it , did not even try to say a word to help him — and as for Mr Cavendish , he took up his position on the arm of the sofa , as he used to do . But he had a slim youthful figure when he used to do it , and now the attitude was one which revealed a certain dawning rotundity , very different , as Maria afterwards said , from one 's idea of Mr Cavendish . He was not aware of it himself , but as these two people looked , their simultaneous thought was how much he had changed . "
185444	185449	185439	185439	you	3877	" said Mr Cavendish . "
185540	185587	185588	185588	I	0	" he said . It was the confidence of despair that moved him . The more he saw that his cause was lost , the more he would make it out that he was sure to win — which is not an unusual state of mind . "
185599	185605	185588	185588	I	0	" said poor Major Brown . "
185666	185667	185651	185651	I	0	" "
185681	185686	185687	185687	I	0	" said Miss Brown . "
185699	185705	185687	185687	I	0	" said the modest Major ; "
185776	185777	185771	185771	I	0	" "
185794	185920	185787	185787	you	94	" said Maria . And Mr Cavendish sat on the arm of the sofa , and put his hands deep into his pockets , and dropped his upper lip , and knit his eyebrows a little , and listened to the anxious people excusing themselves . He did not make any answer one way or another . He was terribly mortified and disappointed , and it went against his pride to make further remonstrances . When they had done , he got down off his seat and took his right hand out of his pocket and offered it to Miss Brown , who , putting her own into it , poor soul ! with the remembrance of her ancient allegiance , was like to cry . "
185923	185927	185787	185787	you	94	" he said , "
186009	186649	186650	186651	Good Lord	245	" Mr Cavendish added , with a laugh . As for Miss Brown , it was all she could do to keep from crying as he went away . She said she could see , by the way he left the drawing - room , that he was a stricken deer ; and yet , notwithstanding this sympathetic feeling , she could not but acknowledge , when Miss Marjoribanks mentioned it , that , to have been such a handsome man , he was inconceivably gone off . Mr Cavendish went up Grange Lane with his hands in his pockets , and tried to think that he did not care ; but he did care all the same , and was very bitter in his mind over the failure of friends and the vanity of expectations . The last time he had walked past those garden walls he had thought himself sure of the support of Carlingford , and the personal esteem of all the people in all the houses he was passing . It was after the Archdeacon had broken down in his case against the man whom he called an adventurer , and when Mr Cavendish felt all the sweetness of being a member of an oligarchy , and entitled to the sympathy and support of his order . Now he went along the same path with his hat over his ears and his hands in his pockets , and rage and pain in his heart . Whose fault was it that his friends had deserted him and Carlingford knew him no more ? He might as well have asked whose fault it was that he was getting stout and red in the face , and had not the same grace of figure nor ease of mind as he used to have ? He had come very near to settling down and becoming a man of domestic respectability in this quiet place , and he had just escaped in time , and had laughed over it since , and imagined himself , with much glee , an old fogy looking after a lot of children . But the fact is that men do become old fogies even when they have no children to look after , and lose their figure and their elasticity just as soon and perhaps a little sooner in the midst of what is called life than in any milder scene of enjoyment . And it would have been very handy just now to have been sure of his election without paying much for it . He had been living fast , and spending a great deal of money , and this , after all , was the only real ambition he had ever had ; and he had thought within himself that if he won he would change his mode of life , and turn over a new leaf , and become all at once a different man . When a man has made such a resolution , and feels not only that a mere success but a moral reformation depends upon his victory , he may be permitted to consider that he has a right to win ; and it may be divined what his state of mind was when he had made the discovery that even his old friends did not see his election to be of any such importance as he did , and could think of a miserable little bit of self - importance or gratified vanity more than of his interests — even the women who had once been so kind to him ! He had just got so far in his thoughts when he met Mr Centum , who stared for a moment , and then burst into one of his great laughs as he greeted him . "
186668	186678	186664	186664	you	115	" the banker said , in his coarse way . "
186699	186815	186694	186694	you	115	" Mr Cavendish had to bear all this without giving way to his feelings , or even showing them any more than he could help it . Nobody would spare him that imbecile suggestion as to how things used to be . To be growing stouter than Centum without Centum 's excuse of being a well - to - do householder and father of a family , and respectable man from whom stoutness was expected , was very bitter to him : but he had to gulp it down , and recollect that Centum was as yet the only influential supporter , except his brother - in - law , whom he had in Carlingford . "
186832	186837	186818	186818	you	115	" said Mr Centum . "
186857	186858	186859	186859	I	0	" "
186864	186878	186859	186859	I	0	" said the unfortunate candidate , with a little natural loss of temper . "
186901	186902	186879	186879	You	115	" "
186921	186926	186913	186913	you	115	" said Mr Centum . "
186976	186977	186971	186971	he	222	" "
186980	186985	186986	186986	I	0	" said Mr Cavendish , "
187013	187014	187005	187005	she	119	" "
187021	187026	187019	187019	Lucilla	119	" said Mr Centum . "
187069	187078	187067	187067	you	115	" the banker added , with a laugh . "
187123	187618	187619	187619	I	0	" This was the kind of way in which he was addressed even by his own supporter , who uttered another great laugh as he went off upon his busy way . It was a sort of thing Mr Cavendish was not used to , and he felt it accordingly . To be sure he knew that he was ten years older , and that there were several things which he could not do with the same facility as in his youth . But he had saved up Carlingford in his imagination as a spot in which he would always be young , and where nobody should find out the difference ; and instead of that , it was precisely in Carlingford that he was fated to hear how changed he was , with a frankness which only old friends would have been justified in using . As for Lucilla Marjoribanks , she was rather better looking than otherwise , and absolutely had not gone off . It did not occur to Mr Cavendish that this might be because Lucilla at present was not still so old as he had been ten years ago , in the period which he now considered his youth . He was rather disposed , on the contrary , to take a moral view , and to consider that it was her feminine incapacity for going too far , which had kept years and amusements from having their due effect upon Miss Marjoribanks . And , poor fellow , he had gone too far . He had not been as careful in his life as he might have been had he stayed at Carlingford ; and now he was paying the penalty . Such was the edifying state of mind which he had come to when he reached the top of Grove Street . And there a waft of soft recollections came across his mind . In the absence of all sympathy he could not help turning back to the thought of the enchantress of old who used to sing to him , and listen to him , and storm at him . Probably he would have ended by strolling along the familiar street , and canvassing for Mr Lake 's vote , which would have done him no good in Carlingford , but just then Dr Marjoribanks stopped in his brougham . The Doctor was looking very strange that morning , though nobody had particularly remarked it — perhaps because he smoothed his countenance when he was out of the brougham , which was his refuge when he had anything to think about . But he stopped suddenly to speak to Mr Cavendish , and perhaps he had not time to perform that ceremony . He looked dark and cloudy , and constrained , and as if he forced himself to speak ; which , to be sure , under the circumstances , was not so very strange . "
187627	187632	187619	187619	I	0	" the Doctor said , "
187669	187670	187647	187647	you	3897	" "
187680	187720	187676	187677	old Brown	115	" said Mr Cavendish , with a slight shrug of his shoulders ; which was imprudent , for the Major was not so old as the Doctor , and besides was a much less important man in Grange Lane . "
187730	187740	187722	187722	you	3897	" said Dr Marjoribanks , in his dry way . "
187768	187769	187750	187750	I	0	" "
187809	187816	187817	187817	I	0	" said the candidate for Carlingford . "
187833	187834	187835	187835	We	3898	" "
187847	187863	187835	187835	We	3898	" said Dr Marjoribanks grimly , for he was touchy where his nationality was concerned . "
187871	187915	187835	187835	We	3898	" he added , looking at Mr Cavendish with that critical medical glance which shows that a verbal response is quite unnecessary . This time there was in the look a certain insinuation of doubt on the subject , which was not pleasant . "
187924	187944	187921	187921	I	0	" Dr Marjoribanks added — not laughing , but as if that too was poor Mr Cavendish 's fault . "
187952	187985	187947	187947	I	0	" he answered curtly ; but the truth was that he did not feel sure that he was quite well after he had seen the critical look in Dr Marjoribanks 's eye . "
187994	188023	187986	187986	You	3897	" said the Doctor , with a strange little smile ; but the term at least was consolatory ; and after that Doctor Marjoribanks quite changed his tone . "
188036	188038	188027	188027	Woodburn	99	" he said—"that
188052	188053	188025	188025	you	3897	" "
188057	188074	188025	188025	you	3897	" said Mr Cavendish , promptly , and somehow he felt a pleasure in saying it . "
188106	188116	188025	188025	you	3897	" he added , with a mixture of curiosity and malice—"widows
188125	188126	188025	188025	you	3897	" "
188133	188138	188025	188025	you	3897	" said the Doctor : "
188159	188263	188141	188142	old Lichfield	247	" and then the two shook hands , and the brougham drove on . As for Mr Cavendish , he made up his mind at once that the Doctor was involved , and was not sorry , and felt that it was a sort of judicial recompense for his desertion of his friends . And he went home to tell his sister of it , who shared in his sentiments . And then it was not worth while going out any more that day — for the electioneering agent , who knew all about it , was not coming till the last train . "
188276	188437	188266	188266	I	0	" Mr Cavendish said . And in the meantime he threw himself into an easy chair . Perhaps that was why he was getting so stout . And in the meantime the Doctor went on visiting his patients . When he came back to his brougham between his visits , and went bowling along in that comfortable way , along the familiar roads , there was a certain glumness upon his face . He was not a demonstrative man , but when he was alone you could tell by certain lines about the well - worn cordage of his countenance whether all was right with the Doctor ; and it was easy to see just at this moment that all was not right with him . But he did not say anything about it when he got home ; on the contrary , he was just as usual , and told his daughter all about his encounter with Mr Cavendish . "
188479	188493	188466	188466	he	285	" said the Doctor , with a gleam of humour in his eye . "
188504	188860	188502	188502	papa	295	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; and the Doctor laughed as he sat down to dinner . If he had anything on his mind he bore it like a hero , and gave no sign ; but then , as Mrs John very truly remarked , when a man does not disclose his annoyances they always tell more upon him in the end . There were a great many reasons why this should be a critical period in Miss Marjoribanks 's life . For one thing , it was the limit she had always proposed to herself for her term of young - ladyhood ; and naturally , as she outgrew the age for them , she felt disposed to put away childish things . To have the control of society in her hands was a great thing ; but still the mere means , without any end , was not worth Lucilla 's while — and her Thursdays were almost a bore to her in her present stage of development . They occurred every week , to be sure , as usual ; but the machinery was all perfect , and went on by itself , and it was not in the nature of things that such a light adjunct of existence should satisfy Lucilla , as she opened out into the ripeness of her thirtieth year . It was this that made Mr Ashburton so interesting to her , and his election a matter into which she entered so warmly , for she had come to an age at which she might have gone into Parliament herself had there been no disqualification of sex , and when it was almost a necessity for her to make some use of her social influence . Miss Marjoribanks had her own ideas in respect to charity , and never went upon ladies ' committees , nor took any further share than what was proper and necessary in parish work ; and when a woman has an active mind , and still does not care for parish work , it is a little hard for her to find a "
188863	188925	188466	188466	he	285	" And Lucilla , though she said nothing about a sphere , was still more or less in that condition of mind which has been so often and so fully described to the British public — when the ripe female intelligence , not having the natural resource of a nursery and a husband to manage , turns inwards , and begins to "
188929	189517	189518	189518	I	0	" against the existing order of society , and to call the world to account for giving it no due occupation — and to consume itself . She was not the woman to make protests , nor claim for herself the doubtful honours of a false position ; but she felt all the same that at her age she had outlived the occupations that were sufficient for her youth . To be sure , there were still the dinners to attend to , a branch of human affairs worthy of the weightiest consideration , and she had a house of her own , as much as if she had been half a dozen times married ; but still there are instincts which go even beyond dinners , and Lucilla had become conscious that her capabilities were greater than her work . She was a Power in Carlingford , and she knew it ; but still there is little good in the existence of a Power unless it can be made use of for some worthy end . She was coming up Grange Lane rather late one evening , pondering upon these things — thinking within herself compassionately of poor Mr Cavendish , a little in the same way as he had been thinking of her , but from the opposite point of view . For Lucilla could not but see the antithesis of their position , and how he was the foolish apprentice who had chosen his own way and was coming to a bad end , while she was the steady one about to ride by in her Lord Mayor 's coach . And Miss Marjoribanks was thinking at the same time of the other candidate , whose canvass was going on so successfully ; and that , after the election and all the excitement was over , she would feel a blank — and Lucilla did not see how the blank was to be filled up as she looked into the future ; for , as has been said , parish work was not much in her way , and for a woman who feels that she is a Power , there are so few other outlets . She was a little disheartened as she thought it all over . Gleams of possibility , it is true , crossed her mind , such as that of marrying the member for Carlingford , for instance , and thus beginning a new and more important career ; but she was too experienced a woman not to be aware by this time , that possibilities which did not depend upon herself alone had better not be calculated upon . And there did occur to her , among other things , the idea of making a great Experiment which could be carried out only by a woman of genius — of marrying a poor man , and affording to Carlingford and England an example which might influence unborn generations . Such were the thoughts that were passing through her mind when , to her great surprise , she came up to her father , walking up Grange Lane over the dirty remains of the snow — for there was a great deal of snow that year . It was so strange a sight to see Dr Marjoribanks walking that at the first glance Lucilla was startled , and thought something was the matter ; but , of course , it all arose from a perfectly natural and explainable cause . "
189527	189532	189524	189525	Mrs Chiley	96	" said the Doctor ; "
189579	189580	189571	189571	He	115	" "
189594	189599	189585	189585	she	96	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
189610	189620	189604	189604	she	96	" said the Doctor , in a dreary tone . "
189648	189649	189659	189659	papa	295	" "
189661	189665	189659	189659	papa	295	" said Lucilla . "
189676	189677	189669	189669	she	96	" "
189688	189693	189694	189694	we	3920	" said the Doctor ; "
189737	189759	189717	189717	you	119	" Dr Marjoribanks added , with a little grunt , as who should say that is the way of the world . "
189767	189772	189761	189761	I	0	" said Lucilla mildly ; "
189804	189805	189790	189790	Tom	117	" "
189825	189835	189820	189823	that old — woman	3925	" said the Doctor , pulling himself up sharply , "
189884	189885	189876	189876	he	117	" "
189891	190013	189876	189876	he	117	" said Lucilla , with a little sigh . The Doctor knew nothing about the great social experiment which it had entered into Miss Marjoribanks 's mind to make for the regeneration of her contemporaries and the good of society , or possibly he might not have distinguished Tom by that particular title . Was it he , perhaps , who was destined to be the hero of a domestic drama embodying the best principles of that Moral Philosophy which Lucilla had studied with such success at Mount Pleasant ? She did not ask herself the question , for things had not as yet come to that point , but it gleamed upon her mind as by a side - light . "
190028	190033	190019	190019	you	119	" said the Doctor . "
190111	190166	190106	190106	you	119	" Dr Marjoribanks added . He was a worldly man himself , and he thought his daughter a worldly woman ; and yet , though he thoroughly approved of it , he still despised Lucilla a little for her prudence , which is a paradoxical state of mind not very unusual in the world . "
190176	190180	190106	190106	you	119	" said Lucilla ; "
190227	190246	190216	190217	Mr Cavendish	115	" The Doctor laughed , though he had not seemed up to this moment much disposed for laughing . "
190256	190260	190251	190251	your	3932	" he said ; "
190285	190307	190276	190283	a young fellow that might have done better	3933	" Dr Marjoribanks said reflectively , perhaps not without a slight prick of conscience that he had forsaken an old friend . "
190310	190317	190318	190318	you	3932	" said Lucilla , with a certain solemnity—"but
190333	190388	190329	190329	he	285	" And she sighed , though the Doctor , who had not been thinking of Mr Cavendish 's prospects in that light , laughed once more ; but it was a sharp sort of sudden laugh without much heart in it . He had most likely other things of more importance in his mind . "
190404	190412	190329	190329	he	285	" he said , smiling rather grimly . "
190460	190484	190456	190457	a man	285	" the Doctor said abruptly , which , whatever he might mean by it , was a dismal sort of speech to make . "
190490	190499	190488	190488	papa	295	" asked Lucilla , with a little alarm . "
190509	190514	190488	190488	papa	295	" he said impatiently . "
190554	190562	190550	190551	a fool	717	" Dr Marjoribanks said , with energy . "

190678	190702	190660	190660	papa	295	" said the Doctor , with that tone which Lucilla could remember fifteen years ago , when she made the same magnanimous suggestion , "
190799	190800	190781	190781	I	0	" "
190804	190846	190781	190781	I	0	" said Lucilla , not without some anxiety ; for it was an odd way of talking , to say the least of it ; but the Doctor had come to a pause , and did not seem disposed to resume . "
190860	190864	190853	190853	I	0	" he said ; "
190934	191154	191159	191159	she	3943	" It was an odd way of talking , and it was odd to break off like this ; but then , to be sure , there was no occasion for any more conversation , since they had just arrived at their own door . It made Lucilla uneasy for the moment , but while she was dressing she managed to explain it to herself , and to think , after all , it was only natural that her papa should have seen a little into the movement and commotion of her thoughts ; and then poor dear old Mrs Chiley being so ill , who was one of his own set , so to speak . He was quite cheerful later in the evening , and enjoyed his dinner , and was even more civil than usual to Mrs John . And though he did not come up to tea , he made his appearance afterwards with a flake of new - fallen snow still upon his rusty gray whiskers . He had gone to see his patient again , notwithstanding the silent storm outside . And his countenance was a little overcast this time , no doubt by the late walk , and the serious state Mrs Chiley was in , and his encounter with the snow . "
191163	191167	191170	191170	she	3943	" he said . "

191286	191291	191292	191292	I	0	" said the Doctor . "

191351	191356	191343	191344	The Chileys	248	" said Mrs John . "

191394	191404	191405	191405	Lucilla	119	" said the Doctor , interrupting her without hesitation . "
191469	191485	191461	191461	you	0	" said the Doctor , with mingled amusement and satire , and a kind of gratification "
191494	191495	191487	191487	Ashburton	222	" "
191503	191507	191500	191501	the agent	3953	" said Lucilla . "
191555	191556	191543	191544	Mr Ashburton	222	" "
191568	191739	191562	191562	he	222	" said Dr Marjoribanks , and he took his candle and went away with a smile . But either Mr Ashburton 's good opinion of Lucilla , or some other notion , had touched the Doctor . He was not a man who said much at any time , but when he bade her good - night , his hand drooped upon Lucilla 's shoulder , and he patted it softly , as he might have patted the head of a child . It was not much , but still it was a good deal from him . To feel the lingering touch of her father 's hand caressing her , even in so mild a way , was something quite surprising and strange to Miss Marjoribanks . She looked up at him almost with alarm , but he was just then turning away with his candle in his hand . And he seemed to have laid aside his gloom , and even smiled to himself as he went upstairs . "
191752	191822	191823	191824	the boy	908	" he said to himself . He could not have explained why he was more than ordinarily hard just then upon the innocent , far - distant Tom , who was unlucky , it is true , but not exactly an ass , after all . But somehow it struck the Doctor more than ever how great a loss it was to society and to herself that Lucilla was not "
191826	191878	191879	191887	the boy " in this limited and unfruitful generation	7597	" She could have continued , and perhaps extended , the practice , whereas just now it was quite possible that she might drop down into worsted - work and tea - parties like any other single woman — while Tom , who had carried off the family honours , and was "
191881	192031	192032	192032	My	0	" in this limited and unfruitful generation , was never likely to do anything to speak of , and would be a poor man if he were to live for a hundred years . Perhaps there was something else behind that made the Doctor 's brow contract a little as he crossed the threshold of his chamber , into which , no more than into the recesses of his heart , no one ever penetrated ; but it was the lighter idea of that comparison , which had no actual pain in it , but only a kind of humorous discontent , which was the last articulate thought in his mind as he went to his room and closed his door with a little sharpness , as he always did , upon the outside world . Aunt Jemima , for her part , lingered a little with Lucilla downstairs . "
192084	192092	192073	192073	I	0	" said Mrs John , with anxiety , "
192099	192100	192073	192073	I	0	" "
192117	192122	192110	192110	You	230	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
192153	192187	192143	192144	Mrs Chiley	96	" But nevertheless Lucilla knocked at his door when she went upstairs . And the Doctor , though he did not open , growled within with a voice which reassured his dutiful daughter . "
192203	193127	193128	193128	I	0	" the Doctor said . And even Mrs John , who had waited at his door , with her candle in her hand , to hear the result , shrank within at the sound and was seen no more . And Miss Marjoribanks , too , went to her rest , with more than one subject of thought which kept her awake . In the first place , the Rector was popular in his way , and if he chose to call all his forces to rally round a penitent , there was no saying what might come of it ; and then Lucilla could not help going back in the most illogical manner to her father 's caress , and wondering what was the meaning of it . Meantime the snow fell heavily outside , and wrapped everything in a soft and secret whiteness . And amid the whiteness and darkness , the lamp burned steadily outside at the garden - gate , which pointed out the Doctor 's door amid all the closed houses and dark garden - walls in Grange Lane — a kind of visible succour and help always at hand for those who were suffering . And though Dr Marjoribanks was not like a young man making a practice , but had perfect command of Carlingford , and was one of the richest men in it , it was well known in the town that the very poorest , if in extremity , in the depths of the wildest night that ever blew , would not seek help there in vain . The bell that had roused him when he was young , still hung near him in the silence of his closed - up house when he was old , and still could make him spring up , all self - possessed and ready , when the enemy Death had to be fought with . But that night the snow cushioned the wire outside , and even made white cornices and columns about the steady lamp , and the Doctor slept within , and no one disturbed him ; for except Mrs Chiley and a few chronic patients , there was nothing particularly amiss in Carlingford , and then it was Dr Rider whom all the new people went to , the people who lived in the innumerable new houses at the other end of Carlingford , and had no hallowing tradition of the superior authority of Grange Lane . The talk of this evening might not have been considered of any importance to speak of , but for the extraordinary and most unlooked - for event which startled all Carlingford next morning . Nobody could believe that it was true . Dr Marjoribanks 's patients waited for him , and declared to their nurses that it was all a made - up story , and that he would come and prove that he was not dead . How could he be dead ? He had been as well as he ever was that last evening . He had gone down Grange Lane in the snow , to see the poor old lady who was now sobbing in her bed , and saying it was all a mistake , and that it was she who ought to have died . But all those protestations were of no avail against the cold and stony fact which had frightened Thomas out of his senses , when he went to call the Doctor . He had died in the night without calling or disturbing anybody . He must have felt faint , it seemed , for he had got up and taken a little brandy , the remains of which still stood on the table by his bedside ; but that was all that anybody could tell about it . They brought Dr Rider , of course ; but all that he could do was to examine the strong , still frame — old , and yet not old enough to be weakly , or to explain such sudden extinction — which had ceased its human functions . And then the news swept over Carlingford like a breath of wind , though there was no wind even on that silent snowy day to carry the matter . Dr Marjoribanks was dead . It put the election out of people 's heads , and even their own affairs for the time being ; for had he not known all about the greater part of them — seen them come into the world and kept them in it — and put himself always in the breach when the pale Death approached that way ? He had never made very much boast of his friendliness or been large in sympathetic expressions , but yet he had never flinched at any time , or deserted his patients for any consideration . Carlingford was sorry , profoundly sorry , with that true sorrow which is not so much for the person mourned as for the mourner 's self , who feels a sense of something lost . The people said to themselves , Whom could they ever find who would know their constitutions so well , and who was to take care of So - and - so if he had another attack ? To be sure Dr Rider was at hand , who felt a little agitated about it , and was conscious of the wonderful opening , and was very ready to answer , "
193132	193236	193128	193128	I	0	" but a young doctor is different from an old one , and a living man all in commonplace health and comfort is not to be compared with a dead one , on the morning at least of his sudden ending . Thank Heaven , when a life is ended there is always that hour or two remaining to set straight the defective balances and do a hasty late justice to the dead , before the wave sweeps on over him and washes out the traces of his steps , and lets in the common crowd to make their thoroughfare over the grave . "
193244	193254	193241	193242	the Doctor	326	" Mrs Chiley said , sobbing in her bed , "
193308	193668	193306	193306	me	0	" said the poor old lady , and she was so hysterical that they had to send for Dr Rider , and she was thus the first to begin to build the new world on the foundations of the old , little as she meant it . But for the moment everything was paralysed in Grange Lane , and canvassing came to a standstill , and nothing was discussed but Dr Marjoribanks — how he was dead , though nobody could or would believe it ; and how Lucilla would be left , and who her trustees were , and how the place could ever get used to the want of him , or would ever look like itself again without his familiar presence . It was by way of relieving their minds from the horror of the idea , that the good people rushed into consultations what Lucilla would do . It took their minds a little off the ghastly imagination of that dark room with the snow on the window , and the late moonlight trying to get into the darkness , and the white rigid face inside , as he was said to have been found . It could not but make a terrible change to her — indeed , through her it could not but make a great change to everybody . The Doctor 's house would , of course , be shut up , which had been the most hospitable house in Carlingford , and things would drop into the unsatisfactory state they used to be in before Miss Marjoribanks 's time , and there would no longer be anybody to organise society . Such were the ideas the ladies of Grange Lane relapsed into by way of delivering themselves from the pain of their first realisation of what had happened . It would make a great change . Even the election and its anticipated joys could not but change character in some respects at least , and there would be nobody to make the best of them ; and then the question was , What would Lucilla do ? Would she have strength to "
193673	193853	193306	193306	me	0	" as some people suggested ; or would she feel not only her grief , but her downfall , and that she was now only a single woman , and sink into a private life , as some others were inclined to believe ? Inside the house , naturally , the state of affairs was sad enough . Lucilla , notwithstanding the many other things she had had to occupy her mind , was fond of her father , and the shock overwhelmed her for the moment . Though she was not the kind of woman to torture herself with thinking of things that she might have done , still at the first moment the idea that she ought not to have left him alone — that she should have sat up and watched or taken some extraordinary , unusual precaution — was not to be driven away from her mind . The reign of reason was eclipsed in her as it often is in such an emergency . She said it was her fault in the first horror . "
193875	193955	193868	193868	I	0	" said Lucilla , which indeed was a very natural thing to say , but would have been an utterly impossible one to carry out , as she saw when she came to think of it . But she could not think of it just then . She did not think at all that first long snowy , troubled day , but went about the house , on the bedroom floor , wringing her hands like a creature distracted . "
193963	194361	193868	193868	I	0	" she said ; and then she would recall the touch of his hand on her shoulder , which she seemed still to be feeling , and cry out , like all the rest of the world , that it could not be true . But , to be sure , that was a state of feeling that could not last long . There are events for which something higher than accident must be held accountable , were one ever so ready to take the burden of affairs on one 's own shoulders ; and Lucilla knew , when she came to herself , that if she had watched ever so long or so closely , that could have had no effect upon the matter . After a while , the bewildering sense of her own changed position began to come upon her , and roused her up into that feverish and unnatural activity of thought which , in some minds , is the inevitable reaction after the unaccustomed curb and shock of grief . When she had got used to that dreadful certainty about her father , and had suddenly come with a leap to the knowledge that she was not to blame , and could not help it , and that though he was gone , she remained , it is no censure upon Lucilla to say that her head became immediately full of a horror and confusion of thoughts , an involuntary stir and bustle of plans and projects which she did all she could to put down , but which would return and overwhelm her whether she chose it or not . She could not help asking herself what her new position was , thinking it over , so strangely free and new and unlimited as it seemed . And it must be recollected that Miss Marjoribanks was a woman of very active mind and great energies , too old to take up a girl 's fancy that all was over because she had encountered a natural grief on her passage , and too young not to see a long future still before her . She kept her room , as was to be expected , and saw nobody , and only moved the household and superintended the arrangements in a muffled way through Thomas , who was an old servant , and knew "
194364	196180	196181	196181	Lucilla	119	" of the house ; but notwithstanding her seclusion and her honest sorrow , and her perfect observance of all the ordinary restraints of the moment , it would be wrong to omit all mention of this feverish bustle of thinking which came into Lucilla 's mind in her solitude . Of all that she had to bear , it was the thing that vexed and irritated and distressed her the most — as if , she said to herself indignantly , she ought to have been able to think of anything ! And the chances are that Lucilla , for sheer duty 's sake , would have said , if anybody had asked , that of course she had not thought of anything as yet ; without being aware that the mere shock , and horror , and profound commotion had a great deal more to do than anything else in producing that fluttering crowd of busy , vexatious speculations which had come , without any will of hers , into her heart . It looked a dreadful change in one way as she looked at it , without wishing to look at it , in the solitude of her own room , where the blinds were all down , and the snow sometimes came with a little thump against the window , and where it was so dark that it was a comfort when night came , and the lamp could be lighted . So far as Carlingford was concerned , it would be almost as bad for Miss Marjoribanks as if she were her father 's widow instead of his daughter . To keep up a position of social importance in a single woman 's house , unless , as she had herself lightly said so short a time since , she were awfully rich , would be next to impossible . All that gave importance to the centre of society — the hospitable table , the open house — had come to an end with the Doctor . Things could no more be as they had once been , in that respect at least . She might stay in the house , and keep up to the furthest extent possible to her its old traditions ; but even to the utmost limit to which Lucilla could think it right to go it could never be the same . This consciousness kept gleaming upon her as she sat in the dull daylight behind the closed blinds , with articles of mourning piled about everywhere , and the gray dimness getting into her very eyes , and her mind distressed by the consciousness that she ought to have been unable to think ; and the sadness of the prospect altogether was enough to stir up a reaction , in spite of herself , in Miss Marjoribanks 's mind . And on the other side she would no doubt be very well off , and could go wherever she liked , and had no limit , except what was right and proper and becoming , to what she might please to do . She might go abroad if she liked , which perhaps is the first idea of the modern English mind when anything happens to it , and settle wherever she pleased , and arrange her mode of existence as seemed good in her own eyes . She would be an heiress in a moderate way , and Aunt Jemima was by this time absolutely at her disposal , and could be taken anywhere ; and at Lucilla 's age it was quite impossible to predict what might not happen to a woman in such a position . When these fairer possibilities gleamed into Lucilla 's mind , it would be difficult to describe the anger and self - disgust with which she reproached herself — for perhaps it was the first time that she had consciously failed in maintaining a state of mind becoming the occasion ; and though nobody but herself knew of it , the pain of the accusation was acute and bitter . But how could Miss Marjoribanks help it?—the mind travels so much quicker than anything else , and goes so far , and makes its expeditions in such subtle , stealthy ways . She might begin by thinking of her dear papa , and yet , before she could dry her eyes , might be off in the midst of one of these bewildering speculations . For everything was certain now so far as he was concerned ; and everything was so uncertain , and full of such unknown issues for herself . Thus the dark days before the funeral passed by — and everybody was very kind . Dr Marjoribanks was one of the props of the place , and all Carlingford bestirred itself to do him the final honours ; and all her friends conspired how to save Lucilla from all possible trouble , and help her over the trial ; and to see how much he was respected was the greatest of all possible comforts to her , as she said . Thus it was that among the changes that everybody looked for , there occurred all at once this change which was entirely unexpected , and put everything else out of mind for the moment . For to tell the truth , Dr Marjoribanks was one of the men who , according to external appearance , need never have died . There was nothing about him that wanted to be set right , no sort of loss , or failure , or misunderstanding , so far as anybody could see . An existence in which he could have his friends to dinner every week , and a good house , and good wine , and a very good table , and nothing particular to put him out of his way , seemed in fact the very ideal of the best life for the Doctor . There was nothing in him that seemed to demand anything better , and it was confusing to try to follow him into that which , no doubt , must be in all its fundamentals a very different kind of world . He was a just man and a good man in his way , and had been kind to many people in his lifetime — but still he did not seem to have that need of another rectifying , completer existence which most men have . There seemed no reason why he should die — a man who was so well contented with this lower region in which many of us fare badly , and where so few of us are contented . This was a fact which exercised a very confusing influence , even when they themselves were not aware of it , on many people 's minds . It was hard to think of him under any other circumstances , or identify him with angels and spirits — which feeling on the whole made the regret for him a more poignant sort of regret . And they buried him with the greatest signs of respect . People from twenty miles off sent their carriages , and all the George Street people shut their shops , and there was very little business done all day . Mr Cavendish and Mr Ashburton walked side by side at the funeral , which was an affecting sight to see ; and if anything more could have been done to show their respect which was not done , the corporation of Carlingford would have been sorry for it . And the snow still lay deep in all the corners , though it had been trampled down all about the Doctor 's house , where the lamp was not lighted now of nights ; for what was the use of lighting the lamp , which was a kind of lighthouse in its way , and meant to point out succour and safety for the neighbours , when the physician himself was lying beyond all hope of succour or aid ? And all the Grange Lane people retired in a sympathetic , awe - stricken way , and decided , or at least the ladies did , to see Lucilla next day , if she was able to see them , and to find out whether she was going to make an effort , or what she meant to do . And Mrs Chiley was so much better that she was able to be up a little in the evening , though she scarcely could forgive herself , and still could not help thinking that it was she who had really been sent for , and that the Doctor had been taken in mistake . And as for Lucilla , she sat in her room and cried , and thought of her father 's hand upon her shoulder — that last unusual caress which was more touching to think of than a world of words . He had been fond of her and proud of her , and at the last moment he had showed it . And by times she seemed to feel again that lingering touch , and cried as if her heart would break : and yet , for all that , she could not keep her thoughts steady , nor prevent them from wandering to all kinds of profane out - of - door matters , and to considerations of the future , and estimates of her own position . It wounded her sadly to feel herself in such an inappropriate state of mind , but she could not help it ; and then the want of natural light and air oppressed her sorely , and she longed for the evening , which felt a little more natural , and thought that at last she might have a long talk with Aunt Jemima , who was a kind of refuge in her present loneliness , and gave her a means of escape at the same time from all this bustle and commotion of unbecoming thoughts . This was enough surely for any one to have to encounter at one time ; but that very night another rumour began to murmur through Carlingford — a rumour more bewildering , more incredible still , than that of the Doctor 's death , which the town had been obliged to confirm and acknowledge , and put its seal to . When the thing was first mentioned , everybody ( who could find it in their heart to laugh ) laughed loud in the face of the first narrator with mingled scepticism and indignation . They asked him what he meant by it , and ridiculed and scoffed at him to his face . "
196191	196195	196181	196181	Lucilla	119	" people said ; "
196202	196451	196181	196181	Lucilla	119	" But after this statement had been made , the town began to listen . It was obliged to listen , for other witnesses came in to confirm the story . It never might have been found out while the Doctor lived , for he had a great practice , and made a great deal of money ; but now that he was dead , nothing could be hid . He was dead , and he had made an elaborate will , which was all as just and righteous as a will could be ; but after the will was read , it was found out that everything named in it had disappeared like a bubble . Instead of being the richest , Dr Marjoribanks was one of the poorest men in Carlingford when he shut his door behind him on that snowy night . It was a revelation which took the town perfectly by storm , and startled everybody out of their senses . Lucilla 's plans , which she thought so wicked , went out all of a sudden , in a certain dull amaze and dismay , to which no words could give any expression . Such was the second inconceivable reverse of fortune which happened to Miss Marjoribanks , more unexpected , more incomprehensible still than the other , in the very midst of her most important activities and hopes . When the first whisper of the way in which she was — as people say—"left
196452	196597	196616	196616	Lucilla	119	" reached Lucilla , her first feeling was incredulity . It was conveyed to her by Aunt Jemima , who came to her in her room after the funeral with a face blanched with dismay . Miss Marjoribanks took it for grief ; and , though she did not look for so much feeling from Mrs John , was pleased and comforted that her aunt should really lament her poor papa . It was a compliment which , in the softened and sorrowful state of Lucilla 's mind , went to her heart . Aunt Jemima came up and kissed her in a hasty excited way , which showed genuine and spontaneous emotion , and was not like the solemn pomp with which sympathising friends generally embrace a mourner ; and then she made Lucilla sit down by the fire and held her hands . "
196602	196605	196616	196616	Lucilla	119	" said Aunt Jemima—"my
196634	196635	196626	196626	you	3972	" "
196643	196655	196637	196637	you	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , though she was a little puzzled . "
196697	196698	196699	196699	Lucilla	119	" "
196701	196707	196699	196699	Lucilla	119	" cried Mrs John impulsively , "
196803	196804	196791	196791	he	3632	" "
196809	196818	196791	196791	he	3632	" said Miss Marjoribanks , drying her tears . "
196846	196847	196848	196848	Lucilla	119	" "
196850	196856	196848	196848	Lucilla	119	" said Aunt Jemima solemnly , "
196931	196939	196915	196915	I	0	" cried Mrs John , with fervour , "
196956	196990	196899	196899	I	0	" But Lucilla put her aunt away softly when she was about to fall upon her neck . Miss Marjoribanks was struck dumb ; her heart seemed to stop beating for the moment . "
197002	197377	196899	196899	I	0	" she said , and gave a gasp to recover her breath . Then Mrs John came down upon her with facts , proving it to be true — showing how Dr Marjoribanks 's money was invested , and how it had been lost . She made a terrible muddle of it , no doubt , but Lucilla was not very clear about business details any more than her aunt , and she did not move nor say a word while the long , involved , endless narrative went on . She kept saying it was impossible in her heart for half of the time , and then she crept nearer the fire and shivered , and said nothing even to herself , and did not even seem to listen , but knew that it must be true . It would be vain to attempt to say that it was not a terrible blow to Lucilla ; her strength was weakened already by grief and solitude and want of food , for she could not find it in her heart to go on eating her ordinary meals as if nothing had happened ; and all of a sudden she felt the cold seize her , and drew closer and closer to the fire . The thoughts which she had been thinking in spite of herself , and for which she had so greatly condemned herself , went out with a sudden distinctness , as if it had been a lamp going out and leaving the room in darkness , and a sudden sense of utter gloom and cold and bewildering uncertainty came over Lucilla . When she lifted her eyes from the fire , into which she had been gazing , it almost surprised her to find herself still in this warm room where there was every appliance for comfort , and where her entire wardrobe of new mourning — everything , as Aunt Jemima said , that a woman could desire — was piled up on the bed . It was impossible that she could be a penniless creature , left on her own resources , without father or supporter or revenue ; and yet — good heavens ! could it be true ? "
197386	197390	197383	197384	Aunt Jemima	230	" said Lucilla , "
197419	197420	197406	197406	I	0	" "
197431	197436	197429	197429	Lucilla	119	" cried Mrs John . "
197454	197478	197479	197479	I	0	" Upon which Lucilla rose and kissed Aunt Jemima , though her head was all confused and she had noises in her ears . "
197493	197497	197490	197490	you	0	" she said . "
197515	197543	197509	197509	she	96	" and with that Miss Marjoribanks softened , and felt a little comforted , and cried again — not for the money , but for her father . "
197562	197787	197559	197560	Aunt Jemima	230	" she said . But after Mrs John had gone away full of wonder at her philosophy , Lucilla drew close to the fire again and took her head between her hands and tried to think what it meant . Could it be true ? Instead of the heiress , in a good position , who could go abroad or anywhere , and do anything she liked , was it possible that she was only a penniless single woman with nobody to look to , and nothing to live on ? Such an extraordinary incomprehensible revolution might well make any one feel giddy . The solid house and the comfortable room , and her own sober brain , which was not in the way of being put off its balance , seemed to turn round and round as she looked into the fire . Lucilla was not one to throw the blame upon her father , as Mrs John had done . On the contrary she was sorry , profoundly sorry for him , and made such a picture to herself of what his feelings must have been , when he went into his room that night and knew that all his hard - earned fortune was gone , that it made her weep the deepest tears for him that she had yet shed . "
197791	198485	197788	197789	Poor papa	4396	" she said to herself ; and as she was not much given to employing her imagination in this way , and realising the feeling of others , the effect was all the greater now . If he had but told her , and put off a share of the burden from his own shoulders on to hers who could have borne it ! but the Doctor had never done justice to Lucilla 's qualities . This , amid her general sense of confusion and dizziness and insecurity , was the only clear thought that struck Miss Marjoribanks ; and that it was very cold and must be freezing outside ; and how did the poor people manage who had not all her present advantages ? She tried to put away this revelation from her , as she had said to Aunt Jemima , and keep it for a little at arm 's length , and get a night 's rest in the meantime , and so be able to bring a clear head to the contemplation of it to - morrow , which was the most judicious thing to do . But when the mind has been stimulated by such a shock , Solomon himself , one would suppose , could scarcely , however clearly he might perceive what was best , take the judicious passive way . When Lucilla got up from where she was crouching before the fire , she felt so giddy that she could scarcely stand . Her head was all queer , as she had said , and she had a singing in her ears . She herself seemed to have changed along with her position . An hour or two before , she could have answered for her own steadiness and self - possession in almost any circumstances , but now the blood seemed to be running a race in her veins , and the strangest noises hummed in her ears . She felt ashamed of her weakness , but she could not help it ; and then she was weak with grief and excitement and comparative fasting , which told for something , probably , in her inability to bear so unlooked - for a blow . But Miss Marjoribanks thought it was best to go down to the drawing - room for tea , as she had said . To see everything just as it had been , utterly indifferent and unconscious of what had happened , made her cry , and relieved her giddiness by reviving her grief ; and then the next minute a bewildering wonder seized her as to what would become of this drawing - room , the scene of her triumphs — who would live in it , and whom the things would go to — which made her sick , and brought back the singing in her ears . But on the whole she took tea very quietly with Aunt Jemima , who kept breaking into continual snatches of lamentation , but was always checked by Lucilla 's composed looks . If she had not heard this extraordinary news , which made the world turn round with her , Miss Marjoribanks would have felt that soft hush of exhaustion and grief subdued which , when the grief is not too urgent , comes after all is over ; and even now she felt a certain comfort in the warm firelight and the change out of her own room — where she had been living shut up , with the blinds down , and the black dresses everywhere about , for so many dreary days . John Brown , who had charge of Dr Marjoribanks 's affairs , came next day and explained everything to Lucilla . The lawyer had had one short interview with his client after the news came , and Dr Marjoribanks had borne it like a man . His face had changed a little , and he had sat down , which he was not in the habit of doing , and drawn a kind of shivering long breath ; and then he had said , "
198489	198530	198532	198532	he	3988	" to himself . This was all Mr Brown could say about the effect the shock had on the Doctor . And there was something in this very scanty information which gave Lucilla a new pang of sorrow and consolation . "
198542	198598	198532	198532	he	3988	" she said , with tender tears ; and felt she had never loved her father so well in all her life — which is one of the sweeter uses of death which many must have experienced , but which belonged to a more exquisite and penetrating kind of emotion than was common to Lucilla . "
198611	198616	198601	198601	he	3988	" said Mr Brown , "
198710	198749	198698	198698	nobody	4434	" said the lawyer , with a certain moisture in his eyes ; for there was nobody in Carlingford who did not miss the old Doctor , and John Brown was very tender - hearted in his way . "
198761	198793	198751	198751	nobody	4434	" said Lucilla , with a sob ; and she meant it with all her heart , thinking chiefly of his hand on her shoulder that last night , and of the "
198797	199091	198751	198751	nobody	4434	" in John Brown 's office ; though , after all , perhaps , it was not chiefly as a tender father that Dr Marjoribanks shone , though he gave his daughter all she wanted or asked for . Her grief was so true , and so little tinctured by any of that indignation over the unexpected loss , which Aunt Jemima had not been able to conceal , that John Brown was quite touched , and felt his heart warm to Lucilla . He explained it all very fully to her when she was composed enough to understand him ; and as he went through all the details the giddiness came back , and once more Miss Marjoribanks felt the world running round , and heard his statement through the noises in her ears . All this settled down , however , into a certain distinctness as John Brown , who was very clear - headed and good at making a concise statement , went on ; and gradually the gyrations became slower and slower , and the great universe became solid once more , and held to its moorings under Lucilla 's feet , and she ceased to hear that supernatural hum and buzz . The vague shadows of chaos and ruin dispersed , and through them she saw once more the real aspect of things . She was not quite penniless . There was the house , which was a very good house , and some little corners and scraps of money in the Funds , which were Lucilla 's very own , and could not be lost ; and last of all there was the business — the best practice in Carlingford , and entire command of Grange Lane . "
199098	199102	198751	198751	nobody	4434	" said Lucilla ; "
199135	199165	199125	199125	everybody	300	" she said , in an aggrieved voice ; and then for the first time John Brown remembered , to his confusion , that there was once said to be "
199168	199185	199210	199210	Rider	200	" Miss Marjoribanks and Dr Rider ; which complicated the affair in the most uncomfortable way . "
199188	199192	199210	199210	Rider	200	" he said , "
199222	199223	199218	199219	Miss Marjoribanks	88	" "
199231	199235	199236	199236	He	200	" said Lucilla . "
199295	199340	199280	199281	anybody else	1725	" And here she stopped to cry , unreasonably , but yet very naturally ; for it did feel hard that in the house to which Dr Marjoribanks 's last visit had been paid , another doctor should have been called in next day . "
199347	199352	199342	199342	I	0	" said John Brown , "
199421	199446	199447	199447	You	3999	" Lucilla caught , as it were , and met , and forced to face her , her informant 's embarrassed , hesitating look . "
199451	199456	199447	199447	You	3999	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
199543	199555	199576	199576	You	3999	" said Lucilla , with a sigh of self - reproach . "
199590	199591	199578	199578	they	4005	" "
199600	201034	199596	199596	you	3999	" said John Brown , who was rather scared , and very much impressed by Miss Marjoribanks 's candour . Dr Rider had been the first love of Mr Brown 's own wife , and the lawyer had a curious kind of satisfaction in thinking that this silly young fellow had thus lost two admirable women , and that probably the little Australian was equally inferior to Miss Marjoribanks and Mrs Brown . He ought to have been grateful that Dr Rider had left the latter lady to his own superior discrimination — and so he was ; and yet it gave him a certain odd satisfaction to think that the Doctor was not so happy as he might have been . He went away fully warranted to receive Dr Rider 's proposition , and even , to a certain extent , to decide upon it — and Lucilla threw herself back in her chair in the silent drawing - room , from which Aunt Jemima had discreetly withdrawn , and began to think over the reality of her position as she now saw it for the first time . The sense of bewildering revolution and change was over ; for , strangely enough , the greater a change is the more easily the mind , after the first shock , accepts and gets accustomed to it . It was over , and the world felt steady once more under Lucilla 's feet , and she sat down , not precisely amid the ruins of her happiness , but still in the presence of many an imagination overthrown , to look at her real position . It was not , after all , utter poverty , misery , and destitution , as at the first glance she had believed . According to what John Brown had said , and a rapid calculation which Lucilla had herself made in passing , something approaching two hundred a year would be left to her — just a small single woman 's revenue , as she thought to herself . Two hundred a year ! All at once there came into Miss Marjoribanks 's mind a sudden vision of the two Miss Ravenswoods , who had lived in that pretty set of rooms over Elsworthy 's shop , facing into Grange Lane , and who had kept a lady 's maid , and asked the best people in the place to tea , upon a very similar income , and how their achievements had been held up to everybody as a model of what genteel economy could do . She thought of them , and her heart sank within her ; for it was not in Lucilla 's nature to live without a sphere , nor to disjoin herself from her fellow - creatures , nor to give up entirely the sovereign position she had held for so many years . Whatever she might ultimately do , it was clear that , in the meantime , she could not make up her mind to any such giving up of the battle as that . And then there was the house . She might let it to the Riders , and add probably another hundred a year to her income ; for though it was an excellent house , and worth more than a hundred a year , still there was no competition for houses in Grange Lane , and the new Doctor was the only probable tenant . And , to tell the truth , though Lucilla was very reasonable , it went to her heart at the present moment to think of letting the house to the new Doctor , and having the patients come as usual , and the lamp lighted as of old , and nothing changed except the central figure of all . She ought to have been above such sentimental ideas when a whole hundred pounds a year was in question ; but she was not , which of itself was a strange phenomenon . If she could have made up her mind to that , there were a great many things that she might have done . She might still have gone abroad , and to some extent taken a limited share in what was going on in some section of English society on the Continent . Or she might have gone to one of the mild centres of a similar kind of life in England . But such a prospect did not offer many attractions to Miss Marjoribanks . If she had been rich , it would have been different . Thus there gradually dawned upon her the germ of the plan she ultimately adopted , and which was the only one that commended itself to her feelings . Going away was expensive and troublesome at the best ; and even at Elsworthy 's , if she could have made up her mind to such an expedient , she would have been charged a pound a week for the rooms alone , not to speak of all kinds of extras , and never having the satisfaction of feeling yourself in your own place . Under all the circumstances , it was impressed upon Lucilla 's mind that her natural course was to stay still where she was , and make no change . Why should she make any change ? The house was her own , and did not cost anything , and if Nancy would but stand by her and one good maid —— It was a venture ; but still Lucilla felt as if she might be equal to it . Though she was no mathematician , Miss Marjoribanks was very clever at mental arithmetic in a practical sort of way . She put down lines upon lines of figures in her head while she sat musing in her chair , and worked them out with wonderful skill and speed and accuracy . And the more she thought of it , the more it seemed to her that this was the thing to do . Why should she retreat and leave her native soil and the neighbourhood of all her friends because she was poor and in trouble ? Lucilla was not ashamed of being poor — nor even frightened by it , now that she understood what it was — any more than she would have been frightened , after the first shock , had her poverty even been much more absolute . She was standing alone at this moment as upon a little island of as yet undisturbed seclusion and calm , and she knew very well that outside a perfect sea of good advice would surge round her as soon as she was visible . In these circumstances Lucilla took by instinct the only wise course : she made up her mind there and then with a perfect unanimity which is seldom to be gained when counsellors are admitted . And what she decided upon , as was to be expected from her character , was not to fly from her misfortune and the scene of it , but to confront fate and take up her lawful burden and stay still in her own house . It was the wisest and the easiest , and at the same time the most heroic course to adopt , and she knew beforehand that it was one which would be approved of by nobody . All this Lucilla steadily faced and considered and made up her mind to while she sat alone ; although silence and solitude and desolation seemed to have suddenly come in and taken possession all around her of the once gay and brilliant room . She had just made her final decision when she was rejoined by her aunt , who , everybody said , was at this trying moment like a mother to Lucilla . Yet Aunt Jemima , too , had changed a little since her brother - in - law 's death . She was very fond of Miss Marjoribanks , and meant every word she had said about giving her a home , and still meant it . But she did not feel so certain now as she had done about Tom 's love for his cousin , nor at all anxious to have him come home just at this moment ; and for another thing , she had got a way of prowling about the house and looking at the furniture in a speculative , auctioneering sort of way . "
201044	201052	201054	201054	I	0	" Aunt Jemima had said to herself , "
201099	201270	201348	201348	he	4009	" With this idea Mrs John gave herself a great deal of unnecessary fatigue , and gave much offence to the servants by making pilgrimages all over the house , turning up at the most unlikely places and poking about in the least frequented rooms . It was a perfectly virtuous and even amiable thing to do , for it was better , as she reasoned , that they should go to her than to a stranger , and it would be nice for Lucilla to feel that she had some of the old things about her ; but then such delicate motives are seldom appreciated by the homely critics downstairs . It was with something of this same air that she came into the drawing - room , where Lucilla was . She could not help laying her hand in a suggestive sort of way on a small table which she had to pass , as if she were saying to herself ( as indeed she was saying ) , "
201306	201346	201348	201348	he	4009	" Such were the ideas with which Aunt Jemima 's mind was filled . But yet she came forward with a great deal of sympathy and curiosity , and forgot about the furniture in presence of her afflicted niece . "
201355	201360	201348	201348	he	4009	" said Mrs John ; "
201377	201378	201363	201363	he	4009	" "
201390	201402	201384	201384	you	0	" said Lucilla , with a sudden rush of softer thoughts ; "
201470	201518	201519	201519	He	4009	" sobbed Miss Marjoribanks . It may be supposed it was an abrupt transition from her calculations ; but after all it was only a different branch of the same subject ; and Lucilla in all her life had never before shed such poignant and tender tears . "
201527	201530	201524	201525	Poor Lucilla	119	" said Mrs John—"brought
201559	201567	201524	201525	Poor Lucilla	119	" Aunt Jemima added , correcting herself , "
201585	201622	201524	201525	Poor Lucilla	119	" And then Lucilla unfolded John Brown 's further particulars to her surprised hearer . Mrs John lived upon a smallish income herself , and she was not so contemptuous of the two hundred a year . "
201627	201629	201524	201525	Poor Lucilla	119	" she said—"the
201685	201707	201675	201675	you	4008	" Aunt Jemima added , half regretfully , for she did feel that she would be sorry to lose that chiffonier . "
201717	201721	201722	201722	you	4008	" said Lucilla ; "
201741	201742	201732	201732	I	0	" "
201748	202738	202740	202740	she	4020	" Mrs John said , with a gasp . She did not think it silly , but simple madness , and so she told her niece . If Lucilla could not make up her mind to Elsworthy 's , there was Brighton and Bath and Cheltenham , and a hundred other places where a single woman might be very comfortable on three hundred a year . And to lose a third part of her income for a piece of sentiment was so utterly unlike any conception Aunt Jemima had ever formed of her niece . It was unlike Miss Marjoribanks ; but there are times of life when even the most reasonable people are inconsistent . Lucilla , though she felt it was open to grave criticism , felt only more confirmed in her resolution by her aunt 's remarks . She heard a voice Aunt Jemima could not hear , and that voice said , Stay ! It must be allowed that Lucilla 's decision caused very general surprise in Carlingford , where people had been disposed to think that she would be rather glad , now that things were so changed , to get away . To be sure it was not known for some time ; but everybody 's idea was that , being thus left alone in the world , and in circumstances so reduced , Miss Marjoribanks naturally would go to live with somebody . Perhaps with her aunt , who had something , though she was not rich ; perhaps , after a little , to visit about among her friends , of whom she had so many . Nobody doubted that Lucilla would abdicate at once , and a certain uneasy , yet delicious , sense of freedom had already stolen into the hearts of some of the ladies in Grange Lane . They lamented , it is true , the state of chaos into which everything would fall , and the dreadful loss Miss Marjoribanks would be to society ; but still , freedom is a noble thing , and Lucilla 's subjects contemplated their emancipation with a certain guilty delight . It was , at the same time , a most fertile subject of discussion in Carlingford , and gave rise to all those lively speculations and consultations , and oft - renewed comparing of notes , which take the place of bets in the feminine community . The Carlingford ladies as good as betted upon Lucilla , whether she would go with her aunt , or pay Mrs Beverley a visit at the Deanery , or retire to Mount Pleasant for a little , where those good old Miss Blounts were so fond of her . Each of these opinions had its backers , if it is not profane to say so ; and the discussion which of them Miss Marjoribanks would choose waxed very warm . It almost put the election out of people 's heads ; and indeed the election had been sadly damaged in interest and social importance by the sad and most unexpected event which had just happened in Grange Lane . But when the fact was really known , it would be difficult to describe the sense of guilt and horror which filled many innocent bosoms . The bound of freedom had been premature — liberty and equality had not come yet , notwithstanding that too early unwise élan of republican satisfaction . It was true that she was in deep mourning , and that for a year , at least , society must be left to its own devices ; and it was true , also , that she was poor — which might naturally be supposed a damper upon her energies — but , at the same time , Carlingford knew its Lucilla . As long as she remained in Grange Lane , even though retired and in crape , the constitutional monarch was still present among her subjects ; and nobody could usurp her place or show that utter indifference to her regulations which some revolutionaries had dreamed of . Such an idea would have gone direct in the face of the British Constitution , and the sense of the community would have been dead against it . But everybody who had speculated upon her proceedings disapproved of Lucilla in her most unlooked - for resolution . Some could not think how she could bear it , staying on there when everything was so changed ; and some said it was a weakness they could never have believed to exist in her ; and some — for there are spiteful people everywhere — breathed the names of Cavendish and Ashburton , the rival candidates , and hinted that Miss Marjoribanks had something in her mind to justify her lingering . If Lucilla had not been supported by a conscious sense of rectitude , she must have broken down before this universal disapprobation . Not a soul in the world except one supported her in her resolution , and that was perhaps , of all others , the one least likely to be able to judge . And it was not for want of opportunity to go elsewhere . Aunt Jemima , as has been seen , did not lose an instant in offering the shelter of her house to her niece ; and Mrs Beverley wrote the longest , kindest , most incoherent letter begging her dear Lucilla to come to her immediately for a long visit , and adding , that though she had to go out a good deal into society , she need n't mind , for that everything she could think of would be done to make her comfortable ; to which Dr Beverley himself , who was now a dean , added an equally kind postscript , begging Miss Marjoribanks to make her home at the Deanery "
202748	202749	202740	202740	she	4020	" "
202760	202787	202750	202750	He	4021	" Lucilla said , when she folded up the letter — and this was a terrible mode of expression to the genteel ears of Mrs John . "
202800	202805	202790	202790	you	0	" said Aunt Jemima ; "
202863	202875	202879	202879	aunt	4025	to,"—which was a very handsome thing of Aunt Jemima to say . "
202881	202927	202928	202928	She	4026	" said Lucilla , but she sighed ; for , though it was very kind , what was Miss Marjoribanks to have done with herself in such a dowager establishment ? And then Colonel Chiley came in , who had also his proposal to make . "
202932	202937	202928	202928	She	4026	" the Colonel said ; "
202979	202980	202969	202969	she	4026	" "
202985	202997	202981	202983	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" Miss Marjoribanks said , unable to resist the old affection ; "
203010	203046	203002	203002	she	4026	" Lucilla added . She knew it was quite natural , and perhaps quite necessary , but then it did seem hard that his own friends should be the first to replace her dear papa . "
203053	203058	203049	203049	I	0	" said the Colonel . "
203096	203097	203085	203085	I	0	" "
203102	203109	203085	203085	I	0	" said Lucilla , with penitence , "
203125	203202	203203	203203	She	4026	" It was hard upon the Colonel to stand by and see a woman cry . It was a thing he could never stand , as he had always said to his wife . He took the poker , which was his favourite resource , and made one of his tremendous dashes at the fire , to give Lucilla time to recover herself , and then he turned to Aunt Jemima , who sat pensively by : "
203207	203221	203203	203203	She	4026	" said the Colonel , who did not think his wife needed any other name—"not
203310	203398	203303	203303	somebody	312	" The old Colonel was standing before the fire , wavering a little on his long unsteady old legs , and looking wonderfully well preserved , and old and feeble ; and Lucilla , though she was in mourning , was so full of life and force in her way . It was a curious sort of protection to offer her , and yet it was real protection , and love and succour , though , Heaven knows ! it might not perhaps last out the year . "
203413	203418	203403	203404	Colonel Chiley	103	" said Aunt Jemima , "
203470	203471	203463	203463	she	4026	" "
203483	203488	203478	203478	she	4026	" said the Colonel . "
203527	203560	203521	203521	she	4026	" said Aunt Jemima , in a resigned and doleful voice . As for the Colonel , he was petrified , and for a long time had not a word to say . "
203573	203579	203566	203566	she	4026	" said the old soldier . "
203655	203660	203663	203663	your	119	" said Colonel Chiley . "
203716	203730	203732	203732	she	4026	" said the Colonel , with anxiety and consternation mingling in his face . "
203741	203783	203732	203732	she	4026	" said Aunt Jemima , in a sepulchral voice . There was something in the word that seemed to carry out to a point of reality much beyond anything he had dreamt of , the suggestion Colonel Chiley had just made . "
203798	203804	203793	203793	you	119	" said the old soldier . "
203835	203873	203822	203822	She	4026	" the Colonel said . They were all very sad and grave , and yet it was a droll scene ; and then the old hero offered Lucilla his arm , and led her to the door . "
203888	204023	203874	203874	You	119	" he said , in tones half gruff , half tender , and was glad to go downstairs , though it was cold , and put on his greatcoat with the aid of Thomas , and stand warming the tips of his boots at the hall fire . As for Lucilla , she obeyed him without a word ; and it was with his unsteady but kind old arm to lean upon that she first saw how the familiar world looked through the mist of this strange change that had come over it , and through the blackness of her crape veil . But though she succeeded in satisfying her friends that she had made up her mind , she did not secure their approval . There were so many objections to her plan . "
204044	204052	204042	204042	Lucilla	119	" Mrs Chiley said , with tears ; "
204064	204171	204054	204054	I	0	" So the good old lady spoke , looking round her pretty room , which was so warm and cheery and bright , and where the Colonel , neat and precise as if he had come out of a box , was standing poking the fire . It looked all very solid and substantial , and yet it was as unstable as any gossamer that the careless passenger might brush away . The two good people were so old that they had forgotten to remember they were old . But neither did Lucilla think of that . This was really what she thought and partly said : "
204243	204662	204230	204230	I	0	" This was the general scope , without going into all the details , of what Lucilla said . But , at the same time , though she was so happy as not to be disturbed in her decision , or made uncomfortable , either by lamentation or remonstrance , and had no doubt in her mind that she was doing right , it was disagreeable to Miss Marjoribanks to go thus in the face of all her friends . She went home by herself , and the house did look dreary from the outside . It was just as it had always been , for none of the servants were dismissed as yet , nor any external change made ; but still a look as if it had fallen asleep — a look as if it too had died somehow , and only pretended to be a house and home — was apparent , in the aspect of the place ; and when the servants were gone , and nobody remained except Lucilla and her faithful Nancy , and a young maid — which must be the furthest limit of Miss Marjoribanks 's household , and difficult enough to maintain upon two hundred a year — what would it look like ? This thought was more discouraging than any remonstrances ; and it was with a heavy heart that Lucilla re - entered her solitary house . She told Thomas to follow her upstairs ; and when she sank , tired , into a chair , and put up her veil before commencing to speak to him , it was all she could do to keep from crying . The depressing influences of this sad week had told so much on her , that she was quite fatigued by her walk to see Mrs Chiley ; and Thomas , too , knew why he had been called , and stood in a formal manner before her , with his hands crossed , against the closed door . When she put back her thick black veil , the last climax of painful change came upon Miss Marjoribanks . She did not feel as if she were Lucilla ; so discouraged and depressed and pale , and tired with her walk as she was , with all sorts of projects and plans so quenched out of her ; almost if she had been charged with being somebody else , the imputation was one which she could not have denied . "
204665	204670	204663	204663	Thomas	117	" she said faintly , "
204714	204715	204704	204704	I	0	" "
204728	204738	204722	204722	Miss	4054	" said Thomas , when Lucilla 's utterance failed . "
204759	204760	204704	204704	I	0	" "
204773	204783	204704	204704	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , after a little pause , "
204831	204832	204826	204826	I	0	" "
204838	204849	204836	204836	Miss	4059	" said Thomas ; and then he made a pause . "
204908	204909	204901	204901	nobody	4434	" "
204918	204947	204916	204916	Thomas	117	" said Lucilla , who cheered up a little in ready interest , and would have been very glad if she could have taken a little business too . "
204973	204980	204988	204988	Miss	4067	" said Thomas , with a deprecating air—"not
205078	205089	205090	205090	I	0	" said Thomas , who naturally took the defensive side . "
205098	205136	205093	205093	you	0	" said Lucilla , cheering up more and more , and instinctively , with her old statesmanlike breadth of view , throwing a rapid glance upon the subject to see what capabilities there might be in it ; "
205161	205162	205167	205168	the candidates	4074	" "
205172	205176	205170	205170	Miss	4389	" said Thomas , "
205192	205193	205179	205190	addressing of the bargemen at the top o ' Prickett 's Lane	4076	" "
205196	205209	205179	205190	addressing of the bargemen at the top o ' Prickett 's Lane	4076	" said Lucilla ; and a deep sigh escaped from her bosom . "
205229	205230	205233	205233	Miss	4079	" "
205235	205245	205233	205233	Miss	4079	" said Thomas , with great confusion and embarrassment ; "
205261	205262	205263	205263	Betsy	102	" "
205265	205452	205263	205263	Betsy	102	" said Lucilla , with dismay ; for it had been Betsy she had specially fixed upon as the handy , willing , cheerful maid who , when there was no gentleman coming in , and little else to do , might keep even this big house in order . She sighed ; but it was not in her power , even if she had desired it , to put any restriction upon Betsy 's wishes . And it was not without a momentary envy that she received the intelligence . It was life the housemaid was about to enter on — active life of her own , with an object and meaning — clogged by Thomas , no doubt , who did not appear to Lucilla as the bright spot in the picture — but still independent life ; whereas her mistress knew of nothing particularly interesting in her own uncertain future . She was roused from her momentary meditation by the distant shouts which came from the top of Prickett 's Lane , and sighed again , without knowing it , as she spoke . "
205466	205476	205461	205461	your	4080	" said Lucilla , for the sake of euphony , "
205505	205506	205496	205496	I	0	" "
205519	205524	205517	205517	Miss	4082	" said Thomas eagerly ; "
205561	205562	205549	205549	he	4083	" "
205573	205599	205549	205549	he	4083	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; and she got up from her chair with a sense that she was still not altogether useless in the world . "
205658	205677	205652	205652	you	117	" said Lucilla . She had been dreadfully down , but the rebound was all the more grateful . "
205698	205931	205688	205688	Heaven	136	" she said to herself when she was alone . And she threw off her shawl , and began to make the drawing - room look like itself ; not that it was not perfectly in order , and as neat as a room could be ; but still the neatness savoured of Betsy , and not of Lucilla . Miss Marjoribanks , in five minutes , made it look like that cosy empire of hospitality and kindness and talk and wit , and everything pleasant , that it used to be ; and then , when she had finished , she sat down and had a good cry , which did not do her any harm . Then Nancy appeared , disturbed in her preparations for dinner , and with her arms wrapped in her apron , looking glum and defiant . Hers was not the resigned and resourceful preparation for her fate which had appeared in Thomas . She came in , and put the door ajar , and leant her back against the sharp edge . She might be sent off like the rest , if that was Miss Lucilla 's meaning — her that had been in the house off and on for more than thirty years ; but if it was so , at least she would not give up without unfolding a bit of her mind . "
205935	205941	205688	205688	Heaven	136	" said Lucilla , drying her eyes—"come
205979	206015	205969	205969	I	0	" Nancy shut the door , but she thought to herself that she knew what all this meant , and made but a very little movement into the room , looking more forbidding than ever . "
206034	206081	206082	206082	Nancy	102	" she said ; and stood firm to meet the shock , with her arms folded under her apron , thinking in her heart that it was about one of the almshouses , her horror and hope , that her young mistress was going to speak . "
206084	206088	206089	206089	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
206190	206220	206183	206183	I	0	" Nancy 's distrust and defiance gave way a little before this appeal . She came a step nearer , and let the apron drop from her folded arms . "
206237	206253	206227	206227	I	0	" she said , building a kind of intrenchment round her with the nearest chairs . "
206261	206265	206254	206254	You	102	" said Lucilla , "
206368	206398	206365	206365	Nancy	102	" But Nancy could not hear any more . She made a little rush forward , with a kind of convulsive chuckling that was half sobbing and half laughter . "
206403	206432	206365	206365	Nancy	102	" cried Dr Marjoribanks 's famous cook , who had spent a fortune on her gravy - beef alone , and was one of the most expensive people in Carlingford—"me
206454	206505	206442	206442	me	0	" cried the devoted woman . She was in such a state of hysterical flutter and excitement that Lucilla had to take her almost into her arms and put the old woman into a chair and bring her to , which was an occupation quite in Miss Marjoribanks 's way . "
206516	206520	206442	206442	me	0	" said Lucilla . "
206559	206568	206548	206548	You	102	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a sigh . "
206579	206586	206571	206572	Miss Lucilla	119	" said Nancy , with tears . "
206713	206820	206822	206822	he	4106	" said Nancy , with a sob . And then his daughter and his faithful old servant cried a little in company over Dr Marjoribanks 's vacant place . What could a man have more ? Nobody was made altogether desolate by his death , nor was any heart broken , but they wept for him honestly , though the old woman felt happy in her sorrow . And Lucilla , on her knees before the fire , told Nancy of that exclamation the Doctor had made in John Brown 's office , and how he had put his hand on her shoulder that last night . "
206829	206834	206835	206835	he	4106	" sobbed Miss Marjoribanks ; "
206852	207092	206835	206835	he	4106	" and once more that touch of something more exquisite than was usual to her went sharply down into Lucilla 's heart and brought up tenderer and deeper tears . She felt all the better for it after , and was even a little cheerful in the evening , and like herself ; and thus it will be seen that one person in Carlingford — not , it is true , a popular oracle , but of powerful influence and first - rate importance in a practical point of view — gave the heartiest approbation to Miss Marjoribanks 's scheme for her new life . Lucilla 's calculations were fully justified by the result . Twenty times in a day she recognised the wisdom of her own early decision , which was made while she was still by herself , and before anybody had come in to advise her . If she had left it over until the time when , though much shaken , she was understood to be able to see her friends , it is just possible that the whirlwind of popular opinion which raged about her might have exercised a distracting influence even upon Miss Marjoribanks 's clear head and steady judgment . For even now , though they saw her in her own house , in her mourning , people would not believe that it was true , and that Lucilla actually intended to make "
207095	207142	207143	207143	Everybody	300	" ; and all that tide of good advice which had been flowing through Carlingford ever since the Doctor 's death in the form of opinion , now rushed in upon her , notwithstanding that all the world knew that she had made up her mind . "
207163	207172	207161	207161	Lucilla	119	" her friends said , in many voices . "
207191	207244	207189	207189	dear	4458	" And this was repeated so often that if Miss Marjoribanks had been weak - minded , she must have ended by believing not only that it was more than she was equal to , but more than she ought to be equal to — which was a more touching argument still . "
207250	207266	207189	207189	dear	4458	" Miss Brown said , who had a great deal of experience in family troubles ; "
207321	207322	207317	207317	you	4108	" "
207332	207336	207328	207328	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
207353	207358	207345	207345	you	4108	" said her adviser ; "
207475	207476	207481	207481	I	0	" "
207484	207555	207481	207481	I	0	" said Lucilla meekly ; and then the conversation was interrupted by that afternoon cup of tea , which Nancy could not be got to think was an extravagance , and around which , to tell the truth , the Grange Lane ladies began to resume their habit of gathering — though Miss Marjoribanks , of course , was still quite unequal to society — as in the old times . "
207568	207578	207566	207566	Lucilla	119	" Mrs Centum said , who had joined them , "
207712	207713	207704	207704	Nancy	102	" "
207721	207752	207704	207704	Nancy	102	" said Lady Richmond , who had driven in expressly to add her mite to the treasure of precious counsel , of which Miss Marjoribanks was making so little use , "
207807	207808	207800	207800	I	0	" "
207813	207835	207800	207800	I	0	" said Lucilla , making a desperate stand , and setting , as it were , her back against a rock , "
207878	207886	207866	207866	You	4108	" said Lucilla , with a sob , "
207898	207920	207930	207930	she	4122	" And then there was a pause , for this was an argument against which nobody could find anything to say . "
207938	207943	207930	207930	she	4122	" said Aunt Jemima . "
208083	208084	208056	208056	she	4122	" "
208106	208119	208056	208056	she	4122	" said Lady Richmond , who took a serious view of everything , "
208125	208126	208056	208056	she	4122	" "
208131	208166	208056	208056	she	4122	" Aunt Jemima said , faltering a little ; and then a pink blush , which seemed strangely uncalled for in such a mild little tea - party , came over her mature countenance ; "
208202	208207	208195	208195	I	0	" she added hurriedly , "
208220	208504	208217	208217	Tom	117	" And then she caught Lucilla 's eye , and grew more confused than ever . What could she have to be confused about ? If Tom did make a call upon her time , whatever that might mean , there was nothing in it to call a blush upon his mother 's face . And the fact was , that a letter had come from Tom a day or two before , of which , contrary to all her usual habits , Aunt Jemima had taken no notice to Lucilla . These were things which would have roused Miss Marjoribanks 's curiosity if she had been able to think about anything , as she said . But her visitors were taking their cup of tea all the time , in a melancholy , half - sympathetic , half - disapproving way , and they could not be expected to see anything particularly interesting in Aunt Jemima 's blush . And then Rose Lake came in from Grove Street , who was rather an unusual visitor , and whose appearance , though they were all very kind and gracious to her , rather put the others to flight ; for nobody had ever quite forgotten or forgiven Barbara 's brief entrance into society and flirtation with Mr Cavendish , which might be said to have been the beginning of all that happened to him in Grange Lane . As for Mrs Centum , she took her leave directly , and pressed Lucilla 's hand , and could not help saying in her ear that she hoped the other was not coming back to Carlingford to throw herself in poor Mr Cavendish 's way . "
208513	208519	208217	208217	Tom	117	" Mrs Centum said anxiously ; "
208535	208536	208528	208528	you	119	" "
208544	208553	208528	208528	you	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with plaintive meaning ; "
208573	208574	208567	208567	she	99	" "
208584	208593	208579	208579	she	99	" said Mrs Centum , with righteous indignation . "
208638	208670	208626	208626	you	119	" she added , with all the warmth of friendship ! And then they were joined at the door by the county lady , who was the next to go away . "
208684	208765	208766	208766	I	0	" Lady Richmond said as she went away ; but she gave a deep sigh as she kissed Lucilla , and looked as if she had very little faith in the efficacy of her own wish . Maria Brown had withdrawn to another part of the drawing - room with Aunt Jemima , so that Lucilla was , so to speak , left alone with Rose . And Rose , too , had come with the intention of giving advice . "
208776	208780	208774	208774	Lucilla	119	" she said , "
208832	208833	208817	208817	you	119	" "
208839	208844	208834	208834	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
208870	208871	208875	208875	me	0	" "
208877	208910	208875	208875	me	0	" said poor little Rose , whose Career had been sacrificed ten years ago , and who was a little misanthropical now , and did not believe even in Schools of Design ; "
208995	209024	209025	209025	I	0	" said Rose , with energetic emphasis . She made a pause there , and she was so much in earnest that the tears came into her eyes . "
209078	209200	209073	209074	a mother	4424	" said Rose ; and here she stopped short , altogether overcome by her own magnificent conception of what her friend could or might do . Aunt Jemima and Miss Brown , who had drawn near out of curiosity , stared at Rose as if they thought she had gone mad ; but Lucilla , who was of a larger mind and more enlightened ideas , neither laughed nor looked horrified . She did not make a very distinct answer , it is true , but she was very kind to her new adviser , and made her a fresh cup of tea , and even consented , though in an ambiguous way , to the principle she had just enunciated , "
209211	209215	209202	209202	you	4144	" Lucilla said , "
209245	209381	209230	209230	I	0	" But she did not commit herself any further , and Rose too found the result of her visit unsatisfactory , and went home disappointed in Lucilla . This was how the afternoon passed ; and at the end of such a day , it may well be imagined how Miss Marjoribanks congratulated herself on having made up her mind before the public , so to speak , were admitted . For Rose was followed by the Rector , who , though he did not propose in so many words a House of Mercy , made no secret of his conviction that parish - work was the only thing that could be of any service to Lucilla ; and that , in short , such was the inevitable and providential destination of a woman who had "
209385	209411	209230	209230	I	0	" Indeed , to hear Mr Bury , a stranger would have been disposed to believe that Dr Marjoribanks had been , as he said , "
209414	210918	209230	209230	I	0	" and his fortune swept away , all in order to indicate to Lucilla the proper sphere for her energies . In the face of all this it will be seen how entirely Miss Marjoribanks 's wisdom in making her decision by herself before her advisers broke in upon her , was justified . She could now set her back against her rock , and face her assailants , as Fitz - James did . might have been her utterance ; but she was not in a defiant mood . She kissed all her counsellors that day ( except , of course , the Rector ) , and heard them out with the sweetest patience ; and then she thought to herself how much better it was that she had made up her mind to take her own way . Notwithstanding , all this commotion of public opinion about her made a certain impression upon Miss Marjoribanks 's mind . It was not unpleasant to feel that , for this moment at least , she was the centre of the thoughts of the community , and that almost everybody in Carlingford had taken the trouble to frame an ideal existence for her , according as he or she regarded life . It is so seldom that any one has it in his power , consciously and evidently , to regulate his life for himself , and make it whatever he wants it to be . And then , at the same time , the best that she could make of it would , after all , be something very limited and unsatisfactory . In her musings on this subject , Lucilla could not but go back a great many times to that last conversation she had with her father , when she walked up Grange Lane with him that night over the thawed and muddy snow . The Doctor had said she was not cut out for a single woman ; and Lucilla , with candour , yet a certain philosophical speculativeness , had allowed that she was not — unless , indeed , she could be very rich . If she had been very rich , the prospect would no doubt have been , to a certain extent , different . And then , oddly enough , it was Rose Lake 's suggestion which came after this to Lucilla 's mind . She did not smile at it as some people might expect she would . One thing was quite sure , that she had no intention of sinking into a nobody , and giving up all power of acting upon her fellow - creatures ; and she could not help being conscious of the fact that she was able to be of much use to her fellow - creatures . If it had been Maria Brown , for instance , who had been concerned , the whole question would have been one of utter unimportance , except to the heroine itself ; but it was different in Miss Marjoribanks 's case . The House of Mercy was not a thing to be taken into any serious consideration ; but still there was something in the idea which Lucilla could not dismiss carelessly as her friends could . She had no vocation , such as the foundress of such an establishment ought to have , nor did she see her way to the abandonment of all projects for herself , and that utter devotion to the cause of humanity which would be involved in it ; but yet , when a woman happens to be full of energy and spirit , and determined that whatever she may be she shall certainly not be a nonentity , her position is one that demands thought . She was very capable of serving her fellow - creatures , and very willing and well disposed to serve them ; and yet she was not inclined to give herself up entirely to them , nor to relinquish her personal prospects — vague though these might be . It was a tough problem , and one which might have caused a most unusual disturbance in Lucilla 's well - regulated mind , had not she remembered all at once what deep mourning she was in , and that at present no sort of action , either of one kind or another , could be expected of her . There was no need for making a final decision , either about the parish - work , or about taking Inmates , as Aunt Jemima proposed , or about any other single suggestion which had been offered to her ; no more than there was any necessity for asking what her cousin Tom 's last letter had been about , or why his mother looked so guilty and embarrassed when she spoke of him . Grief has its privileges and exemptions , like other great principles of life ; and the recollection that she could not at present be expected to be able to think about anything , filled Lucilla 's mind with the most soothing sense of consolation and refreshing calm . And then other events occurred to occupy her friends ; the election for one thing began to grow a little exciting , and took away some of the superfluous energy of Grange Lane . Mr Ashburton had carried all before him at first ; but since the Rector had come into the field , the balance had changed a little . Mr Bury was very Low - Church ; and from the moment at which he was persuaded that Mr Cavendish was a great penitent , the question as to which was the Man for Carlingford had been solved in his mind in the most satisfactory way . A man who intrenched himself in mere respectability , and trusted in his own good character , and considered himself to have a clear conscience , and to have done his duty , had no chance against a repentant sinner . Mr Cavendish , perhaps , had not done his duty quite so well ; but then he was penitent , and everything was expressed in that word . The Rector was by no means contemptible , either as an adversary or a supporter — and the worst of it was that , in embracing Mr Cavendish 's claims , he could scarcely help speaking of Mr Ashburton as if he was in a very bad way . And feeling began to rise rather high in Carlingford . If anything could have deepened the intensity of Miss Marjoribanks 's grief , it would have been to know that all this was going on , and that affairs might go badly with her candidate , while she was shut up , and could give no aid . It was hard upon her , and it was hard upon the candidates themselves — one of whom had thus become generally disapproved of , without , so far as he knew , doing anything to deserve it ; while the other occupied the still more painful character of being on his promotion — a repentant man , with a character to keep up . It was no wonder that Mrs Centum grew pale at the very idea of such a creature as Barbara Lake throwing herself in poor Mr Cavendish 's way . A wrong step one way or other — a relapse into the ways of wickedness — might undo in a moment all that it had cost so much trouble to do . And the advantage of the Rector 's support was thus grievously counterbalanced by what might be called the uncertainty of it — especially as Mr Cavendish was not , as his committee lamented secretly among themselves , a man of strong will or business habits , in whom implicit confidence could be placed . He might get restive , and throw the Rector over just at the critical moment ; or he might relapse into his lazy Continental habits , and give up church - going and other good practices . But still , up to this moment , he had shown very tolerable perseverance ; and Mr Bury 's influence thrown into his scale had equalised matters very much , and made the contest very exciting . All this Lucilla heard , not from Mr Cavendish , but from her own candidate , who had taken to calling in a steady sort of way . He never went into any effusions of sympathy , for he was not that kind of man ; but he would shake hands with her , and say that people must submit to the decrees of Providence ; and then he would speak of the election and of his chances . Sometimes Mr Ashburton was despondent , and then Lucilla cheered him up ; and sometimes he had very good hopes . "
210929	210938	210919	210919	I	0	" he said on one of these occasions . "
210978	210979	210968	210968	you	4146	" "
210988	210992	210986	210986	mine	4146	" said Lucilla . "
211033	211034	210986	210986	mine	4146	" "
211037	211047	210986	210986	mine	4146	" said Mr Ashburton , in his steady way . "
211107	211135	211136	211136	You	4146	" Upon which Miss Marjoribanks smiled upon Mr Ashburton , and held out her hands to him with a gesture and look which said more than words . "
211146	211172	211138	211138	you	4146	" she said ; and the candidate was much moved — more moved than at such a moment he had thought it possible to be . "
211186	211359	211361	211361	she	4150	" he said fervently ; and then , as this was a climax , and it would have been a kind of bathos to plunge into ordinary details after it , Mr Ashburton got up , still holding Lucilla 's hand , and clasped it almost tenderly as he said good - bye . She looked very well in her mourning , though she had not expected to do so ; for black was not Lucilla 's style . And the fact was , that instead of having gone off , as she herself said , Miss Marjoribanks looked better than ever she did , and was even embellished by the natural tears which still shone by times in her eyes . Mr Ashburton went out in a kind of bewilderment after this interview , and forgot his overcoat in the hall , and had to come back for it , which was a confusing circumstance ; and then he went on his way with a gentle excitement which was not unpleasant . "
211366	211553	211555	211555	she	4151	" he said to himself , as he went up Grange Lane . Perhaps he was only asking himself whether Lucilla would or could be present along with Lady Richmond and her family at the window of the Blue Boar on the great day ; but if that was it , the idea had a certain brightening and quickening influence upon his face and his movements . The doubt he had on the subject , whatever it was , was not a discouraging , but a piquant , stimulating , exciting doubt . He had all but proposed the question to his committee when he went in among them , which would have filled these gentlemen with wonder and dismay . But though he did not do that , he carried it home with him , as he trotted back to the Firs to dinner . Mr Ashburton took a walk through his own house that evening , and examined all its capabilities — with no particular motive , as he was at pains to explain to his housekeeper ; and again he said to himself , "
211560	211935	211555	211555	she	4151	" before he retired for the night ; which was no doubt an unusual sort of iteration for so sensible a man , and one so fully occupied with the most important affairs , to make . As for Lucilla , she was not in the way of asking herself any questions at that moment . She was letting things take their course , and not interfering ; and consequently , nothing that happened could be said to be her fault . She carried this principle so far , that even when Aunt Jemima was herself led to open the subject , in a hesitating way , Miss Marjoribanks never even asked a single question about Tom 's last letter . She was in mourning , and that was enough for her . As for appearing at the window of the Blue Boar with Lady Richmond , if that was what Mr Ashburton was curious about , he might have saved himself the trouble of any speculations on the subject . For though Miss Marjoribanks would be very anxious about the election , she would indeed have been ashamed of herself could her feelings have permitted her to appear anywhere in public so soon . Thus , while Mr Ashburton occupied himself much with the question which had taken possession of his mind , Lucilla took a good book , which seemed the best reading for her in her circumstances , and when she had looked after all her straitened affairs in the morning , sat down sweetly in the afternoon quiet of her retirement and seclusion , and let things take their way . As the election approached , it became gradually the one absorbing object of interest in Carlingford . The contest was so equal that everybody took a certain share in it , and became excited as the decisive moment drew nigh . Most of the people in Grange Lane were for Mr Ashburton , but then the Rector , who was a host in himself , was for Mr Cavendish ; and the coquetting of the Dissenting interest , which was sometimes drawn towards the liberal sentiments of the former candidate , but sometimes could not help reflecting that Mr Ashburton "
211937	212174	211557	211557	I	0	" in George Street ; and the fluctuations of the bargemen , who were , many of them , freemen , and a very difficult part of the population , excited the most vivid interest . Young Mr Wentworth , who had but lately come to Carlingford , had already begun to acquire a great influence at Wharfside , where most of the bargees lived , and the steady ones would no doubt have been largely swayed by him had his inclinations been the same as the Rector 's ; but Mr Wentworth , perversely enough , had conceived that intuitive repugnance for Mr Cavendish which a high - principled and not very tolerant young man often feels for the middle - aged individual who still conceives himself to have some right to be called young , and whose antecedents are not entirely beyond suspicion . Mr Wentworth 's disinclination ( and he was a man rather apt to take his own way ) lay like a great boulder across the stream of the Rector 's enthusiasm , and unquestionably interrupted it a little . Both the candidates and both the committees had accordingly work enough to do up to the last moment . Mr Cavendish all at once became a connoisseur in hams , and gave a magnificent order in the most complimentary way to Tozer , who received it with a broad smile , and "
212176	212183	211555	211555	she	4151	" it , as he said . "
212193	212238	212188	212188	he	4152	" the butterman said , not without amusement ; for Tozer was well - to - do , and , except that he felt the honour of a mark of confidence , was not to be moved one way or another by one order . "
212262	212719	212249	212249	Them	4153	" said the true philosopher . Mr Ashburton , on the other side , did not make the impression which his friends thought he ought to have made in Prickett 's Lane ; but at least nobody could say that he did not stick very close to his work . He went at it like a man night and day , and neglected no means of carrying it to a successful issue ; whereas , as Mr Centum and Mr Woodburn mourned in secret to each other , Cavendish required perpetual egging on . He did not like to get up in the morning , and get early to his work . It went against all his habits — as if his habits mattered in the face of so great an emergency ; and in the afternoon it was hard to prevent him from lounging into some of his haunts , which were utterly out of the way of business . He would stay in Masters 's for an hour at a time , though he knew Mr Wentworth , who was Masters 's great patron , did not care for him , and that his favour for such a Tractarian sort of place was bitter to the Rector . Anything for a little idleness and waste of time , poor Mr Centum said , who was two stone lighter on the eve of the election than when the canvass began . Such a contrast would make any man angry . Mr Cavendish was goaded into more activity as the decisive moment approached , and performed what seemed to himself unparalleled feats . But it was only two days before the moment of fate when the accident happened to him which brought such dismay to all his supporters . Our own opinion is , that it did not materially affect the issue of the contest one way or other ; but that was the reverse of the feeling which prevailed in Grange Lane . It was just two days before the election , and all seemed going on sufficiently well . Mr Cavendish had been meeting a Dissenting committee , and it was on leaving them that he found himself at the corner of Grove Street , where , under ordinary circumstances , he had no occasion to be . At a later period he was rather fond of saying that it was not of his own motion that he was there at all , but only in obedience to the committee , which ordered him about like a nigger . The spring afternoon was darkening , and the Dissenters ( almost wholly unimpressed by his arguments , and remarking more strongly than ever where Mr Ashburton "
212722	212777	212781	212781	she	4155	" and how thoroughly everybody knew all about him ) had all dispersed . It was but natural , when Mr Cavendish came to the corner of Grove Street , where , in other days , he had played a very different part , that certain softening influences should take possession of his soul . "
212787	212793	212781	212781	she	4155	" he said to himself ; "
212804	214067	212801	212801	Lucilla	119	" To tell the truth , if there was one person in Carlingford whom he felt a resentment against , it was Lucilla . She had never done him any harm to speak of , and once she had unquestionably done him a great deal of good . But , on the other hand , it was she who first showed herself candidly conscious that he had grown stout , and who all along had supported and encouraged his rival . It was possible , no doubt , that this might be pique ; and , mixed with his anger for her sins against him , Mr Cavendish had , at the same time , a counterbalancing sense that there still remained to him in his life one supereminently wise thing that he still could do — and that was , to go down Grange Lane instantly to the Doctor 's silenced house , and go down on his knees , or do any other absurdity that might be necessary to make Lucilla marry him ; after which act he would henceforward be , pecuniarily and otherwise ( notwithstanding that she was poor ) , a saved man . It did not occur to him that Lucilla would never have married him , even had he gone down on his knees ; but perhaps that would be too much to ask any man to believe of any woman ; and his feeling that this was the right thing to do , rather strengthened than otherwise the revolt of his heart against Lucilla . It was twilight , as we have said , and he had done a hard day 's work , and there was still an hour before dinner which he seemed to have a right to dispose of in his own way ; and he did hesitate at the corner of Grove Street , laying himself open , as it were , to any temptation that might offer itself . Temptations come , as a general rule , when they are sought ; and thus , on the very eve of the election , a grievous accident happened to Mr Cavendish . It might have happened at any time , to be sure , but this was the most inopportune moment possible , and it came accordingly now . For , as he made that pause , some one passed him whom he could not but look after with a certain interest . She went past him with a whisk , as if she too was not without reminiscences . It was not such a figure as a romantic young man would be attracted by on such a sudden meeting , and it was not attraction but recollection that moved Mr Cavendish . It was the figure of a large woman in a large shawl , not very gracefully put on , and making her look very square about the shoulders and bunchy at the neck ; and the robe that was whisked past him was that peculiar kind of faded silk gown which looks and rustles like tin , or some other thin metallic substance . He made that momentary pause at the street corner , and then he went on , slowly , not following her , to be sure , but merely , as he said to himself , pursuing his own course ; for it was just as easy to get into Grange Lane by the farther end as by this end . He went along very slowly , and the lady before him walked quickly , even with something like a bounce of excitement , and went in at Mr Lake 's door long before Mr Cavendish reached it . When he came up on a level with the parlour window , which was partially open though the evening was so cold , Mr Cavendish positively started , notwithstanding the old associations which had been rising in his mind ; for there was pouring forth from the half - open window such a volume of melody as had not been heard for years in Grove Street . Perhaps the voice had lost some of its freshness , but in the surprise of the moment the hearer was not critical ; and its volume and force seemed even greater than before . It has been already mentioned in this history that a contralto had a special charm for Mr Cavendish . He was so struck that he stood stock - still for the moment , not knowing what to make of it ; and then he wavered for another moment , with a sudden sense that the old allegorical crisis had occurred to him , and that Pleasure , in a magnificent gush of song , wooed him on one side , while Duty , with still small voice , called him at the other . He stood still , he wavered — for fifty seconds perhaps the issue was uncertain , and the victim was still within reach of salvation ; but the result in such a case depends very much upon whether a man really likes doing his duty , which is by no means an invariable necessity . Mr Cavendish had in the abstract no sort of desire to do his unless when he could not help it , and consequently his resistance to temptation was very feeble . He was standing knocking at Mr Lake 's door before half the thoughts appropriate to the occasion had got through his mind , and found himself sitting on the little sofa in Mr Lake 's parlour as he used to do ten years ago , before he could explain to himself how he came there . It was all , surely , a kind of enchantment altogether . He was there — he who had been so long away from Carlingford — he who had been so deeply offended by hearing his name seriously coupled with that of Barbara Lake — he who ought to have been anywhere in the world rather than here upon the eve of his election , when all the world was keeping watch over his conduct . And it was Barbara who sat at the piano singing — singing one of the same songs , as if she had spent the entire interval in that occupation , and never had done anything else all these years . The sensation was so strange that Mr Cavendish may be excused for feeling a little uncertainty as to whether or not he was dreaming , which made him unable to answer himself the graver question whether or not he was doing what he ought to do . He did not seem to be able to make out whether it was now or ten years ago — whether he was a young man free to amuse himself , or a man who was getting stout , and upon whom the eyes of an anxious constituency were fixed . And then , after being so virtuous for a length of time , a forbidden pleasure was sweet . Mr Cavendish 's ideas , however , gradually arranged themselves as he sat in the corner of the little haircloth sofa , and began to take in the differences as well as the bewildering resemblances of the present and past . Barbara , like himself , had changed . She did not insult him , as Lucilla had done , by fresh looks and mischievous candour about "
214071	214177	212801	212801	Lucilla	119	" Barbara had gone off , like himself , and , like himself , did not mean to acknowledge it . She had expanded all over , as was natural to a contralto . Her eyes were blacker and more brilliant in a way , but they were eyes which owned an indescribable amount of usage ; and her cheeks , too , wore the deep roses of old , deepened and fixed by wear and tear . Instead of feeling ashamed of himself in her presence , as he had done in Lucilla 's , Mr Cavendish felt somehow consoled and justified and sympathetic . "
214181	214373	214178	214179	Poor soul	4447	" he said to himself , as he sat by while she was singing . She , too , had been in the wars , and had not come out scatheless . She did not reproach him , nor commiserate him , nor look at him with that mixture of wonder and tolerance and pity which other people had manifested . She did not even remark that he had grown stout . He was not a man fallen , fallen , fallen from his high estate , to Barbara . She herself had fallen from the pinnacles of youth , and Mr Cavendish was still a great man in her eyes . She sang for him as she had sung ten years ago , and received him with a flutter of suppressed delight , and in her satisfaction was full of excitement . The hardworked candidate sank deeper and deeper into the corner of the sofa and listened to the music , and felt it very soothing and pleasant , for everybody had united in goading him on rather than petting him for the last month or two of his life . "
214381	214412	214379	214379	yourself	4157	" he said , when the song was over , and Barbara had turned round , as she used to do in old times , on her music - stool ; "
214423	214424	214415	214415	you	4157	" "
214429	214433	214427	214427	you	0	" said Barbara , "
214446	214447	214442	214442	I	0	" "
214453	214458	214450	214450	you	4157	" asked Mr Cavendish . "
214468	214477	214460	214460	I	0	" said Barbara , with her old vehemence ; "
214521	214643	214514	214515	Mr Cavendish	115	" And with that something like a tear came into her eye . She had been knocked about a good deal in the world , and though she had not learned much , still she had learned that she was young no longer , and could not indulge in the caprices of that past condition of existence . Mr Cavendish , for his part , could not but smile at this intimation that he was to be received as a friend , and consequently need not have any fear of Barbara 's fascinations,—as if a woman of her age , worn and gone off as she was , could be supposed dangerous ; but still he was touched by her tone . "
214653	214659	214651	214651	Barbara	120	" said the inconsistent man ; "
214687	214688	214683	214685	very good friends	4161	" "
214691	214705	214683	214685	very good friends	4161	" she said , with a slight touch of annoyance in her voice ; "
214741	214838	214839	214839	I	0	" Mr Cavendish was amused , and he was touched and flattered . Most people had been rather forbearing to him since he came back , putting up with him for old friendship 's sake , or supporting his cause as that of a reformed man , and giving him , on the whole , a sort of patronising humiliating countenance ; and to find somebody in whose eyes he was still the paladin of old times , the Mr Cavendish whom people in Grange Lane were proud of , was balm to his wounded soul . "
214873	214877	214854	214854	you	118	" he said . "
214890	215008	214884	214884	you	118	" Upon which Barbara lifted her black eyes and looked at him as she had scarcely done before . The eyes were as bright as ever , and they were softened a little for the moment out of the stare that seemed to have grown habitual to them ; and her crimson cheeks glowed as of old ; and though she was untidy , and looked worn , and like a creature much buffeted about by wind and waves , she was still what connoisseurs in that article call a fine woman . She looked full at Mr Cavendish , and then she cast down her eyes , as if the sight was too much for her . "
215016	215884	215885	215886	A man	285	" she said , with a certain tremor in her voice ; for he was a man of whom , in the days of her youth , she had been fond in her way . And naturally Mr Cavendish was more touched than ever . He took her hand , and called her Barbara again without any reproof ; and he saw that she trembled , and that his presence here made to the full as great an impression as he had ever done in his palmiest days . Perhaps a greater impression ; for their old commerce had been stormy , and interrupted by many a hurricane ; and Barbara then had , or thought she might have , many strings to her bow , and did not believe that there was only one Mr Cavendish in the world . Now all that was changed : and if this old hope should revive again , it would not be allowed to die away for any gratification of temper . Mr Cavendish did not remember ever to have seen her tremble before , and he too was fond of her in his way . This curious revival did not come to anything of deeper importance , for of course just then Rose came in from her household affairs , and Mr Lake to tea ; and the candidate recollected that it was time for dinner . But father and sister also gave him , in their different ways , a rather flattering reception . Mr Lake had already pledged him his vote , and was full of interest as to how things were going on , and enthusiastic for his success ; and Rose scowled upon him as of old , as on a dangerous character , whose comings and goings could not be seen without apprehension ; which was an unexpected pleasure to a man who had been startled to find how very little commotion his presence made in Grange Lane . He pressed Barbara 's hand as he went away , and went to his dinner with a heart which certainly beat lighter , and a more pleasant sense of returning self - confidence , than he had felt for a long time . When he was coming out of the house , as a matter of course , he met with the chief of his Dissenting supporters , accompanied ( for Mr Bury , as has been said , was very Low - Church , and loved , wherever he could do it , to work in unison with his Dissenting brethren ) by the Rector 's churchwarden , both of whom stopped with a curiously critical air to speak to the Candidate , who had to be every man 's friend for the time being . The look in their eyes sent an icy chill through him , but still the forbidden pleasure had been sweet . As he walked home , he could not help thinking it over , and going back ten years , and feeling a little doubtful about it , whether it was then or now . And as he mused Miss Marjoribanks , whom he could not help continually connecting and contrasting with the other , appeared to him as a kind of jealous Queen Eleanor , who had a right to him , and could take possession at any time , should she choose to make the effort ; while Barbara was a Rosamond , dilapidated indeed , but always ready to receive and console him in her bower . This was the kind of unconscious sentiment he had in his mind , feeling sure , as he mused , that Lucilla would be very glad to marry him , and that it would be very wise on his part to ask her , and was a thing which might still probably come to pass . Of course he could not see into Miss Marjoribanks 's mind , which had travelled such a long way beyond him . He gave a glance up at the windows as he passed her door , and felt a kind of disagreeable satisfaction in seeing how diminished the lights were in the once radiant house . And Lucilla was so fond of a great deal of light ! but she could not afford now to spend as much money upon wax as a Continental church might do . Mr Cavendish had so odd a sense of Lucilla 's power over him , that it gave him a certain pleasure to think of the coming down of her pride and diminution of her lights . But the fact was , that not more than ten minutes after he had passed her door with this reflection , Lucilla , sitting with her good book on the table and her work in her hand , in the room which was not so well lighted as it used to be , heard that Mr Cavendish had been met with coming out of Mr Lake 's , and that Barbara had been singing to him , and that there was no telling what might have happened . "
215900	216062	215885	215886	A man	285	" Thomas said indignantly , who had come to pay his former mistress a visit , and to assure her of his brother - in - law 's vote . He was a little more free - spoken than of old , being now set up , and an independent householder , and calling no man master ; and he was naturally indignant at an occurrence which , regarded in the light of past events , was an insult not only to Carlingford , but to Lucilla . Miss Marjoribanks was evidently startled by the news . She looked up quickly as if she had been about to speak , and then stopped herself and turned her back upon Thomas , and poked the fire in a most energetic way . She had even taken the hearth - brush in her hand to make all tidy after this onslaught , but that was a thing that went to Thomas 's heart . "
216075	216079	215885	215886	A man	285	" said Thomas ; "
216086	216224	216225	216225	I	0	" and there was actually a kind of moisture in his eye as he took that domestic implement out of her hand . Mr Cavendish pitied Lucilla for having less light than of old , and Thomas for being reduced so low as to sweep her own hearth . But Lucilla was very far from pitying her own case . She had been making an effort over herself , and she had come out of it triumphant ; after reading so many good books , it is not to be wondered at if she felt herself a changed and softened and elevated character . She had the means in her hands of doing her candidate 's rival a deadly mischief , and yet , for old friendship 's sake , Lucilla made up her mind to forbear . "
216233	216256	216229	216229	you	4170	" she said , with dignity , holding the hearth - brush , which was in such circumstances elevated into something sublime , "
216341	216353	216354	216355	Good Lord	245	" Thomas was so much struck with this address that he said "
216357	216382	216385	216385	he	4171	" in sheer amazement ; and then he made the necessary vow , and took the hearth - brush out of Lucilla 's hand . "
216394	216399	216385	216385	he	4171	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
216440	216449	216433	216434	Mr Ashburton	222	" Lucilla added , with a little solemnity , "
216462	217029	216452	216452	Thomas	117	" It would be vain to assert that Thomas understood this romantic generosity , but he was taken by surprise , and had relinquished his own liberty in the matter , and had nothing further to say . Indeed he had so little to say downstairs , that Nancy , who was longing for a little gossip , insulted and reviled him , and declared that since he took up with that Betsy there never was a sensible word to be got out of him . And all the time the poor man was burning with this bit of news . Many a man has bartered his free - will before under the influence of female wiles , or so at least history would have us believe ; but few have done it for so poor a compensation as that hearth - brush . Thomas withdrew sore at heart , longing for the election to be over , and kept his word like an honest man ; but notwithstanding , before the evening was over , the fatal news was spreading like fire to every house in Grange Lane . It is probable that Mr Cavendish considered the indulgence above recorded all the more excusable in that it was Saturday night . The nomination was to take place on Monday , and if a man was not to be supposed to be done with his work on the Saturday evening , when could he be expected to have a moment of repose ? He had thought as he went home — for naturally , while putting himself so skilfully in the way of temptation , such questions had not entered into his mind — that the fact of to - morrow being Sunday would effectually neutralise any harm he could have been supposed to have done by a visit so simple and natural , and that neither his sister nor his committee , the two powers of which he stood in a certain awe , could so much as hear of it until the election was over , and all decided for good or for evil . This had been a comfort to his mind , but it was the very falsest and most deceitful consolation . That intervening Sunday was a severer calamity for Mr Cavendish than half a dozen ordinary days . The general excitement had risen so high , and all the chances on both sides had been so often discussed and debated , that something new was as water in the desert to the thirsting constituency . The story was all through Grange Lane that very night , but Carlingford itself , from St Roque 's to the wilderness of the North End , tingled with it next morning . It is true , the Rector made no special allusion to it in his sermon , though the tone of all his services was so sad , and his own fine countenance looked so melancholy , that Mr Bury 's devoted followers could all see that he had something on his mind . But Mr Tufton at Salem Chapel was not so reticent . He was a man quite famous for his extempore gifts , and who rather liked to preach about any very recent public event , which it was evident to all his hearers could not have found place in a "
217031	217279	217280	217282	these artist people	4177	" discourse ; and his sermon that morning was upon wickedness in high places , upon men who sought the confidence of their fellows only to betray it , and offered to the poor man a hand red with his sister 's ( metaphorical ) blood . But it would be wrong to say that this was the general tone of public opinion in Grove Street ; most people , on the contrary , thought of Mr Cavendish not as a wolf thirsting for the lamb 's blood , but rather himself as a kind of lamb caught in the thicket , and about to be offered up in sacrifice . Such was the impression of a great many influential persons who had been wavering hitherto , and inclining on the whole to Mr Cavendish 's liberal principles and supposed Low - Church views . A man whose hand is red metaphorically with your sister 's blood is no doubt a highly objectionable personage ; but it is doubtful whether , under the circumstances , an enlightened constituency might not consider the man who had given a perfectly unstained hand to so thoroughly unsatisfactory a sister as more objectionable still ; and the indignation of Grange Lane at Barbara 's reappearance was nothing to the fury of George Street , and even of Wharfside , where the bargees began to scoff openly . Society had nothing worse to say than to quote Mrs Chiley , and assert that "
217286	217299	217280	217282	these artist people	4177	" ; and then Grange Lane in general could not forget that it "
217302	217336	216452	216452	Thomas	117	" Barbara , nor dismiss from its consideration her black eyes , her level brows , and her magnificent contralto ; whereas in the other region the idea of the Member for Carlingford marrying "
217340	217384	216452	216452	Thomas	117	" cast all the world into temporary delirium . It was a still more deadly offence to the small people than to the great . And the exceptional standing which poor Mr Lake and his daughter Rose used to lay claim to — the "
217389	217708	217280	217282	these artist people	4177	" which they possessed as artists — was a pretension much more disagreeable to the shopkeepers than to society in general . Thus in every sense Mr Cavendish had done the very worst for himself by his ill - timed indulgence ; and his guilt was about the same with most of his critics whether he meant perfectly well and innocently , or entertained the most guilty intentions ever conceived by man . And all his misfortunes were increased by the fact that the intervening day was a Sunday . Barbara Lake herself , who did not know what people were saying , and who , if she had known , would not have cared , came to church , as was natural , in the morning ; and under pretence that the family pew was full , had the assurance , as people remarked , to come to the middle aisle , in that same silk dress which rustled like tin , and made more demonstration than the richest draperies . The pew - opener disapproved of her as much as everybody else did , but she could not turn the intruder out ; and though Barbara had a long time to wait , and was curiously inspected by all the eyes near her while she did so , the end was that she got a seat in her rustling silk not very far from where Lucilla sat in deep mourning , a model of every righteous observance . As for poor Barbara , she too was very exemplary in church . She meant nobody any harm , poor soul . She could not help the flashing of those big black eyes , to which the level line above them gave such a curious appearance of obliqueness — nor was it to be expected that she should deny herself the use of her advantages , or omit to "
217712	217886	217280	217282	these artist people	4177	" in all the canticles with such melodious liquid tones as made everybody stop and look round . She had a perfect right to do it ; indeed it was her duty , as it is everybody 's duty , to aid to the best of their ability in the church - music of their parish , which was what Lucilla Marjoribanks persisted in saying in answer to all objections . But the effect was great in the congregation , and even the Rector himself was seen to change colour as his eye fell upon the unlucky young woman . Mr Cavendish , for his part , knew her voice the moment he heard it , and gave a little start , and received such a look from his sister , who was standing by him , as turned him to stone . Mrs Woodburn looked at him , and so did her husband , and Mr Centum turned a solemnly inquiring reproachful gaze upon him from the other side of the aisle . "
217911	217923	217906	217906	you	165	" his sister whispered when they had all sat down again . "
217933	218302	217906	217906	you	165	" cried poor Mr Cavendish , almost loud enough to be heard . And then by the slight , almost imperceptible , hum around him , he felt that not only his sister and his committee , but the Rector and all Carlingford , had their eyes upon him , and was thankful to look up the lesson , poor man , and bury his face in it . It was a hard punishment for the indiscretion of an hour . But perhaps of all the people concerned it was the Rector who was the most to be pitied . He had staked his honour upon Mr Cavendish 's repentance , and here was he going back , publicly to wallow in the mire — and it was Sunday when such a worldly subject ought not to be permitted to enter a good man 's mind , much less to be discussed and acted upon as it ought to be if anything was to be done ; for there was little more than this sacred day remaining in which to undo the mischief which a too great confidence in human nature had wrought . And then , to tell the truth , the Rector did not know how to turn back . It would have been hard , very hard , to have told all the people who confided in him that he had never had any stronger evidence for Mr Cavendish 's repentance than he now had for his backsliding ; and to give in , and let the other side have it all their own way , and throw over the candidate with whom he had identified himself , was as painful to Mr Bury as if , instead of being very Low - Church , he had been the most muscular of Christians . Being in this state of mind , it may be supposed that his sister 's mild wonder and trembling speculations at lunch , when they were alone together , were well qualified to raise some sparks of that old Adam , who , though well kept under , still existed in the Rector 's , as in most other human breasts . "
218315	218320	218308	218308	I	0	" Miss Bury said . "
218372	218373	218363	218363	he	4181	" "
218381	218845	218363	218363	he	4181	" said the Rector . Such an exclamation from him was as bad as the most dreadful oath from an ordinary man , and very nearly made Miss Bury drop from her chair in amazement . Things must have gone very far indeed when the Rector himself disregarded all proprieties and the sacredness of the day in such a wildly - daring fashion . For , to tell the truth , in his secret heart Mr Bury was himself a little of the way of thinking of the people in Grove Street . Strictly speaking , if a man has done anything to make a young woman be talked about , every well - principled person ought to desire that he should make her amends ; but at the same time , at such a crisis there was little consolation in the fact that the candidate one was supporting and doing daily battle for had honourable intentions in respect to Barbara Lake . If it had been Rose Lake , it would still have been a blow ; but Rose was unspeakably respectable , and nobody could have said a syllable on the subject : while Barbara , who came to church in a tin gown , and rustled up the middle aisle in it , attracting all eyes , and took such a second in the canticles that she overwhelmed the choir itself — Barbara , who had made people talk at Lucilla 's parties , and had been ten years away , wandering over the face of the earth , nobody could tell where — governessing , singing , play - acting , perhaps , for anything that anybody could tell ! A clergyman , it is true , dared not have said such a thing , and Mr Bury 's remorse would have been bitter could he have really believed himself capable even of thinking it ; but still it is certain that the unconscious , unexpressed idea in his mind was , that the honourable intentions were the worst of it — that a candidate might be a fool , or even an unrepentant sinner , and after all it would be chiefly his own concern ; but that so much as to dream of making Barbara Lake the Member 's wife , was the deepest insult that could be offered to Carlingford . The Rector carried his burden silently all day , and scarcely opened his lips , as all his sympathetic following remarked ; but before he went to bed he made a singular statement , the complete accuracy of which an impartial observer might be disposed to doubt , but which Mr Bury uttered with profound sincerity , and with a sigh of self - compassion . "
218852	218928	218847	218847	I	0	" was what the good man said , and he all but puffed out the candle he had just lighted , with that sigh . Lucilla , however , in her own person took no part in it at all , one way or other . She shook hands very kindly with Barbara , and hoped she would come and see her , and made it clearly apparent that she at least bore no malice . "
218942	219204	218933	218933	I	0	" she said to Aunt Jemima , who , however , did not know the circumstances , and was very little the wiser , as may be supposed . And then the two ladies walked home together , and Miss Marjoribanks devoted herself to her good books . It was almost the first moment of repose that Lucilla had ever had in her busy life , and it was a repose not only permitted but enjoined . Society , which had all along expected so much from her , expected now that she should not find herself able for any exertion ; and Miss Marjoribanks responded nobly , as she had always done , to the requirements of society . To a mind less perfectly regulated , the fact that the election which had been so interesting to her was now about , as may be said , to take place without her , would have been of itself a severe trial ; and the sweet composure with which she bore it was not one of the least remarkable phenomena of the present crisis . But the fact was that this Sunday was on the whole an oppressive day . Mr Ashburton came in for a moment , it is true , between services ; but he himself , though generally so steady , was unsettled and agitated . He had been bearing the excitement well until this last almost incredible accident occurred , which made it possible that he might not only win , but win by a large majority . "
219220	219262	219266	219266	he	4185	" he said to Lucilla , actually with a tremble in his voice ; and then he told her about Mr Tufton 's sermon and the wickedness in high places , and the hand imbrued metaphorically in his sister 's blood . "
219271	219278	219266	219266	he	4185	" said Lucilla , with indignation . "
219319	219320	219308	219308	I	0	" "
219329	219334	219308	219308	I	0	" said Mr Ashburton ; "
219349	219360	219361	219361	I	0	" and then once more he got restless and abstracted . "
219401	219416	219417	219417	I	0	" Lucilla shook her head , and the movement was more expressive than words . "
219424	219445	219417	219417	I	0	" said Mr Ashburton ; and then he took her hand , and his looks too became full of meaning . "
219452	219454	219447	219447	I	0	" he said—"adieu
219483	219484	219485	219485	You	0	" "
219491	219919	219485	219485	You	0	" said Lucilla ; for Mr Ashburton was not such a novice as to be afraid of the appearance he would have to make at the nomination . He did not contradict her , but he pressed her hand with a look which was equivalent to kissing it , though he was not romantic enough to go quite that length . When he was gone , Miss Marjoribanks could not but wonder a little what he could mean by looking forward to an eventful week . For her own part , she could not but feel that after so much excitement things would feel rather flat for the rest of the week , and that it was almost wrong to have an election on a Tuesday . Could it be that Mr Ashburton had some other contest or candidateship in store for himself which he had not told her about ? Such a thing was quite possible ; but what had Lucilla in her mourning to do with worldly contingencies ? She went back to her seat in the corner of the sofa and her book of sermons , and read fifty pages before tea - time ; she knew how much , because she had put a mark in her book when Mr Ashburton came in . Marks are very necessary things generally in sermon - books ; and Lucilla could not but feel pleased to think that since her visitor went away she had got over so much ground . To compare Carlingford to a volcano that night ( and indeed all the next day , which was the day of nomination ) would be a stale similitude ; and yet in some respects it was like a volcano . It was not the same kind of excitement which arises in a town where politics run very high — if there are any towns nowadays in such a state of unsophisticated nature . Neither was it a place where simple corruption could carry the day ; for the freemen of Wharfside were , after all , but a small portion of the population . It was in reality a quite ideal sort of contest — a contest for the best man , such as would have pleased the purest - minded philosopher . It was the man most fit to represent Carlingford for whom everybody was looking , not a man to be baited about parish - rates and Reform Bills and the Irish Church;—a man who lived in , or near the town , and "
219922	220767	220781	220781	they	4190	" at all the best shops ; a man who would not disgrace his constituency by any unlawful or injudicious sort of love - making — who would attend to the town 's interests and subscribe to its charities , and take the lead in a general way . This was what Carlingford was looking for , as Miss Marjoribanks , with that intuitive rapidity which was characteristic of her genius , had at once remarked ; and when everybody went home from church and chapel , though it was Sunday , the whole town thrilled and throbbed with this great question . People might have found it possible to condone a sin or wink at a mere backsliding ; but there were few so bigoted in their faith as to believe that the man who was capable of marrying Barbara Lake could ever be the man for Carlingford ; and thus it was that Mr Cavendish , who had been flourishing like a green bay - tree , withered away , as it were , in a moment , and the place that had known him knew him no more . The hustings were erected at that central spot , just under the windows of the Blue Boar , where Grange Lane and George Street meet , the most central point in Carlingford . It was so near that Lucilla could hear the shouts and the music and all the divers noises of the election , but could not , even when she went into the very corner of the window and strained her eyes to the utmost , see what was going on , which was a very trying position . We will not linger upon the proceedings or excitement of Monday , when the nomination and the speeches were made , and when the show of hands was certainly thought to be in Mr Cavendish 's favour . But it was the next day that was the real trial . Lady Richmond and her party drove past at a very early hour , and looked up at Miss Marjoribanks 's windows , and congratulated themselves that they were so early , and that poor dear Lucilla would not have the additional pain of seeing them go past . But Lucilla did see them , though , with her usual good sense , she kept behind the blind . She never did anything absurd in the way of early rising on ordinary occasions ; but this morning it was impossible to restrain a certain excitement , and though it did her no good , still she got up an hour earlier than usual , and listened to the music , and heard the cabs rattling about , and could not help it if her heart beat quicker . It was perhaps a more important crisis for Miss Marjoribanks than for any other person , save one , in Carlingford ; for of course it would be foolish to attempt to assert that she did not understand by this time what Mr Ashburton meant ; and it may be imagined how hard it was upon Lucilla to be thus , as it were , in the very outside row of the assembly — to hear all the distant shouts and sounds , everything that was noisy and inarticulate , and conveyed no meaning , and to be out of reach of all that could really inform her as to what was going on . She saw from her window the cabs rushing past , now with her own violet - and - green colours , now with the blue - and - yellow . And sometimes it seemed to Lucilla that the blue - and - yellow predominated , and that the carriages which mounted the hostile standard carried voters in larger numbers and more enthusiastic condition . The first load of bargemen that came up Grange Lane from the farther end of Wharf side were all Blues ; and when a spectator is thus held on the very edge of the event in a suspense which grows every moment more intolerable , especially when he or she is disposed to believe that things in general go on all the worse for his or her absence , it is no wonder if that spectator becomes nervous , and sees all the dangers at their darkest . What if , after all , old liking and friendship had prevailed over that beautiful optimism which Lucilla had done so much to instil into the minds of her townsfolk ? What if something more mercenary and less elevating than the ideal search for the best man , in which she had hoped Carlingford was engaged , should have swayed the popular mind to the other side ? All these painful questions went through Lucilla 's mind as the day crept on ; and her suspense was much aggravated by Aunt Jemima , who took no real interest in the election , but who kept saying every ten minutes—"I
220817	220909	220815	220815	Cavendish	115	" Lucilla thought so too , and her heart quaked within her , and she went and squeezed herself into the corner of the window , to try whether it was not possible to catch a glimpse of the field of battle ; and her perseverance was finally rewarded by the sight of the extremity of the wooden planks which formed the polling - booth ; but there was little satisfaction to be got out of that . And then the continual dropping of Aunt Jemima 's questions drove her wild . "
220914	220920	220815	220815	Cavendish	115	" she said at last , "
220941	221187	220815	220815	Cavendish	115	do"—which , it will be acknowledged , was not an answer such as one would have expected from Lucilla 's perfect temper and wonderful self - control . The election went on with all its usual commotion while Miss Marjoribanks watched and waited . Mr Cavendish 's committee brought their supporters very well up in the morning — no doubt by way of making sure of them , as somebody suggested on the other side ; and for some time Mrs Woodburn 's party at Masters 's windows ( which Masters had given rather reluctantly , by way of pleasing the Rector ) looked in better spirits and less anxious than Lady Richmond 's party , which was at the Blue Boar . Towards noon Mr Cavendish himself went up to his female supporters with the bulletin of the poll — the same bulletin which Mr Ashburton had just sent down to Lucilla . These were the numbers ; and they made Masters 's triumphant , while silence and anxiety fell upon the Blue Boar : — When Miss Marjoribanks received this disastrous intelligence , she put the note in her pocket without saying a word to Aunt Jemima , and left her window , and went back to her worsted - work ; but as for Mrs Woodburn , she gave her brother a hug , and laughed , and cried , and believed in it , like a silly woman as she was . "
221205	221282	221198	221198	I	0	" she said , thrusting her hand into an imaginary waistcoat with Mr Ashburton 's very look and tone , which was beyond measure amusing to all the party . They laughed so long , and were so gay , that Lady Richmond solemnly levelled her opera - glass at them with the air of a woman who was used to elections , but knew how such parvenus have their heads turned by a prominent position . "
221292	221296	221283	221284	That woman	4192	" she said , "
221333	221707	221322	221322	you	4194	" Just at that moment , however , an incident occurred which took up the attention of the ladies at the windows , and eclipsed even the interest of the election . Poor Barbara Lake was interested , too , to know if her friend would win . She was not entertaining any particular hopes or plans about him . Years and hard experiences had humbled Barbara . The Brussels veil which she used to dream of had faded as much from her memory as poor Rose 's Honiton design , for which she had got the prize . At the present moment , instead of nourishing the ambitious designs which everybody laid to her charge , she would have been content with the very innocent privilege of talking a little to her next employers about Mr Cavendish , the member for Carlingford , and his visits to her father 's house . But at the same time , she had once been fond of him , and she took a great interest in him , and was very anxious that he should win . And she was in the habit , like so many other women , of finding out , as far as she could , what was going on , and going to see everything that there might be to see . She had brought one of her young brothers with her , whose anxiety to see the fun was quite as great as her own ; and she was arrayed in the tin dress — her best available garment — which was made long , according to the fashion , and which , as Barbara scorned to tuck it up , was continually getting trodden on , and talked about , and reviled at , on that crowded pavement . The two parties of ladies saw , and even it might be said heard , the sweep of the metallic garment , which was undergoing such rough usage , and which was her best , poor soul . Lady Richmond had alighted from her carriage carefully tucked up , though there were only a few steps to make , and there was no lady in Carlingford who would have swept "
221711	221790	221791	221791	Cavendish	115	" over the stones in such a way ; but then poor Barbara was not precisely a lady , and thought it right to look as if it did not matter . She went up to read the numbers of the poll — in the sight of everybody ; and she clasped her hands together with ecstatic satisfaction as she read ; and young Carmine , her brother , dashed into the midst of the fray , and shouted "
221799	221923	221797	221797	Cavendish	115	" and could scarcely be drawn back again to take his sister home . Even when she withdrew , she did not go home , but went slowly up and down Grange Lane with her rustling train behind her , with the intention of coming back for further information . Lady Richmond and Mrs Woodburn both lost all thought of the election as they watched ; and lo ! when their wandering thoughts came back again , the tide had turned . The tide had turned . Whether it was Barbara , or whether it was fate , or whether it was the deadly unanimity of those Dissenters , who , after all their wavering , had at last decided for the man who "
221925	222479	222505	222505	I	0	" in George Street — no one could tell ; but by two o'clock Mr Ashburton was so far ahead that he felt himself justified in sending another bulletin to Lucilla — so far that there was no reasonable hope of the opposite candidate ever making up his lost ground . Mrs Woodburn was not a woman to be content when reasonable hope was over — she clung to the last possibility desperately , with a pertinacity beyond all reason , and swore in her heart that it was Barbara that had done it , and cursed her with her best energies ; which , however , as these are not melodramatic days , was a thing which did the culprit no possible harm . When Barbara herself came back from her promenade in Grange Lane , and saw the altered numbers , she again clasped her hands together for a moment , and looked as if she were going to faint ; and it was at that moment that Mr Cavendish 's eyes fell upon her , as ill fortune would have it . They were all looking at him as if it was his fault ; and the sight of that sympathetic face was consoling to the defeated candidate . He took off his hat before everybody ; probably , as his sister afterwards said , he would have gone and offered her his arm had he been near enough . How could anybody wonder , after that , that things had gone against him , and that , notwithstanding all his advantages , he was the loser in the fight ? As for Lucilla , she had gone back to her worsted - work when she got Mr Ashburton 's first note , in which his rival 's name stood above his own . She looked quite composed , and Aunt Jemima went on teasing with her senseless questions . But Miss Marjoribanks put up with it all ; though the lingering progress of these hours from one o'clock to four , the sound of cabs furiously driven by , the distant shouts , the hum of indefinite din that filled the air , exciting every moment a keener curiosity , and giving no satisfaction or information , would have been enough to have driven a less large intelligence out of its wits . Lucilla bore it , doing as much as she could of her worsted - work , and saying nothing to nobody , except , indeed , an occasional word to Aunt Jemima , who would have an answer . She was not walking about Grange Lane repeating a kind of prayer for the success of her candidate , as Barbara Lake was doing ; but perhaps , on the whole , Barbara had the easiest time of it at that moment of uncertainty . When the next report came , Lucilla 's fingers trembled as she opened it , so great was her emotion ; but after that she recovered herself as if by magic . She grew pale , and then gave a kind of sob , and then a kind of laugh , and finally put her worsted - work back into her basket , and threw Mr Ashburton 's note into the fire . "
222485	222489	222505	222505	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
222526	222527	222515	222515	he	115	" "
222537	222542	222535	222535	you	0	" said Aunt Jemima . "
222572	222573	222563	222563	you	0	" "
222584	222604	222576	222576	I	0	" said Lucilla , drying her eyes ; and then she awoke to the practical exigencies of the position . "
222626	222761	222620	222620	I	0	" she said , and went downstairs with a cheerful heart . It might be said to be as good as decided , so far as regarded Mr Ashburton ; and when it came for her final judgment , what was it that she ought to say ? It was very well that Miss Marjoribanks 's unfailing foresight led her to speak to Nancy ; for the fact was , that after four o'clock , when the polling was over , everybody came in to tea . All Lady Richmond 's party came , as a matter of course , and Mr Ashburton himself , for a few minutes , bearing meekly his new honours ; and so many more people besides , that but for knowing it was a special occasion , and that "
222764	223340	222620	222620	I	0	" was elected , Nancy 's mind never could have borne the strain . And the tea that was used was something frightful . As for Aunt Jemima , who had just then a good many thoughts of her own to occupy her , and did not care so much as the rest for all the chatter that was going on , nor for all those details about poor Barbara and Mr Cavendish 's looks , which Lucilla received with such interest , she could not but make a calculation in passing as to this new item of fashionable expenditure into which her niece was plunging so wildly . To be sure , it was an occasion that never might occur again , and everybody was so excited as to forget even that Lucilla was in mourning , and that such a number of people in the house so soon might be more than she could bear . And she was excited herself , and forgot that she was not able for it . But still Aunt Jemima , sitting by , could not help thinking , that even five - o'clock teas of good quality and unlimited amount would very soon prove to be impracticable upon two hundred a year . Mr Ashburton , it may be supposed , had but little time to think on that eventful evening ; and yet he was thinking all the way home , as he drove back in the chilly spring night to his own house . If his further course of action had been made in any way to depend upon the events of this day , it was now settled beyond all further uncertainty ; and though he was not a man in his first youth , nor a likely subject for a romantic passion , still he was a little excited by the position in which he found himself . Miss Marjoribanks had been his inspiring genius , and had interested herself in his success in the warmest and fullest way ; and if ever a woman was made for a certain position , Lucilla was made to be the wife of the Member for Carlingford . Long , long ago , at the very beginning of her career , when it was of Mr Cavendish that everybody was thinking , the ideal fitness of this position had struck everybody . Circumstances had changed since then , and Mr Cavendish had fallen , and a worthier hero had been placed in his stead ; but though the person was changed , the circumstances remained unaltered . Natural fitness was indeed so apparent , that many people would have been disposed to say that it was Lucilla 's duty to accept Mr Ashburton , even independent of the fact that he was perfectly eligible in every other respect . But with all this the new Member for Carlingford was not able to assure himself that there had been anything particular in Lucilla 's manner to himself . With her as with Carlingford , it was pure optimism . He was the best man , and her quick intelligence had divined it sooner than anybody else had done . Whether there was anything more in it , Mr Ashburton could not tell . His own impression was that she would accept him ; but if she did not , he would have no right to complain of "
223343	224191	222620	222620	I	0	" or to think himself jilted . This was what he was thinking as he drove home ; but at the same time he was very far from being in a desponding state of mind . He felt very nearly as sure that Lucilla would be his wife , as if they were already standing before the Rector in Carlingford Church . He had just won one victory , which naturally made him feel more confident of winning another ; and even without entertaining any over - exalted opinion of himself , it was evident that , under all the circumstances , a woman of thirty , with two hundred a year , would be a fool to reject such an offer . And Lucilla was the very furthest in the world from being a fool . It was in every respect the beginning of a new world to Mr Ashburton , and it would have been out of nature had he not been a little excited . After the quiet life he had led at the Firs , biding his time , he had now to look forward to a busy and important existence , half of it spent amid the commotion and ceaseless stir of town . A new career , a wife , a new position , the most important in his district — it was not much wonder if Mr Ashburton felt a little excited . He was fatigued at the same time , too much fatigued to be disposed for sleep ; and all these united influences swayed him to a state of mind very much unlike his ordinary sensible calm . All his excitement culminated so in thoughts of Lucilla , that the new Member felt himself truly a lover ; and late as the hour was , he took up a candle and once more made a survey all alone of his solitary house . Nothing could look more dismal than the dark rooms , where there was neither light nor fire — the great desert drawing - room , for example , which stood unchanged as it had been in the days of his grand - aunts , the good old ladies who had bequeathed the Firs to Mr Ashburton . He had made no change in it , and scarcely ever used it , keeping to his library and dining - room , with the possibility , no doubt , always before him of preparing it in due course of time for his wife . That moment had now arrived , and in his excitement he went into the desolate room with his candle , which just made the darkness visible , and tried to see the dusky curtains and faded carpet , and the indescribable fossil air which everything had . There were the odd little spider - legged stands , upon which the Miss Penrhyns had placed their work - boxes , and the old sofas on which they had sat , and the floods of old tapestry - work with which they had decorated their favourite sitting - room . The sight of it chilled the Member for Carlingford , and made him sad . He tried to turn his thoughts to the time when this same room should be fitted up to suit Lucilla 's complexion , and should be gay with light and with her presence . He did all he could to realise the moment when , with a mistress so active and energetic , the whole place would change its aspect , and glow forth resplendent into the twilight of the county , a central point for all . Perhaps it was his fatigue which gained upon him just at this moment , and repulsed all livelier thoughts ; but the fact is , that however willing Lucilla might turn out to be , her image was coy , and would not come . The more Mr Ashburton tried to think of her as in possession here , the more the grim images of the two old Miss Penrhyns walked out of the darkness and asserted their prior claims . They even seemed to have got into the library before him when he went back , though there his fire was burning , and his lamp . After that there was nothing left for a man to do , even though he had been that day elected Member for Carlingford , but to yield to the weakness of an ordinary mortal , and go to bed . Thoughts very different , but even more disturbing , were going on at the same time in Grange Lane . Poor Mr Cavendish , for one thing,—upbraided by everybody 's looks , and even by some people 's words — feeling himself condemned , censured , and despised on all sides — smarting under his sister 's wild reproaches and her husband 's blunt commentary thereupon,—had slunk away from their society after dinner , not seeing now why he should bear it any longer .

224215	225516	224204	224204	you	4202	" Mr Woodburn had said , in his coarse way ; and it was all Mr Cavendish could do to refrain from saying that one time and another he had done quite enough for her sake , but he did not see any reason why he should put up with it any longer . He strolled out of doors , though the town was still in commotion , and could not but think of the sympathetic countenance which had paled to - day at sight of the numbers of the poll . She , by Heaven ! might have had reason to find fault with him , and she had never done so ; she had never perceived that he was stout , or changed from old times . As he entertained these thoughts , his steps going down Grange Lane gradually quickened , but he did not say to himself where he was going . He went a very roundabout way , as if he did not mean it , as far as St Roque 's , and then up by the lane to the far - off desert extremity of Grove Street . It was simply to walk off his excitement and disappointment , and free himself from criticism for that evening at least ; but as he walked he could not help thinking that Barbara , if she were well dressed , would still be a fine woman , that her voice was magnificent in its way , and that about Naples , perhaps , or the baths of Lucca , or in Germany , or the south of France , a man might be able to get on well enough with such a companion , where society was not so exacting or stiff - starched as in England . And the end was , that the feet of the defeated candidate carried him , ere ever he was aware , with some kind of independent volition of their own , to Mr Lake 's door — and it may be here said , once for all , that this visit was decisive of Mr Cavendish 's fate . This will not be regarded as anything but a digression by such of Lucilla 's friends as may be solicitous to know what she was making up her mind to under the circumstances ; but the truth is that Lucilla 's historian can not , any more than Miss Marjoribanks herself could , refrain from a certain regret over Mr Cavendish . That was what he came to , poor man ! after all his experiences ; a man who was capable of so much better things — a man even who , if he had made a right use of his opportunities , might once have had as good a chance as any other of marrying Lucilla herself . If there ever was an instance of chances thrown away and lost opportunities , surely here was that lamentable example . And thus , poor man ! all his hopes and all his chances came to an end . As for Miss Marjoribanks herself , it would be vain to say that this was not a very exciting moment for her . If there ever could be said to be a time when she temporarily lost the entire sway and control of herself and her feelings , it would be at this crisis . She went about all that evening like a woman in a dream . For the first time in her life she not only did not know what she would do , but she did not know what she wanted to do . There could now be no mistaking what Mr Ashburton 's intentions were . Up to a very recent time Lucilla had been able to take refuge in her mourning , and conclude that she had no present occasion to disturb herself . But now that calm was over . She could not conceal from herself that it was in her power by a word to reap all the advantages of the election , and to step at once into the only position which she had ever felt might be superior to her own in Carlingford . At last this great testimonial of female merit was to be laid at her feet . A man thoroughly eligible in every way — moderately rich , well connected , able to restore to her all , and more than all , the advantages which she had lost at her father 's death — a man , above all , who was Member for Carlingford , was going to offer himself to her acceptance , and put his happiness in her hands ; and while she was so well aware of this , she was not at all so well aware what answer she would make him . Lucilla 's mind was in such a commotion as she sat over her embroidery , that she thought it strange indeed that it did not show , and could not understand how Aunt Jemima could sit there so quietly opposite her , as if nothing was the matter . But , to tell the truth , there was a good deal the matter with Aunt Jemima too , which was perhaps the reason why she saw no signs of her companion 's agitation . Mrs John Marjoribanks had not been able any more than her niece to shut her eyes to Mr Ashburton 's evident meaning , and now that matters were visibly coming to a crisis , a sudden panic and horror had seized her . What would Tom say ? If she stood by and saw the prize snapped up under her very eyes , what account could she give to her son of her stewardship ? how could she explain her silence as to all his wishes and intentions , her absolute avoidance of his name in all her conversations with Lucilla ? While Miss Marjoribanks marvelled that the emotion in her breast could be invisible , and at Aunt Jemima 's insensibility , the bosom of that good woman was throbbing with equal excitement . Sometimes each made an indifferent remark , and panted after it , as if she had given utterance to the most exhausting emotions ; but so great was the preoccupation of both that neither observed how it was faring with the other . But perhaps , on the whole , it was Aunt Jemima that suffered the most ; for her there was nothing flattering , nothing gratifying , no prospect of change or increased happiness , or any of the splendours of imagination involved . All that could happen to her would be the displeasure of her son and his disappointment ; and it might be her fault , she who could have consented to be chopped up in little pieces , if that would have done Tom any good ; but who , notwithstanding , was not anxious for him to marry his cousin , now that her father 's fortune was all lost and she had but two hundred a year . They had a silent cup of tea together at eight o'clock , after that noisy exciting one at five , which had been shared by half Carlingford , as Aunt Jemima thought . The buzz of that impromptu assembly , in which everybody talked at the same moment , and nobody listened , except perhaps Lucilla , had all died away into utter stillness ; but the excitement had not died away ; that had only risen to a white heat , silent and consuming , as the two ladies sat over their tea . "
225528	225538	225520	225521	Mr Ashburton	222	" Aunt Jemima said , after a long pause . "
225542	225579	225539	225540	Mr Ashburton	222	" said Lucilla , with a slight start ; and , to tell the truth , she was glad to employ that childish expedient to gain a little time , and consider what she should say . "
225604	225605	225607	225607	he	222	" "
225611	225618	225607	225607	he	222	" said Mrs John , with a sigh—"or
225656	225657	225647	225647	he	222	" "
225669	225694	225666	225667	Aunt Jemima	230	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; but she never raised her eyes from her work , as she would have done in any other case . "
225706	225707	225702	225702	you	230	" "
225728	225734	225714	225714	I	0	" Aunt Jemima said severely , "
225748	225828	225829	225829	I	0	" and then some such feeling as the dog had in the manger — a jealousy of those who sought the gift though she herself did not want it — came over Mrs John , and at the same time a sudden desire to clear her conscience and make a stand for Tom . She did it suddenly , and went further than she meant to go ; but then she never dreamt it would have the least effect . "
225882	225925	225926	225926	I	0	" She was frightened at it herself before the words were out of her mouth , and the effect it had upon Miss Marjoribanks was wonderful . She threw her embroidery away , and looked Tom 's mother keenly in the face . "
225942	225946	225939	225940	Aunt Jemima	230	" she said ; "
225960	225989	225958	225958	you	4403	" said Lucilla . But by that time Aunt Jemima had got thoroughly frightened , both at herself and her companion , and had nothing more to say . "
226006	226010	225990	225990	I	0	" she said . "
226069	226088	226059	226059	I	0	" Upon which Miss Marjoribanks recovered herself in a moment , and folded up her worsted - work . "
226094	226099	226089	226089	I	0	" she said sweetly , "
226144	226145	226133	226133	I	0	" "
226153	226715	226133	226133	I	0	" Aunt Jemima said , giving Lucilla a kiss ; but she did not take her own advice . She took a long time to think it all over , and sat up by the side of the decaying fire until it was midnight — an hour at which a female establishment like this should surely have been all shut up and at rest . And Lucilla did very much the same thing , wondering greatly what her aunt could tell her if she had a mind , and having the greatest inclination in the world to break into her chamber , and see , at any risk , what was in Tom 's last letter . If she could have seen that , it might have thrown some light on the problem Lucilla was discussing , or given her some guidance through her difficulties . It was just then that Mr Ashburton was inviting her image into the fossil drawing - room , and finding nothing but the grim shades of the Miss Penrhyns answer to his call . Perhaps this was because Lucilla 's image at that moment was called upon more potently from another quarter in a more familiar voice . But after this exhausting day and late sitting - up , everybody was late in the morning , at least in Grange Lane . Miss Marjoribanks had slept little all night , and she was not in a more settled state of mind when the day returned which probably would bring the matter to a speedy decision . Her mind was like a country held by two armies , one of which by turns swept the other into a corner , but only to be driven back in its turn . After the unaccountable stupidity of the general public — after all the Cavendishes , Beverleys , and Riders who had once had it in their power to distinguish themselves by at least making her an offer , and who had not done it — here at last , in all good faith , honesty , and promptitude , had appeared a man superior to them all — a man whom she would have no reason to be ashamed of in any particular , sensible like herself , public - spirited like herself — a man whose pursuits she could enter into fully , who had a perfectly ideal position to offer her , and in whose person , indeed , all sorts of desirable qualities seemed to meet . Miss Marjoribanks , when she considered all this , and thought over all their recent intercourse , and the terms of friendship into which the election had brought them , felt , as any other sensible person would have felt , that there was only one answer which could be given to such a man . If she neglected or played with his devotion , then certainly she never would deserve to have another such possibility afforded to her , and merited nothing better than to live and die a single woman on two hundred a year . But then , on the other hand , there would rush forth a crowd of quick - coming and fantastic suggestions which took away Lucilla 's breath , and made her heart beat loud . What if there might be "
226718	226960	226961	226962	other people	279	" who had been fond of her before she ever heard of Mr Ashburton 's name ? What if there might be some one in the world who was ready , not to offer her his hand and fortune in a reasonable way , as Mr Ashburton no doubt would , but to throw himself all in a heap at her feet , and make the greatest fool of himself possible for her sake ? Miss Marjoribanks had been the very soul of good sense all her days , but now her ruling quality seemed to forsake her . And yet she could not consent to yield herself up to pure unreason without a struggle . She fought manfully , womanfully against the weakness which hitherto must have been lying hidden in some out - of - the - way corner in her heart . Probably if Mr Ashburton had asked her all at once amid the excitement of the election , or at any other unpremeditated moment , Lucilla would have been saved all this self - torment ; but it is hard upon a woman to have a proposal hanging over her head by a hair , as it were , and to look forward to it without any uncertainty or mystery , and have full time to make up her mind . And there was no accounting for the curious force and vividness with which that strange idea about "
226964	227159	226961	226962	other people	279	" upon which Aunt Jemima would throw no light , had come into Lucilla 's head . She was still in the same frightful chaos of uncertainty when Mr Ashburton was shown into the drawing - room . She had not even heard him ring , and was thus deprived of the one possible moment of coming to a decision before she faced and confronted her fate . Miss Marjoribanks 's heart gave a great jump , and then she recovered herself , and rose up without faltering , and shook hands with him . She was all alone , for Aunt Jemima had not found herself equal to facing the emergency ; and there was not the least possibility of evading or postponing , or in any way running away from it now . Lucilla sat down again upon her sofa where she had been sitting , and composed herself with a certain despairing tranquillity , and trusted in Providence . She had thrown herself on other occasions , though never at an equally important crisis , upon the inspiration of the moment , and she felt it would not forsake her now . "
227169	227182	226961	226962	other people	279	" said Mr Ashburton , who was naturally a little agitated too , "
227229	227230	227214	227214	you	4214	" "
227243	227247	227214	227214	you	4214	" cried Lucilla . "
227266	227267	227268	227268	I	0	" "
227281	227294	227270	227270	I	0	" said the candidate nervously ; and then he cleared his throat . "
227374	227490	227352	227352	Lucilla	119	" What caused this question was that Miss Marjoribanks had all at once changed colour , and given a great start , and put her hand to her breast , where her heart had taken such a leap that she felt it in her throat . But it was not because of what Mr Ashburton was saying ; it was because of one of the very commonest sounds of everyday existence — a cab driving down Grange Lane ; but then it was a cab driving in such a way that you could have sworn there was somebody in it in a terrible hurry , and who had just arrived by the twelve o'clock train . "
227497	227502	227352	227352	Lucilla	119	" said Miss Marjoribanks ; "
227565	227805	227553	227553	I	0	" Lucilla stopped again , and once more put her hand to her breast . Her heart gave another jump , and , if such a thing were possible to a heart , went off from its mistress altogether , and rushed downstairs bodily to see who was coming . Yet , with all her agitation , she had still enough self - control to lift an appealing look — a look which threw herself upon his mercy , and implored his forbearance — to Mr Ashburton 's face . As for the Member for Carlingford , he was confounded , and could not tell what to make of it . What was it she had thought up to the very last moment ? Was this a refusal , or was she only putting off his claim , or was it something altogether independent of him and his intentions that agitated Lucilla to such an unusual extent ? While he sat in his confusion trying to make it out , the most startling sound interrupted the interview . The old disused bell that had so often called Dr Marjoribanks up at night , and which hung near the door of the old Doctor 's room , just over the drawing - room , began to peal through the silence , as if rung by a hand too impatient to notice what it was with which it made its summons . "
227810	227876	227553	227553	I	0	" Miss Marjoribanks cried , with a little shriek ; and she got up trembling , and then dropped upon her seat again , and in her agitated state burst into tears . And Mr Ashburton felt that , under these most extraordinary circumstances , even so sensible a woman as Lucilla might be justified in fainting , embarrassing and uncomfortable as that would be . "
227886	228243	227877	227877	I	0	" he said , with still half the air of a man who had a right to go and see , and was , as it were , almost in his own house . As he turned round , the door bell pealed wildly below in correction of the mistake . It was evident that somebody wanted admission who had not a moment to lose , and who was in the habit of pulling wildly at whatever came in his way . Mr Ashburton went out of the room to see who it was , a little amused and a little alarmed , but much annoyed at bottom , as was only natural , at such an interruption . He did not very well know whether he was accepted or rejected ; but it was equally his duty in either case to put a stop to the ringing of that ghostly bell . He went away , meaning to return immediately and have it out and know his fate . And Lucilla , whose heart had come back , having fully ascertained who it was , and was now choking her with its beating , was left to await the new event and the new - comer alone . Mr Ashburton went away from Lucilla 's side , thinking to come back again , and clear everything up : but he did not come back . Though he heard nothing , and saw nothing , that could throw any distinct light on the state of her mind , yet instinct came to his aid , it is to be supposed , in the matter . He did not return : and Lucilla sat on her sofa with her hands clasped together to support her , and her heart leaping in her very mouth . She was in a perfect frenzy of suspense , listening with her whole heart and soul ; but that did not prevent the same crowd of thoughts which had been persecuting her for twenty - four hours from keeping up their wild career as before . What reason had she to suppose that "
228246	228566	227877	227877	I	0	" had arrived ? Who could arrive in that accidental way , without a word of warning ? And what possible excuse had she to offer to herself for sending the new member for Carlingford — a man so excellent and honourable and eligible — away ? The minutes , or rather the seconds , passed over Miss Marjoribanks like hours , as she sat thus waiting , not daring to stir lest the slightest movement might keep from her ears some sound from below , till at last the interval seemed so long that her heart began to sink , and her excitement to fail . It could not be any one — if it had been any one , something more must have come of it before now . It must have been Lydia Richmond coming to see her sister next door , or somebody connected with the election , or — — When she got as far as this , Lucilla 's heart suddenly mounted up again with a spring into her ears . She heard neither words nor voice , but she heard something which had as great an effect upon her as either could have had . On the landing half - way up the stairs , there had stood in Dr Marjoribanks 's house from time immemorial a little old - fashioned table , with a large china bowl upon it , in which the cards of visitors were placed . It was a great bowl , and it was always full , and anybody rushing upstairs in a reckless way might easily upset table and cards and all in their progress . This was what happened while Lucilla sat listening . There was a rumble , a crash , and a sound as of falling leaves , and it made her heart , as we have said , jump into her ears . "
228576	228852	228853	228853	Tom	117	" said Lucilla — and in that moment her composure came back to her as by a miracle . She unclasped her hands , which she had been holding pressed painfully together by way of supporting herself , and she gave a long sigh of unutterable relief , and her whirl of thought stopped and cleared up with an instantaneous rapidity . Everything seemed to be explained by that sound ; and there never was a greater change upon the looks and feelings of any one in this world than that which passed upon the looks and feelings of Lucilla , in the interval between the drawing up of that cab and the rush of Tom Marjoribanks at the drawing - room door . For after the commotion on the staircase Lucilla had no further doubt on the subject . She even had the strength to get up to meet him , and hold out her hands to him by way of welcome — but found herself , before she knew how , in the arms of a man with a beard , who was so much changed in his own person that he ventured to kiss her , which was a thing Tom Marjoribanks , though her cousin , had never dared to do before . He kissed her — such was his audacity ; and then he held her at arm 's length to have a good look at her ; and then , according to all appearance , would have repeated his first salutation , but that Lucilla had come to herself , and took the reins at once into her hand . "
228855	228859	228864	228864	you	117	" she said , "
228904	228905	228931	228931	Lucilla	119	" "
228908	228917	228931	228931	Lucilla	119	" said Tom , with an astonished air . "
228978	229052	229053	229053	I	0	" Then Lucilla saw it all , and that Aunt Jemima had meant to do Mr Ashburton a good turn . And she was not grateful to her aunt , however kind her intentions might have been . But Tom was holding her hand , and looking into her face while this thought passed through her mind , and Miss Marjoribanks was not the woman , under any circumstances , to make dispeace . "
229061	229065	229056	229056	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
229097	229098	229091	229091	one	4465	" "
229110	229164	229099	229099	I	0	" cried Tom energetically ; and he took hold of both her hands , and looked into her face more and more . To be sure he had a kind of right , being a cousin , and newly returned after so long an absence ; but it was embarrassing all the same . "
229174	229178	229167	229167	Tom	117	" cried Lucilla ; "
229198	229302	229195	229196	dear papa	303	" It was natural , and indeed it was only proper , that Miss Marjoribanks should cry — which she did abundantly , partly for grief , and partly because of the flutter of agitation , and something like joy , in which she was , and which , considering that she had always frankly owned that she was fond of Tom , was quite natural too . She cried with honest abandonment , and did not take much notice what her cousin was doing to comfort her , though indeed he applied himself to that benevolent office in the most anxious way . "
229309	229313	229307	229307	Lucilla	119	" he said , "
229350	229351	229339	229339	you	119	" "
229363	229367	229357	229357	I	0	" sobbed Lucilla ; "
229470	229471	229462	229462	he	4228	" "
229474	229479	229472	229472	Lucilla	119	" said Tom Marjoribanks , "
229576	229577	229570	229570	I	0	" "
229591	229600	229578	229578	You	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with momentary impatience ; "
229721	229722	229712	229712	you	0	" "
229726	229750	229712	229712	you	0	" said Tom apologetically ; but he drew his chair in front of Miss Marjoribanks , so that she could not get away . "
229765	229769	229760	229760	you	4242	" he said ; "
229834	229835	229836	229836	Tom	117	" "
229838	229843	229836	229836	Tom	117	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
229884	229885	229886	229886	Lucilla	119	" "
229888	229900	229901	229901	somebody	312	" said Tom , and there was decision in his eye , "
229922	229923	229924	229924	Him	312	" "
229929	230012	229924	229924	Him	312	" said Lucilla , in dismay . Blunderer as he was , he had gone direct to the very heart of the question , and it was impossible not to tremble a little in the presence of such straightforward clear - sightedness . Miss Marjoribanks had risen up to make her escape as soon as it should be possible , but she was so much struck by Tom 's unlooked - for perspicuity , that she sat down again in her consternation . "
230023	230027	230015	230015	you	117	" she said . "
230083	230084	230088	230088	they	4252	" "
230096	230102	230088	230088	they	4252	" said the persistent Tom . "
230162	230163	230156	230156	you	119	" "
230175	230192	230193	230193	You	119	" said Lucilla , with indignation , again rising , though he still held her hands . "
230252	230253	230255	230255	you	119	" "
230261	230366	230255	230255	you	119	" repeated Tom . It was not wisdom , is was instinct , that made him thus hold fast by his text ; and as for Lucilla , nothing but the softened state in which she was , nothing but the fact that it was Tom Marjoribanks who had been ten years away , and was always ridiculous , could have kept her from putting down at once such an attempt to coerce her . But the truth was , that Miss Marjoribanks did not feel her own mistress at that moment , and perhaps that was why he had the audacity to repeat , "
230374	230384	230368	230368	you	119	" Then Lucilla found herself fairly driven to bay . "
230387	230420	230385	230385	Tom	117	" she said , with a solemnity that overwhelmed him for the moment , for he thought at first , with natural panic , that it was himself who was being rejected , "
230461	230475	230452	230452	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a mournful sense of her own weakness ; "
230506	230670	230673	230673	Lucilla	119	" When Lucilla had made this decisive utterance she turned away with a certain melancholy majesty to go and see after lunch — for he had loosed her hand and fallen back in consternation , thinking for the moment that it was all over . Miss Marjoribanks sighed , and turned round , not thinking of Tom , who was safe enough , but with a natural regret for the member for Carlingford , who now , poor man , was as much out of the question as if he had been dead and buried . But before she reached the door Tom had recovered himself . He went up to her in his ridiculous way without the slightest regard either for the repast she was so anxious to prepare for him , or for his mother 's feelings , or indeed for anything else in the world , except the one thing which had brought him , as he said , home . "
230684	230737	230673	230673	Lucilla	119	" he said , taking her to him , and arresting her progress as if she had been a baby ; and though he had such a beard , and was twice as big and strong as he used to be , there were big tears in the great fellow 's eyes . "
230746	230760	230673	230673	Lucilla	119	" said Tom , looking at her in a way that startled Lucilla . "
230768	231339	230673	230673	Lucilla	119	" Miss Marjoribanks had come through many a social crisis with dignity and composure . She had never yet been known to fail in an emergency . She had managed Mr Cavendish , and , up to the last moment , Mr Ashburton , and all the intervening candidates for her favour , with perfect self - control and command of the situation . Perhaps it was because , as she had herself said , her feelings had never been engaged . But now , when it was only Tom — he whom , once upon a time , she had dismissed with affectionate composure , and given such excellent advice to , and regarded in so motherly a way — all Lucilla 's powers seemed to fail her . It is hard to have to wind up with such a confession after having so long entertained a confidence in Lucilla which nothing seemed likely to impair . She broke down just at the moment when she had most need to have all her wits about her . Perhaps it was her past agitation which had been too much for her . Perhaps it was the tears in Tom Marjoribanks 's eyes . But the fact was that Lucilla relinquished her superior position for the time being , and suffered him to make any assertion he pleased , and was so weak as to cry , for the second time , too — which , of all things in the world , was surely the last thing to have been expected of Miss Marjoribanks at the moment which decided her fate . Lucilla cried , and acquiesced , and thought of her father and of the Member for Carlingford , and gave to each a tear and a regret ; and she did not even take the trouble to answer any question , or to think who it was she was leaning on . It was to be Tom after all — after all the archdeacons , doctors , generals , members of Parliament — after the ten years and more in which she had not gone off — after the poor old Doctor 's grudge against the nephew whom he did not wish to inherit his wealth , and Aunt Jemima 's quiet wiles , and attempt to disappoint her boy . Fate and honest love had been waiting all the time till their moment came ; and now it was not even necessary to say anything about it . The fact was so clear that it did not require stating . It was to be Tom after all . To do him justice , Tom behaved at this moment , in which affairs were left in his hands , as if he had been training for it all his life . Perhaps it was the first time in which he had done anything absolutely without a blunder . He had wasted no time , and no words , and left no room for consideration , or for that natural relenting towards his rival which was inevitable as soon as Mr Ashburton was off the field . He had insisted , and he had perceived that there was but one alternative for Lucilla . Now that all was over , he took her back to her seat , and comforted her , and made no offensive demonstrations of triumph . "
231348	231372	231373	231373	Tom	117	" he repeated ; and it was utterly impossible to add anything to the eloquent brevity of this succinct statement of the case . "
231375	231387	231373	231373	Tom	117	" said Miss Marjoribanks , when she had a little recovered , "
231433	231434	231422	231422	she	230	" "
231442	231548	231422	231422	she	230	" said Tom ; but all the same he showed not the slightest inclination to go away . He did not quite believe in it as yet , and could not help feeling as if , should he venture to leave her , the whole fabric of his incredible good fortune must dissolve and melt away . As for Lucilla , her self - possession gradually came back to her when the crisis was over , and she felt that her involuntary abdication had lasted long enough , and that it was full time to take the management of affairs back into her own hands . "
231554	231562	231549	231549	You	117	" she said , drying her eyes , "
231680	231717	231672	231673	Mr Tom	117	" said Lucilla hastily , not without a rising colour ; for it was hard to explain why , when his mother was in the blue room all this time , he should have stayed here . "
231727	231820	231720	231721	Miss Lucilla	119	" said Nancy , dropping a doubtful curtsey . And then only Tom was persuaded , and bethought himself of his natural duty , and rushed upstairs . He seized Nancy 's hand , and shook it violently , as he passed her , to her great consternation . The moment of his supremacy was over . It was to be Tom after all ; but Lucilla had recovered her self - possession , and taken the helm in her hand again , and Tom was master of the situation no more . "
231828	231844	231825	231826	Mr Tom	117	" said Lucilla , shaking her head with something between a smile and a sigh . "
231901	231902	231903	231903	I	0	" "
231914	231918	231919	231919	he	117	" said Nancy ; "
231977	232107	231966	231967	Miss Lucilla	119	" And then Miss Marjoribanks made various suggestions , which were received still doubtfully by her prime minister . Nancy , to tell the truth , did not like the turn things were taking . Lucilla 's maiden household had been on the whole getting along very comfortably , and there was no telling how long it might have lasted without any new revolution . To be sure , Mr Ashburton had looked dangerous , but Nancy had seen a great many dangers of that kind blow over , and was not easily alarmed . Mr Tom , however , was a very different person ; and Nancy was sufficiently penetrating to see that something had happened . Therefore , she received very coldly Lucilla 's suggestions about lunch . "
232116	232122	231966	231967	Miss Lucilla	119	" she said at last , "
232139	232165	231966	231967	Miss Lucilla	119	" and Nancy stood turning round the handle of the door in her hand , and contemplating the changed state of affairs with a sigh . "
232179	232183	232173	232173	you	0	" said Lucilla ; "
232245	232249	232252	232253	Mr Tom	117	" said Lucilla ; "
232285	232396	232269	232271	an old dear	4279	" When she had said these words , Lucilla gave her faithful servant a hug , and sent her off to look after Tom Marjoribanks 's meal ; and then she herself went half - way downstairs and picked up the cards that were still scattered about the landing , and found with satisfaction that the Doctor 's old punch - bowl was not broken . All Tom 's things were lying below in the hall — heaps of queer Indian - looking baggage — tossed down anyhow in a corner , as if the owner had been in much too great a hurry to think of any secondary circumstances . "
232407	232469	232265	232265	Nancy	102	" said Lucilla to herself , with a certain pathos . There it was indeed that the encounter had taken place . They had seen each other but for a moment , but that moment had been enough to send the Member for Carlingford away dejected , and to impress upon Tom 's mind the alternative that it was either to be "
232474	232935	232936	232936	Lucilla	119	" Miss Marjoribanks contemplated the spot with a certain tender sentimental interest , as any gentle moralist might look at a field of battle . What feelings must have been in the minds of the two as they met and looked at each other ! What a dread sense of disappointment on the one side ; what sharp stimulation on the other ! Thus Lucilla stood and looked down from her own landing upon the scene of that encounter , full of pensive interest . And now it was all over , and Mr Ashburton had passed away as completely as Mr Chiltern , who was in his grave , poor man ; or Mr Cavendish , who was going to marry Barbara Lake . The thought of so sudden a revolution made Lucilla giddy as she went thoughtfully upstairs . Poor Mr Ashburton ! It hardly seemed real even to Miss Marjoribanks when she sat down again in the drawing - room , and confessed to herself that , after all , it was to be Tom . But when he came downstairs again with his mother , Lucilla was quite herself , and had got over all her weakness . Aunt Jemima , for her part , was in a very agitated state of mind . Tom had come too soon or Mr Ashburton too late , and all the fruits of her little bit of treachery were accordingly lost , and at the same time , the treachery itself remained , revealed at least to one person in the very clearest light . It did not seem possible to Aunt Jemima that Lucilla would not tell . If she had not done it now , in the excitement of the moment , at least it would come out some time when she was least expecting it , and her son 's esteem and confidence would be lost . Therefore it was with a very blank countenance that Mrs John Marjoribanks came downstairs . She dared not say a word , and she had to kiss her niece , and take her to her maternal bosom , Tom looking on all the while ; but she gave Lucilla a look that was pitiful to see . And when Tom finally was dismissed to his room , to open his trunks , and show the things he had brought home , Aunt Jemima drew near her future daughter with wistful guiltiness . There was no comfort to her in the thought of the India shawl , which her son had gone to find . Any day , any hour , Lucilla might tell ; and if the unlucky mother were put on her defence , what could she say ? "
232938	232948	232936	232936	Lucilla	119	" said the guilty woman , under her breath , "
233027	233028	233030	233030	you	0	" "
233035	233044	233030	233030	you	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with gentle wonder . "
233059	233060	233047	233047	you	119	" "
233068	233080	233063	233063	I	0	" said the poor lady , with great relief and eagerness . "
233145	233146	233147	233149	Dear Aunt Jemima	230	" "
233151	233156	233147	233149	Dear Aunt Jemima	230	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
233177	233197	233169	233169	I	0	" And Mrs John took her niece into her arms again this time with better will , and cried . "
233208	233214	233198	233198	I	0	" said the inconsistent mother . "
233266	234297	233251	233251	you	119	" cried the repentant sinner . Lucilla was not the woman to resist such an appeal . Mrs John had meant truly enough towards her in other ways , if not in this way ; and Miss Marjoribanks was fond of her aunt , and it ended in a kiss of peace freely bestowed , and a vow of protection and guidance from the strong to the weak , though the last was only uttered in the protectress 's liberal heart . When Miss Marjoribanks had time to consider the prospect which had thus so suddenly opened before her , it also had its difficulties , like everything else in the world . Her marriage now could not be the straightforward business it might have been had it been Mr Ashburton instead of Tom . In that case she would have gone to an established house and life — to take her place in the one and her share in the other , and to find the greater part of her surroundings and duties already fixed for her , which was a thing that would have very greatly simplified the matter . But Tom , who had dashed home from India at full speed as soon as he heard of his uncle 's death , had left his profession behind him at Calcutta , and had nothing to do in England , and was probably too old to resume his ( non ) practice at the bar , even if he had been in the least disposed to do so ; while , at the same time , an idle man — a man to be found everlastingly at home — would have been insupportable to Lucilla . Miss Marjoribanks might feel disposed ( for everybody 's good ) to assume the sovereign authority in her own house , but to marry anybody that would be merely an appendage to her was a thing not to be thought of ; and as soon as the first preliminaries were arranged her active mind sprang up with redoubled vigour from the maze in which it had been . Her intelligence had suspended , so to speak , all its ordinary operations for twenty - four hours at least , while it was busy investigating the purely personal question : from the moment when the Member for Carlingford was finally elected until Tom Marjoribanks rang the night - bell at the old Doctor 's door , Lucilla 's thoughts had been in that state of over - stimulation and absorption which is almost as bad as having no power of thought at all . But as soon as the pressure was removed — as soon as it was all over , and the decision made , and no further question was possible — then Miss Marjoribanks 's active mind sprang up with renewed energy . For it was not only a new beginning , but everything had to be settled and arranged . Her mind was full of it while her hands were busy putting away all the Indian presents which Tom had brought — presents which were chronological in their character , and which he had begun to accumulate from the very beginning of his exile . It could not but be touching to Lucilla to see how he had thought of her for all these years ; but her mind being , as everybody is aware , of a nobly practical kind , her thoughts , instead of dallying with these tokens of the past , went forward with serious solicitude into the future . The marriage could not take place until the year was out ; and there was , accordingly , time to arrange everything , and to settle all the necessary preliminaries to a point as near perfection as is possible to merely human details . Tom , no doubt , was very urgent and pressing , and would have precipitated everything , and had the whole business concluded to - morrow , if he could have had his way . But the fact was that , having once given in to him in the memorable way which we have already recorded , Lucilla did not now , so far as the final arrangements were concerned , make much account of Tom 's wishes . Heaven be praised , there was one of the two who knew what was right and proper , and was not to be moved from the correct path by any absurd representations . Miss Marjoribanks was revolving all these important questions when she laid her hand by chance , as people say , upon the Carlingford Gazette , all damp and inky , which had just been laid upon the library table . It contained , of course , all the news of the election , but Lucilla was too well acquainted with that beforehand to think of condescending to derive her information from a newspaper . She looked at the advertisements with an eye which saw all that was there without pausing upon anything in particular . She saw the usual notice about marmalade oranges , and the announcement that young Mr Vincent , who after that made himself so well known in Carlingford , was to preach the next Sunday in Salem Chapel , and all the other important novelties in the place ; but naturally she took but a moderate amount of interest in such details as these . Suddenly , however , Lucilla 's eye , which , if it could ever be said to be vacant , had been regarding vacantly the list of advertisements , kindled up , and all its usual energy and intelligence came back to it . Her thoughtful face woke up as from a dream . Her head , which had been drooping in pensive meditation , grew erect — her whole figure expanded . She clasped her hands together , as if in the fervour of the moment , nobody else being present , she could not refrain from shaking hands with herself , and giving vent to a self - congratulation . "
234304	234460	234463	234463	their	4287	" said Lucilla to herself , with her usual piety ; and then she folded up the paper in a little square , with the announcement in the middle which had struck her so much , and placed it where Tom could not fail to see it when he came in , and went upstairs with a new and definite direction given to her thoughts . That was how it must be ! Lucilla , for her part , felt no difficulty in discerning the leadings of Providence , and she could not but appreciate the readiness with which her desires were attended to , and the prompt clearing - up of her difficulties . There are people whose inclinations Providence does not seem to superintend with such painstaking watchfulness ; but then , no doubt , that must be their own fault . And when Tom came in , they had what Aunt Jemima called "
234465	234508	234463	234463	their	4287	" about their future life , although the only thing in it worthy consideration , so far as Tom was concerned , seemed to be the time when they should be married , which occupied at present all that hero 's faculties . "
234519	234527	234516	234516	you	4288	" he said , with calm confidence . "
234579	234580	234564	234564	you	4288	" "
234593	234601	234585	234585	I	0	" said Lucilla , interrupting him sweetly , "
234619	234628	234615	234617	poor dear papa	4293	" Miss Marjoribanks added , with a sigh , "
234685	234686	234665	234665	Tom	117	" "
234693	234698	234665	234665	Tom	117	" said Tom quickly , "
234728	234749	234722	234722	you	117	" Miss Marjoribanks regarded her betrothed with mild and affectionate contempt as he thus delivered himself of his foolish sentiments . "
234761	234771	234722	234722	you	117	" she said , with an air of resignation . "
234792	234793	234776	234776	I	0	" "
234800	234804	234776	234776	I	0	" said Tom , "
234856	234910	234911	234911	My	0	" cried the honest fellow — and Lucilla could not but cast a despairing glance round her , as if appealing to heaven and earth . What was to be done with a man who had so little understanding of her , and of himself , and of the eternal fitness of things ? "
234915	234923	234911	234911	My	0	" she said once more , mildly , "
234980	234984	234986	234986	I	0	" said Lucilla , "
235002	235003	235004	235004	My	0	" "
235033	235100	235020	235020	I	0	" cried Tom . This kind of adoration was new to Lucilla , notwithstanding her many experiences . And he thought it so good of her to condescend to be good , that she could not help thinking a little better of herself than ordinary , though that , perhaps , was not absolutely needful ; and then she proceeded with the elucidation of her views . "
235116	235122	235101	235101	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks modestly , "
235221	235231	235248	235248	They	4391	" said Lucilla , with a little natural sadness , "
235309	235356	235261	235261	I	0	" Lucilla paused , for naturally her feelings were moved , and while Tom bent over her with tender and respectful devotion , it was not to be wondered at if Miss Marjoribanks , in the emotion of her heart , should wipe away a tear . "
235365	235369	235261	235261	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
235395	235398	235393	235393	Tom	117	" she added solemnly—"they
235463	235469	235457	235461	a woman in a mill	4314	" said the disappointed reformer , "
235476	235477	235478	235478	My	0	" "
235482	235509	235478	235478	My	0	" cried Tom , who would have liked to go and challenge Carlingford for being so insensible to his Lucilla 's devotion and cherishing maternal care . "
235518	235529	235515	235516	the poor	4303	" said Miss Marjoribanks , recovering her spirits a little , "
235635	235636	235599	235599	You	117	" "
235640	235689	235690	235690	I	0	" cried Tom , in consternation ; and the magnitude of the word was such , and Lucilla was so entirely in earnest , that he jumped from his chair and gazed at her as if constrained , notwithstanding his amazement , to rush off instantly and obey . "
235698	235702	235690	235690	I	0	" said Lucilla ; "
235765	235766	235768	235768	Lucilla	119	" "
235770	235781	235768	235768	Lucilla	119	" said Tom , recovering a little from his consternation , "
235835	235836	235837	235837	We	4326	" "
235843	235853	235837	235837	We	4326	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with a benevolent smile , "
235959	235970	235954	235954	he	295	" said Lucilla , putting her handkerchief to her eyes , "
236053	236806	236807	236808	the boy	908	" Lucilla 's proposition , as it thus unfolded itself , took away Tom Marjoribanks 's breath , for notwithstanding that it came from a ( young ) lady , and was confused by some slightly unintelligible conditions about doing good to one 's fellow - creatures , it was not a trifling or romantic suggestion . Tom , too , could remember Marchbank , and his uncle 's interest in it , and the careful way in which he explained to the ignorant that this was the correct pronunciation of his own name . While Lucilla made her concluding address , Tom seemed to see himself a little fellow , with his eyes and his ears very wide open , trotting about with small steps after the Doctor , as he went over the red - brick house and neglected gardens at Marchbank : it was only to be let then , and had passed through many hands , and was in miserable case , both lands and house . But neither the lands nor the house were bad of themselves , and Tom was , like Lucilla , perfectly well aware that something might be made of them . This idea gave a new direction to his thoughts . Though he had been brought up to the bar , he had never been a lover of town , and was in reality , like so many young Englishmen , better qualified to be something in the shape of a country gentleman than for any other profession in the world ; and he had left his profession behind , and was in most urgent want of something to do . He did not give in at once with a lover 's abject submission , but thought it over for twenty - four hours at all his spare moments,—when he was smoking his evening cigar in the garden , and studying the light in his lady 's window , and when he ought to have been asleep , and again in the morning when he sallied forth , before Miss Marjoribanks 's blinds were drawn up or the house had fairly awoke . He was not a man of brilliant ability , but he had that sure and steady eye for the real secret of a position which must have been revealed to every competent critic by the wonderful clear - sightedness with which he saw , and the wise persistence with which he held to the necessity of an immediate choice between himself and Mr Ashburton . He had seen that there was but one alternative , and he had suffered no delay nor divergence from the question in hand . And it was this same quality which had helped him to the very pretty addition to his small patrimony which he had meant to settle on Lucilla , and which would now make the acquisition of Marchbank an easy thing enough . And though Tom had looked wise on the subject of investment in land , it was a kind of investment in every way agreeable to him . Thus Lucilla 's arrow went straight to the mark — straighter even than she had expected ; for besides all the other and more substantial considerations , there was to Tom 's mind a sweet sense of poetic justice in the thought that , after his poor uncle 's failure , who had never thought him good enough for Lucilla , it should be he and no other who would give this coveted possession to his cousin . Had Marchbank been in the market in Dr Marjoribanks 's time , it was , as Lucilla herself said , his money that would have bought it ; but in such a case , so far as the Doctor was concerned , there would have been little chance for Tom . Now all that was changed , and it was in Tom 's hands that the wealth of the family lay . It was he who was the head , and could alone carry out what Lucilla 's more original genius suggested . If the Doctor could but have seen it , he who had formed plans so very different — but perhaps by that time Dr Marjoribanks had found out that Providence after all had not been so ill - advised as he once thought in committing to his care such a creative intelligence as that of Lucilla , and withholding from him "
236810	237153	236807	236808	the boy	908	" As for Miss Marjoribanks , after she had made up her mind and stated her conviction , she gave herself no further trouble on the subject , but took it for granted , with that true wisdom which is unfortunately so rare among women . She did not talk about it overmuch , or display any feverish anxiety about Marchbank , but left her suggestion to work , and had faith in Tom . At the same time , the tranquillising sense of now knowing , to a certain extent , what lay before her came into Lucilla 's mind . It would be a new sphere , but a sphere in which she would find herself at home . Still near enough to Carlingford to keep a watchful eye upon society and give it the benefit of her experience , and yet at the same time translated into a new world , where her influence might be of untold advantage , as Lucilla modestly said , to her fellow - creatures . There was a village not far from the gates at Marchbank , where every kind of village nuisance was to be found . There are people who are very tragical about village nuisances , and there are other people who assail them with loathing , as a duty forced upon their consciences ; but Lucilla was neither of the one way of thinking nor of the other . It gave her the liveliest satisfaction to think of all the disorder and disarray of the Marchbank village . Her fingers itched to be at it — to set all the crooked things straight , and clean away the rubbish , and set everything , as she said , on a sound foundation . If it had been a model village , with prize flower - gardens and clean as Arcadia , the thought of it would not have given Miss Marjoribanks half so much pleasure . The recollection of all the wretched hovels and miserable cottages exhilarated her heart . "
237165	237171	237154	237154	They	4335	" she said to herself , "
237188	237509	237513	237514	a cousin	4757	" Perhaps it was not the highest motive possible , and it might be more satisfactory to some people to think of Lucilla as actuated by lofty sentiments of philanthropy ; but to persons acquainted with Miss Marjoribanks 's character , her biographer would scorn to make any pretence . What would be the good of a spirit full of boundless activity and benevolent impulses if there was nobody to help?—what would be the use of self - devotion if the race in general stood in no need of charitable ministrations ? Lucilla had been of use to her fellow - creatures all her life ; and though she was about to relinquish one branch of usefulness , that was not to say that she should be prevented from entering into another . The state of the Marchbank village did her good to the very bottom of her soul . It justified her to herself for her choice of Tom , which , but for this chance of doing good , might perhaps have had the air of a merely selfish personal preference . Now she could regard it in a loftier light , and the thought was sweet to Lucilla ; for such a beautiful way of helping her neighbour would no doubt have been to a certain extent impracticable amid the many occupations of the Member 's wife . Perhaps the most difficult thing in Miss Marjoribanks 's way at this otherwise satisfactory moment was the difficulty she found in persuading society , first of the reality , and then of the justice , of the step she had taken . Most of them , to tell the truth , had forgotten all about Tom Marjoribanks . It is true that when Lucilla 's intentions and prospects were discussed in Grange Lane , as they had been so often , it was not uncommon for people to say , "
237518	237711	237516	237516	you	4337	" ; but nobody had ever given very much heed to the suggestion . When Lucilla went to tell Mrs Chiley of what had happened , she was but inadequately prepared for the surprise with which her intelligence was received . For it all seemed natural enough to Miss Marjoribanks . She had gone on very steadily for a long time , without thinking particularly about anybody , and disposed to accept the most eligible and satisfactory person who happened to present himself ; but all the time there had been a warm corner in her heart for Tom . And then the eligible person had not come , and she had been worried and wearied , and had had her losses , like most other people . And it had always been pleasant to remember that there was one man in the world who , if she but held out a finger to him —— But then the people in Grange Lane were not capable of discrimination on such a delicate subject , and had never , as was to be expected , had the smallest insight into Lucilla 's heart . "
237721	237727	237719	237719	Lucilla	119	" said old Mrs Chiley . "
237777	237778	237779	237781	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" "
237783	237787	237779	237781	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" said Lucilla , "
237825	237930	237931	237931	I	0	" Mrs Chiley gave her young friend , who was leaning over her , a hug , which was the only answer which could be made to so touching a speech , and drew Lucilla down upon a low chair that had been placed by the side of her sofa . She kept Miss Marjoribanks 's hand in her own , and caressed it , and looked at her with satisfaction in every line of her face . After waiting so long , and having so many disappointments , everything was going to turn out so entirely as it ought to do at last . "
237946	237951	237936	237936	you	96	" said Mrs Chiley ; "
238030	238141	238024	238024	his	595	" This was the moment , if there ever was such a moment , when Lucilla lost courage . Mrs Chiley was so entirely confident as to what was coming , and it was something so different that was really coming ; and it was hard upon Miss Marjoribanks to feel that she was about to disappoint everybody 's expectations . She had to clear her throat before she spoke — she who was generally so ready for every emergency ; and she could not help feeling for the moment as if she was a young girl who had run away with somebody , and deceived all her anxious friends . "
238159	238163	238149	238149	I	0	" said Lucilla . "
238206	238241	238242	238242	I	0	" Here the old lady , to Lucilla 's surprise , rose up upon her pillows and threw her arms round her , and kissed her over again , and fell a - crying . "
238252	238257	238247	238247	you	0	" cried Mrs Chiley . "
238320	238408	238409	238409	I	0	" This unlooked - for burst of enthusiasm took Lucilla entirely by surprise . She could not say in reply that Mr Cavendish did not want her to make it up to him ; but the fact that this was the only alternative which occurred to Mrs Chiley filled Miss Marjoribanks with a sense of something like positive guilt . She had deceived everybody , and raised false expectations , and how was she to explain herself ? It was with humility and embarrassment that she spoke . "
238425	238429	238414	238414	you	0	" she said . "
238498	238499	238500	238500	Lucilla	119	" "
238506	238535	238500	238500	Lucilla	119	" said Mrs Chiley , growing pale — for she generally had a little wintry bloom on her cheek like the China roses she was so fond of . "
238545	238546	238500	238500	Lucilla	119	" "
238551	238561	238547	238549	Dear Mrs Chiley	96	" said Lucilla , with the brevity of excitement , "
238580	238663	238578	238578	Tom	117	" Poor Mrs Chiley started , so that the sofa and Lucilla 's chair and the very room shook . She said herself afterwards that she felt as if somebody had discharged a pistol into her breast . She was so shocked and startled that she threw off all her coverings and the Afghanistan blanket Mrs Beverley had sent , and put her tottering old feet to the floor ; and then she took her young friend solemnly by both her hands . "
238672	238676	238666	238666	Lucilla	119	" she cried , "
238813	238966	238785	238785	He	222	" Miss Marjoribanks was quite carried away for the moment by this flood of sorrowful eloquence . She was silenced , and had nothing to answer , and accepted it as in some respect the just penalty for the disappointment she was causing everybody . She let Mrs Chiley say out her say , and then she restored the old lady to her sofa , and made her comfortable , and covered her up with all her wraps and blankets . Though she ran on in a feeble strain all the time weeping and lamenting , Lucilla took no notice . She wrapped her old friend up , and put her pillows just as she liked them , and sat down again on the low chair ; and by that time the poor old lady had sunk into a faint sob of vexation and disappointment , and had given her remonstrances up . "
238977	238982	238969	238969	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks . "
239012	239013	239007	239008	Mr Ashburton	222	" "
239021	239032	239015	239015	you	4357	" Mrs Chiley asked , with horror in her face . "
239047	239058	239060	239060	you	4357	" said Lucilla , with the force of conscious virtue , "
239094	239105	239085	239085	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with sweet confidence and simplicity , "
239138	239224	239225	239225	I	0	" Mrs Chiley turned round with unaffected surprise , which was not unmingled with awe . Up to this moment she had been under the impression that it was the blindness , and folly , and stupidity of the gentlemen which had kept it from ever coming to anything . It was altogether a new light that broke upon her now , confusing , though on the whole satisfactory ; but for the moment she was struck dumb , and had no answer to make . "
239235	239244	239229	239229	myself	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , with confidential tenderness , "
239344	239421	239329	239329	Tom	117	" Mrs Chiley was still so much confounded by this unexpected revelation that it was some time before she could find her voice ; and even now the light penetrated slowly into her mind , and it was only by degrees that she accepted the new fact thus presented to her faith — that it was not the gentlemen who were to blame — that it was all Lucilla 's or rather Tom Marjoribanks 's fault . "
239428	239433	239423	239424	Mr Ashburton	222	" she asked faintly . "
239439	239444	239434	239434	I	0	" said Miss Marjoribanks , "
239505	239509	239498	239498	I	0	" Lucilla added , "
239551	239552	239549	239549	Tom	117	" "
239563	239580	239555	239555	Lucilla	119	" said Mrs Chiley , who could not reconcile herself to the new condition of affairs . "
239699	239710	239677	239677	he	4367	" And once more Mrs Chiley gave a little sob . "
239723	239727	239711	239712	The Firs	56	" she said , "
239736	239771	239734	239734	Lucilla	119	" As for Miss Marjoribanks , she knelt down by the side of the sofa and took her old friend , as well as the blankets and pillows would permit , into her arms . "
239785	239795	239796	239796	You	96	" said Lucilla , weeping a little for company . "
239824	239929	239940	239940	Lucilla	119	" Miss Marjoribanks said in her excitement . It was a revelation which came out unawares , and which she never intended to utter ; but it threw a gleam of light over the new world of ambition and progress which was opened to Lucilla 's far - seeing vision ; and Mrs Chiley could not but yield to the spell of mingled awe and sympathy which thrilled through her as she listened . It was not to be supposed that what Lucilla did was done upon mere unthinking impulse ; and when she thought of Marchbank , there arose in Mrs Chiley 's mind "
239936	239937	239940	239940	Lucilla	119	" "
239942	239962	239940	239940	Lucilla	119	" the old lady said with solemnity , as she gave her a last kiss of reconciliation and peace , "
239997	240188	239995	239995	Tom	117	" This was the hardest personal encounter which Miss Marjoribanks was subjected to ; but when the news circulated in Grange Lane there was first a dead pause of incredulity and amazement , and then such a commotion as could be compared to nothing except a sudden squall at sea . People who had been going peaceably on their way at one moment , thinking of nothing , were to be seen the next buffeted by the wind of Rumour and tossed about on the waves of Astonishment . To speak less metaphorically ( but there are moments of emotion so overwhelming and unprecedented that they can be dealt with only in the language of metaphor ) , every household in Grange Lane , and at least half of the humbler houses in Grove Street , and a large proportion of the other dwellings in Carlingford , were nearly as much agitated about Lucilla 's marriage as if it had been a daughter of their own . Now that he was recalled to their minds in such a startling way , people began to recollect with greater and greater distinctness that "
240198	240327	240328	240328	She	4376	" and to remember him in his youth , and even in his boyhood , when he had been much in Carlingford . And by degrees the Grange Lane people came to see that they knew a great deal about Tom , and to remind each other of the abrupt end of his last visit , and of his going to India immediately after , and of many a little circumstance in Lucilla 's looks and general demeanour which this dénouement seemed to make plain . Lady Richmond , though she was a little annoyed about Mr Ashburton 's disappointment , decided at once that it was best to ignore that altogether , and was quite glad to think that she had always said there must be somebody . "
240342	240351	240328	240328	She	4376	" she said , when discussing the matter . "
240393	241094	240375	240375	she	4376	" This was a speech which Mrs Woodburn , as might have been expected , made a great deal of — but , notwithstanding , it had its effect in Grange Lane . Going back upon their recollections , most people were able to verify the fact that Miss Marjoribanks had borne her little disappointments very well , and that there was sometimes a preoccupation in her eye . The first was beyond dispute ; and as for the second , it was a thing which did not require a very great stretch of imagination to suppose — and the unexpected sensation of finding at last a distinct bit of romance to round off Lucilla 's history , was pleasant to most people . If she had married Mr Ashburton , it would have been ( so far as anything connected with Miss Marjoribanks could be ) a commonplace conclusion . But now she had upset everybody 's theories , and made an altogether original and unlooked - for ending for herself , which was a thing to have been expected from Lucilla , though nobody could have foreseen the special turn which her originality would take . And nothing could have come in more appropriately after the election , when people felt the blank of ordinary existence just beginning to settle down upon them again . It kept all Carlingford in conversation for a longer time than might be supposed in these busy days ; for there was not only the fact itself , but what they were to do , and where they were to go , to be discussed . And then Tom himself began to be visible about Grange Lane ; and he had heaps of Indian things among his baggage , and recollected so affectionately the people he used to know , and dispensed his curiosities with such a liberal hand , that the heart of Carlingford was touched . He had a way of miscalculating distances , as has been said , and exercised some kind of magnetic influence upon all the little tables and unsteady articles of furniture , which somehow seemed to fall if he but looked at them . But , on the other hand , John Brown , who had in hand the sale of Marchbank , found him the most straightforward and clear - headed of clients . The two had all the preliminaries arranged before any other intending purchaser had time to turn the matter over in his mind . And Tom had the old brick house full of workmen before anybody knew it was his . When the summer had fairly commenced he went over and lived there , and saw to everything , and went so far as to fit up the drawing - room with the same well - remembered tint of pale green which had been found ten years ago to suit so well with Lucilla 's complexion . It was perhaps a little hazardous to repeat the experiment , for green , as everybody knows , is a very trying colour ; but it was a most touching and triumphant proof that to Tom , at least , Lucilla was as young as ever , and had not even begun to go off . It was Mr Holden who supplied everything , and he was naturally proud of the trust thus reposed in him , and formed the very highest opinion of his customer ; and it was probably from his enthusiasm on this subject that might be traced the commencement of that singular revolution of sentiment in Grange Lane , which suddenly woke up all in an instant without knowing how , to recognise the existence of Mr Marjoribanks , and to forget the undue familiarity which had ventured upon the name of Tom . When Lucilla went over in the most proper and decorous way , under the charge of Aunt Jemima , to see her future home , the sight of the village at Marchbank was sweet to her eyes . That it was not by any means sweet to any other sense did but enhance Miss Marjoribanks 's satisfaction . "
241100	241490	240375	240375	she	4376	" she said to herself , and her bosom swelled ; for to realise clearly how much she had it in her power to do for her fellow - creatures was indeed a pleasure . It occupied her a great deal more than the gardens did , which Tom was arranging so carefully , or even than the kitchen , which she inspected for the information of Nancy ; for at that time the drawing - room was not fitted up . Lucilla 's eyes went over the moral wilderness with the practical glance of a statesman , and , at the same time , the sanguine enthusiasm of a philanthropist . She saw of what it was capable , and already , in imagination , the desert blossomed like a rose before her beneficent steps , and the sweet sense of well - doing rose in her breast . And then to see Tom at Marchbank was to see his qualities . He was not a man of original mind , nor one who would be likely to take a bold initiative . Considering all the circumstances , that was a gift which was scarcely to be wished for ; but he had a perfect genius for carrying out a suggestion , which , it need scarcely be added , was a faculty that , considering the good fortune which Providence had so long reserved for him , made his character as near perfect as humanity permits . Lucilla felt , indeed , as she drove away , that approbation of Providence which a well - regulated mind , in possession of most things which it desires , might be expected to feel . Other delusive fancies had one time and another swept across her horizon ; but after all there could be no doubt that only thus could she have been fitly mated , and full development afforded to all the resources of her spirit . As the carriage passed the Firs she sighed and put down her veil with a natural sentiment ; but still she felt it was for the best . The Member for Carlingford must be a busy man , occupied about his own affairs , and with little leisure for doing good to his fellow - creatures except in a parliamentary way . "
241500	242024	240375	240375	she	4376	" Lucilla , in the depths of her soul , said to herself . Then there rose up before her a vision of a parish saved , a village reformed , a county reorganised , and a triumphant election at the end , the recompense and crown of all , which should put the government of the country itself , to a certain extent , into competent hands . This was the celestial vision which floated before Miss Marjoribanks 's eyes as she drove into Carlingford , and recollected , notwithstanding occasional moments of discouragement , the successful work she had done , and the good she had achieved in her native town . It was but the natural culmination of her career that transferred her from the town to the county , and held out to her the glorious task of serving her generation in a twofold way , among the poor and among the rich . If a momentary sigh for Grange Lane , which was about to lose her , breathed from her lips , it was sweetened by a smile of satisfaction for the county which was about to gain her . The lighter preface of life was past , and Lucilla had the comfort of feeling that its course had been full of benefit to her fellow - creatures ; and now a larger sphere opened before her feet , and Miss Marjoribanks felt that the arrangements of Providence were on the whole full of discrimination , and that all was for the best , and she had not lived in vain . This being the case , perhaps it is not necessary to go much further into detail . Mr Ashburton never said anything about his disappointment , as might have been expected . When he did mention that eventful day at all , he said that he had happened accidentally to be calling on Miss Marjoribanks the day her cousin came home , and saw at once the state of affairs ; and he sent her a very nice present when she was married . After all , it was not her fault . If Providence had ordained that it was to be Tom , how could Lucilla fly in the face of such an ordinance ? and , at the same time , there was to both parties the consoling reflection , that whatever might happen to them as individuals , the best man had been chosen for Carlingford , which was an abiding benefit to all concerned . Under all the circumstances , it was to be looked for that Miss Marjoribanks 's spirits should improve even in her mourning , and that the tenacity with which she clung to her father 's house should yield to the changed state of affairs . This was so much the case , that Lucilla took heart to show Mrs Rider all over it , and to point out all the conveniences to her , and even , with a sigh , to call her attention to the bell which hung over the Doctor 's bedroom door . "
242033	242038	240375	240375	she	4376	" Miss Marjoribanks said ; "
242050	242164	242041	242042	Dr Rider	200	" It was a very nice house ; and so the new Doctor 's wife , who had not been used to anything so spacious , was very willing to say ; and instead of feeling any grudge against the man who was thus in every respect to take her father 's place , so sweet are the softening influences of time and personal well - being , that Lucilla , who was always so good - natured , made many little arrangements for their comfort , and even left the carpets , which was a thing nobody could have expected of her , and which Aunt Jemima did not scruple to condemn . "
242170	242174	242165	242165	They	4382	" Lucilla said , "
242199	242336	242359	242359	she	119	" It was a very kind thing to do , and simplified matters very much for the Riders , who were not rich . But Aunt Jemima , in the background , could not but pull Lucilla 's sleeve , and mutter indistinct remarks about a valuation , which nobody paid any particular attention to at the moment , as there were so many things much more important to think of and to do . And the presents that came pouring in from every quarter were enough to have made up for twenty carpets . Lucilla got testimonials , so to speak , from every side , and all Carlingford interested itself , as has been said , in all the details of the marriage , as if it had been a daughter of its own . "
