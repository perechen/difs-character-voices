767	926	761	761	his	753	" Allow me , Mrs. Vaughan — allow me , my dear sir — to congratulate you cordially . The head is a noble and honest one . It is the growth of the brain that causes these little commotions ; but the congestion will not be permanent . The fits , that have so alarmed you , are at this age a good symptom ; in fact , they are Nature 's remedy . They may last for seven years , or even for ten ; of course they will not depart at once . But the attacks will be milder , and the intervals longer , when she has turned fourteen . For the intellect you need have no fear whatever . Only keep her quiet , and never force her to learn . She must only learn when it comes as it were with the wind . She will never forget what she does learn . "

9728	9841	9725	9725	she	1090	" you will excuse what I am about to say , as I only speak for your good , and from a humble sense that it is the path of duty . It has pleased God , in His infinite wisdom , to afflict your dear mother with a melancholy so sensitive , that she can not bear any allusion to your deeply - lamented father . You have therefore no female guidance upon a subject which justly occupies so much of your thoughts . Your uncle Edgar , in his true affection for you , has thought it right that you should associate more with persons calculated to develop your mind . "

9865	9973	9860	9860	her	1093	" Under these circumstances , it grieves me deeply , my poor dear child , to find you still display a perversity , and a wilful neglect of the blessed means of grace , which must ( humanly speaking ) draw down a judgment upon you . Now , open your heart to me , the whole of your little unregenerate heart , you mysterious but ( I firmly believe ) not ill - disposed lambkin . Tell me all your thoughts , your broodings , your dreams — in fact , your entire experiences . Uncle Edgar will leave the room , if you wish it . "

I take the deepest interest in you . True , I am only a weak and sinful woman , but my chastisements have worked together for my edification , and God has been graciously pleased to grant me peace of mind . "

10118	10257	10115	10115	she	1094	" I have been troubled and chastened severely , but now I perceive that it was all for the best . But perhaps it is not very graceful to remind me of that . Yet , since all my trials have worked together for my good , on that account I am , under Providence , better qualified to advise you , in your dark and perilous state . I have seen much of what thoughtless people call ' life . ' But in helping you , I wish to proceed on higher principles than those of the world . You possess , beyond question , a strong and resolute will , but in your present benighted course it can lead only to misery . Now , what is the principal aim of your life , my love ? "
10258	10267	10115	10115	she	1094	" The death of my father 's murderer . "
10268	10318	10423	10423	she	912	" Exactly so . My unhappy child , I knew it too well . Though a dark sin is your leading star , I feel too painfully my own shortcomings , and old unregenerate tendencies , to refuse you my carnal sympathy . You know my feelings , Edgar . "

And your guardian has this arrangement so very much at heart . My own dear child , I have felt for you so long that I love you as a daughter . How thankful I ought to be to the Giver of all good things to have you really my own dear child . "

If only for your dear mother 's sake , as well as your father 's , it is the path of duty . Let me tell you , both she and yourself are very much more in your guardian 's power than you have any idea . And what would be your poor father 's wish , who has left you so entirely to his brother 's care and discretion ? Will you put off for ever the discovery of his murderer ? "

19070	19125	19067	19067	he	1303	" you are an odd girl , and a Vaughan all over . I would rather be your friend than your enemy . If you can not like me , at least forget your dislike of me , and remember that I am your uncle , and have tried to make you love me . "
19126	19134	19175	19175	he	1304	" And what if I do not ? "
19135	19173	19175	19175	he	1304	" Then I must keep you awhile from the management of this property . My dear brother would have wished it , until you recover your senses ; and not an acre of it is legally yours . "
19258	19266	19267	19267	I	0	" Will the property pass to you ? "
19270	19286	19267	19267	I	0	" Yes , if I choose : or at any rate the bulk of it . "
19287	19303	19213	19213	I	0	" What part will be yours ? Do you mean to say the house ? — "
19304	19326	19267	19267	I	0	" Never mind now . I would rather leave things as they are , if you will only be more sensible . "
19327	19358	19267	19267	I	0	" I will not disguise my opinions for a hundred Vaughan Parks , or a thousand Vaughan Palaces ; no , nor even to be near my father 's bones . "
19359	19363	19364	19364	he	1306	" Very well , "
19367	19388	19364	19364	he	1306	" just as you like . But for your mother 's sake , I give you till Christmas to consider . "
19389	19407	19267	19267	I	0	" If you bring back Mrs. Daldy , I shall leave the door as she enters it . "
19408	19417	19418	19418	he	1306	" I have no wish to hurry you , "
19421	19477	19418	19418	he	1306	" and therefore she shall not return at present . Now take these papers with you . You may lay them before any lawyer you please . They are only copies , but may be compared with the originals , which I have . They will quickly prove how totally you are at my discretion . "
19478	19518	19519	19519	He	1306	" The money and the land may be so , but not I. Before I go , answer me one question . Did you know of these things , whatever they may be , before my father 's death ? "
19541	19552	19519	19519	He	1306	" No . As a gentleman , I did not . "

21465	21487	21458	21458	he	1381	" I knew you could n't do it , because I seemed , somehow , it was n't like a Vaughan . "
21968	21989	21990	21990	He	912	" Seven years ago , at this very moment , my father was killed . Do you know this dagger ? "
22011	22018	22019	22019	I	0	" You know it , then ? "
22030	22039	22019	22019	I	0	" It was your hand that used it . "
22076	22079	22080	22080	he	912	" Yes , "
22083	22097	22080	22080	he	912	" I have seen that weapon before . Alas my poor dear brother ! "
22129	22136	22137	22137	I	0	" You know who owned it ? "
22147	22176	22137	22137	I	0	" Yes . I know who owned it once ; but many years ago . And I know not in the least what is become of him now . "
22639	22648	22649	22649	he	912	" Your mother shall have a home here , "
22652	22807	22649	22649	he	912	" as long as ever she wants one ; but as for you , malignant or mad , I will try no more to soften you . When first I saw you in your early childhood , you flew at me as a murderer . Soon after you ransacked my cupboards and stole my boots , to compare them with some impressions or casts you kept . Yes , you look astonished . I never told you of it , but I knew it for all that . Of those absurdities I thought little , for I regarded them as the follies of a mad child , and I pitied you deeply , and even liked you for your filial devotion . But now I find that you have grown up in the same belief , and you dare even now to avow it . You know that I have no fear of you . "
22808	22817	22821	22821	he	1403	" Then why had you got that pistol ? "
22832	22874	22821	22821	he	1403	" In a house like this , where such deeds have been done , I think it right to be armed . Do you think if I had feared you , or your evidence , I would have restored that dagger ? "
22875	22880	22649	22649	he	912	" Whose was it ? "
22881	22914	22649	22649	he	912	" I told you the other night that I once saw a weapon like it , for which at first I mistook it , but closer examination convinced me of the difference . "
22915	22921	22649	22649	he	912	" How does it differ ? "
22922	22946	22649	22649	he	912	" In this . There was no snake on the handle of the other , though there was the cross on the blade . "
22947	22956	22649	22649	he	912	" And where did you see the other ? "
22957	22974	22649	22649	he	912	" Some day I will tell you . It is not right to do so now . "
22975	22986	22649	22649	he	912	" Not convenient to you , I suppose you mean . "
22987	23094	23095	23095	He	1404	" I have also shown you that the lock of hair found in your poor mother 's hand is much finer and more silky than mine ; and you know that I can not draw on my foot a boot so small as the one whose impression you have . But I am ashamed of myself for having stooped to such proofs as these . Dare you to look at me and suppose that I with my own hand could have stabbed my brother , a brother so kind and good to me , and for whose sake alone I have borne so long with you ? "
23120	23134	23114	23114	he	1404	" So , you doubt me still ? Are your things packed ? ' "
23142	23143	23114	23114	he	1404	" "
23167	23168	23160	23160	you	0	" "
23171	23175	23160	23160	you	0	" I replied , "

23208	23230	23234	23234	criminals	1410	" He put in my hand an order for a large sum of money . I threw it into the fire . "
23236	23240	23234	23234	criminals	1410	" I exclaimed , "
23282	23283	23284	23284	Bravo	329	" "
23301	23302	23289	23289	You	0	" "
23388	23389	23373	23373	You	0	" "
23401	24170	23395	23395	My	0	" God has much to forgive me , but nothing worse than the dark thought of that speech . In my fury at weakness in such a cause , I had dared sometimes to imagine that my mother knew him to be the murderer , but concealed it for the sake of the family honour ! No need to recount my bitter farewell to all the scenes and objects I had loved so long , to all which possessed a dark yet tender interest , and most of all to my father 's grave . That some attention might still be paid to this , I entrusted it to the care of an old housekeeper of ours , who was living in the village . My last visit was in the moonlight , and dear mother was there . I carried rather than led her away . Slight as my knowledge has been of lightsome and happy love , I am sure that a sombre affection is far the stronger and sweeter . As we began our journey , a crowd of the villagers met us beyond the lodge , and lined the Gloucester road as far as the old oak - tree . While our hired conveyance passed between them , the men stood mute with their hats in their hands , the women sobbed and curtseyed , and blessed us , and held up their children to look at us . Our refuge was the small estate or farm in Devonshire , which I have mentioned as my mother 's property . This , which produced £ 45 a - year , was all that now remained to us , except a sum of £ 1,000 left to me by a godfather , and of which I could not touch the principal . The residue of the personalty , and the balance at the banker 's , we had refused to take , being assured that legally we were responsible to Mr. Vaughan , even for the back rents of the Gloucestershire estate . Of course we had plenty of jewellery , some of it rather valuable , but the part most precious was heirloom , and that we had left behind . Most of our own had been my father 's gift , and therefore we could not bear to sell it . As regarded myself , this comparative poverty was not of very great moment , except as impairing my means of search ; but for my mother 's sake I was cut to the heart , and lost in perplexity . She had so long been accustomed to much attention and many luxuries , which her weak health had made indispensable to her . Thomas Henwood and poor Ann Maples insisted on following our fortunes , at one third of their previous wages . My mother thought it beyond our means to keep them even so ; but for her sake I resolved to try . I need not say that I carried all my relics , difficult as it was to hide them from my mother . When we reached our new home , late in the evening of the second day , a full sense of our privation for the first time broke upon us . It was mid - winter , and in the gloom of a foggy night , and after the weariness of a long journey , our impressions were truly dismal . Jolted endlessly up and down by ruts a foot deep and slaty stones the size of coal - scuttles , entombed alive betwixt grisly hedges which met above us like the wings of night , then obliged to walk up treadmill hills while the rickety fly crawled up behind ; then again plunging and lurching down some corkscrew steep to the perpetual wood and rushing stream at the bottom ; at length and at last along a lane so narrow that it scraped us on both sides as we passed , a lane which zig - zagged every thirty yards with a tree - bole jutting at every corner , at length and at last we came to the farmyard gate . It was not far from the lonely village of Trentisoe , which lies some six miles to the west of Lynmouth . This part is little known to London tourists , though it possesses scenery of a rarer kind than Lynmouth itself can show . Passing through an outer court , with a saw - pit on one side and what they call a "
24172	24184	23373	23373	You	0	" on the other , and where a slop of straw and "
24186	24209	23373	23373	You	0	" quelched under the wheels , we came next to the farmyard proper , and so ( as the flyman expressed it ) "
24214	24216	23373	23373	You	0	" The "
24218	24321	23373	23373	You	0	" was a low straggling cottage , jag - thatched , and heavy - eaved , and reminded me strongly of ragged wet horse - cloths on a rack . The farmer was not come home from Ilfracombe market , but his wife , Mrs. Honor Huxtable , soon appeared in the porch , with a bucket in one hand and a candle stuck in a turnip in the other . In the cross - lights , we saw a stout short woman , brisk and comely , with an amazing cap , and cheeks like the apples which they call in Devonshire "
24325	24326	23373	23373	You	0	" "
24334	24341	23373	23373	You	0	" she called into the house , "
24395	24408	24411	24411	ye	1417	" Having thus provided for our horse , she advanced to us . "
24444	24608	24609	24610	Poor leddy	1420	" So saying , she hurried us into the house , and set us before a wood - fire all glowing upon the ground , beneath an enormous chimney podded with great pots and crocks hung on things like saws . These pots , like Devonshire hospitality , were always boiling and chirping . The kitchen was low , and floored with lime and sand , which was worn into pits such as boys use for marbles ; but the great feature was the ceiling . This was divided by deep rafters into four compartments lengthwise . Across some of these , battens of wood were nailed , forming a series of racks , wherein reposed at least a stye - ful of bacon . Herbs and stores of many kinds , and ropes of onions dangled between . Mrs. Huxtable went to the dresser , and got a large dish , and then turned round to have a good look at us . "
24612	24617	24618	24618	I	0	" she said gently , "
24667	24674	24661	24661	rason	1424	" Then she turned to me . "
24690	24691	24694	24695	Mrs. Huxtable	331	" "
24707	24708	24701	24701	I	0	" "
24742	24771	24722	24722	Us	1422	" Her chattering warmth soon put us at our ease ; and as soon as the parlour fire burnt up , she showed us with many apologies , and "
24775	25261	25286	25286	Varmer	333	" the room which was thenceforth to be ours . After tea , I put my dear mother to bed as soon as possible , and sat by the dying fire to muse upon our prospects . Not the strangeness of the place , the new ideas around me , not even my weariness after railroad , coach , and chaise , could keep my mind from its one subject . In fact , its colour had now become its form . To others indeed , all hope of ever detecting and bringing to justice the man , for whose death I lived , might seem to grow fainter and fainter . Expelled from that place , and banished from those recollections , where , and by which alone , I could well expect ever to wind up my clue , robbed of all means of moving indifferent persons and retaining strong ones ; and , more than this , engrossed ( as I must henceforth be ) in keeping debt at bay , and shielding my mother from care — what prospect was there , nay what possibility , that I a weak unaided girl , led only by set will and fatalism , should ever overtake and grasp a man of craft , and power , and desperation ? It mattered not : let other things be doubtful , unlikely , or impossible ; let the hands of men be clenched against me , and the ears of heaven be stopped ; let the earth be spread with thick darkness , as the waters are spread with earth , and the murderer set Sahara between us , or turn hermit on the Andes ; happen what would , so God were still above us , and the world beneath our feet — I was as sure that I should send that man from the one to the throne of the other , as he was sure to be dragged away thence , to fire , and chains , and gnashing of teeth . So impulsive , kind - hearted , and honest was Mrs. Huxtable , that we could always tell what was the next thing she was going to say or do . Even at her meals she contrived to be in a bustle , except on Sundays ; but she got through a great deal of work . On Sundays she put on , with her best gown , an air of calm dignity which made her unhappy until it was off , which it was directly after the evening service . She seemed a very sensible woman , and whatever the merits of the case she sided always with the weakest . The next morning we asked how it was she appeared not to expect us , as I had written and posted the letter myself on the previous Saturday . "
25266	25270	25286	25286	Varmer	333	" she replied , "
25337	25340	25341	25341	her	1427	But"—and off she ran—"But
25359	25396	25353	25353	you	1430	" So they had only a general idea that we were coming , and knew not when it would be . The following day , Thomas Henwood arrived , bringing our boxes in a vehicle called a "
25399	25459	25460	25460	Death	296	" which is a short and rudely made cart , used chiefly for carrying lime . After unpacking our few embellishments , we set up a clumsy but comfortable sofa for my mother , and tried to divert her sadness a little by many a shift and device to garnish our narrow realm . We removed the horrible print of "
25465	25583	25584	25584	Whai	337	" which was hung above the chimneypiece , and sundry daubs of our Lord and the Apostles , and a woman of Samaria with a French parasol , and Eli falling from a turnpike gate over the Great Western steamer . But these alterations were not made without some wistful glances from poor Mrs. Huxtable . At last , when I began to nail up a simple sketch of the church at Vaughan St. Mary instead of a noble representation of the Prodigal Son , wearing a white hat with a pipe stuck under the riband , and weeping into a handkerchief with some horse upon it , the good dame could no longer repress her feelings . "
25695	26014	26046	26046	Miss	1439	" To argue with such a connoisseur would have been worse than useless ; so I pacified her by hanging the rejected gems in her own little summer room by the dairy . Our parlour began before long to look neat and even comfortable . Of course the furniture was rough , but I care not much for upholstery , and am quite rude of French polish . My only fear was lest the damp from the lime - ash floor should strike to my dear mother 's feet , through the scanty drugget which covered it . The fire - place was bright and quaint , lined with old Dutch tiles , and the grey - washed walls were less offensive to the eye than would have been a paper chosen by good Mrs. Huxtable . The pretty lattice window , budding even now with woodbine , and impudent to the winds with myrtle , would have made amends for the meanest room in England . Before it lay a simple garden with sparry walks and bright - thatched hives , and down a dingle rich with trees and a crystal stream , it caught a glimpse of the Bristol Channel . When our things were nearly settled , and I was sitting by myself , with dirty hands and covered with dust , there came a little timid tap at the door , followed by a shuffling outside , as if some one contemplated flight , yet feared to fly . Opening the door , I was surprised to find the child whom I expected a massive figure , some six feet and a quarter high , and I know not how many feet in width , but wide enough to fill the entire passage . He made a doubtful step in advance , till his great open - hearted face hung sheepishly above my head . "
26024	26028	26021	26022	Mr. Huxtable	338	" I asked . "
26033	26044	26046	26046	Miss	1439	" he stammered , blushing like a beet - root , "
26144	26145	26143	26143	Miss.	342	" "
26166	26170	26143	26143	Miss.	342	" This was an "
26173	26189	26143	26143	Miss.	342	" but audible a long way off , as they always are on the stage . "
26207	26208	26209	26209	I	0	" "
26262	26267	26255	26255	her	1445	" This also was an "
26270	26271	26255	26255	her	1445	" "
26275	26279	26280	26280	I	0	" I said , "
26295	26296	26291	26292	my mother	746	" "
26311	26344	26308	26308	my	0	" he asked with the truest and finest smile I ever saw : and I felt ashamed in front of the strong simplicity which took my conventional words for heart 's truth . "
26351	26354	26308	26308	my	0	" he continued "
26383	26414	26372	26373	a loi	1450	" And thereupon he took my puny weak hand in his rough iron palm , like an almond in the nut - crackers , and examined it with pitying wonder . "
26499	26500	26508	26509	Mr. Huxtable	338	" "
26511	26530	26508	26509	Mr. Huxtable	338	" He took some time to meditate upon this , and shook his head when he had finished . "
26627	26876	26621	26621	ai	1462	" Before I could thank him for his honest championship my mother entered the room , and all his bashfulness ( lost for the moment in the pride of strength ) came over him again like an extinguisher . Although he did not tremble — his nerves were too firm for that — he stood fumbling with his hat , and reddening , and looking vaguely about , at a loss where to put his eyes or anything else . My mother , quite worn out with her morning 's walk , surprised at her uncouth visitor , and frightened perhaps at his bulk , sank on our new - fangled sofa , in a stupor of weakness . Then it was strange and fine to see the strong man 's sense of her feeble state . All his embarrassment vanished at once ; he saw there was something to do ; and a look of deep interest quickened his great blue eyes . Poising his heavy frame with the lightness of a bird , he stepped to her side as if the floor had been holy , and , scarcely touching her , contrived to arrange the rude cushions , and to lay her delicate head in an easy position , as a nurse composes a child . All the while , his looks and manner expressed so much feeling and gentleness , that he must have known what it was to lose a daughter or mother . "
26881	26887	26888	26888	her	1463	" he whispered to me , "
26918	26919	26898	26898	I	0	" "
26946	26964	26931	26931	I	0	" I could n't help crying a little ; and I could n't help his seeing it . "
27111	27134	27108	27108	ye	1464	" With this homely comfort he departed , after a cheering glance at my mother . Before I proceed , the Homeric epithet "
27141	27197	27108	27108	ye	1464	" applied by the poet to Mr. Huxtable , needs some explanation . It appears that the farmer , in some convivial hour ( for at other times he detested vaunting ) , had laid a wager that he and Timothy Badcock , his farm - labourer , would plough half an acre of land , "
27205	27268	27108	27108	ye	1464	" Now , it happened that the Parracombe blacksmith had lately been at Barnstaple , and there had seen a man who had heard of ploughing by steam . So when the farmer 's undertaking got noised abroad and magnified , all Exmoor assembled to witness the exploit , wondering , trembling , and wrathful . Benches and tables were set in the "
27272	27351	27354	27355	the constable	1474	" a nice piece of mealy land , just at the back of the house , while Suke and Mrs. Huxtable plied the cider - barrel for the yeomen of the neighbourhood . The farmer himself was not visible — no plough or ploughing tackle of any description appeared , and a rumour began to spread that the whole affair was a hoax , and the contriver afraid to show himself . But as people began to talk of "
27356	27527	27354	27355	the constable	1474	" ( who , of course was there all the time ) , and as cart - whips and knob - sticks began to vibrate ominously , Mrs. Huxtable made a signal to Mr. Dawe , who led off the grumbling throng to the further end of the field , where an old rick - cloth lay along against the hedge . While the tilting was moved aside , the bold sons of Exmoor shrunk back , expecting some horrible monster , whose smoke was already puffing . All they saw was a one - horse plough with the farmer , in full harness , sitting upon it and smoking his pipe , and Timothy Badcock patiently standing at the plough - tail . Amid a loud hurrah from his friends , Mr. Huxtable leaped to the fore , and cast his pipe over the hedge ; then settled the breast - band across the wrestling - pads on his chest , and drew tight both the chain - traces . "
27536	27736	27354	27355	the constable	1474	" cried stout Tim Badcock cheerily , and off sailed the good ship of husbandly , cleaving a deep bright furrow . But when they reached the corner , the farmer turned too sharply , and snapped the off - side trace . That accident impressed the multitude with a deeper sense of his prowess than even the striking success which attended his primitive method of speeding the plough . To return to my mother . As spring came on , and the beautiful country around us freshened and took green life from the balmy air , I even ventured to hope that the good yeoman 's words would be true . He had become , by this time , a great friend of ours , doing his utmost that we might not feel the loss of our faithful Thomas Henwood . Poor Thomas had been very loth to depart ; but I found , as we got settled , that my mother ceased to want him , and it would have been wrong as well as foolish to keep him any longer . He invested his savings in a public - house at Gloucester , which he called the "
27740	28040	27354	27355	the constable	1474	" and soon afterwards married Jane Hiatt , a daughter of our head game - keeper ; or I ought to say , Mr. Vaughan 's . Ann Maples remained with us still . We lived , as may be supposed , in the most retired manner . My time was chiefly occupied in attendance upon dear mother , and in attempts to create for her some of those countless comforts , whose value we know not until they are lost . After breakfast , my mother would read for an hour her favourite parts of Scripture , and vainly endeavour to lead me into the paths of peace . Her soul discarded more and more the travel garb and wayfaring troubles of this lower existence , as , day by day , it won a nearer view of the golden gate , and the glories beyond ; with which I have seen her eyes suffused , like the lucid heaven with sunrise . It has been said , and I believe , that there is nothing , in all our material world , so lovely as a fair woman looking on high for the angels she knows to be waiting for her . Even I , though looking in an opposite direction , and for an opposite being , could not but admire that gentle meekness , whose absence formed the main fault of my character . Not that I was hard - hearted , or cross , ( unless self - love deceives me ) , but restless yearning and hatred were ever at work within me ; and these repel things of a milder nature , as a bullet cries tush to the zephyr . One cold day in March , when winter had come to say "
28044	28079	28081	28081	myself	0	" with a roar , after wheeling the sofa with my mother upon it towards the parlour fire , I went out to refresh my spirit in the kitchen with Mrs. Huxtable , and to "
28082	28107	27354	27355	the constable	1474	" ( for the sofa took all the parlour fire ) by the fragrant hearth of wood and furze . The farmer 's wife was "
28109	28125	28081	28081	myself	0	" me some strange words of her native dialect , which I was now desirous to "
28128	28135	28081	28081	myself	0	" and which she declared to be "
28211	28227	28207	28207	em	1477	" In the middle of her lecture , and just as I had learned that to "
28229	28236	28172	28173	Miss Clerer	335	" is the proper English for to "
28239	28259	28172	28173	Miss Clerer	335	" and that the passage down which we quilty is , correctly speaking , not the throat , but the "
28262	28270	28172	28173	Miss Clerer	335	" a strange - looking individual darkened the "
28272	28282	28172	28173	Miss Clerer	335	" ( corruptly called the threshold ) and crossed the "
28285	28578	28172	28173	Miss Clerer	335	" or floor , to the fireplace where we sat . Turning round , I beheld a man about fifty years old , of moderate stature , gauntly bodied , and loosely built , and utterly reckless of his attire . His face was long and thin , the profile keenly aquiline ; and the angles made yet sharper , by a continual twitching and tension of the muscles . The skin of his cheeks was drawn , from his solemn brows to his lipless and down - curved mouth , tight and hollow , like the bladder on a jam - pot . His eyes , of a very pale blue , seemed always to stand on tip - toe , and never to know what he was going to say . A long , straight , melancholy chin , grisly with patches of hair , was meant by nature to keep his mouth shut , and came back sullenly when it failed . Over his shoulders was flung a patched potato - sack , fastened in front with a wooden skewer , and his nether clothes were as ragged as poetry . In his air and manner , self - satisfaction strove hard with solemn reserve . Upon the whole he reminded me of an owl who has lost his heart to a bantam hen . I can not express him justly ; but those who have seen may recognise Beany Dawe , the sawyer , acknowledged the bard of the north of Devon . Mr. Ebenezer Dawe , without any hesitation or salute , took a three - legged stool , and set it between our chairs , then looked from Mrs. Huxtable to me , and introduced himself . "

28598	28603	28606	28606	e	1480	" cried Mrs. Huxtable , "

28763	28809	28810	28811	Poor vule	1487	" The subject of these elegant strictures regarded her all the time , with that pleased pity which none but a great Poet so placed can feel . Then swinging slowly on his tripod , and addressing the back of the chimney , he responded : "
28830	28849	28813	28813	Her	1487	" Perhaps his lofty couplet charmed her savage ear ; at any rate she made a peaceful overture . "
28863	28874	28857	28857	e	334	" He assented with an alacrity much below his dignity ; "
28887	28900	28880	28880	maat	1489	" Wull , zin you ax ai , ai'll not answer noo . "
28901	28909	28911	28912	his hostess	1490	" E sha n't have no cider , "

29888	29911	29880	29880	Pluto	359	" Now , Beany Dawe , thee sha n't have none , unless thee can zay zummut without no poetry in it . "
29987	30032	29984	29984	he	350	" If my poor vasses only maks you frown , I 'll try , ees fai I wull , to keep 'em — A rhyme came over him , the twitching of his face showed the violence of the struggle ; he attempted to say "
30035	30045	29984	29984	he	350	" but nature triumphed , and he uttered the fatal "
30048	30640	29984	29984	he	350	" In a moment the farmer compressed his mighty fingers , and crushed the thick metal like silver paper . The forfeit liquor flew over the poet 's knees , and hissed at his feet in the ashes . Foreseeing a storm of verse from him , and of prose from Mrs. Huxtable at the fate of the pride of her dresser , I made a hasty retreat . Thenceforth I took a kind interest in our conceited but harmless bard . His neighbours seemed not to know , how long it was since he had first yielded to his unfortunate ailment ; which probably owed its birth to the sound of the saw . During our first interview , his rhythm and rhyme had been unusually fluent and finished , from pride perhaps at having found a new audience , or from some casual inspiration . Candour compels me to admit that his subsequent works were little , if at all , better than those of his more famous contemporaries ; and I am not so proud , as he expects me to be , of his connexion with my sad history . About half a mile from Tossil 's Barton ( the farmhouse where we lived ) there is a valley , or rather a vast ravine , of a very uncommon formation . A narrow winding rocky combe , where slabs , and tors , and boulder stones , seem pasturing on the velvet grass , or looking into the bright trout - stream , which leaps down a flight of steps without a tree to shade its flash and foam ; this narrow , but glad dingle , as it nears the sea , bursts suddenly back into a desert gorge , cleaving the heights that front the Bristol Channel . The mountain sides from right and left , straight as if struck by rule , steeply converge , like a high - pitched roof turned upside down ; so steep indeed that none can climb them . Along the deep bottom gleams a silver chord , where the cramped stream chafes its way , bedded and banked in stone , without a blade of green . From top to bottom of this huge ravine there is no growth , no rocks , no cliffs , no place to stay the foot , but all a barren , hard , grey stretch of shingle , slates , and gliddery stones : as if the ballast of ten million fleets had been shot in two enormous piles , and were always on the slip . Looking at it we forget that there is such a thing as life : the desolation is not painful , because it is so grand . The brief noon glare of the sun on these Titanic dry walls , where even a lichen dies ; the gaunt desert shade stealing back to its lair in the early afternoon ; the solemn step of evening stooping to her cloak below — I know not which of these is the most impressive and mournful . No stir of any sort , no voice of man or beast , no flow of tide , ever comes to visit here ; the little river , after a course of battles , wins no peaceful union with the sea , but ponds against a shingle bar , and gurgles away in slow whirlpools . Only a fitful moaning wind draws up and down the melancholy chasm . The famous "
30645	31549	29984	29984	he	350	" some four miles to the east , seems to me common - place and tame compared to this grand defile . Yet how many men I know who would smoke their pipes throughout it ! Thinking so much of this place , I long wished my mother to see it ; and finding her rather stronger one lovely April morning , I persuaded her forth , embarked on Mrs. Huxtable 's donkey . We went , down a small tributary glen , towards the head of the great defile . The little glen was bright , and green , and laughing into bud , and bantering a swift brook , which could hardly stop to answer , but left the ousels as it passed to talk at leisure about their nests , and the trout to make those musical leaps that sound so crisp through the alders . Another stream meets it among the bushes below , and now they are entitled to the dignity of a bridge whereon grows the maidenhair fern , and which , with its rude and pointed arch , looks like an old pack - saddle upon the stream . From this point we followed a lane , leading obliquely up the ascent , before the impassable steep begins . Having tethered our quiet donkey to a broken gate , I took my mother along a narrow path through the thicket to the view of the great ravine . Standing at the end of this path , she was astonished at the scene before her . We had gained a height of about two hundred feet , the hill - top stretched a thousand feet above us . We stood on the very limit of vegetation , a straight line passing clown the hill where the quarry - like steep begins . My dear mother was tired , and I had called her to come home , lest the view should make her giddy ; when suddenly she stepped forward to gather a harebell straggling among the stones . The shingle beneath her foot gave way , then below her , and around , and above her head , began in a great mass to glide . Buried to the knees and falling sideways , she was sinking slowly at first , then quickly and quicker yet , with a hoarse roar of moving tons of stone , gathering and whelming upon her , down the rugged abyss . Screaming , I leaped into the avalanche after her , never thinking that I could only do harm . Stronger , and swifter , and louder , and surging , and berged with shouldering stone the solid cascade rushed on . I saw dearest mother below me trying to clasp her hands in prayer , and to give me her last word . With a desperate effort dragging my shawl from the gulfing crash , I threw it towards her , but she did not try to grasp it . A heavy stone leaped over me , and struck her on the head ; her head dropped back , she lay senseless , and nearly buried . We were dashing more headlong and headlong , in the rush of the mountain side , to the precipice over the river , and my senses had all but failed , and revenge was prone before judgment , when I heard through the din a shout . On the brink of firm ground stood a man , and signed me to throw my shawl . With all my remaining strength I did so , but not as he meant , for I cast it entirely to him , and pointed to my mother below . One instant the avalanche paused , he leaped about twenty feet down , through the heather and gorse , and stayed his descent by clutching a stout ash sapling . To this in a moment he fastened my shawl , ( a long and strong plaid ) , and just as my mother was being swept by , he plunged with the other end into the shingle tide . I saw him leap and struggle towards her , and lift her out of the gliding tomb , gliding himself the while , and sway himself and his burden , by means of the shawl , not back ( for that was impossible ) , but obliquely downwards ; I saw the strong sapling bow to the strain like a fishing - rod , while hope and terror fought hard within me ; I saw him , by a desperate effort , which bent the ash - tree to the ground , leap from the whirling havoc , and lay my mother on the dead fern and heath . Of the rest , I know nothing , having become quite unconscious , before he saved me , in the same manner . We must have been taken home in Farmer Huxtable 's butt , for I remember well that , amidst the stir and fright of our return , and while my mother was still insensible , Mrs. Huxtable fell savagely upon poor Suke , for having despatched that elegant vehicle without cleaning it from the lime dust ; whereby , as she declared , our dresses ( so rent and tattered by the jagged stones ) were "
31555	31603	29984	29984	he	350	" Poor Suke would have been likely to fare much worse , if , at such a time , she had stopped to dust the cart . When the farmer came home , his countenance , rich in capacity for expressing astonishment , far outdid his words . "
31617	31712	31612	31612	ye	1502	" was all the vent he could find for his ideas during the rest of the day ; though it was plain to all who knew him that he was thinking profoundly upon the subject , and wholly occupied with it . In the course of the following week he advised me very impressively never to do it again ; and nothing could ever persuade him but that I jumped in , and my mother came to rescue me . But his wife very soon had all her wits about her . She sent to "
31714	31764	29984	29984	he	350	" for the doctor ( I begged that it might not be Mr. Dawe 's physician ) , she put dear mother to bed , and dressed her wounds with simples worth ten druggists ' shops , and bathed her temples with rosemary , and ran down the glen for "
31767	31775	29984	29984	he	350	" ( Valerian ) , which she declared "
31783	32115	29984	29984	he	350	" then she hushed the entire household , permitting no tongue to move except her own , and beat her eldest boy ( a fine young Huxtable ) for crying , whereupon he roared ; she even conquered her strong desire to know much more than all could tell ; and showed my mother such true kindness and pity that I loved her for it at once , and ever since . Breathing slowly and heavily , my poor mother lay in the bed which had long been the pride of Tossil 's Barton . The bedstead was made of carved oak , as many of them are in North Devon , and would have been handsome and striking , if some ancestral Huxtable had not adorned it with whitewash . But the quilt was what they were proud of . It was formed of patches of diamond shape and most incongruous colours , with a death 's head in the centre and crossbones underneath . When first I beheld it , I tossed it down the stairs , but my mother would have it brought back and used , because she knew how the family gloried in it , and she could not bear to hurt their feelings . One taper white hand lay on it now , with the tender skin bruised and discoloured by blows . She had closed the finger which bore her wedding ring , and it still remained curved and rigid . In an agony of tears , I knelt by the side of the bed , watching her placid and deathlike face . Till then I had never known how strongly and deeply I loved her . I firmly believe that she was revived in some degree by the glare of the patched quilt upon her eyes . The antagonism of nature was roused , and brought home her wandering powers . Feebly glancing away , she came suddenly to herself , and exclaimed : "
32125	32140	32141	32141	She	1503	" Yes , mother ; here I am , with my own dear mother . "
32503	32508	32543	32543	she	1503	" Red - deer Inn "
32612	32615	32608	32608	himself	1518	" Smiler , "

33685	33742	33672	33672	she	5530	" my only and darling child , who has minded me so long , and laid her youth , and beauty , and high courageous spirit , at the feet of her weak mother ; my child , who fostered in wealth and love , will be to - morrow an orphan , cast upon the wide world"—here
33827	33910	33817	33817	she	5530	" I am sure that my pet will listen , with kindness and patience , while I try to say what has lain so long at my heart . You know how painfully I have always been moved by any allusion to the death of your dear father . It has been a weakness no doubt on my part , but one which I vainly strove against ; and for which I trust to be pardoned where all is pardon and peace . "
33949	34069	33934	33934	she	5530	" This is a bitter subject , and I never could bring myself to it , till now , when it seems too late . But , my poor love , I am so anxious about it . For the rest — that Providence which has never forsaken us , repine as I would , I can trust that Providence still to protect my darling child . There is one thing , and only one , by promising which you will make my departure quite happy . Then I shall go to rejoin your father , and carry such tidings of you , as will enable us both to wait , in the fulness of time , your coming . "
34070	34081	34082	34082	I	0	" Oh , that the fulness of time were come ! "
34089	34097	34082	34082	I	0	" for me it is empty enough . "
34098	34117	33934	33934	she	5530	" My precious , my own darling Clara , you sob so , you make me most wretched . "
34118	34128	34134	34134	she	1560	" Mother , I will not cry any more ; "
34139	34146	34147	34147	she	1560	" I need not tell you , "
34150	34164	34147	34147	she	1560	" what is that promise which I crave for your own dear sake . "
34165	34170	34171	34171	I	0	" No , ma'am , "
34174	34183	34171	34171	I	0	" I know quite well what it is . "

34205	34230	34231	34231	She	1560	" My mother dear , you wish me to promise this — that I will forego my revenge upon him who slew my father . "
34266	34369	34257	34257	she	1560	" Had you asked me anything else , although it were sin against God and man ( if you could ask such a thing)—I would have pledged myself to it , as gladly as I would die — die , at least , if my task were done . But this , this one thing only — to abandon what I live for , what I was born to do , to be a traitor to my own father and you — I implore you , mother , by Him whose glory is on you now , do not ask me this . "
34386	34404	34257	34257	she	1560	" Then I must die , and leave my only child possessed with a murderer 's spirit ! "
34459	34462	34463	34463	I	0	" Mother , "
34466	34549	34463	34463	I	0	" I will promise you this . When I have discovered , as I must do , that man who has made you a widow and me an orphan , if I find any plea whatever to lessen his crime , or penitence to atone for it , as I hope to see my father and mother in heaven , I will try to spare and forgive him . Can you wish me to rest in ignorance , and forget that deed ? "
34550	34553	34554	34554	she	1564	" Clara , "
34568	34632	34559	34559	she	1564	" you have promised me all I can hope for . How you loved your father ! Me too you have loved I can not say how much . For my sake , you have borne poverty , trouble , and illness , without a complaining word . By day , and by night , through my countless wants , and long fretfulness . "
34674	34722	34665	34665	she	1564	" May the God of the fatherless and the poor , who knows and comforts the widow 's grief , the God who is taking me now to His bosom , bless with all blessings of earth and heaven , and restore to me this my child . "
34910	34952	34907	34907	her	746	" Raise me upon the pillow , my love , that I may hear him once more . He sings like one your father and I used to listen to every evening , in the days when we watched your cradle . "
34969	35003	35004	35004	She	746	" Now kiss me , my child ; once more , my own loved child , my heart is with you for ever . Light of my eyes , you are growing dim . "
35049	35078	35026	35026	she	746	" Thou art my guide , and my staff . I have no fear , neither shadow of trembling . Make no long tarrying , oh my God ! "

35491	35501	35503	35504	the farmer	5517	" To see her sit and look at it ! "

35523	35565	35520	35521	the other	1586	" Poor child , she must have cried herself out . I have known her sit by the hour , and stare at the bed where her father was killed , but it was a different sort of look to this . "
35566	35577	35579	35580	Dame Huxtable	365	" Ah well , she has lost a good mother , "
35582	35596	35579	35580	Dame Huxtable	365	" God grant my poor little chicks may never be left like her . "
35597	35610	35612	35613	my nurse	1587	" What 's your children to talk of along with Miss Clara ? "
35631	35643	35625	35625	herself	331	" All children is much of a muchness to their mothers . "
35644	35650	35652	35653	Ann Maples	294	" Do n't tell me , "
35673	35701	35661	35662	The farmer	5517	" For good , now , do n't ye fall out at such a time as this here . What 's our affairs to speak of now ? "

35722	35739	35741	35741	her	294	" And goes forth in the morning , and is cast into the oven , ma'am , "

35757	35855	35753	35754	the farmer	5517	" I 'll take my gospel oath of it . It 's not much good I am at parsoning , and maybe I likes a drop of drink when the weather is fitty ; but that young chestnut filly that 's just come home from breaking , I 'd sell her to a gipsey , and trust him for the money , if so be ' twould make the young lady turn her face to the Lord . Ca n't ye speak to her now about it , either of you women ? Doo'e now , doo'e . "

35867	35893	35863	35864	his wife	789	" why , farmer , you must be mazed . A high young lady like that , and the tears still hot in her eyes ! "
35894	35917	35753	35754	the farmer	5517	" The very reason , wife , the very time and reason . But likely Mrs. Maples would be the proper person . "

35968	36046	35962	35963	the farmer	5517	" I humbly ask your pardon ; I was n't taught no better . I can only go by what I have seen , and what seems to come inside of me . And I know , in our way of business , when a calf is weaned from the mother , the poor beastess hath a call for some one else to feed it . Maybe it 's no harm to let her have the refusal . "
36065	36084	36048	36048	he	5517	" Waife , do'e mind the time as poor Aunt Betsy died , over there to Rowley Mires ? "
36085	36156	36158	36158	she	746	" For sure I do , but what have her got to do with it ? Us must n't talk of her , I reckon , any more than of the chillers , though us be so unlucky as to be born in Devonshire . Fie , fie , thee ought to know better than to talk of poor Aunt Betsy along of a lady , and before our betters . "

36318	36337	36313	36314	Mrs. Huxtable	331	" Give me a reason for leaving it , and I 'll give you ten for taking it . "
36338	36354	36313	36314	Mrs. Huxtable	331	" I ca n't give no reasons . But maybe it comforts her a little . "
36355	36359	36361	36362	his wife	789	" Comfort indeed ! "

37038	37160	37161	37161	He	1607	" Meaning , Miss ! Lord bless you , Miss Clara , there bain't no meaning of it ; only it corned into my head last night , as I was laying awake , humbly asking your pardon , Miss , for that same , that if so be you should desire , that the dear good lady herself might like , if I may make so bold , meaning that it is n't fitly like , that she should lay nowhere else , but alongside of her own husband , till death do them part , Mr. Henry Valentine Vaughan , Esquire , Vaughan Park , in the county of Gloucestershire .

43817	43835	43815	43815	Miss	5433	" said Tim , addressing me , for he had told his Mistress all the story twice , "
44009	44010	44011	44011	Tim	344	" "
44013	44018	44019	44019	I'se	1749	" said Mrs. Huxtable , "

44087	44104	44079	44079	thee	344	" said Tim , favouring me with a wink , in the excess of his glory , "
44125	44154	44106	44106	they	1752	" Two or three days after this , I was keeping school in the dairy , the parlour being too small for that purpose , and the kitchen and "
44158	44300	44106	44106	they	1752	" ( as they called the back - kitchen ) too open to inroads from Suke and Tim . My class consisted of ten , or rather was eight strong , the two weames ( big baby and little baby ) , only attending for the sake of example , and because they would have roared , if parted from the other children . So those two were allowed to spraddle on the floor , where sometimes they made little rollers of themselves , with much indecorum , and between whiles sat gravely sucking their fat red fingers , and then pointed them in a glistening state at me or my audience , and giggled with a large contempt . The eight , who made believe to learn something , were the six elder Huxtables , and two of Tim Badcock 's "
44304	44376	44106	44106	they	1752	" I marshalled them , four on each side , against the low lime - whitened walls , which bore the pans of cream and milk . Little Sally , my head scholar , was very proud of measuring her height , by the horizontal line on the milk - pan where the glazing ended ; which Tabitha Badcock , even on tiptoe , could not reach . They were all well "
44379	44591	44106	44106	they	1752	" and had white pinnies on , and their ruddy cheeks rubbed up to the highest possible polish , with yellow soap and the jack - towel behind the wash - up door . Hence , I never could relieve them from the idea that Sunday now came every day in the week . I maintained strict discipline , and allowed no nonsense ; but two sad drawbacks constantly perplexed me . In the first place , their ways were so ridiculous , and they laboured so much harder to make me laugh , than they did to learn , that I could not always keep my countenance , and when the spelling - book went up before my face , they knew , as well as possible , what was going on behind it , and peeped round or below , and burst out all together . The second drawback was , that Mrs. Huxtable , in spite of all my protests , would be always rushing in , upon errands purely fictitious ; and the farmer himself always found some special business in the yard , close to the wired and unglazed window , whence every now and then his loud haw - haws , and too audible soliloquies , "

46219	46530	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" All in the olden time , there lived A little Pixie king , So lovely and so light of foot That when he danced the ring , The moonlight always shifted , to gaze upon his face , And the cowslip - bells uplifted , rang time with every pace . There came a dozen maidens , Almost as tall as bluebells ; The cowslips hushed their cadence , And bowed before the true belles : The maidens shyly glancing , betwixt the cummer darts , Espied the monarch dancing , and lost a dozen hearts . He was fitted up so neatly , With dewdrops for his crown , And he footed it so featly He never shook them down . The maids began advancing , along a lily stem , Not to stop the monarch 's dancing , but to make him look at them . The king could not afford them The proper time to gaze , But sweetly bowed toward them , At the turn of every maze : Till full of pretty faces , and his sandals getting worn , He was puzzled in his paces , and fell upon a thorn . The maidens broke the magic ring , And leaped the cummer dart ; ' Alas , our little Pixie king , The thorn is in his heart ! ' They laid him in a molehill , and piteously they cried : Yet this was not the whole ill , for all the maidens died . Each took a spindled acorn , found Below a squirrel 's nest , And set the butt against the ground , The barb beneath her breast : So truly she addressed the stroke unto her loving part , That when the acorn grew an oak , it held her little heart . ' By no means a "
46534	46633	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" it seemed to me , for a fairy to have owned , but as large as it was loving . I assured Mr. Dawe that he was quite untaught in fairy lore , or he never would have confounded fairies with pixies , a different class of society . But he treated my learning with utter contempt , and reasonably enough declared that he who spent all his time in the woods must know more than any books could tell . He also informed me , that the proper name for the lignified fairy heart , was a "
46636	46675	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" but he did not choose to tell me what had become of the other , which was not so large or handsome as this , yet it had saved him a month 's sawing , and earned him "
46680	46742	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" which meant , I fear , that the proceeds had been spent in a very long cruise . After refusing all compensation , Mr. Dawe made his farewell in several couplets of uncouth but hearty blessing , begging me only to shake hands with him once , and venturing as a poet to prophesy that we should meet again . The "
46744	47641	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" was probably nothing more than a rare accretion , or ganglion , in the centre of an aged oak . However , it was very pretty ; and of course I observed the condition upon which I had received it , valuing it moreover as a token of true friends . But how can I think of such trifles , while sitting for the last time in the room where my mother died ? To - morrow all the form and colour of my life shall change ; even now I feel once more my step on the dark track of justice , which is to me revenge . How long have I been sauntering on the dreary moor of listlessness and hollow weariness , which spreads , for so many dead leagues , below the precipice of grief ? How long have I been sauntering , not caring to ask where , and conscious of existence only through the nerves and fibres of the memory . The things I have been doing , the duties I have discharged , the vague unlinked ideas , startling me by their buffoonery to grief — might not these have all passed through me , every whit as well , if I had been set against a wall , and wound up for three months , and fitted with the mind expressed in the chuckle of a clock ? Nay , worse than all — have I not allowed soft thoughts to steal throughout my heart , the love of children , the warmth of kindness , the pleasure of doing good in however small a way ? Much more of this , and I shall learn forgiveness of my wrong ! But now I see a clearer road before me . Returning health renews my gall . Death recedes , and lifts his train from the swords that fell before him . Once more my pulse beats high with hatred , with scorn of meanness , treachery , and lies , with admiration of truth and manhood , not after the fashion of fools . But dare I mount the Judge 's throne ? Shall the stir of one frail heart , however fresh from its Maker 's hand , be taken for His voice pronouncing right and wrong ? These thoughts give me pause , and I dwell again with my mother . But in all the strength of youth and stern will , I tread them down ; and am once more that Clara Vaughan whose life shall right her father 's death . At last we got through our parting with the best of people ( far worthier than myself to interest any reader ) , and after it the dark ride over the moors , and the farmer 's vain attempt at talking to relieve both himself and us . The honest eyes were bright with tears , tears of pity for my weakness , which now he scarcely cared to hide , but would not show by wiping away ; and how many times he begged for frequent tidings of us , which Sally could now interpret , if written in large round hand . How many times he consulted , commanded , and threatened the coachman , and promised him a goose at Michaelmas , if he took good care of us and our luggage ! These great kindnesses , and all the trifling cares which strew the gap of long farewells , were more to think of than to tell . But I ought to mention , that much against the farmer 's will , I insisted on paying him half the sum , which he had lent me in a manner never to be forgotten . Moreover , with the same presentiment which he had always felt , he made me promise once more to send for him , if I fell into any dreadful strait . It was late at night when our cabman , the most polite , and ( if his word may be trusted ) the most honourable of mankind , rang the bell of Mrs. Shelfer 's house . The house was in a by - street near a large unfinished square , in the northern part of London . Mrs. Shelfer came out at once , sharp and quick and short , and wonderfully queer . At first she took no notice at all of either of as , but began pulling with all her strength at the straps of the heaviest boxes , which , by means known to herself alone , she contrived to drag through the narrow passage , and down three low steps into the little kitchen . Then she hurried back , talking all the time to herself , re - opened the door of the fly , jumped in , and felt under both the seats , and round the lining . Finding nothing there , she climbed upon the driver 's box , and thoroughly examined both that and the roof . Being satisfied now that none of our chattels were left in the vehicle , she shook her little fist at two or three boys , who stood at the corner near the mews , and setting both hands to the farmer 's great hamper or "
47643	47666	47688	47689	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" ( as he called it ) , she dragged it inside the front door , and turned point blanc upon me . "

47969	47976	47966	47967	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" I asked in great surprise . "
48032	48038	47993	47993	he	1810	" with a short sigh , "
48051	48157	48160	48161	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Talking at this rate , and stopping for no reply , she led us into her kitchen , saying that she would not light a fire upstairs , it was so bootiful , the trimmings of the grate , because she was n't certain that we would come , but she had got supper for us , excuse me , my good friend , in her own snug little room , and bootiful they was sure enough , the wind last week had made them so fat . She pointed in triumph to a large dish on the table piled up with blue shells . "
48167	48174	48160	48161	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" I exclaimed with some disgust . "
48323	48944	48320	48321	Miss Vaughan	293	" She drew herself up , at the end of the sentence , with an air of the greatest dignity ; then suddenly dropped it again , and began bustling in and out . Now for the first time , I had leisure to examine her , for while she spoke , the short jumps of her ideas unsettled my observation . She was a little body , rather thin , with a face not strongly peculiar , but odd enough to second the oddities of her mind . No doubt she had once been pretty , and her expression was pleasant now , especially when a glimpse was afforded of her quick grey eyes , which generally avoided the gaze , and dropped beneath a fringe of close - set lashes . But the loss of the front teeth , and the sharpening and wrinkling of the face , with the straggling neglect of the thick black hair fraying out from the black cap , and the habit she had of shutting her mouth with a snap , all these interfered with her credit for pristine good looks . Like Mrs. Huxtable , she was generally in a bustle , but a bustle of words more often than of deeds . She had no deception about her , yet she never knew the difference between the truth and a lie , and could not understand that any one else should do so . Therefore she suspected everything and everybody , till one of her veins of opinion was touched , and then she would swallow anything . Tired out with the long day 's travel , the dazing of railway speed , and the many scenes and faces which had flashed across me , I could not appreciate the beauty of Mrs. Shelfer 's furniture ; but leaving Ann Maples to eat the muscles , if she could , and to gossip with her cousin , I was not slow to revisit the old farmhouse , and even the home of my childhood , in the winged cradle of sleep . Ann Maples had done her best to persuade me to call on my godmother , Lady Cranberry , but I was quite resolved to do nothing of the sort . In the first place , Lady Cranberry was a person of great wealth , living in a very large house , and keeping up such state as gay widows love , who have forgotten old affections and are looking out for new . In me , therefore , to whose fixed estimate fidelity seemed the very pith of honour , there could be no love towards such a changeling . And even if I had liked her , my circumstances would not admit of our visiting upon equal terms , and it was not likely that I would endure to be patronized by any one . In the second place , the same most amiable lady had written letters of beautiful condolence , and taken a tender interest in our change of fortune , so long as there was any novelty in it ; but soon flagged off , and had not even replied to my announcement of dearest mother 's death . Finally , I hated her without any compromise , from what I had seen of her , and what she had done to me at Vaughan Park . So my good Ann set off all alone , for she hoped to obtain some recommendation there , and I was left to receive Mrs. Shelfer 's morning visit . Her queer episodical conversation , and strange biographies of every table , chair , and cushion — her "
48947	49022	48320	48321	Miss Vaughan	293	" as she delighted to call them — I shall not try to repeat , for my history is not a comic one ; neither will she appear , unless the connexion requires it . One vein of sympathy between us was opened at once , by her coming into the room with a lame blackbird on her finger ; and I was quite surprised at the number of her pets . As for the "
49026	49118	48320	48321	Miss Vaughan	293	" they were two little rooms on the first floor , adjoining one another , and forming , together with the landing outside and a coal - closet , the entirety of that storey . The rooms above were occupied by a young dress - maker . Mr. and Mrs. Shelfer , who had no children kept the ground - floor ( consisting of a parlour and kitchen ) and the two attics , one of which was always full of onions and carrot seed . Upon the whole , though the "
49120	49287	49290	49290	you	1820	" were very old , and not over clean , until I scoured them , and the drawing - room ( as my landlady loved to call it ) was low and small , and looked through the rails of a narrow balcony upon a cheese - monger 's shop across the road ( instead of a wooded dingle ) , I was very well satisfied with them ; and above all the rent was within my means . In the afternoon , when things were growing tidy , a carriage drove up rapidly , and a violent ringing of the bell ensued . It was Lady Cranberry , who , under the pretext of bringing Ann Maples home , was come to gratify her own sweet curiosity . She ran upstairs in her most charming manner , caught me by both hands , and would have kissed me desperately , if I had shown any tendency that way . Then she stopped to admire me . "
49315	49336	49337	49337	I	0	" Of course I was pleased with her admiration ; but only for a moment , because I disliked her . "
49345	49351	49340	49340	you	0	" I replied quite coldly ; "

49654	49731	49649	49649	you	1820	" She held out her hand , as she had seen the fast men do , whose society she affected . I noticed it not , but led her on ; my fury had long been gathering . I almost choked when she spoke in that way of my father , utterly as I despised her . But I made it a trial of self - control , which might be demanded against more worthy objects . "

49802	49862	49799	49800	my Clara	5392	" Her cup was full . She had used dearest mother 's fond appellative , and , as I thought , in mockery . I did not lower myself by any sarcastic language . She would not have understood it . I merely opened the door , and said calmly to my landlady , who was there , of course "
49865	49866	49799	49800	my Clara	5392	" "
49877	49990	49867	49868	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Poor godmother , she was so frightened that I was sorry for her . They helped her into the carriage , and she had just strength to draw down the blinds . Mrs. Shelfer had been in raptures at having so grand a vehicle and two great footmen at her door . Lest the street should lose the effect , she had run in and out a dozen times , and banged the door , and got into talk with the coachman , and sent for beer to the Inn , though she had it in the house . She now came again to my door , in what she called a "
49994	50066	49867	49868	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" I could not attend to her , but locked myself in , and wrestled with my passionate nature , at one time indulging , then spurning and freezing it . Yet I could not master it , as I fancied I had done . Soon afterwards , Ann Maples went to the place which she had obtained in Lady Cranberry 's household ; and I determined to begin my search . "
50076	50170	49867	49868	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" My landlady was feeding her birds , and I had made up for her disappointment about Lady Cranberry , by fitting the lame blackbird with a wooden leg , cut from a skewer , and tipped with a button : it was pretty to see how kindly and cleverly he took to it , and how proudly he contemplated it , when he thought there was no one watching . His mistress now stopped her work , and made ready for a long speech , with the usual snap of her lips . "

It was the first time I walked all alone in London , and though we lived quite in the suburbs it seemed very odd to me . For a while I felt rather nervous , but no one molested me then or at any other time ; although I have heard some plain young ladies declare that they could not walk in London without attracting unpleasant attention . Perhaps because they knew not the way either to walk or to dress . Without any trouble , I found No . 19 , Grove Street , then rang the bell and looked round me . It was a clean unpretentious street , not to be known by its architecture from a thousand others in London . The bell was answered by a neat little girl , and I asked for the Master of the house . Clever tactics truly for commencing a task like mine . Being told that the Master was from home , I begged to see the Mistress . The little maid hesitated awhile , with the chain of the door in her hand , and then invited me into the parlour , a small room , but neat and pretty . "

52554	53202	53205	53206	good dog	1918	" As this clue , which seemed so promising , led to nothing at all , I may as well wind it up at once , and not tangle my story with it . Mr. Elton permitted his wife to tell me all she knew about the Polish exiles , for they were gone to America , and nothing done here could harm them . But at the same time he made me promise not to mention to the police , if my case should ever come before them , the particulars which he gave me ; and I am sure he would not wish me to make free with the gentleman 's name . A gentleman he was , as both my kind friends assured me , and not likely to conceal any atrocious secret , unless he had learned it in a way which laid it upon his honour . Mr. Elton had never been intimate with him , and knew not who his friends were , but Mrs. Elton had liked the lady who was very kind and passionate . Also she was very apt to make mistakes in English names , and to become confused at moments of excitement . Therefore Mrs. Elton thought that she had confounded the Eltons ' address with that of some other person ; for it seemed a most unlikely thing that she should know the residents at two Nos . 19 Grove Street . However so it proved — but of that in its place . It was now six months since they had quitted London , perhaps on account of the climate , for the gentleman had been ill some time , and quite confined to the house . It would be altogether vain to think of tracing them in America . While living in London they owned a most magnificent dog , a truly noble fellow but afflicted with a tumour . This dog suddenly disappeared , and they would not tell what had become of him , but the lady cried most violently one day when he was spoken of . Directly after this they left the country , with a very brief farewell . All this I learned from Mr. and Mrs. Elton during my second visit , for Mrs. Elton was too good a wife to dispense with her husband 's judgment . Also I saw their daughter , a pleasing delicate girl ; they learned of course some parts of my story , and were most kind and affectionate to me ; and I am proud to have preserved their friendship to the present time . But as they take no prominent share in the drama of my life , henceforth they will not be presented upon its stage . As I returned up the Villa Road , thinking of all I had heard , and feeling down at heart , something cold was gently placed in my ungloved hand . Turning in surprise and fright I saw an enormous dog , wagging his tail , and looking at me with magnificent brown eyes . Those great brown eyes were begging clearly for the honour of my acquaintance , and that huge muzzle was deposited as a gage of love . As I stooped to ascertain his sentiments , he gravely raised one mighty paw and offered it to me delicately , with a little sigh of self - approval . Upon my accepting it frankly and begging to congratulate him upon his noble appearance and evident moral excellence , he put out his tongue , a brilliant red one , and gave me a serious kiss . Then he shrugged his shoulders and looked with patient contempt at a nicely - dressed young lady , who was exerting her lungs at a silver whistle some fifty yards down the road . "
53208	53215	53205	53206	good dog	1918	" I said with a smile , "
53230	53231	53224	53225	your Mistress	1920	" "
53236	53243	53233	53233	her	1920	" he said with his eyes , "
53277	53316	53268	53268	you	1921	" And with that he resumed a long bone , laid aside while he chatted to me , tucked it lengthwise in his mouth , like a tobacco - pipe , and after shaking hands again , and saying "
53323	53494	53268	53268	you	1921	" the great dog trotted away sedately , flourishing his tail on high , like a plume of Pampas grass . At the corner of the railings he overtook his young Mistress , whose features I could not descry ; though from her air and walk I knew that she must be a pretty girl . A good - tempered one too she seemed to be , for she only shook her little whip lightly at the dog , who made an excursion across the road and sniffed at a heap of dust . Although Ann Maples was not so very talkative , it would be romantic to suppose that Mrs. Shelfer had failed to learn my entire history , so far at least as her cousin knew it . Having now disposed of one Grove Street , I was about to try the same rude tactics with another , viz . that in Hackney ; when my landlady gave a little nervous knock , and hurried into the room . "

54370	54651	54360	54360	I	0	" She brought up my dinner and tea , without a single word , but with many sly glances at me from her quick grey eyes . Once or twice she was at the point of speaking , and the dry smile she always spoke with fluttered upon her face ; but she closed her lips firmly and even bit them to keep herself in . I could scarcely help laughing , for I liked the odd little thing ; but she was so free with her tongue , that the lesson was sadly wanted . Late in the evening , she came to say that Inspector Cutting was there , and would come up if I wished it . Upon my request he came , and one look was enough to show that his niece had not misdescribed him . An elderly man , but active looking and wiry , with nothing remarkable in his features , except the clear cast of his forehead and the firm set of his mouth . But the quick intelligence that shot from his eyes made it seem waste of time to finish telling him anything . For this reason , polite though he was , it became unpleasant to talk to him . It was something like shooting at divers — as my father used to describe it — for whom the flash of the gun is enough . Yet he never once stopped or hurried me , until my tale was done , and all my thoughts laid bare . Then he asked to see all my relics and vestiges of the deed ; even my gordit did not escape him . "

54963	54981	54660	54660	you	1949	" Yes . At least I suppose so , or he would not have been in London . "
54982	54991	54788	54788	I	0	" Did he visit then at Vaughan Park ? "

55063	55101	54788	54788	I	0	" No . If I had been — well , I will not say . But I was not then in my present position . Had I been so , it would have become my special department . "

You have shown great intelligence when a mere child ; exert but a little now , and you will see the good sense , or rather the necessity , of my recommendation . When you have gained your object , you may resume your name with pride . You have given your information , Miss Vaughan , as clearly as ever I knew a female give it . "

56184	56194	56136	56136	They	1955	" Certainly , when my hand is well enough . "
56195	56278	56279	56279	I	0	" Believe me , I am deeply concerned at what has occurred . But the fault was all your own . How dare you obstruct the Police ? But I wish some of my fellows had only half your spirit . A little more experience , and nothing will escape you . Come , Miss Vaughan , though you are a lady , or rather because you are one , give me your left hand , in token that you forgive me . "
56330	56375	56319	56319	He	1956	" I will come and inquire how you are to - morrow , Miss Vaughan . Patty , quiet , and coolness , and change the lard frequently . No doctor , if you please ; and above all hold your queer little tongue . "

A year of study required . Shade too broad and massive . A want of tone in the background . Great feeling of nature , but inexperienced rendering . More mellowness desiderated . Full however of promise . All the faults on the right side . Most energetic handling ; no weak stippling here .

58780	58862	58638	58638	I	0	" It is simply this:—The worst part of your work is the perspective . And figure - drawing will be of service to you . Study at a school of design , if you have one near you ; and be not above drawing stiff and unsightly objects . Houses are the true guides to perspective . I can not paint or even draw ; but I am so much with great artists , that I know well how to advise . "
58863	58874	58690	58690	I	0	" Thank you . Can you kindly suggest anything more ? "
58875	58932	58638	58638	I	0	" Yes . Your touch is here and there too harsh . Keep your hand light though bold , and your brush just a leetle wetter . But you have the grand things quite unattainable , when not in the grain . I mean , of course , freedom of handling and an artist 's eye . "
58933	58945	58638	58638	I	0	" Do you think I could do any good in oils ? "

Christian friends , may you never know what it is to be famished as I and my seven darlings are this very night , in the midst of plenty . From Plymouth in Devonshire , I walked two hundred and fifty miles afoot all the way to join my beloved husband in London . When I came to this Christian city — Georgiana , pick up that halfpenny — he had been ordered off in the transport ship Hippopotamus , to shed his blood for his Queen and country ; and I who have known the smiles of plenty in my happy rustic home , I am compelled for the sake of my children to the degradation of publicly soliciting alms . The smallest trifle , even an old pair of shoes or a left off garment will be received with the heartfelt gratitude of the widow and orphan . My eldest child , ma'am , the oldest of seven , bad in the whooping cough . Georgiana , curtsey to the pretty lady , and show her your broken chilblains . "

Only I have n't got it with me . I never carry money . Do you know why , dear ? "

Why , I can never keep it , somehow or other . But papa says if I can show five pounds on Christmas - day , he will put five more on the top of it , and then do you know what I 'll do ? I 'll give away five , and spend the rest for Pappy and Conrad . "

You are better now , you know . Come , that 's a love . I am sure I shall love you with all my heart , and you are so terribly unlucky . "

63339	63830	63323	63323	he	2146	" The poor little woman was crying with pity and rage . Old Tom looked up all the time as if he knew all she said , and then jumped on her lap , and showed his paws , and purred . Meanwhile , a change had come over my intentions . Perhaps all the rudeness I had met with that day had called my pride into arms . At any rate , much as I liked pretty Isola , and much as I longed for her fresh warm kindness , I now resolved to wait until she should choose to seek me . So I did not even ask Mrs. Shelfer whether she knew the College where the Professor lectured . What were love and warm young hearts to me ? I deserved such a rebuff for swerving so from my duty . Now I would give all my thoughts to the art , whence only could spring any hope of attaining my end , and the very next day I would follow the picture - dealer 's advice . There was a school of design not very far from my lodgings , and thither I went the next morning . My landlady offered to come with me and see me safe in the room ; and of course her Charley , who seemed to know everybody , knew some one even there , to whom she kindly promised to recommend me . So I gladly accepted her offer . In some respects , Mr. Shelfer was more remarkable than even his wife . He was so shy , that on the rare occasions when we met , I never could get him to look at me , except once when he was drunk ; yet by some mysterious process he seemed to know everything about me — the colour of my eyes , the arrangement of my hair , the dresses I put on , the spirits I was in — a great deal more , in fact , than I ever cared to know . So that sometimes my self - knowledge was largely increased , through his observations repeated by his wife . But I was not allowed to flatter myself that this resulted from any especial interest ; for he seemed to possess an equal acquaintance with the affairs of all his neighbours . Mention any one anywhere around , and he , without seeming to mean it , would describe him or her unmistakably in half a dozen words . He never praised or blamed , he simply identified . He must have seen more with a blink of his eye , than most people see in five minutes of gazing . He seldom brought any one home with him , though he often promised to do so ; he never seemed to indulge in gossip , at any rate not with his wife . "
63839	63936	63323	63323	he	2146	" was all the encouragement he ever gave her in that way . When he was at home — a thing of rare occurrence — he sat with his head down and a long pipe in his mouth ; he walked in the street with his head down , and never accosted any one . Where did he get all his knowledge ? I doubt if there were a public - house in London , but what Shelfer knew at the furthest a cousin of the landlord , and a brother of one of the potboys . "
63939	64059	63323	63323	he	2146	" everybody called him , and everybody spoke of him , not with distinguished respect , but with a kindly feeling . His luck was proverbial ; he had a room full of things which he had won at raffles , and he was in constant requisition to throw for less fortunate people . As for his occupation — he called himself a nurseryman , but he had no nursery that I could discover . He received a pound a week for looking after the garden in the great square ; but when any one came for him , he was never to be found there . I think he spent most of his time in jobbing about , and "
64061	64481	63323	63323	he	2146	" ( as Mrs. Shelfer called it ) among his brother gardeners . Sometimes , he brought home beautiful plants , perfectly lovely flowers , unknown to me even by name , and many of these he presented to me by Mrs. Shelfer 's hands . Every Sunday morning he was up before the daylight , and away for an excursion , or rather an incursion , through the Hampstead , Highgate , and Holloway district . From these raids he used to return as I came home from the morning service . By the way , if I had wanted to puzzle him and find a blank in his universal acquaintance , the best chance would have been to ask him about the clergyman . He never gave the pew - openers any trouble , neither indeed did Mrs. Shelfer , who called herself a Catholic ; but the lively little woman 's chiefest terror was death , and a parson to her was always an undertaker . If Mr. Shelfer had not spent the Sunday morning quite so well as I had , at any rate he had not wasted his time . I think he must have robbed hen - roosts and allotment grounds ; and yet he was too respectable for that . But whence and how could he ever have come by the gipsey collection he always produced from his hat , from his countless pockets , from his red cotton handkerchief , every Sunday at 1 P.M. ? Eggs , chickens , mushrooms , sticks of horseradish and celery , misletoe - thrushes , cucumbers , cabbages red and white , rabbits , watercress , Aylesbury ducks — I can not remember one quarter of his manifold forage . All I can say is , that if these things are to be found by the side of the road near London , Middlesex is a far better field for the student of natural history than Gloucestershire , or even beloved Devon . Mrs. Shelfer said it was all his luck ; but I hardly think it could have rained Aylesbury ducks , even for Mr. Shelfer . All the time he was extracting from his recesses this multifarious store , he never once smiled , or showed any symptoms of triumph , but gravely went through the whole , as if a simple duty . How was it such a man had not made his fortune ? Because he had an incurable habit of "
64484	64955	63323	63323	he	2146	" for any one who asked him ; and hence he was always in trouble . Mrs. Shelfer and I were admitted readily into the school of design . It was a long low room , very badly lighted , and fitted up for the time until a better could be provided . It looked very cold and comfortless ; forms instead of chairs , and desks like a parish school . The whitewashed walls were hung with diagrams , sections , tracings , reductions , most of them stiff and ugly , but no doubt instructive . At one end was a raised platform , reserved for lecturers and the higher powers . Shelves round the wall were filled with casts and models , and books of instruction were to be had out of cupboards . Of course we were expected to bring our own materials , and a code of rules was exhibited . The more advanced students were permitted to tender any work of their own which might be of service to the neophytes . From no one there did I ever receive any insolence . At first , the young artists used to look at me rather hard , but my reserved and distant air was quite enough to discourage them . After the introduction , which Mrs. Shelfer accomplished in very great style , I dismissed her , and set to in earnest to pore once more over the rudiments of perspective . One simple truth as to the vanishing point struck me at once . I was amazed that I had never perceived it before . It was not set forth in the book I was studying ; but it was the sole key to all my errors of distance . At once I closed the book ; upon that one subject I wanted no more instruction , I had caught the focus of truth . Books , like bad glass , would only refract my perception . All I wanted now was practice and adaptation of the eye . Strange as it seemed to me then , I could draw no more that day . I was so overcome at first sight by the simple beauty of truth , mathematical yet poetical truth , that error and obscurity ( for there is a balance in all things ) had their revenge for a while on my brain . But the truth , once seen , could never be lost again . Thenceforth there were few higher penances for me , in a small way , than to look at one of my early drawings . When my brain was clear , I returned to do a real day 's work . For the cups , and vases , and plates , and things of "
64958	65072	63323	63323	he	2146	" ( as they chose to call it ) , I did not care at all ; but the copies and models and figures were most useful to me . Unless I am much mistaken , I made more advance in a fortnight there , than I had in any year of my life before . With my usual perseverance — if I have no other virtue , I have that — I worked away to correct my many shortcomings ; not even indulging ( much as I wanted the money ) in any attempts at a finished drawing , until I felt sure that all my foundations were thoroughly laid and set . "
65076	65082	63323	63323	he	2146	" I cried towards Christmas , "
65104	65527	65101	65102	Clara Vaughan	293	" It did me good when I was alone , to call myself by my own name , and my right to be my father 's daughter . Meanwhile old Christmas was come , and all I was worth in the world was change for half a sovereign . True , my lodgings were paid for , a fortnight in advance , because good Mrs. Shelfer wanted to treat all her pets to a Christmas dinner ; but as for my own Christmas dinner — though I ca n't say I cared much for it — if I got one at all , it must be upon credit , since my drawing would not be finished for another week . Credit , of course , I would not think of . Any day in the week or year , I would rather starve than owe money . However , I was not going to cry about plum - pudding , though once or twice it made me hungry to think of the dinner in the great hall at Vaughan Park on the Christmas eve ; a much more elaborate matter in the old time , than the meal served in the dining - room next day . Now I sat in my little room this dreary Christmas eve ; and do what I would , I could not help thinking a little . It was a gusty evening , cold and damp , with scuds of sleet and snow , as yet it had not made up its mind whether to freeze or thaw . Nevertheless , the streets were full of merry laughing parties , proud of their bargains for the Christmas cheer ; and as they went by , the misletoe and the holly glistened in the flickering gaslight . For old recollection 's sake , I had made believe to dress my little room with some few sprigs of laurel and unberried holly ; the sceptre branch , all cobbed with coral beads , was too expensive for me . Misletoe I wanted not . Who was there now to kiss me ? From the sheer craving of human nature for a word of kindness , I had called , that afternoon , upon Mrs. Elton . But good as she was and sweet to me , she had near relatives coming ; and I saw or fancied , that I should be in the way . Yet I thought that her mother heart yearned toward me as she said "
65531	66147	65101	65102	Clara Vaughan	293	" and showed me out by the Christmas tree , all trembling to be lighted . Now I sat alone and lonely by the flickering of three pennyworth of wood which I had bought recklessly for the sake of the big ash - tree that used to glow with the lichen peeling round it on the old Christmas hearth , where I was believed the heiress . The little spark and sputter of my sallow billet ( chopped by the poor old people at St. Pancras workhouse ) led me back through eight sad years to the last merry time when my father was keeping his latest Christmas , and I his pride and hope was prouder than all , at being just ten years old . How he carved and ladled the gravy ; how he flourished his knife and fork with a joke all hot for every one ; how he smiled when the thrice - helped farmers sent for another slice , and laughed when the crow - boy was nearly choked with plum - pudding ; how he patted me on the head and caught me for a kiss , when I , dressed up as head - waitress , with my long hair all tied back , pulled his right arm and pointed to widow Hiatt 's plate — the speech he made after dinner , when I was amazed at his eloquence and clapped my little hands , and the way he made me stand up on a chair and drink the Queen 's health first — then the hurrahs of the tenants and servants , and how they kissed me outside — all this goes through my memory as the smoke of the billet goes up the chimney , and the tears steal under my eyelids . Then I see the long hall afterwards , with the tables cleared away and the lights hung round the tapestry , and the yule log roaring afresh ; my father ( a type of the true English gentleman , not of the past but the present century ) , holding the hand of his wife ( a lady of no condescending airs , but true womanly warmth and love)—both dressed for the tenants ' ball as if for the lord - lieutenant 's ; both eager to lead off the country dance , and beating their feet to the music . Next them , a laughing child in a little white frock and pink slip ( scarce to be known for myself ) , hand - in - hand with my brave chevalier , Master Roderick Blount , accounted by Cooky and both lady's - maids , and most of all by himself , my duly affianced lord . Then the housekeeper , starched beyond measure , yet not too stiff to smile , and open for the nonce even to jokes about courtship , yielding her gracious hand for the dance to the senior tenant , a man with great calves , red face , and snow - white hair . After them come — Hark ! a loud knock and a ring . It is just in time before I begin the palinode . Who can want me to - night ? I want no one but those I can not have , whom the fire has now restored me , though the earth has hidden them . Mrs. Shelfer is hard at work in the kitchen , preparing a wonderful supper for Charley , who has promised to come home . She has canvassed the chance of his keeping this promise fifty times in the day . Hope cries "
66150	66153	65101	65102	Clara Vaughan	293	" experience whispers "
66156	66180	66181	66182	Miss Valence	423	" At any rate the knock is not his , for he always carries a latch - key . She calls up the stairs "
66184	66243	66181	66182	Miss Valence	423	" before she goes to the door , for who knows but she might be murdered in the midst of her Christmas pudding ? I come out to prove my existence and stand in the dark on the landing . She draws back the bolt ; I hear a gruff voice as if it came through a hat . "
66256	66257	66244	66246	Young ' ooman	2155	" "
66272	66273	66263	66264	Miss Valence	423	" "
66287	66288	66285	66285	Waun	443	" "

66345	66444	66332	66332	Walence	445	" Jim , from the top of the van , suggests that , after all , Walence and Waun be much of a muchness . For his part , he 'll be blessed if he 'll go any further with it . Let him and Ben look at the young lady , and see if she be like the card . Meanwhile , of course , I come forward and claim the parcel , whatever it is . Mrs. Shelfer redoubles her assurances , and calls the man a great oaf , which has more effect than anything . "
66474	66475	66478	66478	he	395	" "
66500	66526	66527	66527	Waun	443	" This fact is decisive . Who can doubt any more ? But for all that , the book must be signed in the name of "
66529	66570	66527	66527	Waun	443	" with which of course I comply . When the two strong men have , with much difficulty ( of which they made much more ) , lowered the enormous package from the van , Ben stands wiping his forehead . "
66659	66660	66655	66655	you	444	" "
66663	66667	66655	66655	you	444	" replies Jim , "
66750	66751	66729	66731	the young lady	5814	" "
66758	66772	66775	66775	miss	5433	" I ask , trembling for my change of the half - sovereign . "
66838	66869	66873	66874	Miss Valence	423	" Away they go with the smoking horses , after carrying into the little kitchen the mighty maun , which Mrs. Shelfer , with my assistance , could not stir . "
66880	66954	66873	66874	Miss Valence	423	" cries Mrs. Shelfer , when the full light falls upon it . The direction was written in round hand upon a strip of parchment , about four inches wide and at least eight feet in length . It came from the bottom all up over the cover and down upon the other side , so that no one could open the basket without breaking it asunder . It was as follows : — "
67057	67152	67049	67049	his	299	" I wondered much whether Mr. Beany Dawe had been called in to achieve this masterpiece of manuscript , which was all in large round hand , but without any stops . It seemed beyond poor Sally 's art , yet were some loops and downstrokes that must be dear little Sally 's . I took it off with much trouble — the parchment was joined in four places — and I have it now . Meanwhile Mrs. Shelfer was dancing around it , neglecting her supper in the wonder of this gigantic hamper . "
67178	67552	67556	67558	my good friend	1798	" However , I did get it open at last , and never shall I forget the contents . There was a month 's food for a family of twelve . First came hay , such as I never smelt out of Devonshire ; then eighteen rolls of butter , each with a snowy cloth around it ; the butter so golden even at that time of year , that Mrs. Shelfer compared it to the yolk of an egg looking out of the white . Then a storey of clotted cream and beautiful lard and laver , which they knew I loved . Then a floor of hay . Below it a pair of guinea fowls , two large turkeys , and most carefully wrapped from the rest a fine hare filled with dried sweet herbs . Below these a flitch of bacon , two wood - smoked hams , a pair of tongues , a leg of Exmoor mutton , and three bottles of best elder wine . Then a brown paper parcel containing Sally 's last copy - book ( I had set her copies for half a year to come ) and a long letter , the first I had ever received from Tossil 's Barton . When all was out at last , after the greatest delight and laughter as each thing appeared , I fell back in utter dismay at the spectacle before me . Mrs. Shelfer sat on the floor unable to find her way out , she was so flounced and tippeted with good things . When I came to her relief , she did nothing but go round and round what was left of the little room , humming a Catholic hymn , and pressing both hands to her side . But something must be done at once . Waste is wickedness ; how could we stave it off ? Everything would depend upon the weather . At present all was beautifully fresh , thanks to the skilful packing and the frost , albeit the mighty package had made the round of all the Albert Streets in London . Mrs. Shelfer would have looked at it for a month , and at intervals exclaimed , "
67573	67574	67556	67558	my good friend	1798	" "
67641	67642	67649	67649	Miss	2185	" "
67651	67652	67649	67649	Miss	2185	" "
67693	68021	67681	67681	I	0	" So we got all that was taintable into the little yard , while Tom , who never stole , except when quite sure of impunity , looked on very sagely . There we fixed it all up to the wall secure , except from cats , of whom a roving band serenaded me every night . I presented Mrs. Shelfer at once with a turkey — a specimen of natural history not found by the roadside , even on Mr. Shelfer 's Sabbath journey — also a ham , and three rolls of butter . As to the rest , I would think what to do with it afterwards . Mrs. Shelfer kept off the cats until midnight , after which I held them at bay by the following means . With one of my mineral paints mingled with some phosphorus , I drew upon a black board a ferocious terrier , the size of life , with fangs unsheathed , bristles erect , and eyes starting out of his head . We tried the effect in the dark on poor Tom , who arched his back , and sputtered with the strongest execration , then turned and fled ignobly , amid roars of laughter from Mr. Shelfer , who by this time was come home . This one - headed Cerberus being hung so as to oscillate in the wind , right across the cat - leap , I felt quite safe , so long as my chemical mixture should continue luminous . Dear little Sally 's letter gave me the greatest delight . It was all in round hand , and had taken at least a week to write , and she must have washed her hands almost every time . There were no stops in it , but I have put some . The spelling was wonderfully good for her , but here and there I have shaped it to the present fashion . "
68521	68545	68547	68547	Miss	2217	" How she tossed her pretty curls when she wrote this I 'll be bound . I wished that I could see her . "
69685	69724	69678	69678	his	299	" I was much grieved at the loss of my last letter to Tossil 's Barton , because it contained my little Christmas presents for all the family . It was registered for security , but I suppose they "
69728	70486	69678	69678	his	299	" of that where the delivery of letters depended so much upon luck . Of their Christmas present to me I resolved to give the surplus to those who would be the better for it , and not ( according to the usual law of such things ) to those who did not want it , and would make return with interest . So on the Christmas morning Mrs. Shelfer and myself , each carrying a large basket , went to the mews round the corner , and distributed among the poor lodgers there , more Christmas dinners than had ever entered those doors before ; and how grateful the poor things were , only they all wanted the best . Now the school of design was closed for a while , and I worked hard for several days at the landscape for Mr. Oxgall , though the store of provisions sent me and the rent enclosed in the turkey had saved me from present necessity . On the day of all days in the year the saddest and darkest to me , I could not keep to my task , but went for a change of thoughts to the school , now open again . It was the 30th of December , 1850 , and , though I crouch not to the mumming of prigs scolloped out at the throat , who block out with a patchwork screen the simple hearth of religion , and kneel at an ashbin to warm themselves ; though I do n't care a herring for small anniversaries dotted all over the calendar , and made by some Murphy of old ; yet I reverence deeply the true feasts of Church and Chapel , the refreshings of faith and charity , whereupon we forgive and are sorry for those who work hard to mar them . Neither does it seem to me — so far as my timid and wavering judgment extends — to be superstition or vanity , if we dare to set mark by those dates in our own little span which God has scarred on our memory . In the long dark room so bare and comfortless , and , to - day , so lonely and cold , I got my usual books and studies , and tried , all in vain , to fix my attention on them . Finding the effort so fruitless , I packed up my things in the little black bag and rose to depart . Turning round , I saw on the table , where students ' works were exhibited , a small object newly placed there . It was a statuette in white marble of a magnificent red deer , such as I had seen once or twice in the north of Devon . The listening attitude , the turn of the neck , the light poise of the massive head , even the mild , yet spirited eye , and the quivering sensitive lip , I could answer for them all , they were done to the very life . Truth , power , and elegance triumphed in every vein of it . For a minute I stood overcome with wonder . If this were the work of a youthful sculptor , England might hope at last for something beyond the grotesque . Before me rose at once all the woodland scenery , the hill - side garbed with every shade of green , the brambled quarry standing forth , the trees , the winding vales embosoming the light , the haze that hovers above the watersmeet , bold crests of amaranth heath behind , and far away the russet wold of Exmoor . The stag in the foreground of my landscape , I feel so grateful to him for this expanse of vision that I stoop down and kiss him , while no one can see me . As I bend , the gordit drops from its warm home in my breast . By some impulse undefined I lift the ribbon from my neck , and hang the little fairy 's heart on the antlers of the Devonshire deer . Out springs from behind a chest full of casts and models — what model can compare with her?—the loveliest of all lovely beings , my little Isola Ross . I hide the tears in my eyes , and try to look cold and reserved . What use is it ? One smile of hers would have disarmed Belial . "
70680	71696	70675	70675	their	2283	" Poor little dear ! I lived upstairs , and could not have seen her without standing out on the balcony , which was about the size of a chess - board . If she had not been so simple as to walk on my side of the street , she must have seen me ere long , for I sat all day near the window to draw , when I was not away at my school . I forgave her most graciously for having done me no wrong , and kissed her with all my heart . Her breath was as sweet as violets in Spring clover , and her lips warm and soft as a wren 's nest . On receiving my forgiveness , away she went dancing down the long room , with her cloak thrown off , and her hair tossing all out of braid , and her exquisite buoyant figure floating as if on a cloud . Of course there was no one there , or even impulsive Isola would hardly have taken her frolic ; and yet I am not sure . She never thought harm of any one , and never imagined that any one could think harm of her . After a dozen flits of some rapid elegant dance quite unknown to me ( who have never had much of dancing ) , but which I supposed to be Scotch , back she came out of breath , and kissed me ever so many times , and kissed my gordit too , and told me never to part with it . One thing she was sure of , that her Papa could not resist me now , and when he was told of it I should come to their house the next day . And she knew I was dreadfully proud , but would I , for her sake , forgive her Pappy ? Of course , he knew nothing about me , and she had never told him my name , though she could not help telling my story , at least all she knew of it ; but he was so dreadfully jealous of her , he did not want any one to have a touch of her glove but himself . Looking at her pure sweet face , I could well believe it ; but how could he bear to see that dear little thing go three days without food ? Most likely she had exaggerated . Although she was truthful as light , sometimes her quick fancy and warmth , like the sunshine itself , would bring out some points too strongly . However , I was prepared , without that , to dislike the Professor , for , as a general rule , I do n't like men who moralise ; at least if their philosophy is frigid . Nevertheless , I promised very readily to forgive her Papa , for I did so love that Isola . Her nature was so different to mine , so light and airy , elastic and soft ; in short ( if I must forsake my language ) , the complement of my own . We chatted , or rather she did , for at least half an hour ; and then she told me old Cora was coming to fetch her at three o'clock . Once more I rose to depart , for I feared she might get into trouble , if the old nurse should find her so intimate with a stranger . But Isola told me that she did not care for her a bit , and she had quite set her heart on my meeting her brother Conrad , the sculptor of that magnificent stag . Perhaps he would come with Cora , but he was so altered now , she could never tell what he would do . Since the time she first saw me , Conrad had come of age , and she could not guess what it was all about , but there had been a dreadful disturbance between him and his father , and he had actually gone to live away from the family . She thought it must be about money , or some such nasty thing ; but even Cora did not know , or if she did , the old thing would not tell . It had made poor Isola cry till her eyes were sore , but now she supposed she must make up her mind to it all . But she would tell the truth , she did hate being treated like a baby when she was a full - grown woman ; how much taller did they expect her to be ? And what was much worse , she did want so to comfort them both , and how could she do it without knowing what was the matter ? It was too bad , and she wished she was a boy , with all her heart she did . She went on talking like this till her gentle breast fluttered , and her coral lips quivered , and the tears stole down her long lashes , and she crept to me closer for comfort . I was clasping her round little waist , and kissing the bright drops away , when in burst a dark , scraggy woman , who must , of course , be old Cora . She tore the poor child from my arms , and scowled at me fiercely enough to frighten a girl unacquainted with real terrors . I met her dark gaze with a calm contempt , beneath which it quailed and fell . She mumbled some words in a language or patois , which I supposed to be Gaelic , and led off her charge towards the door . She had mistaken her adversary . Was I to be pushed aside , like a gingerbread woman tempting a weak - stomached child ? I passed them ; then turned and confronted the hag . "
71746	72333	71733	71733	you	2285	" Isola was too frightened to speak . I know not what would have been the result , if the old hag , who was glaring about , rather taken aback , but still clutching that delicate arm , had not suddenly spied my fairy 's heart , as yet unrestored to its sanctuary . She stared , for a moment , in wide amazement ; then her whole demeanour was altered . She cringed , and fawned , and curtseyed , as if I had worn a tiara . She dropped my dear Isola 's arm , and fell behind like a negress . My poor little pet was trembling and cold with fright , for ( as she told me afterwards ) she had never seen old Cora in such a passion before , and the superstitious darling dreaded the evil eye . As we went towards Isola 's home , I could not help thinking how fine the interview would be between Mrs. Shelfer and Cora , if I only chose to carry that vanquished beldame thither ; but sage discretion ( was I not now eighteen ? ) , and the thought of that solemn day prevented me . So I took them straight home , leading Isola while she guided me , and turning sometimes , with complacency , to encourage old Cora behind us . The house they lived in was a high but narrow one , dull - looking and dark , with area rails in front . Some little maiden came to the door , and I took my leave on the steps . Dear Isola , now in high spirits again , kissed me , like a peach quite warm in the sun , and promised to come the next day , about which there could now be no difficulty . Old Cora bent low as she wished me good evening and begged leave to kiss my cordetto . This I granted , but took good care not to let it pass out of my hands ; she admired it so much , especially when allowed to examine it , and there was such a greedy light in her eyes , that I was quite sure she would steal it upon the first chance ; and therefore I went straightway and bought a guard of thick silk cord , as a substitute for the black riband , which was getting worn . And so I came home before dark , full of wonder , but feeling rather triumphant , and greatly delighted at having recovered dear Isola . Late in the evening of that same day , I sat in my room by the firelight only ( for I could not work ) and tried to look into myself , and find out the cause of my strange attraction or rather impulsion towards Isola . Somehow or other I did not wonder so much that she should be drawn quite as strongly towards me , although an impartial observer would perhaps have wondered far more . Alter puzzling myself in vain with this inquiry , my thoughts began to move , in their usual gloomy train . Eight years had now elapsed , and what had I discovered ? Nothing ; but at long dark intervals some impress of the deed itself , more than of the doer . Had I halted in pursuit , or had my vengeance cooled ? To the former question my conscience answered "

72343	72695	72696	72697	Miss Valence	423	" Gentle influences had been shed around me , sorrow had bedewed the track of hate , intercourse with happy harmless people , and gratitude for unmerited kindness ; it was not in human nature , however finely constitute for evil , entirely to repulse these powers . I could not deny , that the religion of my heart , during the last twelvemonth , had been somewhat neglected . For my devotion to dear mother , no plea was required . But the time since that , what business had I with laughing children , and snug firesides , with dickybirds , and Sandy the squirrel ? Even sweet Isola caused me a pang of remorse ; but no , I could not quite abandon her . But now , thank God , I was in the right road again , and plodding resolutely as my father could expect . To his spirit , ever present with me , I knelt down and poured out my remorse ; and swore to make amends , whatever it might cost me . Yet even then , a gentle shadow seemed to come as well , and whisper the words that calmed the face of death . My musings , if so mild a word may suit them , were roughly interrupted by a loud step on the stairs . Inspector Cutting , who could walk when needful like a cat , loved to redress this injury to the Goddess Echo , by making double noise when not on business . Farmer Huxtable , a man of twice the weight , would have come up those stairs at half the expense in sound . When he entered the room , he found himself in a semi - official state again , and I saw that he was not come for nothing . In a few brief words , he told me what he had done , which was not very much ; or perhaps my suspicion was right , that he only told me a part of it . Then he said abruptly , "

73603	74097	73596	73596	I	0	" I was thinking of dear mother ; and began to feel already that my character was changing . Inspector Cutting gave me some minute instructions , and in less than half an hour we set forth upon our enterprise . I was wrapped in a loose grey cloak having a hooded cape ; and carefully hidden I carried for self - defence a very keen stiletto . I had procured it indirectly from the best cutler in London , but neither workmanship nor material could be compared to that of Italy . The night was dark and cold , the streets were almost deserted , and all the shops except the chemists ' and the public - houses closed . We walked straightway to the nearest cabstand , where Mr. Cutting ordered a vehicle , and put me inside , himself riding with the driver . So little did I know as yet of London , that after the first turn or two , I could not even guess what direction we were taking . I had such confidence in my guide , a staid respectable man with a grown up family , that I never thought there could be harm in my journeying with him at night . And even had I thought so , most likely I should have done it all the same . Ever since the time he wounded me , or allowed me to wound myself , his manner towards me had been most kind , considerate , and respectful ; though he found it his duty now and then to repress my impetuosity . With all my perception alert , I kept a sharp look - out from the window , but vainly strove to find anything that might serve for a landmark . Once we stopped for about five minutes , at a police - station somewhere in Clerkenwell , where , by the light of a lamp , I read , without leaving the cab , the ghastly descriptions of all the dead bodies recently found in London and waiting identification . Hereupon my courage began to ooze , and the weather seemed much colder . The type was hard to read at that distance , and the imagination had fair play , as it does when words come slowly . Anon the inspector reappeared , so altered in dress and countenance , that I did not know him until he made me a bow . With a glance of encouragement , and a little grin of dry humour , he mounted the box again . After another long drive , in the course of which we ran silently over a wooden road,—probably High Holborn,—we stopped in a broad but deserted thoroughfare , very badly lighted . Here Mr. Cutting opened the door , helped me out , and discharged the cab , but whispered something to the driver before he let him go . "

74312	74367	74368	74369	Poor child	5381	" This little dissertation was meant to divert my thoughts . I made no reply , being ignorant of such matters ; neither did I care to talk about them then . Nevertheless , I believe Inspector Cutting was wrong . As we entered a narrow street he suddenly turned and looked at me . "
74393	74394	74388	74388	you	5381	" "
74401	74411	74388	74388	you	5381	" But I tried in vain to think so . "

74511	74558	74498	74499	Inspector Cutting	412	" Hereupon he led me into a little room , fenced off from the bar of some refreshment - house . A glorious fire was burning , by which he set and left me . Presently he returned , with a small glass in his hand . "
74575	74593	74598	74598	you	412	" I saw by the firelight that it was brandy , or some dark - coloured spirit . "
74609	74631	74601	74601	you	412	" I threw such emphasis on the personal pronoun , and looked at him so indignantly , that he laughed outright . "
74650	74672	74644	74644	I	0	" And with that he tipped it off , and then returned to business , all the graver for the interlude . "
74706	75076	74701	74701	you	5381	" I assured him that I could very easily do so , and that it was nothing but the sudden effect of the cold . Forth we went again into the winter night , after I had learned from him that we were now in Whitechapel , not far from Goodman 's Fields . After another short walk , we came to the end of a narrow by - street , where there was an archway . Passing through this archway , we descended some steep and broken steps . Then the Inspector produced a small lamp brightly burning , which he must have lit at the public - house . It was not what is called a bull's - eye , but a reflector - lamp . By its light I saw that the chief entrance to the house must be round the corner , and perhaps in another street . With a small key which he took from his pocket , Mr. Cutting unlocked a little iron gate , and we entered a narrow passage . At the end of it was a massive door studded with great nails . Here my guide gave a gentle knock , and hid the lamp as before . Presently we heard a shrill sound from the keyhole , like a dryad 's voice . The Inspector stooped thereto , and pronounced the password . Not without some difficulty the lock was turned and the bolts withdrawn , and we stood inside . A child , under - sized and unnaturally sharp , stared at us for a moment , then dodged away from the lamp , as if more accustomed to darkness . Mr. Cutting closed the door and refastened it , then led me through some basement rooms unpaved and unfurnished , until we came to an iron step - ladder . This he ascended , and helped me up , and we found ourselves in a small dark lobby , containing no furniture , except a high three - legged stool . When he closed his lamp all around was dark , but on the rafters overhead a faint patch of light appeared — ceiling there was none . "
75083	75113	75078	75078	you	2323	" he whispered to me , pointing , as I could just perceive , to a narrow glazed opening high in the wall , whence the faint gleam proceeded . "
75128	75197	75198	75198	I	0	" He cast the light of his lamp upon the stool for a moment , while I did as he bade me . Standing there , I found that I was tall enough to look through ; but the narrow pane which formed the window was thickly covered with size , or some opaque integument . All I could tell was , that the space beyond was lighted . "

76052	76137	76048	76048	God	303	" I whispered , as he glided out of sight along the vaults below . I could see no other entrance to the place in which I sat ; but how could I tell ? For a minute excitement kept me hot ; but as the last gleam of the light died upon the wall below , my heart began to throb heavily , and a chill came over me . The pulse thumped in my ears , like a knocking in the cellar . "
76142	77912	76048	76048	God	303	" I asked myself , in scorn that I should ask . No , it was not fear , but horrible suspense . The balance of life and death , of triumph and disgrace , swung there before me in the dark , as if my breath would turn it . No dream of a child , no vagary of the brain — the clear perception of strong will and soul poised upon this moment . The moment was too long ; the powers began to fail , the senses grew more faint and confused at every heavy throb . Little images and little questions took the place of large ones . In vain I looked for even a cobweb , or the skeleton of a fly , where the dull light flickered through the pane of glass . In vain I listened for a mouse . Even a rat ( much as I hate him ) would have been welcome then . The repeater was purposely made so low of tick , that I got no comfort thence . All was deep , unfathomable silence , except the sound of my rebel heart . As a forlorn hope , I began to reckon sixty slowly , as a child keeps with a ticking clock . It would not do . My heart was beating louder than ever , and my hands were trembling ; even my teeth rattled like dice in a box as the time approached . The nerves will not be hoodwinked ; the mind can not swindle the body . I once slapped the cheeks of my governess . I can not treat nature so . Try the sweet influence , and the honest coin of reason . It will not do . All trembling , I strike the repeater . Five minutes more , and the trial must come . My heart is fluttering like a pigeon 's throat . The long suspense has been too much . Oh ! why was I submitted to this cruel ordeal ? The walls are thick . I can hear no movement in the secret room . There comes a creeping , fingering , sound , as of one whose candle is out , groping for the door . It passes along the pane of glass , and a shadow is thrown on the rafter . Who can it be ? What stealthy hand but that of my father 's murderer ? The word — the thought is enough . What resolution , reason , justice , all in turn , have failed to do , passion has done at once — passion at myself , as well as at my enemy . Is it Clara Vaughan , who , for eight long years of demon 's reign , has breathed but for this moment — is Clara Vaughan to shake like the wooden - legged blackbird now her chance is come ? A rush of triumph burned , like vitriol , through my veins . Every nerve was braced , every sense alert and eager . Against the light of that window , dull as it was , I could have threaded the finest needle that ever was made . I struck my repeater again . It was the hour , the minute , when my father died . With the mere spring of my instep I leaped upon the stool . I could see it clearly now . I dipped the broad camel's - hair brush in the flat phial , holding it carefully at arm 's length , and then drew it lightly along the pane , quite at the bottom , from corner to corner . One more dip , one more stripe above , a steam hovered on the glass , and there was a gazing - place , clear as crystal , and wide enough to show most of the narrow room . Of the room itself I took no heed ; the occupants were my study . Only four in all . One man at a high desk writing rapidly ; three men sitting round a small table , talking earnestly , and with much gesticulation , but the tone too low for me even to guess their language . From the appearance , manner , and action of the speakers , I felt sure that it was not English , and I thought that it was not French . Why , I can not say ; but my attention fixed itself upon the man who was writing at the top of the room . Perhaps it was because I could see him best , for he stood with his face full towards me . He was a man of middle age and stature , strongly framed , closely knit , and light of limb , with a handsome , keenly oval face , broad forehead , black eyes , glancing quickly and scornfully at his three comrades , long hair of an iron grey , falling on his shoulders , and tossed back often with a jerk of the head . His hands were white and restless , quick as light in their motion . On the left thumb flashed a large red jewel . Though I could not see the paper , I knew by the course of the quill that the writing was very small . But one minute I watched him , for the film was returning upon the glass , and I must scan the others ; yet in that time he had written several lines , half of them without looking at the paper , but with his eyes upon the other three . I knew him now he was in clear light , I could swear to him anywhere again . The last glance I could spare him sent a shudder through me , for in his impatience he shifted one foot from the shade of the desk . It was small , pointed , and elegant . The film was thickening , like frost upon the pane , when I began to observe the others . But I saw enough to print their faces on my memory , or those at least of two . The third I could not see so well . He seemed older than the rest . All the men wore loose grey tunics , with a red sash over the left shoulder . I judged that the three were debating hotly , as to some measure , upon which the fourth had resolved . Every now and then , they glanced at him uneasily . At him I gazed again , with deadly hatred , cold as ice , upon my heart . I felt my dagger handle . Oh for one moment with him ! In my fury I forgot the Inspector 's warning . The film was closing over . I touched the glass with my lashes . A flash of agony shot through my eyes . With a jerk I drew back , the stool rocked under me , one foot of it struck the wall . I clutched the window sill , and threw my weight inwards . Down came the foot of the stool , loud as the bang of a door . I thought it was all over . How I stifled a scream I know not ; had it escaped me , I should never have told this story . I had the presence of mind to stand still , and watch , though my eyes were maddening me , what the cut - throats would do . Through the agony , and the dimness , I could just see them all start , and rush to the door at the side of the room . The writer stood first , with his papers thrust anyhow into his bosom , a pistol in one hand , a poniard in the other . Did I know the shape of it ? The other three were armed , but I could not see with what . They crouched behind a heavy screen , presenting ( I supposed ) their pistol muzzles at the door . Finding no attack ensue , they began to search . Now was the real danger to me . If they searched that window before the size returned , my life ended there . Fear was past . Desperation seized me . If I was doomed to blindness , just as well to death . But I clutched my dagger . My left ear was against the wall . I heard a hand graze the partition inside , then a chair placed under the embrasure , and a step upon it . I was still upon the stool , stooping close beneath the window frame . Suddenly the light streak vanished , the size flew over it , as the breath flies over glass in the hardest frost . The hand felt along the window frame , the dull shadow of a head flitted upon the beam . It was within a foot of mine . The searcher passed on , without suspicion . Strange it was , but now the deadliest peril was over , triple fear fell upon me . The heat flew back to my heart , just now so stanch and rigid ; my hair seemed to creep with terror . Dear life , like true love scorned , would have its way within me . Quietly I slid down from the stool , and cowered upon it , in a storm of trembling . My eyelids dropped in agony , I could not lift them again , but blue and red lights seemed to dance within them . I had made up my mind to blindness ; but not , oh not just yet , to death . How long I remained in this abject state , scorning myself , yet none the braver , is more than I can tell , or even cared to ask . May it never be the lot of any , not even the basest murderer ! Worn out at last , in a lull of pain and terror , I fell into deep sleep , from which I was awakened by a hand upon my shoulder . I tried to look up , but could not . Sight was fled , and as I thought for ever . But I felt that it was a friend . "

In the morning I dreamed of Isola . Across a broad black river , I saw her lovely smile . Thick fog rose from the water , in which two swans were beating a dog , and by snatches only could I see my darling . She waved her little hand to me , and begged me , with that coaxing smile which bent cast iron and even gold , to come across to Isola . In vain I looked for a boat , even in my dream I knew that I could not swim , and if I could , the lead upon my eyelids would have sunk me . So I called to her to come to me , and with that cry awoke . It was striking ten — my own little clock which my father gave me . I counted every stroke . What was Mrs. Shelfer doing , that she had not called me yet ? What was I doing , that I lay there so late ; for I always get up early ? And what was the sun about , that no light came into the room ? I knew it was ten in the morning . I felt all round . I was in my little bed , the splinter at the side of the head - board ran into my finger as usual . There I was , and nowhere else . Was it a tremendous fog ? If it was , they should have told me , for they knew that I liked fogs . At least they thought so , from the interest I felt . I groped for the little bell - pull , a sleezy worsted cord , which meant to break every time , but was not strong enough to do it . I jerked with all my strength , which seemed very little somehow . What a pleasure ! The bell rang like a fire - peal . I fell back on the pillow , exhausted , but determined to have it out with Mrs. Shelfer . I put my hands up to arrange my hair , to look a little more like Clara Vaughan , when the light should enter , and to frighten Mrs. Shelfer . There was something on my head . I never wear a night - cap ; my long black hair would scorn it . Am I in a madhouse , is this put to keep me cool ? Cold it is , and my brain so hot . All Wenham lake on Dives , and he will only hiss . While I am pulling at it , and find it streaming wet , in comes — I know her step — Mrs. Shelfer . But there is no light from the passage ! "

78762	79352	79353	79354	Young lady	1872	" I fell back upon my pillow , and could rise no more . The truth had been tingling through me , all the time she talked . I was stone - blind . I flung the bandage from me , and wished my heart would break . Mrs. Shelfer tried some comfort . She seemed to grieve for my eyelashes , more than for my eyes ; and addressed her comfort more to my looks than sight . Of course , I did not listen . When would the creature be gone , and let me try to think ? Poor little thing ! I was very sorry ; what fault was it of hers ? Who and what am I , blind I , to find fault with any one who means me well ? I drop my eyelids , I can feel them fall ; I lift them , I can feel them rise ; a full gaze , a side gaze , a half gaze ; with both eyes , with one ; it is all the same ; gaze there may be , but no sight . Henceforth I want no eyelids . The sun is on my face . I can feel his winter rays , though my cheeks are wet . What use is he to me ? I have the dagger somewhere by which my father died . Let me find it , if I can . I could have sworn that the box was in that corner carefully concealed . I strike against a washing - stand . Ah , now I have it ; the box is locked , my keys are in the top - drawer . I bear the box to the bed , and go groping for the chest of drawers . Already I can tell by the sun - warmth on my face , which way I am going . Surely , if I wait , I shall have the instinct of the blind . What care I for that ? The coward love of life suggested that poor solace . Now I have the keys . Quick unlock the box . At length I throw the cover back . The weapon handle is to the right . I stoop to seize it . I grasp a square of colour . Pretty instinct this ! I have got my largest drawing box . Oh paints , my paints , so loved but yesterday , that ape the colours I shall never see , my hot tears make you water - colours indeed ! If God has robbed my eyes of sight , He has not dried my tears . The gushing flood relieves me . What right have I to die ? Even without asking if my case be hopeless ! Who knows but what these lovely tints may glow for me again ? May I not once more intone the carmine damask of the rose , the gauzy green of April 's scarf ? Softening scenes before me rise . I lay my box of colours by , and creep into my bed for warmth . Presently the doctor comes . Inspector Cutting has chosen him , and chosen well . From his voice I know that he is a gentleman , from his words and touch instinctively I feel that he understands the case . When he has finished the examination he sees me trembling for the answer which I dare not seek . "

No thickening of the membrane can exclude that face . Inspector Cutting is still below ; I will send for him at once . Mrs. Shelfer remonstrates . "

79828	79969	79819	79820	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" I hear the Inspector 's step , not so heavy this time . He asks how I am , and expresses his sorrow . I feel obliged to him for not reminding me that the fault was all my own . Then I implore him , if he wishes me ever to see again , to tell me all he knows about the men I saw last night . Thus entreated , he can not refuse me , but first looks up and down the stairs , as I know by the sound of his steps ; then he shuts the door of the sitting - room . All he knows is not very much . They are refugees , Italian refugees ; two political and two criminal exiles , leaders now of a conspiracy to revolutionize their country . "
79979	80070	80072	80073	Inspector Cutting	412	" Simply because he has no right . As for the political refugees , of course , we never meddle with them ; as for the two criminals , they have not been demanded by their Government . Wonderful now , is n't it ? The two fellows who have committed murder their Government would not give sixpence for them ; but the two men who have only spouted a little , it would give a thousand pounds for either of them . He ca n't understand such a system . "
80138	80154	80117	80117	I	0	" Would he be afraid to arrest them ? He said they were desperate men . "
80155	80232	80268	80268	him	2365	" He should rather hope he would n't . They had got their knives , and pistols , and all that humbug . But it was more show than fight . They were desperate men in a private quarrel , particular when they could come round a corner , and when women were concerned ; but as for showing honest fight , he would sooner come across three of them , than one good Irish murderer . "
80233	80251	80117	80117	I	0	" What was his proof against my enemy ? I need not ask him which it was . "
80275	80336	80337	80337	He	2365	" Well , his proof was very little . In fact it was no proof at all as yet . But he was not like a juryman . He was quite convinced ; and his eyes should never be off that man , until he had him under warrant , and the whole case clear . Would that satisfy me ? "
80369	80375	80377	80377	my	0	" Catch him at once , "

80536	80544	80609	80610	Inspector Cutting	412	" Why did he take me thither ? "
80545	80596	80597	80597	I	0	" For excellent reasons . As to the one , it was most important that I should always know him again . Moreover , it saved my energies from waste . As to the other three , he had his own reasons for requiring an intelligent witness about their proceedings . "

80863	80968	80852	80853	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" She smiled so bootiful , when I opened the door , Miss , it fetched out all my hair pins ; and when I told her you was ill in bed , and struck stone blind along of some chemical stuff , two big tears came out of her long blue eyes , same as the wet out of a pennorth of violets , Miss ; and as for stopping her , she threw her muff at me , and told me to stop that if I liked , and to run and tell you that she was coming , quick , quick ! "
80978	80988	80975	80975	I	0	" cried the cheery voice I loved so well . "
80997	82031	80991	80991	Clara	293	" The little darling flung her soft warm arms around me , utterly forgetful of her dress , forgetful of all the world , but that little bit of it she held . Her delicious breath came over my fevered cheek , her cool satin flesh was on my burning eyelids . What lotion could be compared to this ? How long she stayed , I can not tell ; I only know that while I heard her voice , and felt her touch , blindness seemed no loss to me . She pronounced herself head nurse ; and as for doctors , what were they , compared to her own father ? If she could coax him , he should come next day , and deliver his opinion , and then the doctor might betake himself to things he understood , if indeed he understood anything , which she did not believe he did , because he had said she was not to come . My drawings too she admired , much more than they deserved , and her brother Conrad must come and see them , he was so fond of drawing , and there was nothing he could not do . She was so sorry she must go now , but old Cora must be tired of patroling , and she herself had a lecture to attend upon the chemical affinity of bodies . What it meant she had no idea , but that would not matter the least ; some of the clever girls said they did , but she would not believe them ; it took a man , she was sure , to understand such subjects . She would bring her work the next day , such as it was , and the nicest bit of sponge that was ever seen , it could not be bought in London ; and she would answer for it I should be able to paint her likeness in a week ; and she would not go till it was dark ; and then the Professor should come for her when his lectures were over , and examine me ; he knew all about optics , and retinas , and pencils of light , and refraction and aberration , and she could not remember any more names ; but she felt quite certain this was a case of optical delusion , and nothing else . How I wished I could have seen her , when she pronounced this opinion , with no little solemnity . She must have looked such a sage ! The thought of that made me laugh , as well as the absurdity of the idea . But I only asked how the Professor was to examine my eyes , if he did not come till dark . To be sure ! She never thought of that . What a little goose she was ! But she would make him come in the morning , before his work began ; and then old Cora would fetch her home to tea . And she had very great hopes , that if she could only persuade her papa to deliver a lecture in my room , it would have such an effect on my optic nerves , that they would come all right directly , at any rate I should know how to treat them . Delighted with this idea , she kissed me , and hugged me , and off she ran , after telling me to be sure to keep my spirits up , and the bandage not too tight . The latter injunction was much easier to obey than the former . She had enlivened me wonderfully , as well as nursed me most delicately ; but now that she was gone , the usual reaction commenced . Moreover , although as the saying is , the sight of her would have been good for sore eyes , the effort at seeing her , which I could not control , when she was present , was , I already felt , anything but good for them . And the loss , when she was gone , was like a second loss of light . Light ! What million thoughts flash through me at that little word ! Swiftest thing the mind has met , too like itself to understand . Is it steed or wing of mind ? Nay , not swift enough for that . Is it then the food of life , prepared betimes ere life appeared , the food the blind receive but can not taste ? If so , far better to be blind from birth . Well I know the taste from memory ; shall I never taste it else ? Has beauty lost its way to me ? The many golden folds of air , the lustrous dance of sunny morn , the soft reclining of the moon , the grand perspective of the stars ( long avenue to God 's own home ) , are these all blank to me , and night made one with day ? Oh God , whose first approach was light , replenisher of sun and stars , whence dart anew thy gushing floods ( solid or liquid we know not ) , whose subtle volume has no bourne or track ; light , the dayside half of life , leaping , flashing , beaming ; glistening , twinkling , stealing ; light ! Oh God , if live I must , grudge me not a ray ! Low fever followed the long prostration to which the fear of outer darkness had reduced my jaded nerves . This fever probably redeemed my sight , by generalizing the local inflammation , to which object the doctor 's efforts had been directed . Tossing on my weary bed , without a glimpse of anything , how I longed for the soft caresses and cool lips of Isola ! But since that one visit , she had been sternly excluded . The Professor had no chance of delivering his therapeutic lecture . In fact he did not come . "
82036	82048	80991	80991	Clara	293	" said Dr. Franks , when he heard of that proposal , "
82183	82197	82209	82209	me	0	" It sounded very hard , but I felt that he was right . "
82302	82303	82284	82285	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" "

82488	82604	82605	82607	Such a pair	2395	" He most kindly sent us both the boxes that very day ; and many a weary hour they lightened of its load . Poor Isola came every day to inquire , and several times she had her brother with her . She made an entire conquest of Mrs. Shelfer , who even gave her a choice canary bird . I was never tired of hearing the little woman 's description of her beauty , and her visit to the kitchen formed the chief event of the day . Mrs. Shelfer ( who had Irish blood in her veins ) used to declare that the ground was not good enough for them to walk on . "
82661	82662	82663	82663	You	2396	" "
82676	82677	82666	82667	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" "
82698	83321	82691	82691	we	2401	" Exactly so . There lay all the difference to me , but none to any other . This set me moralising in my shallow way , a thing by no means natural to me , who was so concentrated and subjective . But loss of sight had done me good , had turned the mind 's eye inward into the darkness of myself . I think the blind , as a general rule , are less narrow - minded than those endowed with sight . Less inclined , I mean , to judge their neighbours harshly , less arrogant in exacting that every pulse keep time with their own . If eyes are but the chinks through which we focus on our brain censoriousness and bigotry , if rays of light are shafts and lances of ill will ; then better is it to have no crystalline lens . Far better to be blind , than print the world - distorted puppets of myself . I , that smallest speck of dust , blown upon the shore of time , blown off when my puff shall come ; a speck ignored by moon and stars ; too small ( however my ambition leap ) for earth to itch , whate'er I suck ; and yet a speck that is a mountain in the telescope of God ; shall I never learn that His is my only magnitude ; shall I wriggle to be all in all to my own corpuscle ? Is there any Mocha stone , fortification agate , or Scotch pebble , with half the veins and mottlings , angles , flux and reflux , that chequer one minute of the human mind ? Was ever machine invented to throw so many shuttles ? At present I am gauged for little threads of thought — two minutes since , the smallest thing I could think of was myself . Now it is the largest . Must I grope from room to room , shall I never be sure where the table is , where my teacup stands ; never read , or write , or draw ; never tell when my hands are clean , except by smelling soap ; never know ( though small the difference ) how my dress becomes me , or when my hair is right ; never see my own sad face , in which I have been fool enough to glory , never — and this is worst of all — never catch another 's smile ? Here am I , a full - grown girl , full of maiden 's thoughts and wonderings , knowing well that I am shaped so but to be a link in life ; must I never think of loving or of being loved , except with love like Isola 's ; sweet affection , very sweet ; but white sugar only ? When my work is over , and my object gained , when my father 's spirit knows the wrong redeemed , as a child I used to think I would lay me down and die . But since I came to woman 's fulness , since I ceased to look at men and they began to look at me , some soft change , I know not what , has come across my dream . Is my purpose altered ? Is my tenor broken ? Not a whit of either . Rather are they stronger set and better led , as my heart and brain enlarge . Yet I see beyond it all , a thing I never used to see , a glow above the peaks of hate , a possibility of home . "
83323	83600	82691	82691	we	2401	" I should have said , for now what have I to do with seeing ? On the fourteenth morning , I had given up all hope . They told me it was bright and sunny ; for I always asked about the weather , and felt most cruelly depressed upon a sunny day . By this time I had learned to dress without Mrs. Shelfer 's aid . Still , from force of habit I went to the glass to do my hair , and still drew back , as far as was allowed , the window curtain . Off with my wet bandage , I am sick of it ; let me try no longer to delude myself . Suddenly a gleam of light , I am sure of it ; faint indeed , and like a Will of the Wisp ; but I am quite sure it was a gleam of light . I go nearer the window and try again . No , there is no more for the present , it was the sudden change produced it . Never mind ; I know what I have seen , a thing that came and cheated me in dreams ; this time it has not cheated me ; it was a genuine twinkle of the sun . I can do nothing more . I can not put another stitch upon me . I am thrilling with the sun , like Memnon . I fall upon my knees , and thank the Father of light . When the Doctor came that day , and looked into my eyes , he saw a decided change . "
83628	83674	83698	83699	Miss Valence	423	" I laughed , and wept , and , blind as I was , could hardly keep from dancing . Then I wanted to kiss the Doctor , but hearing Mrs. Shelfer 's step , made a reckless jump and had it out upon her . "

84191	84454	84187	84187	me	0	" He touched my forehead and was gone . He was the first true gentleman I had met with , since the loss of Farmer Huxtable . When Isola came on the Thursday , and I obtained some little glimpse of her , she expressed her joy in a thousand natural ways , well worth feeling and seeing , not at all worth telling . I loved her for them more and more . I never met a girl so warm of heart . Many women can sulk for days ; most women can sulk for an hour ; I believe that no provocation could have made Isola sulky for two minutes . She tried sometimes ( at least she said so ) , but it was no good . And yet she felt as keenly as any of the very sulkiest women can do ; but she had too much warmth of heart and imagination to live in the folds of that cold - blooded snake . Neither had she the strong selfishness , on which that serpent feeds . In the afternoon , as we still sat together , in rushed Mrs. Shelfer with her bonnet on , quite out of breath , and without her usual ceremony of knocking at the door . I could not think where she had been all the day ; and she had made the greatest mystery of it in the morning , and wanted to have it noticed . Up she ran to me now , and pushed Isola out of the way . "

Charley has seen them do it ever so many times , and he says it 's bootiful , and they do n't mind giving five shillings a piece for them , when they are scarce . "
84944	84964	85000	85000	she	2431	" Did Mr. Shelfer ever try them ? His eyes are so sharp : perhaps that is the reason . "
84965	84995	85000	85000	she	2431	" No . I never heard that he did , Miss. But bless you he never tells me half he does ; no , nor a quarter of half . "

85031	85083	85014	85014	she	2431	" Then when he comes home , Mrs. Shelfer , pop one of these shells , a good big one , into each of his eyes ; and let us know the effect to - morrow morning , and I 'll give you a kiss , if you do it well . "
85095	85141	85088	85088	Isola	463	" Lor , Miss Idols , bless your innocent heart , do you suppose he would let me ? Why he thinks it a great thing to let me tie his shoe , and he wo n't only when he has had a good dinner . "
85142	85145	85147	85147	Isola	463	" Well , "
85149	85185	85147	85147	Isola	463	" I am astonished ! Catch me tying my husband 's shoes ! I shall expect him to tie mine , I know ; and he shall only do that when he is very good . "
85204	85266	85200	85201	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Lor , Miss , it 's all very well for girls to talk ; and they all does it , till they knows better . Though for the likes of you , any one would do anything a most . Pray , Miss Idols , if I may make so bold , how many offers of marriage have you received ? "
85267	85361	85088	85088	Isola	463	" Let me think ! Oh I know ! it 's one more than I am years old . Eighteen altogether , Mrs. Shelfer ; if you count the apothecary 's boy , and the nephew of the library ; but then they were all of them boys , papa 's pupils and that , a deal too young for me . They were all going to die , when I refused them ; but they are all alive so far , at any rate . Is n't it too bad of them ? "
85362	85408	85088	85088	Isola	463	" Well , Miss Idols , if you get as good a husband as you deserve , and that is saying a deal , he 'll tie your shoe may be for a month , and then he 'll look for you to tie his . "
85409	85437	85200	85201	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" And long he may look , even if he has shellfish in his eyes . Why look , Mrs. Shelfer , they 're all crawling about ! "
85438	85573	85088	85088	Isola	463	" Bootiful , is n't it ? Bootiful ! I wish Miss Valence could see them . And look at the horns they goes routing about with ! How they must tickle your eyelids . And what coorious eyes they has ! Ah , I often think , Miss Idols , I likes this sort of thing so much , what a pity it is as I was n't born in the country . I should never be tired of watching the snails , and the earywigs , and the tadpoles . Why , I likes nothing better than to see them stump - legged things come to table in the cabbage . I have not seen one now for ever so long . Oh that Charley , what dreadful lies he do tell ! "
85574	85581	85088	85088	Isola	463	" What about , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
85582	85747	85200	85201	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Why , my good friend , he says them green things with stripes on , and ever so many legs , turns to live butterflies , after they be dead . But I was too many for him there . Yes , yes . The last one as I boiled , I did not say a word about it to him , but I put it by in a chiney - teacup , with the saucer over , in case it should fly away . Bless your heart , young ladies , there it is now , as quiet as anything , and no signs of a butterfly . And when he tells me any lies , about where he was last night , I just goes to the cupboard , and shows him that ; and never another word can he say .

Now I am your successor in the secret ; I , and no one else . To no other will I commit the case . How much I have suffered from your secresy , none but myself can know . Henceforth I will have no help . Three months you have been on the track , and I almost believe that you have discovered nothing . "

I feel once more that it is my destiny to unravel this black mystery ; myself , by my own courage . In asking your aid I was thwarting my destiny . Since then I have had nothing but accidents .

See his long supple stride . He walks just like a leopard — don't you , you pious panther ? I wonder he took to you so . He is not fierce at all , except when he ought to be ; but he hardly ever makes friends . "
91353	91360	91361	91361	Conrad	427	" Whose dog is he ? ' "

91467	92506	91456	91456	Judy	477	" Away we went , and the great dog walked behind , keeping his head most fairly adjusted between us , never shifting its place an inch , whether we walked or ran — as we did where the street was empty , and when we got into the Park . Oh the cold air of heaven , fresh from the clear North Pole , where the Great Bear stalks round the Little Bear with the vigilance of a mother , how it tightens the clip of the joints , puts a sting into every step , flushes the cheeks with Aurora , and sparkles in young eyes ! For the nonce we forget who we are , never think how our clothes blow about , our spirits are on the north wind , what are we more than snow flakes , let us glisten and lift on the air . Crossing the Park ( lightly furrowed with snow at the drains , like our hair when we part it ) we came to a broad sheet of ice . We had heard a long way off a crisp musical hollow sound , like tapping a box with a hole in it . The ice was not like the old ice at Vaughan Park , but seamed and channeled , and up and down , and powdered light grey with scrapings from skates and shoes . Thousands of people were on it , some skating , some sliding , some rushing about and playing hot game with crooked sticks , some sweeping away with short brooms , some crying things for sale and offering skates for hire , many standing still and wistfully eyeing the land ; but all in the height of good humour , laughing , chaffing , holloaing , drinking , and ordering more . Every now and then some great performer ( in his own eyes ) would sail by the women grandly ( like a ship heeling over ) , with his arms folded and foot over foot , and a long cigar in his mouth . For these one devoutly desired a fall . The skaters of real eminence scorned this common show - off , and each had his special admirers forming a ring around him , where he had cut his own circus of smoother and greener ice . Along the brink of firm land , stood nurses and children innumerable ; the maids on the giggle at every challenge borne to them from the glazed waters , the little ones tugging , and kicking , and frantic to get on . The background of all the cold scene , whiter as it receded , and broken by gliding figures , was formed by some low fringed islets , with open water around them , and crane - necked wild fowl wheeling about , and warning boards , and icemen pushing flat - bottomed boats along . In the far distance , to the right , were two or three canvas tents , where they kept the range of the mercury , and the list of the accidents . The long vista was closed now and then , as high as hats and bonnets , by scuds of the drifting ice and snow . Here as we stood on the bank , Giudice forsook us shamefully , and bounded over the ice , with a levity quite scandalous for a serious - minded dog , towards one of the charmed circles , where eminent skaters whirled , like peg - tops full of steam - engines . Was it likely that we , two girls of spirit , would halt ignobly there ? First on the ice went I , holding Isola 's hand , and tempting her nothing loth . In spite of her boast about skating , Idols was frightened at first , and held very tightly by me , and wanted to run back . But the little feet grew braver at every step , and she ventured even to clap her hands and dance . To me the thing was no novelty , except from the number of people , and the puckering of the ice . I had even the courage to slide with one foot , but never with both at a time . As for the cracking and bending when some heavy man scoured by , on purpose , I dare say , to frighten us , I laughed with my heart in my mouth . Isola was amazed . She never could have conceived that I had so much effrontery . What cared I , if a hundred people stared at me ? I was doing nothing unseemly , and dozens of ladies were there . The scene , and the air , and the spirits of youth set my blood all on the bound , and oh , blessing of blessings , my blessed sight was come back . How manly , and stirring , to feel , that a slip — and a limb may be broken ; a crack — and one may be drowned . But , as usual , I suffered for my temerity . First we followed Giudice , and found him in the centre of the ring , where the greatest throng was gathered , the dog skating with his master , who was one of the very best skaters in the world . Giudice was graver than ever , but wistfully glanced as he whirled round , at every point of escape . With his heavy fore feet on his master 's shoulders , and his tongue lolling out , and his eyes rolling sadly at each reluctant caper , and his poor tail between his jerked legs , it was impossible not to see that his dignity and self - respect were suffering . So when Conrad came to speak to us , I earnestly begged that Giudice might be set free , which was done in a moment , to the great disappointment of the bystanders , and the boundless delight of the dog , who came and gratefully kissed my hand . "
92511	92519	92509	92509	Donna	476	" cried Isola in a small pet , "
92543	92822	92536	92536	I	0	" Through , the colour the north wind had spread on my cheeks , I felt the warm blood rushing , and bent over the dog to hide it ; then much as I longed to see Isola 's brother skate , I dragged her off rather rudely towards the rougher part of the ice . Conrad looked rather surprised and hurt , but resumed his figuring with much apparent philosophy . Idols and I , with the flush in our cheeks , and the flash in our eyes , and our forms all buoyant with innocent fun , came suddenly round a corner on a party of low - looking men , who were casting flat stones , bowling , or curling , or playing at drake , with a great tin can for their mark . We turned and were off in a moment ; but we had been observed by the sharpest and slyest eyes in London . A man gave chase in half - skating fashion , having bones tied under his boots , in lieu of skates . We could easily have escaped , in spite of his bones ; but was I going to run away , like a skittish servant - maid ? I drew up Miss Isola sharply , whether she would or no , and confronted the enemy . It was Mr. Shelfer himself , the man so modest and bashful , who could never bear to look at me . Though a dozen more came after him , I felt no alarm at all , knowing his wonderful shyness and diffidence . But his first address amazed me . "
92845	92989	92990	92990	Clara	293	" The low scoundrel ! I saw that he was quite tipsy . But frightened as I was , for none but they were near , I could hardly help laughing at him . He had his usual slouch , and the long sly nose , and the pent - house gleam of the eye , and his gaunt cheeks drawn as if he was always sucking them , and the chimneypot hat , that had once belonged to some steady going Churchman , with the crown flapping in , like the gills of a fish . All this was balanced by the skill and comical courage of Bacchus , upon a pair of grating marrow - bones . Behind him his countless pockets yawned and looked brown on the wind . And this was the being bowed down to by Mrs. Shelfer ! "
92997	93038	92995	92995	Clara	293	" the impudent sot cried out . I had stopped without that , and was already facing him . For a moment he was abashed , for my eyes were full upon his ; but the others were coming up . "
93244	93252	93254	93254	his	0	" The low rogue had a long pipe "
93255	93271	93274	93275	a tanner	2542	head,"—as Farmer Huxtable expressed it,—and at every leering sentence blew out a puff of smoke . "
93288	93298	93279	93279	you	482	" cried his friend , as drunk as himself . "
93306	93914	93279	93279	you	482	" and the niddering made a dash at me . I drew my clenched hand from my muff , where it had been tingling in my glove , and in his tipsy rush , his face came full against it . It was a very odd thing , and I know not how it happened . He reeled on his bones from the collision , and staggered in staring amazement . Before he had time to recover , Conrad dashed up like a hawk at an owl ; by some wonderful back - stroke he stopped in an instant , wrung Shelfer 's crooked stick from his hand , hooked him under the collar , struck out again , and towed the poor wretch away backward , at the speed of a mile in a minute . The fire flew from his skates as he dashed towards the open water . Giudice , at full gallop behind , tried in vain to keep up . Every man and woman there turned to watch the issue . Shelfer threw out his hands wildly , and screamed : he was utterly helpless , his teeth rattled more than the bones on his boots . At the edge of the open water , three hundred yards away , Conrad stopped suddenly , like an engine in collision , unhooked Mr. Shelfer , and let him go with full impetus . Sprawling and yelling in vain , he flung up his arms , and fell backward into the water headlong . The icemen came running with boats , and ropes , and grapnels . But before the first splash was over , another was seen ; Giudice , at a sign from his master , plunged in , drew the poor man of harmony out , and laid him high and wet on the ice . He was taken at once to the tent ; where , as I afterwards heard , he made a fine afternoon of it with the society 's men ; most of whom , it is needless to say , he knew . Be that as it may , the lesson did him good . He never insulted a lady again , or ( what is still worse ) a poor honest girl , with no education , and no one to defend her . As for me , I really believe he never durst blink his sly eyes in my direction again . I love good justice , in or out of the pod . The bean is as sweet to me from the rough air of heaven as from a juryman 's pocket . But I thought Master Conrad had overdone it this time . He had no right to risk the poor man 's life . And so I told him when he came back , as calm as if he had cut a spread eagle . He assured me that he had not risked the man 's life at all . He knew the depth of the water there by the island . It was five feet and no more . Then I felt all of a glow and longed to give him the kiss which had cost Mr. Shelfer so much . The next minute I felt humiliated , and burst into a passion of tears , to think what my father would say at his pet of grace and luxury being insulted like that . Idols and Conrad , not knowing my story , could not understand it at all . They came home with me at once . Conrad , "
93919	94098	93279	93279	you	482	" ventured to offer his arm , which I , under the circumstances , ventured to accept . At the door he left me ; but Idols came in with Giudice , commissioned to see her safe home . She came in partly lest I should feel lonely , partly to arraign Mrs. Shelfer ( already condemned by both of us girls ) for daring to have such a reprobate drunken husband . When Isola had told Mrs. Shelfer everything , and a little more than everything ( for her imagination was lively ) , the dominant feeling in the little woman 's bosom was not indignation , as we had expected , but terror . Terror of two evils ; the first and chief evil , the possibility of Charley catching cold ; the other , the probability that he would crush Conrad , and tread him into the earth , at the earliest opportunity . I assured her warmly that Mr. Conrad could well defend himself , even if Shelfer should dare to meddle with him . "

95300	95316	95296	95297	Miss Idols	466	" And she turned to Isola , who was quite ready to be turned to . "
95452	95535	95429	95429	he	413	" The pure good faith of this last was too much for me . I laughed outright , having no husband concerned in it . As for the dry little woman , she actually cried . I had never seen a tear in her quick , shy eyes before , though the feather - bed nearly brought them , and so did the death of the elder Sandy , the squirrel . She turned away . She was always ashamed of emotion . "
95577	95634	95568	95568	you	391	" Is there any goodness more touching to a veteran than a soft young nature 's disbelief in evil ? But for bitter experience , I might have been sweet as Isola . Thank God , that in spite of all vinegar , the ailment is still infectious . Isola could not make it all out . "
95643	95649	95640	95641	Miss Valence	423	" began Mrs. Shelfer again , "

95807	95918	95798	95798	she	428	" Hereon I sat down with a womanly air . But I could hardly help laughing when the senior sophist jumped up , proud to deliver judgment . To look taller , she shook her flounces down , threw back her plump white shoulders — her bonnet and cloak were off — drew her rich flowing hair down the pearly curve of her ears and , scarcely satisfied yet , thought of mounting a stool , then took her foot off the too convictive bema . After all these anabolisms , she began with much solemnity . She was thinking of the College , and her father in the rostrum . "

96100	96330	96096	96098	my good friend	1798	" So this knotty point was settled ; and Giudice , who was very loth to leave me , escorted Miss Idols home , Before going , he made another solemn deposit of his great jowl in my hand , and looked at me with an air so tutelary and encouraging , that I could not help laughing ; at which he felt hurt , but condoned it . Isola told me that when he was put in charge of her , he felt the responsibility so strongly that he would not stir from her side , not even to speak to the most colloquially gifted dog ; though at other times he would stay gossiping near a lamp - post for five minutes together . One evening when he was thus commissioned , a rude fellow pushed between them , and said something to Isola . Giudice had him down in an instant , and stood over him , like a tawny thundercloud , with growlings so fearful and such flashing eyes , that two policemen felt it wiser not to act as conductors . Idols herself was obliged , at the entreaty of her prostrate foe , to coax the great dog off ; but when the ungrateful man got up , he insisted on giving Giudice into charge , and having him dragged to the Station . "
96336	96341	96096	96098	my good friend	1798	" said the policeman , "
96366	96368	96360	96361	the Gent	2603	" The "
96370	97181	97186	97187	little woman	2606	" was away in no time , and Giudice and his mistress walked off amid loud hurrahs from all the boys of the neighbourhood . Conrad called with his sister the day after Mr. Shelfer 's ducking , to reassure himself as to my nerves , which were never better . He looked over some of my drawings , and without seeming to give , but rather to seek information , afforded me many a hint , which I afterwards found most useful . I now learned what his profession was ; and it gave me pleasure to find that he was not , as I had feared , a mere lounger upon town . Instead of that , he was working very hard , being ( as he told me ) nothing more or less than a journeyman sculptor . Though , as himself admitted , by no means a novice , he was going through the regular course of study and hand - labour under an eminent artist . But Isola told me , and no doubt it was true , that he could beat his master out and out , and that for any choice design , where original power and taste were needed , they always came to him . Of late the frosts had lightened his tasks ; for warm the room as they would , the weather always affected the material ; and they feared to attempt the more delicate parts of the work during the rigours of winter . So when the thaw came , he must lose the pleasure of seeing me for a while , unless dear Isola wished to be escorted home on a Sunday ; if , indeed , I allowed her to come on that day . Why , that was the very day when I could best indulge in a walk with my gentle friend , after going to church ; and I was sure her society did me more good than the sermons . On her part , Isola found that the services always made her so nervous ( her nerves were as good as mine ) , and that she did not much like walking about with a big dog on Sundays , and Cora was always cross all the day after mass , so Conrad must promise upon his honour always to come for her , rain , hail , or shine , on a Sunday . This he promised so readily , that , for a moment , I fancied it had all been preconcerted . Then I despised myself for the suspicion . The trick would have been not out of the compass of Isola , but very unworthy of Conrad . Soon as ever my sight was fully restored , and I had Dr. Frank 's permission , I took to my drawing again , and worked at it till my eyes ached . This was the symptom upon which I had promised immediately to leave off . Then out I would rush , towards dusk , and away into the great square , full of the pure air of heaven , round by the church at the top , and six times round it till my breath was short . The senior sophist reminds me that round a square is impossible . After squaring the circle , extract the square root , dear Idols , by the binomial theorem . You do learn so much at college : but I write simple and often foolish English . Never mind ; I would rather write bad English , than the best French ever written . One is the tongue of power and multitude : the other the language of nicety and demarcation . Which of the two is the more expansive , even a woman may guess . High time it was for me to recruit my exchequer . Dr. Franks had charged me far less than I even dared to hope . How I trembled when I opened the envelope ! What quick terror is half so bad as the slow fear of gathering debt ? I was accustomed to medical charges of the time when I was an heiress : but his appeared to me now to be even below reason . The sum could hardly have paid him for his numerous walks to and fro . Then a wretched idea shot through me : had he charged me so little , because he knew I was poor ? I took Mrs. Shelfer into my confidence ; she was likely to know what the London scale should be . The little thing soon reassured me : it was quite enough , she declared ; if she were in my place , she would demand a discount for ready money ! "
97203	97848	97189	97189	I	0	" However , in spite of all this , money was scarce and scarcer every day , and none of my grand revenues would fall due for ever so long . So another visit must be paid to Mr. Oxgall . Isola insisted on coming with me ; to my surprise I found that , with all her soft simplicity she had much more idea of making a market than I had . The reason probably was that she had much less pride . No pocket would hold mine , when a tradesman attempted any familiarity . And whoso stands on a pedestal to sell , is like to find the buyer 's arm too short . Whether it were that , or the golden charm of her manner , or of something else , let Mr. Oxgall say ; certain it is that the man of crackly canvas ( for whom , by - the - bye , I have a sincere respect , because he cheated me so little and so neatly)—this man , I say , regarded her with a wide - mouthed , brooch - eyed , admiration , which he hardly ever expended on anything out of oils . For the king of painters himself she was a vision sweeter than dreams of heaven . Such a tint in her lustrous eyes , such tone in her dainty cheeks , such perfection of line in her features , and every curve of her exquisite shape . And bounding and sparkling through all , from the rippled wealth of her hair to the light - curved arch of her foot , the full play of her innocent , joyous , loving life . No wonder the picture - dealer shaded his eyes and gazed , and rubbed them and gazed again . I have frequently seen respectable elderly gentlemen , whose rakishness has never been more than found vent in the cock of a hat , magisterial men I mean , who would no more think of insulting a girl in London or anywhere else , than of giving their daughters as prizes for competitive skill in poaching , such good men and true , also simple - hearted clergymen ( for some there still are from the country ) these and the like , I Clara Vaughan have seen , when they met my Isola , stop short , wink frequently , and without much presence of mind , until she was gone by ; then shumble hotly across the street , with hands in their tail - coat pockets ( for these gentlemen always expect most to be robbed when there is least chance of it ) pretend to look at a shop , then march at top speed , fumbling all the while for their spectacles , until they got well a - head of us . Then I have seen them cross again , some thirty yards in front , with spectacles nicely adjusted , and become again wholly absorbed by the beauty of metropolitan goods . But when the light foot sounded , from a fair gazing distance , these same gentlemen have ( by some strange coincidence ) alway turned full upon us , in an absent and yet nervous manner , and focussed their green or pale blue eyes upon the rich violet orbs of Isola . I have even known them to look at me ( when they could see her no more ) , to find some sympathy for their vague emotions . Idols knew it : of course she did . And she rather gloried in it . She had much respect for a fine old gentleman ; and I know not how it was , but nobody ever thought of insulting her when she could be clearly seen . A "
97851	97872	97189	97189	I	0	" you would never call her — though Mr. Shelfer did — the term would be quite unworthy ; even a "
97876	97897	97189	97189	I	0	" sweetly beautiful though she was , would hardly be your expression , at least for a while . But a "
97901	98256	97189	97189	I	0	" and the loveliest one ever seen , that is what she would be called at once , if you could take your eyes off , to analyse your ideas . Isola knew it of course , as I said before , she knew all her wondrous gifts ; but as for being conceited , a trull with a splay foot and a crop of short - horn carrots has often thrice her conceit . A certain pretty graceful pride she had , which threw a rosy playful halo round her , but never made other women look plain in her eyes . She will not value her beauty much , until she falls in love ; and blessed is he who shall be the object , if she is allowed to abide with him . Meanwhile Mr. Oxgall wished for nothing but to hear and see her talk ; and this she did to some purpose . I like a man who at the age of sixty is still impressible to the gay vein of youth . I know at once by his eyes whether his admiration is abstract and admissible . If it be , I reciprocate it . What clearer proof can we find , that his heart has not withered with his body ; that he is not a man of mammon , tinsel , or phylactery,—in a word , no mummy ? Shall I ever finish this bargain ? I have never been so reflective before ; and all the time no less a sum than five pounds hangs upon it . Five guineas ( which sounds better ) was the amount at which dear Idols let off Mr. Oxgall . I believe she might have got ten , but she had an excellent conscience . It worked like a patent chronometer , with compensation balance . Mine was still more sensitive . I could hardly think my landscape , perspective mare 's nest and all , worth that amount of money , and I wished to throw off a guinea , but Idols would not hear of it . "
98310	98972	98973	98974	Mr. Oxgall	422	" Betwixt her beauty and my stately integrity , poor Mr. Oxgall knew not where he stood . I heard him mutter that he would rather go through fifty auctions , even if it was George Robins . But if she had come to sell him a picture the very next day , he would have gone through it all again with the same infatuation . So I took the money ; and now my evil demon , who had chafed beneath all this trampling , had his turn again . We had foolishly brought the great dog Giudice , for our delight and the expansion of his mind . In Mr. Oxgall 's shop he behaved to admiration . With the air of a connoisseur he walked from picture to picture , closed one eye , and faintly wagged his tail . Then he found a Scotch terrier scarcely worth a sniff , and a mastiff whom he saluted with a contemptuous growl . The only work of high art he could discover was an interior , with a flitch of bacon in the foreground uncommonly well drawn . Before this he sat down , and receiving no invitation , bedewed the boards with a stalactite from either side of his mouth . The dog was so well behaved , he never took anything without leave and saying t a long grace . Unluckily Mr. Oxgall , mainly I believe to prolong his interview with Idols , insisted upon taking us to the shop of a carver and gilder close by ; where my first drawing ( which had been sold ) was to be seen in its frame . He declared that we could not tell what a painting was like , until we had seen it framed . Observing several large mirrors in this shop , I begged that Giudice might be left outside . And so he was , but he did not stay there . Scarcely had we begun to discuss the effect of the frame on my drawing , when Giudice pushed his way in , and looked about with a truly judicial air . The shop was long , and the owner was with us at the further end . I saw what would follow , and dashed off to stop him , but it was too late . Giudice had seen the very finest dog he ever beheld in his life — a dog really worth fighting . Up went his crest and his tail , one savage growl , and he sprang at him . Crash,—and the largest mirror there was a wreck , and Giudice the rock beneath it . For a time he lay quite stunned ; then to my great delight he staggered to me , not Isola , laid his cut paws in my hands and his bleeding nose in my lap , and explained it all to me with much entreaty for sympathy . This I gave him readily , even to tears and kisses . Isola wanted to scold and even to beat him , but I would not hear of it . He had seen another great dog between himself and us , how could he help attacking him ? I ordered a sponge and some water at once , and bathed his fore paws , which were terribly cut ; then remembering the Inspector , I sent Idols for some arnica . But the blood was not stanched by it as I expected ; perhaps the drug was not pure , or the hair obstructed its action . So I held his paws in the basin , and he whinged , and licked me , and made my face all bloody . Meanwhile the poor carver and gilder thought much more of his looking - glass than of noble flesh and blood . The picture - dealer as well was in a great predicament . "
98976	98988	98973	98974	Mr. Oxgall	422	" I cried , still sponging the wounded dog 's nose , "
99059	99166	99052	99052	you	422	" The delicious dog was entirely of my opinion . His beautiful eyes were unhurt . His nose tasted wholesomely salt . But Isola was not half so romantic . Little she cared about money for herself ; yet she had no idea of seeing a friend disburse . Empowered by nature to wind all men round her finger , she now called art to her aid , and Mr. Oxgall , who was half - way round already , had no chance of escape . She settled it thus : the carver and gilder , in consideration of his dealings with Mr. Oxgall and his own "
99169	99755	99052	99052	you	422	" of the mirror , should accept cost price for the article . That amount should be paid in equal shares by all three of us : by Mr. Oxgall because he would drag us thither , by herself as the mistress of the dog , and by me as the cause of the expedition . She had attended a course of lectures upon jurisprudence , and her decision was better than that of a judge , because she had seen the whole of it , and because the dog was hers — at least her brother 's , which was all the same . As for the owner of the mirror , he must think himself wonderfully lucky in having met with such honest people , and in having sold his glass , and had n't he got all the pieces , and she must have the largest one for Judy to dress his hair by . And so indeed she did . After our dear Portia had finished , and the whole thing was settled , it struck me that no lectures upon jurisprudence could turn wrong into right . Mr. Oxgall was quite blameless , so was I , so was Idols , except in bringing unlucky Giudice with her , which , from the outset , I had discouraged . She , as the temporary owner of the dog , should have borne all the loss ; and so she would have done gladly , only she did not see it in that light . As it was , she tried afterwards to force upon me her last three guineas ( that being the sum which I had paid , as my third of the whole ) , but of course I would not accept them . She had no money with her , so I paid her contribution , but allowed her to repay me . Mr. Oxgall 's third I made good to him ( without consulting her ) when he paid me for my next drawing . So I had earned five guineas , and lost six . Is it always to be so when I labour to make a little money ? At my earnest entreaty — Idols could refuse me nothing , when I was in earnest — darling Giudice was brought home in a cab to my lodgings . I knew that he would not be cared for at the stables where he was boarded ; and his wounds were very serious . As for home , Professor Ross , who detested dogs in general , would not admit him into the house . He even thought it a great stretch of grace to allow old Cora to watch the dog back to the stables , after he had been patrolling all the afternoon with his mistress . How I hate such low ingratitude ! An animal is to serve us , body and soul , to crouch and fawn for our notice — not that Giudice ever fawned to him , but growled awfully — and we are to think it well off with a curse or a kick , which we durst not give it but for its loyalty to us . What pleasure I had in nursing that poor Giudice , and how grateful he was ! When we got home , I washed his wounds again , with warm water this time , as the bleeding was stanched ; and then I "
99757	99771	99884	99884	you	428	" ( as the doctors absurdly say ) a little friar 's balsam . "
99779	99786	99884	99884	you	428	" Giudice exclaimed with his eyes , "
99806	99879	99797	99797	you	2609	" Neither did I. Then a nice soft bandage over his lovely paws , and a plaister across his nose , and he lies snugly , at the proper distance from the fire , as proud as possible of being nursed , and with an interesting air of pallid refinement on his features . He will hardly notice Idols , but exclaims , at length , with the petulance of an invalid , "
99902	101036	99897	99897	her	293	" So he followed me all round the room with his eyes , and begged me to come and talk to him , which I would not do , because he needed quiet and composure . Beloved Giudice remained many days under my care , until he became convinced that he was my dog absolutely , and had no claim on any other human being . He more than paid for his board and medical attendance , by sitting repeatedly for his portrait ; in which at last I succeeded to his and my own satisfaction . Though by no means a conceited dog , there was nothing he loved better than having his likeness taken ; and directly after breakfast he always assumed the most becoming attitude , and watched intently for the appearance of the pencil with his massive head a little on one side , and his dark brown eyes full of dignified interest , and his great ears curving down through russet tufts , like tawny cascades in autumn , he seemed fit study for a real artist , who should quicken as well as copy him . However , he was too much of a gentleman to sneer at my weak efforts , for he saw that I did my best . Oftentimes he would gaze steadfastly at the portrait and then at me , and hobble up , and nudge me , and whine , a little , and then sigh in self - abasement at his want of speech . Whenever he did this , I knew that he wished to have something altered ; but it was long before I could discover what that something was . I tried every change of line or colour that I could think of — all to no purpose . At length it struck me that as he criticised more with nose than eyes , the defect must be in the smell . Happy idea ! I satisfied my Giudice at last , and did it thus . After shading around the nose and mouth , before laying on the colour , I took a clean dry brush , and passed it lightly round the hollows of his own sweet saltish nostrils , carefully avoiding the cut ; then one turn of the brush , not on the palette , but on a dry square of colour , and with that I expressed the dear dog 's nose so well , that he would have spoiled it in a sniffing ecstasy , if I had not pulled it away . His portrait now possessed the life which he required . Meanwhile I received almost daily visits from Isola and her brother ; the latter was , of course , very anxious about his poor dog , and could only relieve that anxiety by long interviews with him . It happened strangely enough , yet more and more often as time went on , that Isola during these interviews felt an especial desire for Mrs. Shelfer 's society , which she could only enjoy by betaking herself to the kitchen . There , with all the pets , except old Tom , who was constancy itself , and the lame blackbird who was all gratitude , her influence began to supersede mine , and even Mrs. Shelfer 's ; for this I cared but little , so long as Giudice kept to me . Over that great dog , as he turned upon his side , and lifted one hind leg ( the canine mode of showing submission to the will of God ) , over him we bent , Conrad and I , in most interesting diagnosis , until it seemed the proper thing that our hair should flow together , and our breath make one soft breeze . From this position we would rise with a conscious colour in our cheeks , and a flutter at the heart , and a certain awe of one another . Then it would be ever so long before either of us dared to seek the other 's eyes . Haply when those eyes were met — unwitting yet inevitably — they would drop , or turn away , or find some new attraction in the dog or clouds . Then some weak remark would follow , for which the hearer cared no whit , yet feigned deep interest therein . Why labour thus to cheat ourselves — each other we can not cheat — why feel we so confused and guilty , why long so heartily to be a hundred leagues away , yet knowing thoroughly that , if it were so , all the space between were void and heartache ? The reason neither we nor other mortal knows ; the cause is this , that we love one another . I have felt that it must be so , at least on my part , ever since the day he came with Isola , and knew me not , though I knew him so well . Does he know me now as the Clara Vaughan whom he once avoided ? These eyelashes are as long and dark as ever ; the large eyes , shaded by them , are as deep a gray as twilight in a grove of willows . My cheeks have regained their curve , my hair was never injured ; let me hie to the glass now he is gone , and see if I be like myself , and whether I have face and form likely to win Conrad 's love . No , I am not like myself . No wonder he does not know me . The gloom habitual to my face is gone . It is the difference betwixt a cavern well and a sunny fountain . I see a laughing graceful girl , with high birth marked in every vein , and self - respect in every motion ; her clear cheeks glowing with soft wonder , her red lips parted with delight , her arching neck and shoulder curve gleaming through a night of tresses , her forehead calm and thoughtful still , half - belying the bright eyes where love and pleasure sparkle . For a moment self - approval heightens the expression . At my silly self my foolish self is smiling ; but the smile has warmer source than maiden 's light conceit . I smile because I see that , as regards exterior , he who slights me must be hard to please ; and some one , whom I think of , is not hard to please . Straight upon the thought of him — Ah well . My father used to quote from the "
101040	101068	99897	99897	her	293	" a beautiful verse , which neither he nor any other could in English render duly , [ Greek : Aidoûs hyròn éreuphos apostazousa prosôpou.]—v . 173 . "
101080	101124	99897	99897	her	293	" But when Conrad should have learned who it was that nursed his dog , would he feel the tender gratitude and delight which he now displayed so freely ? Would he say , as in his fervour he now said every day , "
101141	101148	101149	101150	Miss Vaughan	293	" Would he not rather say , "
101164	101657	101159	101159	Giudice	475	" A whistle and the last sound of the foot , for which I listened now by the hour . This thought was continually with me . It poisoned half the flavour and ruined all the digestion of my happy moments . But what could I do ? How unmaidenly , how presumptuous of me to imagine that he was likely to break his heart for me ! And if he did — why then he should break my own as well . I am not one of the drawing - room young ladies , who receive a modified proposal every Sunday afternoon , and think much more about the sermon afterwards . I can not play with the daffodils upon the brink of love , sleepily thrusting my admirers in , and lounging with half - open breast , which neither love - knots may secure , nor fluttering sighs unzone . No , here I am , such as I am , such as God has made me . No usury , no auction for my heart : once for all I give it , and my life goes with it . So it must always be with a girl of any feeling , who has trained her own existence . But for my wild ignorance , I would dare to say — so it must be always with a girl of feeling , twist and warp her as you will . Yet I am told , by those who know the world , that it is not so with nine girls out of ten among the lady caste . If , beneath the roc of fashion , they prefer the diamond to the meat , let them have it , and starve thereon . The choice is of their own young crops . No parent bird can force the bauble down . But what have I to do with this ? All I know is that neither I , nor any child of mine , will or shall be gulleted thus for life . After every little burst of thought , every feeble sally of imagination , came ( as always is the case with me ) came the slow pusillanimous reaction . All that I had any right to do was to paint , earn money , and be off for Italy . Little as I knew about the expense of travelling , I felt sure that it would be vain to start with less than a hundred pounds . Enormous sum ! How could I ever hope to win it , though I painted day and night , and lived on bread and water . To this diet , or what in London is quite synonymous , bread and milk , I had already reduced myself , in my stern resolve to lay by two pounds every week . Farewell to meat , so soon as my Devonshire "
101659	101686	101159	101159	Giudice	475	" was gone , and farewell to what I cared much more about , a glass of good London stout . I suppose there is something horribly "
101688	101701	101159	101159	Giudice	475	" in my tastes , for I will confess that the liquid called "
101704	101743	101159	101159	Giudice	475	" by Mr. Dawe had much charm for me . However , I abjured it with all other luxuries , and throve no whit the worse . The kindly little woman , whose summum bonum ( next to her "
101745	101765	101159	101159	Giudice	475	" ) was plenty of good fare , took it much to heart that I should live so plainly . "
101997	101998	101992	101992	I	0	" "
102012	102382	102006	102006	you	391	" In her excitement , she slipped from the edge of the chair , whereon she always balanced herself when I made her sit down . She thought it disrespectful to occupy too much room , and cuddled herself in the smallest compass possible . Let no ill be thought of Giudice . Who thinks ill of me I care not , for I can defend myself , if it be worth while . So can Giudice with his teeth — the finest set in London — but he has no tongue , no merop tongue , I mean . It was true that Giudice had good fare , and thoroughly he enjoyed it . That dog knew a juicy bit of meat , short of staple , crisp , yet melting , quite as well as I did . True , he had a love of bones , transparent gristle , and white fibres , which I , from inferior structure , can not quite appreciate . Yet all this was no part of his mind , much less did it affect the greatness of his soul . He kept , as all of us do who are good for anything , a certain alter ego , a higher voice , a purer sense , a vein which fashion can not leech , or false shame tourniquet . So the good dog used to come to me , before he touched his breakfast , lunch , or dinner , and entreat me to devour all I could , there would be lots still left for him . In my hurry to get start of time , to spin a little faster the revolving moons , I did a thing which I could ill - approve to myself , even at the moment . I wrote to Sally Huxtable to obtain Mr. Dawe 's permission for me to sell my gordit . Professor Ross had offered me no less than ten guineas for it . As a gentleman he should not have made the offer , after what I had told him . But the love of science — falsely so called by collectors — drives men to discern propriety "
102393	102661	102006	102006	you	391	" However , I was not quite so blind upon right and wrong , as to mean to keep all the money . I offered Mr. Dawe half , if the plaything should be sold . I knew not why , but I could not bear the idea of a bargain and sale with Conrad 's father , wide apart as the two always were in my mind . I rather hoped that Beany Dawe , though sorely tempted , would refuse . And now the time was almost come for news from Tossil 's Barton . Dear Sally must have filled the twelve copybooks , at the rate of one a week . Ere I quite expected it , the letter came ; but before its tidings are imparted , I must in few words describe the visit of Inspector Cutting 's son . George Cutting came one evening to see his good Aunt Patty , for so he called Mrs. Shelfer , who was in truth his cousin . Though I had been so assured that my enemy could not escape , I was not equally convinced , and at times a deep anxiety and despair possessed me . Therefore I went to the kitchen to see the Inspector 's son , and requested Mrs. Shelfer to allow me five minutes of conversation with him . He stood all the while , and seemed rather shy and confused . He had not heard from his father , since the ship sailed ; but he had seen in the papers that she had been spoken somewhere . "
102668	102866	102665	102665	I	0	" was still safe in London — my blood ran like lava at the thought — or I should have heard of it . He , George Cutting , had his eye upon him , and so had two of the detective force ; but what were they in comparison with his father ? This he asked , despite his shyness , with so large a contempt , that I began to think the Cutting family admired the Cuttings only . Upon me , who am no Cutting , he left the simple impression that the qualities , so lauded by his father , lay as yet beneath a bushel . However , his Aunt Patty declared that he could eat three times as much as Charley . Not unlikely , if he only drank one - third of Charley 's allowance . Mrs. Shelfer , who knew that I was laying by a fixed sum every week , began to look upon me as a fine young miser . Of course she quite fell in with what she supposed to be my ideas , for she never contradicted any one , unless it was a cabman . "

She had never known real illness , and even a stitch or a spasm would frighten her for days . When I spoke calmly , as I sometimes did , of our great inevitable friend , whom we so labour to estrange , up would jump Mrs. Shelfer with a shudder and a little scream . "

103764	103823	103755	103755	Tom	295	" Ah , poor little thing ! But I am not going to moralise . Shall I ever know the history of that marrow bone ? Tossil 's Barton , estimating the British Post by the standard of Joe Queen 's boy , placed but little confidence in that institution . Moreover , Tossil 's Barton held that a "
103827	103852	103755	103755	Tom	295	" as it termed a letter , was certain to be lost for want of size , unless it were secured in something large , "
103864	104347	103755	103755	Tom	295	" as the farmer himself expressed it . Therefore I was not surprised at receiving , instead of a letter by post , a packet delivered by the parcels van . This packet was bound round like the handle of a whip . and stuck at either end with a mass of cobbler 's wax . bearing the vivid impress of a mighty thumb . Within the wrappings first appeared an ominous crumpled scroll . Ye stars , where angels so buffooned by eminent painters dwell ! Once more I behold Eli on the turnpike gate , the Great Western steamer , Job with a potsherd of willow - pattern plate , the Prodigal Son , and worse than all , that hideous Death and the Lady . Recklessly I tumble out all the rest of the packet . Three great bolts with silver clasps , three apostle spoons , two old silver salt - cellars marked W.H.J.H. , a child 's christening cup , a horn tobacco - stopper with a silver tip , an agate from the beach , a tortoise - shell knife with a silver blade , half a dozen coins and a bronze fibula found upon the farm , an infant 's coral , a neck - pin garnished with a Bristol diamond , a number of mother - of - pearl buttons and blue beads , and a mass of mock jewelry bought by the farmer from the Cheapjacks at Barum fair with the produce of his wrestling triumphs . Separate from the rest , and packed most carefully , were all but two of the trinkets I had sent as Christmas gifts for the family . Touched to the heart by all this loving kindness , I felt so ashamed of my paltry petulance at Eli , Jonah , and the rest , that I would not indulge in a peep at Sally 's letter , which came last of all , until I had starved myself for a day . That literary effort showed so much improvement , both in writing and in spelling , that any critic would have endorsed Mr. Huxtable 's conclusion that the gift must be in the family . A few words still there were of rather doubtful texture , but who can bind or bound the caprice and luxury of the English language ? Moreover , Sally 's stops were left once more to the discretion of the reader . But if Lord Byron could not grasp the mysteries of punctuation , how could Sally Huxtable ? Yet that eager little maid would have learned in half an hour the art which might have mellowed the self - tormentor 's howling . Sally 's was a healthy , sweet , and wholesome nature . Tossil 's Barton Farm , Trentisoe . The tenth day of March A.D. 1851 . "

107451	108218	107448	107449	SALLY HUXTABLE	371	" From Sally 's eager description of the coat and buttons , I concluded easily that a servant from Vaughan St. Mary had been sent in quest of me . My father hated showy liveries and loathed hair - powder , but Mr. Edgar Vaughan returned to the family usages , or rather allowed them to re - establish themselves ; for on such questions he was wholly indifferent . Now what could be his motive for sending so expressly to discover me ? I knew not , neither cared very greatly , but wrote at once to Tossil 's Barton , first to return their loving contribution , which consisted mainly of ancestral relics prized for generations , secondly , to set free the secret of my address . Into my own self I returned once more . Somehow I seem to expand whenever I come in contact with the yeoman 's family , and their lowly greatness . I am like a worm when it rains , after the drought of summer . Surely the God , who leaves us to stifle ourselves with the dust of fashion and convention , has His own gracious times to breathe upon and scatter it . At intervals we may see through the reek of our own exuding , and inhale a more bracing air than sleeps in mausoleums . But instead of being exalted and fed by the open breeze , we shudder at the draught and replace our respirators . I returned into myself , and found little comfort there . I do not live inside myself , as most people live in theirs . True , I am apt to resent any slight to it offered from the outside . True , I seek its keep and comfort in a mechanical sort of way . But as for crusting in its bottle , ripening in its husk , rusting in its watch - case , I have been too long the toy of wind and weather not to be turned inside out . Never can I moulder into the fungoid nucleus the British taste admires . And yet there is about me , if I must not say within me , a stanch cleaving , a cohesion , a concrete will , which is of genuine Anglo - Saxon fibre . So I thrust aside all dreams of Tossil 's Barton and Vaughan Park , and certain wilder sweeter dreams which have begun to flutter and thrill through me , and in earnest I return to my task of money - making . Giudice still is faithful , and comforts much my solitude . He has never asked his master 's leave or mine , he has never received any formal invitation , yet here he looks all at home , sleek and unblushing , though long since quite convalescent and equal to livery stable diet . Once indeed , as we passed the entrance , he pretended to me that his conscience pricked him . To ease it , he sniffed about , and halted just for a moment , then turned his nose up , recocked his tail , and trotted jauntily on . Since then he has always avoided that left side of the street . He is affable still to Isola , but clearly regards her as no more than a pleasant acquaintance . Whenever she enters the room , he walks from his corner with a stretch and a yawn , sniffs all round her dress , to learn where she has been , and what dogs she has spoken to ; then , in the absence of any striking discovery , he looks into her face with a grave complacence , and brings me his conclusion . Tom , and the birds , the squirrel , and the little marmoset ( Mrs. Shelfer 's newest and dearest pet ) , he gazes upon from a lofty standing as so many specimens of natural history , interesting so far , but otherwise contemptible . He is now allowed free run of the house , understands all the locks , and presents himself in every room at the proper meal - time . Even the little dress - maker is then honoured with his attentions . Everybody loves him , he is so gentle and clever and true . Back he comes to me , with his mouth rather greasy I must admit , gives me one kiss ( as a form , I am afraid ) , and exclaiming , "
108445	108482	108439	108439	I	0	" Although , lest I profane your hallowed part , Queen Nature chills the blood around my heart ; Sweet dog , permit me to indulge my dream Of country valleys , and the mazy stream . "
108589	108593	108594	108594	she	428	" Oh Donna , "
108597	108670	108594	108594	she	428	" what nonsense you do talk ! Obliged to us indeed ! I am sure we are all greatly obliged to you ; and many a stir it saves us at home , for the dog detests papa so ; and when Conrad comes to see us , he ca n't bear to have Judy shut out like a thief , and he the most honourable dog that ever wagged a tail . "
108671	108694	108702	108702	his	2810	" To be sure he is . You know you are , do n't you , oh combination of Bayard and Aristides ? "
108713	108755	108702	108702	his	2810	" But I have said all along that Conny should pay for his board , and he feels it too : but we could not tell how to propose it to you , dear Donna , you are so very outrageous . "
108756	108763	108702	108702	his	2810	" I should hope so indeed . "
108764	108787	108792	108792	her	428	" And then I am sure it would break poor Judy 's heart to go . Would n't it now , Judy ? "
108828	108971	108821	108821	he	475	" You know I am only a dog . But you , Clara , happen to be a human being ; and so you know all we dogs know , and ever so much besides . Only you ca n't smell . You can talk , as fast as you like , both to each other and to us , but we can talk to none except our fellow dogs . Now do n't take a mean advantage of me . I know that I was made only to be your servant , and I love you with all my heart , that I do . I ca n't tell at all where I shall go when I die , or if I shall go anywhere ; and I am sure I shall die , if you cast me away like this . "

109018	109036	109013	109016	his master 's sister	2813	" I consider him now more my dog than Conny 's . You know he was given between us"—this
109044	109061	109013	109016	his master 's sister	2813	it—"and I only lent Conrad my half as long as he liked to pay for him . "
109446	109454	109456	109458	the senior sophist	6694	" And so now , Clara dear , "
109460	109510	109456	109458	the senior sophist	6694	" as Conrad has owned all the dog so long , it is my turn to own every bit of him for an equal period , and I must pay you half a crown a week for his keep , and half a guinea for doctoring him so well . "
109540	109544	109545	109545	she	428	" Oh Donna , "
109548	109579	109545	109545	she	428	" you have no idea how fond dear Conny is of you . I am getting so jealous . He thinks much more of you than he does of me . "
109611	109659	109665	109665	she	428	" Why do n't you answer me , Clara ? Did you ever know such a shame ? Well , I do believe you like being admired every bit as much as I do , in spite of all your sublimity . Why there comes Conny himself ; "
109671	109711	109665	109665	she	428	" I thought so . I knew the ring of his heel . He will wear such clumsy boots , though his foot is as pretty as mine . I always know his step , and so does Judy . "
109733	109742	109744	109745	his sister	2443	" I will go and open the door , "
109747	109762	109744	109745	his sister	2443	" how rude he is to come when you are so busy , Clara . "
110173	110177	110180	110180	he	427	" Miss Valence , "
110183	110203	110180	110180	he	427	" I am grieved in my heart by hearing that you were not treated at all politely last night . "
110310	110316	110317	110317	I	0	" Oh , Mr. Ross , "
110320	110348	110317	110317	I	0	" I think nothing at all of that . A learned man like your father can not be expected to bear with every ignorant girl 's curiosity . "
110349	110379	110386	110387	Master Conrad	427	" To a lady 's love of knowledge every gentleman should administer and be gratified . All men of lofty science enjoy to meet with a gentle mind inquiring . "
110562	110583	110552	110552	He	427	" I am made certain that I have seen you long ago . I will think , I will think . "
110631	110650	110651	110651	He	427	" You will forgive me , Miss Valence , you know that I would not use a freedom . "
110670	110689	110690	110690	I	0	" You will think me the weakest in mind and most wicked , but I am most unhappy . "
110717	110780	110651	110651	He	427	" It is to me a disgrace to come to you with my troubles . But I do it from no unmanly temper . I do it alone for the sake of my precious sister Isola . I have no longer any one whom I dare to love but her , and now I am compelled to abandon her at the last . "
110781	110790	110701	110701	him	427	" Do you mean to be long away ? "
110805	110984	110792	110792	I	0	" I shall not be away from London , but I shall be departed from Isola . The house where she lives I am no more to visit . A long time I have gone there only a little , and alone to see her . She is ordered now to come no more to me . This day I spoke very violently . But I will not detain you with that . I will confess I did wrong ; but I was richly provoked . My object in burdening you is double:—First to implore you , if I may without using liberty , to endure well with the Professor , lest she should be interdicted from coming to visit you , and then she would have no one remaining to love her . Second to ask , a thing that I hesitate because I can not narrate to you all things , whether you would indulge me , if there is no wrong , to come now and then to see my own and my only sister . "
110985	110998	111104	111104	he	2843	" Of course you do not mean without her father 's knowledge . "
110999	111098	111099	111099	His	2843	" I would never insult you , Miss Valence , by asking a thing like that . I desire nothing of what you call clandestine . You are so free and open , you would never have to do with any sort of concealment . Neither am I in the habit to do anything like that . It has only been commanded that I may not go there , or invite her to come to my house . The Professor has great power in the present , but he does not pretend to interdict me from my sister . "
111138	111200	111201	111201	He	2843	" Only one more thing I will entreat of you , Miss Valence ; poor Isola has never learned what means any grief . If she is vexed by this , I pray you to sustain and comfort her ; for I shall never make a wrong advantage of your most kind permission , so as to see her very often . "
111461	111480	111481	111481	She	428	" Oh my good friend , look here ! I was never so frightened in all my life . "

112756	112798	112719	112719	his	2894	" Likely , Jacob ? Yes , like enough to a fool ; but nohow creditable to the like of us . Think I do n't know now ? Perhaps the young ' ooman will answer a few questions , Jacob . "

113224	113242	113170	113170	he	2902	" I came by the train that ought to be there at half - past ten o'clock . "
113243	113287	113170	113170	he	2902	" Well to be sure ! That must be the very train as Samuel and Humphry said they waited for ; but they never has much judgment , them two men . And to let you come in a common fly , Miss ! "
113288	113324	113325	113326	Strange servants	2903	" I saw my father 's carriage at the station , and two low - looking servants quite tipsy . Their names , however , were not Samuel and Humphry , but Jacob and Robert . "

Why , you have quite a brilliant colour , and your eyes , and your hair — oh dear , how proud your sweet mother would have been ! You lovely creature , I must have a kiss ! What , not even your pretty hand ? "
113674	113710	113571	113571	she	1431	" No , Mrs. Daldy ; never more my hand to a person who dared to insult my father . Me you might have insulted a thousand times , and I would have forgiven you . "

114011	114046	114000	114000	she	2913	" Then if I must treat you , Miss Vaughan , but as a sister worldling , let us at least combine , for Providence has seen fit to make our interests the same . "

114144	114159	114119	114119	she	2913	" Then I will tell you something . Sit down by me , Clara . "

114756	114791	114793	114793	she	2929	" Yes , but it was true . At first they thought it was catalepsy only ; but when that passed off , paralysis remained . I wanted to send for you at once . "
114819	114879	114797	114797	she	2929	" However , I was over - ruled ; and your poor uncle lay bed - ridden , but in no actual danger , until this horrid low fever came . He must have a frame of iron to have borne up as he has . The doctor says this fever is partly from the prostration of the nerves . "

114898	114909	114887	114887	I	0	" A very eminent man . His name is Churchyard . "

114970	115002	114966	114966	she	2932	" it matters little where he comes from , and I have not verified his residence . I fear all the doctors in Europe could not save your poor dear uncle . "

115678	115757	115395	115395	she	409	" Quite hearty , Miss , all but the rheumatics . Ah , she do suffer terrible from them . Us both waited up , Miss , and I to and fro the door , till the carriage come home ; and then she went off to bed , and I was up with her , and never knowed when you come . But she 's getting up now , Miss , to come here to see you . "
115758	115800	115395	115395	she	409	" Go and stop her , at once . I will see her to - morrow . Stop , show me first your master 's room ; knock gently and bring out the nurse . The doctor is gone I believe . "
115801	115848	115395	115395	she	409	" Yes , Miss , he left here at eight o'clock , for he had a long way to drive , and he could n't do nothing more . But you must not go , Miss , oh pray , Miss , do n't go there ! "
116140	116147	116152	116152	she	7169	" Is he like this always ? "
116148	116151	116152	116152	she	7169	" No , "
116155	116194	116152	116152	she	7169	" but he has been so now for ten hours and more : generally he is taken with pain and thirst , every six hours ; and it makes my heart ache to hear him moan and cry . "
116195	116203	116204	116204	God	303	" Does he say anything particular then ? "
116242	116342	116347	116347	her	2963	" Yes , he opens his eyes and stares , and then he always says , and he tries to shake his head only he is n't strong enough , ' My fault , ah me , my fault , and to rob them too ! If I could but see her , if I could but see her , and die ! ' He always says that first , and then that exhausts him so , he can hardly say ' water ' after , and then he moans so melancholy , and then he goes off again . "
116374	116383	116357	116357	I	0	" Have you any medicine to give him ? "
116384	116439	116493	116493	she	2963	" No , Miss , no more ; he has taken a shopful already , though he can only swallow at the time he wakes up . The doctor said to - night he could do no more ; this awful black fever must end in mortification ; no medicine moves it at all . "
116440	116449	116493	116493	she	2963	" Did the doctor call it black fever ? "
116450	116491	116357	116357	I	0	" Yes , the very worst form of typhus of the real Irish type , such as they have had once or twice in Manchester . It has settled most on the stomach , but all the blood is poisoned . "
116512	116547	116493	116493	she	2963	" Excuse me , Miss , you would n't allow me , so I am bound not to ask you . You know you came in dead against my will , and dead against all orders"—this
116554	116578	116493	116493	she	2963	about—"and if anything happens to you , Miss Vaughan , who is to have all the property , but that bad Mrs. Daldy ? "
116663	116842	116649	116649	She	1232	" You see , Miss , we are forced to keep the three windows open , and the passage doors all closed . It 's a wonder I had any of the fluid left , for they never sent it up this afternoon ; but I had a drop put by , no thanks to them for the same . Mrs. Daldy brought the first nurse , but she ran clean away when the fever took the turn ; and they were forced to send for me , for nobody else would come near him . But my poor old man has no work , and I 've minded as bad a case as this , and they say I be fever - proof . But you , Miss , you ; I should never forgive myself , if anything happened to you , and in your youth and bloom . Though I could not stop you , you know I did my best . And they say you catch things most when you come off a journey . "
116843	116882	116639	116639	she	1232	" Jane , whatever happens , you are not to blame . I have no fear whatever ; and now I am here , I will stay . It is safer so , both for myself and others . "
116883	116949	116950	116950	She	2965	" Well , Miss , so I have heard say . Once in for it , keep to the air . But come into this little room , if you want to talk to me , Miss. We can hear the poor gentleman move , or even sigh ; and the air is a little fresher there . But we must keep the window open . "
117155	117164	117118	117119	my mother	746	" Jane , have they been brewing lately ? "
117176	117205	117170	117170	I	0	" Yes , Miss ; last Thursday and Friday . They wo n't let me go near the kitchen part : but I know it all the same . "
117206	117224	117225	117225	She	2971	" Go and get me a nice jug of fresh yeast . I will watch your master . "
117239	117334	117234	117234	I	0	" I do n't know where to find it , Miss ; and none of them will come near me ; and they 'll stop me too if they can . Why they wo n't bring my food to the door , but put it half - way down the passage . They wanted to lock me in , only I would n't stand that ; and they break all the plates and dishes , and to - day they sent word that my dinner must come in at the window to - morrow . "
117335	117384	117428	117428	her	347	" Low cowards and zanies ! Now find the yeast , Jane , if you have to search for an hour . They must all be gone to bed now , except Matilda Jenkins ; and she dare not stop you if you say you have my orders . "
117385	117402	117234	117234	I	0	" Bless you , Miss ; she 'll run away as if I was a ghost . "
117403	117419	117428	117428	her	347	" Then call to her , that I say she must go to bed directly . "

117692	117714	117715	117715	Broad	527	" She would hardly leave his bedside , until the fever declared itself . Since then she has not been once . "
117909	117954	117897	117897	he	2982	" No water , Jane , not a drop of water ! It will work far better alone . He does n't know what it is , and he thinks he has had his water . Keep him thirsty that he may take more . "

119251	119271	119272	119272	I	0	" Well , what is it ? Why ca n't you tell me ? Is everything here a secret ? "
119296	119365	119190	119190	I	0	" No , Miss , there 's no secret at all about that . Every one knows what that is . It 's only the scum that rises through the grass from the arched pool that takes all the drains of the house . Some of the arch fell in they say , and the ground shakes when they mow it ; they are afraid to roll there . "
119366	119388	119272	119272	I	0	" Is it possible ? And you knew it , a practised nurse like you ! Did my uncle know it ? "
119389	119437	119190	119190	I	0	" I am sure , Miss , I ca n't tell : most likely not , or he would have had it mended , he hates things out of repair . But it ca n't do any harm , with the mould and the grass above it . "
119438	119467	119468	119468	She	3014	" Ca n't it indeed ? And you can see it rise . Shut all the bedroom windows in a moment , Jane . I 'll shut this . "

119576	119622	119568	119568	he	470	" Now , Jane , throw all the doors open , and the lobby window that looks in the other direction . When do you think it will be possible to move our poor patient from these rooms ? The air here is deadly poison . "
119623	119661	119827	119827	her	7169	" Well I 'm sure , Miss ! And he could n't have a nicer nor a more airy room ; and all my things in order too , and so handy , and so many cupboards ! "
119662	119677	119827	119827	her	7169	" Out of this poison he must go . When can he be moved ? "
119678	119705	119568	119568	he	470	" Well , Miss , he might be moved to - morrow , if we could only get plenty of hands , and do it cleverly . "
119706	119738	119827	119827	her	7169	" Surely we can have plenty of hands . There used to be twenty - five servants here ; and I have not heard that my uncle has lessened the number . "
119739	119759	119827	119827	her	7169	" No , Miss ; but save and keep us , we sha n't get one of them here . "
119760	119819	119820	119821	The nurse	7169	" Nonsense ! I will have them , or they leave the house . Of course I wo n't peril their lives . We shall only want two or three ; and they may take a bath of disinfecting stuff , with all their clothes on , before they come ; and they may smoke all the while . "
119831	119871	119827	119827	her	7169	" And we will fumigate , Jane , fumigate tremendously . Surely Englishmen have more self - respect than to be such babies , and you a woman , and I a girl , shaming them out of face . "
119872	119901	119827	119827	her	7169	" It does n't matter , Miss ; they wo n't come . I know them well , the lot I mean that are in the house now . "
119902	119956	119827	119827	her	7169	" Very well , Jane , we 'll have Gamekeeper Hiatt , and his eldest son ; they are men I know . And if that is not enough , we 'll send to Gloucester for Thomas Henwood . But why do n't you open the lobby door , as I told you ? "
119957	119974	119827	119827	her	7169	" If you please , Miss , I ca n't . They have fastened it outside . "

120316	120562	120567	120567	God	303	" When I had read this , and perceived , by the blasphemy at the end , that it could proceed from no other than that awful woman , I confess that my spirit was cowed within me . Not from selfish fear , nor yet from the taming of passion , but from the lowering thought that I belonged to the same race of being as the author of such Satanity . Presently , I became too indignant to speak , or even think . It added , if that were possible , to my indignation , that I had seen her leave the house , about nine o'clock that morning , in our best close carriage . She kept the windows up until she was past the lawn and the light iron gates , beyond the arcade of roses ; then , at the first turn in the avenue , she let down the glass and gracefully kissed her hand to me . I did not believe , however , that she was gone back to Cheltenham . With so much at stake in our house , and depending on her direction , she would surely stop in the neighbourhood , if only to watch the course of events . Sooner than I dared to expect , I regained the command of myself ; horror within me was stronger than wrath , and stronger than either became the resolve to survive and win . "
120569	120578	120567	120567	God	303	" I exclaimed , in my presumptuous ignorance , "
120590	121093	120567	120567	God	303	" First I tried the door , which severed us from the rest of the house . My uncle 's rooms were in the western wing , very near those which my dear mother had occupied , and not very far from my own . They formed one floor of the western gable ; the three bedroom windows and that of the dressing - room looked to the west , while the great lobby window , from which I had seen Mrs. Daldy 's departure , looked southward along the avenue , the curve of which could be seen also from the bedroom windows . An oaken door , at the end of the main passage , cut off the rooms in this storey of the gable from all the rest of the house . This door Jane had left locked from the inside , fearing lest others should lock her in , as they had threatened to do . But now we found that a strong iron bolt had been fixed upon the outside , while we were asleep in the morning , and that we had no chance of forcing it . Next I asked Jane , whether she thought that the house , now Mrs. Daldy was gone , would be still in the hands of our enemies . Would not Mrs. Fletcher at once re - assert her authority ? Might not Matilda Jenkins be expected to fly to the rescue ? The nurse , knowing all the politics of the servants ' hall , assured me that there was no hope of either of these events . Robert , a drunken Wesleyan , turned out of the sect in Cheltenham , was Mrs. Daldy 's lieutenant , and would take all care of Matilda , to whose good graces he had been making overture . As for Mrs. Fletcher , she was probably in the same plight as ourselves . From what I heard about Robert , I began to believe that he had private orders to disown me at the station , for the double purpose of yielding a tit - bit of insolence , and warning of my arrival . However , that mattered very little ; but out of those rooms I must get , either by door or by window ; and that , too , without delay . Do they expect to triumph so easily over Clara Vaughan ? And in her father 's house ? The windows were about twenty feet from the ground , as nearly as I could guess , and the rooms beneath were empty . At once I resolved to attempt an escape that way , and to do so before the moon , which was southing now , should shine on the western aspect . Good Jane was terrified at the thought ; and then , upon my persisting , implored me to let her make the attempt , if it must be made at all . "
121134	121141	121131	121131	nobody	1116	" But I hoped somebody did . "
121165	121514	121131	121131	nobody	1116	" The little bed in the dressing - room , which she had to sleep on , was speedily brought to the window , and dropped just underneath it . It fell upon the grass with a pleasing and quiet flop . Then the two strong bell - ropes , already cut down and plaited together , were tied round the bars of the double window sashes , the lower sash being thrown up to the full extent , the glass pressed quietly out with a pair of wet towels , and the splinters removed , so as not to cut the rope . The latter still failed to reach more than half - way to the ground , but I would venture the drop if I could only descend so far . After winding a linen sheet around my body and dress , with the end tied round one ankle , so as to leave me free use of my limbs , I sat upon the window - sill in the broad shadow , and calculated my chances . Should I begin the descent with face , or with back , to the wall ? Face to the wall I resolved on , for though I should have to drop backward so , yet what I feared most of all was having the back of my head crushed against the house . Next to this I dreaded a sprain of the ankle , but all our family are well - knit and straight in the joint . So I launched myself off , beginning as gently as could be , Jane having firm hold of one hand , until I was well on the voyage . Though not well versed in calisthenic arts , I got on famously almost as far as the end of the rope , keeping away from the wall by the over - saling of the window - sill , and the rapid use of my feet . Then I rested a moment on a projecting ledge — called , I believe , a "
121517	121635	121131	121131	nobody	1116	course"—and away hand below hand again . But I struck my knuckles terribly against that stringing - course , and very nearly lost hold from the pain of the blow ; then bending my body forward I gave one good push at the wall , and shutting both eyes , I believe , let go the rope altogether . Backward I fell , and rolled over upon the feather bed . I was not even stunned , but feared for a moment to try if my limbs were sound . There I sat and stripped off the winding sheet . Presently , up I got , and , in my triumph , alas ! could not help crying "
121641	121759	121131	121131	nobody	1116	" like a foolish little child . In a moment I saw that my cry had been heard , where it should not have been . A rapid flitting of lights along the lower windows and in the stableyard , and I knew that chase would be given . But after leaving my father 's house in such a dignified manner , was it likely that I would give in and be caught ? Now , Clara , you could beat all your nurses in running , off and away like the wind ! Away I went full speed towards the shade of the avenue , while Jane had the wit to scream out of the window , "
121771	122445	122446	122446	Tulip	521	" This made some little diversion ; I had a capital start , and it was but half a mile to the lodge where old Whitehead lived . Once there , I should care for nobody . I must have escaped very easily , for my feet seemed as swift as a deer 's ; but , as my luck would have it , the light iron gates between the lawn and the park were fastened . What on earth should I do ? I saw men running across the lawn , and , what was worse , they saw me . In vain I pulled at the gates ; they rattled , but would not yield . Had I owned true presence of mind , I should have walked boldly up to the men , and dared them to touch me fresh from the fever - room . In the flurry of the moment I never thought of that , but darted into the shrubbery , and crouched among thick laurels . Presently I heard them rush down the main drive and begin the search , with some heavy swearing . Two of them came to the very clump I was hiding in , and pushed a pitchfork almost into my side , but the stupid fellows had lanterns , which blinded them to the moonlight . On they went with grumblings and growlings , which told me exactly where to shun them . Judging at length , from the silence , that the search had passed to the right , I slipped from my tangled lair , and glided away to the left , beyond the shrubbery spring , where a little gate , as I knew , led to a glade in the park . The deep ha - ha which I had feared to jump in the dark , because of the loose stones at the bottom , was here succeeded by a high oak paling , and probably through that gate had come the murderer of my father . With a cold shudder at the remembrance , I stole along through the shadowy places , and had almost reached the little gate , when I saw two of the searchers coming straight towards me . To the right of me was the park - paling , on the left a breastwork of sod , which I could not climb without being clearly seen ; to fly was to meet the enemy ; should I yield , and be baffled after all ; insulted too , most likely , for I knew that the men were tipsy ? In my hand was the tightly - wound sheet , used as a rope to confine my dress . I had folded it short and carried it , on the chance of its proving useful . In a moment I was under the palings in deep shadow , with the white sheet thrown around me , falling from my forehead , and draped artistically over the right arm . Stock still I stood against the black boards , and two great coils of long black hair flowed down the winding sheet . The men came up , tired of the chase , and grumbling ; and by their voices I knew them for my good friends Jacob and Bob . Suddenly , they espied a tall , white figure , of tremendous aspect . They stopped short , both tongue and foot , and I distinctly heard their teeth chatter . With a slow and spectral motion , I raised my draped white arm , and fetched a low , sepulchral moan . Down fell the lantern , and , with a loud yell , away went the men , as hard as their legs could carry them . Laughing heartily , I refolded my sheet , and taking the short cut across the park to the lodge where old Whitehead lived , arrived , without having met even my old friend "
122448	122696	122446	122446	Tulip	521	" The old man , in hot indignation , drew forth his battered musket — for he had once been in the militia — and swore that he would march upon the — — rogues at once . Instead of that I sent him for the two Hiatts , and the village constable ; and soon , without invitation , half the village attended . With my torn dress tucked up by good Mrs. Whitehead , and a hat on my head , newly bought for her clean little grandchild , I set forth again in the moonlight , at the head of a faithful army , to recover my native home . Hiatt easily opened the gate , which had defied my flurried efforts , and we presented ourselves at the main entrance , a force that would frighten a castle . It is needless to say that we carried all before us . The state of siege was rescinded , Mrs. Fletcher and Tilly set free , all the ringleaders turned away neck and crop , and what was far more important , my poor uncle removed , without being conscious of it , to a sweet and wholesome room . The sturdy Gloucestershire yeomen scorned all idea of danger . Tired with all my adventures , before I slept that night — still near my uncle 's bed — two reflections came dreamily over my mind . The first was a piece of vanity . "
122708	122713	122702	122702	you	312	" The second was , "
122753	123200	122741	122741	he	427	" Before that week was over , my uncle could sit up in bed for a short time every day , being duly propped in a downy nest of pillows . One arm , however , remained quite impotent , and part of one side rigid and numb . His recovery was slow and tedious , as might well be expected with one who had been dragged not from the jaws but the very throat of death . For a long time also his mind was feeble and dim , a mirror overcast by the vapours of the body . To me , who am fond of observing , in my own little childish way , it was interesting as well as delightful to note how , day by day , the mind and body , hand in hand , rose stronger . More than all was I taught , and humbled in my own conceit , by taking heed how tardily came back the power to guide and control the imagination . That object - glass of the mind — not achromatic even in first - rate intellects — had long been out of the focal distance from the lens of reason 's eye . Upon it had been glancing loose distorted images , rendered home imperfectly , if at all , to the retina of the brain . Herein its state was the very opposite to that of my own phrenoscope . I have no large imagination ; but the images it presents are vivid , and I see well round them . Every one of them is not cast , but cut , on my sensorium . Whether I can strike them off in words — whether my telegraph can print its message — is quite another question , and beside its purpose . Having rendered home to me the idols ( oftentimes inverted , though distinct ) it leaves expression and judgment to do their best with the copyright . Now , both in fabric and in mould , my uncle 's mind was different . Naturally his powers were far superior , but he seemed to take no pride in them . No dark and settled purpose had ever thrown its shadow , and even its weight , upon them ; nor had they felt , so far as I knew , the rough grasp of adversity . Therefore they were longer in recovering from the blow , than I think my own would have been . There were few things , among the many desired by Mrs. Daldy , which she failed to reconcile with her strong sense of religion . "
123204	123208	122741	122741	he	427	one"—I have heard her say—"not
123240	123257	122741	122741	he	427	heart"—Clara Vaughan 's to wit , who had kicked her that morning , quite by accident of course—"even
123263	123272	123318	123318	Elder	534	there"—slight confusion of metaphor caused by strong conviction of sin—"Infinite
123320	123321	123318	123318	Elder	534	" "
123345	123395	123543	123544	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" And he took another glass of sherry . That night I remember she worked very hard , for her ; and the next day she presented me with markers the size of a gallows , progged with many holes ; on one was done in cross - stitch , "
123400	123405	123543	123544	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" and upon the other "
123416	123505	123506	123506	We	3039	" Both of these I threw into the fire there before her eyes . From this it will be clear , that in her devotions she still remembered me , and doubtless prayed in good Scriptural phraseology for my release from this wicked world . Dr. Churchyard 's last report had raised her terror to the highest pitch , and instead of wrestling in prayer , she had run away in high panic , upon hearing that the fever - nurse was seen at large the night before . "
123514	123527	123543	123544	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" she said to Mrs. Fletcher , before she locked her in , "
123556	124487	123543	123544	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" It was wise , as well as righteous , in her to keep aloof for a time , while her devices worked their consummation . For the present it appeared to me that they were failing signally . My uncle was regaining strength of mind and body ; while native air , a sense of triumph , and daily exercise , kept me in blooming health . My patient , who otherwise could hardly bear me to leave him for an hour , insisted upon my taking a long ride every day . Lilla was charmed , and so was I , with the sweet spring air , and the rich familiar scenery . And how it did make me eat ! Thankful indeed I ought to be , and am , that it pleased God to spare me that awful and deadly pestilence . But the worst injury done by canting hypocrites is , that the repulsion they create drives away others from good . Truly I may say , that for days after being in contact with that slimy sanctity , I could not say my own prayers , as a little child should do . Of that fever there had been three fatal cases in the village , before it entered our house ; and I found that it was spreading rapidly . With my uncle 's authority , I had the drainage surveyed and amended at once ; and so the pest was stayed . Of course we did not neglect our own weak point ; and the crawling noisome smell was no longer perceived in the room , nor the white vapour on the grass . And so three weeks went by ; no news from London or Devonshire , no explanation between my uncle and myself , no arrangements as to my expectations in life . As yet my uncle was too weak to bear any sort of excitement , and seemed desirous only to be passive in my hands . His eyes always followed me to every part of the room , and he would even be propped on the sofa to see me ride down the avenue ; and there I always found him watching for my return . Meanwhile I yearned to be once more in a certain little room with a north aspect , opposite a cheesemonger 's shop in an obscure street of London . Nightly I dreamed of Giudice , and daily I dreamed of dear Isola and Conrad . The dog in the stableyard , who had hitherto owned no especial attractions for me , suddenly found himself petted , and coaxed , and fed ( which he thought much more of ) to the scandal of Mrs. Fletcher , and the great alarm of the grooms , who would rather not have me there . Moreover , the dog himself , though I strove to invest him with every chivalrous attribute , was of a low and ungenial order , adorned with no graces of mind , and little taste , except for bones and gravy . But perhaps my standard was too high : peradventure I even commenced with more prejudice than a bulldog 's . Be that as it may — and if I can see round things , I ought to see round myself — every day fell heavier and heavier from the fair balance of time ; and every night the stars — for there was now no moon — looked wearier in the heavens , and less inclined for business . How long , how long shall you go round the pole in your steady pacing way , as if the sky were for auction , and you were pacing the lots ; while I , with more fire in me than you can strike or steal , am ditched like a glow - worm kicked under a dock - leaf , and see no polestar at all ? Here is May , the height of May : I am full of life and spirit : the garb of death , like an April cloud , blows over . Let me see . Last birthday I was eighteen : I have known more troubles than years , and enjoyed no youth as yet . Last year I spent in growing , and pining , and starving . Now the Power , that balances earth and heaven , has filled me with joy and light . Neither am I renegade to my life , in opening wide my heart to this flood of love and happiness . Still am I set upon one strong purpose . Still am I sworn , and will not repent , that if filial duty demand it , I will trample love under my feet , and cut the throat of happiness . During most of this time , I had no idea where the queen of hypocrites was ; though doubtless she knew all that was happening to us . As soon as he heard of my uncle 's surprising rally , Dr. Churchyard came over , and claimed all the merit for his own last prescription . Brought face to face with the awkward fact that the medicine had not been procured , he was not in the least disconcerted , but found that we had misunderstood him , the prescription to which he referred was the one before the last . At any rate , he enhanced his own fame immensely , and became "
124491	125054	125055	125055	Tulip	521	" in killing more people than ever . In reply to Mrs. Fletcher , for I would not deign to ask him , he stated that the excellent and devoted Mrs. Daldy had not been seen lately in Cheltenham . Her son , however , was there , and foremost in the ranks of Pump - room Lady - killers . Just what he was fit for . The doctor entertained a belief , and spread the report in Cheltenham , that Dorcas was lodged in a humble cot among the haunts of pestilence , imperilling her life and lavishing her substance to relieve the fever - stricken . This being more than I could stand , I asked the worthy doctor — who , after all , was a man of the world — what three wealthy persons Dorcas had carried with her . At first he feigned not to understand me , then looked sly , and changed the subject cleverly . Of course I referred to the well - known fact , that she supported her grandeur and her son 's extravagance by playing an admirable rubber . She was playing a better one now . Dr. Churchyard finished by writing another prescription , which , after his departure , I handed to the husband of Venus , legitimate disposer of mineral medicines . London ! London ! was still the cry of my heart ; and was I not summoned thither by duty long ago ? What might become , during all this time , of the man whom I was bound to watch at every turn , and whom I was now in a better condition to deal with ? My first visit , every morning , was to my parents ' graves , and neither of them would be there but for his ruthless hand . As I sat there how lonely I felt ! how sadly forlorn in the world , be my lot wealth or poverty , victory or defeat ! One morning as I sat there my spirit was moved by dreams of the night before , and I vowed , in that bodily but invisible presence , that none , except one whose name I whispered , should ever kneel on that turf hand in hand with me . Borne out of my usual vein by the deed myself had done , I entered the ancient church , always left open for me , and , kneeling at the altar - rails , with many a Vaughan supine in prayer , pennons , helms , and trophies round me , stately dames in marble white , and old crusaders clutching still the cross — there I made my vow upon the knee - cupped stones , that if he claimed me not , the race should end with me . It was a presumptuous and unholy act , with all around me quelled by time , with ages laid aside in dust , with many a stouter heart and larger mind than mine , helpless even to superintend the wasting of his tenement , with all his bygone bliss and woe , stanchest love and deadliest hate , less eloquent now than the fly whom the spider has caught in his skull . Returning across the park , after a warm interview with "
125057	125311	125055	125055	Tulip	521	" who insisted mainly upon having his ears well scratched , I found my uncle in his snug wheel - chair , waiting near the side - door for me to help and accompany him forth . This was our best way to take him out , because of the steps at the front - door . He had not yet been in the open air since his terrible illness , but , judging by my own experience , I thought that he pined for the breeze , and , after long council , it was resolved to trust him forth this day . With all his heart he was longing to be out ; but , instead of expressing impatience , smiled gratefully at me . I now observed that he had a sweet and winning smile — a gift bestowed not rarely on faces of a sombre cast . In return for it I kissed him , and we sailed smoothly out . How he revelled , to be sure , in the first clear breath from the lips of heaven ! Stretching one poor arm forth — the other he could not move — he tried to spread himself like a flower to the sun . Then he drew long draughts of liquid freedom , and was for a time as one intoxicated . In the glorious crystal bath he seemed to float away from earth . Coming to himself at length , he looked at me , and said , "
125321	125330	125333	125333	John	411	" A year ago he would have said , "
125335	125430	125333	125333	John	411	" and no more . But illness is a great refiner . When John was out of sight he allowed free vent to the tears of joy and gratitude , whereof , in my opinion , he had no call to be ashamed . I kissed him many times . My warm impassioned nature always felt for and delighted in any touch like this . Then he placed his better hand on the cold and rigid one , lifting this with that , and poured forth silent thanks to the Giver of all things . "
125435	125441	125333	125333	John	411	" at length he said , "
125497	125528	125535	125535	me	0	" I will not repeat his words , because it would not become me ; but I am forced by all that has happened to show what his feelings were . "
125561	125573	125574	125575	Dear uncle	3045	" Here I stopped him , lest he should be overcome . "

126025	126227	126233	126233	he	3053	" What , Clara , ca n't you live with me even now ? Everything shall be yours , as it ought to be . I will never meddle with you in any way , but keep to some lonely corner , and not see you very often . Oh , Clara ! dear Clara ! do n't go away ! You know I am quite helpless , and I ca n't live long , and you are all in all to me , and I am so proud of you , darling ! But it is not for myself I care . I can not tell , much less can you , what mischief may be done if you leave this house again . That low , crafty woman will be back again directly — she who made cowards of all the household , and acted the coward herself , who left me to die in my lonely bed , while she took all my keys . If her treachery succeeds , I shall rise from my grave . And I know she will poison me yet , if she gets the chance , and can make anything by it . "
126267	126274	126275	126275	he	3053	" Do n't go , Clara ! "
126299	126355	126275	126275	he	3053	" Do n't go , my darling , blessed Clara ! I have had none to love for years and years , and to love you is so sweet ! If you go I must die at once , and , worse than that , die wretched in the knowledge that you will be robbed . "

We be afeared to show our noses there , even at the command of dooty . You can hear him growling now like all the Strand and Fleet Street ; and my mate Balak here leave half his breeches behind him , saving your presence , Miss , and lucky to get off so . Now if so be you undertakes , honour bright , to march straight into that front room , my mate and self have concluded to let you in . "
128259	128265	128267	128267	I	0	" Of course I will , "
128303	128312	128314	128316	one of them	1627	" You must unlock the door , Miss , "
128318	128327	128314	128316	one of them	1627	" we was forced to lock him in . "
128328	128344	128345	128345	He	539	" Oh Judy , my darling Judy , my own pet love of a Judy . "
128477	128501	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Why , dear Mrs. Shelfer , how glad I am to see you ! And you look much younger , I declare ! "
128502	128519	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" And , Miss , you do look bootiful , bootiful , my good friend ! Splendid things,"—I
128530	128589	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	colours—"splendid , Miss Vaughan , and how you becomes 'em to be sure ! Talk of Miss Idols after that , why it 's the Queen to a gipsy ! And pray , Miss , if I may make so bold , what did you give for this ? it beats my sarcenet dress , I do believe . "
128590	128601	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Nothing , Mrs. Shelfer , only a little kiss . "
128602	128672	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Gracious me , Miss , then you 've been and got engaged , and to a lord at least . I heard you were come into your great fortune at last ; more than all Middlesex they tell me , Regency Park and all ! And that poor straight - legged young man , as come here every day to see Judy , and to ask for you . "
128673	128682	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Now , Mrs. Shelfer , do n't talk nonsense,"—my
128697	128714	128688	128688	I	0	" I only hope you have n't said a word to him about these foolish reports . "
128715	128727	128467	128468	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" Me , Miss ! Do you think I would now ? "
128728	128759	128765	128765	Conrad	427	" Yes ; I know by your face you have . You ca n't cheat me , Mrs. Shelfer . Never mind , if you have not mentioned my name . "
128773	128787	128789	128789	she	3100	" No , never , Miss , as I hope to be saved . "
128801	128822	128798	128798	her	3100	" Come , Mrs. Shelfer , now ; I 've got some pretty little trifles for you in this bag . "
128862	128900	128854	128854	she	3100	" Pray , Miss , as you are so very kind , excuse my taking the liberty , but would you mind giving Judy the bag in his paws ? no fear of them getting it there . "
128901	128925	128854	128854	she	3100	" Why , what on earth is the matter ? Why did n't you let me in ? Who are those nasty men ? "
128926	129011	128854	128854	she	3100	" Oh , it 's nothing , Miss ; nothing at all to speak of : only they knocks my sticks so in making the inwentory , and the one they made last time , and the time before , would do every bit as well . But they charges for it , every time , the rogues — and they dare to put the chairs down lackered and American cloth , good , morocco as ever was , and as if Miss Minto — "
129012	129032	128854	128854	she	3100	" Now , Mrs. Shelfer , tell me in two words what it means . Is it a sale ? "
129033	129108	128854	128854	she	3100	" No , no , Miss , I should hope not ; only an execution , and them two men are the bailiffs ; civil tongues enough , and very good judges of porter and periwinkles . They 're the ones as come last time ; but I 'd sooner have the old ones , jolly fellows they were , and knew how to wink both eyes . But that cross - eyed thief — "
129109	129120	128854	128854	she	3100	" And have they got my things , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
129121	129198	128854	128854	she	3100	" No , Miss ; only what few was in the bedroom ; they dare n't come here for Judy . It was as much as their lives were worth . If I had known they was coming , I 'd have had him at the front door , but they locked him in as soon as he got a piece out of the other fellow 's leg . Bless me , how he did holloa ! "
129199	129221	128854	128854	she	3100	" Do you mean to say , Mrs. Shelfer , that they have taken possession of my things in my bedroom ? "
129222	129288	128854	128854	she	3100	" To be sure , Miss. I said they was yours , and of course they would n't believe me , and the folding door was shut , but Judy would have broken it down only they put the bedstead again it . Gracious me ! I never see a dog take on so in all my life ! He was like a roaring lion . "
129289	129343	128854	128854	she	3100	" I should rather hope so . Giudice , I commend you ; and I 've a great mind to let you out , and what is more , I will if they do n't give me back my things . Surely , Mrs. Shelfer , they have no right to my property . "
129344	129370	128854	128854	she	3100	" Well , so I say , Miss ; because it is n't for the landlord ; but they wo n't believe they are yours . "
129371	129434	128854	128854	she	3100	" If they do n't believe me pretty soon , Giudice shall convince them . He is a judge you know , and I 've no idea of robbery any more than he has . But who is doing all this , and why do you seem so unconcerned about it ? I should cry my eyes out , I am sure . "
129435	129568	128854	128854	she	3100	" Bless your pretty heart , Miss ; this makes the fifteenth time I 've had them here in the last four years . At first I was terribly put out , and made myself a figure crying ; but now I only think it 's company , and they drink as if they was , that 's certain . You must have seen the inwentories , Miss , round the candles lots of times . Only one thing they does that do n't strike me as wery honourable , though it 's law I b'lieve ; they charges me , and wery high too , for eating up my victuals , and they will have meat four times a day . Why , that Balak , him with his breeches gone — "
129569	129585	128854	128854	she	3100	" Who put them in , Mrs. Shelfer , and how much is it for ? "
129586	129609	128854	128854	she	3100	" Oh , it 's one of Charley 's bills or notes , of course . Quinlan holds it , him as keeps "
129616	129725	128854	128854	she	3100	" down Maiden Lane , and Charley says that all he got for it was ten shillings and a waggon - load of water - cresses . Now they 'll be here directly , Miss , with you to keep the dog in . Excuse me , Miss , I see you have got one of them new wide things as go all round and up — capital things , I must have one before they come again . And could you manage to sit upon the sofa , Miss , and the three best chairs in your petticoat , with the tea - poy on your lap ? "
129726	129737	128854	128854	she	3100	" What on earth do you mean , Mrs. Shelfer ? "
129738	129768	128854	128854	she	3100	" Why , Miss , they ca n't lay hold of any article in use , I believe , and you have got so much room in your things . "
129769	129797	128854	128854	she	3100	" Do you suppose I intend to let them come here , for a moment ? Now let me look at my bedroom . Come , Judy . "
129798	129916	128854	128854	she	3100	" Oh , Miss , they did have such a hunt here for Charley 's double - barrel gun ; a regular beauty it is , and that big rogue Quinlan is after it . They know it all round this neighbourhood , it was made by a famous maker , Joe something , I b'lieve , and the best he ever made ; it was poor Miss Minto 's brother 's ; and they sha n't have it , not one of 'em . I 'd sooner shoot them with it . I keeps it always in the safest place I knows on , and twice a year I see that it do n't get rusty . "
129917	129927	129928	129928	She	3101	" What safe place do you keep it in ? "
129950	130066	129939	129939	her	3101	" At the broker 's , Miss , in Barbican . He has had it now six years . It 's in for a quarter its value , but that 's all the better for me : I have less to pay for keeping it , and I carries the ticket night and day in my bosom . And do you know , my good friend , they thought they had got it just now ; they got a key that fitted that box of yours , that you always locked so carefully , and they made sure that was it ; ha , ha , how I laughed at them when they opened it ! "
130067	130079	129928	129928	She	3101	" What ! have they dared to open my mahogany box ? "
130089	130184	129939	129939	her	3101	" To be sure they did , Miss , and they found such curious things there ! A lovely thing all set with jewels , they said , a baggonet fit for the Duke of Wellington , and plaster shapes like a cobbler 's last , and coloured paper with queer letters on it , and a piece of long black hair , and a plan with distances on it — Lor , Miss , what on earth is the matter ? Water ! water ! You 're like death — Balaam ! Balak ! "
130185	130189	130241	130241	She	3102	" Stop , Mrs. Shelfer"—I
130194	130240	129939	129939	her	3101	bed—"I would not for ten thousand pounds have had that box exposed to those low ruffians , ransacked , and even catalogued . If I can punish them I will ; and you too , you low , miserly , meddling , inquisitive old crone . "
130266	130270	130261	130261	I	0	" old crone . "
130332	130337	130338	130338	I	0	" Serves her right , "
130543	130564	130534	130534	she	3102	" I tell you , my dear Patty , when I come to your age , when I am five and thirty"—she
130570	130599	130534	130534	she	3102	least—"I shall fully deserve to be called an old woman for this ; and much older I shall look , there is no doubt , than you do . "
130600	130611	130616	130616	she	3102	" Right , my good friend , you are quite right there"—this
130619	130657	130616	130616	she	3102	right.—"Why the young man from the butcher 's , he said to me this morning , and beautiful black hair reminded me of yours , Miss , all stuck together with the fat from off the kidneys — "
130658	130671	130534	130534	she	3102	" Come , Mrs. Shelfer , let me see about my box . "
130672	130781	130534	130534	she	3102	" To be sure , to be sure , my dear Miss Vaughan ; but what do you think he said ? ' Now , William John , ' says I , ' a good steak mind , a tender juicy steak , for the gentleman visitors here'—Balaam , Miss , and Balak , if you please,—'does like good juicy meat . ' ' Mrs. Shelfer , ma'am , ' he says , a bowing with his tray like that , ' you shall have a steak , ma'am , as fresh and as juicy as yourself . ' Now was n't that pretty , my good friend ? "
130782	130794	130898	130898	he	539	" Beautiful , Mrs. Shelfer . But see about my box . "
130795	130821	130534	130534	she	3102	" Surely , surely , Miss Vaughan . But it was very pretty , like a valentine , do n't you think it was now ? "
130822	130827	130534	130534	she	3102	" Where is it ? "
130828	130838	130898	130898	he	539	" Downstairs , Miss , in my little parlour . "
130839	130853	130534	130534	she	3102	" Then send it up at once , by one of the men . "
130910	130918	130920	130920	I	0	" Put it here if you please , "
130926	130947	130920	130920	I	0	" the dog will not touch you while I am here . Now what is the amount of this execution ? "
130948	130965	130920	130920	I	0	" Debt fifteen pounds , Miss ; expenses up to five o'clock , four pound ten . "
130966	130978	130920	130920	I	0	" Here is the money . Now give me a receipt . "
130979	130992	130920	130920	I	0	" No , Miss ! You do n't mean to pay all ! "
130993	131000	130920	130920	I	0	" Of course , I do . "
131001	131133	130920	130920	I	0	" Then , Miss , I beg your pardon , but I ca n't allow you . I has a duty to my employer , and I has a duty to the public too , not forgetting Mrs. Shelfer , and Charley an old friend , and all so handsome in the way of victuals . And I 'm sure she would n't wish you to be cheated , Miss. Pay ten pounds for the debt , Miss , and that 's a deal more than it cost them or they expects to get . ' Twixt you and me , Miss , every stick of this here furniture is in a dozen bills of sale already ; and we comes here more for practice like , than for anything else . "
131167	131212	131155	131155	Balaam	539	" Now , Miss , you wo n't think me rude ; but you have come down so handsome , I can tell you something as you may like to know . I 've seed the very moral of that sword of yours before . "
131213	131223	131224	131224	I	0	" Are you certain ? Pray where was it ? "
131229	131253	131224	131224	I	0	" It was in a place in Somers - town , Miss ; where I made a levy , some eight year agone . "
131254	131263	130920	130920	I	0	" What was the name of the people ? "
131264	131317	130920	130920	I	0	" Dallyhorse , or Jellycorse , or something of the sort . Foreigners they was , and they had only just come to this country . But I can tell you the name more shipshape from the books . Ah , the very moral of it ; only there warn't no serpent . "
131318	131328	131224	131224	I	0	" Do you know what has become of them ? "
131329	131375	130920	130920	I	0	" No that I do n't , and do n't want to come across them again . A mean set of mongrel parlywoos ; I got starved amost . But I did hear they was riding the high horse now , and something about court . "
131376	131394	130920	130920	I	0	" Are you quite sure that the weapon was exactly like this ? Look at this again . "
131395	131496	131224	131224	I	0	" Miss , I can take my oath it was the fellow pea , all but the little snake , and he ai n't a fixture , I do n't believe . I would have sworn it was the very same , only you tells me not . I noticed it most particular ; for I never see one like it , though I have had a sight of foreign weapons in my hands ere now . And the gent had got it put away so ; we come across it only through a cat as happened to be confined — "
131497	131510	130920	130920	I	0	" And what became of it ? Did your employer have it ? "
131511	131556	130920	130920	I	0	" Not he , Miss. When the gent found we had got it , he was put out and no mistake ; though he sham not . Away he goes and gets the money somehow , and has us all away in no time . "
131557	131566	131224	131224	I	0	" How many were there in the family ? "
131567	131639	130920	130920	I	0	" Well , let me see . They was only living in lodgings , and had but half the house . There was Dallyhorse himself , and a queer - looking lady , and some children , I do n't know how many children , for they kept them out of the way ; and a nice young woman as did the cooking for them , and precious little it was . "

132031	132528	132022	132023	Balaam Levison	537	" I allowed him to depart , and heard him pause on every stair , to ponder this strange matter . Presently Mr. Shelfer came home , and was delighted to see the bailiffs ; and the pleasure being mutual , and my cash burning to be quenched , a most hilarious evening was the natural result . My health was drunk , as I could hear too plainly , to unfathomable depths : and comic songs from three loud organs , provided with patent nasal stops , with even Patty 's treble pipe audible in the chorus , broke from time to time the tenour of my sad and lonely thoughts . The bailiff 's discovery , and the pursuit commenced thereon , appeared to me so important , that in reply to the message received the next morning — that my uncle was much the same , and longing for my return — I sent word that my journey was put off until the day after the morrow . This allowed me one day more for tidings from my new scouts , as to the success of their efforts . I was very sorry to disappoint my poor sick uncle , but it seemed still worse to run away all in the dark . The next thing I did was to arrange with Mrs. Shelfer about the money I had paid for her . It was not the money I cared for , but I had other views . Although she was politely thankful , I perceived that she thought it a very bad job indeed , and a most romantic transaction . Thirty per cent . was the very largest dividend she had ever intended to pay . But the plan which I proposed was so much for her benefit , while it suited me , who otherwise must have lost the money , that it almost recovered her from the shock of having paid a debt . The plan was simply this , that she should reserve my rooms for me , airing and cleaning them duly , and always keeping the bed in a fit state to be slept on at an hour 's notice . My previous rent had been twelve shillings a week , the utmost I could afford out of my narrow income ; attendance , and linen , and other troubles being now dispensed with , I thought it fair to allow her ten shillings off her debt to me , for every week I should so retain the rooms . The 4*l . * for the expenses of the execution I forgave her altogether ; inasmuch as I had paid without consulting her . Directly my payment should be exhausted , to wit in twenty weeks , I would send her a further sum , if I still required the rooms . She was delighted with this arrangement , which in fact enabled her to have her "
132530	132974	131995	131995	you	0	" all to herself , to pet them and talk to them every day , and even to clean them , if such a freak of destruction ever should enter her brain . She could use the sitting - room for her own pleasure and pride , as much as ever she chose , so long as it always was ready for me ; and already visions were passing before her mind 's eye , of letting the parlour downstairs with the onion - room for its dormitory . To me the arrangement was very convenient , as affording a fixed and familiar resort in London , and a pivot of ready communication . Nor was it a small consolation to feel that I still retained a stronghold in the neighbourhood of dear friends . All this being comfortably settled , Giudice and I went forth to pay our visit in Lucas Street . The whole of that street we found so utterly changed in appearance by a vigorous onset of painters , grainers , and decorators , that it was not easy to know the house we were in quest of . Even the numbers on the doors , which had been illegible , or very nearly so , had now been re - arranged and painted over again upon the fashionable and very sensible mode of marking odd numerals on one side , and even ones on the other . Finding myself in a difficulty , and the houses all alike as the central peas of a pod , I trusted to Judy 's delicate nose , and rang the bell of the door at which he halted . Then he drew back , and trembled , and crouched upon the pavement , to wait for my return . As I heard the tinkle , my heart began to flutter : who could tell what new phase of my life might begin with that little pull ? After some delay , poor old Cora came , looking as weird and woebegone as ever — fierce would have been that look to any one but me . I knew that I held her by my magic gordit , like the slave of the lamp . After imploring in some mumbled words ( which I interpreted only by knowledge of her desire ) gracious leave to kiss that potent charm , she led me into the breakfast - parlour , where I found sweet Isola in a passionate flood of tears . At sight of me , her beautiful smile broke through them , and her quick deep sobs spent themselves in kisses . "

133474	133505	133469	133469	he	427	" She pronounced the last word almost with a scream , as an insult beyond forgiveness . What it meant I did not ask , I had heard enough already . "

By the time we reached Mrs. Shelfer 's , Idols was in capital spirits again , and pressed me for some account of the wonderful wealth , and the grand house she had heard of . No doubt this rumour had found its way through Ann Maples . "

133937	133951	133932	133932	you	0	" I was not attending much , but thinking of some one else . "
133998	134403	133986	133986	he	427	" I had jumped to that hope long ago , before we even left Lucas Street , and that had something to do with my walking so fast . No , he was not there , he had not been there to - day . It was my turn now to cry ; what might he not have done , after that fearful insult , and from his own father too ? The tears , which I confided to no one except the wooden - legged blackbird — for Giudice would have made such a fuss about them — were still upon my cheeks , when I heard the well - known step — not half so elastic as usual . I fled into my bedroom , and pushed the boxes about , to make a goodly noise , and to account for the colour in my face . Then out I came at the side - door , and ran downstairs perversely , though I knew that Conrad and Isola were in my sitting - room . But this first - rate manoeuvre only outwitted its author , for Isola ran down after me , and sent me upstairs alone . All my little nonsense vanished the moment I looked in Conrad 's face . His healthy brown complexion was faded to an opal white ; beneath his eyes such dark blue rims , that I thought he had spectacles on ; and on either cheek a round red spot was burning . So shocked I was , that when he took my hand , I turned my face away and smothered down a sob . I felt that I had no right to be so fresh and blooming . Nor was it only in health that the contrast between us lay . I was dressed with unusual care , having fidgeted all the morning , and with my utmost taste . Poor Conrad was in his working clothes , full of marble dust , tumbled , threadbare , and even in need of mending ; his hair swept anyhow , and his hands not over - lately washed . Yet , for all that , he was as clearly a gentleman , as I was a lady . Not so would he have been arrayed , I fancy , had he thought to see neat Clara . And yet , who knows ? "
134412	134418	134407	134407	you	3145	" he began to say , "

134535	134548	134526	134530	No one in the world	3147	" I said very softly , and my voice thrilled through him . "

134597	134629	134590	134590	you	0	" His throat was swelling with these bitter words , and he looked at his dusty clothes . Somewhat rude I thought him , but I knew not half his troubles . "
134654	134734	134648	134649	Your sister	3151	" And I turned away to the window . For a minute he said nothing ; but I could hear his heart beat . Stedfastly I looked at the cheesemonger 's shop . Oh for a flower , or something on the balcony ! Presently he came round the corner of the sofa . Without being rude , I could not help turning round . His face was much , much , brighter , and his eyes more kind . "

When I came to myself , both his arms were round me , and I was looking up at his poor sick face , my hair quite full of marble chips , and he was telling me with glad tears in his eyes , which he never took from mine , how he cared for nothing now , not for all the world , not for glory or fur shame , so long as I only loved him . "
134936	134940	134837	134837	I	0	" I whispered , "
134954	135018	134837	134837	I	0	" All the folly we went through I am not going to repeat , though I remember well every atom of it . Let the wise their wisdom keep , we are babes and sucklings . Neither of us had ever loved before , or ever meant to love again , except of course each other , and that should be for ever . "

Down to the earth it fell beneath the foot of true love , and I kissed away from his eyes the mingled reproach and sorrow , assuring him that at least he should have a legitimate wife . To make amends , I leaned upon him one moment , and put my hand on his shoulder , and let him play awhile with the dark shower of my hair . "

135381	135413	135375	135375	her	546	" With actual violence he thrust me from his arms , and stood staring at me , while I trembled from head to foot ; his face was one scarlet flame . "

135579	135684	135572	135572	I	0	" Away he rushed from the house , and I fell upon the bed , and lay in fits till midnight . I believe that my heart would have burst , if they had not cut my stays ; and how I wished it had . When I came back to my unlucky self , there was something shivery cold in the forehead wave of my hair . Was it Conrad 's finger ? I put up my hand to dash it away , and caught a fine fat leech . Dr. Franks was sitting by me , holding a basin and a sponge . "

136493	136723	136486	136486	her	463	" No , I do n't dear . I do n't know at all . All I know is there must have been some dreadful quarrel between you and Conrad . I must tell you , dear , I was so anxious about something you can guess , that I stole up to the door soon after he came in ; and you were so intent upon the window , that you never even saw me put the door ajar ; and then I heard him tell you how very much he loved you , and I was so glad . And then I thought it was not quite fair of me , and I knew all I wanted , so I ran downstairs again . And the next thing I heard was your bedroom door bang and then Conny dashed out the house , and Judy came down to me looking very sorrowful . And I ran up to you , and here I found you shrieking so , and rolling , and clutching at the bedclothes , and I was so frightened I could not even move . And then Judy came and made such a dreadful howling , and Mrs. Shelfer ran straight off for the doctor , and I poured the water in the decanter over you , and I ca n't tell any more . "
136724	136737	136481	136481	I	0	" But surely , darling , you have been home since that ? "
136738	136839	136963	136963	My	0	" Oh yes ; when Dr. Franks came , and you were a little better , he would make me go home , because he did not want two patients , he said ; and his eldest daughter , such a nice girl , came with me ; and my papa did n't even know that I had been out of the house . He was still upstairs , brooding over his relics , and all the sixth form at the College had to go to dinner without their lectures ; but I do believe the stupid girls were glad . "
136840	136853	136486	136486	her	463	" And did you hear — no , it does n't matter . "
136854	136925	136963	136963	My	0	" No , I never heard what became of Conrad . No doubt he went back to his favourite chip , chipping . He has got a splendid thing he is full of now , and it prevents his sleeping ; something or other very horrible from Dante , and the leading figure is modelled after you . I have seen the drawings , and he has got you exactly . "
136926	136962	136486	136486	her	463	" How gratifying to be sure ! I will ask you no more questions . Pray let me know when I am for sale ; though I should call it a work of illegitimate art . "

137310	137336	137247	137249	a plain keeper	3192	" No , not half so much . I like Pappy very well when he is good and kind , but that is not very often now"—the

You are tired to - night , my love , and so should I have been , if you had not come home . To - morrow you shall tell me why you came so suddenly and saved me a day of longing . And to - morrow , if I am strong enough , I will tell you a little history , which may be lost , like many a great one , unless it is quickly told . Stop — one cup of tea , dear , and how proud I am to pour it out for you — and then I will not keep you from a livelier friend . To - morrow , you must introduce me . I still like pretty girls , and you should have brought that lovely Isola with you . I ca n't think why you did n't . She would have been most welcome . "

138976	139099	138967	138967	I	0	" To be sure I do , dear uncle ; do you suppose , because I have been off duty , that I mean to be cashiered ? Only one thing I must tell you ; I have brought home with me one of the very best friends I ever had . You have heard me talk of Giudice . I can not bear the thought of parting with him to - night , he will cry so dreadfully in the strange stables ; and in London he always slept on the mat outside my door . May I have him in the lobby , uncle , you will never hear him move , and he never snores except just after dinner ? "

139479	139510	139519	139519	her	409	" It 's true , Miss. True as you stand there . Pale gray it is this time , and so tall , and the face as white as ashes . "

139593	139625	139519	139519	her	409	" One o'clock , Miss , as punctual as a time - piece . But could you suppose , Miss , any one would dare to wait up and see it ? "
139626	139640	139519	139519	her	409	" Then how have they seen it , in the name of folly ? "
139641	139693	139519	139519	her	409	" Why , Miss , I 'll tell you . One of the carriage - horses got an inflammation in his eyes , and the farrier give orders to have it sponged never more than three hours between , and so William Edwards , the head - groom if you please , Miss"—Tilly
139702	139834	139519	139519	her	409	sweetheart—"he stops up till one o'clock to see to it , and then Job Leyson goes instead . So William come in , Miss , on Monday night , to go to bed , please , Miss , and he took the short cut , not that he were allowed , Miss , or would think of taking a liberty on no account whatever , but he were that sleepy he did n't know the way to bed , so he went across the corridor for the short cut from the kitchen gallery to the servants ' passage ; and there he saw — he had n't any light , Miss , and the lamps all out — Goodness me ! Whatever was that ? Did you hear it , Miss ? "
139835	139875	139519	139519	her	409	" Yes , and see it , Tilly ; it 's a daddy in your candle . Go on , Tilly , will you . Am I to stop here all night and get as bad as you are ? "
139876	139951	139519	139519	her	409	" There William Edwards , a man who never swears or drinks , there he saw all in the dark , coming so stately down the corridor , as if it had n't room enough , with one arm up like this , a tall pale melancholy ghost , and he knew it was the lady who was wronged and killed , when the great wars was , Miss , two hundred year agone . "
139952	139964	139519	139519	her	409	" Well , Tilly , and did he speak to it ? "
139965	140036	139519	139519	her	409	" He was that frightened , Miss , he could not move or speak ; but he fell again the wall in the side - passage , with his eyes coming out of his head , and his hair up like my wicker - broom . And then she vanished away , and he got to bed , and did perspire so , they was forced to wring the blankets . "
140037	140050	139519	139519	her	409	" Capital , Tilly ! And who saw her the next night ? "
140051	140213	139519	139519	her	409	" Why that nincompoop Job Leyson , Miss. Our William was a deal too wise to go that way any more , but he tell Job Leyson , and he a foolish empty fellow , perhaps you know , Miss. ' Ho , ' says Job , ' I often hear tell of her , to - night I 'll have a peep . ' So last night when William went to bed on the servants ' side , down comes Job and takes the front way , pretty impudent of him I think . And , Miss , I do n't know what he see , I never says much to him ; but there they found him in the saddle - room , at five o'clock this morning , with his heels up on a rack , and his head down in the bucket , and never a bit of sponge had come near the poor mare 's eye . "
140214	140242	139519	139519	her	409	" Oh , thank you , Tilly . Perhaps you had better snuff your candle . No ghost will have much chance that comes near my Judy . "

142955	142986	142987	142987	She	312	" Indeed ! I am perfectly amazed at your audacity . What I have belongs to me righteously , and a stronger hand than yours is required to rob me . "

To your care only will I commit these papers , one of which , I hope will soon be of little value . It is my will ; and by it your father 's estates are restored to you , while the money which I have saved by my own care and frugality is divided into two portions , one for you , and the other , upon certain events , for that worthless Mrs. Daldy . This must be altered at once . When you have heard my story , you may read the will , if you like . Indeed I wish you to do so , because it will prove that in spite of all our estrangement , I have meant all along to act justly towards you . But that you may understand things properly , I will tell you my strange history . Only one thing you must promise before I begin . "
143799	143807	143959	143959	he	3334	" What is it , uncle dear ? "
143808	143832	143833	143833	I	0	" That you will forgive me for my one great error . Although it was the cause of your dear father 's death . "
143858	143941	143843	143843	I	0	" My darling , I am not quite strong enough now after all you have been telling me . Although I had dark suspicions yesterday that some plot was in action ; for I had observed that things in the study were not as I had left them ; and I had other reasons too . But take me , my precious child , to the sunny bank this afternoon , and please God , I will at least begin my tale . "
144156	144309	144153	144154	EDGAR VAUGHAN	297	" I have always been , as you know , of a roving unsocial nature . My father being dead before I was born , and my mother having married again before I could walk , there was little to counteract my centrifugal tendencies . I seemed to belong to neither family ; though I always clung to the Vaughans , and disliked the Daldys . The trustees of my mother 's settlement were my virtual guardians ; for all the Vaughan estates being most strictly entailed , my father had nothing to dispose of , and therefore had made no will . My mother 's settlement comprised only personal estate , for no power had been reserved under the entail to create any charges upon the land . The mortgages , of which no doubt you have heard , as paid off by your father , were encumbrances of long standing . "
144681	144791	144792	144792	You	3357	" At Lincoln 's Inn , my life was much the same , except that wherries succeeded punts , and evening rides were exchanged for moonlight walks in the park . It was reported at home , as it is of most men who are called to the Bar , that I was likely to do great things . There never was a chance of it . Setting aside the question of ability , I had no application , no love of the law , no idea whatever of touting ; and still more fatal defect , my lonely habits were darkening into a shy dislike of my species . "
144876	144966	144967	144967	Your	3359	" During the height of the London season I was always most restless and misanthropic . Not that I looked with envy on the frivolous dust of fashion , and clouds of sham around me ; but that I felt myself lowered as an Englishman by the cringing , the falsehood , the small babooneries , which we call ' society . ' I longed to be , if I could but afford it , where men have more manly self - respect , and women more true womanhood . "
145244	145283	145224	145224	He	5757	" ' Come , Ned , ' he cried , ' there are but two of us ; there 's room for both in the old nest ; and you are big enough to thrash me now . ' "
145306	145760	145294	145294	he	5757	" So you see , my child , instead of grudging your father the property , I had every reason to love and revere him . However , I refused this as well as the other offer ; but I accepted his present , and invested it rather luckily . After spending a pleasant month at home — as I always called it — I returned to London early in April , 1827 . There are no two minds alike , any more than there are two bodies ; and yet how little variety exists in polite society ! Surely it were more reasonable to wedge the infant face into a jelly - mould , to flute its ears and cheeks like collared head , and grow the nose and lips and eyebrows into rosettes and grapes and acorns , than to bow and cramp and squeeze a million minds into one set model . Yet here I find men all alike , Dane and Saxon , Celt and Norman , like those who walk where snow is deep , or Alpine travellers lashed to a rope , trudging each in other 's footprint , swinging all their arms in time , looking neither right nor left , and so on through life 's pilgrimage , a file some million deep . Who went first they do not know , why they follow they can not tell , what it leads to they never ask . I was marked and scorned at once , because I dared to adopt a hat that did not scalp me in half - an hour , and a cravat that did not throttle me ; and even had the hardihood to dine when I felt hungry . How often I longed for a land of freedom and common sense , where it is no disgrace to carry a barrel of oysters , or shake hands with a tradesman . I know what you are smiling at , Clara . You are thinking to yourself , ' how different you are now , my good uncle ; and wern't you a little inconsistent in sanctioning all this livery humbug here ? ' Yes , I am different now . I am older and wiser than to expect to wipe away with my coat - sleeve the oxide of many centuries . As for the livery , it makes them happy : it is an Englishman 's uniform . And I have seen and suffered so bitterly from the violence of an untamed race , that I admire less what I used to call the unlassoed arch of the human neck . I have seen a coarse line somewhere , "
145994	146141	146149	146149	I	0	" Early one afternoon in the month of April , 1829 , I launched my little boat from the Temple - stairs , where I kept it , and feeling more than usually saturnine and moody , resolved on a long expedition . So I victualled my ship like Robinson Crusoe , and took some wraps and coverings . It was then slack water , just at the height of the flood . I meant to have gone to Richmond , but being far too indolent to struggle against the tide , I yielded to nature 's good pleasure , and pulled away down stream . In a few minutes a rapid ebb tide was running , and I made up my mind to go with it as far as ever it chose , and to return with the flood whenever that pleased to meet me . "
146306	146632	146301	146301	I	0	" It was high time for me to turn : row as I would , I could hardly get back to my haven by midnight . Outrigger skiffs were not yet known ; and an oarsman could not glide along at the rate of ten miles an hour . Just as I was working round , a steam packet , which had been moored a short way below , crippled perhaps in her engines , now at the turn of the tide passed up , and was quickly out of sight . As she passed me I hailed for a tow - rope ; but either they could not hear , or they did not choose to notice me . There was nothing for it but to bend my back to the oars , and keep a sharp look out . Presently the flood began to make strongly up the river , and I gave way with a will , my paddles bending and the water gleaming in the early starlight . It was a lonely and melancholy scene . The gray mist returning from some marshy excursion , and hugging the warm sea - water , floated along in dull folds , with a white flaw of steam here and there curdling over the current . Not a ship , not a barge was in sight ; no voice of men or low of cattle broke the foggy silence : but the wash of the stream on its sludgy marge , or on some honey - combed mooring - post , surged every now and then betwixt the jerks of my rowlocks . The loneliness and the sadness harmonised with my sombre mind . All is transient , all is selfish , all is a flux of melancholy . If we toss and dance we are only boats adrift ; we are nothing more than crazy tide - posts , if we be philosophers . "
147203	147342	147196	147196	they	3429	" At length I had time to look round . On a low truckle bed at the end of the long dark room , in which a ship - lamp was burning , there lay an elderly lady in a perfect stupor of fright and illness . Upon the floor with her head thrown back against the timbers , and her black eyes wide open and fixed on me , sat a girl of remarkable beauty , though her cheeks were as white as death . A magnificent ring , for which she had fought most desperately , was wrenched from its place on her finger and hung over the opal nail , for her hands were clenched , and her arms quite stiff , in the swoon of utter exhaustion . Both ladies were in deep mourning . "

Barking was a long way off , and the marshy track unknown to me , and not likely to be found in the dark . Moreover , there must be some hazard in leaving them still in that villanous den , no matter how their cowardly foes might be bound . At last , and with great difficulty , I embarked the two ladies in my shallop , and wrapped them warmly from the night air ; then after relashing my prisoners , and locking them up in separate rooms , and the woman downstairs , I pulled away stoutly for Woolwich . Here I obtained a carriage , and started my convoy for London , and then returned with two policemen to the "
147857	147897	148050	148050	him	3455	" as the low caboose was called . But both our birds were flown , as I was inclined to expect . Most likely the woman had contrived to get out , and release them . At any rate the "
147901	147997	148050	148050	him	3455	" had no crew , and the deserters had set it on fire . The flames , as we rowed away , after vainly searching the marshes , cast a lurid glow on the mud - banks , and on the slackening tide ; a true type it was of what soon befell me — the burning of my caboose . The two men were caught long afterwards by the Thames Police , and transported for life on a conviction for river piracy . At least , I was told that they were the men . "
147998	148017	148050	148050	him	3455	" And of course , dear uncle , you fell deeply in love with the beautiful Adelaide Green . "
148018	148042	148043	148043	I	0	" Of course , my dear , a young lady would conclude so . But at present I must not talk any more . "
148052	148092	148093	148093	He	3455	" And what I have next to relate is matter of deeper feeling . By Jove , to think how I battled with that strong man ! And now your little fist , Clara , would floor me altogether . "
148166	148662	148161	148164	STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN	574	" On the following day , when I called at the house in Bloomsbury — then a fashionable neighbourhood — to which I had been directed , I was met at the threshold , with power and warmth , by Peter Green himself , an old acquaintance of mine , who proved to be Adelaide 's brother . My nature had been too reserved for me to be friendly with him at College , but I had liked him much better than any one else , because he was so decided and straight - forward . The meeting rather surprised me , for Green is not a rare name , and so it had never occurred to me to ask the weary Adelaide whether she knew one Peter Green , a first - class man of Christchurch . Peter , who was a most hearty fellow , and full , like his sister , of animal life , overpowered me with the weight of his gratitude , which I did not at all desire or deserve . As , in spite of your rash conclusion , my romantic Clara , I did not fall in love with Adelaide , who besides her pithsome health and vigour was in many respects astray from my fair ideal , and more than all , was engaged long ago to the giver of the sapphire ring , I need not enlarge upon my friendship with Peter Green , whom I now began to like in real earnest . Young as he was , his father 's recent death had placed him at the head of a leading mercantile house , Green , Vowler , and Green , of Little Distaff Lane . And young as he was — not more than seven - and - twenty — his manners were formed , and his character and opinions fixed , as if he had seen all the ways , and taken stock of the sentiments of all the civilised world . Present to him any complexity , any conflict of probabilities , any maze whose ins and outs were abroad half over the universe , and if the question were practical , he would see what to do in a moment ; if it were theoretical , he would quietly move it aside . I have known many learned judges sum up a case most lucidly , blow away all the verbiage , sweep aside all the false issues , balance the contradictions , illuminate all the obscurities , and finally lift from its matrix , and lay in the colourless sunlight the virgin truth , without either dross or polish . All this Peter Green seemed to have done in a moment , without any effort , without any reasoning process ; not jumping at his conclusion , but making it fly to him . He possessed what an ancient writer , once highly esteemed at Oxford , entitles the "
148666	148672	148161	148164	STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN	574	" which confers and comprises the "

148712	148905	148161	148164	STORY OF EDGAR VAUGHAN	574	" Excuse my harsh translation , perhaps it is better than paraphrase . With all these business qualities , my friend was as merry and unpretentious a man as ever made a bad joke , or laughed at another fellow 's ; liberal also , warm - hearted , and not sarcastic . In a word , he was a genuine specimen of the noble English merchant , who has done more to raise this country in the esteem of the world than would a thousand Nelsons or Wellingtons . Now this man discerned at a glance the wretched defects of my nature and position . An active mind like his could never believe in the possibility of being happy without occupation . And by occupation he meant , not the chasing of butterflies , or maundering after foxes , but real honest Anglo - Saxon work ; work that strings the muscles , or knits the hemispheres of the brain . And work he would himself , ay , and with all his energies . Not the man was he to tap the table with his pipe , and cry out , "
148926	149469	149476	149476	Vaughan	293	" but he was the man to throw off his coat , and pitch into the matter before him without many words , though with plenty of thought . Now , this man , feeling deeply indebted to me , and beginning to like me as my apathy and reserve went to pieces before his energy , this man , I say , cast about for some method of making me useful and happy . Wonderfully swift as he was in pouncing upon the right thing , I believe it took him at least five minutes to find out the proper course for an impracticable fellow like me . And when he had found this out , it took even him a week to draw the snail out of his hole . Years of agreeable indolence , and calm objective indifference , seldom ruffled except at fashionable snobbery , had made of me not a Sybarite , or a supercilious censor , much less a waiter on fortune , but a contemplative islander , a Haytian who had been once to Spain , and would henceforth be satisfied with the view of her caravels . But my Adelantado was a man of gold and iron . Green , Vowler , and Green were largely concerned in the oil and dried fruit business . They had ransacked the olive districts of continental Europe , and found the price going up and the quality going down , so they wanted now to open another oil vein . Peter Green observing my love of uncultured freedom , the only subject on which I ever grew warm and rapturous , espied the way to relieve me of some nonsense , give my slow life a fillip , and perhaps — oh climax — open a lucrative connexion . He knew , for he seemed to know everything done or undone by commerce , that there was a glorious island rich in jewels and marble and every dower of nature , and above all teeming with olives , lemons , and grapes , and citrons ; and that this gifted island still remained a stranger , through French and Genoese ignorance , to our London trade . This was the island libelled by Seneca , idolised by its natives , drenched with more blood than all the plains of Emathia , yet mother of heroes and conquerors of the world — if that be any credit — in a single word , Corsica . Once or twice indeed our countrymen have attempted to shake hands with this noble race , so ruined by narrow tradition ; and in the end we shall doubtless succeed , as we always do ; but the grain of the Corsican is almost as stubborn as our own . In fact the staple is much the same , the fabric is very different . Bold they are , and manly , simple , generous , and most hospitable , lovers too of their country beyond all other nations ; but — oh fatal ignorance — industry to them is drudgery ; and labour is an outrage . Worse than all is the fiend of the island , the cursed Blood - revenge . "

150338	150436	150437	150437	Ned	574	" To be brief , I received very clear instructions in writing , and was off for Bonifazio the following week , in a small swift yacht of my own , a luxury to which I had always aspired , and which I could now for a time afford . But before I went , your poor father , Clara , protested most strongly against the scheme , and even came to London in the vain hope of dissuading me . He had some deep presentiment that it would end darkly , and so indeed it did . "
150439	150445	150437	150437	Ned	574	" said he once more , "
150586	151334	150580	150580	I	0	" Ah , me ! If I had only listened to him . And yet , I do n't know . After a pleasant voyage we reached the magnificent island , about the middle of May. My intention was to skirt round it from the southern extremity , taking the western side first , and touching at every anchorage , whence I would make incursions , and return to my little cutter , as the most convenient head - quarters . Of course I should have to rough it ; but what young man would think twice of that , with an adventurous life before him ? I will not weary you , my dear child , with a long description of Corsica . It is a land which combines all the softness and the majesty , all the wealth and barrenness , all the smile and menace of all the world beside . I could talk of it by the hour ; but you want to know what I did , and was done to , more than what I saw . From the awful rock of Bonifazio , the streets where men should have no elbows , and the tower of Torrione , along the fantastic coast which looks as if time were a giant rabbit , we traced the blue and spur - vexed sea , now edged with white , and now with gray , and now with glowing red , until we reached that paradise of heaven , the garden of Balagna . Let me hold myself . Weak as I am and crippled by premature old age , not the shortness of my breath , not the numbness of my heart , not even the palsy of my frame , can quench or check the fire rekindled by the mere name of that heavenly valley . To live there only half a minute is worth a day of English life . Life — it is a space to measure , not by pendulum or clock - hand , not by our own strides to and fro ( the ordnance scale of the million ) , not even by the rolling sun , and nature 's hail and farewell ; but by the well - spring of ourselves , the fount of thought and feeling . Every single breath I draw of this living air — air the bride of earth our sire , wedded to him by God Creator , air whose mother - milk we fight for in clusters baulking one another — every breath I draw dances with a buoyant virtue , sucked , in any other land , but from mountain nipples . Bright air of a rosy blue , where northern eyes are dazed with beauty , where every flower cuts stars of light , and every cloud is sunshine 's step ; can even lovers parted thus believe themselves divided ? Every rock has its myrtle favour , every tree its clematis wreath ; under the cistus and oleander hides the pink to lace its bodice , watched by the pansy 's sprightly eye . Lavishly , as children 's bubbles , hover overhead oranges , and citrons , lemons , almonds , figs , varied by the blushing peach and the purpling grape . Far behind , and leaning forth the swarthy bosom of the mountain , whose white head leans on the heaven , are ranks on ranks of glaucous olive , giants of a green old age dashed with silver gray . And oh , the fragrance under foot , the tribute of the ground , which Corsica 's great son — as we men measure greatness — pined for in the barren isle , where the iron of his selfishness entered his own soul . These are said to be the largest olive - trees in the world , and of the very best varieties . Heaps upon heaps the rich fruit lies at the foot of the glorious tree ; nature is too bountiful for man to heed her gifts . For this district of Balagna , and that of Nebbio further north , my attention had been especially bespoken by my shrewd and sagacious friend . Therefore and by reason of the charms around me , here I resolved to pass the summer ; so my vessel was laid up at Calvi , and being quartered in Belgodere at a little Inn—"locanda
151335	151482	151488	151494	Law the second to live by robbery	3513	" it should be called , but I hate interlarding — I addressed myself right heartily to business and to pleasure . First I had to study the grand Palladian gift . Unless old Seneca was , as the Corsicans say , a great liar , he can not have been the author of that epigram which declares this land a stranger to the peaceful boon . It is impossible to believe that a country so adapted to that tree , so often colonized by cultured races , can have been so long ungifted with its staff of life . The island itself in that same epigram is utterly mis - described . As regards the inhabitants , the first line of the well - known couplet is verified by ages ; to the second it does not plead guilty now , and probably never did . "
151509	152288	150580	150580	I	0	" The Corsicans , on the contrary , have always been famous for candour , whose very soul is truth , and for superstition , the wen or hump of religion . For my own part , loving not that unprincipled fellow hard labour , towards whom these noble islanders entertain a like antipathy , and loving much any freedom not hostile to my own , I got on with the natives admirably , for a certain time . Time had reconciled me to their custom of carrying , instead of cane or umbrella , long double - barrelled guns , whose muzzle they afford the stranger full opportunity of inspecting . First - rate marksmen are they , but they sling their guns at hap - hazard on their backs , and cheek to jowl we come upon the cold metal at the corner of the narrow streets . Tall and powerful men they are , especially the mountaineers ; with all the Spaniard 's dignity and the Italian 's native grace . The women are lithe , erect , and beautifully formed , with a swan - like carriage , and a free and courteous bearing , such as very few of our high - born damsels own . The olive - growers frankly gave me all their little information about that tree whose typical virtues they have never cared to learn . The variety chiefly grown , or rather which chiefly grows itself , is one they call the Genoese . The owners afford them very little culture , and many are too idle even to collect the fruit . There are said to be ten million olive - trees in the island ; at least they were reckoned up to that number by order of the Government ; then the enumerators grew tired , and left off counting . Whatever number there is might easily be tripled , if any one had the energy to graft the oleasters , with which the hills are covered . There is also the Saracen olive , and the Sabine , the latter perhaps the Regia of Columella , Raggiaria of Cæsalpinus , and Radius of Virgil . However , though not unlike my sample fruit , it was not quite identical , and as my employers wanted a very special sort for very special qualities , I was as far from my object as ever . One magnificent summer evening , as I rode along the mountain side near the village of Speloncato , suddenly the track turned sharply into a wooded dingle . Steeped in the dream of nature 's beauty , I was thinking of nothing at all , as becomes a true Corsican , when I received a sharpish knock in the eye . Something fell and lodged in my capacious beard . Smarting from the pain . I caught it , and not being able to see clearly , took it at first for a spent and dropping bullet . But when my eyes had ceased to water , I found in my hand a half - grown olive of the very kind I had so long been seeking . I drew forth some of my London specimens which had been chemically treated to prevent their shrivelling , and compared it narrowly . Yes , there could be no doubt ; the same pyriform curve , the same bulge near the peduncle , the same violet lines in the skin , and when cut open , the same granulation and nucleus . I was truly delighted , at length I should be of some real service ; at least if there were many trees here of this most rare variety . By riding up the dingle , I soon ascertained that it was planted with trees of this sort only , gray old trees of a different habit from any other olive . Afterwards I found that it requires a different soil , and a different aspect . Full speed I galloped back to the hamlet of Speloncato , and inquired for the owner of this olive Eldorado . Signor Dezio Della Croce , owner of all this lovely slope , and of large estates extending as far as the road to Corte ; in fact the chief proprietor of the neighbourhood . He was , said the peasant with some pride , a true descendant of the great race of Cinarca , foremost in the island annals for a thousand years , and of whom was the famous Giudice Della Rocca , Count and Judge of Corsica , six hundred years ago . "
152321	154417	152315	152315	he	590	" Let the Cinarchesi blood go for its full value ; but it was worth something to the Della Croce to be descended also from the Tuscan Malaspina ; for the lands of those great Marquises were now in the possession of the Signor Dezio . And the Signor had such a daughter , a young maiden . Ah , Madonna ! The loveliest girl in Corsica . And the vine - dresser crossed himself . As I listened to all this information , I began to look through my unused credentials , which I always carried . It struck me that this name of Della Croce was quite familiar to me , though I knew not how , until a letter in the sprawling hand of young Laurence Daldy fell out from among Peter 's crabbed characters . Laurence Daldy , my mother 's younger son , was now in full career , as a pigeon and a Guardsman , spending at full gallop his dead father 's money . These Daldys were of Italian origin , the true name being D'Aldis , which after some years of English life they had naturalised into Daldy . And now I recollected that when we Vaughan boys scorned them as ignoble sons of commerce , they used to brag about their kinship to the ancient Della Croce . Riding up the forest hill , on whose western bluff stands boldly the gray old tower of the Malaspinas , I began of course to make forecasts about the character of my host . My host I knew he needs must be , for Corsica is of all the world the most hospitable spot . Although by this time well acquainted with the simple island habits , I could not but expect to find a man of stateliness and surroundings , of stiffness and some arrogance . Now the sun was setting , and the western fire from off the sea glanced in spears of reddening gold into the solemn timeworn keep . All things looked majestic , but a deal too lonely . Where was I to apply , how was I to get in ? The narrow doorway overhung with the wreck of some portcullis , was blocked instead with a sort of mantlet like the Roman Vinea ; the loopholes on the ground - tier were boarded almost to the top , the high windows , such as they were , had their rough shutters closed . Everything betokened a state of siege and fear . Two or three magnificent chesnuts , which must have commanded the front of the tower , had been cut down and added to the defences of the approach . Over these I managed at last to leap my horse , who was by no means a perfect hunter ; and there I halted at a loss how to proceed . I had been long enough in Corsica to know , even without a certain ominous gleam from a loophole , and the view in transverse section of a large double - barrelled gun , that the owner of this old mansion was now in the pleasant state of Vendetta . Expecting every moment to be shot , and nothing said about it , I waved my letter , as a white flag , furiously above my head . Presently that frightful muzzle was withdrawn , and the slide pushed back , to reconnoitre me at leisure . I tried , for the first time in my life , to look like a real Briton ; my Corsican ambition was already on the wane . So I sat my horse , and waited ; and what came was worth a thousand years of waiting . Round the bastion of the tower , under the rich magnolia bloom , towards me glided through the rosy shadow the loveliest being that ever moved outside the gates of heaven . She seemed not to walk but waft along , like the pearly Nautilus . A pink mandile of lightest gauze lit the sable of her clustering hair , and wreathing round her graceful head deepened the tinge of the nestling cheeks . The lithe faldetta of white cashmere , thrown hastily over the shoulders , half concealed the flowing curves of the slender supple form , half betrayed them as it followed every facile motion . But when she smiled — oh , Clara , I would have leaped from her father 's tower , or into the black caves of the Restonica , for one smile of hers . The dark - fringed lustre of her eyes seemed to dance with golden joy , trusting , hoping , loving all things , pleasure pleased at pleasing . And the gleesome arch of her laughing lips , that never shaped evil word ! Oh , my Lily , my own Lily , I shall see you soon again . My dear Clara , I ought to know better . I am ashamed of myself . And after so many years ! But at the first glance of Fiordalisa , my fate was fixed for this life and the other . I never had loved before . I never had cared to look at a girl ; in fact I despised them all . Now I paid for that contemptuous folly . Loving at one glance , loving once , for all , for ever , my heart stood still like the focus of a hurricane ; my speech and every power but that of vision failed me . I dared not try to leave the saddle , such a trembling took me . It was a visitation unknown in our foggy plains , scoffed at by our prosy race , but known full well in Southern climes , as the sunstroke of love . My own darling — I can call her nothing less — my own delicious darling was quite startled at me . Whether she had a like visitation in a milder form , is more than I can say ; but I hope with all my heart she had ; for then , as the Southern tale recites , God placed her hand in mine . How I got my horse tied up , how I followed her through the side entrance , and returned her father 's greeting , I have not the least idea ; all I know is that she smiled , and I wanted nothing more . But I could not bear to see her in the true Homeric fashion still maintained in Corsica , waiting on us like a common servant , with her beautiful arched feet glancing under the brown pelone , and her tapering white arms laid demurely on her bosom ; then at her father 's signal how she flew for the purple grapes or the fragrant broccio ! But do what she would , it seemed to become her more than all she had done before . As that form of love and elegance flitted through the simple room , and those lustrous heavenly eyes beamed with hospitable warmth , Signor Dezio Della Croce , careworn man with beard of snow , seemed at times no little proud of his sweet and only child , but was too proud to show his pride . As for me , he must have thought that I spoke very poor Italian . Child Clara , for your own dear sake , as well as mine and my sweet love 's , I will not dwell on that tempestuous time . If you can not comprehend it without words , no words will enable you . If you can , and I fear you do , no more words are wanted ; and , as an old man weary of the world , I know not whether to envy or to pity you . Hither and thither I was flung , to the zenith star of ecstasy or the nadir gulf of agony , according as my idol pet chose to smile or frown . Though she was no silly child , but a girl of mind and feeling , she had a store , I must confess , of clouds as well as dazzling sunlight in the empyrean of her eyes . Her nature , like my love , was full of Southern passion . It is like the air they breathe , the beauty they behold . One minute of such love compresses in a thunder flood all the slow emotions stealing through the drought - scrimped channel , where we dredge for gold deposits , through ten years of Saxon courtship . Instead of Lily - bloom , she should have been called the Passion - flower . My life , my soul — how weak our English words are — she loved me from the first , I can take my oath she did , although her glory was too great for her to own it yet , though now and then her marvellous eyes proved traitors . Sometimes when she was racking me most , feigning even , with those eyes cast down , her pellucid fingers point to point , and her little foot tapping the orchid bloom , feigning , I say , in cold blood , to reckon her noble lovers — long names all and horribly hateful to me — suddenly , while I trembled , and scowled like a true - born Briton , suddenly up would leap the silky drooping lashes , and a spring of soft electric light would flutter through them to the very core of my heart . As for me , I abandoned myself . I made no pretence of waiting a moment . I flung my heart wide open to her , and if she would not come in , desert it should be for ever . She did come . That life - blood of my soul came in , and would and could live nowhere else for ever . It was done like this . One August evening , when the sun was sinking , and the air was full of warmth and wooing sounds , the cicale waking from his early nap , the muffro leaping for the first dew - drop , the love - birds whispering in the tamarind leaves , Fiordalisa sat with me , under a giant cork - tree on the western slope . The tower was still in Vendetta siege , and the grave and reverend Signor knew better than to come out , when the Sbirri were gone to the town . Lily - bloom was sitting by me in a mass of flowers ; her light mandile was laid by , that her glorious hair might catch the first waft of the evening breeze . All down her snow - white shoulders fell the labyrinth of tresses , twined by me with red Tacsonia , and two pale carnations . Her form was pillowed in rich fern , that feathered round her waist ; of all the fronds and plumes and stems , not one so taper , light , and rich as that . The bloom upon her cheeks was deepened by my playing with her hair , and her soft large eyes were beaming with delicious wonder . We knew , as well as He who made us , that we loved one another . None who did not love for ever could interchange such looks . Suddenly , and without a word , in an ecstasy of admiration , I passed my left arm round her little waist , drew her close to me — she was very near before — and looking full into her wondrous eyes , found no protest but a thrill of light ; then tried her lips and met her whole heart there . Darling , how she kissed me ! No English girl can do it . And then the terror of her maiden thoughts . The recollection of her high - born pride , and higher because God - born innocence . How she wept , and blushed , and trembled ; trembled , blushed , and wept again ; and then vouchsafed one more entrancing kiss , to atone for the unwitting treason . Even thus I would not be content . I wanted words as well . "
154434	154435	154419	154419	you	3515	" "
154450	154860	154419	154419	you	3515	" And it was true . And so it was with me . I told her father that same night . And now in the heaven of gladness and wild pleasure , beyond all dreams of earth , opened the hell of my wickedness and crime ; which but for mercy and long repentance would sever me from my Lily in the world to come . To some the crime may seem a light one , to me it is a most atrocious sin , enhanced tenfold by its awful consequences . By my crime , I do not mean my sinful adoration , as cold men may call it , of a fellow mortal . Nature has no time to waste , and unless she meant my Lily to be worshipped , she would not have lavished all her skill in making her so divine . No , I mean my black deceit , in passing for my brother . Oh , Clara , do n't go from me . Like many another ruinous sin , it was committed without thought , or rather without deliberation . No scheme was laid , not even the least intention cherished ; but the moment brought it , and the temptation was too great . Who could have that loving pet gazing at him so , and not sell his soul almost to win her to his arms ? Laurence Daldy was a lazy ass . I do not want to shift my blame to him , but merely state a fact . If he had not been a lazy ass , your father would be living now — ay , and my Fiordalisa . When he chose , he could write very good Italian , and a clear , round hand , and oh , rare accomplishment for an officer , he could even spell . But his letter to Signor Dezio , scrawled betwixt two games of pool , was a perfect magpie 's nest of careless zigzag , wattles , and sand slap - dash . In those days a hasty writer used to flick his work with sand , which stanched but did not dry the ink . The result was often a grimy dabble , like a child 's face blotched with blackberries . Lily and I had quite arranged how we should present ourselves . Like two children we rehearsed it under the twilight trees . "
154867	154873	154874	154874	I	0	" my sweet love whispered , "
154927	154928	154930	154930	you	3517	" "
154951	154952	154937	154937	I	0	" "
154956	155167	154937	154937	I	0	" she always called me from the moment she confessed her love ; and so , no doubt , she is calling me now in heaven . The curtain hung in heavy folds across the narrow doorway of the long dark room . The hospitable board was gay with wine and dainty fruit , melons , figs , and peaches , plums of golden and purple hue , pomegranates , pomi d'oro , green almonds , apricots , and muscatels from the ladders of Cape Corso . Through them and upon them played the mellow light from a single lamp , with dancing lustres round it . All the rest of the room was dark . At the head of the table sat Signor Dezio Della Croce , waiting for his guest and daughter . Posted high at the end window on a ledge of rough - hewn board , stood the ancient warder , who had lived for fifty years among them , and whose great fusil commanded the only approach to the castle . As we entered timidly , the maiden 's right hand on my neck , my left arm round her ductile waist , our other hands clasped firmly , I glanced toward that noxious sentinel . "
155196	155292	155190	155190	he	3522	" Signor Dezio looked amazed , as we glided towards him . His life had been one series of crushing blows from heaven . Three brave sons had been barbarously murdered in Vendetta , and his graceful loving wife had broken her heart and died . The sole hope of his house , his petling Fiordalisa , though she called herself a woman and was full sixteen , he looked upon her still in his trouble - torn chronology , as only ripe enough to be dandled on his lap . Still he called her his "
155295	155510	155190	155190	he	3522	" and sang nannas to her , as he had been obliged to do after her mother 's death . As he sat there , too astonished to smile , or frown , or say a word , Lily dropped upon her knees before him , as a Grecian maiden would . We English are not supple - jointed ; but for Lily 's sake , I could not stand beside her . Then she placed her soft right hand in the centre of my hard palm , flung the other arm round my neck , and with her eyes upon her father 's , gave me a long affectionate kiss . This done , she drew her father 's head down , and kissed his snow - white beard . Now , she told me , after this , any father who is obdurate , must according to institution blame himself and no one else , if harm befall the maiden . All this time , I spoke not , and thought of nothing except to screen my Lily . Signor Dezio kept a stately silence , but the tears were in his eyes , and the long white beard was quivering . Lily bent her head , and waited for his words . "

155675	155719	155662	155663	the Spalla	171	" And up sprang Fiordalisa , flew to an inner room , and fetched from the dark niche in the wall the box of holy relics . With these she knelt before her father , and placed her right hand on the box . "
155745	155962	155738	155738	you	1549	" The old chief bowed his head in thought . He had lost his last surviving son by neglecting the Spalla 's decree . The Spalla is the shoulder blade of a goat , polished , and used for divination ; upon it had been read Sampiero 's death , and the destiny of Napoleon . The old man who had forecast the latter was still alive , and of immense renown , and traversed the island now like an ancient prophet . He was the hoary goatherd of Ghidazzo . Lily saw that she was conquering ; she leaped upon her father 's knee and hugged him ; and her triumph was complete . While she wept upon his breast , and told him all her little tale , and whispered in his ear , and while he kissed , and comforted her , and thought of her dear mother , I rushed out and leaped the Vinea , and wept beneath the olive - trees . At last the old man rose and called me , he durst not venture from the door ; but he did what was far better , he sent my own love after me . At length when we returned , and we found cause not to hurry , — "
155966	155970	155963	155964	Signor Vogheno	605	" he began , "
155984	155993	155979	155984	a man of very keen observation"—Lily	8071	observation"—Lily 's eyes gave me a twinkle full of fun—"or
156124	156125	156156	156157	Signor beloved	3543	" "
156130	156153	156156	156157	Signor beloved	3543	" was on my lips , but Lily 's glance just saved it . And I thought of his three brave sons . "
156206	156248	156193	156193	she	3524	" I saw nothing of the sort , but a blooming maiden figure , growing lovelier every day . Poor Lily dropped her long eyelashes , and smiled through a glowing blush . So blushed Lavinia under the eyes of Turnus . "
156361	156431	156433	156433	mine	3559	" He looked at me inquiringly . Instead of explaining that I was only the brother of the great Signor Valentino , I bowed , alas I bowed with a hot flush on my cheeks . What could it matter , and why should I interrupt him , if he chose to deceive himself ? Lily charmed away all hesitation , by clapping her little hands , and crying , "
156440	156441	156435	156435	I	0	" "
156562	156886	156534	156535	my flower	3565	" A load of terror was off my heart — I thought he was going to bind me to the accursed Vendetta . Even for my Lily , I could hardly have taken that pledge . So I assented readily to the last stipulation , though it was based upon a virtual lie of mine . But with Lily 's eyes upon me , brimming as they were with tears at the first condition , and her round arms trembling to enfold me , could I stick at anything short of downright murder ? The first proviso I fought against in vain . Even Lily coaxed and cried , without any good effect . When at last we yielded to the stern decree , the venerable father , as we knelt before him , joined our hands together , and poured a blessing on us , which I did not lack . He had given me my blessing . After this we sat down to supper , and the trusty musketeer , who had watched the whole scene grimly , and without hearing all , knew what the result was , he , I say , upon his perch began to improvise , or haply to adapt , and sing to a childish air , some little verses upon the glad occasion . Having exhausted his stock , down he leaped without permission , and drank our health in a bumper of Luri wine . Lily was now in due course of promotion . No longer was she the handmaid , whose eyes created and rejoiced in countless mistakes of mine . Now she was sitting by my side , as she had good right to be , and was lost in pretty raptures at my gallant attentions . They were very nice , she owned , but thoroughly un - Corsican . How I wished her father and the old fusileer away ! "
156907	156908	156903	156905	some lovelier maiden	3568	" "
156926	156947	156923	156923	I	0	" She showed a small stiletto toy with a cross upon the handle , and ground her pearly teeth together . "
156957	156958	156962	156962	Lily	606	" "
156965	156966	156962	156962	Lily	606	" "
156983	156984	156962	156962	Lily	606	" "
157003	157092	156987	156987	you	0	" And so we spent the precious time,—ten days allowed me to prepare my yacht — in talking utter nonsense , and conning fifty foolish schemes , to make us seem together . I was for departing at once , that the period might begin to run ; but Lily was for keeping me to the last possible moment , and of course she had her way . It was fixed that I should sail on the 10th day of September . My little boat , now called the "
157096	159810	156987	156987	you	0	" was brought from Calvi , and moored in a secluded cove , where my love could see it from her bedroom window . It was no longer Corsican law that I should live in the castle . The privileges of a guest were gone ; and the rigorous code of suitorship began . But to me and my own darling it made very little difference . I never left Vendetta tower , as I lightly named it , until my pet was ordered off to bed ; and every morn I climbed the heights , after a long swim in the sapphire ripple , and met my own sweet Lily sparkling from the dew of her early toilet . How she loved me , how I loved her ; which more than other let angels say ; for we could not decide . That ancient Corsican her father , albeit little versed in books , was as upright and downright a gentleman as ever knew when his presence was not required . Therefore he took my word of honour for his Lily 's safety ; and left her to her own sweet will ; and her sweet will was to spend with me all her waking hours . For her as yet there was no fear of the blood - avenger . According to their etiquette they can not shoot the daughter , until they have shot the father . As to the sons the restriction does not hold . The feud we were concerned in had lasted now 120 years , and cost the lives of 130 people . It lay between the ancient races of Della Croce , and De Gentili , and owed its origin to the discovery of a dead mule on the road to church . The question was which family should be exterminated first . For many years the house of Della Croce had been in the ascendant , having produced a long succession of good shots and clever bushmen . At one time all the hopes of the De Gentili hung upon one infant life , which was not thought worth the taking . Fatal error — that one life had proved a mighty trump . One after one the Della Croce fell before that original artist , who invented a patent method of trunking himself in olive bark and firing from a knot - hole . Many a story Lily told me of his devilish wiles ; and in those stories I rejoiced , because she clung around my neck , and trembled so that I must hold her . Happily now this olive - branch was dead , having received his death - wound while he administered one to Lily 's youngest brother . Ever since that , the feud had languished , and strict etiquette required that the Della Croce should perpetrate the next murder . But her father , said my Lily , with her sweet head on my breast and her soft eyes full of fire , her father did not seem to care even to shoot the cousin of the man who had shot her brothers . Darling Lily , my blood runs cold , even with your beauty in my arms , to hear you talk of murder so . Own pet , I shall change you . You heaven meant for love , and softness , and delight : human devilry has tainted even you . It was not an easy task to change her . Of all human passions revenge is far the strongest . Clara , how your eyes flash . You ought to have been a Corsican . It was not an easy task ; but love loves difficulties . In my ten short days of delicious wretchedness , almost I taught Fiordalisa to despise revenge . And what do you think availed me most ? Not the Bible . No , her mind and soul were swathed by Popery in the rags of too many saints . What helped me most , and the only thing that helped me at all , except caresses , was the broad and free expanse of the ever changing sea . Her nature was all poetry , her throbbing breast an Idyl . Upon my little quarter - deck I had a cushioned niche for her , and there we sat and steered ourselves while the sailors slept below . Alone upon the crystal world , pledged for life or death together , drinking deepest draughts of passion and thirsting still for more , what cared we for petty hatreds , we whose all in all was love ? How she listened as I spoke , how her large eyes grew enlarged . At last those eyes , pure wells of love , were troubled with hot tears . The fatal day was come . Tokens we had interchanged , myriad vows , and countless pledges , which even love could scarce remember . With all the passion of her race , and all the fervour of the clime , she bared her beautiful round arm , the part that lay most near the heart and touched it with the keen stiletto , then she threw her breast on mine , and I laid the crimsoned ivory on my lips . How the devil — excuse me , Clara — how the devil I got away , only phlegmatic Englishmen can tell . No Frenchman , or Italian , would have left that heavenly darling so . We put it off to the last moment , till it was quite dangerous to pass the rocky jaws . As my bad luck would have it , there was a purpling sunset breeze . My own love on the furthest point , her white feet in the water , growing smaller and smaller yet , and standing upon tiptoe to be seen for another yard ; my own darling love of ages , she loosed her black hair down her snowy vest , for me to know her from the rocks behind ; then she waved and waved her sweet palm hat , fragrant of my Lily,—I had kissed every single inch of it,—until she thought I could not see her ; and then , as my telescope showed me , back she fell upon a ledge of rocks , and I could see or fancy her delicious bosom heaving to the fury of her tears . We glided past the cavern mouth , and the silver beach beyond it , whence we had often watched the sunset ; and then a beetling crag took from me the last view of Lily . However long the schoolboy may have bled from some big coward 's bullying , or the sway of the rustling birch and the bosky thrill that follows , however sore he may have wept while hung head - downwards through the midnight hours , with a tallow candle between his teeth , or in the pang of nouns heteroclite and brachycatalectic dinners ; yet despite these minor ills , his fond heart turns through after life to the scene of foot - ball and I - spy , to the days when he could jump or eat any mortal thing . And so it is with bygone love . Even the times of separation or of bitter quarrel , the aching heart whereon the keepsake lies , the spasms of jealousy , the tenterhooks of doubt ; remembrance looks upon them all as treasures of a golden age . Over the darkening sea , we bore away for Sardinia . Hours and hours , I gazed upon the cushions , where my own pet darling used to lean and love me . To me they were fairer than all the stars , or the phosphorescent sea . From time to time our Corsican pilot kept himself awake , by chanting to strangely mournful airs some of the voceros or dirges , the burden of many ages in that lamenting land . Fit home for Rachel , Niobe , or Cassandra , where half a million gallant beings , twice the number of the present population , have fallen victims to the blood - revenge . So Corsican historians tell ; a thousand violent deaths each year , for the last five centuries . Sometimes the avenger waits for half a lifetime , lurking till his moment comes . Before his victim has ceased to quiver , or the shot to ring down the rocky pass , he is off for the bush or the mountains , and leads thenceforth a bandit 's life . They tell me , Clara , that things are better now , and this black stain on a chivalrous race is being purged by Christian civilization . Be it as it may , I love the island of my Lily still ; and hope , please God , to see it once more , before I go to her . Banished though I was , for the present , from the only place I cared for , it seemed still greater severance to go further than I could help . Therefore instead of returning to England , I spent the winter in cruising along the western coast of Italy , and the south of Spain ; and coasted back to Genoa . To Seville , and other places famed for beautiful women , I made especial trips , to search for any fit to compare with my own maiden . Of course I knew none could be found ; but it gave me some employment , and bitter pleasure , to observe how inferior were all . To my eyes , bright with one sweet image , no other form had grace enough to be fit pillow for my charmer 's foot . How I longed and yearned for some fresh token of her : all her little gifts I carried ever in my bosom , but never let another 's eyes rest one moment on them . Not even would I tell my friends one word about my love ; it seemed as if it would grow common by being talked about . To Peter Green I wrote , resigning my commission , although I did not tell him that I had found the olives . No , friend Peter , those olives are much too near my Lily ; and I wo n't have you or any other stranger there . I know she would not look at you ; still I would rather have you a thousand miles away . Free trade , if you like , when I have made my fortune ; which by the bye is somewhat the maxim of that school . My fortune , not in olives , oil , or even guineas — all that rubbish you are welcome to — but my fortune where my heart and soul are all invested , and now , no more my fortune , but my certain fate in Lily . At length and at last my calendar — like a homesick pair at school , we had made one for each other , thanking God that it was not a leap - year — my calendar so often counted , so punctually erased , began to yield and totter to the stubborn sap of time . My patience long ago had yielded , my blood was in a fever . Another thing began to yield , alas it was my money . Green , Vowler , and Green had behaved most liberally ; but of course the expenses of my vessel had been heavy on me ; and now my salary had ceased . Peter Green wrote to me in the kindest and most handsome manner , pressing me , if tired ( as he concluded ) of those murderous Corsicans , to accept another engagement in Sardinia . Even without imparting my last discovery , I had done good service to the firm . I smiled at the idea of my being weary of Corsicans : even now the mere word sends a warm tide to my heart . It was not for the beauty of the scene , or the works of art , that I remained in Genoa ; but because it was the likeliest place to see the Negro 's head . As we lay at the end of the mole , my glass commanded all that entered ; and every lugger or xebec that bore the sacred emblem — off my little dingy pushed from our raking stern , and with one man , now my friend because a thorough Corsican , I boarded her , at all hazards of imprisonment ; and craved for tidings of the sacred land . Although , of course , I would not show the nest of all my thoughts , yet by beating about the bush , I got some scraps of news . The great Signor was flourishing , and had harvested an enormous crop of olives : his lovely daughter , now becoming the glory of the island , had been ill of something like marsh - fever , but was now as blooming as the roses . They did say , but the captain could not at all believe it , that she had been betrothed to some foreign olive - merchant . What disgrace ! The highest blood and the sweetest maid in Corsica , to be betrayed to an oilman ! Plenty of other news I gathered — the good people are great gossips — but this was all I cared for . Meanwhile your father , Clara dear , replied most warmly to my letter , sending me a sum on loan , which quite relieved me from cheese - paring . And now the wind was in the north , and it was almost time to start for the arms of Lily . If I waited any longer , I should be too mad to bear the voyage . At the break of day we left the magnificent harbour , and the cold wind from the maritime Alps chilled all but the fire of love . Up and down the little deck , up and down all day and night ; sleep I never would again , until I touched my Lily . On the evening of the 8th of March , we were near Cape Corso ; next day we coasted down the west to the lively breeze of spring , and so upon the 9th we moored to the tongue of Calvi . At midnight we were under way , and when the sun could reach the sea over the snowy peaks , we glided past the mountain crescent that looks on the Balagna . In the early morning still , when the dew was floating , we rounded the gray headland of Signor Dezio 's cove , and I climbed along the bowsprit to glance beyond the corner . What is that white dress I see fluttering at the water 's edge ? Whose is that red - striped mandile tossed on high and caught again ? And there the flag - staff I erected , with my colours flying ! Only one such shape on earth — only two such arms — out with the boat or I must swim , or run the yacht ashore . The boat has been towing alongside for the last six hours : Lily ca n't wait for the boat any more than I can . From rock to rock she is leaping ; which is the nearest one ? Into the water she runs , then away in blushing terror — she forgot all about the other men . But I know where to find her , she has dropped her little shoe , she must be in my grotto . There I press her to my heart of hearts , trembling , weeping , laughing , all unable to get close enough to me . "
159824	159833	159834	159834	My	0	" Her voice is like a silver bell . "
159851	160154	159848	159848	you	3572	" If she were lovely when I left her , what shall I call her now ? There is not one atom of her but is pure perfection . I hold her from me for one moment , to take in all her beauties . She has a most delicious fragrance that steals upon my senses . Toilet bottles she never heard of ; what she has is nature 's gift , and unperceived except by love . I have often told her of it , but she wo n't believe it . It is not your breath , you darling ; your breath is only violets ; it comes from every fibre of you , even from your hair ; it is as when the wind has kissed a lily of the valley . The ancient Signor being a man of very keen observation , did not delay our wedding any longer than could be helped . That evening we hauled down the family fusileer , gave him a goblet of wine , and sent him about his business : for one night we would take our chance even of Vendetta . At supper - time the Signor was in wonderful spirits , and drank our health with many praises of our constancy and obedience . One little fact he mentioned worth a thousand propinations ; his daughter 's fever had been cured by some chance news of me . He even went away to fetch a bottle of choicest Rogliano , when he saw how I was fidgetting to get my arm round Lily . Then after making his re - entrance , with due clumsiness at the door , he quite disgraced himself , while drawing the cork , by even winking at me , as he said abruptly , "
160165	160182	160187	160187	you	593	" My Lily blushed , I must confess , but did not fence with the question . "
160201	160605	160196	160197	my love	5792	" But she would not look at me to ask . In the porch she whispered to me , that it was only from her terror of the bad Lepardo coming . Did the loving creature fancy that I would believe it ? Once more we sailed together over the amethyst sea ; she was as fond of the water as a true - born Briton . In her thoughts and glances was infinite variety . None could ever guess the next thing she would say . Thoroughly I knew her heart , because I lived therein , and sweeter lodgings never man was blessed with . But of her mind she veiled as yet the maiden delicacies , strictly as she would the glowing riches of her figure . What amazed me more than all , was that while most Corsican girls are of the nut - brown order , no sun ever burned the snowy skin of Lily : she always looked so clear and clean , as if it were impossible for anything to stain her . Clara , you are always talking of your lovely Isola . I wonder where she got her name : it is no stranger to me . Something in your description of her reminds me of my Lily . I long to see the girl : and you must have some reason for so obstinately preventing me . Though Lily and I were most desirous to keep things as quiet as possible , by this time our engagement was talked of in every house of the Balagna . That paternal fusileer and my merry yachtsmen , although they looked the other way whenever we approached , would not permit the flower of Corsica , as she was now proclaimed , to blush with me unseen . My sailors attended to her far more than to their business , and would have leaped into the water for one smile of Lily . It is the fashion of the island to make a wedding jubilee ; and the Signor was anxious to outdo all that had ever been done . We , absorbed in one another , did our best to disappoint him ; but he scorned the notion of any private marriage . I never shall forget how he knit his silver brows when I made a last attempt to bring him to our views . "
160700	161390	160694	160694	I	0	" The Corsicans are a most excitable race , and , when affronted , seem to lash their sides as they talk . By the time the good Signor had finished his speech , every hair of his beard was curling with indignation . But his daughter sprang into his arms and kissed away the tempest , and promised , if it must be so , to make herself one mass of gold and coral . So the Parolanti , or mediators , were invoked ; an armistice for a week was signed , and honour pledged on either side . Free and haughty was the step of the Signor Dezio as he set forth for the town to order everything he could see ; and very wroth again he was , because I would not postpone the day for him to get a shipload of trumpery from Marseilles . This time I was resolved to have my way . Besides the fervour of my passion and my dread of accidents , the one thing of all others I detest is to be stared at anywhere . And it is far worse to be stared at by a foreign race . The Corsicans are gentlemen by nature , but they could not be expected to regard without some curiosity the lucky stranger who had won their Lily . I will not weary you , as I myself was wearied , with all the ceremonies of the wedding - day . All I wanted was my bride , and she wanted none but me : yet we could not help being touched by the hearty good - will of the commune . The fame of Lily 's beauty had spread even to Sardinia , and many a handsome woman came to measure her own thereby . Clever as they are at such things , not one of them could find a blemish or defect in Lily , and our fair Balagnese told them to go home and break their mirrors . It was a sweet spring morning , and amid a fearful din of guns and trumpets , mandolins and fiddles , I waited with a nervous smile under the triumphal arch in front of my fictitious house . A sham house had been made of boards , and boughs , and flowers , because it is most essential that the bride should be introduced to the bridegroom 's dwelling . Here I was to receive the procession , which at last appeared . First came fifty well - armed youths , crowned with leaves and ribbons ; then four - and - twenty maidens dressed alike , singing and scattering flowers , and then a boy of noble birth , mounted on a pony , and carrying the freno , symbol of many scions . None of them I looked at ; only for my Lily . On a noble snow - white palfrey , decked from head to foot with flowers , her father walking at her side , came the bloom , the flower , the lily of them all , arrayed in clear white muslin , self - possessed , and smiling . One glorious wreath was round her head ; it was her own black hair by her own sweet fingers twined with sprigs of myrtle . A sash , or fazoletto , of violet transparent crape , looped at the crown of her head , fell over the shy lift of her bosom , parting like a sunset cloud , where the boddice opened below the pear - like waist . To me she looked like a white coralline rising through an amethyst sea . Behind her came the authorities of the commune . The sham keys were already hanging at her slender zone . It was my place to lift her down and introduce her formally . This I did with excellent grace , feeling the weight of eyes upon me . But when I got her inside , I spoiled the folds of the fazoletto . I heard the old man shouting , "
161449	161450	161453	161454	old fellow	3585	" "
161475	161494	161495	161495	Friends	6702	" One more virgin kiss , and with Lily on my arm , forth I sally to respond . "
161530	161531	161522	161523	the priest	2629	" "
161546	161746	161755	161755	him	3592	" No more delay . The maids have got all they can do to keep in front of us with their flowers . The armed youths stand on either side at the entrance to the church . The tapers are already lit , the passage up the little church is strewed with flowering myrtle . Lily , holding her veil around her , walks hand in hand with me . Fiordalisa Della Croce now is Lily Vaughan ; amidst a world of shouting , shooting , and cornamusas , we are led to the banqueting - room ; there they seat us in two chairs , and a fine fat baby is placed on Lily 's lap , to remind her of her duties . She dandles it , and kisses it as if she understood the business , and then presents it with a cap of corals and gay ribbons . Now Lily Vaughan throws off her fazoletto , and gives me for a keepsake the myrtles in her hair . Then all who can claim kin with her , to the fortieth generation , hurry up and press her hand , and wish the good old wish . "
161762	162183	162184	162186	Fiordalisa Della Croce	593	" After the banquet , we were free to go , having first led off the ballo in the Cerca dance . Thank God , my Lily is at last my own ; she falls upon my bosom weary and delighted . Clara , remember this : the little church in which we were married is called St. Katharine 's on the cliff ; and I signed the record in my proper name , Edgar Malins Vaughan : the Malins , very likely , they did not know from Valentine , for I always wrote it with a flourish at the end . The Signor , with all his friends , escorted us to the limits of his domain ; there we bade them heartily farewell , and they returned to renew the feast . My little yacht was in the bay , and we saw the boat push off to fetch us as had been arranged . We were to sail for Girolata , where the Signor had a country - house , lonely enough even for two such lovers . Three or four hours would take us thither , and the sun was still in the heavens . As no one now could see us , Lily performed a little dance for my especial delight . How beaming she looked , how full of spirits , now all the worry was over . Then she tripped roguishly at my side to the winding rocky steps that lead to St. Katharine 's cove . The cove was like a well scooped in the giant cliffs . As we descended the steep and narrow stairs , my Lily trembled on my arm . The house and all the merry - makers were out of sight and hearing . Of course we stopped every now and then , for the boat could not be at the landing yet , and we had much to tell each other . As we stepped upon the beach , and under the eaves of a jutting rock , a tall man stood before us . His eyes and beard were black as jet , and he wore the loose dress of a Southern seaman . Three sailors , unmistakeably English , were smoking and playing cards in the corner shade of the cliff . Lily started violently , turned pale , and clung to me , but faced the intruder bravely . He was quite amazed at her beauty , I at his insolent gaze . "
162188	162197	162184	162186	Fiordalisa Della Croce	593	" he said with a pure Tuscan accent , "
162208	162239	162201	162201	I	0	" He actually laid his small , but muscular hand upon my Lily 's shoulder . She leaped back as from a snake . I knew it must be Lepardo . "
162242	162252	162201	162201	I	0	" I said , as calmly as I could , "
162262	162287	162201	162201	I	0	" The sneering , supercilious look which he hardly deigned to spare me , was honest , compared to his foul stare at her . "
162316	163451	162314	162314	her	3597	" And he thrust his filthy , hairy lips under my own pet 's hat . My muscles leaped , and my soul was in the blow . Down he went like a flail , and I thought he was stunned for an hour ; but while I was bearing my pet to the boat , which now was close to the beach , up he leaped , and rushed at me with a dagger — a dagger like one which you know . I did not see him , but Lily did over my shoulder ; she sprang from my arms and flung herself between us . He thrust her aside , and leaped at me like a panther , aiming straight at my heart . How he missed me I can not tell , but think it was through Lily . Before he recovered , I closed with him , wrested away the weapon and flung it far into the sea . But one main thing I omitted ; I ought to have stunned him thoroughly . Into the boat with Lily — I caught up an oar , and away we dashed . The three English sailors were running up . As a wave took the boat about , one of them grasped the stern ; down on his knuckles crashed my oar , and with a curse he let go . All right , all clear , off for the yacht for your lives . I would show fight , for my blood is up , but what would become of Lily ? And we are but three against four , and none of us have arms . Meanwhile , that black Italian , I can never call him a Corsican , sneaked away to a tuft of sea - grass for his double - barrelled fusil . Bowing with all my might , I saw him examine the priming , lay his red cap on a rock , and the glistening gun on the cap , and , closing one eye , take steady aim , not at me , but at Lily . Poor Lily sat on the thwart at my side , faintly staring with terror . No time to think ; oar and all I dashed in front of my darling . A ping in the air , a jar on my wrist , a slight blow on my breast , and at my feet dropped the bullet . It had passed through the tough ash handle . Down , Lily , down , for God 's sake ; he is firing the other barrel . I flung her down in the bilge water ; the brute can not see her now . Not quite so easily off . Up a steep rock he climbed like a cat , the cursed gun still in his hand . He won fifty feet of vantage , and commanded the whole of the boat . We were not eighty yards away . There he coolly levelled at my prostrate Lily . I had grey hairs next morning . Forward , I threw myself , over my wife ; me he might kill if he chose . One lurch of the boat — a short sea was running — and my darling 's head was shown . He saw his chance and fired . Thank God , he had too little powder in ; my own love is untouched . The ball fell short of Lily , and passed through my left foot , in at the sole and out below the instep . Luckily I had retained my dancing shoes , or my thick boots would have kept the ball in my foot . The brute could not see that he had hit any one , and he cursed us in choice Italian . Poor Lily had quite swooned away , and knew nothing of my wound . Over the side of the yacht I lifted her myself , standing upon one leg . No one else should touch her . So furious I was with that cold - blooded miscreant , that if I could only have walked , I would have returned to fight him . My men , too , were quite up for it . But when Lily came to herself , and threw her arms round me and wept , and thanked God and her saints , I found my foot quite soaked in a pool of blood , and stiffening . Poor little dear ! what a fuss she did make about it ! I would have borne ten times the pain for the smiles and tears she gave me . One thing was certain — under the mercy of God , we owed our lives to each other , and held them henceforth in common . As , with a flowing sheet , we doubled the craggy point , concealed close under the rocks we saw a low and snake - like vessel , of the felucca build . She was banked for three pair of sweeps , and looked a thorough rover . This was , of course , Lepardo 's boat . We now bore away for Ajaccio , dear Lily having implored me not to think of Girolata , where no medical aid could anyhow be procured . Moreover , she wanted to fly from that dark Lepardo ; and I am quite willing to own that , despite my delicious nursing , I was not ambitious to stand as target again during our honeymoon . At first I thought a great deal more of the pain than the danger of my wound ; but when I showed it to the French surgeon at Ajaccio , he surprised me by shrugging his shoulders formidably , and declaring that it was the good God if I kept my foot . Being of a somewhat sceptical turn , I thought at first that he only wanted to gild the frame of his work ; but when I began to consider it , I found that he was quite right . The fact was , that I had thought much more of my bride than of my metatarsals . Two of these were splintered where the bullet passed between them , and it was a question whether it had not been poisoned . Many of the mountaineers are skilled in deadly drugs , and use them rarely for the bowl , not so rarely for the sword and gun . At one time there were symptoms even of mortification , and my wife , who waited hand and foot upon me , joined the surgeon in imploring me to submit to amputation . "
163527	163614	163521	163521	we	3600	" As she loved my toes so much , I resolved to keep them , if it was only for her sake ; and , after a narrow crisis , my foot began to get better . To her care and tenderness I owed my recovery , far more than to the skill of the clever surgeon . Six months elapsed before I could walk again , and our little yacht was sent to Calvi to explain the long delay . Fond as I was of the "
163619	163674	163521	163521	we	3600	" I was anxious now to sell her ; but my darling nurse , although she knew before our marriage that I was not a wealthy man , would not listen to the scheme at all ; for the doctor ordered me , as I grew stronger , to be constantly on the water . "
163741	166034	163729	163729	he	425	" Conscious as I was of my vile deceit , I would rather have died than apply to Signor Dezio , albeit I am quite sure that he would soon have forgiven me . So I wrote again to my good - natured brother and banker , and told him all that had happened , but begged him not to impart it even to your mother . I have strong reason for suspecting that he did not conceal it from her ; but as I never alluded to the subject before her , she was too much a lady ever to lead me towards it . My motive for this reserve was at first some ill - defined terror lest my fraud upon Signor Dezio should come to light prematurely . Also I hate to be talked about among people whom I despise . Afterwards , as you will perceive , I had other and far more cogent reasons . I need not say that your father — dear Clara , I ought to love you , if only on his account!—your father wrote me a kind and most warm - hearted letter , accompanied by a most handsome gift — no loan this time , but a wedding - gift , and a very noble one . Also he pressed me to come home with my bride the moment I could endure the voyage . Ah ! if I had only obeyed him , not Lily and Henry , but myself would have been the victim . We returned as soon as possible to Vendetta tower , and found the good Signor in excellent spirits , delighted to see his sweet daughter again , and still more delighted by hope of a little successor to the gray walls and the olive groves . When this hope was realized , and a lusty young grandson was laid in his arms , he became so wild in his glory , that he went about boasting all over the commune , feasting all who came near him , forgetting the very name of the blood - revenge . Many a time we reminded and implored him to be more careful . He replied , that his life was of no importance now ; he had come to his haven among his own dear ones , and was crowning the old ship with flowers . Moreover , he knew that the De ' Gentili were of a nobler spirit than to shed the blood of a gray - haired man , when institution did not very loudly demand it . And so I believe they were . Alas ! the poor old man!—a thorough and true gentleman as one need wish to see — choleric albeit , and not too wide of mind ; but his heart was in the right place , and made of the right material , and easy enough to get at . He was free to confess his own failings , and could feel for a man who was tempted . Deeply thankful I am that , before his white beard was laid low , I acknowledged to him my offence , and obtained his hearty forgiveness . Little Henry was on his lap , going off into smiles of sleep , with his mother 's soft finger in his mouth . At first my confession quite took the poor Signor aback ; for I did not attempt to gloss the dishonour of what I had done ; but I told him truly that the meanness was not in my nature , and although I had won my pet Lily , the road ran through hemlock and wormwood . And now I perceived how uncalled - for and stupid the fraud had been . When the old man recovered a little from the shock caused by the dishonesty — towards which recovery the tears of his daughter and the smiles of his grandson contributed — he was really glad to find that I was not a landed Signor . He rubbed his hands and twitched his beard with delight , for now his little Enrico would never be taken away to the barbarous English island . Was he not rightful successor to the lands of the Della Croce ? and what more could he possibly want ? What could he care for the property in Gloisterio ? However , he made us promise that if the present remarkable baby , Master Henry Vaughan , should ever enjoy the property in the unpronounceable county , Lily 's second child , if she had one , should take the Corsican lordships ; for his great fear was , that the Malaspina and Della Croce estates should become a servient tenement to the frozen fields of the North . To express and ensure his wishes , he had a deed - poll prepared according to his own fancy , read it to us and some witnesses , then signed , sealed , and enrolled it . This was one of the documents which you , my brave Clara , rescued from that vile , stealthy ghost . And now , for a short time , we enjoyed deep , quiet , delicious happiness . The crime which had haunted me was confessed and forgiven . Amply possessed of the means , and even the abundance of life , I was blessed with strong health again , and freedom among the free . Richest and best of all blessings , I had a sweet , most lovely , and most loving wife , and loved her once and for all . No more beautiful vision has any poet imagined than young Lily Vaughan sitting under the vine - leaves , her form more exquisite than ever , her soft - eyed infant in her lap wondering at his mother 's beauty , while her own deep - lustred eyes carried to her husband 's , without the trouble of thinking , all that flowed into her heart — joy at belonging to him , hope of bliss to come , fear of over - happiness , pride in all the three of us , and shame at feeling proud . Then a gay coquettish glance , as quick youth warms the veins , and some humorous thought occurs , a tickle for the baby , and a feint of cold - shouldering me . But , jealous as I was , desperately jealous , for my love was more passionate than ever , I can honourably state that Lily 's one and only trial to arouse my jealousy was an ignominious failure , recoiling only on the person of the dear designer . However exacting little Harry might be , I never grudged him his double share of attention . In the first place I looked upon him as a piece of me , still holding on ; and , in the next place , I knew that all he laid claim to was only a loan to him , and belonged in fee simple to his father . At this time I wrote to my brother again , announcing the birth of our boy , and that we had made him his namesake ; dispensing , too , with all further reserve on the subject of our marriage . This letter was never delivered to your dear father . That much I know , for certain ; and at one time I strongly suspected that our cold - blooded , crafty foe contrived to intercept it . But no ; if he had , he would have known better afterwards . After that cowardly onslaught upon my bride and myself , I had of course learned all I could of the history of this Lepardo . He was the only son of the Signor 's only brother , but very little was known of him in the neighbourhood , as he came from Vescovato on the east side of the island . He was said to have great abilities and very great perseverance , and under the guardianship of his uncle had been intended and partly educated for the French Bar . But his disposition was most headstrong and sullen ; and at an early age he displayed a ferocity unusual even in a Corsican . Neither had he the great redeeming trait of the islanders , I mean their noble patriotism . One good quality , however , he did possess , and that was fidelity to his word . With one of the contradictions so common in human nature , he would even be false in order to be true : that is , he would be treacherous wherever he was unpledged , if it assisted him towards a purpose to which he was committed . While he was yet a boy , his intended career was cut short by an act of horrible violence . He disliked all the lower animals , horses and mules especially ; and one day he was detected by a master of the Paoli College , screaming , and yelling at , and lashing , from a safe distance , a poor little pony whom he had tied to a fence . The master , an elderly man , very humane and benevolent , rebuked him in the most cutting manner , and called him a low coward . The young villain ran off , with his eyes flashing fire , procured a stiletto , and stabbed the poor man in the back . Then he leaped on the horse he had been ill - treating , and pricking him with the dagger , rode away furiously in the direction of Bastia . The pursuers could not trace him through the wild mountain district , but it was believed that he reached the town and took refuge in an English brig , which was lying off the harbour , and sailed for Genoa that evening . The pony was found dead , lying by the roadside with the brute 's dagger in its throat . No wonder Lily , who told me all this , with true Corsican rage in her eyes , no wonder my Lily hated him . Even as a little girl , for she was but ten years old when he disappeared , she always felt a strong repugnance towards him . He was about six years older than Fiordalisa , and four years younger than I ; so when he shot at Lily , he must have been three - and - twenty . It was reported that after his disappearance he took to a sea - faring life , and made himself very useful , by his knowledge of languages , in the English merchant service . Quarrelling with his employers , he was said to have resorted to smuggling in the Levant , if not to downright piracy . Clara , for reasons I can not explain , I wish you to follow my story step by step in its order , noting each landing - place . To do this with advantage , you must have the dates carved upon each of the latter : therefore I beg you to copy them as you pass . I arrived in Corsica , as you heard , during the month of May , 1829 . On the 12th of August in that same year I first beheld my Lily . That day I remember , beside other reasons , because I had wondered , as I rode idly along , whether my brother was opening his usual Highland campaign , and whether he would like to shoot the muffrone . Lily and I were married on the 21st of March , 1830 , when I was twenty - seven years old : and our little Henry first saw the light on the 24th of December following , more than two years before your birth . Your father having no children as yet , I looked upon my Harry as heir presumptive to these estates . Although your birth appeared to divest him of the heirship , it has since , through causes then unknown to me , proved otherwise ; and if he were living now , he would in strict law be entitled to this property after my death . But if he were alive , he never should have an inch of it , that is if I could prevent it ; because in strict righteousness all belongs to you . And now I hold the property in fee simple , under an Act which abolishes fines and recoveries ; for I have suffered so much from remorse , ever since your dear mother 's death , that even before you saved my life , dearest child , I enrolled a deed in Chancery , which gives me disposing powers ; and as I think you know , I made thereupon a will devising the lands to you . This also was one of the documents you caught that vile hypocrite stealing . To return to the old Signor . He was now as happy as the day was long , and desirous , as an old man often is , to set on foot noteworthy schemes , which might survive his time . Of this desire I took advantage to inoculate him with some English views . It was rather late to learn another catechism , at threescore years and five ; but a green old age was his , hale and hearty as could be . "

How could he come and pretend to love her , and pretend to marry her , when all the while he had a young wife at home in England ? Never would she have believed it but for the proofs , the proofs that hateful man had shown her . How could he shame his own love so , and his children , and the aged father — there was no hope for her but to die — to die and never see him more ; and then perhaps he would be sorry , for he must care about her a little .

It is my privilege to amend this error , while meekly I revindicate my own neglected rights . From me you have stolen my bride and my good inheritance , and in a manner which the persons unversed in human nature would be inclined to characterise as dastardly and dissolute . Furthermore , you have rendered the heiress of the noblest house in Corsica a common Englishman 's adulteress . If I had heard this on the day of your mocking marriage , not the poor victim but you , you , would have been my direction . Now I will punish you more gradually , and longer , as you deserve . Your unhappy adulteress knows the perfidy of your treachery , and your two poor bastards shall take refuge with me . The inquiry with respect to my drowning them to - night is dependent upon the stars . But if I shall spare them , as I may , because they can not come between me and my property , I will teach them , when they are old enough , to despise and loathe your name . They shall know that in the stead of a father 's love they have only had a vagabond 's lust , and they shall know how you seduced and then slew their mother ; for death , in my humble opinion , appears in her face to - night . Although she has betrayed me , I am regretful for her : but to you who have disgraced my name and plundered me , as a man of liberal and exalted views I grant a contemptuous forbearance ; so long , that is to say , as you remain unhappy , which the wicked ought to be . Of one thing , however , I bid you to take admonishment . If I hear that you ever forget this episode of debauchery , and return to your English wife and property , no house , no castle that ever was edified , shall protect you from my dagger . Remember the one thing , as your proverb tells , I am slow and sure . LEPARDO DELLA CROCE . "

181460	181928	181458	181458	Lily	606	" I fell upon the old man 's neck — old he was , though not in years — and as I wept I kissed him . How could I have wronged him so , and how could I keep myself from loving one so long unhappy ? If sorrow be the sponge of sin , his fault was wiped away . At this time and place , I , Clara Vaughan , leap from the pillion of my Uncle 's pensive mule , and am upon the curb - stone of my own strange life again . How I wandered with him through the olive groves of Corsica , how I wept for his loving Lily , that ancient Signor , and the stolen babes ; and how , beyond the vomito of words , I loathed that fiend who had injured whom or what most I know not , unless it were his own soul , if he had any , and for God 's sake I hope he had — all this , though I am too weak of language , will , perhaps , be understood . To myself I would hardly confess the interest I could not discard in the pure and constant love of that impassioned pair ; for what had I any longer to do with Pyramus and Thisbe ? No more of love for me . You will not see me droop , and fret , and turn to a mossy green . No nonsense of that sort for me : I have a loop at either side entitled self - respect , which will keep my skirt from draggling . Neither will I rush into the opposite extreme , pronounce all love a bubble because my own has burst , take to low - necked dresses , and admire cats more than babies . No ; I am only eighteen , not yet eighteen and a half ; I have loved with all my heart , and a free true heart it is , albeit a hot and haughty one ; if it be despised , outraged , and made nothing of , though I can never transfer , I will not turn it sour . The world is every whit as fair , children are quite as pretty , flowers have as rich a scent , and goodness as pure a charm , as if that silly maiden Clara had not leaped before she looked . And yet how I wish that I could only think so . Before I go on with my tale , I must recur to one or two little matters , that everything may be as clear as it lies in my power to make it . For although I am but a "
181931	183775	181458	181458	Lily	606	" as Inspector Cutting observed , I am doing my best to make everything as clear as if told by a male . In the first place then , when my Uncle had recovered from the exertion of telling his tale , I acquainted him with my discovery of the letters upon the bed - hangings . They confirmed his account of the fearful Vendetta usages , and explained the point which had been to him most mysterious . Secondly , as to the anonymous letter which had led me first to London ; like the detective policeman , he now attached but little importance to it . He had done his best , at the time , to trace the writer and follow the clue , if there were any . But he had met with no success . His reason for passing it on to me , was that he hoped to create some diversion of my thought , some break in the clouds of my sorrow . Next , to show the full meaning of Mrs. Daldy 's manoeuvres . Through her connexion — which she had carefully cultivated , when it began to seem worth her while — with her husband 's kindred near Genoa , she had learned some portions of my poor Uncle 's history ; for , as he himself observed , the islanders are much addicted to gossip , as indeed all islanders are , and continentals too for that matter , especially in hot climates . Now there is no lack of intercourse between the Balagna and Genoa . Of course our chastened hypocrite made the most of her knowledge in a hundred ways , and by her sham sympathy and pretended aid — for up to the time of his illness the desolate father still sought and sought — she even secured some little influence over her brother - in - law . How often is it so : though we know people to be false , we do not believe , when our hearts are concerned , that they are so false to us . Moreover , when she found him shattered in body and mind by paralysis , she commenced an active bombardment , pulling out the tompions from every gun of mock religion . But , as in her treatment of me , she displayed , in spite of all her experience and trials , a sad ignorance of unregenerate human nature . My Uncle was not the man , palsied or no , to be terrified by a Calvinist : and he knew too much of her early days , and certain doings at Baden , to identify her at present with the angel that stands in the sun . And this prison - eyed mole made another mistake . Not content with one good gallery , she must needs work two runs , side by side , in a very mealy soil . The result was of course that they ran into one , and she had to dig her way out . If she had worked , heart and soul , for my Uncle 's money only , which he rightly regarded as his own , and at his own disposal , I believe she might have got most of it . At any rate , under the will which I caught her carrying off , she was to take half of the large sum which he had laid by ; I mean if his children did not come to light , and prove their legitimacy . But twenty - five thousand pounds would be nothing to her dear son , who had inherited his father 's extravagance , or to herself , who loved high play . Therefore , believing me out of the field , she began to plot for the Vaughan estate as well , and furthermore for the magnificent property in Corsica . Of the Vaughan estates she had no chance — albeit she had the impudence to propose a compromise with me — of Veduta tower she had some prospect , if the right heirs , the poor children , should never appear , or establish their claim , and if she could procure the outlawry of Lepardo . Believing my Uncle to be dying by inches , she made a bold stroke for possession of the most important documents ; and , but for Giudice and me , no doubt she would have succeeded . But she had dashed far out of her depth , and had little chance now of reaching the coveted land . I hope she felt that everything was ordered for her good . Another point which seems to require some explanation , is the discovery by the assassin of the secret entrance , an access quite unknown to the family , the servants , or any other person , except , at a later time , Mrs. Daldy . The house , as I said before , was built upon the site and partly embodied the fabric of a still more ancient structure . Probably these narrow stairs , now enclosed in the basement of the eastern wall , had saved many a ripe priest from reeling , in the time of the Plantagenets . They led , I think , from the ancient chapel , long since destroyed , to the chaplain 's room , and perhaps had been reopened secretly during the great rebellion , when the Vaughans were in hot trouble . Beatrice Vaughan , the cavalier 's child , who was now supposed to begin her ghost walk at the eastern window , glided probably down this staircase , when , as the legend relates , she escaped mysteriously from the house , in her father 's absence , roused the tenants , and surprised the Roundhead garrison in their beds . The house was soon retaken , and Beatrice , in her youthful beauty , given up to the brutal soldiers . She snapped a pistol at the Puritan officer , and flew like a bird along this corridor . At the end , while trying perhaps to draw the old oak slide — though nothing was said of this — she was caught by the gloating fanatics , and stabbed herself on the spot rather than yield to dishonour . The poor maiden 's tomb is in the church , not far from the chancel arch , with some lines of quaint Latin upon it . Her lover , Sir William Desborough , slit that Puritan officer 's nose and cut off both his ears . I wonder that he let him off so lightly ; but perhaps it was all he was worth . Major Cecil Vaughan married again , and the direct line was re - established . The chapel well , as it was called , dark and overhung with ivy , was a spring of limpid icy crystal , spanned by and forming a deep alcove in the ancient chapel wall , which , partly for its sake , and partly as a buttress for the east end of the house , had been left still standing . This old well had long time been disused , hiding , as it did , in a wild and neglected corner out of sight from the terrace walk ; and the gardeners , who found the pump less troublesome , had condemned the water as too cold for their plants . The mouth , with its tangled veil of ivy and periwinkle , was also masked by a pile of the chapel ruins , now dignified with the name of a rockwork . Some steps of jagged stone led through the low black archway to the crouching water , which was so clear that it seemed to doubt which was itself and which was stone . This peaceful , cold , unruffled well , formed the antechamber to the murderer 's passage . For on the right - hand side , not to be seen in the darkness , and the sublustrous confusion , by any common eye , was a small niche and footing - place not a yard above the water . It needed some nerve and vigour to spring from the lowest stepping - stone sideways to this scarcely visible ledge . None , of the few whose eyes were good enough to espy it , would be tempted to hazard the leap , unless they knew or suspected that the facing would yield to the foot , that it was in fact a small door purposely coloured and jointed like the slimy green of the masonry . In this well the murderer must have lurked ; and he might have done so from one year 's end to another . There with the craft of his devilish race — my Uncle may admire them , but not I — and with their wonderful powers of sight , he must have found this entrance , and rejoiced in his hellish heart . As for Mrs. Daldy , she found it out at the other end , most likely . Unless my memory fails me , I spoke long ago of some boards which sounded hollow to the ring of my childish knuckles . These were in the skirting — if that be the proper name for it — under the centre of the great oriel window . The oak slides , when pressed from below , ran in a groove with but little noise , and without much force being used : but it required some strength to move them on the side of the corridor . It was the sound of these sliding boards which had first drawn Judy 's notice : but as they were in deep shadow , I neither perceived the opening , nor gave him the opportunity . That woman would never have dreamed of the thing , if she had not surprised me one day when I was prying about there ; she must have returned alone , and being , as we have seen , a superior cabinet - maker , discovered the secret which baffled me . As I did not want Judy to catch cold by watching there any longer , I had this horrible passage walled up at either end , and built across in the middle . Having thus made good my arrears , I am at liberty to proceed . When my Uncle had paused from his many sorrows , which he did with a mellow dignity not yet understood by me ; and when I , in the fervour of youth , had offered much comfort kindly received , but far better let alone , I asked him for one thing only:—the most minute and accurate description he could give of that Lepardo Della Croce . His answer was as follows : — "
183800	183812	183799	183800	some excitement"—I	8615	excitement"—I should think so indeed , when one tried to kill the other—"but
184145	185405	184137	184137	he	4342	" This description dwelt on my mind for days and days of thinking . It did not altogether apply to the man whom I had observed so closely at the meeting of the conspirators . That man was of middle height , and though his face was oval , there was scarcely the average width between the eyes . And he did not seem to me like an arrogant man , cold except when excited ; but rather of a hasty , impassioned nature , sure to do its utmost in trifles . Could it be that I had watched and hated the wrong man ? It might be so ; and it was not unlikely that Mr. Cutting himself knew not which was the guilty one . Like most of the London policemen — my Uncle had taught me this — he was too proud of his sagacity to be in truth very sagacious . Experience he had , and all that ; but he would not have done in Paris . The real depth , that goes below , and yet allows for the depth of another , must be in the nature , can rarely exist in a small one , and in a large one is seldom worked but for theoretical purposes . Therefore shallow men overreach in daily life , and fancy they have blinded those who know them thoroughly , and know themselves as well . So far as my experience goes , large - natured men abhor cunning so much , that they fear to work the depth of their own intelligence , because it seems akin to it . So they are cheated every day , as a strong man yields to the push of a child ; and the fools who cheat them chuckle in the idea that they have done it by fine sagacity , and without the victim 's knowledge . At my earnest entreaty , the idea of assembling the tenants especially was allowed to drop , and I was to be inducted at the Midsummer dinner , which was very near at hand . A deed had been prepared by the London solicitors , reciting the facts and assuring all the estate to me , as my father 's proper heiress . My Uncle also desired to settle upon me all the personal property , except a sum of 10,000*l . * , which he would reserve for his children , to enable them , if ever they should be found , to establish their claims in Corsica : then if the son obtained his rights , his sister was to have the money with all expenditure made good by him . But I would not hear of it . It would have made me a rogue . By his skill and economy , my Uncle , during the nine years of his management , had saved more than 50,000*l . * from the proceeds of the estate . But he had added at least an equal amount to the value of the land , by carrying out most judiciously the improvements begun by my father ; and the whole was now considered the best - managed estate in Gloucestershire . Therefore , when he abandoned his legal right , in the most honourable manner , it would have been horribly shabby and unlike a Vaughan , to hold him accountable for the back rents . I begged him to leave the whole of it for the benefit of his poor children , requesting only , and unnecessarily , that the hypocrite might not have sixpence . Another thing I entreated , that he would prolong his guardianship , and stewardship , if his health allowed it , until I should be of age , that is to say , for two years and a half . Seeing how earnestly I desired it , he undertook to do so , though he made the promise with a melancholy smile , adding that he hoped his children would be found ere then , if he was to see them at all . When the rent - dinner was over , and the glasses had been replaced , my Uncle , who had not been there as usual , led me into the great old hall . Feeble as he was , he entered with a grace and courtesy not always to be discovered in the mien of princes . The supper — as the farmers called it — had not begun till six o'clock ; and now the evening sunshine glanced through the western window , and between the bunches of stoning grapes into the narrow doorway , stealing in from the Vinery with sandals of leafy pattern . The hall was decked with roses , no other flower but roses ; yet who could want any other , when every known rose was there ? Even the bright yellow blossoms of the Corsican rock - rose , a plant so sensitive that to steal one flower is to kill all the rest . From time out of mind , some feudal custom of tenure by the rose had been handed down in our family . All the guests rose as we passed , which made me rather nervous , albeit I knew every one of them from my childhood up . Then my Uncle , leaning on me , spoke a few words from the step , plain and simple words without flourish or pretence . What he said was known long since , and had been thoroughly discussed in every house of the village . He finished by setting me in the black oak chair of state — which he had never used — and presenting me with a rose ; then he turned round and proposed my health . When I took the rose , an exquisite crested moss , kissed it and placed it in my bosom , according to the usage , such a shout arose , such an English hurrah , that it must have echoed to the other bank of the distant Severn . At first I was quite frightened , then I burst into tears as I thought of him whose chair I sat in , whose memory still was echoing in that mighty shout . It was not only love of right , or sympathy with a helpless girl , that moved those honest bosoms , but the remembrance of him who had been so pleasant to them , humble , kind and just , in one word , a gentleman . But as they came up , one by one , and begged to take my hand , and wished me joy and long life with all their hearts , I found that I was right in one thing ; I knew them better than my Uncle did . Instead of being rude or cold to him , as he expected , they almost overwhelmed him with praise and admiration . But all this I must not dwell on , for my story hurries hence , and its path is not through roses . Annie Franks , who still was with us , and did not mean to go until she had finished all the Froissart novels , and such a dear good girl she was , that we hoped they would last for ever , Annie Franks brought me next day two letters of aspect strange to "
185409	185718	185780	185780	I	0	" One I knew at a glance to be from Tossil 's Barton , though the flourishes were amazing , and the lead - pencil lines rubbed out . The other , a work of far less ambition and industry , was an utter stranger ; so of course I took it first . Nevertheless , I will treat of it last , because it opens the stormy era . Dear Sally 's gossip is not to be served up whole . Even if it were interesting to others as to me , my space permits no dalliance with farm - yards , no idyls of Timothy Badcock , nay , nor even the stern iambics of Ebenezer Dawe . Only to be just and clear , I may not slur it all . The direction was remarkable . The farmer was always afraid of not being duly explicit , for he believed that letters were delivered throughout England as in the parish of Trentisoe ; where all , except those for the parson and Tossil 's Barton farm , were set upside down in the window at Pewter Will 's , the most public - house in the place . The idea was ingenious , and , I believe , original — having been suggested by the Queen 's boy , whose head Mrs. Huxtable punched . It was that no one could read the name upside down , except the owner of the name and therefore of the letter . Sound or not , I can not say , having had no experience ; but there was this to be said for it , that no one would try the puzzle who did not expect a letter , unless indeed he were of precocious genius , and from that Trentisoe was quite safe . Upon the present "
185723	185746	185780	185780	I	0	" after a long description of me , patronymical , local , and personal , the following injunctions and menaces were added , "
185856	185957	185841	185842	John Huxtable	299	" So the farmer had actually learned to write , although as yet to a strictly limited extent . Of course he had not written any of the above except his name ; but that was his , and did him credit , though it nearly described a circle . After the warmest congratulations and returning the five - pound note , which I had sent for interest , with an indignant inquiry from father whether I took him for a Jew , and after several anecdotes and some histories of butter sold at Ilfracombe market , Sally proceeded thus : "
186675	186678	186673	186673	she	4398	" with all they"—she
186683	186685	186673	186673	she	4398	" them "
186692	186719	186721	186721	her	4398	ought?—"with all they young pigs , and the brown cow expecting every day , and Suke no head at all , and all the chillers and little Clara"—she
186722	186724	186721	186721	her	4398	" Clara "
186727	186734	186721	186721	her	4398	Miss,—"why farmer what be thinking of ? "
186757	186771	186754	186754	he	738	" I must have some one . London be such a wicked place . "
186785	186801	186772	186772	Mother	291	" take your daughter , farmer Huxtable , if you wants to be kept respectable . "
187311	187334	187308	187309	Beany Dawe	334	" I need recount no more of poor Sally 's soft persuasions . The other letter was of a different vein : — "
187468	187661	187664	187664	Clara	293	" When my Uncle saw that letter , he declared that he would go to London with me . No power on earth should prevent him . Not even his self - willed Clara . It was not revenge he wanted : even though it were for his innocent brother , whose wrongs he could not pardon . No , if the small - minded wretch who had spent his life in destroying a fellow - creature 's , if that contemptible miscreant lay at his feet to - morrow , he would not plant foot upon him ; but forgive him heartily , if he had the grace to desire it . But for his children,—for them he must go to London . Only let him see them once before he died . No torpid limbs for him . Who said he was old — and he only forty - seven ? One thing seemed rather strange to me . He longed , yearned I should say , to look upon his little Lily even more than on the child he knew , his son , his first - born Harry . "
187666	187672	187664	187664	Clara	293	" he used to say , "
187695	187698	187673	187673	she	4445	month"—it was now July—"she
187742	187743	187736	187736	you	293	" "
187749	187761	187764	187764	she	4445	" I would reply , knowing nothing at all about it , "
187775	187997	187768	187768	I	0	" Perhaps fifty times a day , he would ask for my opinion , and I would deliver it firmly , perhaps in the very same words and without a shade of misgiving ; and though of no value whatever , it seemed to comfort him every time . But the prolonged excitement , and the stress of imagination exerted on Lily junior , told upon him rapidly in his worn and weak condition . Longing for his company , assistance , and advice , I waited from day to day , even at the risk of leaving Balaam and Balak without good beer . All this time , my imagination was busy with weak surmises , faint suspicions , and tangled recollections . At last , I could delay no longer . Tuesday was the latest day I could consent to wait for , and on the Monday my Uncle was more nervous and weak than ever . It was too plain that he must not attempt the journey , and that the long suspense was impairing his feeble health . So for once I showed some decision — which seemed to have failed me of late — without telling him any more about it , I got everything ready , and appeared at his bedroom door , only to say "
188001	188073	187768	187768	I	0	" Annie Franks , who was going with me , for a short visit to her father , hung back in some amazement , doubting whether she had any right to be there , and dragged off her legs by the coil of my strong will . My poor Uncle seemed quite taken aback ; but as it could not be helped , he speedily made up his mind to it . "
188081	188092	187768	187768	I	0	" which announcement to English minds precludes all further argument . "
188099	188109	188096	188097	Uncle dear	7386	" I cried , as cheerily as I could , "
188141	188167	188139	188139	myself	0	" He was sitting up in the bed , with a Cashmere dressing - gown on , and poring over some relics of olden time . "
188188	189056	188181	188181	They	4453	" After giving Judy the strictest orders , I hurried off in fear and hope , doubtful whether I ought to go . Annie lingered and gave him a kiss , for she was very fond of him . He whispered something about me , which I did not stop to hear , for I wanted to leave him in good spirits . After a rapid journey , I saw dear Annie safe in the arms of her father and mother , and found Mrs. Shelfer at home , and in capital spirits , all the birds , & c. well , and no distress in the house . Charley was doing wonders , wonders , my good friend , sticking to his work , yes , yes , and not inside the public house for the best part of the week . Leastways so he said , and it would not do to contradict him . And she really did believe there were only three bills over - due ! My little rooms were snug and quiet , and the dust not more than half an inch thick . Mrs. Shelfer used to say that dusting furniture was the worst thing in the world to wear it out . According to her theory , the dust excluded the air , especially from the joints , and prevented the fly - blows coming . However , I made her come up and furbish , while I went out to post a letter for Messrs. Balaam and Balak , requesting them to visit me in the morning . When things were set to rights a little , and air , which Mrs. Shelfer hated , flowed in from either balcony , I bought a fine crab and some Sally Lunns , and begged for the pleasure of my landlady 's company at tea . This she gladly gave me , for the little woman loved nothing better than sucking the hairy legs of a crab . But she was so overcome by the rumours of my wealth , that she even feared to eject the pieces in her ordinary manner , and the front rail of her chair was like the beam of a balance . Infinitely rather would I be poor myself , than have people ceremonious to me because I am not poor ; and to tell the honest truth , I believe there is a vein of very low blood in me , which blushes at the sense of riches and position . Why should I have every luxury , that is if I choose to have it , while men and women of a thousand times my mind , and soul , and heart , spend their precious lives in earning the value of their coffins ? This thought has wearied many a mind of pure aerial flight , compared whereto my weak departures are but the hops of a flea ; so I lose the imago , but catch the larva , upon the nettle , practice . Mrs. Shelfer is soon at ease ; and we talk of the price of cat 's meat , and how dear sausages are , and laugh — myself with sorrow — over the bygone days , when dripping played the role of butter , and Judy would not take a bone because he thought I wanted it . Then we talk over the news . Miss Idols had been there , bless her sweet face , yes , ever so many times , to look for letters , or to hear tidings of me . But she was not one bit like herself . She never teased the poor little woman now ; the poor little woman wished very much she would . Oh , I should hardly know her . She did not know which bird it was that had the wooden leg , and had forgotten the difference between a meal - worm and a lob . And she did not care which way she rubbed the ears of the marmoset . Mrs. Shelfer believed , but for the world it must not be told again , that Isola was deeply in love , unrequited love , perhaps one of the weteranarian gents . They did say they had some stuff as would lead a girl like a horse . But whatever it was , Mrs. Shelfer only knew that she could not get at the rights of it . Girls had grown so cunning now - a - days , what with the great supernatural exhibition , and the hats they had taken to wear flat on the tops of their heads , not at all what they used to be when she and Charley were young . Then a young woman was not afraid of showing what her neck was like ; now she tucked it in cotton wool like a canary 's egg . And what were they the better , sly minxes ? She saw enough of it in the Square garden , and them showing their little sisters ' legs for patterns of their own , oh fie ! "
189057	189077	189379	189379	Her	4454	" Come , Mrs. Shelfer , no scandal , if you please . What news of your Uncle John ? "
189078	189158	189379	189379	Her	4454	" Ah , Miss , you must ask the sharks , and the lobsters , and the big sea - serpent . They do say , down at Wapping , that the ship was cast away among the cannibal islands , and the people ate a policeman , and he upon his promotion . What a pity , what a pity ! And his coat four and sixpence a yard , ready shrunk ! But them natives is outrageous . "
189159	189208	188181	188181	They	4453	" Nonsense , Patty , I do n't believe a word of it . Sailors are dreadful story - tellers , ever since the days of Sindbad . Has any one besides Miss Isola , Mrs. Elton , or any one , been here to ask for me ? "
189209	189329	189379	189379	Her	4454	" No , Miss , Mr. Conrad never come after the day you served him so dreadful ; and Miss Idols say he went back and spoiled 300*l . * worth of work ; but that great lady with the red plush breeches , and the pink silk stockings , and the baker 's shop in their hair , she been here twice last week , and left a letter for you . And Balaam been here several times , and Balak along of him ; but I banged the door on them both , now I hear they be out of the business , and a nice young man set up who do n't bother about the gun . "
189330	189378	189379	189379	Her	4454	" Lady Cranberry 's letter may lie there , and go back the next time Ann Maples comes . But the bailiffs I must see . If they come to - morrow , let them in immediately . And how are all my friends at the Mews ? "
189642	189688	189634	189635	Mrs. Shelfer	391	" You ca n't , Miss , you ca n't indeed — not for a thousand pounds . The rooms are let , I tell you , and you ca n't go up . Oh dear , oh dear , whatever am I to do ? "
189689	189739	189743	189743	Idols	466	" Patty , I will go up . I do n't care who 's there . My heart is breaking , and I will die on my darling 's bed . If you stand there , I 'll push you . Out of the way , I tell you . "
189891	189917	189881	189881	I	0	" Never mind , my pet . There , you have cried enough . Tell your own dear Clara who has dared to vex you . "
189982	190121	189974	189974	she	466	" Why , dear , you know my pappy — pappy I used to call him — he is not my papa at all , he says himself he is not ; and that is not the worst of it , for I could do well enough without him , he is always so dreadfully cross , and does n't care for me one bit . I could do without him very well , if I had a proper papa , or if my father was dead and had loved me before he died ; but now I have no father at all , and never had any in the world ; I am only an outcast , an abandoned — Oh , Clara , will you promise to forgive me , and love me all the same ? "
190122	190151	190152	190152	She	4468	" To be sure I will , my dearest . I am sure , you have done no harm . And even if you have been led astray — "
190173	190247	190165	190165	she	4468	" No , you have quite mistaken me . Do you think I would sit here and kiss you , if I were a wicked girl ? But who am I to be indignant at anything now ? He told me — are you sure the door is shut?—he told me , with a sneer , that I was a base - born child , and he used a worse word than that . "
190318	190342	190304	190304	I	0	" And who is your father , my pretty ? Any father must be a fool who would not be proud of you . "
190343	190441	190313	190314	her brother	6430	" Oh , Clara , the worst of it is that I have not the least idea . But from something that hard man said , I believe he was an Englishman . I think I could have got everything from him , he was so beside himself ; but when he told me that dreadful thing , and said that my father had lied to my mother and ruined her , I felt so sick that I could not speak , till he turned me out of the house , and struck me as I went . "
190442	190445	190304	190304	I	0	" What ? "
190446	190679	190313	190314	her brother	6430	" Yes , he turned me out of the house , and gave me the blow of disgrace , and said I should never look on his face again . He had won his revenge — I can not tell what he meant , for I never harmed him — and now I might follow my mother , and take to — I ca n't repeat it , but it was worse than death . No fear of my starving , he said , with this poor face of mine . And so I was going to Conny , dear Conny ; I think he knew it all long ago , but could not bear to tell me . And I sat on some steps in a lonely place , for I did not know how to walk , and I prayed to see you and die : then old Cora came after me , and even she was crying , and she gave me all her money , and a morsel of the true cross , and told me to come here first , for Conny was out of town , and she would come to see me at dark ; and perhaps the Professor would take me back when his rage was over . Do you think I would ever go ? And after what he told me to do ! "
190742	190757	190720	190720	I	0	" Isola , tell me all you have heard , about this dastard bully ? "
190758	190887	190693	190693	her	4471	" I know very little ; he has taken good care of that . I only know that he did most horrible things to unfortunate cats and dogs . It made me shudder to touch him at one time . But he gave that up I believe . But there is some dark and fearful mystery , which my brother has found out ; that is if he be my brother . How can I tell even that ? Whatever the discovery was , it made such a change in him , that he cared for nothing afterwards , until he saw you , Clara . I am not very sharp , you know , though I have learned so much , that perhaps you think I am . "
190888	190902	190693	190693	her	4471	" My darling , I never thought such a thing for a moment . "
190903	190980	190720	190720	I	0	" Oh , I am very glad . At any rate I like to talk as if I was clever . And some people say I am . But , clever or stupid , I am almost certain that Conny found out only half the secret ; and then on the day when he came of age , that man told him the rest , either for his own purposes , or holy Madonna knows why . "
190981	190989	190693	190693	her	4471	" When was your brother of age ? "
190990	191011	190693	190693	her	4471	" Last Christmas Eve . Do n't you remember what I told you at the school of design that day ? "
191012	191021	190720	190720	I	0	" And when is your birthday , Isola ? "
191022	191076	190693	190693	her	4471	" I am sure I do n't know , but somewhere about Midsummer . They never told Conny when his was , but he knew it somehow . Come , he is clever now , Clara , though you do n't think I am . Is n't he now ? Tell the truth . "
191077	191102	190693	190693	her	4471	" I am thinking of far more important matters than your rude brother 's ability . Whence did you come to England and when ? "
191124	191164	191113	191113	I	0	" I am sure I do n't know . I was quite a child at the time , and the subject has been interdicted ; but I think we came from Italy , and at least ten years ago . "
191165	191183	190693	190693	her	4471	" And your brother speaks Italian more readily than English . Can you tell me anything more ? "
191184	191260	191262	191262	my	0	" Nothing . Only I know that old Cora is a Corsican : she boasts of it every night , when she comes to see me in bed , although she has been forbidden . But what does she care — she asks — for this dirty little English island ? And she sits by my bed , and sings droning songs , which I hardly understand ; but she says they are beautiful nannas . "
191287	191294	191281	191281	she	4473	" Any other questions , Donna ? "
191308	191328	191295	191295	She	4473	" Why , my darling , you ought to have a wig . You beat all the senior sophists . "
191329	191448	191281	191281	she	4473	" Yes . Now come and kiss me . Kiss me for a pledge that you will never leave me . I am rich again now : you ca n't tell how rich I am , and nothing to do with my money , and nobody likely to share it . If you were my own sister , I could not love you more ; and most likely I should not love you a quarter as much . And my Uncle longs to see you so . You shall come and live with me , and we 'll be two old maids together . Now promise , darling , promise . Kiss me , and seal the bargain . "
191449	191497	191521	191521	her	4475	" Clara , I would rather be your servant than the queen of the world . Only promise first that you will never scold me . I can not bear being scolded . I never used to be ; and it will turn all my hair gray . "
191498	191512	191513	191513	She	4475	" I will promise never to scold you , unless you run away . "
191622	191640	191610	191610	I	0	" Darling , what scent do you use ? What is it you wash your teeth with ? "
191641	191656	191585	191585	her	4475	" Nothing but water , Clara ; what makes you ask in that way ? "
191657	191675	191585	191585	her	4475	" And the perfume in your hair — what is it ? Oh , you little Rimmel ! "
191676	191703	191610	191610	I	0	" Nothing at all , Donna . I never use anything scented . Not even Eau de Cologne . I hate all the stuff they sell . "
191704	191728	191585	191585	her	4475	" How very odd ! Why , I could have declared that your lips and your hair were sprinkled with extract of violets . "
191729	191876	191585	191585	her	4475	" Oh , now I know what you mean . I never perceive it myself , but numbers of people have fancied that I use artificial perfume . But that man — oh , what shall I call him ? And only this morning I called him ' pappy'—he always accounts for everything , you know ; and he said it was hered — herod — I ca n't say it now , the long English word , but I could at college — no matter , it means something in the family . My mother , he said , was so well known to possess it , that she had an Italian name among the servants for it ; though her real name was quite a different flower . Clara , why do you look at me so ? And what are you crying for ? "
191877	191924	191925	191925	She	4476	" Because , my own darling dear , I have not loved you for nothing . You are my own flesh and blood . You are my own cousin , I tell you , my dear Uncle 's daughter ; and your name is Lily Vaughan . "
192507	192582	192585	192585	I	0	" And are you quite sure , quite certain , Clara darling , that I have a lawful father , one who is not ashamed of me , and was not ashamed of my mother ! And why did he never come for me ? And do you think he will love me ? And is dear Conrad my own brother ? I do n't seem to understand half that you have told me . "
193087	193091	193171	193171	I	0	" genuine father . "
193137	193163	193126	193126	her	4506	" At any rate , Clara , tell me one thing clearly . Are you quite certain that Conny and I are not — not — "
193164	193170	193171	193171	I	0	" Not base - born , "
193187	193236	193171	193171	I	0	had?—"No , my darling , you are as lawful as I , your cousin Clara . We Vaughans are a passionate race , but we never make wrecks of women , and scoundrels of ourselves . That we leave for Corsicans , and people brought up to lies . "
193316	193374	193375	193375	She	5394	" Let me go now , Clara . What am I thinking of ? Let me start at once . And you say my own father is very ill . He will die without seeing me . On with your things , while I run to the cab - stand . I have money enough for both . "
193434	193511	193419	193420	her mother	6340	" Idols , take it easily , or I wo n't let you go at all . I rather fancy , we must have some evidence , before my Uncle owns a little chit picked up in London . He is a clever and cautious man , and will expect something more convincing than your beautiful eyes and sweet breath . Do you expect , you impetuous jumper , that he will know you by instinct ? "
193568	193585	193564	193564	I	0	" Did you suppose , my dear , that your father would know you by instinct ? "
193586	193612	193564	193564	I	0	" Well , perhaps I did , Clara ; if I thought about it at all . I am sure I should know him so . "
193752	193763	193764	193766	the two men	3098	" By your leave , if you please , Miss , "
193793	193809	193789	193789	I	0	" Be quick , if you please ; what is it you have found out ? "
193827	193862	193810	193810	Balaam	539	" Have you brought me to London for nothing ? What do you mean by all this mummery ? I shall ring the bell in a moment , and have you both shown out . "
193897	193978	193888	193888	my	0	" Balak , I told you so . Lor , how much better it be for you to take my advice , than for me to take yourn ! Balak said , Miss , as we come along , the young lady would be sure to know what was right , and turn up handsome afore she asked us nothing . Now , says I , that ai n't the carakter of my experience , the women most always wants — "
193979	193999	194103	194103	Balak	539	" Here , quick , how much do you want , before I know what you have to tell ? "
194016	194056	193888	193888	my	0	" Well , Miss , I say ten , and that quite enough till you has time to judge . But Balak say nothing under twenty , considering all the beer , and some of it country brewers ' — "
194057	194087	194088	194088	He	4521	" Your advice is better than Balak 's ; I agree with you on that point ; and I will take it in preference . Here are ten pounds . "
194109	194160	194103	194103	Balak	539	" If what you tell me proves really valuable , I will give you a cheque for another ninety ere long , and the residue hereafter : but not another farthing , if you keep me in this suspense . Do I look likely to cheat people of your class ? "
194161	194190	194088	194088	He	4521	" No , Miss , we hopes not ; nor of any other class , I dare say . Still there be so many rogues in the world — "
194191	194201	194103	194103	Balak	539	" You have taken my money ; speak on . "
194449	194452	194446	194446	He	4525	" Professor , "
195468	195474	195670	195670	Balak	539	" And so you see , Miss"—was
195477	195598	195670	195670	Balak	539	peroration—"we have had a downy cove to deal with , for all his furious temper . Lor now , I never believe any Bobby would have discovered him ; but we has ways , Miss , what with the carpets and the sofys , and always knowing the best pump at the bar , gentlemen of our profession has ways that no Peeler would ever dream of . And now , Miss , the ink is on the table , and both of us wishes you joy — didn't you say so , Balak?—if you only think we has earned that cheque for 90*l . * , and the rest , please God , when the gentleman feel Jack Ketch . "
195599	195667	195668	195668	Balaam	662	" You shall have the money soon , if not now . For I believe you have deserved it . But I must trouble you first to write down briefly what you have told me , and to sign it in full . It is not for myself . I remember every word . It is for the satisfaction of a gentleman who can not see you . "
195772	195795	195753	195754	darling Idols	466	" And surely , my pet , you yourself must have something ; some relic , or token , to help us . "
195796	195856	195881	195881	She	466	" No , cousin Clara , I ca n't think of anything , except this little charm , which has been round my neck for years , and which I have shown you before : but I fear it is not uncommon . He took it away from me once , but I managed to steal it back again . "
196292	196298	196299	196299	she	428	" You know , dear , "
196302	196352	196299	196299	she	428	" Conny will think it unfair of me to get such a start of him with the real good Papa ; and it would be so much nicer to have him there to help . And I am terribly frightened , though of course you ca n't understand it . "
196353	196410	196299	196299	she	428	" Isola , no more nonsense . For your sake , and my poor Uncle 's , I would do anything honest and proper : but neither can I travel with your brother Conrad , nor can I go near his lodgings . I am not quite reduced to that , however I am trampled on . "
196411	196432	196299	196299	she	428	" But , darling , they need not see you . And you know he has made some wonderful mistake . "
196463	196595	196456	196456	I	0	" He has , indeed , a very grave mistake , if he ever thinks I will forgive him . No mistake ever made by man can be pleaded for what he has done . Even if he believed , by some excess of absurdity , that my father had murdered his , instead of his murdering mine ( which was much nearer the mark ) , would even that justify his rudeness , low rudeness , and personal violence to a lady ? What he did I never told you ; and he , I should hope , was too much ashamed to speak of it : why he actually pushed me ; thrust me , Clara Vaughan , away from him , till I almost fell on the floor ! "
196596	196666	196459	196459	his	4607	" Oh , Donna , how your eyes flash ! And you call me excitable ! Let me put your hair back . There now , give me a kiss . I am so sorry for Conny . He loves you with all his heart , and you look as if you could kill him . But no doubt the new good papa will put every thing to rights . "
196667	196678	196456	196456	I	0	" Will he indeed ? Let us go and see . "
197085	197165	197078	197078	he	1271	" My dear child , kiss me again . You are nearly as tall as I am , since my upright ways have departed . From the moment you went away , I have done nothing but miss you , every hour and every minute ; and last night I slept never a single wink . Let us give it up , my darling . God has sent you to me to make up for both daughter and son . "
197166	197183	197184	197184	I	0	" Well , Uncle , that 's all very fine , but I doubt it strongly . "
197199	197217	197218	197218	He	4627	" It is my firm belief that proud Clara will still have to wash at the pump . "
197256	197263	197264	197264	he	4627	" What ! do you mean to say"—and
197268	197284	197264	197264	he	4627	exceedingly—"that you have found any trace , any clue even , to my poor darlings ? "
197285	197303	197264	197264	he	4627	" Yes , thank God , I have . Oh , Uncle , I am so glad ! "
197359	197409	197341	197341	I	0	" Dear Uncle , we must not be certain yet . I mean that I have found something , or fancy I have found something , which — which — I mean if properly followed up — may lead in time — but you know how sanguine I am . "
197410	197456	197341	197341	I	0	" Clara , you are playing with me . It is a mistake to do so . I can not bear it , child . But the sudden shock I can bear . Let me know all at once . Are they alive or dead ? "
197457	197481	197513	197513	He	4633	" Alive , I think , dear Uncle ; and I hope to find them soon , if you will calmly advise me . "
197482	197512	197513	197513	He	4633	" You have found them . No more fencing . I know it by your eyes . All the truth this moment , unless you wish to kill me . "
197569	197605	197562	197562	his	4633	" Dearest Uncle , I tell you the truth . Of course I can not be certain yet , and it wo n't do to make a mistake ; and so I want more evidence . "
197606	197618	197619	197619	He	4633	" I want no more . Only let me see them . "
197635	197675	197619	197619	He	4633	" Now , keep your mind calm and clear , to help me , my dear Uncle ; for I know not what to do . Have you anything , any tokens at all , of their beloved mother ? "
197724	197742	197718	197718	he	4633	" Take the key from my neck . You know the large black box in — in — "
198376	198397	198399	198399	he	4652	" Now , my dearest Idols , you must not disturb these things . Your father will be so vexed . "
198424	198451	198417	198417	She	4650	" Now just put back that silver knife , with the bit of peach - skin upon it : and leave the stone as it was . "
198479	198519	198455	198455	she	4650	" Knife and peach - stone found in my Lily 's pocket . The stone was meant for me to set . I will plant it , when I have found her children . E.V. , January , 1834 . "
198520	198533	198537	198537	I	0	" Now , you foolish child , you are really too bad . "
198574	198584	198572	198572	me	0	" Isola , off with that nasty dark frock ! "
198585	198603	198545	198545	her	4650	" Nasty , indeed , Clara ! Why you said this morning how very pretty it was . "
198604	198631	198638	198638	I	0	" What has that to do with it ? Pull it off , or I 'll tear it . Now , out with the other arm . "
199130	199157	199122	199122	her	4650	" Clara , it does not matter how much trouble you take ; you ca n't make me look a quarter so well as you do . "
199158	199180	199108	199109	my darling	5337	" Not quite so tall , my darling , nor anything like so naughty ; but a thousand times more lovely . "
199181	199200	199122	199122	her	4650	" Well , I wish I could think so . I am always longing to change with you . "
199201	199233	199234	199234	I	0	" Do n't talk nonsense , my pretty ; if I were a man I should die for you . Now I glory in you as a Vaughan . Come along . "
199414	199490	199392	199392	He	1271	" Uncle dear , what will you say to me ? I have brought you another new visitor , the loveliest girl in London . You know her well by name . You have often longed to see my sweet darling Isola . And she wants to see you so much . Only you must promise me one thing honourably . Be gay and sprightly with her ; she is timid in this old house . "
199491	199535	199392	199392	He	1271	" My dear , I ca n't see her to - night . You do n't mean that of course . Give her my best apologies . You say she is very sweet - tempered ; I am sure she will excuse me . "
199536	199558	199608	199608	I	0	" If she would , I will not . Nor would you excuse her , if you knew whom she resembles . "
199559	199572	199392	199392	He	1271	" What do you mean ? Have you locked my box again ? "
199573	199588	199608	199608	I	0	" Yes , and here is the key . I found a portrait of a lady"—I
199595	199600	199392	199392	He	1271	cousin—"very like beautiful Isola . "
199638	199682	199630	199630	I	0	" Now , do n't be a baby , Isola . Remember how ill he is . Keep as much in the shadow as possible ; and if he should guess who you are , pretend not to care a bit for him . "
199683	199703	199704	199704	She	2465	" I will try my very best , Clara . But I do n't think I can do that . "
199747	199766	199729	199729	I	0	" Uncle Edgar , this is my dearest friend , of whom you have heard so often , Miss Isola"—Ross
199772	199783	199729	199729	I	0	" Why , Uncle — why , Idols , darling — "
199834	199841	199844	199844	he	4677	" My Lily , my Lily , "
199848	199857	199844	199844	he	4677	" my own Lily come from the grave ! "
200415	200418	200414	200414	her	592	" Isola , "
200421	200424	200414	200414	her	592	" Idols , "
200471	200517	200536	200536	She	592	" Oh , Donna , I am so glad I have found you at last . What makes you run away from me and my Papa ? I have lost my way all over the world . What a lovely world it is , Donna ! "
200518	200535	200536	200536	She	592	" Do n't call me that name here . Do you not see where you stand ? "
200603	200612	200585	200585	she	592	" How you must hate me , Clara . "
200613	200623	200585	200585	she	592	" Hate you , my darling ! What for ? "
200624	200664	200585	200585	she	592	" Oh , because I have got such a dear Papa , and you have none at all . And much worse than that , because — because — oh , I do n't know how to tell you . "
200665	200680	200585	200585	she	592	" Tell me all you mean . Let there be no misunderstanding between us . "
200681	200711	200713	200713	she	4699	" Because my mother and my father seem somehow to have killed — though I am sure they would rather have killed themselves — your poor papa and mamma . "
200758	200867	200732	200732	my	0	" Dearest , I could not be the child of those who sleep beneath us , if it were in my nature now to feel as you imagine . Years ago , I might have done so ; though I hope not even then . Orphan as I am and helpless , already I perceive that I have not lived for nothing . My father , I believe , my mother , I am sure , would have laid down life with pleasure to see me led from wayward childhood even to what I am . Oh , Lily , you ca n't think how they loved me . "
200970	201109	201110	201112	The innocent creature	4705	" Darling Lily , come — how proud they would have been of you — come and kiss me in this presence , and promise that , whatever happens , none shall ever thrust cold hands between your heart and mine . That we will bear , and trust , and love ; nor , if a shadow steals between us , blink it till the substance follows , but be frank and open — the very breath of friendship — and when doubt begins to grow , for the devil is sure to sow it , have it plucked away at once , each by the other 's hand . Kiss me , dear ; your weakness is that you are not so outspoken as I am . Never let me vex you , without knowing it . "
201120	201125	201126	201126	she	4705	" Oh , Clara , "
201129	201186	201126	201126	she	4705	" how on earth did you find it out ? Sometimes you have vexed me dreadfully , for you do n't care much what you say ; but I always thought it was my fault , and I never told you of it . But it never made me love you a single bit the less . "
201187	201233	201110	201112	The innocent creature	4705	" Yes , it did for the moment , though you may soon have forgiven it . But a love which is always undergoing forgiveness , is like glass steeped in water , you may cut it in two with a pair of common scissors . "
201234	201278	201393	201393	her	4707	" Well , I should like to see the scissors that would cut me away from you . I 'll have a great piece off your hair , Clara , if you talk such nonsense . Now come ; my father wants you . "
201279	201285	201126	201126	she	4705	" Have you told him ? "
201286	201352	201393	201393	her	4707	" Yes , everything about dear Conny and you ; and he says you are a noble girl , but uncommonly thick - headed about your own concerns , though as quick as lightning for others . Now , I wo n't have you look so pale ; let us run and get some colour . See , I 'll get first to that tree . "
201353	201358	201359	201359	I	0	" Will you indeed ? "
201422	201438	201409	201409	she	4707	" Let us walk faster , Lily , if my Uncle wishes to see me . "
201439	201458	201409	201409	she	4707	" No , there is plenty of time . It will do him good to sleep a little . "
201459	201476	201409	201409	she	4707	" Oh , then it is nothing important . I rather feared that it might be . "
201477	201519	201409	201409	she	4707	" Do n't be at all afraid , darling . He wants to show you how nicely he made the Chalcedony Spalla that used to be round my neck . He made it for my mother , in remembrance of something . "
201520	201542	201409	201409	she	4707	" Oh , nothing more than that . I thought you spoke of something — at least you seemed to imply — "
201543	201620	201409	201409	she	4707	" Nothing that you need blush about , nor stammer either , proud Donna . You know you proved to me yesterday , when we were in the cab , that you did not care for Conny any more than you did for a flake of London soot , which happened to come in at the window , and fall upon your glove . And you were kind enough to compare him to that individual smut . "
201621	201628	201629	201629	I	0	" Oh , Judy , Judy , "
201639	201653	201409	201409	she	4707	us—"darling Judy , you love Clara , if nobody else has sense enough . "
201671	201720	201409	201409	she	4707	" Oh , Clara , darling Clara , do n't you know that I was in fun ? I thought you were so clever . And now to see you sobbing over that great muff of a dog ! Judy , I hate you , get out of the way"—the
201724	201778	201409	201409	she	4707	stir—"take your great hulking paws from cousin Clara 's neck . There then , make the most of that ! Oh , I have hurt my hand so , and he is only wagging his tail . But I am so delighted , my own pet , that you love poor Conny still . "
201779	201788	201409	201409	she	4707	" And pray , who said I did ? "
201789	201895	201409	201409	she	4707	" Nobody , only me . All dear Papa said was this , that there was a great mistake , and he soon perceived what it was ; and I asked him to take my opinion about it , because I was a senior sophist . And he pretended not to know what a senior sophist was . And I told him it was my degree , not from that man , you know , but fairly earned at the College ; though they did have the impudence to say that the Professors were going to pluck me , until I gave them a smile . "
201896	201918	201409	201409	she	4707	" True enough , no doubt . But I know all that long ago . What more did my Uncle say ? "
201919	201988	201409	201409	she	4707	" That he would tell you his opinion , but he would rather not talk about it to me . And he could not bear me to go out , for fear I should be stolen again . And I do believe he has had me watched all the way . Here I come , Pappy ; large as life you see , and three times as natural . "
201989	202061	202062	202062	Lily	592	" Yes , my own treasure , three times as natural to me , as my life has been without you . But wheel me indoors , young maidens . No other man in the world has such a pair of horses . I want to talk to Clara , in my own room alone . Lily , go to Mrs. Fletcher , I ca n't have you roving about so . "
202067	202083	202064	202064	him	4710	" Wait one minute , Uncle dear ; I want to go and fetch something . "
202120	202138	202108	202108	I	0	" What is the matter , Clara ? Have you turned conveyancer , and detected some informality ? "
202139	202164	202165	202165	I	0	" No , dearest Uncle . But I want you to cancel this . I can not allow you so to rob your children . "
202214	202517	202206	202206	he	4710	" Darling , it would be wrong . It would be downright robbery ; and no plea whatever for it , on the score of paternal duty . You are the proper heir , the child of the elder son , the true representative of our ancient family . All the rest is a quibble and quirk , of which , even without your countless benefits , I never intended to take advantage . And my children are , by the mother 's side , of a family older even than ours — so far as that nonsense goes — and are heirs to wealth compared to which — if it only be rightly worked — these Vaughan estates are nothing . All I ask you is to do a thing which I am sure you would do without asking — to assist them , if what I have left them is spent before they prove their claims . Here is a letter to Count Gaffori ; that excellent man is still alive ; and here are the certificates , and my own brief deposition , which I have begged a neighbouring magistrate to come to - day and attest ; here is my Lily 's Spalla , and perhaps other relics are in my son 's possession . Lastly , here are two more letters , one to my old friend Peter Green , who has now much influence in that part of Corsica , the other to James McGregor , once my messmate at Lincoln 's Inn , now an acute and rising Counsel , and a leading authority upon municipal law . Take all these , my darling , if you will so far oblige me ; for I fear my lovely daughter — isn't she lovely , Clara ? "
202518	202541	202674	202674	his	4714	" The loveliest girl in all the world ; and what is far more important , the sweetest , and the best . "
202542	202630	202674	202674	his	4714	" Yes , if you had searched the kingdom , you could not have brought me such another love . But ah ! you should have seen her mother ! However , I fear the sweet pet is a little careless and random , as her father used to be . At any rate , I prefer entrusting this great budget to your brave and honest hands ; at least until my son comes here to claim it . The deposition you shall have , when attested . "
202631	202652	202206	202206	he	4710	" But , Uncle , surely you had better keep it all yourself . No fear of Mrs. Daldy now . "
202653	202669	202674	202674	his	4714	" No , my darling ; but these things must not be buried with me . "
202693	202789	202684	202684	he	4714	" And now , my child , about yourself . Though you have found me another daughter , I look upon you as the eldest ; and I venture to speak to you , as a father would . Is it as my Lily tells me ? Is it true — God grant it may be — that you love my son , my Lily 's son , Henry Conrad ? Why do n't you answer me , darling ? Tell the truth like a real Vaughan . Surely you are not ashamed of him . "
202812	202817	202793	202793	his	4715	" Yes , Uncle , "
202836	202859	202820	202820	I	0	" Yes , Uncle , I do — I mean at least I did — love him very much at one time . "
202860	202879	202793	202793	his	4715	" With all your heart , as we Vaughans love ; with all your heart , poor darling ? "
202880	202885	202886	202886	I	0	" Yes , Uncle , "
202893	202902	202886	202886	I	0	" none of my heart is left me . "
202903	202922	202793	202793	his	4715	" Thank God ! what blest news for his mother ! My Harry is the happiest fellow alive . "
202923	202943	202886	202886	I	0	" But , Uncle , he does not think so , he — he — doesn't perceive his blessedness . "
202958	202977	202947	202947	my	0	" Oh , I have heard all that . But surely you know the absurd mistake he made . "
202978	202995	202793	202793	his	4715	" Indeed , I can not guess it . Is it my place to do that ? "
202996	203027	202793	202793	his	4715	" Of course it is ; when you are in the light , and he is all in the dark . Whom did that kidnapper believe himself to have murdered ? "
203028	203036	202947	202947	my	0	" You , Uncle , of course . "
203037	203064	202793	202793	his	4715	" And whose child then does he suppose you to be ; if he heard of your existence , as he is sure to have done ? "
203065	203087	202947	202947	my	0	" Merciful God , I see it all ! And how bitterly I have wronged him , my own noble Conrad ! "
203164	203343	203156	203156	he	4716	" My poor dear child , remember — when you may be glad to think of it — that whether I see my noble boy or not , I shall die now in perfect happiness . Noble he must be , or Clara could not love him . It would have been the pet scheme of my heart , if I could have had a voice in it . And here it is done without me ! How often have I longed and yearned that he could only see you , as you waited day and night by my pestilential bed , that he could only know the tale of your troubles and devotion . At my death , the generation so visited from heaven expires ; and you three darlings start anew , with all things in your favour . Now mind that the good old Signor 's directions are complied with , and that Harry , if he lives here , abandons the Corsican property to his sister Lily . Promise me this , my Clara . "
203344	203393	203156	203156	he	4716	" Of course I will , dear Uncle — I mean , so far as my influence goes . And he will then be bound to do so under the deed - poll , if I understood you aright . But perhaps he has quite forgotten me now . "
203394	203431	203156	203156	he	4716	" Of course he thinks himself bound to avoid you . But I have written to set him right , and to bring him as soon as possible . And now about — about that horrible — "
203432	203469	203156	203156	he	4716	" Ah , yes . If I had the right , I would even let him go . My feeling has changed from fierce hatred to utter contempt . And surely his vengeance is satisfied now . "
203470	203505	203156	203156	he	4716	" No , Clara . It will flame more wildly than ever the moment he learns his mistake , and my final triumph over him . Has he any idea where our Lily is ? "
203506	203610	203156	203156	he	4716	" As yet , he can have none . If old Cora went to Albert Street last evening , she would learn nothing from Mrs. Shelfer , I took care of that , except that Lily had been there , and was gone again . The old woman does not speak English enough to attempt to cross - examine . She loves poor Lily , I know , but will be satisfied with the belief that the child had gone to her brother 's . And as for that monster , even if he relents , he will be too proud to inquire . "
203611	203630	203156	203156	he	4716	" What had my poor child done , that the brute turned her out , and struck her ? "
203631	203660	203156	203156	he	4716	" Nothing , I believe , beyond defending her brother Conrad , as she always did . I suppose I may call him ' Conrad , ' Uncle ? "
203661	203685	203156	203156	he	4716	" Yes , my dear , it is his true name , chosen by his mother . Where are you going so hastily ? "
203686	203737	203156	203156	he	4716	" To London at once . For your sake , Uncle dear , I must not think of sparing him . I must have him in custody to - night . I would have avoided it , if I could for a thousand reasons ; but there is no alternative . "
203738	203777	203156	203156	he	4716	" Yes there is . In two days I shall be beyond his reach . Do n't ask me what I mean . To - day is Thursday . Promise only to let him go free till Saturday . "
203778	203796	203156	203156	he	4716	" I will . But I must go to London . I can not rest quiet here . "
203812	203891	203805	203805	he	1271	" I know what you mean , my darling . You intend to discover my Harry , for fear of any mishap . I will let you go , dear ; though the house seems empty without you , its truthful and graceful mistress . But you must not go alone . It is not right for a beautiful girl , however self - possessed and dignified , especially one of your station , to rove about unattended . "
203892	203916	203156	203156	he	4716	" Only one man ever insulted me , Uncle , I mean in a serious way , and he never did it again . "
203917	204009	203805	203805	he	1271	" It does not matter . The example is bad , and all men are not gentlemen . Mrs. Fletcher shall go with you , and our pretty Lily keep house . But I have an especial reason , and a most powerful one , for wishing that you should be here . Do n't go till to - morrow , my darling ; I am so well to - day , and I must see you once at your own table , with my daughter and me for your guests . "
204010	204038	203805	203805	he	1271	" Oh , Uncle , I hope so a thousand times . I will stop till the morning , if you have set your heart upon it . "
204039	204067	203805	203805	he	1271	" I have indeed . You may go in the morning by the first train , and be back to - morrow night . Will you promise ? "
204808	204854	204798	204798	he	1271	" Clara , darling , I have taken a liberty with your house . This afternoon , I wrote by the London post , for Annie Franks to come back again to - morrow , if she will , as an especial favour to me . "
204870	204896	204862	204862	him	1271	" Dear Uncle , you know that I love her ; and I can not see too much of the few whom I really love . "
204914	204918	204911	204911	he	1271	" Good bye , "
204975	204994	204964	204964	his	1271	" God in heaven bless you , darling , for all you have done to me and mine . "
204995	205012	205013	205014	His daughter	2465	" Mine , you should say , dear Uncle . I count them now my own . "
205287	205306	205280	205280	I	0	" You know , Mrs. Fletcher , we must make allowances for young ladies who come from college . "
205307	205321	205322	205322	she	592	" To be sure , Miss Vaughan , to be sure we must , "
205339	205377	205333	205333	she	592	" John , the villain that stole Miss Lily sent her to Oxford , in a young gentleman 's clothes , and she took a very high degree : but do n't say a word about it . "
205378	205386	205388	205388	John	299	" Not by any means , ma'am , "

205726	205733	205712	205712	she	552	" Any strawberries left , dear ? "
205734	205764	205712	205712	she	552	" I should think so , Annie . The best of them all , the British Queens , are just coming in . And such a crop of grapes ! "

206144	206174	206067	206067	I	0	" No smuts on my nose , Mrs. Fletcher , I hope ? I never feel sure , in London . You do n't know London , you see . "
206175	206281	206067	206067	I	0	" No , my pretty , as clean as a whistle , and as clear as the voice of a May - bird , every atom of you . There 's no such complexion nowhere out of Gloshire or in it : and its all along of the brimstone and treacle I give you , when you was small . Talk to me of Lilies — why I see three great butter spots , as big as the point of a needle , and I know by the make of her boot that her little toe turn over ; and what 's more than that — "
206282	206327	206067	206067	I	0	" Mrs. Fletcher , I wo n't hear a word of it . As to her little toe , I can most solemnly declare that you are wrong altogether ; for I have seen her naked foot , and a lovelier one never was — "
206328	206339	206067	206067	I	0	" Take yours out of the way , Miss. But — "
206340	206364	206067	206067	I	0	" But — here we are ; and you have made my cheeks quite red ! I shall be ashamed to be seen . "

206601	206629	206595	206597	the little woman	6264	" Nothing at all , Miss , of any account , I thank you . Only Charley threw double size , three times running , and won — "
206630	206649	206595	206597	the little woman	6264	" I do n't mean that , Mrs. Shelfer ; I mean , what has happened for me ? "
206650	206696	206595	206597	the little woman	6264	" Nothing , Miss Vaughan ; no , nothing to concern a great lady like you : only such a queer lot come , and they seemed to be friends of yours . They ai n't gone from here more than half an hour ago . "
206697	206704	206595	206597	the little woman	6264	" Tell me all about them . "

' ' Miss Clara ! ' says I , ' a set of dressed up trollops like you , come and ask for Miss Clara ! She 'd Miss Clara you , pretty quick time , I doubt , if she was only here . ' ' Us humbly hopes no offence , ma'am , ' says the great big man , the biggest man as ever I see without paying , ' only us has come up from the country , ma'am . ' ' Up from the country ! ' says I , ' need n't tell me that , my good giant ; any fool can see that . And if you take my advice , you 'll clap your hat on , and go down again , and thank God for it . ' You see , Miss , he had got his hat off , and he standing out of doors , on the shady side of the street ! So what I said seemed to stop him altogether , and he looked as if he wanted to think about it ; and I was just a slapping the door in their faces , when the other man , the queerest guy I ever see , a hanging in his clothes like a skiver in a dish - clout , he look full in my face as grave as a heretic parson , and stretch out his skinny arm , and keep time with one foot , while he say or sing , "

207951	208419	207943	207943	me	0	" Having thus got rid of my most talkative friend , and Mrs. Fletcher having started off to buy something , I had time to think a little . It was nearly two o'clock on the Friday afternoon . Nothing more could be done at present towards recovering Conrad , for he had not even left at his lodgings any Continental address . Possibly his place of sojourn might be revealed in the letter to his sister , posted by my hand : but it was far more likely that he himself knew not , at the time of writing , where he should find quarters . I must have been beside myself with worry and disappointment , when I dropped that letter into Her Majesty 's box ; for if I returned , as had been arranged , by the express at five o'clock , several hours would be saved in the delivery of its tidings . And , as yet , I little dreamed where I should be at five P.M. In that little room , whose walls were more relieved than decorated by certain daubs of mine , which even in my narrowest straits I could not bear to part with , because an indulgent critic had found merit in them — a discovery requiring much acumen — here I now sat , gazing fondly , dreaming hazily , yearning strongly for the days gone by , yet only three months old , when I had not a crust or dress till I earned it by my labour . How that pinch enlarged my heart , God only knows , not I. Ah , then I was a happy girl , though I never guessed it . How proudly I walked down the Square , with my black straw bonnet on — which Idols called the Dowdy,—and my dark plaid shawl around me , the plainest of the plain , yet not prepared to confess myself so quotidian as my dress . Who could tell , in those happy days , who might come , or round what corner , and who could say whether of the twain would look the more accidental ? And then the doubt — shall I look or not , better perhaps be intent on the fire - plug , and make him come round again ? But now . Ah me , they have heaped up riches for me , and who shall come to enjoy them ? Just as I was warming to this subject , gushing along in a fine vein of that compassion which alone of soft emotions we find it no duty to wrestle with , I mean of course self - pity — in came Mrs. Fletcher , suddenly , and in anger . "
208425	208434	207943	207943	me	0	" she exclaimed , throwing down her parcel , "
208443	208444	208449	208450	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" "
208461	208462	208449	208450	Mrs. Fletcher	516	" "
208559	208967	208549	208549	Gloucester	23	" As Mrs. Fletcher did not tell a story with the Herodotean vivacity of Tim Badcock , I will render her facts in my own unpretending version , premising only that she had taken the farmer and Sally for specimens of the true Cockney ; a bit of saltatory reasoning of which she has not heard ( and perhaps never will hear ) the last . While then the worthy housekeeper was driving a slow but shrewd bargain , in a smart shop by the Broadway , taking the boots to the sunshine , to pick clever holes in the stitching , she observed a diminutive boy , of the genuine shoe - black order , encamping in a bight or back - eddy of pavement , just at the side of the door . This little fellow was uniformed , or rather multi - coloured , in gold , and red , and green . His cap was scarlet , and edged with gold twist ; his tunic red , and his apron of very bright green baize . On his cap , and on one shoulder , appeared his number , 32 , in figures of brass , an inch and a half in length . Strapped on his back he carried an oblong block of wood , like a great club - foot , and nearly as large as himself . This he deposited , with elaborate fuss , on the curb of the inner pavement , which terraced some inches above the true thoroughfare . A blacking - jar hung at one end of his block ; from a drawer below he pulled out three well - worn brushes , and began to hiss and to work away , in double quick time , with both hands , at some boot projected towards him on the delicate foot of fancy . As he grew warm at his work , with one sharp eye all the while looking out for a genial passenger , there slowly came straggling towards him a bevy quite fresh from Arcadia . First , in treble importance walked , impressively rolling and leering around , Hermes , Pan , and the owl of Pallas , combined in one Ebenezer Dawe . His eyes , never too co - operative , roved away upon either side , in quest of intelligence , which they received with a blink that meant , "
208976	209202	208549	208549	Gloucester	23	" With occasional jerks of his lank right arm , he was dragging along , like a saw through a knot , the sturdy , tight - buttoned , and close - pronged form of our little Jack . Jack was arrayed in a black wide - awake , with blue ribbons , and a bran - new suit of broad - furrowed corduroy , made of nights by his mother and Suke , and turned out with countless pockets , each having three broad buttons , to foil the London thieves . In one of these pockets , the trouser one I do believe , in spite of all Sally had taught him , he was now chinking , to the creak of the corduroys , his last - abiding halfpence , and lagging heavily on the poet 's arm , he cast fond glances at a pile of glorious peg - tops . Sticking her toes into little Jack 's heels , to kick anybody that dared to steal him , came my little Sally , all fire , and wonder , and self - assertion , towing her mighty father along , like a grasshopper leading an ox . At times she strove to drag him towards the finery of the windows , and paid very little heed to his placid protestations . "
209268	209303	209265	209265	I	0	" The farmer 's pockets were crammed with circulars , handbills , and puffs of every description , which he received from all who offered , and was saving them all for his wife . "
209311	209318	209265	209265	I	0	" cried a little shrill voice ; "
209394	209454	209455	209455	Zober	688	" The farmer pulled up suddenly , for fear of walking over him , as the boy , despising Beany Dawe , had dashed in between Jack and Sally , and danced before Mr. Huxtable . His brushes were whisking about , like bumble - bees roughly disturbed , and already menaced the drab of the Sunday fustian gaiters . "
209458	209496	209455	209455	Zober	688	" cried the farmer , who could not believe that he was addressed , having never dreamed , in his most ambitious moments ( if any such he had ) , of ever being called a gentleman , "
209535	209542	209527	209530	lat alo - un	4867	e?"—as the boy got more and more tentative—"Heart

209642	209930	209603	209604	old bloke	4871	" The good farmer was lost beyond hope , in the multitude of subjects pressed all of a pulp on his slow understanding ; nevertheless , he had presence of mind to feel first for his watch and his money , and then for the best pocket - handkerchief stitched into the crown of his hat ; meanwhile the boy got hold of one foot , and began to turn up his gaiters . Then Sally and little Jack rushed to the rescue , and Jack punched the boy in the face , while Beany Dawe looked on with a grin of broad experience . But in spite of all aid , the farmer began to collapse before his mosquito enemy ; when luckily three giant Life - guards ( for a crowd was now collected ) opened their mouths , like the ends of a monkey - fur muff , in a round and loud guffaw , with a very coarse sneer at poor Sally . The farmer looked at them in much amazement ; then his perplexity went like a cloud , and his face shone with something to do , as he gave Sally his hat to hold . Till now all the mockers had been too small for him anyhow to fall foul of . Ere the echo of laughter was over , the three dandy Lifeguards lay on their backs in the mud , with their striped legs erect in the air , like the rods of a railway surveyor . The crowd fell back headlong , as if from a plunging horse , then laughed at the fallen and with the conqueror . Even the boy was humility multiplied into servility . "
209941	209950	209603	209604	old bloke	4871	" asked the farmer , replacing his hat ; "
210007	210012	210001	210001	e	4873	it"—he remonstrated with the admiring multitude—"one
210064	210083	210057	210057	her	4879	" These last two remarks were addressed to himself , but the crowd had full benefit of them . "
210166	210282	210285	210286	little chap	5942	" With bright ribbons fluttering and finery flapping about her , poor Sally knelt down in a moment to work at the muddy fustian : but her father would not allow it , he had only wished to try her ; so he caught her up with one hand , and kissed her , and I think , from what Mrs. Fletcher said , he must have given her sixpence at least . It is needless to say that , although the boy worked with both hands in the most conscientious manner , the farmer 's boots defied him . Neats'-foot oil , and tallow , and beeswax held their own against Day and Martin . "
210288	210295	210285	210286	little chap	5942	" said Mr. Huxtable , kindly , "
210362	210555	210556	210556	God	303	" In this little episode , as will be manifest , Sally has helped me more than Mrs. Fletcher . But now , to return to my narrative . Almost directly after the housekeeper left me , Patty came trotting in with a large white breakfast - cup full of most powerful tea . I can not help thinking that the little woman put some brandy in it , or allowed Mrs. Fletcher , who trusted much in that cordial , to do so ; but they stoutly deny the charge , and declare that there was only a pinch of gunpowder . Whatever it was , being parched with thirst , I swallowed without tasting it , and the effect upon my jaded brain was immediate and amazing . All self - pity was gone ; and self - admiration , and haughty courage succeeded . Was I , Clara Vaughan , who had groped and grubbed for years to find the hole of a blasting snake , and had now got my hand upon it , was I to start back and turn pale at his hiss , and say , "
210572	210808	210556	210556	God	303	" Would I not rather seize the incarnate devil , trample his spine , and make his tongue sputter in dust ? In a moment my cloak and hat were on again ; I scarcely looked at the glass , but felt the hot flush on my cheeks , as I lightly skipped down the stairs , and silently left the house . What to do next I knew not , nor asked , but flew headlong before the impulse , to lift and confront — as is my nature — the danger that lay before me . As I glided along , I was conscious of one thing , the people in the street turned in surprise to watch me . As if by instinct , I hurried straight to Lucas Street , my courage mounting higher and higher as I neared the accursed threshold . Balaam and Balak stood at the bar of a tavern which commanded a view of the street , but were much too busy with beer to see me passing so swiftly . Loudly I rang the bell of No . 37 ; the figures were bright on the door , and looking narrowly , I perceived the old No . 19 , more by the lines than the colour . Old Cora came as usual ; but started at seeing me , and turned as pale as death . "
210814	210823	210826	210826	Meesa	4887	" I could not use his false name . "
210835	210836	210832	210832	him	7167	" "
210846	211018	210832	210832	him	7167	" And I held my gordit before her . She cowered with one knee on the mat and kissed it ; then led me into the presence of Lepardo Della Croce . It was a dark and gloomy room , with three high , narrow windows . Cora departed hastily , frightened at what she had done . In a recess at the farther end , before a chest of black bog - oak , sat the man I sought . The crowning moment of my life was come . All rehearsals went for nothing : the strongest feeling of my heart was scorn , cold , unfathomable scorn . To show myself well , I took off my hat , and advanced in my haughtiest manner . As he turned his head , I saw that his mood was blacker than the oak before him . Some dark memorials perhaps were there ; hastily and heavily he flung down the lid , as I walked with even steps towards him . "
211112	211121	211109	211110	Miss Valence	423	" And he held out his delicate hand . "
211149	211297	211298	211298	You	4898	" He turned not pale , but livid . His jaunty nonsense was gone in a moment . He quailed from my dark eyes , and fell upon a chair . For one minute there he crouched , and dared not meet my gaze ; every fibre of his flesh was quivering . It was not shame that cowed him , but the prostration of amazement . Suddenly he leaped upright , and met me eye to eye . Then I saw that his pupils turned towards each other , as my uncle had described . I neither spoke , nor allowed my gaze to falter . Every nerve and cord of my frame was tense , and rigid , and rooted . To him I must have seemed the embodiment of revenge . At last he spoke , very slowly , and in words that trembled . "

211693	211717	211690	211691	a Professor	4916	" I saw that my contempt was curling round him like a knout ; so I gave him a little more of it . "
211790	211838	211862	211864	Lepardo Della Croce	570	" A black tint darted beneath his skin , as if his heart were a cuttle - fish . Had I taken my eyes from him , he would have stabbed me . He fell back against the oak chest . My madness grew with my triumph . "
211912	211964	211905	211905	I	0	" Quietly I lay and watched him ; but as if he were scarcely worth it . He could not take his eyes from mine . He was like a rat before a snake . And all the while , his hand was working on the cross haft of a poniard . "
211983	212042	211975	211975	you	4898	" And I threw the window - hangings over the foot of the sofa , but so that I held him still in view . Calm as I was , I must have been mad to play with my life so contemptuously . Presently I rose , put back my hair and turned away , as in weariness . "
212103	212158	212087	212087	We	4923	" He sprang at me madly , gnashing his teeth , and whirling his stiletto . I faced him just in time , with both hands by my side . Had I raised them , or shown the least sign of fear , my life would have followed my father 's then and there . "
212161	212178	212218	212218	Rimbecco	547	" I said , while he paused , with the weapon not a yard from me , "
212221	212248	212218	212218	Rimbecco	547	" I saw in his eyes the flash which shows the momentum given , but his arm fell powerless . He looked even humbly at me . "
212252	212253	212249	212250	Clara Vaughan	293	" "
212262	212263	212249	212250	Clara Vaughan	293	" "
212281	212290	212291	212291	You	4898	" He tried to look piercingly at me . "

212406	212591	212397	212397	We	4925	" This seemed to amaze him more than all before . It was plain that he could not believe me . A long silence ensued . Looking at the wily wretch , I began unwittingly to compare , or rather to contrast his noble victim with him . I thought of the deep affliction and misery wrought by his despicable revenge . I thought of his brutal cruelty to the poor creatures God has given us ; and a rancour like his own began to move in my troubled heart . It had been there all the while , no doubt , but a larger pressure had stilled it . Watching me intently , he saw the change in my countenance , and as cold disdain grew flushed with anger , my power over him departed . But he did not let me perceive it . I am sure that I might have gone whither and when I pleased , and he would have feared to follow me , if I had only regarded him to the end with no other emotion than scorn . "
212597	212603	212593	212593	I	0	" he said at last , "
212613	212614	212605	212605	you	0	" "

212811	212812	212819	212819	precautions	4934	" "
212821	212833	212817	212817	I	0	" A deep gleam shot through the darkness of his eyes . "

212869	212898	212854	212854	I	0	" With a shudder he glanced all round the room . Lily was not mistaken when she called him superstitious . Then he tried to sneer it off . "
212915	212927	212901	212903	the good Papa	4937	" Seeing that I disdained to answer , he continued thus : "
212993	213316	213322	213323	young lady	1872	" He raised the lid of the oaken chest , and propped it with a staple . Quite thrown off my guard for the moment , I began to devour the contents with my eyes . Not many things were in it ; but all of them were remarkable . To me they looked like theatrical properties , or materials for disguise . Some of them were faded and tarnished ; some were set with a silver cross . My gaze was rivetted on a pair of boots , fixed in a ledge with horse - shoe bays ; on the sole of one I perceived a cross of metal inlaid ; I drew nearer to see it more closely , when something fell over my head . All down me , and round me , and twisted behind in a tight tourniquet , before I could guess what it was . I am not weak , for a girl ; but I could no more lift my arms than a swathed mummy can . Neither could I kick , although as a child I had been famous for that accomplishment ; if I lifted either foot , I must tumble head - foremost into the box , which was large enough for me to live in . Scream I could , and did , in spite of all my valour , not only from fright , but from pain , for my chest was dreadfully tightened ; but before I could scream more than twice , a cloth was passed over my mouth , and knotted behind my neck . So there I stood , a helpless prisoner , in the recess at the end of the oaken ark . A low laugh thrilled in my ears , but the hand on my spine relaxed not ; I turned my neck by a violent effort and met the demon 's eyes . "
213405	213429	213394	213395	my child	1549	" Yes . Ignoble confession ! I , for whose disdain the world had been too small , was prisoned and helpless in an "
213434	213951	213394	213395	my child	1549	" like a fly in a paper cage - trap . The sofa , on which I had lain so grandly defying my enemy , was covered with a stout worsted net , long and very strong : this he had doubled end to end , and flung over my haughty head . I have not patience to recount his paltry , bantering jeers . Contempt is a tool I am used to grasp by the handle only . Be it enough to say that , without releasing me , he rang the bell for Cora , whose greedy eyes glistened when she saw my gordit loose from my bosom , and tangled in the net . Her master allowed her to disengage , and , for the time at least , appropriate it . In return for this , she was , at his pleasure , to stab me if he should order it . By his directions , she tied my ankles together , while he lashed my arms anew , and tightened the muffler over my bleeding lips . I closed my eyes , and prayed ; then I made up my mind to die , as many a Vaughan had done , at the hands of a brutal enemy . My last thought was of Conrad , and then my senses forsook me . I have a faint recollection of feeling myself swung , and jolted down a number of stairs , and of a cold breeze striking on my face . And doubtless they carried me down ; for the room in which I had found my enemy was two floors above the cellarage . When I came to myself , I had no idea where in the world I was . The air was heavy with a most powerful and oppressive smell , a reek and taint as of death and corruption . It made me faint , and I think I must have gone off again . Lifting my head at last , I began to look languidly around . The table , or working - bench , on which I lay , was near the centre of a long and narrow room , gloomy and cold , even in the dog - days , floored with moss - green stone , and far below the ground - level . Those flag - stones , I suppose , were bedded immediately upon the tough blue London clay , that most unconquerable stratum , sullen , damp , and barren . I could only see two windows in the long low room , both upon the same side , horizontally fixed , and several feet from the floor . Heavy iron bars , perpendicularly set , crossed them at narrow intervals , as if it had been the condemned cell in a prison . One of these windows was already darkened with a truss of straw , and sacks over it , placed outside the glass ; as is done in Corsica , during Vendetta siege . The technical term is "
213956	214996	213394	213395	my child	1549	" Through the other window ( which looked up a slide or scoop of brickwork , like a malt - shovel , to the flabby garden behind the house ) , I saw an arm , the colour and shape of an American herring , very active with a hammer . I knew that arm at once . Sticking out at the joints , like the spurs of a pear - tree , welted and wired with muscle between them , like the drumstick of a turkey , but flat as if plaited of hide , no friend of mine could claim it , except the Corsican Cora . Deliberately she drove the nails , like a gardener training a tree , paying undue attention to her skinny knuckles ; then she lifted the sacks , stooped down and looked in , grimly reconnoitring me . By the slanting light I saw what a horrible place I lay in . Around and under me , on the furrowed timber , were dull plum - coloured blotches , where the slowly trickling blood of many an unlucky dog and cat had curdled ; even if there were not any shed from nobler veins . Reaching in a back - handed way towards the jagged margin , I grasped a cold hard cylinder . It was an iron hold - fast , like , but larger than the instrument to be seen in every carpenter 's bench , which works in a collared hole , and has a claw for clutching . Under it , no doubt , many a poor live victim had quivered and sobbed in vain . At my head were two square slides , fitted with straps of stout unyielding web . Near them was a rasped iron plane working along a metal bed or groove , with a solid T piece , and a winch to adjust it . As with morbid observation I surveyed these fiendish devices , and many others which I can not stop to tell of , I who love almost every creature made by our own Maker , especially those to whom we are lent as Gods , my flesh , I say , began to creep , and my blood to curdle , as if the dissecting knife were already in my diaphragm . Surely those who in full manhood torture His innocent creatures — poor things that can not plead or weep , but worship the foot that kicks them — surely these , if any , we may without presumption say that He who made will judge . Four brief lines by a modern poet , too well known for me to quote them , express a grand and simple truth , seldom denied , more seldom felt . But here am I , laid out in this fearful place , perhaps myself a subject for vivisection . No , I am not strapped ; even my feet are free . Off the grouted and grimy table I roll with all possible speed , the table where even strong Judy must have lain still as a skeleton . Of skeletons there were plenty ranged around the walls , and other hideous things which I can not bear to think of . One was a monstrous crocodile , with scales like a shed fir - cone , all reflexed and dry , and ringent lips of leather , and teeth that seemed to look the wrong way , like a daisy - rake over - worked . Another was some pulled - out beast , that never could hit his own joints again — plesiosauri , deinosauri , marsupials , proboscidians — I am sure I can not tell , having never been at college . I only know that at every one of them I shuddered , and shrugged my shoulders , and wished that he smelled rather nicer . Then there were numbers of things always going up and down , in stuff like clarified syrup , according to the change of temperature , just as leeches do in a pickle - bottle . Snakes as well , and other reptiles streaked like sticks of peppermint , and centipedes , and Rio wrigglers , called I think La Croya . It was enough in that vault - like room , which felt like the scooping of an August iceberg ; it was more than enough to strike a chill to the marrow , as of one who sleeps in a bed newly brought from the cellar . But the worst and most horrible thing of all was the core and nucleus of the smell that might be felt , the half - dissected body of a porpoise , leaning on a dozen stout cross - poles . It was enough to make the blood of a dog run cold . Overpowered by sights and smells , and the fear of mingling with them , I huddled away in a corner , and tried in vain to take my eyes from the only sign of life yet left , the motion of Cora 's club - like arm . The poor old woman enjoyed my interest in her work , and when she had finished , she made me a mock salaam , and kissed the pixie 's heart . Then , with a grin , she dropped the rough hangings , and left me in ghastly twilight . As the sacks fell over the window - frame , I lost all presence of mind , all honest indignation , everything but a coward horror , and the shrinking of life from death . With all the strength of my chest and throat , I cast forth , as a cannon discharges , one long , volleyed , agonising shriek . As it rang among the skeletons , and rattled their tissue - less joints , a small square grating in the upper panel of the heavy door swung back , and in the opening appeared the face of Lepardo Della Croce . He lifted his hat with a pleasant air , and addressed me with a smile , "
215572	215619	215564	215565	Miss Vaughan	293	" Through all this brutal sneering , I stood resolutely with my back turned to him . Perhaps he thought that I would stoop to supplication . I could have bitten my tongue off for that contemptible shriek ; it was such a triumph to him . "
215743	215744	215715	215715	you	293	" "
215759	215760	215749	215749	I	0	" "
215951	216699	215929	215929	you	293	" Taunting to the last , and sneering even at himself , as men of the blackest dye of wickedness are very apt to do , he closed the grating carefully , and I heard the ring of the metal cross on the rough stone steps . He had the boots of vengeance on ; his errand was stealthy and cold - blooded murder ; me , who had never harmed him , he was abandoning perhaps to death , certainly to madness — and yet to his own ideas , all he was doing was right . Frantic at the horrors around me , and still more so at those impending through my own rash folly , I tore and scratched at the solid door , and flung myself against it , till my nails were broken , and my fingers bleeding , and all my body palpitating with impotent mad fury . In weariness at last and shame at this wild outburst , I sat upon the floor , for I could not touch the operator 's stool , and tried to collect my thoughts . Was there any possibility of saving my poor Uncle ? It must now be nearly four o'clock on the Friday afternoon , or at least I so computed it . The beautiful watch given me by my Uncle had stopped through my reckless violence , and the breaking of the glass . The hands , as I could barely perceive , stood at a quarter to four . The express - train , by which Mrs. Fletcher and I were to have returned , would leave Paddington at five P.M. and reach Gloucester soon after eight . Lepardo Della Croce would catch it easily , and perhaps would accomplish his foul design that night . My only hope of preventing him lay in his own tenacity of usage . From my Uncle 's account , I knew , that on their cursed Vendetta enterprises , a certain pilgrimage on foot is , in many families , regarded as a matter of honour . This usage owes its origin perhaps to some faint trace of mercy , some wish to afford the evil passions one more chance of relenting to the milder reflections of weariness , and the influence of the air . Be that as it may , I believed that the custom was hereditary in the Della Croce family ; and if so , the enemy would finish his journey on foot , quitting the train some distance on this side of Gloucester . Therefore if I could contrive to escape in the course of the night , I might yet be in time . All the rest of the daylight , such as it was , I spent in examining , inch by inch , every part of the loathsome chamber , which was now my dungeon . By this time all my patience , habitual more than natural , had returned , and all my really inborn determination and hope . Surely I had been every bit as badly off before , and had struggled through quite as hopeless a difficulty . If arduous courage and tough perseverance were of any avail , those four walls should not hold me , though they might be three feet thick . So stopping both my nostrils with cotton - wool from a specimen ( for the smell was most insufferable ) , and pinning up my dress , I set to work in earnest . First , I examined the windows : there was nothing to hope from them ; I could never loosen a bar , and even if I could , I should only escape from one prison to another , for the garden behind the house was surrounded with high dead walls . Fireplace there was none ; the door had already baffled me ; could I dig through the party wall , and into the adjoining house ? Most likely it was all a falsehood and boast about the thickness , intended perhaps to discourage me from attempting the easiest way . And in so damp a place , the mortar probably would be soft . So , after searching and groping , ever so long , to find , if possible , one loose brick to begin with , I drew from my pocket a knife , of which I was very proud , "
217052	217056	217033	217033	She	585	" twopenny brick . "
217105	217143	217092	217094	the experienced dame	4977	" Surrender your legal right in Our Lady 's heart , without which I shall have no luck , and I will give you this beautiful fish , hard - roed , and done to a nicety . "

220150	220165	220111	220111	she	409	" And pray , Mrs. Shelfer , where do you suppose we are going ? "

220226	220274	220111	220111	she	409	" Why going to Charley , Miss Vaughan , to be sure . Going for Charley 's opinion . And very wise of you too ; and what a most every one does ; particular when he have money . But how you knowed he were there — "
220275	220278	220111	220111	she	409	" Where ? "
220279	220330	220111	220111	she	409	" At the great wrestling match to be sure . And he wanted to take me ; a thing he ai n't offered to do fifteen year next oyster - day . No , no , says I , with Miss Vaughan away , and most likely among them resurrectioners — "
220432	220455	220426	220426	I	0	" And his grandfather were a sexton , Miss ; and our Charley himself a first - rate hand at the spade . "
220456	220622	220628	220628	she	5006	" Mrs. Shelfer , we are close to the place . Now , listen to what I say . It is not your husband I want , but Farmer Huxtable , whom you saw at the door . Nothing but a question of life and death would bring me among this rabble . No doubt there are many respectable men , but it is no place for a lady . The farmer himself knows that , and has never dared to ask me ; though his wife and daughter , in ignorance , have . It is half - past twelve exactly ; in a quarter of an hour at the utmost , I must speak to , and what is more , carry off the Devonshire competitor . Your husband is here , and on the Committee , you told me . I expect you to manage it . Go in at once and find him . Stop , here is plenty of money . "
220659	220697	220637	220637	she	5006	" Come back to me at once ; I shall not move from here . Mind , if the farmer loses the match through me , I will pay all , and give the money for another . "
220816	220881	220802	220802	He	413	" Very sorry indeed , Miss Vaughan , very sorry , you know . But we darrn't interrupt the men now . Our lives would n't be worth it , and they 'd kill both the umpires and the referee too you know . Why it 's fall for fall , only think of that , Miss Vaughan , it 's fall for fall ! "
220897	220903	220891	220891	he	413	" What do you mean ? "
220926	221166	221174	221175	Mr. Shelfer	413	" Why , the Great Northern won the first throw by a bit of foul play , a foul stroke altogether , and no back at all , say I , and my eyes is pretty good ; however , the umpires give it , and you should see John Huxtable 's face , the colour of a scythe - stone ; he knew it was unfair you know . And you should see him go in again for the second fall . ' I could ha dooed it , ' I hear him say , ' I could ha dooed it aisy , only I wudn't try Abraham , and I wun't nother if can help it now . ' None of us knows what he mean , but in he go again , Miss , and three times he throw Sam Richardson clean over his shoulder , and one as fair a back as ever was in sawdust . But the umpires would n't give it , till just now he turn him over straight for'ard , just the same as a sod in a spade , and they could n't get out of that . And now they be just in for the finishing bout , and if you want him , your only way is to come . May be , he 'll try Abraham , when he see you . Ah they 've catched . "

You offered me five hunder pound , afore ever here I come , to sell my back to the Northman . A good honest man he be , and the best cross - buttock as ever I met with ; but a set of rogues and cowards that 's what you be ; and no sport can live with you . As for your danged belt , I wun't have it , no tino , it wud be a disgrace to the family ; it sha n't never go along side the Devonshire and Cornwall leather . But I 'll throw your man over again , and any six of you to once as plases . "
222772	222818	222746	222746	he	5050	" But never fear about the time , Miss Clara , I wo n't kape you two minutes . I 'll give him Abraham 's staylace this time . They have a drove me to it , as us has n't a moment to spare . "

225445	225451	226020	226020	you	705	" What do you mean ? "
225452	225465	226020	226020	you	705	" Why , have n't you heard about poor master 's death ? "
225466	225478	226020	226020	you	705	" Dead , my dear uncle dead ! Do you mean to say"—I
225485	226013	226020	226020	you	705	" No , Miss , only to - day , and not as you thinks ; no fit at all , nor paralyatic stroke . He went off quiet as a lamb , as near as could be three o'clock . He was very poorly before ; but he had a deal to do , and would not give in on no account . He was sitting by himself in the study after breakfast , and at last he rang the bell , and told them to send me up . When I went in , he was bolt upright in his chair , with a beautiful smile on his face , but so pale , white I ought to say , Miss , and so weak he could hardly move . ' John , ' he says , ' Yes , Sir , ' says I ; ' John , ' he says again , ' you are a most respectable man , and I can trust you with anything in the world , John . Take this letter for Miss Vaughan , and put it with your own hands into her own , directly the moment she comes back . I am rather uneasy about the poor girl , ' he says , as it were to himself . ' Which Miss Vaughan , Sir ? ' says I. ' Your mistress , John . Ca n't you see what is written on it ? And now help me upstairs ; and if ever I spoke to you harshly , John Hoxton , I ask your pardon for it . You will find as I have n't forgotten you . ' And with that I helped him upstairs , Miss , and I had almost to carry him ; and then he says , ' Help me to bed , John . I would like to die in my bed , and it will save some trouble . And let me look out of the window ; what a lovely day it is , it reminds me quite of the South . So I set him up in the bed , Miss , handy altogether , and beautiful , and he could see two larks on the lawn , and he asked me what they was . Then he says , ' Thank you , John , you have done it wonderful well , and I hope they wo n't speak evil of me round this place , after I am gone . I have tried to do my duty , John , as between man and man : though I would be softer with them , if I had my time over again . Now send my daughter to me , though I wish I had seen my son , John . But I ought to be very thankful , and what 's more , I am . All of you likes Miss Lily , unless they tell me stories , John . ' ' Sir , ' says I , ' we wusships her , though not like our own Miss Vaughan . ' "
226036	226233	226020	226020	you	705	" So he looked very pleased at that , Miss , and he says again , ' John , let all that love her know that she is the living image of her mother . Now go and send her quickly ; but John , take care not to frighten my little darling . ' So I went and found Miss Lily got along with the Shetland pony and giving it bits of clover , and I sent her up and Jane too , for I was dreadfully frightened , and you away , Miss , at the time . And what come afterwards I ca n't tell , only no luncheon went up , and there was orders not to ring the bell for the servants ' dinner ; and I heard poor Miss Lily crying terrible all along the corridor , and I did hear say that his last words was , and he trying to raise his arms toward the window , ' Blessed be God , I can see my own Lily , ' but she warn't that side of the bed , Miss ; so he must have made some mistake . "
226234	226248	226026	226026	I	0	" No . He meant her mother . Where is my cousin now ? "
226249	226309	226020	226020	you	705	" In your own room , Miss , lying down , they tell me . She did take on so awful , Jane thought she would have died . But at last she brought her round a little , and persuaded her to lie down . She calls for you , Miss , every time she comes to herself . "
226522	226554	226512	226512	she	673	" Oh , Clara , is n't it hard to find him at last , and love him so , and only for three days , and then , and then — "
226555	226606	226516	226516	her	673	" And then , my pet , to let him go where his heart has been nearly twenty years . Would you be so selfish as to rob your mother of him ? And to go so happy . I am sure he has . Come with me and see . "
226607	226618	226516	226516	her	673	" Oh no , oh no . I can not . "
226633	226693	226512	226512	she	673	" Yes , you can , if you only try , and I am sure that he would wish it . That you and I should kneel hand in hand and bless him , as others shall kneel some day by us . What , Lily afraid of her father ! Then I have no fear of my Uncle . "
226714	226726	226697	226697	I	0	" If you really think he would wish it , dear — "
226727	226749	226861	226862	darling Judy	477	" Yes . It is a duty I owe him . He would be disappointed in me , if I failed . "
226750	226804	226697	226697	I	0	" Oh , how he longed to see you once more , dear Clara , But he felt that you were safe , and he said you would come to see him , though he could not see you . He talked of you quite to the last ; you and darling Conny . "

227025	227050	227016	227016	he	5134	" Now go down , Judy ; good little Judy , go to Mrs. Fletcher . A great friend of mine is with her . "

227089	227097	227082	227084	the poor child	6440	" I would go anywhere with you . "

231026	231451	231008	231008	his	2919	" Yes , my dear child , the close of my wasted and weary life . You may be surprised and perplexed at what I am about to tell you ; but you are not one of those low - minded ones , who condemn as superstition all beyond their philosophy . The very night after you brought me my new Lily , a sweet thing just like her mother , I lay for some hours awake , broad awake as I am now . I was thinking of my two Lilies , the lovely and loving creatures . I was not in the least excited , but calm , reflective , and happy . Soon after the clock struck two , at the time when our life burns lowest , I heard a soft voice , sweet as the music of heaven , call me by name three times . Of course I knew whose it was : too often that voice had murmured upon my bosom , for me not to know it now . Not rashly , but with a mind long since resolved , I answered : ' Sweetest mine'—her own artless and young endearment—'Sweetest mine , no longer will I keep you lonely . ' No answer came in words ; but the light , the golden light of my own love 's smile , as I had seen it in Corsica , when she came from the grave to comfort me . And now , as after that visit , I fell into deep and perfect rest , such rest as comes but rarely until the sleep of all . No wonder you and Lily thought me so strong next day . In the morning I knew and rejoiced in my quick departure . This cold obstruction was to be cast aside , this palsied frame to release the winged soul . On the third day I was to find and dwell with my Lily for ever . So on the first day I enjoyed the harmless pleasures of life , and could not bear you to leave me , because that would have turned them to pain . The second day I got through all the business that still remained , refreshing its dryness often with my sweet child 's society . On this , the third , I write to you , and am , through the grace of God , as calm and content , nay more content than if I were going to bed . "
231712	231745	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" Not only did we look upon his last fond wish as sacred , but we accomplished it in the manner that was likely to please him most . We put his own "
231748	231966	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" the little love - boat as they called it , into commission again , engaged a good captain and crew , and taking old Cora with us , set sail from Gloucester for the Mediterranean . Poor Cora was now all devotion to Conrad and Lily , ever since she had found that they were lawful blood and direct heirs of the Della Croce . The more recent part of the family story she had known only from her master 's version , and had set little store by the children as bearing the stamp of disgrace ; though she could not help loving sweet Lily . Now , by her evidence , coupled with my dear Uncle 's deposition , his relics , and documents , and my own testimony , confirmed by Balaam and Balak , we established very easily the birth and the claims of my Uncle Edgar 's children ; and the old Count Gaffori , most venerable of signors , would have kept us a month at least to go through all his accounts . He was entreated to retain his position as the guardian of our Lily . So far as our recent sorrow permitted enjoyment of scenery , we were all enchanted with the Balagna . At the funeral of "
231970	232651	232652	232652	Lucus	713	" whose name was still remembered and loved , nearly all the commune was present ; and many a dignified matron shed tears , who had smiled as a graceful girl , and strown flowers , at his wedding . They were burning with curiosity to see our beautiful Lily , for the tender tale had moved them , as Southern natures are moved ; and many of them had loved and gloried in her mother . But in spite of all this desire , not a prying glance fell on her , as she bowed in the hooded robe , and wept to the mournful vocero . Foremost of all stood old Petro and Marcantonia , who had found out and kissed with sobs of delight their beloved master 's daughter . For my part , I loved the Corsicans ; there is something so noble and simple about the men , so graceful , warm - hearted , and lady - like in the women ; and in a very short time I could understand more than half they said . The black Vendetta , they told me , was dying out among them , and in a few years would be but a wonder of the past . God in His mercy grant it . There must have been something surely in my Uncle Edgar 's nature , which won the Southern hearts , as my father won British affections . Such things I can not explain , or account for . I only know and feel them . We were all back at Vaughan St. Mary before the end of August , and found the farmer , the two chillers , and Beany Dawe as happy as if they were born and reared there . Old Cora was left at Veduta Tower ; and having obtained Mr. Dawe 's permission I presented her once and for all with the whole treasure of the gordit . She intends , however , to bequeath it to me in her will . Soon afterwards Conrad gave her a more substantial blessing ; for he sold the things left in Lucas Street , under letters of administration , as being the next of kin . All the proceeds he handed over to Cora , except one - tenth , which he presented to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . As many of the specimens , iguanodon , and other monsters , fetched prices as hard to explain away as themselves , poor Cora was amply provided for : all which of course she attributed to the holy Madonna 's heart . And now at last I understood how 19 , Grove Street had become No . 37 , Lucas Street . The change of number I have already explained ; the change of name was on this wise:—The builder , a rising man , who had bought the old part of the street , and built thereto the new one , had a son , a fine undergraduate , better skilled in the boats than in the books of Oxford . Reading hard one day , after his third pluck , this young man discovered that lucus was the Latin for grove . He smote his hand on his forehead , and a great idea presented itself . Had there not been both nymphs and philosophers of the grove ? The street that was his inheritance should be distinguished by nomenclature from the thousand groves of London , wherein the nightingale pipeth not , neither — but I am getting poetical , and do n't understand the Gradus . Enough , that he wrote at once and earnestly to his father , forgetting the vivid description , which was now growing stale , of his pluck — a result secured , as the Winchester gentlemen tell me , by learning too solid to carry — but begging that his Oxford career might at least be commemorated in and by the street that paid his bills there . "
232653	232670	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" he wrote plainly enough , and in very large letters , but the father read it "
232673	232695	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" No , said the mother , she was sure Alexander never meant such a low thing as that , it was "
232697	232740	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" of course ; why the Lucases were her own cousins , and Rosa such a nice girl , she saw how it was , that she did , and Alexander might have done worse . And so it was painted most bravely "
232744	232905	231746	231746	Lilyflower	632	" and the builder was n't going to make a fool of himself , when Alexander protested . When John Huxtable set off for home , just in time to see to his harvest , which is always late round Exmoor , I kissed him — ay , Conny , you saw it — and thrust , during his amazement , something far down into his mighty pocket , which something he was not upon any account to look at until he got home . It was a deed , prepared by our solicitors , presenting him with the fee simple of Tossil 's Barton farm . True , I was not of age , but I signed it as if I had been , and Conny and I again signed it , when we paid our first visit there . Perhaps , in strict law , it binds not my interest even now ; but if ever any one claiming "
232918	233070	232696	232696	Lucas	714	" me , forgets the Vaughan honour and dares to dream of that farm , I 'll be at him as sure as a ghost ; and I trust before that time comes , the farmer will have sound title by immemorial years of possession . He is now a prosperous man ; and has never found it necessary to give up his beer , as he threatened Young John , who is just like his father , cleaves fast to Tabby Badcock , now a blooming maiden ; but my Sally has more than balanced that imminent loss of caste , by fixing the eyes and transfixing the heart of George Tamlin , the son of our principal tenant , and himself of Devonshire origin . The young lady comes to and fro every six weeks , and is to be married from our house , when her father considers her "
233074	233340	232696	232696	Lucas	714	" Beany Dawe , who does not like work , still lives at Tossil 's Barton , and is in receipt of a pension of sixpence a day from Government , as a bard at last appreciated . As for me , Clara Vaughan , on the very day after that which released me from my teens ( counting forward , as we do , till we count receding years ) , to wit on the 31st of December , 1851 , I did not change my name , but wrote it in the old church register , half an inch below a better and firmer hand . There was no fuss or frippery ; no four clergymen and ten bridesmaids simpering at one another . Our good vicar represented the one class , dear Lily and Annie Franks the other . My godfather , newly disclosed for the purpose , gave me away very gracefully , and young Peter Green helped Conrad . Lily Vaughan looked so exquisite , so deliciously lovely , that nobody in the whole world — Now Conny , hold your tongue , I never fish for compliments , do n't degrade yourself so for a kiss , of course I know all my perfections , but how can I care about them , when you say they belong to you?—Lily Vaughan , I say once more , was such a sunrise of loveliness , that young Peter Green , just new from his Oxford honours , collapsed , and fell over the railings , and wedged his head in the "
233343	233575	232696	232696	Lucas	714	" or whatever those nice young gentlemen , who see the duty of wearing strait waistcoats , are pleased to denominate it . Ah , Little Distaff Lane , most unconnubial title , ah firm of Green , Vowler , and Green , your Hercules holds the distaff , and holds it , alas , in his heart ! From that shock he never recovered , until we had at Vaughan Park a really merry wedding ; and I , ah me , I could not dance just then , but I showered roses upon them , for the shadow of death was past . Old Mr. Green,—nay , nay , not fifty yet , by our Lady,—Mr . Peter Green the elder , came down here for the occasion , and I hardly ever took such a fancy to any man before . He seemed to know almost everything , not by the skin , as Dr. Ross seemed to hold things , but by the marrow and fibrine of their alimentary part . And withal such a perfect gentleman : he kept in the horns of his knowledge , instead of exalting them , and making us wish for hay on them , while tossed in headlong ignorance . Scant as I am of space , I must tell how he behaved , when his son revealed his attachment . "

233681	233812	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" Having behaved so nobly , for this boy was his only hope , he deserved to find , as he did , that if he had searched the world he could not have hit upon any other so desirable for his son , as the daughter of his old friend . The only mistake he has made is that he so adores her , he can not bear her to be in Corsica ; though the trade they conduct is worth at least fifty thousand a year . When Lily fell in love , I told her that it was because she had an eye for the olives ; and olives enough the darling has , I trow , and olive branches too . The eldest is called Clara . "
233816	234118	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" I do n't like the sound altogether ; but the substance is something beautiful , and the freshest of all Spring verdure . Nevertheless , my Clara is an inch larger round the calf , and I think her eyelashes are longer . Her hair weighs more , that is certain . We compare them very often ; for they live only half the year at Veduta Tower . In the summer heats they are here , and the children between them , my own every bit as bad , leave dear Annie Elton ( Annie Franks of old ) , uncommonly few British Queens . It is all Mr. Shelfer 's fault . What is the use of a gardener , if he allows dessert all the day long ? Every autumn we go to Corsica to help at the olive harvest , and rarely we enjoy it . The Old Veduta Tower is like a nest in the ivy , chirruping with young voices ; and the happy sleep of the two who loved so well is dreaming , if dream it can or care to do , of the fairest flowers in Europe , scattered there by little soft hands . Conny is wild every time about the Rogliano and Luri ; and if Peter Green listens to him — which every one does , except me — he will introduce , very slowly of course , those fine - bodied yet aerial wines to the noble British public , that loves not even intoxication , unless it be adulterated . Oh , queer Mrs. Shelfer , oh Balaam and Balak , shall I pretermit your annals ? The two Sheriff 's officers , having secured their reward , set up therewith a public - house called the "
234123	234194	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" which soon became the head quarters of all who are agents or patients in the machinery of levying . As at such times all people drink and pay more than double , the public - house has already a Queensbench - ful of good - will . Poor Mrs. Shelfer and Charley did not invest the 325*l . * altogether judiciously : at least , it went mainly to purchase "
234198	234247	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" whose time does not begin to run till the purchaser 's is over . But Patty , I am glad to say , has still that 30*l . * a year of her own , left to her in the funds by good and grateful Miss Minto . "
234294	234404	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" Be this as it may , what is much more to the purpose is that Mr. Shelfer can not touch it . And now I have pride in announcing , for I never expected such glory , that all the cats and birds , squirrels , mice , and monkeys , live , like the happy family , in our northern lodge , where Patty is most useful and happy as the Queen of the poultry . In a word , they keep the gate , not of their enemies , but of old and grateful friends . I expected to see at least a leading article in the "
234407	234537	233813	233814	Clara Green	720	" when Mr. Shelfer left the metropolis ; but they let him go very easily for the sake of the discount market . They gave him only two - and - twenty dinners ; but when he first came to Vaughan Park , how he wanted country air ! Now he attends to the wall - trees , and the avenue , and I hope finds harmony there . At any rate , he never breaks it by any undue exertion . Nevertheless , his very long pipe is of some account with the green fly , which has been very bad on our peaches , ever since they repealed the corn laws . Mr. Shelfer , accordingly , is compelled to spend half his time in smoking them . "

Of the four men in that room , the one whom I had noticed least was the very one whom he had meant me especially to observe . At least , so he said ; but I fully believed , and did not scruple to tell him , that he had discovered little beyond the information and description given at the time by Mr. Edgar Vaughan . These he had disinterred from the archives of Bow Street and Whitehall , and was then trying to apply them . However , I forgave him freely ; inasmuch as , but for my blindness , even blind love would have known me as an objectionable being . And now I come to a real grievance . When there is another Miss Clara — such a beauty ! I ca n't tell you — and a little Harry , for whose sake this tale is told — why will every one on these premises , even the under - gardener 's boy , persist in calling me "
235375	235478	235372	235373	Miss Clara	293	" It makes me stamp sometimes , and such a bad example that is for my children . Dear me , if either of my ducklings were to carry on as I did at their age , I would cut down immediately the largest birch - tree on the property , and order a hogshead of salt . But , to return to that contumely — is it to be suspected that I was more forcible and pronounced , in the days of my trial and misery , than now when I am the happiest of all the young mothers of England ?
