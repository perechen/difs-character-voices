246	256	242	242	he	376	“ What an extremely nice house to come into ! ”
329	341	312	312	Katharine	129	“ Now , do you think we ’re enjoying ourselves enormously ? ”
343	349	350	350	she	129	“ Mr. Denham , mother , ”
609	634	595	596	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Now , what would you do if you were married to an engineer , and had to live in Manchester , Mr. Denham ? ”
635	642	645	649	a thin , elderly gentleman	395	“ Surely she could learn Persian , ”
651	670	645	649	a thin , elderly gentleman	395	“ Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with whom she could read Persian ? ”
671	685	686	686	Katharine	129	“ A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester , ”
798	806	807	807	he	131	“ Have you ever been to Manchester ? ”
811	814	815	815	she	129	“ Never , ”
818	828	829	829	Katharine	129	“ Why do you object to it , then ? ”
972	987	988	988	she	129	“ I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester , ”
1030	1046	1047	1047	he	132	“ In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration , Katharine decidedly hits the mark , ”
1189	1195	1197	1198	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Oh , Mr. Fortescue , ”
1204	1236	1197	1198	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ I had just written to say how I envied her ! I was thinking of the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens , who read nothing but the “
1239	1270	1197	1198	Mrs. Hilbery	130	” and snuff the candles . Have they all disappeared ? I told her she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets that depress one so . ”
1271	1277	1279	1281	the thin gentleman	419	“ There is the University , ”
1295	1315	1317	1317	Katharine	129	“ I know there are moors there , because I read about them in a book the other day , ”
1319	1332	1317	1317	Katharine	129	“ I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family , ”
1801	1816	1817	1818	her mother	380	“ Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada , Katharine ? ”
1821	1826	1817	1818	her mother	380	“ Trafalgar , mother . ”
1827	1884	1817	1818	her mother	380	“ Trafalgar , of course ! How stupid of me ! Another cup of tea , with a thin slice of lemon in it , and then , dear Mr. Fortescue , please explain my absurd little puzzle . One ca n’t help believing gentlemen with Roman noses , even if one meets them in omnibuses . ”
2142	2246	2247	2247	She	435	“ D’you know , Mr. Denham , you remind me so much of dear Mr. Ruskin .... Is it his tie , Katharine , or his hair , or the way he sits in his chair ? Do tell me , Mr. Denham , are you an admirer of Ruskin ? Some one , the other day , said to me , ‘ Oh , no , we do n’t read Ruskin , Mrs. Hilbery . ’ What do you read , I wonder?—for you ca n’t spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the earth . ”
2284	2356	2357	2357	she	435	“ I ’m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things , Katharine . I ’m sure he ’s not like that dreadful young man , Mr. Ponting , who told me that he considered it our duty to live exclusively in the present . After all , what is the present ? Half of it ’s the past , and the better half , too , I should say , ”
2397	2407	2387	2387	Katharine	129	“ Perhaps you would like to see the pictures , ”
2595	2598	2585	2585	she	129	“ There ! ”
2709	2722	2724	2724	she	129	“ This is his writing - table . He used this pen , ”
2788	2809	2810	2810	she	129	“ I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any one is nowadays . This , ”
2826	2858	2810	2810	she	129	“ is the original manuscript of the ‘ Ode to Winter . ’ The early poems are far less corrected than the later . Would you like to look at it ? ”
2963	2976	2977	2977	she	129	“ This is a copy of the first edition of the poems , ”
2994	3010	3011	3011	She	129	“ which contains several poems that have not been reprinted , as well as corrections . ”
3031	3134	3011	3011	She	129	“ That lady in blue is my great - grandmother , by Millington . Here is my uncle ’s walking - stick — he was Sir Richard Warburton , you know , and rode with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow . And then , let me see — oh , that ’s the original Alardyce , 1697 , the founder of the family fortunes , with his wife . Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their crest and initials . We think it must have been given them to celebrate their silver wedding - day . ”
3459	3472	3451	3451	he	131	“ You must be very proud of your family , Miss Hilbery . ”
3473	3479	3484	3484	she	129	“ Yes , I am , ”
3487	3498	3484	3484	she	129	“ Do you think there ’s anything wrong in that ? ”
3499	3522	3523	3523	he	131	“ Wrong ? How should it be wrong ? It must be a bore , though , showing your things to visitors , ”
3527	3535	3523	3523	he	131	“ Not if the visitors like them . ”
3536	3548	3549	3549	he	131	“ Is n’t it difficult to live up to your ancestors ? ”
3552	3564	3565	3565	Katharine	129	“ I dare say I should n’t try to write poetry , ”
3568	3595	3596	3596	Denham	131	“ No . And that ’s what I should hate . I could n’t bear my grandfather to cut me out . And , after all , ”
3609	3668	3669	3669	he	131	“ it ’s not your grandfather only . You ’re cut out all the way round . I suppose you come of one of the most distinguished families in England . There are the Warburtons and the Mannings — and you ’re related to the Otways , are n’t you ? I read it all in some magazine , ”
3672	3679	3680	3680	Katharine	129	“ The Otways are my cousins , ”
3683	3686	3688	3688	Denham	131	“ Well , ”
3704	3707	3709	3709	Katharine	129	“ Well , ”
3711	3722	3709	3709	Katharine	129	“ I do n’t see that you ’ve proved anything . ”
3817	3820	3822	3822	Denham	131	“ Well , ”
3923	3933	3934	3934	Katharine	129	“ But are n’t you proud of your family ? ”
3937	3940	3942	3942	Denham	131	“ No , ”
3944	3967	3942	3942	Denham	131	“ We ’ve never done anything to be proud of — unless you count paying one ’s bills a matter for pride . ”
3968	3974	3975	3975	Katharine	129	“ That sounds rather dull , ”
3978	3986	3987	3987	Denham	131	“ You would think us horribly dull , ”
3990	4010	4011	4011	Katharine	129	“ Yes , I might find you dull , but I do n’t think I should find you ridiculous , ”
4026	4051	4011	4011	Katharine	129	“ No — because we ’re not in the least ridiculous . We ’re a respectable middle - class family , living at Highgate . ”
4052	4070	4071	4071	Denham	131	“ We do n’t live at Highgate , but we ’re middle class too , I suppose . ”
4093	4103	4105	4105	Katharine	129	“ That belonged to Clive , so we say , ”
4116	4122	4123	4123	Denham	131	“ Is it a lie ? ”
4126	4143	4123	4123	Denham	131	“ It ’s a family tradition . I do n’t know that we can prove it . ”
4144	4157	4159	4159	Denham	131	“ You see , we do n’t have traditions in our family , ”
4161	4167	4168	4168	Katharine	129	“ You sound very dull , ”
4176	4181	4182	4182	Denham	131	“ Merely middle class , ”
4185	4207	4182	4182	Denham	131	“ You pay your bills , and you speak the truth . I do n’t see why you should despise us . ”
4222	4237	4238	4238	he	131	“ I should n’t like to be you ; that ’s all I said , ”
4255	4269	4243	4243	he	131	“ No , but one never would like to be any one else . ”
4270	4284	4243	4243	he	131	“ I should . I should like to be lots of other people . ”
4285	4291	4292	4292	Katharine	129	“ Then why not us ? ”
4391	4401	4402	4402	he	131	“ You ’ll never know anything at first hand , ”
4408	4444	4402	4402	he	131	“ It ’s all been done for you . You ’ll never know the pleasure of buying things after saving up for them , or reading books for the first time , or making discoveries . ”
4445	4449	4450	4450	Katharine	129	“ Go on , ”
4478	4492	4493	4493	he	131	“ Of course , I do n’t know how you spend your time , ”
4500	4528	4493	4493	he	131	“ but I suppose you have to show people round . You are writing a life of your grandfather , are n’t you ? And this kind of thing”—he
4542	4550	4551	4551	She	129	laughter—“must take up a lot of time . ”
4584	4593	4594	4594	she	129	“ You ’ve got it very nearly right , ”
4597	4611	4594	4594	she	129	“ but I only help my mother . I do n’t write myself . ”
4612	4619	4620	4620	he	131	“ Do you do anything yourself ? ”
4623	4629	4630	4630	she	129	“ What do you mean ? ”
4633	4648	4630	4630	she	129	“ I do n’t leave the house at ten and come back at six . ”
4649	4656	4657	4658	Mr. Denham	131	“ I do n’t mean that . ”
4725	4735	4736	4736	she	129	“ Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays , ”
4739	4741	4736	4736	she	129	“ You see”—she
4749	4784	4736	4736	she	129	poems—“we do n’t even print as well as they did , and as for poets or painters or novelists — there are none ; so , at any rate , I ’m not singular . ”
4785	4795	4796	4796	Denham	131	“ No , we have n’t any great men , ”
4799	4833	4796	4796	Denham	131	“ I ’m very glad that we have n’t . I hate great men . The worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation . ”
5150	5153	5154	5154	she	129	“ Well , ”
5157	5168	5154	5154	she	129	“ how do you like our things , Mr. Denham ? ”
5204	5212	5213	5213	she	130	“ There are some books that live , ”
5216	5332	5213	5213	she	130	“ They are young with us , and they grow old with us . Are you fond of poetry , Mr. Denham ? But what an absurd question to ask ! The truth is , dear Mr. Fortescue has almost tired me out . He is so eloquent and so witty , so searching and so profound that , after half an hour or so , I feel inclined to turn out all the lights . But perhaps he ’d be more wonderful than ever in the dark . What d’you think , Katharine ? Shall we give a little party in complete darkness ? There ’d have to be bright rooms for the bores .... ”
5341	5353	5334	5335	Mr. Denham	131	“ But we ’ve any number of things to show you ! ”
5364	5464	5465	5465	She	130	“ Books , pictures , china , manuscripts , and the very chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of Darnley ’s murder . I must lie down for a little , and Katharine must change her dress ( though she ’s wearing a very pretty one ) , but if you do n’t mind being left alone , supper will be at eight . I dare say you ’ll write a poem of your own while you ’re waiting . Ah , how I love the firelight ! Does n’t our room look charming ? ”
5492	5496	5497	5497	she	130	“ Dear things ! ”
5500	5581	5497	5497	she	130	“ Dear chairs and tables ! How like old friends they are — faithful , silent friends . Which reminds me , Katharine , little Mr. Anning is coming to - night , and Tite Street , and Cadogan Square .... Do remember to get that drawing of your great - uncle glazed . Aunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here , and I know how it would hurt me to see my father in a broken glass . ”
6175	6192	6205	6205	his	457	“ She ’ll do .... Yes , Katharine Hilbery’ll do .... I ’ll take Katharine Hilbery . ”
7102	7117	7096	7096	her	532	“ Mother says , are n’t you coming down , Ralph ? Uncle Joseph — ”
7118	7128	7130	7130	Ralph	154	“ They ’re to bring my dinner up here , ”
7214	7217	7219	7219	Ralph	154	“ Ralph ! ”
7597	7601	7602	7602	He	154	“ Critical Review . ”
8033	8043	8030	8030	her	129	“ although she ’s wearing such a pretty one , ”
8280	8283	8271	8272	The person	568	“ Ralph ? ”
8290	8293	8271	8272	The person	568	“ Joan ? ”
8294	8306	8271	8272	The person	568	“ I was coming up , but I saw your notice . ”
8307	8316	8317	8317	He	154	“ Well , come along in , then . ”
8487	8533	8479	8479	She	156	“ It ’s about Charles and Uncle John ’s offer .... Mother ’s been talking to me . She says she ca n’t afford to pay for him after this term . She says she ’ll have to ask for an overdraft as it is . ”
8534	8541	8543	8543	Ralph	154	“ That ’s simply not true , ”
8545	8563	8564	8564	Ralph	154	“ No . I thought not . But she wo n’t believe me when I say it . ”
8590	8596	8597	8597	she	578	“ I ’m not interrupting ? ”
8623	8636	8637	8637	he	154	“ She does n’t understand that one ’s got to take risks , ”
8642	8664	8637	8637	he	154	“ I believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was the sort of boy to profit by it . ”
8665	8675	8677	8677	Ralph	154	“ He ’s got brains , has n’t he ? ”
8723	8759	8760	8760	Ralph	154	“ In some ways he ’s fearfully backward , though , compared with what you were at his age . And he ’s difficult at home , too . He makes Molly slave for him . ”
8801	8804	8798	8798	He	154	“ she , ”
8828	8844	8823	8823	he	154	“ It ’s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen ! ”
8845	8855	8856	8856	she	156	“ Nobody wants to stick him into an office , ”
8958	8963	8964	8964	he	154	“ The truth is , ”
8968	8993	8964	8964	he	154	“ that I ought to have accepted Uncle John ’s offer . I should have been making six hundred a year by this time . ”
8994	9004	9005	9005	Joan	156	“ I do n’t think that for a moment , ”
9014	9036	9005	9005	Joan	156	“ The question , to my mind , is , whether we could n’t cut down our expenses in some way . ”
9037	9042	8964	8964	he	154	“ A smaller house ? ”
9043	9049	9005	9005	Joan	156	“ Fewer servants , perhaps . ”
9081	9089	9076	9076	Ralph	154	“ It ’s out of the question . ”
9171	9179	9144	9144	He	154	“ If mother wo n’t run risks — ”
9180	9192	9144	9144	He	154	“ You really ca n’t expect her to sell out again . ”
9193	9221	9231	9231	Joan	156	“ She ought to look upon it as an investment ; but if she wo n’t , we must find some other way , that ’s all . ”
9404	9420	9421	9421	she	156	“ I think you ’d be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles , ”
9424	9449	9421	9421	she	156	“ Fond as I am of him , he does n’t seem to me exactly brilliant .... Besides , why should you be sacrificed ? ”
9450	9455	9456	9456	Ralph	154	“ My dear Joan , ”
9468	9559	9456	9456	Ralph	154	“ do n’t you see that we ’ve all got to be sacrificed ? What ’s the use of denying it ? What ’s the use of struggling against it ? So it always has been , so it always will be . We ’ve got no money and we never shall have any money . We shall just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop and die , worn out , as most people do , when one comes to think of it . ”
9585	9593	9579	9579	she	156	“ Are n’t you happy , Ralph ? ”
9594	9624	9625	9625	He	154	“ No . Are you ? Perhaps I ’m as happy as most people , though . God knows whether I ’m happy or not . What is happiness ? ”
9670	9673	9674	9674	she	578	“ Happiness , ”
9712	9720	9721	9721	she	578	“ Hilda was here to - day , ”
9733	9745	9746	9746	Ralph	154	“ She brought Bobbie — he ’s a fine boy now . ”
10031	10038	10039	10039	Joan	156	“ Shall you talk to mother ? ”
10042	10073	10074	10074	Ralph	154	“ Because , you see , the thing ’s got to be settled , one way or another . Charles must write to Uncle John if he ’s going there . ”
10078	10089	10090	10090	he	154	“ I suppose it does n’t much matter either way , ”
10093	10104	10090	10090	he	154	“ He ’s doomed to misery in the long run . ”
10114	10122	10123	10123	she	156	“ You know you ’re talking nonsense , ”
10126	10151	10123	10123	she	156	“ It does n’t hurt any one to have to earn their own living . I ’m very glad I have to earn mine . ”
10175	10197	10168	10168	he	154	“ Is n’t that only because you ’ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself ? You never have time for anything decent — ”
10198	10203	10123	10123	she	156	“ As for instance ? ”
10204	10237	10123	10123	she	156	“ Well , going for walks , or music , or books , or seeing interesting people . You never do anything that ’s really worth doing any more than I do . ”
10238	10254	10255	10255	she	156	“ I always think you could make this room much nicer , if you liked , ”
10258	10289	10255	10255	she	156	“ What does it matter what sort of room I have when I ’m forced to spend all the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office ? ”
10290	10304	10123	10123	she	156	“ You said two days ago that you found the law so interesting . ”
10305	10319	10255	10255	she	156	“ So it is if one could afford to know anything about it . ”
10321	10332	10333	10333	Joan	156	“ That ’s Herbert only just going to bed now , ”
10345	10357	10333	10333	Joan	156	“ And then he wo n’t get up in the morning . ”
10430	10437	10438	10438	he	154	“ D’you ever pay calls now ? ”
10442	10456	10438	10438	he	154	“ I do n’t often have the time . Why do you ask ? ”
10457	10476	10528	10528	he	154	“ It might be a good thing , to get to know new people , that ’s all . ”
10477	10481	10483	10483	Joan	156	“ Poor Ralph ! ”
10490	10511	10483	10483	Joan	156	“ You think your sister ’s getting very old and very dull — that ’s it , is n’t it ? ”
10512	10522	10523	10523	he	154	“ I do n’t think anything of the kind , ”
10531	10573	10528	10528	he	154	“ But you lead a dog ’s life , Joan . When you ’re not working in an office , you ’re worrying over the rest of us . And I ’m not much good to you , I ’m afraid . ”
10918	10922	10923	10923	he	2939	“ Hereditary Genius , ”

13362	13472	13354	13354	she	130	“ Well done , Katharine ! What a wonderful head for business you ’ve got ! Now I shall keep this before me , and every day I shall make a little mark in my pocketbook , and on the last day of all — let me think , what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all ? If it were n’t the winter we could take a jaunt to Italy . They say Switzerland ’s very lovely in the snow , except for the cold . But , as you say , the great thing is to finish the book . Now let me see — ”
15280	15316	15263	15263	her	130	“ your wicked old Uncle Judge Peter , who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom . Thank Heaven , Katharine , I ’ve not a drop of him in me ! ”
15954	15960	15961	15961	she	175	“ And here we are , ”
15975	15980	15961	15961	she	175	“ talking about art . ”
16383	16386	16387	16387	he	154	“ Alone ? ”
16400	16406	16407	16407	she	175	“ I am sometimes alone , ”
16410	16419	16420	16420	he	154	“ But you expect a great many people , ”
16427	16444	16420	16420	he	154	“ It ’s like a room on the stage . Who is it to - night ? ”
16445	16471	16472	16472	Ralph	154	“ William Rodney , upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor . I expect a good solid paper , with plenty of quotations from the classics . ”
16496	16512	16513	16513	he	154	“ I suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own stockings , ”
16516	16528	16529	16529	she	175	“ I ’m only one of a great many thousands really , ”
16532	16592	16529	16529	she	175	“ though I must admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in . And now that you ’re here I do n’t think myself remarkable at all . How horrid of you ! But I ’m afraid you ’re much more remarkable than I am . You ’ve done much more than I ’ve done . ”
16593	16608	16610	16610	Ralph	154	“ If that ’s your standard , you ’ve nothing to be proud of , ”
16613	16631	16632	16632	she	175	“ Well , I must reflect with Emerson that it ’s being and not doing that matters , ”
16635	16638	16639	16639	Ralph	154	“ Emerson ? ”
16645	16656	16639	16639	Ralph	154	“ You do n’t mean to say you read Emerson ? ”
16657	16672	16673	16673	she	175	“ Perhaps it was n’t Emerson ; but why should n’t I read Emerson ? ”
16682	16710	16673	16673	she	175	“ There ’s no reason that I know of . It ’s the combination that ’s odd — books and stockings . The combination is very odd . ”
16765	16771	16772	16772	she	175	“ You always say that , ”
16775	16819	16772	16772	she	175	“ I assure you it ’s a common ‘ combination , ’ as you call it , in the houses of the clergy . The only thing that ’s odd about me is that I enjoy them both — Emerson and the stocking . ”
16829	16841	16826	16826	Ralph	154	“ Damn those people ! I wish they were n’t coming ! ”
16842	16854	16856	16856	Mary	175	“ It ’s only Mr. Turner , on the floor below , ”
16878	16885	16886	16886	Ralph	154	“ Will there be a crowd ? ”
16893	16930	16886	16886	Ralph	154	“ There ’ll be the Morrises and the Crashaws , and Dick Osborne , and Septimus , and all that set . Katharine Hilbery is coming , by the way , so William Rodney told me . ”
16931	16935	16936	16936	Ralph	154	“ Katharine Hilbery ! ”
16939	16944	16936	16936	Ralph	154	“ You know her ? ”
16952	16964	16945	16945	Mary	175	“ I went to a tea - party at her house . ”
17007	17022	17023	17023	she	175	“ But , in spite of what you say , I do admire her , ”
17026	17051	17023	17023	she	175	“ I ’ve only seen her once or twice , but she seems to me to be what one calls a ‘ personality . ’ ”
17052	17073	16992	16992	He	154	“ I did n’t mean to abuse her . I only felt that she was n’t very sympathetic to me . ”
17074	17087	17023	17023	she	175	“ They say she ’s going to marry that queer creature Rodney . ”
17088	17103	17023	17023	she	175	“ Marry Rodney ? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her . ”
17104	17114	17115	17115	Mary	175	“ Now that ’s my door , all right , ”
17168	17171	17173	17173	they	847	“ Oh ! ”
17404	17418	17383	17384	Mr. Rodney	183	“ In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry — ”
17725	17733	17720	17720	Denham	154	“ Fancy marrying a creature like that ! ”
17961	17989	17937	17937	he	183	“ Well , Katharine , I hope I ’ve made a big enough fool of myself even for you ! It was terrible ! terrible ! terrible ! ”
17990	17999	18000	18000	Katharine	129	“ Hush ! You must answer their questions , ”
18092	18095	18096	18096	he	183	“ Idiot ! ”
18099	18108	18096	18096	he	183	“ He ’s misunderstood every word I said ! ”
18109	18116	18117	18117	Katharine	129	“ Well then , answer him , ”
18121	18151	18152	18152	he	183	“ No , I sha n’t ! They ’d only laugh at me . Why did I let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature ? ”
18514	18526	18496	18497	Mary Datchet	175	“ That was what I call a first - rate paper . ”
18597	18610	18612	18612	Mary	175	“ Let ’s go and tell him how much we liked it , ”
18654	18662	18663	18663	Mary	175	“ That was a very interesting paper , ”
18681	18693	18663	18663	Mary	175	“ Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace ? ”
18714	18729	18730	18730	he	176	“ Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure ? ”
18743	18756	18757	18757	she	129	“ He says he does n’t mind what we think of him , ”
18760	18775	18757	18757	she	129	“ He says we do n’t care a rap for art of any kind . ”
18776	18789	18790	18790	Rodney	176	“ I asked her to pity me , and she teases me ! ”
18793	18805	18806	18806	Mary	175	“ I do n’t intend to pity you , Mr. Rodney , ”
18814	18834	18806	18806	Mary	175	“ When a paper ’s a failure , nobody says anything , whereas now , just listen to them ! ”
18871	18881	18882	18882	Rodney	176	“ D’you think that ’s all about my paper ? ”
18898	18904	18906	18906	Mary	175	“ Of course it is , ”
18908	18916	18906	18906	Mary	175	“ It was a very suggestive paper . ”
18929	18951	18952	18952	he	154	“ It ’s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it ’s been a success or not , ”
18955	18971	18952	18952	he	154	“ If I were you , Rodney , I should be very pleased with myself . ”
18999	19002	18982	18982	he	176	“ suggestive . ”
19003	19036	18982	18982	he	176	“ Did you agree at all , Denham , with what I said about Shakespeare ’s later use of imagery ? I ’m afraid I did n’t altogether make my meaning plain . ”
19094	19110	19087	19087	He	154	“ Did you remember to get that picture glazed before your aunt came to dinner ? ”
19387	19400	19401	19401	he	154	“ You remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess ? ”
19652	19655	19644	19644	she	175	“ personality , ”
19671	19685	19686	19686	she	175	“ They ’re exactly like a flock of sheep , are n’t they ? ”
19707	19719	19720	19720	she	129	“ I wonder what they ’re making such a noise about ? ”
19723	19730	19720	19720	she	129	“ The Elizabethans , I suppose . ”
19731	19762	19686	19686	she	175	“ No , I do n’t think it ’s got anything to do with the Elizabethans . There ! Did n’t you hear them say , ‘ Insurance Bill ’ ? ”
19763	19773	19774	19774	Mary	175	“ I wonder why men always talk about politics ? ”
19777	19791	19774	19774	Mary	175	“ I suppose , if we had votes , we should , too . ”
19792	19813	19686	19686	she	175	“ I dare say we should . And you spend your life in getting us votes , do n’t you ? ”
19814	19818	19820	19820	Mary	175	“ I do , ”
19824	19836	19820	19820	Mary	175	“ From ten to six every day I ’m at it . ”
19874	19891	19892	19892	she	129	“ I suppose you ’re one of the people who think we should all have professions , ”
19911	19916	19918	19918	Mary	175	“ Oh dear no , ”
19922	19930	19931	19931	Katharine	129	“ Well , I think I do , ”
19939	19966	19931	19931	Katharine	129	“ You will always be able to say that you ’ve done something , whereas , in a crowd like this , I feel rather melancholy . ”
19967	19977	19978	19978	Mary	175	“ In a crowd ? Why in a crowd ? ”
20001	20027	20028	20028	she	129	“ Do n’t you see how many different things these people care about ? And I want to beat them down — I only mean , ”
20032	20052	20028	20028	she	129	“ that I want to assert myself , and it ’s difficult , if one has n’t a profession . ”
20123	20136	20137	20137	Katharine	129	“ Ah , but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies ! ”
20163	20179	20180	20180	Mary	175	“ One does n’t necessarily trample upon people ’s bodies because one runs an office , ”
20183	20189	20190	20190	Katharine	129	“ No . Perhaps not , ”
20273	20282	20283	20283	she	175	“ Yes , they ’re very like sheep , ”
20288	20299	20300	20300	Katharine	129	“ And yet they are very clever — at least , ”
20303	20312	20300	20300	Katharine	129	“ I suppose they have all read Webster . ”
20313	20350	20300	20300	Katharine	129	“ Surely you do n’t think that a proof of cleverness ? I ’ve read Webster , I ’ve read Ben Jonson , but I do n’t think myself clever — not exactly , at least . ”
20351	20360	20361	20361	Katharine	129	“ I think you must be very clever , ”
20364	20373	20361	20361	Katharine	129	“ Why ? Because I run an office ? ”
20374	20397	20398	20398	Mary	175	“ I was n’t thinking of that . I was thinking how you live alone in this room , and have parties . ”
20404	20466	20398	20398	Mary	175	“ It means , chiefly , a power of being disagreeable to one ’s own family , I think . I have that , perhaps . I did n’t want to live at home , and I told my father . He did n’t like it .... But then I have a sister , and you have n’t , have you ? ”
20467	20476	20508	20508	She	129	“ No , I have n’t any sisters . ”
20477	20487	20488	20488	Mary	175	“ You are writing a life of your grandfather ? ”
20511	20520	20508	20508	She	129	“ Yes , I am helping my mother , ”
20601	20604	20594	20594	Mary	175	“ egoist . ”
20605	20611	20612	20612	she	175	“ She ’s an egoist , ”
20643	20657	20658	20658	Katharine	129	“ Heavens , what a mess there ’ll be to - morrow morning ! ”
20661	20675	20676	20676	Mary	175	“ I hope you do n’t sleep in this room , Miss Datchet ? ”
20679	20686	20687	20687	Katharine	129	“ What are you laughing at ? ”
20690	20697	20687	20687	Katharine	129	“ I wo n’t tell you . ”
20698	20715	20726	20726	She	129	“ Let me guess . You were laughing because you thought I ’d changed the conversation ? ”
20716	20719	20726	20726	She	129	“ No . ”
20720	20725	20726	20726	She	129	“ Because you think — ”
20729	20747	20726	20726	She	129	“ If you want to know , I was laughing at the way you said Miss Datchet . ”
20748	20759	20726	20726	She	129	“ Mary , then . Mary , Mary , Mary . ”
20791	20795	20797	20797	Mary	175	“ Mary Datchet , ”
20799	20815	20797	20797	Mary	175	“ It ’s not such an imposing name as Katharine Hilbery , I ’m afraid . ”
20968	20984	20985	20985	His	154	“ I wonder , Miss Hilbery , whether you remembered to get that picture glazed ? ”
20998	21004	21005	21005	Mary	175	“ Oh , you idiot ! ”
21047	21050	21058	21058	Katharine	129	“ mensa . ”
21051	21057	21058	21058	Katharine	129	“ Picture — what picture ? ”
21061	21090	21091	21094	The three of them	911	“ Oh , at home , you mean — that Sunday afternoon . Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came ? Yes , I think I remembered it . ”
21332	21344	21345	21345	Denham	154	“ You know the names of the stars , I suppose ? ”
21379	21393	21370	21370	She	129	“ I know how to find the Pole star if I ’m lost . ”
21394	21405	21372	21372	her	129	“ I do n’t suppose that often happens to you . ”
21406	21416	21417	21417	she	129	“ No . Nothing interesting ever happens to me , ”
21420	21435	21436	21436	he	154	“ I think you make a system of saying disagreeable things , Miss Hilbery , ”
21448	21469	21436	21436	he	154	“ I suppose it ’s one of the characteristics of your class . They never talk seriously to their inferiors . ”
21526	21535	21536	21536	she	129	“ In what sense are you my inferior ? ”
21630	21641	21642	21642	Katharine	129	“ I do n’t think I understand what you mean , ”
22035	22037	22028	22028	his	189	“ hum ”
22039	22042	22028	22028	his	189	“ ha , ”
22391	22404	22375	22375	he	154	“ I hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth . ”
22612	22640	22598	22598	Rodney	176	“ I promise I wo n’t say another word about it , Katharine ! But do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water . ”
22656	22673	22674	22674	she	129	“ I ’m sure one can smell the sea , with the wind blowing this way , ”
22742	22745	22746	22746	Rodney	176	“ Ah ! ”
22758	22806	22807	22807	he	176	“ why ca n’t one say how beautiful it all is ? Why am I condemned for ever , Katharine , to feel what I ca n’t express ? And the things I can give there ’s no use in my giving . Trust me , Katharine , ”
22811	22891	22807	22807	he	176	“ I wo n’t speak of it again . But in the presence of beauty — look at the iridescence round the moon!—one feels — one feels — Perhaps if you married me — I’m half a poet , you see , and I ca n’t pretend not to feel what I do feel . If I could write — ah , that would be another matter . I should n’t bother you to marry me then , Katharine . ”
22912	22923	22925	22925	Katharine	129	“ But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage ? ”
22935	22983	22925	22925	Katharine	129	“ Certainly I should . Not for you only , but for all women . Why , you ’re nothing at all without it ; you ’re only half alive ; using only half your faculties ; you must feel that for yourself . That is why — ”
23007	23023	23024	23024	Katharine	129	“ I ’ve been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to - night , ”
23032	23069	23024	23024	Katharine	129	“ Mr. Denham seems to think it his mission to lecture me , though I hardly know him . By the way , William , you know him ; tell me , what is he like ? ”
23076	23089	23070	23070	William	176	“ We may lecture you till we ’re blue in the face — ”
23090	23099	23004	23004	Rodney	176	“ Yes — but what ’s he like ? ”
23100	23116	23117	23117	he	176	“ And we write sonnets to your eyebrows , you cruel practical creature . Denham ? ”
23125	23170	23117	23117	he	176	“ A good fellow , I should think . He cares , naturally , for the right sort of things , I expect . But you must n’t marry him , though . He scolded you , did he — what did he say ? ”
23171	23292	23293	23293	She	966	“ What happens with Mr. Denham is this : He comes to tea . I do all I can to put him at his ease . He merely sits and scowls at me . Then I show him our manuscripts . At this he becomes really angry , and tells me I ’ve no business to call myself a middle - class woman . So we part in a huff ; and next time we meet , which was to - night , he walks straight up to me , and says , ‘ Go to the Devil ! ’ That ’s the sort of behavior my mother complains of . I want to know , what does it mean ? ”
23313	23329	23293	23293	She	966	“ It means , I should say , that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic . ”
23341	23358	23359	23359	she	129	“ It ’s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house , ”
23362	23384	23359	23359	she	129	“ Would your mother object to my being seen with you ? No one could possibly recognize us , could they ? ”
23418	23464	23405	23405	she	129	“ You may laugh , Katharine , but I can tell you that if any of your friends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it , and I should find that very disagreeable . But why do you laugh ? ”
23465	23491	23415	23415	her	129	“ I do n’t know . Because you ’re such a queer mixture , I think . You ’re half poet and half old maid . ”
23492	23520	23415	23415	her	129	“ I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous . But I ca n’t help having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice . ”
23521	23554	23405	23405	she	129	“ Nonsense , William . You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire , but that ’s no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on the Embankment . ”
23555	23578	23415	23415	her	129	“ I ’m ten years older than you are , Katharine , and I know more of the world than you do . ”
23579	23589	23590	23590	Rodney	176	“ Very well . Leave me and go home . ”
23626	23641	23617	23617	Katharine	129	“ Do n’t call that cab for me , William . I shall walk . ”
23642	23671	23672	23672	Katharine	129	“ Nonsense , Katharine ; you ’ll do nothing of the kind . It ’s nearly twelve o’clock , and we ’ve walked too far as it is . ”
23696	23701	23702	23702	she	129	“ Now , William , ”
23705	23738	23702	23702	she	129	“ if people see me racing along the Embankment like this they WILL talk . You had far better say good - night , if you do n’t want people to talk . ”
23767	23782	23783	23783	he	176	“ Do n’t let the man see us struggling , for God ’s sake ! ”
23794	23808	23809	23809	she	129	“ There ’s more of the old maid in you than the poet , ”
23901	23919	23920	23920	he	176	“ Of all the unreasonable , inconsiderate creatures I ’ve ever known , she ’s the worst ! ”
23931	23985	23920	23920	he	176	“ Heaven forbid that I should ever make a fool of myself with her again . Why , I ’d sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than Katharine Hilbery ! She ’d leave me not a moment ’s peace — and she ’d never understand me — never , never , never ! ”
24185	24188	24189	24189	Rodney	176	“ Ha ! ”
24309	24316	24317	24317	he	131	“ You do well , Denham , ”
24321	24358	24359	24359	he	131	“ to have nothing to do with young women . I offer you my experience — if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent . Not that I have any reason at this moment , ”
24363	24403	24359	24359	he	131	“ to complain of them . It ’s a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason . Miss Datchet , I dare say , is one of the exceptions . Do you like Miss Datchet ? ”
24540	24558	24559	24559	he	131	“ Yes , I like Mary ; I do n’t see how one could help liking her , ”
24572	24624	24559	24559	he	131	“ Ah , Denham , you ’re so different from me . You never give yourself away . I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery . My instinct is to trust the person I ’m talking to . That ’s why I ’m always being taken in , I suppose . ”
24672	24680	24681	24681	he	131	“ Who ’s taken you in now ? ”
24684	24688	24681	24681	he	131	“ Katharine Hilbery ? ”
24721	24725	24726	24726	he	176	“ Katharine Hilbery , ”
24735	24771	24772	24772	he	176	“ No , Denham , I have no illusions about that young woman . I think I made that plain to her to - night . But do n’t run away with a false impression , ”
24833	24959	24960	24960	he	992	“ You must not think that I have any bitterness against her — far from it . It ’s not altogether her fault , poor girl . She lives , you know , one of those odious , self - centered lives — at least , I think them odious for a woman — feeding her wits upon everything , having control of everything , getting far too much her own way at home — spoilt , in a sense , feeling that every one is at her feet , and so not realizing how she hurts — that is , how rudely she behaves to people who have n’t all her advantages . Still , to do her justice , she ’s no fool , ”
24974	25007	25008	25008	he	992	“ She has taste . She has sense . She can understand you when you talk to her . But she ’s a woman , and there ’s an end of it , ”
25022	25034	25035	25035	Denham	131	“ And did you tell her all this to - night ? ”
25038	25081	25035	25035	Denham	131	“ Oh dear me , no . I should never think of telling Katharine the truth about herself . That would n’t do at all . One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine . “
25100	25195	25196	25196	You	0	” Denham thought to himself . But he went on walking beside Rodney , and for a time they did not speak , though Rodney hummed snatches of a tune out of an opera by Mozart . A feeling of contempt and liking combine very naturally in the mind of one to whom another has just spoken unpremeditatedly , revealing rather more of his private feelings than he intended to reveal . Denham began to wonder what sort of person Rodney was , and at the same time Rodney began to think about Denham . “
25206	25210	25211	25212	A solicitor	996	” he asked . “
25216	25217	25211	25212	A solicitor	996	” “
25245	25246	25236	25236	I	0	” “
25252	25253	25249	25250	a family	569	” “
25273	25318	25266	25266	I	0	this”—and he waved his hand towards the City of London , which wore , at this moment , the appearance of a town cut out of gray - blue cardboard , and pasted flat against the sky , which was of a deeper blue . “
25411	25577	25408	25408	they	1001	” They had reached a small court of high eighteenth - century houses , in one of which Rodney had his rooms . They climbed a very steep staircase , through whose uncurtained windows the moonlight fell , illuminating the banisters with their twisted pillars , and the piles of plates set on the window - sills , and jars half - full of milk . Rodney ’s rooms were small , but the sitting - room window looked out into a courtyard , with its flagged pavement , and its single tree , and across to the flat red - brick fronts of the opposite houses , which would not have surprised Dr. Johnson , if he had come out of his grave for a turn in the moonlight . Rodney lit his lamp , pulled his curtains , offered Denham a chair , and , flinging the manuscript of his paper on the Elizabethan use of Metaphor on to the table , exclaimed : “
25604	25666	25667	25668	The Baskerville	192	” He then busied himself very dexterously in lighting a fire , producing glasses , whisky , a cake , and cups and saucers . He put on a faded crimson dressing - gown , and a pair of red slippers , and advanced to Denham with a tumbler in one hand and a well - burnished book in the other . “
25671	25681	25667	25668	The Baskerville	192	” said Rodney , offering it to his guest . “
25692	25953	25686	25686	him	192	” When he was seen thus among his books and his valuables , amiably anxious to make his visitor comfortable , and moving about with something of the dexterity and grace of a Persian cat , Denham relaxed his critical attitude , and felt more at home with Rodney than he would have done with many men better known to him . Rodney ’s room was the room of a person who cherishes a great many personal tastes , guarding them from the rough blasts of the public with scrupulous attention . His papers and his books rose in jagged mounds on table and floor , round which he skirted with nervous care lest his dressing - gown might disarrange them ever so slightly . On a chair stood a stack of photographs of statues and pictures , which it was his habit to exhibit , one by one , for the space of a day or two . The books on his shelves were as orderly as regiments of soldiers , and the backs of them shone like so many bronze beetle - wings ; though , if you took one from its place you saw a shabbier volume behind it , since space was limited . An oval Venetian mirror stood above the fireplace , and reflected duskily in its spotted depths the faint yellow and crimson of a jarful of tulips which stood among the letters and pipes and cigarettes upon the mantelpiece . A small piano occupied a corner of the room , with the score of “
25956	25962	25686	25686	him	192	” open upon the bracket . “
25967	25981	25965	25965	Rodney	176	” said Denham , as he filled his pipe and looked about him , “
25990	26014	25965	25965	Rodney	176	” Rodney turned his head half round and smiled , with the pride of a proprietor , and then prevented himself from smiling . “
26017	26021	25965	25965	Rodney	176	” he muttered . “
26040	26041	26023	26023	I	0	” “
26084	26085	26086	26086	I	0	” “
26090	26114	26086	26086	I	0	” Denham replied . They sat silent , and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably in a blue vapor above their heads . “
26125	26129	26115	26115	I	0	” Rodney remarked . “
26147	26148	26149	26149	You	0	” “
26161	26162	26149	26149	You	0	” “
26183	26184	26178	26178	I	0	” “
26187	26188	26178	26178	I	0	” “
26194	26198	26189	26189	I	0	” he repeated . “
26237	26329	26334	26334	you	176	” The question arose in Denham ’s mind whether he should ask to see this play , as , no doubt , he was expected to do . He looked rather stealthily at Rodney , who was tapping the coal nervously with a poker , and quivering almost physically , so Denham thought , with desire to talk about this play of his , and vanity unrequited and urgent . He seemed very much at Denham ’s mercy , and Denham could not help liking him , partly on that account . “
26341	26388	26334	26334	you	176	” Denham asked , and Rodney looked immediately appeased , but , nevertheless , he sat silent for a moment , holding the poker perfectly upright in the air , regarding it with his rather prominent eyes , and opening his lips and shutting them again . “
26399	26435	26390	26390	you	176	” he asked at length , in a different tone of voice from that in which he had been speaking . And , without waiting for an answer , he went on , rather querulously : “
26450	26451	26443	26443	I	0	” “
26454	26458	26443	26443	I	0	” Denham remarked . “
26467	26522	26461	26461	I	0	” Rodney announced , putting down the poker . As he moved to fetch the play , Denham stretched a hand to the bookcase beside him , and took down the first volume which his fingers touched . It happened to be a small and very lovely edition of Sir Thomas Browne , containing the “
26526	26528	26461	26461	I	0	” the “
26531	26534	26461	26461	I	0	” and the “
26539	26678	26679	26679	I	0	” and , opening it at a passage which he knew very nearly by heart , Denham began to read and , for some time , continued to read . Rodney resumed his seat , with his manuscript on his knee , and from time to time he glanced at Denham , and then joined his finger - tips and crossed his thin legs over the fender , as if he experienced a good deal of pleasure . At length Denham shut the book , and stood , with his back to the fireplace , occasionally making an inarticulate humming sound which seemed to refer to Sir Thomas Browne . He put his hat on his head , and stood over Rodney , who still lay stretched back in his chair , with his toes within the fender . “
26687	26706	26679	26679	I	0	” Denham remarked , upon which Rodney held up his hand , containing his manuscript , without saying anything except—“If
26710	28778	26679	26679	I	0	” Denham took the manuscript and went . Two days later he was much surprised to find a thin parcel on his breakfast - plate , which , on being opened , revealed the very copy of Sir Thomas Browne which he had studied so intently in Rodney ’s rooms . From sheer laziness he returned no thanks , but he thought of Rodney from time to time with interest , disconnecting him from Katharine , and meant to go round one evening and smoke a pipe with him . It pleased Rodney thus to give away whatever his friends genuinely admired . His library was constantly being diminished . Of all the hours of an ordinary working week - day , which are the pleasantest to look forward to and to look back upon ? If a single instance is of use in framing a theory , it may be said that the minutes between nine - twenty - five and nine - thirty in the morning had a singular charm for Mary Datchet . She spent them in a very enviable frame of mind ; her contentment was almost unalloyed . High in the air as her flat was , some beams from the morning sun reached her even in November , striking straight at curtain , chair , and carpet , and painting there three bright , true spaces of green , blue , and purple , upon which the eye rested with a pleasure which gave physical warmth to the body . There were few mornings when Mary did not look up , as she bent to lace her boots , and as she followed the yellow rod from curtain to breakfast - table she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness that her life provided her with such moments of pure enjoyment . She was robbing no one of anything , and yet , to get so much pleasure from simple things , such as eating one ’s breakfast alone in a room which had nice colors in it , clean from the skirting of the boards to the corners of the ceiling , seemed to suit her so thoroughly that she used at first to hunt about for some one to apologize to , or for some flaw in the situation . She had now been six months in London , and she could find no flaw , but that , as she invariably concluded by the time her boots were laced , was solely and entirely due to the fact that she had her work . Every day , as she stood with her dispatch - box in her hand at the door of her flat , and gave one look back into the room to see that everything was straight before she left , she said to herself that she was very glad that she was going to leave it all , that to have sat there all day long , in the enjoyment of leisure , would have been intolerable . Out in the street she liked to think herself one of the workers who , at this hour , take their way in rapid single file along all the broad pavements of the city , with their heads slightly lowered , as if all their effort were to follow each other as closely as might be ; so that Mary used to figure to herself a straight rabbit - run worn by their unswerving feet upon the pavement . But she liked to pretend that she was indistinguishable from the rest , and that when a wet day drove her to the Underground or omnibus , she gave and took her share of crowd and wet with clerks and typists and commercial men , and shared with them the serious business of winding - up the world to tick for another four - and - twenty hours . Thus thinking , on the particular morning in question , she made her away across Lincoln ’s Inn Fields and up Kingsway , and so through Southampton Row until she reached her office in Russell Square . Now and then she would pause and look into the window of some bookseller or flower shop , where , at this early hour , the goods were being arranged , and empty gaps behind the plate glass revealed a state of undress . Mary felt kindly disposed towards the shopkeepers , and hoped that they would trick the midday public into purchasing , for at this hour of the morning she ranged herself entirely on the side of the shopkeepers and bank clerks , and regarded all who slept late and had money to spend as her enemy and natural prey . And directly she had crossed the road at Holborn , her thoughts all came naturally and regularly to roost upon her work , and she forgot that she was , properly speaking , an amateur worker , whose services were unpaid , and could hardly be said to wind the world up for its daily task , since the world , so far , had shown very little desire to take the boons which Mary ’s society for woman ’s suffrage had offered it . She was thinking all the way up Southampton Row of notepaper and foolscap , and how an economy in the use of paper might be effected ( without , of course , hurting Mrs. Seal ’s feelings ) , for she was certain that the great organizers always pounce , to begin with , upon trifles like these , and build up their triumphant reforms upon a basis of absolute solidity ; and , without acknowledging it for a moment , Mary Datchet was determined to be a great organizer , and had already doomed her society to reconstruction of the most radical kind . Once or twice lately , it is true , she had started , broad awake , before turning into Russell Square , and denounced herself rather sharply for being already in a groove , capable , that is , of thinking the same thoughts every morning at the same hour , so that the chestnut - colored brick of the Russell Square houses had some curious connection with her thoughts about office economy , and served also as a sign that she should get into trim for meeting Mr. Clacton , or Mrs. Seal , or whoever might be beforehand with her at the office . Having no religious belief , she was the more conscientious about her life , examining her position from time to time very seriously , and nothing annoyed her more than to find one of these bad habits nibbling away unheeded at the precious substance . What was the good , after all , of being a woman if one did n’t keep fresh , and cram one ’s life with all sorts of views and experiments ? Thus she always gave herself a little shake , as she turned the corner , and , as often as not , reached her own door whistling a snatch of a Somersetshire ballad . The suffrage office was at the top of one of the large Russell Square houses , which had once been lived in by a great city merchant and his family , and was now let out in slices to a number of societies which displayed assorted initials upon doors of ground glass , and kept , each of them , a typewriter which clicked busily all day long . The old house , with its great stone staircase , echoed hollowly to the sound of typewriters and of errand - boys from ten to six . The noise of different typewriters already at work , disseminating their views upon the protection of native races , or the value of cereals as foodstuffs , quickened Mary ’s steps , and she always ran up the last flight of steps which led to her own landing , at whatever hour she came , so as to get her typewriter to take its place in competition with the rest . She sat herself down to her letters , and very soon all these speculations were forgotten , and the two lines drew themselves between her eyebrows , as the contents of the letters , the office furniture , and the sounds of activity in the next room gradually asserted their sway upon her . By eleven o’clock the atmosphere of concentration was running so strongly in one direction that any thought of a different order could hardly have survived its birth more than a moment or so . The task which lay before her was to organize a series of entertainments , the profits of which were to benefit the society , which drooped for want of funds . It was her first attempt at organization on a large scale , and she meant to achieve something remarkable . She meant to use the cumbrous machine to pick out this , that , and the other interesting person from the muddle of the world , and to set them for a week in a pattern which must catch the eyes of Cabinet Ministers , and the eyes once caught , the old arguments were to be delivered with unexampled originality . Such was the scheme as a whole ; and in contemplation of it she would become quite flushed and excited , and have to remind herself of all the details that intervened between her and success . The door would open , and Mr. Clacton would come in to search for a certain leaflet buried beneath a pyramid of leaflets . He was a thin , sandy - haired man of about thirty - five , spoke with a Cockney accent , and had about him a frugal look , as if nature had not dealt generously with him in any way , which , naturally , prevented him from dealing generously with other people . When he had found his leaflet , and offered a few jocular hints upon keeping papers in order , the typewriting would stop abruptly , and Mrs. Seal would burst into the room with a letter which needed explanation in her hand . This was a more serious interruption than the other , because she never knew exactly what she wanted , and half a dozen requests would bolt from her , no one of which was clearly stated . Dressed in plum - colored velveteen , with short , gray hair , and a face that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic enthusiasm , she was always in a hurry , and always in some disorder . She wore two crucifixes , which got themselves entangled in a heavy gold chain upon her breast , and seemed to Mary expressive of her mental ambiguity . Only her vast enthusiasm and her worship of Miss Markham , one of the pioneers of the society , kept her in her place , for which she had no sound qualification . So the morning wore on , and the pile of letters grew , and Mary felt , at last , that she was the center ganglion of a very fine network of nerves which fell over England , and one of these days , when she touched the heart of the system , would begin feeling and rushing together and emitting their splendid blaze of revolutionary fireworks — for some such metaphor represents what she felt about her work , when her brain had been heated by three hours of application . Shortly before one o’clock Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal desisted from their labors , and the old joke about luncheon , which came out regularly at this hour , was repeated with scarcely any variation of words . Mr. Clacton patronized a vegetarian restaurant ; Mrs. Seal brought sandwiches , which she ate beneath the plane - trees in Russell Square ; while Mary generally went to a gaudy establishment , upholstered in red plush , near by , where , much to the vegetarian ’s disapproval , you could buy steak , two inches thick , or a roast section of fowl , swimming in a pewter dish . “
28791	28802	26679	26679	I	0	” Mrs. Seal asserted , looking out into the Square . “
28813	28817	28811	28811	Sally	200	” said Mary . “
28832	28837	28829	28830	Miss Datchet	175	” Mr. Clacton remarked . “
28861	28862	28849	28849	I	0	” “
28872	29023	29024	29024	Eleanor	201	” Mary asked , good - humoredly pointing to the yellow - covered volume beneath Mr. Clacton ’s arm , for he invariably read some new French author at lunch - time , or squeezed in a visit to a picture gallery , balancing his social work with an ardent culture of which he was secretly proud , as Mary had very soon divined . So they parted and Mary walked away , wondering if they guessed that she really wanted to get away from them , and supposing that they had not quite reached that degree of subtlety . She bought herself an evening paper , which she read as she ate , looking over the top of it again and again at the queer people who were buying cakes or imparting their secrets , until some young woman whom she knew came in , and she called out , “
29032	29240	29024	29024	Eleanor	201	” and they finished their lunch together , parting on the strip of pavement among the different lines of traffic with a pleasant feeling that they were stepping once more into their separate places in the great and eternally moving pattern of human life . But , instead of going straight back to the office to - day , Mary turned into the British Museum , and strolled down the gallery with the shapes of stone until she found an empty seat directly beneath the gaze of the Elgin marbles . She looked at them , and seemed , as usual , borne up on some wave of exaltation and emotion , by which her life at once became solemn and beautiful — an impression which was due as much , perhaps , to the solitude and chill and silence of the gallery as to the actual beauty of the statues . One must suppose , at least , that her emotions were not purely esthetic , because , after she had gazed at the Ulysses for a minute or two , she began to think about Ralph Denham . So secure did she feel with these silent shapes that she almost yielded to an impulse to say “
29247	29355	29024	29024	Eleanor	201	” aloud . The presence of this immense and enduring beauty made her almost alarmingly conscious of her desire , and at the same time proud of a feeling which did not display anything like the same proportions when she was going about her daily work . She repressed her impulse to speak aloud , and rose and wandered about rather aimlessly among the statues until she found herself in another gallery devoted to engraved obelisks and winged Assyrian bulls , and her emotion took another turn . She began to picture herself traveling with Ralph in a land where these monsters were couchant in the sand . “
29358	29378	29024	29024	Eleanor	201	” she thought to herself , as she gazed fixedly at some information printed behind a piece of glass , “
29405	29433	29392	29392	you	1006	” And she conjured up a scene of herself on a camel ’s back , in the desert , while Ralph commanded a whole tribe of natives . “
29441	29453	29392	29392	you	1006	” she went on , moving on to the next statue . “
29463	29501	29454	29454	You	1006	” A glow spread over her spirit , and filled her eyes with brightness . Nevertheless , before she left the Museum she was very far from saying , even in the privacy of her own mind , “
29509	29728	29502	29502	I	0	” and that sentence might very well never have framed itself . She was , indeed , rather annoyed with herself for having allowed such an ill - considered breach of her reserve , weakening her powers of resistance , she felt , should this impulse return again . For , as she walked along the street to her office , the force of all her customary objections to being in love with any one overcame her . She did not want to marry at all . It seemed to her that there was something amateurish in bringing love into touch with a perfectly straightforward friendship , such as hers was with Ralph , which , for two years now , had based itself upon common interests in impersonal topics , such as the housing of the poor , or the taxation of land values . But the afternoon spirit differed intrinsically from the morning spirit . Mary found herself watching the flight of a bird , or making drawings of the branches of the plane - trees upon her blotting - paper . People came in to see Mr. Clacton on business , and a seductive smell of cigarette smoke issued from his room . Mrs. Seal wandered about with newspaper cuttings , which seemed to her either “
29731	29733	29392	29392	you	1006	” or “
29740	30006	29392	29392	you	1006	” She used to paste these into books , or send them to her friends , having first drawn a broad bar in blue pencil down the margin , a proceeding which signified equally and indistinguishably the depths of her reprobation or the heights of her approval . About four o’clock on that same afternoon Katharine Hilbery was walking up Kingsway . The question of tea presented itself . The street lamps were being lit already , and as she stood still for a moment beneath one of them , she tried to think of some neighboring drawing - room where there would be firelight and talk congenial to her mood . That mood , owing to the spinning traffic and the evening veil of unreality , was ill - adapted to her home surroundings . Perhaps , on the whole , a shop was the best place in which to preserve this queer sense of heightened existence . At the same time she wished to talk . Remembering Mary Datchet and her repeated invitations , she crossed the road , turned into Russell Square , and peered about , seeking for numbers with a sense of adventure that was out of all proportion to the deed itself . She found herself in a dimly lighted hall , unguarded by a porter , and pushed open the first swing door . But the office - boy had never heard of Miss Datchet . Did she belong to the S.R.F.R. ? Katharine shook her head with a smile of dismay . A voice from within shouted , “
30013	30108	30109	30109	You	1009	” Katharine mounted past innumerable glass doors , with initials on them , and became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom of her venture . At the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect herself . She heard the typewriter and formal professional voices inside , not belonging , she thought , to any one she had ever spoken to . She touched the bell , and the door was opened almost immediately by Mary herself . Her face had to change its expression entirely when she saw Katharine . “
30111	30115	30109	30109	You	1009	” she exclaimed . “
30123	30134	30118	30118	you	1009	” Still holding the door open , she called back , “
30169	30173	30174	30174	You	1009	” she added . “
30182	30293	30174	30174	You	1009	” The light of relief shone in Mary ’s eyes . The boredom of the afternoon was dissipated at once , and she was glad that Katharine had found them in a momentary press of activity , owing to the failure of the printer to send back certain proofs . The unshaded electric light shining upon the table covered with papers dazed Katharine for a moment . After the confusion of her twilight walk , and her random thoughts , life in this small room appeared extremely concentrated and bright . She turned instinctively to look out of the window , which was uncurtained , but Mary immediately recalled her . “
30305	30493	30299	30299	you	1009	” she said , and Katharine wondered , as she stood there , feeling , for the moment , entirely detached and unabsorbed , why she had come . She looked , indeed , to Mary ’s eyes strangely out of place in the office . Her figure in the long cloak , which took deep folds , and her face , which was composed into a mask of sensitive apprehension , disturbed Mary for a moment with a sense of the presence of some one who was of another world , and , therefore , subversive of her world . She became immediately anxious that Katharine should be impressed by the importance of her world , and hoped that neither Mrs. Seal nor Mr. Clacton would appear until the impression of importance had been received . But in this she was disappointed . Mrs. Seal burst into the room holding a kettle in her hand , which she set upon the stove , and then , with inefficient haste , she set light to the gas , which flared up , exploded , and went out . “
30502	30506	30299	30299	you	1009	” she muttered . “
30522	30553	30507	30508	Kit Markham	202	” Mary had to go to her help , and together they spread the table , and apologized for the disparity between the cups and the plainness of the food . “
30570	30622	30563	30563	we	1013	” said Mary , upon which Mrs. Seal looked at Katharine for the first time , suspiciously , because she was a person who needed cake . Here Mr. Clacton opened the door , and came in , holding a typewritten letter in his hand , which he was reading aloud . “
30627	30631	30563	30563	we	1013	” he said . “
30637	30658	30563	30563	we	1013	” Mrs. Seal exclaimed enthusiastically , thumping the teapot which she held upon the table , in token of applause . “
30673	30702	30563	30563	we	1013	” said Mr. Clacton , and then Mary introduced him to Miss Hilbery , and he asked her , in a very formal manner , if she were interested “
30707	30708	30563	30563	we	1013	” “
30716	30745	30563	30563	we	1013	” said Mrs. Seal , putting both her elbows on the table , and propping her chin on her hands , as Mary began to pour out tea . “
30815	30822	30811	30813	the Prime Minister	1019	” But Mary cut her short . “
30833	30838	30839	30839	We	1015	” she said firmly . “
30859	30881	30882	30882	I	0	” she explained , seeking to draw Katharine into the community . She had given up all hope of impressing her . “
30890	30895	30886	30886	I	0	” Mrs. Seal apologized . “
30905	30913	30902	30903	an enthusiast	1021	” she said , turning to Katharine . “
30987	30991	30978	30978	I	0	” she added . “
31006	31007	31002	31002	women	557	” “
31018	31030	31016	31016	Sally	200	” said Mary , bringing her fist down on the table . “
31044	31064	31041	31041	their	557	” Mrs. Seal looked for a moment as though she could hardly believe her ears , and made a deprecating “
31070	31109	31110	31110	She	1032	” in her throat , looking alternately at Katharine and Mary , and shaking her head as she did so . Then she remarked , rather confidentially to Katharine , with a little nod in Mary ’s direction : “
31141	31198	31122	31122	She	1032	” she sighed , and stopped short . Mr. Clacton hastily reverted to the joke about luncheon , and explained how Mrs. Seal fed on a bag of biscuits under the trees , whatever the weather might be , rather , Katharine thought , as though Mrs. Seal were a pet dog who had convenient tricks . “
31210	31231	31201	31201	I	0	” said Mrs. Seal , with the self - conscious guilt of a child owning some fault to its elders . “
31263	31271	31252	31252	I	0	” she proceeded , wrinkling her forehead . “
31301	31316	31321	31323	a tyrant one	1038	” She looked fiercely at Katharine , giving her short locks a little shake . “
31388	31389	31390	31393	A most excellent object	1043	” “
31395	31404	31390	31393	A most excellent object	1043	” said Mr. Clacton in his professional manner . “
31462	31595	31459	31460	Miss Hilbery	129	” he added , screwing his mouth into a queer little smile , as if to show that the question had its frivolous side . Katharine smiled , too . Her unlikeness to the rest of them had , by this time , penetrated to Mr. Clacton , who was not naturally observant , and he was wondering who she was ; this same unlikeness had subtly stimulated Mrs. Seal to try and make a convert of her . Mary , too , looked at her almost as if she begged her to make things easy . For Katharine had shown no disposition to make things easy . She had scarcely spoken , and her silence , though grave and even thoughtful , seemed to Mary the silence of one who criticizes . “
31611	31615	31605	31605	I	0	” she said . “
31637	31638	31627	31627	you	1047	” “
31651	31658	31641	31641	you	1047	” Mary interposed , rather sharply . “
31678	31772	31773	31773	You	1054	” Mr. Clacton cleared his throat and looked at each of the young ladies in turn . He was a good deal struck by the appearance and manner of Miss Hilbery , which seemed to him to place her among those cultivated and luxurious people of whom he used to dream . Mary , on the other hand , was more of his own sort , and a little too much inclined to order him about . He picked up crumbs of dry biscuit and put them into his mouth with incredible rapidity . “
31783	31788	31773	31773	You	1054	” said Mrs. Seal . “
31798	31838	31794	31794	I	0	” said Katharine , with such ready candor that Mrs. Seal was nonplussed , and stared at her with a puzzled expression , as if she could not classify her among the varieties of human beings known to her . “
31842	31846	31847	31848	Mrs. Seal	196	” she began . “
31856	31864	31847	31848	Mrs. Seal	196	” said Mr. Clacton , almost apologetically . “
31887	31889	31899	31900	a Suffragist	1057	“ Punch ”
31912	31915	31916	31917	Miss Datchet	175	“ Punch , ”
31919	31925	31916	31917	Miss Datchet	175	” Mary laughed , and said “
31928	31983	31916	31917	Miss Datchet	175	” Mr. Clacton then told them the substance of the joke , which , however , depended a good deal for its success upon the expression which the artist had put into the people ’s faces . Mrs. Seal sat all the time perfectly grave . Directly he had done speaking she burst out : “
32008	32009	32010	32010	I	0	” “
32023	32027	32013	32013	I	0	” Katharine protested . “
32039	32085	32032	32032	you	0	” Mrs. Seal demanded . Katharine stirred her spoon round and round , stared into the swirl of the tea , and remained silent . Mr. Clacton , meanwhile , framed a question which , after a moment ’s hesitation , he put to Katharine . “
32112	32113	32108	32110	a Mr. Hilbery	134	” “
32123	32145	32118	32119	the poet	661	” said Katharine , with a little sigh , after a pause ; and for a moment they were all silent . “
32151	32185	32146	32149	The poet ’s granddaughter	1067	” Mrs. Seal repeated , half to herself , with a shake of her head , as if that explained what was otherwise inexplicable . The light kindled in Mr. Clacton ’s eye . “
32196	32200	32201	32201	I	0	” he said . “
32250	32277	32245	32245	him	2954	” A sharp rap at the door made Katharine ’s answer inaudible . Mrs. Seal looked up with renewed hope in her eyes , and exclaiming : “
32283	32290	32245	32245	him	2954	” ran to open the door . “
32299	32349	32296	32297	Mr. Denham	131	” she cried , without any attempt to conceal her disappointment . Ralph , Katharine supposed , was a frequent visitor , for the only person he thought it necessary to greet was herself , and Mary at once explained the strange fact of her being there by saying : “
32361	32372	32350	32350	Katharine	129	” Ralph felt himself stiffen uncomfortably , as he said : “
32389	32390	32395	32395	she	175	” “
32397	32459	32395	32395	she	175	” said Katharine , looking from one to the other . At these remarks Mrs. Seal began to exhibit signs of discomposure , which displayed themselves by a tossing movement of her head , and , as Ralph took a letter from his pocket , and placed his finger upon a certain sentence , she forestalled him by exclaiming in confusion : “
32536	32537	32532	32532	I	0	” “
32546	32552	32540	32540	Sally	200	” said Mary , laughing . “
32572	32573	32558	32558	they	719	” “
32584	32624	32625	32627	a mere man	1080	” said Mr. Clacton in a jocular manner , indeed , but like most insignificant men he was very quick to resent being found fault with by a woman , in argument with whom he was fond of calling himself “
32629	32652	32625	32627	a mere man	1080	” He wished , however , to enter into a literary conservation with Miss Hilbery , and thus let the matter drop . “
32664	32668	32625	32627	a mere man	1080	” he said , “
32725	32782	32723	32723	Alardyce	139	” Here the telephone bell rang , and he had to absent himself with a smile and a bow which signified that , although literature is delightful , it is not work . Mrs. Seal rose at the same time , but remained hovering over the table , delivering herself of a tirade against party government . “
32893	32978	32876	32876	I	0	” but reflecting that the glories of the future depended in part upon the activity of her typewriter , she bobbed her head , and hurried back to the seclusion of her little room , from which immediately issued sounds of enthusiastic , but obviously erratic , composition . Mary made it clear at once , by starting a fresh topic of general interest , that though she saw the humor of her colleague , she did not intend to have her laughed at . “
32989	33002	32876	32876	I	0	” she observed reflectively , pouring out a second cup of tea , “
33045	33070	33037	33037	I	0	” she went on , looking at Ralph with a little smile , as though he knew what happened when she lost her temper . “
33088	33093	33085	33085	you	0	” she asked Katharine . “
33102	33210	33211	33211	I	0	” Katharine remarked , looking about the room to see where she had put down her umbrella and her parcel , for there was an intimacy in the way in which Mary and Ralph addressed each other which made her wish to leave them . Mary , on the other hand , was anxious , superficially at least , that Katharine should stay and so fortify her in her determination not to be in love with Ralph . Ralph , while lifting his cup from his lips to the table , had made up his mind that if Miss Hilbery left , he would go with her . “
33235	34136	33231	33231	you	154	” Mary continued . Katharine laughed , with more gayety , as it seemed to Mary , than she could properly account for . What was she laughing at ? At them , presumably . Katharine had risen , and was glancing hither and thither , at the presses and the cupboards , and all the machinery of the office , as if she included them all in her rather malicious amusement , which caused Mary to keep her eyes on her straightly and rather fiercely , as if she were a gay - plumed , mischievous bird , who might light on the topmost bough and pick off the ruddiest cherry , without any warning . Two women less like each other could scarcely be imagined , Ralph thought , looking from one to the other . Next moment , he too , rose , and nodding to Mary , as Katharine said good - bye , opened the door for her , and followed her out . Mary sat still and made no attempt to prevent them from going . For a second or two after the door had shut on them her eyes rested on the door with a straightforward fierceness in which , for a moment , a certain degree of bewilderment seemed to enter ; but , after a brief hesitation , she put down her cup and proceeded to clear away the tea - things . The impulse which had driven Ralph to take this action was the result of a very swift little piece of reasoning , and thus , perhaps , was not quite so much of an impulse as it seemed . It passed through his mind that if he missed this chance of talking to Katharine , he would have to face an enraged ghost , when he was alone in his room again , demanding an explanation of his cowardly indecision . It was better , on the whole , to risk present discomfiture than to waste an evening bandying excuses and constructing impossible scenes with this uncompromising section of himself . For ever since he had visited the Hilberys he had been much at the mercy of a phantom Katharine , who came to him when he sat alone , and answered him as he would have her answer , and was always beside him to crown those varying triumphs which were transacted almost every night , in imaginary scenes , as he walked through the lamplit streets home from the office . To walk with Katharine in the flesh would either feed that phantom with fresh food , which , as all who nourish dreams are aware , is a process that becomes necessary from time to time , or refine it to such a degree of thinness that it was scarcely serviceable any longer ; and that , too , is sometimes a welcome change to a dreamer . And all the time Ralph was well aware that the bulk of Katharine was not represented in his dreams at all , so that when he met her he was bewildered by the fact that she had nothing to do with his dream of her . When , on reaching the street , Katharine found that Mr. Denham proceeded to keep pace by her side , she was surprised and , perhaps , a little annoyed . She , too , had her margin of imagination , and to - night her activity in this obscure region of the mind required solitude . If she had had her way , she would have walked very fast down the Tottenham Court Road , and then sprung into a cab and raced swiftly home . The view she had had of the inside of an office was of the nature of a dream to her . Shut off up there , she compared Mrs. Seal , and Mary Datchet , and Mr. Clacton to enchanted people in a bewitched tower , with the spiders ’ webs looping across the corners of the room , and all the tools of the necromancer ’s craft at hand ; for so aloof and unreal and apart from the normal world did they seem to her , in the house of innumerable typewriters , murmuring their incantations and concocting their drugs , and flinging their frail spiders ’ webs over the torrent of life which rushed down the streets outside . She may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration in this fancy of hers , for she certainly did not wish to share it with Ralph . To him , she supposed , Mary Datchet , composing leaflets for Cabinet Ministers among her typewriters , represented all that was interesting and genuine ; and , accordingly , she shut them both out from all share in the crowded street , with its pendant necklace of lamps , its lighted windows , and its throng of men and women , which exhilarated her to such an extent that she very nearly forgot her companion . She walked very fast , and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was to produce a queer dizziness both in her head and in Ralph ’s , which set their bodies far apart . But she did her duty by her companion almost unconsciously . “
34156	34157	34147	34147	She	175	” “
34176	34177	34169	34169	she	175	” “
34190	34191	34169	34169	she	175	” “
34203	34204	34193	34193	she	175	” “
34216	34254	34193	34193	she	175	” So they walked on down the Tottenham Court Road , parting and coming together again , and Ralph felt much as though he were addressing the summit of a poplar in a high gale of wind . “
34263	34284	34256	34256	we	1093	” he suggested . Katharine acquiesced , and they climbed up , and found themselves alone on top of it . “
34292	34312	34289	34289	you	0	” Katharine asked , waking a little from the trance into which movement among moving things had thrown her . “
34320	34446	34313	34313	I	0	” Ralph replied , inventing a destination on the spur of the moment . He felt the change come over her as they sat down and the omnibus began to move forward . He imagined her contemplating the avenue in front of them with those honest sad eyes which seemed to set him at such a distance from them . But the breeze was blowing in their faces ; it lifted her hat for a second , and she drew out a pin and stuck it in again,—a little action which seemed , for some reason , to make her rather more fallible . Ah , if only her hat would blow off , and leave her altogether disheveled , accepting it from his hands ! “
34452	34460	34466	34466	I	0	” she observed , raising her hand . “
34478	34479	34466	34466	I	0	” “
34486	34490	34480	34480	I	0	” he replied . “
34503	34504	34491	34491	I	0	” “
34511	34515	34491	34491	I	0	” she asked . “
34530	34534	34526	34526	Dante	207	” She laughed . “
34557	34587	34552	34552	you	0	” Instead of answering her , he wondered whether he should tell her something that was quite true about himself ; and as he wondered , he told her . “
34622	34623	34617	34617	I	0	” “
34629	34633	34627	34627	I	0	” Katharine exclaimed . “
34639	34643	34646	34646	you	0	” she added , “
34650	34651	34646	34646	you	0	” “
34663	34667	34668	34668	You	1099	” Ralph rejoined . “
34686	34852	34668	34668	You	1099	” She said nothing for a moment , but rested one hand , which was bare of glove , upon the rail in front of her , meditating upon a variety of things , of which one was that this strange young man pronounced Dante as she was used to hearing it pronounced , and another , that he had , most unexpectedly , a feeling about life that was familiar to her . Perhaps , then , he was the sort of person she might take an interest in , if she came to know him better , and as she had placed him among those whom she would never want to know better , this was enough to make her silent . She hastily recalled her first view of him , in the little room where the relics were kept , and ran a bar through half her impressions , as one cancels a badly written sentence , having found the right one . “
34873	34881	34867	34867	one	422	” she said , in some confusion . “
34894	34928	34929	34929	I	0	” she began impulsively , and stopped herself . Here the conductor came round , and interrupted them . Ralph waited for her to resume her sentence , but she said no more . “
34938	34942	34929	34929	I	0	” he remarked . “
34955	34956	34951	34951	I	0	” “
34962	34966	34951	34951	I	0	” Katharine replied . “
34981	35098	35100	35102	little Augustus Pelham	208	” Ralph began , in order to keep her from rising , as she threatened to do . But she got up in spite of him , and said good - bye with her usual air of decision , and left him with a quickness which Ralph connected now with all her movements . He looked down and saw her standing on the pavement edge , an alert , commanding figure , which waited its season to cross , and then walked boldly and swiftly to the other side . That gesture and action would be added to the picture he had of her , but at present the real woman completely routed the phantom one . “
35162	35163	35156	35156	his	208	” “
35181	35558	35156	35156	his	208	” said Mr. Hilbery . The elderly couple were waiting for the dinner - bell to ring and for their daughter to come into the room . Their arm - chairs were drawn up on either side of the fire , and each sat in the same slightly crouched position , looking into the coals , with the expressions of people who have had their share of experiences and wait , rather passively , for something to happen . Mr. Hilbery now gave all his attention to a piece of coal which had fallen out of the grate , and to selecting a favorable position for it among the lumps that were burning already . Mrs. Hilbery watched him in silence , and the smile changed on her lips as if her mind still played with the events of the afternoon . When Mr. Hilbery had accomplished his task , he resumed his crouching position again , and began to toy with the little green stone attached to his watch - chain . His deep , oval - shaped eyes were fixed upon the flames , but behind the superficial glaze seemed to brood an observant and whimsical spirit , which kept the brown of the eye still unusually vivid . But a look of indolence , the result of skepticism or of a taste too fastidious to be satisfied by the prizes and conclusions so easily within his grasp , lent him an expression almost of melancholy . After sitting thus for a time , he seemed to reach some point in his thinking which demonstrated its futility , upon which he sighed and stretched his hand for a book lying on the table by his side . Directly the door opened he closed the book , and the eyes of father and mother both rested on Katharine as she came towards them . The sight seemed at once to give them a motive which they had not had before . To them she appeared , as she walked towards them in her light evening dress , extremely young , and the sight of her refreshed them , were it only because her youth and ignorance made their knowledge of the world of some value . “
35577	35587	35588	35588	I	0	” said Mr. Hilbery , putting down his spectacles . “
35602	35614	35592	35592	her	129	” said Mrs. Hilbery , looking with pride at her daughter . “
35632	35636	35630	35630	Katharine	129	” she continued . “
35645	35884	35642	35642	I	0	” Here dinner was announced , and Mr. Hilbery formally led his wife downstairs on his arm . They were all dressed for dinner , and , indeed , the prettiness of the dinner - table merited that compliment . There was no cloth upon the table , and the china made regular circles of deep blue upon the shining brown wood . In the middle there was a bowl of tawny red and yellow chrysanthemums , and one of pure white , so fresh that the narrow petals were curved backwards into a firm white ball . From the surrounding walls the heads of three famous Victorian writers surveyed this entertainment , and slips of paper pasted beneath them testified in the great man ’s own handwriting that he was yours sincerely or affectionately or for ever . The father and daughter would have been quite content , apparently , to eat their dinner in silence , or with a few cryptic remarks expressed in a shorthand which could not be understood by the servants . But silence depressed Mrs. Hilbery , and far from minding the presence of maids , she would often address herself to them , and was never altogether unconscious of their approval or disapproval of her remarks . In the first place she called them to witness that the room was darker than usual , and had all the lights turned on . “
35890	35894	35642	35642	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
35951	35952	35944	35944	he	1107	” “
35957	35963	35944	35944	he	1107	” Katharine asked her father . “
35981	35986	35975	35976	Augustus Pelham	208	” said Mrs. Hilbery . “
35996	36000	36001	36002	Poor Augustus	209	” said Katharine . “
36004	36009	36001	36002	Poor Augustus	209	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed . “
36030	36031	36022	36022	he	209	” “
36047	36048	36041	36045	Any one connected with himself	1111	” “
36085	36089	36069	36069	Trevor	210	” Mr. Hilbery suggested “
36092	36093	36069	36069	Trevor	210	” “
36192	36193	36181	36181	he	209	” “
36197	36234	36194	36194	I	0	” Katharine started , with great impetuosity , and checked herself . Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly , and then she remembered that her father was there , listening with attention . “
36241	36283	36284	36284	I	0	” he asked , as she paused . He often surprised her , thus , into telling him what she had not meant to tell him ; and then they argued , while Mrs. Hilbery went on with her own thoughts . “
36306	36307	36298	36298	they	1116	” “
36322	36323	36320	36320	you	0	” “
36335	36358	36333	36333	Katharine	129	” Mrs. Hilbery demanded , and Katharine was committed to giving her parents an account of her visit to the Suffrage office . “
36412	36413	36404	36405	Mary Datchet	175	” “
36426	36431	36432	36432	I	0	” said Mr. Hilbery . “
36451	36456	36447	36447	Mamma	212	” Mrs. Hilbery mused , “
36491	36492	36489	36489	them	1128	” “
36506	36510	36496	36496	they	1128	” Katharine insisted . “
36535	36570	36518	36518	them	1128	” Mrs. Hilbery persisted , her notion of office life being derived from some chance view of a scene behind the counter at her bank , as she slipped the sovereigns into her purse . “
36592	36597	36582	36582	Katharine	129	” Mr. Hilbery remarked . “
36601	36607	36608	36608	I	0	” said Katharine very decidedly , “
36617	36618	36608	36608	I	0	” “
36623	36633	36608	36608	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery continued , agreeing with his daughter , “
36700	37220	36695	36695	I	0	” and he proceeded to tell them , as he peeled his apple , how he committed himself once , in his youthful days , to make a speech at a political meeting , and went there ablaze with enthusiasm for the ideals of his own side ; but while his leaders spoke , he became gradually converted to the other way of thinking , if thinking it could be called , and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a fool of himself — an experience which had sickened him of public meetings . Katharine listened and felt as she generally did when her father , and to some extent her mother , described their feelings , that she quite understood and agreed with them , but , at the same time , saw something which they did not see , and always felt some disappointment when they fell short of her vision , as they always did . The plates succeeded each other swiftly and noiselessly in front of her , and the table was decked for dessert , and as the talk murmured on in familiar grooves , she sat there , rather like a judge , listening to her parents , who did , indeed , feel it very pleasant when they made her laugh . Daily life in a house where there are young and old is full of curious little ceremonies and pieties , which are discharged quite punctually , though the meaning of them is obscure , and a mystery has come to brood over them which lends even a superstitious charm to their performance . Such was the nightly ceremony of the cigar and the glass of port , which were placed on the right hand and on the left hand of Mr. Hilbery , and simultaneously Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine left the room . All the years they had lived together they had never seen Mr. Hilbery smoke his cigar or drink his port , and they would have felt it unseemly if , by chance , they had surprised him as he sat there . These short , but clearly marked , periods of separation between the sexes were always used for an intimate postscript to what had been said at dinner , the sense of being women together coming out most strongly when the male sex was , as if by some religious rite , secluded from the female . Katharine knew by heart the sort of mood that possessed her as she walked upstairs to the drawing - room , her mother ’s arm in hers ; and she could anticipate the pleasure with which , when she had turned on the lights , they both regarded the drawing - room , fresh swept and set in order for the last section of the day , with the red parrots swinging on the chintz curtains , and the arm - chairs warming in the blaze . Mrs. Hilbery stood over the fire , with one foot on the fender , and her skirts slightly raised . “
37225	37229	37223	37223	Katharine	129	” she exclaimed , “
37313	37735	37282	37282	Papa	213	” As she spoke an expression of regret , which must have come frequently to cause the lines which now grew deep round the lips and eyes , settled on her face . The poet ’s marriage had not been a happy one . He had left his wife , and after some years of a rather reckless existence , she had died , before her time . This disaster had led to great irregularities of education , and , indeed , Mrs. Hilbery might be said to have escaped education altogether . But she had been her father ’s companion at the season when he wrote the finest of his poems . She had sat on his knee in taverns and other haunts of drunken poets , and it was for her sake , so people said , that he had cured himself of his dissipation , and become the irreproachable literary character that the world knows , whose inspiration had deserted him . As Mrs. Hilbery grew old she thought more and more of the past , and this ancient disaster seemed at times almost to prey upon her mind , as if she could not pass out of life herself without laying the ghost of her parent ’s sorrow to rest . Katharine wished to comfort her mother , but it was difficult to do this satisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much of a legend . The house in Russell Square , for example , with its noble rooms , and the magnolia - tree in the garden , and the sweet - voiced piano , and the sound of feet coming down the corridors , and other properties of size and romance — had they any existence ? Yet why should Mrs. Alardyce live all alone in this gigantic mansion , and , if she did not live alone , with whom did she live ? For its own sake , Katharine rather liked this tragic story , and would have been glad to hear the details of it , and to have been able to discuss them frankly . But this it became less and less possible to do , for though Mrs. Hilbery was constantly reverting to the story , it was always in this tentative and restless fashion , as though by a touch here and there she could set things straight which had been crooked these sixty years . Perhaps , indeed , she no longer knew what the truth was . “
37742	37746	37282	37282	Papa	213	” she concluded , “
37834	37853	37817	37817	Katharine	129	” The tears stood in Mrs. Hilbery ’s eyes . While comforting her , Katharine thought to herself , “
37890	37915	37918	37918	Katharine	129	” for all the evening she had been comparing her home and her father and mother with the Suffrage office and the people there . “
37920	37934	37918	37918	Katharine	129	” Mrs. Hilbery continued , with one of her sudden changes of mood , “
37996	38022	37974	37975	Katharine Rodney	129	” The alteration of her name annoyed Katharine , and she observed , rather sharply , that she did n’t want to marry any one . “
38037	38042	38032	38033	one husband	1149	” Mrs. Hilbery reflected . “
38074	38273	38071	38072	dear William	176	” But here Mr. Hilbery came in , and the more solid part of the evening began . This consisted in the reading aloud by Katharine from some prose work or other , while her mother knitted scarves intermittently on a little circular frame , and her father read the newspaper , not so attentively but that he could comment humorously now and again upon the fortunes of the hero and the heroine . The Hilberys subscribed to a library , which delivered books on Tuesdays and Fridays , and Katharine did her best to interest her parents in the works of living and highly respectable authors ; but Mrs. Hilbery was perturbed by the very look of the light , gold - wreathed volumes , and would make little faces as if she tasted something bitter as the reading went on ; while Mr. Hilbery would treat the moderns with a curious elaborate banter such as one might apply to the antics of a promising child . So this evening , after five pages or so of one of these masters , Mrs. Hilbery protested that it was all too clever and cheap and nasty for words . “
38283	38715	38276	38276	Katharine	129	” Katharine had to go to the bookcase and choose a portly volume in sleek , yellow calf , which had directly a sedative effect upon both her parents . But the delivery of the evening post broke in upon the periods of Henry Fielding , and Katharine found that her letters needed all her attention . She took her letters up to her room with her , having persuaded her mother to go to bed directly Mr. Hilbery left them , for so long as she sat in the same room as her mother , Mrs. Hilbery might , at any moment , ask for a sight of the post . A very hasty glance through many sheets had shown Katharine that , by some coincidence , her attention had to be directed to many different anxieties simultaneously . In the first place , Rodney had written a very full account of his state of mind , which was illustrated by a sonnet , and he demanded a reconsideration of their position , which agitated Katharine more than she liked . Then there were two letters which had to be laid side by side and compared before she could make out the truth of their story , and even when she knew the facts she could not decide what to make of them ; and finally she had to reflect upon a great many pages from a cousin who found himself in financial difficulties , which forced him to the uncongenial occupation of teaching the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin . But the two letters which each told the same story differently were the chief source of her perplexity . She was really rather shocked to find it definitely established that her own second cousin , Cyril Alardyce , had lived for the last four years with a woman who was not his wife , who had borne him two children , and was now about to bear him another . This state of things had been discovered by Mrs. Milvain , her aunt Celia , a zealous inquirer into such matters , whose letter was also under consideration . Cyril , she said , must be made to marry the woman at once ; and Cyril , rightly or wrongly , was indignant with such interference with his affairs , and would not own that he had any cause to be ashamed of himself . Had he any cause to be ashamed of himself , Katharine wondered ; and she turned to her aunt again . “
38718	38729	38276	38276	Katharine	129	” she wrote , in her profuse , emphatic statement , “
38783	38784	38759	38763	the woman who deluded him	1157	” “
38793	38849	38787	38788	Ralph Denham	154	” thought Katharine , beginning to pace up and down her bedroom . She twitched aside the curtains , so that , on turning , she was faced by darkness , and looking out , could just distinguish the branches of a plane - tree and the yellow lights of some one else ’s windows . “
38859	39798	38852	38853	Mary Datchet	175	” she reflected , pausing by the window , which , as the night was warm , she raised , in order to feel the air upon her face , and to lose herself in the nothingness of night . But with the air the distant humming sound of far - off crowded thoroughfares was admitted to the room . The incessant and tumultuous hum of the distant traffic seemed , as she stood there , to represent the thick texture of her life , for her life was so hemmed in with the progress of other lives that the sound of its own advance was inaudible . People like Ralph and Mary , she thought , had it all their own way , and an empty space before them , and , as she envied them , she cast her mind out to imagine an empty land where all this petty intercourse of men and women , this life made up of the dense crossings and entanglements of men and women , had no existence whatever . Even now , alone , at night , looking out into the shapeless mass of London , she was forced to remember that there was one point and here another with which she had some connection . William Rodney , at this very moment , was seated in a minute speck of light somewhere to the east of her , and his mind was occupied , not with his book , but with her . She wished that no one in the whole world would think of her . However , there was no way of escaping from one ’s fellow - beings , she concluded , and shut the window with a sigh , and returned once more to her letters . She could not doubt but that William ’s letter was the most genuine she had yet received from him . He had come to the conclusion that he could not live without her , he wrote . He believed that he knew her , and could give her happiness , and that their marriage would be unlike other marriages . Nor was the sonnet , in spite of its accomplishment , lacking in passion , and Katharine , as she read the pages through again , could see in what direction her feelings ought to flow , supposing they revealed themselves . She would come to feel a humorous sort of tenderness for him , a zealous care for his susceptibilities , and , after all , she considered , thinking of her father and mother , what is love ? Naturally , with her face , position , and background , she had experience of young men who wished to marry her , and made protestations of love , but , perhaps because she did not return the feeling , it remained something of a pageant to her . Not having experience of it herself , her mind had unconsciously occupied itself for some years in dressing up an image of love , and the marriage that was the outcome of love , and the man who inspired love , which naturally dwarfed any examples that came her way . Easily , and without correction by reason , her imagination made pictures , superb backgrounds casting a rich though phantom light upon the facts in the foreground . Splendid as the waters that drop with resounding thunder from high ledges of rock , and plunge downwards into the blue depths of night , was the presence of love she dreamt , drawing into it every drop of the force of life , and dashing them all asunder in the superb catastrophe in which everything was surrendered , and nothing might be reclaimed . The man , too , was some magnanimous hero , riding a great horse by the shore of the sea . They rode through forests together , they galloped by the rim of the sea . But waking , she was able to contemplate a perfectly loveless marriage , as the thing one did actually in real life , for possibly the people who dream thus are those who do the most prosaic things . At this moment she was much inclined to sit on into the night , spinning her light fabric of thoughts until she tired of their futility , and went to her mathematics ; but , as she knew very well , it was necessary that she should see her father before he went to bed . The case of Cyril Alardyce must be discussed , her mother ’s illusions and the rights of the family attended to . Being vague herself as to what all this amounted to , she had to take counsel with her father . She took her letters in her hand and went downstairs . It was past eleven , and the clocks had come into their reign , the grandfather ’s clock in the hall ticking in competition with the small clock on the landing . Mr. Hilbery ’s study ran out behind the rest of the house , on the ground floor , and was a very silent , subterranean place , the sun in daytime casting a mere abstract of light through a skylight upon his books and the large table , with its spread of white papers , now illumined by a green reading - lamp . Here Mr. Hilbery sat editing his review , or placing together documents by means of which it could be proved that Shelley had written “
39800	39803	38852	38853	Mary Datchet	175	” instead of “
39806	39819	38852	38853	Mary Datchet	175	” or that the inn in which Byron had slept was called the “
39823	39827	38852	38853	Mary Datchet	175	” and not the “
39831	40013	40014	40014	Isabella	223	” or that the Christian name of Keats ’s uncle had been John rather than Richard , for he knew more minute details about these poets than any man in England , probably , and was preparing an edition of Shelley which scrupulously observed the poet ’s system of punctuation . He saw the humor of these researches , but that did not prevent him from carrying them out with the utmost scrupulosity . He was lying back comfortably in a deep arm - chair smoking a cigar , and ruminating the fruitful question as to whether Coleridge had wished to marry Dorothy Wordsworth , and what , if he had done so , would have been the consequences to him in particular , and to literature in general . When Katharine came in he reflected that he knew what she had come for , and he made a pencil note before he spoke to her . Having done this , he saw that she was reading , and he watched her for a moment without saying anything . She was reading “
40021	40066	40014	40014	Isabella	223	” and her mind was full of the Italian hills and the blue daylight , and the hedges set with little rosettes of red and white roses . Feeling that her father waited for her , she sighed and said , shutting her book : “
40096	40097	40098	40098	Cyril	217	” “
40110	40155	40156	40156	He	217	” said Mr. Hilbery , in his pleasant and deliberate tones . Katharine found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation , while her father balanced his finger - tips so judiciously , and seemed to reserve so many of his thoughts for himself . “
40167	40198	40156	40156	He	217	” he continued . Without saying anything , he took Katharine ’s letters out of her hand , adjusted his eyeglasses , and read them through . At length he said “
40201	40210	40211	40211	Mother	159	” and gave the letters back to her . “
40217	40221	40211	40211	Mother	159	” Katharine remarked . “
40227	40228	40223	40223	you	0	” “
40250	40251	40236	40236	I	0	” “
40256	40275	40283	40283	he	1164	” Katharine asked , with some diffidence . Mr. Hilbery said nothing , and stared into the fire . “
40288	40320	40283	40283	he	1164	” he speculated at last , rather to himself than to her . Katharine had begun to read her aunt ’s letter over again , and she now quoted a sentence . “
40341	40342	40325	40325	He	1164	” “
40366	40370	40325	40325	He	1164	” he remarked . “
40386	40392	40397	40397	they	1167	” Katharine asked rather wearily . “
40402	40410	40397	40397	they	1167	” her father demanded with sudden irritation . “
40419	40420	40397	40397	they	1167	” “
40445	40476	40440	40440	them	1167	” said Mr. Hilbery , relapsing again into his arm - chair . Katharine was aware that she had touched a sensitive spot , however , in mentioning the family . “
40495	40499	40440	40440	them	1167	” she observed . “
40510	40520	40500	40500	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery replied with unwonted decision and authority . “
40552	40553	40554	40554	I	0	” “
40562	40566	40560	40560	Cyril	217	” Katharine observed . “
40577	40632	40569	40569	he	217	” Mr. Hilbery asked rather sharply . Katharine shook her head . She was , indeed , a good deal hurt that Cyril had not confided in her — did he think , as Ralph Denham or Mary Datchet might think , that she was , for some reason , unsympathetic — hostile even ? “
40638	40660	40694	40694	I	0	” said Mr. Hilbery , after a pause , in which he seemed to be considering the color of the flames , “
40711	40896	40898	40898	you	1176	” Granting the assumption that gentlemen of sixty who are highly cultivated , and have had much experience of life , probably think of many things which they do not say , Katharine could not help feeling rather puzzled by her father ’s attitude , as she went back to her room . What a distance he was from it all ! How superficially he smoothed these events into a semblance of decency which harmonized with his own view of life ! He never wondered what Cyril had felt , nor did the hidden aspects of the case tempt him to examine into them . He merely seemed to realize , rather languidly , that Cyril had behaved in a way which was foolish , because other people did not behave in that way . He seemed to be looking through a telescope at little figures hundreds of miles in the distance . Her selfish anxiety not to have to tell Mrs. Hilbery what had happened made her follow her father into the hall after breakfast the next morning in order to question him . “
40902	40935	40898	40898	you	1176	” she asked . Her manner to her father was almost stern , and she seemed to hold endless depths of reflection in the dark of her eyes . Mr. Hilbery sighed . “
40947	40964	40898	40898	you	1176	” He smoothed his silk hat energetically , and at once affected an air of hurry . “
40992	40993	40982	40982	I	0	” “
41001	41006	41007	41007	She	2916	” Katharine said decidedly . “
41028	41311	41312	41312	Katharine	129	” Mr. Hilbery had now placed his hat on his head , and his hand was on the door - knob . An expression which Katharine knew well from her childhood , when he asked her to shield him in some neglect of duty , came into his eyes ; malice , humor , and irresponsibility were blended in it . He nodded his head to and fro significantly , opened the door with an adroit movement , and stepped out with a lightness unexpected at his age . He waved his hand once to his daughter , and was gone . Left alone , Katharine could not help laughing to find herself cheated as usual in domestic bargainings with her father , and left to do the disagreeable work which belonged , by rights , to him . Katharine disliked telling her mother about Cyril ’s misbehavior quite as much as her father did , and for much the same reasons . They both shrank , nervously , as people fear the report of a gun on the stage , from all that would have to be said on this occasion . Katharine , moreover , was unable to decide what she thought of Cyril ’s misbehavior . As usual , she saw something which her father and mother did not see , and the effect of that something was to suspend Cyril ’s behavior in her mind without any qualification at all . They would think whether it was good or bad ; to her it was merely a thing that had happened . When Katharine reached the study , Mrs. Hilbery had already dipped her pen in the ink . “
41314	41324	41312	41312	Katharine	129	” she said , lifting it in the air , “
41400	42190	41384	41384	I	0	” She began her sentence , at any rate , and Katharine sat down at her own table , untied the bundle of old letters upon which she was working , smoothed them out absent - mindedly , and began to decipher the faded script . In a minute she looked across at her mother , to judge her mood . Peace and happiness had relaxed every muscle in her face ; her lips were parted very slightly , and her breath came in smooth , controlled inspirations like those of a child who is surrounding itself with a building of bricks , and increasing in ecstasy as each brick is placed in position . So Mrs. Hilbery was raising round her the skies and trees of the past with every stroke of her pen , and recalling the voices of the dead . Quiet as the room was , and undisturbed by the sounds of the present moment , Katharine could fancy that here was a deep pool of past time , and that she and her mother were bathed in the light of sixty years ago . What could the present give , she wondered , to compare with the rich crowd of gifts bestowed by the past ? Here was a Thursday morning in process of manufacture ; each second was minted fresh by the clock upon the mantelpiece . She strained her ears and could just hear , far off , the hoot of a motor - car and the rush of wheels coming nearer and dying away again , and the voices of men crying old iron and vegetables in one of the poorer streets at the back of the house . Rooms , of course , accumulate their suggestions , and any room in which one has been used to carry on any particular occupation gives off memories of moods , of ideas , of postures that have been seen in it ; so that to attempt any different kind of work there is almost impossible . Katharine was unconsciously affected , each time she entered her mother ’s room , by all these influences , which had had their birth years ago , when she was a child , and had something sweet and solemn about them , and connected themselves with early memories of the cavernous glooms and sonorous echoes of the Abbey where her grandfather lay buried . All the books and pictures , even the chairs and tables , had belonged to him , or had reference to him ; even the china dogs on the mantelpiece and the little shepherdesses with their sheep had been bought by him for a penny a piece from a man who used to stand with a tray of toys in Kensington High Street , as Katharine had often heard her mother tell . Often she had sat in this room , with her mind fixed so firmly on those vanished figures that she could almost see the muscles round their eyes and lips , and had given to each his own voice , with its tricks of accent , and his coat and his cravat . Often she had seemed to herself to be moving among them , an invisible ghost among the living , better acquainted with them than with her own friends , because she knew their secrets and possessed a divine foreknowledge of their destiny . They had been so unhappy , such muddlers , so wrong - headed , it seemed to her . She could have told them what to do , and what not to do . It was a melancholy fact that they would pay no heed to her , and were bound to come to grief in their own antiquated way . Their behavior was often grotesquely irrational ; their conventions monstrously absurd ; and yet , as she brooded upon them , she felt so closely attached to them that it was useless to try to pass judgment upon them . She very nearly lost consciousness that she was a separate being , with a future of her own . On a morning of slight depression , such as this , she would try to find some sort of clue to the muddle which their old letters presented ; some reason which seemed to make it worth while to them ; some aim which they kept steadily in view — but she was interrupted . Mrs. Hilbery had risen from her table , and was standing looking out of the window at a string of barges swimming up the river . Katharine watched her . Suddenly Mrs. Hilbery turned abruptly , and exclaimed : “
42221	42258	42214	42214	I	0	” She began to pace up and down the room , snatching up her duster ; but she was too much annoyed to find any relief , as yet , in polishing the backs of books . “
42261	42274	42275	42275	I	0	” she said , giving the sheet she had written to Katharine , “
42293	42305	42291	42291	Katharine	129	” She looked in a strangely beseeching way at her daughter . “
42352	42389	42349	42349	you	1184	” Katharine read what her mother had written . She might have been a schoolmaster criticizing a child ’s essay . Her face gave Mrs. Hilbery , who watched it anxiously , no ground for hope . “
42395	42399	42349	42349	you	1184	” she stated , “
42416	42417	42405	42405	mother	2916	” “
42423	42428	42405	42405	mother	2916	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed . “
42490	42498	42472	42472	I	0	” she said , touching her forehead , “
42521	42702	42511	42511	I	0	” From exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the imagination of her death aroused . The depression communicated itself to Katharine . How impotent they were , fiddling about all day long with papers ! And the clock was striking eleven and nothing done ! She watched her mother , now rummaging in a great brass - bound box which stood by her table , but she did not go to her help . Of course , Katharine reflected , her mother had now lost some paper , and they would waste the rest of the morning looking for it . She cast her eyes down in irritation , and read again her mother ’s musical sentences about the silver gulls , and the roots of little pink flowers washed by pellucid streams , and the blue mists of hyacinths , until she was struck by her mother ’s silence . She raised her eyes . Mrs. Hilbery had emptied a portfolio containing old photographs over her table , and was looking from one to another . “
42707	42711	42705	42705	Katharine	129	” she said , “
42765	42934	42757	42758	Uncle John	158	” Katharine looked at her mother , but did not stir or answer . She had suddenly become very angry , with a rage which their relationship made silent , and therefore doubly powerful and critical . She felt all the unfairness of the claim which her mother tacitly made to her time and sympathy , and what Mrs. Hilbery took , Katharine thought bitterly , she wasted . Then , in a flash , she remembered that she had still to tell her about Cyril ’s misbehavior . Her anger immediately dissipated itself ; it broke like some wave that has gathered itself high above the rest ; the waters were resumed into the sea again , and Katharine felt once more full of peace and solicitude , and anxious only that her mother should be protected from pain . She crossed the room instinctively , and sat on the arm of her mother ’s chair . Mrs. Hilbery leant her head against her daughter ’s body . “
42939	42948	42757	42758	Uncle John	158	” she mused , turning over the photographs , “
43096	43279	43282	43283	Janie Mannering	229	” Katharine tried to interrupt this discourse , but the opportunity did not come , and she could not forbear to turn over the pages of the album in which the old photographs were stored . The faces of these men and women shone forth wonderfully after the hubbub of living faces , and seemed , as her mother had said , to wear a marvelous dignity and calm , as if they had ruled their kingdoms justly and deserved great love . Some were of almost incredible beauty , others were ugly enough in a forcible way , but none were dull or bored or insignificant . The superb stiff folds of the crinolines suited the women ; the cloaks and hats of the gentlemen seemed full of character . Once more Katharine felt the serene air all round her , and seemed far off to hear the solemn beating of the sea upon the shore . But she knew that she must join the present on to this past . Mrs. Hilbery was rambling on , from story to story . “
43285	43307	43282	43283	Janie Mannering	229	” she said , pointing to a superb , white - haired dame , whose satin robes seemed strung with pearls . “
43393	43400	43401	43401	she	0	“ And that ’s Queenie Colquhoun , ”
43409	43528	43401	43401	she	0	“ who took her coffin out with her to Jamaica , packed with lovely shawls and bonnets , because you could n’t get coffins in Jamaica , and she had a horror of dying there ( as she did ) , and being devoured by the white ants . And there ’s Sabine , the loveliest of them all ; ah ! it was like a star rising when she came into the room . And that ’s Miriam , in her coachman ’s cloak , with all the little capes on , and she wore great top - boots underneath . You young people may say you ’re unconventional , but you ’re nothing compared with her . ”
43557	43563	43564	43565	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Ah , you wretch ! ”
43568	43765	43564	43565	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ what a wicked old despot you were , in your day ! How we all bowed down before you ! ‘ Maggie , ’ she used to say , ‘ if it had n’t been for me , where would you be now ? ’ And it was true ; she brought them together , you know . She said to my father , ‘ Marry her , ’ and he did ; and she said to poor little Clara , ‘ Fall down and worship him , ’ and she did ; but she got up again , of course . What else could one expect ? She was a mere child — eighteen — and half dead with fright , too . But that old tyrant never repented . She used to say that she had given them three perfect months , and no one had a right to more ; and I sometimes think , Katharine , that ’s true , you know . It ’s more than most of us have , only we have to pretend , which was a thing neither of them could ever do . I fancy , ”
43770	43797	43766	43767	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which , with all your outspokenness , you have n’t got . ”
43822	43832	43833	43833	she	130	“ They must have been good friends at heart , ”
43836	43852	43833	43833	she	130	“ because she used to sing his songs . Ah , how did it go ? ”
43890	43898	43899	43899	she	130	“ It ’s the vitality of them ! ”
43909	44037	43899	43899	she	130	“ That ’s what we have n’t got ! We ’re virtuous , we ’re earnest , we go to meetings , we pay the poor their wages , but we do n’t live as they lived . As often as not , my father was n’t in bed three nights out of the seven , but always fresh as paint in the morning . I hear him now , come singing up the stairs to the nursery , and tossing the loaf for breakfast on his sword - stick , and then off we went for a day ’s pleasuring — Richmond , Hampton Court , the Surrey Hills . Why should n’t we go , Katharine ? It ’s going to be a fine day . ”
44082	44086	44074	44074	Katharine	129	“ Aunt Celia ! ”
44313	44327	44328	44328	she	130	“ I think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril , mother , ”
44333	44350	44328	44328	she	130	“ Aunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married . He has a wife and children . ”
44351	44359	44360	44361	Mrs. Milvain	218	“ No , he is not married , ”
44374	44386	44369	44369	herself	218	“ He has two children , and another on the way . ”
44398	44414	44415	44415	Katharine	129	“ We thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you , ”
44418	44432	44415	44415	Katharine	129	“ But I met Cyril only a fortnight ago at the National Gallery ! ”
44437	44447	44433	44434	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ I do n’t believe a word of it , ”
44499	44510	44512	44513	Mrs. Milvain	218	“ I did n’t wish to believe it , Maggie , ”
44515	44539	44512	44513	Mrs. Milvain	218	“ For a long time I could n’t believe it . But now I ’ve seen , and I have to believe it . ”
44540	44543	44544	44545	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Katharine , ”
44548	44556	44544	44545	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ does your father know of this ? ”
44560	44564	44565	44566	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Cyril married ! ”
44569	44603	44565	44566	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ And never telling us a word , though we ’ve had him in our house since he was a child — noble William ’s son ! I ca n’t believe my ears ! ”
44680	44803	44665	44665	She	129	“ I have suspected for some time that he was not happy . There were new lines on his face . So I went to his rooms , when I knew he was engaged at the poor men ’s college . He lectures there — Roman law , you know , or it may be Greek . The landlady said Mr. Alardyce only slept there about once a fortnight now . He looked so ill , she said . She had seen him with a young person . I suspected something directly . I went to his room , and there was an envelope on the mantelpiece , and a letter with an address in Seton Street , off the Kennington Road . ”
44822	44829	44814	44814	her	130	“ I went to Seton Street , ”
44835	44899	44830	44831	Aunt Celia	219	“ A very low place — lodging - houses , you know , with canaries in the window . Number seven just like all the others . I rang , I knocked ; no one came . I went down the area . I am certain I saw some one inside — children — a cradle . But no reply — no reply . ”
44922	44929	44930	44930	she	219	“ I stood in the street , ”
44933	45000	44930	44930	she	219	“ in case I could catch a sight of one of them . It seemed a very long time . There were rough men singing in the public - house round the corner . At last the door opened , and some one — it must have been the woman herself — came right past me . There was only the pillar - box between us . ”
45001	45009	45010	45011	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ And what did she look like ? ”
45014	45026	45010	45011	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ One could see how the poor boy had been deluded , ”
45038	45042	45043	45044	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Poor thing ! ”
45047	45051	45043	45044	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ Poor Cyril ! ”
45063	45073	45074	45075	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ But they ’ve got nothing to live upon , ”
45078	45089	45090	45090	she	130	“ If he ’d come to us like a man , ”
45094	45159	45090	45090	she	130	“ and said , ‘ I ’ve been a fool , ’ one would have pitied him ; one would have tried to help him . There ’s nothing so disgraceful after all — But he ’s been going about all these years , pretending , letting one take it for granted , that he was single . And the poor deserted little wife — ”
45160	45167	45168	45169	Aunt Celia	219	“ She is not his wife , ”
45172	45181	45168	45169	Aunt Celia	219	“ I ’ve never heard anything so detestable ! ”
45326	45337	45338	45338	she	130	“ We must realize Cyril ’s point of view first , ”
45531	45538	45521	45521	she	237	“ made a life for herself , ”
45549	45554	45555	45555	she	237	“ This unhappy business , ”
45565	45619	45555	45555	she	237	“ If the train had not gone out of the station just as I arrived , I should have been with you before . Celia has doubtless told you . You will agree with me , Maggie . He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the children — ”
45620	45629	45630	45631	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ But does he refuse to marry her ? ”
45641	45653	45630	45631	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ He has written an absurd perverted letter , all quotations , ”
45658	45695	45654	45655	Cousin Caroline	237	“ He thinks he ’s doing a very fine thing , where we only see the folly of it .... The girl ’s every bit as infatuated as he is — for which I blame him . ”
45696	45701	45702	45703	Aunt Celia	219	“ She entangled him , ”
45734	45752	45754	45755	Cousin Caroline	237	“ It ’s no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now , Celia , ”
45802	45859	45794	45794	her	218	“ The mischief ’s done , and very ugly mischief too . Are we to allow the third child to be born out of wedlock ? ( I am sorry to have to say these things before you , Katharine . ) He will bear your name , Maggie — your father ’s name , remember . ”
45860	45871	45873	45874	Mrs. Hilbery	130	“ But let us hope it will be a girl , ”
45949	45957	45958	45958	she	380	“ It ’s detestable — quite detestable ! ”
45989	46007	46008	46008	she	380	“ Nowadays , people do n’t think so badly of these things as they used to do , ”
46011	46132	46133	46133	she	380	“ It will be horribly uncomfortable for them sometimes , but if they are brave , clever children , as they will be , I dare say it ’ll make remarkable people of them in the end . Robert Browning used to say that every great man has Jewish blood in him , and we must try to look at it in that light . And , after all , Cyril has acted on principle . One may disagree with his principle , but , at least , one can respect it — like the French Revolution , or Cromwell cutting the King ’s head off . Some of the most terrible things in history have been done on principle , ”
46136	46149	46133	46133	she	380	“ I ’m afraid I take a very different view of principle , ”
46155	46158	46150	46151	Cousin Caroline	237	“ Principle ! ”
46176	46187	46188	46188	she	380	“ I will go to - morrow and see him , ”
46191	46205	46188	46188	she	380	“ But why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself , Celia ? ”
46385	46396	46397	46397	she	129	“ Perhaps it would be better if I married William , ”
48744	48773	48723	48723	She	129	“ It ’s life that matters , nothing but life — the process of discovering — the everlasting and perpetual process , not the discovery itself at all . ”
49052	49055	49056	49056	she	175	“ Now , ”
49067	49093	49094	49094	she	175	“ I ’m not going to let these silly ideas come into my head .... Do n’t you think Mr. Asquith deserves to be hanged ? ”
49195	49244	49192	49192	he	154	“ How absurd Mary would think me if she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea in order to look at Katharine ’s windows . She would n’t understand it , but I like her very much as she is . ”
49403	49406	49407	49407	he	154	“ Here , ”
49410	49425	49407	49407	he	154	“ is where we differ from women ; they have no sense of romance . ”
49426	49431	49432	49432	he	154	“ Well , Mary , ”
49437	49446	49432	49432	he	154	“ why do n’t you say something amusing ? ”
49476	49489	49471	49471	she	175	“ Because I ’ve got nothing amusing to say , I suppose . ”
49500	49513	49514	49514	he	154	“ You work too hard . I do n’t mean your health , ”
49522	49539	49514	49514	he	154	“ I mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your work . ”
49540	49548	49549	49549	she	175	“ And is that a bad thing ? ”
49559	49565	49566	49566	he	154	“ I think it is , ”
49570	49582	49566	49566	he	154	“ But only a week ago you were saying the opposite . ”
49739	49748	49749	49749	he	154	“ You do n’t read enough , Mary , ”
49753	49761	49749	49749	he	154	“ You ought to read more poetry . ”
49849	49862	49844	49844	she	175	“ I ’m behaving exactly as I said I would n’t behave , ”
49877	49888	49864	49864	she	175	“ Tell me what I ought to read , then . ”
49928	49935	49936	49936	he	154	“ You live with your inferiors , ”
49950	50108	50109	50109	he	154	“ And you get into a groove because , on the whole , it ’s rather a pleasant groove . And you tend to forget what you ’re there for . You ’ve the feminine habit of making much of details . You do n’t see when things matter and when they do n’t . And that ’s what ’s the ruin of all these organizations . That ’s why the Suffragists have never done anything all these years . What ’s the point of drawing - room meetings and bazaars ? You want to have ideas , Mary ; get hold of something big ; never mind making mistakes , but do n’t niggle . Why do n’t you throw it all up for a year , and travel?—see something of the world . Do n’t be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life . But you wo n’t , ”
50112	50130	50132	50132	Mary	175	“ I ’ve rather come to that way of thinking myself — about myself , I mean , ”
50140	50150	50132	50132	Mary	175	“ I should like to go somewhere far away . ”
50163	50181	50159	50159	Ralph	154	“ But look here , Mary , you have n’t been taking this seriously , have you ? ”
50214	50224	50225	50225	he	154	“ You wo n’t go away , will you ? ”
50237	50246	50234	50234	he	154	“ Oh no , do n’t go away . ”
50247	50259	50260	50260	she	175	“ I do n’t know exactly what I mean to do , ”
50711	50733	50735	50735	Katharine	129	“ It ’s life that matters , nothing but life — the process of discovering , the everlasting and perpetual process , ”
50756	50764	50765	50765	She	129	“ not the discovery itself at all . ”
51009	51014	51015	51015	she	175	“ Well , William , ”
51018	51026	51015	51015	she	175	“ I ’m afraid I ’m late . ”
51292	51300	51289	51289	she	175	“ I like your sonnet very much . ”
51604	51613	51614	51614	she	129	“ My oysters ! I had a basket , ”
51617	51644	51614	51614	she	129	“ and I ’ve left it somewhere . Uncle Dudley dines with us to - night . What in the world have I done with them ? ”
51669	51679	51655	51655	William	176	“ Oysters , oysters — your basket of oysters ! ”
51726	51731	51732	51732	she	129	“ I had them , ”
51735	51751	51752	51752	she	129	“ in the Strand ; I sat on a seat . Well , never mind , ”
51762	51776	51752	51752	she	129	“ I dare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time . ”
51777	51788	51789	51789	William	176	“ I should have thought that you never forgot anything , ”
51798	51811	51812	51812	Katharine	129	“ That ’s part of the myth about me , I know , ”
51815	51820	51821	51821	William	176	“ And I wonder , ”
51828	51848	51849	51849	he	176	“ what the truth about you is ? But I know this sort of thing does n’t interest you , ”
51859	51870	51871	51871	she	129	“ No ; it does n’t interest me very much , ”
51875	51883	51884	51884	he	176	“ What shall we talk about then ? ”
51898	51948	51887	51887	She	129	“ However we start , we end by talking about the same thing — about poetry , I mean . I wonder if you realize , William , that I ’ve never read even Shakespeare ? It ’s rather wonderful how I ’ve kept it up all these years . ”
51949	51968	51969	51969	he	176	“ You ’ve kept it up for ten years very beautifully , as far as I ’m concerned , ”
51972	51981	51969	51969	he	176	“ Ten years ? So long as that ? ”
51982	51994	51995	51995	he	176	“ And I do n’t think it ’s always bored you , ”
52273	52283	52284	52284	he	176	“ You may say you do n’t read books , ”
52287	52329	52284	52284	he	176	“ but , all the same , you know about them . Besides , who wants you to be learned ? Leave that to the poor devils who ’ve got nothing better to do . You — you — ahem ! — ”
52330	52346	52348	52348	Katharine	129	“ Well , then , why do n’t you read me something before I go ? ”
52355	52377	52378	52378	He	176	“ Katharine , you ’ve only just come ! Let me see now , what have I got to show you ? ”
52423	52436	52437	52437	he	176	“ I believe you only ask me to read out of kindness , ”
52441	52457	52437	52437	he	176	“ Let ’s find something else to talk about . Who have you been seeing ? ”
52458	52469	52470	52470	Katharine	129	“ I do n’t generally ask things out of kindness , ”
52473	52488	52470	52470	Katharine	129	“ however , if you do n’t want to read , you need n’t . ”
52527	52540	52541	52541	he	176	“ One can trust you , certainly , to say unpleasant things , ”
52561	52625	52626	52626	He	176	“ Ahem ! The Princess is lost in the wood , and she hears the sound of a horn . ( This would all be very pretty on the stage , but I ca n’t get the effect here . ) Anyhow , Sylvano enters , accompanied by the rest of the gentlemen of Gratian ’s court . I begin where he soliloquizes . ”
52893	52919	52886	52886	Katharine	129	“ That seems to me extremely well written , William ; although , of course , I do n’t know enough to criticize in detail . ”
52920	52934	53177	53177	his	1377	“ But it ’s the skill that strikes you — not the emotion ? ”
52935	52951	52886	52886	Katharine	129	“ In a fragment like that , of course , the skill strikes one most . ”
52952	52996	52886	52886	Katharine	129	“ But perhaps — have you time to listen to one more short piece ? the scene between the lovers ? There ’s some real feeling in that , I think . Denham agrees that it ’s the best thing I ’ve done . ”
52997	53006	53007	53007	Katharine	129	“ You ’ve read it to Ralph Denham ? ”
53013	53028	53007	53007	Katharine	129	“ He ’s a better judge than I am . What did he say ? ”
53029	53034	53035	53035	Rodney	176	“ My dear Katharine , ”
53038	53169	53035	53035	Rodney	176	“ I do n’t ask you for criticism , as I should ask a scholar . I dare say there are only five men in England whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me . But I trust you where feeling is concerned . I had you in my mind often when I was writing those scenes . I kept asking myself , ‘ Now is this the sort of thing Katharine would like ? ’ I always think of you when I ’m writing , Katharine , even when it ’s the sort of thing you would n’t know about . And I ’d rather — yes , I really believe I ’d rather — you thought well of my writing than any one in the world . ”
53186	53197	53198	53198	she	129	“ You think too much of me altogether , William , ”
53213	53222	53223	53223	he	1377	“ No , Katharine , I do n’t , ”
53233	53243	53223	53223	he	1377	“ It does me good to think of you . ”
53687	53690	53691	53691	she	129	“ William , ”
53712	53715	53716	53716	she	129	“ William , ”
53720	53733	53716	53716	she	129	“ if you still want me to marry you , I will . ”
53848	54455	53845	53846	Mrs. Milvain	218	“ ... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram . Such a nice , rich , English name , too , and , in addition , he has all the graces of intellect ; he has read literally everything . I tell Katharine , I shall always put him on my right side at dinner , so as to have him by me when people begin talking about characters in Shakespeare . They wo n’t be rich , but they ’ll be very , very happy . I was sitting in my room late one night , feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again , when I heard Katharine outside in the passage , and I thought to myself , ‘ Shall I call her in ? ’ and then I thought ( in that hopeless , dreary way one does think , with the fire going out and one ’s birthday just over ) , ‘ Why should I lay my troubles on her ? ’ But my little self - control had its reward , for next moment she tapped at the door and came in , and sat on the rug , and though we neither of us said anything , I felt so happy all of a second that I could n’t help crying , ‘ Oh , Katharine , when you come to my age , how I hope you ’ll have a daughter , too ! ’ You know how silent Katharine is . She was so silent , for such a long time , that in my foolish , nervous state I dreaded something , I do n’t quite know what . And then she told me how , after all , she had made up her mind . She had written . She expected him to - morrow . At first I was n’t glad at all . I did n’t want her to marry any one ; but when she said , ‘ It will make no difference . I shall always care for you and father most , ’ then I saw how selfish I was , and I told her she must give him everything , everything , everything ! I told her I should be thankful to come second . But why , when everything ’s turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out , why then can one do nothing but cry , nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life ’s been a failure , and now is nearly over , and age is so cruel ? But Katharine said to me , ‘ I am happy . I ’m very happy . ’ And then I thought , though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time , Katharine had said she was happy , and I should have a son , and it would all turn out so much more wonderfully than I could possibly imagine , for though the sermons do n’t say so , I do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in . She told me that they would live quite near us , and see us every day ; and she would go on with the Life , and we should finish it as we had meant to . And , after all , it would be far more horrid if she did n’t marry — or suppose she married some one we could n’t endure ? Suppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already ? “
54667	54726	54739	54739	Denham	154	“ One does n’t know any more , does one ? One has n’t any advice to give one ’s children . One can only hope that they will have the same vision and the same power to believe , without which life would be so meaningless . That is what I ask for Katharine and her husband . ”
54727	54738	54739	54739	Denham	154	“ Is Mr. Hilbery at home , or Mrs. Hilbery ? ”
54754	54766	54767	54768	the girl	413	“ No , sir . But Miss Hilbery is at home , ”
54941	54947	54948	54948	she	129	“ My father is out , ”
54951	54963	54948	54948	she	129	“ But if you can wait , I expect him soon . ”
55016	55027	55028	55028	he	154	“ Is that one of the moderns whom you despise ? ”
55039	55042	55043	55043	she	129	“ Yes , ”
55046	55055	55043	55043	she	129	“ I think even you would despise him . ”
55056	55060	55061	55061	he	154	“ Even I ? ”
55064	55069	55061	55061	he	154	“ Why even I ? ”
55070	55084	55043	55043	she	129	“ You said you liked modern things ; I said I hated them . ”
55114	55125	55126	55126	she	129	“ Or did I confess that I hated all books ? ”
55140	55144	55126	55126	she	129	“ I forget — ”
55145	55152	55153	55153	he	154	“ Do you hate all books ? ”
55156	55187	55126	55126	she	129	“ It would be absurd to say that I hate all books when I ’ve only read ten , perhaps ; but — ’ Here she pulled herself up short . “
55190	55191	55126	55126	she	129	” “
55199	55203	55206	55206	you	154	” she continued . “
55239	55592	55593	55593	My	0	” She cut a cake vigorously into slices , and providing a tray with bread and butter for Mrs. Hilbery , who was in her room with a cold , she rose to go upstairs . Ralph held the door open for her , and then stood with clasped hands in the middle of the room . His eyes were bright , and , indeed , he scarcely knew whether they beheld dreams or realities . All down the street and on the doorstep , and while he mounted the stairs , his dream of Katharine possessed him ; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it , in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her and what she was . And in five minutes she had filled the shell of the old dream with the flesh of life ; looked with fire out of phantom eyes . He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables ; they were solid , for he grasped the back of the chair in which Katharine had sat ; and yet they were unreal ; the atmosphere was that of a dream . He summoned all the faculties of his spirit to seize what the minutes had to give him ; and from the depths of his mind there rose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that human nature surpasses , in its beauty , all that our wildest dreams bring us hints of . Katharine came into the room a moment later . He stood watching her come towards him , and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream of her ; for the real Katharine could speak the words which seemed to crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes , and the commonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light . And she overflowed the edges of the dream ; he remarked that her softness was like that of some vast snowy owl ; she wore a ruby on her finger . “
55601	55605	55607	55607	she	2968	” she said , “
55630	55635	55615	55615	She	2968	” she went on . “
55667	55668	55669	55669	You	0	” “
55679	55683	55669	55669	You	0	” said Ralph . “
55696	55707	55694	55694	you	1427	” she inquired , turning upon him with a laugh . “
55716	55717	55709	55709	I	0	” “
55728	55783	55723	55723	you	1427	” she said , searching him for proof of this apparently , with eyes now almost impersonally direct . It would be easy , Ralph thought , to worship one so far removed , and yet of so straight a nature ; easy to submit recklessly to her , without thought of future pain . “
55789	55822	55786	55787	a poet	3071	” she demanded . He felt that her question had an unexplained weight of meaning behind it , as if she sought an answer to a question that she did not ask . “
55834	55838	55825	55825	I	0	” he replied . “
55861	55862	55851	55851	I	0	” “
55869	55891	55865	55865	you	1427	” she asked , almost with impatience , tapping her spoon two or three times against the side of her cup . “
55894	55907	55865	55865	you	1427	” Ralph laid hands on the first words that came to mind . “
55923	55968	55969	55969	I	0	” A curious change came over her face , as if the flame of her mind were subdued ; and she looked at him ironically and with the expression which he had called sad before , for want of a better name for it . “
55982	55986	55865	55865	you	1427	” she said . “
55992	55997	55988	55988	you	0	” he replied energetically . “
56016	56040	56013	56013	I	0	” She followed his words with parted lips , as though to answer eagerly when he had done ; but as he said , “
56046	56116	56043	56043	I	0	” the door of the drawing - room swung open , and so remained for a perceptible instant . They both held themselves silent , her lips still parted . Far off , they heard the rustle of skirts . Then the owner of the skirts appeared in the doorway , which she almost filled , nearly concealing the figure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her . “
56120	56442	56043	56043	I	0	” Katharine murmured , under her breath . Her tone had a hint of tragedy in it , but no less , Ralph thought , than the situation required . She addressed the larger lady as Aunt Millicent ; the smaller was Aunt Celia , Mrs. Milvain , who had lately undertaken the task of marrying Cyril to his wife . Both ladies , but Mrs. Cosham ( Aunt Millicent ) in particular , had that look of heightened , smoothed , incarnadined existence which is proper to elderly ladies paying calls in London about five o’clock in the afternoon . Portraits by Romney , seen through glass , have something of their pink , mellow look , their blooming softness , as of apricots hanging upon a red wall in the afternoon sun . Mrs. Cosham was so appareled with hanging muffs , chains , and swinging draperies that it was impossible to detect the shape of a human being in the mass of brown and black which filled the arm - chair . Mrs. Milvain was a much slighter figure ; but the same doubt as to the precise lines of her contour filled Ralph , as he regarded them , with dismal foreboding . What remark of his would ever reach these fabulous and fantastic characters?—for there was something fantastically unreal in the curious swayings and noddings of Mrs. Cosham , as if her equipment included a large wire spring . Her voice had a high - pitched , cooing note , which prolonged words and cut them short until the English language seemed no longer fit for common purposes . In a moment of nervousness , so Ralph thought , Katharine had turned on innumerable electric lights . But Mrs. Cosham had gained impetus ( perhaps her swaying movements had that end in view ) for sustained speech ; and she now addressed Ralph deliberately and elaborately . “
56514	56584	56597	56597	you	253	” Her rich and romantic notes were accompanied by a wave of a long white hand , which , when waved , gave off a flash of diamonds , rubies , and emeralds . Ralph wondered whether she more resembled an elephant , with a jeweled head - dress , or a superb cockatoo , balanced insecurely upon its perch , and pecking capriciously at a lump of sugar . “
56591	56595	56597	56597	you	253	” she repeated . “
56605	56606	56602	56603	Mr. Popham	253	” “
56612	56616	56607	56607	I	0	” he replied . “
56634	56668	56629	56629	John	158	” she jerked in the direction of Katharine . She sank her head upon her breast , as if for a moment ’s meditation , which past , she looked up and observed : “
56736	56743	56746	56747	De Quincey	254	marvel”—here she displayed both her beautiful white hands—“do
56768	56769	56763	56763	you	253	” “
56777	56781	56774	56775	De Quincey	254	” Ralph protested , “
56790	56791	56786	56786	Chesterton	48	” “
56794	56808	56786	56786	Chesterton	48	” exclaimed Mrs. Cosham , with a gesture of surprise and relief mingled . “
56834	56858	56831	56832	De Quincey	254	” Here she hollowed her hand into a screen , and , leaning towards Katharine , inquired , in a very audible whisper , “
56864	56865	56866	56867	Mr. Denham	131	” “
56869	56882	56866	56867	Mr. Denham	131	” said Katharine , with more than her usual clearness and firmness , “
56893	56894	56890	56891	a lawyer	1316	” “
56925	56926	56922	56923	Mr. Denham	131	” “
56939	56962	56927	56927	They	1449	” Mrs. Milvain interposed , the frail , silvery notes of her voice falling with the sweet tone of an old bell . “
56970	56974	56963	56963	You	253	” she continued . “
57003	57013	56963	56963	You	253	” Ralph shook his head , and she sighed . “
57057	57062	57052	57052	Emily	257	” she addressed Katharine . “
57070	57071	57063	57063	They	1457	” “
57080	57087	57063	57063	They	1457	” Mrs. Cosham ejaculated , reminiscently . “
57105	57150	57151	57152	Uncle John	158	” Katharine laughed . She looked at Ralph . His eyes were meditative , and she wondered what he found in this old gossip to make him ponder so contentedly . She felt , she hardly knew why , a curious pity for him . “
57170	57192	57161	57161	you	1461	” she asked , to make them go on talking , which , indeed , they needed little invitation to do . “
57217	57225	57207	57208	Poor John	258	” Mrs. Milvain hastened to inform them . “
57286	57294	57283	57283	I	0	” she said , turning to Ralph , “
57301	57302	57283	57283	I	0	” “
57305	57311	57283	57283	I	0	” Mrs. Cosham confirmed her , “
57356	57360	57362	57362	you	1466	” she sighed , “
57392	57396	57383	57383	you	1466	” she concluded . “
57401	57412	57398	57398	I	0	” Mrs. Milvain resumed , lowering her voice rather confidentially , “
57533	57543	57528	57528	I	0	” she added , summing up these scattered remarks , “
57557	57593	57528	57528	I	0	” Mrs. Cosham approved of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity from her side of the tea - table , in the first place by swaying her head , and in the second by remarking : “
57692	57693	57679	57679	you	0	” “
57700	57707	57694	57694	I	0	” said Ralph good - humoredly . “
57714	57715	57711	57712	a solicitor	996	” “
57722	57746	57717	57717	you	0	” Mrs. Cosham demanded , afraid lest she should be balked of her priceless discovery , a young man truly devoted to literature . “
57752	57757	57717	57717	you	0	” Denham reassured her . “
57763	57768	57717	57717	you	0	” Mrs. Cosham echoed . “
57778	57915	57717	57717	you	0	” She half closed her eyes , and indulged herself in a fascinating picture of a briefless barrister lodged in a garret , writing immortal novels by the light of a farthing dip . But the romance which fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false radiance in her case . She carried her pocket Shakespeare about with her , and met life fortified by the words of the poets . How far she saw Denham , and how far she confused him with some hero of fiction , it would be hard to say . Literature had taken possession even of her memories . She was matching him , presumably , with certain characters in the old novels , for she came out , after a pause , with : “
57930	57935	57928	57928	Laura	261	” she pronounced energetically , “
58055	58078	58079	58079	They	1501	” She drew out her small , worn volume with some difficulty , opened it , and shook it in the air . “
58157	58178	58181	58182	Mrs. Cosham	251	” Thus called upon to sum up the worth of human nature in a few words , Ralph answered unhesitatingly : “
58202	58203	58196	58200	a bit of a rascal	1508	” “
58209	58210	58205	58207	the ordinary woman	1509	” “
58222	58223	58213	58213	I	0	” “
58241	58246	58247	58247	Swift	269	” Mrs. Cosham sighed . “
58256	58289	58247	58247	Swift	269	” She looked at him , and thought that there were signs of distinct power in his brow . He would do well , she thought , to devote himself to satire . “
58300	58326	58297	58298	a solicitor	996	” Mrs. Milvain interposed , rather resenting the waste of time involved in talking about fictitious people when you might be talking about real people . “
58336	58337	58334	58334	Katharine	129	” “
58348	58361	58345	58345	I	0	” said Katharine , waking from other thoughts with her little start . “
58389	58390	58391	58391	She	129	” “
58402	58407	58408	58408	Millais	271	” Mrs. Cosham corroborated . “
58429	58430	58425	58425	he	271	” “
58451	58452	58432	58432	I	0	” “
58465	58470	58432	58432	I	0	” Mrs. Milvain continued . “
58530	58544	58524	58525	a nurse	1523	” she went on , telling her story with charming solemnity to Ralph , “
58669	58670	58671	58671	I	0	” “
58683	58687	58680	58681	Aunt Celia	219	” said Katharine . “
58729	58730	58716	58717	your mother	3081	” “
58746	58754	58742	58742	I	0	” said Mrs. Cosham , rather tartly . “
58762	58766	58769	58769	her	1537	” she continued , “
58794	58795	58781	58781	Providence	273	” “
58798	58819	58781	58781	Providence	273	” said Katharine , with a laugh , for she liked the rashness which irritated the rest of the family . “
58833	58834	58781	58781	Providence	273	” “
58837	58842	58781	58781	Providence	273	” said Mrs. Milvain , “
58857	58858	58859	58859	I	0	” “
58870	58898	58863	58863	William	170	” said Katharine . It happened that Mrs. Cosham had once more produced her pocket volume of Shakespeare , and was consulting Ralph upon an obscure passage in “
58903	58978	58863	58863	William	170	” He did not at once seize the meaning of what Katharine and her aunt were saying ; William , he supposed , referred to some small cousin , for he now saw Katharine as a child in a pinafore ; but , nevertheless , he was so much distracted that his eye could hardly follow the words on the paper . A moment later he heard them speak distinctly of an engagement ring . “
58983	58997	58998	58998	Rodney	176	” he heard Katharine say . Mrs. Cosham intoned ; at the same instant “
58999	59003	59004	59004	William	176	” fitted itself to “
59005	59125	58998	58998	Rodney	176	” in Ralph ’s mind . He felt convinced that Katharine was engaged to Rodney . His first sensation was one of violent rage with her for having deceived him throughout the visit , fed him with pleasant old wives ’ tales , let him see her as a child playing in a meadow , shared her youth with him , while all the time she was a stranger entirely , and engaged to marry Rodney . But was it possible ? Surely it was not possible . For in his eyes she was still a child . He paused so long over the book that Mrs. Cosham had time to look over his shoulder and ask her niece : “
59137	59157	59128	59128	you	1540	” This convinced him of the truth of the monstrous idea . He looked up at once and said : “
59166	59255	59128	59128	you	1540	” His voice had changed so much , he spoke with such curtness and even with such contempt , that Mrs. Cosham looked at him fairly puzzled . Happily she belonged to a generation which expected uncouthness in its men , and she merely felt convinced that this Mr. Denham was very , very clever . She took back her Shakespeare , as Denham seemed to have no more to say , and secreted it once more about her person with the infinitely pathetic resignation of the old . “
59263	59275	59260	59261	William Rodney	176	” she said , by way of filling in the pause ; “
59295	59303	59283	59283	He	176	” She nodded her head rather vaguely . “
59310	59400	59283	59283	He	176	” Denham ’s one wish was to leave the house as soon as he could ; but the elderly ladies had risen , and were proposing to visit Mrs. Hilbery in her bedroom , so that any move on his part was impossible . At the same time , he wished to say something , but he knew not what , to Katharine alone . She took her aunts upstairs , and returned , coming towards him once more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him . “
59407	59411	59401	59402	My father	2986	” she said . “
59418	59448	59449	59449	I	0	” and she laughed , as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the tea - party . But Ralph made no attempt to seat himself . “
59454	59458	59449	59449	I	0	” he said . “
59465	59480	59481	59481	My	0	” He saw her face change , but only to become graver than before . “
59484	59488	59481	59481	My	0	” she asked . “
59499	59551	59496	59497	William Rodney	176	” Ralph remained standing with his hand on the back of a chair in absolute silence . Abysses seemed to plunge into darkness between them . He looked at her , but her face showed that she was not thinking of him . No regret or consciousness of wrong disturbed her . “
59558	59579	59554	59554	I	0	” he said at length . She seemed about to say something , then changed her mind and said merely : “
59590	59591	59554	59554	I	0	seem”—she hesitated—“to
59595	60229	59588	59588	We	1547	” He bowed and left the room . Ralph strode with extreme swiftness along the Embankment . Every muscle was taut and braced as if to resist some sudden attack from outside . For the moment it seemed as if the attack were about to be directed against his body , and his brain thus was on the alert , but without understanding . Finding himself , after a few minutes , no longer under observation , and no attack delivered , he slackened his pace , the pain spread all through him , took possession of every governing seat , and met with scarcely any resistance from powers exhausted by their first effort at defence . He took his way languidly along the river embankment , away from home rather than towards it . The world had him at its mercy . He made no pattern out of the sights he saw . He felt himself now , as he had often fancied other people , adrift on the stream , and far removed from control of it , a man with no grasp upon circumstances any longer . Old battered men loafing at the doors of public - houses now seemed to be his fellows , and he felt , as he supposed them to feel , a mingling of envy and hatred towards those who passed quickly and certainly to a goal of their own . They , too , saw things very thin and shadowy , and were wafted about by the lightest breath of wind . For the substantial world , with its prospect of avenues leading on and on to the invisible distance , had slipped from him , since Katharine was engaged . Now all his life was visible , and the straight , meager path had its ending soon enough . Katharine was engaged , and she had deceived him , too . He felt for corners of his being untouched by his disaster ; but there was no limit to the flood of damage ; not one of his possessions was safe now . Katharine had deceived him ; she had mixed herself with every thought of his , and reft of her they seemed false thoughts which he would blush to think again . His life seemed immeasurably impoverished . He sat himself down , in spite of the chilly fog which obscured the farther bank and left its lights suspended upon a blank surface , upon one of the riverside seats , and let the tide of disillusionment sweep through him . For the time being all bright points in his life were blotted out ; all prominences leveled . At first he made himself believe that Katharine had treated him badly , and drew comfort from the thought that , left alone , she would recollect this , and think of him and tender him , in silence , at any rate , an apology . But this grain of comfort failed him after a second or two , for , upon reflection , he had to admit that Katharine owed him nothing . Katharine had promised nothing , taken nothing ; to her his dreams had meant nothing . This , indeed , was the lowest pitch of his despair . If the best of one ’s feelings means nothing to the person most concerned in those feelings , what reality is left us ? The old romance which had warmed his days for him , the thoughts of Katharine which had painted every hour , were now made to appear foolish and enfeebled . He rose , and looked into the river , whose swift race of dun - colored waters seemed the very spirit of futility and oblivion . “
60238	60262	59588	59588	We	1547	” he thought , as he leant there . So feeble and insubstantial did he feel himself that he repeated the word aloud . “
60294	60882	60885	60885	Mary	175	” Now Denham had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep alive a fine anger when he chose . Rodney provided a good target for that emotion . And yet at the moment , Rodney and Katharine herself seemed disembodied ghosts . He could scarcely remember the look of them . His mind plunged lower and lower . Their marriage seemed of no importance to him . All things had turned to ghosts ; the whole mass of the world was insubstantial vapor , surrounding the solitary spark in his mind , whose burning point he could remember , for it burnt no more . He had once cherished a belief , and Katharine had embodied this belief , and she did so no longer . He did not blame her ; he blamed nothing , nobody ; he saw the truth . He saw the dun - colored race of waters and the blank shore . But life is vigorous ; the body lives , and the body , no doubt , dictated the reflection , which now urged him to movement , that one may cast away the forms of human beings , and yet retain the passion which seemed inseparable from their existence in the flesh . Now this passion burnt on his horizon , as the winter sun makes a greenish pane in the west through thinning clouds . His eyes were set on something infinitely far and remote ; by that light he felt he could walk , and would , in future , have to find his way . But that was all there was left to him of a populous and teeming world . The lunch hour in the office was only partly spent by Denham in the consumption of food . Whether fine or wet , he passed most of it pacing the gravel paths in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . The children got to know his figure , and the sparrows expected their daily scattering of bread - crumbs . No doubt , since he often gave a copper and almost always a handful of bread , he was not as blind to his surroundings as he thought himself . He thought that these winter days were spent in long hours before white papers radiant in electric light ; and in short passages through fog - dimmed streets . When he came back to his work after lunch he carried in his head a picture of the Strand , scattered with omnibuses , and of the purple shapes of leaves pressed flat upon the gravel , as if his eyes had always been bent upon the ground . His brain worked incessantly , but his thought was attended with so little joy that he did not willingly recall it ; but drove ahead , now in this direction , now in that ; and came home laden with dark books borrowed from a library . Mary Datchet , coming from the Strand at lunch - time , saw him one day taking his turn , closely buttoned in an overcoat , and so lost in thought that he might have been sitting in his own room . She was overcome by something very like awe by the sight of him ; then she felt much inclined to laugh , although her pulse beat faster . She passed him , and he never saw her . She came back and touched him on the shoulder . “
60887	60891	60885	60885	Mary	175	” he exclaimed . “
60897	60898	60901	60901	You	0	” “
60912	60916	60905	60905	you	0	” she said . “
60934	60935	60936	60936	I	0	” “
60944	60951	60936	60936	I	0	” Ralph replied , rather hastily . “
60966	61081	61082	61082	I	0	” he added , rather grimly . The morning was fine , and they had still some minutes of leisure to spend . They had not met for two or three weeks , and Mary had much to say to Ralph ; but she was not certain how far he wished for her company . However , after a turn or two , in which a few facts were communicated , he suggested sitting down , and she took the seat beside him . The sparrows came fluttering about them , and Ralph produced from his pocket the half of a roll saved from his luncheon . He threw a few crumbs among them . “
61090	61100	61082	61082	I	0	” Mary observed , by way of saying something . “
61103	61107	61082	61082	I	0	” said Ralph . “
61136	61178	61126	61126	I	0	” Mary felt that she could have forgone this display of animal good temper , but seeing that Ralph , for some curious reason , took a pride in the sparrows , she bet him sixpence that he would not succeed . “
61181	61274	61126	61126	I	0	” he said ; and his eye , which had been gloomy , showed a spark of light . His conversation was now addressed entirely to a bald cock - sparrow , who seemed bolder than the rest ; and Mary took the opportunity of looking at him . She was not satisfied ; his face was worn , and his expression stern . A child came bowling its hoop through the concourse of birds , and Ralph threw his last crumbs of bread into the bushes with a snort of impatience . “
61289	61293	61283	61283	I	0	” he said . “
61326	61327	61315	61315	They	1558	” “
61344	61345	61339	61339	Ralph	154	” “
61351	61355	61346	61346	You	175	” he complained ; “
61406	61443	61398	61399	their mothers	1564	” Mary made no answer to this remark , but frowned . She leant back on the seat and looked about her at the great houses breaking the soft gray - blue sky with their chimneys . “
61448	61452	61398	61399	their mothers	1564	” she said , “
61481	61486	61474	61474	I	0	” Ralph sighed impatiently . “
61500	61512	61494	61494	you	1568	” she added , as if his disagreement had been spoken . “
61523	61527	61517	61517	I	0	” he replied . “
61547	61562	61517	61517	I	0	” He spoke without much vehemence of agreement or disagreement . He seemed chilled . “
61573	61583	61568	61568	You	154	” Mary cried , turning and pinching his sleeve . “
61603	61620	61568	61568	You	154	” As he merely shook his head , and filled his pipe , she went on : “
61633	61634	61568	61568	You	154	” “
61641	61645	61568	61568	You	154	” he said . “
61648	61652	61653	61653	I	0	” Mary remarked , “
61674	61688	61671	61672	a committee	1572	” She rose , but hesitated , looking down upon him rather gravely . “
61697	61701	61695	61695	Ralph	154	” she said . “
61711	61762	61763	61763	I	0	” He did not immediately answer her , but rose , too , and walked with her towards the gate . As usual , he did not speak to her without considering whether what he was about to say was the sort of thing that he could say to her . “
61768	61774	61763	61763	I	0	” he said at length . “
61804	61805	61793	61793	He	157	” “
61817	61997	61793	61793	He	157	” said Mary ; and they passed the gate , and walked slowly round the Fields again , discussing difficulties which , as a matter of fact , were more or less chronic in the Denham family , and only now brought forward to appease Mary ’s sympathy , which , however , soothed Ralph more than he was aware of . She made him at least dwell upon problems which were real in the sense that they were capable of solution ; and the true cause of his melancholy , which was not susceptible to such treatment , sank rather more deeply into the shades of his mind . Mary was attentive ; she was helpful . Ralph could not help feeling grateful to her , the more so , perhaps , because he had not told her the truth about his state ; and when they reached the gate again he wished to make some affectionate objection to her leaving him . But his affection took the rather uncouth form of expostulating with her about her work . “
62008	62012	61999	61999	d’you	1575	” he asked . “
62022	62023	62020	62020	Mary	175	” “
62038	62042	62024	62024	I	0	” she said . “
62046	62051	62024	62024	I	0	” she added suddenly , “
62071	62072	62055	62055	you	1576	” “
62079	62083	62055	62055	you	1576	” Ralph repeated . “
62100	62160	62094	62094	you	1576	” she said , rather hastily , and then started off in the direction of Russell Square . She had invited him on the impulse of the moment , as a vision of the country came before her ; and now she was annoyed with herself for having done so , and then she was annoyed at being annoyed . “
62175	62179	62162	62162	I	0	” she reasoned , “
62213	62465	62206	62206	he	154	” She shook her head . She really did not know what he had meant . She never felt quite certain ; but now she was more than usually baffled . Was he concealing something from her ? His manner had been odd ; his deep absorption had impressed her ; there was something in him that she had not fathomed , and the mystery of his nature laid more of a spell upon her than she liked . Moreover , she could not prevent herself from doing now what she had often blamed others of her sex for doing — from endowing her friend with a kind of heavenly fire , and passing her life before it for his sanction . Under this process , the committee rather dwindled in importance ; the Suffrage shrank ; she vowed she would work harder at the Italian language ; she thought she would take up the study of birds . But this program for a perfect life threatened to become so absurd that she very soon caught herself out in the evil habit , and was rehearsing her speech to the committee by the time the chestnut - colored bricks of Russell Square came in sight . Indeed , she never noticed them . She ran upstairs as usual , and was completely awakened to reality by the sight of Mrs. Seal , on the landing outside the office , inducing a very large dog to drink water out of a tumbler . “
62472	62481	62466	62467	Miss Markham	199	” Mrs. Seal remarked , with due solemnity , “
62488	62489	62466	62467	Miss Markham	199	” “
62497	62507	62526	62526	she	199	” said Mary , patting him on the head . “
62514	62519	62510	62512	A magnificent fellow	1582	” Mrs. Seal agreed . “
62589	62863	62864	62864	I	0	” and scattering the rest of the water indiscriminately over the floor , she hurried Mary into the committee - room . Mr. Clacton was in his glory . The machinery which he had perfected and controlled was now about to turn out its bi - monthly product , a committee meeting ; and his pride in the perfect structure of these assemblies was great . He loved the jargon of committee - rooms ; he loved the way in which the door kept opening as the clock struck the hour , in obedience to a few strokes of his pen on a piece of paper ; and when it had opened sufficiently often , he loved to issue from his inner chamber with documents in his hands , visibly important , with a preoccupied expression on his face that might have suited a Prime Minister advancing to meet his Cabinet . By his orders the table had been decorated beforehand with six sheets of blotting - paper , with six pens , six ink - pots , a tumbler and a jug of water , a bell , and , in deference to the taste of the lady members , a vase of hardy chrysanthemums . He had already surreptitiously straightened the sheets of blotting - paper in relation to the ink - pots , and now stood in front of the fire engaged in conversation with Miss Markham . But his eye was on the door , and when Mary and Mrs. Seal entered , he gave a little laugh and observed to the assembly which was scattered about the room : “
62878	63804	63805	63805	My	0	” So speaking , he took his seat at the head of the table , and arranging one bundle of papers upon his right and another upon his left , called upon Miss Datchet to read the minutes of the previous meeting . Mary obeyed . A keen observer might have wondered why it was necessary for the secretary to knit her brows so closely over the tolerably matter - of - fact statement before her . Could there be any doubt in her mind that it had been resolved to circularize the provinces with Leaflet No . 3 , or to issue a statistical diagram showing the proportion of married women to spinsters in New Zealand ; or that the net profits of Mrs. Hipsley ’s Bazaar had reached a total of five pounds eight shillings and twopence half - penny ? Could any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these statements be disturbing her ? No one could have guessed , from the look of her , that she was disturbed at all . A pleasanter and saner woman than Mary Datchet was never seen within a committee - room . She seemed a compound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine ; less poetically speaking , she showed both gentleness and strength , an indefinable promise of soft maternity blending with her evident fitness for honest labor . Nevertheless , she had great difficulty in reducing her mind to obedience ; and her reading lacked conviction , as if , as was indeed the case , she had lost the power of visualizing what she read . And directly the list was completed , her mind floated to Lincoln ’s Inn Fields and the fluttering wings of innumerable sparrows . Was Ralph still enticing the bald - headed cock - sparrow to sit upon his hand ? Had he succeeded ? Would he ever succeed ? She had meant to ask him why it is that the sparrows in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields are tamer than the sparrows in Hyde Park — perhaps it is that the passers - by are rarer , and they come to recognize their benefactors . For the first half - hour of the committee meeting , Mary had thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of Ralph Denham , who threatened to have it all his own way . Mary tried half a dozen methods of ousting him . She raised her voice , she articulated distinctly , she looked firmly at Mr. Clacton ’s bald head , she began to write a note . To her annoyance , her pencil drew a little round figure on the blotting - paper , which , she could not deny , was really a bald - headed cock - sparrow . She looked again at Mr. Clacton ; yes , he was bald , and so are cock - sparrows . Never was a secretary tormented by so many unsuitable suggestions , and they all came , alas ! with something ludicrously grotesque about them , which might , at any moment , provoke her to such flippancy as would shock her colleagues for ever . The thought of what she might say made her bite her lips , as if her lips would protect her . But all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to the surface by a more profound disturbance , which , as she could not consider it at present , manifested its existence by these grotesque nods and beckonings . Consider it , she must , when the committee was over . Meanwhile , she was behaving scandalously ; she was looking out of the window , and thinking of the color of the sky , and of the decorations on the Imperial Hotel , when she ought to have been shepherding her colleagues , and pinning them down to the matter in hand . She could not bring herself to attach more weight to one project than to another . Ralph had said — she could not stop to consider what he had said , but he had somehow divested the proceedings of all reality . And then , without conscious effort , by some trick of the brain , she found herself becoming interested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign . Certain articles were to be written ; certain editors approached . What line was it advisable to take ? She found herself strongly disapproving of what Mr. Clacton was saying . She committed herself to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard . Directly she had said this , she felt that she had turned upon Ralph ’s ghost ; and she became more and more in earnest , and anxious to bring the others round to her point of view . Once more , she knew exactly and indisputably what is right and what is wrong . As if emerging from a mist , the old foes of the public good loomed ahead of her — capitalists , newspaper proprietors , anti - suffragists , and , in some ways most pernicious of all , the masses who take no interest one way or another — among whom , for the time being , she certainly discerned the features of Ralph Denham . Indeed , when Miss Markham asked her to suggest the names of a few friends of hers , she expressed herself with unusual bitterness : “
63815	63828	63831	63831	they	1592	” She felt that she was really saying that to Ralph himself . “
63839	63969	63831	63831	they	1592	” said Miss Markham , with a little laugh ; and with renewed vigor their legions charged the foe . Mary ’s spirits had been low when she entered the committee - room ; but now they were considerably improved . She knew the ways of this world ; it was a shapely , orderly place ; she felt convinced of its right and its wrong ; and the feeling that she was fit to deal a heavy blow against her enemies warmed her heart and kindled her eye . In one of those flights of fancy , not characteristic of her but tiresomely frequent this afternoon , she envisaged herself battered with rotten eggs upon a platform , from which Ralph vainly begged her to descend . But — “
63979	64022	63831	63831	they	1592	” she said , and so on . Much to her credit , however teased by foolish fancies , she kept the surface of her brain moderate and vigilant , and subdued Mrs. Seal very tactfully more than once when she demanded , “
64026	64362	63831	63831	they	1592	” as became her father ’s daughter . The other members of the committee , who were all rather elderly people , were a good deal impressed by Mary , and inclined to side with her and against each other , partly , perhaps , because of her youth . The feeling that she controlled them all filled Mary with a sense of power ; and she felt that no work can equal in importance , or be so exciting as , the work of making other people do what you want them to do . Indeed , when she had won her point she felt a slight degree of contempt for the people who had yielded to her . The committee now rose , gathered together their papers , shook them straight , placed them in their attache - cases , snapped the locks firmly together , and hurried away , having , for the most part , to catch trains , in order to keep other appointments with other committees , for they were all busy people . Mary , Mrs. Seal , and Mr. Clacton were left alone ; the room was hot and untidy , the pieces of pink blotting - paper were lying at different angles upon the table , and the tumbler was half full of water , which some one had poured out and forgotten to drink . Mrs. Seal began preparing the tea , while Mr. Clacton retired to his room to file the fresh accumulation of documents . Mary was too much excited even to help Mrs. Seal with the cups and saucers . She flung up the window and stood by it , looking out . The street lamps were already lit ; and through the mist in the square one could see little figures hurrying across the road and along the pavement , on the farther side . In her absurd mood of lustful arrogance , Mary looked at the little figures and thought , “
64399	64409	64394	64394	I	0	” Then Mrs. Seal came and stood by her . “
64422	64456	64420	64420	Sally	200	” Mary asked , in rather a condescending tone of voice , feeling a sort of pity for the enthusiastic ineffective little woman . But Mrs. Seal paid no attention to the suggestion . “
64464	64507	64420	64420	Sally	200	” Mary asked , with a little laugh . Mrs. Seal drew a deep breath , restrained herself , and then burst out , looking out , too , upon Russell Square and Southampton Row , and at the passers - by , “
64550	64608	64638	64638	you	1599	” Mary knew herself to be very much wiser than Mrs. Seal , and when Mrs. Seal said anything , even if it was what Mary herself was feeling , she automatically thought of all that there was to be said against it . On this occasion her arrogant feeling that she could direct everybody dwindled away . “
64615	64630	64638	64638	you	1599	” she said , turning back from the window and pulling down the blind . “
64644	64671	64638	64638	you	1599	” she let fall , casually , as she sat down at the table . Surely Mrs. Seal must realize that Mary had been extraordinarily efficient ? “
64682	64705	64673	64673	we	1598	” said Sally , shaking her head impatiently . At this Mary burst out laughing , and all her arrogance was dissipated . “
64712	64723	64706	64706	You	1599	” said Sally , with another shake of her head , “
64757	64758	64736	64736	I	0	” “
64771	64777	64763	64763	you	1599	” said Mary , kindly . “
64786	64798	64818	64818	you	1599	” said Mrs. Seal , with a toss of her locks . “
64878	64938	64872	64872	they	1603	” She was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke , so that her sentences were more than usually broken apart . Mary could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like admiration . While she had been thinking about herself , Mrs. Seal had thought of nothing but her vision . “
64957	64976	64977	64977	My	0	” she said , rising and trying to take a plate of biscuits from Mrs. Seal ’s hands . “
64990	65005	64977	64977	My	0	” she exclaimed , clinging more tightly than before to her plate of biscuits . “
65106	65772	65098	65098	I	0	” They had their tea , and went over many of the points that had been raised in the committee rather more intimately than had been possible then ; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in some way behind the scenes ; of having their hands upon strings which , when pulled , would completely change the pageant exhibited daily to those who read the newspapers . Although their views were very different , this sense united them and made them almost cordial in their manners to each other . Mary , however , left the tea - party rather early , desiring both to be alone , and then to hear some music at the Queen ’s Hall . She fully intended to use her loneliness to think out her position with regard to Ralph ; but although she walked back to the Strand with this end in view , she found her mind uncomfortably full of different trains of thought . She started one and then another . They seemed even to take their color from the street she happened to be in . Thus the vision of humanity appeared to be in some way connected with Bloomsbury , and faded distinctly by the time she crossed the main road ; then a belated organ - grinder in Holborn set her thoughts dancing incongruously ; and by the time she was crossing the great misty square of Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , she was cold and depressed again , and horribly clear - sighted . The dark removed the stimulus of human companionship , and a tear actually slid down her cheek , accompanying a sudden conviction within her that she loved Ralph , and that he did n’t love her . All dark and empty now was the path where they had walked that morning , and the sparrows silent in the bare trees . But the lights in her own building soon cheered her ; all these different states of mind were submerged in the deep flood of desires , thoughts , perceptions , antagonisms , which washed perpetually at the base of her being , to rise into prominence in turn when the conditions of the upper world were favorable . She put off the hour of clear thought until Christmas , saying to herself , as she lit her fire , that it is impossible to think anything out in London ; and , no doubt , Ralph would n’t come at Christmas , and she would take long walks into the heart of the country , and decide this question and all the others that puzzled her . Meanwhile , she thought , drawing her feet up on to the fender , life was full of complexity ; life was a thing one must love to the last fiber of it . She had sat there for five minutes or so , and her thoughts had had time to grow dim , when there came a ring at her bell . Her eye brightened ; she felt immediately convinced that Ralph had come to visit her . Accordingly , she waited a moment before opening the door ; she wanted to feel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions which the sight of Ralph would certainly arouse . She composed herself unnecessarily , however , for she had to admit , not Ralph , but Katharine and William Rodney . Her first impression was that they were both extremely well dressed . She felt herself shabby and slovenly beside them , and did not know how she should entertain them , nor could she guess why they had come . She had heard nothing of their engagement . But after the first disappointment , she was pleased , for she felt instantly that Katharine was a personality , and , moreover , she need not now exercise her self - control . “
65789	65806	65785	65785	we	1607	” Katharine explained , standing and looking very tall and distinguished and rather absent - minded . “
65815	65819	65785	65785	we	1607	” said William . “
65824	65832	65822	65822	dear	1609	” he exclaimed , looking about him , “
65899	65968	65884	65885	Miss Datchet	175	” Sitting down , he drew off his light yellow gloves , and began slapping his knees with them . His vitality was pleasant , Mary thought , although he made her laugh . The very look of him was inclined to make her laugh . His rather prominent eyes passed from one young woman to the other , and his lips perpetually formed words which remained unspoken . “
65980	66025	65884	65885	Miss Datchet	175	” said Katharine , apparently paying no attention to William , and accepting a cigarette which Mary offered her . She leant back in her chair , and the smoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her still further from the others . “
66034	66038	66031	66032	Miss Datchet	175	” William continued , “
66093	66167	66170	66170	Mary	175	” Had they been quarreling , Mary wondered , and had they , for that reason , sought refuge in her room , or were they engaged , or had Katharine just refused him ? She was completely baffled . Katharine now reappeared from her veil of smoke , knocked the ash from her cigarette into the fireplace , and looked , with an odd expression of solicitude , at the irritable man . “
66172	66177	66170	66170	Mary	175	” she said tentatively , “
66233	66255	66231	66231	William	176	” She spoke with a kind of guarded gentleness . Mary , accordingly , retired to make preparations in the pantry . “
66264	66324	66325	66325	William	176	” she asked of her own reflection in the little looking - glass which hung there . She was not left to doubt much longer , for , on coming back into the sitting - room with the tea - things , Katharine informed her , apparently having been instructed so to do by William , of their engagement . “
66327	66331	66325	66325	William	176	” she said , “
66347	66382	66340	66340	We	1621	” Mary found herself shaking William ’s hand , and addressing her congratulations to him , as if Katharine were inaccessible ; she had , indeed , taken hold of the tea - kettle . “
66387	66391	66340	66340	We	1621	” Katharine said , “
66423	66719	66720	66720	Your	1622	” Mary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order to conceal nervousness , but if so , the concealment was unusually perfect . Talk of marriage was dismissed . Katharine might have been seated in her own drawing - room , controlling a situation which presented no sort of difficulty to her trained mind . Rather to her surprise , Mary found herself making conversation with William about old Italian pictures , while Katharine poured out tea , cut cake , kept William ’s plate supplied , without joining more than was necessary in the conversation . She seemed to have taken possession of Mary ’s room , and to handle the cups as if they belonged to her . But it was done so naturally that it bred no resentment in Mary ; on the contrary , she found herself putting her hand on Katharine ’s knee , affectionately , for an instant . Was there something maternal in this assumption of control ? And thinking of Katharine as one who would soon be married , these maternal airs filled Mary ’s mind with a new tenderness , and even with awe . Katharine seemed very much older and more experienced than she was . Meanwhile Rodney talked . If his appearance was superficially against him , it had the advantage of making his solid merits something of a surprise . He had kept notebooks ; he knew a great deal about pictures . He could compare different examples in different galleries , and his authoritative answers to intelligent questions gained not a little , Mary felt , from the smart taps which he dealt , as he delivered them , upon the lumps of coal . She was impressed . “
66725	66803	66807	66807	William	176	” said Katharine gently . He paused , gulped it down , obediently , and continued . And then it struck Mary that Katharine , in the shade of her broad - brimmed hat , and in the midst of the smoke , and in the obscurity of her character , was , perhaps , smiling to herself , not altogether in the maternal spirit . What she said was very simple , but her words , even “
66809	66897	66807	66807	William	176	” were set down as gently and cautiously and exactly as the feet of a Persian cat stepping among China ornaments . For the second time that day Mary felt herself baffled by something inscrutable in the character of a person to whom she felt herself much attracted . She thought that if she were engaged to Katharine , she , too , would find herself very soon using those fretful questions with which William evidently teased his bride . And yet Katharine ’s voice was humble . “
66915	66919	66901	66901	you	176	” she asked . “
66927	66941	66922	66922	I	0	” William answered , delighted , Mary guessed , at this little compliment . “
67046	67054	67063	67064	Miss Datchet	175	” he explained , turning to Mary , “
67098	67132	67089	67089	she	129	” and he gave his queer little chuckle . Somehow this compliment appeared very old - fashioned and almost in bad taste . Mary actually felt herself blush , as if he had said “
67135	67137	67089	67089	she	129	” or “
67141	67156	67157	67157	She	129	” Constrained , perhaps , by nervousness , Rodney continued in the same vein . “
67198	67199	67196	67196	Katharine	129	” “
67204	67215	67196	67196	Katharine	129	” said Katharine , apparently waking from a brown study . “
67224	67225	67196	67196	Katharine	129	” “
67246	67252	67253	67253	D’you	1635	” said Rodney , rising . “
67266	67279	67261	67261	They	282	” he added , for her information , as she looked doubtful . “
67300	67301	67302	67302	I	0	” “
67317	67321	67311	67311	she	129	” said Katharine . “
67325	67336	67311	67311	she	129	” she added , as if to qualify her abruptness , “
67346	67347	67337	67337	I	0	” “
67370	67385	67360	67360	I	0	” he said , turning to Mary , as he had frequently done already . “

67454	67455	67447	67447	she	129	” “
67463	67467	67459	67459	I	0	” Katharine apologized . “
67485	67569	67479	67479	you	1637	” The rest of her excuse was cut short , so far as Mary was concerned , by the closing of the door . She fancied she could hear William finding fresh fault on the stairs . A moment later , the door - bell rang again , and Katharine reappeared , having left her purse on a chair . She soon found it , and said , pausing for a moment at the door , and speaking differently as they were alone : “
67581	69128	67479	67479	you	1637	” She shook her purse in her hand until the coins jingled , as if she alluded merely to this example of her forgetfulness . But the remark puzzled Mary ; it seemed to refer to something else ; and her manner had changed so strangely , now that William was out of hearing , that she could not help looking at her for an explanation . She looked almost stern , so that Mary , trying to smile at her , only succeeded in producing a silent stare of interrogation . As the door shut for the second time , she sank on to the floor in front of the fire , trying , now that their bodies were not there to distract her , to piece together her impressions of them as a whole . And , though priding herself , with all other men and women , upon an infallible eye for character , she could not feel at all certain that she knew what motives inspired Katharine Hilbery in life . There was something that carried her on smoothly , out of reach — something , yes , but what?—something that reminded Mary of Ralph . Oddly enough , he gave her the same feeling , too , and with him , too , she felt baffled . Oddly enough , for no two people , she hastily concluded , were more unlike . And yet both had this hidden impulse , this incalculable force — this thing they cared for and did n’t talk about — oh , what was it ? The village of Disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of cultivated ground in the neighborhood of Lincoln , not so far inland but that a sound , bringing rumors of the sea , can be heard on summer nights or when the winter storms fling the waves upon the long beach . So large is the church , and in particular the church tower , in comparison with the little street of cottages which compose the village , that the traveler is apt to cast his mind back to the Middle Ages , as the only time when so much piety could have been kept alive . So great a trust in the Church can surely not belong to our day , and he goes on to conjecture that every one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human life . Such are the reflections of the superficial stranger , and his sight of the population , as it is represented by two or three men hoeing in a turnip - field , a small child carrying a jug , and a young woman shaking a piece of carpet outside her cottage door , will not lead him to see anything very much out of keeping with the Middle Ages in the village of Disham as it is to - day . These people , though they seem young enough , look so angular and so crude that they remind him of the little pictures painted by monks in the capital letters of their manuscripts . He only half understands what they say , and speaks very loud and clearly , as though , indeed , his voice had to carry through a hundred years or more before it reached them . He would have a far better chance of understanding some dweller in Paris or Rome , Berlin or Madrid , than these countrymen of his who have lived for the last two thousand years not two hundred miles from the City of London . The Rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village . It is a large house , and has been growing steadily for some centuries round the great kitchen , with its narrow red tiles , as the Rector would point out to his guests on the first night of their arrival , taking his brass candlestick , and bidding them mind the steps up and the steps down , and notice the immense thickness of the walls , the old beams across the ceiling , the staircases as steep as ladders , and the attics , with their deep , tent - like roofs , in which swallows bred , and once a white owl . But nothing very interesting or very beautiful had resulted from the different additions made by the different rectors . The house , however , was surrounded by a garden , in which the Rector took considerable pride . The lawn , which fronted the drawing - room windows , was a rich and uniform green , unspotted by a single daisy , and on the other side of it two straight paths led past beds of tall , standing flowers to a charming grassy walk , where the Rev. Wyndham Datchet would pace up and down at the same hour every morning , with a sundial to measure the time for him . As often as not , he carried a book in his hand , into which he would glance , then shut it up , and repeat the rest of the ode from memory . He had most of Horace by heart , and had got into the habit of connecting this particular walk with certain odes which he repeated duly , at the same time noting the condition of his flowers , and stooping now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown . On wet days , such was the power of habit over him , he rose from his chair at the same hour , and paced his study for the same length of time , pausing now and then to straighten some book in the bookcase , or alter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing upon cairns of serpentine stone upon the mantelpiece . His children had a great respect for him , credited him with far more learning than he actually possessed , and saw that his habits were not interfered with , if possible . Like most people who do things methodically , the Rector himself had more strength of purpose and power of self - sacrifice than of intellect or of originality . On cold and windy nights he rode off to visit sick people , who might need him , without a murmur ; and by virtue of doing dull duties punctually , he was much employed upon committees and local Boards and Councils ; and at this period of his life ( he was sixty - eight ) he was beginning to be commiserated by tender old ladies for the extreme leanness of his person , which , they said , was worn out upon the roads when it should have been resting before a comfortable fire . His elder daughter , Elizabeth , lived with him and managed the house , and already much resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical habit of mind ; of the two sons one , Richard , was an estate agent , the other , Christopher , was reading for the Bar . At Christmas , naturally , they met together ; and for a month past the arrangement of the Christmas week had been much in the mind of mistress and maid , who prided themselves every year more confidently upon the excellence of their equipment . The late Mrs. Datchet had left an excellent cupboard of linen , to which Elizabeth had succeeded at the age of nineteen , when her mother died , and the charge of the family rested upon the shoulders of the eldest daughter . She kept a fine flock of yellow chickens , sketched a little , certain rose - trees in the garden were committed specially to her care ; and what with the care of the house , the care of the chickens , and the care of the poor , she scarcely knew what it was to have an idle minute . An extreme rectitude of mind , rather than any gift , gave her weight in the family . When Mary wrote to say that she had asked Ralph Denham to stay with them , she added , out of deference to Elizabeth ’s character , that he was very nice , though rather queer , and had been overworking himself in London . No doubt Elizabeth would conclude that Ralph was in love with her , but there could be no doubt either that not a word of this would be spoken by either of them , unless , indeed , some catastrophe made mention of it unavoidable . Mary went down to Disham without knowing whether Ralph intended to come ; but two or three days before Christmas she received a telegram from Ralph , asking her to take a room for him in the village . This was followed by a letter explaining that he hoped he might have his meals with them ; but quiet , essential for his work , made it necessary to sleep out . Mary was walking in the garden with Elizabeth , and inspecting the roses , when the letter arrived . “
69134	69147	67479	67479	you	1637	” said Elizabeth decidedly , when the plan was explained to her . “
69184	69185	69174	69174	he	1644	” “
69199	69249	69188	69188	he	1644	” Mary thought to herself , although outwardly she assented , and felt grateful to Elizabeth for supporting her in what was , of course , her desire . They were cutting roses at the time , and laying them , head by head , in a shallow basket . “
69262	69372	69255	69255	he	1644	” Mary thought , with a little shiver of irritation , which led her to place her rose the wrong way in the basket . Meanwhile , they had come to the end of the path , and while Elizabeth straightened some flowers , and made them stand upright within their fence of string , Mary looked at her father , who was pacing up and down , with his hand behind his back and his head bowed in meditation . Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching , Mary stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm . “
69381	69389	69379	69379	father	3311	” she said , presenting a rose . “
69394	69421	69379	69379	father	3311	” said Mr. Datchet , taking the flower , and holding it at an angle which suited his bad eyesight , without pausing in his walk . “
69460	69514	69442	69442	Elizabeth	285	” He had a habit , Mary remarked , and she had never noticed it so clearly before , of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous murmur , whereupon he passed into a state of abstraction , presumed by his children to indicate some train of thought too profound for utterance . “
69517	69593	69442	69442	Elizabeth	285	” said Mary , interrupting , for the first time in her life , perhaps , when the murmur ceased . He made no reply . She knew very well that he wished to be left alone , but she stuck to his side much as she might have stuck to some sleep - walker , whom she thought it right gradually to awaken . She could think of nothing to rouse him with except : “
69603	69604	69601	69601	father	3311	” “
69611	69653	69601	69601	father	3311	” said Mr. Datchet , running his words together in the same abstracted manner , and sinking his head yet lower upon his breast . And suddenly , as they turned their steps to retrace their way , he jerked out : “
69717	69720	69706	69706	You	3311	” She said “
69723	70336	69706	69706	You	3311	” as he seemed to wish for a reply , and then he looked at his watch , and made off down the path towards the house , holding the rose at the same angle in front of him . Elizabeth had gone round to the side of the house , where the chickens lived , so that Mary found herself alone , holding Ralph ’s letter in her hand . She was uneasy . She had put off the season for thinking things out very successfully , and now that Ralph was actually coming , the next day , she could only wonder how her family would impress him . She thought it likely that her father would discuss the train service with him ; Elizabeth would be bright and sensible , and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants . Her brothers had already said that they would give him a day ’s shooting . She was content to leave the problem of Ralph ’s relations to the young men obscure , trusting that they would find some common ground of masculine agreement . But what would he think of her ? Would he see that she was different from the rest of the family ? She devised a plan for taking him to her sitting - room , and artfully leading the talk towards the English poets , who now occupied prominent places in her little bookcase . Moreover , she might give him to understand , privately , that she , too , thought her family a queer one — queer , yes , but not dull . That was the rock past which she was bent on steering him . And she thought how she would draw his attention to Edward ’s passion for Jorrocks , and the enthusiasm which led Christopher to collect moths and butterflies though he was now twenty - two . Perhaps Elizabeth ’s sketching , if the fruits were invisible , might lend color to the general effect which she wished to produce of a family , eccentric and limited , perhaps , but not dull . Edward , she perceived , was rolling the lawn , for the sake of exercise ; and the sight of him , with pink cheeks , bright little brown eyes , and a general resemblance to a clumsy young cart - horse in its winter coat of dusty brown hair , made Mary violently ashamed of her ambitious scheming . She loved him precisely as he was ; she loved them all ; and as she walked by his side , up and down , and down and up , her strong moral sense administered a sound drubbing to the vain and romantic element aroused in her by the mere thought of Ralph . She felt quite certain that , for good or for bad , she was very like the rest of her family . Sitting in the corner of a third - class railway carriage , on the afternoon of the following day , Ralph made several inquiries of a commercial traveler in the opposite corner . They centered round a village called Lampsher , not three miles , he understood , from Lincoln ; was there a big house in Lampsher , he asked , inhabited by a gentleman of the name of Otway ? The traveler knew nothing , but rolled the name of Otway on his tongue , reflectively , and the sound of it gratified Ralph amazingly . It gave him an excuse to take a letter from his pocket in order to verify the address . “
70344	70349	70350	70350	You	1659	” he read out . “
70360	70380	70353	70353	somebody	896	” said the man ; and Ralph had to confess that he was not bound there this very evening . “
70390	71266	70381	70381	I	0	” he said , and in the heart of him could not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived from making a bagman in a train believe what he himself did not believe . For the letter , though signed by Katharine ’s father , contained no invitation or warrant for thinking that Katharine herself was there ; the only fact it disclosed was that for a fortnight this address would be Mr. Hilbery ’s address . But when he looked out of the window , it was of her he thought ; she , too , had seen these gray fields , and , perhaps , she was there where the trees ran up a slope , and one yellow light shone now , and then went out again , at the foot of the hill . The light shone in the windows of an old gray house , he thought . He lay back in his corner and forgot the commercial traveler altogether . The process of visualizing Katharine stopped short at the old gray manor - house ; instinct warned him that if he went much further with this process reality would soon force itself in ; he could not altogether neglect the figure of William Rodney . Since the day when he had heard from Katharine ’s lips of her engagement , he had refrained from investing his dream of her with the details of real life . But the light of the late afternoon glowed green behind the straight trees , and became a symbol of her . The light seemed to expand his heart . She brooded over the gray fields , and was with him now in the railway carriage , thoughtful , silent , and infinitely tender ; but the vision pressed too close , and must be dismissed , for the train was slackening . Its abrupt jerks shook him wide awake , and he saw Mary Datchet , a sturdy russet figure , with a dash of scarlet about it , as the carriage slid down the platform . A tall youth who accompanied her shook him by the hand , took his bag , and led the way without uttering one articulate word . Never are voices so beautiful as on a winter ’s evening , when dusk almost hides the body , and they seem to issue from nothingness with a note of intimacy seldom heard by day . Such an edge was there in Mary ’s voice when she greeted him . About her seemed to hang the mist of the winter hedges , and the clear red of the bramble leaves . He felt himself at once stepping on to the firm ground of an entirely different world , but he did not allow himself to yield to the pleasure of it directly . They gave him his choice of driving with Edward or of walking home across the fields with Mary — not a shorter way , they explained , but Mary thought it a nicer way . He decided to walk with her , being conscious , indeed , that he got comfort from her presence . What could be the cause of her cheerfulness , he wondered , half ironically , and half enviously , as the pony - cart started briskly away , and the dusk swam between their eyes and the tall form of Edward , standing up to drive , with the reins in one hand and the whip in the other . People from the village , who had been to the market town , were climbing into their gigs , or setting off home down the road together in little parties . Many salutations were addressed to Mary , who shouted back , with the addition of the speaker ’s name . But soon she led the way over a stile , and along a path worn slightly darker than the dim green surrounding it . In front of them the sky now showed itself of a reddish - yellow , like a slice of some semilucent stone behind which a lamp burnt , while a fringe of black trees with distinct branches stood against the light , which was obscured in one direction by a hump of earth , in all other directions the land lying flat to the very verge of the sky . One of the swift and noiseless birds of the winter ’s night seemed to follow them across the field , circling a few feet in front of them , disappearing and returning again and again . Mary had gone this walk many hundred times in the course of her life , generally alone , and at different stages the ghosts of past moods would flood her mind with a whole scene or train of thought merely at the sight of three trees from a particular angle , or at the sound of the pheasant clucking in the ditch . But to - night the circumstances were strong enough to oust all other scenes ; and she looked at the field and the trees with an involuntary intensity as if they had no such associations for her . “
71271	71275	71269	71269	Ralph	154	” she said , “
71327	71328	71321	71321	I	0	” “
71336	71340	71332	71332	you	0	” said Ralph . “
71352	71353	71354	71354	You	154	” “
71363	71368	71354	71354	You	154	” she said boldly . “
71387	71388	71385	71385	you	154	” “
71399	71460	71393	71393	I	0	” he said sturdily . They walked on in silence ; Mary took care not to break it for a time . She wished Ralph to feel , as she thought he would , all the fresh delights of the earth and air . She was right . In a moment he expressed his pleasure , much to her comfort . “
71476	71493	71474	71474	Mary	175	” he said , pushing his hat back on his head , and looking about him . “
71502	71526	71497	71498	No gentlemen	1666	” He snuffed the air , and felt more keenly than he had done for many weeks the pleasure of owning a body . “
71538	71565	71497	71498	No gentlemen	1666	” said Mary . In the gap of the hedge Ralph tore up a poacher ’s wire , set across a hole to trap a rabbit . “
71575	71586	71571	71571	they	1668	” said Mary , watching him tugging at the wire . “
71620	71654	71655	71655	I	0	” she repeated , coming out on the other side of the hedge , and running her fingers through her hair to rid herself of a bramble which had attached itself to her . “
71666	71667	71669	71669	you	0	” “
71671	71675	71669	71669	you	0	” said Ralph . “
71683	71687	71676	71676	I	0	” he added . “
71714	71727	71676	71676	I	0	” said Mary , with a soberness which impressed Ralph very much . “
71736	71740	71729	71729	you	0	” he urged . “
71756	71791	71741	71741	I	0	” she replied . The idea of a cottage where one grew one ’s own vegetables and lived on fifteen shillings a week , filled Ralph with an extraordinary sense of rest and satisfaction . “
71827	71828	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” “
71843	71844	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” “
71851	71858	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” he asked , attempting sarcasm . “
71872	71974	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” she replied , in an off - hand manner which was slightly mysterious . Ralph fell silent . It annoyed him that she should have plans of which he knew nothing ; but he felt that he had no right to press her further . His mind settled upon the idea of life in a country cottage . Conceivably , for he could not examine into it now , here lay a tremendous possibility ; a solution of many problems . He struck his stick upon the earth , and stared through the dusk at the shape of the country . “
71983	71987	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” he asked . “
71993	71997	71848	71849	the Suffrage	294	” said Mary . “
72007	72023	72005	72005	you	0	” She then told him exactly where the north lay , and where the south . “
72032	72036	72037	72037	I	0	” she said . “
72046	72199	72040	72040	my	0	” As if to prove this boast , she walked a little quicker , so that Ralph found it difficult to keep pace with her . At the same time , he felt drawn to her as he had never been before ; partly , no doubt , because she was more independent of him than in London , and seemed to be attached firmly to a world where he had no place at all . Now the dusk had fallen to such an extent that he had to follow her implicitly , and even lean his hand on her shoulder when they jumped a bank into a very narrow lane . And he felt curiously shy of her when she began to shout through her hands at a spot of light which swung upon the mist in a neighboring field . He shouted , too , and the light stood still . “
72215	72551	72202	72202	Christopher	202	” she said . She introduced him to Ralph , who could see only a tall figure in gaiters , rising from a fluttering circle of soft feathery bodies , upon whom the light fell in wavering discs , calling out now a bright spot of yellow , now one of greenish - black and scarlet . Mary dipped her hand in the bucket he carried , and was at once the center of a circle also ; and as she cast her grain she talked alternately to the birds and to her brother , in the same clucking , half - inarticulate voice , as it sounded to Ralph , standing on the outskirts of the fluttering feathers in his black overcoat . He had removed his overcoat by the time they sat round the dinner - table , but nevertheless he looked very strange among the others . A country life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which Mary hesitated to call either innocent or youthful , as she compared them , now sitting round in an oval , softly illuminated by candlelight ; and yet it was something of the kind , yes , even in the case of the Rector himself . Though superficially marked with lines , his face was a clear pink , and his blue eyes had the long - sighted , peaceful expression of eyes seeking the turn of the road , or a distant light through rain , or the darkness of winter . She looked at Ralph . He had never appeared to her more concentrated and full of purpose ; as if behind his forehead were massed so much experience that he could choose for himself which part of it he would display and which part he would keep to himself . Compared with that dark and stern countenance , her brothers ’ faces , bending low over their soup - plates , were mere circles of pink , unmolded flesh . “
72561	72591	72558	72559	Mr. Denham	131	” said the Reverend Wyndham Datchet , tucking his napkin into his collar , so that almost the whole of his body was concealed by a large white diamond . “
72648	72838	72631	72631	they	1687	” The old gentleman had been roused agreeably by the presence of this attentive and well - informed young man , as was evident by the care with which he finished the last words in his sentences , and his slight exaggeration in the number of trucks on the trains . Indeed , the chief burden of the talk fell upon him , and he sustained it to - night in a manner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then ; for they felt shy of Denham , and were glad not to have to talk themselves . The store of information about the present and past of this particular corner of Lincolnshire which old Mr. Datchet produced really surprised his children , for though they knew of its existence , they had forgotten its extent , as they might have forgotten the amount of family plate stored in the plate - chest , until some rare celebration brought it forth . After dinner , parish business took the Rector to his study , and Mary proposed that they should sit in the kitchen . “
72846	72855	72631	72631	they	1687	” Elizabeth hastened to explain to her guest , “
72862	72863	72857	72857	we	1690	” “
72873	72877	72857	72857	we	1690	” said Edward . “
72898	72919	72926	72926	Christopher	202	” said Elizabeth , leading the way , with a tall brass candlestick in her hand , down a passage . “
72974	73218	72968	72968	they	1695	” She , too , felt an impulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks , as her father had exaggerated the number of trucks . A big lamp hung down from the center of the ceiling and , together with a fine log fire , illuminated a large and lofty room , with rafters running from wall to wall , a floor of red tiles , and a substantial fireplace built up of those narrow red bricks which were said to be five hundred years old . A few rugs and a sprinkling of arm - chairs had made this ancient kitchen into a sitting - room . Elizabeth , after pointing out the gun - racks , and the hooks for smoking hams , and other evidence of incontestable age , and explaining that Mary had had the idea of turning the room into a sitting - room — otherwise it was used for hanging out the wash and for the men to change in after shooting — considered that she had done her duty as hostess , and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp , beside a very long and narrow oak table . She placed a pair of horn spectacles upon her nose , and drew towards her a basketful of threads and wools . In a few minutes a smile came to her face , and remained there for the rest of the evening . “
73230	73251	73220	73220	you	1698	” said Christopher , who had , on the whole , formed a favorable impression of his sister ’s friend . “
73264	73268	73258	73258	I	0	” said Ralph . “
73276	73289	73271	73271	you	1698	” asked Edward , whose suspicions were not yet laid to rest . “
73298	73322	73290	73290	I	0	” said Ralph , turning and looking him in the face , because he was not sure how this confession would be received . “
73335	73339	73323	73323	You	1698	” said Christopher . “
73353	73354	73343	73343	you	1698	” “
73360	73368	73355	73355	I	0	” Ralph replied , with a smile . “
73379	73383	73369	73369	I	0	” said Edward , “
73443	73444	73426	73427	this man	1705	” “
73454	73655	73426	73427	this man	1705	” Ralph replied . They were all gratified by this praise of their native county ; and Mary now had the pleasure of hearing these short questions and answers lose their undertone of suspicious inspection , so far as her brothers were concerned , and develop into a genuine conversation about the habits of birds which afterwards turned to a discussion as to the habits of solicitors , in which it was scarcely necessary for her to take part . She was pleased to see that her brothers liked Ralph , to the extent , that is , of wishing to secure his good opinion . Whether or not he liked them it was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner . Now and then she fed the fire with a fresh log , and as the room filled with the fine , dry heat of burning wood , they all , with the exception of Elizabeth , who was outside the range of the fire , felt less and less anxious about the effect they were making , and more and more inclined for sleep . At this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the door . “
73665	73669	73658	73658	damn!—I	1709	” murmured Christopher . “
73679	73683	73677	73677	Pitch	298	” Edward grunted . “
73695	73733	73688	73688	I	0	” Christopher grumbled . He let in the dog , and stood for a moment by the door , which opened into the garden , to revive himself with a draught of the black , starlit air . “
73742	73752	73688	73688	I	0	” Mary cried , half turning in her chair . “
73763	73862	73863	73863	I	0	” said Christopher with complacency , and he sat himself on the floor at her feet , and leant his back against her knees , and stretched out his long stockinged legs to the fire — all signs that he felt no longer any restraint at the presence of the stranger . He was the youngest of the family , and Mary ’s favorite , partly because his character resembled hers , as Edward ’s character resembled Elizabeth ’s . She made her knees a comfortable rest for his head , and ran her fingers through his hair . “
73874	74766	73866	73866	Mary	175	” Ralph thought to himself suddenly , and he looked at Christopher , almost affectionately , for calling forth his sister ’s caresses . Instantly he thought of Katharine , the thought of her being surrounded by the spaces of night and the open air ; and Mary , watching him , saw the lines upon his forehead suddenly deepen . He stretched out an arm and placed a log upon the fire , constraining himself to fit it carefully into the frail red scaffolding , and also to limit his thoughts to this one room . Mary had ceased to stroke her brother ’s head ; he moved it impatiently between her knees , and , much as though he were a child , she began once more to part the thick , reddish - colored locks this way and that . But a far stronger passion had taken possession of her soul than any her brother could inspire in her , and , seeing Ralph ’s change of expression , her hand almost automatically continued its movements , while her mind plunged desperately for some hold upon slippery banks . Into that same black night , almost , indeed , into the very same layer of starlit air , Katharine Hilbery was now gazing , although not with a view to the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow . She was walking up and down a gravel path in the garden of Stogdon House , her sight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless hoops of a pergola . Thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure Cassiopeia , or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the Milky Way . At the end of the pergola , however , there was a stone seat , from which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly interruption , save to the right , indeed , where a line of elm - trees was beautifully sprinkled with stars , and a low stable building had a full drop of quivering silver just issuing from the mouth of the chimney . It was a moonless night , but the light of the stars was sufficient to show the outline of the young woman ’s form , and the shape of her face gazing gravely , indeed almost sternly , into the sky . She had come out into the winter ’s night , which was mild enough , not so much to look with scientific eyes upon the stars , as to shake herself free from certain purely terrestrial discontents . Much as a literary person in like circumstances would begin , absent - mindedly , pulling out volume after volume , so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at hand , even though she did not look at them . Not to be happy , when she was supposed to be happier than she would ever be again — that , as far as she could see , was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as soon as she arrived , two days before , and seemed now so intolerable that she had left the family party , and come out here to consider it by herself . It was not she who thought herself unhappy , but her cousins , who thought it for her . The house was full of cousins , much of her age , or even younger , and among them they had some terribly bright eyes . They seemed always on the search for something between her and Rodney , which they expected to find , and yet did not find ; and when they searched , Katharine became aware of wanting what she had not been conscious of wanting in London , alone with William and her parents . Or , if she did not want it , she missed it . And this state of mind depressed her , because she had been accustomed always to give complete satisfaction , and her self - love was now a little ruffled . She would have liked to break through the reserve habitual to her in order to justify her engagement to some one whose opinion she valued . No one had spoken a word of criticism , but they left her alone with William ; not that that would have mattered , if they had not left her alone so politely ; and , perhaps , that would not have mattered if they had not seemed so queerly silent , almost respectful , in her presence , which gave way to criticism , she felt , out of it . Looking now and then at the sky , she went through the list of her cousins ’ names : Eleanor , Humphrey , Marmaduke , Silvia , Henry , Cassandra , Gilbert , and Mostyn — Henry , the cousin who taught the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin , was the only one in whom she could confide , and as she walked up and down beneath the hoops of the pergola , she did begin a little speech to him , which ran something like this : “
74911	74940	74898	74898	I	0	” Here , presumably , she imagined that her cousin , who had listened with his usual intelligent sympathy , raised his eyebrows a little , and interposed : “
74951	74972	74973	74973	I	0	” Even in this purely imaginary dialogue , Katharine found it difficult to confide her ambition to an imaginary companion . “
74977	75000	74973	74973	I	0	” she began , and hesitated quite a long time before she forced herself to add , with a change of voice , “
75011	75058	75059	75059	I	0	” Henry was clearly amazed , but too kind to express all his doubts ; he only said something about the difficulties of mathematics , and remarked that very little was known about the stars . Katharine thereupon went on with the statement of her case . “
75183	76276	76277	76277	You	1724	” Having reached this point , instinct told her that she had passed beyond the region in which Henry ’s advice could be of any good ; and , having rid her mind of its superficial annoyance , she sat herself upon the stone seat , raised her eyes unconsciously and thought about the deeper questions which she had to decide , she knew , for herself . Would she , indeed , give William all he wanted ? In order to decide the question , she ran her mind rapidly over her little collection of significant sayings , looks , compliments , gestures , which had marked their intercourse during the last day or two . He had been annoyed because a box , containing some clothes specially chosen by him for her to wear , had been taken to the wrong station , owing to her neglect in the matter of labels . The box had arrived in the nick of time , and he had remarked , as she came downstairs on the first night , that he had never seen her look more beautiful . She outshone all her cousins . He had discovered that she never made an ugly movement ; he also said that the shape of her head made it possible for her , unlike most women , to wear her hair low . He had twice reproved her for being silent at dinner ; and once for never attending to what he said . He had been surprised at the excellence of her French accent , but he thought it was selfish of her not to go with her mother to call upon the Middletons , because they were old family friends and very nice people . On the whole , the balance was nearly even ; and , writing down a kind of conclusion in her mind which finished the sum for the present , at least , she changed the focus of her eyes , and saw nothing but the stars . To - night they seemed fixed with unusual firmness in the blue , and flashed back such a ripple of light into her eyes that she found herself thinking that to - night the stars were happy . Without knowing or caring more for Church practices than most people of her age , Katharine could not look into the sky at Christmas time without feeling that , at this one season , the Heavens bend over the earth with sympathy , and signal with immortal radiance that they , too , take part in her festival . Somehow , it seemed to her that they were even now beholding the procession of kings and wise men upon some road on a distant part of the earth . And yet , after gazing for another second , the stars did their usual work upon the mind , froze to cinders the whole of our short human history , and reduced the human body to an ape - like , furry form , crouching amid the brushwood of a barbarous clod of mud . This stage was soon succeeded by another , in which there was nothing in the universe save stars and the light of stars ; as she looked up the pupils of her eyes so dilated with starlight that the whole of her seemed dissolved in silver and spilt over the ledges of the stars for ever and ever indefinitely through space . Somehow simultaneously , though incongruously , she was riding with the magnanimous hero upon the shore or under forest trees , and so might have continued were it not for the rebuke forcibly administered by the body , which , content with the normal conditions of life , in no way furthers any attempt on the part of the mind to alter them . She grew cold , shook herself , rose , and walked towards the house . By the light of the stars , Stogdon House looked pale and romantic , and about twice its natural size . Built by a retired admiral in the early years of the nineteenth century , the curving bow windows of the front , now filled with reddish - yellow light , suggested a portly three - decker , sailing seas where those dolphins and narwhals who disport themselves upon the edges of old maps were scattered with an impartial hand . A semicircular flight of shallow steps led to a very large door , which Katharine had left ajar . She hesitated , cast her eyes over the front of the house , marked that a light burnt in one small window upon an upper floor , and pushed the door open . For a moment she stood in the square hall , among many horned skulls , sallow globes , cracked oil - paintings , and stuffed owls , hesitating , it seemed , whether she should open the door on her right , through which the stir of life reached her ears . Listening for a moment , she heard a sound which decided her , apparently , not to enter ; her uncle , Sir Francis , was playing his nightly game of whist ; it appeared probable that he was losing . She went up the curving stairway , which represented the one attempt at ceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion , and down a narrow passage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the garden . Knocking , she was told to come in . A young man , Henry Otway , was reading , with his feet on the fender . He had a fine head , the brow arched in the Elizabethan manner , but the gentle , honest eyes were rather skeptical than glowing with the Elizabethan vigor . He gave the impression that he had not yet found the cause which suited his temperament . He turned , put down his book , and looked at her . He noticed her rather pale , dew - drenched look , as of one whose mind is not altogether settled in the body . He had often laid his difficulties before her , and guessed , in some ways hoped , that perhaps she now had need of him . At the same time , she carried on her life with such independence that he scarcely expected any confidence to be expressed in words . “
76285	76307	76277	76277	You	1724	” he said , looking at her cloak . Katharine had forgotten to remove this token of her star - gazing . “
76310	76314	76277	76277	You	1724	” she asked . “
76341	76342	76335	76335	I	0	” “
76350	76403	76335	76335	I	0	” Henry inquired , placing coal on the fire , drawing a chair up to the grate , and laying aside her cloak . Her indifference to such details often forced Henry to act the part generally taken by women in such dealings . It was one of the ties between them . “
76409	76413	76407	76407	Henry	307	” she said . “
76420	76421	76414	76414	I	0	” “
76432	76436	76427	76427	I	0	” he replied . “
76479	76480	76468	76468	I	0	” “
76485	76493	76482	76482	I	0	” Katharine began , and stopped short . “
76503	76511	76494	76494	I	0	” she added briefly , and sighed . “
76516	76750	76494	76494	I	0	” he agreed ; and they both fell silent . Her sigh made him look at her . Should he venture to ask her why she sighed ? Was her reticence about her own affairs as inviolable as it had often been convenient for rather an egoistical young man to think it ? But since her engagement to Rodney , Henry ’s feeling towards her had become rather complex ; equally divided between an impulse to hurt her and an impulse to be tender to her ; and all the time he suffered a curious irritation from the sense that she was drifting away from him for ever upon unknown seas . On her side , directly Katharine got into his presence , and the sense of the stars dropped from her , she knew that any intercourse between people is extremely partial ; from the whole mass of her feelings , only one or two could be selected for Henry ’s inspection , and therefore she sighed . Then she looked at him , and their eyes meeting , much more seemed to be in common between them than had appeared possible . At any rate they had a grandfather in common ; at any rate there was a kind of loyalty between them sometimes found between relations who have no other cause to like each other , as these two had . “
76761	76771	76772	76772	I	0	” said Henry , the malicious mood now predominating . “
76779	76783	76772	76772	I	0	” she replied . “
76787	76791	76792	76792	We	1730	” he asked . “
76804	76805	76797	76797	I	0	” “
76811	76875	76797	76797	I	0	” he observed , stealing another look at her . She lay back in her arm - chair , her feet high upon the side of the grate , and in front of her , presumably to screen her eyes , she held a newspaper from which she picked up a sentence or two now and again . Observing this , Henry remarked : “
76884	76911	76797	76797	I	0	” At this she lowered the newspaper an inch or two , but said nothing . Indeed , she sat quite silent for over a minute . “
76933	76938	76939	76939	I	0	” she said suddenly . “
76952	76956	76943	76943	I	0	” Henry replied . “
76970	76979	76957	76957	I	0	” he added , now observing her steadily . “
76988	77001	76980	76980	I	0	” she replied rather hurriedly , not clearly understanding what he meant . “
77009	77017	76980	76980	I	0	” he inquired , with a smile . “
77028	77039	76980	76980	I	0	” she let drop in her casual , decided way . “
77050	77056	76980	76980	I	0	” Henry thought to himself . “
77074	77112	77067	77067	one	422	” he said aloud , expressing what he supposed to be her attitude , much in her accent . Perhaps she detected the imitation , for looking gently at him , she said , with ironical composure : “
77127	77128	77125	77125	Henry	189	” “
77136	77141	77130	77130	I	0	” he said shortly . “
77147	77151	77145	77145	I	0	” she replied . “
77157	77164	77165	77165	I	0	” he asked a moment later . “
77176	77211	77168	77168	you	0	” She let this pass , either because she did not attend to it , or because the tone was not to her liking . Once more she paused , and then she inquired : “
77233	77237	77227	77230	People like my mother	1733	” she reflected . “
77255	77256	77246	77246	I	0	” “
77262	77266	77246	77246	I	0	” Henry protested . “
77276	77308	77246	77246	I	0	” she replied vaguely , putting her feet on the ground , resting her chin on her hands , and looking out of her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire . “
77315	77334	77313	77313	William	176	” she added , as if by an afterthought . Henry very nearly laughed , but restrained himself . “
77346	77354	77344	77344	Henry	189	” she asked , a moment later . “
77362	77366	77344	77344	Henry	189	” he hazarded . “
77377	77382	77368	77368	you	189	” she went on . “
77395	77399	77393	77393	Katharine	129	” he protested . “
77414	77429	77410	77410	you	129	” Tremendously to his surprise , he saw the tears stand in her eyes . “
77437	77441	77432	77432	you	1739	” she said . “
77447	77501	77432	77432	you	1739	” Henry could not pretend that he was altogether ignorant of her meaning , though , certainly , he had never guessed that she minded the teasing . But before he knew what to say , her eyes were clear again , and the sudden crack in the surface was almost filled up . “
77509	77523	77432	77432	you	1739	” she stated . Obeying an impulse of genuine affection , Henry spoke . “
77542	77566	77537	77537	you	129	” She seemed to consider , looking once more into the red of the fire , and decided to refrain from any explanation . “
77573	77655	77569	77569	I	0	” she said at length , and Henry felt himself gratified by her complete sincerity , and began to tell her now about the coal - mine , in obedience to her love of facts . They were , indeed , descending the shaft in a small cage , and could hear the picks of the miners , something like the gnawing of rats , in the earth beneath them , when the door was burst open , without any knocking . “
77662	77693	77659	77659	you	129	” Rodney exclaimed . Both Katharine and Henry turned round very quickly and rather guiltily . Rodney was in evening dress . It was clear that his temper was ruffled . “
77704	77712	77659	77659	you	129	” he repeated , looking at Katharine . “
77722	77726	77713	77713	I	0	” she replied . “
77742	77747	77729	77729	Katharine	129	” She said nothing . “
77754	77778	77779	77779	They	1743	” Henry asked . Rodney found it hard to be unreasonable in the presence of another man , and did not answer him . “
77785	77789	77779	77779	They	1743	” he said . “
77821	77822	77819	77819	Henry	189	” “
77830	77835	77823	77823	We	1745	” said Henry urbanely . “
77850	77883	77839	77839	we	1745	” said Katharine . From the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke , Henry thought that some sort of explosion on Rodney ’s part was about to take place . “
77890	77932	77839	77839	we	1745	” said Rodney , with his little chuckle , leaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly with his fingers . They were all silent , and the silence was acutely uncomfortable to Henry , at least . “
77940	77959	77938	77938	William	176	” Katharine suddenly asked , with a complete change of tone and a little gesture of her hand . “
77966	77971	77938	77938	William	176	” William said sulkily . “
77987	78048	77982	77982	I	0	” she replied . She rose as she spoke , and as she turned to leave the room , she laid her hand , with a curiously caressing gesture , upon Rodney ’s shoulder . Instantly Rodney clasped her hand in his , with such an impulse of emotion that Henry was annoyed , and rather ostentatiously opened a book . “
78056	78075	78049	78049	I	0	” said William , as she drew back her hand , and made as if to pass him . “
78079	78084	78085	78085	You	189	” she said hastily . “
78093	78094	78085	78085	You	189	” “
78099	78140	78085	78085	You	189	” said Henry , shutting up his book again . His invitation was polite , without being precisely cordial . Rodney evidently hesitated as to the course he should pursue , but seeing Katharine at the door , he exclaimed : “
78150	78173	78143	78143	I	0	” She looked back , and said in a very commanding tone , and with an expression of authority upon her face : “
78194	78305	78085	78085	You	189	” She nodded to them both , but Henry could not help noticing that her last nod was in his direction . Rodney sat down rather heavily . His mortification was so obvious that Henry scarcely liked to open the conversation with some remark of a literary character . On the other hand , unless he checked him , Rodney might begin to talk about his feelings , and irreticence is apt to be extremely painful , at any rate in prospect . He therefore adopted a middle course ; that is to say , he wrote a note upon the fly - leaf of his book , which ran , “
78313	78533	78085	78085	You	189	” This he decorated with those flourishes and decorative borders which grow of themselves upon these occasions ; and as he did so , he thought to himself that whatever Katharine ’s difficulties might be , they did not justify her behavior . She had spoken with a kind of brutality which suggested that , whether it is natural or assumed , women have a peculiar blindness to the feelings of men . The penciling of this note gave Rodney time to recover himself . Perhaps , for he was a very vain man , he was more hurt that Henry had seen him rebuffed than by the rebuff itself . He was in love with Katharine , and vanity is not decreased but increased by love ; especially , one may hazard , in the presence of one ’s own sex . But Rodney enjoyed the courage which springs from that laughable and lovable defect , and when he had mastered his first impulse , in some way to make a fool of himself , he drew inspiration from the perfect fit of his evening dress . He chose a cigarette , tapped it on the back of his hand , displayed his exquisite pumps on the edge of the fender , and summoned his self - respect . “
78544	78548	78534	78534	You	1746	” he began . “
78569	78570	78571	78573	Sir William Budge	309	” “
78594	78595	78588	78588	Stanham	310	” “
78606	78607	78608	78608	Alfred	292	” “
78637	78653	78626	78626	You	1746	” he added , desiring to help Rodney in his effort to recover his complacency . “
78660	78664	78656	78656	I	0	” Rodney replied . “
78701	78788	78789	78789	I	0	” To tell the truth , Henry labored under the same difficulty ; he did not wish to introduce Katharine ’s name , and , therefore , he replied vaguely that he had always heard that Rodney was a great rider . In truth , he had heard very little about him , one way or another , accepting him as a figure often to be found in the background at his aunt ’s house , and inevitably , though inexplicably , engaged to his cousin . “
78797	78801	78789	78789	I	0	” Rodney continued ; “
78865	78866	78857	78859	Very nice people	4031	” “
78875	78936	78867	78867	I	0	” Henry remarked , rather shortly . But Rodney , now started on an agreeable current of reflection , could not resist the temptation of pursuing it a little further . He appeared to himself as a man who moved easily in very good society , and knew enough about the true values of life to be himself above it . “
78943	78948	78940	78940	you	1756	” he went on . “
78974	78975	78976	78977	The women	3513	” “
78979	78988	78976	78977	The women	3513	” Henry thought to himself , with disgust . “
78997	79079	78991	78992	any woman	1763	” His tolerance was rapidly becoming exhausted , but he could not help liking Rodney nevertheless , and this appeared to him strange , for he was fastidious , and such words in another mouth would have condemned the speaker irreparably . He began , in short , to wonder what kind of creature this man who was to marry his cousin might be . Could any one , except a rather singular character , afford to be so ridiculously vain ? “
79092	79096	79080	79080	I	0	” he replied . “
79115	79116	79113	79113	her	280	” “
79124	79128	79117	79117	I	0	” Rodney chuckled . “
79196	79197	79191	79191	Katharine	129	” “
79200	79222	79198	79198	Katharine	129	” said Henry , with an emphasis upon the name , almost as if he resented Rodney ’s use of it , “
79230	79231	79223	79223	Katharine	129	” “
79234	79238	79239	79239	She	129	” Rodney agreed . “
79242	79258	79239	79239	She	129	” He seemed about to describe her , and he hesitated for a long time . “
79265	79292	79259	79259	She	129	” he stated , or rather almost inquired , in a different tone from that in which he had been speaking . Henry bent his head . “
79307	79308	79310	79310	Katharine	129	” “
79312	79319	79310	79310	Katharine	129	” said Henry , with decision . “
79323	79337	79321	79321	Katharine	129	” Rodney repeated , as if he weighed the meaning of the words . “
79354	79358	79359	79359	one	422	” he added , “
79367	79382	79359	79359	one	422	” He waited for Henry to confirm this statement , but Henry remained silent . “
79394	79398	79383	79383	Katharine	129	” he continued . “
79414	79415	79409	79409	She	129	” “
79418	79425	79409	79409	She	129	” said Henry , with decision . “
79437	79464	79434	79434	they	1772	” Rodney had completely dropped his pose as a man of the world , and seemed to be asking Henry to help him in a difficulty . “
79470	79475	79465	79465	I	0	” Henry hesitated cautiously . “
79503	79504	79497	79497	I	0	” “
79512	79516	79505	79505	She	129	” Henry stated . “
79524	79528	79519	79519	she	129	” said Rodney . “
79563	79564	79546	79546	She	129	” “
79567	79574	79546	79546	She	129	” said Henry . He paused . “
79581	79594	79577	79577	you	0	” he added , as if he were summing up his thoughts . “
79615	79616	79611	79611	I	0	” “
79619	79633	79637	79637	I	0	” Rodney inquired , as if he were eager for Henry to continue . “
79639	80878	79637	79637	I	0	” he was going on , as Henry remained silent , but the sentence was not finished , for the door opened , and they were interrupted by Henry ’s younger brother Gilbert , much to Henry ’s relief , for he had already said more than he liked . When the sun shone , as it did with unusual brightness that Christmas week , it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well - kept - up in Stogdon House and its grounds . In truth , Sir Francis had retired from service under the Government of India with a pension that was not adequate , in his opinion , to his services , as it certainly was not adequate to his ambitions . His career had not come up to his expectations , and although he was a very fine , white - whiskered , mahogany - colored old man to look at , and had laid down a very choice cellar of good reading and good stories , you could not long remain ignorant of the fact that some thunder - storm had soured them ; he had a grievance . This grievance dated back to the middle years of the last century , when , owing to some official intrigue , his merits had been passed over in a disgraceful manner in favor of another , his junior . The rights and wrongs of the story , presuming that they had some existence in fact , were no longer clearly known to his wife and children ; but this disappointment had played a very large part in their lives , and had poisoned the life of Sir Francis much as a disappointment in love is said to poison the whole life of a woman . Long brooding on his failure , continual arrangement and rearrangement of his deserts and rebuffs , had made Sir Francis much of an egoist , and in his retirement his temper became increasingly difficult and exacting . His wife now offered so little resistance to his moods that she was practically useless to him . He made his daughter Eleanor into his chief confidante , and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her father . To her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory , and she had to assure him constantly that his treatment had been a disgrace . Already , at the age of thirty - five , her cheeks were whitening as her mother ’s had whitened , but for her there would be no memories of Indian suns and Indian rivers , and clamor of children in a nursery ; she would have very little of substance to think about when she sat , as Lady Otway now sat , knitting white wool , with her eyes fixed almost perpetually upon the same embroidered bird upon the same fire - screen . But then Lady Otway was one of the people for whom the great make - believe game of English social life has been invented ; she spent most of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she was a dignified , important , much - occupied person , of considerable social standing and sufficient wealth . In view of the actual state of things this game needed a great deal of skill ; and , perhaps , at the age she had reached — she was over sixty — she played far more to deceive herself than to deceive any one else . Moreover , the armor was wearing thin ; she forgot to keep up appearances more and more . The worn patches in the carpets , and the pallor of the drawing - room , where no chair or cover had been renewed for some years , were due not only to the miserable pension , but to the wear and tear of twelve children , eight of whom were sons . As often happens in these large families , a distinct dividing - line could be traced , about half - way in the succession , where the money for educational purposes had run short , and the six younger children had grown up far more economically than the elder . If the boys were clever , they won scholarships , and went to school ; if they were not clever , they took what the family connection had to offer them . The girls accepted situations occasionally , but there were always one or two at home , nursing sick animals , tending silkworms , or playing the flute in their bedrooms . The distinction between the elder children and the younger corresponded almost to the distinction between a higher class and a lower one , for with only a haphazard education and insufficient allowances , the younger children had picked up accomplishments , friends , and points of view which were not to be found within the walls of a public school or of a Government office . Between the two divisions there was considerable hostility , the elder trying to patronize the younger , the younger refusing to respect the elder ; but one feeling united them and instantly closed any risk of a breach — their common belief in the superiority of their own family to all others . Henry was the eldest of the younger group , and their leader ; he bought strange books and joined odd societies ; he went without a tie for a whole year , and had six shirts made of black flannel . He had long refused to take a seat either in a shipping office or in a tea - merchant ’s warehouse ; and persisted , in spite of the disapproval of uncles and aunts , in practicing both violin and piano , with the result that he could not perform professionally upon either . Indeed , for thirty - two years of life he had nothing more substantial to show than a manuscript book containing the score of half an opera . In this protest of his , Katharine had always given him her support , and as she was generally held to be an extremely sensible person , who dressed too well to be eccentric , he had found her support of some use . Indeed , when she came down at Christmas she usually spent a great part of her time in private conferences with Henry and with Cassandra , the youngest girl , to whom the silkworms belonged . With the younger section she had a great reputation for common sense , and for something that they despised but inwardly respected and called knowledge of the world — that is to say , of the way in which respectable elderly people , going to their clubs and dining out with ministers , think and behave . She had more than once played the part of ambassador between Lady Otway and her children . That poor lady , for instance , consulted her for advice when , one day , she opened Cassandra ’s bedroom door on a mission of discovery , and found the ceiling hung with mulberry - leaves , the windows blocked with cages , and the tables stacked with home - made machines for the manufacture of silk dresses . “
80900	80911	80898	80898	Katharine	129	” she observed , rather plaintively , detailing her grievances . “
80950	81131	81156	81156	Katharine	129	” The morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas in Lady Otway ’s private sitting - room appear more than usually shabby , and the gallant gentlemen , her brothers and cousins , who had defended the Empire and left their bones on many frontiers , looked at the world through a film of yellow which the morning light seemed to have drawn across their photographs . Lady Otway sighed , it may be at the faded relics , and turned , with resignation , to her balls of wool , which , curiously and characteristically , were not an ivory - white , but rather a tarnished yellow - white . She had called her niece in for a little chat . She had always trusted her , and now more than ever , since her engagement to Rodney , which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable , and just what one would wish for one ’s own daughter . Katharine unwittingly increased her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting - needles too . “
81138	81143	81156	81156	Katharine	129	” said Lady Otway , “
81164	81293	81156	81156	Katharine	129	” The emotions of the night before , which she had suppressed in such a way as to keep her awake till dawn , had left Katharine a little jaded , and thus more matter - of - fact than usual . She was quite ready to discuss her plans — houses and rents , servants and economy — without feeling that they concerned her very much . As she spoke , knitting methodically meanwhile , Lady Otway noted , with approval , the upright , responsible bearing of her niece , to whom the prospect of marriage had brought some gravity most becoming in a bride , and yet , in these days , most rare . Yes , Katharine ’s engagement had changed her a little . “
81306	81329	81156	81156	Katharine	129	” she thought to herself , and could not help contrasting her with Cassandra , surrounded by innumerable silkworms in her bedroom . “
81332	81354	81156	81156	Katharine	129	” she continued , glancing at Katharine , with the round , greenish eyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles , “
81373	81439	81364	81364	We	1785	” But just as she was deriving satisfaction from this thought , and was producing some of the hoarded wisdom which none of her own daughters , alas ! seemed now to need , the door opened , and Mrs. Hilbery came in , or rather , did not come in , but stood in the doorway and smiled , having evidently mistaken the room . “
81450	81454	81455	81455	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
81481	81531	81532	81532	I	0	” The presence of her sister - in - law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy . How could she go on with what she was saying in Maggie ’s presence ? for she was saying something that she had never said , all these years , to Maggie herself . “
81543	81552	81532	81532	I	0	” she said , with a little laugh . “
81564	81565	81562	81562	Maggie	233	” “
81568	81586	81587	81587	I	0	” said Mrs. Hilbery , coming into the room , and nodding her head once or twice , “
81615	81651	81652	81653	Aunt Charlotte	314	” she added , giving her sister - in - law a little pat , which made Lady Otway more uncomfortable still . She half laughed , muttered something , and ended on a sigh . “
81670	81717	81652	81653	Aunt Charlotte	314	” said Katharine , framing her aunt ’s words into a far more definite shape than they had really worn ; and when she spoke thus she did not appear at all old - fashioned . Lady Otway looked at her and paused for a moment . “
81739	81787	81720	81720	I	0	” she said , beginning a fresh row rather elaborately . Mrs. Hilbery knew something of the circumstances which , as she thought , had inspired this remark . In a moment her face was clouded with sympathy which she did not quite know how to express . “
81794	81812	81720	81720	I	0	” she exclaimed , forgetting that her train of thought might not be obvious to her listeners . “
81873	81881	81882	81882	your	314	” she concluded , looking at Katharine , “
81893	81917	81918	81920	that old Turk	1796	” Lady Otway , who was Mr. Hilbery ’s sister , knew quite well that , in private , the Hilberys called Sir Francis “
81922	81943	81918	81920	that old Turk	1796	” and though she did not follow the drift of Mrs. Hilbery ’s remarks , she knew what prompted them . “
81954	81972	81946	81946	you	314	” she said , speaking to Katharine , as if there were a separate understanding between them , “
81984	81985	81946	81946	you	314	” “
81988	81992	81946	81946	you	314	” said Katharine , “
81995	82273	82274	82274	We	1799	” She did not mean to finish her sentence , she merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt to go on talking about marriage , for she was in the mood to feel that other people could help her if they would . She went on knitting , but her fingers worked with a decision that was oddly unlike the smooth and contemplative sweep of Lady Otway ’s plump hand . Now and then she looked swiftly at her mother , then at her aunt . Mrs. Hilbery held a book in her hand , and was on her way , as Katharine guessed , to the library , where another paragraph was to be added to that varied assortment of paragraphs , the Life of Richard Alardyce . Normally , Katharine would have hurried her mother downstairs , and seen that no excuse for distraction came her way . Her attitude towards the poet ’s life , however , had changed with other changes ; and she was content to forget all about her scheme of hours . Mrs. Hilbery was secretly delighted . Her relief at finding herself excused manifested itself in a series of sidelong glances of sly humor in her daughter ’s direction , and the indulgence put her in the best of spirits . Was she to be allowed merely to sit and talk ? It was so much pleasanter to sit in a nice room filled with all sorts of interesting odds and ends which she had n’t looked at for a year , at least , than to seek out one date which contradicted another in a dictionary . “
82281	82296	82274	82274	We	1799	” she concluded , generously forgiving Sir Francis all his faults in a lump . “
82320	82336	82312	82312	I	0	” she corrected herself , with a glance obviously in the direction of Sir Francis . “
82364	82385	82362	82362	Katharine	129	” and here she sighed , and suggested that , perhaps , she ought to go down to the library . “
82403	82437	82438	82438	I	0	” said Katharine , taking no notice of her mother ’s suggestion , blind even to the depression which had now taken possession of her at the thought of her own inevitable death . “
82445	82458	82438	82438	I	0	” said Lady Otway , with a decision most unusual for her . “
82475	82522	82465	82465	one	422	” Katharine mused , seeming to address herself . Mrs. Hilbery was not much interested in these remarks , which seemed to have a melancholy tendency , and to revive her spirits she had recourse to an infallible remedy — she looked out of the window . “
82532	82583	82584	82585	Most women	4028	” she exclaimed , and her eye looked with extreme pleasure at the soft sky . at the trees , at the green fields visible behind those trees , and at the leafless branches which surrounded the body of the small blue tit . Her sympathy with nature was exquisite . “
82597	82630	82590	82590	they	4028	” Lady Otway slipped in quickly , in rather a low voice , as if she wanted to get this said while her sister - in - law ’s attention was diverted . “
82646	82647	82465	82465	one	422	” “
82660	82692	82465	82465	one	422	” said Mrs. Hilbery , catching the word marriage , as she brought her eyes back to the room again . Then she turned her mind to what she had said . “
82700	83049	82465	82465	one	422	” she corrected herself . She looked at her daughter with a look of vague alarm . It was the kind of maternal scrutiny which suggests that , in looking at her daughter a mother is really looking at herself . She was not altogether satisfied ; but she purposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which , as a matter of fact , was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in her daughter . But when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life , Katharine felt , as she was apt to do suddenly , for no definite reason , that they understood each other , in spite of differing in every possible way . Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than to our feelings as individuals , and Katharine knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning . Both these elderly women seemed to her to have been content with so little happiness , and at the moment she had not sufficient force to feel certain that their version of marriage was the wrong one . In London , certainly , this temperate attitude toward her own marriage had seemed to her just . Why had she now changed ? Why did it now depress her ? It never occurred to her that her own conduct could be anything of a puzzle to her mother , or that elder people are as much affected by the young as the young are by them . And yet it was true that love — passion — whatever one chose to call it , had played far less part in Mrs. Hilbery ’s life than might have seemed likely , judging from her enthusiastic and imaginative temperament . She had always been more interested by other things . Lady Otway , strange though it seemed , guessed more accurately at Katharine ’s state of mind than her mother did . “
83060	83073	83074	83074	I	0	” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery , once more looking out of the window . “
83162	83163	83166	83166	You	1822	” “
83181	83186	83166	83166	You	1822	” said Lady Otway . “
83198	83206	83207	83207	Katharine	129	” she continued , touching the bell . “
83211	83226	83207	83207	Katharine	129	” said Mrs. Hilbery , feeling herself unable to prefer one hour to another . “
83330	83389	83391	83391	me	0	” At this Katharine shivered a little , drew up to the fire , and warmed her hands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the coal . She wished to bring the talk back to marriage again , in order to hear Aunt Charlotte ’s views , but she did not know how to do this . “
83402	83434	83399	83400	Aunt Charlotte	314	” she said , noticing her own . She took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and round , but she did not know what to say next . “
83451	83456	83457	83457	I	0	” Lady Otway mused . “
83483	83888	83477	83477	He	306	” Katharine turned the ring round once more , and gave it back to her aunt without speaking . And while she turned it round her lips set themselves firmly together , and it seemed to her that she could satisfy William as these women had satisfied their husbands ; she could pretend to like emeralds when she preferred diamonds . Having replaced her ring , Lady Otway remarked that it was chilly , though not more so than one must expect at this time of year . Indeed , one ought to be thankful to see the sun at all , and she advised them both to dress warmly for their drive . Her aunt ’s stock of commonplaces , Katharine sometimes suspected , had been laid in on purpose to fill silences with , and had little to do with her private thoughts . But at this moment they seemed terribly in keeping with her own conclusions , so that she took up her knitting again and listened , chiefly with a view to confirming herself in the belief that to be engaged to marry some one with whom you are not in love is an inevitable step in a world where the existence of passion is only a traveller ’s story brought from the heart of deep forests and told so rarely that wise people doubt whether the story can be true . She did her best to listen to her mother asking for news of John , and to her aunt replying with the authentic history of Hilda ’s engagement to an officer in the Indian Army , but she cast her mind alternately towards forest paths and starry blossoms , and towards pages of neatly written mathematical signs . When her mind took this turn her marriage seemed no more than an archway through which it was necessary to pass in order to have her desire . At such times the current of her nature ran in its deep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming lack of consideration for the feelings of others . Just as the two elder ladies had finished their survey of the family prospects , and Lady Otway was nervously anticipating some general statement as to life and death from her sister - in - law , Cassandra burst into the room with the news that the carriage was at the door . “
83897	84002	83895	83895	himself	315	” said Lady Otway , peevishly , blaming her servants for not living up to her ideals . When Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine arrived in the hall , ready dressed for their drive , they found that the usual discussion was going forward as to the plans of the rest of the family . In token of this , a great many doors were opening and shutting , two or three people stood irresolutely on the stairs , now going a few steps up , and now a few steps down , and Sir Francis himself had come out from his study , with the “
84004	84408	83892	83892	Andrews	315	” under his arm , and a complaint about noise and draughts from the open door which , at least , had the effect of bundling the people who did not want to go into the carriage , and sending those who did not want to stay back to their rooms . It was decided that Mrs. Hilbery , Katharine , Rodney , and Henry should drive to Lincoln , and any one else who wished to go should follow on bicycles or in the pony - cart . Every one who stayed at Stogdon House had to make this expedition to Lincoln in obedience to Lady Otway ’s conception of the right way to entertain her guests , which she had imbibed from reading in fashionable papers of the behavior of Christmas parties in ducal houses . The carriage horses were both fat and aged , still they matched ; the carriage was shaky and uncomfortable , but the Otway arms were visible on the panels . Lady Otway stood on the topmost step , wrapped in a white shawl , and waved her hand almost mechanically until they had turned the corner under the laurel - bushes , when she retired indoors with a sense that she had played her part , and a sigh at the thought that none of her children felt it necessary to play theirs . The carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road . Mrs. Hilbery dropped into a pleasant , inattentive state of mind , in which she was conscious of the running green lines of the hedges , of the swelling ploughland , and of the mild blue sky , which served her , after the first five minutes , for a pastoral background to the drama of human life ; and then she thought of a cottage garden , with the flash of yellow daffodils against blue water ; and what with the arrangement of these different prospects , and the shaping of two or three lovely phrases , she did not notice that the young people in the carriage were almost silent . Henry , indeed , had been included against his wish , and revenged himself by observing Katharine and Rodney with disillusioned eyes ; while Katharine was in a state of gloomy self - suppression which resulted in complete apathy . When Rodney spoke to her she either said “
84411	84935	83892	83892	Andrews	315	” or assented so listlessly that he addressed his next remark to her mother . His deference was agreeable to her , his manners were exemplary ; and when the church towers and factory chimneys of the town came into sight , she roused herself , and recalled memories of the fair summer of 1853 , which fitted in harmoniously with what she was dreaming of the future . But other passengers were approaching Lincoln meanwhile by other roads on foot . A county town draws the inhabitants of all vicarages , farms , country houses , and wayside cottages , within a radius of ten miles at least , once or twice a week to its streets ; and among them , on this occasion , were Ralph Denham and Mary Datchet . They despised the roads , and took their way across the fields ; and yet , from their appearance , it did not seem as if they cared much where they walked so long as the way did not actually trip them up . When they left the Vicarage , they had begun an argument which swung their feet along so rhythmically in time with it that they covered the ground at over four miles an hour , and saw nothing of the hedgerows , the swelling plowland , or the mild blue sky . What they saw were the Houses of Parliament and the Government Offices in Whitehall . They both belonged to the class which is conscious of having lost its birthright in these great structures and is seeking to build another kind of lodging for its own notion of law and government . Purposely , perhaps , Mary did not agree with Ralph ; she loved to feel her mind in conflict with his , and to be certain that he spared her female judgment no ounce of his male muscularity . He seemed to argue as fiercely with her as if she were his brother . They were alike , however , in believing that it behooved them to take in hand the repair and reconstruction of the fabric of England . They agreed in thinking that nature has not been generous in the endowment of our councilors . They agreed , unconsciously , in a mute love for the muddy field through which they tramped , with eyes narrowed close by the concentration of their minds . At length they drew breath , let the argument fly away into the limbo of other good arguments , and , leaning over a gate , opened their eyes for the first time and looked about them . Their feet tingled with warm blood and their breath rose in steam around them . The bodily exercise made them both feel more direct and less self - conscious than usual , and Mary , indeed , was overcome by a sort of light - headedness which made it seem to her that it mattered very little what happened next . It mattered so little , indeed , that she felt herself on the point of saying to Ralph : “
84967	85029	84960	84960	I	0	” At the moment , however , speech or silence seemed immaterial , and she merely clapped her hands together , and looked at the distant woods with the rust - like bloom on their brown , and the green and blue landscape through the steam of her own breath . It seemed a mere toss - up whether she said , “
85034	85040	85032	85032	you	1833	” or whether she said , “
85048	85051	85041	85041	I	0	” or only “
85058	85059	85055	85055	I	0	” “
85066	85072	85061	85061	you	1835	” Ralph suddenly interrupted her , “
85080	85124	85073	85073	I	0	” Her indifference must have been superficial , for it disappeared at once . Indeed , she lost sight of the trees , and saw her own hand upon the topmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness , while he went on : “
85170	85213	85214	85214	I	0	” He spoke with an assumption of carelessness as if expecting her to dissuade him . She still waited , as if for him to continue ; she was convinced that in some roundabout way he approached the subject of their marriage . “
85223	85227	85214	85214	I	0	” he proceeded . “
85252	85253	85248	85248	you	1835	” “
85260	85264	85258	85258	yourself	0	” she asked . “
85276	85280	85265	85267	Some old woman	1840	” he replied . “
85289	85314	85281	85281	I	0	” he went on , and opened the gate with a jerk . They began to cross the next field walking side by side . “
85375	85387	85364	85364	I	0	” By this time Mary had recovered her self - control . “
85397	85401	85390	85390	I	0	” she said . “
85408	85416	85404	85404	you	0	” he asked , with some surprise . “
85429	85433	85419	85419	you	0	” she asked . “
85436	85478	85419	85419	you	0	” said Ralph , slackening his pace and remembering Katharine and her engagement , the purple leaves stamped into the path , the white paper radiant under the electric light , and the hopelessness which seemed to surround all these things . “
85485	85495	85479	85479	You	0	” he said , with something of an effort , “
85506	85531	85502	85502	you	175	” She was silent , hoping that he might tell her the reason of his unhappiness , for his excuses had not deceived her . “
85539	85712	85532	85532	I	0	” he repeated . Some six weeks separated him from that afternoon when he had sat upon the Embankment watching his visions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense of his desolation still made him shiver . He had not recovered in the least from that depression . Here was an opportunity for making himself face it , as he felt that he ought to ; for , by this time , no doubt , it was only a sentimental ghost , better exorcised by ruthless exposure to such an eye as Mary ’s , than allowed to underlie all his actions and thoughts as had been the case ever since he first saw Katharine Hilbery pouring out tea . He must begin , however , by mentioning her name , and this he found it impossible to do . He persuaded himself that he could make an honest statement without speaking her name ; he persuaded himself that his feeling had very little to do with her . “
85720	85724	85727	85727	I	0	” he said , “
85741	85776	85777	85777	I	0	” This rather stilted beginning did not please him , and it became more and more obvious to him that , whatever he might say , his unhappiness had been directly caused by Katharine . “
85785	85790	85777	85777	I	0	” he started afresh . “
85797	85824	85777	85777	I	0	” He paused again , but felt that this , at any rate , was true , and that on these lines he could go on . “
85952	85959	85975	85975	I	0	on”—for a good reason now occurred to him—“I
86049	86095	86047	86047	Mary	175	” There were two reasons that kept Mary very silent during this speech , and drew curiously straight lines upon her face . In the first place , Ralph made no mention of marriage ; in the second , he was not speaking the truth . “
86109	86124	86096	86096	I	0	” she said , with cheerful hardness , ignoring the whole of this statement . “
86138	86142	86134	86134	you	0	” she concluded , “
86157	86284	86134	86134	you	0	” They crossed the field in complete silence . Ralph was surprised by her remark and a little hurt , and yet , on the whole , rather pleased . He had convinced himself that it was impossible to lay his case truthfully before Mary , and , secretly , he was relieved to find that he had not parted with his dream to her . She was , as he had always found her , the sensible , loyal friend , the woman he trusted ; whose sympathy he could count upon , provided he kept within certain limits . He was not displeased to find that those limits were very clearly marked . When they had crossed the next hedge she said to him : “
86325	86329	86337	86337	They	1855	” she cried . “
86361	86469	86349	86349	I	0	” If she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion and security of a country cottage , she did not succeed ; for Ralph ’s determination was genuine . But she made him visualize her in her own character , so that he looked quickly at her , as she walked a little in front of him across the plowed field ; for the first time that morning he saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with Katharine . He seemed to see her marching ahead , a rather clumsy but powerful and independent figure , for whose courage he felt the greatest respect . “
86477	86484	86475	86475	Mary	175	” he exclaimed , and stopped . “
86494	86503	86492	86492	Ralph	154	” she returned , without looking at him . “
86529	86530	86531	86531	Mary	175	” “
86533	86550	86531	86531	Mary	175	” he cried , stung by the remembrance of his exacting and dictatorial ways with her , “
86560	86878	86879	86879	Katharine	129	” It took all her strength to keep the tears from springing , and to thrust back her assurance that she would forgive him till Doomsday if he chose . She was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn kind of respect for herself which lay at the root of her nature and forbade surrender , even in moments of almost overwhelming passion . Now , when all was tempest and high - running waves , she knew of a land where the sun shone clear upon Italian grammars and files of docketed papers . Nevertheless , from the skeleton pallor of that land and the rocks that broke its surface , she knew that her life there would be harsh and lonely almost beyond endurance . She walked steadily a little in front of him across the plowed field . Their way took them round the verge of a wood of thin trees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land . Looking between the tree - trunks , Ralph saw laid out on the perfectly flat and richly green meadow at the bottom of the hill a small gray manor - house , with ponds , terraces , and clipped hedges in front of it , a farm building or so at the side , and a screen of fir - trees rising behind , all perfectly sheltered and self - sufficient . Behind the house the hill rose again , and the trees on the farther summit stood upright against the sky , which appeared of a more intense blue between their trunks . His mind at once was filled with a sense of the actual presence of Katharine ; the gray house and the intense blue sky gave him the feeling of her presence close by . He leant against a tree , forming her name beneath his breath : “
86883	86940	86881	86881	Katharine	129	” he said aloud , and then , looking round , saw Mary walking slowly away from him , tearing a long spray of ivy from the trees as she passed them . She seemed so definitely opposed to the vision he held in his mind that he returned to it with a gesture of impatience . “
86945	87117	86943	86943	Katharine	129	” he repeated , and seemed to himself to be with her . He lost his sense of all that surrounded him ; all substantial things — the hour of the day , what we have done and are about to do , the presence of other people and the support we derive from seeing their belief in a common reality — all this slipped from him . So he might have felt if the earth had dropped from his feet , and the empty blue had hung all round him , and the air had been steeped in the presence of one woman . The chirp of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him , and his awakenment was accompanied by a sigh . Here was the world in which he had lived ; here the plowed field , the high road yonder , and Mary , stripping ivy from the trees . When he came up with her he linked his arm through hers and said : “
87129	87373	87120	87120	Mary	175	” There was a brotherly kindness in his voice which seemed to her magnanimous , when she reflected that she had cut short his explanations and shown little interest in his change of plan . She gave him her reasons for thinking that she might profit by such a journey , omitting the one reason which had set all the rest in motion . He listened attentively , and made no attempt to dissuade her . In truth , he found himself curiously eager to make certain of her good sense , and accepted each fresh proof of it with satisfaction , as though it helped him to make up his mind about something . She forgot the pain he had caused her , and in place of it she became conscious of a steady tide of well - being which harmonized very aptly with the tramp of their feet upon the dry road and the support of his arm . The comfort was the more glowing in that it seemed to be the reward of her determination to behave to him simply and without attempting to be other than she was . Instead of making out an interest in the poets , she avoided them instinctively , and dwelt rather insistently upon the practical nature of her gifts . In a practical way she asked for particulars of his cottage , which hardly existed in his mind , and corrected his vagueness . “
87382	87433	87374	87374	You	1857	” she insisted , with an exaggeration of interest . She avoided asking him what he meant to do in this cottage , and , at last , when all the practical details had been thrashed out as much as possible , he rewarded her by a more intimate statement . “
87439	87443	87374	87374	You	1857	” he said , “
87464	87499	87454	87454	Mary	175	” Here he withdrew his arm from hers , lit his pipe , and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of comradeship , the most complete they had attained in all their friendship . “
87509	88333	88336	88336	Mary	175	” she said , as boldly as if she had never come to grief with Ralph in talking about books . He told her unhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the English village from Saxon days to the present time . Some such plan had lain as a seed in his mind for many years ; and now that he had decided , in a flash , to give up his profession , the seed grew in the space of twenty minutes both tall and lusty . He was surprised himself at the positive way in which he spoke . It was the same with the question of his cottage . That had come into existence , too , in an unromantic shape — a square white house standing just off the high road , no doubt , with a neighbor who kept a pig and a dozen squalling children ; for these plans were shorn of all romance in his mind , and the pleasure he derived from thinking of them was checked directly it passed a very sober limit . So a sensible man who has lost his chance of some beautiful inheritance might tread out the narrow bounds of his actual dwelling - place , and assure himself that life is supportable within its demesne , only one must grow turnips and cabbages , not melons and pomegranates . Certainly Ralph took some pride in the resources of his mind , and was insensibly helped to right himself by Mary ’s trust in him . She wound her ivy spray round her ash - plant , and for the first time for many days , when alone with Ralph , set no spies upon her motives , sayings , and feelings , but surrendered herself to complete happiness . Thus talking , with easy silences and some pauses to look at the view over the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little gray - brown bird slipping among the twigs , they walked into Lincoln , and after strolling up and down the main street , decided upon an inn where the rounded window suggested substantial fare , nor were they mistaken . For over a hundred and fifty years hot joints , potatoes , greens , and apple puddings had been served to generations of country gentlemen , and now , sitting at a table in the hollow of the bow window , Ralph and Mary took their share of this perennial feast . Looking across the joint , half - way through the meal , Mary wondered whether Ralph would ever come to look quite like the other people in the room . Would he be absorbed among the round pink faces , pricked with little white bristles , the calves fitted in shiny brown leather , the black - and - white check suits , which were sprinkled about in the same room with them ? She half hoped so ; she thought that it was only in his mind that he was different . She did not wish him to be too different from other people . The walk had given him a ruddy color , too , and his eyes were lit up by a steady , honest light , which could not make the simplest farmer feel ill at ease , or suggest to the most devout of clergymen a disposition to sneer at his faith . She loved the steep cliff of his forehead , and compared it to the brow of a young Greek horseman , who reins his horse back so sharply that it half falls on its haunches . He always seemed to her like a rider on a spirited horse . And there was an exaltation to her in being with him , because there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right pace among other people . Sitting opposite him at the little table in the window , she came back to that state of careless exaltation which had overcome her when they halted by the gate , but now it was accompanied by a sense of sanity and security , for she felt that they had a feeling in common which scarcely needed embodiment in words . How silent he was ! leaning his forehead on his hand , now and then , and again looking steadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the next table , with so little self - consciousness that she could almost watch his mind placing one thought solidly upon the top of another ; she thought that she could feel him thinking , through the shade of her fingers , and she could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an end to his thought and turn a little in his chair and say : “
88339	88368	88371	88371	Mary	175	” inviting her to take up the thread of thought where he had dropped it . And at that very moment he turned just so , and said : “
88373	88681	88684	88684	Mary	175	” with the curious touch of diffidence which she loved in him . She laughed , and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment by the look of the people in the street below . There was a motor - car with an old lady swathed in blue veils , and a lady ’s maid on the seat opposite , holding a King Charles ’s spaniel ; there was a country - woman wheeling a perambulator full of sticks down the middle of the road ; there was a bailiff in gaiters discussing the state of the cattle market with a dissenting minister — so she defined them . She ran over this list without any fear that her companion would think her trivial . Indeed , whether it was due to the warmth of the room or to the good roast beef , or whether Ralph had achieved the process which is called making up one ’s mind , certainly he had given up testing the good sense , the independent character , the intelligence shown in her remarks . He had been building one of those piles of thought , as ramshackle and fantastic as a Chinese pagoda , half from words let fall by gentlemen in gaiters , half from the litter in his own mind , about duck shooting and legal history , about the Roman occupation of Lincoln and the relations of country gentlemen with their wives , when , from all this disconnected rambling , there suddenly formed itself in his mind the idea that he would ask Mary to marry him . The idea was so spontaneous that it seemed to shape itself of its own accord before his eyes . It was then that he turned round and made use of his old , instinctive phrase : “
88687	88805	88684	88684	Mary	175	” As it presented itself to him at first , the idea was so new and interesting that he was half inclined to address it , without more ado , to Mary herself . His natural instinct to divide his thoughts carefully into two different classes before he expressed them to her prevailed . But as he watched her looking out of the window and describing the old lady , the woman with the perambulator , the bailiff and the dissenting minister , his eyes filled involuntarily with tears . He would have liked to lay his head on her shoulder and sob , while she parted his hair with her fingers and soothed him and said : “
88821	88863	88817	88817	you	1862	“ ; and they would clasp each other tight , and her arms would hold him like his mother ’s . He felt that he was very lonely , and that he was afraid of the other people in the room . “
88870	88875	88817	88817	you	1862	” he exclaimed abruptly . “
88882	88923	88924	88924	Mary	175	” she replied , rather vaguely , still looking out of the window . He resented this divided attention more than , perhaps , he knew , and he thought how Mary would soon be on her way to America . “
88926	88930	88924	88924	Mary	175	” he said , “
88953	88980	88947	88947	they	1864	” Mary felt his agitation without looking at him ; she felt convinced that she knew what it was that he wished to say to her . “
88989	89019	89020	89020	I	0	” she said ; and felt it necessary to display her extreme calmness by lifting a salt - cellar and sweeping up a little heap of bread - crumbs . “
89025	89062	89020	89020	I	0	” Ralph continued , not quite knowing what he was about to say , but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to commit himself irrevocably , and to prevent the moment of intimacy from passing . “
89126	89127	89119	89119	you	175	” “
89133	89146	89130	89130	I	0	” she said . At this point the waiter changed their plates . “
89160	89172	89150	89150	I	0	” he said , looking fixedly at the table - cloth . “
89188	89201	89176	89176	my	0	” he said energetically , although forced to keep his voice low . “
89263	89280	89320	89320	You	175	” and by a nod of his head he indicated the other occupants of the room , “
89318	89319	89320	89320	You	175	” “
89332	89390	89323	89323	I	0	” said Mary , in the same low and very earnest tones , which , in spite of being almost inaudible , surrounded their table with an atmosphere of concentration which was quite perceptible to the other diners , who glanced at them now and then with a queer mixture of kindness , amusement , and curiosity . “
89435	89453	89431	89431	your	175	” here she hesitated , and glanced at him , as if to ascertain what his passion was for—“for
89457	89471	89431	89431	your	175	” she added , as if she had found what she sought indisputably . “
89481	89486	89478	89479	a liar	1866	” Ralph repeated obstinately . “
89497	89502	89493	89493	I	0	” she said impatiently . “
89533	89551	89515	89515	I	0	care”—she was surprised to find herself speaking the word , and had to force herself to speak it out—“for
89583	89603	89562	89562	I	0	” Her voice sank , became inaudible , and wavered as if she could scarcely keep herself from tears . “
89607	89613	89562	89562	I	0	” Ralph exclaimed to himself . “
89640	90174	89635	89635	she	1873	” The certainty overwhelmed him so that he scarcely knew what he was doing ; the blood rushed to his cheeks , and although he had quite made up his mind to ask her to marry him , the certainty that she loved him seemed to change the situation so completely that he could not do it . He did not dare to look at her . If she cried , he did not know what he should do . It seemed to him that something of a terrible and devastating nature had happened . The waiter changed their plates once more . In his agitation Ralph rose , turned his back upon Mary , and looked out of the window . The people in the street seemed to him only a dissolving and combining pattern of black particles ; which , for the moment , represented very well the involuntary procession of feelings and thoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession in his own mind . At one moment he exulted in the thought that Mary loved him ; at the next , it seemed that he was without feeling for her ; her love was repulsive to him . Now he felt urged to marry her at once ; now to disappear and never see her again . In order to control this disorderly race of thought he forced himself to read the name on the chemist ’s shop directly opposite him ; then to examine the objects in the shop windows , and then to focus his eyes exactly upon a little group of women looking in at the great windows of a large draper ’s shop . This discipline having given him at least a superficial control of himself , he was about to turn and ask the waiter to bring the bill , when his eye was caught by a tall figure walking quickly along the opposite pavement — a tall figure , upright , dark , and commanding , much detached from her surroundings . She held her gloves in her left hand , and the left hand was bare . All this Ralph noticed and enumerated and recognized before he put a name to the whole — Katharine Hilbery . She seemed to be looking for somebody . Her eyes , in fact , scanned both sides of the street , and for one second were raised directly to the bow window in which Ralph stood ; but she looked away again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen him . This sudden apparition had an extraordinary effect upon him . It was as if he had thought of her so intensely that his mind had formed the shape of her , rather than that he had seen her in the flesh outside in the street . And yet he had not been thinking of her at all . The impression was so intense that he could not dismiss it , nor even think whether he had seen her or merely imagined her . He sat down at once , and said , briefly and strangely , rather to himself than to Mary : “
90180	90181	90177	90178	Katharine Hilbery	129	” “
90190	90207	90187	90187	you	129	” she asked , hardly understanding from his manner whether he had seen her or not . “
90211	90215	90208	90209	Katharine Hilbery	129	” he repeated . “
90222	90223	90217	90217	she	129	” “
90227	90238	90224	90225	Katharine Hilbery	129	” Mary thought , in an instant of blinding revelation ; “
90248	90695	90245	90246	Katharine Hilbery	129	” She knew it all now . After a moment of downcast stupor , she raised her eyes , looked steadily at Ralph , and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled at a point far beyond their surroundings , a point that she had never reached in all the time that she had known him . She noticed the lips just parted , the fingers loosely clenched , the whole attitude of rapt contemplation , which fell like a veil between them . She noticed everything about him ; if there had been other signs of his utter alienation she would have sought them out , too , for she felt that it was only by heaping one truth upon another that she could keep herself sitting there , upright . The truth seemed to support her ; it struck her , even as she looked at his face , that the light of truth was shining far away beyond him ; the light of truth , she seemed to frame the words as she rose to go , shines on a world not to be shaken by our personal calamities . Ralph handed her her coat and her stick . She took them , fastened the coat securely , grasped the stick firmly . The ivy spray was still twisted about the handle ; this one sacrifice , she thought , she might make to sentimentality and personality , and she picked two leaves from the ivy and put them in her pocket before she disencumbered her stick of the rest of it . She grasped the stick in the middle , and settled her fur cap closely upon her head , as if she must be in trim for a long and stormy walk . Next , standing in the middle of the road , she took a slip of paper from her purse , and read out loud a list of commissions entrusted to her — fruit , butter , string , and so on ; and all the time she never spoke directly to Ralph or looked at him . Ralph heard her giving orders to attentive , rosy - checked men in white aprons , and in spite of his own preoccupation , he commented upon the determination with which she made her wishes known . Once more he began , automatically , to take stock of her characteristics . Standing thus , superficially observant and stirring the sawdust on the floor meditatively with the toe of his boot , he was roused by a musical and familiar voice behind him , accompanied by a light touch upon his shoulder . “
90743	90764	90733	90733	I	0	” It was Mrs. Hilbery ; her entrance created some stir in the shop ; many people looked at her . “
90775	90793	90772	90772	I	0	” she demanded , but , catching sight of the attentive shopman , she appealed to him . “
90881	90882	90981	90981	me	0	” “
90886	90971	90981	90981	me	0	” she continued , having received the information and the pot of honey , having been introduced to Mary , and having insisted that they should accompany her back to the ruins , since in a town with so many turnings , such prospects , such delightful little half - naked boys dabbling in pools , such Venetian canals , such old blue china in the curiosity shops , it was impossible for one person all alone to find her way to the ruins . “
90974	90978	90981	90981	me	0	” she exclaimed , “
91000	91016	90998	90998	you	131	” she inquired , gazing at him with a sudden suspicion of her own accuracy . “
91080	91125	91126	91126	I	0	” They had reached the Roman arch when Mrs. Hilbery caught sight of her own party , standing like sentinels facing up and down the road so as to intercept her if , as they expected , she had got lodged in some shop . “
91135	91139	91126	91126	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
91181	91302	91303	91303	I	0	” Could they not somehow revoke that meal ? Katharine , who had gone a few steps by herself down the road , and was investigating the window of an ironmonger , as if her mother might have got herself concealed among mowing - machines and garden - shears , turned sharply on hearing her voice , and came towards them . She was a great deal surprised to see Denham and Mary Datchet . Whether the cordiality with which she greeted them was merely that which is natural to a surprise meeting in the country , or whether she was really glad to see them both , at any rate she exclaimed with unusual pleasure as she shook hands : “
91330	91338	91328	91328	Mary	175	” she continued , turning to Ralph . “
91348	91618	91328	91328	Mary	175	” Thus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real body of the woman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams , Ralph stammered ; he made a clutch at his self - control ; the color either came to his cheeks or left them , he knew not which ; but he was determined to face her and track down in the cold light of day whatever vestige of truth there might be in his persistent imaginations . He did not succeed in saying anything . It was Mary who spoke for both of them . He was struck dumb by finding that Katharine was quite different , in some strange way , from his memory , so that he had to dismiss his old view in order to accept the new one . The wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her face ; the wind had already loosened her hair , which looped across the corner of one of the large , dark eyes which , so he used to think , looked sad ; now they looked bright with the brightness of the sea struck by an unclouded ray ; everything about her seemed rapid , fragmentary , and full of a kind of racing speed . He realized suddenly that he had never seen her in the daylight before . Meanwhile , it was decided that it was too late to go in search of ruins as they had intended ; and the whole party began to walk towards the stables where the carriage had been put up . “
91623	91637	91620	91620	you	1893	” said Katharine , keeping slightly in advance of the rest with Ralph , “
91671	91672	91666	91666	you	1893	” “
91687	91770	91685	91685	you	0	” he replied . This remark , and the rough strain in his voice , recalled to her memory so many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked directly back to the London drawing - room , the family relics , and the tea - table ; and at the same time recalled some half - finished or interrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from him — she could not remember what it was . “
91777	91781	91775	91775	me	0	” she said . “
91880	91906	91877	91877	I	0	” She glanced back and saw that the others were following obediently , listening to certain memories of Lincoln upon which Mrs. Hilbery had started . “
91914	91918	91910	91910	you	0	” she asked . “
91953	91954	91942	91942	Mary	175	” “
91957	91968	91969	91969	you	0	” she exclaimed , almost standing still in her surprise , “
91978	91993	91969	91969	you	0	” It flashed across her mind that he must already be engaged to Mary . “
92007	92008	92001	92001	I	0	” “
92012	92035	92036	92036	I	0	” she asked . She answered herself at once , with a curious change from rapid speech to an almost melancholy tone . “
92053	92117	92118	92118	I	0	” At this very moment , when her words seemed to be striking a path into the future for him , they stepped into the yard of an inn , and there beheld the family coach of the Otways , to which one sleek horse was already attached , while the second was being led out of the stable door by the hostler . “
92128	92147	92118	92118	I	0	” he said briefly , having to step aside in order to avoid a groom with a bucket . “
92197	92238	92194	92194	you	0	” She could not answer because they were immediately surrounded by other members of the party — by Mrs. Hilbery , and Mary , Henry Otway , and William . Rodney went up to Katharine immediately and said to her : “
92267	92283	92253	92253	they	1912	” Katharine nodded her head . She glanced at him with an oddly furtive expression . “
92300	92360	92361	92361	I	0	” he continued to Denham . His manner was unusually peremptory ; he seemed anxious to hasten the departure , and Katharine looked at him from time to time , as Denham noticed , with an expression half of inquiry , half of annoyance . She at once helped her mother into her cloak , and said to Mary : “
92380	92917	92376	92376	I	0	” She half smiled at Ralph , but her look was a little overcast by something she was thinking , and in a very few minutes the Otway carriage rolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high road leading to the village of Lampsher . The return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home had been in the morning ; indeed , Mrs. Hilbery leant back with closed eyes in her corner , and either slept or feigned sleep , as her habit was in the intervals between the seasons of active exertion , or continued the story which she had begun to tell herself that morning . About two miles from Lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit of the heath , a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite , setting forth the gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century who had been set upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered from death just as hope seemed lost . In summer it was a pleasant place , for the deep woods on either side murmured , and the heather , which grew thick round the granite pedestal , made the light breeze taste sweetly ; in winter the sighing of the trees was deepened to a hollow sound , and the heath was as gray and almost as solitary as the empty sweep of the clouds above it . Here Rodney stopped the carriage and helped Katharine to alight . Henry , too , gave her his hand , and fancied that she pressed it very slightly in parting as if she sent him a message . But the carriage rolled on immediately , without wakening Mrs. Hilbery , and left the couple standing by the obelisk . That Rodney was angry with her and had made this opportunity for speaking to her , Katharine knew very well ; she was neither glad nor sorry that the time had come , nor , indeed , knew what to expect , and thus remained silent . The carriage grew smaller and smaller upon the dusky road , and still Rodney did not speak . Perhaps , she thought , he waited until the last sign of the carriage had disappeared beneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely alone . To cloak their silence she read the writing on the obelisk , to do which she had to walk completely round it . She was murmuring a word to two of the pious lady ’s thanks above her breath when Rodney joined her . In silence they set out along the cart - track which skirted the verge of the trees . To break the silence was exactly what Rodney wished to do , and yet could not do to his own satisfaction . In company it was far easier to approach Katharine ; alone with her , the aloofness and force of her character checked all his natural methods of attack . He believed that she had behaved very badly to him , but each separate instance of unkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone together . “
92927	92972	92376	92376	I	0	” he complained at last ; upon which she immediately slackened her pace , and walked too slowly to suit him . In desperation he said the first thing he thought of , very peevishly and without the dignified prelude which he had intended . “
92980	92981	92376	92376	I	0	” “
92984	92985	92376	92376	I	0	” “
92999	93000	93067	93067	I	0	” “
93014	93018	93067	93067	I	0	” she counted . “
93031	93061	93028	93029	other people	2964	” he blurted out , for his irritation rose as she spoke , and got the better of his awe of her , and was inflamed by that awe . “
93070	93075	93028	93029	other people	2964	” she said calmly . “
93093	93098	93083	93083	you	0	” he went on . “
93218	93253	93207	93207	You	0	” She noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to answer none of them , although the last stung her to considerable irritation . She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay . “
93264	93268	93207	93207	You	0	” she said . “
93282	93286	93274	93274	I	0	” he replied . “
93308	93331	93274	93274	I	0	” she corrected herself scrupulously . Her tone of consideration touched him , and he walked on in silence for a space . “
93341	93358	93339	93339	Katharine	129	” he exclaimed impulsively , and drew her arm through his . She withdrew it directly . “
93374	93523	93362	93362	you	0	” she said . The harshness , which Henry had noticed , was again unmistakable in her manner . William flinched and was silent . Such severity , accompanied by something indescribably cold and impersonal in her manner , had constantly been meted out to him during the last few days , always in the company of others . He had recouped himself by some ridiculous display of vanity which , as he knew , put him still more at her mercy . Now that he was alone with her there was no stimulus from outside to draw his attention from his injury . By a considerable effort of self - control he forced himself to remain silent , and to make himself distinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity , what part to the certainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus . “
93531	93657	93659	93659	she	129	” he thought to himself . It was clear that she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure , the mistress of her little section of the world ; but more than that , she was the person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life , the woman whose judgment was naturally right and steady , as his had never been in spite of all his culture . And then he could not see her come into a room without a sense of the flowing of robes , of the flowering of blossoms , of the purple waves of the sea , of all things that are lovely and mutable on the surface but still and passionate in their heart . “
93684	93688	93675	93675	I	0	” he thought . “
93726	93730	93713	93713	she	129	” he thought , “
93783	94046	93778	93778	her	129	” He was terribly tempted here to break the silence by asking Katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit her ; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of his gifts and acquirements , his knowledge of Greek and Latin , his knowledge of art and literature , his skill in the management of meters , and his ancient west - country blood . But the feeling that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the certainty that he loved Katharine as sincerely as he had it in him to love any one . And yet she could speak to him like that ! In a sort of bewilderment he lost all desire to speak , and would quite readily have taken up some different topic of conversation if Katharine had started one . This , however , she did not do . He glanced at her , in case her expression might help him to understand her behavior . As usual , she had quickened her pace unconsciously , and was now walking a little in front of him ; but he could gain little information from her eyes , which looked steadily at the brown heather , or from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead . Thus to lose touch with her , for he had no idea what she was thinking , was so unpleasant to him that he began to talk about his grievances again , without , however , much conviction in his voice . “
94068	94069	94048	94048	you	1928	” “
94074	94090	94048	94048	you	1928	” she burst out , as if he had interrupted some absorbing train of thought , “
94122	94123	94048	94048	you	1928	” “
94130	94134	94048	94048	you	1928	” he exclaimed . “
94183	94184	94178	94178	I	0	” “
94201	94202	94197	94197	you	1928	” “
94225	94581	94582	94582	I	0	” She could not force herself to speak a word . The heather was growing dim around them , and the horizon was blotted out by white mist . To ask her for passion or for certainty seemed like asking that damp prospect for fierce blades of fire , or the faded sky for the intense blue vault of June . He went on now to tell her of his love for her , in words which bore , even to her critical senses , the stamp of truth ; but none of this touched her , until , coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty , he heaved it open with his shoulder , still talking and taking no account of his effort . The virility of this deed impressed her ; and yet , normally , she attached no value to the power of opening gates . The strength of muscles has nothing to do on the face of it with the strength of affections ; nevertheless , she felt a sudden concern for this power running to waste on her account , which , combined with a desire to keep possession of that strangely attractive masculine power , made her rouse herself from her torpor . Why should she not simply tell him the truth — which was that she had accepted him in a misty state of mind when nothing had its right shape or size ? that it was deplorable , but that with clearer eyesight marriage was out of the question ? She did not want to marry any one . She wanted to go away by herself , preferably to some bleak northern moor , and there study mathematics and the science of astronomy . Twenty words would explain the whole situation to him . He had ceased to speak ; he had told her once more how he loved her and why . She summoned her courage , fixed her eyes upon a lightning - splintered ash - tree , and , almost as if she were reading a writing fixed to the trunk , began : “
94604	94605	94606	94606	Katharine	129	” “
94608	94612	94606	94606	Katharine	129	” he protested . “
94617	94622	94606	94606	Katharine	129	” she repeated obstinately . “
94640	94641	94642	94642	You	129	” “
94648	94654	94656	94657	no one	2921	” he cut her short . “
94659	94660	94661	94661	Henry	307	” “
94663	94667	94668	94668	Henry	307	” he demanded . “
94680	94681	94678	94678	you	1930	” “
94687	94691	94684	94685	some one	376	” he persisted . “
94714	94715	94712	94712	Katharine	129	” “
94723	94727	94720	94720	I	0	” she replied . “
94740	94832	94730	94730	you	129	” he demanded . Why , indeed ? A moment of pessimism , a sudden conviction of the undeniable prose of life , a lapse of the illusion which sustains youth midway between heaven and earth , a desperate attempt to reconcile herself with facts — she could only recall a moment , as of waking from a dream , which now seemed to her a moment of surrender . But who could give reasons such as these for doing what she had done ? She shook her head very sadly . “
94847	94851	94852	94852	You	129	” Rodney persisted . “
94865	95038	95039	95039	I	0	” he cried . A sense of her own misbehavior , which she had succeeded in keeping from her by sharpening her consciousness of Rodney ’s faults , now swept over her and almost overwhelmed her . What were his faults in comparison with the fact that he cared for her ? What were her virtues in comparison with the fact that she did not care for him ? In a flash the conviction that not to care is the uttermost sin of all stamped itself upon her inmost thought ; and she felt herself branded for ever . He had taken her arm , and held her hand firmly in his , nor had she the force to resist what now seemed to her his enormously superior strength . Very well ; she would submit , as her mother and her aunt and most women , perhaps , had submitted ; and yet she knew that every second of such submission to his strength was a second of treachery to him . “
95052	95079	95039	95039	I	0	” she forced herself to say , and she stiffened her arm as if to annul even the seeming submission of that separate part of her ; “
95128	95428	95119	95119	I	0	” As none of her words seemed to her at all adequate to represent what she felt , she repeated them , and emphasized them without realizing the effect that they might have upon a man who cared for her . She was completely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly dropped ; then she saw his face most strangely contorted ; was he laughing , it flashed across her ? In another moment she saw that he was in tears . In her bewilderment at this apparition she stood aghast for a second . With a desperate sense that this horror must , at all costs , be stopped , she then put her arms about him , drew his head for a moment upon her shoulder , and led him on , murmuring words of consolation , until he heaved a great sigh . They held fast to each other ; her tears , too , ran down her cheeks ; and were both quite silent . Noticing the difficulty with which he walked , and feeling the same extreme lassitude in her own limbs , she proposed that they should rest for a moment where the bracken was brown and shriveled beneath an oak - tree . He assented . Once more he gave a great sigh , and wiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness , and began to speak without a trace of his previous anger . The idea came to her that they were like the children in the fairy tale who were lost in a wood , and with this in her mind she noticed the scattering of dead leaves all round them which had been blown by the wind into heaps , a foot or two deep , here and there . “
95439	95443	95437	95437	Katharine	129	” he said ; “
95539	95553	95556	95556	you	1939	” He broke off , unable for the moment to proceed any further . “
95580	95581	95603	95603	you	0	” “
95590	95601	95603	95603	you	0	” she said , stirring the leaves with her hand . “
95611	95612	95603	95603	you	0	” “
95619	95620	95603	95603	you	0	” “
95667	95675	95660	95660	I	0	it”—she looked vaguely towards the horizon sunk under mist—“but
95688	95689	95660	95660	I	0	” “
95694	95698	95660	95660	I	0	” he asked . “
95707	95711	95712	95712	I	0	” he exclaimed . “
95719	95724	95712	95712	I	0	” she said gloomily . “
95735	95750	95730	95730	you	0	” he continued , becoming demonstrative with his hands , as his manner was . “
95906	95921	95922	95922	I	0	” he continued , with his little chuckle , which now sounded almost assured , “
95984	96327	95972	95972	he	154	” Katharine started with displeasure at the mention of Ralph ’s name . The thought of the conversation in which her conduct had been made a subject for discussion with Denham roused her anger ; but , as she instantly felt , she had scarcely the right to grudge William any use of her name , seeing what her fault against him had been from first to last . And yet Denham ! She had a view of him as a judge . She figured him sternly weighing instances of her levity in this masculine court of inquiry into feminine morality and gruffly dismissing both her and her family with some half - sarcastic , half - tolerant phrase which sealed her doom , as far as he was concerned , for ever . Having met him so lately , the sense of his character was strong in her . The thought was not a pleasant one for a proud woman , but she had yet to learn the art of subduing her expression . Her eyes fixed upon the ground , her brows drawn together , gave William a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing herself to control . A certain degree of apprehension , occasionally culminating in a kind of fear , had always entered into his love for her , and had increased , rather to his surprise , in the greater intimacy of their engagement . Beneath her steady , exemplary surface ran a vein of passion which seemed to him now perverse , now completely irrational , for it never took the normal channel of glorification of him and his doings ; and , indeed , he almost preferred the steady good sense , which had always marked their relationship , to a more romantic bond . But passion she had , he could not deny it , and hitherto he had tried to see it employed in his thoughts upon the lives of the children who were to be born to them . “
96340	96364	96328	96328	She	1950	” he thought ; but seeing her sitting there , gloomy and silent , he began to have his doubts on this point . “
96371	96377	96378	96378	She	1950	” he thought to himself . “
96388	96730	96731	96731	William	176	” and he became suddenly aware of their situation , sitting upon the ground , among the dead leaves , not fifty yards from the main road , so that it was quite possible for some one passing to see and recognize them . He brushed off his face any trace that might remain of that unseemly exhibition of emotion . But he was more troubled by Katharine ’s appearance , as she sat rapt in thought upon the ground , than by his own ; there was something improper to him in her self - forgetfulness . A man naturally alive to the conventions of society , he was strictly conventional where women were concerned , and especially if the women happened to be in any way connected with him . He noticed with distress the long strand of dark hair touching her shoulder and two or three dead beech - leaves attached to her dress ; but to recall her mind in their present circumstances to a sense of these details was impossible . She sat there , seeming unconscious of everything . He suspected that in her silence she was reproaching herself ; but he wished that she would think of her hair and of the dead beech - leaves , which were of more immediate importance to him than anything else . Indeed , these trifles drew his attention strangely from his own doubtful and uneasy state of mind ; for relief , mixing itself with pain , stirred up a most curious hurry and tumult in his breast , almost concealing his first sharp sense of bleak and overwhelming disappointment . In order to relieve this restlessness and close a distressingly ill - ordered scene , he rose abruptly and helped Katharine to her feet . She smiled a little at the minute care with which he tidied her and yet , when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat , she flinched , seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man . “
96733	96737	96731	96731	William	176	” she said , “
96751	97097	96743	96743	I	0	” The afternoon was already growing dark when the two other wayfarers , Mary and Ralph Denham , came out on the high road beyond the outskirts of Lincoln . The high road , as they both felt , was better suited to this return journey than the open country , and for the first mile or so of the way they spoke little . In his own mind Ralph was following the passage of the Otway carriage over the heath ; he then went back to the five or ten minutes that he had spent with Katharine , and examined each word with the care that a scholar displays upon the irregularities of an ancient text . He was determined that the glow , the romance , the atmosphere of this meeting should not paint what he must in future regard as sober facts . On her side Mary was silent , not because her thoughts took much handling , but because her mind seemed empty of thought as her heart of feeling . Only Ralph ’s presence , as she knew , preserved this numbness , for she could foresee a time of loneliness when many varieties of pain would beset her . At the present moment her effort was to preserve what she could of the wreck of her self - respect , for such she deemed that momentary glimpse of her love so involuntarily revealed to Ralph . In the light of reason it did not much matter , perhaps , but it was her instinct to be careful of that vision of herself which keeps pace so evenly beside every one of us , and had been damaged by her confession . The gray night coming down over the country was kind to her ; and she thought that one of these days she would find comfort in sitting upon the earth , alone , beneath a tree . Looking through the darkness , she marked the swelling ground and the tree . Ralph made her start by saying abruptly ; “
97166	97183	97163	97163	you	1955	” He spoke firmly , waited for no answer , and took her arm in his . “
97197	97202	97203	97203	You	1955	” he went on . “
97227	97241	97222	97222	you	0	” She said nothing , but this did not seem to strike him . “
97306	97334	97299	97299	Mary?—we	318	” Here he paused , and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer ; he seemed , indeed , to be continuing his own thoughts . “
97347	97402	97341	97341	I	0	” Mary said at last . The casual and rather hurried way in which she spoke , together with the fact that she was saying the exact opposite of what he expected her to say , baffled him so much that he instinctively loosened his clasp upon her arm and she withdrew it quietly . “
97409	97413	97403	97403	You	0	” he asked . “
97422	97426	97416	97416	I	0	” she replied . “
97434	97440	97427	97427	You	0	” She made no answer . “
97445	97454	97443	97443	Mary	175	” he said , with a curious laugh , “
97468	97493	97494	97494	I	0	” They walked for a minute or two in silence , and suddenly he turned to her , looked at her , and exclaimed : “
97510	97511	97502	97502	You	175	” “
97521	97532	97519	97519	Ralph	154	” she replied , turning her head away from him . “
97556	97751	97542	97542	I	0	” The voice in which she stated this was so evidently the voice of one in some extremity of anguish that Ralph had no course but to obey her . And as soon as the tone of her voice had died out , and the surprise faded from his mind , he found himself believing that she had spoken the truth , for he had but little vanity , and soon her refusal seemed a natural thing to him . He slipped through all the grades of despondency until he reached a bottom of absolute gloom . Failure seemed to mark the whole of his life ; he had failed with Katharine , and now he had failed with Mary . Up at once sprang the thought of Katharine , and with it a sense of exulting freedom , but this he checked instantly . No good had ever come to him from Katharine ; his whole relationship with her had been made up of dreams ; and as he thought of the little substance there had been in his dreams he began to lay the blame of the present catastrophe upon his dreams . “
97835	98054	97822	97822	I	0	” The tramp of their boots upon the dry road seemed to asseverate nothing , nothing , nothing . Mary thought that this silence was the silence of relief ; his depression she ascribed to the fact that he had seen Katharine and parted from her , leaving her in the company of William Rodney . She could not blame him for loving Katharine , but that , when he loved another , he should ask her to marry him — that seemed to her the cruellest treachery . Their old friendship and its firm base upon indestructible qualities of character crumbled , and her whole past seemed foolish , herself weak and credulous , and Ralph merely the shell of an honest man . Oh , the past — so much made up of Ralph ; and now , as she saw , made up of something strange and false and other than she had thought it . She tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself that morning , as Ralph paid the bill for luncheon ; but she could see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase . Something about truth was in it ; how to see the truth is our great chance in this world . “
98064	98077	98056	98056	you	1963	” Ralph now began again , without abruptness , with diffidence rather , “
98107	98108	98096	98096	you	1963	” “
98123	98124	98117	98117	I	0	” “
98132	98136	98117	98117	I	0	” he resumed ; “
98150	98395	98138	98138	I	0	” She was immensely tempted to give way to her natural trust in him , revived by the deep and now melancholy tones of his voice , and to tell him of her love , and of what had changed it . But although it seemed likely that she would soon control her anger with him , the certainty that he did not love her , confirmed by every word of his proposal , forbade any freedom of speech . To hear him speak and to feel herself unable to reply , or constrained in her replies , was so painful that she longed for the time when she should be alone . A more pliant woman would have taken this chance of an explanation , whatever risks attached to it ; but to one of Mary ’s firm and resolute temperament there was degradation in the idea of self - abandonment ; let the waves of emotion rise ever so high , she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to be the truth . Her silence puzzled Ralph . He searched his memory for words or deeds that might have made her think badly of him . In his present mood instances came but too quickly , and on top of them this culminating proof of his baseness — that he had asked her to marry him when his reasons for such a proposal were selfish and half - hearted . “
98401	98406	98396	98396	You	1966	” he said grimly . “
98432	98433	98425	98425	me	0	” “
98436	98457	98417	98417	they	1967	” she thought to herself , with a sudden rush of anguish which threatened disaster to her self - respect , “
98475	98476	98468	98468	I	0	” “
98485	98496	98468	98468	I	0	” she said , with what firmness she could muster . “
98503	98510	98497	98497	I	0	” he said . He added , “
98538	98776	98777	98777	You	1972	” She promised this , and they went on to talk calmly of things that had no reference to their feelings — a talk which , in its constraint , was infinitely sad to both of them . One more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night , when Elizabeth had gone to her room , and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a day ’s shooting . Mary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire , for the logs were burning low , and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to replenish them . Ralph was reading , but she had noticed for some time that his eyes instead of following the print were fixed rather above the page with an intensity of gloom that came to weigh upon her mind . She had not weakened in her resolve not to give way , for reflection had only made her more bitterly certain that , if she gave way , it would be to her own wish and not to his . But she had determined that there was no reason why he should suffer if her reticence were the cause of his suffering . Therefore , although she found it painful , she spoke : “
98791	98795	98789	98789	Ralph	154	” she said . “
98838	98884	98831	98831	you	1972	” Ralph ’s book slid down upon his knee and fell upon the floor . He rested his forehead on his hand and looked into the fire . He was trying to recall the exact words in which he had made his proposal to Mary . “
98892	98931	98885	98885	I	0	” he said at last . She winced ; but she respected him for saying what he did , for this , after all , was a fragment of the truth which she had vowed to live by . “
98944	98948	98885	98885	I	0	” she said . “
98961	98965	98953	98953	I	0	” he said . “
99123	99124	99125	99125	I	0	” “
99144	99150	99138	99138	you	1972	” she replied with anger . “
99165	99381	99161	99161	you	1972	” She shifted her position , as if she were about to go . An instinctive desire to prevent her from leaving the room made Ralph rise at this point and begin pacing up and down the nearly empty kitchen , checking his desire , each time he reached the door , to open it and step out into the garden . A moralist might have said that at this point his mind should have been full of self - reproach for the suffering he had caused . On the contrary , he was extremely angry , with the confused impotent anger of one who finds himself unreasonably but efficiently frustrated . He was trapped by the illogicality of human life . The obstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial , and yet he could see no way of removing them . Mary ’s words , the tone of her voice even , angered him , for she would not help him . She was part of the insanely jumbled muddle of a world which impedes the sensible life . He would have liked to slam the door or break the hind legs of a chair , for the obstacles had taken some such curiously substantial shape in his mind . “
99392	99411	99385	99387	one human being	1987	” he said , stopping in his march and confronting Mary at a distance of a few feet . “
99469	99479	99461	99461	You	1991	” he continued , as she did not speak . “
99531	99571	99572	99572	I	0	” She saw herself in the Suffrage Office , delivering judgment , meting out right and wrong , and there seemed to her to be some justice in the charge , although it did not affect her main position . “
99579	99584	99572	99572	I	0	” she said slowly . “
99598	99843	99593	99593	I	0	” It was true that she had promised that much already , and it was difficult for him to say what more it was that he wanted — some intimacy , some help against the ghost of Katharine , perhaps , something that he knew he had no right to ask ; and yet , as he sank into his chair and looked once more at the dying fire it seemed to him that he had been defeated , not so much by Mary as by life itself . He felt himself thrown back to the beginning of life again , where everything has yet to be won ; but in extreme youth one has an ignorant hope . He was no longer certain that he would triumph . Happily for Mary Datchet she returned to the office to find that by some obscure Parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more slipped beyond the attainment of women . Mrs. Seal was in a condition bordering upon frenzy . The duplicity of Ministers , the treachery of mankind , the insult to womanhood , the setback to civilization , the ruin of her life ’s work , the feelings of her father ’s daughter — all these topics were discussed in turn , and the office was littered with newspaper cuttings branded with the blue , if ambiguous , marks of her displeasure . She confessed herself at fault in her estimate of human nature . “
99851	99880	99898	99898	Mary	175	” she said , waving her hand towards the window , and indicating the foot - passengers and omnibuses then passing down the far side of Russell Square , “
99923	99936	99939	99940	their leaders	1997	” she continued , taking heart from her sight of the traffic , “
99997	100304	100305	100305	We	2003	” She shook her head and implied that she would give them one more chance , and if they did n’t take advantage of that she could n’t answer for the consequences . Mr. Clacton ’s attitude was more philosophical and better supported by statistics . He came into the room after Mrs. Seal ’s outburst and pointed out , with historical illustrations , that such reverses had happened in every political campaign of any importance . If anything , his spirits were improved by the disaster . The enemy , he said , had taken the offensive ; and it was now up to the Society to outwit the enemy . He gave Mary to understand that he had taken the measure of their cunning , and had already bent his mind to the task which , so far as she could make out , depended solely upon him . It depended , so she came to think , when invited into his room for a private conference , upon a systematic revision of the card - index , upon the issue of certain new lemon - colored leaflets , in which the facts were marshaled once more in a very striking way , and upon a large scale map of England dotted with little pins tufted with differently colored plumes of hair according to their geographical position . Each district , under the new system , had its flag , its bottle of ink , its sheaf of documents tabulated and filed for reference in a drawer , so that by looking under M or S , as the case might be , you had all the facts with respect to the Suffrage organizations of that county at your fingers ’ ends . This would require a great deal of work , of course . “
100329	100344	100326	100327	Miss Datchet	175	” he said ; and taking pleasure in his image , he continued it . “
100404	100429	100440	100441	Mr. Clacton	197	” The system , of course , was only roughly sketched so far — jotted down , in fact , during the Christmas holidays . “
100443	100456	100440	100441	Mr. Clacton	197	” said Mary dutifully , but her tone was flat and tired . “
100467	100517	100464	100465	Miss Datchet	175	” said Mr. Clacton , with a spark of satisfaction in his eye . He wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon - colored leaflet . According to his plan , it was to be distributed in immense quantities immediately , in order to stimulate and generate , “
100523	100527	100464	100465	Miss Datchet	175	” he repeated , “
100539	100540	100541	100541	We	2003	” “
100550	100554	100555	100555	They	4538	” he said . “
100594	100732	100591	100592	Miss Datchet	175	” He handed her a great bundle of newspaper cuttings , and , begging her to give him her views upon the yellow leaflet before lunch - time , he turned with alacrity to his different sheets of paper and his different bottles of ink . Mary shut the door , laid the documents upon her table , and sank her head on her hands . Her brain was curiously empty of any thought . She listened , as if , perhaps , by listening she would become merged again in the atmosphere of the office . From the next room came the rapid spasmodic sounds of Mrs. Seal ’s erratic typewriting ; she , doubtless , was already hard at work helping the people of England , as Mr. Clacton put it , to think rightly ; “
100737	101267	100591	100592	Miss Datchet	175	” those were his words . She was striking a blow against the enemy , no doubt , who did n’t let the grass grow beneath their feet . Mr. Clacton ’s words repeated themselves accurately in her brain . She pushed the papers wearily over to the farther side of the table . It was no use , though ; something or other had happened to her brain — a change of focus so that near things were indistinct again . The same thing had happened to her once before , she remembered , after she had met Ralph in the gardens of Lincoln ’s Inn Fields ; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking about sparrows and colors , until , almost at the end of the meeting , her old convictions had all come back to her . But they had only come back , she thought with scorn at her feebleness , because she wanted to use them to fight against Ralph . They were n’t , rightly speaking , convictions at all . She could not see the world divided into separate compartments of good people and bad people , any more than she could believe so implicitly in the rightness of her own thought as to wish to bring the population of the British Isles into agreement with it . She looked at the lemon - colored leaflet , and thought almost enviously of the faith which could find comfort in the issue of such documents ; for herself she would be content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness were granted her . She read Mr. Clacton ’s statement with a curious division of judgment , noting its weak and pompous verbosity on the one hand , and , at the same time , feeling that faith , faith in an illusion , perhaps , but , at any rate , faith in something , was of all gifts the most to be envied . An illusion it was , no doubt . She looked curiously round her at the furniture of the office , at the machinery in which she had taken so much pride , and marveled to think that once the copying - presses , the card - index , the files of documents , had all been shrouded , wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and a general dignity and purpose independently of their separate significance . The ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed her now . Her attitude had become very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped in the next room . Mary immediately drew up to the table , laid hands on an unopened envelope , and adopted an expression which might hide her state of mind from Mrs. Seal . Some instinct of decency required that she should not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face . Shading her eyes with her fingers , she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one drawer after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet . She was tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim : “
101319	101959	101272	101272	Sally	200	” She said nothing of the kind , however , and the presence of industry which she preserved so long as Mrs. Seal was in the room served to set her brain in motion , so that she dispatched her morning ’s work much as usual . At one o’clock she was surprised to find how efficiently she had dealt with the morning . As she put her hat on she determined to lunch at a shop in the Strand , so as to set that other piece of mechanism , her body , into action . With a brain working and a body working one could keep step with the crowd and never be found out for the hollow machine , lacking the essential thing , that one was conscious of being . She considered her case as she walked down the Charing Cross Road . She put to herself a series of questions . Would she mind , for example , if the wheels of that motor - omnibus passed over her and crushed her to death ? No , not in the least ; or an adventure with that disagreeable - looking man hanging about the entrance of the Tube station ? No ; she could not conceive fear or excitement . Did suffering in any form appall her ? No , suffering was neither good nor bad . And this essential thing ? In the eyes of every single person she detected a flame ; as if a spark in the brain ignited spontaneously at contact with the things they met and drove them on . The young women looking into the milliners ’ windows had that look in their eyes ; and elderly men turning over books in the second - hand book - shops , and eagerly waiting to hear what the price was — the very lowest price — they had it , too . But she cared nothing at all for clothes or for money either . Books she shrank from , for they were connected too closely with Ralph . She kept on her way resolutely through the crowd of people , among whom she was so much of an alien , feeling them cleave and give way before her . Strange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets should the passenger , by chance , have no exact destination in front of him , much as the mind shapes all kinds of forms , solutions , images when listening inattentively to music . From an acute consciousness of herself as an individual , Mary passed to a conception of the scheme of things in which , as a human being , she must have her share . She half held a vision ; the vision shaped and dwindled . She wished she had a pencil and a piece of paper to help her to give a form to this conception which composed itself as she walked down the Charing Cross Road . But if she talked to any one , the conception might escape her . Her vision seemed to lay out the lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied her sense of harmony . It only needed a persistent effort of thought , stimulated in this strange way by the crowd and the noise , to climb the crest of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever . Already her suffering as an individual was left behind her . Of this process , which was to her so full of effort , which comprised infinitely swift and full passages of thought , leading from one crest to another , as she shaped her conception of life in this world , only two articulate words escaped her , muttered beneath her breath—“Not
101965	102098	101272	101272	Sally	200	” She sat down on a seat opposite the statue of one of London ’s heroes upon the Embankment , and spoke the words aloud . To her they represented the rare flower or splinter of rock brought down by a climber in proof that he has stood for a moment , at least , upon the highest peak of the mountain . She had been up there and seen the world spread to the horizon . It was now necessary to alter her course to some extent , according to her new resolve . Her post should be in one of those exposed and desolate stations which are shunned naturally by happy people . She arranged the details of the new plan in her mind , not without a grim satisfaction . “
102101	102112	102113	102113	I	0	” she said to herself , rising from her seat , “
102119	102203	102117	102117	Ralph	154	” Where was he to be placed in the new scale of life ? Her exalted mood seemed to make it safe to handle the question . But she was dismayed to find how quickly her passions leapt forward the moment she sanctioned this line of thought . Now she was identified with him and rethought his thoughts with complete self - surrender ; now , with a sudden cleavage of spirit , she turned upon him and denounced him for his cruelty . “
102215	102303	102208	102208	I	0	” she said aloud ; chose the moment to cross the road with circumspection , and ten minutes later lunched in the Strand , cutting her meat firmly into small pieces , but giving her fellow - diners no further cause to judge her eccentric . Her soliloquy crystallized itself into little fragmentary phrases emerging suddenly from the turbulence of her thought , particularly when she had to exert herself in any way , either to move , to count money , or to choose a turning . “
102312	102752	102117	102117	Ralph	154	bitterness”—those , perhaps , were the most articulate of her utterances , for no one could have made head or tail of the queer gibberish murmured in front of the statue of Francis , Duke of Bedford , save that the name of Ralph occurred frequently in very strange connections , as if , having spoken it , she wished , superstitiously , to cancel it by adding some other word that robbed the sentence with his name in it of any meaning . Those champions of the cause of women , Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal , did not perceive anything strange in Mary ’s behavior , save that she was almost half an hour later than usual in coming back to the office . Happily , their own affairs kept them busy , and she was free from their inspection . If they had surprised her they would have found her lost , apparently , in admiration of the large hotel across the square , for , after writing a few words , her pen rested upon the paper , and her mind pursued its own journey among the sun - blazoned windows and the drifts of purplish smoke which formed her view . And , indeed , this background was by no means out of keeping with her thoughts . She saw to the remote spaces behind the strife of the foreground , enabled now to gaze there , since she had renounced her own demands , privileged to see the larger view , to share the vast desires and sufferings of the mass of mankind . She had been too lately and too roughly mastered by facts to take an easy pleasure in the relief of renunciation ; such satisfaction as she felt came only from the discovery that , having renounced everything that made life happy , easy , splendid , individual , there remained a hard reality , unimpaired by one ’s personal adventures , remote as the stars , unquenchable as they are . While Mary Datchet was undergoing this curious transformation from the particular to the universal , Mrs. Seal remembered her duties with regard to the kettle and the gas - fire . She was a little surprised to find that Mary had drawn her chair to the window , and , having lit the gas , she raised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her . The most obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of indisposition . But Mary , rousing herself with an effort , denied that she was indisposed . “
102760	102771	102753	102753	I	0	” she added , with a glance at her table . “
102781	102870	102871	102871	You	2013	” The words were meant to be taken lightly , but something in the tone of them roused a jealous fear which was always dormant in Mrs. Seal ’s breast . She was terribly afraid that one of these days Mary , the young woman who typified so many rather sentimental and enthusiastic ideas , who had some sort of visionary existence in white with a sheaf of lilies in her hand , would announce , in a jaunty way , that she was about to be married . “
102883	102887	102876	102876	you	2013	” she said . “
102898	102928	102893	102893	my	0	” said Mary — a remark which could be taken as a generalization . Mrs. Seal got the teacups out of the cupboard and set them on the table . “
102940	102951	102954	102954	you	2013	” she asked , pronouncing the words with nervous speed . “
102964	102972	102954	102954	you	2013	” Mary asked , not very steadily . “
102979	103068	102954	102954	you	2013	” Mrs. Seal emitted a most peculiar chuckle . She seemed for one moment to acknowledge the terrible side of life which is concerned with the emotions , the private lives , of the sexes , and then to sheer off from it with all possible speed into the shades of her own shivering virginity . She was made so uncomfortable by the turn the conversation had taken , that she plunged her head into the cupboard , and endeavored to abstract some very obscure piece of china . “
103074	103215	103069	103069	We	2015	” she said , withdrawing her head , displaying cheeks more than usually crimson , and placing a jam - pot emphatically upon the table . But , for the moment , she was unable to launch herself upon one of those enthusiastic , but inconsequent , tirades upon liberty , democracy , the rights of the people , and the iniquities of the Government , in which she delighted . Some memory from her own past or from the past of her sex rose to her mind and kept her abashed . She glanced furtively at Mary , who still sat by the window with her arm upon the sill . She noticed how young she was and full of the promise of womanhood . The sight made her so uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers . “
103225	103313	103069	103069	We	2015	” said Mary , as if concluding some passage of thought . Mrs. Seal brightened at once . She lamented her lack of scientific training , and her deficiency in the processes of logic , but she set her mind to work at once to make the prospects of the cause appear as alluring and important as she could . She delivered herself of an harangue in which she asked a great many rhetorical questions and answered them with a little bang of one fist upon another . “
103427	103432	103417	103417	I	0	some”—she glanced fiercely at the window—“who
103486	103519	103480	103480	we	2017	” she continued , gesticulating with the kettle and the teapot . Owing to these encumbrances , perhaps , she lost the thread of her discourse , and concluded , rather wistfully , “
103526	103604	103605	103605	One	422	” She referred to a matter that was a perpetual source of bewilderment to her — the extraordinary incapacity of the human race , in a world where the good is so unmistakably divided from the bad , of distinguishing one from the other , and embodying what ought to be done in a few large , simple Acts of Parliament , which would , in a very short time , completely change the lot of humanity . “
103610	103614	103605	103605	One	422	” she said , “
103644	103648	103753	103754	Mrs. Seal	196	” she reflected , “
103655	103750	103753	103754	Mrs. Seal	196	” Doing homage to the phrase , she repeated it once more , and caught the ear of Mr. Clacton , as he issued from his room ; and he repeated it a third time , giving it , as he was in the habit of doing with Mrs. Seal ’s phrases , a dryly humorous intonation . He was well pleased with the world , however , and he remarked , in a flattering manner , that he would like to see that phrase in large letters at the head of a leaflet . “
103768	103784	103753	103754	Mrs. Seal	196	” he added in his magisterial way to check the unbalanced enthusiasm of the women . “
103810	103835	103807	103808	Miss Datchet	175	” he continued , taking his place at the table and turning to Mary as usual when about to deliver his more profound cogitations , “
103878	104009	103807	103808	Miss Datchet	175	” he said , sharpening the phrase to a satisfactory degree of literary precision . His eyes rested , with something of the vanity of an author , upon the yellow leaflet which Mary held in her hand . She rose , took her seat at the head of the table , poured out tea for her colleagues , and gave her opinion upon the leaflet . So she had poured out tea , so she had criticized Mr. Clacton ’s leaflets a hundred times already ; but now it seemed to her that she was doing it in a different spirit ; she had enlisted in the army , and was a volunteer no longer . She had renounced something and was now — how could she express it?—not quite “
104013	104421	103807	103808	Miss Datchet	175	” for life . She had always known that Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal were not in the running , and across the gulf that separated them she had seen them in the guise of shadow people , flitting in and out of the ranks of the living — eccentrics , undeveloped human beings , from whose substance some essential part had been cut away . All this had never struck her so clearly as it did this afternoon , when she felt that her lot was cast with them for ever . One view of the world plunged in darkness , so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a season of despair , let the world turn again and show another , more splendid , perhaps . No , Mary thought , with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view , having lost what is best , I do not mean to pretend that any other view does instead . Whatever happens , I mean to have no presences in my life . Her very words had a sort of distinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp , bodily pain . To Mrs. Seal ’s secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion of shop at tea - time was overlooked . Mary and Mr. Clacton argued with a cogency and a ferocity which made the little woman feel that something very important — she hardly knew what — was taking place . She became much excited ; one crucifix became entangled with another , and she dug a considerable hole in the table with the point of her pencil in order to emphasize the most striking heads of the discourse ; and how any combination of Cabinet Ministers could resist such discourse she really did not know . She could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument of justice — the typewriter . The telephone - bell rang , and as she hurried off to answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance by itself , she felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface of the globe that all the subterranean wires of thought and progress came together . When she returned , with a message from the printer , she found that Mary was putting on her hat firmly ; there was something imperious and dominating in her attitude altogether . “
104426	104430	104424	104424	Sally	200	” she said , “
104475	104476	104473	104473	Sally	200	” “
104488	104611	104485	104486	Mr. Clacton	197	” said Mrs. Seal , pausing with her hand on the papers , as the door shut behind Mary . Mr. Clacton himself had been vaguely impressed by something in Mary ’s behavior towards him . He envisaged a time even when it would become necessary to tell her that there could not be two masters in one office — but she was certainly able , very able , and in touch with a group of very clever young men . No doubt they had suggested to her some of her new ideas . He signified his assent to Mrs. Seal ’s remark , but observed , with a glance at the clock , which showed only half an hour past five : “
104637	104700	104629	104632	your clever young ladies	2037	” So saying he returned to his room , and Mrs. Seal , after a moment ’s hesitation , hurried back to her labors . Mary walked to the nearest station and reached home in an incredibly short space of time , just so much , indeed , as was needed for the intelligent understanding of the news of the world as the “
104703	104752	104629	104632	your clever young ladies	2037	” reported it . Within a few minutes of opening her door , she was in trim for a hard evening ’s work . She unlocked a drawer and took out a manuscript , which consisted of a very few pages , entitled , in a forcible hand , “
104760	105295	104629	104632	your clever young ladies	2037	” The aspects dwindled out in a cries - cross of blotted lines in the very middle of a sentence , and suggested that the author had been interrupted , or convinced of the futility of proceeding , with her pen in the air .... Oh , yes , Ralph had come in at that point . She scored that sheet very effectively , and , choosing a fresh one , began at a great rate with a generalization upon the structure of human society , which was a good deal bolder than her custom . Ralph had told her once that she could n’t write English , which accounted for those frequent blots and insertions ; but she put all that behind her , and drove ahead with such words as came her way , until she had accomplished half a page of generalization and might legitimately draw breath . Directly her hand stopped her brain stopped too , and she began to listen . A paper - boy shouted down the street ; an omnibus ceased and lurched on again with the heave of duty once more shouldered ; the dullness of the sounds suggested that a fog had risen since her return , if , indeed , a fog has power to deaden sound , of which fact , she could not be sure at the present moment . It was the sort of fact Ralph Denham knew . At any rate , it was no concern of hers , and she was about to dip a pen when her ear was caught by the sound of a step upon the stone staircase . She followed it past Mr. Chippen ’s chambers ; past Mr. Gibson ’s ; past Mr. Turner ’s ; after which it became her sound . A postman , a washerwoman , a circular , a bill — she presented herself with each of these perfectly natural possibilities ; but , to her surprise , her mind rejected each one of them impatiently , even apprehensively . The step became slow , as it was apt to do at the end of the steep climb , and Mary , listening for the regular sound , was filled with an intolerable nervousness . Leaning against the table , she felt the knock of her heart push her body perceptibly backwards and forwards — a state of nerves astonishing and reprehensible in a stable woman . Grotesque fancies took shape . Alone , at the top of the house , an unknown person approaching nearer and nearer — how could she escape ? There was no way of escape . She did not even know whether that oblong mark on the ceiling was a trap - door to the roof or not . And if she got on to the roof — well , there was a drop of sixty feet or so on to the pavement . But she sat perfectly still , and when the knock sounded , she got up directly and opened the door without hesitation . She saw a tall figure outside , with something ominous to her eyes in the look of it . “
105301	105317	105298	105298	you	2038	” she said , not recognizing the face in the fitful light of the staircase . “
105325	105368	105322	105323	Katharine Hilbery	129	” Mary ’s self - possession returned almost excessively , and her welcome was decidedly cold , as if she must recoup herself for this ridiculous waste of emotion . She moved her green - shaded lamp to another table , and covered “
105375	105384	105322	105323	Katharine Hilbery	129	” with a sheet of blotting - paper . “
105393	105472	105388	105388	they	2039	” she thought bitterly , connecting Katharine and Ralph in a conspiracy to take from her even this hour of solitary study , even this poor little defence against the world . And , as she smoothed down the sheet of blotting - paper over the manuscript , she braced herself to resist Katharine , whose presence struck her , not merely by its force , as usual , but as something in the nature of a menace . “
105477	105491	105388	105388	they	2039	” said Katharine , with hesitation , perceiving that she was not welcome . “
105496	105512	105513	105513	I	0	” Mary replied , drawing forward the best of the chairs and poking the fire . “
105528	105806	105513	105513	I	0	” said Katharine , in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of something else , as was , indeed , the case . She had been paying calls with her mother , and in between the calls Mrs. Hilbery had rushed into shops and bought pillow - cases and blotting - books on no perceptible method for the furnishing of Katharine ’s house . Katharine had a sense of impedimenta accumulating on all sides of her . She had left her at length , and had come on to keep an engagement to dine with Rodney at his rooms . But she did not mean to get to him before seven o’clock , and so had plenty of time to walk all the way from Bond Street to the Temple if she wished it . The flow of faces streaming on either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of profound despondency , to which her expectation of an evening alone with Rodney contributed . They were very good friends again , better friends , they both said , than ever before . So far as she was concerned this was true . There were many more things in him than she had guessed until emotion brought them forth — strength , affection , sympathy . And she thought of them and looked at the faces passing , and thought how much alike they were , and how distant , nobody feeling anything as she felt nothing , and distance , she thought , lay inevitably between the closest , and their intimacy was the worst presence of all . For , “
105810	105821	105513	105513	I	0	” she thought , looking into a tobacconist ’s window , “
105861	106390	105851	105851	I	0	” She looked desperately at the smooth - bowled pipes , and wondered — should she walk on by the Strand or by the Embankment ? It was not a simple question , for it concerned not different streets so much as different streams of thought . If she went by the Strand she would force herself to think out the problem of the future , or some mathematical problem ; if she went by the river she would certainly begin to think about things that did n’t exist — the forest , the ocean beach , the leafy solitudes , the magnanimous hero . No , no , no ! A thousand times no!—it would n’t do ; there was something repulsive in such thoughts at present ; she must take something else ; she was out of that mood at present . And then she thought of Mary ; the thought gave her confidence , even pleasure of a sad sort , as if the triumph of Ralph and Mary proved that the fault of her failure lay with herself and not with life . An indistinct idea that the sight of Mary might be of help , combined with her natural trust in her , suggested a visit ; for , surely , her liking was of a kind that implied liking upon Mary ’s side also . After a moment ’s hesitation she decided , although she seldom acted upon impulse , to act upon this one , and turned down a side street and found Mary ’s door . But her reception was not encouraging ; clearly Mary did n’t want to see her , had no help to impart , and the half - formed desire to confide in her was quenched immediately . She was slightly amused at her own delusion , looked rather absent - minded , and swung her gloves to and fro , as if doling out the few minutes accurately before she could say good - by . Those few minutes might very well be spent in asking for information as to the exact position of the Suffrage Bill , or in expounding her own very sensible view of the situation . But there was a tone in her voice , or a shade in her opinions , or a swing of her gloves which served to irritate Mary Datchet , whose manner became increasingly direct , abrupt , and even antagonistic . She became conscious of a wish to make Katharine realize the importance of this work , which she discussed so coolly , as though she , too , had sacrificed what Mary herself had sacrificed . The swinging of the gloves ceased , and Katharine , after ten minutes , began to make movements preliminary to departure . At the sight of this , Mary was aware — she was abnormally aware of things to - night — of another very strong desire ; Katharine was not to be allowed to go , to disappear into the free , happy world of irresponsible individuals . She must be made to realize — to feel . “
106397	106409	106391	106391	I	0	” she said , as if Katharine had challenged her explicitly , “
106431	106432	106391	106391	I	0	” “
106440	106626	106627	106627	You	2044	” Mary pressed her lips , and smiled ironically ; she had Katharine at her mercy ; she could , if she liked , discharge upon her head wagon - loads of revolting proof of the state of things ignored by the casual , the amateur , the looker - on , the cynical observer of life at a distance . And yet she hesitated . As usual , when she found herself in talk with Katharine , she began to feel rapid alternations of opinion about her , arrows of sensation striking strangely through the envelope of personality , which shelters us so conveniently from our fellows . What an egoist , how aloof she was ! And yet , not in her words , perhaps , but in her voice , in her face , in her attitude , there were signs of a soft brooding spirit , of a sensibility unblunted and profound , playing over her thoughts and deeds , and investing her manner with an habitual gentleness . The arguments and phrases of Mr. Clacton fell flat against such armor . “
106642	106889	106633	106633	you	2044	” she said inconsequently , and with an accent of condescension . She was not going to make Katharine understand in a second , as she would , all she herself had learnt at the cost of such pain . No . Katharine was to be happy ; Katharine was to be ignorant ; Mary was to keep this knowledge of the impersonal life for herself . The thought of her morning ’s renunciation stung her conscience , and she tried to expand once more into that impersonal condition which was so lofty and so painless . She must check this desire to be an individual again , whose wishes were in conflict with those of other people . She repented of her bitterness . Katharine now renewed her signs of leave - taking ; she had drawn on one of her gloves , and looked about her as if in search of some trivial saying to end with . Was n’t there some picture , or clock , or chest of drawers which might be singled out for notice ? something peaceable and friendly to end the uncomfortable interview ? The green - shaded lamp burnt in the corner , and illumined books and pens and blotting - paper . The whole aspect of the place started another train of thought and struck her as enviably free ; in such a room one could work — one could have a life of one ’s own . “
106897	106901	106890	106890	I	0	” she observed . “
106912	106958	106633	106633	you	2044	things”—and engaged in this exalted way , which had no recognition or engagement - ring , she added in her own mind . Mary ’s lips parted slightly . She could not conceive in what respects Katharine , who spoke sincerely , could envy her . “
106972	106976	106963	106963	you	2045	” she said . “
106984	106989	106963	106963	you	2045	” Katharine observed vaguely . “
107003	107051	106993	106993	you	2045	” Katharine remained silent . She gazed into the fire quietly , and without a trace of self - consciousness . The hostility which she had divined in Mary ’s tone had completely disappeared , and she forgot that she had been upon the point of going . “
107059	107065	107056	107056	I	0	” she said at length . “
107072	107087	107068	107068	I	0	” She paused ; she did not know how to express what she meant . “
107099	107107	107068	107068	I	0	” she resumed , with a smile ; “
107166	107227	107228	107228	I	0	” She spoke half - mockingly , asking her question , which she scarcely troubled to frame , not of Mary , or of any one in particular . But the words seemed to Mary Datchet shallow , supercilious , cold - blooded , and cynical all in one . All her natural instincts were roused in revolt against them . “
107239	107243	107228	107228	I	0	” she said . “
107251	107290	107246	107246	I	0	” Katharine replied , looking at her as if now she were about , perhaps , to explain something very important . Mary could not help feeling the simplicity and good faith that lay behind Katharine ’s words . “
107299	107303	107291	107291	I	0	” she said . “
107306	107426	107291	107291	I	0	” said Katharine , almost sadly . She understood that Mary was thinking of Ralph , and she felt it impossible to press her to reveal more of this exalted condition ; she could only respect the fact that , in some few cases , life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass on . She rose to her feet accordingly . But Mary exclaimed , with unmistakable earnestness , that she must not go ; that they met so seldom ; that she wanted to talk to her so much .... Katharine was surprised at the earnestness with which she spoke . It seemed to her that there could be no indiscretion in mentioning Ralph by name . Seating herself “
107431	107435	107291	107291	I	0	” she said : “
107476	107477	107462	107462	He	131	” “
107483	107497	107478	107478	He	131	” said Mary briefly . The color at once came to her face . “
107506	107514	107515	107515	You	0	” said Katharine in her decided way . “
107519	107520	107515	107515	You	0	” “
107556	107717	107542	107542	he	131	” Mary bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with a poker . Katharine ’s mention of Ralph had roused within her an almost irresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case between herself and Ralph . She knew , from the tone of her voice , that in speaking of Ralph she had no desire to probe Mary ’s secrets , or to insinuate any of her own . Moreover , she liked Katharine ; she trusted her ; she felt a respect for her . The first step of confidence was comparatively simple ; but a further confidence had revealed itself , as Katharine spoke , which was not so simple , and yet it impressed itself upon her as a necessity ; she must tell Katharine what it was clear that she had no conception of — she must tell Katharine that Ralph was in love with her . “
107728	107743	107718	107718	I	0	” she said hurriedly , seeking time against the pressure of her own conviction . “
107752	107836	107748	107748	him	2056	” Katharine reflected that this was odd ; perhaps , after all , she had misunderstood the position . She was in the habit of assuming , however , that she was rather unobservant of the finer shades of feeling , and she noted her present failure as another proof that she was a practical , abstract - minded person , better fitted to deal with figures than with the feelings of men and women . Anyhow , William Rodney would say so . “
107840	107844	107748	107748	him	2056	” she said . “
107850	108107	107748	107748	him	2056	” Mary exclaimed , putting out her hand to stop her . Directly Katharine moved she felt , inarticulately and violently , that she could not bear to let her go . If Katharine went , her only chance of speaking was lost ; her only chance of saying something tremendously important was lost . Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake Katharine ’s attention , and put flight and further silence beyond her power . But although the words came to her lips , her throat closed upon them and drove them back . After all , she considered , why should she speak ? Because it is right , her instinct told her ; right to expose oneself without reservations to other human beings . She flinched from the thought . It asked too much of one already stripped bare . Something she must keep of her own . But if she did keep something of her own ? Immediately she figured an immured life , continuing for an immense period , the same feelings living for ever , neither dwindling nor changing within the ring of a thick stone wall . The imagination of this loneliness frightened her , and yet to speak — to lose her loneliness , for it had already become dear to her , was beyond her power . Her hand went down to the hem of Katharine ’s skirt , and , fingering a line of fur , she bent her head as if to examine it . “
108113	108117	108108	108108	I	0	” she said , “
108136	108145	108134	108134	Ralph	154	” she continued , in the same tone , “
108163	108178	108156	108156	He	154	” Her head remained bent , and her hand still rested upon the skirt . “
108186	108210	108156	108156	He	154	” said Katharine , and the only sign that Mary ’s words had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk . “
108220	108227	108211	108211	You	2057	” said Mary , raising herself . “
108232	108236	108211	108211	You	2057	” said Katharine ; “
108246	108360	108244	108244	you	0	” She was , in truth , horribly uncomfortable , dismayed , indeed , disillusioned . She disliked the turn things had taken quite intensely . The indecency of it afflicted her . The suffering implied by the tone appalled her . She looked at Mary furtively , with eyes that were full of apprehension . But if she had hoped to find that these words had been spoken without understanding of their meaning , she was at once disappointed . Mary lay back in her chair , frowning slightly , and looking , Katharine thought , as if she had lived fifteen years or so in the space of a few minutes . “
108379	108388	108368	108368	you	2057	” Mary said , quietly and almost coldly . “
108411	108415	108402	108402	I	0	” she added . “
108444	108449	108439	108439	I	0	” Here she paused . “
108457	108469	108455	108455	Katharine	129	” she proceeded , rousing herself and speaking with greater energy , “
108491	108528	108489	108489	Ralph	154	” The little forward shake of her head , which shook a lock of hair , together with her brighter color , gave her an appearance at once proud and defiant . Katharine thought to herself , “
108536	108561	108489	108489	Ralph	154	” She hesitated , with a feeling that it was not for her to speak ; and then said , in a low tone , “
108567	108568	108562	108562	You	2057	” “
108571	108575	108562	108562	You	2057	” said Mary ; “
108616	108620	108610	108610	I	0	” She paused . “
108646	108722	108639	108639	he	154	” Katharine looked at her again , as if her first glance must have been deluded , for , surely , there must be some outward sign that Mary was talking in an excited , or bewildered , or fantastic manner . No ; she still frowned , as if she sought her way through the clauses of a difficult argument , but she still looked more like one who reasons than one who feels . “
108733	108859	108726	108726	you	2057	” said Katharine , speaking reasonably , too . She had no need to verify the mistake by a glance at her own recollections , when the fact was so clearly stamped upon her mind that if Ralph had any feeling towards her it was one of critical hostility . She did not give the matter another thought , and Mary , now that she had stated the fact , did not seek to prove it , but tried to explain to herself , rather than to Katharine , her motives in making the statement . She had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct demanded her doing ; she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond her reckoning . “
108865	108869	108860	108860	I	0	” she said , “
108908	108925	108900	108900	I	0	” She hesitated , and groped in her endeavor to make her feelings clear to herself . “
109070	109071	109046	109046	he	154	” “
109077	109158	109072	109073	Ralph Denham	154	” said Katharine , with considerable indignation . In order to have produced such suffering in Mary , it seemed to her that he must have behaved with extreme callousness . It seemed to her that he had discarded the friendship , when it suited his convenience to do so , with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse . She was going on to express herself thus , had not Mary at once interrupted her . “
109163	109167	109046	109046	he	154	” she said ; “
109193	109510	109811	109811	She	2065	” Her voice faltered into silence . It was borne in upon her how completely in running her risk she had lost her prize , lost it so entirely that she had no longer the right , in talking of Ralph , to presume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge . She no longer completely possessed her love , since his share in it was doubtful ; and now , to make things yet more bitter , her clear vision of the way to face life was rendered tremulous and uncertain , because another was witness of it . Feeling her desire for the old unshared intimacy too great to be borne without tears , she rose , walked to the farther end of the room , held the curtains apart , and stood there mastered for a moment . The grief itself was not ignoble ; the sting of it lay in the fact that she had been led to this act of treachery against herself . Trapped , cheated , robbed , first by Ralph and then by Katharine , she seemed all dissolved in humiliation , and bereft of anything she could call her own . Tears of weakness welled up and rolled down her cheeks . But tears , at least , she could control , and would this instant , and then , turning , she would face Katharine , and retrieve what could be retrieved of the collapse of her courage . She turned . Katharine had not moved ; she was leaning a little forward in her chair and looking into the fire . Something in the attitude reminded Mary of Ralph . So he would sit , leaning forward , looking rather fixedly in front of him , while his mind went far away , exploring , speculating , until he broke off with his , “
109513	109810	109811	109811	She	2065	Mary?”—and the silence , that had been so full of romance to her , gave way to the most delightful talk that she had ever known . Something unfamiliar in the pose of the silent figure , something still , solemn , significant about it , made her hold her breath . She paused . Her thoughts were without bitterness . She was surprised by her own quiet and confidence . She came back silently , and sat once more by Katharine ’s side . Mary had no wish to speak . In the silence she seemed to have lost her isolation ; she was at once the sufferer and the pitiful spectator of suffering ; she was happier than she had ever been ; she was more bereft ; she was rejected , and she was immensely beloved . Attempt to express these sensations was vain , and , moreover , she could not help believing that , without any words on her side , they were shared . Thus for some time longer they sat silent , side by side , while Mary fingered the fur on the skirt of the old dress . The fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with William was not the only reason which sent Katharine almost at racing speed along the Strand in the direction of his rooms . Punctuality might have been achieved by taking a cab , had she not wished the open air to fan into flame the glow kindled by Mary ’s words . For among all the impressions of the evening ’s talk one was of the nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance . Thus one looked ; thus one spoke ; such was love . “
109832	109979	109822	109822	she	2065	” Katharine mused , trying to set the whole scene in motion . It was a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity occurred to her ; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark ; by its light Katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the mediocrity , indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own feelings so far as they pretended to correspond with Mary ’s feelings . She made up her mind to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained , and cast her mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath , when she had yielded , heaven knows why , for reasons which seemed now imperceptible . So in broad daylight one might revisit the place where one has groped and turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog . “
109986	109992	109822	109822	she	2065	” she said to herself . “
110015	110056	110008	110008	I	0	” she went on saying , in time to her own footsteps , and completely forgot Mary Datchet . William Rodney , having come back earlier from the office than he expected , sat down to pick out the melodies in “
110060	110337	109822	109822	she	2065	” upon the piano . Katharine was late , but that was nothing new , and , as she had no particular liking for music , and he felt in the mood for it , perhaps it was as well . This defect in Katharine was the more strange , William reflected , because , as a rule , the women of her family were unusually musical . Her cousin , Cassandra Otway , for example , had a very fine taste in music , and he had charming recollections of her in a light fantastic attitude , playing the flute in the morning - room at Stogdon House . He recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose , long like all the Otway noses , seemed to extend itself into the flute , as if she were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole . The little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament . The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to William , and suggested a thousand ways in which , with his training and accomplishments , he could be of service to her . She ought to be given the chance of hearing good music , as it is played by those who have inherited the great tradition . Moreover , from one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation , he thought it possible that she had what Katharine professed to lack , a passionate , if untaught , appreciation of literature . He had lent her his play . Meanwhile , as Katharine was certain to be late , and “
110341	110692	110699	110699	she	2066	” is nothing without a voice , he felt inclined to spend the time of waiting in writing a letter to Cassandra , exhorting her to read Pope in preference to Dostoevsky , until her feeling for form was more highly developed . He set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light and playful , and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near at heart , when he heard Katharine upon the stairs . A moment later it was plain that he had been mistaken , it was not Katharine ; but he could not settle himself to his letter . His temper had changed from one of urbane contentment — indeed of delicious expansion — to one of uneasiness and expectation . The dinner was brought in , and had to be set by the fire to keep hot . It was now a quarter of an hour beyond the specified time . He bethought him of a piece of news which had depressed him in the earlier part of the day . Owing to the illness of one of his fellow - clerks , it was likely that he would get no holiday until later in the year , which would mean the postponement of their marriage . But this possibility , after all , was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every tick of the clock that Katharine had completely forgotten her engagement . Such things had happened less frequently since Christmas , but what if they were going to begin to happen again ? What if their marriage should turn out , as she had said , a farce ? He acquitted her of any wish to hurt him wantonly , but there was something in her character which made it impossible for her to help hurting people . Was she cold ? Was she self - absorbed ? He tried to fit her with each of these descriptions , but he had to own that she puzzled him . “
110704	110908	110699	110699	she	2066	” he reflected , glancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside . What prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning ? The reason was that Katharine might , at any moment , enter the room . The thought , implying his bondage to her , irritated him acutely . It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see , and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize . Possibly , but not by any means certainly , this would annoy her — and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion , there was a knock on the door and Katharine came in . They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late . Nevertheless , her mere presence moved him strangely ; but he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make some kind of stand against her ; to get at the truth about her . He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates . “
110921	110931	110919	110919	Katharine	129	” he said directly they sat down to table ; “
110950	110976	110699	110699	she	2066	” He rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness . Katharine started a little , as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts . “
110995	110999	110987	110987	I	0	” she replied . “
111007	111110	110987	110987	I	0	” He told her , in an off - hand way , how one of his fellow - clerks had broken down , and might have to be away for months , six months even , in which case they would have to think over their position . He said it in a way which struck her , at last , as oddly casual . She looked at him . There was no outward sign that he was annoyed with her . Was she well dressed ? She thought sufficiently so . Perhaps she was late ? She looked for a clock . “
111124	111129	111116	111116	we	2069	” she repeated thoughtfully . “
111156	111357	111141	111141	I	0	” he continued . She had time to reflect that she gained something by all this , though it was too soon to determine what . But the light which had been burning with such intensity as she came along was suddenly overclouded , as much by his manner as by his news . She had been prepared to meet opposition , which is simple to encounter compared with — she did not know what it was that she had to encounter . The meal passed in quiet , well - controlled talk about indifferent things . Music was not a subject about which she knew anything , but she liked him to tell her things ; and could , she mused , as he talked , fancy the evenings of married life spent thus , over the fire ; spent thus , or with a book , perhaps , for then she would have time to read her books , and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused mind what she longed to know . The atmosphere was very free . Suddenly William broke off . She looked up apprehensively , brushing aside these thoughts with annoyance . “
111367	111393	111365	111365	Cassandra	303	” he asked her . It was obvious again that William had some meaning or other to - night , or was in some mood . “
111401	111405	111394	111394	We	2071	” he added . “
111414	111418	111411	111411	I	0	” Katharine replied . “
111427	111431	111419	111419	They	2073	” said William . “
111480	111504	111468	111468	I	0	” Katharine sank back in her chair , and Rodney took the paper on his knees , and went on with his sentence . “
111517	112236	111468	111468	I	0	“ ; but he was far more conscious of Katharine ’s eye upon him than of what he was saying about style . He knew that she was looking at him , but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess . In truth , she had fallen sufficiently into his trap to feel uncomfortably roused and disturbed and unable to proceed on the lines laid down for herself . This indifferent , if not hostile , attitude on William ’s part made it impossible to break off without animosity , largely and completely . Infinitely preferable was Mary ’s state , she thought , where there was a simple thing to do and one did it . In fact , she could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had a part in all the refinements , reserves , and subtleties of feeling for which her friends and family were so distinguished . For example , although she liked Cassandra well enough , her fantastic method of life struck her as purely frivolous ; now it was socialism , now it was silkworms , now it was music — which last she supposed was the cause of William ’s sudden interest in her . Never before had William wasted the minutes of her presence in writing his letters . With a curious sense of light opening where all , hitherto , had been opaque , it dawned upon her that , after all , possibly , yes , probably , nay , certainly , the devotion which she had almost wearily taken for granted existed in a much slighter degree than she had suspected , or existed no longer . She looked at him attentively as if this discovery of hers must show traces in his face . Never had she seen so much to respect in his appearance , so much that attracted her by its sensitiveness and intelligence , although she saw these qualities as if they were those one responds to , dumbly , in the face of a stranger . The head bent over the paper , thoughtful as usual , had now a composure which seemed somehow to place it at a distance , like a face seen talking to some one else behind glass . He wrote on , without raising his eyes . She would have spoken , but could not bring herself to ask him for signs of affection which she had no right to claim . The conviction that he was thus strange to her filled her with despondency , and illustrated quite beyond doubt the infinite loneliness of human beings . She had never felt the truth of this so strongly before . She looked away into the fire ; it seemed to her that even physically they were now scarcely within speaking distance ; and spiritually there was certainly no human being with whom she could claim comradeship ; no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be satisfied ; nothing remained in whose reality she could believe , save those abstract ideas — figures , laws , stars , facts , which she could hardly hold to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame . When Rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence , and the meanness of such devices , and looked up ready to seek some excuse for a good laugh , or opening for a confession , he was disconcerted by what he saw . Katharine seemed equally oblivious of what was bad or of what was good in him . Her expression suggested concentration upon something entirely remote from her surroundings . The carelessness of her attitude seemed to him rather masculine than feminine . His impulse to break up the constraint was chilled , and once more the exasperating sense of his own impotency returned to him . He could not help contrasting Katharine with his vision of the engaging , whimsical Cassandra ; Katharine undemonstrative , inconsiderate , silent , and yet so notable that he could never do without her good opinion . She veered round upon him a moment later , as if , when her train of thought was ended , she became aware of his presence . “
112243	112264	112238	112238	you	2076	” she asked . He thought he heard faint amusement in her tone , but not a trace of jealousy . “
112279	112283	112267	112267	I	0	” he said . “
112306	112307	112296	112296	I	0	” “
112321	112325	112308	112308	Cassandra	303	” Katharine remarked . “
112346	112347	112337	112337	she	303	” “
112350	112355	112337	112337	she	303	” said Katharine indifferently . “
112381	112530	112531	112531	Swift	269	” So speaking , she went across to his bookshelves and began looking in a desultory way among his books . Anything , she thought , was better than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the distance between them . As she pulled one book forward and then another she thought ironically of her own certainty not an hour ago ; how it had vanished in a moment , how she was merely marking time as best she could , not knowing in the least where they stood , what they felt , or whether William loved her or not . More and more the condition of Mary ’s mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable — if , indeed , it could be quite as she figured it — if , indeed , simplicity existed for any one of the daughters of women . “
112533	112553	112531	112531	Swift	269	” she said , at last , taking out a volume at haphazard to settle this question at least . “
112560	112717	112718	112718	I	0	” Rodney took the book , held it in front of him , inserted one finger between the pages , but said nothing . His face wore a queer expression of deliberation , as if he were weighing one thing with another , and would not say anything until his mind were made up . Katharine , taking her chair beside him , noted his silence and looked at him with sudden apprehension . What she hoped or feared , she could not have said ; a most irrational and indefensible desire for some assurance of his affection was , perhaps , uppermost in her mind . Peevishness , complaints , exacting cross - examination she was used to , but this attitude of composed quiet , which seemed to come from the consciousness of power within , puzzled her . She did not know what was going to happen next . At last William spoke . “
112730	112741	112728	112728	you	2078	” he said , in a voice of detached reflection . “
112777	112796	112772	112772	you	2078	” She looked at him and observed his judicial attitude as of one holding far aloof from emotion . “
112801	112813	112797	112797	I	0	” he went on , without waiting for her to answer , “
112960	112961	112948	112948	you	2083	” “
112989	112990	112979	112979	I	0	” “
112999	113014	113020	113020	I	0	” he continued , as if the question interested him in a detached way , “
113058	113217	113049	113049	I	0	” It was , perhaps , the first time in all her knowledge of him that Katharine had known William enter thus deliberately and without sign of emotion upon a statement of his own feelings . He was wo nt to discourage such intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn of the conversation , as much as to say that men , or men of the world , find such topics a little silly , or in doubtful taste . His obvious wish to explain something puzzled her , interested her , and neutralized the wound to her vanity . For some reason , too , she felt more at ease with him than usual ; or her ease was more the ease of equality — she could not stop to think of that at the moment though . His remarks interested her too much for the light that they threw upon certain problems of her own . “
113223	113227	113049	113049	I	0	” she mused . “
113252	113261	113042	113044	a third person	2086	ones”—he glanced in the direction of his books . “
113277	113281	113282	113283	Some authorities	2088	” she hazarded . “
113299	113300	113282	113283	Some authorities	2088	” “
113319	113323	113314	113314	people	383	” she hesitated . “
113332	113347	113314	113314	people	383	” he asked , letting his eyes rest upon her swiftly for a moment . “
113356	113377	113348	113348	I	0	” she said , in the tone of one absorbed by the possibilities of some view just presented to them ; “
113390	113484	113348	113348	I	0	” she added . She reviewed her daily task , the perpetual demands upon her for good sense , self - control , and accuracy in a house containing a romantic mother . Ah , but her romance was n’t that romance . It was a desire , an echo , a sound ; she could drape it in color , see it in form , hear it in music , but not in words ; no , never in words . She sighed , teased by desires so incoherent , so incommunicable . “
113491	113495	113609	113609	I	0	” William resumed , “
113510	113608	113609	113609	I	0	” Katharine agreed that it was curious — very ; but even more curious to her was the fact that she was discussing the question with William . It revealed possibilities which opened a prospect of a new relationship altogether . Somehow it seemed to her that he was helping her to understand what she had never understood ; and in her gratitude she was conscious of a most sisterly desire to help him , too — sisterly , save for one pang , not quite to be subdued , that for him she was without romance . “
113625	113629	113630	113630	You	0	” she said . “
113644	113853	113854	113854	I	0	” He asked the question formally , to protect himself from the sort of personality which he dreaded . The whole situation needed the most careful management lest it should degenerate into some degrading and disturbing exhibition such as the scene , which he could never think of without shame , upon the heath among the dead leaves . And yet each sentence brought him relief . He was coming to understand something or other about his own desires hitherto undefined by him , the source of his difficulty with Katharine . The wish to hurt her , which had urged him to begin , had completely left him , and he felt that it was only Katharine now who could help him to be sure . He must take his time . There were so many things that he could not say without the greatest difficulty — that name , for example , Cassandra . Nor could he move his eyes from a certain spot , a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains , in the heart of the coals . He waited in suspense for Katharine to continue . She had said that he might be very happy with some one he loved in that way . “
113866	113870	113871	113871	I	0	” she resumed . “
113880	113932	113933	113934	A person	2094	” she paused ; she was aware that he was listening with the greatest intentness , and that his formality was merely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort . There was some person then — some woman — who could it be ? Cassandra ? Ah , possibly — “
113936	113954	113933	113934	A person	2094	” she added , speaking in the most matter - of - fact tone she could command , “
114002	114003	114000	114000	herself	303	” “
114008	114040	114041	114041	You	2098	” burst from William , with a nervous laugh , and a little spasm went through him as Katharine noticed . It was Cassandra then . Automatically and dully she replied , “
114080	114102	114074	114074	she	303	” She ceased , as if defining to herself this peculiar charm . After a moment ’s silence William jerked out : “
114108	114109	114074	114074	she	303	” “
114135	114136	114118	114118	you	2098	” “
114143	114147	114137	114137	Dear	1609	” William muttered . “
114156	114157	114158	114158	My	0	” “
114162	114184	114158	114158	My	0	” William exclaimed , flinging himself back in his chair , and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire . “
114200	114316	114196	114196	I	0	” He was covered with an extreme confusion . He withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages of Gulliver , opened the book , and ran his eye down the list of chapters , as though he were about to select the one most suitable for reading aloud . As Katharine watched him , she was seized with preliminary symptoms of his own panic . At the same time she was convinced that , should he find the right page , take out his spectacles , clear his throat , and open his lips , a chance that would never come again in all their lives would be lost to them both . “
114329	114333	114317	114317	We	2103	” she said . “
114376	114551	114374	114374	Swift	269	” The presence of wise literary speculation , as she calculated , restored William ’s confidence in his security , and he replaced the book in the bookcase , keeping his back turned to her as he did so , and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together . But a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing him that his mind , when looked at from within , was no longer familiar ground . He felt , that is to say , what he had never consciously felt before ; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wo nt to think him ; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous possibilities . He paced once up and down the room , and then flung himself impetuously into the chair by Katharine ’s side . He had never felt anything like this before ; he put himself entirely into her hands ; he cast off all responsibility . He very nearly exclaimed aloud : “
114575	114633	114634	114634	I	0	” Her near presence , however , had a calming and reassuring effect upon his agitation , and he was conscious only of an implicit trust that , somehow , he was safe with her , that she would see him through , find out what it was that he wanted , and procure it for him . “
114645	114649	114639	114639	you	2104	” he said . “
114660	114661	114658	114658	Katharine	129	” “
114672	114676	114662	114662	You	0	” she said . “
114713	114728	114729	114729	Your	2104	” He broke off ; he did not tell her what had happened then . “
114755	114759	114751	114751	Heaven	130	” he exclaimed . “
114778	114796	114797	114797	I	0	” she said gently . William bowed his head . After a moment ’s silence he murmured : “
114805	114897	114898	114898	Katharine	129	” She sighed , involuntarily . She had been hoping all this time , with an intensity that increased second by second against the current of her words , that it would not in the end come to this . After a moment of surprising anguish , she summoned her courage to tell him how she wished only that she might help him , and had framed the first words of her speech when a knock , terrific and startling to people in their overwrought condition , sounded upon the door . “
114904	114913	114900	114900	I	0	” he urged , half in a whisper . “
114916	114926	114900	114900	I	0	” she replied , withdrawing with a little shiver , “
114934	115322	114928	114928	you	0	” When Ralph Denham entered the room and saw Katharine seated with her back to him , he was conscious of a change in the grade of the atmosphere such as a traveler meets with sometimes upon the roads , particularly after sunset , when , without warning , he runs from clammy chill to a hoard of unspent warmth in which the sweetness of hay and beanfield is cherished , as if the sun still shone although the moon is up . He hesitated ; he shuddered ; he walked elaborately to the window and laid aside his coat . He balanced his stick most carefully against the folds of the curtain . Thus occupied with his own sensations and preparations , he had little time to observe what either of the other two was feeling . Such symptoms of agitation as he might perceive ( and they had left their tokens in brightness of eye and pallor of cheeks ) seemed to him well befitting the actors in so great a drama as that of Katharine Hilbery ’s daily life . Beauty and passion were the breath of her being , he thought . She scarcely noticed his presence , or only as it forced her to adopt a manner of composure , which she was certainly far from feeling . William , however , was even more agitated than she was , and her first instalment of promised help took the form of some commonplace upon the age of the building or the architect ’s name , which gave him an excuse to fumble in a drawer for certain designs , which he laid upon the table between the three of them . Which of the three followed the designs most carefully it would be difficult to tell , but it is certain that not one of the three found for the moment anything to say . Years of training in a drawing - room came at length to Katharine ’s help , and she said something suitable , at the same moment withdrawing her hand from the table because she perceived that it trembled . William agreed effusively ; Denham corroborated him , speaking in rather high - pitched tones ; they thrust aside the plans , and drew nearer to the fireplace . “
115336	115341	115323	115323	I	0	” said Denham . ( “
115349	115359	115343	115343	I	0	” ) Katharine thought , as she agreed aloud . “
115374	115378	115360	115360	You	0	” Rodney replied . “
115398	115412	115392	115392	I	0	” The announcement seemed to convey very little to either of his hearers . “
115435	115436	115425	115425	you	0	” “
115447	115465	115437	115437	You	0	” Denham remarked . William showed such visible signs of floundering that Katharine collected herself and asked : “
115474	115777	115470	115470	you	0	” In answering her , Denham turned and looked at her . As their eyes met , she realized for the first time that she was talking to Ralph Denham , and she remembered , without recalling any details , that she had been speaking of him quite lately , and that she had reason to think ill of him . What Mary had said she could not remember , but she felt that there was a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time to examine — knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf . But her agitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past . She must get through the matter in hand , and then think it out in quiet . She bent her mind to follow what Ralph was saying . He was telling her that he had taken a cottage in Norfolk , and she was saying that she knew , or did not know , that particular neighborhood . But after a moment ’s attention her mind flew to Rodney , and she had an unusual , indeed unprecedented , sense that they were in touch and shared each other ’s thoughts . If only Ralph were not there , she would at once give way to her desire to take William ’s hand , then to bend his head upon her shoulder , for this was what she wanted to do more than anything at the moment , unless , indeed , she wished more than anything to be alone — yes , that was what she wanted . She was sick to death of these discussions ; she shivered at the effort to reveal her feelings . She had forgotten to answer . William was speaking now . “
115789	115861	115437	115437	You	0	” she asked at random , striking into a conversation which she had only half heard , in such a way as to make both Rodney and Denham look at her with a little surprise . But directly she took up the conversation , it was William ’s turn to fall silent . He at once forgot to listen to what they were saying , although he interposed nervously at intervals , “
115868	115979	115437	115437	You	0	” As the minutes passed , Ralph ’s presence became more and more intolerable to him , since there was so much that he must say to Katharine ; the moment he could not talk to her , terrible doubts , unanswerable questions accumulated , which he must lay before Katharine , for she alone could help him now . Unless he could see her alone , it would be impossible for him ever to sleep , or to know what he had said in a moment of madness , which was not altogether mad , or was it mad ? He nodded his head , and said , nervously , “
115984	116153	115437	115437	You	0	” and looked at Katharine , and thought how beautiful she looked ; there was no one in the world that he admired more . There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there . Then , as he was turning over means by which he could speak to her alone , she rose , and he was taken by surprise , for he had counted on the fact that she would outstay Denham . His only chance , then , of saying something to her in private , was to take her downstairs and walk with her to the street . While he hesitated , however , overcome with the difficulty of putting one simple thought into words when all his thoughts were scattered about , and all were too strong for utterance , he was struck silent by something that was still more unexpected . Denham got up from his chair , looked at Katharine , and said : “
116165	116452	116161	116161	we	2114	” And before William could see any way of detaining him — or would it be better to detain Katharine?—he had taken his hat , stick , and was holding the door open for Katharine to pass out . The most that William could do was to stand at the head of the stairs and say good - night . He could not offer to go with them . He could not insist that she should stay . He watched her descend , rather slowly , owing to the dusk of the staircase , and he had a last sight of Denham ’s head and of Katharine ’s head near together , against the panels , when suddenly a pang of acute jealousy overcame him , and had he not remained conscious of the slippers upon his feet , he would have run after them or cried out . As it was he could not move from the spot . At the turn of the staircase Katharine turned to look back , trusting to this last glance to seal their compact of good friendship . Instead of returning her silent greeting , William grinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage . She stopped dead for a moment , and then descended slowly into the court . She looked to the right and to the left , and once up into the sky . She was only conscious of Denham as a block upon her thoughts . She measured the distance that must be traversed before she would be alone . But when they came to the Strand no cabs were to be seen , and Denham broke the silence by saying : “
116467	116468	116161	116161	we	2114	” “
116472	116920	116161	116161	we	2114	” she agreed , paying no attention to him . Aware of her preoccupation , or absorbed in his own thoughts , Ralph said nothing further ; and in silence they walked some distance along the Strand . Ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order that one came before the rest , and the determination that when he spoke he should speak worthily , made him put off the moment of speaking till he had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him . The Strand was too busy . There was too much risk , also , of finding an empty cab . Without a word of explanation he turned to the left , down one of the side streets leading to the river . On no account must they part until something of the very greatest importance had happened . He knew perfectly well what he wished to say , and had arranged not only the substance , but the order in which he was to say it . Now , however , that he was alone with her , not only did he find the difficulty of speaking almost insurmountable , but he was aware that he was angry with her for thus disturbing him , and casting , as it was so easy for a person of her advantages to do , these phantoms and pitfalls across his path . He was determined that he would question her as severely as he would question himself ; and make them both , once and for all , either justify her dominance or renounce it . But the longer they walked thus alone , the more he was disturbed by the sense of her actual presence . Her skirt blew ; the feathers in her hat waved ; sometimes he saw her a step or two ahead of him , or had to wait for her to catch him up . The silence was prolonged , and at length drew her attention to him . First she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from his company ; then she recalled vaguely something that Mary had said to make her think ill of him ; she could not remember what , but the recollection , combined with his masterful ways — why did he walk so fast down this side street?—made her more and more conscious of a person of marked , though disagreeable , force by her side . She stopped and , looking round her for a cab , sighted one in the distance . He was thus precipitated into speech . “
116931	116935	116922	116922	you	2117	” he asked . “
116946	116947	116939	116939	I	0	” “
116951	116967	116939	116939	I	0	” she replied , guessing that his request had something to do with Mary Datchet . “
116975	116985	116986	116986	I	0	” he said , and instantly he crossed over . “
116994	117049	116986	116986	I	0	” he began . But he paused so long that she could see his head against the sky ; the slope of his thin cheek and his large , strong nose were clearly marked against it . While he paused , words that were quite different from those he intended to use presented themselves . “
117087	117125	117076	117076	you	2117	” His words , and the queer strained voice in which he spoke them , made it appear as if he addressed some person who was not the woman beside him , but some one far away . “
117168	117208	117209	117209	I	0	” he continued , filled with a sense of exaltation , and feeling that he had no need now to choose his words with pedantic accuracy , for what he wanted to say was suddenly become plain to him . “
117252	117301	117249	117249	I	0	” She had heard him so far with a feeling that she had dropped some material word which made sense of the rest . She could hear no more of this unintelligible rambling without checking him . She felt that she was overhearing what was meant for another . “
117307	117311	117302	117302	I	0	” she said . “
117322	117323	117324	117324	I	0	” “
117331	117356	117324	117324	I	0	” he replied , emphatically . He turned his head towards her . She recovered the words she was searching for while he spoke . “
117365	117384	117357	117358	Ralph Denham	154	” They came back to her in Mary Datchet ’s voice . Her anger blazed up in her . “
117392	117415	117416	117416	She	175	” she exclaimed . He made a movement as if he were surprised or taken aback , but answered in a moment : “
117431	117432	117428	117428	I	0	” “
117435	117442	117443	117443	I	0	” Katharine exclaimed , in surprise . “
117457	117461	117451	117451	I	0	” he continued . “
117539	117540	117533	117533	I	0	” “
117543	117547	117548	117548	I	0	” said Katharine , “
117572	117589	117548	117548	I	0	” She spoke with an energy that was directed even more against herself than against him . “
117595	117604	117548	117548	I	0	” she continued , with the same energy , “
117621	117646	117647	117647	I	0	” She could now see plainly before her eyes the expression on Mary Datchet ’s face . After a short pause , he said : “
117668	117669	117670	117670	I	0	” “
117676	117685	117670	117670	I	0	” she replied , conscious of some bewilderment . “
117700	117704	117695	117695	I	0	” he added . “
117715	117748	117712	117712	you	0	” she said at length . As if obeying a common instinct , they both stopped and , bending slightly over the balustrade of the river , looked into the flowing water . “
117759	117763	117749	117749	You	0	” Ralph began . “
117848	117853	117856	117856	you	0	” He checked himself . “
117965	117975	118008	118008	you	0	” Simultaneously , they both walked on very slowly . “
117989	117993	117982	117982	you	0	” she said . “
118020	118034	118008	118008	you	0	” she asked , recollecting the whole scene . He bowed his head . “
118044	118062	118037	118037	you	0	” he said . She thought , with a start , that she was no longer engaged . “
118077	118082	118083	118083	I	0	” he went on . “
118120	118125	118132	118132	You	0	” he said doggedly . “
118165	118175	118205	118205	you	0	” he added , as if arguing to himself , “
118201	118202	118205	118205	you	0	” “
118208	118212	118205	118205	you	0	” she inquired . “
118230	118231	118233	118233	my	0	” “
118236	118243	118233	118233	my	0	” she asked , in amazement . “
118250	118261	118233	118233	my	0	” he replied . He explained his meaning no further . “
118272	118283	118284	118284	You	0	” she said at last , as he remained silent . “
118296	118297	118284	118284	You	0	” “
118307	118337	118302	118302	I	0	” she hesitated . He controlled his wish to ask her to explain herself , and much to his pleasure she went on , appearing to search her mind . “
118359	118360	118349	118349	I	0	” “
118370	118379	118365	118368	a person who feels	2134	” he said , in a low voice . “
118392	118598	118365	118368	a person who feels	2134	” she asked , after a break . He told her in an orderly way , betokening careful preparation , all that he had meant to say at first ; how he stood with regard to his brothers and sisters ; what his mother had said , and his sister Joan had refrained from saying ; exactly how many pounds stood in his name at the bank ; what prospect his brother had of earning a livelihood in America ; how much of their income went on rent , and other details known to him by heart . She listened to all this , so that she could have passed an examination in it by the time Waterloo Bridge was in sight ; and yet she was no more listening to it than she was counting the paving - stones at her feet . She was feeling happier than she had felt in her life . If Denham could have seen how visibly books of algebraic symbols , pages all speckled with dots and dashes and twisted bars , came before her eyes as they trod the Embankment , his secret joy in her attention might have been dispersed . She went on , saying , “
118619	119220	119222	119222	you	2137	” so sensibly , that he had constantly to keep his brain in check ; and all the time she was in fancy looking up through a telescope at white shadow - cleft disks which were other worlds , until she felt herself possessed of two bodies , one walking by the river with Denham , the other concentrated to a silver globe aloft in the fine blue space above the scum of vapors that was covering the visible world . She looked at the sky once , and saw that no star was keen enough to pierce the flight of watery clouds now coursing rapidly before the west wind . She looked down hurriedly again . There was no reason , she assured herself , for this feeling of happiness ; she was not free ; she was not alone ; she was still bound to earth by a million fibres ; every step took her nearer home . Nevertheless , she exulted as she had never exulted before . The air was fresher , the lights more distinct , the cold stone of the balustrade colder and harder , when by chance or purpose she struck her hand against it . No feeling of annoyance with Denham remained ; he certainly did not hinder any flight she might choose to make , whether in the direction of the sky or of her home ; but that her condition was due to him , or to anything that he had said , she had no consciousness at all . They were now within sight of the stream of cabs and omnibuses crossing to and from the Surrey side of the river ; the sound of the traffic , the hooting of motor - horns , and the light chime of tram - bells sounded more and more distinctly , and , with the increase of noise , they both became silent . With a common instinct they slackened their pace , as if to lengthen the time of semi - privacy allowed them . To Ralph , the pleasure of these last yards of the walk with Katharine was so great that he could not look beyond the present moment to the time when she should have left him . He had no wish to use the last moments of their companionship in adding fresh words to what he had already said . Since they had stopped talking , she had become to him not so much a real person , as the very woman he dreamt of ; but his solitary dreams had never produced any such keenness of sensation as that which he felt in her presence . He himself was also strangely transfigured . He had complete mastery of all his faculties . For the first time he was in possession of his full powers . The vistas which opened before him seemed to have no perceptible end . But the mood had none of the restlessness or feverish desire to add one delight to another which had hitherto marked , and somewhat spoilt , the most rapturous of his imaginings . It was a mood that took such clear - eyed account of the conditions of human life that he was not disturbed in the least by the gliding presence of a taxicab , and without agitation he perceived that Katharine was conscious of it also , and turned her head in that direction . Their halting steps acknowledged the desirability of engaging the cab ; and they stopped simultaneously , and signed to it . “
119235	119267	119268	119268	I	0	” he asked , with his hand on the door . She hesitated for a moment . She could not immediately recall what the question was that she had to decide . “
119272	119277	119268	119268	I	0	” she said vaguely . “
119280	119308	119268	119268	I	0	” she added , in a second , bethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided upon a question to which she had paid no attention , “
119318	119359	119309	119309	I	0	” She stood looking at Denham , considering and hesitating , with her foot upon the step . He guessed her difficulties ; he knew in a second that she had heard nothing ; he knew everything that she felt . “
119374	119379	119382	119382	Kew	330	” he said quickly ; “
119384	119385	119382	119382	Kew	330	” “
119388	119389	119382	119382	Kew	330	” “
119392	120628	119382	119382	Kew	330	” he repeated , with immense decision . He shut the door and gave her address to the driver . She instantly was conveyed away from him , and her cab joined the knotted stream of vehicles , each marked by a light , and indistinguishable one from the other . He stood watching for a moment , and then , as if swept by some fierce impulse , from the spot where they had stood , he turned , crossed the road at a rapid pace , and disappeared . He walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural exaltation until he reached a narrow street , at this hour empty of traffic and passengers . Here , whether it was the shops with their shuttered windows , the smooth and silvered curve of the wood pavement , or a natural ebb of feeling , his exaltation slowly oozed and deserted him . He was now conscious of the loss that follows any revelation ; he had lost something in speaking to Katharine , for , after all , was the Katharine whom he loved the same as the real Katharine ? She had transcended her entirely at moments ; her skirt had blown , her feather waved , her voice spoken ; yes , but how terrible sometimes the pause between the voice of one ’s dreams and the voice that comes from the object of one ’s dreams ! He felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the figure cut by human beings when they try to carry out , in practice , what they have the power to conceive . How small both he and Katharine had appeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them ! He recalled the small , inexpressive , commonplace words in which they had tried to communicate with each other ; he repeated them over to himself . By repeating Katharine ’s words , he came in a few moments to such a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever . But she was engaged to be married , he remembered with a start . The strength of his feeling was revealed to him instantly , and he gave himself up to an irresistible rage and sense of frustration . The image of Rodney came before him with every circumstance of folly and indignity . That little pink - cheeked dancing - master to marry Katharine ? that gibbering ass with the face of a monkey on an organ ? that posing , vain , fantastical fop ? with his tragedies and his comedies , his innumerable spites and prides and pettinesses ? Lord ! marry Rodney ! She must be as great a fool as he was . His bitterness took possession of him , and as he sat in the corner of the underground carriage , he looked as stark an image of unapproachable severity as could be imagined . Directly he reached home he sat down at his table , and began to write Katharine a long , wild , mad letter , begging her for both their sakes to break with Rodney , imploring her not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty , the one truth , the one hope ; not to be a traitor , not to be a deserter , for if she were — and he wound up with a quiet and brief assertion that , whatever she did or left undone , he would believe to be the best , and accept from her with gratitude . He covered sheet after sheet , and heard the early carts starting for London before he went to bed . The first signs of spring , even such as make themselves felt towards the middle of February , not only produce little white and violet flowers in the more sheltered corners of woods and gardens , but bring to birth thoughts and desires comparable to those faintly colored and sweetly scented petals in the minds of men and women . Lives frozen by age , so far as the present is concerned , to a hard surface , which neither reflects nor yields , at this season become soft and fluid , reflecting the shapes and colors of the present , as well as the shapes and colors of the past . In the case of Mrs. Hilbery , these early spring days were chiefly upsetting inasmuch as they caused a general quickening of her emotional powers , which , as far as the past was concerned , had never suffered much diminution . But in the spring her desire for expression invariably increased . She was haunted by the ghosts of phrases . She gave herself up to a sensual delight in the combinations of words . She sought them in the pages of her favorite authors . She made them for herself on scraps of paper , and rolled them on her tongue when there seemed no occasion for such eloquence . She was upheld in these excursions by the certainty that no language could outdo the splendor of her father ’s memory , and although her efforts did not notably further the end of his biography , she was under the impression of living more in his shade at such times than at others . No one can escape the power of language , let alone those of English birth brought up from childhood , as Mrs. Hilbery had been , to disport themselves now in the Saxon plainness , now in the Latin splendor of the tongue , and stored with memories , as she was , of old poets exuberating in an infinity of vocables . Even Katharine was slightly affected against her better judgment by her mother ’s enthusiasm . Not that her judgment could altogether acquiesce in the necessity for a study of Shakespeare ’s sonnets as a preliminary to the fifth chapter of her grandfather ’s biography . Beginning with a perfectly frivolous jest , Mrs. Hilbery had evolved a theory that Anne Hathaway had a way , among other things , of writing Shakespeare ’s sonnets ; the idea , struck out to enliven a party of professors , who forwarded a number of privately printed manuals within the next few days for her instruction , had submerged her in a flood of Elizabethan literature ; she had come half to believe in her joke , which was , she said , at least as good as other people ’s facts , and all her fancy for the time being centered upon Stratford - on - Avon . She had a plan , she told Katharine , when , rather later than usual , Katharine came into the room the morning after her walk by the river , for visiting Shakespeare ’s tomb . Any fact about the poet had become , for the moment , of far greater interest to her than the immediate present , and the certainty that there was existing in England a spot of ground where Shakespeare had undoubtedly stood , where his very bones lay directly beneath one ’s feet , was so absorbing to her on this particular occasion that she greeted her daughter with the exclamation : “
120637	120655	120631	120631	he	2138	” The question , for the moment , seemed to Katharine to have reference to Ralph Denham . “
120665	120670	120657	120657	his	2138	” Mrs. Hilbery continued , “
120685	120699	120679	120679	he	2138	” Katharine still looked about her in perplexity , and Mrs. Hilbery added : “
120739	120756	120757	120757	My	0	” Then , perceiving her daughter ’s expression of perplexity , Mrs. Hilbery burst out laughing . “
120803	120818	120781	120781	I	0	” she mused , standing at the window and tapping gently upon the pane , “
120919	121051	121052	121052	Katharine	129	” Katharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope . As Shelley was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he were alive , it had , of course , considerable value . Her immediate task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed , or only the paragraph which mentioned Shelley ’s name , and she reached out for a pen and held it in readiness to do justice upon the sheet . Her pen , however , remained in the air . Almost surreptitiously she slipped a clean sheet in front of her , and her hand , descending , began drawing square boxes halved and quartered by straight lines , and then circles which underwent the same process of dissection . “
121062	121065	121054	121054	I	0	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed—“to
121237	121261	121226	121226	you	129	” she added wistfully , with a glance at her daughter , who had told her nothing about the dinner the night before . “
121271	121299	121226	121226	you	129	” said Katharine , hiding her slip of paper as her mother stood by her , and spreading the old letter about Shelley in front of her . “
121313	121318	121226	121226	you	129	” said Mrs. Hilbery . “
121380	121384	121378	121378	Katharine	129	” she urged , “
121396	121546	121547	121548	Mary Datchet	175	” Katharine was on the point of interrupting her mother , and then she was on the point of confiding in her . They came strangely close together sometimes . But , while she hesitated and sought for words not too direct , her mother had recourse to Shakespeare , and turned page after page , set upon finding some quotation which said all this about love far , far better than she could . Accordingly , Katharine did nothing but scrub one of her circles an intense black with her pencil , in the midst of which process the telephone - bell rang , and she left the room to answer it . When she returned , Mrs. Hilbery had found not the passage she wanted , but another of exquisite beauty as she justly observed , looking up for a second to ask Katharine who that was ? “
121550	121555	121547	121548	Mary Datchet	175	” Katharine replied briefly . “
121625	121647	121648	121648	My	0	” She was cut short in her quotation by another imperative telephone - bell . Once more Katharine left the room . “
121660	121668	121669	121669	They	2170	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed on her return . “
121684	121685	121686	121686	William	176	” “
121688	121695	121686	121686	William	176	” Katharine replied yet more briefly . “
121724	121725	121726	121726	He	176	” “
121732	121733	121726	121726	He	176	” “
121750	121751	121743	121743	I	0	” “
121762	122462	121757	121757	you	0	” said Katharine . She swept her hand over the faded sheet , and drew herself up squarely to the table as if she refused to waste time any longer . The gesture was not lost upon her mother . It hinted at the existence of something stern and unapproachable in her daughter ’s character , which struck chill upon her , as the sight of poverty , or drunkenness , or the logic with which Mr. Hilbery sometimes thought good to demolish her certainty of an approaching millennium struck chill upon her . She went back to her own table , and putting on her spectacles with a curious expression of quiet humility , addressed herself for the first time that morning to the task before her . The shock with an unsympathetic world had a sobering effect on her . For once , her industry surpassed her daughter ’s . Katharine could not reduce the world to that particular perspective in which Harriet Martineau , for instance , was a figure of solid importance , and possessed of a genuine relationship to this figure or to that date . Singularly enough , the sharp call of the telephone - bell still echoed in her ear , and her body and mind were in a state of tension , as if , at any moment , she might hear another summons of greater interest to her than the whole of the nineteenth century . She did not clearly realize what this call was to be ; but when the ears have got into the habit of listening , they go on listening involuntarily , and thus Katharine spent the greater part of the morning in listening to a variety of sounds in the back streets of Chelsea . For the first time in her life , probably , she wished that Mrs. Hilbery would not keep so closely to her work . A quotation from Shakespeare would not have come amiss . Now and again she heard a sigh from her mother ’s table , but that was the only proof she gave of her existence , and Katharine did not think of connecting it with the square aspect of her own position at the table , or , perhaps , she would have thrown her pen down and told her mother the reason of her restlessness . The only writing she managed to accomplish in the course of the morning was one letter , addressed to her cousin , Cassandra Otway — a rambling letter , long , affectionate , playful and commanding all at once . She bade Cassandra put her creatures in the charge of a groom , and come to them for a week or so . They would go and hear some music together . Cassandra ’s dislike of rational society , she said , was an affectation fast hardening into a prejudice , which would , in the long run , isolate her from all interesting people and pursuits . She was finishing the sheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck upon her ears . She jumped up hastily , and slammed the door with a sharpness which made Mrs. Hilbery start . Where was Katharine off to ? In her preoccupied state she had not heard the bell . The alcove on the stairs , in which the telephone was placed , was screened for privacy by a curtain of purple velvet . It was a pocket for superfluous possessions , such as exist in most houses which harbor the wreckage of three generations . Prints of great - uncles , famed for their prowess in the East , hung above Chinese teapots , whose sides were riveted by little gold stitches , and the precious teapots , again , stood upon bookcases containing the complete works of William Cowper and Sir Walter Scott . The thread of sound , issuing from the telephone , was always colored by the surroundings which received it , so it seemed to Katharine . Whose voice was now going to combine with them , or to strike a discord ? “
122466	122544	122545	122545	I	0	” she asked herself , hearing a man inquire , with great determination , for her number . The unfamiliar voice now asked for Miss Hilbery . Out of all the welter of voices which crowd round the far end of the telephone , out of the enormous range of possibilities , whose voice , what possibility , was this ? A pause gave her time to ask herself this question . It was solved next moment . “
122573	122593	122594	122594	I	0	” With more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point of a bayonet , Katharine replied : “
122610	122928	122600	122600	I	0	” She dropped the machine , and looked fixedly at the print of the great - uncle who had not ceased to gaze , with an air of amiable authority , into a world which , as yet , beheld no symptoms of the Indian Mutiny . And yet , gently swinging against the wall , within the black tube , was a voice which recked nothing of Uncle James , of China teapots , or of red velvet curtains . She watched the oscillation of the tube , and at the same moment became conscious of the individuality of the house in which she stood ; she heard the soft domestic sounds of regular existence upon staircases and floors above her head , and movements through the wall in the house next door . She had no very clear vision of Denham himself , when she lifted the telephone to her lips and replied that she thought Saturday would suit her . She hoped that he would not say good - bye at once , although she felt no particular anxiety to attend to what he was saying , and began , even while he spoke , to think of her own upper room , with its books , its papers pressed between the leaves of dictionaries , and the table that could be cleared for work . She replaced the instrument , thoughtfully ; her restlessness was assuaged ; she finished her letter to Cassandra without difficulty , addressed the envelope , and fixed the stamp with her usual quick decision . A bunch of anemones caught Mrs. Hilbery ’s eye when they had finished luncheon . The blue and purple and white of the bowl , standing in a pool of variegated light on a polished Chippendale table in the drawing - room window , made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure . “
122938	122942	122936	122936	Katharine	129	” she demanded . “
122993	123428	122989	122989	somebody	896	” she concluded , but for the moment the name of this desirable acquaintance escaped her . The best representative of the forlorn company whose day would be brightened by a bunch of anemones was , in Katharine ’s opinion , the widow of a general living in the Cromwell Road . In default of the actually destitute and starving , whom she would much have preferred , Mrs. Hilbery was forced to acknowledge her claims , for though in comfortable circumstances , she was extremely dull , unattractive , connected in some oblique fashion with literature , and had been touched to the verge of tears , on one occasion , by an afternoon call . It happened that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere , so that the task of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell upon Katharine . She took her letter to Cassandra with her , meaning to post it in the first pillar - box she came to . When , however , she was fairly out of doors , and constantly invited by pillar - boxes and post - offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats , she forbore . She made absurd excuses , as that she did not wish to cross the road , or that she was certain to pass another post - office in a more central position a little farther on . The longer she held the letter in her hand , however , the more persistently certain questions pressed upon her , as if from a collection of voices in the air . These invisible people wished to be informed whether she was engaged to William Rodney , or was the engagement broken off ? Was it right , they asked , to invite Cassandra for a visit , and was William Rodney in love with her , or likely to fall in love ? Then the questioners paused for a moment , and resumed as if another side of the problem had just come to their notice . What did Ralph Denham mean by what he said to you last night ? Do you consider that he is in love with you ? Is it right to consent to a solitary walk with him , and what advice are you going to give him about his future ? Has William Rodney cause to be jealous of your conduct , and what do you propose to do about Mary Datchet ? What are you going to do ? What does honor require you to do ? they repeated . “
123432	123443	122989	122989	somebody	896	” Katharine exclaimed , after listening to all these remarks , “
123454	124222	122989	122989	somebody	896	” But the debate was a formal skirmishing , a pastime to gain breathing - space . Like all people brought up in a tradition , Katharine was able , within ten minutes or so , to reduce any moral difficulty to its traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers . The book of wisdom lay open , if not upon her mother ’s knee , upon the knees of many uncles and aunts . She had only to consult them , and they would at once turn to the right page and read out an answer exactly suited to one in her position . The rules which should govern the behavior of an unmarried woman are written in red ink , graved upon marble , if , by some freak of nature , it should fall out that the unmarried woman has not the same writing scored upon her heart . She was ready to believe that some people are fortunate enough to reject , accept , resign , or lay down their lives at the bidding of traditional authority ; she could envy them ; but in her case the questions became phantoms directly she tried seriously to find an answer , which proved that the traditional answer would be of no use to her individually . Yet it had served so many people , she thought , glancing at the rows of houses on either side of her , where families , whose incomes must be between a thousand and fifteen - hundred a year lived , and kept , perhaps , three servants , and draped their windows with curtains which were always thick and generally dirty , and must , she thought , since you could only see a looking - glass gleaming above a sideboard on which a dish of apples was set , keep the room inside very dark . But she turned her head away , observing that this was not a method of thinking the matter out . The only truth which she could discover was the truth of what she herself felt — a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination shed by the eyes of all the people who are in agreement to see together ; but having rejected the visionary voices , she had no choice but to make this her guide through the dark masses which confronted her . She tried to follow her beam , with an expression upon her face which would have made any passer - by think her reprehensibly and almost ridiculously detached from the surrounding scene . One would have felt alarmed lest this young and striking woman were about to do something eccentric . But her beauty saved her from the worst fate that can befall a pedestrian ; people looked at her , but they did not laugh . To seek a true feeling among the chaos of the unfeelings or half - feelings of life , to recognize it when found , and to accept the consequences of the discovery , draws lines upon the smoothest brow , while it quickens the light of the eyes ; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering , debasing , and exalting , and , as Katharine speedily found , her discoveries gave her equal cause for surprise , shame , and intense anxiety . Much depended , as usual , upon the interpretation of the word love ; which word came up again and again , whether she considered Rodney , Denham , Mary Datchet , or herself ; and in each case it seemed to stand for something different , and yet for something unmistakable and something not to be passed by . For the more she looked into the confusion of lives which , instead of running parallel , had suddenly intersected each other , the more distinctly she seemed to convince herself that there was no other light on them than was shed by this strange illumination , and no other path save the one upon which it threw its beams . Her blindness in the case of Rodney , her attempt to match his true feeling with her false feeling , was a failure never to be sufficiently condemned ; indeed , she could only pay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion or excuse . With this to humiliate there was much to exalt . She thought of three different scenes ; she thought of Mary sitting upright and saying , “
124231	125348	122989	122989	somebody	896	” ; she thought of Rodney losing his self - consciousness among the dead leaves , and speaking with the abandonment of a child ; she thought of Denham leaning upon the stone parapet and talking to the distant sky , so that she thought him mad . Her mind , passing from Mary to Denham , from William to Cassandra , and from Denham to herself — if , as she rather doubted , Denham ’s state of mind was connected with herself — seemed to be tracing out the lines of some symmetrical pattern , some arrangement of life , which invested , if not herself , at least the others , not only with interest , but with a kind of tragic beauty . She had a fantastic picture of them upholding splendid palaces upon their bent backs . They were the lantern - bearers , whose lights , scattered among the crowd , wove a pattern , dissolving , joining , meeting again in combination . Half forming such conceptions as these in her rapid walk along the dreary streets of South Kensington , she determined that , whatever else might be obscure , she must further the objects of Mary , Denham , William , and Cassandra . The way was not apparent . No course of action seemed to her indubitably right . All she achieved by her thinking was the conviction that , in such a cause , no risk was too great ; and that , far from making any rules for herself or others , she would let difficulties accumulate unsolved , situations widen their jaws unsatiated , while she maintained a position of absolute and fearless independence . So she could best serve the people who loved . Read in the light of this exaltation , there was a new meaning in the words which her mother had penciled upon the card attached to the bunch of anemones . The door of the house in the Cromwell Road opened ; gloomy vistas of passage and staircase were revealed ; such light as there was seemed to be concentrated upon a silver salver of visiting - cards , whose black borders suggested that the widow ’s friends had all suffered the same bereavement . The parlor - maid could hardly be expected to fathom the meaning of the grave tone in which the young lady proffered the flowers , with Mrs. Hilbery ’s love ; and the door shut upon the offering . The sight of a face , the slam of a door , are both rather destructive of exaltation in the abstract ; and , as she walked back to Chelsea , Katharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves . If you can not make sure of people , however , you can hold fairly fast to figures , and in some way or other her thought about such problems as she was wo nt to consider worked in happily with her mood as to her friends ’ lives . She reached home rather late for tea . On the ancient Dutch chest in the hall she perceived one or two hats , coats , and walking - sticks , and the sound of voices reached her as she stood outside the drawing - room door . Her mother gave a little cry as she came in ; a cry which conveyed to Katharine the fact that she was late , that the teacups and milk - jugs were in a conspiracy of disobedience , and that she must immediately take her place at the head of the table and pour out tea for the guests . Augustus Pelham , the diarist , liked a calm atmosphere in which to tell his stories ; he liked attention ; he liked to elicit little facts , little stories , about the past and the great dead , from such distinguished characters as Mrs. Hilbery for the nourishment of his diary , for whose sake he frequented tea - tables and ate yearly an enormous quantity of buttered toast . He , therefore , welcomed Katharine with relief , and she had merely to shake hands with Rodney and to greet the American lady who had come to be shown the relics , before the talk started again on the broad lines of reminiscence and discussion which were familiar to her . Yet , even with this thick veil between them , she could not help looking at Rodney , as if she could detect what had happened to him since they met . It was in vain . His clothes , even the white slip , the pearl in his tie , seemed to intercept her quick glance , and to proclaim the futility of such inquiries of a discreet , urbane gentleman , who balanced his cup of tea and poised a slice of bread and butter on the edge of the saucer . He would not meet her eye , but that could be accounted for by his activity in serving and helping , and the polite alacrity with which he was answering the questions of the American visitor . It was certainly a sight to daunt any one coming in with a head full of theories about love . The voices of the invisible questioners were reinforced by the scene round the table , and sounded with a tremendous self - confidence , as if they had behind them the common sense of twenty generations , together with the immediate approval of Mr. Augustus Pelham , Mrs. Vermont Bankes , William Rodney , and , possibly , Mrs. Hilbery herself . Katharine set her teeth , not entirely in the metaphorical sense , for her hand , obeying the impulse towards definite action , laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had been grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness . The address was uppermost , and a moment later she saw William ’s eye rest upon it as he rose to fulfil some duty with a plate . His expression instantly changed . He did what he was on the point of doing , and then looked at Katharine with a look which revealed enough of his confusion to show her that he was not entirely represented by his appearance . In a minute or two he proved himself at a loss with Mrs. Vermont Bankes , and Mrs. Hilbery , aware of the silence with her usual quickness , suggested that , perhaps , it was now time that Mrs. Bankes should be shown “
125352	125396	124228	124228	I’m	0	” Katharine accordingly rose , and led the way to the little inner room with the pictures and the books . Mrs. Bankes and Rodney followed her . She turned on the lights , and began directly in her low , pleasant voice : “
125430	125446	125420	125420	his	2938	” She took it in her hand and paused for the right number of seconds . “
125449	125453	125420	125420	his	2938	” she continued , “
125491	125522	125489	125489	yourself	2181	” she added , as Mrs. Bankes asked , in an awestruck tone of voice , for that privilege , and began a preliminary unbuttoning of her white kid gloves . “
125533	125546	125530	125531	Miss Hilbery	129	” the American lady observed , gazing from Katharine to the portrait , “
125567	125579	125565	125565	she	0	” she asked in a jocular tone , turning to William . “
125649	126028	125644	125644	His	2954	” Laying aside the manuscript , she hastily grasped the old shoes , and remained for a moment dumb in contemplation of them . While Katharine went on steadily with her duties as show - woman , Rodney examined intently a row of little drawings which he knew by heart already . His disordered state of mind made it necessary for him to take advantage of these little respites , as if he had been out in a high wind and must straighten his dress in the first shelter he reached . His calm was only superficial , as he knew too well ; it did not exist much below the surface of tie , waistcoat , and white slip . On getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind to ignore what had been said the night before ; he had been convinced , by the sight of Denham , that his love for Katharine was passionate , and when he addressed her early that morning on the telephone , he had meant his cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to her the fact that , after a night of madness , they were as indissolubly engaged as ever . But when he reached his office his torments began . He found a letter from Cassandra waiting for him . She had read his play , and had taken the very first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of it . She knew , she wrote , that her praise meant absolutely nothing ; but still , she had sat up all night ; she thought this , that , and the other ; she was full of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places , but enough was written plain to gratify William ’s vanity exceedingly . She was quite intelligent enough to say the right things , or , even more charmingly , to hint at them . In other ways , too , it was a very charming letter . She told him about her music , and about a Suffrage meeting to which Henry had taken her , and she asserted , half seriously , that she had learnt the Greek alphabet , and found it “
126031	126986	125644	125644	His	2954	” The word was underlined . Had she laughed when she drew that line ? Was she ever serious ? Did n’t the letter show the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality , all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness , which flitted , for the rest of the morning , as a will - o’-the - wisp , across Rodney ’s landscape . He could not resist beginning an answer to her there and then . He found it particularly delightful to shape a style which should express the bowing and curtsying , advancing and retreating , which are characteristic of one of the many million partnerships of men and women . Katharine never trod that particular measure , he could not help reflecting ; Katharine — Cassandra ; Cassandra — Katharine — they alternated in his consciousness all day long . It was all very well to dress oneself carefully , compose one ’s face , and start off punctually at half - past four to a tea - party in Cheyne Walk , but Heaven only knew what would come of it all , and when Katharine , after sitting silent with her usual immobility , wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table beneath his eyes a letter addressed to Cassandra herself , his composure deserted him . What did she mean by her behavior ? He looked up sharply from his row of little pictures . Katharine was disposing of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion . Surely the victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms appeared in the eyes of the poet ’s granddaughter . Katharine never made any attempt to spare people ’s feelings , he reflected ; and , being himself very sensitive to all shades of comfort and discomfort , he cut short the auctioneer ’s catalog , which Katharine was reeling off more and more absent - mindedly , and took Mrs. Vermont Bankes , with a queer sense of fellowship in suffering , under his own protection . But within a few minutes the American lady had completed her inspection , and inclining her head in a little nod of reverential farewell to the poet and his shoes , she was escorted downstairs by Rodney . Katharine stayed by herself in the little room . The ceremony of ancestor - worship had been more than usually oppressive to her . Moreover , the room was becoming crowded beyond the bounds of order . Only that morning a heavily insured proof - sheet had reached them from a collector in Australia , which recorded a change of the poet ’s mind about a very famous phrase , and , therefore , had claims to the honor of glazing and framing . But was there room for it ? Must it be hung on the staircase , or should some other relic give place to do it honor ? Feeling unable to decide the question , Katharine glanced at the portrait of her grandfather , as if to ask his opinion . The artist who had painted it was now out of fashion , and by dint of showing it to visitors , Katharine had almost ceased to see anything but a glow of faintly pleasing pink and brown tints , enclosed within a circular scroll of gilt laurel - leaves . The young man who was her grandfather looked vaguely over her head . The sensual lips were slightly parted , and gave the face an expression of beholding something lovely or miraculous vanishing or just rising upon the rim of the distance . The expression repeated itself curiously upon Katharine ’s face as she gazed up into his . They were the same age , or very nearly so . She wondered what he was looking for ; were there waves beating upon a shore for him , too , she wondered , and heroes riding through the leaf - hung forests ? For perhaps the first time in her life she thought of him as a man , young , unhappy , tempestuous , full of desires and faults ; for the first time she realized him for herself , and not from her mother ’s memory . He might have been her brother , she thought . It seemed to her that they were akin , with the mysterious kinship of blood which makes it seem possible to interpret the sights which the eyes of the dead behold so intently , or even to believe that they look with us upon our present joys and sorrows . He would have understood , she thought , suddenly ; and instead of laying her withered flowers upon his shrine , she brought him her own perplexities — perhaps a gift of greater value , should the dead be conscious of gifts , than flowers and incense and adoration . Doubts , questionings , and despondencies she felt , as she looked up , would be more welcome to him than homage , and he would hold them but a very small burden if she gave him , also , some share in what she suffered and achieved . The depth of her own pride and love were not more apparent to her than the sense that the dead asked neither flowers nor regrets , but a share in the life which they had given her , the life which they had lived . Rodney found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfather ’s portrait . She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way , and said : “
127010	127011	127002	127002	I	0	” “
127021	127026	127012	127012	You	0	” he returned dryly . “
127040	127336	127034	127034	I’ve	0	” She told him how she had taken the flowers to Mrs. McCormick , and how South Kensington impressed her as the preserve of officers ’ widows . She described how the door had opened , and what gloomy avenues of busts and palm - trees and umbrellas had been revealed to her . She spoke lightly , and succeeded in putting him at his ease . Indeed , he rapidly became too much at his ease to persist in a condition of cheerful neutrality . He felt his composure slipping from him . Katharine made it seem so natural to ask her to help him , or advise him , to say straight out what he had in his mind . The letter from Cassandra was heavy in his pocket . There was also the letter to Cassandra lying on the table in the next room . The atmosphere seemed charged with Cassandra . But , unless Katharine began the subject of her own accord , he could not even hint — he must ignore the whole affair ; it was the part of a gentleman to preserve a bearing that was , as far as he could make it , the bearing of an undoubting lover . At intervals he sighed deeply . He talked rather more quickly than usual about the possibility that some of the operas of Mozart would be played in the summer . He had received a notice , he said , and at once produced a pocket - book stuffed with papers , and began shuffling them in search . He held a thick envelope between his finger and thumb , as if the notice from the opera company had become in some way inseparably attached to it . “
127342	127359	127340	127340	Cassandra	303	” said Katharine , in the easiest voice in the world , looking over his shoulder . “
127378	127413	127372	127372	I	0	” He handed her the envelope in silence . She took it , extracted the sheets , and read the letter through . The reading seemed to Rodney to take an intolerably long time . “
127416	127422	127372	127372	I	0	” she observed at length , “
127428	127461	127372	127372	I	0	” Rodney ’s face was half turned away , as if in bashfulness . Her view of his profile almost moved her to laughter . She glanced through the pages once more . “
127467	127472	127372	127372	I	0	” William blurted out , “
127493	127494	127532	127532	she	303	” “
127505	127515	127500	127500	she	303	” said Katharine , consulting the pages once more . “
127536	127537	127532	127532	she	303	” “
127625	127626	127648	127648	Katharine	129	” “
127632	127633	127648	127648	Katharine	129	” “
127669	127673	127674	127674	you	129	” he floundered , “
127711	127855	127856	127856	She	2191	” She was surprised by the violence of her desire that he never should think of it again . For an instant it seemed to her impossible to surrender an intimacy , which might not be the intimacy of love , but was certainly the intimacy of true friendship , to any woman in the world . Cassandra would never understand him — she was not good enough for him . The letter seemed to her a letter of flattery — a letter addressed to his weakness , which it made her angry to think was known to another . For he was not weak ; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised — she had only to speak , and he would never think of Cassandra again . She paused . Rodney guessed the reason . He was amazed . “
127860	128129	127856	127856	She	2191	” he thought . The woman he admired more than any one in the world , loved him , as he had given up hope that she would ever love him . And now that for the first time he was sure of her love , he resented it . He felt it as a fetter , an encumbrance , something which made them both , but him in particular , ridiculous . He was in her power completely , but his eyes were open and he was no longer her slave or her dupe . He would be her master in future . The instant prolonged itself as Katharine realized the strength of her desire to speak the words that should keep William for ever , and the baseness of the temptation which assailed her to make the movement , or speak the word , which he had often begged her for , which she was now near enough to feeling . She held the letter in her hand . She sat silent . At this moment there was a stir in the other room ; the voice of Mrs. Hilbery was heard talking of proof - sheets rescued by miraculous providence from butcher ’s ledgers in Australia ; the curtain separating one room from the other was drawn apart , and Mrs. Hilbery and Augustus Pelham stood in the doorway . Mrs. Hilbery stopped short . She looked at her daughter , and at the man her daughter was to marry , with her peculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on the brink of satire . “
128140	128144	128149	128149	Katharine	129	” she exclaimed . “
128163	128214	128156	128157	Mr. Pelham	208	” Mr. Pelham looked , smiled , bowed , and , as his hostess had moved on , followed her without a word . The curtain was drawn again either by him or by Mrs. Hilbery . But her mother had settled the question somehow . Katharine doubted no longer . “
128222	128226	128216	128216	I	0	” she said , “
128282	128283	128275	128275	We	2192	” “
128294	128312	128288	128288	your	0	” said Rodney , with an immediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor . “
128316	128352	128288	128288	your	0	” said Katharine . Directly he left her she would go to her mother , and explain that the engagement was at an end — or it might be better that they should go together ? “
128357	128373	128355	128355	Katharine	129	” Rodney began , nervously attempting to stuff Cassandra ’s sheets back into their envelope ; “
128388	128389	128380	128380	you’ve	0	” “
128400	128607	128393	128393	I	0	” He crossed his knees in a discomfited silence . By all his codes it was impossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken off his engagement to help him to become acquainted with another woman with a view to his falling in love with her . If it was announced that their engagement was over , a long and complete separation would inevitably follow ; in those circumstances , letters and gifts were returned ; after years of distance the severed couple met , perhaps at an evening party , and touched hands uncomfortably with an indifferent word or two . He would be cast off completely ; he would have to trust to his own resources . He could never mention Cassandra to Katharine again ; for months , and doubtless years , he would never see Katharine again ; anything might happen to her in his absence . Katharine was almost as well aware of his perplexities as he was . She knew in what direction complete generosity pointed the way ; but pride — for to remain engaged to Rodney and to cover his experiments hurt what was nobler in her than mere vanity — fought for its life . “
128620	128624	128393	128393	I	0	” she thought , “
128680	128911	128673	128673	He	176	” When she reached this point , Rodney pocketed the letter and elaborately looked at his watch . Although the action meant that he resigned Cassandra , for he knew his own incompetence and distrusted himself entirely , and lost Katharine , for whom his feeling was profound though unsatisfactory , still it appeared to him that there was nothing else left for him to do . He was forced to go , leaving Katharine free , as he had said , to tell her mother that the engagement was at an end . But to do what plain duty required of an honorable man , cost an effort which only a day or two ago would have been inconceivable to him . That a relationship such as he had glanced at with desire could be possible between him and Katharine , he would have been the first , two days ago , to deny with indignation . But now his life had changed ; his attitude had changed ; his feelings were different ; new aims and possibilities had been shown him , and they had an almost irresistible fascination and force . The training of a life of thirty - five years had not left him defenceless ; he was still master of his dignity ; he rose , with a mind made up to an irrevocable farewell . “
128918	128942	128966	128966	You	0	” he said , standing up and holding out his hand with an effort that left him pale , but lent him dignity , “
128956	128965	128966	128966	You	0	” She took his hand and held it . “
128972	128976	128966	128966	You	0	” she said . “
128982	128986	128977	128977	I	0	” he replied . “
129003	129004	128998	128998	I	0	” “
129012	129044	129009	129009	your	2196	” he exclaimed passionately , but withdrew his hand and turned his back . When he faced her , she thought that she saw him for the first time without disguise . “
129102	129107	129093	129093	your	2196	” he broke off , “
129128	129129	129093	129093	your	2196	” “
129139	129140	129141	129141	Your	2196	” “
129148	129152	129141	129141	Your	2196	” he groaned . “
129158	129159	129153	129153	I	0	” “
129168	129172	129164	129164	I	0	” he exclaimed . “
129208	129209	129211	129211	yours	2196	” “
129214	129215	129211	129211	yours	2196	” “
129276	129277	129301	129302	Your father	1101	” “
129299	129300	129301	129302	Your father	1101	” “
129315	129316	129317	129317	My	0	” “
129327	129328	129317	129318	My father	2986	” “
129338	129342	129317	129318	My father	2986	” Rodney groaned ; “
129388	129389	129390	129390	We	2200	” “
129397	129402	129390	129390	We	2200	” she said impatiently , “
129419	129423	129413	129413	I	0	” she proceeded . “
129464	129465	129466	129466	Katharine	129	” “
129477	129478	129471	129471	You	129	” “
129484	129489	129480	129480	I	0	” she said stoutly . “
129541	129542	129516	129516	You	129	” “
129551	129751	129516	129516	You	129	” Rodney groaned , as he reviewed the situation into which her Christian doctrine was plunging them . And yet he could not deny that a divine relief possessed him , and that the future , instead of wearing a lead - colored mask , now blossomed with a thousand varied gaieties and excitements . He was actually to see Cassandra within a week or perhaps less , and he was more anxious to know the date of her arrival than he could own even to himself . It seemed base to be so anxious to pluck this fruit of Katharine ’s unexampled generosity and of his own contemptible baseness . And yet , though he used these words automatically , they had now no meaning . He was not debased in his own eyes by what he had done , and as for praising Katharine , were they not partners , conspirators , people bent upon the same quest together , so that to praise the pursuit of a common end as an act of generosity was meaningless . He took her hand and pressed it , not in thanks so much as in an ecstasy of comradeship . “
129758	129789	129790	129790	He	2211	” he said , repeating her words , seeking her eyes in an enthusiasm of friendship . Her eyes were grave but dark with sadness as they rested on him . “
129795	129799	129803	129803	he	2211	” she thought , “
129810	129949	129803	129803	he	2211	” And the fancy came to her that , as they sat side by side , hand in hand , she could hear the earth pouring from above to make a barrier between them , so that , as they sat , they were separated second by second by an impenetrable wall . The process , which affected her as that of being sealed away and for ever from all companionship with the person she cared for most , came to an end at last , and by common consent they unclasped their fingers , Rodney touching hers with his lips , as the curtain parted , and Mrs. Hilbery peered through the opening with her benevolent and sarcastic expression to ask whether Katharine could remember was it Tuesday or Wednesday , and did she dine in Westminster ? “
129953	129983	129951	129951	William	176	” she said , pausing , as if she could not resist the pleasure of encroaching for a second upon this wonderful world of love and confidence and romance . “
129987	130584	129984	129985	Dearest children	2212	” she added , disappearing with an impulsive gesture , as if she forced herself to draw the curtain upon a scene which she refused all temptation to interrupt . At a quarter - past three in the afternoon of the following Saturday Ralph Denham sat on the bank of the lake in Kew Gardens , dividing the dial - plate of his watch into sections with his forefinger . The just and inexorable nature of time itself was reflected in his face . He might have been composing a hymn to the unhasting and unresting march of that divinity . He seemed to greet the lapse of minute after minute with stern acquiescence in the inevitable order . His expression was so severe , so serene , so immobile , that it seemed obvious that for him at least there was a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty irritation on his part was to mar , although the wasting time wasted also high private hopes of his own . His face was no bad index to what went on within him . He was in a condition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily life . He could not accept the fact that a lady was fifteen minutes late in keeping her appointment without seeing in that accident the frustration of his entire life . Looking at his watch , he seemed to look deep into the springs of human existence , and by the light of what he saw there altered his course towards the north and the midnight .... Yes , one ’s voyage must be made absolutely without companions through ice and black water — towards what goal ? Here he laid his finger upon the half - hour , and decided that when the minute - hand reached that point he would go , at the same time answering the question put by another of the many voices of consciousness with the reply that there was undoubtedly a goal , but that it would need the most relentless energy to keep anywhere in its direction . Still , still , one goes on , the ticking seconds seemed to assure him , with dignity , with open eyes , with determination not to accept the second - rate , not to be tempted by the unworthy , not to yield , not to compromise . Twenty - five minutes past three were now marked upon the face of the watch . The world , he assured himself , since Katharine Hilbery was now half an hour behind her time , offers no happiness , no rest from struggle , no certainty . In a scheme of things utterly bad from the start the only unpardonable folly is that of hope . Raising his eyes for a moment from the face of his watch , he rested them upon the opposite bank , reflectively and not without a certain wistfulness , as if the sternness of their gaze were still capable of mitigation . Soon a look of the deepest satisfaction filled them , though , for a moment , he did not move . He watched a lady who came rapidly , and yet with a trace of hesitation , down the broad grass - walk towards him . She did not see him . Distance lent her figure an indescribable height , and romance seemed to surround her from the floating of a purple veil which the light air filled and curved from her shoulders . “
130596	130675	130586	130586	she	2213	” he said to himself , half remembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down thus with feathers flying and airs saluting her . The greenery and the high presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at her coming . He rose , and she saw him ; her little exclamation proved that she was glad to find him , and then that she blamed herself for being late . “
130691	130744	130745	130745	You	0	” she remarked , alluding to the lake , the broad green space , the vista of trees , with the ruffled gold of the Thames in the distance and the Ducal castle standing in its meadows . She paid the rigid tail of the Ducal lion the tribute of incredulous laughter . “
130752	130886	130745	130745	You	0	” Denham remarked . But it appeared that she had come once as a small child , when the geography of the place was entirely different , and the fauna included certainly flamingoes and , possibly , camels . They strolled on , refashioning these legendary gardens . She was , as he felt , glad merely to stroll and loiter and let her fancy touch upon anything her eyes encountered — a bush , a park - keeper , a decorated goose — as if the relaxation soothed her . The warmth of the afternoon , the first of spring , tempted them to sit upon a seat in a glade of beech - trees , with forest drives striking green paths this way and that around them . She sighed deeply . “
130892	131972	130745	130745	You	0	” she said , as if in explanation of her sigh . Not a single person was in sight , and the stir of the wind in the branches , that sound so seldom heard by Londoners , seemed to her as if wafted from fathomless oceans of sweet air in the distance . While she breathed and looked , Denham was engaged in uncovering with the point of his stick a group of green spikes half smothered by the dead leaves . He did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist . In naming the little green plant to her he used the Latin name , thus disguising some flower familiar even to Chelsea , and making her exclaim , half in amusement , at his knowledge . Her own ignorance was vast , she confessed . What did one call that tree opposite , for instance , supposing one condescended to call it by its English name ? Beech or elm or sycamore ? It chanced , by the testimony of a dead leaf , to be oak ; and a little attention to a diagram which Denham proceeded to draw upon an envelope soon put Katharine in possession of some of the fundamental distinctions between our British trees . She then asked him to inform her about flowers . To her they were variously shaped and colored petals , poised , at different seasons of the year , upon very similar green stalks ; but to him they were , in the first instance , bulbs or seeds , and later , living things endowed with sex , and pores , and susceptibilities which adapted themselves by all manner of ingenious devices to live and beget life , and could be fashioned squat or tapering , flame - colored or pale , pure or spotted , by processes which might reveal the secrets of human existence . Denham spoke with increasing ardor of a hobby which had long been his in secret . No discourse could have worn a more welcome sound in Katharine ’s ears . For weeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant music in her mind . It wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses of her being where loneliness had brooded so long undisturbed . She wished he would go on for ever talking of plants , and showing her how science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled their endless variations . A law that might be inscrutable but was certainly omnipotent appealed to her at the moment , because she could find nothing like it in possession of human lives . Circumstances had long forced her , as they force most women in the flower of youth , to consider , painfully and minutely , all that part of life which is conspicuously without order ; she had had to consider moods and wishes , degrees of liking or disliking , and their effect upon the destiny of people dear to her ; she had been forced to deny herself any contemplation of that other part of life where thought constructs a destiny which is independent of human beings . As Denham spoke , she followed his words and considered their bearing with an easy vigor which spoke of a capacity long hoarded and unspent . The very trees and the green merging into the blue distance became symbols of the vast external world which recks so little of the happiness , of the marriages or deaths of individuals . In order to give her examples of what he was saying , Denham led the way , first to the Rock Garden , and then to the Orchid House . For him there was safety in the direction which the talk had taken . His emphasis might come from feelings more personal than those science roused in him , but it was disguised , and naturally he found it easy to expound and explain . Nevertheless , when he saw Katharine among the orchids , her beauty strangely emphasized by the fantastic plants , which seemed to peer and gape at her from striped hoods and fleshy throats , his ardor for botany waned , and a more complex feeling replaced it . She fell silent . The orchids seemed to suggest absorbing reflections . In defiance of the rules she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one . The sight of the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably that he started and turned away . But next moment he controlled himself ; he looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with the contemplative , considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly what is before him , but gropes in regions that lie beyond it . The far - away look entirely lacked self - consciousness . Denham doubted whether she remembered his presence . He could recall himself , of course , by a word or a movement — but why ? She was happier thus . She needed nothing that he could give her . And for him , too , perhaps , it was best to keep aloof , only to know that she existed , to preserve what he already had — perfect , remote , and unbroken . Further , her still look , standing among the orchids in that hot atmosphere , strangely illustrated some scene that he had imagined in his room at home . The sight , mingling with his recollection , kept him silent when the door was shut and they were walking on again . But though she did not speak , Katharine had an uneasy sense that silence on her part was selfishness . It was selfish of her to continue , as she wished to do , a discussion of subjects not remotely connected with any human beings . She roused herself to consider their exact position upon the turbulent map of the emotions . Oh yes — it was a question whether Ralph Denham should live in the country and write a book ; it was getting late ; they must waste no more time ; Cassandra arrived to - night for dinner ; she flinched and roused herself , and discovered that she ought to be holding something in her hands . But they were empty . She held them out with an exclamation . “
131982	132084	131973	131973	I	0	” The gardens had no points of the compass , so far as she was concerned . She had been walking for the most part on grass — that was all she knew . Even the road to the Orchid House had now split itself into three . But there was no bag in the Orchid House . It must , therefore , have been left upon the seat . They retraced their steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think about something that is lost . What did this bag look like ? What did it contain ? “
132096	132265	132334	132334	I	0	” Katharine counted , becoming more agitated as she recalled the list . Denham went on quickly in advance of her , and she heard him shout that he had found it before she reached the seat . In order to make sure that all was safe she spread the contents on her knee . It was a queer collection , Denham thought , gazing with the deepest interest . Loose gold coins were tangled in a narrow strip of lace ; there were letters which somehow suggested the extreme of intimacy ; there were two or three keys , and lists of commissions against which crosses were set at intervals . But she did not seem satisfied until she had made sure of a certain paper so folded that Denham could not judge what it contained . In her relief and gratitude she began at once to say that she had been thinking over what Denham had told her of his plans . He cut her short . “

132351	132358	132359	132359	I	0	” he continued , more amiably , “

132404	132419	132397	132397	I	0	” she began , remembering how often William had brought this charge against her . “

132941	132946	132963	132963	you	0	” Denham replied abruptly . “
132952	132956	132963	132963	you	0	” she inquired . “
132966	132970	132958	132958	you	0	” he expostulated . “
132976	133095	132971	132971	You	2245	” she said , laughing and looking at him . How arbitrary , hot - tempered , and imperious he was ! He had asked her to come to Kew to advise him ; he then told her that he had settled the question already ; he then proceeded to find fault with her . He was the very opposite of William Rodney , she thought ; he was shabby , his clothes were badly made , he was ill versed in the amenities of life ; he was tongue - tied and awkward to the verge of obliterating his real character . He was awkwardly silent ; he was awkwardly emphatic . And yet she liked him . “
133104	133111	133101	133101	I	0	” she repeated good - humoredly . “
133115	133116	133101	133101	I	0	” “
133129	133261	133117	133117	I	0	” he answered significantly . She flushed . He had penetrated at once to the weak spot — her engagement , and had reason for what he said . He was not altogether justified now , at any rate , she was glad to remember ; but she could not enlighten him and must bear his insinuations , though from the lips of a man who had behaved as he had behaved their force should not have been sharp . Nevertheless , what he said had its force , she mused ; partly because he seemed unconscious of his own lapse in the case of Mary Datchet , and thus baffled her insight ; partly because he always spoke with force , for what reason she did not yet feel certain . “
133273	133283	133270	133270	you	2246	” she inquired , with a touch of irony . “
133293	133473	133286	133291	people one credits even with that	2247	” he replied a little vaguely . He was ashamed of his savage wish to hurt her , and yet it was not for the sake of hurting her , who was beyond his shafts , but in order to mortify his own incredibly reckless impulse of abandonment to the spirit which seemed , at moments , about to rush him to the uttermost ends of the earth . She affected him beyond the scope of his wildest dreams . He seemed to see that beneath the quiet surface of her manner , which was almost pathetically at hand and within reach for all the trivial demands of daily life , there was a spirit which she reserved or repressed for some reason either of loneliness or — could it be possible — of love . Was it given to Rodney to see her unmasked , unrestrained , unconscious of her duties ? a creature of uncalculating passion and instinctive freedom ? No ; he refused to believe it . It was in her loneliness that Katharine was unreserved . “
133490	133682	133483	133483	I	0	” She had said that to him , and in saying it had given him a glimpse of possibilities , even of confidences , as if he might be the one to share her loneliness , the mere hint of which made his heart beat faster and his brain spin . He checked himself as brutally as he could . He saw her redden , and in the irony of her reply he heard her resentment . He began slipping his smooth , silver watch in his pocket , in the hope that somehow he might help himself back to that calm and fatalistic mood which had been his when he looked at its face upon the bank of the lake , for that mood must , at whatever cost , be the mood of his intercourse with Katharine . He had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence in the letter which he had never sent , and now all the force of his character must make good those vows in her presence . She , thus challenged , tried meanwhile to define her points . She wished to make Denham understand . “
133704	133708	133685	133685	you	2249	” she inquired . “
133769	133838	133839	133839	I	0	” Her reasoning suspended itself a little inconclusively , for the subject was complex , and she found herself in ignorance whether Denham had a family or not . Denham was agreed with her as to the destructiveness of the family system , but he did not wish to discuss the problem at that moment . He turned to a problem which was of greater interest to him . “
133843	133847	133839	133839	I	0	” he said , “
133890	133891	133839	133839	I	0	” “
133897	133905	133839	133839	I	0	” she agreed , a little despondently . “
133934	133948	133839	133839	I	0	end”—in the condition in which she found herself , she meant , but added lamely—“in
133952	133953	133926	133926	they	383	” “
133956	133961	133962	133962	they	383	” Denham instantly intervened , “
133980	133998	133839	133839	I	0	” he continued , with a reasonable intonation which did much credit to his self - control , “
134015	134093	133839	133839	I	0	” She was curious to hear them , but , besides feeling that the topic concealed dangers better known to her than to him , she was reminded by his tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the Embankment . Anything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her ; it was as much an infliction to her as the rubbing of a skinless wound . But he went on , without waiting for her invitation . “
134106	134113	133839	133839	I	0	” he laid it down emphatically . “
134185	134186	134167	134167	They	2260	” “
134194	134198	134167	134167	They	2260	” she asked . “
134211	134233	134167	134167	They	2260	” he replied . The word was one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with herself of late . “
134248	134252	134242	134242	you	2261	” he concluded . “
134261	134266	134242	134242	you	2261	” she said reflectively . “
134269	134273	134242	134242	you	2261	” he said , “
134287	134322	134281	134281	I	0	” She had known that this was coming , but , none the less , felt a little shock , half of pleasure , half of reluctance , when she heard the formal statement . “
134328	134332	134281	134281	I	0	” she began , “
134335	134336	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” “
134341	134342	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” “
134346	134351	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” she replied quickly . “
134361	134718	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” she went on , and again came to an end . She had been touched by the unreserved and yet ceremonious way in which he had made what he called his offer of terms , but if he was generous it was the more necessary for her to be cautious . They would find themselves in difficulties , she speculated ; but , at this point , which was not very far , after all , upon the road of caution , her foresight deserted her . She sought for some definite catastrophe into which they must inevitably plunge . But she could think of none . It seemed to her that these catastrophes were fictitious ; life went on and on — life was different altogether from what people said . And not only was she at an end of her stock of caution , but it seemed suddenly altogether superfluous . Surely if any one could take care of himself , Ralph Denham could ; he had told her that he did not love her . And , further , she meditated , walking on beneath the beech - trees and swinging her umbrella , as in her thought she was accustomed to complete freedom , why should she perpetually apply so different a standard to her behavior in practice ? Why , she reflected , should there be this perpetual disparity between the thought and the action , between the life of solitude and the life of society , this astonishing precipice on one side of which the soul was active and in broad daylight , on the other side of which it was contemplative and dark as night ? Was it not possible to step from one to the other , erect , and without essential change ? Was this not the chance he offered her — the rare and wonderful chance of friendship ? At any rate , she told Denham , with a sigh in which he heard both impatience and relief , that she agreed ; she thought him right ; she would accept his terms of friendship . “
134721	134725	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” she said , “
134733	135799	134338	134338	Rodney	176	” In fact , these principles having been laid down , a great lightness of spirit showed itself in both of them . They were both convinced that something of profound importance had been settled , and could now give their attention to their tea and the Gardens . They wandered in and out of glass - houses , saw lilies swimming in tanks , breathed in the scent of thousands of carnations , and compared their respective tastes in the matter of trees and lakes . While talking exclusively of what they saw , so that any one might have overheard them , they felt that the compact between them was made firmer and deeper by the number of people who passed them and suspected nothing of the kind . The question of Ralph ’s cottage and future was not mentioned again . Although the old coaches , with their gay panels and the guard ’s horn , and the humors of the box and the vicissitudes of the road , have long moldered into dust so far as they were matter , and are preserved in the printed pages of our novelists so far as they partook of the spirit , a journey to London by express train can still be a very pleasant and romantic adventure . Cassandra Otway , at the age of twenty - two , could imagine few things more pleasant . Satiated with months of green fields as she was , the first row of artisans ’ villas on the outskirts of London seemed to have something serious about it , which positively increased the importance of every person in the railway carriage , and even , to her impressionable mind , quickened the speed of the train and gave a note of stern authority to the shriek of the engine - whistle . They were bound for London ; they must have precedence of all traffic not similarly destined . A different demeanor was necessary directly one stepped out upon Liverpool Street platform , and became one of those preoccupied and hasty citizens for whose needs innumerable taxi - cabs , motor - omnibuses , and underground railways were in waiting . She did her best to look dignified and preoccupied too , but as the cab carried her away , with a determination which alarmed her a little , she became more and more forgetful of her station as a citizen of London , and turned her head from one window to another , picking up eagerly a building on this side or a street scene on that to feed her intense curiosity . And yet , while the drive lasted no one was real , nothing was ordinary ; the crowds , the Government buildings , the tide of men and women washing the base of the great glass windows , were all generalized , and affected her as if she saw them on the stage . All these feelings were sustained and partly inspired by the fact that her journey took her straight to the center of her most romantic world . A thousand times in the midst of her pastoral landscape her thoughts took this precise road , were admitted to the house in Chelsea , and went directly upstairs to Katharine ’s room , where , invisible themselves , they had the better chance of feasting upon the privacy of the room ’s adorable and mysterious mistress . Cassandra adored her cousin ; the adoration might have been foolish , but was saved from that excess and lent an engaging charm by the volatile nature of Cassandra ’s temperament . She had adored a great many things and people in the course of twenty - two years ; she had been alternately the pride and the desperation of her teachers . She had worshipped architecture and music , natural history and humanity , literature and art , but always at the height of her enthusiasm , which was accompanied by a brilliant degree of accomplishment , she changed her mind and bought , surreptitiously , another grammar . The terrible results which governesses had predicted from such mental dissipation were certainly apparent now that Cassandra was twenty - two , and had never passed an examination , and daily showed herself less and less capable of passing one . The more serious prediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also verified . But from all these short strands of different accomplishments Cassandra wove for herself an attitude , a cast of mind , which , if useless , was found by some people to have the not despicable virtues of vivacity and freshness . Katharine , for example , thought her a most charming companion . The cousins seemed to assemble between them a great range of qualities which are never found united in one person and seldom in half a dozen people . Where Katharine was simple , Cassandra was complex ; where Katharine was solid and direct , Cassandra was vague and evasive . In short , they represented very well the manly and the womanly sides of the feminine nature , and , for foundation , there was the profound unity of common blood between them . If Cassandra adored Katharine she was incapable of adoring any one without refreshing her spirit with frequent draughts of raillery and criticism , and Katharine enjoyed her laughter at least as much as her respect . Respect was certainly uppermost in Cassandra ’s mind at the present moment . Katharine ’s engagement had appealed to her imagination as the first engagement in a circle of contemporaries is apt to appeal to the imaginations of the others ; it was solemn , beautiful , and mysterious ; it gave both parties the important air of those who have been initiated into some rite which is still concealed from the rest of the group . For Katharine ’s sake Cassandra thought William a most distinguished and interesting character , and welcomed first his conversation and then his manuscript as the marks of a friendship which it flattered and delighted her to inspire . Katharine was still out when she arrived at Cheyne Walk . After greeting her uncle and aunt and receiving , as usual , a present of two sovereigns for “
135804	136155	136156	136156	My	0	” from Uncle Trevor , whose favorite niece she was , she changed her dress and wandered into Katharine ’s room to await her . What a great looking - glass Katharine had , she thought , and how mature all the arrangements upon the dressing - table were compared to what she was used to at home . Glancing round , she thought that the bills stuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece were astonishingly like Katharine , There was n’t a photograph of William anywhere to be seen . The room , with its combination of luxury and bareness , its silk dressing - gowns and crimson slippers , its shabby carpet and bare walls , had a powerful air of Katharine herself ; she stood in the middle of the room and enjoyed the sensation ; and then , with a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering , Cassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the shelf above the bed . In most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which the last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if , late at night , in the heart of privacy , people , skeptical by day , find solace in sipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or perplexities as may steal from their hiding - places in the dark . But there was no hymn - book here . By their battered covers and enigmatical contents , Cassandra judged them to be old school - books belonging to Uncle Trevor , and piously , though eccentrically , preserved by his daughter . There was no end , she thought , to the unexpectedness of Katharine . She had once had a passion for geometry herself , and , curled upon Katharine ’s quilt , she became absorbed in trying to remember how far she had forgotten what she once knew . Katharine , coming in a little later , found her deep in this characteristic pursuit . “
136159	136170	136156	136156	My	0	” Cassandra exclaimed , shaking the book at her cousin , “
136196	136227	136180	136180	I	0	” Whose name , what book , which life was changed Katharine proceeded to ascertain . She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly , for she was very late . “
136235	136244	136245	136245	I	0	” Cassandra asked , shutting up her book . “
136251	136252	136245	136245	I	0	” “
136262	136294	136245	136245	I	0	” said Katharine , half turning in the midst of her operations , and looking at Cassandra , who sat , clasping her knees , on the edge of the bed . “
136301	136388	136297	136297	people	383	” she said , taking in the effect of Cassandra from a new point of view . After an interval , the distinction , the irregular charm , of the small face with its long tapering nose and its bright oval eyes were very notable . The hair rose up off the forehead rather stiffly , and , given a more careful treatment by hairdressers and dressmakers , the light angular figure might possess a likeness to a French lady of distinction in the eighteenth century . “
136395	136405	136297	136297	people	383	” Cassandra asked , anticipating further possibilities of rapture . “
136421	136422	136408	136408	William	176	” “
136460	136461	136458	136458	Katharine	129	” “
136477	136478	136472	136472	you	0	” “
136486	136490	136479	136479	I	0	” Cassandra asserted . “
136503	136504	136501	136501	you	0	” “
136515	136519	136509	136509	he	176	” Katharine smiled . “
136616	137154	136607	136607	Cassandra	303	” She spoke disconnectedly , handling brush and comb , and pulling out the little drawers in her dressing - table and leaving them open . Cassandra , sitting on the bed behind her , saw the reflection of her cousin ’s face in the looking - glass . The face in the looking - glass was serious and intent , apparently occupied with other things besides the straightness of the parting which , however , was being driven as straight as a Roman road through the dark hair . Cassandra was impressed again by Katharine ’s maturity ; and , as she enveloped herself in the blue dress which filled almost the whole of the long looking - glass with blue light and made it the frame of a picture , holding not only the slightly moving effigy of the beautiful woman , but shapes and colors of objects reflected from the background , Cassandra thought that no sight had ever been quite so romantic . It was all in keeping with the room and the house , and the city round them ; for her ears had not yet ceased to notice the hum of distant wheels . They went downstairs rather late , in spite of Katharine ’s extreme speed in getting ready . To Cassandra ’s ears the buzz of voices inside the drawing - room was like the tuning up of the instruments of the orchestra . It seemed to her that there were numbers of people in the room , and that they were strangers , and that they were beautiful and dressed with the greatest distinction , although they proved to be mostly her relations , and the distinction of their clothing was confined , in the eyes of an impartial observer , to the white waistcoat which Rodney wore . But they all rose simultaneously , which was by itself impressive , and they all exclaimed , and shook hands , and she was introduced to Mr. Peyton , and the door sprang open , and dinner was announced , and they filed off , William Rodney offering her his slightly bent black arm , as she had secretly hoped he would . In short , had the scene been looked at only through her eyes , it must have been described as one of magical brilliancy . The pattern of the soup - plates , the stiff folds of the napkins , which rose by the side of each plate in the shape of arum lilies , the long sticks of bread tied with pink ribbon , the silver dishes and the sea - colored champagne glasses , with the flakes of gold congealed in their stems — all these details , together with a curiously pervasive smell of kid gloves , contributed to her exhilaration , which must be repressed , however , because she was grown up , and the world held no more for her to marvel at . The world held no more for her to marvel at , it is true ; but it held other people ; and each other person possessed in Cassandra ’s mind some fragment of what privately she called “
137157	137356	136607	136607	Cassandra	303	” It was a gift that they would impart if you asked them for it , and thus no dinner - party could possibly be dull , and little Mr. Peyton on her right and William Rodney on her left were in equal measure endowed with the quality which seemed to her so unmistakable and so precious that the way people neglected to demand it was a constant source of surprise to her . She scarcely knew , indeed , whether she was talking to Mr. Peyton or to William Rodney . But to one who , by degrees , assumed the shape of an elderly man with a mustache , she described how she had arrived in London that very afternoon , and how she had taken a cab and driven through the streets . Mr. Peyton , an editor of fifty years , bowed his bald head repeatedly , with apparent understanding . At least , he understood that she was very young and pretty , and saw that she was excited , though he could not gather at once from her words or remember from his own experience what there was to be excited about . “
137365	137369	136607	136607	Cassandra	303	” he asked . “
137377	137555	136607	136607	Cassandra	303	” He was cut short in these amiable inquiries by her desire to know whether he was one of those who read , or one of those who look out of the window ? Mr. Peyton was by no means sure which he did . He rather thought he did both . He was told that he had made a most dangerous confession . She could deduce his entire history from that one fact . He challenged her to proceed ; and she proclaimed him a Liberal Member of Parliament . William , nominally engaged in a desultory conversation with Aunt Eleanor , heard every word , and taking advantage of the fact that elderly ladies have little continuity of conversation , at least with those whom they esteem for their youth and their sex , he asserted his presence by a very nervous laugh . Cassandra turned to him directly . She was enchanted to find that , instantly and with such ease , another of these fascinating beings was offering untold wealth for her extraction . “
137570	137584	137568	137568	William	176	” she said , making use in her pleasure of his first name . “
137600	137601	137594	137594	you	2268	” “
137611	137616	137606	137606	you	2270	” Mr. Peyton asked . “
137628	137632	137620	137620	he	176	” said Cassandra . “
137657	137670	137649	137649	I	0	” she went on , disregarding Mr. Peyton in a shameless way . “
137686	137775	137682	137682	you	2268	” William inclined his head and tried to conceal the pleasure that her remark gave him . But the pleasure was not unalloyed . However susceptible to flattery William might be , he would never tolerate it from people who showed a gross or emotional taste in literature , and if Cassandra erred even slightly from what he considered essential in this respect he would express his discomfort by flinging out his hands and wrinkling his forehead ; he would find no pleasure in her flattery after that . “
137780	137784	137682	137682	you	2268	” she proceeded , “
137797	137798	137790	137790	you	2268	” “
137808	137809	137810	137810	I	0	” “
137870	137874	137865	137865	I	0	” she insisted , “
137882	137883	137876	137876	Shakespeare	170	” “
137889	137893	137884	137884	You	0	” Rodney exclaimed . “
137935	138057	137929	137929	I	0	” From this point they proceeded to go over , as far as memory served them , the different aspects of Rodney ’s drama . She said nothing that jarred upon him , and untrained daring had the power to stimulate experience to such an extent that Rodney was frequently seen to hold his fork suspended before him , while he debated the first principles of the art . Mrs. Hilbery thought to herself that she had never seen him to such advantage ; yes , he was somehow different ; he reminded her of some one who was dead , some one who was distinguished — she had forgotten his name . Cassandra ’s voice rose high in its excitement . “
138067	138071	138058	138058	You	2275	” she exclaimed . “
138081	138089	138072	138072	I	0	” William replied , a little testily . “
138096	138106	138107	138107	I	0	” she echoed , in a tone of derision . “
138116	138117	138113	138114	the Russians	343	” “
138124	138133	138136	138136	I.	2277	” boomed Uncle Aubrey from across the table . “
138148	138268	138143	138143	they	343	” The old gentleman had ruled a large part of the Indian Empire , but he was in the habit of saying that he had rather have written the works of Dickens . The table now took possession of a subject much to its liking . Aunt Eleanor showed premonitory signs of pronouncing an opinion . Although she had blunted her taste upon some form of philanthropy for twenty - five years , she had a fine natural instinct for an upstart or a pretender , and knew to a hairbreadth what literature should be and what it should not be . She was born to the knowledge , and scarcely thought it a matter to be proud of . “
138278	138283	138143	138143	they	343	” she announced positively . “
138294	138308	138361	138361	your	210	” Mr. Hilbery interposed , in his leisurely , half - humorous tones . “
138318	138335	138316	138316	Trevor	210	” said Aunt Eleanor , as if she had special authority from Shakespeare to say so . “
138367	138464	138364	138365	Mr. Peyton	342	” For , as there was a minister of literature present in the person of the editor of an esteemed review , she deferred to him . Mr. Peyton leant a little back in his chair , and , putting his head rather on one side , observed that that was a question that he had never been able to answer entirely to his satisfaction . There was much to be said on both sides , but as he considered upon which side he should say it , Mrs. Hilbery broke in upon his judicious meditations . “
138470	138474	138467	138468	lovely Ophelia	345	” she exclaimed . “
138564	138584	138543	138543	I	0	” She looked about her as if these presences had suddenly manifested themselves round her dining - room table . “
138593	138604	138586	138587	the cook	2176	” Aunt Eleanor demanded , addressing herself naturally to Katharine . “
138619	138624	138586	138587	the cook	2176	” said Mrs. Hilbery . “
138642	138664	138634	138634	Katharine	129	” she remarked , with an affectionate glance at her daughter , who looked , she thought , a little sad . “
138672	138687	138607	138608	the cook	2176	” she wound up , laying down her napkin and pushing her chair back . “
138701	138902	138607	138608	the cook	2176	” Upstairs in the drawing - room Cassandra found fresh sources of pleasure , first in the distinguished and expectant look of the room , and then in the chance of exercising her divining - rod upon a new assortment of human beings . But the low tones of the women , their meditative silences , the beauty which , to her at least , shone even from black satin and the knobs of amber which encircled elderly necks , changed her wish to chatter to a more subdued desire merely to watch and to whisper . She entered with delight into an atmosphere in which private matters were being interchanged freely , almost in monosyllables , by the older women who now accepted her as one of themselves . Her expression became very gentle and sympathetic , as if she , too , were full of solicitude for the world which was somehow being cared for , managed and deprecated by Aunt Maggie and Aunt Eleanor . After a time she perceived that Katharine was outside the community in some way , and , suddenly , she threw aside her wisdom and gentleness and concern and began to laugh . “
138909	138924	138905	138905	you	2285	” Katharine asked . A joke so foolish and unfilial was n’t worth explaining . “
138949	139029	138941	138941	you	2285	” Katharine half shut her eyes and looked , but she looked in the wrong direction , and Cassandra laughed more than ever , and was still laughing and doing her best to explain in a whisper that Aunt Eleanor , through half - shut eyes , was like the parrot in the cage at Stogdon House , when the gentlemen came in and Rodney walked straight up to them and wanted to know what they were laughing at . “
139037	139093	138941	138941	you	2285	” Cassandra replied , standing up straight , clasping her hands in front of her , and facing him . Her mockery was delicious to him . He had not even for a second the fear that she had been laughing at him . She was laughing because life was so adorable , so enchanting . “
139110	139134	139097	139097	you	0	” he replied , drawing his feet together and pressing his finger - tips upon an imaginary opera - hat or malacca cane . “
139163	139164	139165	139165	You	0	” “
139174	139178	139165	139165	You	0	” she cried . “
139201	139202	139197	139197	he	2289	” “
139205	139209	139212	139212	he	2289	” she replied , “
139226	139257	139218	139218	He	2289	” Her words , though spoken simply , produced a curious change in the light , sparkling atmosphere . William at once lost his look of animation and said seriously : “
139262	139263	139264	139264	I	0	” “
139277	139284	139285	139285	I	0	” said Cassandra , almost severely . “
139295	139301	139302	139302	You	2292	” he corrected himself quickly . “
139315	139320	139310	139310	they	2293	” Katharine went on . “
139363	139375	139376	139376	Katharine	129	” She smiled at her as an elder sister might smile . “
139386	139390	139399	139399	she	303	” Cassandra exclaimed . “
139402	139406	139399	139399	she	303	” Rodney interposed . “
139431	139432	139420	139420	One	422	” “
139438	139442	139433	139433	He	422	” said Katharine . “
139474	139475	139461	139461	He	422	” “
139479	139483	139461	139461	He	422	” Cassandra added . “
139492	139546	139547	139547	Henry	333	” Katharine remarked , and turning her head as though she saw something that needed her attention in a far corner of the room , she left them . For a moment they stood silent , after what seemed a deliberate introduction to each other , and Cassandra watched her crossing the room . “
139549	139555	139547	139547	Henry	333	” she said next moment , “
139595	139715	139592	139592	you	333	” They sat down , and Katharine , turning when she reached the window , saw William with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open , as if ready to speak the moment Cassandra ceased . Katharine ’s duty , whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair , was either forgotten or discharged , but she continued to stand by the window without doing anything . The elderly people were all grouped together round the fire . They seemed an independent , middle - aged community busy with its own concerns . They were telling stories very well and listening to them very graciously . But for her there was no obvious employment . “
139732	140173	139725	139725	I	0	” she thought , for in her slavery to her family traditions , she was ready to pay for her transgression with some plausible falsehood . She pushed aside the blind and looked at the river . But it was a dark night and the water was barely visible . Cabs were passing , and couples were loitering slowly along the road , keeping as close to the railings as possible , though the trees had as yet no leaves to cast shadow upon their embraces . Katharine , thus withdrawn , felt her loneliness . The evening had been one of pain , offering her , minute after minute , plainer proof that things would fall out as she had foreseen . She had faced tones , gestures , glances ; she knew , with her back to them , that William , even now , was plunging deeper and deeper into the delight of unexpected understanding with Cassandra . He had almost told her that he was finding it infinitely better than he could have believed . She looked out of the window , sternly determined to forget private misfortunes , to forget herself , to forget individual lives . With her eyes upon the dark sky , voices reached her from the room in which she was standing . She heard them as if they came from people in another world , a world antecedent to her world , a world that was the prelude , the antechamber to reality ; it was as if , lately dead , she heard the living talking . The dream nature of our life had never been more apparent to her , never had life been more certainly an affair of four walls , whose objects existed only within the range of lights and fires , beyond which lay nothing , or nothing more than darkness . She seemed physically to have stepped beyond the region where the light of illusion still makes it desirable to possess , to love , to struggle . And yet her melancholy brought her no serenity . She still heard the voices within the room . She was still tormented by desires . She wished to be beyond their range . She wished inconsistently enough that she could find herself driving rapidly through the streets ; she was even anxious to be with some one who , after a moment ’s groping , took a definite shape and solidified into the person of Mary Datchet . She drew the curtains so that the draperies met in deep folds in the middle of the window . “
140180	140202	140177	140177	she	2306	” said Mr. Hilbery , who was standing swaying affably from side to side , with his back to the fire . “
140221	140226	140231	140231	I	0	” he observed parenthetically , “
140291	140292	140294	140294	Trelawny	347	” “
140311	140346	140294	140294	Trelawny	347	” Katharine repeated . After all , one does not check children in their play , or rouse sleepers from their dreams . She passed William and Cassandra on her way to the door . “
140351	140368	140349	140349	Katharine	129	” said William , speaking almost as if he were conscious of her against his will . “
140373	140425	140349	140349	Katharine	129	” He rose , after a second ’s hesitation , and she understood that it cost him an effort . She knelt one knee upon the sofa where Cassandra sat , looking down at her cousin ’s face , which still moved with the speed of what she had been saying . “
140431	140435	140349	140349	Katharine	129	” she asked . “
140441	140453	140349	140349	Katharine	129	” Cassandra exclaimed , as if no further words were needed . “
140466	140470	140474	140474	he	2313	” she exclaimed , “
140492	140531	140485	140485	you	3002	” she added , looking at Katharine , and as she looked her face lost its animation and became almost melancholy in sympathy with Katharine ’s melancholy , which seemed to Cassandra the last refinement of her distinction . “
140541	140546	140605	140605	Katharine	129	” said Katharine darkly . “
140555	140561	140605	140605	Katharine	129	” She did not understand . “
140592	140602	140584	140584	I	0	” Cassandra looked at her with a puzzled expression . “
140620	140635	140605	140605	Katharine	129	” she said , as William returned to them . He had been quick . “
140642	140677	140637	140637	you	2316	” Katharine perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did not find that particular problem to his taste at present . She stood upright at once and said in a different tone : “
140712	140713	140709	140710	some one	376	” “
140720	140724	140709	140710	some one	376	” Cassandra exclaimed . “
140732	140736	140737	140738	A friend	1824	” William demanded . “
140740	140777	140737	140738	A friend	1824	” she remarked , half turning her head towards him . She knew that he wished her to stay , not , indeed , with them , but in their neighborhood , in case of need . “
140785	141043	140780	140783	a great many friends	2321	” said William rather lamely , sitting down once more , as Katharine left the room . She was soon driving quickly , as she had wished to drive , through the lamp - lit streets . She liked both light and speed , and the sense of being out of doors alone , and the knowledge that she would reach Mary in her high , lonely room at the end of the drive . She climbed the stone steps quickly , remarking the queer look of her blue silk skirt and blue shoes upon the stone , dusty with the boots of the day , under the light of an occasional jet of flickering gas . The door was opened in a second by Mary herself , whose face showed not only surprise at the sight of her visitor , but some degree of embarrassment . She greeted her cordially , and , as there was no time for explanations , Katharine walked straight into the sitting - room , and found herself in the presence of a young man who was lying back in a chair and holding a sheet of paper in his hand , at which he was looking as if he expected to go on immediately with what he was in the middle of saying to Mary Datchet . The apparition of an unknown lady in full evening dress seemed to disturb him . He took his pipe from his mouth , rose stiffly , and sat down again with a jerk . “
141050	141054	141056	141056	you	2322	” Mary asked . “
141059	141084	141056	141056	you	2322	” Katharine inquired simultaneously . The young man shook his head , as if he disowned his share in the question with some irritation . “
141090	141094	141056	141056	you	2322	” Mary replied . “
141123	141224	141225	141228	very able young men	2324	” Mary had a ruffled appearance , as if she had been running her fingers through her hair in the course of her conversation ; she was dressed more or less like a Russian peasant girl . She sat down again in a chair which looked as if it had been her seat for some hours ; the saucer which stood upon the arm contained the ashes of many cigarettes . Mr. Basnett , a very young man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the hair was combed straight back , was one of that group of “
141229	141431	141225	141228	very able young men	2324	” suspected by Mr. Clacton , justly as it turned out , of an influence upon Mary Datchet . He had come down from one of the Universities not long ago , and was now charged with the reformation of society . In connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor , for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class , and for a joint assault of the two bodies , combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy , upon Capital . The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary , and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to Mary , and make her an offer of the Secretaryship , to which , as a matter of principle , a small salary was attached . Since seven o’clock that evening he had been reading out loud the document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded , but the reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion , and it was so often necessary to inform Mary “
141435	141524	141225	141228	very able young men	2324	” of the private characters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that they were still only half - way through the manuscript . Neither of them realized that the talk had already lasted three hours . In their absorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire , and yet both Mr. Basnett in his exposition , and Mary in her interrogation , carefully preserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the human mind for irrelevant discussion . Her questions frequently began , “
141530	141542	141543	141543	we	2325	” and his replies invariably represented the views of some one called “
141545	141562	141563	141563	we	2325	” By this time Mary was almost persuaded that she , too , was included in the “
141565	141574	141575	141575	our	2325	” and agreed with Mr. Basnett in believing that “
141576	141579	141580	141580	our	2325	” views , “
141581	141584	141575	141575	our	2325	” society , “
141586	141639	141580	141580	our	2325	” policy , stood for something quite definitely segregated from the main body of society in a circle of superior illumination . The appearance of Katharine in this atmosphere was extremely incongruous , and had the effect of making Mary remember all sorts of things that she had been glad to forget . “
141646	141669	141580	141580	our	2325	” she asked again , looking , with a little smile , at the blue silk and the pearl - sewn shoes . “
141681	141693	141694	141694	We	2325	” Katharine hazarded , rather hesitatingly , looking at the papers . “
141697	141707	141694	141694	We	2325	” Mr. Basnett replied . He said no more . “
141719	141723	141724	141724	I	0	” Mary explained . “
141735	141736	141729	141729	you	2326	” “
141746	141750	141742	141742	I	0	” said Mary . “
141753	141778	141742	141742	I	0	” said Mr. Basnett , conveying the impression that , in his opinion , no sensible person could be afraid of liking to work . “
141781	141794	141795	141795	I	0	” said Katharine , as if he had stated this opinion aloud . “
141816	141817	141812	141812	I	0	” “
141825	141845	141812	141812	I	0	” said Mr. Basnett , looking at her for the first time rather keenly , and refilling his pipe . “
141859	141863	141856	141856	I	0	” said Mary . “
141884	141885	141856	141856	I	0	” “
141889	141894	141856	141856	I	0	” said Mr. Basnett . “
141909	142003	141901	141901	babies	2332	” He glanced at his document , rolled it into a cylinder between his fingers , and gazed into the fire . Katharine felt that in this company anything that one said would be judged upon its merits ; one had only to say what one thought , rather barely and tersely , with a curious assumption that the number of things that could properly be thought about was strictly limited . And Mr. Basnett was only stiff upon the surface ; there was an intelligence in his face which attracted her intelligence . “
142010	142014	142006	142007	the public	731	” she asked . “
142022	142032	142006	142007	the public	731	” Mr. Basnett asked , with a little smile . “
142039	142071	142006	142007	the public	731	” said Mary . The conspirators looked pleased , as if Katharine ’s question , with the belief in their existence which it implied , had a warming effect upon them . “
142093	142106	142006	142007	the public	731	” Mr. Basnett began , with a little jerk of his head , “
142176	142177	142173	142174	the public	731	” “
142183	142188	142173	142174	the public	731	” said Mary thoughtfully . “
142196	142209	142192	142192	she	2343	” said Mr. Basnett , jerking his head in Mary ’s direction . “
142264	142278	142249	142249	you	2347	” he asked Katharine , with a queer mixture of distrust and deference . “
142286	142292	142249	142249	you	2347	” Mary replied for her . “
142298	142559	142249	142249	you	2347	” said Mr. Basnett . He made allowances for that ; he and his friends had faced the question of sex , along with all others , and assigned it an honorable place in their scheme of life . Katharine felt this beneath the roughness of his manner ; and a world entrusted to the guardianship of Mary Datchet and Mr. Basnett seemed to her a good world , although not a romantic or beautiful place or , to put it figuratively , a place where any line of blue mist softly linked tree to tree upon the horizon . For a moment she thought she saw in his face , bent now over the fire , the features of that original man whom we still recall every now and then , although we know only the clerk , barrister , Governmental official , or workingman variety of him . Not that Mr. Basnett , giving his days to commerce and his spare time to social reform , would long carry about him any trace of his possibilities of completeness ; but , for the moment , in his youth and ardor , still speculative , still uncramped , one might imagine him the citizen of a nobler state than ours . Katharine turned over her small stock of information , and wondered what their society might be going to attempt . Then she remembered that she was hindering their business , and rose , still thinking of this society , and thus thinking , she said to Mr. Basnett : “
142576	142650	142573	142573	I	0	” He nodded , and took his pipe from his mouth , but , being unable to think of anything to say , he put it back again , although he would have been glad if she had stayed . Against her wish , Mary insisted upon taking her downstairs , and then , as there was no cab to be seen , they stood in the street together , looking about them . “
142654	142670	142671	142671	You	2349	” Katharine urged her , thinking of Mr. Basnett with his papers in his hand . “
142683	142753	142671	142671	You	2349	” said Mary , but the desire to find a cab was not her true reason for standing beside Katharine for a minute or two . Unfortunately for her composure , Mr. Basnett and his papers seemed to her an incidental diversion of life ’s serious purpose compared with some tremendous fact which manifested itself as she stood alone with Katharine . It may have been their common womanhood . “
142759	142767	142757	142757	Ralph	154	” she asked suddenly , without preface . “
142770	142808	142757	142757	Ralph	154	” said Katharine directly , but she did not remember when or where she had seen him . It took her a moment or two to remember why Mary should ask her if she had seen Ralph . “
142815	142819	142811	142811	I	0	” said Mary . “
142824	142849	142822	142822	Mary	175	” said Katharine , rather distractedly , taking her arm and beginning to walk up the street in the direction of the main road . “
142873	142893	142822	142822	Mary	175	” Mary was silent , in the hope that Katharine would tell her more . But Katharine said nothing . “
142902	142915	142916	142916	You	2353	” Mary exclaimed , her anger rising , to her own surprise . “
142934	142938	142927	142927	I	0	” She stopped . “
142948	142952	142943	142943	Ralph	154	” she concluded . “
142964	142984	142953	142953	I	0	” Katharine observed . Without either of them wishing it , a feeling of hostility had risen between them . “
142994	143002	142986	142986	you	2353	” said Mary , after a pause . “
143008	143012	143005	143005	one	422	” Katharine asked . “
143021	143028	143005	143005	one	422	” Mary demanded rashly and foolishly . “
143053	143054	143055	143055	We	2357	” “
143062	143066	143055	143055	We	2357	” said Mary . “
143081	143085	143068	143068	I	0	” Katharine asked . “
143102	143103	143098	143098	I	0	” “
143113	143120	143106	143106	you	2353	” said Mary , controlling herself . “
143128	143133	143123	143123	I	0	” said Katharine suddenly . “
143150	143151	143147	143147	I	0	” “
143158	143164	143168	143168	I	0	” said Katharine , peremptorily . “
143177	143226	143168	143168	I	0	” She spoke with unnecessary vehemence , but it was not directed against Mary Datchet . Their animosity had completely disappeared , and upon both of them a cloud of difficulty and darkness rested , obscuring the future , in which they had both to find a way . “
143237	143241	143168	143168	I	0	” Katharine repeated . “
143273	143277	143278	143278	I	0	” she added , “
143297	143377	143378	143378	I	0	” They had reached the main thoroughfare , and stood looking at the omnibuses and passers - by , who seemed , for the moment , to illustrate what Katharine had said of the diversity of human interests . For both of them it had become one of those moments of extreme detachment , when it seems unnecessary ever again to shoulder the burden of happiness and self - assertive existence . Their neighbors were welcome to their possessions . “
143386	143406	143378	143378	I	0	” ’ said Mary , recovering herself first , as they turned after a long pause of this description . “
143425	143429	143432	143432	you	2353	” she added , “
143435	143506	143507	143507	You	2353	” At the same time she was profoundly perplexed , not only by what she knew of the arrangements for Katharine ’s marriage , but by the impression which she had of her , there on her arm , dark and inscrutable . They walked back again and reached the steps which led up to Mary ’s flat . Here they stopped and paused for a moment , saying nothing . “
143512	143519	143520	143520	He	2359	” said Katharine , rousing herself . “
143533	143589	143520	143520	He	2359	” She glanced up at the lighted window near the top of the house , and they both looked at it and waited for a moment . A flight of semicircular steps ran up to the hall , and Mary slowly mounted the first two or three , and paused , looking down upon Katharine . “
143600	143662	143592	143592	you	2353	” she said slowly , and a little awkwardly . She climbed another step and looked down once more upon the figure that was only partly lit up , standing in the street with a colorless face turned upwards . As Mary hesitated , a cab came by and Katharine turned and stopped it , saying as she opened the door : “
143675	143811	143812	143812	I	0	” she added , having to raise her voice a little , and shutting the door upon the rest of her words . Mary mounted the stairs step by step , as if she had to lift her body up an extremely steep ascent . She had had to wrench herself forcibly away from Katharine , and every step vanquished her desire . She held on grimly , encouraging herself as though she were actually making some great physical effort in climbing a height . She was conscious that Mr. Basnett , sitting at the top of the stairs with his documents , offered her solid footing if she were capable of reaching it . The knowledge gave her a faint sense of exaltation . Mr. Basnett raised his eyes as she opened the door . “
143821	143825	143812	143812	I	0	” he said . “
143834	144135	144136	144136	Katharine	129	” He had been re - reading the document , and making pencil notes in the margin while he waited , and he went on again as if there had been no interruption . Mary sat down among the flat cushions , lit another cigarette , and listened with a frown upon her face . Katharine leant back in the corner of the cab that carried her to Chelsea , conscious of fatigue , and conscious , too , of the sober and satisfactory nature of such industry as she had just witnessed . The thought of it composed and calmed her . When she reached home she let herself in as quietly as she could , in the hope that the household was already gone to bed . But her excursion had occupied less time than she thought , and she heard sounds of unmistakable liveliness upstairs . A door opened , and she drew herself into a ground - floor room in case the sound meant that Mr. Peyton were taking his leave . From where she stood she could see the stairs , though she was herself invisible . Some one was coming down the stairs , and now she saw that it was William Rodney . He looked a little strange , as if he were walking in his sleep ; his lips moved as if he were acting some part to himself . He came down very slowly , step by step , with one hand upon the banisters to guide himself . She thought he looked as if he were in some mood of high exaltation , which it made her uncomfortable to witness any longer unseen . She stepped into the hall . He gave a great start upon seeing her and stopped . “
144138	144142	144249	144249	you	129	” he exclaimed . “
144148	144152	144143	144143	You	129	” he asked . “
144160	144181	144156	144156	they	2362	” He did not answer , and walked into the ground - floor room through the door which stood open . “
144193	144197	144188	144188	I	0	” he said , “
144203	144235	144198	144198	I	0	” He was scarcely addressing her , and she said nothing . For a moment they stood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing . Then he asked her quickly , “
144268	144309	144266	144266	Katharine	129	” Before she could answer a door opened on the landing above and disturbed them . It disturbed William excessively . He started back , walked rapidly into the hall , and said in a loud and ostentatiously ordinary tone : “
144338	144401	144326	144326	I	0	” Next moment he was gone . She went upstairs and found Cassandra on the landing . She held two or three books in her hand , and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase . She said that she could never tell which book she wanted to read in bed , poetry , biography , or metaphysics . “
144411	144423	144404	144404	you	129	” she asked , as they walked upstairs side by side . “
144431	144441	144404	144404	you	129	” said Katharine vaguely . Cassandra looked at her . “
144450	144454	144445	144445	you	129	” she said . “
144472	144473	144445	144445	you	129	” “
144480	144484	144475	144475	William	176	” Katharine asked . “
144494	144498	144489	144489	he	176	” Cassandra replied . “
144527	144829	144525	144525	Katharine	129	” she added , looking with shy devotion at her cousin ’s beautiful face . London , in the first days of spring , has buds that open and flowers that suddenly shake their petals — white , purple , or crimson — in competition with the display in the garden beds , although these city flowers are merely so many doors flung wide in Bond Street and the neighborhood , inviting you to look at a picture , or hear a symphony , or merely crowd and crush yourself among all sorts of vocal , excitable , brightly colored human beings . But , all the same , it is no mean rival to the quieter process of vegetable florescence . Whether or not there is a generous motive at the root , a desire to share and impart , or whether the animation is purely that of insensate fervor and friction , the effect , while it lasts , certainly encourages those who are young , and those who are ignorant , to think the world one great bazaar , with banners fluttering and divans heaped with spoils from every quarter of the globe for their delight . As Cassandra Otway went about London provided with shillings that opened turnstiles , or more often with large white cards that disregarded turnstiles , the city seemed to her the most lavish and hospitable of hosts . After visiting the National Gallery , or Hertford House , or hearing Brahms or Beethoven at the Bechstein Hall , she would come back to find a new person awaiting her , in whose soul were imbedded some grains of the invaluable substance which she still called reality , and still believed that she could find . The Hilberys , as the saying is , “
144834	145332	144525	144525	Katharine	129	” and that arrogant claim was certainly upheld by the number of houses which , within a certain area , lit their lamps at night , opened their doors after 3 p. m. , and admitted the Hilberys to their dining - rooms , say , once a month . An indefinable freedom and authority of manner , shared by most of the people who lived in these houses , seemed to indicate that whether it was a question of art , music , or government , they were well within the gates , and could smile indulgently at the vast mass of humanity which is forced to wait and struggle , and pay for entrance with common coin at the door . The gates opened instantly to admit Cassandra . She was naturally critical of what went on inside , and inclined to quote what Henry would have said ; but she often succeeded in contradicting Henry , in his absence , and invariably paid her partner at dinner , or the kind old lady who remembered her grandmother , the compliment of believing that there was meaning in what they said . For the sake of the light in her eager eyes , much crudity of expression and some untidiness of person were forgiven her . It was generally felt that , given a year or two of experience , introduced to good dressmakers , and preserved from bad influences , she would be an acquisition . Those elderly ladies , who sit on the edge of ballrooms sampling the stuff of humanity between finger and thumb and breathing so evenly that the necklaces , which rise and fall upon their breasts , seem to represent some elemental force , such as the waves upon the ocean of humanity , concluded , a little smilingly , that she would do . They meant that she would in all probability marry some young man whose mother they respected . William Rodney was fertile in suggestions . He knew of little galleries , and select concerts , and private performances , and somehow made time to meet Katharine and Cassandra , and to give them tea or dinner or supper in his rooms afterwards . Each one of her fourteen days thus promised to bear some bright illumination in its sober text . But Sunday approached . The day is usually dedicated to Nature . The weather was almost kindly enough for an expedition . But Cassandra rejected Hampton Court , Greenwich , Richmond , and Kew in favor of the Zoological Gardens . She had once trifled with the psychology of animals , and still knew something about inherited characteristics . On Sunday afternoon , therefore , Katharine , Cassandra , and William Rodney drove off to the Zoo . As their cab approached the entrance , Katharine bent forward and waved her hand to a young man who was walking rapidly in the same direction . “
145338	145342	145343	145343	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
145351	145474	145343	145343	I	0	” she added . She had even come provided with a ticket for him . William ’s objection that he would not be admitted was , therefore , silenced directly . But the way in which the two men greeted each other was significant of what was going to happen . As soon as they had admired the little birds in the large cage William and Cassandra lagged behind , and Ralph and Katharine pressed on rather in advance . It was an arrangement in which William took his part , and one that suited his convenience , but he was annoyed all the same . He thought that Katharine should have told him that she had invited Denham to meet them . “
145481	145747	145343	145343	I	0	” he said rather sharply . It was clear that he was irritated , and Cassandra felt for his annoyance . They were standing by the pen of some Oriental hog , and she was prodding the brute gently with the point of her umbrella , when a thousand little observations seemed , in some way , to collect in one center . The center was one of intense and curious emotion . Were they happy ? She dismissed the question as she asked it , scorning herself for applying such simple measures to the rare and splendid emotions of so unique a couple . Nevertheless , her manner became immediately different , as if , for the first time , she felt consciously womanly , and as if William might conceivably wish later on to confide in her . She forgot all about the psychology of animals , and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown , and became instantly engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could administer consolation , and she hoped that Katharine would keep ahead with Mr. Denham , as a child who plays at being grown - up hopes that her mother wo n’t come in just yet , and spoil the game . Or was it not rather that she had ceased to play at being grown - up , and was conscious , suddenly , that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest ? There was still unbroken silence between Katharine and Ralph Denham , but the occupants of the different cages served instead of speech . “
145757	145763	145750	145750	you	2370	” Ralph asked at length . “
145766	145770	145750	145750	you	2370	” she pondered . “
145789	145819	145781	145781	I	0	” she speculated , stopping before a gray bear , who was philosophically playing with a tassel which once , perhaps , formed part of a lady ’s parasol . “
145830	145834	145823	145823	Rodney	176	” Ralph remarked . “
145845	145919	145838	145838	he	176	” she replied . The detachment expressed by her voice puzzled Ralph , and he would have been glad if she had explained her meaning further . But he was not going to press her for explanations . Each moment was to be , as far as he could make it , complete in itself , owing nothing of its happiness to explanations , borrowing neither bright nor dark tints from the future . “
145925	145929	145838	145838	he	176	” he remarked . “
145955	146012	146013	146013	I	0	” They walked to the counter piled with little paper bags , and each simultaneously produced a shilling and pressed it upon the young lady , who did not know whether to oblige the lady or the gentleman , but decided , from conventional reasons , that it was the part of the gentleman to pay . “
146018	146030	146031	146031	I	0	” said Ralph peremptorily , refusing the coin which Katharine tendered . “
146040	146053	146031	146031	I	0	” he added , seeing her smile at his tone of decision . “
146063	146081	146056	146056	you	0	” she agreed , breaking the bun into parts and tossing them down the bears ’ throats , “
146100	146555	146097	146097	your	0	” He refused to tell her . He could not explain to her that he was offering up consciously all his happiness to her , and wished , absurdly enough , to pour every possession he had upon the blazing pyre , even his silver and gold . He wished to keep this distance between them — the distance which separates the devotee from the image in the shrine . Circumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have been , had they been seated in a drawing - room , for example , with a tea - tray between them . He saw her against a background of pale grottos and sleek hides ; camels slanted their heavy - ridded eyes at her , giraffes fastidiously observed her from their melancholy eminence , and the pink - lined trunks of elephants cautiously abstracted buns from her outstretched hands . Then there were the hothouses . He saw her bending over pythons coiled upon the sand , or considering the brown rock breaking the stagnant water of the alligators ’ pool , or searching some minute section of tropical forest for the golden eye of a lizard or the indrawn movement of the green frogs ’ flanks . In particular , he saw her outlined against the deep green waters , in which squadrons of silvery fish wheeled incessantly , or ogled her for a moment , pressing their distorted mouths against the glass , quivering their tails straight out behind them . Again , there was the insect house , where she lifted the blinds of the little cages , and marveled at the purple circles marked upon the rich tussore wings of some lately emerged and semi - conscious butterfly , or at caterpillars immobile like the knobbed twigs of a pale - skinned tree , or at slim green snakes stabbing the glass wall again and again with their flickering cleft tongues . The heat of the air , and the bloom of heavy flowers , which swam in water or rose stiffly from great red jars , together with the display of curious patterns and fantastic shapes , produced an atmosphere in which human beings tended to look pale and to fall silent . Opening the door of a house which rang with the mocking and profoundly unhappy laughter of monkeys , they discovered William and Cassandra . William appeared to be tempting some small reluctant animal to descend from an upper perch to partake of half an apple . Cassandra was reading out , in her high - pitched tones , an account of this creature ’s secluded disposition and nocturnal habits . She saw Katharine and exclaimed : “
146571	146572	146573	146573	We	2378	” “
146580	146640	146573	146573	We	2378	” said William . He looked from one to the other , and seemed to take stock of Denham ’s unfashionable appearance . He seemed to wish to find some outlet for malevolence , but , failing one , he remained silent . The glance , the slight quiver of the upper lip , were not lost upon Katharine . “
146648	146652	146653	146653	He	176	” she remarked . “
146667	146668	146653	146653	He	176	” “
146682	146693	146672	146672	you	0	” said Rodney , withdrawing his hand with the apple . “
146706	146710	146653	146653	He	176	” Denham replied . “
146720	146772	146773	146773	I	0	” Cassandra asked him , not from a genuine desire to visit the reptiles , but in obedience to her new - born feminine susceptibility , which urged her to charm and conciliate the other sex . Denham began to give her directions , and Katharine and William moved on together . “
146782	146786	146773	146773	I	0	” William remarked . “
146792	146796	146789	146790	Ralph Denham	154	” she replied . “
146801	146828	146789	146790	Ralph Denham	154	” William returned , with superficial urbanity . Many retorts were obvious , but wishing , on the whole , for peace , Katharine merely inquired : “
146836	146837	146838	146838	Cassandra	303	” “
146853	146857	146840	146840	I	0	” he replied . “
146872	146873	146874	146874	I	0	” “
146879	146948	146874	146874	I	0	” she replied , turning her head to look for him . But he and Cassandra were absorbed in the aye - aye once more . William and Katharine watched them for a moment , and each looked curiously at the object of the other ’s preference . But resting his eye upon Cassandra , to whose elegance the dressmakers had now done justice , William said sharply : “
146966	146967	146959	146959	your	2381	” “
146982	147143	146976	146976	I	0	” Katharine replied . They were professedly looking into the enormous central cage of monkeys , and being thoroughly annoyed by William , she compared him to a wretched misanthropical ape , huddled in a scrap of old shawl at the end of a pole , darting peevish glances of suspicion and distrust at his companions . Her tolerance was deserting her . The events of the past week had worn it thin . She was in one of those moods , perhaps not uncommon with either sex , when the other becomes very clearly distinguished , and of contemptible baseness , so that the necessity of association is degrading , and the tie , which at such moments is always extremely close , drags like a halter round the neck . William ’s exacting demands and his jealousy had pulled her down into some horrible swamp of her nature where the primeval struggle between man and woman still rages . “
147152	147156	147144	147144	You	2381	” William persisted . “
147170	147198	147159	147159	you	2381	” As he spoke he rattled his stick against the bars of the cage , which gave his words an accompaniment peculiarly exasperating to Katharine ’s nerves . “
147212	147216	147217	147217	You	0	” she said . “
147225	147226	147217	147217	You	0	” “
147232	147350	147217	147217	You	0	” said William . By his determined rattling he had now collected the animated attention of some half - dozen apes . Either to propitiate them , or to show his consideration for their feelings , he proceeded to offer them the apple which he held . The sight , unfortunately , was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind , the ruse was so transparent , that Katharine was seized with laughter . She laughed uncontrollably . William flushed red . No display of anger could have hurt his feelings more profoundly . It was not only that she was laughing at him ; the detachment of the sound was horrible . “
147361	147745	147356	147356	you	2386	” he muttered , and , turning , found that the other couple had rejoined them . As if the matter had been privately agreed upon , the couples separated once more , Katharine and Denham passing out of the house without more than a perfunctory glance round them . Denham obeyed what seemed to be Katharine ’s wish in thus making haste . Some change had come over her . He connected it with her laughter , and her few words in private with Rodney ; he felt that she had become unfriendly to him . She talked , but her remarks were indifferent , and when he spoke her attention seemed to wander . This change of mood was at first extremely disagreeable to him ; but soon he found it salutary . The pale drizzling atmosphere of the day affected him , also . The charm , the insidious magic in which he had luxuriated , were suddenly gone ; his feeling had become one of friendly respect , and to his great pleasure he found himself thinking spontaneously of the relief of finding himself alone in his room that night . In his surprise at the suddenness of the change , and at the extent of his freedom , he bethought him of a daring plan , by which the ghost of Katharine could be more effectually exorcised than by mere abstinence . He would ask her to come home with him to tea . He would force her through the mill of family life ; he would place her in a light unsparing and revealing . His family would find nothing to admire in her , and she , he felt certain , would despise them all , and this , too , would help him . He felt himself becoming more and more merciless towards her . By such courageous measures any one , he thought , could end the absurd passions which were the cause of so much pain and waste . He could foresee a time when his experiences , his discovery , and his triumph were made available for younger brothers who found themselves in the same predicament . He looked at his watch , and remarked that the gardens would soon be closed . “
147748	147752	147356	147356	you	2386	” he added , “
147770	147789	147790	147790	We	2387	” He looked over his shoulder , and , seeing no trace of them , remarked at once : “
147813	147814	147818	147818	you	0	” “
147823	147827	147818	147818	you	0	” she asked . “
147837	148046	147818	147818	you	0	” he replied promptly . She assented , having very little notion whether Highgate was next door to Regent ’s Park or not . She was only glad to put off her return to the family tea - table in Chelsea for an hour or two . They proceeded with dogged determination through the winding roads of Regent ’s Park , and the Sunday - stricken streets of the neighborhood , in the direction of the Tube station . Ignorant of the way , she resigned herself entirely to him , and found his silence a convenient cover beneath which to continue her anger with Rodney . When they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom of Highgate , she wondered , for the first time , where he was taking her . Had he a family , or did he live alone in rooms ? On the whole she was inclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged , and possibly invalid , mother . She sketched lightly , upon the blank vista down which they walked , the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising from behind her tea - table to greet her with faltering words about “
148052	148126	147818	147818	you	0	” and was on the point of asking Ralph to tell her what she might expect , when he jerked open one of the infinite number of identical wooden doors , and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the Alpine style of architecture . As they listened to the shaking of the bell in the basement , she could summon no vision to replace the one so rudely destroyed . “
148137	148141	148142	148142	They	2393	” said Ralph . “
148157	148158	148153	148153	my	0	” “
148166	148175	148164	148164	sisters	516	” she asked , without concealing her dismay . “
148180	148309	148164	148164	sisters	516	” he replied grimly , as the door opened . While Ralph took off his coat , she had time to notice the ferns and photographs and draperies , and to hear a hum , or rather a babble , of voices talking each other down , from the sound of them . The rigidity of extreme shyness came over her . She kept as far behind Denham as she could , and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded lights , which fell upon a number of people , of different ages , sitting round a large dining - room table untidily strewn with food , and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas . Ralph walked straight to the far end of the table . “
148317	148344	148314	148315	Miss Hilbery	129	” he said . A large elderly lady , bent over an unsatisfactory spirit - lamp , looked up with a little frown , and observed : “
148362	148380	148360	148360	Dorothy	172	” she continued on the same breath , to catch the servant before she left the room , “
148410	148580	148401	148401	you	2399	” she sighed , looking generally down the table , and then began seeking among the china before her for two clean cups for the new - comers . The unsparing light revealed more ugliness than Katharine had seen in one room for a very long time . It was the ugliness of enormous folds of brown material , looped and festooned , of plush curtains , from which depended balls and fringes , partially concealing bookshelves swollen with black school - texts . Her eye was arrested by crossed scabbards of fretted wood upon the dull green wall , and whereever there was a high flat eminence , some fern waved from a pot of crinkled china , or a bronze horse reared so high that the stump of a tree had to sustain his forequarters . The waters of family life seemed to rise and close over her head , and she munched in silence . At length Mrs. Denham looked up from her teacups and remarked : “
148649	148710	148635	148635	We	2405	” A boy of sixteen , who appeared to be Johnnie , grumbled derisively both at the notion of drawing - room tea and at the necessity of carrying a tray up to his brother . But he took himself off , being enjoined by his mother to mind what he was doing , and shut the door after him . “
148718	148843	148635	148635	We	2405	” said Katharine , applying herself with determination to the dissection of her cake ; they had given her too large a slice . She knew that Mrs. Denham suspected her of critical comparisons . She knew that she was making poor progress with her cake . Mrs. Denham had looked at her sufficiently often to make it clear to Katharine that she was asking who this young woman was , and why Ralph had brought her to tea with them . There was an obvious reason , which Mrs. Denham had probably reached by this time . Outwardly , she was behaving with rather rusty and laborious civility . She was making conversation about the amenities of Highgate , its development and situation . “
148849	148853	148845	148845	I	0	” she said , “
148895	148896	148888	148888	their	305	” “
148912	148932	148888	148888	their	305	” said Katharine . Mrs. Denham agreed effusively , as if her opinion of Katharine ’s sense had risen . “
148943	149006	148937	148937	we	2410	” she said , and she went on , as people who live in the suburbs so often do , to prove that it was healthier , more convenient , and less spoilt than any suburb round London . She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she expressed unpopular views , and that her children disagreed with her . “
149017	149028	148937	148937	we	2410	” said Hester , a girl of eighteen , abruptly . “
149040	149044	148937	148937	we	2410	” James muttered . “
149047	149052	148937	148937	we	2410	” said Mrs. Denham . “
149082	149103	149104	149105	Miss Hilbery	129	” Here some family joke exploded , which Katharine could not follow . Even Mrs. Denham laughed against her will . “
149113	149593	149104	149105	Miss Hilbery	129	” she added reprovingly . Miss Hilbery smiled and shook her head , and was conscious that a great many eyes rested upon her , for a moment , as if they would find pleasure in discussing her when she was gone . Owing , perhaps , to this critical glance , Katharine decided that Ralph Denham ’s family was commonplace , unshapely , lacking in charm , and fitly expressed by the hideous nature of their furniture and decorations . She glanced along a mantelpiece ranged with bronze chariots , silver vases , and china ornaments that were either facetious or eccentric . She did not apply her judgment consciously to Ralph , but when she looked at him , a moment later , she rated him lower than at any other time of their acquaintanceship . He had made no effort to tide over the discomforts of her introduction , and now , engaged in argument with his brother , apparently forgot her presence . She must have counted upon his support more than she realized , for this indifference , emphasized , as it was , by the insignificant commonplace of his surroundings , awoke her , not only to that ugliness , but to her own folly . She thought of one scene after another in a few seconds , with that shudder which is almost a blush . She had believed him when he spoke of friendship . She had believed in a spiritual light burning steadily and steadfastly behind the erratic disorder and incoherence of life . The light was now gone out , suddenly , as if a sponge had blotted it . The litter of the table and the tedious but exacting conversation of Mrs. Denham remained : they struck , indeed , upon a mind bereft of all defences , and , keenly conscious of the degradation which is the result of strife whether victorious or not , she thought gloomily of her loneliness , of life ’s futility , of the barren prose of reality , of William Rodney , of her mother , and the unfinished book . Her answers to Mrs. Denham were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness , and to Ralph , who watched her narrowly , she seemed further away than was compatible with her physical closeness . He glanced at her , and ground out further steps in his argument , determined that no folly should remain when this experience was over . Next moment , a silence , sudden and complete , descended upon them all . The silence of all these people round the untidy table was enormous and hideous ; something horrible seemed about to burst from it , but they endured it obstinately . A second later the door opened and there was a stir of relief ; cries of “
149607	149790	149603	149603	you	156	” broke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the table - cloth , and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little waves again . It was obvious that Joan had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family . She went up to Katharine as if she had heard of her , and was very glad to see her at last . She explained that she had been visiting an uncle who was ill , and that had kept her . No , she had n’t had any tea , but a slice of bread would do . Some one handed up a hot cake , which had been keeping warm in the fender ; she sat down by her mother ’s side , Mrs. Denham ’s anxieties seemed to relax , and every one began eating and drinking , as if tea had begun over again . Hester voluntarily explained to Katharine that she was reading to pass some examination , because she wanted more than anything in the whole world to go to Newnham . “
149803	149807	149797	149797	you	2417	” Johnnie demanded . “
149819	149827	149828	149828	She	2417	” said Joan , overhearing him instantly . “
149857	149889	149845	149845	I	0	” she went on , smiling at Katharine , with the worried humorous smile of the elder sister whose younger brothers and sisters have become almost like children of her own . “
149904	149908	149892	149892	you	156	” Ralph asked . “
149940	149941	149944	149944	you	352	” “
149956	149974	149944	149944	you	352	” said Mrs. Denham , still cherishing the belief that the bread - knife could be spoilt . “
149985	149998	149978	149978	you	352	” she said , without any conviction that she would be obeyed . “
150009	150013	150001	150001	Ann	175	” she continued . “
150026	150155	150022	150022	Amy	354	” and in the mysterious delight of learning further details of these arrangements , and suggesting more sensible plans of her own , which , from the aggrieved way in which she spoke , she did not seem to expect any one to adopt , Mrs. Denham completely forgot the presence of a well - dressed visitor , who had to be informed about the amenities of Highgate . As soon as Joan had taken her seat , an argument had sprung up on either side of Katharine , as to whether the Salvation Army has any right to play hymns at street corners on Sunday mornings , thereby making it impossible for James to have his sleep out , and tampering with the rights of individual liberty . “
150171	150194	150159	150159	James	337	” said Johnnie , explaining himself to Katharine , whereupon James fired up and , making her his goal , also exclaimed : “
150219	150332	150210	150210	Johnnie	352	” They appealed to her , and she forgot her cake and began to laugh and talk and argue with sudden animation . The large family seemed to her so warm and various that she forgot to censure them for their taste in pottery . But the personal question between James and Johnnie merged into some argument already , apparently , debated , so that the parts had been distributed among the family , in which Ralph took the lead ; and Katharine found herself opposed to him and the champion of Johnnie ’s cause , who , it appeared , always lost his head and got excited in argument with Ralph . “
150349	150562	150343	150343	She	2422	” he exclaimed , after Katharine had restated his case , and made it more precise . The debate was left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph . They looked into each other ’s eyes fixedly , like wrestlers trying to see what movement is coming next , and while Ralph spoke , Katharine bit her lower lip , and was always ready with her next point as soon as he had done . They were very well matched , and held the opposite views . But at the most exciting stage of the argument , for no reason that Katharine could see , all chairs were pushed back , and one after another the Denham family got up and went out of the door , as if a bell had summoned them . She was not used to the clockwork regulations of a large family . She hesitated in what she was saying , and rose . Mrs. Denham and Joan had drawn together and stood by the fireplace , slightly raising their skirts above their ankles , and discussing something which had an air of being very serious and very private . They appeared to have forgotten her presence among them . Ralph stood holding the door open for her . “
150572	150622	150565	150565	you	2423	” he said . And Katharine , glancing back at Joan , who smiled at her in a preoccupied way , followed Ralph upstairs . She was thinking of their argument , and when , after the long climb , he opened his door , she began at once . “
150649	150724	150725	150725	Your	2426	” For some time they continued the argument , and then the intervals between one statement and the next became longer and longer , and they spoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously , and at last fell silent . Katharine went over the argument in her mind , remembering how , now and then , it had been set conspicuously on the right course by some remark offered either by James or by Johnnie . “
150731	150735	150738	150738	you	2426	” she said . “
150746	150747	150738	150738	you	2426	” “
150759	150763	150750	150750	Johnnie	352	” Ralph replied . “
150776	150777	150771	150771	her	353	” “
150786	150787	150788	150788	Molly	175	” “
150803	150835	150796	150796	they	2430	” He was immensely pleased by Katharine ’s praise of his brothers and sisters . He would have liked to go on telling her about them , but he checked himself . “
150847	150979	150836	150836	I	0	” Katharine continued . His deep pride in his family was more evident to him , at that moment , than ever before , and the idea of living alone in a cottage was ridiculous . All that brotherhood and sisterhood , and a common childhood in a common past mean , all the stability , the unambitious comradeship , and tacit understanding of family life at its best , came to his mind , and he thought of them as a company , of which he was the leader , bound on a difficult , dreary , but glorious voyage . And it was Katharine who had opened his eyes to this , he thought . A little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her attention . “
150984	150989	150980	150980	My	0	” he explained briefly . “
150999	151016	151017	151017	You	0	” She looked at the rook , and her eyes went from one object to another . “
151023	151048	151017	151017	You	0	” she said , her eyes resting upon his books . He said that he was in the habit of working there at night . “
151070	151155	150836	150836	I	0	” He was extremely anxious that she should appreciate his view , and she rose to see what was to be seen . It was already dark enough for the turbulent haze to be yellow with the light of street lamps , and she tried to determine the quarters of the city beneath her . The sight of her gazing from his window gave him a peculiar satisfaction . When she turned , at length , he was still sitting motionless in his chair . “
151161	151165	150836	150836	I	0	” she said . “
151171	151285	151286	151286	You	0	” She settled upon the arm of the chair irresolutely , thinking that she had no wish to go home . William would be there , and he would find some way of making things unpleasant for her , and the memory of their quarrel came back to her . She had noticed Ralph ’s coldness , too . She looked at him , and from his fixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory , some argument . He had thought , perhaps , of some fresh point in his position , as to the bounds of personal liberty . She waited , silently , thinking about liberty . “
151291	151300	151286	151286	You	0	” he said at last , without moving . “
151305	151314	151301	151301	I	0	” she repeated , thinking of the argument . “
151326	151331	151319	151319	I	0	” he burst out . “
151337	151338	151334	151334	you	0	” “
151377	151382	151383	151383	You	0	” He stopped short . “
151390	151391	151383	151383	You	0	” “
151407	151432	151399	151399	I	0	” An immense relief , and a reluctance to enjoy that relief , conflicted in her heart . She slid down into the chair . “
151439	151443	151435	151435	you	0	” she said . “
151449	151453	151446	151446	I	0	” he replied . “
151525	151549	151522	151522	I	0	” He spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared ; she frowned ; and her tone changed to one almost of severity . “
151569	151575	151567	151567	Ralph	154	” He looked at her . “
151657	151658	151659	151659	You	0	” “
151662	151674	151659	151659	You	0	” he began , but she would not let him speak . “
151763	151767	151768	151769	My mother	2968	” she added . “
151801	151802	151803	151803	You	0	” “
151809	151813	151803	151803	You	0	” he said . “
151825	151826	151814	151814	I	0	” “
151832	151836	151837	151837	You	0	” he added . “
151850	151851	151848	151848	me	0	” “
151863	151864	151855	151855	I	0	” “
151872	151880	151855	151855	I	0	” They were silent for a space . “
151890	151894	151855	151855	I	0	” he said . “
151907	151908	151855	151855	I	0	” “
151915	151927	151855	151855	I	0	” she mused , and they were silent for a time . “
151935	151946	151951	151951	I	0	” he asked abruptly , with a change of tone . “
151960	151961	151962	151962	You	0	” “
151969	151973	151962	151962	You	0	” he said . “
152015	152081	152001	152001	I	0	” He hoped that she would go on with the subject . But she made no reply . He had done his best to master himself , and his voice was sufficiently indifferent , but her silence tormented him . She would never speak to him of Rodney of her own accord , and her reserve left a whole continent of her soul in darkness . “
152092	152102	152001	152001	I	0	” she said , as if by an afterthought . “
152130	152131	152119	152119	We	2446	” “
152143	152147	152119	152119	We	2446	” Ralph asked . “
152153	152157	152148	152148	He	176	” she replied . “
152176	152186	152169	152169	I	0	” she broke off , pointing to a photograph . “
152211	152212	152213	152213	I	0	” “
152221	152222	152213	152213	I	0	” “
152229	152233	152213	152213	I	0	” she smiled . “
152239	152244	152213	152213	I	0	” he said impatiently . “
152258	152259	152248	152248	I	0	” “
152274	152278	152270	152270	I	0	” she asked . “
152289	152293	152270	152270	I	0	” he replied . “
152332	152333	152294	152294	You	0	” “
152357	152358	152340	152340	you	0	” “
152363	152367	152340	152340	you	0	” she said . “
152389	152390	152340	152340	you	0	” “
152396	153545	152340	152340	you	0	” Ralph added . At this she smiled , but in another moment her smile faded , either because of his words or of the way in which he spoke them . She was capable of forgetting things . He saw that . But what more did he see ? Was he not looking at something she had never shown to anybody ? Was it not something so profound that the notion of his seeing it almost shocked her ? Her smile faded , and for a moment she seemed upon the point of speaking , but looking at him in silence , with a look that seemed to ask what she could not put into words , she turned and bade him good night . Like a strain of music , the effect of Katharine ’s presence slowly died from the room in which Ralph sat alone . The music had ceased in the rapture of its melody . He strained to catch the faintest lingering echoes ; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace ; but soon it failed , and he paced the room so hungry for the sound to come again that he was conscious of no other desire left in life . She had gone without speaking ; abruptly a chasm had been cut in his course , down which the tide of his being plunged in disorder ; fell upon rocks ; flung itself to destruction . The distress had an effect of physical ruin and disaster . He trembled ; he was white ; he felt exhausted , as if by a great physical effort . He sank at last into a chair standing opposite her empty one , and marked , mechanically , with his eye upon the clock , how she went farther and farther from him , was home now , and now , doubtless , again with Rodney . But it was long before he could realize these facts ; the immense desire for her presence churned his senses into foam , into froth , into a haze of emotion that removed all facts from his grasp , and gave him a strange sense of distance , even from the material shapes of wall and window by which he was surrounded . The prospect of the future , now that the strength of his passion was revealed to him , appalled him . The marriage would take place in September , she had said ; that allowed him , then , six full months in which to undergo these terrible extremes of emotion . Six months of torture , and after that the silence of the grave , the isolation of the insane , the exile of the damned ; at best , a life from which the chief good was knowingly and for ever excluded . An impartial judge might have assured him that his chief hope of recovery lay in this mystic temper , which identified a living woman with much that no human beings long possess in the eyes of each other ; she would pass , and the desire for her vanish , but his belief in what she stood for , detached from her , would remain . This line of thought offered , perhaps , some respite , and possessed of a brain that had its station considerably above the tumult of the senses , he tried to reduce the vague and wandering incoherency of his emotions to order . The sense of self - preservation was strong in him , and Katharine herself had strangely revived it by convincing him that his family deserved and needed all his strength . She was right , and for their sake , if not for his own , this passion , which could bear no fruit , must be cut off , uprooted , shown to be as visionary and baseless as she had maintained . The best way of achieving this was not to run away from her , but to face her , and having steeped himself in her qualities , to convince his reason that they were , as she assured him , not those that he imagined . She was a practical woman , a domestic wife for an inferior poet , endowed with romantic beauty by some freak of unintelligent Nature . No doubt her beauty itself would not stand examination . He had the means of settling this point at least . He possessed a book of photographs from the Greek statues ; the head of a goddess , if the lower part were concealed , had often given him the ecstasy of being in Katharine ’s presence . He took it down from the shelf and found the picture . To this he added a note from her , bidding him meet her at the Zoo . He had a flower which he had picked at Kew to teach her botany . Such were his relics . He placed them before him , and set himself to visualize her so clearly that no deception or delusion was possible . In a second he could see her , with the sun slanting across her dress , coming towards him down the green walk at Kew . He made her sit upon the seat beside him . He heard her voice , so low and yet so decided in its tone ; she spoke reasonably of indifferent matters . He could see her faults , and analyze her virtues . His pulse became quieter , and his brain increased in clarity . This time she could not escape him . The illusion of her presence became more and more complete . They seemed to pass in and out of each other ’s minds , questioning and answering . The utmost fullness of communion seemed to be theirs . Thus united , he felt himself raised to an eminence , exalted , and filled with a power of achievement such as he had never known in singleness . Once more he told over conscientiously her faults , both of face and character ; they were clearly known to him ; but they merged themselves in the flawless union that was born of their association . They surveyed life to its uttermost limits . How deep it was when looked at from this height ! How sublime ! How the commonest things moved him almost to tears ! Thus , he forgot the inevitable limitations ; he forgot her absence , he thought it of no account whether she married him or another ; nothing mattered , save that she should exist , and that he should love her . Some words of these reflections were uttered aloud , and it happened that among them were the words , “
153550	153562	153548	153548	her	2454	” It was the first time that he had used the word “
153564	153596	152340	152340	you	0	” to describe his feeling ; madness , romance , hallucination — he had called it by these names before ; but having , apparently by accident , stumbled upon the word “
153599	153612	152340	152340	you	0	” he repeated it again and again with a sense of revelation . “
153621	153890	153619	153619	you	2454	” he exclaimed , with something like dismay . He leant against the window - sill , looking over the city as she had looked . Everything had become miraculously different and completely distinct . His feelings were justified and needed no further explanation . But he must impart them to some one , because his discovery was so important that it concerned other people too . Shutting the book of Greek photographs , and hiding his relics , he ran downstairs , snatched his coat , and passed out of doors . The lamps were being lit , but the streets were dark enough and empty enough to let him walk his fastest , and to talk aloud as he walked . He had no doubt where he was going . He was going to find Mary Datchet . The desire to share what he felt , with some one who understood it , was so imperious that he did not question it . He was soon in her street . He ran up the stairs leading to her flat two steps at a time , and it never crossed his mind that she might not be at home . As he rang her bell , he seemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful that was separate from himself , and gave him power and authority over all other people . Mary came to the door after a moment ’s pause . He was perfectly silent , and in the dusk his face looked completely white . He followed her into her room . “
153897	153929	153619	153619	you	2454	” she said , to his extreme surprise , for he had counted on finding her alone . A young man rose , and said that he knew Ralph by sight . “
153938	153942	153930	153930	We	2457	” said Mary . “
153967	153971	153974	153975	the secretary	3742	” she explained . “
153985	154003	153977	153977	I	0	” The voice in which she gave this information was so constrained as to sound almost harsh . “
154009	154105	154106	154106	I	0	” said Ralph . He looked neither at Mary nor at Mr. Basnett . Mr. Basnett thought he had seldom seen a more disagreeable or formidable man than this friend of Mary ’s , this sarcastic - looking , white - faced Mr. Denham , who seemed to demand , as if by right , an account of their proposals , and to criticize them before he had heard them . Nevertheless , he explained his projects as clearly as he could , and knew that he wished Mr. Denham to think well of them . “
154109	154118	154106	154106	I	0	” said Ralph , when he had done . “
154124	154129	154122	154122	Mary	175	” he suddenly remarked , “
154144	154218	154140	154140	you	175	” The look which he cast at her frightened her ; it expressed mutely , perhaps without his own consciousness , something deep , wild , and passionate . She left the room at once . Her heart beat fast at the knowledge of Ralph ’s presence ; but it beat with pain , and with an extraordinary fear . She stood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room . “
154227	154242	154222	154222	I	0	” she heard Ralph say , in this strange voice , to Mr. Basnett . “
154269	154276	154260	154260	You	175	” Mary returned with the quinine . “
154281	154361	154362	154362	Mary	175	” Mr. Basnett inquired , pulling out his notebook and preparing to write . For twenty minutes , perhaps , he wrote down names , addresses , and other suggestions that Ralph dictated to him . Then , when Ralph fell silent , Mr. Basnett felt that his presence was not desired , and thanking Ralph for his help , with a sense that he was very young and ignorant compared with him , he said good - bye . “
154364	154381	154382	154382	Mary	175	” said Ralph , directly Mr. Basnett had shut the door and they were alone together . “
154384	154476	154382	154382	Mary	175	” he repeated . But the old difficulty of speaking to Mary without reserve prevented him from continuing . His desire to proclaim his love for Katharine was still strong in him , but he had felt , directly he saw Mary , that he could not share it with her . The feeling increased as he sat talking to Mr. Basnett . And yet all the time he was thinking of Katharine , and marveling at his love . The tone in which he spoke Mary ’s name was harsh . “
154483	154631	154481	154481	Ralph	154	” she asked , startled by his tone . She looked at him anxiously , and her little frown showed that she was trying painfully to understand him , and was puzzled . He could feel her groping for his meaning , and he was annoyed with her , and thought how he had always found her slow , painstaking , and clumsy . He had behaved badly to her , too , which made his irritation the more acute . Without waiting for him to answer , she rose as if his answer were indifferent to her , and began to put in order some papers that Mr. Basnett had left on the table . She hummed a scrap of a tune under her breath , and moved about the room as if she were occupied in making things tidy , and had no other concern . “
154638	154648	154481	154481	Ralph	154	” she said casually , returning to her seat . “
154651	154690	154481	154481	Ralph	154	” Ralph replied . She did not press him further . They sat side by side without speaking , and Mary reached her hand for her work basket , and took out her sewing and threaded a needle . “
154698	154707	154693	154696	a clever young man	2464	” Ralph observed , referring to Mr. Basnett . “
154816	154825	154826	154826	I	0	” She spoke in the most impersonal manner . “
154833	154843	154826	154826	I	0	” Ralph replied , with equal distance of manner . “
154853	154857	154844	154844	Our	2466	” she observed . “
154891	154899	154884	154884	I	0	” She went on sewing in silence . “
154907	154921	154900	154900	You	2465	” she said , looking up and seeing the tabloids upon the mantelpiece . “
154928	154933	154922	154922	I	0	” said Ralph shortly . “
154940	154945	154946	154946	Mary	175	” she replied tranquilly . “
154953	154957	154950	154951	a brute	2475	” he exclaimed . “
154974	154975	154959	154959	I	0	” “
154986	154990	154982	154982	one	422	” she replied . “
155048	155067	155072	155072	you	0	” He spoke the word , but , as he spoke it , it seemed robbed of substance . “
155074	155079	155080	155080	I	0	” she said quietly . “
155086	155087	155084	155084	Ralph	154	” “
155232	155327	155229	155229	your	175	” He rose and began , as usual , to pace up and down the room . He knew that what he had just said bore very little resemblance to what he felt , for Mary ’s presence acted upon him like a very strong magnet , drawing from him certain expressions which were not those he made use of when he spoke to himself , nor did they represent his deepest feelings . He felt a little contempt for himself at having spoken thus ; but somehow he had been forced into speech . “
155332	155337	155229	155229	your	175	” said Mary suddenly . “
155343	155363	155338	155338	You	2478	” She spoke with unusual irritability , and Ralph , noticing it with surprise , sat down at once . “
155379	155380	155364	155364	You	2478	” “
155387	155388	155384	155385	Katharine Hilbery	129	” “
155394	155395	155384	155385	Katharine Hilbery	129	” “
155407	155408	155409	155409	I	0	” “
155412	155625	155409	155409	I	0	” said Mary . But in truth the calm of his manner , now that he was sitting down once more , wrapt her in the presence of something which she felt to be so strong , so mysterious , so incalculable , that she scarcely dared to attempt to intercept it by any word or question that she was able to frame . She looked at Ralph blankly , with a kind of awe in her face , her lips slightly parted , and her brows raised . He was apparently quite unconscious of her gaze . Then , as if she could look no longer , she leant back in her chair , and half closed her eyes . The distance between them hurt her terribly ; one thing after another came into her mind , tempting her to assail Ralph with questions , to force him to confide in her , and to enjoy once more his intimacy . But she rejected every impulse , for she could not speak without doing violence to some reserve which had grown between them , putting them a little far from each other , so that he seemed to her dignified and remote , like a person she no longer knew well . “
155636	155649	155650	155650	You	2480	” she asked gently , and even with courtesy , at length . “
155673	155682	155671	155671	Mary	175	” He , too , spoke very gently . “
155695	155699	155683	155683	I	0	” she added . “
155702	155708	155709	155709	Katharine	129	” he shook his head . “
155720	155795	155709	155709	Katharine	129	” She saw the effort with which he spoke Katharine ’s name , and believed that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment in the past . At any rate , she was conscious of no anger against him ; but rather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had suffered . But in the case of Katharine it was different ; she was indignant with Katharine . “
155801	155813	155709	155709	Katharine	129	” she said , a little aggressively . Ralph moved directly . “
155822	155826	155709	155709	Katharine	129	” he asked . “
155835	155839	155840	155840	I	0	” she replied . “
155890	155891	155885	155885	I’m	0	” “
155901	155905	155885	155885	I’m	0	” he hesitated . “
155913	155917	155921	155922	other people	2964	” she returned . “
155924	155935	155921	155922	other people	2964	” she stopped , but forced herself to go on . “
155983	156078	155981	155981	Ralph	154	” He set his mouth , as if her words rained blows on him ; he looked as if he had made up his mind to bear anything she might say , in silence . He had deserved it , and there would be relief in having to bear it . But she broke off , and rose as if to fetch something from the next room . Before she reached the door she turned back , and stood facing him , self - possessed , and yet defiant and formidable in her composure . “
156088	156092	155981	155981	Ralph	154	” she said . “
156116	156117	156118	156118	Mary	175	” “
156121	156143	156118	156118	Mary	175	” he exclaimed . But her head was turned away , and he could not say what he wished to say . “
156150	157821	156144	156144	Mary	175	” he concluded . She faced him as he spoke , and gave him her hand . She had suffered and relinquished , she had seen her future turned from one of infinite promise to one of barrenness , and yet , somehow , over what she scarcely knew , and with what results she could hardly foretell , she had conquered . With Ralph ’s eyes upon her , smiling straight back at him serenely and proudly , she knew , for the first time , that she had conquered . She let him kiss her hand . The streets were empty enough on Sunday night , and if the Sabbath , and the domestic amusements proper to the Sabbath , had not kept people indoors , a high strong wind might very probably have done so . Ralph Denham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance with his own sensations . The gusts , sweeping along the Strand , seemed at the same time to blow a clear space across the sky in which stars appeared , and for a short time the quicks - peeding silver moon riding through clouds , as if they were waves of water surging round her and over her . They swamped her , but she emerged ; they broke over her and covered her again ; she issued forth indomitable . In the country fields all the wreckage of winter was being dispersed ; the dead leaves , the withered bracken , the dry and discolored grass , but no bud would be broken , nor would the new stalks that showed above the earth take any harm , and perhaps to - morrow a line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in their green . But the whirl of the atmosphere alone was in Denham ’s mood , and what of star or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming for a second upon heaped waves fast following each other . He had not been able to speak to Mary , though for a moment he had come near enough to be tantalized by a wonderful possibility of understanding . But the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance possessed him completely ; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being ; he sought their company . More by instinct than by conscious choice , he took the direction which led to Rodney ’s rooms . He knocked loudly upon his door ; but no one answered . He rang the bell . It took him some time to accept the fact that Rodney was out . When he could no longer pretend that the sound of the wind in the old building was the sound of some one rising from his chair , he ran downstairs again , as if his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him . He walked in the direction of Chelsea . But physical fatigue , for he had not dined and had tramped both far and fast , made him sit for a moment upon a seat on the Embankment . One of the regular occupants of those seats , an elderly man who had drunk himself , probably , out of work and lodging , drifted up , begged a match , and sat down beside him . It was a windy night , he said ; times were hard ; some long story of bad luck and injustice followed , told so often that the man seemed to be talking to himself , or , perhaps , the neglect of his audience had long made any attempt to catch their attention seem scarcely worth while . When he began to speak Ralph had a wild desire to talk to him ; to question him ; to make him understand . He did , in fact , interrupt him at one point ; but it was useless . The ancient story of failure , ill - luck , undeserved disaster , went down the wind , disconnected syllables flying past Ralph ’s ears with a queer alternation of loudness and faintness as if , at certain moments , the man ’s memory of his wrongs revived and then flagged , dying down at last into a grumble of resignation , which seemed to represent a final lapse into the accustomed despair . The unhappy voice afflicted Ralph , but it also angered him . And when the elderly man refused to listen and mumbled on , an odd image came to his mind of a lighthouse besieged by the flying bodies of lost birds , who were dashed senseless , by the gale , against the glass . He had a strange sensation that he was both lighthouse and bird ; he was steadfast and brilliant ; and at the same time he was whirled , with all other things , senseless against the glass . He got up , left his tribute of silver , and pressed on , with the wind against him . The image of the lighthouse and the storm full of birds persisted , taking the place of more definite thoughts , as he walked past the Houses of Parliament and down Grosvenor Road , by the side of the river . In his state of physical fatigue , details merged themselves in the vaster prospect , of which the flying gloom and the intermittent lights of lamp - posts and private houses were the outward token , but he never lost his sense of walking in the direction of Katharine ’s house . He took it for granted that something would then happen , and , as he walked on , his mind became more and more full of pleasure and expectancy . Within a certain radius of her house the streets came under the influence of her presence . Each house had an individuality known to Ralph , because of the tremendous individuality of the house in which she lived . For some yards before reaching the Hilberys ’ door he walked in a trance of pleasure , but when he reached it , and pushed the gate of the little garden open , he hesitated . He did not know what to do next . There was no hurry , however , for the outside of the house held pleasure enough to last him some time longer . He crossed the road , and leant against the balustrade of the Embankment , fixing his eyes upon the house . Lights burnt in the three long windows of the drawing - room . The space of the room behind became , in Ralph ’s vision , the center of the dark , flying wilderness of the world ; the justification for the welter of confusion surrounding it ; the steady light which cast its beams , like those of a lighthouse , with searching composure over the trackless waste . In this little sanctuary were gathered together several different people , but their identity was dissolved in a general glory of something that might , perhaps , be called civilization ; at any rate , all dryness , all safety , all that stood up above the surge and preserved a consciousness of its own , was centered in the drawing - room of the Hilberys . Its purpose was beneficent ; and yet so far above his level as to have something austere about it , a light that cast itself out and yet kept itself aloof . Then he began , in his mind , to distinguish different individuals within , consciously refusing as yet to attack the figure of Katharine . His thoughts lingered over Mrs. Hilbery and Cassandra ; and then he turned to Rodney and Mr. Hilbery . Physically , he saw them bathed in that steady flow of yellow light which filled the long oblongs of the windows ; in their movements they were beautiful ; and in their speech he figured a reserve of meaning , unspoken , but understood . At length , after all this half - conscious selection and arrangement , he allowed himself to approach the figure of Katharine herself ; and instantly the scene was flooded with excitement . He did not see her in the body ; he seemed curiously to see her as a shape of light , the light itself ; he seemed , simplified and exhausted as he was , to be like one of those lost birds fascinated by the lighthouse and held to the glass by the splendor of the blaze . These thoughts drove him to tramp a beat up and down the pavement before the Hilberys ’ gate . He did not trouble himself to make any plans for the future . Something of an unknown kind would decide both the coming year and the coming hour . Now and again , in his vigil , he sought the light in the long windows , or glanced at the ray which gilded a few leaves and a few blades of grass in the little garden . For a long time the light burnt without changing . He had just reached the limit of his beat and was turning , when the front door opened , and the aspect of the house was entirely changed . A black figure came down the little pathway and paused at the gate . Denham understood instantly that it was Rodney . Without hesitation , and conscious only of a great friendliness for any one coming from that lighted room , he walked straight up to him and stopped him . In the flurry of the wind Rodney was taken aback , and for the moment tried to press on , muttering something , as if he suspected a demand upon his charity . “
157832	158353	158355	158355	you	2493	” he exclaimed , recognizing him . Ralph mumbled something about being on his way home . They walked on together , though Rodney walked quick enough to make it plain that he had no wish for company . He was very unhappy . That afternoon Cassandra had repulsed him ; he had tried to explain to her the difficulties of the situation , and to suggest the nature of his feelings for her without saying anything definite or anything offensive to her . But he had lost his head ; under the goad of Katharine ’s ridicule he had said too much , and Cassandra , superb in her dignity and severity , had refused to hear another word , and threatened an immediate return to her home . His agitation , after an evening spent between the two women , was extreme . Moreover , he could not help suspecting that Ralph was wandering near the Hilberys ’ house , at this hour , for reasons connected with Katharine . There was probably some understanding between them — not that anything of the kind mattered to him now . He was convinced that he had never cared for any one save Cassandra , and Katharine ’s future was no concern of his . Aloud , he said , shortly , that he was very tired and wished to find a cab . But on Sunday night , on the Embankment , cabs were hard to come by , and Rodney found himself constrained to walk some distance , at any rate , in Denham ’s company . Denham maintained his silence . Rodney ’s irritation lapsed . He found the silence oddly suggestive of the good masculine qualities which he much respected , and had at this moment great reason to need . After the mystery , difficulty , and uncertainty of dealing with the other sex , intercourse with one ’s own is apt to have a composing and even ennobling influence , since plain speaking is possible and subterfuges of no avail . Rodney , too , was much in need of a confidant ; Katharine , despite her promises of help , had failed him at the critical moment ; she had gone off with Denham ; she was , perhaps , tormenting Denham as she had tormented him . How grave and stable he seemed , speaking little , and walking firmly , compared with what Rodney knew of his own torments and indecisions ! He began to cast about for some way of telling the story of his relations with Katharine and Cassandra that would not lower him in Denham ’s eyes . It then occurred to him that , perhaps , Katharine herself had confided in Denham ; they had something in common ; it was likely that they had discussed him that very afternoon . The desire to discover what they had said of him now came uppermost in his mind . He recalled Katharine ’s laugh ; he remembered that she had gone , laughing , to walk with Denham . “
158363	158368	158355	158355	you	2493	” he asked abruptly . “
158378	158405	158371	158371	We	2494	” This seemed to confirm Rodney ’s belief that he had been discussed . He turned over the unpalatable idea for a while , in silence . “
158413	158418	158411	158411	Denham	154	” he then exclaimed . “
158421	158474	158475	158475	You	2498	” said Denham , who seemed to himself possessed of complete understanding , not merely of women , but of the entire universe . He could read Rodney , too , like a book . He knew that he was unhappy , and he pitied him , and wished to help him . “
158506	158655	158656	158656	You	2500	” The remainder of the sentence was lost in the high wind , against which they had to struggle ; but Denham understood that he referred to Katharine ’s laughter , and that the memory of it was still hurting him . In comparison with Rodney , Denham felt himself very secure ; he saw Rodney as one of the lost birds dashed senseless against the glass ; one of the flying bodies of which the air was full . But he and Katharine were alone together , aloft , splendid , and luminous with a twofold radiance . He pitied the unstable creature beside him ; he felt a desire to protect him , exposed without the knowledge which made his own way so direct . They were united as the adventurous are united , though one reaches the goal and the other perishes by the way . “
158667	158703	158656	158656	You	2500	” This sentence , apparently addressed to no other human being , reached Denham ’s ears . The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it directly . Had Rodney spoken those words ? “
158708	158729	158706	158706	her	2502	” Was that his own voice , which seemed to sound in the air several yards in front of him ? “
158739	158740	158745	158745	I	0	” “
158749	158750	158745	158745	I	0	” “
158757	158758	158751	158751	She	2502	” “
158764	158784	158751	158751	She	2502	” The wind blew a space between the words — blew them so far away that they seemed unspoken . “
158791	158866	158789	158789	her	2502	” This was certainly spoken by the man at Denham ’s side . The voice had all the marks of Rodney ’s character , and recalled , with ; strange vividness , his personal appearance . Denham could see him against the blank buildings and towers of the horizon . He saw him dignified , exalted , and tragic , as he might have appeared thinking of Katharine alone in his rooms at night . “
158885	158908	158878	158878	I	0	” Ralph spoke distinctly and deliberately , as if Rodney ’s confession had made this statement necessary . Rodney exclaimed something inarticulate . “
158917	158921	158911	158911	I	0	” he cried , “
158935	158971	158930	158930	You	0	” The cry had a note of despair in it . Again the wind intercepted their words . They said no more . At length they drew up beneath a lamp - post , simultaneously . “
158983	159230	158930	158930	You	0	” Rodney exclaimed . They looked at each other , queerly , in the light of the lamp . Fools ! They seemed to confess to each other the extreme depths of their folly . For the moment , under the lamp - post , they seemed to be aware of some common knowledge which did away with the possibility of rivalry , and made them feel more sympathy for each other than for any one else in the world . Giving simultaneously a little nod , as if in confirmation of this understanding , they parted without speaking again . Between twelve and one that Sunday night Katharine lay in bed , not asleep , but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view of our own lot is possible ; or if we must be serious , our seriousness is tempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion . She saw the forms of Ralph , William , Cassandra , and herself , as if they were all equally unsubstantial , and , in putting off reality , had gained a kind of dignity which rested upon each impartially . Thus rid of any uncomfortable warmth of partisanship or load of obligation , she was dropping off to sleep when a light tap sounded upon her door . A moment later Cassandra stood beside her , holding a candle and speaking in the low tones proper to the time of night . “
159237	159238	159235	159235	Katharine	129	” “
159249	159268	159269	159269	I	0	” She roused herself , sat up , and asked what in Heaven ’s name Cassandra was doing ? “
159300	159301	159292	159292	I	0	” “
159310	159311	159292	159292	I	0	” “
159327	159361	159292	159292	I	0	” Cassandra spoke formally , almost solemnly ; the announcement was clearly prepared and marked a crisis of the utmost gravity . She continued what seemed to be part of a set speech . “
159391	159408	159376	159376	himself	176	” Katharine seemed to waken completely , and at once to be in control of herself . “
159413	159417	159376	159376	himself	176	” she asked . “
159430	159463	159376	159376	himself	176	” As if foreseeing that the interview might be long , and the night chilly , Katharine advised Cassandra to wrap herself in a quilt . Cassandra did so with unbroken solemnity . “
159471	159475	159376	159376	himself	176	” she said . “
159518	159537	159504	159504	I	0	” She was careful to abstain from looking in Katharine ’s direction . There was a slight pause . “
159551	159620	159539	159539	I	0	” said Katharine eventually . Her voice sounded so astonishingly equable that Cassandra glanced at her . It was impossible to suppose that she was either indignant or surprised ; she seemed , on the contrary , sitting up in bed , with her arms clasped round her knees and a little frown on her brow , to be thinking closely upon a matter of indifference to her . “
159636	159644	159622	159622	I	0	” Cassandra replied , and she added , “
159658	159659	159654	159656	some one else	1931	” “
159669	159673	159663	159663	him	1485	” Katharine inquired . “
159683	159688	159663	159663	him	1485	” Cassandra exclaimed indignantly . “
159701	159736	159737	159737	I	0	” This was the last of the sentences of her premeditated speech ; and having spoken it she was left unprovided with any more to say in that particular style . When Katharine remarked : “
159748	159757	159737	159737	I	0	” Cassandra ’s self - possession deserted her . “
159789	159790	159782	159782	I	0	” “
159800	159804	159798	159798	you	2514	” Katharine asked . “
159810	159814	159807	159807	I	0	” Cassandra admitted . “
159825	159826	159807	159807	I	0	” “
159829	159924	159807	159807	I	0	” Cassandra allowed once more . She was completely at a loss . In her forecast of the interview she had taken it for granted that Katharine , after an outburst of incredulity , would agree that Cassandra must return home as soon as possible . But Katharine , on the contrary , accepted her statement at once , seemed neither shocked nor surprised , and merely looked rather more thoughtful than usual . From being a mature woman charged with an important mission , Cassandra shrunk to the stature of an inexperienced child . “
159936	160024	159926	159926	you	2514	” she asked . Katharine made no answer , but still sat deliberating silently , and a certain feeling of alarm took possession of Cassandra . Perhaps her words had struck far deeper than she had thought , into depths beyond her reach , as so much of Katharine was beyond her reach . She thought suddenly that she had been playing with very dangerous tools . Looking at her at length , Katharine asked slowly , as if she found the question very difficult to ask . “
160032	160053	160027	160027	you	0	” She marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girl ’s expression , and how she looked away from her . “
160065	160078	160055	160055	you	0	” Cassandra asked , breathing quickly , and nervously moving her hands . “
160086	160090	160055	160055	you	0	” Katharine repeated . “
160103	160108	160109	160109	He	176	” Cassandra burst out . “
160117	160118	160109	160109	He	176	” “
160134	160138	160132	160132	Katharine	129	” Cassandra exclaimed . “
160170	160171	160164	160164	I	0	” “
160177	160185	160186	160186	Katharine	129	” said Katharine , after a pause . “
160188	160192	160186	160186	Katharine	129	” Cassandra cried . “
160200	160204	160186	160186	Katharine	129	” Katharine repeated . “
160213	160214	160206	160207	no one	2921	” “
160227	160232	160206	160207	no one	2921	” Cassandra said again . “
160255	160256	160247	160247	You	0	” “
160268	160282	160247	160247	You	0	” said Katharine , as if disposing of something for ever and ever . “
160298	160329	160296	160296	Katharine	129	” Cassandra said , her whole body and voice seeming to fall and collapse together , and no trace of anger or excitement remaining , but only a dreamy quietude . “
160338	160339	160330	160330	You	0	” “
160345	160408	160341	160341	I	0	” said Katharine . Cassandra remained bowed , as if by the weight of the revelation , for some little while longer . Nor did Katharine speak . Her attitude was that of some one who wishes to be concealed as much as possible from observation . She sighed profoundly ; she was absolutely silent , and apparently overcome by her thoughts . “
160416	160487	160341	160341	I	0	” she said at length , and shook her pillow , as if making ready for sleep . Cassandra rose obediently , and once more took up her candle . Perhaps the white dressing - gown , and the loosened hair , and something unseeing in the expression of the eyes gave her a likeness to a woman walking in her sleep . Katharine , at least , thought so . “
160500	160506	160341	160341	I	0	” Cassandra said , pausing . “
160524	160533	160518	160518	you	0	” For the first time their eyes met . “
160542	160634	160534	160534	You	0	” Cassandra exclaimed , as if she read the certainty there . But as she looked she saw a sight that surprised her . The tears rose slowly in Katharine ’s eyes and stood there , brimming but contained — the tears of some profound emotion , happiness , grief , renunciation ; an emotion so complex in its nature that to express it was impossible , and Cassandra , bending her head and receiving the tears upon her cheek , accepted them in silence as the consecration of her love . “
160639	160652	160637	160637	miss	2525	” said the maid , about eleven o’clock on the following morning , “
160660	160747	160653	160654	Mrs. Milvain	218	” A long wicker basket of flowers and branches had arrived from the country , and Katharine , kneeling upon the floor of the drawing - room , was sorting them while Cassandra watched her from an arm - chair , and absent - mindedly made spasmodic offers of help which were not accepted . The maid ’s message had a curious effect upon Katharine . She rose , walked to the window , and , the maid being gone , said emphatically and even tragically : “
160754	160760	160653	160654	Mrs. Milvain	218	” Cassandra had understood nothing . “
160768	160772	160761	160762	Aunt Celia	219	” Katharine repeated . “
160778	160785	160788	160788	she	219	” Cassandra asked , not unnaturally . “
160793	160808	160788	160788	she	219	” Katharine replied . Cassandra ’s thoughts flew to the subject of her preoccupation . “
160812	160816	160788	160788	she	219	” she inquired . “
160820	160824	160788	160788	she	219	” Katharine replied . “
160844	160869	160837	160837	I	0	” The sternness with which this was said suggested that to bring Aunt Celia upstairs was , for some reason , a disciplinary measure . “
160877	160891	160837	160837	I	0	” Cassandra exclaimed , jumping from her chair and showing signs of agitation , “
160909	161083	161084	161084	I	0	” Katharine assured her by nodding her head several times , but the manner in which she left the room was not calculated to inspire complete confidence in her diplomacy . Mrs. Milvain was sitting , or rather perching , upon the edge of a chair in the servants ’ room . Whether there was any sound reason for her choice of a subterranean chamber , or whether it corresponded with the spirit of her quest , Mrs. Milvain invariably came in by the back door and sat in the servants ’ room when she was engaged in confidential family transactions . The ostensible reason she gave was that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Hilbery should be disturbed . But , in truth , Mrs. Milvain depended even more than most elderly women of her generation upon the delicious emotions of intimacy , agony , and secrecy , and the additional thrill provided by the basement was one not lightly to be forfeited . She protested almost plaintively when Katharine proposed to go upstairs . “
161097	161110	161088	161088	I	0	” she said , hesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush . “
161118	161119	161088	161088	I	0	” “
161136	161216	161130	161130	We	2533	” Mrs. Milvain objected , taking the precaution to speak in a whisper already . But as Katharine ’s presence was absolutely necessary to the success of the interview , and as Katharine obstinately receded up the kitchen stairs , Mrs. Milvain had no course but to follow her . She glanced furtively about her as she proceeded upstairs , drew her skirts together , and stepped with circumspection past all doors , whether they were open or shut . “
161222	161239	161240	161240	I	0	” she murmured , when the comparative sanctuary of the drawing - room had been reached . “
161248	161267	161243	161243	I	0	” she added , glancing at the flowers strewn upon the floor . A moment later she inquired , “
161275	161287	161288	161288	Cassandra	303	” noticing a handkerchief that Cassandra had dropped in her flight . “
161299	161338	161288	161288	Cassandra	303	” said Katharine , and she spoke so firmly and clearly that Mrs. Milvain glanced nervously at the main door and then at the curtain which divided the little room with the relics from the drawing - room . “
161347	161351	161341	161341	Cassandra	303	” she remarked . “
161361	161462	161354	161354	William	176	” Katharine sat down opposite her aunt and said neither yes nor no . She looked past her , and it might have been thought that she was considering very critically the pattern of the curtains . Another advantage of the basement , from Mrs. Milvain ’s point of view , was that it made it necessary to sit very close together , and the light was dim compared with that which now poured through three windows upon Katharine and the basket of flowers , and gave even the slight angular figure of Mrs. Milvain herself a halo of gold . “
161469	161541	161463	161463	They	2538	” said Katharine abruptly , with a little jerk of her head . Mrs. Milvain felt that it would be easier to tell her niece what she wished to say if they were actually in physical contact , for the spiritual distance between them was formidable . Katharine , however , made no overtures , and Mrs. Milvain , who was possessed of rash but heroic courage , plunged without preface : “
161585	161586	161573	161573	I	0	” “
161597	161606	161594	161595	Aunt Celia	219	” said Katharine , with apparent good humor . “
161688	161817	161679	161679	he	176	” Mrs. Milvain , whose words had run themselves together , and whose voice had raised its tone almost to one of protest , here ceased , and looked intently at Katharine , as if to judge the effect of her communication . A slight rigidity had passed over Katharine ’s face . Her lips were pressed together ; her eyes were contracted , and they were still fixed upon the curtain . These superficial changes covered an extreme inner loathing such as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent spectacle . The indecent spectacle was her own action beheld for the first time from the outside ; her aunt ’s words made her realize how infinitely repulsive the body of life is without its soul . “
161820	161844	161679	161679	he	176	” she said at length . Mrs. Milvain made a gesture as if to bring her closer , but it was not returned . “
161887	161888	161879	161879	she	303	” “
161897	161901	161894	161895	Aunt Celia	219	” said Katharine . “
161907	161908	161904	161904	Cassandra	303	” “
161923	161929	161909	161909	Cassandra	303	” said Mrs. Milvain warmly . “
161948	161949	161939	161939	I	0	” “
161955	161995	161950	161950	I	0	” Katharine persisted . Mrs. Milvain looked at her . Was it possible that Katharine really doubted ? That there was something that Mrs. Milvain herself did not understand ? She braced herself , and pronounced the tremendous words : “
162003	162014	161996	161996	Cassandra	303	” Still the words seemed to have curiously little effect . “
162019	162023	161996	161996	Cassandra	303	” said Katharine , “
162033	162034	162025	162025	he	176	” “
162049	162065	162047	162047	Katharine	129	” Katharine remained silent . The silence alarmed Mrs. Milvain , and she began hurriedly : “
162120	162133	162118	162118	Katharine	129	” Again she stretched forth her arms , but they remained empty . “
162145	162150	162151	162151	You	129	” said Katharine suddenly . “
162162	162193	162151	162151	You	129	” Katharine spoke so low and with such restraint that Mrs. Milvain had to strain to catch her words , and when she heard them she was dazed by them . “
162205	162244	162200	162200	I	0	” she exclaimed . She quivered , and a kind of sob shook her ; but even to have made Katharine angry was some relief , and allowed her to feel some of the agreeable sensations of martyrdom . “
162247	162254	162200	162200	I	0	” said Katharine , standing up , “
162286	162363	162279	162279	We	2554	” At these words Mrs. Milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive ; she glanced at her niece ’s face , but read no pity there , whereupon she folded her hands upon a black velvet bag which she carried in an attitude that was almost one of prayer . Whatever divinity she prayed to , if pray she did , at any rate she recovered her dignity in a singular way and faced her niece . “
162367	162378	162425	162425	she	212	” she said slowly and with emphasis upon every word , “
162439	162458	162434	162434	You	373	” Katharine seemed to judge this defence upon its merits , and then to convict it of falsity . “
162472	162717	162459	162459	I	0	” she said . At these words Mrs. Milvain rose and stood for a moment beside her niece . She had never met with such treatment before , and she did not know with what weapons to break down the terrible wall of resistance offered her by one who , by virtue of youth and beauty and sex , should have been all tears and supplications . But Mrs. Milvain herself was obstinate ; upon a matter of this kind she could not admit that she was either beaten or mistaken . She beheld herself the champion of married love in its purity and supremacy ; what her niece stood for she was quite unable to say , but she was filled with the gravest suspicions . The old woman and the young woman stood side by side in unbroken silence . Mrs. Milvain could not make up her mind to withdraw while her principles trembled in the balance and her curiosity remained unappeased . She ransacked her mind for some question that should force Katharine to enlighten her , but the supply was limited , the choice difficult , and while she hesitated the door opened and William Rodney came in . He carried in his hand an enormous and splendid bunch of white and purple flowers , and , either not seeing Mrs. Milvain , or disregarding her , he advanced straight to Katharine , and presented the flowers with the words : “
162725	162897	162898	162898	I	0	” Katharine took them with a glance that Mrs. Milvain did not fail to intercept . But with all her experience , she did not know what to make of it . She watched anxiously for further illumination . William greeted her without obvious sign of guilt , and , explaining that he had a holiday , both he and Katharine seemed to take it for granted that his holiday should be celebrated with flowers and spent in Cheyne Walk . A pause followed ; that , too , was natural ; and Mrs. Milvain began to feel that she laid herself open to a charge of selfishness if she stayed . The mere presence of a young man had altered her disposition curiously , and filled her with a desire for a scene which should end in an emotional forgiveness . She would have given much to clasp both nephew and niece in her arms . But she could not flatter herself that any hope of the customary exaltation remained . “
162902	162991	162898	162898	I	0	” she said , and she was conscious of an extreme flatness of spirit . Neither of them said anything to stop her . William politely escorted her downstairs , and somehow , amongst her protests and embarrassments , Mrs. Milvain forgot to say good - bye to Katharine . She departed , murmuring words about masses of flowers and a drawing - room always beautiful even in the depths of winter . William came back to Katharine ; he found her standing where he had left her . “
162999	163003	162992	162992	I	0	” he said . “
163031	163087	163088	163088	She	2564	” She could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of the impression that her aunt had made on her . It seemed to her that the very flowers were contaminated , and Cassandra ’s pocket - handkerchief , for Mrs. Milvain had used them for evidence in her investigations . “
163095	163099	163088	163088	She	2564	” she said , “
163111	163112	163107	163107	people	383	” “
163116	163120	163113	163114	Mrs. Milvain	218	” Rodney exclaimed . “
163127	163136	163123	163123	she	2564	” His air of open confidence entirely vanished . “
163159	163160	163152	163152	you	218	” “
163166	163170	163161	163161	They	383	” he asked . “
163182	163183	163184	163184	I	0	” “
163191	163243	163184	163184	I	0	” he exclaimed . He walked to the window in evident perturbation . Katharine was too indignant to attend to him . She was swept away by the force of her own anger . Clasping Rodney ’s flowers , she stood upright and motionless . Rodney turned away from the window . “
163251	163255	163256	163256	I	0	” he said . “
163289	163290	163291	163291	She	2567	” “
163298	163308	163309	163309	She	2567	” Katharine burst out , not listening to him . “
163328	163329	163322	163322	she	2567	” “
163370	163382	163383	163383	You	0	” At length Katharine realized some part of what he meant . “
163394	163400	163383	163383	You	0	” she asked in amazement . “
163404	163410	163383	163383	You	0	” he said , flushing . “
163438	163444	163436	163436	Cassandra	303	” He paused in embarrassment . “
163453	163463	163445	163445	I	0	” he resumed , with a change of voice , “
163520	163629	163507	163507	you	129	” No doubt her beauty , intensified by emotion and enhanced by the flowers of bright color and strange shape which she carried wrought upon Rodney , and had its share in bestowing upon her the old romance . But a less noble passion worked in him , too ; he was inflamed by jealousy . His tentative offer of affection had been rudely and , as he thought , completely repulsed by Cassandra on the preceding day . Denham ’s confession was in his mind . And ultimately , Katharine ’s dominion over him was of the sort that the fevers of the night can not exorcise . “
163641	163650	163651	163651	I	0	” she said gently , disregarding his question . “
163682	163683	163674	163674	I	0	” “
163687	163691	163684	163684	You	0	” William exclaimed . “
163770	163822	163823	163823	She	303	” Katharine hesitated . She was confused , agitated , physically tired , and had already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings . She sank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap . “
163827	163831	163823	163823	She	303	” Rodney continued . “
163889	164079	163885	163885	you	129	” He stood over her , as if in readiness to seize the first sign of her assent . Precisely at that moment , owing , perhaps , to her vicissitudes of feeling , all sense of love left her , as in a moment a mist lifts from the earth . And when the mist departed a skeleton world and blankness alone remained — a terrible prospect for the eyes of the living to behold . He saw the look of terror in her face , and without understanding its origin , took her hand in his . With the sense of companionship returned a desire , like that of a child for shelter , to accept what he had to offer her — and at that moment it seemed that he offered her the only thing that could make it tolerable to live . She let him press his lips to her cheek , and leant her head upon his arm . It was the moment of his triumph . It was the only moment in which she belonged to him and was dependent upon his protection . “
164086	164090	164091	164091	you	2574	” he murmured , “
164101	164115	164097	164097	You	2574	” For a moment she remained silent . He then heard her murmur : “
164124	164125	164126	164126	Cassandra	303	” “
164128	164132	164126	164126	Cassandra	303	” he whispered . “
164137	164153	164133	164133	She	303	” Katharine repeated . She raised herself and repeated the sentence yet a third time . “
164158	164312	164154	164154	She	303	” William slowly raised himself . He believed instinctively what Katharine said , but what it meant to him he was unable to understand . Could Cassandra love him ? Could she have told Katharine that she loved him ? The desire to know the truth of this was urgent , unknown though the consequences might be . The thrill of excitement associated with the thought of Cassandra once more took possession of him . No longer was it the excitement of anticipation and ignorance ; it was the excitement of something greater than a possibility , for now he knew her and had measure of the sympathy between them . But who could give him certainty ? Could Katharine , Katharine who had lately lain in his arms , Katharine herself the most admired of women ? He looked at her , with doubt , and with anxiety , but said nothing . “
164317	164327	164335	164335	she	0	” she said , interpreting his wish for assurance , “
164340	164341	164335	164335	she	0	” “
164346	164350	164342	164342	She	0	” Katharine nodded . “
164393	164409	164390	164390	I	0	” He clenched his hands and turned away . He suddenly faced her and demanded : “
164418	164419	164413	164413	you	0	” “
164424	164428	164413	164413	you	0	” she asked . “
164431	164448	164413	164413	you	0	” she exclaimed , as if she had found the answer to some momentarily perplexing question . “
164488	164544	164479	164479	I	0	” He tried to compose himself . He walked up and down the room ; he paused at the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor . Meanwhile his desire to have Katharine ’s assurance confirmed became so insistent that he could no longer deny the overmastering strength of his feeling for Cassandra . “
164549	164571	164545	164545	You	0	” he exclaimed , coming to a standstill and rapping his knuckles sharply upon a small table carrying one slender vase . “
164576	164600	164572	164572	I	0	” As he said this , the curtains hanging at the door of the little room parted , and Cassandra herself stepped forth . “
164607	164625	164572	164572	I	0	” she exclaimed . A pause succeeded this announcement . Rodney made a step forward and said : “
164641	164662	164638	164638	your	0	” She put her hands before her face ; she turned away and seemed to shrink from both of them . “
164667	164671	164664	164664	Katharine	129	” she murmured . “
164674	164696	164717	164717	Katharine	129	” she added , raising her head with a look of fear from the kiss with which he greeted her admission , “
164727	164728	164717	164717	Katharine	129	” “
164738	164743	164717	164717	Katharine	129	” William answered her , “
164765	164766	164752	164752	you	129	” “
164772	164776	164770	164770	William	176	” Katharine interposed ; “
164798	164856	164789	164789	she	303	” But , still holding William ’s hand , questions and desires welled up in Cassandra ’s heart . Had she done wrong in listening ? Why did Aunt Celia blame her ? Did Katharine think her right ? Above all , did William really love her , for ever and ever , better than any one ? “
164866	164870	164864	164864	Katharine	129	” she exclaimed . “
164880	164881	164864	164864	Katharine	129	” “
164888	164910	164864	164864	Katharine	129	” said Katharine . She moved a little away from where they sat and began half - consciously sorting her flowers . “
164918	164922	164912	164912	you	129	” Cassandra said . “
164943	164947	164937	164937	I	0	” she added . “
164968	164969	164963	164963	You	129	” “
164977	164981	164970	164970	I	0	” William interposed . “
164985	164989	164970	164970	I	0	that”—Cassandra tried to enlighten him—“it
164993	164994	164970	164970	I	0	” “
165009	165010	165004	165004	I	0	” “
165013	165017	165004	165004	I	0	” Cassandra interposed . “
165068	165109	165064	165064	anybody	1337	” Katharine had listened to this attempt at analysis with keen attention . Cassandra ’s words seemed to rub the old blurred image of life and freshen it so marvelously that it looked new again . She turned to William . “
165115	165119	165064	165064	anybody	1337	” she said . “
165126	165127	165122	165122	nobody	2970	” “
165141	165152	165153	165153	I	0	” Cassandra continued , still reading from her invisible book . “
165187	165199	165171	165171	you	129	” They were silent . At length William broke the silence . “
165208	165225	165202	165202	I	0	” he said , and the old nervousness of manner returned as he glanced at Katharine . “
165274	165310	165313	165313	I	0	” Cassandra ratified this conclusion so far as she was concerned , and William , after receiving the exquisite pleasure of her glance , with its absolute affection and trust , looked anxiously at Katharine . “
165317	165322	165313	165313	I	0	” she assured him . “
165335	165336	165327	165327	We	2587	” “
165343	165477	165339	165339	Katharine	129	” Cassandra cried , holding out her arms while the tears ran down her cheeks . The day was so different from other days to three people in the house that the common routine of household life — the maid waiting at table , Mrs. Hilbery writing a letter , the clock striking , and the door opening , and all the other signs of long - established civilization appeared suddenly to have no meaning save as they lulled Mr. and Mrs. Hilbery into the belief that nothing unusual had taken place . It chanced that Mrs. Hilbery was depressed without visible cause , unless a certain crudeness verging upon coarseness in the temper of her favorite Elizabethans could be held responsible for the mood . At any rate , she had shut up “
165482	165827	165313	165313	I	0	” with a sigh , and wished to know , so she told Rodney at dinner , whether there was n’t some young writer with a touch of the great spirit — somebody who made you believe that life was beautiful ? She got little help from Rodney , and after singing her plaintive requiem for the death of poetry by herself , she charmed herself into good spirits again by remembering the existence of Mozart . She begged Cassandra to play to her , and when they went upstairs Cassandra opened the piano directly , and did her best to create an atmosphere of unmixed beauty . At the sound of the first notes Katharine and Rodney both felt an enormous sense of relief at the license which the music gave them to loosen their hold upon the mechanism of behavior . They lapsed into the depths of thought . Mrs. Hilbery was soon spirited away into a perfectly congenial mood , that was half reverie and half slumber , half delicious melancholy and half pure bliss . Mr. Hilbery alone attended . He was extremely musical , and made Cassandra aware that he listened to every note . She played her best , and won his approval . Leaning slightly forward in his chair , and turning his little green stone , he weighed the intention of her phrases approvingly , but stopped her suddenly to complain of a noise behind him . The window was unhasped . He signed to Rodney , who crossed the room immediately to put the matter right . He stayed a moment longer by the window than was , perhaps , necessary , and having done what was needed , drew his chair a little closer than before to Katharine ’s side . The music went on . Under cover of some exquisite run of melody , he leant towards her and whispered something . She glanced at her father and mother , and a moment later left the room , almost unobserved , with Rodney . “
165832	165890	165313	165313	I	0	” she asked , as soon as the door was shut . Rodney made no answer , but led her downstairs into the dining - room on the ground floor . Even when he had shut the door he said nothing , but went straight to the window and parted the curtains . He beckoned to Katharine . “
165896	165900	165892	165892	he	2589	” he said . “
165911	166020	166021	166021	Denham	154	” Katharine looked . She had no idea what Rodney was talking about . A vague feeling of alarm and mystery possessed her . She saw a man standing on the opposite side of the road facing the house beneath a lamp - post . As they looked the figure turned , walked a few steps , and came back again to his old position . It seemed to her that he was looking fixedly at her , and was conscious of her gaze on him . She knew , in a flash , who the man was who was watching them . She drew the curtain abruptly . “
166023	166027	166021	166021	Denham	154	” said Rodney . “
166035	166085	166028	166028	He	154	” He spoke sternly . His whole manner had become full of authority . Katharine felt almost as if he accused her of some crime . She was pale and uncomfortably agitated , as much by the strangeness of Rodney ’s behavior as by the sight of Ralph Denham . “
166092	166097	166098	166098	You	154	” she said defiantly . “
166115	166145	166107	166107	I	0	” Rodney spoke with such decision that when he raised his arm Katharine expected him to draw the curtain instantly . She caught his hand with a little exclamation . “
166148	166152	166153	166153	I	0	” she cried . “
166159	166160	166161	166161	You	0	” “
166166	166170	166161	166161	You	0	” he replied . “
166177	166185	166171	166171	You	0	” His hand remained upon the curtain . “
166194	166213	166189	166189	you	0	” he broke out , looking at her with an expression of contempt as well as of anger , “
166230	166252	166253	166253	I	0	” She looked at him , wondering , in spite of all her perplexity , at the spirit that possessed him . “
166261	166275	166253	166253	I	0	” she said . He reflected , and then took his hand away . “
166283	166287	166288	166288	I	0	” he concluded . “
166309	166310	166335	166335	You	0	” “
166319	166334	166313	166313	I	0	” she said , shaking her head . She bent her head in thought . “
166341	166379	166380	166380	I	0	” Rodney said suddenly . His tone had lost something of its sternness , and might have been used to urge a child to confess its fault . She raised her eyes and fixed them upon him . “
166384	166460	166382	166382	him	154	” she repeated . He nodded . She searched his face , as if for further confirmation of his words , and , as he remained silent and expectant , turned away once more and continued her thoughts . He observed her closely , but without stirring , as if he gave her time to make up her mind to fulfil her obvious duty . The strains of Mozart reached them from the room above . “
166463	166517	166382	166382	him	154	” she said suddenly , with a sort of desperation , rising from her chair and seeming to command Rodney to fulfil his part . He drew the curtain instantly , and she made no attempt to stop him . Their eyes at once sought the same spot beneath the lamp - post . “
166523	166572	166518	166518	He	2593	” she exclaimed . No one was there . William threw the window up and looked out . The wind rushed into the room , together with the sound of distant wheels , footsteps hurrying along the pavement , and the cries of sirens hooting down the river . “
166575	166579	166580	166580	Ralph	154	” William cried . “
166582	166655	166656	166656	Rodney	176	” said Katharine , but she spoke scarcely louder than she might have spoken to some one in the same room . With their eyes fixed upon the opposite side of the road , they did not notice a figure close to the railing which divided the garden from the street . But Denham had crossed the road and was standing there . They were startled by his voice close at hand . “
166658	166659	166656	166656	Rodney	176	” “
166669	166680	166667	166667	Denham	154	” Rodney went to the front door and opened it . “
166685	166791	166682	166682	he	154	” he said , bringing Ralph with him into the dining - room where Katharine stood , with her back to the open window . Their eyes met for a second . Denham looked half dazed by the strong light , and , buttoned in his overcoat , with his hair ruffled across his forehead by the wind , he seemed like somebody rescued from an open boat out at sea . William promptly shut the window and drew the curtains . He acted with a cheerful decision as if he were master of the situation , and knew exactly what he meant to do . “
166803	166807	166801	166801	Denham	154	” he said . “
166819	166820	166808	166808	Katharine	129	” “
166826	166920	166823	166823	I	0	” Ralph began vaguely , holding out his hat and glancing about him ; he balanced it carefully against a silver bowl that stood upon the sideboard . He then sat himself down rather heavily at the head of the oval dinner - table . Rodney stood on one side of him and Katharine on the other . He appeared to be presiding over some meeting from which most of the members were absent . Meanwhile , he waited , and his eyes rested upon the glow of the beautifully polished mahogany table . “
166927	166996	166997	166997	I	0	” said Katharine briefly . At that Denham looked up quickly at Rodney . Rodney ’s expression changed . He lost his self - possession . He smiled a little nervously , and then his attention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the floor above . He seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the others . He glanced towards the door . “
167001	167005	166997	166997	I	0	” said Denham . “
167023	167027	167021	167021	Denham	154	” he said . “
167038	167066	167036	167036	mine	2596	” He looked oddly round the room as if he wished to make sure that the scene in which he played a part had some real existence . “
167070	167074	167076	167076	Katharine	129	” he repeated . “
167078	167111	167112	167112	Katharine	129	” His gaze rested upon her finally , as if she , too , had changed from his old view of her . He smiled at her as if to encourage her . “
167116	167224	167112	167112	Katharine	129	” he said , and giving a little nod to Denham , he left the room . Katharine sat down at once , and leant her chin upon her hands . So long as Rodney was in the room the proceedings of the evening had seemed to be in his charge , and had been marked by a certain unreality . Now that she was alone with Ralph she felt at once that a constraint had been taken from them both . She felt that they were alone at the bottom of the house , which rose , story upon story , upon the top of them . “
167232	167236	167227	167227	you	2597	” she asked . “
167244	167248	167249	167249	You	2598	” he replied . “
167284	167285	167276	167276	you	2598	” “
167297	167298	167293	167293	you	2597	” “
167303	167309	167299	167299	I	0	” She had called unconsciously . “
167316	167325	167310	167310	They	2600	” she told him , after a pause . “
167330	167339	167326	167326	You	2598	” he asked . She bent her head . “
167344	167348	167326	167326	You	2598	” she sighed . “
167366	167374	167360	167360	he	176	” Ralph made a sound of understanding . “
167382	167386	167375	167375	You	2597	” she asked . “
167393	167451	167389	167389	I	0	” Denham replied . The words seemed to fill the room with an emotion which Katharine connected with the sound of distant wheels , the footsteps hurrying along the pavement , the cries of sirens hooting down the river , the darkness and the wind . She saw the upright figure standing beneath the lamp - post . “
167457	167475	167389	167389	I	0	” she said , glancing at the window , as if he saw what she was seeing . “
167483	167488	167489	167489	I	0	” She broke off . “
167506	167589	167499	167499	you	2597	” Placing her elbows on the table , she slid her ruby ring up and down her finger abstractedly . She frowned at the rows of leather - bound books opposite her . Ralph looked keenly at her . Very pale , but sternly concentrated upon her meaning , beautiful but so little aware of herself as to seem remote from him also , there was something distant and abstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time . “
167596	167600	167592	167592	you	2597	” he said . “
167613	167614	167611	167611	you	2597	” “
167626	167705	167706	167706	I	0	” she mused . Some detached instinct made her aware that she was gazing at a book which belonged by rights to some other part of the house . She walked over to the shelf , took it down , and returned to her seat , placing the book on the table between them . Ralph opened it and looked at the portrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt - collar , which formed the frontispiece . “
167715	167723	167713	167713	Katharine	129	” he affirmed , shutting the book . “
167734	167735	167730	167730	I	0	” “
167745	167746	167737	167737	you	0	” “
167793	167794	167787	167787	I	0	” “
167799	167803	167787	167787	I	0	” she replied , “
167867	167880	167863	167863	I	0	” she went on quickly , changing her position and frowning again , “
167889	167890	167863	167863	I	0	” “
167897	167959	167863	167863	I	0	” he urged . But she could not reduce her vision to words , since it was no single shape colored upon the dark , but rather a general excitement , an atmosphere , which , when she tried to visualize it , took form as a wind scouring the flanks of northern hills and flashing light upon cornfields and pools . “
167962	167980	167863	167863	I	0	” she sighed , laughing at the ridiculous notion of putting any part of this into words . “
167985	167990	167983	167983	Katharine	129	” Ralph urged her . “
168011	168026	167995	167995	I’m	0	” She was dismayed by the expression of longing and despair upon his face . “
168039	168043	168027	168027	I	0	” she attempted . “
168055	168056	168049	168049	I	0	” “
168062	168067	168049	168049	I	0	” he pressed her . “
168074	168090	168070	168070	I	0	” She seemed to be disappointing the desire of a child . His face fell . “
168097	168098	168099	168099	I	0	” “
168104	168116	168099	168099	I	0	” She could not explain that she was essentially alone there . “
168144	168145	168139	168139	You	0	” “
168164	168165	168161	168161	you	0	” “
168171	168175	168168	168168	I	0	” she sighed . “
168184	168192	168161	168161	you	0	” She turned upon him almost fiercely . “
168200	168204	168193	168193	You	0	” she said . “
168209	168214	168205	168205	I	0	” he replied roughly , “
168218	168348	168216	168216	I	0	” He stopped . He realized that the moment had come to impart that news of the utmost importance which he had tried to impart to Mary Datchet , to Rodney upon the Embankment , to the drunken tramp upon the seat . How should he offer it to Katharine ? He looked quickly at her . He saw that she was only half attentive to him ; only a section of her was exposed to him . The sight roused in him such desperation that he had much ado to control his impulse to rise and leave the house . Her hand lay loosely curled upon the table . He seized it and grasped it firmly as if to make sure of her existence and of his own . “
168356	168521	168354	168354	Katharine	129	” he said . Some roundness or warmth essential to that statement was absent from his voice , and she had merely to shake her head very slightly for him to drop her hand and turn away in shame at his own impotence . He thought that she had detected his wish to leave her . She had discerned the break in his resolution , the blankness in the heart of his vision . It was true that he had been happier out in the street , thinking of her , than now that he was in the same room with her . He looked at her with a guilty expression on his face . But her look expressed neither disappointment nor reproach . Her pose was easy , and she seemed to give effect to a mood of quiet speculation by the spinning of her ruby ring upon the polished table . Denham forgot his despair in wondering what thoughts now occupied her . “
168528	168544	168522	168522	You	2613	” he said . His tone was humble , and made her smile at him . “
168564	168572	168555	168555	you	0	” she asked , holding it out . “
168585	168599	168576	168576	you	2613	” he replied , in the same tone of half - humorous gravity . “
168621	168622	168613	168613	you	2613	” “
168634	168635	168626	168626	I	0	” “
168652	168658	168647	168647	I	0	” she added casually enough . “
168662	168674	168647	168647	I	0	” she said slipping her ring back to its old position , “
168685	168701	168647	168647	I	0	” She looked at him gravely and inquiringly , as if in search of help . “
168720	168724	168716	168716	I	0	” he stated . “
168729	168767	168726	168726	I	0	” she replied . In order to explain to her his state of mind , Ralph recounted his experience with the photograph , the letter , and the flower picked at Kew . She listened very seriously . “
168777	168781	168770	168770	you	0	” she mused . “
168828	168832	168819	168819	One	422	” she hazarded . “
168855	168890	168891	168891	Rodney	176	” This conclusion seemed fantastic and profoundly unsatisfactory to Ralph , but after the astonishing variations of his own sentiments during the past half - hour he could not accuse her of fanciful exaggeration . “
168901	168937	168891	168891	Rodney	176	” he said almost bitterly . The music , which had ceased , had now begun again , and the melody of Mozart seemed to express the easy and exquisite love of the two upstairs . “
168948	168960	168946	168946	we	2617	” she glanced at him as if to ascertain his position , “
168970	168971	168963	168964	each other	451	” “
168978	168979	168963	168964	each other	451	” “
168987	169110	168963	168964	each other	451	” she concluded , as the window shook beneath the pressure of the wind . They listened to the sound in silence . Here the door opened with considerable hesitation , and Mrs. Hilbery ’s head appeared , at first with an air of caution , but having made sure that she had admitted herself to the dining - room and not to some more unusual region , she came completely inside and seemed in no way taken aback by the sight she saw . She seemed , as usual , bound on some quest of her own which was interrupted pleasantly but strangely by running into one of those queer , unnecessary ceremonies that other people thought fit to indulge in . “
169121	169145	169119	169119	Mr.	2620	” she was at a loss , as usual , for the name , and Katharine thought that she did not recognize him . “
169156	169168	169169	169169	Byron	220	” she added , pointing to the book upon the table . “
169184	169278	169175	169175	I	0	” she said . Katharine , who had risen in some confusion , could not help smiling at the thought that her mother found it perfectly natural and desirable that her daughter should be reading Byron in the dining - room late at night alone with a strange young man . She blessed a disposition that was so convenient , and felt tenderly towards her mother and her mother ’s eccentricities . But Ralph observed that although Mrs. Hilbery held the book so close to her eyes she was not reading a word . “
169290	169311	169279	169281	My dear mother	2621	” Katharine exclaimed , changing astonishingly in the space of a minute to her usual condition of authoritative good sense . “
169318	169319	169320	169320	I	0	” “
169336	169345	169332	169333	Lord Byron	220	” said Mrs. Hilbery , addressing Ralph Denham . “
169364	169374	169353	169353	he	131	” Katharine said , as if prompting her memory . “
169381	169416	169353	169353	he	131	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed , with a sudden laugh that rather puzzled her daughter . Ralph found that she had turned upon him a gaze that was at once very vague and very penetrating . “
169437	169443	169427	169427	I	0	” Mrs. Hilbery continued . ( “
169450	169456	169427	169427	I	0	” she added parenthetically . ) “
169466	169471	169427	169427	I	0	” she went on , “
169504	169508	169496	169496	I	0	” she added . “
169523	169542	169496	169496	I	0	” She waved her hand , as if to indicate the wealth of unwritten poetry all about them . “
169566	169570	169597	169598	Mr. Denham	131	” she sighed , “
169600	169768	169597	169598	Mr. Denham	131	” During this speech of her mother ’s Katharine had turned away , and Ralph felt that Mrs. Hilbery was talking to him apart , with a desire to ascertain something about him which she veiled purposely by the vagueness of her words . He felt curiously encouraged and heartened by the beam in her eye rather than by her actual words . From the distance of her age and sex she seemed to be waving to him , hailing him as a ship sinking beneath the horizon might wave its flag of greeting to another setting out upon the same voyage . He bent his head , saying nothing , but with a curious certainty that she had read an answer to her inquiry that satisfied her . At any rate , she rambled off into a description of the Law Courts which turned to a denunciation of English justice , which , according to her , imprisoned poor men who could n’t pay their debts . “
169780	169884	169597	169598	Mr. Denham	131	” she asked , but at this point Katharine gently insisted that her mother should go to bed . Looking back from half - way up the staircase , Katharine seemed to see Denham ’s eyes watching her steadily and intently with an expression that she had guessed in them when he stood looking at the windows across the road . The tray which brought Katharine ’s cup of tea the next morning brought , also , a note from her mother , announcing that it was her intention to catch an early train to Stratford - on - Avon that very day . “
169895	169900	169597	169598	Mr. Denham	131	” the note ran , “
169930	170425	169925	169925	Shakespeare	170	” This was no momentary impulse . Mrs. Hilbery had been dreaming of Shakespeare any time these six months , toying with the idea of an excursion to what she considered the heart of the civilized world . To stand six feet above Shakespeare ’s bones , to see the very stones worn by his feet , to reflect that the oldest man ’s oldest mother had very likely seen Shakespeare ’s daughter — such thoughts roused an emotion in her , which she expressed at unsuitable moments , and with a passion that would not have been unseemly in a pilgrim to a sacred shrine . The only strange thing was that she wished to go by herself . But , naturally enough , she was well provided with friends who lived in the neighborhood of Shakespeare ’s tomb , and were delighted to welcome her ; and she left later to catch her train in the best of spirits . There was a man selling violets in the street . It was a fine day . She would remember to send Mr. Hilbery the first daffodil she saw . And , as she ran back into the hall to tell Katharine , she felt , she had always felt , that Shakespeare ’s command to leave his bones undisturbed applied only to odious curiosity - mongers — not to dear Sir John and herself . Leaving her daughter to cogitate the theory of Anne Hathaway ’s sonnets , and the buried manuscripts here referred to , with the implied menace to the safety of the heart of civilization itself , she briskly shut the door of her taxi - cab , and was whirled off upon the first stage of her pilgrimage . The house was oddly different without her . Katharine found the maids already in possession of her room , which they meant to clean thoroughly during her absence . To Katharine it seemed as if they had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters . It seemed to her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap of dust . The china shepherdesses were already shining from a bath of hot water . The writing - table might have belonged to a professional man of methodical habits . Gathering together a few papers upon which she was at work , Katharine proceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through them , perhaps , in the course of the morning . But she was met on the stairs by Cassandra , who followed her up , but with such intervals between each step that Katharine began to feel her purpose dwindling before they had reached the door . Cassandra leant over the banisters , and looked down upon the Persian rug that lay on the floor of the hall . “
170434	170438	169925	169925	Shakespeare	170	” she inquired . “
170457	170506	170608	170608	Henry	333	” The dull old letters , which would have turned the heads of the most sober of collectors , were laid upon a table , and , after a moment ’s pause , Cassandra , looking grave all of a sudden , asked Katharine where she should find the “
170510	170559	170560	170560	I	0	” by Lord Macaulay . It was downstairs in Mr. Hilbery ’s study . The cousins descended together in search of it . They diverged into the drawing - room for the good reason that the door was open . The portrait of Richard Alardyce attracted their attention . “
170567	170580	170563	170563	he	2632	” It was a question that Katharine had often asked herself lately . “
170597	170601	170593	170593	Henry	333	” Cassandra replied . “
170611	170656	170608	170608	Henry	333	” she added a little defensively . Down they went into Mr. Hilbery ’s study , where they began to look among his books . So desultory was this examination that some fifteen minutes failed to discover the work they were in search of . “
170666	170677	170678	170678	I	0	” Katharine asked , with a stretch of her arms . “
170681	170686	170678	170678	I	0	” Cassandra replied briefly . “
170702	170703	170689	170689	I	0	” “
170747	170748	170740	170740	I	0	” “
170754	170764	170751	170751	William	170	” Katharine asked , turning to the shelves again . “
170773	170774	170751	170751	William	170	” “
170788	170789	170785	170785	you	0	” “
170802	170803	170799	170799	you	0	” “
170806	170807	170799	170799	you	0	” “
170816	170817	170818	170818	I	0	” “
170823	170827	170828	170828	I	0	” Katharine replied . “
170836	170841	170828	170828	I	0	” she said impulsively , “
170852	170853	170828	170828	I	0	” “
170859	170860	170855	170857	the same man	2635	” “
170878	170879	170874	170876	some one else	1931	” “
170885	170898	170874	170876	some one else	1931	” said Katharine , turning round with the book in her hand . “
170921	170922	170899	170899	I	0	” “
170927	170938	170924	170925	Lord Macaulay	361	” cried Cassandra , slapping the book upon the table . “
170945	170946	170940	170940	you	0	” “
170953	170958	170947	170947	We	2638	” Katharine replied evasively . “
170971	171013	171015	171015	you	0	” said Cassandra , looking ruefully at the dull red cover of the prescribed volume , which , however , possessed a talismanic property , since William admired it . He had advised a little serious reading for the morning hours . “
171019	171023	171015	171015	you	0	” she asked . “
171033	171088	171026	171026	William	170	” As she spoke she saw the light fade from Cassandra ’s face , as if she had implied some other , more mysterious , relationship . She was stung with compunction . She marveled at her own rashness in having influenced the life of another , as she had influenced Cassandra ’s life . “
171094	171099	171089	171089	We	2639	” she said quickly . “
171106	171308	171101	171101	I	0	” said Cassandra , with a little shudder , and her look showed that she spoke the truth . She turned and glanced at Katharine as she had never glanced at her before . There was fear in her glance , which darted on her and then dropped guiltily . Oh , Katharine had everything — beauty , mind , character . She could never compete with Katharine ; she could never be safe so long as Katharine brooded over her , dominating her , disposing of her . She called her cold , unseeing , unscrupulous , but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious one — she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history . At that moment the bell of the telephone rang and Katharine went to answer it . Cassandra , released from observation , dropped her book and clenched her hands . She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had suffered in the whole of her life ; she learnt more of her capacities for feeling . But when Katharine reappeared she was calm , and had gained a look of dignity that was new to her . “
171313	171317	171311	171311	him	2640	” she asked . “
171323	171327	171328	171328	I	0	” Katharine replied . “
171333	171334	171330	171331	Ralph Denham	154	” “
171351	171385	171344	171344	William	170	” The accusation that Katharine was calm , callous , and indifferent was not possible in face of her present air of animation . She gave Cassandra no time to frame an answer . “
171398	171535	171344	171344	William	170	” she asked . Cassandra made no reply for some moments . It was , indeed , a very difficult question to answer . In conversation the night before , William had indicated to Cassandra that , in his belief , Katharine was becoming engaged to Ralph Denham in the dining - room . Cassandra , in the rosy light of her own circumstances , had been disposed to think that the matter must be settled already . But a letter which she had received that morning from William , while ardent in its expression of affection , had conveyed to her obliquely that he would prefer the announcement of their engagement to coincide with that of Katharine ’s . This document Cassandra now produced , and read aloud , with considerable excisions and much hesitation . “
171619	171620	171623	171623	William	170	” “
171625	171647	171623	171623	William	170	” Katharine exclaimed , having gathered the drift of these remarks with a speed that , by itself , disconcerted Cassandra . “
171654	171658	171659	171659	I	0	” Cassandra replied . “
171689	171690	171686	171686	William	170	” “
171712	171781	171782	171782	I	0	” Cassandra was silent . The prospect appalled her . Katharine had been telephoning to Ralph Denham ; she looked queer , too ; she must be , or about to become , engaged to him . But if Cassandra could have overheard the conversation upon the telephone , she would not have felt so certain that it tended in that direction . It was to this effect : “
171796	171797	171788	171788	I	0	” “
171807	171808	171801	171801	you	154	” “
171823	171824	171818	171818	I	0	” “
171832	171833	171825	171825	I	0	” “
171838	171839	171834	171834	I	0	” “
171847	171848	171849	171849	I	0	” “
171855	171856	171849	171849	I	0	” “
171863	171881	171859	171859	We	2645	” A long pause followed . Ralph began a sentence , which he canceled with the word , “
171884	172026	171859	171859	We	2645	” Suddenly , together , at the same moment , they said good - bye . And yet , if the telephone had been miraculously connected with some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the savor of salt , Katharine could hardly have breathed in a keener sense of exhilaration . She ran downstairs on the crest of it . She was amazed to find herself already committed by William and Cassandra to marry the owner of the halting voice she had just heard on the telephone . The tendency of her spirit seemed to be in an altogether different direction ; and of a different nature . She had only to look at Cassandra to see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means . She considered for a moment , and then said : “
172063	172064	172046	172046	William	170	” “
172076	172080	172066	172066	he	170	” said Cassandra . “
172099	172129	172090	172091	Uncle Trevor	210	” This interpretation of what she was used to call William ’s conventionality was new to Katharine . And yet she felt it now to be the true one . “
172136	172140	172090	172091	Uncle Trevor	210	” she said . “
172182	172245	172160	172160	you	154	” Whether this applied also to the sentiments expressed in the letter , Katharine was not so sure ; but when William ’s solicitude was spent upon Cassandra it not only failed to irritate her , as it had done when she was the object of it , but appeared , as Cassandra said , the fruit of his love of beauty . “
172248	172252	172253	172253	he	170	” she said , “
172257	172258	172259	172259	I	0	” “
172269	172273	172259	172259	I	0	” said Cassandra . “
172278	172407	172276	172276	children	3537	” This remark made Katharine realize the depths of their intimacy better than any other words could have done ; she was jealous for one moment ; but the next she was humiliated . She had known William for years , and she had never once guessed that he loved children . She looked at the queer glow of exaltation in Cassandra ’s eyes , through which she was beholding the true spirit of a human being , and wished that she would go on talking about William for ever . Cassandra was not unwilling to gratify her . She talked on . The morning slipped away . Katharine scarcely changed her position on the edge of her father ’s writing - table , and Cassandra never opened the “
172412	172575	172276	172276	children	3537	” And yet it must be confessed that there were vast lapses in the attention which Katharine bestowed upon her cousin . The atmosphere was wonderfully congenial for thoughts of her own . She lost herself sometimes in such deep reverie that Cassandra , pausing , could look at her for moments unperceived . What could Katharine be thinking about , unless it were Ralph Denham ? She was satisfied , by certain random replies , that Katharine had wandered a little from the subject of William ’s perfections . But Katharine made no sign . She always ended these pauses by saying something so natural that Cassandra was deluded into giving fresh examples of her absorbing theme . Then they lunched , and the only sign that Katharine gave of abstraction was to forget to help the pudding . She looked so like her mother , as she sat there oblivious of the tapioca , that Cassandra was startled into exclaiming : “
172583	172584	172578	172579	Aunt Maggie	233	” “
172587	173119	172578	172579	Aunt Maggie	233	” said Katharine , with more irritation than the remark seemed to call for . In truth , now that her mother was away , Katharine did feel less sensible than usual , but as she argued it to herself , there was much less need for sense . Secretly , she was a little shaken by the evidence which the morning had supplied of her immense capacity for — what could one call it?—rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were too foolish to be named . She was , for example , walking down a road in Northumberland in the August sunset ; at the inn she left her companion , who was Ralph Denham , and was transported , not so much by her own feet as by some invisible means , to the top of a high hill . Here the scents , the sounds among the dry heather - roots , the grass - blades pressed upon the palm of her hand , were all so perceptible that she could experience each one separately . After this her mind made excursions into the dark of the air , or settled upon the surface of the sea , which could be discovered over there , or with equal unreason it returned to its couch of bracken beneath the stars of midnight , and visited the snow valleys of the moon . These fancies would have been in no way strange , since the walls of every mind are decorated with some such tracery , but she found herself suddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardor , which became a desire to change her actual condition for something matching the conditions of her dream . Then she started ; then she awoke to the fact that Cassandra was looking at her in amazement . Cassandra would have liked to feel certain that , when Katharine made no reply at all or one wide of the mark , she was making up her mind to get married at once , but it was difficult , if this were so , to account for some remarks that Katharine let fall about the future . She recurred several times to the summer , as if she meant to spend that season in solitary wandering . She seemed to have a plan in her mind which required Bradshaws and the names of inns . Cassandra was driven finally , by her own unrest , to put on her clothes and wander out along the streets of Chelsea , on the pretence that she must buy something . But , in her ignorance of the way , she became panic - stricken at the thought of being late , and no sooner had she found the shop she wanted , than she fled back again in order to be at home when William came . He came , indeed , five minutes after she had sat down by the tea - table , and she had the happiness of receiving him alone . His greeting put her doubts of his affection at rest , but the first question he asked was : “
173126	173127	173121	173121	Katharine	129	” “
173152	173160	173138	173138	She	129	” William frowned , and looked annoyed . “
173179	173188	173172	173172	She	129	” Cassandra added by way of cheering him . “
173221	173310	173213	173213	she	129	” He left his sentence unfinished , for at this point Katharine herself appeared . With his recollections of the scene the night before , he was too self - conscious even to look at her , and it was not until she told him of her mother ’s visit to Stratford - on - Avon that he raised his eyes . It was clear that he was greatly relieved . He looked round him now , as if he felt at his ease , and Cassandra exclaimed : “
173320	173321	173322	173322	You	2657	” “
173328	173332	173322	173322	You	2657	” he asked . “
173340	173344	173313	173313	you	2657	” said Katharine . “
173351	173525	173313	173313	you	2657	” But as she said this , with a decision which seemed to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged , she held out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea . Being told of her forgetfulness , she frowned with annoyance , and said that Cassandra was demoralizing her . The glance she cast upon them , and the resolute way in which she plunged them into speech , made William and Cassandra feel like children who had been caught prying . They followed her obediently , making conversation . Any one coming in might have judged them acquaintances met , perhaps , for the third time . If that were so , one must have concluded that the hostess suddenly bethought her of an engagement pressing for fulfilment . First Katharine looked at her watch , and then she asked William to tell her the right time . When told that it was ten minutes to five she rose at once , and said : “
173534	173555	173527	173527	I	0	” She left the room , holding her unfinished bread and butter in her hand . William glanced at Cassandra . “
173562	173608	173558	173558	she	2658	” Cassandra exclaimed . William looked perturbed . He knew more of Katharine than Cassandra did , but even he could not tell—. In a second Katharine was back again dressed in outdoor things , still holding her bread and butter in her bare hand . “
173620	173624	173625	173625	I	0	” she said . “
173630	173639	173641	173641	she	2658	” and so saying , she left them . “
173645	173654	173641	173641	she	2658	” William exclaimed , as the door shut , “
173667	173690	173641	173641	she	2658	” They ran to the window , and saw her walking rapidly along the street towards the City . Then she vanished . “
173700	173704	173691	173691	She	2658	” Cassandra exclaimed . “
173708	173734	173691	173691	She	2658	” William interjected . The incident impressed them both as having something queer and ominous about it out of all proportion to its surface strangeness . “
173745	173770	173741	173742	Aunt Maggie	233	” said Cassandra , as if in explanation . William shook his head , and paced up and down the room looking extremely perturbed . “
173779	173784	173774	173774	I	0	” he burst out . “
173821	173822	173814	173814	I	0	” “
173835	173839	173833	173833	William	170	” Cassandra implored . “
173894	173916	173887	173887	they	2665	” Cassandra was equally stricken by the sight of William ’s agitation , and appalled by the prospect of his desertion . “
173921	173938	173887	173887	they	2665	” she exclaimed wildly , glancing at the curtain which separated the room with the relics . “
173948	174135	173939	173939	I	0	” said William sarcastically . She saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of the situation . Her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection , at this moment , would be extremely ill - judged . She controlled herself , sat down , poured out a fresh cup of tea , and sipped it quietly . This natural action , arguing complete self - mastery , and showing her in one of those feminine attitudes which William found adorable , did more than any argument to compose his agitation . It appealed to his chivalry . He accepted a cup . Next she asked for a slice of cake . By the time the cake was eaten and the tea drunk the personal question had lapsed , and they were discussing poetry . Insensibly they turned from the question of dramatic poetry in general , to the particular example which reposed in William ’s pocket , and when the maid came in to clear away the tea - things , William had asked permission to read a short passage aloud , “
174141	175222	174139	174139	her	2666	” Cassandra bent her head in silence , but she showed a little of what she felt in her eyes , and thus fortified , William felt confident that it would take more than Mrs. Milvain herself to rout him from his position . He read aloud . Meanwhile Katharine walked rapidly along the street . If called upon to explain her impulsive action in leaving the tea - table , she could have traced it to no better cause than that William had glanced at Cassandra ; Cassandra at William . Yet , because they had glanced , her position was impossible . If one forgot to pour out a cup of tea they rushed to the conclusion that she was engaged to Ralph Denham . She knew that in half an hour or so the door would open , and Ralph Denham would appear . She could not sit there and contemplate seeing him with William ’s and Cassandra ’s eyes upon them , judging their exact degree of intimacy , so that they might fix the wedding - day . She promptly decided that she would meet Ralph out of doors ; she still had time to reach Lincoln ’s Inn Fields before he left his office . She hailed a cab , and bade it take her to a shop for selling maps which she remembered in Great Queen Street , since she hardly liked to be set down at his door . Arrived at the shop , she bought a large scale map of Norfolk , and thus provided , hurried into Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , and assured herself of the position of Messrs. Hoper and Grateley ’s office . The great gas chandeliers were alight in the office windows . She conceived that he sat at an enormous table laden with papers beneath one of them in the front room with the three tall windows . Having settled his position there , she began walking to and fro upon the pavement . Nobody of his build appeared . She scrutinized each male figure as it approached and passed her . Each male figure had , nevertheless , a look of him , due , perhaps , to the professional dress , the quick step , the keen glance which they cast upon her as they hastened home after the day ’s work . The square itself , with its immense houses all so fully occupied and stern of aspect , its atmosphere of industry and power , as if even the sparrows and the children were earning their daily bread , as if the sky itself , with its gray and scarlet clouds , reflected the serious intention of the city beneath it , spoke of him . Here was the fit place for their meeting , she thought ; here was the fit place for her to walk thinking of him . She could not help comparing it with the domestic streets of Chelsea . With this comparison in her mind , she extended her range a little , and turned into the main road . The great torrent of vans and carts was sweeping down Kingsway ; pedestrians were streaming in two currents along the pavements . She stood fascinated at the corner . The deep roar filled her ears ; the changing tumult had the inexpressible fascination of varied life pouring ceaselessly with a purpose which , as she looked , seemed to her , somehow , the normal purpose for which life was framed ; its complete indifference to the individuals , whom it swallowed up and rolled onwards , filled her with at least a temporary exaltation . The blend of daylight and of lamplight made her an invisible spectator , just as it gave the people who passed her a semi - transparent quality , and left the faces pale ivory ovals in which the eyes alone were dark . They tended the enormous rush of the current — the great flow , the deep stream , the unquenchable tide . She stood unobserved and absorbed , glorying openly in the rapture that had run subterraneously all day . Suddenly she was clutched , unwilling , from the outside , by the recollection of her purpose in coming there . She had come to find Ralph Denham . She hastily turned back into Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , and looked for her landmark — the light in the three tall windows . She sought in vain . The faces of the houses had now merged in the general darkness , and she had difficulty in determining which she sought . Ralph ’s three windows gave back on their ghostly glass panels only a reflection of the gray and greenish sky . She rang the bell , peremptorily , under the painted name of the firm . After some delay she was answered by a caretaker , whose pail and brush of themselves told her that the working day was over and the workers gone . Nobody , save perhaps Mr. Grateley himself , was left , she assured Katharine ; every one else had been gone these ten minutes . The news woke Katharine completely . Anxiety gained upon her . She hastened back into Kingsway , looking at people who had miraculously regained their solidity . She ran as far as the Tube station , overhauling clerk after clerk , solicitor after solicitor . Not one of them even faintly resembled Ralph Denham . More and more plainly did she see him ; and more and more did he seem to her unlike any one else . At the door of the station she paused , and tried to collect her thoughts . He had gone to her house . By taking a cab she could be there probably in advance of him . But she pictured herself opening the drawing - room door , and William and Cassandra looking up , and Ralph ’s entrance a moment later , and the glances — the insinuations . No ; she could not face it . She would write him a letter and take it at once to his house . She bought paper and pencil at the bookstall , and entered an A.B.C. shop , where , by ordering a cup of coffee , she secured an empty table , and began at vice to write : “
175246	175251	175252	175252	They	2668	” here she paused . “
175259	175263	175252	175252	They	2668	” she substituted , “
175279	175340	175276	175276	I	0	” Her wants were so vast , now that she was in communication with Ralph , that the pencil was utterly inadequate to conduct them on to the paper ; it seemed as if the whole torrent of Kingsway had to run down her pencil . She gazed intently at a notice hanging on the gold - encrusted wall opposite , “
175349	176302	175276	175276	I	0	” she added , writing each word with the painstaking of a child . But , when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence , she was aware of a waitress , whose expression intimated that it was closing time , and , looking round , Katharine saw herself almost the last person left in the shop . She took up her letter , paid her bill , and found herself once more in the street . She would now take a cab to Highgate . But at that moment it flashed upon her that she could not remember the address . This check seemed to let fall a barrier across a very powerful current of desire . She ransacked her memory in desperation , hunting for the name , first by remembering the look of the house , and then by trying , in memory , to retrace the words she had written once , at least , upon an envelope . The more she pressed the farther the words receded . Was the house an Orchard Something , on the street a Hill ? She gave it up . Never , since she was a child , had she felt anything like this blankness and desolation . There rushed in upon her , as if she were waking from some dream , all the consequences of her inexplicable indolence . She figured Ralph ’s face as he turned from her door without a word of explanation , receiving his dismissal as a blow from herself , a callous intimation that she did not wish to see him . She followed his departure from her door ; but it was far more easy to see him marching far and fast in any direction for any length of time than to conceive that he would turn back to Highgate . Perhaps he would try once more to see her in Cheyne Walk ? It was proof of the clearness with which she saw him , that she started forward as this possibility occurred to her , and almost raised her hand to beckon to a cab . No ; he was too proud to come again ; he rejected the desire and walked on and on , on and on — If only she could read the names of those visionary streets down which he passed ! But her imagination betrayed her at this point , or mocked her with a sense of their strangeness , darkness , and distance . Indeed , instead of helping herself to any decision , she only filled her mind with the vast extent of London and the impossibility of finding any single figure that wandered off this way and that way , turned to the right and to the left , chose that dingy little back street where the children were playing in the road , and so — She roused herself impatiently . She walked rapidly along Holborn . Soon she turned and walked as rapidly in the other direction . This indecision was not merely odious , but had something that alarmed her about it , as she had been alarmed slightly once or twice already that day ; she felt unable to cope with the strength of her own desires . To a person controlled by habit , there was humiliation as well as alarm in this sudden release of what appeared to be a very powerful as well as an unreasonable force . An aching in the muscles of her right hand now showed her that she was crushing her gloves and the map of Norfolk in a grip sufficient to crack a more solid object . She relaxed her grasp ; she looked anxiously at the faces of the passers - by to see whether their eyes rested on her for a moment longer than was natural , or with any curiosity . But having smoothed out her gloves , and done what she could to look as usual , she forgot spectators , and was once more given up to her desperate desire to find Ralph Denham . It was a desire now — wild , irrational , unexplained , resembling something felt in childhood . Once more she blamed herself bitterly for her carelessness . But finding herself opposite the Tube station , she pulled herself up and took counsel swiftly , as of old . It flashed upon her that she would go at once to Mary Datchet , and ask her to give her Ralph ’s address . The decision was a relief , not only in giving her a goal , but in providing her with a rational excuse for her own actions . It gave her a goal certainly , but the fact of having a goal led her to dwell exclusively upon her obsession ; so that when she rang the bell of Mary ’s flat , she did not for a moment consider how this demand would strike Mary . To her extreme annoyance Mary was not at home ; a charwoman opened the door . All Katharine could do was to accept the invitation to wait . She waited for , perhaps , fifteen minutes , and spent them in pacing from one end of the room to the other without intermission . When she heard Mary ’s key in the door she paused in front of the fireplace , and Mary found her standing upright , looking at once expectant and determined , like a person who has come on an errand of such importance that it must be broached without preface . Mary exclaimed in surprise . “
176307	176324	175276	175276	I	0	” Katharine said , brushing these remarks aside , as if they were in the way . “
176330	176331	176326	176326	you	2670	” “
176335	176384	176326	176326	you	2670	” she said , thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years ago , somewhere or other . Mary paused , took off her gloves , and , finding matches , proceeded to light the fire . Katharine checked her with an impatient movement , and said : “
176402	176423	176397	176398	Ralph Denham	154	” She was holding a pencil and preparing to write on the envelope . She waited with an imperious expression . “
176434	176444	176397	176398	Ralph Denham	154	” Mary said , speaking slowly and rather strangely . “
176451	176462	176397	176398	Ralph Denham	154	” Katharine exclaimed , with irritation at her own stupidity . “
176475	176489	176463	176463	I	0	” She gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go . “
176497	176525	176491	176491	you	0	” said Mary , pausing with a match in her hand . Katharine , who had already turned towards the door , stopped and looked at her . “
176532	176536	176537	176537	He	154	” she asked . “
176545	176546	176537	176537	He	154	” “
176554	176558	176548	176548	he	154	” she replied . “
176607	176617	176597	176597	I	0	” Mary took in the situation at her leisure . “
176623	176644	176597	176597	I	0	” she said . Katharine immediately dropped all that she was holding ; her strained expression relaxed , and exclaiming , “
176656	176734	176651	176651	I	0	” she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number . Mary looked at her steadily , and then left the room . At length Katharine heard , through all the superimposed weight of London , the mysterious sound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room , where she could almost see the pictures and the books ; she listened with extreme intentness to the preparatory vibrations , and then established her identity . “
176740	176741	176744	176744	miss	2525	” “
176746	176747	176744	176744	miss	2525	” “
176754	176755	176749	176749	he	131	” “
176766	176767	176758	176758	We	2677	” “
176774	176775	176769	176769	he	131	” “
176789	176828	176829	176829	Mary	175	” Katharine hung up the receiver . She walked the length of the room in such acute disappointment that she did not at first perceive Mary ’s absence . Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone : “
176831	176849	176829	176829	Mary	175	” Mary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom . She heard Katharine call her . “
176852	176856	176829	176829	Mary	175	” she said , “
176864	177010	176857	176857	I	0	” But the moment prolonged itself , as if for some reason Mary found satisfaction in making herself not only tidy , but seemly and ornamented . A stage in her life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces for ever upon her bearing . Youth , and the bloom of youth , had receded , leaving the purpose of her face to show itself in the hollower cheeks , the firmer lips , the eyes no longer spontaneously observing at random , but narrowed upon an end which was not near at hand . This woman was now a serviceable human being , mistress of her own destiny , and thus , by some combination of ideas , fit to be adorned with the dignity of silver chains and glowing brooches . She came in at her leisure and asked : “
177019	177020	177014	177014	you	0	” “
177027	177031	177021	177021	He	2680	” Katharine replied . “
177041	177070	177071	177071	I	0	” said Mary . Katharine was once more irresistibly drawn to gaze upon an imaginary map of London , to follow the twists and turns of unnamed streets . “
177084	177101	177071	177071	I	0	” Mary crossed to the telephone and , after a series of brief remarks , announced : “
177114	177115	177104	177105	His sister	578	” “
177118	177129	177104	177105	His sister	578	” She applied her ear to the telephone once more . “
177144	177145	177136	177136	He	2680	” “
177154	177212	177213	177213	I	0	” Very pale , and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon Mary as upon vistas of unresponding blankness , Katharine addressed herself also not so much to Mary as to the unrelenting spirit which now appeared to mock her from every quarter of her survey . After waiting a little time Mary remarked indifferently : “
177219	177260	177213	177213	I	0	” Slackly lying back in her armchair , she watched the little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently , as if they , too , were very distant and indifferent . Katharine looked at her indignantly and rose . “
177267	177280	177213	177213	I	0	” Mary continued , without altering the abstract tone of her voice . “
177299	177324	177325	177325	I	0	” She bent forward and touched the wood , so that the flames slipped in between the interstices of the coal . Katharine reflected . “
177332	177473	177325	177325	I	0	” she said . Mary rose , went to the table , spread out her papers under the green - shaded lamp and , with an action that was becoming a habit , twisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers . Once she looked unperceived at her visitor , who never moved , who sat so still , with eyes so intent , that you could almost fancy that she was watching something , some face that never looked up at her . Mary found herself unable to go on writing . She turned her eyes away , but only to be aware of the presence of what Katharine looked at . There were ghosts in the room , and one , strangely and sadly , was the ghost of herself . The minutes went by . “
177481	177496	177497	177497	I	0	” said Katharine at last . The half - hour was not quite spent . “
177505	177514	177497	177497	I	0	” said Mary , rising from her table . “
177520	177524	177516	177516	I	0	” said Katharine . “
177536	177550	177533	177533	you	0	” Katharine looked round the room , conveying her uncertainty in her glance . “
177557	177561	177552	177552	I	0	” she mused . “
177575	177587	177568	177568	You	0	” Mary spoke , and intended to speak , cruelly enough . “
177595	177609	177588	177588	I	0	” Katharine replied . Their eyes met with antagonism , and neither flinched . “
177619	177658	177610	177610	You	0	” Mary answered . A loud knocking at the door interrupted them . Mary went to open it , and returning with some note or parcel , Katharine looked away so that Mary might not read her disappointment . “
177668	177679	177661	177661	you	0	” Mary repeated , laying the note upon the table . “
177682	177686	177661	177661	you	0	” said Katharine . “
177735	177751	177752	177752	You	0	” She spoke with a self - abandonment that Mary had never seen in her . “
177762	177767	177757	177757	you	0	” she said roughly . “
177779	177780	177774	177774	I	0	” “
177788	177793	177781	177781	You	0	” Mary interrupted her . “
177801	177802	177781	177781	You	0	” “
177807	177811	177781	177781	You	0	” Katharine exclaimed . “
177817	177894	177895	177895	You	2689	” Her look , passing beyond Mary , beyond the verge of the room and out beyond any words that came her way , wildly and passionately , convinced Mary that she , at any rate , could not follow such a glance to its end . She was baffled ; she tried to think herself back again into the height of her love for Ralph . Pressing her fingers upon her eyelids , she murmured : “
177914	178067	177912	177912	him	2690	” And yet , what had she known ? She could not remember it any more . She pressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her darkness . She convinced herself that she was stirring among ashes . She desisted . She was astonished at her discovery . She did not love Ralph any more . She looked back dazed into the room , and her eyes rested upon the table with its lamp - lit papers . The steady radiance seemed for a second to have its counterpart within her ; she shut her eyes ; she opened them and looked at the lamp again ; another love burnt in the place of the old one , or so , in a momentary glance of amazement , she guessed before the revelation was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves . She leant in silence against the mantelpiece . “
178075	178105	177912	177912	him	2690	” she murmured , half to herself , at length . Katharine made no reply and seemed unaware of her words . She seemed absorbed in her own thoughts . “
178118	178122	178107	178107	he	2691	” she exclaimed . “
178133	178134	178128	178128	I	0	” “
178146	178161	178141	178141	he	2691	” said Mary , and Katharine , after considering for a moment , said : “
178170	178510	178162	178162	I	0	” She sank down into her chair again , and took up the same position which Mary had compared to the position of one watching an unseeing face . She watched , indeed , not a face , but a procession , not of people , but of life itself : the good and bad ; the meaning ; the past , the present , and the future . All this seemed apparent to her , and she was not ashamed of her extravagance so much as exalted to one of the pinnacles of existence , where it behoved the world to do her homage . No one but she herself knew what it meant to miss Ralph Denham on that particular night ; into this inadequate event crowded feelings that the great crises of life might have failed to call forth . She had missed him , and knew the bitterness of all failure ; she desired him , and knew the torment of all passion . It did not matter what trivial accidents led to this culmination . Nor did she care how extravagant she appeared , nor how openly she showed her feelings . When the dinner was ready Mary told her to come , and she came submissively , as if she let Mary direct her movements for her . They ate and drank together almost in silence , and when Mary told her to eat more , she ate more ; when she was told to drink wine , she drank it . Nevertheless , beneath this superficial obedience , Mary knew that she was following her own thoughts unhindered . She was not inattentive so much as remote ; she looked at once so unseeing and so intent upon some vision of her own that Mary gradually felt more than protective — she became actually alarmed at the prospect of some collision between Katharine and the forces of the outside world . Directly they had done , Katharine announced her intention of going . “
178518	178528	178514	178514	you	2693	” Mary asked , desiring vaguely to hinder her . “
178542	178897	178514	178514	you	2693	” Mary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her . All she could do was to insist upon coming too , but she met with no opposition ; Katharine seemed indifferent to her presence . In a few minutes they were walking along the Strand . They walked so rapidly that Mary was deluded into the belief that Katharine knew where she was going . She herself was not attentive . She was glad of the movement along lamp - lit streets in the open air . She was fingering , painfully and with fear , yet with strange hope , too , the discovery which she had stumbled upon unexpectedly that night . She was free once more at the cost of a gift , the best , perhaps , that she could offer , but she was , thank Heaven , in love no longer . She was tempted to spend the first instalment of her freedom in some dissipation ; in the pit of the Coliseum , for example , since they were now passing the door . Why not go in and celebrate her independence of the tyranny of love ? Or , perhaps , the top of an omnibus bound for some remote place such as Camberwell , or Sidcup , or the Welsh Harp would suit her better . She noticed these names painted on little boards for the first time for weeks . Or should she return to her room , and spend the night working out the details of a very enlightened and ingenious scheme ? Of all possibilities this appealed to her most , and brought to mind the fire , the lamplight , the steady glow which had seemed lit in the place where a more passionate flame had once burnt . Now Katharine stopped , and Mary woke to the fact that instead of having a goal she had evidently none . She paused at the edge of the crossing , and looked this way and that , and finally made as if in the direction of Haverstock Hill . “
178906	178916	178917	178917	We	2696	” Mary cried , catching her by the hand . “
178926	178954	178917	178917	We	2696	” She hailed a cab and insisted that Katharine should get in , while she directed the driver to take them to Cheyne Walk . Katharine submitted . “
178958	178962	178917	178917	We	2696	” she said . “
178973	179015	179016	179016	I	0	” A gloom seemed to have fallen on her . She lay back in her corner , silent and apparently exhausted . Mary , in spite of her own preoccupation , was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection . “
179024	179035	179016	179016	I	0	” she said more gently than she had yet spoken . “
179042	179061	179016	179016	I	0	” Katharine replied . Without understanding her , Mary began to pity her for what she was suffering . “
179064	179075	179016	179016	I	0	” she said , taking her hand and rubbing it . “
179090	179091	179086	179086	him	2700	” “
179106	179117	179094	179094	he	2700	” She leant forward and looked out of the window . “
179128	179190	179118	179118	He	2700	” she said in a low voice , almost to herself . The exaggeration was so immense that Mary did not attempt to cope with it , save by keeping hold of Katharine ’s wrist . She half expected that Katharine might open the door suddenly and jump out . Perhaps Katharine perceived the purpose with which her hand was held . “
179196	179205	179206	179206	I	0	” she said , with a little laugh . “
179226	179236	179237	179237	I	0	” Upon this , Mary ostentatiously withdrew her hand . “
179243	179251	179237	179237	I	0	” Katharine continued , with an effort , “
179373	179397	179337	179337	William	176	” She sprang forward to catch sight of a clock , as if the exact time had some important bearing on her case . “
179404	179408	179337	179337	William	176	” she exclaimed . “
179416	179431	179410	179410	he	176	” She leant out of the window and told the cabman to drive faster . “
179456	179457	179458	179458	We	2706	” “
179463	179842	179458	179458	We	2706	” Mary repeated . Mary had no doubt but that somehow or other they would find him . But suppose they did find him ? She began to think of Ralph with a sort of strangeness , in her effort to understand how he could be capable of satisfying this extraordinary desire . Once more she thought herself back to her old view of him and could , with an effort , recall the haze which surrounded his figure , and the sense of confused , heightened exhilaration which lay all about his neighborhood , so that for months at a time she had never exactly heard his voice or seen his face — or so it now seemed to her . The pain of her loss shot through her . Nothing would ever make up — not success , or happiness , or oblivion . But this pang was immediately followed by the assurance that now , at any rate , she knew the truth ; and Katharine , she thought , stealing a look at her , did not know the truth ; yes , Katharine was immensely to be pitied . The cab , which had been caught in the traffic , was now liberated and sped on down Sloane Street . Mary was conscious of the tension with which Katharine marked its progress , as if her mind were fixed upon a point in front of them , and marked , second by second , their approach to it . She said nothing , and in silence Mary began to fix her mind , in sympathy at first , and later in forgetfulness of her companion , upon a point in front of them . She imagined a point distant as a low star upon the horizon of the dark . There for her too , for them both , was the goal for which they were striving , and the end for the ardors of their spirits was the same : but where it was , or what it was , or why she felt convinced that they were united in search of it , as they drove swiftly down the streets of London side by side , she could not have said . “
179846	179909	179910	179911	Mr. Denham	131	” Katharine breathed , as the cab drew up at the door . She jumped out and scanned the pavement on either side . Mary , meanwhile , rang the bell . The door opened as Katharine assured herself that no one of the people within view had any likeness to Ralph . On seeing her , the maid said at once : “
179927	180444	179917	179917	He	131	” Katharine vanished from Mary ’s sight . The door shut between them , and Mary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone . Katharine turned at once to the dining - room . But with her fingers upon the handle , she held back . Perhaps she realized that this was a moment which would never come again . Perhaps , for a second , it seemed to her that no reality could equal the imagination she had formed . Perhaps she was restrained by some vague fear or anticipation , which made her dread any exchange or interruption . But if these doubts and fears or this supreme bliss restrained her , it was only for a moment . In another second she had turned the handle and , biting her lip to control herself , she opened the door upon Ralph Denham . An extraordinary clearness of sight seemed to possess her on beholding him . So little , so single , so separate from all else he appeared , who had been the cause of these extreme agitations and aspirations . She could have laughed in his face . But , gaining upon this clearness of sight against her will , and to her dislike , was a flood of confusion , of relief , of certainty , of humility , of desire no longer to strive and to discriminate , yielding to which , she let herself sink within his arms and confessed her love . Nobody asked Katharine any questions next day . If cross - examined she might have said that nobody spoke to her . She worked a little , wrote a little , ordered the dinner , and sat , for longer than she knew , with her head on her hand piercing whatever lay before her , whether it was a letter or a dictionary , as if it were a film upon the deep prospects that revealed themselves to her kindling and brooding eyes . She rose once , and going to the bookcase , took out her father ’s Greek dictionary and spread the sacred pages of symbols and figures before her . She smoothed the sheets with a mixture of affectionate amusement and hope . Would other eyes look on them with her one day ? The thought , long intolerable , was now just bearable . She was quite unaware of the anxiety with which her movements were watched and her expression scanned . Cassandra was careful not to be caught looking at her , and their conversation was so prosaic that were it not for certain jolts and jerks between the sentences , as if the mind were kept with difficulty to the rails , Mrs. Milvain herself could have detected nothing of a suspicious nature in what she overheard . William , when he came in late that afternoon and found Cassandra alone , had a very serious piece of news to impart . He had just passed Katharine in the street and she had failed to recognize him . “
180481	180482	180480	180480	she	2713	looked”—he hesitated—“like
180490	180534	180480	180480	she	2713	” To Cassandra the significant thing was that Katharine had gone out without telling her , and she interpreted this to mean that she had gone out to meet Ralph Denham . But to her surprise William drew no comfort from this probability . “
180540	180544	180480	180480	she	2713	” he began , “
180555	180886	180550	180550	people	383	” and the fact that you are going to meet a young man is no longer proof of anything , except , indeed , that people will talk . Cassandra saw , not without a pang of jealousy , that he was extremely solicitous that people should not talk about Katharine , as if his interest in her were still proprietary rather than friendly . As they were both ignorant of Ralph ’s visit the night before they had not that reason to comfort themselves with the thought that matters were hastening to a crisis . These absences of Katharine ’s , moreover , left them exposed to interruptions which almost destroyed their pleasure in being alone together . The rainy evening made it impossible to go out ; and , indeed , according to William ’s code , it was considerably more damning to be seen out of doors than surprised within . They were so much at the mercy of bells and doors that they could hardly talk of Macaulay with any conviction , and William preferred to defer the second act of his tragedy until another day . Under these circumstances Cassandra showed herself at her best . She sympathized with William ’s anxieties and did her utmost to share them ; but still , to be alone together , to be running risks together , to be partners in the wonderful conspiracy , was to her so enthralling that she was always forgetting discretion , breaking out into exclamations and admirations which finally made William believe that , although deplorable and upsetting , the situation was not without its sweetness . When the door did open , he started , but braved the forthcoming revelation . It was not Mrs. Milvain , however , but Katharine herself who entered , closely followed by Ralph Denham . With a set expression which showed what an effort she was making , Katharine encountered their eyes , and saying , “
180895	181074	180887	180887	We	2716	” she led Denham behind the curtain which hung in front of the room with the relics . This refuge was none of her willing , but confronted with wet pavements and only some belated museum or Tube station for shelter , she was forced , for Ralph ’s sake , to face the discomforts of her own house . Under the street lamps she had thought him looking both tired and strained . Thus separated , the two couples remained occupied for some time with their own affairs . Only the lowest murmurs penetrated from one section of the room to the other . At length the maid came in to bring a message that Mr. Hilbery would not be home for dinner . It was true that there was no need that Katharine should be informed , but William began to inquire Cassandra ’s opinion in such a way as to show that , with or without reason , he wished very much to speak to her . From motives of her own Cassandra dissuaded him . “
181086	181090	181078	181078	you	2718	” he hazarded . “
181112	181130	181108	181108	Ralph	154	” The coupling of their names in this manner caused Cassandra ’s heart to leap with pleasure . “
181140	181151	181133	181133	you	2719	” she began , but William hastily took her up . “
181174	181780	181781	181781	God	355	” He proceeded on his embassy with a mixture of excitement and embarrassment which caused him to turn aside with his hand on the curtain , and to examine intently for several moments the portrait of a lady , optimistically said by Mrs. Hilbery to be an early work of Sir Joshua Reynolds . Then , with some unnecessary fumbling , he drew aside the curtain , and with his eyes fixed upon the ground , repeated his message and suggested that they should all spend the evening at the play . Katharine accepted the suggestion with such cordiality that it was strange to find her of no clear mind as to the precise spectacle she wished to see . She left the choice entirely to Ralph and William , who , taking counsel fraternally over an evening paper , found themselves in agreement as to the merits of a music - hall . This being arranged , everything else followed easily and enthusiastically . Cassandra had never been to a music - hall . Katharine instructed her in the peculiar delights of an entertainment where Polar bears follow directly upon ladies in full evening dress , and the stage is alternately a garden of mystery , a milliner ’s band - box , and a fried - fish shop in the Mile End Road . Whatever the exact nature of the program that night , it fulfilled the highest purposes of dramatic art , so far , at least , as four of the audience were concerned . No doubt the actors and the authors would have been surprised to learn in what shape their efforts reached those particular eyes and ears ; but they could not have denied that the effect as a whole was tremendous . The hall resounded with brass and strings , alternately of enormous pomp and majesty , and then of sweetest lamentation . The reds and creams of the background , the lyres and harps and urns and skulls , the protuberances of plaster , the fringes of scarlet plush , the sinking and blazing of innumerable electric lights , could scarcely have been surpassed for decorative effect by any craftsman of the ancient or modern world . Then there was the audience itself , bare - shouldered , tufted and garlanded in the stalls , decorous but festal in the balconies , and frankly fit for daylight and street life in the galleries . But , however they differed when looked at separately , they shared the same huge , lovable nature in the bulk , which murmured and swayed and quivered all the time the dancing and juggling and love - making went on in front of it , slowly laughed and reluctantly left off laughing , and applauded with a helter - skelter generosity which sometimes became unanimous and overwhelming . Once William saw Katharine leaning forward and clapping her hands with an abandonment that startled him . Her laugh rang out with the laughter of the audience . For a second he was puzzled , as if this laughter disclosed something that he had never suspected in her . But then Cassandra ’s face caught his eye , gazing with astonishment at the buffoon , not laughing , too deeply intent and surprised to laugh at what she saw , and for some moments he watched her as if she were a child . The performance came to an end , the illusion dying out first here and then there , as some rose to put on their coats , others stood upright to salute “
181786	182234	181781	181781	God	355	” the musicians folded their music and encased their instruments , and the lights sank one by one until the house was empty , silent , and full of great shadows . Looking back over her shoulder as she followed Ralph through the swing doors , Cassandra marveled to see how the stage was already entirely without romance . But , she wondered , did they really cover all the seats in brown holland every night ? The success of this entertainment was such that before they separated another expedition had been planned for the next day . The next day was Saturday ; therefore both William and Ralph were free to devote the whole afternoon to an expedition to Greenwich , which Cassandra had never seen , and Katharine confused with Dulwich . On this occasion Ralph was their guide . He brought them without accident to Greenwich . What exigencies of state or fantasies of imagination first gave birth to the cluster of pleasant places by which London is surrounded is matter of indifference now that they have adapted themselves so admirably to the needs of people between the ages of twenty and thirty with Saturday afternoons to spend . Indeed , if ghosts have any interest in the affections of those who succeed them they must reap their richest harvests when the fine weather comes again and the lovers , the sightseers , and the holiday - makers pour themselves out of trains and omnibuses into their old pleasure - grounds . It is true that they go , for the most part , unthanked by name , although upon this occasion William was ready to give such discriminating praise as the dead architects and painters received seldom in the course of the year . They were walking by the river bank , and Katharine and Ralph , lagging a little behind , caught fragments of his lecture . Katharine smiled at the sound of his voice ; she listened as if she found it a little unfamiliar , intimately though she knew it ; she tested it . The note of assurance and happiness was new . William was very happy . She learnt every hour what sources of his happiness she had neglected . She had never asked him to teach her anything ; she had never consented to read Macaulay ; she had never expressed her belief that his play was second only to the works of Shakespeare . She followed dreamily in their wake , smiling and delighting in the sound which conveyed , she knew , the rapturous and yet not servile assent of Cassandra . Then she murmured , “
182239	182256	181781	181781	God	355	” but changed her sentence to the opposite of what she meant to say and ended , “
182266	182459	182460	182460	She	2724	” But it was unnecessary to follow out such riddles when the presence of Ralph supplied her with more interesting problems , which somehow became involved with the little boat crossing the river , the majestic and careworn City , and the steamers homecoming with their treasury , or starting in search of it , so that infinite leisure would be necessary for the proper disentanglement of one from the other . He stopped , moreover , and began inquiring of an old boatman as to the tides and the ships . In thus talking he seemed different , and even looked different , she thought , against the river , with the steeples and towers for background . His strangeness , his romance , his power to leave her side and take part in the affairs of men , the possibility that they should together hire a boat and cross the river , the speed and wildness of this enterprise filled her mind and inspired her with such rapture , half of love and half of adventure , that William and Cassandra were startled from their talk , and Cassandra exclaimed , “
182474	182689	182464	182464	she	2724	” she added quickly , though she repressed , in deference to William , her own wonder that the sight of Ralph Denham talking to a boatman on the banks of the Thames could move any one to such an attitude of adoration . That afternoon , what with tea and the curiosities of the Thames tunnel and the unfamiliarity of the streets , passed so quickly that the only method of prolonging it was to plan another expedition for the following day . Hampton Court was decided upon , in preference to Hampstead , for though Cassandra had dreamt as a child of the brigands of Hampstead , she had now transferred her affections completely and for ever to William III . Accordingly , they arrived at Hampton Court about lunch - time on a fine Sunday morning . Such unity marked their expressions of admiration for the red - brick building that they might have come there for no other purpose than to assure each other that this palace was the stateliest palace in the world . They walked up and down the Terrace , four abreast , and fancied themselves the owners of the place , and calculated the amount of good to the world produced indubitably by such a tenancy . “
182696	182700	182464	182464	she	2724	” said Katharine , “
182721	182722	182464	182464	she	2724	” “
182725	182872	182464	182464	she	2724	” Cassandra began , but checked herself from the liberty of envisaging Katharine as the widow of a distinguished lawyer . Upon this , the third day of junketing , it was tiresome to have to restrain oneself even from such innocent excursions of fancy . She dared not question William ; he was inscrutable ; he never seemed even to follow the other couple with curiosity when they separated , as they frequently did , to name a plant , or examine a fresco . Cassandra was constantly studying their backs . She noticed how sometimes the impulse to move came from Katharine , and sometimes from Ralph ; how , sometimes , they walked slow , as if in profound intercourse , and sometimes fast , as if in passionate . When they came together again nothing could be more unconcerned than their manner . “
182884	182887	182888	182888	We	2729	” or , “
182897	183478	183479	183479	Katharine	129	” Then , to puzzle her further , William and Ralph filled in all interstices of meal - times or railway journeys with perfectly good - tempered arguments ; or they discussed politics , or they told stories , or they did sums together upon the backs of old envelopes to prove something . She suspected that Katharine was absent - minded , but it was impossible to tell . There were moments when she felt so young and inexperienced that she almost wished herself back with the silkworms at Stogdon House , and not embarked upon this bewildering intrigue . These moments , however , were only the necessary shadow or chill which proved the substance of her bliss , and did not damage the radiance which seemed to rest equally upon the whole party . The fresh air of spring , the sky washed of clouds and already shedding warmth from its blue , seemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to the mood of her chosen spirits . These chosen spirits were to be found also among the deer , dumbly basking , and among the fish , set still in mid - stream , for they were mute sharers in a benignant state not needing any exposition by the tongue . No words that Cassandra could come by expressed the stillness , the brightness , the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty of the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four abreast that Sunday afternoon . Silently the shadows of the trees lay across the broad sunshine ; silence wrapt her heart in its folds . The quivering stillness of the butterfly on the half - opened flower , the silent grazing of the deer in the sun , were the sights her eye rested upon and received as the images of her own nature laid open to happiness and trembling in its ecstasy . But the afternoon wore on , and it became time to leave the gardens . As they drove from Waterloo to Chelsea , Katharine began to have some compunction about her father , which , together with the opening of offices and the need of working in them on Monday , made it difficult to plan another festival for the following day . Mr. Hilbery had taken their absence , so far , with paternal benevolence , but they could not trespass upon it indefinitely . Indeed , had they known it , he was already suffering from their absence , and longing for their return . He had no dislike of solitude , and Sunday , in particular , was pleasantly adapted for letter - writing , paying calls , or a visit to his club . He was leaving the house on some such suitable expedition towards tea - time when he found himself stopped on his own doorstep by his sister , Mrs. Milvain . She should , on hearing that no one was at home , have withdrawn submissively , but instead she accepted his half - hearted invitation to come in , and he found himself in the melancholy position of being forced to order tea for her and sit in the drawing - room while she drank it . She speedily made it plain that she was only thus exacting because she had come on a matter of business . He was by no means exhilarated at the news . “
183485	183489	183479	183479	Katharine	129	” he remarked . “
183507	183508	183509	183509	My	0	” “
183529	183530	183531	183531	She	129	” “
183562	183600	183550	183553	A charming young woman	2734	” He turned his stone between his fingers , and conceived different methods of leading Celia away from her obsession , which , he supposed , must have reference to the domestic affairs of Cyril as usual . “
183604	183610	183550	183553	A charming young woman	2734	” Mrs. Milvain repeated significantly . “
183614	183615	183612	183612	Cassandra	303	” “
183621	183632	183619	183619	Cassandra	303	” Mr. Hilbery agreed urbanely , pleased at the diversion . “
183677	183705	183670	183670	I	0	” He was prepared to dwell at some length upon this safe topic , and trusted that Katharine would come in before he had done with it . “
183770	183775	183768	183768	Celia	219	” Mr. Hilbery continued . “
183806	183836	183792	183792	You	219	” Her brother ’s affability did not deceive Mrs. Milvain ; it slightly saddened her ; she well knew the cause of it . Blind and infatuated as usual ! “
183843	183847	183839	183841	this Mr. Denham	131	” she asked . “
183851	183866	183867	183871	A very interesting young man	2744	” said Mr. Hilbery , in relief that her mind had taken this turn . “
183911	183912	183900	183900	he	154	” “
183921	183926	183913	183913	He	154	” Mrs. Milvain interposed . “
183946	183947	183948	183949	A mother	4202	” “
183956	183957	183951	183952	sisters?—His father	2749	” “
183967	184011	184012	184012	His	154	” said Mr. Hilbery , who was prepared to draw upon his imagination , if necessary , to keep Mrs. Milvain supplied with facts about the private history of Ralph Denham since , for some inscrutable reason , the subject took her fancy . “
184030	184031	184021	184023	this young man	433	” “
184036	184041	184042	184042	I	0	” Mrs. Milvain inquired . “
184051	184058	184044	184044	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery shook his head . “
184075	184079	184066	184066	they	2754	” he observed . “
184124	184161	184116	184116	I	0	” he added . The remark sounded to his ears unfortunately conclusive , and he was afraid that there was nothing more to be said about Denham . He examined the tips of his fingers carefully . “
184172	184177	184166	184170	a very charming young woman	2759	” he started afresh . “
184203	184231	184234	184234	Cassandra	303	” Mrs. Milvain had given her cup a little push , which seemed to indicate some momentary displeasure . But she did not want any more tea . “
184241	184245	184234	184234	Cassandra	303	” she began . “
184306	184320	184275	184275	She	303	” Mr. Hilbery looked taken aback , and was silent for a second . “
184327	184341	184275	184275	She	303	” he remarked urbanely , continuing his examination of his finger - nails . “
184352	184370	184345	184345	I	0	” Mrs. Milvain became rigid , and emitted her message in little short sentences of extreme intensity . “
184455	184462	184445	184445	she	129	” There was another slight pause . “
184478	184484	184467	184467	Katharine	129	” Mr. Hilbery replied imperturbably . “
184525	184532	184533	184533	She	129	” Mrs. Milvain rose at once . “
184546	184735	184736	184736	She	2768	” she repeated . She stood very erect with the dauntless air of one testifying to the truth regardless of consequences . She knew from past discussions that the only way to counter her brother ’s indolence and indifference was to shoot her statements at him in a compressed form once finally upon leaving the room . Having spoken thus , she restrained herself from adding another word , and left the house with the dignity of one inspired by a great ideal . She had certainly framed her remarks in such a way as to prevent her brother from paying his call in the region of Knightsbridge . He had no fears for Katharine , but there was a suspicion at the back of his mind that Cassandra might have been , innocently and ignorantly , led into some foolish situation in one of their unshepherded dissipations . His wife was an erratic judge of the conventions ; he himself was lazy ; and with Katharine absorbed , very naturally — Here he recalled , as well as he could , the exact nature of the charge . “
184749	184985	184736	184736	She	2768	” From which it appeared that Katharine was not absorbed , or which of them was it that had entangled herself with Ralph Denham ? From this maze of absurdity Mr. Hilbery saw no way out until Katharine herself came to his help , so that he applied himself , very philosophically on the whole , to a book . No sooner had he heard the young people come in and go upstairs than he sent a maid to tell Miss Katharine that he wished to speak to her in the study . She was slipping furs loosely onto the floor in the drawing - room in front of the fire . They were all gathered round , reluctant to part . The message from her father surprised Katharine , and the others caught from her look , as she turned to go , a vague sense of apprehension . Mr. Hilbery was reassured by the sight of her . He congratulated himself , he prided himself , upon possessing a daughter who had a sense of responsibility and an understanding of life profound beyond her years . Moreover , she was looking to - day unusual ; he had come to take her beauty for granted ; now he remembered it and was surprised by it . He thought instinctively that he had interrupted some happy hour of hers with Rodney , and apologized . “
185116	185144	185113	185114	Mr. Denham	131	” Katharine did not reply at once , and Mr. Hilbery tapped the coal encouragingly with the poker . Then she said , without embarrassment or apology : “
185168	185192	185164	185164	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery was relieved and secretly amused at the thought of the interview , although he could not license such irreverence outwardly . “
185270	185324	185250	185250	I	0	” She did not respond , as he had hoped , with any affectionate or humorous reply . She meditated , pondering something or other , and he reflected that even his Katharine did not differ from other women in the capacity to let things be . Or had she something to say ? “
185331	185336	185250	185250	I	0	” he inquired lightly . “
185342	185358	185340	185340	Katharine	129	” he said more seriously , struck by something in the expression of her eyes . “
185370	185374	185359	185359	I	0	” she said , “
185383	185384	185385	185385	You	129	” “
185391	185403	185385	185385	You	129	” he exclaimed , dropping the poker in his immense surprise . “
185413	185414	185409	185409	yourself	129	” “
185427	185445	185409	185409	yourself	129	” Katharine spoke hurriedly and indifferently , as if the matter could no longer concern any one . “
185467	185468	185462	185462	you	129	” “
185481	185482	185462	185462	you	129	” “
185493	185494	185491	185491	yours	129	” “
185503	185623	185624	185624	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery had seldom felt more completely at a loss . He thought that Katharine was treating the matter with curious unconcern ; she scarcely seemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying ; he did not understand the position at all . But his desire to smooth everything over comfortably came to his relief . No doubt there was some quarrel , some whimsey on the part of William , who , though a good fellow , was a little exacting sometimes — something that a woman could put right . But though he inclined to take the easiest view of his responsibilities , he cared too much for this daughter to let things be . “
185646	185651	185639	185639	William	176	” he said irritably . “
185666	185667	185654	185654	he	176	” “
185674	185678	185668	185668	I	0	” said Katharine . “
185689	185693	185679	185679	I	0	” she added . “
185711	185857	185707	185707	mother	2916	” This appeal for delay was much to Mr. Hilbery ’s liking . But his conscience would not suffer it . People were talking . He could not endure that his daughter ’s conduct should be in any way considered irregular . He wondered whether , in the circumstances , it would be better to wire to his wife , to send for one of his sisters , to forbid William the house , to pack Cassandra off home — for he was vaguely conscious of responsibilities in her direction , too . His forehead was becoming more and more wrinkled by the multiplicity of his anxieties , which he was sorely tempted to ask Katharine to solve for him , when the door opened and William Rodney appeared . This necessitated a complete change , not only of manner , but of position also . “
185862	185872	185860	185860	William	176	” Katharine exclaimed , in a tone of relief . “
185882	185888	185873	185873	I	0	” she said to him . “
185900	185979	185893	185893	I	0	” William ’s manner was marked by the utmost formality . He bowed very slightly in the direction of Mr. Hilbery , and stood erect , holding one lapel of his coat , and gazing into the center of the fire . He waited for Mr. Hilbery to speak . Mr. Hilbery also assumed an appearance of formidable dignity . He had risen to his feet , and now bent the top part of his body slightly forward . “
186000	186008	185992	185992	Katharine	129	” William waited two seconds at least . “
186016	186025	185992	185992	Katharine	129	” he said , with the utmost stiffness . “
186036	186056	186032	186032	your	3311	” After a perceptible pause William bent his head , and Katharine said , as if by an afterthought : “
186061	186082	186032	186032	your	3311	” Mr. Hilbery swayed to and fro , and moved his lips as if to utter remarks which remained unspoken . “
186113	186117	186106	186106	You	3311	” he began . “
186124	186128	186106	186106	You	3311	” Katharine interposed . “
186133	186289	186106	186106	You	3311	” She moved a few paces across the room , as if she intended to leave them . Her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast to her father ’s pomposity and to William ’s military rigidity . He had not once raised his eyes . Katharine ’s glance , on the other hand , ranged past the two gentlemen , along the books , over the tables , towards the door . She was paying the least possible attention , it seemed , to what was happening . Her father looked at her with a sudden clouding and troubling of his expression . Somehow his faith in her stability and sense was queerly shaken . He no longer felt that he could ultimately entrust her with the whole conduct of her own affairs after a superficial show of directing them . He felt , for the first time in many years , responsible for her . “
186302	186320	186321	186321	You	2784	” he said , dropping his formal manner and addressing Rodney as if Katharine were not present . “
186401	186603	186399	186399	Rodney	176	” He was struck by William ’s appearance , which seemed to him to indicate profound feeling resolutely held in check . No doubt , he reflected , Katharine had been very trying , unconsciously trying , and had driven him to take up a position which was none of his willing . Mr. Hilbery certainly did not overrate William ’s sufferings . No minutes in his life had hitherto extorted from him such intensity of anguish . He was now facing the consequences of his insanity . He must confess himself entirely and fundamentally other than Mr. Hilbery thought him . Everything was against him . Even the Sunday evening and the fire and the tranquil library scene were against him . Mr. Hilbery ’s appeal to him as a man of the world was terribly against him . He was no longer a man of any world that Mr. Hilbery cared to recognize . But some power compelled him , as it had compelled him to come downstairs , to make his stand here and now , alone and unhelped by any one , without prospect of reward . He fumbled with various phrases ; and then jerked out : “
186608	186657	186399	186399	Rodney	176	” Mr. Hilbery ’s face turned a curious dull purple . He looked at his daughter . He nodded his head , as if to convey his silent command to her to leave the room ; but either she did not notice it or preferred not to obey . “
186663	186715	186658	186658	You	303	” Mr. Hilbery began , in a dull , low voice that he himself had never heard before , when there was a scuffling and exclaiming in the hall , and Cassandra , who appeared to be insisting against some dissuasion on the part of another , burst into the room . “
186719	186723	186658	186658	You	303	” she exclaimed , “
186732	186785	186724	186724	I	0	” She flung herself between Rodney and her uncle , as if she sought to intercept their blows . As her uncle stood perfectly still , looking very large and imposing , and as nobody spoke , she shrank back a little , and looked first at Katharine and then at Rodney . “
186792	186800	186801	186801	You	210	” she said , a little lamely . “
186814	186828	186801	186801	You	210	” Mr. Hilbery continued , speaking with complete disregard of Cassandra ’s interruption . “
186836	186868	186829	186829	I	0	” Rodney ’s words , which were broken in sense , spoken after a pause , and with his eyes upon the ground , nevertheless expressed an astonishing amount of resolution . “
186880	186897	186874	186874	you	210	” he brought out , looking Mr. Hilbery directly in the eyes for the first time . “
186913	186918	186898	186898	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery returned . “
186924	186954	186920	186920	you	210	” said Katharine . She moved a little towards Rodney , and her movement seemed to testify mutely to her respect for him , and her alliance with him . “
186979	187039	187040	187040	Cassandra	303	” Cassandra , too , gave an indescribably slight movement which seemed to draw the three of them into alliance together . Katharine ’s tone and glance made Mr. Hilbery once more feel completely at a loss , and in addition , painfully and angrily obsolete ; but in spite of an awful inner hollowness he was outwardly composed . “
187097	187186	187077	187077	I	0	” He paused , and his pause seemed to signify that he was extremely thankful for his daughter ’s deliverance . Cassandra turned to Katharine , who drew her breath as if to speak and checked herself ; Rodney , too , seemed to await some movement on her part ; her father glanced at her as if he half anticipated some further revelation . She remained perfectly silent . In the silence they heard distinctly steps descending the staircase , and Katharine went straight to the door . “
187189	187194	187077	187077	I	0	” Mr. Hilbery commanded . “
187204	187216	187195	187195	I	0	” he added . She paused , holding the door ajar . “
187222	187317	187318	187319	Uncle Trevor	210	” she said , and as she spoke she opened the door and went out . They could hear her immediately speak to some one outside , though the words were inaudible . Mr. Hilbery was left confronting the guilty couple , who remained standing as if they did not accept their dismissal , and the disappearance of Katharine had brought some change into the situation . So , in his secret heart , Mr. Hilbery felt that it had , for he could not explain his daughter ’s behavior to his own satisfaction . “
187321	187326	187318	187319	Uncle Trevor	210	” Cassandra exclaimed impulsively , “
187348	187371	187343	187343	you	210	” Her uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity , and still talked over her head as if she did not exist . “
187381	187388	187372	187372	I	0	” he said to Rodney grimly . “
187398	187404	187392	187392	we	2793	” Cassandra replied for him . “
187408	187423	187405	187405	We	2793	” she looked appealingly at Rodney , who shook his head ever so slightly . “
187432	187486	187428	187428	you	0	” her uncle asked sharply , looking at her at last . The words died on her lips . It was apparent that she was straining her ears as if to catch some sound outside the room that would come to her help . He received no answer . He listened , too . “
187497	187532	187428	187428	you	0	” he concluded , sinking into his chair again , hunching his shoulders and regarding the flames . He seemed to speak to himself , and Rodney and Cassandra looked at him in silence . “
187540	187580	187536	187536	you	0	” he said suddenly . He spoke gruffly , but the force of his anger was evidently spent , or some preoccupation had turned his mood to other regions . While Cassandra accepted his invitation , Rodney remained standing . “
187592	187696	187583	187583	Cassandra	303	” he said , and left the room , Mr. Hilbery giving his assent by a slight nod of the head . Meanwhile , in the dining - room next door , Denham and Katharine were once more seated at the mahogany table . They seemed to be continuing a conversation broken off in the middle , as if each remembered the precise point at which they had been interrupted , and was eager to go on as quickly as possible . Katharine , having interposed a short account of the interview with her father , Denham made no comment , but said : “
187711	187712	187708	187709	each other	451	” “
187728	187732	187708	187709	each other	451	” Katharine replied . “
187746	187747	187735	187735	I	0	” “
187757	187769	187735	187735	I	0	” He sighed impatiently , and said nothing for a moment . “
187774	187778	187735	187735	I	0	” he renewed , “
187807	187821	187805	187805	Katharine	129	” he added , his assumption of reason broken up by his agitation , “
187899	187900	187891	187891	you	2797	” “
187903	187914	187891	187891	you	2797	” she exclaimed , as if the subject chafed her , “
187935	187959	187960	187960	I	0	” she ejaculated , tapping her finger upon the table as if to emphasize and perhaps explain her isolated utterance of this word . “
188012	188043	188000	188000	I	0	” They were trying to explain , not for the first time , as their weary gestures and frequent interruptions showed , what in their common language they had christened their “
188045	188745	188000	188000	I	0	” ; a constant source of distress to them , in the past few days , and the immediate reason why Ralph was on his way to leave the house when Katharine , listening anxiously , heard him and prevented him . What was the cause of these lapses ? Either because Katharine looked more beautiful , or more strange , because she wore something different , or said something unexpected , Ralph ’s sense of her romance welled up and overcame him either into silence or into inarticulate expressions , which Katharine , with unintentional but invariable perversity , interrupted or contradicted with some severity or assertion of prosaic fact . Then the vision disappeared , and Ralph expressed vehemently in his turn the conviction that he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her reality . If the lapse was on her side it took the form of gradual detachment until she became completely absorbed in her own thoughts , which carried her away with such intensity that she sharply resented any recall to her companion ’s side . It was useless to assert that these trances were always originated by Ralph himself , however little in their later stages they had to do with him . The fact remained that she had no need of him and was very loath to be reminded of him . How , then , could they be in love ? The fragmentary nature of their relationship was but too apparent . Thus they sat depressed to silence at the dining - room table , oblivious of everything , while Rodney paced the drawing - room overhead in such agitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived possible , and Cassandra remained alone with her uncle . Ralph , at length , rose and walked gloomily to the window . He pressed close to the pane . Outside were truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness , and never communicated to another . What worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it ? Some movement behind him made him reflect that Katharine had the power , if she chose , to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit . He turned sharply to implore her help , when again he was struck cold by her look of distance , her expression of intentness upon some far object . As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came to him , standing close by his side , and looking with him out into the dusky atmosphere . Their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough comment upon the distance between their minds . Yet distant as she was , her presence by his side transformed the world . He saw himself performing wonderful deeds of courage ; saving the drowning , rescuing the forlorn . Impatient with this form of egotism , he could not shake off the conviction that somehow life was wonderful , romantic , a master worth serving so long as she stood there . He had no wish that she should speak ; he did not look at her or touch her ; she was apparently deep in her own thoughts and oblivious of his presence . The door opened without their hearing the sound . Mr. Hilbery looked round the room , and for a moment failed to discover the two figures in the window . He started with displeasure when he saw them , and observed them keenly before he appeared able to make up his mind to say anything . He made a movement finally that warned them of his presence ; they turned instantly . Without speaking , he beckoned to Katharine to come to him , and , keeping his eyes from the region of the room where Denham stood , he shepherded her in front of him back to the study . When Katharine was inside the room he shut the study door carefully behind him as if to secure himself from something that he disliked . “
188750	188764	188765	188765	you	129	” he said , taking up his stand in front of the fire , “
188776	188781	188765	188765	you	129	” She remained silent . “
188791	188796	188797	188797	You	129	” he said sharply .... “
188835	188845	188848	188849	Ralph Denham	154	” he added , as she still said nothing , “
188851	188852	188848	188849	Ralph Denham	154	” “
188855	188900	188848	188849	Ralph Denham	154	” she replied . His sense of relief was great ; he had been certain that her answer would have confirmed his suspicions , but that anxiety being set at rest , he was the more conscious of annoyance with her for her behavior . “
188944	188956	188940	188940	I	0	” he went on , his anger rising as he spoke . “
189051	189171	189049	189049	Katharine	129	” He broke off , disquieted by the ominous silence with which his words were received , and looked at his daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of mind which he had felt before , for the first time , this evening . He perceived once more that she was not attending to what he said , but was listening , and for a moment he , too , listened for sounds outside the room . His certainty that there was some understanding between Denham and Katharine returned , but with a most unpleasant suspicion that there was something illicit about it , as the whole position between the young people seemed to him gravely illicit . “
189178	189195	189172	189172	I	0	” he said , on the impulse of his suspicion , moving as if to go . “
189202	189210	189196	189196	I	0	” Katharine said instantly , starting forward . “
189216	189221	189211	189211	You	0	” said her father . “
189231	189235	189224	189224	you	0	” she asked . “
189249	189253	189238	189238	I	0	” he returned . “
189260	189310	189255	189255	I	0	” she replied . At these words , which seemed to imply a determination to go — to go for ever , Mr. Hilbery returned to his position in front of the fire , and began swaying slightly from side to side without for the moment making any remark . “
189324	189337	189317	189317	you	0	” he said at length , fixing his eyes upon his daughter . “
189343	189347	189317	189317	you	0	” she said . “
189383	189400	189402	189402	me	0	” he broke off angrily , perceiving a slight movement on her part to one side . “
189414	189415	189407	189407	your	0	” “
189426	189431	189432	189432	I	0	” she said obstinately . “
189441	189445	189446	189446	I	0	” he replied . “
189451	189466	189446	189446	I	0	” she returned , and as she said it the front door banged to . “
189469	189473	189446	189446	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
189478	189501	189474	189474	He	433	” She flashed such a look of fiery indignation at her father that he lost his self - control for a moment . “
189512	189581	189510	189510	yourself	129	” he cried . She looked for a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized dwelling - place . She glanced over the walls covered with books , as if for a second she had forgotten the position of the door . Then she made as if to go , but her father laid his hand upon her shoulder . He compelled her to sit down . “
189591	189614	189615	189615	You	129	” he said . His manner had regained all its suavity , and he spoke with a soothing assumption of paternal authority . “
189687	190543	189681	189684	The Bride of Lammermoor	2815	” He made his own choice , and before his daughter could protest or make her escape , she found herself being turned by the agency of Sir Walter Scott into a civilized human being . Yet Mr. Hilbery had grave doubts , as he read , whether the process was more than skin - deep . Civilization had been very profoundly and unpleasantly overthrown that evening ; the extent of the ruin was still undetermined ; he had lost his temper , a physical disaster not to be matched for the space of ten years or so ; and his own condition urgently required soothing and renovating at the hands of the classics . His house was in a state of revolution ; he had a vision of unpleasant encounters on the staircase ; his meals would be poisoned for days to come ; was literature itself a specific against such disagreeables ? A note of hollowness was in his voice as he read . Considering that Mr. Hilbery lived in a house which was accurately numbered in order with its fellows , and that he filled up forms , paid rent , and had seven more years of tenancy to run , he had an excuse for laying down laws for the conduct of those who lived in his house , and this excuse , though profoundly inadequate , he found useful during the interregnum of civilization with which he now found himself faced . In obedience to those laws , Rodney disappeared ; Cassandra was dispatched to catch the eleven - thirty on Monday morning ; Denham was seen no more ; so that only Katharine , the lawful occupant of the upper rooms , remained , and Mr. Hilbery thought himself competent to see that she did nothing further to compromise herself . As he bade her good morning next day he was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking , but , as he reflected with some bitterness , even this was an advance upon the ignorance of the previous mornings . He went to his study , wrote , tore up , and wrote again a letter to his wife , asking her to come back on account of domestic difficulties which he specified at first , but in a later draft more discreetly left unspecified . Even if she started the very moment that she got it , he reflected , she would not be home till Tuesday night , and he counted lugubriously the number of hours that he would have to spend in a position of detestable authority alone with his daughter . What was she doing now , he wondered , as he addressed the envelope to his wife . He could not control the telephone . He could not play the spy . She might be making any arrangements she chose . Yet the thought did not disturb him so much as the strange , unpleasant , illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before . His sense of discomfort was almost physical . Had he known it , Katharine was far enough withdrawn , both physically and spiritually , from the telephone . She sat in her room with the dictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before her , and all the pages which they had concealed for so many years arranged in a pile . She worked with the steady concentration that is produced by the successful effort to think down some unwelcome thought by means of another thought . Having absorbed the unwelcome thought , her mind went on with additional vigor , derived from the victory ; on a sheet of paper lines of figures and symbols frequently and firmly written down marked the different stages of its progress . And yet it was broad daylight ; there were sounds of knocking and sweeping , which proved that living people were at work on the other side of the door , and the door , which could be thrown open in a second , was her only protection against the world . But she had somehow risen to be mistress in her own kingdom , assuming her sovereignty unconsciously . Steps approached her unheard . It is true that they were steps that lingered , divagated , and mounted with the deliberation natural to one past sixty whose arms , moreover , are full of leaves and blossoms ; but they came on steadily , and soon a tap of laurel boughs against the door arrested Katharine ’s pencil as it touched the page . She did not move , however , and sat blank - eyed as if waiting for the interruption to cease . Instead , the door opened . At first , she attached no meaning to the moving mass of green which seemed to enter the room independently of any human agency . Then she recognized parts of her mother ’s face and person behind the yellow flowers and soft velvet of the palm - buds . “
190549	190585	189681	189684	The Bride of Lammermoor	2815	” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery , dropping the entire mass upon the floor , with a gesture that seemed to indicate an act of dedication . Then she flung her arms wide and embraced her daughter . “
190591	190595	190589	190589	Katharine	129	” she exclaimed . “
190599	190603	190597	190597	God	355	” she repeated . “
190609	190677	190604	190604	You	129	” said Katharine , very vaguely , standing up to receive the embrace . Although she recognized her mother ’s presence , she was very far from taking part in the scene , and yet felt it to be amazingly appropriate that her mother should be there , thanking God emphatically for unknown blessings , and strewing the floor with flowers and leaves from Shakespeare ’s tomb . “
190685	190690	190604	190604	You	129	” Mrs. Hilbery continued . “
190741	190742	190733	190733	I	0	” “
190747	190762	190743	190743	You	129	” Katharine repeated her mother ’s words softly and vaguely , looking past her . “
190769	190788	190765	190765	you	129	” She began , like a child , to finger a tassel hanging from her mother ’s cloak . “
190829	190845	190821	190821	your	129	” Katharine seemed to consider each of these proofs separately . Then she said gravely : “
190860	190861	190858	190858	Cassandra	303	” “
190868	190873	190866	190866	Cassandra	303	” said Mrs. Hilbery . “
190902	190907	190900	190900	Katharine	129	” she asked impulsively , “
190925	190931	190914	190914	she	303	” Katharine recollected with difficulty . “
190937	190941	190914	190914	she	303	” she remembered . “
190944	190959	190914	190914	she	303	” said Mrs. Hilbery , with a slight note of disappointment in her voice . “
190970	191001	190960	190960	I	0	” She looked at her daughter . Katharine faltered beneath that innocent and penetrating gaze ; she flushed , turned away , and then looked up with very bright eyes . “
191011	191015	191002	191002	I	0	” she said . “
191025	191032	191002	191002	I	0	” said Mrs. Hilbery very quickly . “
191035	191045	191002	191002	I	0	” she added , glancing momentarily at her daughter , “
191057	191058	191052	191052	Katharine	129	” “
191074	191078	191002	191002	I	0	” Katharine continued . “
191095	191139	191052	191052	Katharine	129	” Mrs. Hilbery ran over these phrases as if she were trying chords that did not quite satisfy her ear . It was plain that she had her sources of information , and , indeed , her bag was stuffed with what she called “
191142	191154	191224	191224	he	154	” from the pen of her sister - in - law . “
191165	191183	191224	191224	he	154	” Katharine concluded . Mrs. Hilbery paused , looked unhappy , and sought inspiration from the window . “
191211	191212	191206	191206	I	0	” “
191270	191271	191263	191263	sisters	516	” “
191279	191284	191263	191263	sisters	516	” Mrs. Hilbery inquired . “
191299	191365	191288	191293	a fine - looking old lady	2832	” Katharine began to describe her visit , and soon Mrs. Hilbery elicited the facts that not only was the house of excruciating ugliness , which Ralph bore without complaint , but that it was evident that every one depended on him , and he had a room at the top of the house , with a wonderful view over London , and a rook . “
191380	191420	191288	191293	a fine - looking old lady	2832	” she said , with a tenderness in her voice that seemed to commiserate the sufferings of humanity while resting assured in the capacity of Ralph Denham to alleviate them , so that Mrs. Hilbery could not help exclaiming : “
191430	191664	191423	191423	Katharine	129	” at which Katharine flushed , looked startled , as if she had said something that she ought not to have said , and shook her head . Hastily Mrs. Hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary house , and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between Keats and Coleridge in a lane , which tided over the discomfort of the moment , and drew Katharine on to further descriptions and indiscretions . In truth , she found an extraordinary pleasure in being thus free to talk to some one who was equally wise and equally benignant , the mother of her earliest childhood , whose silence seemed to answer questions that were never asked . Mrs. Hilbery listened without making any remark for a considerable time . She seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking at her daughter than by listening to her , and , if cross - examined , she would probably have given a highly inaccurate version of Ralph Denham ’s life - history except that he was penniless , fatherless , and lived at Highgate — all of which was much in his favor . But by means of these furtive glances she had assured herself that Katharine was in a state which gave her , alternately , the most exquisite pleasure and the most profound alarm . She could not help ejaculating at last : “
191700	191701	191679	191679	you	2834	” “
191711	191719	191679	191679	you	2834	” Katharine replied emphatically , and added , “
191737	191779	191679	191679	you	2834	” Again Mrs. Hilbery looked discomposed , and , in her trouble , took up the sheets which were lying upon the table , and began turning them over this way and that , and muttering to herself as she glanced : “
191810	191846	191803	191803	I	0	” Katharine took the sheets from her mother ’s hand and began shuffling them absent - mindedly together , for her fixed gaze seemed to show that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter . “
191856	191862	191849	191849	I	0	” she said at length . “
191872	191877	191864	191864	he	2836	” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed . “
191889	191890	191891	191891	He	2836	” “
191904	191905	191891	191891	He	2836	” “
191922	191923	191912	191912	Katharine	129	” “
191932	191981	191982	191982	We	2835	” Mrs. Hilbery , her eyes growing blank , peered down the enormously long corridor of days at the far end of which the little figures of herself and her husband appeared fantastically attired , clasping hands upon a moonlit beach , with roses swinging in the dusk . “
191996	192000	191982	191982	We	2835	” she began . “
192071	192179	192322	192322	you	2845	” The ancient fairy - tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon Katharine ’s ears . Yes , there was the enormous space of the sea ; there were the three green lights upon the steamer ; the cloaked figures climbed up on deck . And so , voyaging over the green and purple waters , past the cliffs and the sandy lagoons and through pools crowded with the masts of ships and the steeples of churches — here they were . The river seemed to have brought them and deposited them here at this precise point . She looked admiringly at her mother , that ancient voyager . “
192183	192192	192324	192324	Katharine	129	” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery , continuing her reveries , “
192227	192310	192324	192324	Katharine	129	” she crooned , and the soft sound beating through the dim words was heard by her daughter as the breaking of waves solemnly in order upon the vast shore that she gazed upon . She would have been content for her mother to repeat that word almost indefinitely — a soothing word when uttered by another , a riveting together of the shattered fragments of the world . But Mrs. Hilbery , instead of repeating the word love , said pleadingly : “
192326	192395	192322	192322	you	2845	” at which words the ship which Katharine had been considering seemed to put into harbor and have done with its seafaring . Yet she was in great need , if not exactly of sympathy , of some form of advice , or , at least , of the opportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person so as to renew them in her own eyes . “
192399	192410	192411	192411	you	2845	” she said , ignoring the difficult problem of ugliness , “
192426	192442	192322	192322	you	2845	” she continued , frowning a little as she tried to fix the difficult feeling , “
192568	192572	192647	192647	you	2850	” she continued , “
192583	192606	192607	192607	We	2846	” Mrs. Hilbery waited patiently for the sentence to be completed , but Katharine fell silent and fingered her sheet of figures . “
192616	192643	192647	192647	you	2850	” Mrs. Hilbery resumed , glancing at the figures , which distressed her vaguely , and had some connection in her mind with the household accounts , “
192650	192672	192647	192647	you	2850	” She cast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment which were , perhaps , not altogether unknown to her . “
192695	192725	192692	192693	your father	1101	” she said earnestly , and sighed . They looked together into the abyss and , as the elder of the two , she recovered herself first and asked : “
192740	192747	192734	192734	he	154	” Katharine ’s expression changed instantly . “
192757	192768	192749	192749	he	154	” she replied bitterly . Mrs. Hilbery brushed this aside . “
192780	192858	192859	192859	I	0	” she asked . Katharine looked at her as if , indeed , she were some magician . Once more she felt that instead of being a grown woman , used to advise and command , she was only a foot or two raised above the long grass and the little flowers and entirely dependent upon the figure of indefinite size whose head went up into the sky , whose hand was in hers , for guidance . “
192866	193871	193872	193872	I	0	” she said simply . Mrs. Hilbery nodded her head in a manner which indicated complete understanding , and the immediate conception of certain plans for the future . She swept up her flowers , breathed in their sweetness , and , humming a little song about a miller ’s daughter , left the room . The case upon which Ralph Denham was engaged that afternoon was not apparently receiving his full attention , and yet the affairs of the late John Leake of Dublin were sufficiently confused to need all the care that a solicitor could bestow upon them , if the widow Leake and the five Leake children of tender age were to receive any pittance at all . But the appeal to Ralph ’s humanity had little chance of being heard to - day ; he was no longer a model of concentration . The partition so carefully erected between the different sections of his life had been broken down , with the result that though his eyes were fixed upon the last Will and Testament , he saw through the page a certain drawing - room in Cheyne Walk . He tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping up the partitions of the mind , until he could decently go home ; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently , as if from outside , by Katharine , that he launched forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her . She obliterated a bookcase full of law reports , and the corners and lines of the room underwent a curious softening of outline like that which sometimes makes a room unfamiliar at the moment of waking from sleep . By degrees , a pulse or stress began to beat at regular intervals in his mind , heaping his thoughts into waves to which words fitted themselves , and without much consciousness of what he was doing , he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what had the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line . Not many lines had been set down , however , before he threw away his pen as violently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds , and tore the paper into many separate pieces . This was a sign that Katharine had asserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met poetically . Her remark was entirely destructive of poetry , since it was to the effect that poetry had nothing whatever to do with her ; all her friends spent their lives in making up phrases , she said ; all his feeling was an illusion , and next moment , as if to taunt him with his impotence , she had sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no account whatever of his existence . Ralph was roused by his passionate attempts to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing in the middle of his little private room in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields at a considerable distance from Chelsea . The physical distance increased his desperation . He began pacing in circles until the process sickened him , and then took a sheet of paper for the composition of a letter which , he vowed before he began it , should be sent that same evening . It was a difficult matter to put into words ; poetry would have done it better justice , but he must abstain from poetry . In an infinite number of half - obliterated scratches he tried to convey to her the possibility that although human beings are woefully ill - adapted for communication , still , such communion is the best we know ; moreover , they make it possible for each to have access to another world independent of personal affairs , a world of law , of philosophy , or more strangely a world such as he had had a glimpse of the other evening when together they seemed to be sharing something , creating something , an ideal — a vision flung out in advance of our actual circumstances . If this golden rim were quenched , if life were no longer circled by an illusion ( but was it an illusion after all ? ) , then it would be too dismal an affair to carry to an end ; so he wrote with a sudden spurt of conviction which made clear way for a space and left at least one sentence standing whole . Making every allowance for other desires , on the whole this conclusion appeared to him to justify their relationship . But the conclusion was mystical ; it plunged him into thought . The difficulty with which even this amount was written , the inadequacy of the words , and the need of writing under them and over them others which , after all , did no better , led him to leave off before he was at all satisfied with his production , and unable to resist the conviction that such rambling would never be fit for Katharine ’s eye . He felt himself more cut off from her than ever . In idleness , and because he could do nothing further with words , he began to draw little figures in the blank spaces , heads meant to resemble her head , blots fringed with flames meant to represent — perhaps the entire universe . From this occupation he was roused by the message that a lady wished to speak to him . He had scarcely time to run his hands through his hair in order to look as much like a solicitor as possible , and to cram his papers into his pocket , already overcome with shame that another eye should behold them , when he realized that his preparations were needless . The lady was Mrs. Hilbery . “
193886	193898	193874	193874	you	2852	” she remarked , gazing at the documents on his table , “
194128	194186	194187	194187	I	0	” The effect of these parentheses , whether they were introduced for that purpose or represented a natural instinct on Mrs. Hilbery ’s part to embellish the bareness of her discourse , gave Ralph time to perceive that she possessed all the facts of their situation and was come , somehow , in the capacity of ambassador . “
194198	194208	194187	194187	I	0	” Mrs. Hilbery continued , with a little laugh , “
194232	194236	194237	194237	I	0	” She paused . “
194251	194255	194248	194249	Mr. Denham	131	” she exclaimed , “
194280	194323	194277	194277	she	129	” Ralph , whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused to articulate , somehow contrived to say that there were moments when he felt hopeless , utterly hopeless , though he gave no reason for this statement on his part . “
194330	194335	194325	194325	you	2861	” Mrs. Hilbery inquired . “
194339	194352	194325	194325	you	2861	” he exclaimed , with a vehemence which admitted of no question . “
194365	194371	194372	194372	I	0	” Mrs. Hilbery inquired innocently . “
194383	194387	194372	194372	I	0	” Ralph replied . “
194403	194408	194388	194388	You	2861	” Mrs. Hilbery inquired . “
194419	194496	194409	194409	I	0	” Ralph replied . His doubts upon this point , which were always roused by Katharine ’s presence , had vanished completely , and his strongest wish in the world was to be with her immediately , since every second he was away from her he imagined her slipping farther and farther from him into one of those states of mind in which he was unrepresented . He wished to dominate her , to possess her . “
194500	194784	194409	194409	I	0	” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery . She thanked Him for a variety of blessings : for the conviction with which the young man spoke ; and not least for the prospect that on her daughter ’s wedding - day the noble cadences , the stately periods , the ancient eloquence of the marriage service would resound over the heads of a distinguished congregation gathered together near the very spot where her father lay quiescent with the other poets of England . The tears filled her eyes ; but she remembered simultaneously that her carriage was waiting , and with dim eyes she walked to the door . Denham followed her downstairs . It was a strange drive . For Denham it was without exception the most unpleasant he had ever taken . His only wish was to go as straightly and quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk ; but it soon appeared that Mrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by interposing various errands of her own . She stopped the carriage at post - offices , and coffee - shops , and shops of inscrutable dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends ; and , catching sight of the dome of St. Paul ’s above the irregular spires of Ludgate Hill , she pulled the cord impulsively , and gave directions that Anderson should drive them there . But Anderson had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship , and kept his horse ’s nose obstinately towards the west . After some minutes , Mrs. Hilbery realized the situation , and accepted it good - humoredly , apologizing to Ralph for his disappointment . “
194788	194792	194409	194409	I	0	” she said , “
194833	195018	194819	194819	he	2864	” Ralph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say . Her mind and body both seemed to have floated into another region of quick - sailing clouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in a vaporous indistinctness . Meanwhile he remained conscious of his own concentrated desire , his impotence to bring about anything he wished , and his increasing agony of impatience . Suddenly Mrs. Hilbery pulled the cord with such decision that even Anderson had to listen to the order which she leant out of the window to give him . The carriage pulled up abruptly in the middle of Whitehall before a large building dedicated to one of our Government offices . In a second Mrs. Hilbery was mounting the steps , and Ralph was left in too acute an irritation by this further delay even to speculate what errand took her now to the Board of Education . He was about to jump from the carriage and take a cab , when Mrs. Hilbery reappeared talking genially to a figure who remained hidden behind her . “
195028	195033	194819	194819	he	2864	” she was saying . “
195049	195214	195047	195047	William	170	” she added , opening the door , and Ralph found that Rodney had now joined their company . The two men glanced at each other . If distress , shame , discomfort in its most acute form were ever visible upon a human face , Ralph could read them all expressed beyond the eloquence of words upon the face of his unfortunate companion . But Mrs. Hilbery was either completely unseeing or determined to appear so . She went on talking ; she talked , it seemed to both the young men , to some one outside , up in the air . She talked about Shakespeare , she apostrophized the human race , she proclaimed the virtues of divine poetry , she began to recite verses which broke down in the middle . The great advantage of her discourse was that it was self - supporting . It nourished itself until Cheyne Walk was reached upon half a dozen grunts and murmurs . “
195217	195227	195047	195047	William	170	” she said , alighting briskly at her door , “
195232	195287	195288	195288	You	2869	” There was something airy and ironical in her voice and expression as she turned upon the doorstep and looked at them , which filled both Rodney and Denham with the same misgivings at having trusted their fortunes to such an ambassador ; and Rodney actually hesitated upon the threshold and murmured to Denham : “
195296	195372	195294	195294	I	0	” He was turning tail , but the door opening and the familiar look of the house asserting its charm , he bolted in on the wake of the others , and the door shut upon his escape . Mrs. Hilbery led the way upstairs . She took them to the drawing - room . The fire burnt as usual , the little tables were laid with china and silver . There was nobody there . “
195375	195379	195294	195294	I	0	” she said , “
195413	195527	195410	195410	your	2873	” she vaguely indicated the ceiling with a gesture of her hand . She had become suddenly serious and composed , mistress in her own house . The gesture with which she dismissed him had a dignity that Ralph never forgot . She seemed to make him free with a wave of her hand to all that she possessed . He left the room . The Hilberys ’ house was tall , possessing many stories and passages with closed doors , all , once he had passed the drawing - room floor , unknown to Ralph . He mounted as high as he could and knocked at the first door he came to . “
195533	195542	195529	195529	I	0	” he asked . A voice from within answered “
195545	195663	195529	195529	I	0	” He was conscious of a large window , full of light , of a bare table , and of a long looking - glass . Katharine had risen , and was standing with some white papers in her hand , which slowly fluttered to the ground as she saw her visitor . The explanation was a short one . The sounds were inarticulate ; no one could have understood the meaning save themselves . As if the forces of the world were all at work to tear them asunder they sat , clasping hands , near enough to be taken even by the malicious eye of Time himself for a united couple , an indivisible unit . “
195672	195767	195529	195529	I	0	” she begged of him , when he stooped to gather the papers she had let fall . But he took them in his hands and , giving her by a sudden impulse his own unfinished dissertation , with its mystical conclusion , they read each other ’s compositions in silence . Katharine read his sheets to an end ; Ralph followed her figures as far as his mathematics would let him . They came to the end of their tasks at about the same moment , and sat for a time in silence . “
195780	195786	195787	195787	You	2874	” said Ralph at length . “
195801	196019	195787	195787	You	2874	” She blushed very deeply ; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her face she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences , or Ralph likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to fold themselves within reach of his hand . The moment of exposure had been exquisitely painful — the light shed startlingly vivid . She had now to get used to the fact that some one shared her loneliness . The bewilderment was half shame and half the prelude to profound rejoicing . Nor was she unconscious that on the surface the whole thing must appear of the utmost absurdity . She looked to see whether Ralph smiled , but found his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the belief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself , perhaps immeasurably , perhaps eternally . She hardly dared steep herself in the infinite bliss . But his glance seemed to ask for some assurance upon another point of vital interest to him . It beseeched her mutely to tell him whether what she had read upon his confused sheet had any meaning or truth to her . She bent her head once more to the papers she held . “
196031	196236	196020	196020	I	0	” she said meditatively . Ralph nearly tore the page from her hand in shame and despair when he saw her actually contemplating the idiotic symbol of his most confused and emotional moments . He was convinced that it could mean nothing to another , although somehow to him it conveyed not only Katharine herself but all those states of mind which had clustered round her since he first saw her pouring out tea on a Sunday afternoon . It represented by its circumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling glow which for him surrounded , inexplicably , so many of the objects of life , softening their sharp outline , so that he could see certain streets , books , and situations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye . Did she smile ? Did she put the paper down wearily , condemning it not only for its inadequacy but for its falsity ? Was she going to protest once more that he only loved the vision of her ? But it did not occur to her that this diagram had anything to do with her . She said simply , and in the same tone of reflection : “
196249	196517	196518	196518	Cassandra	303	” He received her assurance with profound joy . Quietly and steadily there rose up behind the whole aspect of life that soft edge of fire which gave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the scene with shadows so deep and dark that one could fancy pushing farther into their density and still farther , exploring indefinitely . Whether there was any correspondence between the two prospects now opening before them they shared the same sense of the impending future , vast , mysterious , infinitely stored with undeveloped shapes which each would unwrap for the other to behold ; but for the present the prospect of the future was enough to fill them with silent adoration . At any rate , their further attempts to communicate articulately were interrupted by a knock on the door , and the entrance of a maid who , with a due sense of mystery , announced that a lady wished to see Miss Hilbery , but refused to allow her name to be given . When Katharine rose , with a profound sigh , to resume her duties , Ralph went with her , and neither of them formulated any guess , on their way downstairs , as to who this anonymous lady might prove to be . Perhaps the fantastic notion that she was a little black hunchback provided with a steel knife , which she would plunge into Katharine ’s heart , appeared to Ralph more probable than another , and he pushed first into the dining - room to avert the blow . Then he exclaimed “
196520	196552	196518	196518	Cassandra	303	” with such heartiness at the sight of Cassandra Otway standing by the dining - room table that she put her finger to her lips and begged him to be quiet . “
196560	196568	196569	196569	I	0	” she explained in a sepulchral whisper . “
196598	196627	196628	196628	William	176	” Katharine pushed forward a chair ; Ralph hastily found wine and poured it out for her . If not actually fainting , she was very near it . “
196632	196645	196628	196628	William	176	” said Ralph , as soon as she appeared to be recovered . “
196658	196756	196651	196651	him	176	” His own happiness had given him a confidence that every one else was bound to be happy too . But Cassandra had her uncle ’s commands and anger too vividly in her mind to dare any such defiance . She became agitated and said that she must leave the house at once . She was not in a condition to go , had they known where to send her . Katharine ’s common sense , which had been in abeyance for the past week or two , still failed her , and she could only ask , “
196763	196784	196785	196785	I	0	” in the vague belief that to take lodgings depended entirely upon a sufficiency of luggage . Cassandra ’s reply , “
196791	196801	196785	196785	I	0	” in no way helped her to a conclusion . “
196808	196913	196802	196802	You	129	” she repeated . Her eyes rested upon Ralph , with an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany a profound thanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal devotion than a question about luggage . Cassandra perceived the look , and saw that it was returned ; her eyes filled with tears . She faltered in what she was saying . She began bravely again to discuss the question of lodging when Katharine , who seemed to have communicated silently with Ralph , and obtained his permission , took her ruby ring from her finger and giving it to Cassandra , said : “
196924	196955	196914	196914	I	0	” These words would not have been enough to convince Cassandra of what she very much wished to believe had not Ralph taken the bare hand in his and demanded : “
196966	197086	196959	196959	you	129	” Cassandra was so glad that the tears ran down her cheeks . The certainty of Katharine ’s engagement not only relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self - reproaches , but entirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately impaired her belief in Katharine . Her old faith came back to her . She seemed to behold her with that curious intensity which she had lost ; as a being who walks just beyond our sphere , so that life in their presence is a heightened process , illuminating not only ourselves but a considerable stretch of the surrounding world . Next moment she contrasted her own lot with theirs and gave back the ring . “
197099	197103	197097	197097	himself	176	” she said . “
197111	197112	197109	197109	Katharine	129	” “
197122	197126	197113	197113	I	0	” said Ralph . “
197132	197181	197128	197128	me	0	” He was about , in spite of Cassandra ’s protest , to reach the door , when Mrs. Hilbery , either warned by the parlor - maid or conscious with her usual prescience of the need for her intervention , opened the door and smilingly surveyed them . “
197186	197190	197128	197128	me	0	” she exclaimed . “
197203	197212	197213	197213	William	176	” she observed , in a general way . “
197239	197261	197262	197262	I	0	” She seemed to have proved something to her own satisfaction , although nobody felt certain what thing precisely it was . “
197266	197270	197264	197264	Cassandra	303	” she repeated . “
197276	197288	197264	197264	Cassandra	303	” Katharine interposed , seeing that Cassandra was unable to speak . “
197291	197306	197264	197264	Cassandra	303	” began Mrs. Hilbery , drawing inspiration from the portraits on the wall apparently , “
197315	197502	197264	197264	Cassandra	303	” But she pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have boiled completely over everything . To Katharine ’s agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was an enormous kettle , capable of deluging the house in its incessant showers of steam , the enraged representative of all those household duties which she had neglected . She ran hastily up to the drawing - room , and the rest followed her , for Mrs. Hilbery put her arm round Cassandra and drew her upstairs . They found Rodney observing the kettle with uneasiness but with such absence of mind that Katharine ’s catastrophe was in a fair way to be fulfilled . In putting the matter straight no greetings were exchanged , but Rodney and Cassandra chose seats as far apart as possible , and sat down with an air of people making a very temporary lodgment . Either Mrs. Hilbery was impervious to their discomfort , or chose to ignore it , or thought it high time that the subject was changed , for she did nothing but talk about Shakespeare ’s tomb . “
197519	197623	197624	197624	Katharine	129	” she mused , and went on to sing her strange , half - earthly song of dawns and sunsets , of great poets , and the unchanged spirit of noble loving which they had taught , so that nothing changes , and one age is linked with another , and no one dies , and we all meet in spirit , until she appeared oblivious of any one in the room . But suddenly her remarks seemed to contract the enormously wide circle in which they were soaring and to alight , airily and temporarily , upon matters of more immediate moment . “
197628	197639	197640	197640	William	176	” she said , as if to try the sound . “
197644	197645	197646	197646	I	0	” “
197655	197669	197646	197646	I	0	” said William desperately , thrusting himself into this breach in her reflections . “
197702	197703	197698	197698	I	0	” “
197710	197714	197704	197704	I	0	” Cassandra interrupted . “
197725	197726	197717	197718	Uncle Trevor	210	” “
197737	197757	197727	197727	I	0	” Rodney went on , rising from his seat , in which movement he was imitated simultaneously by Cassandra . “
197782	197791	197816	197816	your	2886	conduct”—he looked at Katharine , stammered , and fell silent—“where
197803	197810	197811	197811	I	0	” he forced himself to continue . “
197856	197937	197938	197938	You	0	” he repeated , like a speaker who has lost his notes . Two emotions seemed to be struggling in Katharine ; one the desire to laugh at the ridiculous spectacle of William making her a formal speech across the tea - table , the other a desire to weep at the sight of something childlike and honest in him which touched her inexpressibly . To every one ’s surprise she rose , stretched out her hand , and said : “
197950	198159	197946	197946	you’ve	0	” but here her voice died away , and the tears forced themselves into her eyes , and ran down her cheeks , while William , equally moved , seized her hand and pressed it to his lips . No one perceived that the drawing - room door had opened itself sufficiently to admit at least half the person of Mr. Hilbery , or saw him gaze at the scene round the tea - table with an expression of the utmost disgust and expostulation . He withdrew unseen . He paused outside on the landing trying to recover his self - control and to decide what course he might with most dignity pursue . It was obvious to him that his wife had entirely confused the meaning of his instructions . She had plunged them all into the most odious confusion . He waited a moment , and then , with much preliminary rattling of the handle , opened the door a second time . They had all regained their places ; some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing and looking under the table , so that his entrance passed momentarily unperceived . Katharine , with flushed cheeks , raised her head and said : “
198171	198172	198179	198179	they	2890	” “
198182	198196	198179	198179	they	2890	” said Ralph , stooping to turn up the corner of the hearthrug . “
198209	198222	198204	198204	We	2891	” Mrs. Hilbery began , and then saw her husband and exclaimed : “
198237	198448	198451	198451	Trevor	210	” Mr. Hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet . Remarkably enough , the ring had rolled to the very point where he stood . He saw the rubies touching the tip of his boot . Such is the force of habit that he could not refrain from stooping , with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at being the one to find what others were looking for , and , picking the ring up , he presented it , with a bow that was courtly in the extreme , to Cassandra . Whether the making of a bow released automatically feelings of complaisance and urbanity , Mr. Hilbery found his resentment completely washed away during the second in which he bent and straightened himself . Cassandra dared to offer her cheek and received his embrace . He nodded with some degree of stiffness to Rodney and Denham , who had both risen upon seeing him , and now altogether sat down . Mrs. Hilbery seemed to have been waiting for the entrance of her husband , and for this precise moment in order to put to him a question which , from the ardor with which she announced it , had evidently been pressing for utterance for some time past . “
198470	198873	198451	198451	Trevor	210	” In order to answer her Mr. Hilbery had to have recourse to the exact scholarship of William Rodney , and before he had given his excellent authorities for believing as he believed , Rodney felt himself admitted once more to the society of the civilized and sanctioned by the authority of no less a person than Shakespeare himself . The power of literature , which had temporarily deserted Mr. Hilbery , now came back to him , pouring over the raw ugliness of human affairs its soothing balm , and providing a form into which such passions as he had felt so painfully the night before could be molded so that they fell roundly from the tongue in shapely phrases , hurting nobody . He was sufficiently sure of his command of language at length to look at Katharine and again at Denham . All this talk about Shakespeare had acted as a soporific , or rather as an incantation upon Katharine . She leaned back in her chair at the head of the tea - table , perfectly silent , looking vaguely past them all , receiving the most generalized ideas of human heads against pictures , against yellow - tinted walls , against curtains of deep crimson velvet . Denham , to whom he turned next , shared her immobility under his gaze . But beneath his restraint and calm it was possible to detect a resolution , a will , set now with unalterable tenacity , which made such turns of speech as Mr. Hilbery had at command appear oddly irrelevant . At any rate , he said nothing . He respected the young man ; he was a very able young man ; he was likely to get his own way . He could , he thought , looking at his still and very dignified head , understand Katharine ’s preference , and , as he thought this , he was surprised by a pang of acute jealousy . She might have married Rodney without causing him a twinge . This man she loved . Or what was the state of affairs between them ? An extraordinary confusion of emotion was beginning to get the better of him , when Mrs. Hilbery , who had been conscious of a sudden pause in the conversation , and had looked wistfully at her daughter once or twice , remarked : “
198898	198899	198896	198896	Ralph	154	” “
198904	198992	198900	198900	We	2894	” said Katharine , waking with a start , and looking straight at her father . He was taken aback by the directness of the statement ; he exclaimed as if an unexpected blow had struck him . Had he loved her to see her swept away by this torrent , to have her taken from him by this uncontrollable force , to stand by helpless , ignored ? Oh , how he loved her ! How he loved her ! He nodded very curtly to Denham . “
199002	199006	198993	198993	I	0	” he said . “
199014	199344	199007	199007	I	0	” But he never looked at his daughter , and strode out of the room , leaving in the minds of the women a sense , half of awe , half of amusement , at the extravagant , inconsiderate , uncivilized male , outraged somehow and gone bellowing to his lair with a roar which still sometimes reverberates in the most polished of drawing - rooms . Then Katharine , looking at the shut door , looked down again , to hide her tears . The lamps were lit ; their luster reflected itself in the polished wood ; good wine was passed round the dinner - table ; before the meal was far advanced civilization had triumphed , and Mr. Hilbery presided over a feast which came to wear more and more surely an aspect , cheerful , dignified , promising well for the future . To judge from the expression in Katharine ’s eyes it promised something — but he checked the approach sentimentality . He poured out wine ; he bade Denham help himself . They went upstairs and he saw Katharine and Denham abstract themselves directly Cassandra had asked whether she might not play him something — some Mozart ? some Beethoven ? She sat down to the piano ; the door closed softly behind them . His eyes rested on the closed door for some seconds unwaveringly , but , by degrees , the look of expectation died out of them , and , with a sigh , he listened to the music . Katharine and Ralph were agreed with scarcely a word of discussion as to what they wished to do , and in a moment she joined him in the hall dressed for walking . The night was still and moonlit , fit for walking , though any night would have seemed so to them , desiring more than anything movement , freedom from scrutiny , silence , and the open air . “
199348	199615	199007	199007	I	0	” she breathed , as the front door shut . She told him how she had waited , fidgeted , thought he was never coming , listened for the sound of doors , half expected to see him again under the lamp - post , looking at the house . They turned and looked at the serene front with its gold - rimmed windows , to him the shrine of so much adoration . In spite of her laugh and the little pressure of mockery on his arm , he would not resign his belief , but with her hand resting there , her voice quickened and mysteriously moving in his ears , he had not time — they had not the same inclination — other objects drew his attention . How they came to find themselves walking down a street with many lamps , corners radiant with light , and a steady succession of motor - omnibuses plying both ways along it , they could neither of them tell ; nor account for the impulse which led them suddenly to select one of these wayfarers and mount to the very front seat . After curving through streets of comparative darkness , so narrow that shadows on the blinds were pressed within a few feet of their faces , they came to one of those great knots of activity where the lights , having drawn close together , thin out again and take their separate ways . They were borne on until they saw the spires of the city churches pale and flat against the sky . “
199620	199631	199617	199617	you	2897	” he asked , as they stopped by Temple Bar . “
199638	199757	199634	199634	I	0	” she replied , becoming conscious that the splendid race of lights drawn past her eyes by the superb curving and swerving of the monster on which she sat was at an end . They had followed some such course in their thoughts too ; they had been borne on , victors in the forefront of some triumphal car , spectators of a pageant enacted for them , masters of life . But standing on the pavement alone , this exaltation left them ; they were glad to be alone together . Ralph stood still for a moment to light his pipe beneath a lamp . She looked at his face isolated in the little circle of light . “
199763	199767	199768	199768	We	2899	” she said . “
199776	199777	199634	199634	I	0	” “
199783	199787	199634	199634	I	0	” he inquired . “
199792	199845	199789	199789	you	2900	” she replied . She thought , looking at the sky above Chancery Lane , how the roof was the same everywhere ; how she was now secure of all that this lofty blue and its steadfast lights meant to her ; reality , was it , figures , love , truth ? “
199853	199858	199846	199846	I	0	” said Ralph abruptly . “
199885	199968	199878	199878	you	2900	” She had turned before she answered him . She had no wish to see any one to - night ; it seemed to her that the immense riddle was answered ; the problem had been solved ; she held in her hands for one brief moment the globe which we spend our lives in trying to shape , round , whole , and entire from the confusion of chaos . To see Mary was to risk the destruction of this globe . “
199975	199984	199970	199970	you	0	” she asked rather mechanically , walking on . “
199990	199997	199985	199985	I	0	” he said , almost defiantly . “
200019	200023	200010	200010	I	0	” he said . “
200030	200031	200024	200024	I	0	” “
200040	200077	200035	200035	you	0	” said Katharine , and now felt anxious for him to do what appeared to be necessary if he , too , were to hold his globe for a moment round , whole , and entire . “
200084	200115	200081	200081	I	0	” she sighed , for melancholy came over her and obscured at least a section of her clear vision . The globe swam before her as if obscured by tears . “
200120	200173	200116	200116	I	0	” said Ralph firmly . She leant towards him almost as if she could thus see what he saw . She thought how obscure he still was to her , save only that more and more constantly he appeared to her a fire burning through its smoke , a source of life . “
200177	200181	200182	200182	You	0	” she said . “
200186	200187	200182	200182	You	0	” “
200192	200196	200182	200182	You	0	” he repeated . “
200201	200245	200182	200182	You	0	” she thought to herself . She thought of him blazing splendidly in the night , yet so obscure that to hold his arm , as she held it , was only to touch the opaque substance surrounding the flame that roared upwards . “
200249	200280	200182	200182	You	0	” she asked hurriedly , in order that he might say more and so make more splendid , more red , more darkly intertwined with smoke this flame rushing upwards . “
200289	200304	200283	200283	you	2904	” he asked suspiciously , noticing her tone of dreaminess and the inapt words . “
200358	200406	200350	200350	me	0	” Beginning with spasmodic words , he went on to speak more and more fluently , more and more passionately , feeling her leaning towards him , listening with wonder like a child , with gratitude like a woman . She interrupted him gravely now and then . “
200434	200460	200428	200428	you	2904	” He capped her reproof with wonderment that a woman of her age could have stood in Kingsway looking at the traffic until she forgot . “
200472	200476	200465	200465	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
200483	200488	200465	200465	I	0	” he begged her . “
200501	200505	200491	200491	I	0	” she pleaded . “
200526	200837	200520	200520	I	0	” But he persuaded her into a broken statement , beautiful to him , charged with extreme excitement as she spoke of the dark red fire , and the smoke twined round it , making him feel that he had stepped over the threshold into the faintly lit vastness of another mind , stirring with shapes , so large , so dim , unveiling themselves only in flashes , and moving away again into the darkness , engulfed by it . They had walked by this time to the street in which Mary lived , and being engrossed by what they said and partly saw , passed her staircase without looking up . At this time of night there was no traffic and scarcely any foot - passengers , so that they could pace slowly without interruption , arm - in - arm , raising their hands now and then to draw something upon the vast blue curtain of the sky . They brought themselves by these means , acting on a mood of profound happiness , to a state of clear - sightedness where the lifting of a finger had effect , and one word spoke more than a sentence . They lapsed gently into silence , traveling the dark paths of thought side by side towards something discerned in the distance which gradually possessed them both . They were victors , masters of life , but at the same time absorbed in the flame , giving their life to increase its brightness , to testify to their faith . Thus they had walked , perhaps , twice or three times up and down Mary Datchet ’s street before the recurrence of a light burning behind a thin , yellow blind caused them to stop without exactly knowing why they did so . It burned itself into their minds . “
200847	200851	200520	200520	I	0	” said Ralph . “
200858	200872	200852	200852	She	175	” He pointed across the street . Katharine ’s eyes rested there too . “
200890	200894	200886	200886	she	175	” she wondered . “
200901	200906	200897	200897	we	2908	” she asked passionately . “
200920	200924	200925	200925	She	175	” she added . “
200930	200949	200950	200950	You	2909	” Her voice shook slightly , and the light swam like an ocean of gold behind her tears . “
200960	200964	200950	200950	You	2909	” Ralph asked . “
200977	201082	200974	200974	you	0	” she replied . He crossed the road immediately , and went up the steps into Mary ’s house . Katharine stood where he left her , looking at the window and expecting soon to see a shadow move across it ; but she saw nothing ; the blinds conveyed nothing ; the light was not moved . It signaled to her across the dark street ; it was a sign of triumph shining there for ever , not to be extinguished this side of the grave . She brandished her happiness as if in salute ; she dipped it as if in reverence . “
201087	201147	201148	201148	I	0	” she thought , and all the darkness of London seemed set with fires , roaring upwards ; but her eyes came back to Mary ’s window and rested there satisfied . She had waited some time before a figure detached itself from the doorway and came across the road , slowly and reluctantly , to where she stood . “
201160	201286	201148	201148	I	0	” he broke off . He had stood outside Mary ’s door unable to bring himself to knock ; if she had come out she would have found him there , the tears running down his cheeks , unable to speak . They stood for some moments , looking at the illuminated blinds , an expression to them both of something impersonal and serene in the spirit of the woman within , working out her plans far into the night — her plans for the good of a world that none of them were ever to know . Then their minds jumped on and other little figures came by in procession , headed , in Ralph ’s view , by the figure of Sally Seal . “
201293	201302	201290	201291	Sally Seal	200	” he asked . Katharine bent her head . “
201308	201313	201290	201291	Sally Seal	200	” he went on . “
201324	201391	201318	201319	Old Joan	156	” He stopped in his enumeration , not finding it possible to link them together in any way that should explain the queer combination which he could perceive in them , as he thought of them . They appeared to him to be more than individuals ; to be made up of many different things in cohesion ; he had a vision of an orderly world . “
201404	201970	201318	201319	Old Joan	156	” Katherine quoted , remembering some words of Sally Seal ’s , and wishing Ralph to understand that she followed the track of his thought . She felt him trying to piece together in a laborious and elementary fashion fragments of belief , unsoldered and separate , lacking the unity of phrases fashioned by the old believers . Together they groped in this difficult region , where the unfinished , the unfulfilled , the unwritten , the unreturned , came together in their ghostly way and wore the semblance of the complete and the satisfactory . The future emerged more splendid than ever from this construction of the present . Books were to be written , and since books must be written in rooms , and rooms must have hangings , and outside the windows there must be land , and an horizon to that land , and trees perhaps , and a hill , they sketched a habitation for themselves upon the outline of great offices in the Strand and continued to make an account of the future upon the omnibus which took them towards Chelsea ; and still , for both of them , it swam miraculously in the golden light of a large steady lamp . As the night was far advanced they had the whole of the seats on the top of the omnibus to choose from , and the roads , save for an occasional couple , wearing even at midnight , an air of sheltering their words from the public , were deserted . No longer did the shadow of a man sing to the shadow of a piano . A few lights in bedroom windows burnt but were extinguished one by one as the omnibus passed them . They dismounted and walked down to the river . She felt his arm stiffen beneath her hand , and knew by this token that they had entered the enchanted region . She might speak to him , but with that strange tremor in his voice , those eyes blindly adoring , whom did he answer ? What woman did he see ? And where was she walking , and who was her companion ? Moments , fragments , a second of vision , and then the flying waters , the winds dissipating and dissolving ; then , too , the recollection from chaos , the return of security , the earth firm , superb and brilliant in the sun . From the heart of his darkness he spoke his thanksgiving ; from a region as far , as hidden , she answered him . On a June night the nightingales sing , they answer each other across the plain ; they are heard under the window among the trees in the garden . Pausing , they looked down into the river which bore its dark tide of waters , endlessly moving , beneath them . They turned and found themselves opposite the house . Quietly they surveyed the friendly place , burning its lamps either in expectation of them or because Rodney was still there talking to Cassandra . Katharine pushed the door half open and stood upon the threshold . The light lay in soft golden grains upon the deep obscurity of the hushed and sleeping household . For a moment they waited , and then loosed their hands . “
201974	201978	201983	201983	she	2912	” he breathed . “
