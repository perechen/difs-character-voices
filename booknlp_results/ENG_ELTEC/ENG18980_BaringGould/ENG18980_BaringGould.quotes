616	626	628	628	Plancus	182	“ Like the wave in my lady ’s hair , ”
630	633	635	635	Duilia	181	“ Abominable ! ”
637	659	635	635	Duilia	181	“ when the ripple in my hair is natural and abiding , and that in the water is made and disappears . ”
660	678	590	591	the lady	482	“ Because , Mistress , the wavelets look up , see , and fall back in despair . ”
679	684	686	687	the lady	482	“ That is better , ”
689	707	686	687	the lady	482	“ And the swelling sail , like your divine bosom , has fallen , as when — — ”
708	754	590	591	the lady	482	“ Ugh ! I should hope the texture of my skin was not like coarse sail - cloth ; get behind me , Plancus . Here , Lucilla , how am I looking ? I would have my lord see me to the best advantage . ”
755	758	760	762	the female slave	487	“ Madam , ”
766	799	760	762	the female slave	487	“ the envious sun is about to hide his head in the west . He can not endure , after having feasted on your beauty , to surrender it to a mortal . ”
800	812	814	814	Duilia	181	“ Is not one eyebrow a trifle higher than the other ? ”
827	861	818	818	herself	181	“ It is indeed so , lady , but has not the Paphian Goddess in the statue of Phidias the same characteristic ? Defect it is not , but a token of divinity . ”
862	865	867	867	Duilia	181	“ Ah , ”
869	894	867	867	Duilia	181	“ it is hereditary . The Julian race descends from Venus Genetrix , and I have the blood of the immortal ancestress in me . ”
895	899	901	901	Plancus	182	“ Much diluted , ”
925	930	932	933	the lady	482	“ By the way , ”
935	1004	932	933	the lady	482	“ the stay in this place Cenchræa is positively intolerable . No society , only a set of merchants — rich and all that sort of thing — but nobodies . The villa we occupy is undignified and uncomfortable . The noise of the port , the caterwauling of sailors , and the smell of pitch are most distasteful to me . My lord will hardly tarry here ? ”
1005	1009	1011	1012	the freedman	489	“ My lord , ”
1017	1064	1011	1012	the freedman	489	“ he who subdued the Parthians , and chained the Armenians , to whom all Syria bowed , arrives to cast himself at your ladyship ’s feet , and be led by you as a captive in your triumphal entry into the capital of the world . ”
1065	1072	1073	1073	She	490	“ You think so , Plancus . ”
1078	1099	1073	1073	She	490	“ He is an obstinate man — pig - headed — I — I mean resolute in his own line . ”
1100	1110	932	933	the lady	482	“ Madam , I know you to be irresistible . ”
1111	1131	932	933	the lady	482	“ Well , I desire to leave this odious place . I have yawned here through three entire months . ”
1132	1153	1073	1073	She	490	“ And during these months , the temple of Aphrodite has been deserted , and the approaches grass - grown . ”
1154	1165	1167	1167	Lucilla	183	“ How would my Lady like to remove to Corinth ? ”
1169	1191	1167	1167	Lucilla	183	“ The vessel will be taken to Diolcus , and there placed on rollers , to be drawn across the isthmus . ”
1192	1313	932	933	the lady	482	“ Oh ! Corinth will be noisier than this place , and more vulgar , because more pretentious . Only money - lending Jews there . Besides , I have taken an aversion to the place since the death of my physician . As the Gods love me , I not see the good of a medical attendant who is so ignorant as to allow himself to die , and that at such an inconvenient moment as the present . By the Great Goddess ! what impostors there be . To think that for years I committed the care of my precious health to his bungling hands ! Plancus , have you secured another ? I suffer frightfully at sea . ”
1314	1323	1325	1326	the steward	491	“ A sure token of your divine origin , ”
1328	1352	1325	1326	the steward	491	“ The Foam - born ( Venus ) rose out of and left the waves because the motion of them disagreed with her . ”
1353	1362	1364	1365	Longa Duilia	181	“ There is a good deal in that , ”
1367	1399	1364	1365	Longa Duilia	181	“ Plancus , have you secured another ? I positively can not across Adria without one to hold my head and supply anti — anti — what do you call them ? ”
1400	1403	1405	1406	the freedman	489	“ Madam , ”
1413	1453	1405	1406	the freedman	489	“ I have devoted my energies to your service . I have gone about with a lantern seeking an honest physician . I may not have been as successful as I desired , but I have done my utmost . ”
1454	1519	1364	1365	Longa Duilia	181	“ I prithee — have done with this rodomontade and to the point . Have you secured one ? As the Gods love me ! it is not only one ’s insides that get upset at sea , but one ’s outside also becomes so tousled and tumbled — that the repairs — but never mind about them . Have you engaged a man ? ”
1520	1572	1405	1406	the freedman	489	“ Yes , my Lady , I have lighted on one Luke , a physician of Troas ; he is desirous of proceeding to Rome , and is willing to undertake the charge of your health , in return for being conveyed to the capital of the world at your charges . ”
1573	1582	1584	1585	Longa Duilia	181	“ I make you responsible for his suitability , ”
1587	1592	1593	1593	she	181	“ Body of Bacchus ! ”

1648	1716	1717	1717	Duilia	181	“ Where is she ? What has become of her ? As the Gods love me — you are a pack of fools . The more of you there are , so much the more of folly . You have let her gallop off among the odious sailors , and she will come back rank with pitch . Lucilla , Favonia , Syra , where is she ? ”
1733	1761	1725	1725	her	181	“ I never met with such a child anywhere , it is the Corbulo blood in her , not mine . The Gods forbid ! O Morals ! ”
1762	1765	1767	1770	a slave - girl	493	“ Madam , ”
1774	1781	1767	1770	a slave - girl	493	“ I saw her with Eboracus . ”
1782	1812	1813	1814	The slaves	494	“ Well , and where is Eboracus . They are always together . He spoils the child , and she pays him too much consideration . Where are they ? ”
1826	1829	1831	1831	Plancus	182	“ Perhaps , ”
1833	1853	1831	1831	Plancus	182	“ she has gone to the altar of Poseidon to offer there thanks for the return of her father . ”
1854	1921	1922	1922	She	496	“ Poseidon , nonsense ! That is not her way . She has been in a fever ever since the vessel has been sighted , her cheeks flaming and in a fidget as if covered with flying ants . Find the girl . If any harm shall have come to her through your neglect , I will have you all flayed — and hang the cost ! ”
1957	1970	1972	1976	the alarmed and irritated mother	498	“ You are a parcel of idle , empty - headed fools , ”
1978	2038	1972	1976	the alarmed and irritated mother	498	“ I will have the child found , and that instantly . You girls , you have been gaping , watching the sailors , and have not had an eye on your young mistress , and no concern for my feelings . There is no more putting anything into your heads than of filling the sieves of the Danaides . ”
2039	2042	2044	2044	Plancus	182	“ Madam , ”
2056	2108	2044	2044	Plancus	182	“ you may rest satisfied that no harm has befallen the young lady . So long as Eboracus is with her , she is safe . That Briton worships her . He would suffer himself to be torn limb from limb rather than allow the least ill to come to her . ”
2109	2114	2116	2117	the lady	482	“ Well , well , ”
2120	2132	2116	2117	the lady	482	“ we expect all that sort of thing of our slaves . ”
2133	2143	2044	2044	Plancus	182	“ Madam , but do we always get it ? ”
2144	2170	2044	2044	Plancus	182	“ We ! The Gods save me ! How you talk . We ! We , indeed . Pray what are you to expect anything ? ”
2171	2178	2181	2182	the steward	491	“ The other day , lady , ”
2192	2221	2181	2182	the steward	491	“ The other day , Eboracus nigh on killed a man who looked with an insolent leer at his young mistress . He is like a faithful Molossus . ”
2222	2232	2234	2237	the still ruffled lady	501	“ I do not ask what he is like , ”
2239	2246	2234	2237	the still ruffled lady	501	“ I ask where she is . ”
2262	2321	2322	2323	Longa Duilia	181	steward:—“If it may please you , sir , will you graciously report to my Lady that I observed the young mistress draw Eboracus aside , and whisper to him , as though urging somewhat , and he seemed to demur , but he finally appeared to yield to her persuasions , and they strolled together along the mole . ”
2348	2371	2346	2346	She	181	sharply:—“Why did not the fellow mention this before ? Give him thirty lashes . Where did they go , did he say ? ”
2372	2377	2346	2346	She	181	“ Along the mole . ”
2378	2382	2346	2346	She	181	“ Which mole ? ”
2383	2402	2346	2346	She	181	“ Madam , Carpentarius is afraid of extending his communication lest he increase the number of his lashes . ”
2403	2408	2410	2411	the mistress	507	“ Well , well ! ”
2413	2424	2410	2411	the mistress	507	“ We may remit the lashes — let him answer . ”
2425	2428	2430	2431	the steward	491	“ Carpentarius , ”
2433	2469	2430	2431	the steward	491	“ Her ladyship , out of the superabundance of her compassion , will let you off the thirty lashes , if you say where be Eboracus and the young lady , your mistress Domitia Longina . ”
2470	2473	2475	2476	the porter	509	“ Sir , ”
2478	2512	2475	2476	the porter	509	“ that I can not answer positively ; but — unless my eyes deceive me , I see a small boat on the water , within it a rower and a young girl . ”
2513	2523	2525	2525	Plancus	182	“ By the Immortal Brothers ! he is right , ”
2527	2586	2525	2525	Plancus	182	“ See , lady , yonder is a cockle boat , that has been unmoored from the mole , and there be in it a rower , burly , broadbacked , who is certainly the Briton , and in the bow is as it were a silver dove — and that can be none other than your daughter . ”
2587	2594	2596	2596	Duilia	181	“ As the Gods love me , ”
2605	2670	2596	2596	Duilia	181	“ what indelicacy ! It is even so , the child is besotted . She dotes on her father , whom she has not seen since we left Antioch . And she has actually gone to meet him . O Venus Kalypyge ! What are we coming to , when children act in this independent , indecent manner . O Times ! O Morals ! ”
3053	3064	3049	3050	the father	517	“ My darling , hast thou no word for Lucius ? ”
3065	3072	3073	3074	The father	517	“ Lamia ! He is here ? ”
3127	3141	3101	3101	He	530	“ Domitia , you have not forgotten your old playmate , have you ? ”
3164	3169	3171	3171	Corbulo	204	“ Nay , nay ! ”
3173	3186	3171	3171	Corbulo	204	“ A gentler , kinder greeting , after so long a separation . ”
3213	3248	3206	3206	She	3790	“ You will not be angry if I give all my thoughts and words and looks to my father now . When we come on shore , he will be swallowed up by others . ”
3253	3259	3260	3260	she	3790	“ Do not be offended , ”
3278	3345	3260	3260	she	3790	“ I have not indeed been without thought of you , Lucius , but have spun and spun and weaved too , enough to make you a tunic , all with my own hands , and a purple clavus — it nigh ruined me , the dyed Tyrian wool cost — I will not say ; but I wove little crossed L ’s into the texture . ”
3346	3349	3351	3351	Corbulo	204	“ What , ”
3353	3359	3351	3351	Corbulo	204	“ For Lucius and Longina ? ”
3371	3377	3379	3379	he	204	“ That could not be , ”
3381	3427	3379	3379	he	204	“ for Longina and Lucius are never across , but alack ! Lucius is often so with Lamia , when he has done some stupid thing and he sees a frown on his all but father ’s face , but hears no word of reproach . ”
3428	3432	3434	3434	Corbulo	204	“ My boy , ”
3436	3458	3434	3434	Corbulo	204	“ when a man knows his own faults , then a reprimand is unnecessary , and what is unnecessary is wrong . ”
3545	3552	3553	3553	he	3788	“ Not yet , my daughter , ”
3556	3563	3553	3553	he	3788	“ the goddess must precede thee . ”
3742	3786	3738	3738	he	3788	“ The Goddess Aphrodite of Corinth salutes her divine sister , the Many - Breasted Artemis of Ephesus , and welcomes her . And she further prays that she may not smite the city or the port with fire , pestilence or earthquake . ”
3837	3969	3825	3831	the foam - born goddess of Beauty	567	“ We who come from the sea , having safely traversed the Ægean , escaped rocks and sand - banks , whirlpools and storms , under the protection of the great goddess of Ephesus , salute in her name the goddess of Beauty , and receive her welcome with thankfulness . And great Artemis beseeches her sister to suffer her and the vessel with passengers and goods and crew , that she conducts and protects , to pass across the isthmus , without let and molestation ; and she for her part undertakes to pay the accustomed toll , and the due to the temple of Aphrodite , and that neither the passengers nor the crew shall in any way injure or disturb the inhabitants of Corinth or of the Isthmus . ”

4492	4516	4472	4472	his	606	“ And pray , what has the profundity of Ascletarion alias Elymas beheld in the bottom of that well he terms his soul ? ”
4517	4549	4472	4472	his	606	“ He has been able to see what is hidden from the shallowness of Claudius Senecio alias Spermologos over the surface of which shallowness his soul careers like a water spider . ”
4550	4558	4472	4472	his	606	“ And that is , O muddiness ? ”

4568	4601	4472	4472	his	606	“ Why so?—not , the Gods forfend , that I lay any weight on anything you may say . But I like to hear your vaticinations that I may laugh over them . ”
4602	4644	4472	4472	his	606	“ Hear , then . Because a daughter of Earth dared to set foot on the vessel consecrated to and conducted by Artemis before that the tutelary goddess had been welcomed by and had saluted the tutelary deity of the land . ”

5712	5751	5710	5710	he	204	“ I pray you desist . It was for this that I sent you back from Antioch . You ever twanged one string , and I felt that your words , if overheard , might endanger us all . ”
5752	5760	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ I speak but into thine ear . ”

5825	5828	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ What ! ”
5833	5870	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ art thou so blind as not to see what is obvious to every other eye , that the Roman people are impatient at having a buffoon , a mimic , a fiddler wearing the purple ? ”
5871	5884	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Nevertheless , he wears it , by favor of the gods . ”
5885	6081	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ For how long ? Domitius , believe me . In the heart of every Roman citizen rage is simmering , and the wound of injured pride rankles . He has insulted the majesty of eternal Rome . After having acted the buffoon in Italy , running up and down it like a jester on a tight - rope mouthing at the people , and with his assassins scattered about below to cut them down if they do not applaud — then he comes here also into Greece , to act on stages , race chariots , before Greeks — Greeks of all people ! To me this is nothing , for all princes are tyrants more or less , and so long as they do not prick me , I care not . But here it does come close . In every army , in the breast of every soldier , rebellion springs up . Every general is uneasy and looks at the face of every other and asks , Who will draw the sword and make an end of this ? O Morals ! it makes me mad to see you alone quiescent . ”
6082	6097	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ When the Gods will a change , then the change will be granted . ”
6098	6141	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ You speak like a philosopher and not a man of action . If you do not draw , others will forestall you , and then — instead of my being up at the top — I shall be down in Nowhere . ”
6142	6158	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Never will I be a traitor to Rome , and go against my oath . ”
6159	6172	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Pshaw ! They all do it , so why not you ? ”
6173	6182	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Because my conscience will not suffer me . ”
6183	6314	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Conscience ! The haruspices have never found it yet . They can discover and read the liver and the kidneys , but no knife has yet laid bare a conscience as big as a bean . You were the darling of the soldiery in Germany . You are still the idol of those who have fought under you in Parthia and Armenia . I am sure I did my best to push your cause . I was gracious to the soldiery — sent tit - bits from the table to the guard . I tipped right and left , till I spent all my pocket - money , and smiled benignantly on all military men till I got a horrible crumple here in my cheek , do you see ? ”
6315	6320	6322	6322	Corbulo	204	“ Yes , shocking , ”
6326	6334	6336	6336	Duilia	181	“ How can you be so provoking ! ”
6339	6408	6336	6336	Duilia	181	“ Of course there is no wrinkle , there might have been , I did so much smiling . Really , Corbulo , one has to do all the picking — as boys get winkles out of their shells with a pin — to extract a compliment from you . And out comes the pin with nothing at the end . Plancus would not have let that pass . ”
6409	6418	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Do you say that Nero is here ? ”
6419	6482	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Yes , here , in Greece ; here at our elbow , at Corinth . He has for once got a clever idea into his head and has begun to cut a canal through the isthmus . It has begun with a flourish of trumpets and a dinner and a dramatic exhibition — and then I warrant you it will end . ”
6483	6489	6336	6336	Duilia	181	“ The Prince at Corinth ! ”
6490	6567	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Yes , at Corinth ; and you are here with all the wide sea between you and your troops . And docile as a lamb you have come here , and left your vantage ground . What it all means , the Gods know . It is no doing of mine . I warned and exhorted at Antioch , but you might have been born deaf for all the attention you paid to my words . ”
6568	6582	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Never would I raise my sacrilegious hand against Rome — my mother . ”
6583	6607	6336	6336	Duilia	181	“ Nay — it is Rome that cries out to be rid of a man that makes her the scorn of the world . ”
6608	6623	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ She has not spoken . She has not released me of my oath . ”
6624	6695	5830	5831	Longa Duilia	181	“ Because her mouth is gagged . As the Gods love me , they say that the god Caius ( Caligula ) named his horse Consul . Rome may have a monkey as her prince and Augustus for aught I care , were it not that by such a chance the handle is offered for you to upset him and seat yourself and me at the head of the universe . ”
6696	6702	6704	6705	the general	683	“ No more of this , ”
6707	6721	6722	6722	he	683	“ A good soldier obeys his commander . And I have an imperator , ”
6727	6748	6722	6722	he	683	“ a good conscience , and I go nowhere , undertake nothing which is not ordered by my master there . ”
6749	6759	6765	6765	Corbulo	204	“ Then I wash my hands of the result . ”
6760	6764	6765	6765	Corbulo	204	“ Come hither ! ”
6820	6887	6817	6817	he	204	“ Domitia , I have not said one grave word to thee since we have been together . Yet now will I do this . None can tell what may be the next turn up of the die . And this that I am about to say comes warm and salt from my heart , like the spring hard by , at the Bath of Helene . ”
6888	6894	6896	6897	the girl	3790	“ And strong , father , ”
6906	6931	6817	6817	he	204	“ So strong is the spring that at once it turns a mill , ere rushing down to find its rest in the sea . ”
6932	6995	6817	6817	he	204	“ Well , and so may what I say so turn and make thee active , dear child,—active for good , though homely the work may be as that of grinding flour . When you have done a good work , and not wasted the volume of life in froth and cascade , then find rest in the wide sea of — — ”
6996	7000	7002	7002	Duilia	181	“ Of what ? ”
7004	7014	7002	7002	Duilia	181	“ say it out — of nobody knows what . ”
7015	7031	6817	6817	he	204	“ That which thou sayest , dearest father , will not sleep in my heart . ”
7032	7091	6817	6817	he	204	“ Domitia , when we sail at sea , we direct our course by the stars . Without the stars we should not know whither to steer . And the steering of the vessel by the stars , that is seamanship . So in life . There are principles of right and wrong set in the firmament — — ”
7092	7095	7097	7097	Duilia	181	“ Where ? ”
7099	7111	7097	7097	Duilia	181	“ As the Gods love me , I never saw them . ”
7112	7116	7118	7118	Corbulo	204	“ By them , ”
7124	7160	7118	7118	Corbulo	204	“ we must shape our course , and this true shaping of our course , and not drifting with tides , or blown hither and thither by winds — this is the seamanship of life . ”
7161	7166	7168	7168	Duilia	181	“ By the Gods ! ”
7170	7229	7168	7168	Duilia	181	“ You must first find your stars . I hold what you say to be rank nonsense . Where are your stars ? Principles ! You keep your constellations in the hold of your vessel . My good Corbulo , our own interest , that we can always see , and by that we ought ever to steer . ”
7230	7233	7235	7236	the girl	3790	“ Father , ”
7238	7266	7235	7236	the girl	3790	“ I see a centurion and a handful of soldiers coming this way — and , if I mistake not , Lamia is speeding ahead of them . ”
7267	7288	7289	7289	She	3790	“ Well , go then , and play with the kid . Hear how the little creature bleats after thee . ”
7319	7439	7315	7315	he	688	“ Now about the future of Domitia . I wish her no better fortune than to become the wife of Lucius Ælius Lamia , whom I love as my son . He has been in and out among us at Antioch . He returns with me to Rome . In these evil times , for a girl there is one only chance — to be given a good husband . This I hold , that a woman is never bad unless man shows her the way . If , as you say , there be no stars in the sky — there is love in the heart . By Hercules ! here comes Lamia , and something ails him . ”
7484	7491	7493	7495	the old general	691	“ You would speak with me , ”
7529	7537	7519	7519	Corbulo	204	“ Farewell . I am rightly served . ”
7610	7631	7594	7594	he	204	“ Bid her from me — as my last command — Follow the Light where and when she sees it . ”
8268	8275	8247	8247	She	191	“ What ails you , Lucius ? ”
8276	8289	8291	8291	he	219	“ Come , sit by me on the margin of the basin , ”
8293	8320	8291	8291	he	219	“ By the Gods ! I conjure thee to summon all thy fortitude . I have news to communicate , and they of the saddest — — ”
8321	8361	8247	8247	She	191	“ What ! are we not to return to Rome ? O Lamia , I was a child when I left it , but I love our house at Gabii , and the lake there , and the garden . ”
8362	8371	8372	8372	He	219	“ It is worse than that , Domitia . ”
8407	8443	8392	8392	his	219	“ Domitia , you belong to an ancient race . You are a Roman , and have the blood of the Gods in your veins . So nerve thy heroic soul to hear the worst . ”
8487	8532	8453	8453	his	219	“ Why , how now , Lamia ? Thou art descended by adoption from the Earth - shakes , and tremblest as a girl ! See — a tear fell into the basin . Oh , Lucius ! My very kid rears in surprise . ”
8533	8555	8556	8556	Domitia	191	“ Do not mock . Prepare for the worst . Think what would be the sorest ill that could befall thee . ”
8582	8586	8579	8579	his	219	“ My father ? ”
8684	8734	8735	8735	She	191	“ Come back ! O Cnæus ! Come , thou mighty warrior ! Come , thou pillar of thy race ! Come back , thou shadow ! Return , O fleeted soul ! See , see ! thy tabernacle is still warm . Return , O soul ! return ! ”
9085	9097	9076	9076	Lamia	219	“ Come away , Domitia . You can not prevent Fate . ”
9126	9131	9099	9099	she	764	“ Who slew him ? ”
9132	9140	9099	9099	she	764	“ He fell on his own sword . ”
9141	9148	9099	9099	she	764	“ Why ! He was happy ? ”
10029	10032	10034	10034	he	535	“ Domitia ! ”
10048	10051	10036	10036	She	3790	“ Lucius ! ”
10065	10148	10057	10057	she	3790	“ There is one thing I desire of thee . By some means or other , I care not what , bring me into the presence of the monster . I know how my father has come by his death — as have so many others , the best and the noblest . I have but one ambition on earth , I see but a single duty before me — to drive if it be but a silver bodkin into his heart . ”
10149	10152	10057	10057	she	3790	“ Domitia ! ”
10153	10201	10057	10057	she	3790	“ Lucius , the last words my father used to me were to bid me look to the stars and to sail by them . I look and I see one only star . I feel but one only duty on earth — to revenge his death . ”
10202	10206	10208	10208	Lamia	219	“ My friend ! ”
10215	10236	10208	10208	Lamia	219	“ Be careful of thy words . If overheard , they might cause your blood to be mingled with his . ”
10237	10242	10057	10057	she	3790	“ I care not . ”
10243	10251	10057	10057	she	3790	“ But to me it matters sovereignly . ”
10252	10261	10208	10208	Lamia	219	“ Why ? Dost thou care for me ? ”
10262	10269	10057	10057	she	3790	“ Above all in the world . ”
10270	10275	10057	10057	she	3790	“ Then revenge me . ”
10276	10346	10208	10208	Lamia	219	“ Domitia , my grief is little less than thine . If you would revenge the loss , so would I. But what can be done ? He , the coward , is carefully guarded . None are suffered to approach him who have not first been searched , and even then are not allowed within arm ’s length . Nothing can be done , save invoke the Gods . ”
10347	10351	10353	10354	the girl	3790	“ The Gods ! ”
10357	10444	10353	10354	the girl	3790	“ The Gods ! They set up the base , the foul , and crown him with roses , and trample the noble and good into the earth . The Gods ! see you now ! They set a star in heaven , they grave a duty in my heart , and the star is unattainable , and the duty , they make impossible of achievement . Bah ! There is no star . There are no duties on earth , and no Gods in heaven . ”
10445	10468	10470	10473	the lady Longa Duilia	816	“ It is of no use in the world , Plancus , your attempting to reason me out of a fixed resolve , ”
10477	10487	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ My Corbulo shall not have a shabby funeral . ”
10488	10497	10499	10500	the steward	491	“ Madam , I do not suggest that , ”
10507	10624	10499	10500	the steward	491	“ Yes , you do . It is of no good your standing on one leg like a stork . Shabby it must be — no ancestors present . As the Gods love me , you would not have me borrow ancestors of Asclepiades , our client , who has lent us this villa ! He may have them or not , that is no concern of mine . Will you have done preening yourself like an old cockroach . I say it would be an indignity to have a funeral for my Corbulo without ancestors . O Times ! O Morals ! What is the good of having ancestors if you do not use them ? ”
10625	10647	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ But , Madam , they are in your palace at Rome in the Carinæ — or at the Gabian villa . ”
10648	10709	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ And for that reason they are not here . Without the attendance of his forbears , my Corbulo shall not be buried . Besides , who is there to impress here with the solemnity ? Only a lot of wretched sailors , ship sutlers , Jew pedlers and petty officials , not worth considering . I have said it . ”
10710	10722	10499	10500	the steward	491	“ But , Lady , Lucius Lamia agrees with me — — ”
10723	10751	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ Lucius Ælius Lamia — it will not exhaust your lungs to give him his name more fully — is not as yet one of the family . ”
10752	10776	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ Madam , consider how Agrippina did with Germanicus — she had his pyre at Antioch , and conveyed his ashes to Rome . ”
10777	10841	10499	10500	the steward	491	“ Agrippina was able to have the funeral conducted with solemn pomp at Antioch . There were the soldiers , the lictors , great officers and all that sort of thing . Here — nothing at all . By the Immortals — consider the expenses , and none to look on gaping but tarry sailors and Jew rag - and - bone men . ”
10842	10845	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ Madam ! ”
10846	10856	10472	10473	Longa Duilia	181	“ Silence . Without ancestors!—as impossible as without wood . ”
11195	11198	11200	11200	Plancus	182	“ That , ”
11202	11214	11200	11200	Plancus	182	“ hardly applies to one who has died out of Italy . ”
11215	11222	11224	11224	Duilia	181	“ It is against the law , ”
11226	11322	11224	11224	Duilia	181	“ I will give no occasion to objection , offer no handle to informers . Besides , I wo n’t have it . The respect I owe to Corbulo forbids the entertainment of such an idea . Really , and on my word , Plancus , I am not a child to be amused with shadow pictures , and unless you are making a rabbit , a fish , or a pig eating out of a trough , I can not conceive what you are about with your hands , fumbling one over the other . ”
11323	11332	11200	11200	Plancus	182	“ Madam , I had no thought — — ”
11333	11446	11224	11224	Duilia	181	“ I know you have none . Be pleased another time when addressing me to keep your hands quiet , it is irritating . One never knows where they are or will be , sometimes folding and unfolding them , then — they disappear up your sleeves and project none can guess where — like snails ’ horns . Be pleased,—and now pawing your face like a cat washing itself . Please in future hold them in front of you like a dog when sitting up , begging . But as to the funeral — I will not have it cheap and nasty . Without ancestors a funeral is not worth having . ”
11447	11450	11452	11454	the harassed freedman	834	“ Then , ”
11456	11468	11452	11454	the harassed freedman	834	“ there is nothing for it but to engage an embalmer . ”
11469	11487	11224	11224	Duilia	181	“ Of course — one can be obtained at Corinth . Everything can be had for money . ”
11498	11501	11503	11503	she	482	“ Here , ”
11505	11554	11503	11503	she	482	“ do not act like a fool , and let the man charge a fancy price . Say that I have an idea of pickling Corbulo in brine , and have brought an amphora large enough for the purpose . Do n’t close with his terms at once . ”
11575	11637	11565	11565	her	181	“ Lucilla ! The unfortunate feature of the situation is that I must not have my hair combed till we reach Gabii . It is customary , and for a bracelet of pearls I would not transgress custom . You can give my head a tousled look , without being dishevelled , I would wish to appear interesting , not untidy . ”
11638	11663	11565	11565	her	181	“ Lady ! Nothing could make you other than fascinating . A widow in tears — some stray locks — it would melt marble . ”
11664	11673	11675	11675	Duilia	181	“ And I think I shall outdo Agrippina , ”
11677	11749	11675	11675	Duilia	181	“ she carried her husband ’s cinders in an urn at the head of her berth and on appropriate occasions howled in the most tragic and charming manner . But I shall convey the unconsumed body of my Corbulo in state exposed on his bier , in his military accoutrements all the way to Rhegium , then up the coast to Ostia and so to Gabii . There will be talk ! ”
11750	11784	11820	11821	the lady	482	“ You will be cited in history as a widow the like of which the world has never seen . As for Agrippina , in your superior blaze she will be eclipsed forever . ”
11785	11818	11820	11821	the lady	482	“ I should prefer doing what Agrippina did — make a land journey from Brindisium , but — but — one must consider . It would be vastly expensive , and — — ”
11873	11876	11877	11877	she	482	“ No , ”
11880	11903	11877	11877	she	482	“ it would come too expensive . I will do what I can to honor my husband , but not ruin myself . ”
12766	12769	12771	12772	the mate	888	“ Sir , ”
12774	12862	12771	12772	the mate	888	“ my opinion is that we should make all speed across Adria . This is a bad season of the year . It is a month in which sailing is overpassed . We must take advantage of our chances . While the wind blows , let us spread sail . The rowers can ship their oars ; should the wind fail , or prove contrary , they will be required , and they may have a hard time of it . Therefore let them husband their strength . ”
12863	12868	12870	12871	Lucius Lamia	219	“ So be it , ”
13541	13589	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ The Summum Bonum , the crown and glory of Philosophy is to become in mind what the slave becomes after many bastinadoes , as callous in soul as he is on the soles of his feet . The lesson of life is not worth the acquisition . ”
13590	13600	14174	14175	The lady	482	“ I think he put it all very well . ”
13601	13628	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ Why are the strokes applied ? Why should we bear them without crying out ? After all , what profit is there in this philosophy ? ”
13629	13685	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ Really , my dear , I can not tell . But it is the correct thing to listen to and to talk philosophy , and good families keep their tame stoics,—even quite new and vulgar people , wretched knights who have become rich in trade — in a word , they all do it . ”
13686	13697	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ But , mother , what is this Highest Good ? ”
13698	13727	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ You must inquire of Claudius Senecio himself . It is , I am sure something very suitable to talk about , on such solemn occasions as this . ”
13728	13777	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ But what is it ? A runner in the course knows what is the prize for which he contends , a singer at the games sees the crown he hopes to earn — but this Highest Good , is it nothing but not to squeal when kicked ? ”
13778	13785	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ I really do not know . ”
13786	13882	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ Mother , would to the Gods I did know ! My sorrow is eating out my heart . I am miserable . I am in darkness , like Theseus in the labyrinth , but without a clue . And the Highest Good preached by philosophy is to sit down in the darkness and despair of the light . I want to know . Has my father ’s life gone out forever , like an extinguished torch cast into the sea ? or is it a smouldering ember that may be blown again into flame ? ”
13883	13902	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ Have you not heard , Domitia , how Senecio has assured you that your father will live . ”
13903	13906	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ Where ? ”
13907	13914	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ On the page of history . ”
13915	13985	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ First assure me that the page will be written , and that impartially . What I know of historians is that they scribble all the scurrility they can against the great and noble , in the hope of thereby advancing the credit of their own mean selves . Has a man no other hope of life than one built on the complaisance of the most malignant of men ? ”
13986	14052	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ My dear,—positively , I do not know . You turn my head with your questions . Call Plancus that I may scold him , to ease my overwrought nerves . The fellow has been stopping up his wrinkles with a composition of wax , lard and flour , and really , at his age , and in his social position — it is absurd . ”
14053	14063	13519	13525	Domitia , who had listened with indifference	920	“ But , mother , I want to know . ”
14064	14173	14174	14175	The lady	482	“ Bless me , you make me squeamish . Of course we want to know a vast number of things ; and the Highest Good , I take it , is to learn to be satisfied to know nothing . Cats , dogs , donkeys , do n’t worry themselves to know — and are happy . They have , then , the Summum Bonum . If you want to know more , ask the philosopher . He is paid for the purpose , and eats at our expense , and ye gods ! how he eats . I believe he finds the Highest Good in the platter . ”
14218	14222	14224	14225	the widow	818	“ My daughter , ”
14227	14254	14224	14225	the widow	818	“ is splitting my suffering head with questions . Pray answer her satisfactorily . Here Felicula , Procula , Lucilla , help me to the cabin . ”
14265	14282	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ Lady , you will propound difficulties , and I shall be pleased to solve them . ”
14283	14292	14294	14294	Domitia	191	“ I ask plain answers to plain questions , ”
14296	14303	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ At death — what then ? ”
14304	14338	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ Death , young lady , is the full stop at the end of the sentence , it is the closing of the diptychs of life , on which its story is inscribed . ”
14339	14353	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ I asked not what death is — but to what it leads ? ”
14354	14373	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ Leads!—it — leads ! ahem ! Death encountered with stoic equanimity is the highest point to which — ”
14374	14425	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ I do not ask how to meet death , but what it leads to . You seem unable or unwilling to answer a plain question . My dear father , does he live still — as a star that for a while sets below the horizon but returns again ? ”
14426	14461	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ He lives , most assuredly . In all men ’s mouths — on the snowy plains of Germany , on the arid wastes of Syria , the fame of Cnæus Domitius Corbulo — — ”
14462	14503	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ I asked naught about his fame , but about himself . Does he still exist , can he still think of , care for , love me — as I still think of , care for , love him — ”
14510	14576	14504	14504	Her	930	“ Young lady — Socrates could say no more of the future than that it is a brilliant hope which one may run the risk of entertaining . And our own Immortal Cicero declared that the hope of the soul living after death is a dream , and not a doctrine . The Immortals have seen fit to cut the thread of his life — — ”
14577	14614	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ The Immortals had no scissors wherewith to do it . He fell on his own sword . Is there a soul ? And after death where does it go ? Is it a mere shadow ? ”
14615	14627	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ My dear lady , philosophy teaches us to hope — — ”
14628	14648	14504	14504	Her	930	“ Natural instinct does that without the cumbrous assistance of philosophy — but what is that hope built on ? ”
14649	14655	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ I can not tell . ”
14656	14669	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ Then of what avail is it to lead a good life ? ”
14670	14678	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ On the page of history — — ”
14679	14715	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ That is where the great man lives — but the poor girl or the mechanic ? Of what avail is a good life ? What motive have we to induce us to lead it ? ”
14716	14723	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ The approval of the conscience . ”
14724	14748	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ But why should it approve ? What is good ? Where is it written that this is good and that is evil ? ”
14749	14755	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ I can not tell . ”
14756	14759	14761	14762	the girl	3790	“ So , ”
14787	14831	14779	14785	the philosopher , who retired in discomfiture	932	“ You , Chaldæan , answer me that which confounds the Stoic . You have learning in the East which we have not in the West . Tell me — what is the human soul ? and has it an existence after death ? ”
14832	14892	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ Certainly , lady . The soul is a ray of Divine light , an æon out of infinite perfection . This ray is projected into space and enters into and is entangled in matter , and that is life , in the plant , in the fish , in the bird , in the beast , in man . ”
14893	14899	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ And what after death ? ”
14900	14941	14779	14785	the philosopher , who retired in discomfiture	932	“ Death is the disengagement of this ray from its envelope . It returns to the source , to the pleroma or fulness of being and light whence it emanated , and loses itself in the one urn of splendor ! ”
14942	14965	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ But when Pactolus and Styx run into the sea , the waters are mingled and lost , as to their individuality . ”
14966	14975	14261	14262	the philosopher	606	“ And so with the spirits of men . ”
14976	14979	14981	14981	Domitia	191	“ What ! ”
14983	15042	14981	14981	Domitia	191	“ When I die my little ray re - enters the sun and is lost in the general glory — and my father ’s ray is also sucked in and disappears ! There is no comfort in a thought where individuality is extinguished . But say . How know you that what you have propounded is the truth ? ”
15050	15054	15056	15056	he	210	“ It is , ”
15058	15075	15056	15056	he	210	“ a solution at which the minds of the great thinkers of the East have arrived . ”
15076	15080	15082	15082	Domitia	191	“ I see , ”
15084	15131	15082	15082	Domitia	191	“ it is no more than a guess . You and all alike are stagnant pools , whose muddy bottoms ferment and generate and throw up guesswork bubbles . One bubble looks more substantial than another , yet are all only the disguise of equal emptiness . ”
15227	15233	15234	15234	she	191	“ They are all quacks , ”
15237	15279	15234	15234	she	191	“ They must needs be seekers , and the best they can produce , is out of themselves , and that conjecture . From the depths of the intellect what can be brought up than a more or less plausible guess ? ”
15280	15313	15234	15234	she	191	“ And on these guesses we must live , like those who float across the Tigris and Euphrates — on rafts supported by inflated bladders . There is then no solid ground ? ”
15314	15326	15234	15234	she	191	“ Man inflates the bladders — God lays the rocky basis . ”
15327	15332	15234	15234	she	191	“ What mean you ? ”
15333	15378	15234	15234	she	191	“ No certainty can be attained , in all these things man desires to know , the basis of hope , the foundation of morality , that can not be brought out of man . It can only be known by revelation of God . ”
15379	15395	15234	15234	she	191	“ And till he reveals we must drift on wind - bags . Good lack ! ”
15396	15461	15234	15234	she	191	“ Do you think , Lady , that He who made man , and planted in man ’s heart a desire for a future life , and made it necessary for his welfare that he should know to discern between good and evil , should leave him forever in the dark — like as you said Theseus in the labyrinth , without a clue ? ”
15462	15469	15234	15234	she	191	“ But where is the clue ? ”
15470	15560	15234	15234	she	191	“ Or think you that He who launched the vessel of man , having carefully laid the keel and framed the ribs , and set in her a pilot , should send her forth into unknown seas to certain wreckage — to be wafted up and down by every wind — to be carried along by every current — to fall on reefs , or be engulfed by quicksands , and not to reach a port , and He not to set lights whereby her course may be directed ? ”
15561	15568	15234	15234	she	191	“ But where are the lights ? ”
15618	15623	15578	15578	Lamia	219	“ The Imperial galley ! ”
15661	15668	15669	15669	He	941	“ Lucius I must see — — ”
15683	15692	15693	15693	he	941	“ Every word dropped is fraught with danger , ”
15696	15708	15693	15693	he	941	“ What know you but that yon physician be a spy ? ”
15709	15715	15716	15716	she	191	“ He is not that , ”
15719	15728	15716	15716	she	191	“ show him to me — him — — ”
15961	16003	15957	15959	the second mate	957	“ You take your meridian by Polaris , Castor and Pollux , steer due west ; if there be a slight deviation from the right course , that is a trifle . I will set it right when my watch comes . ”
16015	16022	16024	16024	Lamia	219	“ The steersman is done up , ”
16026	16063	16024	16024	Lamia	219	“ he shall rest now , and no better man can be found to replace him than Eboracus , who has been accustomed to the stormy seas of Britain , and whose nerves are of iron . ”
16632	16639	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ It is the Augustus singing , ”
16651	16662	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ And he has his band of adulators about him . ”
16663	16675	16677	16677	Domitia	191	“ But why do not the rowers urge on the vessel ? ”
16679	16726	16677	16677	Domitia	191	“ Because the piper giving the stroke would be committing high treason in drowning the song of the princely performer . By the Gods ! the grinding of the oars in the rowlocks and the plash in the water would drown even his most supreme trills . ”
16727	16738	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ Hast thou seen him on the stage , Lamia ? ”
16739	16744	16746	16748	the young man	535	“ The Gods forbid , ”
16751	16833	16746	16748	the young man	535	“ this fancy to be the first of singers and mimes had not come on him before I left Rome for Syria . To think of it , that he — the head of the magis tracy , of the army , of the senate , of the priesthood , should figure as Apollo , half naked , in a gold - powdered wig , and with painted cheeks before sniggering Greeks ! The Gods deliver me from such a sight ! ”
16834	16854	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ But you will behold it now . As we speed along we shall overtake this floating dramatic booth . ”
16855	16883	16746	16748	the young man	535	“ I will give her a wide berth , and stop my ears with wax , though , by the Gods ! this is no siren song . ”
16893	16900	16884	16884	Domitia	191	“ Are they sharp , Lucius ? ”
16901	16908	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ Are what sharp , Domitia ? ”
16909	16913	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ The beaks . ”
16914	16919	16884	16884	Domitia	191	“ Sharp as lancets . ”
16920	16924	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ And strong ? ”
16925	16930	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ Strong as rams . ”
16931	16967	16884	16884	Domitia	191	“ Then , Lucius , we will not give her wide berth . You loved my father . You regard me . You will do what I desire , for his sake and for mine . ”
16968	16976	16641	16641	Lamia	219	“ What would you have of me ? ”
16977	16981	16884	16884	Domitia	191	“ Ram her ! ”
17009	17030	16992	16992	She	3790	“ Run her down , Lucius ! Sink the accursed murderer and mountebank in the depths of the Ionian sea . ”
17043	17049	17036	17036	She	3790	“ Can it be done ? ”
17050	17061	16992	16992	She	3790	“ By Hercules ! we could rip up her side . ”
17062	17067	17068	17068	He	219	“ Then do so . ”
17072	17175	17068	17068	He	219	“ Hearken to me . None will suspect our intention as we swiftly shoot up — no , none in this vessel , only Eboracus must be in it . Suddenly we will round and ram and welt her ; and send the new Orion with his fiddle to the fishes . By the Furies ! We shall hear him scream . We shall see him beat the waves . Lucius , let me have a marline - spike to dash at him as he swims and split his skull and let out his brains for the fishes to banquet on them . ”
17176	17183	16992	16992	She	3790	“ We risk all our lives . ”
17184	17199	16992	16992	She	3790	“ What care I ? My father , your friend , will be avenged . ”
17206	17239	17201	17201	Lamia	219	“ Lucius ! I will twine my white arms about your neck , and will kiss you with my red lips , the moment his last scream has rung in my ears . ”
17240	17249	17251	17251	Lamia	219	“ In the name of Vengeance — then , ”
17253	17260	17262	17262	Domitia	191	“ Eboracus I can count on , ”
17264	17285	17262	17262	Domitia	191	“ There is the under - mate . If any one on board suspect our purpose , we are undone . ”
17286	17291	17293	17294	the girl	3790	“ None need suspect , ”
17296	17372	17293	17294	the girl	3790	“ Say that the prince is holding festival on board the trireme , and that it behoves us to salute . None will think other than that we are befooling ourselves like the rest . At the right moment , before any has a thought of thy purpose , call for the double - stroke , and trust Eboracus — he will put the helm about , and in a moment we run her down . ”
17430	17449	17418	17419	Next Lamia	240	“ The vessel of Cæsar is before us . We dare not pass without leave asked and granted . ”
17450	17456	17458	17460	the second mate	957	“ All right , sir , ”
17462	17467	17458	17460	the second mate	957	“ Any orders below ? ”
17468	17498	17418	17419	Next Lamia	240	“ Keep on at present speed . When I call Slack , then let them slacken . When I call Double , then at once with full force double . ”
17499	17510	17511	17512	The mate	888	“ Right , sir . I will carry down instructions . ”
17938	18021	18023	18023	he	212	“ He , having come to the glorious pageantry of the sports in Greece , entered the lists to win the Delphic prizes , he , the admired of every eye . And having started from his goal in wondrous whirls he sped along the course , and bore away the of all coveted prize of victory . But that I may tell thee in few words amidst superfluity I have never known such a man of might and deeds as he — ”
18104	18108	18110	18110	Lamia	219	“ Slack speed , ”
18112	18117	18110	18110	Lamia	219	“ Slack your oars , ”
18136	18139	18141	18141	Lamia	219	“ Double ! ”
18143	18148	18141	18141	Lamia	219	“ Double your oars ! ”
18288	18292	18274	18274	Nero	212	“ Who commands ? ”
18299	18306	18274	18274	Nero	212	“ Pour oil on the flames . ”
18323	18327	18329	18331	the furious prince	1056	“ The name ! ”
18339	18344	18274	18274	Nero	212	“ Cnæus Domitius Corbulo . ”
18396	18402	18403	18403	he	212	“ The dead pursue me , ”
18406	18418	18403	18403	he	212	“ Wife , mother , brother , and now , Corbulo ! ”
18419	18425	18427	18427	Eboracus	193	“ It is well done , ”
18435	18451	18427	18427	Eboracus	193	“ Otherwise there had been the cross for you and me . The thong broke . ”
18452	18457	18459	18459	Luke	219	“ I severed it , ”
18461	18466	18468	18469	the slave	520	“ That I saw , ”
18471	18545	18468	18469	the slave	520	“ I shall report that it yielded . One must obey a master even to the risk of the cross . Did’st see the noble Lamia , how ready he was ? He assumed the mask of my dead master and we have slipped by and sent a shiver through the whole company of the Trireme , and the August too , I trow,—for they have thought us the Ship of the Dead . ”
18550	18625	18549	18549	he	1061	said,—“In my home we hold that all souls go to sea in a phantom vessel ; and sail away to the West , to the Isles of the Blessed . At night a dark ship with a sail as a thundercloud comes to the shore , and those near can hear the dead in trains go over the beach and enter the ghostly vessel , till she is laden , and then she departs . ”
18826	18830	18839	18839	he	212	“ miserable fiddler . ”

20801	20806	20808	20808	he	219	“ No , Domitia , ”
20811	20833	20808	20808	he	219	“ as your dear father gave me permission on the wharf at Cenchræa , I will claim the same privilege now . ”
20858	20870	20871	20871	she	191	“ I thank you , dear friend , and almost brother , ”
20874	20928	20871	20871	she	191	“ You spoke nobly of my father , though not more nobly than he deserved . Here , my Lucius , is a present for you , I intrust it to you — his sword , which he used so gallantly , on which he fell , and still marked with his blood . ”
21683	21686	21688	21689	the freedman	489	“ Augustus ! ”
21691	21738	21688	21689	the freedman	489	“ I am not ungrateful for favors shown me , but my assistance at this hour is unavailing . I am but one man , a stranger , a Greek , and all Rome , all Italy , the entire world , have risen against you . ”
21739	21766	21688	21689	the freedman	489	“ I must fly . They will allow me to earn my livelihood on the stage . Of what value to any man is my life ? ”
21767	21848	21849	21849	Nero	212	“ My lord , in what value have you held the lives of the thousands that you have taken ? Each life cut off has raised against you a hundred enemies . All will pursue , like a pack of hounds baying for the blood of him who murdered their kinsfolk . Even now I passed one — Lucius Ælius Lamia,—and he stayed me to inquire where you might be found . In his hand he held an unsheathed sword . ”
21868	21901	21902	21902	Phaon	253	“ Let us hide . Disguise me . Get me a horse . I can not run , I am too fat ; besides , I have on my felt slippers only . ”
21915	21918	21920	21921	the freedman	489	“ Master , ”
21923	21963	21920	21921	the freedman	489	“ Do not deceive yourself . There is no escape . Prepare to die as a man . Slay yourself . It is not hard to die . Better so fall than get into the hands of implacable enemies . ”
21964	21996	22067	22068	An eunuch	1253	“ I can not . I have not the courage . I will do it only when everything fails . I have many theatrical wigs . I can paint my face . ”
21997	22027	21920	21921	the freedman	489	“ Sire ! the people are so wo nt to see your face besmeared with color , that they are less likely to recognize a face bleached to tallow . ”
22028	22066	22067	22068	An eunuch	1253	“ I have a broad - brimmed fisherman ’s hat . I wear it against becoming freckled . That will shade my face . Find me an ample cloak . Here , at length , comes Sporus . ”
22102	22111	22113	22113	Phaon	253	“ But whither will — can you go ? ”
22115	22135	22113	22113	Phaon	253	“ The Senate has been assembled — it has been convoked for midnight to vote your deposition and death . ”
22136	22178	22074	22074	Breathless	255	“ I will go before it . Nay ! I will haste to the Forum , I will mount the Tribune . I will ask to be given the government of Egypt . That at least will not be refused me . ”
22179	22202	22074	22074	Breathless	255	“ My lord , the streets are filling with people . They will tear you to pieces ere you reach the Forum . ”
22203	22251	22113	22113	Phaon	253	“ Think you so ! Why so ? I have amused the people so well . Good Phaon , hire me a swift galley , and I will take refuge with Tiridates . I restored to him the crown of Armenia . He will not be ungrateful . ”
22252	22267	22074	22074	Breathless	255	“ My lord , it will not be possible for you to leave Italy . ”
22268	22346	22074	22074	Breathless	255	“ Then I will retire to a farm . I will grow cabbages and turnips . The god Tiberius was fond of turnips . O Divine Powers that rule the fate of men ! shall I ever eat turnips again ? Phaon , hide me for a season . Men ’s minds are changeable . They are heated now . They will cool to - morrow . They can not kill such a superlative artist as myself . ”
22347	22369	22113	22113	Phaon	253	“ I have a villa between the Salarian and the Nomentane Roads . If it please you to go thither — — ”
22370	22388	22389	22389	Sporus	254	“ At once . I think I hear horse - hoofs . O Phaon , save me ! ”
22424	22432	22113	22113	Phaon	253	“ Horses ! horses at the door ! ”
22433	22447	22449	22449	Nero	212	“ Who calls so loud ? Silence him . He will betray us ! ”
22451	22458	22449	22449	Nero	212	“ Hah ! It is Epaphroditus . ”
22527	22533	22535	22536	the freedman	489	“ The horses are here , ”
22538	22555	22535	22536	the freedman	489	“ May it please my lord to mount . Sporus and the slaves can run afoot . ”
22604	22643	22596	22598	The chained Greek	1262	“ Master ! my chain has become entangled and is so knotted that I can not stir . I have been thus since noon , and none have regarded me . I pray thee , let me go . ”

22656	22670	22653	22653	Nero	212	“ Dost think I carry about with me the key of thy shackles ? ”
22677	22695	22653	22653	Nero	212	“ Smite him on the mouth and silence him , or he will call attention to me . ”

22915	22943	22910	22910	he	212	“ What think you , if I were to enter the camp ? Surely the Prætorians would rally about me , and I might dissolve the Senate . ”
22944	22971	22910	22910	he	212	“ Sire , they have destroyed your images , and have proclaimed Galba . They would take off your head and set it on a pike . ”
22995	23004	22988	22991	a passer - by	1276	“ By the Immortals ! I am recognized . ”
23005	23015	23049	23050	The prince	4158	“ We have but to go a little further . ”
23016	23031	22988	22991	a passer - by	1276	“ Phaon , what if the Senate declare me an enemy of the State ? ”
23032	23042	22988	22991	a passer - by	1276	“ Then you will fare in the customary manner . ”
23043	23048	23049	23050	The prince	4158	“ How is that ? ”
23073	23113	23067	23068	The freedman	489	“ The customary manner , sire ! your neck will be put in the cleft of a forked stick and you will be beaten , lashed , kicked to death . Better take the sword and fall on it . ”
23114	23142	23067	23068	The freedman	489	“ Oh , Phaon ! not yet ! I can not endure pain . I have a spring nail now — and it hurts ! it hurts ! ”
23143	23172	23067	23068	The freedman	489	“ Ride on , my lord ; at the cypress hedge we will turn our horses loose , and by a path through the fields reach my villa . ”
23229	23242	23244	23244	Epaphroditus	256	“ I will both answer and show you whither he is fled , ”
23246	23262	23244	23244	Epaphroditus	256	“ if you will release me . Otherwise my tongue is tied like my limbs . ”
23263	23268	23306	23306	Epaphroditus	256	“ Is he here ? ”
23269	23295	23244	23244	Epaphroditus	256	“ Nay , he has been here , but is gone . Whither I alone can say . The price of the information is release . ”
23296	23305	23306	23306	Epaphroditus	256	“ Tell me where I can find tools . ”
23365	23373	23375	23375	he	1281	“ Now I will lead the way , ”
23506	23511	23512	23512	he	1281	“ I hear steps ! ”

23554	23565	23566	23566	he	212	“ It is too blunt , it will not enter , ”
23577	23586	23587	23587	he	212	“ It is over sharp . It cuts , ”
23610	23629	23602	23602	Nero	212	“ Sporus ! Phaon ! one or both ! kill yourselves and show me how to do it . ”
23630	23635	23637	23637	Lamia	219	“ To do it ! ”
23640	23661	23662	23662	He	212	“ That is not difficult . Do you need a sword ? Here is one — the sword of Corbulo . ”
23684	23694	23679	23679	Lamia	219	“ Oh ! a moment ! I feel sick . ”
23699	23705	23696	23696	Phaon	253	“ Sire — at once ! ”
23725	23730	23731	23731	he	212	“ I can not , ”
23734	23740	23731	23731	he	212	“ my hand is numb . ”
23799	23820	23777	23777	Lamia	219	“ Push , my dear Domitia , Push . Of course . What else would you have , but Push ? ”
23821	23836	24021	24021	her	3790	“ But , sweetest mother , that surely can not give what I ask . ”
23837	23866	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Indeed , my child , it does . It occupies all one ’s energies , it exerts all one ’s faculties , and it fills the heart . ”
23867	23875	23777	23777	Lamia	219	“ But — what do you gain ? ”
23876	23913	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Gain , child?—everything . The satisfaction of having got further up the ladder ; of exciting the envy of your late companions , the admiration of the vulgar , the mistrust of those above you . ”
23914	23920	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Is that worth having ? ”
23921	24001	23777	23777	Lamia	219	“ Of course it is . It is — that very thing you desire , Happiness . It engages all your thoughts , stimulates your abilities . You dress for it ; you prepare your table for it , accumulate servants for it , walk , smile , talk , acquire furniture , statuary , bronzes , and so on — for it . It is charming , ravishing . I live for it . I desire nothing better . ”
24002	24016	24017	24018	The girl	3790	“ But I do , mother . I do not care for this . ”
24049	24053	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Ubi Felicitas ? ”
24054	24208	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Because you are young and silly , Domitia . When older and wiser , you will understand the value of Push , and appreciate Position . My dear , properly considered , everything can be made use of for the purpose — even widowhood , dexterously dealt with , becomes a vehicle for Push . It really is vexatious that in Rome there should just now be such broils and effervescence of minds , proclamation of emperors , cutting of throats , that I , poor thing , here in Gabii run a chance of being forgotten . It is too provoking . I really wish that this upsetting of Nero , and setting up of Galba , and defection of Otho , and so on , had been postponed till my year of widowhood were at an end . One gets no chance , and it might have been so effective . ”
24209	24222	24387	24387	she	181	“ And when you have obtained that at which you have aimed ? ”
24223	24233	24387	24387	she	181	“ Then make that the start for another push . ”
24234	24240	24021	24021	her	3790	“ And if you fail ? ”
24241	24269	24387	24387	she	181	“ Then , my dear , you have the gratification of being able to lay the blame on some one else . You have done your utmost . ”
24270	24285	24387	24387	she	181	“ When you have gained what you aimed at , you are not content . ”
24286	24305	24021	24021	her	3790	“ That is just the beauty of Push . No , always go on to what is beyond . ”
24306	24353	24387	24387	she	181	“ Look at that running girl , mother , she chases a butterfly , and when she has caught the lovely insect she crushes it in her hand . The glory of its wings is gone , its life is at an end . What then ? ”
24354	24361	24387	24387	she	181	“ She runs after another butterfly . ”
24362	24374	24021	24021	her	3790	“ And despises and rejects each to which she has attained ? ”
24375	24378	24387	24387	she	181	“ Certainly ! ”
24397	24415	24387	24387	she	181	“ That was the one defect in your dear father ’s character , he had no Push . ”
24416	24439	24021	24021	her	3790	“ Mother ! can you say that after his splendid victories , over the Chauci , over the Parthians , over — — ”
24440	24460	24021	24021	her	3790	“ I know all about them . They should have served as means , child , not as ends . ”
24461	24467	24387	24387	she	181	“ I do not understand . ”
24468	24563	24567	24568	the lady	482	“ Poor simple man , he fought the enemies of Rome and defeated them , because it was , as he said , his duty to his country , to Rome , to do so . But , by Ops and Portumna ! that was talking like a child . What might he not have been with those victories ? But he could n’t see it . He had it not in him . Some men are born to squint ; some have club feet ; and your poor dear father had no ambition . ”
24571	24655	24567	24568	the lady	482	“ When I come to consider what he might have done for me , had he possessed Push , it makes my spleen swell . Just consider ! What is Galba compared with him ? What any of these fellows who have been popping up their heads like carp or trout when the May flies are about ? My dear , had your dear father been as complete a man as I am a woman , at this moment I might be Empress . ”
24656	24663	24387	24387	she	181	“ That would have contented you . ”
24664	24675	24387	24387	she	181	“ It would have been a step in that direction . ”
24676	24683	24387	24387	she	181	“ What more could you desire ? ”
24684	24856	24857	24857	She	1302	“ Why , to be a goddess . Did not the Senate pronounce Poppæa divine , and to be worshipped and invoked , after Nero had kicked her and she died ? And that baby of his — it died of fits in teething — that became a goddess also . Nasty little thing ! I saw it , it did nothing but dribble and squall , but is a god for all that . My dear Domitia , think ! the Divine Duilia ! Salus Italiæ , with my temples , my altars , my statues . By the Immortal Twelve , I think I should have tried to cut out Aphrodite , and have been represented rising from the foam . Oh ! it would have been too , too lovely . But there ! it makes me mad — all that might have been , and would have been to a certainty , had your dear father listened to me at Antioch . But he had a head . ”
24862	24870	24857	24857	She	1302	“ Something wrong there — no Push . ”
24871	24918	24387	24387	she	181	“ But , dearest mother , this may be an approved motive for such as you and for all nobles . But then — for the artisan , the herdsman , the slave , Push ca n’t be a principle of life to such as they . ”
24919	24983	24387	24387	she	181	“ My child , how odd you are ! What need we consider them ? They may have their own motives , I ca n’t tell ; I never was a herdsman nor a slave — never did any useful work in my life . As to a slave , of course Push is a motive — he pushes to gain his freedom . ”
24984	24992	24857	24857	She	1302	“ And when he has got that ? ”
24993	25002	24387	24387	she	181	“ Then he strives to accumulate a fortune . ”
25003	25007	24387	24387	she	181	“ And then ? ”
25008	25033	24857	24857	She	1302	“ Then he will have a statue or a bust of himself sculptured , and when he gets old , erect a splendid mausoleum . ”
25034	25045	24387	24387	she	181	“ And so all ends in a handful of dust . ”
25046	25060	24387	24387	she	181	“ Of course . What else would you have?—Remember , a splendid mausoleum . ”
25061	25095	24387	24387	she	181	“ Yes , enclosing a pot of ashes . That picture teaches a sad truth . Pursue your butterfly : when you have caught it , you find only dust between your fingers . ”
25096	25172	24857	24857	She	1302	“ Domitia ! as the Gods love me ! I wish you would refrain from this talk . It is objectionable . It is prematurely oldening you , and what ages you reflects on me — it advances my years . I will listen to no more of this . If you relish it , I do not ; go , chatter to the Philosopher Claudius Senecio , he is paid to talk this stuff . ”
25173	25189	24387	24387	she	181	“ I will not speak to him . I know beforehand what he will say . ”
25190	25205	24387	24387	she	181	“ He will give you excellent advice , he is hired to do it . ”
25206	25258	24857	24857	She	1302	“ O yes — to bear everything with equanimity . That is the sum and substance of his doctrine . Then not to be too wise about the Gods ; to aim to sit on the fulcrum of a see - saw , when I prefer an end of the plank . ”
25259	25270	24387	24387	she	181	“ Equanimity ! I desire it with my whole soul . ”
25271	25287	24387	24387	she	181	“ But why so , mother ? It is not running thought , but stagnation . ”
25288	25299	24857	24857	She	1302	“ Because , my dear , it keeps off wrinkles . ”
25300	25312	24387	24387	she	181	“ Mother , you and I will never understand each other . ”
25313	25343	24387	24387	she	181	“ As the Gods love me , I sincerely hope not . Send me Plancus , Lucilla . I must scold him so as to soothe my ruffled spirits . ”
25344	25360	25362	25363	the girl	3790	“ And , Euphrosyne , go , send the Chaldæan to me in the garden , ”
25371	25382	25384	25384	Domitia	191	“ Ubi Felicitas ? Running , pursuing and finding nothing , ”
25495	25499	25501	25501	she	3790	“ Ubi Felicitas ? ”
25517	25697	25512	25512	she	3790	“ There is a picture in the atrium representing a damsel in pursuit of a butterfly , and beneath is the legend I have just quoted . When she catches the butterfly it will not content her . It will be a dead pinch of dust . It is now some months since you spoke on the Artemis , when I asked you a question , and then you were forced to admit that all your science was built up on conjecture , and that there was no certainty underlying it . But a guess is better than nothing , and a guess that carries the moral sense with it in approval , may come near to the truth . I recall all you then said . Do not repeat it , but answer my question , Ubi Felicitas ? I asked it of my mother , and she said that it was to be found in Push . If I asked Senecio , he would say in Equanimity . Where say you that it is to be found ? ”
25698	25711	25713	25714	the Magus	1309	“ The soul of man is a ray out of the Godhead , ”
25716	25762	25512	25512	she	3790	“ it is enveloped , depressed , smothered by matter ; and the straining of the spirit in man after happiness is the striving of his divine nature to emancipate itself from the thraldom of matter and return to Him from whom the ray emanated . ”
25763	25772	25853	25854	the girl	3790	“ Then felicity is to be found — ? ”
25773	25795	25853	25854	the girl	3790	“ In the disengagement of the good in man from matter , which presses it down , and which is evil . ”
25796	25799	25801	25801	Domitia	191	“ Evil ! ”
25846	25851	25853	25854	the girl	3790	“ The Divine ray , ”
25856	25899	25853	25854	the girl	3790	“ seems rarely to delight in its incorporation in Matter , and to find therein its expression , much as do our thoughts in words . May it not be that Primordial Idea is inarticulate without Matter in which to utter itself ? ”
25900	25903	25905	25906	the Chaldæan	207	“ Felicity , ”
25912	25973	25905	25906	the Chaldæan	207	“ is sought by many in the satisfying of their animal appetites , in pleasing eye and ear and taste and smell . But in all is found the after - taste of satiety that gluts . True happiness is to be sought in teaching the mind to dispense with sensuous delights , and to live in absorption in itself . ”
25974	25979	25981	25981	Domitia	191	“ Why , Elymas ! ”
25983	26042	25981	25981	Domitia	191	“ In fine , you arrive by another method at that Apathy which Senecio the Stoic advocates . I grant you give a reason — which seems to me lame — but it is a reason , whereas he supplies none . But I like not your goal — Apathy is the reverse from Felicity . Leave me . ”
26088	26109	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Your lady mother has desired me to announce to you that Lucius Ælius Lamia hath ridden over from Rome . ”
26110	26116	26118	26118	Domitia	191	“ I will come presently , ”
26120	26144	26118	26118	Domitia	191	“ I am just now too troubled in mind . You , child , tell me , where is the physician , Luke ? ”
26145	26160	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Lady , I do not know ; he quitted us on reaching Rome . ”
26161	26179	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Stay , Euphrosyne . Thine is a cheerful spirit . Where is felicity to be found ? ”
26180	26196	26118	26118	Domitia	191	“ My gracious mistress , I find mine in serving thee — in my duty . ”
26197	26428	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Ah , child ! That is the sort of reply my father might have made . In the discharge of what he considered his duty , he was of a wondrous sweet and equable temper . Is it so , that Felicity is only to be found in the discharge of duty ? And those torpid flies , the young loafers of our noble families , whose only occupation is to play ball , and whose amusements are vicious ; they have it not because none has set them tasks . The ploughman whistles as he drives his team ; the vineyard rings with laughter at the gathering of the grapes . The galley - slaves chant as they bend over the oar , and the herdboy pipes as he tends the goats . So each is set a task , and is content in discharge thereof , and each sleeps sweetly at night , when the task is done . But what ! is happiness reserved to the bondsman , and not for the master ? And only then for the former when the duty imposed is reasonable and honest?—For there is none when such an order comes as to fall on the sword or to open the veins . How about us great ladies ? And the noble loafers ? No task is set us and them . ”
26429	26441	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Surely , lady , to all God has given duties ! ”
26442	26621	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ Nay — when , where , how ? Look at me , Euphrosyne . When I was a little child here , we had a neighbor , Lentulus . He was a lie - abed , and a sot . He let his servants do as they liked , make love , quarrel , fight , the one lord it over the other , and all idle , because on none was imposed any duty . It was a villainous household , and the estate went to the hammer . It seems to me , Euphrosyne , as if this whole world were the estate of Lentulus on a large scale , where all the servants squabbled , and one by sheer force tyrannizes over the others , and none know why they are placed there , and what is their master ’s will , and what they have to do . There is no day - table of work . There is either no master over such a household , or he is an Olympian Lentulus . ”
26622	26632	26691	26691	Lamia	219	“ But , mistress , is that not impossible ? ”
26633	26677	26085	26086	her mistress	1316	“ It would seem so , and yet — Where is the Day - Table ? Show me that — and , by the Gods ! it will be new life to me . I shall know my duty — and see Happiness . ”
27071	27074	27075	27075	she	191	“ Lucius , ”
27078	27098	27075	27075	she	191	“ you are good to come . My mother is , oh ! so dull , and restless withal . ”
27099	27276	27051	27051	she	191	“ It is well that she should be away from Rome , my Domitia . I have told her as much . On no account must you leave Gabii . Rome is boiling over , and will scald many fingers . None know who will be up to - morrow , and which down . Galba is dead , almost torn to pieces by those who worshipped him yesterday . Otho is proclaimed by the Senate . Yet there is fresh trouble brewing and threats sound from the provinces . Methinks every general at the head of an army is marching upon Rome to snatch the purple for his own shoulders . Otho has but a poor chance . He can command the prætorians and the household troops — none others . Soldiers that have disbanded themselves and gangs of robbers prowl the streets , waylay men of substance and plunder them , break into houses and strip them of their contents . Murders are frequent . Thus far your palace in the Carinæ is undisturbed . ”
27277	27333	27051	27051	she	191	“ Oh , Lucius ! my mother has so fretted over that house , as it stands back , and makes no show behind its bank of yews and laurels , and yet those evergreens , I believe , saved it in the fire . She says that the house is unworthy of our dignity . ”
27334	27384	27075	27075	she	191	“ You may rejoice that it is so in such times of anarchy . Order in the city is now at an end , none are safe unless attended by armed slaves ; and , by the Gods ! no man is quite safe even from his own slaves . ”
27385	27394	27051	27051	she	191	“ What did my mother say to that ? ”
27395	27401	27075	27075	she	191	“ She sighed and said — ”
27411	27443	27075	27075	she	191	“ that she was glad the disturbances were taking place now , as at no time could they have happened so happily , when she was obliged to live in retirement . ”
27444	27456	27051	27051	she	191	“ Lucius , what do you think will be the end ? ”
27457	27494	27075	27075	she	191	“ That the gods alone can tell . At present the soldiers are masters in the State , and the Senate proclaims whomsoever they set up . Rome is dishonored in the face of the Barbarians . ”
27495	27513	27075	27075	she	191	“ What think you , my Lucius,—shall we ask the Chaldee if he can unveil the future ? ”
27514	27548	27051	27051	she	191	“ Not of the State , Domitia , that were too dangerous . Women have lost their lives , or been banished on such a charge . No , do not risk it . ”
27549	27644	27075	27075	she	191	“ Nay , Lucius , like my mother , the State concerns me only so far as its affairs affect my own silly little interests . But I do want to know something of my future . Elymas is reputed to look into destiny . He hath glimpses beyond the strain of a philosopher ’s eye . I have offended him by my quips and objections , and would humor him now by asking him to read in the stars , or where he will , what the gods have in store for me . ”
27645	27653	27075	27075	she	191	“ I believe not in such vision . ”
27654	27681	27051	27051	she	191	“ Nor I greatly , Lucius . Yet I heard say that he had prognosticated evil on the day my dear father set foot in Cenchræa . ”
27682	27691	27075	27075	she	191	“ It needed no prophet to foretell that . ”
27692	27700	27075	27075	she	191	“ Shall we seek him , Lucius ? ”
27701	27741	27051	27051	she	191	“ As you will . I will attend thee . Only , no questions relative to the prince , as to his life , his reign , his health . No questions concerning the State — promise me that . ”
27742	27763	27075	27075	she	191	“ It shall be so , Lucius . Come with me to the Temple of Isis . He is there . ”
27846	27964	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ Sir ! I fear me greatly that I gave you occasion to think I held your theories cheaply . Indeed it is not so , they are too weighty to be dismissed at once ; they take time to digest . There is one thing you may do for me , that I desire of you heartily , and in which I will not controvert your authority . It is said that the stars rule the destinies of men , and that in the far East , on the boundless plains of Mesopotamia , you and your people have learned to read them . I would fain know what the heavens have in store for me . ”
27965	28034	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ Indeed , lady , to consult the stars is a long and painful business , that I will gladly undertake , but it can not be done hastily . It will require time . There are , however , other ways of reading the future than by the stars . There is Ishtar , whom the Egyptians call Isis , whom thou mayest consult in this temple . ”
28035	28040	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ I am ready . ”
28041	28222	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ That also can not be undertaken at once . I must even send for my assistant Helena . It is not I who see , save mediately . The goddess has her chosen instrument , and such is Helena . Lady ! Ishtar is the Truth , she has no image . She is invisible to us veiled in matter . She hides herself behind seven veils , or rather our eyes are so wrapped about that we can not see her who is visible only in spirit . Thou knowest that in the Temple floor is a rent , and through that rent the breath of the gods ascends . I will place Helena over that rent , and she will fall into a trance , and if I say certain prayers and use certain invocations , then the veils will fall away , and in pure spiritual essence she will look into the face of Ishtar and read therein the Truth , past , present , and future . Is it your pleasure to consult the goddess ? ”
28223	28230	28232	28232	Domitia	191	“ Indeed I do desire it , ”
28234	28240	28232	28232	Domitia	191	“ Thou hast no fear ? ”
28241	28248	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ Fear ! fear of what ? ”
28249	28268	28232	28232	Domitia	191	“ Of the future . It is well for us that the gods hide this from our eyes . ”
28276	28279	28280	28280	she	191	“ No , ”
28286	28295	28280	28280	she	191	“ I have no fear for my future . ”
28296	28313	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ That which is anticipated does not always come , but rather that which is unexpected . ”
28314	28323	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ Then when forewarned , one is forearmed . ”
28324	28351	28280	28280	she	191	“ If it be thy pleasure , lady , return at sunset . Then Helena shall be here , and I shall have made my preparations . ”
28352	28379	27829	27830	the girl	3790	“ That is but an hour hence . Be it so . Come , Lamia . Thou shalt row me on the lake till Elymas call . ”
28380	28385	28387	28387	Lucius	219	“ So be it , ”
28397	28443	28394	28394	he	219	“ I like that not . If it pleased the gods to show us what is in store , then they would reveal it to us . I mistrust me , this man is either an impostor or he deals with the spirits of evil . ”
28444	28477	28394	28394	he	219	“ Nay , think not so . Why should not the Truth lie behind seven veils , and if so , and we are able , why not pluck away those veils ? ”
28478	28496	28394	28394	he	219	“ In good sooth , Domitia , thou hast more daring in thy little soul than have I. ”
28915	28918	28920	28920	he	219	“ Domitia , ”
28922	28951	28920	28920	he	219	“ Do you know that there is a rumor about that Nero is not dead , but has fled to the Parthians , and that he will return ? ”
28952	28959	28960	28961	The girl	3790	“ You do not say so ! ”
28967	29008	28960	28961	The girl	3790	“ I do not believe it . It can not be . The sword of your father would not bite so feebly as to let him live . Yet the tale is circulating . Men are uneasy — expecting something . ”
29009	29022	28920	28920	he	219	“ If he be dead and burnt , he can not return . ”
29023	29026	29028	29028	Lucius	219	“ No , ”
29030	29150	29028	29028	Lucius	219	“ he can not return from the dead . And yet — there be strange rumors . Among the Christians , I am told , there has risen up a seer , who hath been taken with an ecstasy , and hath beheld wonderful visions . And this is reported , that he saw a beast arising out of the sea , having seven heads , and on each head a golden crown . And one of those heads , the fifth , received a death - wound . Then arose two other heads , and after them the wounded head arose once again and breathed fire and slaughter , and the second state was worse than the first . ”
29151	29161	28920	28920	he	219	“ But , Lucius , what can this signify ? ”
29162	29211	29212	29212	Domitia	191	“ They say it signifies the Empire of Rome , and that the heads are the princes , and the fifth head , that is wounded as unto death , but not slain , is Nero , and that after two have arisen , then he will return . ”
29215	29263	29212	29212	Domitia	191	“ If he return , Lamia , he will not forget thee . Well , we will ourselves look behind the veils ; that is better than hearing through others what some unknown prophet hath said . See , on the shore stands Elymas , calling us . ”
29815	30135	30136	30136	He	1396	“ As I have told thee , lady , out of the ineffable Light stream rays that are both luminous and life - producing . These rays penetrate to the lowest profundity of matter , and as they pass through the higher atmospheres , gather about them the particles of vapor , and become angels and demons . But other rays passing further down , and assuming grosser envelopes , become men and women , some more animal than others , some with higher spiritual natures than the rest , according as in them matter or spirit dominates . And the rays darting into further depths become the beasts of the field , the fishes of the sea , even the very worm that bores in the soil . As thou knowest , he who stands on a high mountain can see far horizons to right and to left as well as the objects below him . So , to the Eternal , all is visible , the past on one side , the present before Him , and the future on the other side , all in one vision . To Him there is no past , and no present , and no future , for Time is not — all is comprehended in one view . But we , who are below , see only the present , remember the past , and conjecture what is future . If we would see future as well as past , we must rise above matter , mount from our base level to the altitude of spirit . Thence all is clear . But this is not possible to all , only to those elect ones in whom the flesh is subdued , and to it the spirit remains attached only by a fibre . Such is Helena . Through her thou shalt see what thou desirest . Now behold ! ”
30162	30165	30167	30167	Elymas	207	“ That , ”
30169	30314	30167	30167	Elymas	207	“ is a crystal . It is the lens through which the rays of the Eternal and Immortal Light pass to the soul of Helena , out of Infinite Altitude and Illimitable Space . She is enveloped in seven veils . Now she lieth in a trance , and seeth naught . But I will invoke this Fount of Life and Light and Knowledge , and will gather the rays together into her soul through yonder crystal , and she will see in vision what thou desirest . Seven veils cover her , and seven are the revelations that will be made . I can not assure thee that all will be future — some may be scenes of the past , for to the All - Seeing , the Eye of Eternity , there is neither past nor future ; all is present . ”
30315	30322	30324	30324	Lamia	219	“ Well , so be it , ”
30326	30369	30324	30324	Lamia	219	“ By the past we can judge the future . Let us see things that have been and we can form some notion of what is shown us as future . If the one be incorrect , then the other is untrustworthy . ”
30370	30376	30378	30379	the Magus	1309	“ Thou shalt behold nothing , ”
30381	30397	30378	30379	the Magus	1309	“ for it is not thou who consultest me , but the lady Domitia Longina . ”
30398	30412	30414	30415	the girl	3790	“ How shall I see , and not he who stands beside me ? ”
30469	30476	30478	30478	Elymas	207	“ Hold her hand in thine , ”
30480	30548	30478	30478	Elymas	207	“ and I will invoke the Source of Spirits , and as I withdraw each veil that covers her face , she will see something , and she seeing it , the sense of sight will pass through her hand to thee , and thou wilt see also , inwardly , yet very really . Only let not go her hand , or all will become dark . ”
30608	30613	30615	30615	Lucius	219	“ What ails thee ? ”
30623	30633	30622	30622	he	1399	added—“Let us go forth . This is mere jugglery . ”
30634	30639	30640	30640	she	191	“ But I see , ”
30646	30652	30640	30640	she	191	“ What dost thou see ? ”
30653	30673	30674	30674	she	191	“ O Lucius ! It is the garden at Cenchræa — and my father ! O , my father ! ”
30683	30686	30688	30688	Lucius	219	“ Enough , ”
30690	30711	30688	30688	Lucius	219	“ I think naught of this : every one is aware how the noble Cnæus Corbulo came by his death . ”
30712	30717	30719	30720	the Magus	210	“ Then see again , ”
30788	30819	30785	30785	Domitia	191	“ It was he ! the physician Luke — who cut the thong . But for him , we should have run down the Imperial trireme . He did it ! ”
30820	30825	30827	30829	the young man	535	“ What mean you ? ”
30833	30876	30827	30829	the young man	535	“ Lucius , I see it all — the sea , the vessel on which is Nero carousing;—ourselves — we are running at her . And he has cut the thong , the paddle flies up , and our course is altered . ”
30917	30922	30905	30905	He	535	“ Seest thou aught ? ”
30923	30926	30927	30927	she	1405	“ Yes , ”
30933	30950	30927	30927	she	1405	“ Yet not with my bodily eyes , I know not how — but I see — ”
30951	30954	30905	30905	He	535	“ What ? ”
30955	30973	30927	30927	she	1405	“ The end of Nero . Now thou hast thrown the mantle over his face — enough ! ”
30980	31005	30975	30975	Elymas	207	“ Hitherto thou hast beheld that which is past . Sufficeth it ? or wilt thou even look into that which is to be ? ”
31006	31010	31012	31012	Lucius	219	“ It sufficeth , ”
31039	31070	31023	31023	she	1405	“ No , my friend . Now I have seen things that are past , I will even look into the future . It was for this I came hither . ”
31246	31340	31243	31243	she	1405	“ Oh , Lucius ! I thought — I — I saw that the day had come when you and I — Lucius , when I went to your house and was lifted across the threshold , and then , as I stretched my hands to you and took yours — then , all at once , a red face came up behind — whence I know not — and two long hands thrust us apart . Then I let go — I let go — and — and I saw no more . ”
31341	31371	31243	31243	she	1405	“ When that day comes , my Domitia , no hands shall divide us , no face be thrust between . Now come forth . You have seen enough . ”
31372	31382	31383	31383	She	1411	“ Nay , I will look to the end . ”
31399	31404	31406	31407	the Magus	210	“ Art thou willing ? ”
31438	31470	31435	31435	Lucius	219	“ See what a purple light shines out of the crystal . What is thy vision now , Domitia ? By the light that beams , it should be right royal . ”
31471	31476	31477	31477	she	191	“ It is royal , ”
31483	31565	31477	31477	she	191	“ Lucius ! what that Christian prophet spoke , that have I also seen — the beast with seven heads , one wounded to the death , and there cometh up another out of the deadly wound , and — it hath the red face I saw but just now . And it climbeth to a throne and lifteth me up to sit thereon . Away with the vision . It offendeth me . It maketh my blood turn ice cold ! ”
31566	31575	31577	31578	the Magus	1309	“ Hast thou a desire to see further ? ”
31580	31589	31591	31591	Domitia	191	“ I can see naught worse than this , ”
31617	31628	31611	31611	his	207	“ Askion , Kataskion , lix , Tetras , damnameneus , ”
31745	31762	31742	31742	she	191	“ I stand on the beast , and the sword of my father pierces his heart . ”
32029	32036	32023	32023	she	191	“ Ubi lux — ibi Felicitas . ”
32119	32132	32109	32109	herself	191	“ Oh , Lucius ! where is light , there is felicity ! ”
32133	32139	32109	32109	herself	191	“ Plancus , come hither ! ”
32227	32236	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Plancus , did you hear me speak ? ”
32237	32249	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ I am here , my lady , at your service . ”
32250	32272	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Really ; you have become torpid like the flies . Has the chill made you deaf as well as sluggish ? ”
32273	32285	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ My lady , I can always hear when you speak . ”
32286	32299	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Do you mean to imply that I shout like a fishwife ? ”
32300	32333	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ I mean not that . But when a harp is played , it sets every thread in every other stringed instrument a - chiming ; and so is it with me . ”
32334	32660	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ The simile is wiredrawn . What I want you for is — no , I will have no stroking of your face like a cat!—is to go to Rome and see that the palace is made ready to receive us . The stoves must be well heated , and everything properly aired , The country at best of times is tedious ; in winter , intolerable . Besides , I have no right to remain here buried . I must consider — Plancus , why are you scratching ? I must consider my daughter . She is in a fit of the blues , and has nothing to say to amuse me . You need not blow like a sea - horse , breathe more evenly and equably;—Plancus , you are becoming unendurable . I must not consider my bereaved feelings , but her welfare , her health . The air or the situation of Gabii does not suit her . Rome is an extraordinarily healthy place in winter . I myself am never better anywhere than I am there . I was pretty well at Antioch ; there were military there , and I find the soil and climate salubrious where there are military . Plancus?—as the Gods love me , you have been in the stables . I know it by infallible proofs . Stand at a distance , I insist . And , Plancus ! you are not showing off conjuring tricks , that you should fold and unfold your hands . You go to Rome and take such of the family with you as are necessary . I am not going to be mewed up here any longer , because my two years of widowhood are not over . You are making faces at me , positively you are , Plancus . Do , I entreat you , look as if you were not a mountebank mouthing at a crowd . ”
32661	32675	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ I fly , mistress , as though winged at heel like Mercury . ”
32676	32701	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Much more like Mercury ’s tortoise . Send me Claudius Senecio . I must know what ails Domitia . She has the vapors . ”
32702	32706	32708	32708	Plancus	182	“ I obey , ”
32710	32718	32720	32721	the lady	482	“ Am I much worn , Lucilla ? ”
32731	32750	32708	32708	Plancus	182	“ The laceration of the heart tells on a sensitive nature , and precipitates wrinkles and so on . ”
32751	32762	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Madam , you bloom as in a second spring . ”
32763	32770	32772	32772	Longa	181	“ A second spring , Lucilla ! ”
32778	32809	32772	32772	Longa	181	“ You hussy , how dare you ? A second spring , indeed ! Why , by the zone of Venus , I am not through my first summer yet . ”
32810	32893	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ You misconceive me , dear lady . When a virgin has been wedded , then come on her the cares of matronhood , the caprices , the ill - humors of her husband — and to some , not without cause , the vexation of his jealousy . But when the Gods have removed him , it sometimes happens that the ravages caused by the annoyances of marriage disappear , and she reverts to the freshness and loveliness of her virginity . ”
32894	32989	32990	32991	The Philosopher	606	“ There is something in what you say ; of course it is true only of highly privileged natures , in which is some divine blood . A storm ruffles the surface of the lake . When the storm is past , the lake resumes its placidity and beauty — exactly as it was before . I have noted it a thousand times . Yes , of course it is so . Here comes Senecio ; he waddles just like the Hindu nurse I saw at Antioch , laboring about with two fat babies . ”
32994	33006	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ I will trouble you to come in front of me , ”
33011	33056	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ Have you eaten so heavy a meal as to shrink from so much unnecessary exertion ? I can not talk with my neck twisted . The windpipe is not naturally constructed like a thread in a rope . I am returning to Rome . ”
33057	33088	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ To Rome , madam ! I do not advise that . The place is in commotion . There have been sad scenes of riot and pillage in the capital . ”
33089	33112	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ As the Gods love me ! what care I so long as they do not invade the house in the Carinæ ? ”
33113	33121	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ But there have been also massacres . ”
33122	33167	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Well , when princes shift about , that is inevitable . They all do it . For my part , I rather like — that is , I do n’t object to massacres in their proper places and confined to the proper persons . ”
33168	33217	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Madam , you are secure where you are . Why , there was Galba,—he had not been in Rome seven months before he was killed , and he did not enter the city save over the bodies of seven thousand men , butchered on the Flaminian Way . ”
33218	33286	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ Well ! I am not a man . Moreover , I thank the Gods , my house is not on the Flaminian Way , nor is it in the Velabrum , nor the Suburra , nor in the Forum Boarium either . We happen to live in the Carinæ , and I conceive that there have been no massacres and all that sort of thing there . ”
33287	33303	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ No , my dear lady , but when the entire city is disturbed — — ”
33304	33434	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ And here , in Gabii , down to the lizards — dead asleep . Give me massacres rather than stagnation . I shall get back to Rome before the Ides of December , on account of my daughter ’s health . By the way , will you believe it ? She gave away the sword of my dear Corbulo to Lucius Lamia . Just conceive!—how effective that sword would be in my house — in the tablinum , the atrium , anywhere — and how I could point to it , and my feelings!—I can imagine nothing more striking . I have told Lamia to restore it . I would not lose it for a great deal . Well now , come . Any news from the capital ? ”
33435	33522	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ Madam , you are aware that Galba fell , and that Otho threw himself on his sword after a reign of ninety days ; and now the new Cæsar Vitellius is men aced . I hear that the East has risen , and that Vespasian has been proclaimed in Syria . The legions in Illyria have also declared for him and are marching into Italy . Egypt has pronounced against Vitellius , and it is but seven months since Otho died by his own hand . ”
33523	33530	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ Vespasian , did you say ? ”
33535	33783	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ My good Senecio , he is a sort of cousin , a country cousin , just one of those cousins that can be cultivated into kinship , or dropped out of relationship as circumstances decide . His father was a pottering sort of a man , an auctioneer , and commissioner of drains and dirt and all that sort of thing . A worthy fellow , I dare say ; I believe he had a statue erected to him somewhere because he did the scavengering so well . He married above his position , one Vespasia Polla ; I have seen and heard of her , a round - faced woman like a pudding ; he took her for her blood , but she was only a knight ’s daughter ; and those city knights , as the Gods love me ! what a money - grubbing low set they are ! His son , Flavius Vespasianus is proclaimed ! It is really funny . It is , O Morals ! I must laugh . Now , if my good man had but listened to me . But there , I shall become mad.—I do n’t know how long it is since you have been pecking , or whether you eat all day long ? But you have crumbs sticking in your beard . Another time be good enough to comb your beard before approaching me . Tell me , what has given Domitia the dumps ? ”
33784	33827	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ I believe , madam , she has been frightened by that unscrupulous impostor , Elymas , or Ascleparion , or whatever he is called . I do not know particulars , but believe that he pretended to show her the future . ”
33828	33840	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ The future ! Delicious ! And what did she see ? ”
33841	33900	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ That I can not say , but she has looked wan ever since , neither smiles nor speaks , but sits , when the sun shines , on the balustrade above the water , looking into it , as in a dream . I hear that she holds converse with none , save her maid , Euphrosyne . ”
33901	33913	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ I wonder what she has seen ! Anything concerning me ? ”
33914	33949	33008	33009	the widow	818	“ Madam , that braggart and intriguer is made up of lies . He has frightened her with pretended predictions . If I might advise , I would counsel his expulsion from the house . ”
33950	34234	33532	33533	the lady	482	“ I should like to hear what are the chances for Flavius Vespasian . I think I shall inquire myself . I knew Vespasian once , of course he is vastly my senior . If he be successful , he may get a proconsulship for our Lamia . He ! Flavius Vespasian a Cæsar ! There is push for you ! As the Gods love me , there is nothing like push . I must go to Rome . Positively two years retirement for a widow is unreasonable . In the good old days of the Republic one was thought enough . I would not have the Republic back for anything else , though of course we all talk about Liberty and Cato , and all that sort of thing — it is talk — nothing else . I must go to Rome . Flavius Sabinus is præfect of the city , and he is the elder brother of Vespasian . I might show him some little inconspicuous civilities — give a little cosy , quiet supper . By the way — yes , he is married to an old hunks , I remember . Oh ! if his brother gets to the top , he can divorce her . Yes , positively I shall not be able to breathe till I get back to Rome . By the way , draw me up on a couple of tablets some moral philosophizing suitable to widowhood , pepper it well with lines from lyric poets . I will learn it all by heart in my litter , and serve out as occasion offers . I positively must be home before the Ides ; why — ”
34239	34289	33008	33009	the widow	818	pleasure—“The Ides of December ! that is the dedication feast of the temple of Tellus in the Carinæ . There you have it ! Devotion to the gods — an excuse for a little supper — a wee little supper — but so good and so nicely turned out . ”
34452	34454	34457	34458	the family	4024	“ wings ”
34851	34854	34849	34849	we	1468	“ supper , ”
34968	34977	34979	34980	Longa Duilia	181	“ I am so pleased to see you , ”
35027	35039	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ I thank you , madam , for the courteous invitation . ”
35040	35139	34996	34996	He	1471	“ I could kill myself with vexation not to have made your acquaintance earlier . You see , for some years I have been at Antioch , with my dearest husband , whose sword — that sword which drank the blood of Germans , Parthians and Armenians — excuse these tears — you see it — suspended yonder . But , as I was saying , we have been from Rome so long , and since my return I have lived in such seclusion , that we have not met — and yet , considering our relationship — — ”
35140	35157	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ My dear lady , I was unaware that I was entitled to such an honor . ”
35158	35168	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ Oh ! yes , of course , cousins . ”
35169	35172	34996	34996	He	1471	“ Cousins ! ”
35173	35226	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ Through Vespasia Polla , your mother . What a sweet creature she was ! So distinguished in her manner . She had such an intelligent face , and , as I remember her , the remains of great beauty . Of course I was then quite a mite of a child . ”
35227	35233	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ This is indeed flattering . ”
35234	35274	34996	34996	He	1471	“ You men have other things to consider beside pedigree . Cousins we certainly are . And how is that sweet lady , your wife ? By all accounts as frail as the last autumn leaf on an acacia . ”
35275	35292	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ I am glad to say that , on the contrary , she enjoys rude health . ”
35293	35570	35022	35023	his son	4558	“ You do not say so ! What fibs are told ! Your son Clemens is not here ? I — I have heard , does not go into society , a little peculiar in his views . We are not all made alike . But this , your son Sabinus , is formed like an Apollo . And your daughter Plautilla — so sorry ! infected in the same way . Will not go to dinners or shows — ah ! well it is her loss . It is a pleasure to reunite family ties . Alas ! you know of my irreparable loss . I do not know whether you saw the sword of my darling . He fell on it . Bathed it with his blood . Every night I bedew the sacred blade with my tears . Excuse me — my emotion overcomes me . I would have buried myself at Gabii , clasping the sword to my wounded bosom for the remainder of my shattered life , had it not been for the health of my child . A mother ’s thoughts are with her offspring . Well , now to table . A widow ’s fare , only a small supper in a house of mourning — though more than a twelvemonth since the funeral — indeed , two years since my dear one died — on that sword . Oh ! I turn away my eyes ! The sight of that blade . But , come — that is my daughter . Salute her . A cousin . Give me your hand , Flavius . The table calls us . ”

36506	36508	36533	36534	the præfect	1508	“ fast ”
36746	36808	36738	36739	Flavius Sabinus	294	“ This youth is my nephew , Titus Flavius Domitianus , the younger son of my brother Vespasian . Pardon his lack of breeding , lady — I bade him find me here , if matters of importance demanded my attention . Excuse me , I pray , if I retire with him and hear what news of weight he bears . ”
36916	36942	36903	36903	she	191	“ It is he — the eighth crowned head — the fifth come again — the new Nero . O Lamia ! Terrible is Fate ! ”
36943	36948	36950	36950	Duilia	181	“ My dear child , ”
36952	37104	36903	36903	she	191	“ I never did a better stroke of policy than that supper a few evenings ago . It went off quite charmingly , without a hitch . I allowed that good Flavius Sabinus to talk ; and he is just one of those men who enjoys himself best where he is given full flow for his twaddle . A good , worthy , commonplace man . I doubt if he has push in him , but he is just so situated now that he must go ahead . The news is most encouraging . Mucianus is on his way to Italy at the head of an army . Primus , with his legions , is approaching ; he has beaten the troops sent against him , and has sacked Cremona ; there are positively none who hold by Vitellius except his brother in Campania , and his German bodyguard . Domitia , ”
37111	37123	37108	37108	her	818	“ we can do better than with that milksop Ælius Lamia . ”
37124	37133	36903	36903	she	191	“ Mother , I will have no other . ”
37134	37244	37108	37108	her	818	“ Then we must push him up into position . But come , my dear , we must show ourselves at the Lectisternia . It will be expected of us , and be setting a good example , and all that sort of thing , and it is positively wicked to mope indoors when we ought to be seen in the streets and the forum . So there , make yourself ready . I am going instantly . I have ordered round the palanquins , and , as you may perceive , I am dressed and my hair done to go out . That supper was quite a success . ”
37382	37395	37397	37397	Duilia	181	“ You shall come in the lectica ( palanquin ) with me , ”
37399	37441	37397	37397	Duilia	181	“ It will have quite a pathetic aspect — the widow and the orphan together . Besides , I want some one to talk to . What do you think of Flavius Domitianus ? A modest lad , to my mind . ”
37442	37447	37449	37449	Domitia	191	“ Shy and clumsy , ”
37451	37462	37449	37449	Domitia	191	“ The sight of him is a horror to me . ”
37463	37486	37397	37397	Duilia	181	“ My dear child , only a fool will take sprats when he can have whitebait . Look out to better yourself . ”
37487	37494	37449	37449	Domitia	191	“ Oh , mother!—what is that ? ”
37495	37502	37504	37505	the lady	482	“ A god going to supper , ”
37507	37516	37504	37505	the lady	482	“ We shall see plenty of them presently . ”
37695	37704	37706	37706	Domitia	191	“ A thing like that ca n’t eat , ”
37708	37745	37706	37706	Domitia	191	“ Oh , my dear child , no . The gods only sniff at the food . After it has been set before them , it is carried away , and the people scramble for it . ”
37746	37755	37757	37758	the girl	3790	“ They are naught but wax and woodwork , ”
37761	37778	37757	37758	the girl	3790	“ My child , how often have I not had to quote to you that text , “
37790	37799	37706	37706	Domitia	191	” Here we are ! What a crowd ! ”
37877	37880	37882	37883	Longa Duilia	181	“ Domitia , ”
37889	38045	37882	37883	Longa Duilia	181	“ all things are working out excellently . Vitellius is aware that he has no chance , and has been consulting with our cousin in the Temple of Concord yonder , and they have nearly settled between them that Vespasian is to assume the purple without further opposition . Vitellius will retire to some country villa on a handsome annuity . That will prevent more bloodshed and confiscation , and all that sort of thing . It is always advisable to avoid unpleasantnesses if possible . There , child , there are quite a bevy of gods already at table . See that dear old doll , Summanus , without a head — you know it was struck off by lightning in the time of Pyrrhus . It was of clay , and rolled all the way to the Tiber and plopped in . Since then he has been without a head , the darling ! ”
38046	38057	37882	37883	Longa Duilia	181	“ How can he either smell or eat , mother ? ”
38058	38120	37882	37883	Longa Duilia	181	“ My child , I do n’t ask . It is not well to be overwise about the gods . There go the Arval Brothers with the image of Aca Larentia seated — of course not lying . You will see some venerable curiosities , who put in an appearance on days like this so as not to be wholly forgotten . ”
39460	39485	39448	39449	the slave	520	“ There is no safety here . Trust me . I will battle through with you . Come on my arm . Fear not . ”
39486	39494	39496	39496	Duilia	181	“ Save me ! Me , also ! ”
39498	39516	39496	39496	Duilia	181	“ I shall be thrown out , trodden under foot ! O my wig ! My wig ! ”
39654	39663	39643	39645	The drifting mob	1646	“ The Prætorians are coming from their camp ! ”
39714	39718	39720	39721	the slave	520	“ My lady ! ”
39723	39733	39734	39734	He	193	“ There is but one thing to be done . ”
39754	39760	39745	39750	a voice asked who demanded admittance	1654	“ Open speedily — Paris ! ”
39784	39791	39793	39793	Eboracus	193	“ Excuse me , dear mistress , ”
39795	39864	39793	39793	Eboracus	193	“ I could do no other . In this insula live the actor Paris and Glyceria . They were both slaves in your household , but were given their freedom by your father , my late master , when he went to the East . They will place themselves at your service , and offer you shelter in their humble dwelling , the first flat on the right . ”
40592	40629	40588	40588	Eboracus	193	“ Be not afraid , dear young mistress ; this is no catching disorder ; Glyceria suffers from an accident , and will never be well again . She is the sister of your servant Euphrosyne . ”
40682	40707	40708	40708	her	1726	“ My husband , Paris , the actor , is now out ; but he will be home shortly , I trust — unless , ”
40716	40739	40708	40708	her	1726	“ some ill have befallen him . Yet I think not that can be , he is a quiet , harmless man . ”
40740	40745	40747	40747	Domitia	191	“ I thank you , ”
40872	40879	40868	40869	Presently Domitia	191	“ Have you been long ill ? ”
40880	40886	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ A year , lady . ”
40887	40897	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ And may I inquire how it came about ? ”
40898	40912	40868	40869	Presently Domitia	191	“ Alas ! It is a sad story . My little boy — — ”
40913	40919	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ You have a son ? ”
40920	40925	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I had — — ”
40926	40938	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I ask your pardon for the interruption ; say on . ”
40939	40981	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ My little boy was playing in the street , when a chariot was driven rapidly down the hill , and I saw that he would be under the horses ’ feet , so I made a dart to save him . ”
40982	40986	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ And then ? ”
40987	41015	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I was too late to rescue him , and I fell , and the wheel went over me . I have been unable to rise since . ”
41016	41031	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ What ! like this for all these months ! What say the doctors ? ”
41032	41043	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ Alack , lady ! they give me no hope . ”
41044	41053	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ But for how long may this last ? ”
41054	41060	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I can not say . ”
41061	41084	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ As the gods love me ! if this befell me , I should refuse my food and starve myself to death ! ”
41085	41092	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I can not do that . ”
41093	41101	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ What ! you lack the resolution ? ”
41102	41114	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ I can bear what is on me laid by God . ”
41115	41144	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ There is no need to endure what can be avoided . I would make short work of it , were this my lot . And your husband ? ”
41145	41150	41155	41156	the actor	4676	“ He is here . ”
41210	41215	41216	41216	he	4676	“ There , Glyceria ! ”
41220	41258	41216	41216	he	4676	“ they are all for you . There is such a riot and disturbance and such a crush in the street , that I had hard work to push through . I misdoubt me some are broken . ”
41259	41269	41317	41317	Eboracus	193	“ Oh , Paris ! do you not observe ? ”
41270	41281	41216	41216	he	4676	“ What ? I see nothing but thy sweet face ? ”
41282	41294	41295	41296	The actor	4676	“ Our dear master ’s daughter , the lady Domitia Longina . ”
41365	41371	41373	41373	Domitia	191	“ Go forth , Eboracus , ”
41375	41397	41373	41373	Domitia	191	“ and I prithee learn how it has fared with my mother . Bring me word speedily , if thou canst . ”
41410	41475	41404	41404	she	191	“ I beseech you , suffer me to remain here in quiet , and concern not yourselves about me . I have been alarmed , and this has shaken me . I would fain rest in this seat and not speak . Go on with what ye have to say and do , and consider me not . So will you best please me . ”
41596	41599	41601	41601	she	572	“ No , ”
41603	41639	41601	41601	she	572	“ if I had one so to love me and consider me , though I were sick and in pain , I would not shorten my days . I would live to enjoy his love . ”
41653	41800	41648	41648	she	572	“ In time to come , if it chance that I become ill , will my Lamia be to me as is this actor to his poor wife ? Will he think of and care for me ? But — and if evil were to befall him , would not I minister to him , care for him night and day , and seek to relieve his sorrow ? Would I grow indifferent when he most needed me ? Then why think that he should become cold and neglect me ? Are women more inclined to be true than men?—Yet see this actor — this Paris . By the Gods ! Is Lamia like to be a more ignoble man than a poor freedman that gains his living on the stage?—I should even be happy serving him sick and suffering . Happy in doing my duty . ”
41811	41883	41805	41805	she	1748	“ Duty ! Yes , I should find content and rest of mind in that ; but to what would it all lead ? Only to a heap of dust in the end . His light would be extinguished , and then I , having nothing else to live for , would die also — by mine own hand:—there is nothing beyond . It all leads to an ash - heap . ”
41916	42107	41904	41904	her	309	“ Ah , lady ! the neighbors and their children are very kind . There is more of goodness and piety in the world than you would suppose , seeing men and women only in an amphitheatre . I can do but very little . One boy fetches me water — that is Bibulus , and my Paris has bought him this little horseman — and Torquata , a little girl , daughter of a cobbler , she sweeps the floor ; and Dosithea , that is a good widow ’s child ; she does other neighborly acts for me;—and they thrust me on my bed to the side of the hearth , and bring me such things as I need , that I may prepare the meals for my husband . And Claudia , the wife of a seller of nets , she makes my bed for me ; but all the shopping is done for me by Paris , and I warrant you , lady , he is quite knowing , and can haggle over a fish or a turnip with a market - woman like any housewife . ”
42108	42116	42118	42118	Domitia	191	“ He is very good to you , ”
42137	42179	42127	42127	his	308	“ Lady ! you can little know what a wife my Glyceria is to me . I had rather for my own sake have her thus than hale as of old . Somehow , sorrow and pain draw hearts together wondrously . ”
42180	42185	42190	42190	her	309	“ He is good , ”
42197	42262	42190	42190	her	309	“ We have had a hard year ; on account of the troubles , there has been little desire among the people for the theatre , and he has earned but a trifle . I have cost him much in physicians that have done me no good , yet he never grumbles , he is always cheerful , always tender - hearted and loving . ”
42263	42268	42270	42270	Paris	308	“ Hush , wife ! ”
42272	42281	42270	42270	Paris	308	“ The lady desires rest . Keep silence . ”
42414	42431	42433	42433	Paris	308	“ I have a little lamp here — with a fish — the fish on it , ”
42438	42447	42433	42433	Paris	308	“ It is for Luke , the Physician . ”
42448	42451	42453	42453	Domitia	191	“ What ! ”
42460	42494	42457	42457	her	191	“ you know him ? We had a talk once , and it was broken off and never concluded . I would hear the end of what he was saying — some day . ”
42557	42565	42567	42567	he	1760	“ Get away you sprats and gudgeons , ”
42581	42637	42576	42576	he	1760	“ Lady , your mother has reached home in safety . I chanced to run across Amphibolus , sent out in quest of you , and the good - for - naught had turned sulky , because it is the Saturnalia , when , said he , the mistress should do the slave ’s bidding . “
42642	42646	42576	42576	he	1760	” said he , “
42661	42705	42706	42707	Io Saturne	316	” And the lanes are clear of rabble . If Paris here will walk on one side of you and I on the other , it will be well . That rascal Amphibolus I bade wait , but not he , said he , “
42709	42710	42720	42721	the actor	4676	” ”
42711	42718	42720	42721	the actor	4676	“ I will attend with joy , ”
42762	42771	42728	42728	she	191	“ I may come again and see you ? ”
42833	42836	42838	42838	Paris	308	Presently—“Stand aside ! ”
42863	42869	42871	42871	one	3914	“ I am the king ! ”
42873	42898	42871	42871	one	3914	“ Præfect of the guard , arrest those people . Ha ! a woman . She shall be my captive and grace my triumph . ”
42952	42987	42949	42949	one	3914	“ Hey Tarquinius ! thou must e’en fare like the rest , Nero , Galba , Otho — and hem ! we know not who else — but down thou art with the others . ”
42988	42994	42996	42996	Paris	308	“ Let us go on , ”
43074	43084	43086	43087	the Briton	3825	“ Why have you kept us so long waiting ? ”
43089	43152	43086	43087	the Briton	3825	“ Eboracus , I could not help myself . It is the Saturnalia , and the slaves will do no menial work . They are carousing in the triclinium and , though they heard the rap well enough , none would rise and respond . Then , for very shame I came , for I thought it might be my dear mistress . ”
43197	43204	43206	43207	the lady	482	“ You have arrived at last ! ”
43209	43315	43206	43207	the lady	482	“ I ’ll have that British slave ’s hide well basted when the Seven Days are over , for disregarding me and considering your safety alone . Body of Bacchus ! This time of the Saturnalia is insufferable . Not a servant will do a stroke of work , nor execute a single order . They are all , forsooth , lords and ladies for seven days , and we must wait on them . Well ! if it were not an old custom , I ’d get up a procession of all the matrons of Rome to entreat the Senate to abolish the usage . ”
43316	43327	43086	43087	the Briton	3825	“ Oh , mother dear , how did you escape ? ”
43328	43531	43532	43533	The lady	482	“ My child ! it was as bad as that bit of storm we had getting out of the Gulf of Corinth , tossed about in my palanquin I hardly knew whether I were thinking with my head or with my toes . But after a while they got me through . Never , never again will I go gadding after the Gods to their Lectisternia . As the Gods love me ! this is a topsy - turvy time indeed . At the Saturnalia no strife is permissible , not a lawsuit , all quarrels are supposed to cease , not even a malefactor may be executed , and there are those precious Immortals with their glass eyes , and extended hands snuffing up the fumes of their dinner , and they allow fighting to go on before them , under their immortal noses , and never interfere ! But I do n’t wonder . There was Summanus , God of the night thunders — and will you believe it , his own head was struck off by the heavenly bolt . Ye Gods ! if ye can not mind your own heads ye are not to be trusted with ours . ”
43652	43659	43661	43662	the lady	482	“ I shall go to bed , ”
43664	43712	43661	43662	the lady	482	“ I ’d lie in bed all these horrible seven days , but that I know no one will bring me my meals . Never mind — when the Saturnalia are over , I shall remember which were insolent and disobliging , and they shall get whippings . ”
44120	44123	44125	44125	Eboracus	193	“ Madam ! ”
44129	44141	44125	44125	Eboracus	193	“ I pray you come on the roof of the house . ”
44142	44159	44125	44125	Eboracus	193	“ What is the matter ? Ye Gods ! surely Rome is not on fire again ! ”
44160	44192	44125	44125	Eboracus	193	“ Madam ! The household guard are assaulting the Capitol and have indeed set fire to the houses below , I doubt if the Præfect can hold out till Primus arrives . ”
44490	44493	44495	44495	Duilia	181	“ Really , ”
44497	44523	44495	44495	Duilia	181	“ Revolutions are only tolerable when seen from a house - top ; that is , to cultivated minds — the common rabble like them . ”
44667	44671	44673	44673	Euphrosyne	268	“ My lady , ”
44685	44700	44682	44683	Longa Duilia	181	“ A priest of Jupiter is below , and desires to speak with you . ”
44701	44708	44710	44710	Duilia	181	“ A priest of Jupiter here ! ”
44712	44733	44710	44710	Duilia	181	“ When his temple is on fire ! Bid him be off — but stay . Who let him in ? ”
44734	44742	44682	44683	Longa Duilia	181	“ Lady , the Chaldæan introduced him . ”
44743	44782	44682	44683	Longa Duilia	181	“ He had no right to do so . Let him entertain him . I desire to see the end . Run . The roof is on fire — the eagles will be down — or melt away . ”
44783	44800	44710	44710	Duilia	181	“ Lady ! the Magian commissioned me to assure you that he bears an important communication . ”
44801	44807	44682	44683	Longa Duilia	181	“ Say I am engaged . ”
44824	44833	44835	44835	she	507	“ I can not attend to your abracadabra , ”
44846	44901	44835	44835	she	507	“ Look there . The Capitol is in flames , the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus blazes . I know what he wants — he has come begging . They all beg . I have no money . I am interested in the fire , the Revolution , and all that sort of thing . ”
44902	44906	44908	44908	Elymas	207	“ Lady Longa , ”
44910	44936	44908	44908	Elymas	207	“ There are moments that are turning points in every life . A great chance offers . Take it , or put it away forever . ”
44937	44959	44835	44835	she	507	“ You worry me past endurance . What is it ? Look ! the flames are licking Jupiter in his chariot . ”
44960	44973	44974	44974	Duilia	181	“ If you will step aside I will speak . Not here . ”
45010	45018	44835	44835	she	507	“ Well , what is this about ? ”
45019	45041	44835	44835	she	507	“ You know that the Præfect of Rome who supped at your house the other day is besieged in the Capitol . ”
45042	45050	44835	44835	she	507	“ Well — this is no news . ”
45051	45081	44835	44835	she	507	“ And that for security , lest they should be put to death by Vitellius or the soldiery , he took his children and his nephew there with him . ”
45082	45112	44835	44835	she	507	“ So I have been told . That does not concern me . Why did he not take also his fat wife ? she would have fed the flames . ”
45113	45135	44835	44835	she	507	“ My lady — the Capitol can not hold out another half hour , and then all within will be butchered . ”
45136	45166	44835	44835	she	507	“ Can I help that ? They all do it . This sort of thing happens in revolutions invariably . I can not alter the course of the world . ”
45167	45193	44835	44835	she	507	“ But , madam , the son of Vespasian , Flavius Domitianus has escaped through the Tabularium , by a little door into the Forum . ”
45194	45211	44835	44835	she	507	“ He might have escaped by turning a somersault over the walls for aught I care . ”
45212	45230	44835	44835	she	507	“ His life is in extreme jeopardy . If discovered he will be assassinated , most assuredly . ”
45231	45242	44835	44835	she	507	“ Well , that is the way these things go . ”
45243	45255	44835	44835	she	507	“ I have brought him hither — disguised as a priest . ”
45256	45259	45260	45261	The lady	482	“ What ! ”
45271	45274	45260	45261	The lady	482	“ What ! ”
45275	45325	44835	44835	she	507	“ He escaped disguised as a priest of Jupiter . As such , with veiled head he has passed unmolested , even through the ranks of the soldiery and people , inclined to tear him to pieces , for they are all on the side of the reigning prince . ”
45326	45390	44835	44835	she	507	“ Domitian here ! What a fool you are , Elymas . I ’ll have you tossed off the roof , in punishment . By Hercules ! you compromise me . If it be suspected that he is here , I shall have the house ransacked , and all my valuables plundered , and the Gods alone know what may become of me . ”
45391	45405	44835	44835	she	507	“ That is true , lady , and you must run the risk . ”
45406	45411	45413	45413	Duilia	181	“ I will not , ”
45424	45490	45413	45413	Duilia	181	“ Is it not enough to have the house turned upside down with this detestable Saturnalia ! Age of Gold indeed ! Age of tomfoolery and upside - downedness . If my poor dear man had but done what he ought , there would have been none of these commotions , and I — well — I — I would have put down the Saturnalia . ”
45491	45528	44835	44835	she	507	“ Madam , this is all beside the mark . Domitian , the son of Flavius Vespasian , whom the world has saluted Emperor , and sworn to , is under your roof as a suppliant . ”
45529	45533	44835	44835	she	507	“ How unfortunate ! ”
45534	45538	45413	45413	Duilia	181	“ How fortunate ! ”
45539	45546	44835	44835	she	507	“ I can not see that . ”
45547	45593	44835	44835	she	507	“ Then , madam , the clouds of night must have got into your brain . Do you not see that you are running a very slight risk . None suspect that he is in concealment here , as I smuggled him into the house . ”
45594	45600	45413	45413	Duilia	181	“ There are my slaves . ”
45601	45616	45618	45619	the soothsayer	1858	“ They regard him as a priest escaping from the fire and the siege , ”
45624	45736	45621	45621	He	1858	“ Before morning the Illyrian legions will have arrived in Rome . Do you suppose the German bodyguard can stand against them ? What other troops has Vitellius to fall back on ? None — he is deserted . His cause is fatally smitten . By to - morrow evening he will be dead , cast down the Gemonian stair . Vespasian will be proclaimed in the Forum . Your risk will be at an end , and you will have obtained the lasting gratitude of the Imperial father , who will do anything you desire , to show his thankfulness to you for having saved the life of his son . ”
45737	45744	45746	45746	Duilia	181	“ There is something in that , ”
45748	45802	45746	45746	Duilia	181	“ And suppose now that Domitian is here , that you bid your slaves eject him , and he falls into the hands of Vitellius , how will you be regarded by the Flavian family ? Do you not suppose that you will be the first to suffer the resentment of the Augustus ? ”
45803	45812	45814	45814	Duilia	181	“ There is a good deal in that , ”
45823	45860	45818	45819	the Magus	1309	“ I have no fear of betrayal from any in the house save Senecio , that owl - like philosopher . He is not like the slaves , he may suspect , and trip me up . ”
45861	45866	45868	45868	Duilia	181	“ My good Elymas , ”
45870	45892	45868	45868	Duilia	181	“ do not concern yourself about him . He is not a man to chew nutshells when he can munch kernels . ”
45893	45907	45818	45819	the Magus	1309	“ Domitian is in my apartment , will you see him , lady ? ”
45908	45930	45818	45819	the Magus	1309	“ By all means . I have a notion . Go , fetch Domitia , bring her down there to me . ”
46057	46066	46067	46067	she	181	“ I am so grateful to the Gods , ”
46077	46138	46067	46067	she	181	“ that they should allow me the honor and happiness of offering you an asylum . Blood is thicker than water . Though I perish for my advocacy of your dear father — I can not help it . Cousins must be cousinly . It is with us a family peculiarity — we hang together like a swarm of bees . ”
46273	46342	46470	46471	the sorcerer	1399	“ I thank you . My life is in danger . I came hither , as my uncle supped here the other day , and I knew something about kinship . I had nowhere else whither to go . I would have been hunted out and murdered had I gone to my uncle — my mother ’s brother . They would have sought me there first of all . ”
46343	46458	46459	46459	Domitia	191	“ You shall stay here till all danger is past . I should esteem myself the vilest of women were I to refuse you my protection at such a time as this . Senecio , my philosopher , is out , gadding about — of course . You shall occupy his room , and I shall give strict orders that he be not admitted . I will not have philosophers careering in and out of my house , at all hours , as pleases them . This is not a rabbit warren , as the Gods love me ! But here comes my daughter to unite with me in assurance of welcome and protection . ”
46536	46541	46525	46525	she	3790	“ My dear child , ”
46546	46703	46543	46544	Longa Duilia	181	“ you will thank the Lares and Penates , that our cousin has taken refuge with us . The Capitol is in flames , the Imperial guards are storming the walls , there is , I fear , no hope for our dear good friend Flavius Sabinus . Poor man , how he enjoyed himself at supper here the other day ! We may hope for the best , but not expect impossibilities . Revolutions and all these sorts of things have their natural exits , the sword , the Tullianum and the Gemonian steps — horrible , but inevitable . Domitian has fled to us , disguised as a priest of Jupiter . O my dear , what a nice thing it is that there is so much religion left among the common people that they respected his cloth . Well , here he is , and we must do what we can for him . ”
46704	46709	46711	46711	Domitia	191	“ Cast him out , ”
46714	46720	46711	46711	Domitia	191	“ What , my love ? ”
46721	46748	46749	46749	Duilia	181	“ Cast him out — the beast , the crowned beast , the new Nero . The fifth that was and the eighth that will be . ”
46754	46783	46751	46751	her	181	“ My dear , I do n’t in the least understand enigmas . I was never clever at them , though my parts are not generally accounted bad . ”
46784	46817	46818	46818	Domitian	224	“ Mother , I pray you , I beseech you as you desire my happiness , do not harbor him under your roof . Cast him forth . What ho ! Slaves ! ”
46828	46834	46818	46818	Domitian	224	“ You would betray me ? ”
46835	46846	46751	46751	her	181	“ I would have you thrust forth into the street . ”
46847	46862	46751	46751	her	181	“ To be murdered — torn to pieces by the blood - thirsty mob ? ”
46863	46870	46818	46818	Domitian	224	“ It is to save myself . ”
46871	46880	46751	46751	her	181	“ Thyself ! I do thee no harm . ”
46881	46895	46897	46897	Duilia	181	“ Do not attend to her . It is childish , maidenly timidity , ”
46909	46963	46904	46904	her	181	“ She knows that , to screen you , we run great risks ourselves . We may be denounced — we may.—As the Gods love me ! There is no saying what we may be called on to suffer . But I say , perish all the family rather than offend against hospitality . ”
46964	46967	46969	46969	Domitia	191	“ Mother , ”
46978	47025	47026	47026	He	1880	“ Send him forth . If he were not a coward , a mean coward , he would not come here , to the house of two women , and shelter himself behind their skirts . Titus Flavius Domitianus , dost thou call thyself a man ? ”
47040	47070	47026	47026	He	1880	“ If thou art a man , go forth , run us not into danger . If thou tarry here — I esteem thee as the basest of men . ”
47071	47077	47079	47080	Longa Duilia	181	“ I praise the Gods ! ”
47086	47116	47079	47080	Longa Duilia	181	“ she does not command in this house . That do I ; and when I say welcome , there you stay , and she shall not gainsay me . ”
47117	47132	47026	47026	He	1880	“ Mother — to welcome him , is to exile , to destroy me . ”
47133	47139	47026	47026	He	1880	“ This is rank folly . ”
47140	47146	47079	47080	Longa Duilia	181	“ Mother , eject him ! ”
47147	47178	47026	47026	He	1880	“ I will not . I prithee , Domitian , when your dear father is proclaimed in Rome,—forget this girl ’s folly , and remember only that I sheltered thee . ”
47179	47191	47026	47026	He	1880	“ I will remember . I am not one to forget . ”
47192	47198	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ There is no escape , ”
47202	47226	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Whom the Gods will destroy — they pursue remorselessly . Well , be it so.—Stay then , coward ! I am undone . ”
47227	47238	47240	47241	Longa Duilia	181	“ I never made a greater mistake in my life , ”
47243	47257	47240	47241	Longa Duilia	181	“ and I can not think how you allowed me to make it . ”
47258	47262	47264	47265	the Chaldæan	207	“ What mistake ? ”
47267	47456	47264	47265	the Chaldæan	207	“ The mistake of inviting the uncle in place of the nephew to my little supper . As to that supper , I flatter myself it was perfect — so finished in every detail , as becomes our position ; so delicately flavored with reserve , as became my position as a widow ; and you recommended me to invite Flavius Sabinus , the Præfect,—and now he has been . That delicate little supper thrown away , and my attentions so nicely adjusted to the circumstances , all that trouble and thought gone for nothing . Do you know that Flavius Sabinus is now in bits ? He has been positively hacked to pieces . It is not the supper itself I regret , and my best Falernian wine — but I gave him a gold signet - ring with a cameo , representing Daphne . It had belonged to my dear Corbulo , and was valuable . But I considered it as a means to an end . And now — where is that ring ? But for your counsel , I might have invited the nephew . ”
47457	47464	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Madam , I counselled aright . ”
47465	47535	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ You have the face to say that ? Do you not know that Sabinus has had his head struck off , and his body dragged by hooks down the Gemonian stair , and then positively torn to pieces — but there ? Who has got hold of the ring ? I have lost it — through you . You pretend to read the stars and peer into futurity ! ”
47536	47552	47264	47265	the Chaldæan	207	“ Lady , I do see into what is to be , and counsel accordingly . ”
47553	47577	47264	47265	the Chaldæan	207	“ Oh , yes ! glimpses as of light in a wood through thick foliage . Plenty of obscurity , very little light . ”
47578	47648	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Madam , consider . Had you not invited the Præfect who has been , you would not have seen the nephew who is , and who came in at the supper to call his uncle away . It was thus he arrived at a knowledge of your house , and your friendly disposition , and thus it was that he was induced to throw himself on your protection . ”
47649	47656	47658	47658	Duilia	181	“ There is something in that , ”
47660	47674	47658	47658	Duilia	181	“ But how much better had the invitation been sent to Domitian himself . ”
47675	47746	47264	47265	the Chaldæan	207	“ On the contrary , that would not have been judicious , therefore I did not recommend it . Had the nephew come here along with his servants , immediately his escape from the Capitol was discovered , and they were tortured to disclose his place of concealment , they would have betrayed this house : but as it has happened they could not suppose he would take refuge here . ”
47747	47756	47758	47758	Duilia	181	“ There is a good deal in that , ”
47761	47822	47758	47758	Duilia	181	“ Well , it is only the ring that I regret . If I had but known — something of inconsiderable value but showy would have sufficed . Moreover , I might have done without that dish of British oysters — very expensive , and , as you see , thrown away . Yet ! well , I enjoyed them . ”
47823	47831	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Even that ring is not lost . ”
47832	47836	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ How so ? ”
47837	47845	47758	47758	Duilia	181	“ It is on Domitian ’s finger . ”
47846	47852	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ You really say so ? ”
47853	47962	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ When the Præfect bade his nephew and sons attempt to escape from the Capitol , he recommended the former to engage your protection , and in token of this , he put the ring that you had given him , on his nephew ’s finger , that he might present it to you — should there be mistrust , in pledge that he came from Flavius Sabinus . I encountered Domitian in the street , I knew him and conducted him to your door , and obtained his admission . There was no necessity for him to show his ring , as I stood sponsor for him . ”
47963	47971	47973	47973	Duilia	181	“ You are a good old creature , ”
47975	48006	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ I withdraw any offensive expressions I may have used . To gratify you , I will pay that old woman , Senecio , his wage and bid him pack . ”
48007	48053	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Then , madam , my services shall be amply repaid . The man himself is harmless . Engage him as a clown,—he is consumed with conceit , and so renders himself a laughing - stock . That is all he is qualified to be . ”
48054	48068	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Go — send me Domitia . She has behaved like a fool . ”
48088	48144	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ My dear , the ring is not lost . Domitian has it . By the foresight of the Gods , Sabinus removed it from his finger , and confided it to his nephew , before unhappy circumstances arose which might have led to the ring getting into the hands of any Cyrus or Dromo . ”
48145	48157	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ Was it to hear this that you sent for me ? ”
48162	48210	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ No , it was not . Your conscience must upbraid you . You have acted in an insensate manner . You have flouted and angered the son of him who in — perhaps half an hour — will be an Augustus , supreme in the state . ”
48211	48220	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ Mother , I do not like him . ”
48221	48366	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ Ye Gods of the Capitol!—confound them , by the way , they are all burnt ! O Tellus and Terminus ! Do you suppose we are to see and be courteous only to those whom we like ? What cared I for that paragon of virtue , Flavius Sabinus , who talked to such an extent that I could not get in a word edgeways . But I gave him a nice little supper — and oysters from Britain , my best Falernian , and that ring of your father ’s , because I thought he might be useful . And now Titus Flavius Domitianus is our guest — in hiding till matters are settled one way or the other — and you insult him to his face . It is not conduct worthy of your mother . You interfere with my plans . ”
48367	48371	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ What plans ? ”
48372	48421	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ My dear child , Vespasian is old — about sixty I think , and has but two sons , of whom Domitian is the youngest . The elder , Titus Flavius Sabinus Vespasianus has but a daughter . Do you not see ? Do you not smell ? ”
48422	48429	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ I do neither , mother . ”
48430	48498	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ More the pity . You sadly take after your father , who had no ambition . Give the old fellow ten years before he becomes a god ; the eldest son , if the worst comes , may succeed and be Augustus for another ten , and then,—the second son , Domitian , will be prince . My dear , what opportunities ! What gorgeous opportunities ! ”
48499	48504	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ Opportunities for what ? ”
48505	48535	47200	47200	Domitia	191	“ For push , my dear , push to the purple . Your dear father , ah , well ! We are not all made of the same clay . ”
48536	48568	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ Mother , that is precisely what fills me with dread . He will then be the eighth , for these adventurers of a few months do not count,—the new Nero . ”
48569	48614	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ But consider — the purple . My dear , do you remember how Valeria caught the dictator Sulla . She sat behind him in the theatre , and picked some flue off his toga . He turned round and caught her doing it . “
48617	48621	48615	48615	Sir	3806	” said she , “
48639	48718	48081	48082	The latter	600	” I could have loved that woman . It was so happy , so neat . That bit of wool drew Sulla and the Dictatorship to her . You , what a blunderer you are . You have offended Domitian , who may some day be greater than was Sulla , when you had it in your power by a word , a look , a dimpled smile , to win him , and with him the purple . ”
48719	48739	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ Mother , I do not covet it . You forget — I am promised to Lucius Ælius Lamia . ”
48740	48754	48159	48159	Domitia	191	“ Oh ! Lamia ! He could be bought off with a proconsulship . ”
48755	48780	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ I do not desire to be separated from him . I love him , and have loved him since we were children together . ”
48781	48806	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ Well , you have done for your chances . If I surmise aright , the young man entertains a great grudge against you . ”
48814	48817	48819	48819	he	193	“ Madam , ”
48821	48863	48819	48819	he	193	“ the Illyrian legions have entered the city , under Primus , and there is fighting in the streets . The people on the housetops cheer on this side or that , as though they were at a show of gladiators . ”
48864	48902	48081	48082	The latter	600	“ Well — those things happen . We shall know for certain which shall be uppermost , and if fate favors Vitellius — Then , daughter , I shall not scruple to give the young man up . ”
49311	49331	49308	49308	Vitellius	284	“ Thou , who thus addressest me — a tribune thou art , remember I was once thy commander ! ”
49450	49501	49440	49440	she	181	“ Salve , Cæsar ! As the Gods love me , I am the first to so salute you , son of the Augustus ! Oh , I am so happy ! And it might have been otherwise , but you they never would have reached save over my body . ”
50055	50073	50042	50042	He	224	“ May I attend you ? I have at the moment nothing of importance to occupy me . ”
50074	50082	50042	50042	He	224	“ I am bound for the Suburra . ”
50083	50098	50042	50042	He	224	“ For the Suburra ! What can take you into the slums of Rome ? ”
50099	50114	50042	50042	He	224	“ I am going to see the wife of Paris , the tragic actor . ”
50115	50126	50042	50042	He	224	“ Oh ! the wife of the actor , Paris , ”
50131	50143	50144	50144	she	1952	“ I said so — the wife of Paris the actor , ”
50159	50172	50144	50144	she	1952	“ And pray — is she a visiting acquaintance of the family ? ”
50173	50210	50042	50042	He	224	“ She is our freedwoman . Paris was freed by my father likewise . Are you content ? I may add that she has met with an accident and is crippled and confined to her bed . ”
50211	50214	50144	50144	she	1952	“ Oh ! ”
50220	50238	50144	50144	she	1952	“ and you are infected with the Christian malady , and go among the sick and starving . ”
50239	50252	50042	50042	He	224	“ I know naught of this Christian malady . What is it ? ”
50253	50372	50042	50042	He	224	“ We have had the contagion touch us . There is my cousin Clemens , and his wife Domitilla , both taken badly with it . He is a poor , mean - spirited fool . He has been offered excellent situations , with money to be made in them , in bushels , but he refuses — will not swear by the genius of my father , will not offer sacrifice to the Gods . Such thin gruel minds I can not away with . Were I Augustus , such as would not serve the Commonwealth should be sent to kick their heels in a desert island . These Christians are the enemies of the human race . ”
50373	50386	50042	50042	He	224	“ What , because they visit the sick and relieve the poor ? ”
50387	50423	50042	50042	He	224	“ The sick are smitten by the Gods and should be left to die . The poor are encumbrances and should be left to rot away . But a man of rank and of family — ”
50424	50432	50042	50042	He	224	“ Flavius Clemens ! of what family ? ”
50475	50494	50433	50433	Domitian	224	“ I say that a man who will not serve his country should be pitched out of it . ”
50495	50503	50453	50453	jobbers	1957	“ About that I have no opinion . ”
50504	50527	50528	50528	Domitia	191	“ Clemens was cast to the lions by Nero , but some witchcraft charmed them , and they would not touch him . ”
50547	50554	50556	50558	the young prince	1941	“ You must wish me success , ”
50560	50580	50556	50558	the young prince	1941	“ I am off to Germany . There has been revolt there , and I go to subdue it . ”
50581	50593	50528	50528	Domitia	191	“ By all means carry with you a pair of shears . ”
50594	50599	50556	50558	the young prince	1941	“ What mean you ? ”
50600	50619	50622	50622	his	224	“ To obtain a crop of golden hair from the German women , wherewith to grace your triumph . ”
50625	50632	50622	50622	his	224	“ You have a sharp tongue . ”
50633	50646	50556	50558	the young prince	1941	“ I need one . It is a woman ’s sole defence . ”
50647	50683	50556	50558	the young prince	1941	“ Come , if a cousin , as your mother asserts,—though by the Gods ! I know not where the kinship comes in,—wish me well . Such words as yours are of ill - omen . ”
50684	50697	50699	50699	Domitia	191	“ I wish confusion and destruction to the worst enemies of Rome , ”
50701	50713	50699	50699	Domitia	191	“ That suffices . I will offer the spoils to you . ”
50714	50725	50726	50726	He	1961	“ Thank you , I do not yet wear wigs . ”
50735	50747	50748	50748	he	1961	“ You are either silent , or stick pins into me , ”
50761	50763	50772	50772	she	191	“ Island ”
50929	50934	50936	50936	Domitia	191	“ Ah ! Hermes , ”
50960	50969	50971	50971	Glyceria	309	“ Nay , dear Lady , not Hermes , ”
50973	51012	50971	50971	Glyceria	309	“ though indeed it was sculptured to represent him — but to me that figure has another meaning . And I hold your offering of the violets as made to Him who to me is the Good Shepherd . ”
51013	51020	51044	51044	Glyceria	309	“ Whom mean you ? Atys ? ”
51021	51025	51026	51026	Domitia	191	“ Not Atys . ”
51056	51064	51066	51066	Domitia	191	“ Do you believe me , Glyceria , ”
51068	51101	51066	51066	Domitia	191	“ as I came hither , the Cæsar Domitian accompanied me , and said that I must be a Christian to care for the sick and suffering . What are these Christians ? ”
51102	51107	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ I am one , ”
51113	51119	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ What ! and Paris ? ”
51120	51167	51066	51066	Domitia	191	“ Nay , he hovers between two opinions . His business holds him and he will not give that up , he thinks that , were he to do so , he and I might starve . But with the mind I think he is one . ”
51168	51175	51066	51066	Domitia	191	“ And what are these Christians ? ”
51176	51183	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ Those who believe in Christ . ”
51184	51191	51066	51066	Domitia	191	“ And he?—is that his image ? ”
51198	51243	51194	51196	the Good Shepherd	5032	“ Oh Lady ! it is only so much His image as the words Good Shepherd written in characters are such , they call up a notion and so does that figure . But in our worship we have no images , no sacrifices . ”
51244	51249	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ What is Christianity ? ”
51250	51270	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ That is long to answer , but I may say in two words what it is to me . ”
51271	51275	51194	51196	the Good Shepherd	5032	“ Say on . ”
51276	51283	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ The Daylight of the soul . ”
51284	51289	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ How mean you ? ”
51290	51348	51194	51196	the Good Shepherd	5032	“ I once was in darkness . I knew not why I was set in the world , whither I was going , what I ought to worship , what were my duties , where was right and what was wrong . I had no light , no road , no law . Now I have all . ”
51349	51370	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ So every votary of every new religion says . Where is your guarantee that you are not in delusion ? ”
51371	51475	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ Madam , when the sun rises and there is day , you do not suppose the light , the splendor , the confidence inspired by it is a delusion . You know that you see , and see that you may walk , and act with purpose and direction . The soul has eyes as well as the body . These eyes behold the light and can not doubt it , by internal conscience that distinguishes between the truth and falsehood . By that internal conscience I am assured that the light is as real as that seen by eyes of flesh . ”
51476	51483	51485	51485	Domitia	191	“ I can not understand you , ”
51487	51520	51485	51485	Domitia	191	“ Now for other matters — I have made Eboracus bring you some dainties for yourself and presents for the children who are so kind to you . Where is your husband ? ”
51521	51537	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ He is rehearsing . Better times have arrived , and he is now occupied . ”
51538	51546	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ And you see less of him . ”
51547	51570	51485	51485	Domitia	191	“ Yes — but we must live . When away from me , I know that in heart he is with me . ”
51571	51578	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ You are sure of that ? ”
51579	51582	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ Yes . ”
51583	51596	51485	51485	Domitia	191	“ What , by the conscience that establishes between truth and falsehood ? ”
51597	51631	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ Nay — by trust . We must trust some one and some thing . We trust God , we trust His Revelation , we trust in the goodness there is in mankind . ”
51632	51640	51109	51111	the paralyzed woman	1973	“ There is evil rather than good . ”
51641	51663	51485	51485	Domitia	191	“ There is good — but that is oft astray because of the darkness , and does not know its course . ”
51799	51806	51808	51808	Duilia	181	“ What is this I hear ? ”
51816	51834	51808	51808	Duilia	181	“ Lucilla tells me you have been chatting with Domitian , and in the street too — — ”
51835	51850	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ I had no wish to speak with him . He came after me . ”
51851	51870	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ Oh ! he went after you , did he ? And pray what had he to say ? ”
51871	51895	51808	51808	Duilia	181	“ He is going to Germany to conclude a campaign already fought out and come back and triumph for another man ’s victories . ”
51896	51905	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ You did not say so to him ? ”
51906	51913	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ Not in so many words . ”
51914	51948	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ My dear , it is true . He is going , and whether he be successful or not , will return wearing the title Germanicus . I shall have a little supper . ”
51949	51953	51808	51808	Duilia	181	“ For whom ? ”
51954	51977	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ For whom , do you ask ? For him to be sure , to wish him good success on the expedition . ”
51978	51988	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ You will allow me not to be present . ”
51989	52000	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ As you will , perverse girl . My dear , ”
52006	52017	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ if kittens ca n’t catch rats , cats can . ”
52018	52022	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ My dear , ”
52030	52079	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ with wit such as you have , that might be drawn through a needle ’s eye , it is positively necessary to have you married as quickly as possible . I can no longer bear the responsibility of one so full of waywardness and humors as yourself . ”
52080	52099	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ That , mother , is as Lamia chooses . You know that I can marry only him . ”
52100	52196	52024	52025	Longa Duilia	181	“ And I do not ask you to take another . I will get it settled forthwith . I ’ll see his father by adoption and have the settlements looked to . You are a good match . I presume you are aware of that , and this explains certain poutings and bad temper . Well — reserve them for Lamia , and do n’t vex me . I wash my hands of you , when that you are married . A camel carries his own hump , but a man his wife ’s humors . ”
52243	52248	52249	52249	she	191	“ My dearest mother , ”
52253	52292	52249	52249	she	191	“ I hope — I mean , since you are so good as not to urge me further to break my engagement with Lamia , that you have not set your mind — I mean your heart — — ”
52293	52298	52300	52301	Longa Duilia	181	“ My excellent child , ”
52307	52400	52300	52301	Longa Duilia	181	“ make no scruple of blurting out what is on your tongue . You allude to Domitian . Well ! If you had common sense , you would know that to get on in life , one must fit one ’s heart with the legs of a grasshopper , so as to be able to skip from an inconvenient , into any suitable position . When a dish of ortolans is set on table , none but a fool will dismiss it untasted to be devoured by the servants in the kitchen ! ”
52401	52411	52300	52301	Longa Duilia	181	“ But , mother , he is quite young . ”
52412	52484	52300	52301	Longa Duilia	181	“ By the favor of the Gods , Domitia , youths always fall in love with women somewhat older than themselves . The Gods ordered it for their good . If they , I mean the young men — would only follow their — I mean the Gods’—direction , there would be fewer unhappy marriages . For my part , I ca n’t see anything attractive in half - baked girls . ”

53686	53733	53668	53668	she	510	“ That is right . None may gather the flowers but the bride . By the way , have you heard ? Domitian is back from Gaul . I was rejoiced at the news , and have despatched an invitation to him to attend the wedding . ”
53734	53745	53668	53668	she	510	“ Oh , mother ! it is a bad omen . ”
53792	53836	53777	53777	she	510	“ By the Gods ! what a silly thing thou art ! Quick , gather up the herbs and then go fetch thy dolls and toys of childhood , they must all this evening be offered on the altar of the household gods . ”
53837	53845	53668	53668	she	510	“ I have them not , mother . ”
53846	53851	53668	53668	she	510	“ Not your dolls ! ”
53852	53856	53668	53668	she	510	“ Not one . ”
53857	53875	53668	53668	she	510	“ But what have you done with them ? I know they were all brought from Antioch . ”
53876	53885	53668	53668	she	510	“ Mother , they have been given away . ”
53886	53893	53668	53668	she	510	“ Given away ! to whom ? ”
53894	53903	53668	53668	she	510	“ To Glyceria , the sister of Euphrosyne . ”
53904	53915	53668	53668	she	510	“ But what can have induced you to do this ? ”
53916	53974	53668	53668	she	510	“ She is paralyzed , and served by little children in the story of the Insula where she lives . I considered that it would amuse her to dress the dolls afresh , and perhaps mend broken limbs , and after that she will distribute them among the little willing children that help her in her infirmity . ”
53975	53982	53668	53668	she	510	“ As the Gods love me ! ”
53986	54049	53668	53668	she	510	“ Whoever heard before of such madness . Hellebore would not cure it . Verily the more you labor at a hole the greater the hollow . You are a fool , and your folly grows daily greater . You must present your toys of childhood to the Lares , they expect it — it is the custom , it is right . ”
54050	54057	53668	53668	she	510	“ But I have none left . ”
54058	54158	53668	53668	she	510	“ Mother Ops ! what is to be done ? Run , Eboracus,—run and buy me half a dozen dolls — dressed if possible . Domitia , you are determined to bring ill - luck on yourself . There is nothing else to be done but for you to spend an hour in playing with the dolls , and then you can present them at the altar , and the Gods will be none the wiser . Between me and you and the pillars of the peristyle , they are bigger fools than us mortals , and easier gulled . ”
54167	54172	54159	54159	Domitia	191	“ What is that ? ”
54175	54495	53668	53668	she	510	mother—“Oh ! right enough , natrix , that drives away ghosts and nightmare . And that of course is in the virginal wreath , myosotis ( Forget - me - not ) it dries tears . An Egyptian slave I had — he fell ill , so I exposed him on the isle between the two Bridges — he told me that if one ate the root in the month of Thoth — that is August , one escaped sore eyes for a twelvemonth . That is right also , the scarlet anemone , it betokens the flame of love — and that evergreen its continuance . The centaury — that is the herb of union , it will close a wound so as not to show even a scar — and in marriage , no better symbol than that . What have you here ? The lysimachia , that gives harmony and agreement of mind . They say that a plant of it fastened to the pole of a chariot will make the wildest and most impatient horses pull together . And the herb of the Twelve Gods ! quite right , always remember the gods , they come in useful . The vervain — of course , it will give you all you will . But , ye Gods of Olympus ! What have you done to pluck cypress ! My dear Domitia , are you mad ? Thyme , mint , if you will — but cypress ! the tree of the infernal gods , and — as the Gods love me ! let me look at your hands ! They are red — what have you plucked — plucked till your hands are dyed — the androsœmum ! Oh ! Domitia ! ill - fated child — look , look at your hands , the juice has stained them , they are dipped in blood . ”
54574	54581	54583	54584	Longa Duilia	181	“ That is as I hoped , ”
54586	54674	54583	54584	Longa Duilia	181	“ and that will counteract and bring to naught the disastrous tokens of the wreath . Why , by Venus ’s girdle , the girl has not been able to get her hands white yet . The stain of that nefast herb is on them still . But — ah ! here she comes in her flame - colored veil . By the Body of Bacchus ! after all it means no ill , for do not her hands agree in hue with her head - gear ? ”
55205	55215	55203	55203	her	5076	“ Since thou art Caius , I am Caia . ”
55224	55233	55242	55242	Domitia	191	“ Since thou art Lucius I am Lucia , ”

55842	55855	55856	55856	She	2113	“ And to give thee , dear lady , a little present . ”
55976	55978	55986	55986	they	2126	“ Island ”

56488	56603	56486	56486	he	2150	“ were childless and so we adopted Lucius . He has been a good son to us , and this is a happy day to all three,—to him who has secured the sweetest flower of Rome , and to Claudia and me who obtain so good a daughter . But , ah ! we are old and have our humors , I , with my gout , am liable to be peevish . You must bear with our infirmities . You will have a worthy husband , one cut out of the old rock of which were the ancient Romans , and not of the Tiberine mud of which the present generation are moulded . ”
56604	56608	56610	56612	the old woman	2157	“ Come now , ”
56614	56626	56610	56612	the old woman	2157	“ the guests are about to depart , bid them farewell . ”
56660	56698	56649	56649	Domitia	191	“ Elymas ! You see my happiness . Isis has for once been in error — we , my Lamia and I , are united , and there have been no hands thrust forth to part us . ”

56771	56775	56776	56776	he	219	“ My dearest , ”
56779	56806	56776	56776	he	219	“ this is a day of trial to thee — but we shall be left undisturbed shortly . The guests depart and the riot will cease . ”

57020	57038	57039	57039	Lamia	219	“ Sir ! Lucius ! she has been stolen from you ! she has been carried away . ”

57055	57074	57079	57079	Lamia	219	“ It is no jest — she has been conveyed hence . She is not in your house . ”
57119	57124	57126	57126	Lamia	219	“ Where is she ? ”
57451	57474	57446	57446	one	3914	“ What else can be expected when such an ill - omened bird is kept in the house , as a magpie ? ”

58151	58208	58140	58141	the director	2250	“ If she sleep on , she will never wake . Roused and made to walk she must be . We need fear no pursuit . I have left those behind who will spread a false rumor , and send such as think she has been carried away along the wrong road . Make her walk . ”
58223	58228	58229	58229	she	2250	“ Let me sleep , ”
58232	58258	58229	58229	she	2250	“ It must not be , lady . To let you sleep is to consign you to death . You must be constrained to walk . ”
58259	58264	58265	58265	she	2251	“ Let me sleep ! ”
58269	58276	58265	58265	she	2251	“ If you sleep you die . ”

59233	59253	59230	59231	the girl	3790	“ I know you , I know your voice . What means this ? Whither am I being taken ? ”

59268	59285	59259	59260	the sorcerer	1399	“ your own eyes shall answer the question better than my lips , to - morrow . ”
59694	59699	59700	59700	she	191	“ Where am I ? ”

59728	59733	59712	59726	a dark - faced servant with hard lustrous eyes , and in a foreign dialect	2289	“ In whose house ? ”
59752	59761	59747	59747	she	191	“ Lady , we are forbidden to say , ”
59768	59772	59774	59774	Domitia	191	“ At Alba ? ”
60715	60731	60705	60705	Domitia	191	“ Where are some of my family ? Is not Euphrosyne here — or Eboracus ? ”
60732	60746	60778	60779	the sorcerer	1399	“ Lady — none came with you save the servants of our master . ”
60747	60751	60778	60779	the sorcerer	1399	“ And he ? ”
60752	60760	60705	60705	Domitia	191	“ Madam , I may not say . ”
60761	60774	60778	60779	the sorcerer	1399	“ There is that Magus , Elymas ; send him to me . ”
60796	60799	60801	60801	Domitia	191	“ Elymas , ”
60803	60835	60801	60801	Domitia	191	“ I require you to enlighten me . What is the meaning of this ? Why have I been carried away to Albanum ? By whose orders has this been done ? ”
60854	60860	60849	60849	his	1399	“ Destiny will be fulfilled . ”
60861	60897	60778	60779	the sorcerer	1399	“ What mean you ? Destiny ! some drive it before them as a wheelbarrow , and such seem you to be . Why am I here and not in Lamia ’s house in Rome ? ”
60898	60914	60915	60915	She	191	“ Did you not , lady , behold in vision that which was to be ? ”
60923	60928	60915	60915	She	191	“ What mean you ? ”
60929	60933	60778	60779	the sorcerer	1399	“ The purple . ”
60934	61137	60915	60915	She	191	“ The purple ! I desire no purple . You speak enigmatically . You have acted a treacherous part in forwarding this act of violence . I have been snatched from my dear husband ’s side , the Gods who gave me to him have been outraged , I — I , a member of a noble house , a daughter of Domitius Corbulo , have been treated as though the prey of a party of slave - hunters . What next ? Am I to be taken into the market - place , and sold by auction ? Or am I carried off by freebooters — to be let go for a price ? Name me the captain of this robber band , and the price at which I may be ransomed . I promise it shall be paid . But that condign chastisement be inflicted for this insult , that I will also guarantee . I thank the Gods , Rome is not on the confines of the world , that these deeds can be perpetrated with impunity . We are not at Nizibis or Edessa to be fallen upon by Parthians , or held to ransom by Armenians — — ”
61138	61142	61144	61145	the Magian	4788	“ Young lady , ”
61147	61216	61144	61145	the Magian	4788	“ your words are high - sounding , but your threats are such as can not be executed , nor is any price asked for your redemption . When you set your foot on the Clivus Scauri , it is a narrow way , between high walls — and there is no option , you must go on . You can not turn aside to right or left . ”
61217	61223	61271	61272	the sorcerer	1399	“ I can turn back . ”
61224	61237	61144	61145	the Magian	4788	“ The way is broken up behind . You must go forward . ”
61238	61241	61144	61145	the Magian	4788	“ Whither ? ”
61242	61245	61271	61272	the sorcerer	1399	“ Look ! ”
61262	61269	61271	61272	the sorcerer	1399	“ Do you know that livery ? ”
61511	61514	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Well ! ”
61516	61664	61484	61485	her mother	519	she.—“But first a seat . You sly fox ! who would have thought it ? But there — I am content . I have sent out no invitations to a little supper , there is now no occasion for it , and one does not care to spend — without an expectation of it leading to results . To look at your face no one would have supposed that depth in you — and to play us all such a trick , poor Lamia and me . It would really make a widow of a week old laugh . Do n’t smother me , my dear , and above all , do n’t cry — that is to say , if you cry do not let your tears fall on my cheek , you know I am — well — well — it might spoil my complexion . ”
61665	61668	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Mother , ”
61672	61710	61484	61485	her mother	519	girl—“O , how can you speak to me in this manner . You know , you must know , I have been carried away against my will . O mother , Lucius does not suppose that — — ”
61711	61768	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ My dear child , it does not concern me in the least , whether the kitten carried off the rat , or the rat the kitten . Here you are in the rat ’s hole , and all you have to look to is to eat your rat and not let the rat eat you . ”
61769	61782	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Oh , mother ! mother ! take me home with you . ”
61783	61814	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Domitia , do not be a baby . Of course you can not return . You have bidden farewell to the household Gods , and renounced the paternal threshold . ”
61815	61829	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Mother — I have embraced the gate - posts of the Lamiæ . ”
61830	61928	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ But the Gods of that family have been unable or unwilling to retain you , they have resigned you to — I can not say , in conscience , nobler hands , for the Flavian family — well , we know what we know,—but to more powerful hands , that will not let you go . Besides , my dear , I have no wish to have you home again . When a bird has flown , it has said farewell to the nest , to its cracked eggshells and worms , and must find another . ”
61929	61935	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Do not be cruel ! ”
61936	61967	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ I am not cruel — but what has happened must be accepted , that is the true philosophy of life , better than all that nonsense declaimed by philosophers . ”
61968	61977	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Mother ! I will not stay here . ”
61978	62160	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Domitia , here you must stay till somebody comes to take you away . Why ! as the Gods love me ! I expect yet to hear you proclaimed Augusta , and to have to offer incense and to pour a libation on your altar . Think — what an honor to have your wax head among the ancestors , as a divinity to be worshipped — but no — I am wrong there , you would be in the lararium , or set up in the vestibule , a deified ancestress or member of the family is exalted from the atrium to the temple . I really will go out of my way and have a little supper to honor the occasion . I see it all — we shall before long have a college of Flavian priests , and all the whole bundle of mouldy old usurers , and tax - collectors , and their frowsy womankind will be gods , with temples and a cult , and you , my dear ! It makes my mouth water . ”
62161	62172	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ But , mother , why am I carried away ? ”
62173	62202	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Why ! O you jocose little creature , why ? because some person I know of has taken a fancy to your monkey ways and baby face . ”
62203	62216	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ I belong to Lamia . I have been married to him . ”
62217	62253	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ Oh ! that is easily settled . I thank the Immortals , divorce is easily obtained in Rome — with money , influence in Rome — to the end of time , my dear . ”
62254	62277	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ I do not desire to be divorced — I will not be divorced . I love Lucius and he loves me . ”
62278	62296	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ You are a child — just away from your dolls , and know nothing of life . ”
62297	62317	61484	61485	her mother	519	“ But , mother , there are laws . I will throw myself on the protection of the Senate . ”
62323	62358	62318	62319	Longa Duilia	181	“ Silly fool ! laws bind the subjects and the weak , not princes and the strong . Make your mind up to accept what has happened . It is the work of destiny . ”
62359	62366	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ It is an infamous crime . ”
62367	62455	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ My child , do not use such words , what might be crime among common folk is pleasantry among princes . They all do it . It is their right . It is of no avail your attempting resistance . Domitian has taken a fancy to you — he is young , good - looking , Cæsar , all sorts of honors have been heaped on him , and he has but to put out a rake and comb together all the good in the world . And”—she
62460	62479	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	daughter,—“he may be Emperor some day . Titus has but one lumpy , ugly girl — no son . ”
62480	62496	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ I care not . I hate him ! let me go back to Lamia ! ”
62497	62502	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ That is impossible . ”
62503	62509	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Not if I will ! ”
62510	62524	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ You can not . You would be stayed by the servants here . ”
62525	62555	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ But you — cannot you help me ? O mother , if you have any love for me ! For the sake of my dear , dear father ! ”
62556	62593	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ Even if I would , I could not . Why , there is not a court in Rome , not the Senate even can afford you protection and release . The Flavians are up now . ”
62594	62605	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ I will appeal to Vespasian , to the Emperor ! ”
62606	62612	62613	62614	The girl	3790	“ He is in Egypt . ”
62624	62632	62621	62621	her	3790	“ Lamia ! he shall release me . ”
62633	62642	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ He needs some one to release him . ”
62643	62647	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ How so ? ”
62648	62682	62621	62621	her	3790	“ He insulted Domitian in the Senate House — all because of you , and is under arrest . For less matters , than what he has done , lives have been lost . ”
62683	62692	61670	61672	the unhappy girl—“O	5184	“ He will never — no , never ! ”
62715	62724	62725	62725	she	3790	“ The Gods ! the Gods help me ! ”
62728	62850	62725	62725	she	3790	“ My dear Domitia , you might as well call on the walls to assist you . The Gods ! They are just as bad as mortals . You may cry , but they will look between their fingers , accept your prayers and offerings and laugh at you as a fool . Why , as the Gods love me ! Does not the family derive from Lamius , and was not he the child of Hercules and Omphale ? It was very naughty and shocking , and all that sort of thing — but they all do it , and are not in the least disposed to assist you . On the contrary , they will back up the ravisher . ”
62851	62868	63024	63025	Domitia Longina	191	“ Then I have no help — save in myself . I will never be his . ”
62869	63007	63024	63025	Domitia Longina	191	“ Be advised by me , you foolish child . When you come under a cherry tree you pluck all the ripe fruit ; and what you can not eat yourself you give to your friends . Do you not perceive that having been fortunate enough to catch the fancy of the young Cæsar , you can use this fancy and make large profit out of it ? He is already very freely distributing offices to all his friends and such as most grossly flatter him . What may not you obtain for me ! That is if I take a liking for any one and wish to marry him , you must positively obtain the proconsulship of Syria or Egypt for him . And as to Lamia , he can be choked off with a prætorship . ”
63037	63041	63042	63042	he	224	“ Saucy still ? ”
63045	63051	63052	63052	she	3790	“ Wrathful at this treatment , ”
63067	63096	63052	63052	she	3790	“ Because I would have denied to you a suppliant , the hospitality of our house , must I , unsoliciting it , be forced to accept yours ? ”
63097	63112	63127	63127	Domitian	224	“ Domitia , has your mother informed you what I have designed for you ? ”
63113	63126	63052	63052	she	3790	“ I should prefer that you concerned yourself with your prætorial duties . ”
63163	63179	63147	63147	his	224	“ It is my intent , Domitia , to elevate you into the Flavian family . ”
63180	63185	63199	63200	her mother	519	“ O how gracious ! ”
63188	63193	63147	63147	his	224	girl,—“taken up like Trygdeus . ”
63194	63197	63199	63200	her mother	519	“ Domitia ! ”
63220	63233	63216	63216	she	519	“ Quite so , on the wings of the Bird of Jove . ”
63267	63274	63276	63276	he	535	“ What I intend for you , ”
63290	63314	63276	63276	he	535	“ what I intend for you is what there is not another woman in Rome who would not give her jewels to obtain . ”
63315	63356	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ Then I pray you address yourself to them . Pay your debts with their subscriptions , and leave me who am content to be disregarded , in the tranquillity I so love — with my husband , Ælius Lamia . ”
63357	63360	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ Lamia ! ”
63364	63378	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ You are to be divorced from him . Your mother is willing . ”
63379	63397	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ My mother has no more power over me . I am out of the paternal family . ”
63398	63404	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ You will consent yourself . ”
63405	63411	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ Who will make me ? ”
63412	63424	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ That will I. It is easy to rend apart — — ”
63425	63436	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ Any fool can break , not all can bind . ”
63437	63448	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ Domitia , be advised and do not incense me . ”
63449	63513	63362	63362	Domitian	224	“ I care not for myself . I have but one wish . Let me go . Take , if you will , what is my property , take that of Lamia , but let us retire together to some little farm and be quiet there , drive us , if you will , out of Italy — but do not separate us . ”
63514	63523	63524	63524	He	2374	“ You talk at random . Follow me . ”
63548	63553	63555	63555	Domitian	224	“ Come,—Lamia awaits you , ”
63565	63577	63558	63559	the girl	3790	“ He is here ! You will be generous,—like a prince ! ”
63578	63583	63584	63584	She	3790	“ Come with me . ”
63700	63703	63705	63707	the young Cæsar	1963	“ Domitia , ”
63709	63736	63705	63707	the young Cæsar	1963	“ you will see how that to divorce you is in my power , unless you consent to it yourself , and give yourself to me . ”
64055	64059	64061	64062	her mother	519	“ My child , ”
64064	64109	64061	64062	her mother	519	“ of course it is all very sad , and that sort of thing — but it is and must be so . If a wilful girl will not be brought to reason in any other way — well , it is a pity . ”
64115	64123	64125	64125	he	224	“ His life is in your power , ”
64127	64183	64125	64125	he	224	“ He has insulted me before the Conscript Fathers , and is under arrest . I have brought him hither — to die . But I give his life to you on the one condition that you allow divorce to be pronounced between you and him , and that in his place you accept me . ”
64190	64195	64197	64197	he	224	“ So be it , ”
64199	64206	64197	64197	he	224	“ Surgeon , open his veins . ”
64253	64259	64261	64262	the prince	4158	“ Cut the other arm , ”
64264	64272	64261	64262	the prince	4158	“ then cast him into the bath . ”
64273	64277	64279	64279	Domitia	191	“ I yield , ”
64293	64305	64279	64279	Domitia	191	“ Then bind up his wound , and let him go ! ”
64306	64312	64314	64314	Elymas	207	“ Destiny must be fulfilled , ”
64319	64327	64314	64314	Elymas	207	“ You were born for the purple . ”
65284	65290	65292	65292	Lamia	219	“ Why do you inquire ? ”
65299	65310	65292	65292	Lamia	219	“ do you also wish to carry off my wife ? ”
65976	65981	65972	65972	she	181	“ eat her rat . ”
66276	66286	66288	66288	Titus	180	“ What can I do for thee , Domitia ? ”
66993	67001	67004	67004	Titus	180	“ What can I do for thee ? ”
67015	67050	67004	67004	Titus	180	“ my child , I know that thou hast had trouble and art mated to a fellow with a gloomy , uncertain humor ; but what has been done can not be undone — — ”
67051	67055	67057	67057	Domitia	191	“ Pardon me , ”
67059	67098	67057	67057	Domitia	191	“ it is that I desire ; let me be separated from him . I never , never desired to leave my true husband , Lamia , I was snatched away by violence — let me go back . ”
67099	67115	67004	67004	Titus	180	“ What ! to Lamia ! That will hardly do . Would he have thee ? ”
67116	67126	67128	67128	Domitia	191	“ Tainted by union with Domitian , perhaps not ! ”
67131	67139	67128	67128	Domitia	191	“ Right indeed — he would not . ”
67140	67145	67147	67147	Titus	180	“ Nay , nay , ”
67153	67210	67149	67149	his	180	“ such a word as that is impious , and in another would be trea son . Domitia , you have a bitter tongue . I have heard my brother say as much . But I can not think that Lamia would dare to receive thee again after having been the wife of a Flavian prince . ”
67231	67234	67236	67236	she	191	“ Then , ”
67238	67310	67236	67236	she	191	“ let me go to my old home at Gabii . I have lived in seclusion enough at Albanum to find Gabii in the current of life — and my mother and her many friends will come there anon . Let me go . Let there be a divorce — and I will go home and paddle on the lake and pick flowers and seek to be heard of no more . ”
67311	67340	67217	67217	she	191	“ It would not do for you and Lamia to be married again . It would be a political error ; it might be dangerous to us Flavians . ”
67341	67375	67236	67236	she	191	“ I should have supposed , in your brand - new divinity that a poor mouse like myself could not have scratched away any of the newly - laid - on gold leaf . ”
67376	67379	67381	67381	Titus	180	“ Domitia , ”
67389	67413	67381	67381	Titus	180	“ be careful how you let that tongue act — it is a file , it has already removed some of the gilding . ”
67427	67432	67434	67434	he	180	“ There ! There ! ”
67438	67546	67434	67434	he	180	“ I am not a fool . I know well enough what we were , as I feel what we have become . Caligula threw mud , the mud of Rome , into the lap of my grandfather , because he had not seen to the efficient scouring of the streets . It was ominous — the soil of Rome has been taken away from the divine race of Julius — and has been cast into the lap of us money - lenders , pettyfogging attorneys of Reate . Well ! the Gods willed it , Domitia — it is necessary for us to make a display . ”
67547	67556	67381	67381	Titus	180	“ Push , as my mother would say . ”
67557	67634	67434	67434	he	180	“ Well — push — as you will it . But , understand , Domitia , though I am not ignorant of all this , I do n’t like to have it thrown in my teeth ; and my brother is more sensitive to this than myself . Domitia , I will do this for you . I will send for him , and see if I can induce him to part from you . I mistrust me,”—Titus
67649	67680	67434	67434	he	180	said,—“By the Gods ! I do not wonder at it . I would be torn by wild horses myself rather than abandon you , had I been so fortunate — — ”
67681	67688	67434	67434	he	180	“ Sire , so wicked — — ”
67689	67720	67721	67721	He	2518	“ Well , well ! you must excuse Domitian . Love , they say , rules even the Gods , and is stronger than wine to turn men ’s heads . ”
67730	67736	67737	67737	he	2518	“ Send hither the Cæsar , ”
67761	67767	67769	67769	Titus	180	“ Come hither , brother , ”
67771	67789	67769	67769	Titus	180	“ I have a suppliant at my feet , and what suppose you has been her petition ? ”
67830	67833	67835	67835	Domitian	224	“ Brother , ”
67837	67948	67835	67835	Domitian	224	“ I know well enough at what she drives . From the moment , the first moment I knew her , she has treated me to quip and jibe and has sought to keep me at a distance . I know not whether she use a love - philtre so as to hold me ? I know not if it be her very treatment of me which makes me love her the more . Love her ! It is but the turning of a hair whether I love or hate her most . I know what is her petition without being told , and I say — I refuse consent . ”
67949	67958	67960	67960	Titus	180	“ Listen to what I have to propose , ”
67962	68015	67835	67835	Domitian	224	“ and do not blurt out your family quarrels before I speak about them . It is not I only , but all Rome , that knows that your life together is not that of Venus ’s doves . It is unpleasant to me , it detracts from the dignity of the Flavian family”—he
68031	68071	68027	68027	his	180	“ that this cat - and - dog existence should become the gossip of every noble house , and a matter of tittle - tattle in every wine - shop . Make an end to it and repudiate her . ”
68102	68189	68090	68090	He	180	“ Vixen ! I see thee — naught would give thee greater joy than for me to assent . I should see thee skip for gladness of heart , as I have never seen thee move thy little feet since thou hast been with me ! I should hear thee laugh — and I have heard no sound save flout from thee as yet . I should see a sun dance in thine eyes , that perpetually lower or are veiled in tears . Is it not so?”—He
68199	68211	68090	68090	He	180	face—“and therefore , for that alone , I will not consent . ”
68212	68220	68222	68222	Titus	180	“ Listen further to me , Domitian , ”
68224	68241	68222	68222	Titus	180	“ I have a proposition to make . Separate from Domitia , send her back — — ”
68242	68251	68090	68090	He	180	“ What , into the arms of Lamia ? ”
68252	68270	68090	68090	He	180	“ No , to Gabii . She shall be guarded there , she shall not remarry Lamia . ”
68271	68280	68222	68222	Titus	180	“ I shall take good heed to that . ”
68281	68400	68090	68090	He	180	“ Hear me out , Domitian . I have but one child , Julia . The voice of the people has proclaimed itself well pleased with our house . We have given to Rome peace and prosperity at home , and victory abroad . I believe that there are few who regard me unfavorably . But it is not so with thee . Thy folly , thy disorders , thy violence , before our father came to Rome , have not been forgotten or forgiven , and Senate and people look on thee with mistrust . I will give thee Julia to wife . It is true she is thy niece — but since Claudius took Agrippina — — ”
68401	68413	68090	68090	He	180	“ Thanks , Titus , I have no appetite for mushrooms . ”
68414	68427	68090	68090	He	180	“ Tut ! you know Julia , a good - hearted jade . ”
68428	68434	68436	68436	Domitian	224	“ I will not consent , ”
68439	68467	68436	68436	Domitian	224	“ Hear me out , brother , before making thy decision . If thou wilt not take Julia , then I shall give her to another — — ”
68468	68472	68474	68474	Domitian	224	“ To whom ? ”
68518	68530	68531	68531	Domitian	224	“ I shall give her to our cousin , Flavius Sabinus . ”
68582	68587	68564	68564	He	224	“ Still I refuse . ”
68588	68597	68598	68598	Domitian	224	“ The consequences — have you considered them ? ”
68620	68637	68598	68598	Domitian	224	“ I hate her . I will risk all , rather than let her go free . ”
69080	69083	69085	69085	Domitia	191	“ Euphrosyne , ”
69087	69134	69085	69085	Domitia	191	“ come hither ! observe this fish . Thy sister gave it me the day I was married , but alack ! it brought me no luck . Think you it is an omen of ill ? But Glyceria would not have given me one such . ”
69135	69147	69035	69035	she	191	“ Nay , lady , the fish brings the greatest happiness . ”
69148	69166	69167	69168	The slave	520	“ What is its meaning ? It is a strange symbol . It must have some purport . ”
69186	69214	69035	69035	she	191	called—“Thou ! Elymas ! who pretendest to know all things , answer me this , I have an amulet — a fish — what doth it portend ? ”
69215	69225	69035	69035	she	191	“ What?—the murex ? That gives the imperial purple . ”
69226	69247	69035	69035	she	191	“ Bah ! It is no murex , not a sea snail but a fish . What is the signification ? ”
69248	69261	69035	69035	she	191	“ Lady , to one so high , ever - increasing happiness . ”
69262	69342	69343	69345	The gloomy man	2545	“ Away ! you are all wrong . Happiness is not where you deem it . False thou art , false to thy creed . Thou speak of a divine ray in every man and woman ! an emanation from the Father of Light , quivering , battling , straining to escape out of its earthly envelope and soar to its source!—thou speak of this , and in all thy doings and devisings seekest what is sordid and dark ! ”
69364	69471	69347	69347	his	2545	“ Thou launchest forth against me without reason . Knowest thou what is a comet ? It is a star that circles about the sun and from it drinks in all the illumination it can absorb , like as the thirsty soil in summer sucks in the falling rain , or the fields the outflow of the Alban Lake ; then it flies away into space , and as it flies it sheds its effulgence , becoming ever more dim till it reaches infinite darkness and is there black in the midst of absolute nigritude . Then it turns and comes back to replenish its urn . ”
69472	69475	69477	69477	Domitia	191	“ Nay , ”
69479	69627	69477	69477	Domitia	191	“ that can never be . When all light is gone , then all desire for return goes likewise . I know that in myself — I — I am such a comet . When I was a child I longed , I hungered for the light , and in my days of adolescence it was the same , only stronger — it was as a famine . I was the poor comet sweeping up towards my sun ; but where my sun was , that — in the vast abyss of infinity — I knew not . I sought and found not , I sought and shed my glory , till there was but a faint glimmer left in me ; and now — now all light is extinguished , and with it desire to know , to love , to be happy , to return . ”
69628	69662	69347	69347	his	2545	“ Madam , you , as the comet , are reaching your apogee , your extreme limit ; you must shed all your light before you can return to the source of light . ”
69663	69705	69706	69706	she	2546	“ What ! is that your philosophy ? The Father of Light sends forth his ray to expire in utter darkness , predestined this ray of light to extinction . If so — then He is not good . And yet , ”
69709	69844	69706	69706	she	2546	“ it is so . I am such . In blackness of night . Look you , Elymas , when I was a child , I laughed and danced ; I can not dance , I can but force a laugh now . I once loved the flowers and the butterflies ; I love them no more . My light is gone . The faculty of enjoyment is gone with it . Do I want to return ? To what ? To the source of light that launched me into this misery ? No , not into that cold and cruel fate . Let me go on my inky way , I have no more light to lose — I look only to go out as a fallen star and leave nothing behind me . ”
69845	69856	69968	69968	she	2547	“ What ! when a great future is before you ? ”
69857	69888	69889	69889	She	2547	“ What future ? you have none to offer me that I value . Away with your hints concerning the purple — it is the sable of mourning to me . ”
69899	69947	69948	69948	she	2547	“ It is you who have wrecked my life — you — you . It was you who devised that crime — when I was snatched away from the only man I loved — the only man with whom I could have been happy — whom I — ”
69971	70026	69968	69968	she	2547	“ I admit it , I love still , and ever shall love . And he loves me . He has taken none to wife , for he thinks on me . There , could darkness be deeper than my now condition ? And you did it , you betrayed me into the hands — ”
70046	70057	70027	70027	she	2547	“ Lady , it is not I , but Destiny . ”
70058	70084	70027	70027	she	2547	“ And you , with your tortuous ways , work to ends that you desire , and excuse it by saying , It is Destiny . ”
70085	70097	70099	70100	the Emperor	1035	“ What , discussing the lore of emanations , little woman ? ”
70133	70140	70126	70126	he	1035	“ A philosopher , are you ? ”
70141	70156	70126	70126	he	1035	“ No , I ask questions , but get no answers that content me . ”
70157	70181	70126	70126	he	1035	“ Ah ! you asked a favor of me the other day and spiced it with a sneer — your jibes hit me . ”
70182	70190	70126	70126	he	1035	“ I meant not to give pain . ”
70191	70268	70126	70126	he	1035	“ I have come to you touching this very matter . I am not sure , child , that the scandal is not greater so long as you and Domitian remain linked together , and pulling opposite ways , than if you were parted . Your quarrels are now the talk of Rome , and many a cutting jest is put into your pretty mouth at our expense ; invented by others , attributed to you . ”
70269	70276	70126	70126	he	1035	“ You will have us divorced ! ”
70284	70307	70277	70277	her	2551	“ Listen to what I propose . Domitia , I am not well . I have this accursed Roman fever on me . ”
70308	70318	70126	70126	he	1035	“ Sire , I mark suffering in your face . ”
70319	70375	70376	70376	his	2552	“ It has been vexing me for some days , and it is my intent to leave Rome and be free from business and take my cure at Cutiliæ — our old estate in the Sabine country . Perhaps the air , the waters of the old home , the nest of our divine family — ”
70388	70537	70126	70126	he	1035	face—“they may do me good . It is something , Domitia , to stand on the soil that was turned by one ’s forbears , when they bent as humble farmers over the plough . They were honest men and happy ; and when one is down at heart , there is naught like home — the old home where are the bones of one ’s ancestors , though they may have been yeomen , and one a commissioner , and another an usurer , and so on . They were honest men . Aye ! the rate - collector , he was an honest man . Here all is false , and unreal , and — Domitia — I feel that I want to stand on the soil where my worthy , humble , dear old people worked and worshipped , and laid them down to die . ”
70538	70544	70546	70546	Domitia	191	“ You are downcast indeed , ”
70548	70704	70546	70546	Domitia	191	“ And because downcast , I have been brooding over your troubles , little sister - in - law . Come ! I did something for your poor Lamia,—I made him consul , and I will do more . Can you be patient and tarry till my strength is restored ? I shall return from my family farm in rude health , I trust , and by the Gods ! the first matter I will then take in hand will be yours . I know what my brother is . By Jupiter Capitolinus ! if Rome should ever have him as its prince , it will weep tears of blood . I know his savage humor and his sullen mind . No , Domitia , you can not be happy with him . A cruel wrong was done you , and when I return from Cutiliæ I will right it . You shall be separated ! ”
70724	70785	70786	70786	he	2554	“ I will do more than that for your very good friend , in whom you still take such a lively interest . I shall find means to advance him to some foreign post — he knows Antioch , I will give him the proconsulship of Syria and Cilicia , and so move him away from Rome . And then — ”
70797	70916	70786	70786	he	2554	said,—“I do not see that you need mope at Gabii . You know Antioch ; you were there for some years . It is , I believe , not well for a governor to take his wife with him ; she has the credit of being a very horse - leech to the province . But I can trust thee , little woman ! There , no thanks , I seek mine own interest , and to protect our divine images and the new gilding from the rasp of that tongue . That is the true motive of my making this offer . Do not thank me . On my return from Cutiliæ you may reckon on me . ”
70940	70943	70945	70945	Domitia	191	“ Euphrosyne ! ”
70947	70980	70945	70945	Domitia	191	“ did you hear ! The comet has reached its extreme limit , it is turning — it is drawing to the light — to hope . Happiness is near — ah ! ”
71027	71031	71033	71033	Domitia	191	“ Ye Gods ! ”
71035	71047	71033	71033	Domitia	191	“ the omen ! O ye Gods ! the bad omen . ”
71048	71051	71053	71053	Euphrosyne	268	“ Lady , ”
71055	71060	71053	71053	Euphrosyne	268	“ all is not lost ”
71061	71070	71033	71033	Domitia	191	“ What remains ? Ah ! the Fish ! ”
71071	71087	71033	71033	Domitia	191	“ Yes , mistress dear , when all else is lost , remember the Fish . ”
71088	71105	71107	71107	Domitia	191	“ Now , for a while I am as one who has cast off a nightmare , ”
71111	71164	71107	71107	Domitia	191	“ He is away — why he has attended Titus to the Sabine land I know not , unless the Emperor could not trust him in Rome — or may be , in his goodness he has done it to relieve me of his presence . I will go see my mother . ”
71328	71332	71334	71334	he	1035	“ The Flavians , ”
71337	71345	71334	71334	he	1035	“ must make a show in public . ”
71484	71486	71478	71478	Ladies	1486	“ flavan ”
71555	71557	71544	71544	they	2574	“ fraus ”
71696	71732	71692	71692	she	191	“ Eboracus , tell the fellows not to go at once to the Carinæ . I have a fancy to see the wife of Paris the actor , in the Insula of Castor and Pollux . ”
71936	71939	71941	71941	she	191	“ Quick , ”
71943	71973	71941	71941	she	191	“ I must go in ; I will not speak with that man . If he asks for me , say I am out — out of the litter . ”
72633	72636	72637	72637	she	191	“ Glyceria , ”
72640	72681	72637	72637	she	191	“ when I come here , it is to me like seeing a glimpse of blue sky after a day of rain , or — like the scent of violets that came on me the first time I visited you . ”
72682	72705	72776	72777	the actor	4676	“ And when you , lady , come to me , it is as though a sunbeam shone into my dark chamber . ”
72706	72761	72637	72637	she	191	“ Nay , nay — no flattery from thee , or I shall hate thee . I get that till it cloys . But tell me now , times have been better , and why has not Paris moved into superior quarters ? Surely he is in better employ and pay than of old . ”
72762	72774	72776	72777	the actor	4676	“ It is so , but only to a small degree , ”
72781	72808	72809	72811	the poor woman	2645	“ Paris performs in the grand old dramas in Greek only ; in those of Æschylus and Eurypides and Sophocles , he is a tragic actor,—and — ”
72814	72940	72809	72811	the poor woman	2645	“ perhaps home troubles have taken the laughter out of him . He is a sad bungler in comedy . Now the taste of Rome is not for the masterpieces of the ancients . The people clamor to see an elephant dance on a tight - rope , and a man crucified who pours forth blood enough to swamp the stage — the Laureolus ! that is the piece to bring down the house . Or some bit of buffoonery and indecency . To that the people crowd . However , we live ; I hang as a log about my Paris ’s neck , but thank God , he loves his log and would not be rid of it , so I am content . ”
72941	72952	72954	72954	Domitia	191	“ But if you will suffer me to assist you , ”
72961	73063	72958	72958	her	309	“ No , dear lady , do not take it ill if I refuse your kind offer , made , not for the first time . I am very happy here , very — with these dear kind people about me , running in and out all the day , offering their gracious good wishes , lending their ready help . On my word , lady ! I do believe that they would all be in tears and feel it as a slight if I were to go ; and for myself , I could never be happy away from them . ”
73080	73087	73089	73090	the cripple	2646	“ None but the poor know , ”
73092	73121	73089	73090	the cripple	2646	“ how kind , how tender the poor are to one another . Poverty is a brotherhood — we are all of one blood , and one heart . ”
73122	73126	73128	73130	the great lady	2647	“ And I — ”
73150	73153	73155	73155	she	2647	merry—“And I — ”
73157	73162	73155	73155	she	2647	dreamily—“I love the poor . ”
73163	73166	73185	73185	She	191	“ Then , ”
73173	73184	73185	73185	She	191	“ thou art not far from the Kingdom of Heaven . ”
73208	73214	73215	73215	he	219	“ I am not surprised , ”
73218	73225	73227	73227	he	219	“ if you be His disciple , ”
73291	73299	73285	73285	she	191	“ Why did you cut the thong ? ”
73313	73376	73306	73306	She	191	“ You do not recollect me . Do you not recall when we nearly ran down the galley of that monster Nero ? On that night , we would have sent him to the bottom of the sea , but for you,—you spoiled it all ; you cut the thong of the rudder . Why did you prevent us from doing it ? ”
73377	73380	73382	73383	the physician	938	“ Because , ”
73385	73423	73306	73306	She	191	“ It is written , Vengeance is mine , I will repay , saith the Lord . It was not for you to do it . You were not called to be the minister of His sentence . ”
73424	73430	73306	73306	She	191	“ I understand you not . ”
73431	73436	73306	73306	She	191	“ My daughter — — ”
73437	73440	73442	73442	Domitia	191	“ Hold ! ”
73448	73477	73479	73479	she	191	“ Dost thou know to whom thou addressest thyself ? I — I thy daughter ? I am Domitia Longina , daughter of the great Corbulo , and — ”
73484	73491	73479	73479	she	191	“ wife of the Cæsar Domitian . ”
73492	73497	73499	73499	Luke	219	“ Well , lady , ”
73501	73566	73499	73499	Luke	219	“ forgive me . I thought , seeing that sign on thy breast , and hearing thee say that thou didst love the poor , that thou wast one whom , whatever thy rank and wealth and position I might so address , not indeed as one of the Brethren , but as a hearer and a seeker — enough — I was mistaken . ”
73567	73573	73575	73575	Domitia	191	“ What means this fish ? ”
73585	73596	73499	73499	Luke	219	“ I pray you forgive me . I spoke hastily . ”
73597	73601	73603	73603	he	2657	“ The fish , ”
73653	73676	73645	73645	He	308	“ Lady ! I beseech thee to go at once . Something has occurred most grave . Return immediately to the palace . ”
73677	73685	73616	73616	his	308	“ What is it ? Tell me . ”
73686	73714	73645	73645	He	308	“ Madam , I dare not name it , lest it be untrue . To speak of it if untrue were to be guilty of High Treason . ”
73715	73719	73721	73721	Domitia	191	“ High Treason ! ”
73731	73749	73723	73723	She	191	“ The Cæsar Domitian has passed at full gallop through the streets , his attendants behind him . ”
73750	73756	73645	73645	He	308	“ Whither has he gone ? ”
73757	73763	73645	73645	He	308	“ To the Prætorian barracks . ”
73764	73768	73772	73772	she	191	“ Ye Gods ! ”
73782	73796	73772	73772	she	191	“ Then the worst has happened . My light is out once more . ”
73920	73930	73932	73933	the lady	482	“ Eboracus ! What is the meaning of this ? ”
73935	73954	73932	73933	the lady	482	“ Madam , I know not . None will confide what they seem to know or to suspect . ”
73955	73959	73961	73961	she	191	“ Go forward , ”
73963	73978	73961	73961	she	191	“ I will visit my mother in the Carinæ . She will know everything . ”
74095	74108	74110	74110	Eboracus	193	“ The Vestal Abbess , Cornelia , is with the Lady Duilia , ”
74112	74125	74127	74127	Domitia	191	“ I will go in!—I know her well , and esteem her , ”
74175	74187	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ Well ! I am no stranger . Lead the way . ”
74211	74219	74203	74203	Duilia	181	“ Mother — what does this mean ? ”
74220	74237	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ Here is the Lady Abbess , Cornelia , let me present her to your Highness . ”
74238	74266	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ Mother — I salute the Lady Cornelia — what is this that has cast a shadow over Rome and frightened the people as with an eclipse ? ”
74267	74291	74203	74203	Duilia	181	“ My dear , of course you have heard . It may be only rumor and yet,—he was suffering when he left Rome . ”
74292	74322	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ Ye Gods ! do not say so ! Mother , withdraw your words of bad omen . Naught has befallen him ! It was but a slight fever . ”
74323	74332	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ So we esteemed it , but — — ”
74333	74339	74340	74340	Domitia	191	“ But , mother — — ”
74343	74357	74340	74340	Domitia	191	“ The news are weighty , and concern you vastly , my daughter . ”
74358	74378	74149	74150	A slave	749	“ It is too horrible for me to think . Surely , surely , mother , it is false . ”
74379	74434	74340	74340	Domitia	191	“ Hearken , my dear,—Lady Cornelia , come also to the top of the house . It is a fine situation for seeing and hearing , and out of all reach of eavesdroppers . I hear shouts , I hear horns blowing . Come — speedily ! let us to the house - top . ”
74582	74613	74576	74576	his	193	“ Madam , the Augustus — Titus , has been . The Cæsar Domitian is proclaimed Emperor by the troops . The vigiles are hastening in cohorts to swear allegiance . ”
74614	74627	74633	74633	her	181	“ I congratulate you — I congratulate you with all my heart ! ”
74639	74818	74633	74633	her	181	“ I have reached the summit of my ambition . I vow a kid to Febronia for her opportune — ahem!—but who would have thought the Roman fever would have been so speedy in bringing us luck . Run , Eboracus , summon the housekeeper ; order the ancestral masks to be exposed , all the boxes opened , dust the noses with the feather brush ; let the lares be garlanded . Tell Paulina to bring out the best incense , not the cheapest this time , and I vow I will throw a double pinch on the altar of the household gods . Who would have thought it ! I — I , mother to an empress . I would dance on the house - top , but that my wig is not properly pinned , and might come off . I must , I positively must embrace you again , Domitia ; and you too , Cornelia , I am so happy!—As the Gods love me ! Wig pinned or not , I must dance . ”
74819	74825	74827	74827	Domitia	191	“ Let us go down , ”
74833	74841	74827	74827	Domitia	191	“ Come down , by all means , ”
74846	74935	74827	74827	Domitia	191	“ I must see that the Gods be properly thanked . I stepped this morning out of bed left leg foremost . I knew some happiness would come to me to - day . As the Gods love me ! I ’ll give a little supper . Domitia ! whom shall I invite ? None of your second - class men now . There!—I thought as much ; my wig has come off . Never mind ! no men can see me , and women do n’t count . ”
74949	74955	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Mother — a word . ”
74979	74995	74972	74972	her	482	“ Well , my dear , I am all ears — even to my toes . ”
74996	75033	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Mother , he murdered him . I know it — I feared there was mischief meant , when Domitian attended him to Cutiliæ and took Elymas with him . It was not fever that — — ”
75034	75162	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ My dear , do n’t bother your head about these matters . They all do it . We women , I thank the Gods , are outside of politics . But — well — well , you must not say such things , not even think them . It is all for the best in the best of worlds . I never had the smallest wish to see behind the scenes . Always eat your meat cooked and spiced , and do n’t ask to see it as it comes from the shambles . If you are quite positive , then I wo n’t throw away the kid on Febronia . It is of no use wasting money on a goddess who really has not helped . ”
75163	75166	75168	75168	Domitia	191	“ Mother , ”
75177	75266	75168	75168	Domitia	191	“ I am sure of it . Did not the Augustus give his daughter Julia to Flavius Sabinus ? I know that Domitian was alarmed at that . I saw it in his looks , I heard it in his voice ; his movements of hand and foot proclaimed it . He feared a rival . He feared what the will of Titus might be — whom he might name as his successor . Mark me , my mother ; the first to fall will be Flavius Sabinus . ”
75267	75277	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Hist ! the word is of bad omen . ”
75278	75298	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ It was of bad omen to Sabinus and to Titus alike when Julia was given to her cousin . ”
75299	75305	75307	75308	Longa Duilia	181	“ Well , my dear , ”
75310	75411	75307	75308	Longa Duilia	181	“ I do not see that we need concern ourselves about politics . You see,—every night , stars drop out of the heavens ; the firmament is overcrowded , and those stars that are firmest planted elbow out the weakest . It is their way in heaven , and what other can you expect on earth ? Of course , it were much to be desired — and all that sort of thing ; but we did not make the world , neither do we rule it . All eggs in a nest do not hatch out , some addle . ”
75412	75423	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Mother , I will not go back to him . ”
75424	75433	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Folly ! you can not do other . ”
75434	75452	75307	75308	Longa Duilia	181	“ I will not . My condition was bad enough before , it will be worse now . ”
75453	75621	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ Domitia , set your mind at rest . I have no doubt that there have been little unpleasantnesses . Man and wife do not always agree . Your poor father would not be ruled by me . If he had — ah me!—Things would have been very different in Rome . But he suffered for his obstinacy . You must be content to take things as you find them . Most certainly it would be better in every way if peacocks had eyes on both sides of their tails , but as they have not , only very silly peacocks turn about and expose the eyeless side . Make the best of matrimony . It is not many marriages are like young walnuts , that you can peel off the bitter and eat only the sweet . In most , the skin adheres so tightly that you have to take the sweet with the gall , and be content that there is any sweet at all . ”
75622	75636	74945	74945	Domitia	191	“ I shall go away . I will not return to the palace . ”
75637	75755	75756	75756	Domitia	191	“ Go whither ? the world belongs to Domitian . There is not a corner where you can hide . There are officials , and when not officials — spies . I have no doubt that the fish in that tank put up their heads and wish they were butterflies to soar above the roof and get away and sport among the flowers , instead of going interminably about the impluvium . But , my dear , they ca n’t do it , so they acquiesce in tank existence . Yours is the finest and best lot in the world,—and you would surrender it ! From being a lioness you would decline to be a house cat ! ”
75779	75789	75771	75771	She	191	“ Lady Cornelia , will you come with me ? ”
75790	75797	75799	75800	the Vestal	2698	“ I am at your service , ”
75817	75823	75825	75825	Domitia	191	“ To the Atrium Vestæ , ”
76059	76079	76056	76056	She	378	“ You will pay me a visit , as you go your way ? that is a gracious favor . ”
76080	76085	76087	76087	Domitia	191	“ A lengthy visit , ”
76089	76100	76102	76103	the Vestal	2698	“ Time will never seem long in your sweet society , ”
76161	76170	76172	76172	Domitia	191	“ I claim the protection of the Goddess , ”
76174	76190	76172	76172	Domitia	191	“ I will not return to the palace ! I will be free from him . ”
76195	76225	76191	76191	Cornelia	378	“ If your Goddess has any might , any grace , she will protect me . Do you fear ? Have you lost your rights ? I claim them . ”
76226	76231	76233	76234	the Abbess	2717	“ Be it so , ”
76236	76263	76233	76234	the Abbess	2717	“ None have appealed to the Goddess in vain , none taken sanctuary with her , who have been rejected . She will maintain your cause . ”
76842	76853	76838	76838	her	191	“ Under the protection of the Goddess you are safe . ”
76854	76865	76827	76827	Cornelia	378	“ I trust I in no way endanger your safety . ”
76866	76869	76870	76870	Cornelia	378	“ Mine ! ”
76873	76908	76870	76870	Cornelia	378	“ There is none above me save the supreme pontiff , and so long as I do no wrong , no one can molest me . But tell me — what wilt thou do ? ”
76909	76941	76870	76870	Cornelia	378	“ In the first place send out and bid my servants return home ; and if they ask when to come for me , answer , when I send for them . ”
76942	76948	76950	76951	the Abbess	2717	“ That is easily done , ”
76967	76970	76972	76972	she	2717	“ Now , ”
76974	77026	76972	76972	she	2717	“ now we come to the real difficulty . Here you are , but here you can not tarry for long . For six days we may accord sanctuary , but for no more . After that we must deliver over the person who has taken refuge with us if required . ”
77027	77144	76870	76870	Cornelia	378	“ I have for some time considered what might be done . I have been so miserable , so degraded , so impatient , that I have racked my brain how to escape , and I see but one course . When we were at Cenchræa , my mother and I , we were in the house of a Greek client of our family , who was very kind to us , and his wife loved me well . If I could escape thither in disguise , then I think he would be able to secrete me , there are none so astute as are the Greeks , and who so love to outwit their masters . ”
77145	77152	76972	76972	she	2717	“ But how is this possible ? ”
77153	77207	76972	76972	she	2717	“ That I know not — only let me get away from Rome , then trust my craft to enable me to evade pursuit . Let it be given out that I am here in fulfilment of a vow , then no suspicion will be roused , and I can take my measures . ”
77208	77214	77216	77216	Cornelia	378	“ It is not possible , ”
77221	77247	77216	77216	Cornelia	378	“ Have you considered what your mother said ? the Augustus is all - seeing and all - powerful , and has his hand everywhere . ”
77248	77305	77306	77307	The Vestal	378	“ Get me out of Italy , and I shall be safe . I will not return to the Palatine . If my life was hateful to me before , what will it be made now ? Then he had some fear of his father and of his brother , now he has none to fear . ”
77310	77331	77306	77307	The Vestal	378	“ Let me have time to think this over — and yet , it doth not seem to me feasible . ”
77332	77399	77216	77216	Cornelia	378	“ Get me but a beggar ’s suit , and walnut juice , that I may stain my face and hands and arms . I will wash all this gold - dust from my hair — and I warrant you none will know me , with a staff and a wallet , I will go forth , right willingly . I will not return to him . ”
77400	77415	77216	77216	Cornelia	378	“ That is impossible . You — with your beauty — your nobility — — ”
77416	77427	77306	77307	The Vestal	378	“ My nobility is of no account with me now . ”
77428	77455	77216	77216	Cornelia	378	“ You think so , and so it may be whilst untouched , but I am certain the least ruffle would make your pride flash out . ”
77467	77476	77461	77462	the physician	938	“ Well — my beauty will be disguised . ”
77477	77483	77306	77307	The Vestal	378	“ That nothing can conceal . ”
77484	77700	77306	77307	The Vestal	378	“ Oh ! do not speak thus , or I shall mistrust you , as I mistrust every one else — except my slave Euphro syne , and Eboracus , and Glyceria the actor ’s wife . These seem to me the only true persons in the world . I would cast myself on them , but two are slaves and the other is paralyzed . Consider now , Cornelia , do you not understand how that one may reach a condition of mind or soul , call it which you will , when we become desperate . One must make an effort to break away into a new and free and better life , or succumb and become bad , and dead to all that is noble and true and good , hard of heart , callous to right and wrong . I am at that point . I know , if I were to return to him , and to be Empress of the Roman world , that I should have but one thing to live for — the pride of my place and the blazoning of my position ; and to all that which lies deep within me , bleeding , crying out , hungering , and with dry lips — dead . ”
77701	77718	77871	77871	she	378	“ My dear lady , you were never made for what you are forced to become . ”
77719	77835	77836	77836	She	2772	“ Then , why do the Gods thrust me on to a throne that I hate , tie me to a man that I loathe , surround me with a splendor that I despise . Tell me why ? O Vesta ! immaculate Goddess ! how I would that I had been as one of thy consecrated virgins , to spend my days in this sweet house , and pure , peaceful cloister ! Do you see ? I must away . I am lost to all good — if I remain . I must away ! it is my soul that speaks , that spreads its hands to thee , Cornelia ! save me ! ”
77863	77870	77871	77871	she	378	“ I beseech you , rise , ”
77892	77944	77871	77871	she	378	“ Hearken to me , Domitia , I can think but of one person that can assist us ; that is my cousin Celer . He is a good man , and whatever I desire , he will strive to execute as a sacred duty . Yet the risk is great . ”
77945	77959	77871	77871	she	378	“ I pray you!—I pray you get him to assist me to escape . ”
77960	78019	77871	77871	she	378	“ He must furnish you with attendants . It will not be secure for you to be accompanied by any of your own servants . They might be traced . Celer has got a villa . Stay , I will go forth at once and see him . He can give counsel . Do nothing till my return . ”
78338	78404	78332	78332	her	378	“ We women are fools , that is what Celer said , when I told him your plan . As he at once pointed out , it is impossible for you to lie hid anywhere in Italy — and impossible to escape from it , unknown to the Augustus . Any one endeavoring to assist you to escape would lose his life , most assuredly . “
78414	78423	78332	78332	her	378	” said he bluntly — he is a plain man—“I
78447	78451	78478	78479	the Vestals	381	” he said , “
78569	78632	78519	78520	the lady	482	” But my kinsman Celer advised nothing beyond this . In very truth , nothing else can be done . Most men ’s noses are crooked,—he said — and he is a blunt man — and those who have straight ones do not like to follow them . But in your case , Lady Domitia , there is practically no other way . ”
78633	78640	78642	78642	Domitia	386	“ Then I will to Gabii , ”
78647	78660	78642	78642	Domitia	386	“ If he will force me back — there is the lake . ”
78666	78676	78642	78642	Domitia	386	“ Dost thou know that blind - man Messalinus ? ”
78677	78693	78519	78520	the lady	482	“ Full well — he hangs on to the Cæsar Domitian , like a leech . ”
78694	78835	78642	78642	Domitia	386	“ Since thou didst enter the house of us Vestals , he hath been up and down the Via Nova and the Sacred Way , never letting this place out of his eye — blind though he be . Some say he scents as doth a dog , and that is why he works his head about from side to side snuffing the wind . When I went forth he detached two of his slaves to follow — and they went as far as myself and stood watching outside the door of the knight Celer , and when I came forth they were still there , and when I returned to the Atrium of Vesta , I found Messalinus peering with his sightless eyes round the corner . But , I trow , he sees through his servants ’ eyes . ”
78836	78845	78847	78847	Domitia	386	“ He is a bird of ill omen , ”
78849	78856	78847	78847	Domitia	386	“ a vulture scenting his prey . ”
79282	79290	79292	79292	she	378	“ But I demand more than that , ”
79294	79383	79292	79292	she	378	“ Madam , more than that , my cousin , the Great Mother , dared not ask . The prince was in a rough mood , he was highly incensed at your having withdrawn without his leave , and he saw behind Cornelia ’s words the real signification . He behaved to her with great ill - humor , and would give no answer one way or the other — and that means that here you are to remain , till it is his pleasure to recall you . ”
79384	79391	79393	79393	Domitia	191	“ And may that never be , ”
79395	79405	79393	79393	Domitia	191	“ The Augustus is moreover much engaged at present . ”
79406	79426	79292	79292	she	378	“ What has he been doing ? But stay — tell me now — is there news concerning Sabinus ? ”
79427	79435	79292	79292	she	378	“ Ah lady ! he has been . ”
79436	79448	79393	79393	Domitia	191	“ I knew it would be so . On what charge ? ”
79449	79546	79292	79292	she	378	“ The Augustus was incensed against him , because under the god Vespasian he had put his servant in the white livery , when Flavius Sabinus was elected to serve as consul for the ensuing year . Unhappily , the herald in announcing his election gave him the title of Emperor in place of consul , through a mere slip of the tongue . But it was made an occasion of delation . Messalinus snapped at the opportunity , and at once the noble Sabinus was found guilty of High Treason , and sentenced to death . ”
79547	79566	79393	79393	Domitia	191	“ And what has become of Julia , daughter of the god Titus , the wife of Sabinus ? ”
79567	79579	79292	79292	she	378	“ She has been brought by the Augustus to the Palatine . ”
79634	79647	79649	79649	Domitia	191	“ It would be welcome to me were this to take place , ”
79651	79673	79649	79649	Domitia	191	“ Come , now , Euphrosyne , bring me spindle and distaff , I will be as a spinster of old . ”
79742	79794	79717	79718	the girl	3790	“ It is a delight to me to be still . Child!—I can well think it , after a toilsome and discouraging life , it is pleasant to fold the hands , lay the head on the sod , and go to sleep , without a wish to further keep awake . ”
79795	79807	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Yes , when there is a prospect of waking again . ”
79808	79831	79717	79718	the girl	3790	“ But even without that , is life so pleasant that one would incline to renew it ? Not I for one . ”
79845	79907	79832	79832	Domitia	191	said—“Once I wondered at that picture yonder , and that all pleasure attained should resolve itself into a sense of disappointment . It is quite true that we pursue the butterfly , after we have ceased to value it , but that is because we must pursue something , not that we value that which is attained or to be attained . ”
79908	79929	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Ah , lady , we must pursue something . That is in our nature — it is a necessity . ”
79930	79946	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ It is so ; and what else is there to follow after except pleasure ? ”
79947	79952	79832	79832	Domitia	191	“ There is knowledge . ”
79953	80007	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Knowledge ! the froth - whipping of philosophers , the smoke clouds raised by the magicians , the dreams and fancies of astronomers — pshaw ! I have no stomach for such knowledge . No ! I want nothing but to be left alone , to dream away my remainder of life . ”
80008	80044	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ No , lady , that would not content you . You must seek . We are made to be seekers , as the bird is made to fly , and the fish to swim . ”
80045	80073	79832	79832	Domitia	191	“ If we do not seek one thing , we seek another , and in every one , find — what the pinched butterfly is — dust . ”
80074	80096	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ No , mistress , not if we seek the truth . The knowledge of the truth , the Summum Bonum . ”
80097	80108	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ But where , how are we to seek it ? ”
80109	80113	80115	80116	the slave	520	“ In God , ”
80118	80154	80115	80116	the slave	520	“ The Gods ! of them we know only idle tales , and in place of the tales , when taken away , there remains but guesswork . There again — the pinch of dust . ”
80155	80234	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Lady , if we are created to seek , as the fish to swim , there must be an element in which to pursue our quest , an end to attain . That is inevitable , unless we be made by a freakish malevolent power that plants in us desire that can feed only on dust , ever , ever dust . No , that can not be , the soul runs because it sees its goal — ”
80235	80240	80115	80116	the slave	520	“ And that ? — ”
80270	80274	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Little fool ! ”
80279	80441	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Come , let me embrace thee , yet gently lest you crumple me , and be cautious of thy kisses , lest thou take off the bloom of my cheek . Thou art ever boisterous in thy demonstrations . There , give me a seat , I must put up my feet . As the Gods love me ! what a hole this Gabii is ! How dingy , how dirty , how shabby it all looks ! As the Gods — but how art thou ? some say ill , some say sulky , some say turned adrift . As the Gods love me ! that last is a lie , and I can swear it . The Augustus distills with love , like a dripping honeycomb . You must positively come back with me . I have come — not alone . Messalinus is with me — a charming man — but blind , blind as a beetle . ”
80442	80448	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ What , that fourfolder ! ”
80449	80504	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Now , now , no slang ! I detest it , it is vulgar . Besides , they all do it , and what all do ca n’t be wrong . One must live , and the world is so contrived that one lives upon another ; consequently , it must be right . ”
80505	80536	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Well have the Egyptians represented the God who made men as a beetle — blind , and this world as a pellet of dung rolled about blindly by him . ”
80537	80566	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ My dear , I am not a philosopher and never wish to be one . Come , we have brought the Imperial retinue for taking you back . ”
80567	80577	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Whither ? To your house in the Carinæ ? ”
80578	80650	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Oh , my Domitia ! How ridiculous ! Of course you go to the Palatine , to your proper place . My dear , you will be proclaimed Augusta , and receive worship as a divinity . The Senate are only pausing to adjudge you a goddess , to know whether the Emperor intends to repudiate you or no . It is absolutely necessary that you come back with me . ”
80651	80666	80668	80668	Domitia	191	“ My godhead is determined by the question whether I be divorced or not ! ”
80671	80681	80668	80668	Domitia	191	“ I can not go with you , mother . ”
80682	80685	80687	80687	Duilia	181	“ Then , ”
80693	80726	80687	80687	Duilia	181	“ that jade , big - boned and ugly as a mule — you know to whom I refer , will get the upper hand , and your nose will be broken . ”
80727	80738	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Mother , I ask but to be left alone . ”
80739	80752	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ I will not suffer it . By my maternal authority — — ”
80753	80772	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Alas , mother ! I have passed out of that — I did so at my marriage . ”
80773	80782	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Well then , in your own interest . ”
80783	80792	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ If I consider that I remain here . ”
80793	80886	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Avaunt nonsense ! Your position , your opportu nities ! Just think ! There is cousin Cnæus must be given a help up . He is a fool — but that do n’t matter , you must get him a proconsulship . Then there is Fulvia , you must exert yourself to find her a wealthy husband . As the Gods love me ! you can push up all your father ’s family , and mine to boot . Come , get the girls to dress you becomingly and make haste . ”
80887	80893	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ I can not go . ”
80894	80903	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ You must . The Augustus wills it . ”
80904	80910	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ And if I refuse ? ”
80911	80917	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ You can not refuse . ”
80918	80924	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ I do so now . ”
80925	80949	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ My dear , by the Good Event ! you shall come . You can no more refuse him than you can Destiny . ”
80950	80962	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Let him send his lictors and lead me to death . ”
80963	81194	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Lead you to — how can you talk such rubbish ? You must come . This is how the matter stands . There has been a good deal of disturbance in Rome . As the Gods love me ! I do not know why it is , but the people like thee vastly , and the rumor has got about that thou wast about to be repudiated , and that raw - boned filly taken in your place . First there were murmurings , then pasquinades affixed to the statues of the august Domitian . Then bands of rioters passed under his windows howling out mocking songs and blasphemies against his majesty , and next they clustered in knots , and that Insula of Castor and Pollux is a nest of insubordination . In fact , return you must to quiet men ’s minds . You know what a disturbance in Rome is , we have gone through several . By Jupiter ! I shall never forget the rocking I went through that night of the Lectisternium . These sort of things are only unobjectionable when seen from a distance . But they leave a taste of blood behind them . When the riot is over , then come proscription ; the delators have a fine time of it , and the rich and noble are made to suffer . ”
81195	81211	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ But , mother , let Julia do what she will , I care not . ”
81212	81301	81402	81402	She	2836	“ Rome does . The Roman rabble will not have it so . You have been familiar with the base and vile multitude . Ca n’t think how you could do it ! However , it has succeeded this time and turned out a good move , for the people are clamorous for your return . The Augustus is but recently proclaimed and allegiance is still fresh — and I believe his cousin Ursus has been at him to have you back so as to humor the public . ”
81302	81312	80276	80277	the mother	1944	“ Yet , if I refuse to gratify him . ”
81313	81401	81402	81402	She	2836	“ Then , my dear , of course , it will be a pity , and all that sort of thing ; but they all do it , and it must be right . The Augustus would prefer not to use severity — but if severe he must be , he will put down this disturbance with a hand of iron . He bears no actor ’s sword , the blade of which is innocuous . I will call in Messalinus . He will tell you more . ”
81452	81456	81458	81458	Duilia	181	“ Catullus Messalinus , ”
81460	81492	81458	81458	Duilia	181	“ have the goodness to inform my daughter of the intentions of the Augustus relative to the rabble in the Insula of Castor and Pollux , whence all the agitation proceeds . ”
81493	81496	81498	81500	the blind informer	2840	“ Madam , ”
81502	81675	81498	81500	the blind informer	2840	“ my god - like prince has already given command to clear the streets by means of the prætorian swords . As to that herd in the block of Castor and Pollux , they are reserved for condign punishment , unless my dear lady return at once . They will all — men , women and children , be driven into the circus . There are a pair of British war chariots , with scythes affixed to the axles , and the green drivers will be commanded to hustle round the ring at full speed among this rebellious rabble , to trample them down , and mow them as barley with the scythes — till not one remains alive as a seed of disaffection . What I say is — if a thing has to be done , do it thoroughly . It is true kindness in the end . Of course some must suffer , and one may praise the Gods that in this case it is only the common people . ”
81676	81681	81683	81683	Domitia	191	“ The common people , ”
81810	81815	81816	81816	she	191	“ I go back , ”
81819	81841	81816	81816	she	191	“ My people ! my poor people , my dear people ! It must be so.—For their sake — pro populo . ”
83060	83063	83013	83021	soldiers , who clashed shields and swords in rhythm	2918	“ pomp , ”
83940	83950	83952	83953	the mob	1561	“ He is out ! the red is out ! ”
83957	83990	83991	83992	The white	2958	“ The white ! the white is lagging — he can not catch up!—the red did for him ? Out of the way ! Out ye two ! ye cumber the course . ”
84060	84069	84071	84072	the general	683	“ It lies now between green and blue ! ”
84075	84081	84071	84072	the general	683	“ On with the Panfaracus ! ”
84082	84095	84071	84072	the general	683	“ Nay ! hit the off horse , he sulks , Euprepes ! ”
84096	84123	84071	84072	the general	683	“ Well done , Nereus ! Pull well , Auster ! Brave horses ! brave greens ! greens for ever ! The Gods befriend the greens ! ”
84166	84202	84162	84162	he	2965	“ The blue ! the blue ! It is the color of the Augusta ! The blue ! Sabaste ! I swear by her divinity ! I invoke her aid ! The blue will win . ”
84241	84279	84280	84281	The drivers	2915	“ The blue ! It shall win ! The color of the Augusta ! of the divine Augusta , the friend of the Roman people ! The blue ! the blue ! we will have the blue ! ”
84320	84336	84305	84305	they	2969	“ The last egg ! the last dolphin ! Again ! the green is ahead ! ”
84366	84376	84378	84378	Domitian	224	“ Who was that cried out for the blue ? ”
84384	84397	84378	84378	Domitian	224	“ Find him , cast him to the dogs to be torn . ”
84407	84424	84400	84400	Ursus	391	“ It is the actor Paris . Yet do nothing now . It would be inauspicious . ”
84519	84563	84564	84564	Domitian	224	“ The blue ! the dear blue ! the blue of the Augusta has it ! Ye Gods be praised ! I vow a pig to Eppona ! The blue has it . All hail to the Augusta ! to heaven ’s blue ! ”
84586	84590	84592	84593	the Emperor	1035	“ Come now ! ”
84600	84622	84592	84593	the Emperor	1035	“ it is time that we should eat . My lady Longina , may it please you to sup with us ? ”
84778	84793	84796	84798	an ugly leer—“I	5736	“ Remove that blue — I hate it , and come to the banquet . ”
84798	84808	84796	84798	an ugly leer—“I	5736	leer—“I have sent for the actor to amuse you . ”
84809	84813	84796	84798	an ugly leer—“I	5736	“ What actor ? ”
84814	84884	84796	84798	an ugly leer—“I	5736	“ Paris , madam , the inimitable , the admired Paris , that he may recite from Greek plays to our pleasure . These Greek tragedians are at a discount . Our people do not care for the dismals . But they are wrong , do not estimate true art . You do that really ! You like tragedy ! and tragedy you shall have , I warrant you . ”
85011	85103	84994	84995	The Emperor	1035	“ So you have shed your blue — a cloud has passed over the azure ! That is well . And now , madam , I granted you the first place at the games , in the circus , to humor the people ; but in my palace it shall be as I will , not as they . Julia shall take the precedence , and she shall occupy the first position at table , and everywhere . She is the daughter of the God Titus , granddaughter of the God Vespasian- ”
85104	85116	85224	85224	Domitian	224	“ And great grand - daughter of the Commissioner of Nuisances . ”
85117	85120	85122	85122	Domitian	224	“ Silence , ”
85124	85181	85122	85122	Domitian	224	“ she has the sacred Flavian blood , she is of Divine race , and shall sit by me , recline by me , in the position of honor , and you occupy a stool at my feet . Julia and I will have a lectisternium of the Gods ! Am not I divine?—and she divine ? ”
85182	85185	85187	85187	Domitia	191	“ Certainly , ”
85189	85223	85224	85224	Domitian	224	“ she is the daughter of a victor who has triumphed , I the wife of a man who will filch laurels from his generals , and himself has never seen a battle . ”
85236	85258	85226	85226	his	224	“ I wish to the Gods I could find it in my heart to have thee strangled , thou demon cat . ”
85259	85288	85300	85300	Messalinus	392	“ I can understand that , having let out the divine blood of the Flavii from the throat of your cousin Sabinus , you would stoop to me . ”
85289	85298	85300	85300	Messalinus	392	“ What — what — what is this ? ”
85489	85498	85504	85504	Messalinus	392	“ What , what ? Who is where ? ”
85506	85516	85504	85504	Messalinus	392	“ What has been done ? Here , Lycus , ”
85526	85546	85504	85504	Messalinus	392	“ Tell me , what has been done . In my ear , quick , I burn to know . ”
85566	85626	85562	85562	he	392	“ That is admirable , great and god - like is our prince ! As a Jew physician said to me , he sets down one and setteth up another , at his pleasure . That is divine caprice . The Gods alone can act without having to account for what they do . I like it — vastly . ”
85910	85991	85900	85900	he	3011	“ Lady , recall the fable of the oak and the bulrush . Humor the prince and you can do with him what you will . Believe me , and I speak sincerely,—he loves you still , loves you madly — but you repel him and that offends his pride . All things are his , in earth,—I may almost say in heaven — and he can not endure that one frail woman ’s heart should alone be denied him . ”
85992	85998	86000	86000	Domitia	191	“ There are certain waters , ”
86002	86036	85900	85900	he	3011	“ that turn to stone whatever is exposed to them — even a bird ’s feather . It is as though I had been subjected to this treatment . My heart is petrified . ”
86037	86060	85900	85900	he	3011	“ Not so , dear lady , it beats at the present moment with anger . It can also beat with love . ”
86061	86070	85900	85900	he	3011	“ Never towards him who has maltreated me . ”
86071	86087	85900	85900	he	3011	“ By the Gods ! forbear . I am endangered by listening to such words . ”
86088	86098	86100	86100	Messalinus	392	“ What — what — what is Ursus saying ? ”
86109	86142	86100	86100	Messalinus	392	“ He is beside the Augusta — what did he say — and in a low tone also . No treason hatching at the table of our Divine Lord , I trust . ”
86143	86152	86154	86154	Ursus	391	“ Here come the jesters and the mimes , ”
86156	86174	86154	86154	Ursus	391	“ and may the god of Laughter provide such matter for mirth as will satisfy Catullus Messalinus . ”
86175	86183	86185	86186	another guest	3014	“ Then it must be a tragedy , ”
86188	86207	86185	86186	another guest	3014	“ for to our blind friend here , naught is jocose unless to some other it be painful . ”
86208	86215	86217	86217	Messalinus	392	“ We have all our gifts , ”
86387	86412	86415	86415	his	1035	“ It is my will , Domitia , that you remain in your seat . The cream of the entertainment has yet to come . ”
86429	86433	86434	86434	he	1035	“ Endure it , ”
86437	86444	86434	86434	he	1035	“ it will soon be over . ”
86445	86454	86456	86456	she	191	“ It is the worst outrage of all , ”
86592	86609	86611	86612	the actor	4676	“ Lord and Augustus , what is it your pleasure that we represent in your presence ? ”
86614	86638	86611	86612	the actor	4676	“ Repeat the speech of Œdipus Coloneus to Theseus towards the close of the drama . That , I mean , which begins , “

86684	86691	86693	86694	the Emperor	1035	“ Do you mark , Domitia ? ”
86699	86728	86693	86694	the Emperor	1035	“ I have looked under the table , sire , to see whether , like your kinsman Calvisius , you keep there a prompter who has read Eurypides . ”
86749	86755	86757	86757	he	1035	“ Go on , fellow , ”
86760	86774	86775	86775	Paris	308	“ Skip some lines — it is tedious , draw to the end . ”
86789	86792	86794	86794	Domitian	224	“ Enough , ”
86801	86809	86798	86798	his	224	“ How likest thou that , Domitia ? ”
86810	86834	86836	86836	she	3033	“ Methinks , sire , the words are ominous . Suffer me I pray thee to retire — for I am not well . ”
86888	86893	86871	86871	his	308	“ Morituri te salutant . ”
86894	86904	86871	86871	his	308	“ I ’ faith it is an excellent jest ! ”
86906	86911	86871	86871	his	308	Messalinus—“I relish it vastly . ”
86945	86971	86935	86935	she	191	“ Be speedy . Follow Paris , and protect him . There is evil planned against him . Fly — lest you be too late . ”
87409	87412	87413	87413	she	191	“ Speak , ”
87417	87451	87413	87413	she	191	“ It was too late . He had been stabbed in the back , whilst leaving the palace , and a pupil was assassinated at the same time , because somewhat resembling him . ”
87479	87487	87458	87458	She	191	“ Inform Euphrosyne . I can not . ”
87750	87753	87755	87755	she	191	“ Euphrosyne , ”
87757	87809	87810	87810	she	191	“ I bid you go , and take with you Eboracus , I place you both wholly at the disposal of your sister — and bid her spare no cost , but give to him who has been , a splendid funeral at my expense . Here is money . And — ”
87828	87894	87733	87733	she	191	hand—“and , Euphrosyne , tell Glyceria that I shall go to see her later . Not for a few days , not till the first agony of her grief is over ; but go I will — for go I must — and I pray the Gods I may not be a cause of fresh evil . O , Euphrosyne , does she curse me ? ”
87895	87926	88009	88009	Euphrosyne	268	“ Glyceria curses none , dear mistress , least of all you . Do not doubt , she will welcome you when you do her the honor of a visit . ”
87927	88008	88009	88009	Euphrosyne	268	“ If she were to curse me , I feel as if I should be glad — glad , too , if the curse fell heavy on my head — but you know — she knows — I meant to do well , to be kind — to — but go your way — I can speak no more . Tell Glyceria not to curse me — no — I could not bear that — not a curse from her . ”
88600	88603	88604	88604	she	191	“ Glyceria , ”
88607	88613	88604	88604	she	191	“ can you forgive me ? ”
88662	88667	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ Nay , nay ! ”
88671	88683	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ do not give way . It was not thy doing . ”
88684	88690	88692	88692	Domitia	191	“ But you fear me , ”
88694	88718	88692	88692	Domitia	191	“ they do so — they without . Not one touched , not one kissed me . They think me of evil omen . ”
88719	88750	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ There is nothing unlucky . Everything falls out as God wills ; and whatever comes , if we bow under His hand , He will give sweetness and grace . ”

88784	88795	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ It is a charm that has brought no luck . ”
88796	88822	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ It is no charm . It is a symbol — and to you dark . To me full of light and joy in believing . ”
88823	88829	88772	88773	the cripple	2646	“ I can not understand . ”
88830	88863	88669	88669	Glyceria	309	“ No — that I know full well . But to one who does , there is comfort in every sorrow , a rainbow in every cloud , roses to every thorn . ”
88864	88867	88869	88869	Domitia	191	“ Glyceria , ”
88909	88920	88872	88872	she	191	“ My Glyceria ! wilt thou grant me one favor ? ”
88921	88944	88872	88872	she	191	“ I will give thee , lady , anything that thou canst ask . I should be ungrateful to deny thee ought . ”

88981	89010	88978	88979	the widow	818	“ Then come with me to the palace . Here you have none to care for you , none to earn a livelihood for you,—I want you there . ”
89014	89019	89011	89011	Glyceria	309	“ Do you fear ? ”
89020	89027	88872	88872	she	191	“ I fear nothing for myself . ”

89036	89111	89034	89034	Domitia	191	“ Oh , Glyceria , I am the most miserable woman on earth . I thought I could not be more unhappy than I was — then come — I will not speak of it,—thy loss — caused unwillingly by me , because I came here — and that has broken my heart . I have done the cruellest hurt to the one I loved best . I am most miserable — most miserable . ”
89144	89180	89141	89141	Domitia	191	“ I have no one , I have nothing to look to , I am as one dead , and the only life in me is hate , that bites and writhes as a serpent . ”
89181	89195	89124	89128	The widow of the player	3112	“ And that thou must lay hold of and strangle as did Hercules . ”
89196	89206	89261	89261	she	191	“ I can not , and I will not . ”
89207	89216	89141	89141	Domitia	191	“ That will bring thee only greater suffering . ”
89217	89224	89124	89128	The widow of the player	3112	“ I can not suffer more . ”
89225	89234	89261	89261	she	191	“ It is against the will of God . ”
89235	89243	89141	89141	Domitia	191	“ But how know we His will ? ”
89244	89250	89124	89128	The widow of the player	3112	“ It has been revealed . ”
89277	89353	89261	89261	she	191	“ Come with me , and tell me all thou knowest — and about the Fish . Come with me , and give me a little happiness , that I may think of thee , comfort thee , read to thee , talk with thee — I care for no other woman . And Euphrosyne , thy sister , she is with me , and I will keep thee as the apple of mine eye . ”
89354	89364	89261	89261	she	191	“ Oh , lady ! this is too great ! ”
89365	89381	89261	89261	she	191	“ What ? anon thou wouldst deny me naught , and now refusest me this . ”
89382	89391	89393	89393	Glyceria	309	“ In God ’s name so be it , ”
89395	89399	89393	89393	Glyceria	309	“ But when ? ”
89400	89411	89412	89412	she	309	“ Now . I will have no delay , see — ”
89423	89469	89412	89412	she	309	“ They shall bear thee in my litter , at once . Euphrosyne shall tarry here and collect thy little trifles , and the good Eboracus , he shall bear them to thy new home . O Glyceria ! For once I see a sunbeam . ”
90326	90365	90315	90315	she	309	“ There , Glyceria , I allow no interference . He has wronged me past endurance . I can never forgive . I have but one hope , I make but one prayer — and that for revenge . ”
90671	90706	90658	90658	Eboracus	193	“ Lady , there is a great crowd , and the street is full to choking . What is your good pleasure ? shall we announce who you are , and command a passage ? ”
90707	90710	90712	90713	the princess	3141	“ Nay , ”
90715	90763	90712	90713	the princess	3141	“ my good Eboracus , let us draw aside , and the swarm will pass , then we can go our way unconcerned . I am in no precipitate haste , and , in faith , every minute I am outside Rome , the better satisfied am I. ”
90764	90782	90658	90658	Eboracus	193	“ But , madam , it is an ill spot , we are opposite the Accursed Field . ”
90783	90825	90658	90658	Eboracus	193	“ That matters not . It is but for a brief while . Go forward , Eboracus , and inquire what this crowd signifies . Methinks the people are marvellously still . I hear no shout , not even a murmur . ”
90826	90834	90712	90713	the princess	3141	“ There be priests leading the way . ”
90835	90858	90658	90658	Eboracus	193	“ It is some religious rite . Run forward , Eboracus , and make inquiries . That boy bears an inverted torch . ”
91473	91476	91477	91477	he	193	“ Madam , ”
91488	91522	91477	91477	he	193	“ I pray you , for the sake of the Gods — do nothing rash . Stay where you are . No power — not that of the Sacred Twelve can save her . ”
91523	91533	91459	91459	Eboracus	193	“ Ye Gods ! But what has she done ? ”
91534	91555	91477	91477	he	193	“ She has been accused of breach of her vows , and condemned by the Augustus , as Chief Priest — ”
91566	91572	91477	91477	he	193	“ unheard in her defence . ”
91573	91580	91646	91646	She	191	“ I must go to her . ”
91581	91597	91477	91477	he	193	“ You must not . Nothing can save her . Pray for a speedy death . ”
91681	91813	91646	91646	She	191	“ Citizens , by the sacred fire of Vesta , I swear I am innocent of the charge laid against me , and for which I am sentenced . No witnesses have been called . I have not been suffered to offer any defence . I knew not , citizens , until I was told that I was sentenced , that any accusation had been trumped up against me . Thou , O Eternal God — above all lights in the firmament , Thou , O Sovereign Justice that holdest true balances — I invoke Thee — I summon the Chief Pontiff who has sentenced me , before your just thrones , to answer for what is done unto me this day . I summon him for midnight three days hence . ”
92003	92007	92009	92009	she	2717	“ The Emperor , ”
92016	92060	92009	92009	she	2717	“ has adjudged me guilty , knowing that my prayers have obtained for him victory , triumph and an immortal name . I repeat my summons . I bid him answer before the throne on high , at midnight , three days hence . ”
92177	92186	92188	92188	Eboracus	193	“ Be speedy ! Remove her ! Run — ”
92202	92209	92210	92210	Eboracus	193	faint,—“At once — to the Palace ! ”
92466	92510	92451	92451	He	193	“ Lady , you can not proceed . Suffer me to recommend that you go to the Carinæ and tarry there — with your lady mother for a while , till your strength is restored , and till the streets be more open . ”
92511	92522	92451	92451	He	193	“ Eboracus — what is going on ? tell me . ”
92523	92583	92451	92451	He	193	“ Madam , there is something being transacted in the comitium that causes all the approaches to be packed with people . We might make a circuit — but , lady ! I think if you would deign to repose for an hour at your mother ’s house , after what you have suffered , it would be advisable . ”
92584	92595	92451	92451	He	193	“ Tell me what is taking place in the comitium . ”
92596	92608	92451	92451	He	193	“ I should prefer , lady , not to be asked . ”
92609	92615	92451	92451	He	193	“ But I have asked . ”
92616	92631	92451	92451	He	193	“ Then , dear mistress , do not require of me to make answer . ”
92632	92645	92646	92646	He	3249	“ Answer truly . Tell me no lie . What is it ? ”
92654	92682	92650	92650	Domitia	191	“ Look at my hand , it is firm , it does not tremble . Nothing that I hear can be worse than what I have seen . ”
92683	92692	92451	92451	He	193	“ Lady — your strength has already failed . ”
92693	92742	92451	92451	He	193	“ And now I have gathered my resolution together , and can bear anything . I adjure you , by your duty to me — answer me , what is taking place in the comitium , what is it that causes the streets leading thereto to be impassable . ”
92743	92750	92650	92650	Domitia	191	“ If I must reply — — ”
92751	92763	92650	92650	Domitia	191	“ If you do not , I will have you scourged . ”
92764	92803	92451	92451	He	193	“ Nay , lady , that is not like thee . It is not fear that will make me speak , but because I know that if I do not , the information can be got from another . ”
92804	92811	92650	92650	Domitia	191	“ Well — what is it ? ”
92812	92839	92650	92650	Domitia	191	“ The knight Celer , on the same charge as that which lost the Great Mother Cornelia , is being whipped to death with the scorpion . ”
92840	92854	92855	92856	Hastily Domitia	191	“ By the same orders ? To my mother ’s in the Carinæ . ”
92890	92907	92908	92910	The lady Duilia	1633	“ My dear Domitia ! my august daughter ! What a pleasure ! What an honor ! ”
92989	92996	92998	92999	her mother	519	“ As the Gods love me ! ”
93005	93072	92998	92999	her mother	519	“ you are not going to be ill , surely — nothing dangerous , nothing likely to end unhappily . Ye Gods ! and I have so much I want you to do for me . Tell me , I entreat you . Hide nothing from me . You are suffering . Where is it ? What is it ? Shall I send for a doctor ? ”
93073	93086	93087	93087	Domitia	191	“ Mother , no doctor can cure me . It is here , ”
93093	93096	93087	93087	Domitia	191	heart—“and here , ”
93101	93114	93087	93087	Domitia	191	“ I am the most miserable , the most unfortunate of women . ”
93115	93124	92998	92999	her mother	519	“ Ye Gods ! He has divorced you ? ”
93125	93136	92998	92999	her mother	519	“ No , mother . I would that he had . ”
93137	93204	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ Then what is the matter ? Have you eaten what disagrees with you ? As the Gods love me ! you should not come out such a figure . Who was your face - dresser to - day ? she ought to be crucified ! Not a particle of paint — white as ivory . Intolerable — and it has given me such a turn . ”
93210	93225	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ But what is it ? What has made you look like Parian marble ? ”
93226	93232	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ The Great Mother Cornelia — ”
93267	93278	93280	93282	the lady Duilia	1633	“ I have an essence — you must take that , ”
93284	93391	93280	93282	the lady Duilia	1633	“ My dear , I know all about that . An estimable lady . I mean she was so till the Augustus decreed otherwise . I am sorry , and all that — but you know — well , these things do happen and must , and I dare be bound that some are glad , as it makes an opening for another needy girl , of good family of course . What is one person ’s loss is another ’s gain . The world is so and we ca n’t alter it , and a good thing , I say , that it is so . ”
93392	93399	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ Mother — she was innocent . ”
93400	93442	93575	93575	her	191	“ Well , well , we know all about that . Of course it was all nonsense what was charged against her , that we quite understand . It would never have done for the real truth to have been advertised . ”
93443	93450	93280	93282	the lady Duilia	1633	“ And what was the truth ? ”
93451	93547	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ My dear Domitia ! How can you ask such a silly , infantile question ? It was your doing , you must understand that . You threw yourself on her protection , embraced the altar of Vesta , and Cornelia with the assistance of Celer did what she could to further your object in leaving Rome . If people will do donkey - like things they must get a stick across their backs . It is so , and always will be so in this world , and we can not make it otherwise . ”
93548	93560	93562	93562	Domitia	191	“ I thought so . I was sure it was so , ”
93578	93593	93575	93575	her	191	“ Mother , I bring misfortune upon all with whom I have to do . ”
93594	93623	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ Ye Gods ! not on me ! I hope to be preserved from that ! Do not speak such unlucky words — they are of bad omen . ”
93624	93647	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ I can not help it , mother , it is true . I am the most unfortunate of women myself — — ”
93648	93705	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ You speak rank folly . Ye Gods forgive me ! saying such a thing to one who is herself divine . But , it is so — you are positively the most fortunate of women . What more do you desire ? You are the Augusta , the people swear by your genius and fortune . ”
93706	93715	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ By my fortune ! Alack poor souls ! ”
93716	93738	93205	93205	Domitia	191	“ And is it not a piece of good fortune to be raised so high that there is none above you ? ”
93739	93853	93854	93854	She	3257	“ My fortune ! The Gods know — if they know anything — that I would gladly exchange my lot with that of a poor woman in a cottage who spins and sings , or of a girl among the mountains who keeps goats and is defended by a boisterous dog . Mother , listen to me . I have brought misfortune on Lucius Lamia , I have caused the death of that harmless actor Paris , I have been the occasion of Cornelia being — buried alive — watching the expiring of the one lamp . Ye Gods ! Ye Gods ! I shall go mad — and of Celer also.—He — — ”
93873	93876	93878	93880	the old lady	2217	“ Yes , ”
93899	94052	93878	93880	the old lady	2217	“ Yes , child , and mischief you will work on every one , if you continue in the same course . Do men say that the Augustus is morose ? Who made him so?—you by your behavior . Do they say that he is severe in his judgments ? Who has hardened him and made him cruel?—You — who have dried up all the springs of tenderness in his breast . He was not so at first . If he be what men think — it is your work . You with your stinging words goaded him to madness and as he can not or will not beat you , as you deserve , he deals the blows on some one else . Of course he cuts away such as you regard and love — because they obtain that to which he has a right , but which you deny him . ”
94053	94061	94062	94062	Domitia	191	“ He — he — a right ! ”
94092	94228	94229	94229	She	3260	“ He a right , mother ! he who tore me away from my dear Lamia , to whom I had given my whole heart , to whom I had been united by your sanction and our union blessed by the Gods ! He who violated hospitality , the most sacred rights that belong to a house , who repaid your kindness in saving his life — when he was hunted like a wolf , by breaking and destroying , by trampling under his accursed heel , the brittle , innocent heart of the daughter of her who had protected him ! No , mother , I owed him no love . I have never given him any , because he never had a right to any . Mother — this must have an end . ”
94273	94317	94268	94268	she	181	“ My dear Domitia , you are overwrought . You have eaten something that has affected your temper . I find gherkins always disagree with me . There , go and take a little ginger in white wine , and sleep it off . ”
94331	94368	94268	94268	she	181	“ Yes , mother , I will go . But there is one thing I desire of thee . I have long coveted it , as a remembrancer of my father — may I take it ? ”
94369	94376	94377	94377	Domitia	191	“ Anything — anything you like . ”
94393	94404	94406	94406	she	191	“ It is this , mother . I need it . ”
94409	94415	94417	94417	Duilia	181	“ That sword — ah ! ”
94419	94464	94417	94417	Duilia	181	“ It has been a little overdone . I have caught my guests exchanging winks when I alluded to it , and dropped a tear . O by all means she shall have it . It has ceased to be of use to me . ”
94509	94516	94517	94517	she	191	“ I have sent for thee , ”
94520	94534	94517	94517	she	191	“ How long , I would know , before the sixth veil falls ? ”
94535	94540	94542	94543	the Magian	4788	“ Lady and Augusta , ”
94545	94656	94542	94543	the Magian	4788	“ remember that when thou lookest out upon the Sabine Mountains , on one day all is so distinct that thou wouldst suppose a walk of an hour would bring thee to them . On the morrow , the range is so faint and so remote , that thou wouldst consider it must require days of travel to attain their roots . It is so with the Future . We look into its distance and behold forms — but whether near or far we know not . This only do we say with confidence , that we are aware of their succession , but not of their nearness or remoteness . ”
94657	94670	94517	94517	she	191	“ What ! and the stars , will they not help thee ? ”
94671	94683	94517	94517	she	191	“ There is at this time an ominous conjuncture of planets . ”
94684	94702	94542	94543	the Magian	4788	“ I pray thee , spare me the details , and tell me that which they portend . ”
94703	94718	94517	94517	she	191	“ Is it thine own future , Augusta , thou desirest to look into ? ”
94719	94874	94517	94517	she	191	“ Elymas , my story has been unfolded — to what an extent it has been managed by such as thyself , that I can not judge . But of a certainty it was thou who didst contrive that I was carried away from my husband ’s house . Then what followed , the Gods know how far thou wast in it , but I have heard it said that the God Titus would not have had his mortal thread cut short but that , when in fever , thou didst persuade him to a bath in snow water . It is very easy to predict what will be , when with our hands we mould the future . And now — I care not whether thou makest or predictest what is to be — but an end there must be , and that a speedy one — for thine own safety hangs thereon . ”
94875	94881	94542	94543	the Magian	4788	“ How so , lady ? ”
94882	94906	94517	94517	she	191	“ The Augustus has been greatly alarmed of late at sinister omens and prophesies ; and he attributes them to thee . Perhaps , ”
94912	94928	94517	94517	she	191	“ he also is aware that fulfilment is assured before a prophesy is given out . ”
94940	94989	94935	94935	his	210	“ I know , because at supper with his intimates , Messala and Regulus and Carus , he swore by the Gods he would have you cast to savage dogs , and he would make an example of such as filled men ’s minds with expectation of evil . ”
94990	94994	94998	94998	him	210	“ Lady — — ”
95000	95101	94996	94996	Domitia	191	“ Thou thinkest that I say this to alarm thee and bend thee to my will . If the Augustus has his spies that watch and repeat to him whatsoever I do , whomsoever I see , almost every word I say — shall not I also have a watch put upon him ? Even now , Magus , that I have sent for thee , and that thou art closely consulted by me this has been carried to his ears , and as he knows how I esteem him , he will think this interview bodes him no good . ”
95102	95112	94935	94935	his	210	“ When , Lady Augusta , was this said ? ”
95113	95160	95161	95162	The man	4042	“ The Emperor is this day returned from Albanum , and the threat was made but yesterday . Who can say but that the order has already been given for thy arrest , and for the gathering together of the dogs that are to rend thee . ”
95169	95172	95174	95174	Domitia	191	“ Magus , ”
95176	95296	95174	95174	Domitia	191	“ I can not save thee , thine own wits must do that . Find it written in the stars that thy life is so bound up with that of the Cæsar , that the death of one is the extinction of the other ; or that thou holdest so potent a charm that if thou wilt thou canst employ it for his destruction . It is not for me to point out how thou mayest twist out of his grasp — thou art a very eel for slipperiness , and a serpent for contrivance . What I desire to know is — How much longer is this tyranny to last , and how long am I to suffer ? ”
95503	95506	95508	95509	the Magus	1309	“ Lady , ”
95511	95522	95508	95509	the Magus	1309	“ before Saturn has pointed to the twelfth hour — — ”
95564	95567	95569	95569	he	224	“ So ? ”
95571	95594	95595	95595	He	224	“ you are in league with astrologers and magicians against me ! But , by the Gods ! I can protect myself . ”
95610	95614	95616	95617	the Emperor	1035	“ Remove him , ”
95619	95653	95616	95617	the Emperor	1035	“ I have given orders concerning him already . Hey ! Magus ! knowest thou what will be thy doom , thou who pretendest to read the fate of men in the stars ? ”
95654	95657	95659	95660	the necromancer	3277	“ Augustus , ”
95662	95675	95659	95660	the necromancer	3277	“ I have read that I should be rent by wild dogs . ”
95676	95730	95731	95731	Domitian	224	“ Sayest thou so ? Then by Jupiter ! I will make thy forecast come to naught . Go , Eulogius!—it is my command that he be at once , mark you , this very night , burned alive . We will see whether his prophecies come true . Here is my order . ”
95792	95799	95801	95801	he	224	“ Every one out of earshot , ”
95834	95844	95846	95847	the Emperor	1035	“ A storm , a storm is coming on , ”
95849	95896	95898	95898	he	1035	“ there ’ll be storms everywhere , and lightning falling on all sides — portents they say . So be it ! as the sword of heaven smites , so does mine . But it falls not on me , but on my enemies . Domitia , ”
95904	95959	95898	95898	he	1035	“ there has been a conspiracy entered into against my life , and the fools thought to set up Clemens — he , that weakling , that coward ; but I have sent him to his death , and those who were associated with him , the sentence is gone forth against them also . ”
95960	95973	95846	95847	the Emperor	1035	“ I marvel only that any in Rome are suffered to live . ”
95974	95984	95898	95898	he	1035	“ Minerva gives me wisdom — to defend myself . ”
95985	95995	95846	95847	the Emperor	1035	“ Any wild beast can employ teeth and claws . ”
95996	95999	96000	96000	he	1035	“ Domitia , ”
96006	96070	96000	96000	he	1035	“ I am the most lonely of men . I have no friends ; my kinsmen either have been , or hate me ; my friends are the most despicable of flatterers , who would betray their own parents to save their own throats ; I use them , but I scorn them . You know not what it is to be alone ! ”
96071	96086	95846	95847	the Emperor	1035	“ I ! I have been alone ever since you tore me from Lamia . ”
96087	96090	96091	96091	he	3283	“ Lamia ! ”
96096	96263	96091	96091	he	3283	“ still Lamia ! But by the Gods ! not for long . And you — you my wife whom I have loved , for whom I would have done anything — you are against me ; you take counsel with a Chaldæan how long I have to live ; the Senate , the nobles hate me , and by Jupiter , they have good cause , for I cut them with a scythe like ripe wheat . That was a good lesson of Tarquin to his son Sextus to nip off the heads of the tallest poppies . And the people — you have been currying favor with them — against me ; the soldiers alone love me , because I have doubled their pay ; let another offer to treble it and , to a man , they will desert me . By the Immortals ! it is terrible to be alone — and to be plotted against , even by one ’s wife . ”
96281	96293	96294	96294	he	3284	“ What said that star - gazer about the twelfth hour ? ”
96297	96341	96294	96294	he	3284	“ Walls have ears , nothing is said that does not reach me . So , old Saturn , with thy scythe , dost thou threaten ? Then I defy thee — ha ! I saw the storm was coming up over Rome . ”
96357	96363	96365	96366	the prince	4158	“ I saw no flash , ”
96368	96402	96365	96366	the prince	4158	“ yet lightning falls somewhere , maybe to kindle the pyre on which that sorcerer will burn ; I care not . Fire of heaven fall and strike where and whom thou wilt ! ”
96487	96492	96493	96493	he	3284	“ By the Gods ! ”
96499	96516	96493	96493	he	3284	“ here comes the rain ; it descends in cataracts ; it falls with a roar . ”
96596	96603	96604	96604	he	1035	“ None have ever loved me , ”
96608	96935	96604	96604	he	1035	“ how then can it be expected that I shall love any ? my father disliked me , my brother distrusted me — and you — my wife , have ever hated me . I need not ask the cause of that . It is Lamia , always Lamia . Because he has never married you think he still harbors love for you ; and you — you hate me because of him . It is hard to be a prince , and to be alone . If I hear a play — I think I catch allusions to me ; if it be a comedy — there is a jest aimed at me ; if a tragedy , it expresses what men wish may befall me . If I read a historian , he declaims on the glories of a commonwealth before these men , these Cæsars became tyrants , and as for your philosophers — away with them , they are wind - bags , but the wind is poisonous , it is malarious to me . When I am at the circus , because I back green — you , the entire hoop of spectators cheer , bet on the blue — to show me that they hate me . At the Amphitheatre , if I favor the big shields , then every one else is for the small targets . A prince is ever the most solitary of men . If you had protested that you loved me , had fondled me , I would have held you in suspicion , mistrusted your every word and look and gesture . Perhaps it is because that you have never given me good word , gentle look , and gesture of respect that I feel you are true — cruelly true , and I have loved you as the only true person I know . Now answer me — you asked after my death ? ”
96936	96939	96941	96941	Domitia	191	“ Yes , ”
96943	96948	96941	96941	Domitia	191	“ I knew it . ”
96949	96952	96954	96954	she	191	“ And , ”
96971	96979	96954	96954	she	191	“ I bear to you a message . ”
96980	96984	96941	96941	Domitia	191	“ From whom ? ”
96985	96993	96954	96954	she	191	“ From Cornelia , the Great Mother . ”
96994	97001	97002	97002	he	3292	“ Well , and what — — ”
97011	97017	97005	97006	some one	4638	“ What would you have ? ”
97023	97028	97018	97020	The mime Latinus	3294	“ Well — speak . ”
97029	97067	97002	97002	he	3292	“ Sire , the rain extinguished the pyre , before that the astrologer was much burnt ; then the dogs fell on him , as he was unbound , and they tore him and he is dead . ”
97068	97072	97074	97074	Domitian	224	“ Ye Gods ! ”
97081	97090	97078	97078	his	224	“ His word has come true after all . ”
97099	97109	97110	97110	He	3292	“ You have not heard the message of Cornelia . ”
97115	97151	97110	97110	He	3292	“ She has summoned you , the Augustus , the Chief Pontiff , the unjust Judge , to answer before the All - righteous Supreme Justice , above — before the scythe points to Twelve . ”
97354	97389	97339	97339	She	191	“ To be executed immediately : — In the Tullianum , by strangulation , Lucius Ælius Lamia Plautius Ælianus . To be torn by dogs : — The Chaldæan Elymas , otherwise called Ascletarion . ”
97395	97459	97339	97339	She	191	“ To be executed on the morrow : — By decapitation : Petronius Secundus , Præfect of the Prætorium . Norbanus , likewise Præfect of the Prætorium . By strangling , in the Tullianum : Parthenius and Sigerius , Chamberlains of the Palace . To be bled to death : Stephanus : steward to my niece Domitilla . Entellus : Secretary a libellis . ”
97521	97560	97518	97518	she	191	“ Fly — summon me at once Stephanus the steward , Petronius and Norbanus , præfects , and the chamberlains Parthenius and Sigerius . Bid them come to me at once — not make a moment ’s delay . ”
97611	97652	97653	97654	The chamberlain	3300	mien—“My mistress ! The bolt of heaven has fallen on the Palatine , and the chamber of the Augustus has been struck . The Temple of the Flavians is on fire , and is burning in despite of the rain . ”
97660	97663	97665	97665	he	417	“ Augusta ! ”
97667	97693	97665	97665	he	417	“ the lightning has struck that part of the palace occupied by Cæsar . He must have his apartment for the night on this side . ”
97694	97699	97701	97701	Domitia	191	“ That is well , ”
97703	97714	97701	97701	Domitia	191	“ Parthenius , have you received my message from Eboracus ? ”
97715	97720	97665	97665	he	417	“ No , lady . ”
97721	97726	97727	97727	she	191	“ Then read this , ”
97743	97746	97748	97748	Domitia	191	“ Parthenius , ”
97750	97794	97795	97795	she	191	“ it is no vain augury that lightning has struck the Temple of the Flavians , and driven Cæsar from his apartments . Let his place of rest be to - night in the room adjoining this — and — if he wakes — ”
97815	97842	97845	97845	she	191	scythe—“there is but an hour in which the fate of more than yourself , of Lamia — of Entellus must be decided . Take the tablets . ”
97880	97883	97885	97885	he	417	“ Sire , ”
97887	97902	97885	97885	he	417	“ I have come to announce that thy chamber must be on this side . ”
97903	97908	97910	97910	Domitian	224	“ Go thy way , ”
97913	97936	97910	97910	Domitian	224	“ see to it that I have a bed brought at once . Hast heard , Domitia , the fire has fallen ! ”
97937	97940	97942	97942	Parthenius	417	“ Sire , ”
97944	97968	97942	97942	Parthenius	417	“ I haste to obey and pray the Gods that in spite of thunder and lightning you may sleep sound and not wake . ”
97980	97989	97991	97991	he	1035	“ The bolt of Jove has missed me , ”
97993	98051	97991	97991	he	1035	“ The red - handed One made a mistake . I am wo nt to be in bed at this hour — by good luck , this night I was not . He has levelled his bolt at my pillow and burnt that — I am escaped scot - free . Now I have no further fear . ”
98052	98063	97910	97910	Domitian	224	“ The temple of your divine family is in flames . ”
98064	98136	98137	98137	he	3303	“ What care I ? I will rebuild it — the majesty , the divinity of the Flavians resides not in stones and marble — it is incorporate in Me . I may have been in danger for a moment . Now I snap my fingers in the face of that blunderer Jove , who burnt a hole in my pillow instead of transfixing my head . And yon old Chronos — ”
98147	98181	98137	98137	he	3303	“ I defy thee and thy bucket of blood . Twelve o’clock ! In spite of Jove ’s bolt , and the summons of Cornelia — I shall be asleep by that hour . ”
98182	98192	98137	98137	he	3303	“ I pray the Gods it may be so . ”
98232	98249	98224	98224	he	3303	“ Domitia ! What sword is that ? What need has a woman with a sword ? ”
98271	98275	98277	98277	she	3305	“ Leave it , ”
98280	98300	98301	98301	He	3303	“ It is that on which my father fell . It is stained likewise with the blood of Nero . ”
98434	98440	98442	98443	the prince	4158	“ Why camest thou hither ? ”
98446	98463	98442	98443	the prince	4158	“ I shall have enough to say to thee on the morrow because of thy embezzlements . ”
98464	98471	98518	98518	he	4158	“ Augustus ! I am innocent . ”
98472	98508	98518	98518	he	4158	“ A thief , a vile purloiner , a blood - sucking leech , that has fattened as do all thy kind on thy masters . Go thy way — I want thee not here . ”
98552	98572	98544	98544	he	419	“ What , hound ! You dare ! You shall be flayed alive ! Ho ! to my aid ! ”
98606	98615	98617	98617	Domitian	224	“ To my aid ! to my aid ! ”
98637	98647	98649	98650	the Emperor	1035	“ To my aid ! Ho , a sword ! ”
98900	98917	98919	98920	the Emperor	1035	“ Quick ! Domitia — the sword ! At once — the sword — the sword ! ”
98960	98966	98968	98968	she	3335	“ Domitia ! the sword ! ”
98999	99006	98981	98981	she	3335	“ Because of Paris — No ! ”
99007	99019	98981	98981	she	3335	“ The sword ! be speedy . I will finish him ! ”
99020	99027	98981	98981	she	3335	“ Because of Cornelia — No ! ”
99028	99033	98981	98981	she	3335	“ Domitia — help ! ”
99034	99042	99043	99043	She	3335	“ Because of Lucius Lamia — No ! ”
99269	99272	99267	99267	Some	760	“ Treason ! ”
99274	99280	99281	99281	Some	760	“ Away with the monster ! ”
99284	99290	99281	99281	Some	760	“ Nerva is the Emperor ! ”
99292	99298	99300	99304	the gladiator at the door	3363	“ Domitian is the Augustus ! ”
99407	99411	99412	99413	The man	4042	said—“Make an end . ”
99549	99562	99564	99564	Domitia	191	“ He has answered his summons before the seat of Divine Justice ! ”
99733	99740	99742	99743	the Briton	3825	“ I am here , lady , ”
99745	99768	99742	99743	the Briton	3825	“ Then quick — with me . Not a moment is to be lost . Light a torch and lead the way . ”
99769	99774	99781	99781	He	193	“ Whither , mistress ? ”
99775	99780	99781	99781	He	193	“ To the Tullianum . ”
99788	99814	99781	99781	He	193	“ Quick — a life , a precious life is at stake . Not a minute must we delay or it will be too late . ”
99815	99822	99823	99823	He	193	“ I am ready , lady . ”
99869	99879	99881	99881	Eboracus	193	“ Shall we take any one else with us ? ”
99885	99921	99881	99881	Eboracus	193	himself—“Yes — here is Euphrosyne . She shall attend , and a boy shall carry the link . At night — and on such a night , I must have both arms at my disposal . ”
100718	100728	100730	100732	the British slave	1760	“ Open — in the name of the Augustus , ”
100771	100782	100767	100767	Domitia	191	“ You have a prisoner here — Lucius Ælius Lamia ? ”
100783	100786	100767	100767	Domitia	191	“ Yes . ”
100787	100795	100801	100801	he	3433	“ You must lead me to him . ”
100837	100844	100846	100846	Domitia	191	“ You do not know me , ”
100848	100854	100846	100846	Domitia	191	“ Know you this ring ? ”
100879	100888	100890	100890	Domitia	191	“ You are required to lead me within , ”
100918	100922	100924	100924	Domitia	191	“ And now , ”
100935	100941	100924	100924	Domitia	191	“ lead me to him . ”
100967	100971	100973	100973	he	3433	“ This way , ”
100975	101063	100973	100973	he	3433	“ and bow your heads , the entrance is low ; but most of them that pass this way have to hold their heads still lower when they are taken out . Look at these stones — great blocks built by the Kings — by Servius Tullus , they say . By Hercules ! this is not a tavern where men tarry long , nor do they relish our fare . One thing I must say in our favor , we make no charge for our hospitality . ”
101073	101118	101119	101119	he	3433	“ Look there — on your right — there is the cell where Simon Bar Gioras , the Jew , was strangled — he who was the last to maintain the struggle against the God Titus , in defence of Jerusalem ; and see — ”
101125	101264	101265	101265	he	3455	“ Here is the Bath of Mamertius in which Jugurtha was starved , all in blackness of darkness and soaking in ice - cold water . What ! Impatient — do you not care to see the sights and hear my gossip ? Well , well — but I have pretty things to show . I have a shankbone of Appius Claudius , who committed suicide in yon cell , and a garment of Sejanus , and the very bowstring wherewith — I am going on as fast as may be . See ! we have had Christians here also . There was another Jew , Simon Petrus by name , he was in this cell , and I have the chain whereby he was bound , and I sell the links to the followers of the Nazarene , ”
101270	101369	101265	101265	he	3455	“ By Hercules ! the chain is long enough . They come for more links than there would be , were the chain to reach across the Tiber . But any bit of old iron will serve , and they are not particular — take any scrap and pay in silver . I am going as fast as may be . I am not young . Fast enough I warrant . He is in no hurry — not Lamia . He can wait . All the same to him whether we reach him now or an hour hence . ”
101402	101408	101409	101409	she	191	said:—“Tell me — is he — ”
101429	101532	101533	101533	He	3458	“ Aye , aye , you shall see for yourself . Come from the Augustus to satisfy him that we do our work properly , I trow . I have not much strength in these old - hands , but my two sons are lusty — and say the word — they will bend your back and snap the spine , smite and shear off your head like a pumpkin under a scythe , twist , and the life is throttled out of you . Here — here we are . Go in and see for yourself that we are good workmen . ”
101602	101608	101610	101610	he	3465	“ The order came yesterday , ”
101612	101622	101610	101610	he	3465	“ and we are not slack in the execution . ”
101640	101644	101636	101636	She	191	“ He sleeps ! ”
101645	101653	101654	101654	She	191	“ I warrant you — right soundly . ”
101660	101666	101667	101667	She	191	“ Put down the lamp ! ”
101674	101692	101693	101694	The man	4042	“ Leave me alone with him . I will wake him . I know he but sleeps . ”
101708	101716	101698	101698	Eboracus	193	whispered—“Go without , it is the Augusta ! ”
101744	101750	101752	101752	Domitia	191	“ Without ! Without all ! ”
101795	101800	101802	101803	the jailer	3433	“ He is dead , ”
101805	101831	101802	101803	the jailer	3433	“ Did the Augustus desire to withdraw the order ? His signet has arrived too late . The prisoner has been throttled by my sons . ”
102489	102855	102466	102468	The old lady	2217	“ My poor dear child — I never made a greater blunder in my life — I , too , who have the pedigree at my finger ’s ends — as to fancy that there was any connection with those Flavians . My dear ! yellow hair is quite out of fashion now , quite out . Look at mine , a raven ’s wing is not darker . It was through Vespasia Polla — I thought we were related — stupid that I was — it was the Vipsanians we were allied to , not those low and beggarly Vespasians . As the Gods love me , I believe Polla ’s father was an army contractor . But I have made it all right . I have smudged out the line I had added to the family tree , and as for the wax heads of those Flavians , I have had them melted up . Will you believe it — I had the mask of Domitian run into a pot and that stupid Lucilla did not put a cover on it , and the rats have eaten it — eaten all the wax . I hope it has clogged their stomachs and given them indigestion . They doubtless thought it was dripping . But I really have made a most surprising discovery . I find there was an alliance with the Cocceii — most respectable family , very ancient , admirable men all — and so there is a sort of cousinship with the present admirable prince . His brother Aulus — rather old perhaps — but an estimable man — is — well — may be — in a word , I intend to give a little supper — a dainty affair — all in the best style — so sorry you ca n’t be there , my dear Domitia — but of course absolutely impossible . Your state of health and all that sort of thing . Do n’t be surprised if you hear — but there , there — he is rather old though , for one who is only just turning off the very bloom of life and beauty . ”
103044	103170	103035	103035	She	191	“ My Glyceria , I intend this for the little temple of my father . It is all I can do for him — to give flowers where his ashes lie — but it does not content me . There were two whom I loved and looked up to as the best of men , and both are gone — gone to dust : my own dearest father , and my lover , my husband , Lamia . I can not bear to think of them as heaps of ashes or as wandering ghosts . When that thought comes over me , I seem to be as one drowning , and then darkness is before my eyes . I can not cry — I smother . ”
103171	103187	103035	103035	She	191	“ Why should you think of them as wandering ghosts or as heaps of dust ? ”
103188	103250	103251	103251	She	3502	“ I know that they are dust — I suppose they are shadows . But of anything else , all is guess - work , we know nothing — and that is so horrible . I love two only — have loved two only — and they are no more than shadows . No , no ! I mean not that . ”
103269	103326	103253	103253	her	3502	“ No , I do love you , and I love Euphrosyne and I love Eboracus . But I mean — I mean in a different manner . One was my father , and the other my husband . It is so terribly sad to think they are lost to me like yesterday or last summer . ”
103327	103339	103251	103251	She	3502	“ They are not lost . You will see them again . ”
103340	103349	103251	103251	She	3502	“ See my father ! See my Lamia ! ”
103350	103360	103253	103253	her	3502	“ Yes — I know it will be so . ”
103361	103387	103251	103251	She	3502	“ O , Glyceria , do not say such things . You make my heart jump . How can it be ? They have been . ”
103388	103402	103251	103251	She	3502	“ They are and will be . Death is swallowed up in Life . ”
103403	103415	103251	103251	She	3502	“ That is impossible . Death is death and nothing more . ”
103433	103444	103422	103422	Domitia	191	“ Dost thou remember having asked me about the Fish ? ”
103445	103451	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Yes — this amulet , ”
103477	103493	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Yes — I recollect — there was some mystery , but what was it ? ”
103494	103513	103458	103458	she	3504	“ The Fish is a symbol , as I said once before , and it is no amulet . ”
103514	103522	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Of what is it the symbol ? ”
103523	103586	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Of One who died — who tasted of the bitterness of the parting of soul and body , and who went into the region of Shadows and returned — the soul to the body , and rose from the dead , and by the virtue of His resurrection gives power to all who believe in Him to rise in like manner . ”
103587	103602	103458	103458	she	3504	“ And he could tell about what the ghosts do — how they wander ? ”
103603	103632	103458	103458	she	3504	“ I can not say that . There would be no comfort in that . He rose to give us joy and to rob death of its terrors . ”
103633	103644	103458	103458	she	3504	“ But what has this to do with the Fish ? ”
103645	103656	103458	103458	she	3504	“ You know what the word Fish is in Greek . ”
103657	103661	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Very well . ”
103662	103699	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Take each letter of that word , and each letter is the first of words that contain the very substance of the Christian belief — Jesus Christ , the Son of God , the Saviour . ”
103713	103759	103708	103708	she	191	“ I believe that one could die and wake again . I have fainted and come round . And he might say what was in the spirit world into which he had been — but the region of ghosts is very dreary , very sad . ”
103760	103803	103458	103458	she	3504	“ Nay , He can do more . As He rose , He can raise us to new life , and He will do it , for He is God . He made us , and He will recall us from death . ”
103804	103828	103458	103458	she	3504	“ What — my father ! Lucius ! I shall see them again — not as shadows , but as they were — ? ”
103829	103847	103708	103708	she	191	“ Not so — not as they were , mortal ; but raised to an immortal life . ”
103848	103886	103458	103458	she	3504	“ I shall kiss my darling father — put my arms around my Lucius from whom I have been parted so long , and so cruelly , and who has been so — so true to me . ”
103898	103927	103893	103893	Glyceria	309	“ There — you see how joyous is our hope . Death is nothing — it is only a good - bye for a bit to meet again . ”
103928	103984	103708	103708	she	191	“ O , Glyceria ! O , if I could see them — O Glyceria ! O , you should not have said this if it be not true . My heart will break . O , if it might be so ! if I could ! but once only — for a moment — — ”
103985	104008	103893	103893	Glyceria	309	“ Nay , that would not suffice ; forever , never to be separated ; no more tears , no more death . ”
104009	104049	103708	103708	she	191	“ O , Glyceria — not another word — I can not bear it . My heart is over full . Another time . My head , my head ! O , if it might — it could be ! ”
104149	104157	104143	104143	she	309	“ You have never been in Syria ? ”
104158	104164	104143	104143	she	309	“ No , dear lady . ”
104165	104350	104351	104351	she	3507	“ I have — and I have been on the confines of the desert and looked away , as far as the eye could reach , and have seen nothing but sand and barren rock . Behind me a rose - garden , syringas , myrtle and citron trees , and murmuring streams , before me — no green leaf , only death . It is to me , as I stand now and look back on my life as if it were that barren desert ; and the fearful thing is — I dare not turn and look the other way , for it is into impenetrable night . But no , my life is not all desolation , there are just two green spots in it where the date palms stand and there are wells — my childhood , when I sat on my father ’s knee and cuddled into his arms ; and once again , when I was recovering from the loss of him and was basking in the joy of my love for Lucius Lamia . All the rest — ”
104356	104358	104143	104143	she	309	despair—“Death . ”
104359	104419	104143	104143	she	309	“ Dearest lady ! I would like to turn you about and show you that where you think only blackness reigns , lies a beautiful garden , a paradise , and One at the gate who beckons and says , Come unto Me , all you that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . ”
104420	104445	104351	104351	she	3507	“ Ah ! but that may be all fancy and dream work like the promises of the Magi , and the mysteries of Isis . ”
104681	104687	104675	104676	the steward	491	“ The Lady Flavia Domitilla . ”
104688	104700	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ I have come , dear Domitia , with a petition , ”
104708	104721	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ And it is one you will wound me if you refuse . ”
104722	104732	104734	104734	Domitia	191	“ But who would wound so gentle a breast ? ”
104740	104753	104734	104734	Domitia	191	“ He must be heartless who draws a bow against a dove . ”
104754	104775	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ Hearken first to what I ask . I am bold — but my very feebleness inspires me with audacity . ”
104776	104783	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ What is it , then ? ”
104784	104810	104734	104734	Domitia	191	“ That you come with me to my villa for a little change of scene , air and society . It will do you good . ”
104811	104838	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ And I can not refuse . It is like your sweet spirit to desire nothing save what is kindly intended and does good to others . ”
104839	104889	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ As you have assented so graciously , I will push my advance a little further and say — Return with me to - day . Let us travel together . If you will — I have a double litter — and we can chatter as two magpies together . ”
104890	104895	104734	104734	Domitia	191	“ Magpies bring sorrow . ”
104896	104952	104702	104706	the widow of Flavius Clemens	3520	“ Nay , two — mirth — we have cast our sorrows behind us . You said I was a dove , so be it — a pair of doves , perhaps wounded , lamed — but we coo into each other ’s ear , and lay our aching hearts together and so obtain solace . ”
104953	104960	104962	104962	Domitia	191	“ I will refuse you nothing , ”
105140	105143	105145	105145	Flavia	333	“ How ! ”
105162	105168	105150	105150	she	333	“ you have the Fish ! ”
105169	105180	105150	105150	she	333	“ Yes , Glyceria gave it me — long ago . ”
105181	105189	105150	105150	she	333	“ Do you know what it means ? ”
105190	105213	105150	105150	she	333	“ Glyceria told me — but it is a dream , a beautiful fancy , nothing more . There is no evidence . ”
105214	105224	105150	105150	she	333	“ Domitia , you have not sought for it . ”
105225	105282	105150	105150	she	333	“ My cousin , Rome is full of religions . Some say the truth is in Sabazius , some in Isis , some in the stars , some in Mithras — a new importation — and some will go back to the old Gods of our Latin ancestors . But one and another all are naught . ”
105283	105289	105150	105150	she	333	“ How know you that ? ”
105290	105319	105150	105150	she	333	“ By the spirit that is within me . It can discern between what is true and false . Not that which promises best is the most real . ”
105320	105343	105150	105150	she	333	“ You are right , Domitia — that is truest and most real which meets and satisfies the seeking , aching heart . ”
105344	105350	105150	105150	she	333	“ And where is that ? ”
105351	105360	105150	105150	she	333	“ Where you have not sought for it . ”
105361	105379	105150	105150	she	333	“ If I were sure I would seek . But I am weary of disillusionings and disappointments . ”
105380	105387	105150	105150	she	333	“ Well — will you hear ? ”
105388	105405	105150	105150	she	333	“ I am not sure . I have met with too many disappointments to desire another . ”
105530	105540	105520	105520	she	333	said:—“Be it so . The Collect shall be here . ”
105560	105578	105553	105553	Flavia	333	said:—“You are right — the faculty of determination is seated in every breast . Inquire and choose . ”
105619	105714	105614	105614	she	3545	“ Domitia , I show you the utmost confidence . I must tell you something . You know how that the Christians have been persecuted under — I mean of late , and how we have suffered . My dear husband shed his blood for the cause , and he was but one among many . Now there is a respite granted , but how long it will last we know not . The laws against us stand unrepealed and any one who wishes us ill can set them in motion for our destruction . ”
105715	105724	105614	105614	she	3545	“ You do not think , Cousin — — ”
105725	105860	105614	105614	she	3545	“ Nay , hear me out , Domitia . You saw a young man approach me as we arrived here . He is what we term a deacon , and he came to announce that , if I saw fit , the Church would assemble in my house next first day of the week , that is the day after the Jewish Sabbath . It is customary with us to assemble together for prayer on that day , early , before dawn , sometimes in one house , then in another , so as to escape observation . And now , on the morrow — this assembly , which we term the Collect , will take place . Do thou tarry in thy chamber , and thou shalt be summoned when all have dispersed . ”
105861	105873	105614	105614	she	3545	“ Nay , I would see and hear what takes place . ”
105874	105889	105614	105614	she	3545	“ That may not be , Domitia , that is only for the initiated . ”
105890	105904	105614	105614	she	3545	“ But why secrecy if there be naught of which to be ashamed ? ”
105905	105962	105614	105614	she	3545	“ Our Master said , Give not that which is holy unto dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine . Tell me , Domitia , how would you endure were your father made a mock of , his sayings and acts parodied on the stage , and turned into a matter of low buffoonery ? ”
105972	106010	105968	105968	her	191	“ I see your answer in your face . So with our Great Master . His mysteries are holy , and we would preserve them from outrage . Now you understand why you can not be present . ”
106011	106018	105614	105614	she	3545	“ But I would not mock . ”
106019	106032	105614	105614	she	3545	“ It is our rule , to avoid the chance of profanity . ”
106033	106038	105614	105614	she	3545	“ As you will . ”
106039	106046	106048	106048	Flavia	333	“ There is one thing more , ”
106050	106100	106048	106048	Flavia	333	“ You will not be angry if I have sent to have poor Glyceria brought here . Owing to her infirmity she has not been able to be present at a gathering of the Church for a long time , and nothing could give her greater consolation and happiness . ”
106101	106112	106114	106114	Domitia	191	“ I am willing for anything that can cheer her , ”
106123	106151	106114	106114	Domitia	191	“ So — a freedwoman , and Euphrosyne , a slave , will be admitted where I am shut out — I , who was Empress — — ”
106152	106180	106048	106048	Flavia	333	“ Do not be offended . Is it not so in every sodality , that the members of the Club alone attend the gatherings of the Club . ”
106181	106188	106114	106114	Domitia	191	“ You are a Club then ? ”
106189	106197	106198	106198	Domitia	191	“ We are the worshippers of God . ”
106207	106243	106203	106203	Flavia	333	“ I hear them — they have come with Glyceria . I must see that she be cared for . The long journey to that frail and broken frame will have exhausted her slender powers . ”
106244	106250	106256	106256	her	333	“ And I will go , too”—with
106407	106443	106400	106400	Domitia	191	“ This comes of bringing her here . Had she been left at Gabii it would never have happened . Where is the fellow who threw her down?—Flavia ! have him whipped with the scorpion . ”
106449	106478	106400	106400	Domitia	191	“ It was an accident . He was not in fault . I am happy . It is the will of God — that is everything to me . ”
106479	106483	106484	106486	The paralyzed woman	1973	“ You suffer . ”
106769	106777	106778	106778	she	191	“ I vow a pig to Æsculapius ! ”
106781	106788	106778	106778	she	191	“ if he will recover her ! ”
106797	106817	106778	106778	she	191	“ What can Æsculapius do ? Whom has he succored at any time ? He is but a name . ”
106934	106969	106921	106921	She	191	“ And He ! the God of Glyceria — why had not He saved her from this fall ? Was He as powerless , as regardless , of His votaries as those of Olympus ? ”
107239	107331	107233	107233	her	191	“ I see Thee ! Thou — the joy of my heart , my hope and my portion forever ! Thee whom I have loved and longed for ! I hold Thee — I clasp Thy feet ! O give her to me — the dear mistress ! Take me , take me to Thyself — but ere I go — by Thy wounded hands — by Thy thorn - crowned head — by Thy pierced side — bring her to the light ! To the light ! To the light ! ”
107431	107435	107436	107436	she	3583	“ She sleeps , ”
107451	107472	107447	107447	she	3583	“ Not till after the Collect — at that I must be — bear me down — then only — — ”
108459	108466	108450	108458	A deacon standing at the top of the step	3678	said:—“Let us pray for the Emperor . ”
108478	108484	108450	108458	A deacon standing at the top of the step	3678	“ Lord , have mercy . ”
108491	108533	108486	108486	Clement	447	prayed:—“We beseech Thee , O Father , to look down upon the Emperor and to strengthen him against his foes , and to illumine his mind that he may rule in Justice , and be Thou his defence and strong tower . ”
108538	108545	108535	108536	the deacon	3681	again:—“Let us pray for the magistrates . ”
108658	108768	108655	108655	He	448	follows:—“This commandment which I command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off .... But the word is very nigh thee in thy heart and in thy mouth , that thou mayest do it . See , I have set before thee life and good , and death and evil .... I call heaven and earth to record this day that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing ; therefore choose life ... that thou mayest love the Lord thy God , and that thou mayest obey His voice , and that thou mayest cleave unto Him . ”
108805	108932	108804	108804	Luke	448	read:—“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me ; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek ; He hath sent me to bind up the broken - hearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound . To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord , and the day of vengeance of our God ; to comfort all that mourn .... To give to them that mourn beauty for ashes , the oil of joy for mourning , the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ; that they might be called Trees of Righteousness , the Planting of the Lord , that He might be glorified . ”
109021	109041	109015	109016	the congregation	3702	“ Praise the Lord , O my soul : and all that is within me praise His holy name . ”
109151	109179	109144	109144	Luke	448	“ Beloved , we have a letter written by the Blessed John — the Disciple that Jesus loved , and therefrom I will read a few words . ”
109192	109292	109181	109181	he	448	“ Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God ! therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew Him not . Beloved , now are we the sons of God ; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be ; but we know that , when He shall appear , we shall be like Him , for we shall see Him as He is . And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure . ”
109336	109355	109324	109324	he	3708	“ This is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another . ”
109386	109416	109417	109417	He	3708	“ Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you . We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . ”
109465	109476	109463	109464	the deacons	3712	returned:—“A woman — a weeping woman in a dark room . ”
109544	109551	109534	109534	she	191	said—“The light ! the glorious light ! ”
109587	109598	109581	109581	her	333	said:—“In the Joy of thy Lord , Face to Face ! ”
