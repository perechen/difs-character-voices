596	612	593	594	Mr. Grand	50	“ If you please sir , I would like to ask you a few questions . ”
613	625	627	628	Mr. Grand	50	“ Certainly , my lad , what have you to say ? ”
690	703	705	705	Joshua	48	“ If we say , sir , that Jesus Christ was God , ”
707	731	705	705	Joshua	48	“ surely all that He said and did must be the real right ? There can not be a better way than His ? ”
732	739	740	741	Mr. Grand	50	“ Surely not , my lad , ”
745	768	740	741	Mr. Grand	50	“ what else have you been taught all your life ? what else have you been saying in your catechism just now ? ”
769	782	784	784	Joshua	48	“ And His apostles and disciples , they showed the way too ? ”
786	814	784	784	Joshua	48	“ And they showed the way too , as you say ; and if you come up to half they taught you 'll do well , Joshua . ”
846	847	832	834	Joshua 's mother	160	“ scat”—our
864	886	888	888	Joshua	48	“ Yes ; but , sir , it is not of myself I am thinking , it is of the world , ”
890	904	888	888	Joshua	48	“ If we are Christians , why do n't we live as Christians ? ”
905	914	916	917	Mr. Grand	50	“ Ah indeed ! why do n't we ! ”
919	941	916	917	Mr. Grand	50	“ Because of the wickedness of the human heart ; because of the world , the flesh , and the devil ! ”
942	974	976	976	Joshua	48	“ Then , sir , if you feel this , why do n't you and all the clergy live like the apostles , and give what you have to the poor ? ”
993	1128	916	917	Mr. Grand	50	“ Why , when you read that verse , ‘ Whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ? ’ do you live in a fine house , and have grand dinners , and let Peggy Bray nearly starve in that old mud hut of hers , and widow Tregellis there , with her six children , and no fire or clothing for them ? I ca n't make it out , sir ! Christ was GOD ; and we are Christians ; yet we wo n't do as He ordered , though you tell us it is a sin that can never be forgiven if we dispute what the Bible says . ”
1129	1135	1137	1138	Mr. Grand	50	“ And so it is , ”
1141	1154	1137	1138	Mr. Grand	50	“ Who has been putting these bad thoughts in to your head ? ”
1155	1336	916	917	Mr. Grand	50	“ No one sir . I have been thinking for myself . Michael , out by Lion 's Den , is called an infidel ; he calls himself one ; and you preached last Sunday that no infidel can be saved ; but Michael helped Peggy and her base child when the Orphan Fund people took away her pension , because , as you yourself told her , she was a bad woman , and it was encouraging wickedness ; and he worked early and late for widow Tregellis and her children , and shared with them all he had , going short for them many a time . And I ca n't help thinking , sir , that Christ , who forgave all manner of sinners , would have helped Peggy with her base child , and that Michael , being an infidel and such a good man , is something like that second son in the Parable who said he would not do his Lord 's will when he was ordered , but who went all the same — ”
1337	1347	1349	1350	Mr. Grand	50	“ And that your Vicar is like the first ? ”
1353	1364	1366	1366	Joshua	48	“ Well , yes , sir , if you please , ”
1413	1419	1404	1404	others	166	“ What an extraordinary boy ! ”
1438	1498	1425	1426	Mr. Grand	50	“ These sinners are beyond the knowledge of an ignorant lad like you , Joshua ; and I advise you , before you turn questioner and reformer , to learn a little humility and respect for your betters . I consider you have done a very impertinent thing to - day , and I shall mark you for it ! ”
1499	1510	1512	1512	Joshua	48	“ I did not wish to be impertinent , sir , ”
1515	1584	1512	1512	Joshua	48	“ I want only to know the right of things from you , and to do as God has commanded , and Christ has shown us the way . And as you are our clergyman , and this is the House of God , I thought it the best plan to ask . I want only to know the truth ; and I can not make it out ! ”
1585	1592	1594	1595	Mr. Grand	50	“ Hold your tongue , sir ! ”
1597	1682	1594	1595	Mr. Grand	50	“ God has commanded you to obey your pastors and masters and all that are in authority over you ; so let us have no more of this folly . Believe as you are taught , and do as you are told , and do n't set yourself up as an independent thinker in matters you understand no more than the ass you drive . Go back to your place , sir , and another time think twice before you speak to your superiors . ”
1683	1702	1704	1704	Joshua	48	“ I meant no harm . I meant only the truth and to hear the things of God , ”
1736	1807	1726	1727	Mr. Grand	50	“ You will see , Freeman , that boy will go to the bad ; he will turn out a pestilent fellow , a freethinker and a democrat . Oh , I know the breed , with their ca nt about truth and the right ! He richly deserved a flogging to - day if ever boy did ; to dare to take me to task in my own church ! ”
1814	1845	1809	1810	Mr. Freeman	51	“ I do n't think he meant it for insolence . I think the lad was in earnest , though of course he should not have spoken as he did . ”
1846	1861	1863	1864	Mr. Grand	50	“ Earnest or not , he must be taught better manners for the future , ”
1945	1967	1968	1968	He	48	“ I thought only of what was right in the sight of God ; I never thought of man at all . ”
2155	2161	2166	2166	he	48	“ how to realise Christ . ”
2162	2165	2166	2166	he	48	“ Mother , ”
2182	2234	2166	2166	he	48	“ I mean when I grow up to live as our Lord and Saviour lived when He was on the earth . For though he is God in Heaven he was only man here ; and what He did we too can do with His help and the Holy Spirit 's . ”
2235	2243	2245	2246	his mother	179	“ He is our example , lad , ”
2249	2260	2245	2246	his mother	179	“ But I doubt lest you fall by over boldness . ”
2261	2285	2287	2287	Joshua	48	“ Then , if imitation is over bold , His life was a delusion , and He is not our example at all , ”
2289	2298	2287	2287	Joshua	48	“ Which is a saying of the devil . ”
3460	3467	3447	3447	he	48	“ They shall take up serpents . ”
3580	3610	3612	3612	Joshua	48	“ No , no , not mad , sir , because I believe the Bible , and have determined to lead a life after Christ 's word and example , ”
3614	3619	3621	3622	the doctor	240	“ Tut ! rubbish ! ”
3624	3688	3621	3622	the doctor	240	“ What you 've got to do , my lad , is to plane your wood smooth and make your joists firm . All this religious folly of yours has no sense in it . I tell you it will upset your brain , and that you are mad now , and will be madder if you do n't pull up in time . ”
3689	3708	3722	3723	the doctor	240	“ So Festus said to St. Paul , sir ; but he was not mad , nor am I. ”
3709	3720	3722	3723	the doctor	240	“ But what do you want to do , jackass ? ”
3733	3750	3722	3723	the doctor	240	“ What 's amiss with your poor foolish head that you ca n't take things easy ? ”
3751	3763	3765	3765	Joshua	48	“ I want to find out which is true , sir , ”
3767	3857	3765	3765	Joshua	48	“ the Bible which ordains certain ways of life ; or the Christian world which disobeys them . If Christ was God , there is but one way for us all . He could not have left us an imperfect example to be mended here and there as we think best for the convenience of society . He is God or man ; for , as things are , it is not God and man — Christ and Christians ; and I want to know which is the truth . ”
3858	3863	3865	3866	the doctor	240	“ Take my advice , ”
3869	4062	3865	3866	the doctor	240	“ put all these thoughts out of your head as quickly as you can . Get some work to do in a new part of the country , fall in love with some nice girl , and marry as soon as you can make a home for her . Give over reading the Bible for a time , and look up some pleasant stories and books of travel , and the like ; and leave off eating poison - berries and handling vipers . That 's the only life for you , depend upon it ; and though I am no theologian , I venture to say , that working honestly in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call you , going to church , kneeling out of beershops , and living like your respectable neighbours , is a far better kind of thing than all this high - flown religion you are hankering after . Depend upon it , our best religion is to do our duty , and to leave the care of our souls to those whose business it is to look after them . ”
4063	4073	4075	4075	Joshua	48	“ Thank you , sir ; you mean kindly , ”
4077	4101	4103	4104	the doctor	240	“ But God has given me other thoughts , and I must obey them if I would not sin against the Holy Ghost . ”
4415	4418	4419	4419	he	1589	“ Friends , ”
4422	4479	4480	4480	he	1589	“ it seems to me — indeed , I think we must all see it now — that His Word is not to be accepted literally , and not to be acted on in all its details . The laws of Nature are supreme , and even faith can not change them . Can it be , ”
4485	4540	4480	4480	he	1589	“ that much of that Word is a parable?—that Christ was truly as he says of Himself , the corner stone , but not the whole building?—and that we have to carry on the work in His spirit , but in our own way , and not merely to try and repeat His acts ? ”
5372	5383	5385	5386	the parson	288	“ Well , Joshua , and how are you doing ? ”
5503	5508	5499	5499	he	50	“ the common people , ”
5554	5557	5541	5541	he	50	“ many mansions ”
5670	5684	5652	5652	he	50	“ And why have you not been to church lately , my man ? ”
5751	5756	5758	5758	Joshua	48	“ Well , sir , ”
5760	5771	5758	5758	Joshua	48	“ I do n't go to church , you know . ”
5772	5790	5743	5743	God	53	“ No ? have you joined the chapel then ? Is that your latest fad , Joshua ? ”
5791	5801	5803	5803	Joshua	48	“ No , sir ; neither church nor chapel , ”
5805	5818	5820	5820	he	48	“ What ! a new light on your own account , hey ? ”
5828	5836	5820	5820	he	48	“ No sir , only a seeker . ”
5837	5886	5743	5743	God	53	“ The old paths not good enough for you?—the light that has lightened the Gentiles these eighteen hundred years and more not pure enough for an unwashed Cornish lad , planing wood at a carpenter 's bench and not able to speak two consecutive words of good English ? ”
5887	5899	5901	5901	Joshua	48	“ I must answer for my conscience to God , sir , ”
5903	5932	5934	5935	Mr. Grand	50	“ And your clergyman , appointed by God and the State to be your guide , what of him ? Has he no authority in his own parish ? ”
5938	5998	5934	5935	Mr. Grand	50	“ Does it never strike you , my fine fellow , that in thinking for yourself , as you call it , you are flying in the face both of Divine ordinances and the laws of man , and that you are entering on the sin of schism on the one hand , and of rebellion on the other ? ”
5999	6005	6007	6007	Joshua	48	“ Look here , sir , ”
6015	6115	6007	6007	Joshua	48	“ if I speak plainly , I mean it for no offence ; but my heart burns within me and I must speak out . I deny your appointment as a God - given leader of souls . The Church is but the old priesthood as it existed in the days of our Lord , and is , as much as that was , the blind leading the blind . There are good and kind gentlemen among you , but not Christians according to Christ . I see no sacrifice of the world , no brotherhood with the poor — ”
6116	6120	6122	6123	Mr. Grand	50	“ The poor ! ”
6126	6158	6122	6123	Mr. Grand	50	“ what would you have , you young fool ? The poor have the laws of their country to protect them , and the Gospel preached to them for their salvation . ”
6159	6284	6007	6007	Joshua	48	“ Yes , and in preaching that — that is , in giving two full services on Sundays , and reading the marriage - service and the burial - service and the like of that when you are wanted — you discharge your conscience of all other obligations towards them , and think you have done enough . You never seem to remember that when Christ preached the Gospel to the poor it was to make them equal with the rich . Why , sir , the poor of our day are the lepers of Christ 's ; and who among you , Christian priests , consorts with them ? Who ranks the man above his station , or the soul above the man ? ”
6285	6294	6296	6297	Mr. Grand	50	“ Now , we have come to it ! ”
6299	6356	6296	6297	Mr. Grand	50	“ I thought I should touch the secret spring at last ! And you would like us to associate with you as equals?—Is that it , Joshua ? Gentlemen and common men hob - and - nob together , and no distinctions made ? You to ride in our carriages , and perhaps marry our daughters ? ”
6393	6470	6485	6485	his	50	“ That 's just it , sir . You are gentlemen , as you say , but not the followers of Christ . If you were , you would have no carriages to ride in , and your daughters would be what Martha and Mary and Lydia and Dorcas were , women of no station , bent only on serving God and the saints , and their title to ladyhood founded on their degrees of goodness . ”
6471	6479	6481	6482	Mr. Grand	50	“ Going in for socialism , Joshua ? ”
6489	6518	6485	6485	his	50	“ A little radicalism , a little methodism , and a great deal of self - assurance — that seems to me to be about where you are ! ”
6519	6530	6532	6532	Joshua	48	“ Going in for no isms at all , sir , ”
6534	6545	6532	6532	Joshua	48	“ Only for the truth as it is in Christ ! ”
6546	6560	6562	6563	Mr. Grand	50	“ Shall I tell you what would be the very thing for you ? ”
6567	6574	6576	6576	Joshua	48	“ Yes , sir ; what ? ”
6579	6605	6607	6608	the parson	288	“ This whip across your shoulders!—and , by George , if I were not a clergyman I would lay it there , with a will ! ”
6711	6721	6722	6722	he	48	“ God shall smite thee , thou whited wall ! ”
6727	6870	6722	6722	he	48	“ Is this your boasted leadership of souls?—this your learned solving of difficulties?—this your fatherly guidance of your flock ? ‘ Feed my lambs’—with what ? with stones for bread — with insult for sincerity — with the gentleman 's disdain for the poor thought of the artisan — with class insolence for spiritual difficulties culties ! Of a surety , Christ has to come again to repeat the work which you priests and churches have destroyed and made of no effect , and to strip you of your ill - used power . You are the gentleman , sir , and I am only a poor carpenter 's son ; but I stand against you now — man against man — soul against soul — and I spurn you with a deeper and more solemn scorn than you have spurned me ! ”
6999	7011	7041	7041	Joshua	48	“ You 'll be as bad as Joshua to Parson Grand , ”
7115	7118	7119	7119	he	322	“ No , ”
7124	7138	7119	7119	he	322	“ some kinds of anger are righteous ; and this was of them . ”
7295	7298	7299	7300	Mr. Grand	50	“ canter , ”
7739	7743	7737	7737	they	357	“ Our Father , ”
7746	7751	7733	7733	GOD	53	“ God of Love , ”
8207	8297	8201	8201	he	72	“ See , there is no such great difference between us after all ! I do not contradict you . Say what you will about the sun , and the age of the earth , the relations of the universe , and the gradual evolution of man , nothing that you advance disturbs me . I only supplement you , and add the divine grace of spiritual truth , which is beyond your analysis . You are right and I am right ; let us be friends and brothers . ”
8862	8865	8844	8846	All the poor	451	“ sinless Cains ”
8945	8948	8949	8949	he	48	“ Look , ”
8954	9183	8949	8949	he	48	“ what they have made of me ; of an unskilled artisan , no schoolman even of his day , and a vagrant preacher living by charity , they have made a king ; of a man , a god ; of a preacher of universal tolerance , the head of a persecuting religion ; of a life , a dogma ; of an example , a church . Here am I , Jesus the Nazarene , the son of Joseph and Mary , as I lived on earth ; poor , unlearned , a plebeian , and a socialist , at war with the gentlemen and ladies of my society , the enemy of forms , of creeds , of the priestly class of respectabilities ; and there you see my modern travesty , this jewelled , ornate , exclusive Ecclesiastical Christianity , who is the ancient Pharisee revived . To you , and to such as you , is given the task of bringing men back to the creed that I preached . And if in securing the essence of the creed you forget the Founder , and call my doctrine by another name than mine , so be it . The world wants the thing , not the label ; and Christ - likeness , not Ecclesiastical Christianity , is the best Saviour of men . ”
9233	9240	9241	9241	he	461	“ Something seemed to bid me , ”
9251	9470	9472	9472	Joshua	48	“ I ran off over the down as fast as I could , and caught Peggy on the Tintagel Road . She was drunk , dirty , and crying . I took her by the hand . ‘ Peggy , woman , ’ I said , ‘ dry your eyes , and come along with me . ’ I spoke so sudden , I startled her , and so a little sobered her . Then I took her by the arm and led her to mother 's cottage . ‘ Here , mother , ’ I said ; ‘ here is a bit of Christ - work for you to do . Take this poor creature , in her dirt and vileness as she is , and cleanse her . You believe and know that God 's love did that for the world : we are less pure than Christ , but we hold ourselves too fine to follow His example in that ! Love her , mother ; she is your sister — and maybe your love can heal her . ’ Poor mother ! she did n't like the task . She cried over it , and said that I put a burden on her she could not bear ; but I held to my point , ”
9479	9596	9472	9472	Joshua	48	“ and she yielded . Peggy stayed in our house for over a month , and mother was ill - called for her work . Not that she much cared , I fancy . I do n't know , however , whether she did or not ; she never said much . And though Peggy broke out again and went to the bad as before , yet a month 's experience of loving - kindness and cleanly living was something . At all events , it was practical Christianity ; and if it did Peggy herself little or no good permanently , it was the right thing to do , and mother was so far benefited . ”
10638	10645	10646	10646	he	1664	“ You have captivated my heart , ”
10652	10719	10646	10646	he	1664	Superior—“you charm my tastes — you delight my imagination ; but you have not mastered my reason . Fairly reasoned out I do not think your position is tenable . You are Roman Catholics under another name ; irregulars claiming to be received on the footing of the acknowledged Body Guard ; you are infallible yet eclectic , and I can not concede infallibility to eclecticism . ”
10720	10734	10736	10737	the Superior	514	“ But have you no reverence for the virtues of obedience and humility ? ”
10739	10789	10646	10646	he	1664	“ Can not you quell that questioning spirit of yours for the sake of the Church 's honour , and to maintain a close front ? Who can hope to do anything as an isolated unit against a host ? Is not the whole secret of strength in organisation ? ”
10790	10803	10805	10805	Joshua	48	“ But I can not become part of a system for expediency ! ”
10808	10921	10805	10805	Joshua	48	“ Some men may , but it is not given to me to be able to stifle my own individual conscience for any considerations of party strength . I have got it to do — to find out if practical Christianity is possible in the world , and to learn why , being Christians , we are not of Christ . I know I should get something of the kind in such institutions as St. Vincent de Paul and the like , but I should have there so much in excess of the simple faith I love , that I can not join them . I must go on my way alone . ”
10922	10928	10930	10931	the Superior	514	“ And you will fail , ”
10933	11002	10930	10931	the Superior	514	“ No one man can succeed in such a search as yours . Guided by wise counsels and supported by authority you might come to satisfactory conclusions ; but adrift on the wide sea of dissent , and private opinion , and individual vidual interpretation , you are lost . To the Church came the promise and the Spirit ; believe in the Church is your only ark . ”
11003	11019	11021	11021	Joshua	48	“ If any , then the Roman Catholic at once , frankly and without reserve , ”
11023	11152	11021	11021	Joshua	48	“ If the keys of life and death are held by a governing body , they are surely held within the Vatican ; and if I must enter into the virtue of unquestioning obedience , I would rather accept it in its totality . Your ritualism seems to me like Canute and the waves . ‘ Thus far and no farther , ’ you say to private inquiry ; and ‘ only so much and so much will we take of tradition and the vitality of past ages . ’ Where is your standing - point ? where your logical foothold ? By what authority do you reject and accept at will ? and by what measure sure do you set the length of the tether of reason ? ”
11153	11174	11176	11177	the Superior	514	“ If you are for the whole history of the Church you must read more closely than you have done , ”
11182	11188	11190	11190	Joshua	48	“ Forgive me , sir , ”
11193	11334	11190	11190	Joshua	48	“ I know you will , whatever I say ; for I am speaking now heart - open , man to man , and there is no question of discourtesy or of courtesy ; but with all my personal love and admiration for the professors of your creed , the creed itself is tainted with an insincerity I can not digest . And your position , standing as you do in the front , between yearning souls demanding the support of authority , the moral protection of infallibility , and the only Western Church that can give it logically , is , to my way of thinking , both dangerous to yourselves and cruel to the people . Why do you not go over to Rome at once , sir , since your commission is self - appointed and irregular ? ”
11340	11345	11346	11346	he	514	“ I never argue , ”
11349	11387	11346	11346	he	514	“ for I never found any good to come of it . These questions are matters for spiritual reception , not dialectical discussion . Use the appointed means and the grace of our Lord will find you . ”
11388	11407	11408	11408	Joshua	48	“ I have used them ; I do use them ; and yet I can not get conviction , ”
11417	11420	11422	11423	the Superior	514	“ Persevere ! ”
11426	11435	11422	11423	the Superior	514	“ the promises of God never failed yet . ”
11620	11623	11624	11624	he	48	“ What , ”
11632	11843	11624	11624	he	48	“ if the spiritual life is as little real as that act of faith in which we all failed?—if what we call conviction is only a state of the mind — a subjective condition owning no absolute without — a state as good and righteous for the Buddhist , for the Mohammedan , for the Hindoo , as for the various Christian denominations ? We are all convinced . Every creed has had its martyrs and enthusiasts and its well - trained , well - balanced professors , all as firmly convinced of its truth and of its being the one truth only , as the Superior is convinced of the absolute rightness of Anglicanism , as the Pope believes in the infallibility of his Church , and the whole Christian world in the impregnability of the Bible and its literal exactness . I can not focus God as these men are able to do ; and yet I feel it better to be rooted than wandering , as I am wandering now , unfixed and unnourished . If you are rooted you can grow ; but floating , hovering , what is the soul but as one of those winged seeds carried about by the wind and fastened nowhere ? ”

11852	11963	11849	11849	I	0	“ it is better to be unfastened from a fallacy than to be rooted on it . There must be the moment of suspension when you are in progress . To mount a ladder you must leave the rung on which you stand , and before you have your foot on the other it is nowhere — only in space . The time of doubt is a time of pain , but it must be passed through if we would believe the better thing . To have lost the old land - marks — left them behind us — is not necessarily to have lost the right way , Joshua ! ”

12710	12713	12714	12714	he	48	“ Friends , ”
12717	13484	12714	12714	he	48	“ I have at last cleared my mind and come to a Belief . I have proved to myself the sole meaning of Christ ; it is Humanity . I relinquish the miracles , the doctrine of the Atonement , the doctrine of the Divinity of Jesus , and the unelastic finality of His knowledge . He was the product of His time ; and if He went beyond it in some things , He was only abreast of it in others . His views of human life were oriental ; His images are drawn from the autocratic despotism of the great and the slavish submission of the humble , and there is never a word of reprobation of these conditions , as conditions , only of the individuals according to their desert . He did His best to remedy that injustice , so far as there might be solace in thought , by proclaiming the spiritual equality of all men , and the greater value of worth than status ; but He left the social question where he found it — paying tribute even to Cæsar without reluctance — His mind not being ripe to accept the idea of a radical revolution , and His hands not strong enough to accomplish it , if even He had imagined it . But neither He nor His disciples imagined more than the communism of their own sect ; they did not touch the throne of Cæsar , or the power of the hereditary irresponsible Lord . Their communism never aimed at the equalization of classes throughout all society . Hence , I can not accept the beginning of Christian politics as final , but hold that we have to carry on the work under different forms . The modern Christ would be a politician . His aim would be to raise the whole platform of society , he would not try to make the poor contented with a lot in which they can not be much better than savages or brutes . He would work at the destruction of caste , which is the vice at the root of all our creeds and institutions . He would not content himself with denouncing sin as merely spiritual evil ; he would go into its economic causes , and destroy the flower by cutting at the roots — poverty and ignorance . He would accept the truths of science , and he would teach that a man saves his own soul best by helping his neighbour . That , indeed , He did teach ; and that is the one solid foothold I have . Friends , Christianity according to Christ is the creed of human progress , not that of resignation to the avoidable miseries of class ; it is the confession that society is elastic , and that no social arrangements are final ; that morals themselves are only experimental , and that no laws are divine — that is , absolute and unchangeable by circumstance . It is the doctrine of evolution , of growth ; and just as Christ was the starting - point of a new era of theological thought , so is the present the starting - point of a new era of social fact . Let us then strip our Christianity of all the mythology , the fetichism that has grown about it . Let us abandon the idolatry with which we have obscured the meaning of the Life ; let us go back to the MAN , and carry on His work in its essential spirit in the direction suited to our times and social conditions . Those of you who still cling to the mystical aspect of the creed , and who prefer to worship the God rather than imitate the Man , must here part company with me . You know that , as a youth , I went deep into the life of prayer and faith ; as a man , I have come out into the upper air of action ; into the understanding that Christianity is not a creed as dogmatised by churches , but an organization having politics for its means and the equalization of classes as its end . It is Communism . Friends ! the doctrine trine I have chosen for myself is Christian Communism — and my aim will be , the Life after Christ in the service of humanity , without distinction of persons or morals . The Man Jesus is my master , and by His example I will walk . ”

I wish her to be kept virtuous through self - respect , and by being placed beyond the need of going back to such a life . I do not want her to be weakened by a self - torturing contrition for the past , or terrified at the prospect of eternal damnation for the future . I want her to be lifted up , not cast down . ”

29740	29791	29738	29738	Joshua	48	“ It sounds a strange confession to make , but no one will work with me . Sects keep only to themselves or their affiliations ; and I , who belong to no sect , am looked on as an enemy by all because I am an enemy to none . ”

29814	29830	29831	29831	Joshua	48	“ No movement can succeed which is not backed by men of birth and money . ”

29863	29866	29868	29869	Lord X.	103	“ Oh ! ”
29873	29895	29868	29869	Lord X.	103	“ a low fellow might strike out an idea , but it would want a man of position to develop it . ”
29896	29904	29905	29905	Joshua	48	“ Well , perhaps you are right , ”
29908	29938	29905	29905	Joshua	48	“ For , after all , Christianity owes more to Paul than to Jesus ; and the Pauline development has struck deeper and spread wider than the Christ original . ”
29939	29943	29945	29946	Lord X.	103	“ Just so , ”
29947	29987	29989	29989	Joshua	48	“ The one being example , both difficult to follow and subversive of the existing state of things ; the other dogma which ranks the intellectual acceptance of a creed above the revolutionary ethics on which it is based , ”
29991	29997	29989	29989	Joshua	48	“ But , Mr. Davidson ! ”
30002	30090	29999	30000	Lord X.	103	“ surely even you , enthusiast as you are , must acknowledge that it would be impossible to go back to the practices of early Christian times ? The staff and the scrip were all very well in their day , but they would scarcely do now . Society has become more complex and intricate since then ; it would be out of all question to have the common purse and live in the barbaric simplicity of apostolic times . Times change , and manners with them . ”
30091	30101	30103	30103	Joshua	48	“ When is just my difficulty , my lord , ”
30105	30137	29999	30000	Lord X.	103	“ For if modern society is right , then Christ was wrong ; and we have to look elsewhere than to Him for a solution of our moral and social problems . ”
30138	30148	30150	30151	Lord X.	103	“ I would not pronounce so crudely as that , ”
30152	30164	29999	30000	Lord X.	103	“ Say rather that a further development may reconcile our differences . ”
30165	30210	29999	30000	Lord X.	103	“ So be it , sir ; yet if this is so , we are still in the same position as before , and the life of Christ , as related in the Bible , is not the absolute example for us to follow . ”
30211	30221	30223	30224	Lord X.	103	“ About that you must form your own opinion , ”
30314	30321	30299	30299	I	0	” Joshua smiled a little sadly . “

31025	31030	31020	31020	you	0	” said Joshua simply : “

31107	31226	31105	31105	Us	1285	” Joshua did not answer . He said afterwards that , having made his declaration honestly , he felt it would have been ungenerous to have carried the conversation further on that line . While accepting my lord 's help it was scarcely the thing to depreciate it ; so the talk then drifted or rather settled on all that he had been doing in Church - court and the neighbourhood — on his night - school , his charities , his hospitality to thieves and the like ; and the results ; those whom he might fairly count as his successes , with those who had been as yet his failures . He never allowed more than this “
31230	31231	31105	31105	Us	1285	” “
31254	31260	31247	31247	they	1286	” he used to say . “
31329	31330	31331	31331	You	1293	” “
31346	31372	31331	31331	You	1293	” said Lord X. , with that curious mixture of cynicism and philanthropy , kindness and satire , earnestness and levity , that characterised him . “
31375	31379	31331	31331	You	1293	” Joshua answered ; “
31414	31415	31416	31416	You	1293	” “
31426	31439	31423	31424	Mr. Davidson	87	” said Lord X. , suddenly rising and drawing on his gloves . “
31482	31489	31473	31473	You	1293	” he added , and smiled . “
31497	31500	31490	31490	I	0	” said Joshua “
31530	32631	31524	31524	I	0	” This was the first time that I had seen Joshua really elated with hope of help from the outside . He knew that Lord X. was a man of immense wealth , and that he could , if he would , do wonders for his poor friends . But he did not know how shallow his philanthropic zeal was ; how much more a matter of mere amusement than of vital principle . His work among the poor was the work of a superior ; and his estimate of his own class , and therefore of himself as a peer , was so curiously great , that he thought his very presence among them ought to prove a kind of balm and moral styptic to all their wounds . He was willing to give when the fit took him ; but he would have resented the doctrine of duty , or the right to take . The poor were as curious specimens to him . He never regarded them as men and women like himself and his class . He scarcely gave them credit for ordinary human feeling even ; for he used to say that affections and nerves were both matters of education and refinement , and that the uneducated and unrefined neither loved nor felt as the others . Perhaps he was right . I am not physiologist enough to know much about nerves and pain and the difference of education , so far as that goes ; but I think I have seen as much real affection , as much passionate self - abandoning , self - sacrificing love among the poor as there is among the rich . It may be more uncouth , its demonstration more simple too , and less elegantly expressed , but it is there all the same , and maybe in fuller quantity than with fashionable folks who really seem too idle and dispersed to be able to love with either vigour or concentration . Furthermore , philanthropy to Lord X. was an occupation and a reputation . He had no turn for abstract polities , no head for diplomacy , no taste for literature ; he was not all artist nor a mechanician , but he was ambitious , and he liked distinction . So , dabbling among the poor , and touching the grave social problems besetting them delicately , following them to their haunts and relieving their immediate distress , pleased both his kind heart and his vanity ; and he did substantial good of a fragmentary kind , if his motives would scarce bear severe scrutiny . For myself I did not augur much from the association . Less spiritual and less single - minded than my friend , I could also judge better than he of his own power of fascination . Hence I could discern more clearly than he , how much of Lord X. 's offer of help was the genuine movement of his own soul , and how much was due to the curiosity and amusement which the study of a life and character at once so fresh and whole - hearted as his awakened and promised . But it was not for me to speak , or throw cold water on what might turn out to be such a boon to the cause . If Joshua had wanted my advice , he would have asked it . As he did not ask it , I considered him best able to judge for himself . And yet sometimes I have been sorry that I did not speak . THIS was Joshua 's first introduction into a wealthy house of the upper classes ; and from the retinue of servants in their gorgeous liveries thronging the hall , to the little lapdog on its velvet cushion , the luxury and lavishness he saw everywhere almost stupified him . To a man earning , say some twenty - five shillings a week , and living on less than half — sharing with those poorer than himself , and content to go short that others might be satisfied — the revelation of Lord X. 's house was a sharp and positive pain . The starvation he , the nobleman , had seen in his wanderings — starvation in all probability relieved for to - day ; but to - morrow and the day after and for all future time , till the pauper 's grave closed over all?—and then had come back to an abundance , a fastidiousness , of which the very refuse would have been salvation to hundreds ; the miserable dwellings he visited , mere styes of filth , immodesty , and vice , where the seeds of physical disease and moral corruption are sown broadcast and from earliest infancy — and then returned to a dwelling like a fairy palace , where every nook and corner was perfect , redolent of all kinds of sweetness and loveliness — to a man of the people like Joshua , fairly oppressive in its richness and grandeur ; the gaunt and famine - wasted men and women and children that he had so often met , the little ones brutally treated , half starved , sworn at , and knocked about , swarming through reeking courts and alleys where the very air of heaven was poisonous — and the lady 's lap - dog , with its dainty food , its tender care , well washed , combed , curled , scented , adorned , on a velvet footstool , a toy bought for it to play with : and that man and that woman — this lord and lady—-were professing Christians , went regularly to church , believed that Christ was very God , and that every word of the Bible was inspired ! It was habit ; but at first sight it looked incomprehensible to one who lived among the poor , and was of them . Lady X. soon came into the room where Joshua and Lord X. were . She was a tall , fair , languid woman , kindly natured but selfish , dissatisfied with her life as it was yet unable to devise anything better for herself ; having no interest anywhere , without children , and evidently not as much in love with her husband as model wives usually are : a woman whose intelligence and physique clashed , the one being restless and the other indolent . Every now and then she took up her husband 's “
32634	33261	33264	33264	madam	1299	” partly out of complaisance to him , partly , from profound weariness with her life , and also from the natural kind - heartedness which made her like to do good - natured things and to give pleasure to others . But she soon abandoned then and set them adrift . She was a woman with great curiosity but no tenacity ; full of a soft sensual kind of passion that led her into danger as much from idleness as from vice ; she loved out of idleness , and worked out of idleness . It was a gain to her to be interested in anything — whether it was the fashion of the day or the salvation of a human soul ; but there was no spirit of self - sacrifice in her , and she would have considered it an impertinence if she had been asked to do a hair's - breadth more than she desired of her own free - will . Had she been born poor , she might have been a grand woman ; as she was , she was just a fine lady whose nobler nature was stifled under the weight of idleness and luxury . But she liked Joshua , and took to him kindly . She gave him at that first interview a really handsome sum of money for his poorer friends ; she promised clothes and soup - tickets , books for his school , toys for his children , good food for his sick . The simple yet so grand earnestness of the man interested her , and she too felt as every one else did , that here was a master - spirit which had a claim to all men 's reverence and admiration . She was not satisfied with his first visit , but Joshua must go to see her again ; and after he had been there twice , she of herself offered to come and see him in his lodgings , over the little sweet - stuff shop which Mary Prinsep kept . And Joshua did not forbid her . Was there ever such an incongruity ? The street — East - street — in which we lived , was too narrow for her carriage to come down , so she had to walk the distance to Joshua 's rooms . And I shall never forget the sight . Her dainty feet were clothed in satin on which glittered buckles that looked like diamonds ; her dress was of apple - blossom - coloured silk that trailed behind her ; her bonnet seemed to be just a feather and a veil ; she wore some light lace thing about her that looked like a cloud more than a fabric ; and her arms and neck were covered with chains and lockets and bracelets . She was like a fairy queen among the gnomes and blackamoors of an underground mine , like a sweet - scented rose - bush in the midst of a refuse heap as she came picking her way with courage , but with exaggerated delicacy , her footman in his blue and silver at her back , and the mob of the street staring , too much astonished at such an apparition to jeer . When she came into the little shop and asked for Joshua , I was standing in the doorway ( it was on a Sunday ) between the shop and back room ; and for the first time I saw Mary in an ugly light . She turned quite white as the lady came in , and instead of answering , looked round to me with an agony in her face that was indescribable . “
33266	33272	33273	33273	he	1300	” I said coming forward ; “
33279	33280	33273	33273	he	1300	” “
33288	33340	33282	33282	you	1299	” then asked Mary , the look of pain still in her large fixed eyes ; and I thought that the lady , looking at her — for Mary was young and very pretty , as I have said — looked uneasy too . At all events , she looked haughty . “
33343	33359	33282	33282	you	1299	” she said ; but she turned and spoke to me , not to Mary . “
33375	33474	33367	33368	Lady X.	104	” I ran upstairs and told him ; and Joshua , without changing his countenance one whit , as if lords and ladies in gorgeous array were our natural visitors and what we were used to every day , came down and greeted the lady as he would have greeted the baker 's wife — neither more nor less respectfully ; which means , that he was respectful to every one . Lady X. made a step forward when he came into the shop , and the blood flew over her face as she gave him her hand . “
33493	33515	33477	33477	you	1303	” she said , with the most undefinable but unmistakable accent of coaxing in the voice . And Joshua saying quietly ; “
33556	33563	33564	33564	They	1306	” gave her his hand smiling . “
33576	33582	33571	33571	I	0	” said my lady kindly . “
33608	33609	33599	33599	I	0	” “
33635	33700	33701	33701	John	84	” said Joshua moving towards the stairs . And again the lady blushed ; and her long silk skirts trailed behind her with a curious rustling noise ; and we heard her light bootheels go tap , tap , up the stairs , and her chains and trinkets jingle . Then Mary turned to me , and said with a wild kind of look ; “
33741	33754	33755	33755	Mary	64	” She turned her face to the window and burst into tears . “
33761	33818	33755	33755	Mary	64	” I said , vaguely ; for I was shocked , and did not rightly understand her . I seemed to feel something I could not give a name to — a pain and a queer kind of doubt ; but indeed it was all chaotic , and all I knew was that I was sorry . “
33822	33831	33755	33755	Mary	64	” I went on trying to comfort her , “
33877	33878	33879	33879	She	64	” “
33886	33978	33879	33879	She	64	” was all that Mary would say ; and I could only wonder at an outburst unlike anything I had ever seen before . My lady stayed a long time upstairs , and poor Mary 's agony during her visit never relaxed . At last she came down , flushed and radiant . Her eyes were softer and darker , her face looked younger and more tender ; she even glanced kindly at me as she passed me , saying to Joshua in a voice as sweet as a silver bell ; “
33999	34022	33997	33997	Mary	64	” but she was not quite so tender to Mary ; and she added , in rather a displeased tone of voice ; “
34042	34043	34039	34040	men lodgers	1316	” “
34065	34070	34049	34049	you	2063	” said Joshua gently . “
34086	34087	34083	34083	she	1320	” “
34105	34153	34102	34102	you	0	” said my lady coldly . She shook hands then with Joshua , but , with her hand still in his , turned to him and , with the sweetest smile I have ever seen on woman 's face , said in the same strange caressing way ; “
34197	34198	34186	34186	I	0	” “
34202	34233	34186	34186	I	0	” said Joshua , and led her , still holding her hand , out from the shop and into the little street to where her carriage was waiting for her . “
34242	34467	34240	34240	John	84	” said Mary ; and with a great sob she ran away and shut herself up in her own room , She would have been ashamed I know , to let Joshua see that she was crying , and all for nothing , too ; only because a fine lady , smelling of sweet scents and wearing a rich silk gown , had passed through the shop . As for him , he came back without a ruffle on his quiet , mild face . There was no flush of gratified vanity on it ; nothing but just that inward , absorbed look , that look of peace and love which beautified him at all times . As he passed through , he looked round for Mary ; but I told him she was bad with her head ; and as this had the effect of sending him into her room to look after her , poor Mary 's attempt at concealment came to nothing . But I do n't think Joshua found out why she was crying . Many a day after this my lady 's carriage came to the entrance of our wretched street , and my lady herself , like a radiant vision , picked her way among garbage and ruffianism down to the little sweet - stuff shop where ha'pennyworths of “
34469	34822	34823	34823	You	1327	” were sold to young children by a girl who had once been a street - walker , and where the upstairs rooms were tenanted by two journeymen carpenters . It was an anomaly that could not last ; but the very sharpness of the contrast gave it interest in her eyes ; and while the novelty continued it was like a scene out of a play in which she was the heroine . So , at least , I judged her ; and the more I think of the whole affair , the more sure I feel that I am right . And then Joshua 's handsome face and dignity of look and manner might count for something . She ( the lady ) was truly good and helpful to Joshua all the time this fad of hers lasted ; for that it was only a fad , without stability or roots , the sequel proved . She brought him clothes and money , and seemed ready to do all she could for him . He had only to tell her that he wanted such and such help , and she gave it , aye , like a princess ! What took place between them neither I nor any one can say . Joshua never opened his lips on the subject ; and after that day , by tacit consent all round , the name of Lord and Lady X. was a dead letter among us . All I know is , that one day , when she had come down to our place as so often now , my lady , flushed , haughty , trembling too , but changed somehow , with a sad , disordered face instead of the half - sleepy sweetness usual to it , came downstairs — not this time holding Joshua 's hand ; he following her , pale and troubled - looking ; that she passed through the little shop quickly and impatiently , with never a glance towards Mary or me ; that at the door she turned round , and said sharp “
34846	34871	34839	34839	I	0	” and this Joshua answered with more tenderness and humility of tone and manner than I have ever seen or heard in him before ; “
34891	34953	34959	34959	Davidson	87	” And that he followed her out , bareheaded , but at a little distance from her — not beside her . This was the last time we saw her ; nor did Lord X. keep up any association with my friend . And I heard afterwards , quite accidentally , that he , had said soon after this , he really “
34977	35018	34961	34961	he	1274	” But word came to us both that my lady had found out all about Mary , and that she had expressed herself insulted and revolted at Joshua 's allowing her to enter a house kept by such a creature . “
35030	35035	34961	34961	he	1274	” she had said ; “
35094	35402	35064	35064	he	48	” So this first and last attempt at aristocratic co - operation fell to the ground ; and Society peremptorily refused to endorse a man who had set himself to live the life after Christ . If Joshua was sorry for the loss he had so mysteriously sustained , poor Mary was not . All during the lady 's visits she had drooped and pined , till I thought she was in a bad way , and going to be worse . Ah ! this was a bitter time to me , for I loved her like my own ; and I loved Joshua and his work and his life better than my own life ; and I was perplexed , and in a manner torn to pieces , among so many feelings . But she revived after the day when the lady passed through the shop with her sad , proud , disordered face , and when Joshua came back from seeing her to her carriage , like a man who has had a blow and is still dazed by it . She waited on him after this , more assiduously than ever . She seemed to live only to please him . The plate was the very perfection of cleanliness . Even my lady 's palace could not have been more wholesome or more pure . The squalor of the shell , so to speak , and the poverty of the inside , was concealed or made to be forgotten by the exquisite neatness and cleanliness with which it was all kept ; and when Joshua 's countenance came back again , as it did after awhile , to its usual sweet serenity , Mary 's also came to its peace , and the cloud that had hung over it like a distemper passed away . “
35410	35422	35408	35408	John	84	” he said to me one day , some time after : “
35538	35550	35530	35530	them	1539	” he added , as if by an after - thought , “
35626	35627	35634	35634	Joshua	48	” “
35646	35649	35650	35652	The very poor	1343	” said I. “
35704	35705	35706	35706	I	0	” “
35710	35714	35706	35706	I	0	” he answered . “
36114	36115	36116	36116	I	0	” “
36126	36132	36118	36118	Joshua	48	” was Mary 's comment . “
36149	36461	36462	36462	You	1371	” I HAVE said so much of the personal charities of Joshua that I seem to have thrown into the shade , by comparison , his political life and action ; and yet this was the more important of the two . The extreme section of republican working men , though they did not go in for his religious views , made use of his political zeal ; and when work was bad to get , sometimes he was sent as a delegate , sometimes he went of his own accord , to the various towns that needed either encouragement or awakening ; where he gave lectures on the necessity of labour keeping a close front against the serried ranks of capital ; on the lawfulness and desirability of trades ' unions and strikes , when occasion demands ; on the political worth of a republic that grows naturally out of monarchy and oligarch , as manhood grows out of childhood ; on the need of the working classes raising themselves to a higher level in mind and circumstance than that which they occupy now ; on the beauty of social and moral freedom ; and on the right of each man to a fair share of the primary essentials for good living . And all this was mixed up with that fervid practical Christianity of his , which gave a new and holier aspect to every question he handled . Joshua believed in the religion of politics . He often said that , were Christ to come again in this day , He would be more of a politician than a theologian ; and that he would teach men to work for the coming of the kingdom of heaven on earth , rather through the general elevation of the material condition of the masses than by either ritual or dogma . “
36473	36483	36462	36462	You	1371	” I have heard him say more than once , “
36494	36496	36485	36485	you	1371	” and “
36524	37501	36462	36462	You	1371	” No man was more convinced than he that sin and misery are the removable results of social circumstances , and that poverty , ignorance , and class - distinctions consequent , are at the root of all the crimes and wretchedness ness afloat . The evil lying in that great curse of partial civilisation — that upas tree of caste — by which this Christian world of ours , with its religion of brotherhood and socialism , is overshadowed , pained him most of all . The caste of the rich , with its product , the class antagonism of the poor — what a sorry satire on the religion of Jesus of Nazareth , that poor , unlearned man of the people , whom we have exalted into God and now worship with gorgeous ceremonial , while despising every one of the social doctrines He and His disciples preached ! However , Joshua did his best to rouse men to a consciousness of Christ , and to the acceptance of His teaching of human equality ; and though steadily closed to all doctrines of violence , was always the passionate upholder of the doctrine of duty on the one side and the theory of rights on the other . He had often a sore time of it . His discourses roused immense antagonism , and he was sometimes set upon and severely handled by the men to whom he spoke . I have seen him left for dead twice in the rough monarchical towns . But he worked as the Master had worked before him ; simply changing the methods to be more in harmony with the times ; going on his way calm , unshaken , cheerful , ever ready to face the worst and take what danger might arise without blenching ; of a steadfast heart and a loyal spirit ; looking up to God , living after Christ , and loving the humanity that blackguarded and nearly killed him as his reward . Tears are in my eyes , rough man as I am , when I remember Joshua Davidson , his life and works , and what the world he lived but to better said of him and did to him . I have known swindlers and murderers more gently treated . Of a truth , the age of martyrs has not passed away ; as any one may prove in his own person who will set himself to enlarge the close boroughs of thought , and to rectify the injustice of society . The war broke out between France and Prussia , and at the first the tide of liberal sympathies went with Prussia , as representing opposition to the Empire . But as time went on , sides changed , and moderates backed up Prussia , while the ultra - Tories and the Republicans went with France ; the one hoping to see the Empire restored , the other longing for the establishment of liberty . And Joshua 's sympathies changed with the rest . I ought perhaps to have made more than I have done of his intimacy with certain foreign socialists and reformers . Félix Pyat I have already spoken of . He was one of our warmest friends ; and , to go to a very materialistic part of the subject , his association with us both was of great value , not only for the sake of the man himself , but also for the opportunity he afforded us of learning the French language . When the Commune declared itself on the eighteenth of March , none but those in the centre of advanced political feeling can tell what passionate hopes were awakened in the men who care for liberty and believe in social progress . Comtists , Internationalists , Secularists , Socialists , Republicans , by what name soever the doctrine of liberty and brotherhood may be proclaimed , we all looked over to Paris with an anxiety that was as painful as if we stood watching the struggles of a beloved friend with our own hands bound . There were men whom that time sent mad with hope and fear ; and some that I could name are now lying cold in their graves for sorrow at the failure of the righteous cause . The Commune , successful in Paris , meant the emancipation of the working classes here , and later on the peaceable establishment of the Republic ; which we all believe has to come , whether peaceably established or not . On the nineteenth of March , Joshua resolved to go over to Paris , to help , so far as he could , in the cause of humanity . I never saw him so full of enthusiasm . Every now and then , especially of late , his hope , if not his zeal , had slackened a little before the magnitude of the task he had undertaken at home . Alone as he was , not only unsupported by any influential men whatsoever , but actively supposed by many , he found his work of amelioration very hard , and the results unsatisfactory . But to help in the establishment of an organised liberty like the Commune — that seemed the best thing any man loving his fellow - men could do ; and accordingly , he and I agreed to go over at once . And poor Mary Prinsep was broken hearted . But , sorry as he was to give her sorrow , his duty was too clear before him to let him hesitate ; and , stifling whatever grief of private affection he might leave behind him , he set his face toward Paris ; and after some difficulties and dangers we arrived there , “
37506	37606	36462	36462	You	1371	” as so many before and after us . As this is not a history of the Commune it is not necessary to say much about the leaders . Some he loved like his very brothers ; others , chiefly of the noisier sort , he distrusted as leaders , and would rather have seen subordinate to better - balanced minds . He might not too , have always agreed even with the men he loved . Being men , they were fallible ; but they did honestly for the best , and the abuse hurled at them — a “
37611	37613	36462	36462	You	1371	” a “
37618	38032	37616	37616	brigands	1923	” and the like — was as untrue as it was illogical . There were among the Communist leaders men as noble as ever lived upon earth ; men , whatever their special creed , the most after the pattern of Christ in their faithful endeavour to help the poor and to raise the lowly , to rectify the injustice of conventional distinctions , and to give all men an equal chance of being happy , virtuous , and human . Never had Paris been so free from crime as during the administration of the Commune — never so pure . All the vice which had disgraced the city ever since the congenial Empire had enlisted , was swept clean out of it ; and not the most reckless vilifiers of these latter - day Christ - men could make out a case of peculation , of greed , or of uncleanness among them . Skilled artisans abandoned their lucrative callings for the starvation - pay of a franc and a half a day , and set themselves — not to amass wealth , not to gain power , nor to live in luxury and pleasure — but to plan for the best for their fellow - men , and to sketch out a future glorious alike for France and the whole world . The working man vindicated then his claim to be entrusted trusted with his own self - government ; and one of the brightest pages of modern history , in spite of all its mistakes , is that wherein the artisan government of ' 71 wrote its brief but noble record on the heart of Paris . The most fatal thing of that time , however , was the unconquerable distrust of the people . Long used to tyranny and treachery as they had been , they seemed unable to accept any man as a true patriot , not plotting underhand for his own advantage . They trusted no one — not even their sworn and tested friends . And we can scarcely wonder at it . Twenty years of Louis Napoleon , the military command of Trochu , the history of the past Imperial administration and the present Imperial war , had eaten into their very hearts , and taken all the faith out of them . And the consequence was , that even the men now heading the great liberation movement , the best and most unselfish of the “
38035	38777	38778	38778	I	0	” of history , were suspected by the very city they were sacrificing themselves to save . But Paris was mad — mad with despair , with famine , with shame , disease , excitement . The gaunt frames , the hollow cheeks , the wild eyes that met you at every turn , were eloquent witnesses of the state of men 's minds ; and I shall never forget the mournful impression it all made on me . No one looked sane , save the leaders , and perhaps a few of us more cool - headed Anglo - Saxons . The Poles , who had flocked in to take part in a cause they identified with their own broken nationality , added the fever of their political despair to the fire consuming the vitals of the Parisians ; the Italians poured in their bitter hatred to the priests as oil on flames — emblems to them of tyranny , treachery , ignorance , and persecution they could not be brought to acknowledge even the good that is in them , but were ever their unrelenting enemies ; the republicans of all nations gathered into the struggling city , each with his own specific and his own desires ; everywhere was fierce excitement , and the conflict of hope and fear , high endeavour and deep despair ; while it grew clearer and clearer , as the days passed by , that the cause of the freedom of Paris , and with Paris of Europe — the cause of the rights and better organisation of labour — was lost for the hour , and that hope only was left for the future . The city has overmatched , and liberty was doomed . It was but a question of time ; the Commune had to die , and it resolved to die fighting and unsurrendered . Of all the Communists , Delescluze was the one Joshua loved most , because he esteemed him most ; and this , not forgetting his old loyalty and friendship to Félix Pyat , nor denying reverence and love to many others . But there was something special in Delescluze . His heroic spirit , his martyr 's life , his unbroken courage , his unquenchable faith , and that quiet sadness which seemed like the sadness of a prophet — all that he was , and had been , raised one 's admiration more than any other man among them was able to do ; and Joshua was one of his chosen friends . We were both present at the sitting where he vowed , in answer to a taunt flung like a bomb - shell among the members , not to survive the insurrection . The effect was electrical ; it was like a leaf out of old - world history , telling of a time when patriotism was a passion of which men were not ashamed . And when that noble old man rose so quietly , so solemnly , with no theatrical display or frothy excitement , but calmly registered the vow he afterwards kept with such sublime courage , it was as a torch that lighted every heart and soul there with Pentecostal fire . All knew what his words meant ; and we , who shared his private thoughts and feelings as brothers , knew perhaps more than some others . Ah ! the Society that needs such victims as Delescluze to bolster up its rottenness had better crumble to dust as it stands . IT was early in the evening , and we were walking slowly along the Boulevard Montmartre , when I saw a wayworn woman coming with staggering steps towards us , but at some distance yet . Her dress was torn ; her pale face was turned anxiously to each passer - by , scanning every one with a wild scrutiny , not curious so much as full of yearning ; her fair hair was hanging in disordered masses about her face and neck ; but when I tried to speak , pointing her out to Joshua , something in my throat prevented me . There was no need to speak ; she saw us almost as soon as I had recognised her , and , holding out her hands , as we came up hurriedly , said with a plaintive kind of weary smile , “
38789	39045	38787	38787	Joshua	48	” Then she sank in a heap at his feet , her arms stretched out , and her fair hair trailed in the dust . Poor loving , faithful Mary ! She had travelled for the last days on foot ; and if we men had suffered on our journey , she had suffered ten times more . It seems she had set out almost immediately after us , though she had been more than three weeks longer on the road . She was but an ignorant girl , it must be remembered ; she had not come yet to the point of knowing that obedience was even a higher quality than love , and that love is best shown by obedience . Here she was however , and we took her home to our lodgings in the Rue Blanche ; and the concierge laughed significantly when asked for a room where she might be lodged . It would have been better to have refused her admission altogether , than to have laughed and leered as he did . The blood came into Joshua 's pale face for just a moment ; but there was no likelihood of his failing to do right for fear of its looking like wrong , so he gravely gave Mary his hand , and led her to our apartment . She was full of self - reproach and contrition when she saw the false position in which she had placed him ; but he would not hear a word . “
39057	39061	39062	39062	you	1378	” he said , “
39083	39152	39070	39070	we	1380	” This concierge was a man who , from the first , inspired me with disgust and a vague dread . He was a red - haired , coarse - featured , ruffianly - looking fellow , by name Legros ; now in the time of the Commune a noisy republican ; but one could fancy him under the Empire standing with his greasy cap in hand shouting , “
39156	40498	39070	39070	we	1380	” with the loudest . He was a man who had not , I should say , one single guiding principle of life save selfishness — a frank , cynical , unabashed selfishness — a selfishness that believed in nothing save self ; and to whom amassing miserable little sums of money to be spent in sensuality , was the ultimate of human cleverness and happiness ; a man without faith , honour , justice , or mercy . I do not think I am too hard in my judgment of him ; for he was one of the men who make the theory of the devil very easy to believe . Among the sentiments professed by Legros was that of disbelief in womanly virtue . He laughed at the idea of purity as possible in the friendship of men and women , and of course had his own ideas about Mary ; which it seems he expressed pretty plainly . It was some gross insult , I never heard precisely what , that he offered to the poor girl which brought the whole thing to a conclusion . We had both been out , leaving her at home ; and when we came back we found her in a state of excitement and indignation at something that had happened during our absence . She told Joshua , not me ; and indeed , the first I rightly heard of it was when Joshua came back from downstairs , where he had been into the porter 's lodge , and had thrashed Legros to within an inch of his life . This was the first and only time he had ever raised his hand against any one ; and I was sorry he had not left the job to me . I would have done it as well , and he would have kept his hands clean . Yet for all this , when Legros , who had been wounded by a chance splinter , was in the hospital , Joshua attended to him specially , and mainly kept him alive by his care . No one worked harder in these days of dread and turmoil than Joshua . This was what he had come to do . Among the poor and starving , the wounded and dismayed , there he was , day after day , helping all who needed so far as he could , tender as a woman , faithful and strong as a hero . Or he did the work of the Commune , as he might be ordered ; and they had no more trustworthy official . Never a thought of self came in to weaken or distract him . For several nights at a stretch he did not go to bed , and he seemed to have the strength of half - a - dozen men , and to be kept up by an almost supernatural power . For the famine that was wasting the city was touching him with no tender hand . Day by day he got paler and thinner ; his eyes , always bright and as if they were looking at something farther off than we could see , were sunk and dark and hollow ; his cheeks were drawn and pale , his lips blackening and parched . But he never complained ; he never seemed to think of himself at all ; and if he had been without food for twelve hours or twenty - four , the chances were that he would share his scanty rations with the first passer - by who looked famine - stricken . Mary too was suffering from the want and privation of all kinds with which we were afflicted . We did what we could for her , be sure . If my life could have bought hers or his , I would have laid it down as willingly as I would have given them my bitter crust . But they bore up bravely , both of them ; and she helped too with the sick and wounded . She was let to nurse in the English ambulances , where she was interpreted when necessary ; and even at the worst her face as she went softly about the beds was pleasant for the sick and dying to look at . And here let me say how entirely in these late years all trace of her former condition had passed out of it . Purified by love ; that was it ; so that she looked now as if she might have come out of a convent . This is no fancy of my own . Any one who knew Joshua , and consequently Mary Prinsep whom he had saved , will endorse what I say . Things were looking wild and stormy , and the day of our doom was coming near . The Versaillists were too strong for us , and the hope of European freedom was over for the time ; only for the time ! For so sure as day follows on the night , so surely will the law of human rights follow on the tyrannies and oppressions which have so long ruled the world ; and the faith for which the Commune bled , will be triumphant . But for the present , God help this poor sorrowful world of ours . The Vicaire - Général had gone to Versailles , but he had not returned ; and no answer had been vouchsafed to the offer made , now I think for the third time , to release the Archbishop and the other hostages for the one exchange of Blanqui . How often must the story be told ? And will it ever be acknowledged by those who care only , right or wrong , to fasten the stain of blood - guiltiness on the Commune , that the real murderer of Monseigneur Darboy , and the rest , was M. Thiers ? He knew what would happen , as well as a man knows will happen if he puts a lighted match to a barrel of gunpowder . He knew that the hostages would be sacrificed . Inflamed as Paris was , surrounded by an enemy that treated her like a wild beast , and even shook hands with the common foe for her destruction , her best men spoken of as creatures below humanity , her hour of humiliation and bloody agony at hand — he knew there would be no calm reasoning out of consequences , no quiet acceptance of the result . Men 's blood was up ; and the result was foreseen and played for . It was a heavy stake to pay ; but to discredit the Commune , and attach to it the ineffaceable stain of blood - guiltiness , was worth even an Archbishop and some sixty other lives ! We were at the prison during the time of the execution . It would be impossible to describe distinctly how it all took place . No one has , and no one ever will . The whole thing as confusion . No person knew exactly what was being done , or by whom ; and no one had any recognised authority . The leaders of the Commune were fighting singly at the barricades , and for the time all executive government was at an end . The tumult and excitement at the prison was beyond all power of description . Men went and came ; orders were given and contradicted ; women shrieked , some for blood and some for mercy ; youths shouted ; and through all , and above all , we heard the roar of the cannon , the whistling of the shells , and saw the smoke and flame of Paris rising up against the sky . Joshua , mounted on a gun - barrel , pleaded for the lives of the unfortunate men . “
40510	40514	39070	39070	we	1380	” he said , “
40627	40639	40601	40603	the Commune mune	37	” While he spoke Legros drew his revolver from his belt . “
40646	40650	40601	40603	the Commune mune	37	” he cried . “
40665	40666	40667	40667	Christ	52	” “
40680	40758	40677	40678	the traitor	1392	” shouted one or two of the mob . Sick with dread for the safety of the man I loved best on earth , I sprang forward and covered Joshua 's body with my own ; when a fine - looking man — he was one of us then , but , as he is now in office under Thiers , I will not say who he was — quietly struck the revolver from Legros 's hand . “
40774	40778	40783	40784	a hostage	1399	” he said ; “
40786	40795	40783	40784	a hostage	1399	” Then hurriedly , aside , to Joshua , “
40812	40813	40801	40801	I	0	” “
40829	40833	40822	40823	a God	1706	” cried Joshua . “
40838	40845	40834	40836	Pshaw mon ami	1401	” said our friend , contemptuously . “
40866	40867	40870	40870	you	1393	” “
40889	40903	40908	40908	citoyens	1408	” shouted an excited , half - mad looking man close to us . “
40910	41560	41563	41564	mon Capitaine	1409	” And at the word half - a - dozen men and women , shrieking , and gesticulating , laid hands on us and roughly thrust us out . I thought it fortunate we left with our lives , for indeed , the wild , surging crowd was in no mood for mercy just then ; and a couple of lives , more or less , were of small account at that moment . Howbeit , we were flung out with many a blow and bitter word ; and just as we were going through the gateway a loud yell burst forth , a volley was fired , and we knew that the policy of Versailles had triumphed . A few Parisians — not the Commune — had fallen into the snare prepared for them ; and the blood was shed which was to cover Liberty with shame , until men can hear and learn the truth . The last day came . The guns of our forts were silent ; the men were fighting in the streets , desperate , conquered , but not craven . The Versaillists were pouring in like wolves let loose ; Paris was drenched with blood , and in flames . And then the cry of the pétroleuses went up like the fire that shot against the sky . What mattered it that it was a lie ? It gave the Party of Order another reason , if they had wanted any , to excuse their lust of blood . It was their saturnalia , and they did not stint themselves . The arms , that had served them so ill against the Prussians , served them but too well against their countrymen ; and the short hour of a nation 's hope was at an end in the bloody reprisals of brothers , that exceeded all we have ever heard or read of in a victorious foreign army . I had been separated from my friends for more than twenty - four hours . The house where we had lodged was in flames ; and when I went to seek information at a Communist munist friend 's , De Lancy , I found a group of three by the concierge door — himself , his young wife , and a little daughter not two years old , lying as if asleep , save for the blood that was their bed . They had been bound together and shot . Not one , but hundreds and thousands of such cases stand recorded in the history of that terrible moment , when the victorious Versaillists marched into Paris , and society revenged itself on the men who had dared to dream of redressing its wrongs ; and among the terrible sights that met me , the evidences of brutal , wanton , sickening murder , I had a shuddering dread that I should find Joshua and Mary . I was never so nearly mad as I was that day when I wandered about the bloody - streets of Paris , looking for my friends ; sorrow for the lost cause , horror at the scenes I encountered , and fear for those I loved , all combining to render life in that hour simply torture . At last I caught a glimpse of Mary crossing the street , carrying a wounded child in her arms , and making for the ambulance . I called to her , and hurried after her ; but , weak as I was with excitement and want of food , I could not make my voice reach her . Just then , cap in hand and bowing low , Jacques Legros rushed out of a ruined house and stopped the captain of a troop that came marching down the street . He pointed in a frantic way to Mary . “
41566	41582	41563	41564	mon Capitaine	1409	” he said , weeping and sobbing loudly , as one in the greatest distress ; “
41612	41613	41563	41564	mon Capitaine	1409	” “
41618	41657	41563	41564	mon Capitaine	1409	” said the Captain in an odd , half bitter , half matter - of - fact way . And Mary was seized by a couple of his men , and brought up close to where he stood . “
41665	41673	41563	41564	mon Capitaine	1409	” he said with a brutal laugh . “
41697	41698	41699	41699	I	0	” “
41705	41720	41699	41699	I	0	” said Mary , with her wild eyes searching his in vain for pity . “
41732	41733	41727	41727	I	0	” “
41747	41769	41770	41771	A pétroleuse?—you	1414	” said the Captain , suddenly changing his mocking manner for one of ferocious sternness , and speaking in broken English . “
41778	41779	41780	41780	She	1415	” “
41785	42338	41780	41780	She	1415	” I cried . But as I spoke a blow laid me senseless ; and when I came to myself I found myself lying wounded on the ground , with Mary stretched beside me — shot through the heart . It was then night time ; but soon after I recovered , and just as I was in the first agony of understanding what had happened , Joshua , and the same man who had saved his life at the time of the murder of the hostages in the prison , came up to where we lay , searching for us . I have no more to tell of this episode . Our Mary was buried tenderly , lovingly ; and I laid part of my life in her grave . What Joshua felt I never knew exactly . He did not say much ; and though once I saw him , when he thought I was asleep , lay his head on his hands and weep bitterly , he never gave me a hint as to whether he was grieving at the loss of Mary , or at the failure of the cause . Whichever it was , it nearly broke him down ; and ill as I was myself , with a bad wound and a smashed collar - bone , I saw that his distress was greater than my own , and needed more consideration . I was desperately afraid more than once that he was going to die . For myself , I felt as if I could not die while Joshua lived , perhaps to want me . However that might be , we neither of us came to grief of that kind . I got well in time ; and when I could travel , and a fitting opportunity arrived , our friend , who had kept us all this time in safety , got us sent off to England . And right glad was I when we landed safe in the Old Country once more . Joshua was glad too . He had suffered much from the confinement , inertia , and disappointment of the last few weeks;—coming too , after a time of such intense hope and excitement ; and once in England , he thought he could do something for the Humanity he loved , for the Truth to which he had consecrated his life . WE found times hard on our return . As for work , it was simply impossible to be had where we were known . If Joshua was shunned as a consorter with bad characters when he took vicious humanity by the hand , and sought to cleanse the foul and raise the degraded by the practical application of Christian precepts unsupported by sectarian organisation , what was he now , when besmirched with the Communistic doctrines of liberty , equality , and fraternity ? Ordinary men thinking ordinary thoughts shrank from him in moral horror . He stood before them as the embodiment of murder and rapine , the representative of social destruction and the godless license of anarchy . He was a Communist : and that to most men and women of the day , means one wilfully and willingly guilty of every crime under heaven . “
42348	42356	41780	41780	She	1415	” he said to me one day ; “
42390	42391	42377	42377	I	0	” “
42403	42407	42401	42401	Joshua	48	” I said . “
42468	42753	42754	42754	You	1424	” But that was just what neither he nor any one else has yet got the world to do , and I doubt it will be long before they will . Work at the bench being impossible , being indeed scarcely the thing he wanted at this moment , Joshua took up again the hungry trade of political lecturer to working men , and went about the country explaining the Communistic doctrines , and showing their apostolic origin . His position was this . He did not justify all the actions of all the men at the head of affairs during the short reign of the Commune in Paris ; but he warmly defended the cardinal points of their creed , as the logical outcome of Christianity in politics . The abolition of priestly supremacy macy in a man 's social and daily life ; the rights of labour as equal with those of capital ; the dignity of humanity , including the doctrine of human equality ; fraternal care for the poor , and the obligation laid on the strong to help the weak ; the merely experimental nature of society , whence follows the righteousness of radical changes which shall break down the strongholds of tyranny and injustice , and help on general amelioration ; the iniquity of maintaining the vested rights of wrong ; and the right of the people to self - government . These were the doctrines he preached ; but which he failed to induce the world to accept . They called him — as he called himself — a Communist ; and the name offended , so that they would not listen to any kind of statement . “
42758	42762	42754	42754	You	1424	” said one . “
42769	42773	42763	42763	You	1424	” said another . “
42780	42786	42774	42774	You	1424	” said a third . A fourth—“You
42798	42799	42800	42800	You	1424	” “
42832	42837	42838	42838	You	1424	” said a fifth . “
42855	42863	42838	42838	You	1424	” said a sixth . And when he answered—“You
42955	42972	42947	42947	I	0	God”—as often as not they turned against him , and hounded him out of their towns . “
42982	42990	42947	42947	I	0	” they said , when they were religiously inclined;—“None
42996	43354	42947	42947	I	0	” when they were conservative . But where parties were anything like even enough to get him a handful of sympathizers , there was generally a fight ; and then the magistrates ordered him out of the place , with insult from the bench ; and in many towns they refused him permission to speak at all . The very name of the Commune is the red rag to English thought ; and all reason is lost when it is the question of telling the truth about men who tried to get the working classes equal rights and recognition with the moneyed ones . At last we came to a place called Lowbridge , where a friend of ours lived — a member of the International ; and here Joshua announced himself to give a lecture on Communism , in the Town Hall . His programme stated the usual thing , that he , Joshua Davidson , would show how Christ and his apostles were Communists , and how they preached the same doctrines which the Commune of Paris strove to embody ; allowing for the differences of method inherent to the differences of social arrangements that have grown up during a lapse of nearly two thousand years . The evening came , and Joshua prepared to go to the meeting he had called ; and I along with him . Our friend had warned him to expect an unfriendly audience ; but Joshua was not a man to be daunted by a few stern faces ; and I do not think I ever saw him so possessed with the spirit of what he had set out to teach as he was this evening . Yet also I noticed something in him that was not exactly like himself . Grave as he always was , to - night he was grave to sadness ; a solemn kind of sadness ; like a martyr going to his death , steadfast , testifying always , but — knowing that he was to die . He shook hands with me at the side door cordially before going up , saying , “
43370	43417	43361	43361	you	1437	” then smiled at me ; and , the moment having come , stepped on to the platform . In the first row , right in front of him , was the former clergyman of Trevalga ; him we lads used to call behind his back , “
43421	43664	43418	43419	Mr. Grand	50	” because of his pomposity and haughtiness . He had lately been given the rich living of Lowbridge , and one or two stately appointments connected with the Cathedral and such like . I do not know what they were exactly , but they had made him a man of supreme importance , not only in Lowbridge itself , but in all the neighbourhood round about . I saw Joshua 's face change as he caught the clergyman 's eye . It did not change to cowardice , but to a kind of eager look , like a man taking hold of an enemy ; and then it passed away into his usual abstracted unconsciousness of self , as he came quietly to the front and prepared to speak . But at the first word there broke out such a tumult as I had never heard in any public meeting , and I have been at a few rough and rowdy ones too . The yells , hisses , catcalls , whoopings were indescribable . It was impossible to be heard . I believe the roar of a lion would have been overpowered . Joshua stood there quiet and dignified as ever , looking straight in among them , waiting for the tumult to cease . It only ceased when Mr. Grand rose , and standing up on the chair on which he had been sitting , waved his hand for silence . “
43667	43671	43665	43665	Friends	1621	” he said , “
43710	43715	43704	43704	I	0	” pointing to Joshua ; “
44022	44155	43991	43991	him	1274	” Then he got down , and the men cheered him as lustily as they had hissed Joshua . I will do Mr. Grand the justice to say that I do not think he intended his words should have the effect they did have . Gentlefolks do not often incite to riot ; and a clergyman does not like to be the wirepuller for a murder der . But , maddened by their own misconceptions to begin with , and excited still more by their parson 's abuse and encouragement to violence as it were , the audience lost all self - control . A dozen men leaped on the platform , and in a moment I saw Joshua under their feet . It was in vain then for Mr. Grand to cry “
