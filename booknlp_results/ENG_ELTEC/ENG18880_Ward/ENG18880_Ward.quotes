960	1615	958	959	the farmers	919	' wives of Long Whindale loved to fill their little front enclosures , was trimly laid down in turf dotted with neat flower - beds , full at the moment we are writing of with orderly patches of scarlet and purple anemones , wallflowers , and pansies . At the side of the house a new bow window , modest enough in dimensions and make , had been thrown out on to another close - shaven piece of lawn , and by its suggestion of a distant sophisticated order of things disturbed the homely impression left by the untouched ivy - grown walls , the unpretending porch , and wide slate window - sills of the front . And evidently the line of sheds standing level with the dwelling - house no longer sheltered the animals , the carts , or the tools which make the small capital of a Westmoreland farmer . The windows in them were new , the doors fresh painted and closely shut ; curtains of some soft outlandish make showed themselves in what had once been a stable , and the turf stretched smoothly up to a narrow gravelled path in front of them , unbroken by a single footmark . No , evidently the old farm , for such it undoubtedly was , had been but lately , or comparatively lately , transformed to new and softer uses ; that rough patriarchal life of which it had once been a symbol and centre no longer bustled and clattered through it . It had become the shelter of new ideals , the home of another and a milder race than once possessed it . In a stranger coming upon the house for the first time , on this particular evening , the sense of a changing social order and a vanishing past produced by the slight but significant modifications it had undergone , would have been greatly quickened by certain sounds which were streaming out on to the evening air from one of the divisions of that long one - storied addition to the main dwelling we have already described . Some indefatigable musician inside was practising the violin with surprising energy and vigour , and within the little garden the distant murmur of the river and the gentle breathing of the west wind round the fell were entirely conquered and banished by these triumphant shakes and turns , or by the flourishes and the broad cantabile passages of one of Spohr 's Andantes . For a while , as the sun sank lower and lower towards the Shanmoor hills , the hidden artist had it all his , or her , own way ; the valley and its green spaces seemed to be possessed by this stream of eddying sound , and no other sign of life broke the gray quiet of the house . But at last , just as the golden ball touched the summit of the craggy fell , which makes the western boundary of the dale at its higher end , the house door opened , and a young girl , shawled and holding some soft burden in her arms , appeared on the threshold , and stood there for a moment , as though trying the quality of the air outside . Her pause of inspection seemed to satisfy her , for she moved forward , leaving the door open behind her , and , stepping across the lawn , settled herself in a wicker chair under an apple - tree , which had only just shed its blossoms on the turf below . She had hardly done so when one of the distant doors opening on the gravel path flew open , and another maiden , a slim creature garbed in æsthetic blue , a mass of reddish brown hair flying back from her face , also stepped out into the garden . '
1618	1643	958	959	the farmers	919	' cried the new - comer , who had the strenuous and dishevelled air natural to one just emerged from a long violin practice . '
1650	1650	958	959	the farmers	919	'
1651	1674	958	959	the farmers	919	' Not that I know of . Do come here and look at pussie ; did you ever see anything so comfortable ? '
1675	1693	958	959	the farmers	919	' You and she look about equally lazy . What have you been doing all the afternoon ? '
1694	1839	1840	1841	The speaker	920	' We look what we are , my dear . Doing ? Why , I have been attending to my domestic duties , arranging the flowers , mending my pink dress for to - morrow night , and helping to keep mamma in good spirits ; she is depressed because she has been finding Elizabeth out in some waste or other , and I have been preaching to her to make Elizabeth uncomfortable if she likes , but not to worrit herself . And after all , pussie and I have come out for a rest . We 've earned it , have n't we , Chattie ? And , as for you , Miss Artistic , I should like to know what you 've been doing for the good of your kind since dinner . I suppose you had tea at the vicarage ? '
2079	2089	2091	2093	this young person	929	' Yes , I had tea at the vicarage , '
2119	2207	2107	2107	Agnes	306	' and I had the greatest difficulty to get away . Mrs. Thornburgh is in such a flutter about this visit ! One would think it was the Bishop and all his Canons , and promotion depending on it , she has baked so many cakes and put out so many dinner napkins ! I do n't envy the young man . She will have no wits left at all to entertain him with . I actually wound up by administering some sal - volatile to her . '
2208	2233	2243	2243	her	930	' Well , and after the sal - volatile did you get anything coherent out of her on the subject of the young man ? '
2234	2238	2240	2241	the girl	930	' By degrees , '
2247	2394	2243	2243	her	930	' if one can only remember the thread between whiles one gets at the facts somehow . In between the death of Mr. Elsmere 's father and his going to college , we had , let me see,—the spare room curtains , the making of them and the cleaning of them , Sarah 's idiocy in sticking to her black sheep of a young man , the price of tea when she married , Mr. Thornburgh 's singular preference of boiled mutton to roast , the poems she had written to her when she was eighteen , and I ca n't tell you what else besides . But I held fast , and every now and then I brought her up to the point again , gently , but firmly , and now I think I know all I want to know about the interesting stranger . '
2395	2404	2406	2406	Agnes	306	' My ideas about him are not many , '
2419	2480	2406	2406	Agnes	306	' and there does n't seem to be much order in them . He is very accomplished — a teetotaller — he has been to the Holy Land , and his hair has been cut close after a fever . It sounds odd , but I am not curious . I can very well wait till to - morrow evening . '
2481	2567	2243	2243	her	930	' Oh , well , as to ideas about a person , one does n't get that sort of thing from Mrs. Thornburgh . But I know how old he is , where he went to college , where his mother lives , a certain number of his mother 's peculiarities , which seem to be Irish and curious , where his living is , how much it is worth , likewise the colour of his eyes , as near as Mrs. Thornburgh can get . '
2568	2577	2579	2579	Agnes	306	' What a start you have been getting ! '
2582	2595	2579	2579	Agnes	306	' But what is it makes the poor old thing so excited ? '
2629	2667	2596	2596	Rose	369	' Because , my dear , Mrs. Thornburgh at the present moment is always seeing herself as the conspirator sitting match in hand before a mine . Mr. Elsmere is the match — we are the mine ! '
2708	2711	2713	2713	Rose	369	' Well , '
2728	2756	2716	2716	her	369	' there is no saying . " Propinquity does it"—as Mrs. Thornburgh is always reminding us.—But where can Catherine be ? She went out directly after lunch . '
2757	2799	2800	2800	Rose	369	' She has gone out to see that youth who hurt his back at the Tysons — at least I heard her talking to mamma about him , and she went out with a basket that looked like beef - tea . '
2805	2874	2800	2800	Rose	369	' And I suppose I ought to have been to the school or to see Mrs. Robson , instead of fiddling all the afternoon . I daresay I ought — only , unfortunately , I like my fiddle , and I do n't like stuffy cottages ; and as for the goody books , I read them so badly that the old women themselves come down upon me . '
2875	2888	2890	2890	Agnes	306	' I seem to have been making the best of both worlds , '
2893	2958	2890	2890	Agnes	306	' I have n't been doing anything I do n't like , but I got hold of that dress she brought home to make for little Emma Payne and nearly finished the skirt , so that I feel as good as one when one has been twice to church on a wet Sunday . Ah , there is Catherine . I heard the gate . '
3007	3064	2985	2998	a tall figure in white and gray appeared against the background of the sycamores	934	' Dears , I am so sorry ; I am afraid you have been waiting for me . But poor Mrs. Tyson wanted me so badly that I could not leave her . She had no one else to help her or to be with her till that eldest girl of hers came home from work . '
3065	3071	3073	3073	Rose	369	' It does n't matter , '
3084	3107	3076	3076	Catherine	358	' mamma has n't been fidgeting , and as for Agnes , she looks as if she never wanted to move again . '
3538	3546	3607	3607	her	369	' So the poor fellow is worse ? '
3547	3588	3589	3590	Both girls	954	' Yes . Doctor Baker , whom they have got to - day , says the spine is hopelessly injured . He may live on paralysed for a few months or longer , but there is no hope of cure . '
3596	3603	3605	3605	Rose	369	' That fine strong young man ! '
3610	3615	3605	3605	Rose	369	' Does he know ? '
3616	3687	3589	3590	Both girls	954	' Yes ; when I got there the doctor had just gone , and Mrs. Tyson , who was quite unprepared for anything so dreadful , seemed to have almost lost her wits , poor thing ! I found her in the front kitchen with her apron over her head , rocking to and fro , and poor Arthur in the inner room — all alone — waiting in suspense . '
3688	3700	3605	3605	Rose	369	' And who told him ? He has been so hopeful . '
3701	3705	3707	3707	Catherine	358	' I did , '
3710	3737	3707	3707	Catherine	358	' they made me . He would know , and she couldn't — she ran out of the room . I never saw anything so pitiful . '
3738	3743	3745	3745	Rose	369	' Oh , Catherine ! '
3766	3773	3756	3756	Chattie	310	' How did he bear it ? '
3774	3780	3782	3782	Catherine	358	' Do n't ask me , '
3805	3874	3875	3875	she	358	' It was terrible ! I do n't know how we got through that half - hour — his mother and I. It was like wrestling with some one in agony . At last he was exhausted — he let me say the Lord 's Prayer ; I think it soothed him , but one could n't tell . He seemed half asleep when I left . Oh ! '
3890	3937	3875	3875	she	358	' if you had seen his eyes , and his poor hands — there was such despair in them ! They say , though he was so young , he was thinking of getting married ; and he was so steady , such a good son ! '
4066	4108	4110	4110	she	358	' Dears , we must go in . Is mother in her room ? Oh , Rose ! in that thin dress on the grass ; I ought n't to have kept you out . It is quite cold by now . '
4477	4983	4998	4998	she	974	' father , a long serious face , not unlike Wordsworth 's face in outline , and bearing a strong resemblance to Catherine ; a line of silhouettes adorned the mantelpiece ; on the walls were prints of Winchester and Worcester Cathedrals , photographs of Greece , and two old - fashioned engravings of Dante and Milton ; while a bookcase , filled apparently with the father 's college books and college prizes and the favourite authors — mostly poets , philosophers , and theologians — of his later years , gave a final touch of habitableness to the room . The little meal and its appointments — the eggs , the home - made bread and preserves , the tempting butter and old - fashioned silver gleaming among the flowers which Rose arranged with fanciful skill in Japanese pots of her own providing — suggested the same family qualities as the room . Frugality , a dainty personal self - respect , a family consciousness , tenacious of its memories and tenderly careful of all the little material objects which were to it the symbols of those memories — clearly all these elements entered into the Leyburn tradition . And of this tradition , with its implied assertions and denials , clearly Catherine Leyburn , the elder sister , was , of all the persons gathered in this little room , the most pronounced embodiment . She sat at the head of the table , the little basket of her own and her mother 's keys beside her . Her dress was a soft black brocade , with lace collar and cuff , which had once belonged to an aunt of her mother 's . It was too old for her both in fashion and material , but it gave her a gentle , almost matronly dignity , which became her . Her long thin hands , full of character and delicacy , moved nimbly among the cups ; all her ways were quiet and yet decided . It was evident that among this little party she , and not the plaintive mother , was really in authority . To - night , however , her looks were specially soft . The scene she had gone through in the afternoon had left her pale , with traces of patient fatigue round the eyes and mouth , but all her emotion was gone , and she was devoting herself to the others , responding with quick interest and ready smiles to all they had to say , and contributing the little experiences of her own day in return . Rose sat on her left hand in yet another gown of strange tint and archaic outline . Rose 's gowns were legion . They were manufactured by a farmer 's daughter across the valley , under her strict and precise supervision . She was accustomed , as she boldly avowed , to shut herself up at the beginning of each season of the year for two days '
5037	5044	5045	5045	she	974	' What , another , Röschen ? '
5057	5076	5045	5045	she	974	' You never confided that to me . Did you think I was unworthy of anything so artistic ? '
5077	5082	5084	5084	Rose	369	' Not at all , '
5090	5098	5084	5084	Rose	369	' I thought you were better employed . '
5130	5143	5144	5144	Catherine	358	' I met Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Elsmere driving from the station , '
5148	5174	5144	5144	Catherine	358	' at least there was a gentleman in a clerical wideawake , with a portmanteau behind , so I imagine it must have been he . '
5175	5181	5183	5183	Agnes	306	' Did he look promising ? '
5185	5193	5195	5195	Catherine	358	' I do n't think I noticed , '
5222	5226	5211	5211	she	358	' lifted up , '
5240	5260	5262	5262	Rose	369	' Well , it is to be hoped the young man is recovered enough to stand Long Whindale festivities , '
5264	5281	5262	5262	Rose	369	' Mrs. Thornburgh means to let them loose on his devoted head to - morrow night . '
5282	5287	5289	5290	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Who are coming ? '
5441	5452	5454	5454	Agnes	306	' Mamma asks as if really she wanted an answer , '
5457	5479	5454	5454	Agnes	306	' Dear mother , ca n't you by now make up a tea party at the Thornburghs out of your head ? '
5480	5484	5486	5487	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' The Seatons ? '
5489	5496	5498	5498	Rose	369	' Mrs. Seaton and Miss Barks , '
5500	5567	5498	5498	Rose	369	' The rector wo n't come . And I need n't say that , having moved heaven and earth to get Mrs. Seaton , Mrs. Thornburgh is now miserable because she has got her . Her ambition is gratified , but she knows that she has spoilt the party . Well , then , Mr. Mayhew , of course , his son , and his flute . '
5568	5575	5578	5578	Agnes	306	' You to play his accompaniments ? '
5586	5594	5595	5595	she	369	' Not if Miss Barks knows it , '
5599	5618	5595	5595	she	369	' nor if I know it . The Bakers , of course , ourselves , and the unknown . '
5619	5626	5628	5629	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Dr. Baker is always pleasant , '
5642	5699	5628	5629	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' He told me the other day , Catherine , that if it were n't for you he should have to retire . He regards you as his junior partner . " Marvellous nursing gift your eldest daughter has , Mrs. Leyburn , " he said to me the other day . A most agreeable man . '
5700	5724	5726	5726	Rose	369	' I wonder if I shall be able to get any candid opinions out of Mr. Elsmere the day after to - morrow ? '
5730	5746	5726	5726	Rose	369	' It is difficult to avoid having an opinion of some sort about Mrs. Seaton . '
5747	5758	5760	5760	Agnes	306	' Oxford dons do n't gossip and are never candid , '
5763	5772	5774	5774	Rose	369	' Then Oxford dons must be very dull , '
5776	5779	5774	5774	Rose	369	' However , '
5785	5797	5798	5798	Catherine	358	' if he stays here four weeks we can teach him . '
5832	5843	5798	5798	Catherine	358	' I wonder what the young man will be like ? '
5844	5851	5853	5853	Rose	369	' Oh , by the way , '
5856	5985	5853	5853	Rose	369	' I had nearly forgotten Mrs. Thornburgh 's two messages . I informed her , Agnes , that you had given up water - colour and meant to try oils , and she told me to implore you not to , because " water - colour is so much more lady - like than oils . " And as for you , Catherine , she sent you a most special message . I was to tell you that she just loved the way you had taken to plaiting your hair lately — that it was exactly like the picture of Jeanie Deans she has in the drawing - room , and that she would never forgive you if you did n't plait it so to - morrow night . '
5997	6005	6006	6006	she	358	' Mrs. Thornburgh has eagle - eyes , '
6036	6039	6041	6041	Agnes	306	' Rose ! '
6051	6076	6041	6041	Agnes	306	' you and Mrs. Thornburgh have not the sense you were born with . What on earth did you say that to Catherine for ? '
6087	6094	6095	6095	she	369	' I suppose it was foolish , '
6119	6125	6126	6126	she	369	' You know , Agnes , '
6133	6146	6126	6126	she	369	' there are drawbacks to having a St. Elizabeth for a sister . '
6183	6188	6189	6189	she	369	' A little life ! '
6195	6200	6189	6189	she	369	' a little wickedness ! '
6321	6332	6333	6333	she	369	' Any news for me from the Backhouses this afternoon ? '
6337	6349	6333	6333	she	369	' No , I heard of none . How is she ? '
6350	6353	6355	6355	Catherine	358	' Dying , '
6480	6493	6469	6469	Catherine	358	' What did you do with yourself all the afternoon , Röschen ? '
6494	6501	6503	6504	the girl	930	' I practised for two hours , '
6507	6520	6503	6504	the girl	930	' and two hours this morning . My Spohr is nearly perfect . '
6521	6531	6533	6533	Catherine	358	' And you did n't look into the school ? '
6537	6545	6533	6533	Catherine	358	' I know Miss Merry expected you . '
6546	6582	6583	6583	Catherine	358	' No , I did n't . When one can play the violin and ca n't teach , any more than a cockatoo , what 's the good of wasting one 's time in teaching ? '
6664	6677	6679	6679	Rose	369	' Why could n't she take as much interest in my Spohr ? '
7263	7278	7280	7280	Catherine	358	' It is more comfortable , dear mother , and takes much less time , '
7284	7289	7291	7291	Agnes	306	' Poor Mrs. Thornburgh ! '
7294	7302	7304	7304	Catherine	358	' Oh , Rose will make up ! '
7325	7337	7304	7304	Catherine	358	' and mamma 's new cap , which will be superb ! '
7364	7368	7369	7370	that lady	1017	' high tea , '
7556	7558	7526	7527	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' tea '
7616	7620	7634	7634	she	1028	' bubble reputation , '
7711	7713	7690	7721	a cook whose recipes were hopelessly old - fashioned , and who had an exasperating belief in the sufficiency of buttered ' whigs ' and home - made marmalade for all requirements	1033	' whigs '
7839	7885	7918	7918	William	342	' wives without flinching . Not , indeed , in all respects a woman at peace with herself and the world . In the country , where every household should be self - contained , a certain discredit attaches in every well - regulated mind to '
7890	7917	7918	7918	William	342	' Mrs. Thornburgh was also nervous at the thought of the bill . It would have to be met gradually out of the weekly money . For '
7919	8275	7918	7918	William	342	' was to know nothing of the matter , except so far as a few magnificent generalities and the testimony of his own dazzled eyes might inform him . But after all , in this as in everything else , one must suffer to be distinguished . The carrier , however , lingered . And at last the drowsiness of the afternoon overcame even those pleasing expectations we have described , and Mrs. Thornburgh 's newspaper dropped unheeded to her feet . The vicarage , under the shade of which she was sitting , was a new gray stone building with wooden gables , occupying the site of what had once been the earlier vicarage house of Long Whindale , the primitive dwelling - house of an incumbent , whose chapelry , after sundry augmentations , amounted to just twenty - seven pounds a year . The modern house , though it only contained sufficient accommodation for Mr. and Mrs. Thornburgh , one guest , and two maids , would have seemed palatial to those rustic clerics of the past from whose ministrations the lonely valley had drawn its spiritual sustenance in times gone by . They , indeed , had belonged to another race — a race sprung from the soil and content to spend the whole of life in very close contact and very homely intercourse with their mother earth . Mr. Thornburgh , who had come to the valley only a few years before from a parish in one of the large manufacturing towns , and who had no inherited interest in the Cumbrian folk and their ways , had only a very faint idea , and that a distinctly depreciatory one , of what these mythical predecessors of his , with their strange social status and unbecoming occupations , might be like . But there were one or two old men still lingering in the dale who could have told him a great deal about them , whose memory went back to the days when the relative social importance of the dale parsons was exactly expressed by the characteristic Westmoreland saying : '
8287	8290	7918	7918	William	342	' moderate parson '
8294	8332	8281	8283	a gude schulemeaster	1041	' and whose slow minds , therefore , were filled with a strong inarticulate sense of difference as they saw him pass along the road , and recalled the incumbent of their childhood , dropping in for his '
8334	8339	7918	7918	William	342	' and his glass of '
8341	8698	8281	8283	a gude schulemeaster	1041	' at this or that farmhouse on any occasion of local festivity , or driving his sheep to Whinborough market with his own hands like any other peasant of the dale . Within the last twenty years , however , the few remaining survivors of this primitive clerical order in the Westmoreland and Cumberland valleys have dropped into their quiet unremembered graves , and new men of other ways and other modes of speech reign in their stead . And as at Long Whindale , so almost everywhere , the change has been emphasised by the disappearance of the old parsonage houses with their stone floors , their parlours lustrous with oak carving on chest or dresser , and their encircling farm - buildings and meadows , in favour of an upgrowth of new trim mansions designed to meet the needs , not of peasants , but of gentlefolks . And naturally the churches too have shared in the process of transformation . The ecclesiastical revival of the last half - century has worked its will even in the remotest corners of the Cumbrian country , and soon not a vestige of the homely worshipping - places of an earlier day will remain . Across the road , in front of the Long Whindale parsonage , for instance , rose a freshly built church , also peaked and gabled , with a spire and two bells , and a painted east window , and Heaven knows what novelties besides . The primitive whitewashed structure it replaced had lasted long , and in the course of many generations time had clothed its moss - grown walls , its slated porch , and tombstones worn with rain in a certain beauty of congruity and association , linking it with the purple distances of the fells , and the brawling river bending round the gray enclosure . But finally , after a period of quiet and gradual decay , the ruin of Long Whindale chapel had become a quick and hurrying ruin that would not be arrested . When the rotten timbers of the roof came dropping on the farmers '
8768	8770	9397	9398	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' summat '
8777	8819	9397	9398	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' And by the help of the Bishop , and Queen Anne 's Bounty , and what not , aided by just as many half - crowns as the valley found itself unable to defend against the encroachments of a new and '
8821	8824	9356	9356	he	349	' parson , '
8826	9330	9331	9331	Missis	347	' was done , whereof the results — namely , the new church , vicarage , and schoolhouse — were now conspicuous . This radical change , however , had not been the work of Mr. Thornburgh but of his predecessor , a much more pushing and enterprising man , whose successful efforts to improve the church accommodation in Long Whindale had moved such deep and lasting astonishment in the mind of a somewhat lethargic bishop , that promotion had been readily found for him . Mr. Thornburgh was neither capable of the sturdy begging which had raised the church , nor was he likely on other lines to reach preferment . He and his wife , who possessed much more salience of character than he , were accepted in the dale as belonging to the established order of things . Nobody wished them any harm , and the few people they had specially befriended , naturally , thought well of them . But the old intimacy of relation which had once subsisted between the clergyman of Long Whindale and his parishioners was wholly gone . They had sunk in the scale ; the parson had risen . The old statesmen or peasant proprietors of the valley had for the most part succumbed to various destructive influences , some social , some economical , added to a certain amount of corrosion from within ; and their place had been taken by leaseholders , less drunken perhaps , and better educated , but also far less shrewd and individual , and lacking in the rude dignity of their predecessors . And as the land had lost , the church had gained . The place of the dalesmen knew them no more , but the church and parsonage had got themselves rebuilt , the parson had had his income raised , had let off his glebe to a neighbouring farmer , kept two maids , and drank claret when he drank anything . His flock were friendly enough , and paid their commuted tithes without grumbling . But between them and a perfectly well - meaning but rather dull man , who stood on his dignity and wore a black coat all the week , there was no real community . Rejoice in it as we may , in this final passage of Parson Primrose to social regions beyond the ken of Farmer Flamborough , there are some elements of loss as there are in all changes . Wheels on the road ! Mrs. Thornburgh woke up with a start , and stumbling over newspaper and couvre - pied , hurried across the lawn as fast as her short squat figure would allow , gray curls and cap - strings flying behind her . She heard a colloquy in the distance in broad Westmoreland dialect , and as she turned the corner of the house she nearly ran into her tall cook , Sarah , whose impassive and saturnine countenance bore traces of unusual excitement .

9610	9661	9662	9662	Jim	350	' And Mr. Backhouse pointed with withering scorn to a small , shrunken old man , who sat dangling his legs on the shaft of the cart , and whose countenance wore a singular expression of mingled meekness and composure , as his partner flourished an indignant finger towards him . '
9664	9670	9662	9662	Jim	350	' cried Mrs. Thornburgh reproachfully , '

As for John , he looked on surveying his brother 's philosophical demeanour at first with speechless wrath , and then with an inscrutable mixture of expressions , in which , however , any one accustomed to his weather - beaten countenance would have probably read a hidden admiration .

10395	10456	10393	10393	John	351	' The old man 's face peering round the oilcloth hood of the cart was darkened by a sudden cloud as he caught the words . His stern lips closed . He muttered something inaudible to Mrs. Thornburgh and whipped up his horse again . The cart started off , and Mrs. Thornburgh was left staring into the receding eyes of '
10461	10487	10457	10459	Jim the Noodle	350	' who , from his seat on the near shaft , regarded her with a gaze which had passed from benevolence into a preternatural solemnity . '

10857	10978	10855	10856	the Leyburns	324	' house , peeping above the trees to the left . At sight of them a smile overspread her plump and gently wrinkled face . She fell gradually into a train of thought , as feminine as that in which she had been just indulging , but infinitely more pleasing . For , with regard to the Leyburns , at this present moment Mrs. Thornburgh felt herself in the great position of tutelary divinity or guardian angel . At least if divinities and guardian angels do not concern themselves with the questions to which Mrs. Thornburgh 's mind was now addressed , it would clearly have been the opinion of the vicar 's wife that they ought to do so . '
10995	11002	10989	10989	I	0	' Mrs. Thornburgh inquired of herself , '
11156	11186	11152	11152	we	1096	' And Mrs. Thornburgh gently shook her gray curls from side to side , while her eyes , fixed on the open spare room window , shone with meaning . '
11204	11215	11152	11152	we	1096	' She sat lost a moment in a pleasing dream . '
11228	11238	11239	11239	Master	1098	' called Sarah gruffly , from the garden door . '
11246	11249	11239	11239	Master	1098	' down t '
11253	11258	11259	11260	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' stepping - stones . '
11381	11385	11387	11388	Mr. Thornburgh	315	' Welcome sight ! '
11390	11419	11387	11388	Mr. Thornburgh	315	' Robert and I have been coveting that tea for the last hour . You guessed very well , Emma , to have it just ready for us . '
11420	11438	11440	11441	his wife	8564	' Oh , that was Sarah . She saw you coming down to the stepping - stones , '
11459	11473	11440	11441	his wife	8564	' Robert , I hope you have n't been walked off your legs ? '
11474	11508	11510	11510	he	315	' What , in this air , cousin Emma ? I could walk from sunrise to sundown . Let no one call me an invalid any more . Henceforth I am a Hercules . '
11621	11622	11623	11623	I	0	' '
11636	11654	11629	11630	cousin Emma	319	' said the young man , surprising her glance , and despairingly smoothing down his recalcitrant locks . '
11681	11814	11679	11679	Murewell	358	' He looked up at her with a merry flash in his gray eyes , and her old face brightened visibly as she realised afresh that in spite of the grotesqueness of his cropped hair , her guest was a most attractive creature . Not that he could boast much in the way of regular good looks : the mouth was large , the nose of no particular outline , and in general the cutting of the face , though strong and characteristic , had a bluntness and naïveté like a vigorous unfinished sketch . This bluntness of line , however , was balanced by a great delicacy of tint — the pink and white complexion of a girl , indeed — enhanced by the bright reddish hair , and quick gray eyes .
12081	12406	12076	12077	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' If you will set your mind , my dear , on things we plain folks can do perfectly well without'—et cetera , et cetera — the husband 's point of view can be imagined . Mrs. Thornburgh could have shaken her good man , especially as there was nothing new to her in his remarks ; she had known to a T beforehand exactly what he would say . She took up her knitting in a great hurry , the needles clicking angrily , her gray curls quivering under the energy of her hands and arms , while she launched at her husband various retorts as to his lack of consideration for her efforts and her inconvenience , which were only very slightly modified by the presence of a stranger . Robert Elsmere meanwhile lay on the grass , his face discreetly turned away , an uncontrollable smile twitching the corners of his mouth . Everything was fresh and piquant up here in this remote corner of the north country , whether the mountain air or the wind - blown streams , or the manners and customs of the inhabitants . His cousin 's wife , in spite of her ambitious conventionalities , was really the child of Nature to a refreshing degree . One does not see these types , he said to himself , in the cultivated monotony of Oxford or London . She was like a bit of a bygone world — Miss Austen 's or Miss Ferrier's — unearthed for his amusement . He could not for the life of him help taking the scenes of this remote rural existence , which was quite new to him , as though they were the scenes of some comedy of manners . Presently , however , the vicar became aware that the passage of arms between himself and his spouse was becoming just a little indecorous . He got up with a '
12409	12423	12076	12077	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' intended to put an end to it , and deposited his cup . '
12460	12516	12449	12449	you	8398	' With this final shaft he departed to see that Jane , the little maid whom Sarah ordered about , had not , in cleaning the study for the evening 's festivities , put his last sermon into the waste - paper basket . His wife looked after him with eyes that spoke unutterable things . '
12522	12533	12517	12517	You	1123	' she said in an agitated voice to young Elsmere , '
12584	12696	12698	12699	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' And she fell back on her knitting with redoubled energy , her face full of a half - tearful intensity of meaning . Robert Elsmere restrained a strong inclination to laugh , and set himself instead to distract and console her . He expressed sympathy with her difficulties , he talked to her about her party , he got from her the names and histories of the guests . How Miss Austenish it sounded : the managing rector 's wife , her still more managing old maid of a sister , the neighbouring clergyman who played the flute , the local doctor , and a pretty daughter just out—'Very pretty , '
12708	12755	12698	12699	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' but all flounces and frills and nothing to say'—and last of all , those three sisters , the Leyburns , who seemed to be on a different level , and whom he had heard mentioned so often since his arrival by both husband and wife . '
12763	12768	12759	12761	the Miss Leyburns	324	' he said presently . '
12787	12788	12783	12783	they	1128	' '
12794	12824	12783	12783	they	1128	' cried Mrs. Thornburgh , brightening at last , and like a great general , leaving one scheme in ruins , only the more ardently to take up another . '
12830	12876	12877	12878	A saint	1130	' and she pointed out Burwood among its trees . Then with her eye eagerly fixed upon him , she fell into a more or less incoherent account of her favourites . She laid on her colours thickly , and Elsmere at once assumed extravagance . '
12893	12899	12877	12878	A saint	1130	' he said , laughing . '
12943	12944	12994	12994	They	1134	' '
12952	12959	12994	12994	They	1134	' said Mrs. Thornburgh , sighing , '
12995	13000	12994	12994	They	1134	're real Westmoreland people . '
13001	13008	12994	12994	They	1134	' What does that mean exactly ? '
13009	13039	12994	12994	They	1134	' Oh , their grandfather was a farmer , just like one of the common farmers about . Only his land was his own , and theirs is n't . '
13040	13051	12994	12994	They	1134	' He was one of the last of the statesmen , '
13125	13171	13179	13184	a typical north - country peasant	1147	' Robert looked inquiry , and the vicar , sitting down — having first picked up his wife 's ball of wool as a peace - offering , which was loftily accepted — launched into a narrative which may be here somewhat condensed . The Leyburns '
13237	13243	13245	13246	the vicar	1019	' The people about here , '
13248	13274	13245	13246	the vicar	1019	' say he drank away an acre a year . He had some fifty acres , and it took about thirty years to beggar him . '
13422	13428	13387	13387	she	8564	' hop out of kin , '
13452	13456	13439	13441	the second son	1170	' book - larnin '
13458	13616	13439	13441	the second son	1170	' and such a persistent idiocy in all matters pertaining to the land , that nothing was left to the father at last but to send him with many oaths to the grammar school at Whinborough . From the moment the boy got a footing in the school he hardly cost his father another penny . He got a local bursary which paid his school expenses , he never missed a remove or failed to gain a prize , and finally won a close scholarship which carried him triumphantly to Queen 's College . His family watched his progress with a gaping , half - contemptuous amazement , till he announced himself as safely installed at Oxford , having borrowed from a Whinborough patron the modest sum necessary to pay his college valuation — a sum which wild horses could not have dragged out of his father , now sunk over head and ears in debt and drink .
13715	13717	13757	13763	a hard , limited , incurious set	1181	' Dick '
13776	13785	13787	13788	Mr. Thornburgh	315	' Then came the old man 's death , '
13790	13909	13911	13912	the vicar	1019	' It happened the year after I took the living . Richard Leyburn was sent for and came . I never saw such a scene in my life as the funeral supper . It was kept up in the old style . Three of Leyburn 's sons were there : two of them farmers like himself , one a clerk from Manchester , a daughter married to a tradesman in Whinborough , a brother of the old man , who was under the table before supper was half over , and so on . Richard Leyburn wrote to ask me to come , and I went to support his cloth . But I was new to the place , '
13918	14008	13911	13912	the vicar	1019	' and they belonged to a race that had never been used to pay much respect to parsons . To see that man among the rest ! He was thin and dignified ; he looked to me as if he had all the learning imaginable , and he had large , absent - looking eyes , which , as George , the eldest brother , said , gave you the impression of some one that " had lost somethin' when he was nobbut a lad , and had gone seekin '
14181	14182	14171	14171	I	0	' '
14188	14196	14171	14171	I	0	' said Robert , opening his eyes , '

14220	14234	14212	14212	I	0	' said the vicar , whose analysis of character never went very far . '
14386	14387	14393	14393	they	1208	' '
14398	14416	14393	14393	they	1208	' interrupted Mrs. Thornburgh . She disliked a long story as she disliked being read aloud to . '
14486	14487	14476	14476	he	342	' '
14493	14499	14476	14476	he	342	' said the vicar meditatively , '

14603	14607	14571	14571	their	1219	' said Elsmere . '
14620	14621	14624	14624	he	364	' '
14682	14689	14671	14671	she	1224	' said the vicar , smiling . '
14804	14831	14832	14832	You	0	' The quiet , commonplace clergyman spoke with a sudden tremor of feeling . His wife , however , looked at him with a dissatisfied expression . '
14836	14840	14832	14832	You	0	' she said , '
14866	14867	14859	14859	Catherine	358	' '
14877	15444	14859	14859	Catherine	358	' said the vicar , but in a different tone . Robert sat ruminating . Presently his host and hostess went in , and the young man went sauntering up the climbing garden - path to the point where only a railing divided it from the fell - side . From here his eye commanded the whole of the upper end of the valley — a bare , desolate recess filled with evening shadow , and walled round by masses of gray and purple crag , except in one spot , where a green intervening fell marked the course of the pass connecting the dale with the Ullswater district . Below him were church and parsonage ; beyond , the stone - filled babbling river , edged by intensely green fields , which melted imperceptibly into the browner stretches of the opposite mountain . Most of the scene , except where the hills at the end rose highest and shut out the sun , was bathed in quiet light . The white patches on the farmhouses , the heckberry trees along the river and the road , caught and emphasised the golden rays which were flooding into the lower valley as into a broad green cup . Close by , in the little vicarage orchard , were fruit trees in blossom ; the air was mild and fragrant , though to the young man from the warmer south there was still a bracing quality in the soft western breeze which blew about him . He stood there bathed in silent enchantment , an eager nature going out to meet and absorb into itself the beauty and peace of the scene . Lines of Wordsworth were on his lips ; the little well - worn volume was in his pocket , but he did not need to bring it out ; and his voice had all a poet 's intensity of emphasis as he strolled along , reciting under his breath — Presently his eye was once more caught by the roof of Burwood , lying beneath him on its promontory of land , in the quiet shelter of its protecting trees . He stopped , and a delicate sense of harmonious association awoke in him . That girl , atoning as it were by her one white life for all the crimes and coarseness of her ancestry : the idea of her seemed to steal into the solemn golden evening and give it added poetry and meaning . The young man felt a sudden strong curiosity to see her . The festal tea had begun , and Mrs. Thornburgh was presiding . Opposite to her , on the vicar 's left , sat the formidable rector 's wife . Poor Mrs. Thornburgh had said to herself as she entered the room on the arm of Mr. Mayhew , the incumbent of the neighbouring valley of Shanmoor , that the first coup d'œil was good . The flowers had been arranged in the afternoon by Rose ; Sarah 's exertions had made the silver shine again ; a pleasing odour of good food underlay the scent of the bluebells and fern ; and what with the snowy table - linen , and the pretty dresses and bright faces of the younger people , the room seemed to be full of an incessant play of crisp and delicate colour .
15735	15738	15725	15725	She	306	' guest . '
15747	15755	15725	15725	She	306	' she thought to herself with satisfaction , '
15762	15857	15757	15757	Agnes	306	' As for the young man , who was , to begin with , in that state which so often follows on the long confinement of illness , when the light seems brighter and scents keener and experience sharper than at other times , he was inwardly confessing that Mrs. Thornburgh had not been romancing . The vivid creature at his elbow , with her still unsoftened angles and movements , was in the first dawn of an exceptional beauty ; the plain sister had struck him before supper in the course of twenty minutes '
16077	16270	16057	16057	She	369	' experience as an Oxford tutor , had an abundant compassion for and understanding of such beings as young Mayhew , watched her with a pleased amusement , wondering how she did it . What ? Had she got him on carpentering , engineering — discovered his weak point ? Water - wheels , inventors , steam - engines — and the lumpish lad all in a glow , talking away nineteen to the dozen . What tact , what kindness in her gray - blue eyes ! But he was interrupted by Mrs. Seaton , who was perfectly well aware that she had beside her a stranger of some prestige , an Oxford man , and a member , besides , of a well - known Sussex county family . She was a large and commanding person , clad in black moiré silk . She wore a velvet diadem , Honiton lace lappets , and a variety of chains , beads , and bangles bestrewn about her that made a tinkling as she moved . Fixing her neighbour with a bland majesty of eye , she inquired of him if he were '
16278	16342	16274	16276	Sir Mowbray Elsmere	333	' Robert replied that Sir Mowbray Elsmere was his father 's cousin , and the patron of the living to which he had just been appointed . Mrs. Seaton then graciously informed him that long ago—'when I was a girl in my native Hampshire'—her family and Sir Mowbray Elsmere had been on intimate terms . Her father had been devoted to Sir Mowbray . '
16346	16359	16344	16344	I	0	' she added , with an evident though lofty desire to please , '
16371	16426	16274	16276	Sir Mowbray Elsmere	333	' Robert bowed , but it was not clear from his look that the rector 's wife had made an impression . His general conception of his relative and patron Sir Mowbray — who had been for many years the family black sheep — was , indeed , so far removed from any notions of '
16429	16785	16274	16276	Sir Mowbray Elsmere	333	' that he had some difficulty in keeping his countenance under the lady 's look and pose . He would have been still more entertained had he known the nature of the intimacy to which she referred . Mrs. Seaton 's father , in his capacity of solicitor in a small country town , had acted as electioneering agent for Sir Mowbray ( then plain Mr. ) Elsmere on two occasions — in 18 — , when his client had been triumphantly returned at a bye - election ; and two years later , when a repetition of the tactics , so successful in the previous contest , led to a petition , and to the disappearance of the heir to the Elsmere property from parliamentary life . Of these matters , however , he was ignorant , and Mrs. Seaton did not enlighten him . Drawing herself up a little , and proceeding in a more neutral tone than before , she proceeded to put him through a catechism on Oxford , alternately cross - examining him and expounding to him her own views and her husband 's on the functions of Universities . She and the Archdeacon conceived that the Oxford authorities were mainly occupied in ruining the young men 's health by over - examination , and poisoning their minds by free - thinking opinions . In her belief , if it went on , the mothers of England would refuse to send their sons to these ancient but deadly resorts . She looked at him sternly as she spoke , as though defying him to be flippant in return . And he , indeed , did his polite best to be serious . But it somewhat disconcerted him in the middle to find Miss Leyburn 's eyes upon him . And undeniably there was a spark of laughter in them , quenched , as soon as his glance crossed hers , under long lashes . How that spark had lit up the grave , pale face ! He longed to provoke it again , to cross over to her and say , '
16805	16873	16874	16874	I	0	' But , instead , he made friends with Rose . Mrs. Seaton was soon engaged in giving the vicar advice on his parochial affairs , an experience which generally ended by the appearance of certain truculent elements in one of the mildest of men . So Robert was free to turn to his girl neighbour and ask her what people meant by calling the Lakes rainy . '
16901	16902	16904	16904	you	1247	' '
16929	16930	16916	16917	the tourists	1250	' '
16943	16951	16916	16917	the tourists	1250	' he thought to himself , amused , '
16960	17263	17264	17264	our	1253	' He threw himself into a war of words with her , and enjoyed it extremely . Her brilliant colouring , her gestures as fresh and untamed as the movements of the leaping river outside , the mixture in her of girlish pertness and ignorance with the promise of a remarkable general capacity , made her a most taking , provoking creature . Mrs. Thornburgh — much recovered in mind since Dr. Baker had praised the pancakes by which Sarah had sought to prove to her mistress the superfluity of naughtiness involved in her recourse to foreign cooks — watched the young man and maiden with a face which grew more and more radiant . The conversation in the garden had not pleased her . Why should people always talk of Catherine ; Mrs. Thornburgh stood in awe of Catherine and had given her up in despair . It was the other two whose fortunes , as possibly directed by her , filled her maternal heart with sympathetic emotion . Suddenly in the midst of her satisfaction she had a rude shock . What on earth was the vicar doing ? After they had got through better than any one could have hoped , thanks to a discreet silence and Sarah 's makeshifts , there was the master of the house pouring the whole tale of his wife 's aspirations and disappointment into Mrs. Seaton 's ear ! If it were ever allowable to rush upon your husband at table and stop his mouth with a dinner napkin , Mrs. Thornburgh could at this moment have performed such a feat . She nodded and coughed and fidgeted in vain ! The vicar 's confidences were the result of a fit of nervous exasperation . Mrs. Seaton had just embarked upon an account of '
17271	17462	17268	17269	Lord Fleckwood	370	' Now Lord Fleckwood was a distant cousin of Archdeacon Seaton , and the great magnate of the neighbourhood , not , however , a very respectable magnate . Mr. Thornburgh had heard accounts of Lupton Castle from Mrs. Seaton on at least half a dozen different occasions . Privately he believed them all to refer to one visit , an event of immemorial antiquity periodically brought up to date by Mrs. Seaton 's imagination . But the vicar was a timid man , without the courage of his opinions , and in his eagerness to stop the flow of his neighbour 's eloquence he could think of no better device , or more suitable rival subject , than to plunge into the story of the drunken carrier , and the pastry still reposing on the counter at Randall 's . He blushed , good man , when he was well in it . His wife 's horrified countenance embarrassed him . But anything was better than Lord Fleckwood . Mrs. Seaton listened to him with the slightest smile on her formidable lip . The story was pleasing to her . '
17470	17485	17268	17269	Lord Fleckwood	370	' she said when he paused , nodding her diademed head with stately emphasis , '
17533	17613	17513	17514	my husband	1257	' The vicar fidgeted in his chair . What ineptitude had he been guilty of now ! By way of avoiding Lord Fleckwood he might have started Mrs. Seaton on teetotalism . Now if there was one topic on which this awe - inspiring woman was more awe - inspiring than another it was on the topic of teetotalism . The vicar had already felt himself a criminal as he drank his modest glass of claret under her eye . '
17624	17637	17513	17514	my husband	1257	' said Dr. Baker , from the other end of the table . '
17696	17697	17768	17768	You	1265	' '
17700	17767	17768	17768	You	1265	' repeated Mrs. Seaton in a deep voice , throwing up her eyes . But she would not venture an argument with Dr. Baker . He had all the cheery self - confidence of the old established local doctor , who knows himself to be a power , and neither Mrs. Seaton nor her restless intriguing little husband had ever yet succeeded in putting him down . '
17776	17786	17768	17768	You	1265	' said Dr. Baker to Elsmere across the table . '
18046	18047	18064	18066	my dear madam	1279	' '
18055	18061	18064	18066	my dear madam	1279	' said Mrs. Seaton drily . '
18068	18077	18078	18078	we	1280	' said the doctor , shrugging his shoulders , '
18122	18175	18113	18114	Miss Leyburn	369	' And he turned round to his neighbour with a complete change of expression , and a voice that had a new note in it of affectionate respect . Catherine coloured as if she did not like being addressed on the subject , and just nodded a little with gentle affirmative eyes . '
18180	18190	18113	18114	Miss Leyburn	369	' said Dr. Baker , again looking at Elsmere . '
18326	18406	18415	18415	we	1293	' He paused a moment . A salutary sense has begun to penetrate even modern provincial society , that no man may tell a ghost story without leave . Rose threw a merry glance at him . They two were very old friends . Dr. Baker had pulled out her first teeth and given her a sixpence afterwards for each operation . The pull was soon forgotten ; the sixpence lived on gratefully in a child 's warm memory . '
18410	18414	18415	18415	we	1293	' she said ; '
18433	18434	18435	18435	You	1287	' '
18451	18462	18448	18449	Miss Rose	369	' said the doctor , lifting a finger at her . '
18613	18614	18591	18591	I	0	' '
18622	18628	18617	18618	the girl	930	' asked Mrs. Seaton harshly . '
18632	18638	18617	18618	the girl	930	' said the doctor hastily , '
18684	18708	18617	18618	the girl	930	' Mrs. Seaton 's grim mouth relaxed into an ungenial smile . She put up her eye - glass and looked at Catherine . '
18717	18722	18617	18618	the girl	930	' she said shortly , '
18730	18770	18771	18771	I	0	' Doctor Baker looked at the rector 's wife , and a kind of flame came into his eyes . He and Mrs. Seaton were old enemies , and he was a quick - tempered mercurial sort of man . '
18788	18793	18771	18771	I	0	' he said hotly . '
18858	19091	18845	18845	You	1309	' And the doctor turned his weather - beaten elderly face upon her with a look which was half defiance and half apology . She , on her side , had flushed painfully , laying her white finger - tips imploringly on his arm . Mrs. Seaton turned away with a little dry cough , so did her spectacled sister at the other end of the table . Mrs. Leyburn , on the other hand , sat in a little ecstasy , looking at Catherine and Dr. Baker , something glistening in her eyes . Robert Elsmere alone showed presence of mind . Bending across to Dr. Baker , he asked him a sudden question as to the history of a certain strange green mound or barrow that rose out of a flat field not far from the vicarage windows . Dr. Baker grasped his whiskers , threw the young man a queer glance , and replied . Thenceforward he and Robert kept up a lively antiquarian talk on the traces of Norse settlement in the Cumbrian valleys , which lasted till the ladies left the dining - room . As Catherine Leyburn went out Elsmere stood holding the door open . She could not help raising her eyes upon him , eyes full of a half - timid , half - grateful friendliness . His own returned her look with interest . '
19102	19673	18845	18845	You	1309	' he thought to himself with a new - born thrill of sympathy , as he went back to his seat . She had not yet said a direct word to him , and yet he was curiously convinced that here was one of the most interesting persons , and one of the persons most interesting to him , that he had ever met . What mingled delicacy and strength in the hand that had lain beside her on the dinner - table — what potential depths of feeling in the full dark - fringed eye ! Half an hour later , when Elsmere re - entered the drawing - room , he found Catherine Leyburn sitting by an open French window that looked out on the lawn , and on the dim rocky face of the fell . Adeline Baker , a stooping red - armed maiden , with a pretty face , set off , as she imagined , by a vast amount of cheap finery , was sitting beside her , studying her with a timid adoration . The doctor 's daughter regarded Catherine Leyburn , who during the last five years had made herself almost as distinct a figure in the popular imagination of a few Westmoreland valleys as Sister Dora among her Walsall miners , as a being of a totally different order from herself . She was glued to the side of her idol , but her shy and awkward tongue could find hardly anything to say to her . Catherine , however , talked away , gently stroking the while the girl 's rough hand which lay on her knee , to the mingled pain and bliss of its owner , who was outraged by the contrast between her own ungainly member and Miss Leyburn 's delicate fingers . Mrs. Seaton was on the sofa beside Mrs. Thornburgh , amply avenging herself on the vicar 's wife for any checks she might have received at tea . Miss Barks , her sister , an old maid with a face that seemed to be perpetually peering forward , light colourless hair surmounted by a cap adorned with artificial nasturtiums , and white - lashed eyes armed with spectacles , was having her way with Mrs. Leyburn , inquiring into the household arrangements of Burwood with a cross - examining power which made the mild widow as pulp before her . When the gentlemen entered , Mrs. Thornburgh looked round hastily . She herself had opened that door into the garden . A garden on a warm summer night offers opportunities no schemer should neglect . Agnes and Rose were chattering and laughing on the gravel path just outside it , their white girlish figures showing temptingly against the dusky background of garden and fell . It somewhat disappointed the vicar 's wife to see her tall guest take a chair and draw it beside Catherine — while Adeline Baker awkwardly got up and disappeared into the garden . Elsmere felt it an unusually interesting moment , so strong had been his sense of attraction at tea ; but like the rest of us he could find nothing more telling to start with than a remark about the weather . Catherine in her reply asked him if he were quite recovered from the attack of low fever he was understood to have been suffering from . '
19677	19682	18845	18845	You	1309	' he said brightly , '
19744	19824	19825	19825	Your	0	' Catherine looked up at him with a quick impulse of liking . What an eager face it was ! Eagerness , indeed , seemed to be the note of the whole man , of the quick eyes and mouth , the flexible hands and energetic movements . Even the straight , stubbly hair , its owner 's passing torment , standing up round the high open brow , seemed to help the general impression of alertness and vigour . '
19835	19839	19828	19828	I	0	' said Catherine . '
19846	19855	19842	19844	My poor mother	1313	' and the young man smiled half sadly . '
19904	19921	19922	19922	he	1317	' But I do n't know why I should imagine that these things interest other people , '
19939	19944	19946	19946	Catherine	358	' Please go on , '
19969	20082	19961	19961	he	1317	' Really ? Well then , my great - uncle , old Sir William , wished me to have it when I grew up . I was against it for a long time , took orders ; but I wanted something more stirring than a country parish . One has dreams of many things . But one 's dreams come to nothing . I got ill at Oxford . The doctors forbade the town work . The old incumbent who had held the living since my father 's death died precisely at that moment . I felt myself booked , and gave in to various friends ; but it is second best . '
20109	20117	20118	20118	she	1318	' But the country is not idleness , '
20186	20197	20198	20198	he	1319	' You do not find it so , I imagine , '
20433	20446	20447	20447	she	1318	' I understand French very little , and I never read any , '
20659	20665	20666	20666	he	1319	' Were you ever there ? '
20670	20673	20674	20674	she	1318	' Once , '
20677	20717	20674	20674	she	1318	' I went with my father one summer term . I have only a confused memory of it — of the quadrangles , and a long street , a great building with a dome , and such beautiful trees ! '
20718	20726	20666	20666	he	1319	' Did your father often go back ? '
20727	20745	20674	20674	she	1318	' No ; never towards the latter part of his life'—and her clear eyes clouded a little ; '
20757	20797	20798	20798	He	1319	' She paused , as though she had strayed on to a topic where expression was a little difficult . Then his face and clerical dress seemed somehow to reassure her , and she began again , though reluctantly . '
20862	20892	20846	20860	men who only wanted to destroy and break down everything that was sacred to him	1332	' Elsmere reflected that Richard Leyburn must have left Oxford about the beginning of the Liberal reaction , which followed Tractarianism , and in twenty years transformed the University . '
20895	20902	20846	20860	men who only wanted to destroy and break down everything that was sacred to him	1332	' he said , smiling gently . '
20946	21001	21002	21002	I	0	' Catherine looked up at him with a sweet sympathetic look . That dim vision of Oxford , with its gray , tree - lined walls , lay very near to her heart for her father 's sake . And the keen face above her seemed to satisfy and respond to her inner feeling . '
21012	21018	21002	21002	I	0	' she said , hesitating ; '
21033	21070	21025	21025	father	1334	' The last words had slipped out of her , and she checked herself suddenly . Robert saw that she was uncertain as to his opinions , and afraid lest she might have said something discourteous . '
21080	21085	21025	21025	father	1334	' he said quickly , '
21147	21355	21356	21356	We	1336	' His voice had taken to itself a singular magnetism . Evidently the matters they were discussing were matters in which he felt a deep and loving interest . His young boyish face had grown grave ; there was a striking dignity and weight in his look and manner , which suddenly roused in Catherine the sense that she was speaking to a man of distinction , accustomed to deal on equal terms with the large things of life . She raised her eyes to him for a moment , and he saw in them a beautiful , mystical light — responsive , lofty , full of soul . The next moment , it apparently struck her sharply that their conversation was becoming incongruous with its surroundings . Behind them Mrs. Thornburgh was bustling about with candles and music - stools , preparing for a performance on the flute by Mr. Mayhew , the black - browed vicar of Shanmoor , and the room seemed to be pervaded by Mrs. Seaton 's strident voice . Her strong natural reserve asserted itself , and her face settled again into the slight rigidity of expression characteristic of it . She rose and prepared to move farther into the room . '
21360	21661	21356	21356	We	1336	' she said to him , smiling , over her shoulder . And she left him , settling herself by the side of Mrs. Leyburn . He had a momentary sense of rebuff . The man , quick , sensitive , sympathetic , felt in the woman the presence of a strength , a self - sufficingness which was not all attractive . His vanity , if he had cherished any during their conversation , was not flattered by its close . But as he leant against the window - frame waiting for the music to begin , he could hardly keep his eyes from her . He was a man who , by force of temperament , made friends readily with women , though except for a passing fancy or two he had never been in love ; and his sense of difficulty with regard to this stiffly - mannered , deep - eyed country girl brought with it an unusual stimulus and excitement . Miss Barks seated herself deliberately , after much fiddling with bracelets and gloves , and tied back the ends of her cap behind her . Mr. Mayhew took out his flute and lovingly put it together . He was a powerful swarthy man , who said little and was generally alarming to the ladies of the neighbourhood . To propitiate him , they asked him to bring his flute , and nervously praised the fierce music he made on it . Miss Barks enjoyed a monopoly of his accompaniments , and there were many who regarded her assiduity as a covert attack upon the widower 's name and position . If so , it was Greek meeting Greek , for with all his taciturnity the vicar of Shanmoor was well able to defend himself . '
21666	21952	21356	21356	We	1336	' said a hurried whisper at Elsmere 's elbow , and turning he saw Rose and Agnes on the step of the window , Rose 's cheeks flushed by the night breeze , a shawl thrown lightly round her head . She was answered by the first notes of the flute , following some powerful chords in which Miss Barks had tested at once the strength of her wrists and the vicarage piano . The girl made a little moue of disgust , and turned as though to fly down the steps again . But Agnes caught her and held her , and the mutinous creature had to submit to be drawn inside while Mrs. Thornburgh , in obedience to complaints of draughts from Mrs. Seaton motioned to have the window shut . Rose established herself against the wall , her curly head thrown back , her eyes half shut , her mouth expressing an angry endurance . Robert watched her with amusement . It was certainly a remarkable duet . After an adagio opening in which flute and piano were at magnificent cross purposes from the beginning , the two instruments plunged into an allegro very long and very fast , which became ultimately a desperate race between the competing performers for the final chord . Mr. Mayhew toiled away , taxing the resources of his whole vast frame to keep his small instrument in a line with the piano , and taxing them in vain . For the shriller and the wilder grew the flute , and the greater the exertion of the dark Hercules performing on it , the fiercer grew the pace of the piano . Rose stamped her little foot . '
21959	21963	21356	21356	We	1336	' she murmured , '
21974	22077	21969	21970	no one	8624	' But the pages flew past , turned assiduously by Agnes , who took a sardonic delight in these performances , and every countenance in the room seemed to take a look of sharpened anxiety as to how the duet was to end , and who was to be victor . Nobody knowing Miss Barks need to have been in any doubt as to that ! Crash came the last chord , and the poor flute nearly half a page behind was left shrilly hanging in mid - air , forsaken and companionless , an object of derision to gods and men . '
22087	22100	22080	22080	I	0	' said the lady , triumphantly looking up at the discomfited clergyman . '
22104	22126	22080	22080	I	0	' said Rose , hiding herself in the window curtain beside him , that she might have her laugh in safety . '
22142	22156	22157	22157	Rose	369	' But before he could answer , Mrs. Thornburgh called to the girl — '
22173	22254	22169	22169	your	369	' Rose advanced reluctantly , her head in air . Robert , remembering something that Mrs. Thornburgh had said to him as to her musical power , supposed that she felt it an indignity to be asked to play in such company . Mrs. Thornburgh motioned to him to come and sit by Mrs. Leyburn , a summons which he obeyed with the more alacrity , as it brought him once more within reach of Mrs. Leyburn 's eldest daughter . '
22264	22282	22256	22256	you	369	' asked Mrs. Leyburn in her little mincing voice , making room for his chair beside them . '
22299	22464	22287	22287	I	0	' Catherine moved abruptly . Robert , while he made some pleasant answer , divined that the reserved and stately daughter must be often troubled by the mother 's expansiveness . Meanwhile the room was again settling itself to listen . Mrs. Seaton was severely turning over a photograph book . In her opinion the violin was an unbecoming instrument for young women . Miss Barks sat upright with the studiously neutral expression which befits the artist asked to listen to a rival . Mr. Thornburgh sat pensive , one foot drooped over the other . He was very fond of the Leyburn girls , but music seemed to him , good man , one of the least comprehensible of human pleasures . As for Rose , she had at last arranged herself and her accompanist Agnes , after routing out from her music a couple of Fantasie - Stücke , which she had wickedly chosen as presenting the most severely classical contrast to the '
22466	22741	22742	22748	the lovers waiting in the hidden years	1341	' played by the preceding performers . She stood with her lithe figure in its old - fashioned dress thrown out against the black coats of a group of gentlemen beyond , one slim arched foot advanced , the ends of the blue sash dangling , the hand and arm , beautifully formed , but still wanting the roundness of womanhood , raised high for action , the lightly poised head thrown back with an air . Robert thought her a bewitching , half - grown thing , overflowing with potentialities of future brilliance and empire . Her music astonished him . Where had a little provincial maiden learned to play with this intelligence , this force , this delicate command of her instrument ? He was not a musician , and therefore could not gauge her exactly , but he was more or less familiar with music and its standards , as all people become nowadays who live in a highly cultivated society , and he knew enough at any rate to see that what he was listening to was remarkable , was out of the common range . Still more evident was this , when from the humorous piece with which the sisters led off — a dance of clowns , but clowns of Arcady — they slid into a delicate rippling chant d'amour , the long drawn notes of the violin rising and falling on the piano accompaniment with an exquisite plaintiveness . Where did a fillette , unformed , inexperienced , win the secret of so much eloquence — only from the natural dreams of a girl 's heart as to '
22749	22818	22742	22748	the lovers waiting in the hidden years	1341	' ? But when the music ceased , Elsmere , after a hearty clap that set the room applauding likewise , turned not to the musician but the figure beside Mrs. Leyburn , the sister who had sat listening with an impassiveness , a sort of gentle remoteness of look , which had piqued his curiosity . The mother meanwhile was drinking in the compliments of Dr. Baker . '
22821	22825	22742	22748	the lovers waiting in the hidden years	1341	' cried Elsmere . '
22855	22856	22857	22857	She	1342	' '
22870	22875	22857	22857	She	1342	' said Catherine quietly ; '
22885	22886	22878	22878	she	1342	' '
22890	22895	22878	22878	she	1342	' he said warmly , '
22915	22923	22924	22924	I	0	' She did not answer very readily . '
22929	22935	22924	22924	I	0	' she said at last . '
22944	23127	23128	23128	Her	1347	' He would have been repelled by her irresponsiveness but that her last words had in them a note of lingering , of wistfulness , as though the subject were connected with an inner debate not yet solved which troubled her . He was puzzled , but certainly not repelled . Twenty minutes later everybody was going . The Seatons went first , and the other guests lingered awhile afterwards to enjoy the sense of freedom left by their departure . But at last the Mayhews , father and son , set off on foot to walk home over the moonlit mountains ; the doctor tucked himself and his daughter into his high gig , and drove off with a sweeping ironical bow to Rose , who had stood on the steps teasing him to the last ; and Robert Elsmere offered to escort the Miss Leyburns and their mother home . Mrs. Thornburgh was left protesting to the vicar 's incredulous ears that never — never as long as she lived — would she have Mrs. Seaton inside her doors again . '
23131	23155	23128	23128	Her	1347	' cried the vicar 's wife , fuming—'her manners would disgrace a Whinborough shop - girl . She has none — positively none ! '
23171	23252	23158	23158	her	1347	' But , after all , William , say what you will — and you always do say the most unpleasant things you can think of — it was a great success . I know the Leyburns enjoyed it . And as for Robert , I saw him looking — looking at that little minx Rose while she was playing as if he could n't take his eyes off her . What a picture she made , to be sure ! '
23306	23309	23310	23310	he	1019	' Rose ? '
23314	23325	23310	23310	he	1019	' Rose , my dear , where were your eyes ? '
23363	23370	23371	23371	he	1019	' Do you mean to say , '
23378	23405	23371	23371	he	1019	' that you did n't notice that from the moment you first introduced Robert to Catherine Leyburn , he had practically no attention for anybody else ? '
23437	23440	23441	23441	she	448	' Catherine ! '
23445	23451	23441	23441	she	448	' Catherine ! how absurd ! '
26199	26217	26196	26196	he	1379	' I can truly say with Pope , that this great work has afforded me extraordinary pleasure . '
26314	26321	26322	26322	he	1379	' I have just finished Belial ! '
26331	26337	26322	26322	he	1379	' and am beginning Beelzebub . '
26874	26899	26843	26844	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' complete holiday before the examination , and he and his mother spent it in exploring the beautiful old town , now shrouded in the '
26902	26970	26843	26844	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' of still , gray autumn weather . There was no sun to light up the misty reaches of the river ; the trees in the Broad Walk were almost bare ; the Virginian creeper no longer shone in patches of delicate crimson on the college walls ; the gardens were damp and forsaken . But to Mrs. Elsmere and Robert the place needed neither sun nor summer '
26976	27051	26843	26844	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' On both of them it laid its old irresistible spell ; the sentiment haunting its quadrangles , its libraries , and its dim melodious chapels , stole into the lad 's heart and alternately soothed and stimulated that keen individual consciousness which naturally accompanies the first entrance into manhood . Here , on this soil , steeped in memories , his problems , his struggles were to be fought out in their turn . '
27057	27063	26843	26844	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' said the inward voice , '
27079	27695	27696	27697	Poor mother	1526	' And to this thrill of vague expectation , this young sense of an expanding world , something of pathos and of sacredness was added by the dumb influences of the old streets and weather - beaten stones . How tenacious they were of the past ! The dreaming city seemed to be still brooding in the autumn calm over the long succession of her sons . The continuity , the complexity of human experience ; the unremitting effort of the race ; the stream of purpose running through it all ; these were the kind of thoughts which , in more or less inchoate and fragmentary shape , pervaded the boy 's sensitive mind as he rambled with his mother from college to college . Mrs. Elsmere , too , was fascinated by Oxford . But for all her eager interest , the historic beauty of the place aroused in her an under - mood of melancholy , just as it did in Robert . Both had the impressionable Celtic temperament , and both felt that a critical moment was upon them , and that the Oxford air was charged with fate for each of them . For the first time in their lives they were to be parted . The mother 's long guardianship was coming to an end . Had she loved him enough ? Had she so far fulfilled the trust her dead husband had imposed upon her ? Would her boy love her in the new life as he had loved her in the old ? And could her poor craving heart bear to see him absorbed by fresh interests and passions , in which her share could be only , at the best , secondary and indirect ? One day — it was on the afternoon preceding the examination — she gave hurried , half - laughing utterance to some of these misgivings of hers . They were walking down the Lime - walk of Trinity Gardens ; beneath their feet a yellow fresh - strewn carpet of leaves , brown interlacing branches overhead , and a red misty sun shining through the trunks . Robert understood his mother perfectly , and the way she had of hiding a storm of feeling under these tremulous comedy airs . So that , instead of laughing too , he took her hand and , there being no spectators anywhere to be seen in the damp November garden , he raised it to his lips with a few broken words of affection and gratitude which very nearly overcame the self - command of both of them . She dashed wildly into another subject , and then suddenly it occurred to her impulsive mind that the moment had come to make him acquainted with those dying intentions of his great - uncle which we have already described . The diversion was a welcome one , and the duty seemed clear . So , accordingly , she made him give her all his attention while she told him the story and the terms of Sir Mowbray 's letter , forcing herself the while to keep her own opinions and predilections as much as possible out of sight . Robert listened with interest and astonishment , the sense of a new - found manhood waxing once more strong within him , as his mind admitted the strange picture of himself occupying the place which had been his father 's ; master of the house and the parish he had wandered over with childish steps , clinging to the finger or the coat of the tall stooping figure which occupied the dim background of his recollections . '
27699	27708	27696	27697	Poor mother	1526	' he said thoughtfully , when she paused , '
27721	27722	27696	27697	Poor mother	1526	' '
27736	27743	27725	27725	you	1527	' said Mrs. Elsmere , sighing . '
27812	27856	27870	27870	mother	8451	' The boy drew himself up to his full height , and tossed his tumbling reddish hair back from his eyes . He was nearly six feet already , with a long thin body and head , which amply justified his school nickname of '
27862	27863	27870	27870	mother	8451	' '
27872	27882	27870	27870	mother	8451	' he said , with a tone of decision : '
27895	28001	27870	27870	mother	8451	' Mrs. Elsmere was old enough to know what importance to attach to the trenchancy of eighteen , but still the words were pleasant to her . The next day Robert went up for examination , and after three days of hard work , and phases of alternate hope and depression , in which mother and son excited one another to no useful purpose , there came the anxious crowding round the college gate in the November twilight , and the sudden flight of dispersing messengers bearing the news over Oxford . The scholarship had been won by a precocious Etonian with an extraordinary talent for '
28004	29180	27870	27870	mother	8451	' and all that appertained thereto . But the exhibition fell to Robert , and mother and son were well content . The boy was eager to come into residence at once , though he would matriculate too late to keep the term . The college authorities were willing , and on the Saturday following the announcement of his success he was matriculated , saw the Provost , and was informed that rooms would be found for him without delay . His mother and he gaily climbed innumerable stairs to inspect the garrets of which he was soon to take proud possession , sallying forth from them only to enjoy an agitated delightful afternoon among the shops . Expenditure , always charming , becomes under these circumstances a sacred and pontifical act . Never had Mrs. Elsmere bought a teapot for herself with half the fervour which she now threw into the purchase of Robert 's ; and the young man , accustomed to a rather bare home , and an Irish lack of the little elegancies of life , was overwhelmed when his mother actually dragged him into a printseller 's , and added an engraving or two to the enticing miscellaneous mass of which he was already master . They only just left themselves time to rush back to their lodgings and dress for the solemn function of a dinner with the Provost . The dinner , however , was a great success . The short , shy manner of their white - haired host thawed under the influence of Mrs. Elsmere 's racy , unaffected ways , and it was not long before everybody in the room had more or less made friends with her , and forgiven her her marvellous drab poplin , adorned with fresh pink ruchings for the occasion . As for the Provost , Mrs. Elsmere had been told that he was a person of whom she must inevitably stand in awe . But all her life long she had been like the youth in the fairy tale who desired to learn how to shiver and could not attain unto it . Fate had denied her the capacity of standing in awe of anybody , and she rushed at her host as a new type , delighting in the thrill which she felt creeping over her when she found herself on the arm of one who had been the rallying - point of a hundred struggles , and a centre of influence over thousands of English lives . And then followed the proud moment when Robert , in his exhibitioner 's gown , took her to service in the chapel on Sunday . The scores of young faces , the full unison of the hymns , and finally the Provost 's sermon , with its strange brusqueries and simplicities of manner and phrase — simplicities so suggestive , so full of a rich and yet disciplined experience , that they haunted her mind for weeks afterwards — completed the general impression made upon her by the Oxford life . She came out , tremulous and shaken , leaning on her son 's arm . She , too , like the generations before her , had launched her venture into the deep . Her boy was putting out from her into the ocean ; henceforth she could but watch him from the shore . Brought into contact with this imposing University organisation , with all its suggestions of virile energies and functions , the mother suddenly felt herself insignificant and forsaken . He had been her all , her own , and now on this training - ground of English youth , it seemed to her that the great human society had claimed him from her . In his Oxford life Robert surrendered himself to the best and most stimulating influences of the place , just as he had done at school . He was a youth of many friends , by virtue of a natural gift of sympathy , which was no doubt often abused , and by no means invariably profitable to its owner , but wherein , at any rate , his power over his fellows , like the power of half the potent men in the world 's history , always lay rooted . He had his mother 's delight in living . He loved the cricket - field , he loved the river ; his athletic instincts and his athletic friends were always fighting in him with his literary instincts and the friends who appealed primarily to the intellectual and moral side of him . He made many mistakes alike in friends and in pursuits ; in the freshness of a young and roving curiosity he had great difficulty in submitting himself to the intellectual routine of the University , a difficulty which ultimately cost him much ; but at the bottom of the lad , all the time , there was a strength of will , a force and even tyranny of conscience , which kept his charm and pliancy from degenerating into weakness , and made it not only delightful , but profitable to love him . He knew that his mother was bound up in him , and his being was set to satisfy , so far as he could , all her honourable ambitions . His many undergraduate friends , strong as their influence must have been in the aggregate on a nature so receptive , hardly concern us here . His future life , so far as we can see , was most noticeably affected by two men older than himself , and belong ing to the dons — both of them fellows and tutors of St. Anselm 's , though on different planes of age . The first one , Edward Langham , was Robert 's tutor , and about seven years older than himself . He was a man about whom , on entering the college , Robert heard more than the usual crop of stories . The healthy young English barbarian has an aversion to the intrusion of more manner into life than is absolutely necessary . Now , Langham was overburdened with manner , though it was manner of the deprecating and not of the arrogant order . Decisions , it seemed , of all sorts were abominable to him . To help a friend he had once consented to be Pro - proctor . He resigned in a month , and none of his acquaintances ever afterwards dared to allude to the experience . If you could have got at his inmost mind , it was affirmed , the persons most obnoxious there would have been found to be the scout , who intrusively asked him every morning what he would have for breakfast , and the college cook , who , till such a course was strictly forbidden him , mounted to his room at half - past nine to inquire whether he would '
29184	29653	27870	27870	mother	8451	' Being a scholar of considerable eminence , it pleased him to assume on all questions an exasperating degree of ignorance ; and the wags of the college averred that when asked if it rained , or if collections took place on such and such a day , it was pain and grief to him to have to affirm positively , without qualifications , that so it was . Such a man was not very likely , one would have thought , to captivate an ardent , impulsive boy like Elsmere . Edward Langham , however , notwithstanding undergraduate tales , was a very remarkable person . In the first place , he was possessed of exceptional personal beauty . His colouring was vividly black and white , closely curling jet - black hair , and fine black eyes contrasting with a pale , clear complexion and even , white teeth . So far he had the characteristics which certain Irishmen share with most Spaniards . But the Celtic or Iberian brilliance was balanced by a classical delicacy and precision of feature . He had the brow , the nose , the upper lip , the finely - moulded chin , which belong to the more severe and spiritual Greek type . Certainly of Greek blitheness and directness there was no trace . The eye was wavering and profoundly melancholy ; all the movements of the tall , finely - built frame were hesitating and doubtful . It was as though the man were suffering from paralysis of some moral muscle or other ; as if some of the normal springs of action in him had been profoundly and permanently weakened . He had a curious history . He was the only child of a doctor in a Lincolnshire country town . His old parents had brought him up in strict provincial ways , ignoring the boy 's idiosyncrasies as much as possible . They did not want an exceptional and abnormal son , and they tried to put down his dreamy , self - conscious habits by forcing him into the common , middle - class , Evangelical groove . As soon as he got to college , however , the brooding , gifted nature had a moment of sudden and , as it seemed to the old people in Gainsborough , most reprehensible expansion . Poems were sent to them , cut out of one or the other of the leading periodicals , with their son 's initials appended , and articles of philosophical art - criticism , published while the boy was still an undergraduate — which seemed to the stern father everything that was sophistical and subversive . For they treated Christianity itself as an open question , and showed especially scant respect for the '
29660	29720	27870	27870	mother	8451	' The father warned him grimly that he was not going to spend his hard - earned savings on the support of a free - thinking scribbler , and the young man wrote no more till just after he had taken a double first in Greats . Then the publication of an article in one of the leading Reviews on '
29726	29991	29992	29992	Mother	393	' not only brought him a furious letter from home stopping all supplies , but also lost him a probable fellowship . His college was one of the narrowest and most backward in Oxford , and it was made perfectly plain to him before the fellowship examination that he would not be elected . He left the college , took pupils for a while , then stood for a vacant fellowship at St. Anselm 's , the Liberal headquarters , and got it with flying colours . Thenceforward one would have thought that a brilliant and favourable mental development was secured to him . Not at all . The moment of his quarrel with his father and his college had , in fact , represented a moment of energy , of comparative success , which never recurred . It was as though this outburst of action and liberty had disappointed him , as if some deep - rooted instinct — cold , critical , reflective — had reasserted itself , condemning him and his censors equally . The uselessness of utterance , the futility of enthusiasm , the inaccessibility of the ideal , the practical absurdity of trying to realise any of the mind 's inward dreams : these were the kind of considerations which descended upon him , slowly and fatally , crushing down the newly springing growths of action or of passion . It was as though life had demonstrated to him the essential truth of a childish saying of his own which had startled and displeased his Calvinist mother years before . '
29994	30015	29992	29992	Mother	393	' the delicate , large - eyed child had said to her one day in a fit of physical weariness , '
30036	30754	30033	30033	I	0	' So he wrote no more , he quarrelled no more , he meddled with the great passionate things of life and expression no more . On his taking up residence in St. Anselm 's , indeed , and on his being appointed first lecturer and then tutor , he had a momentary pleasure in the thought of teaching . His mind was a storehouse of thought and fact , and to the man brought up at a dull provincial day - school and never allowed to associate freely with his kind , the bright lads fresh from Eton and Harrow about him were singularly attractive . But a few terms were enough to scatter this illusion too . He could not be simple , he could not be spontaneous ; he was tormented by self - consciousness , and it was impossible to him to talk and behave as those talk and behave who have been brought up more or less in the big world from the beginning . So this dream , too , faded , for youth asks , before all things , simplicity and spontaneity in those who would take possession of it . His lectures , which were at first brilliant enough to attract numbers of men from other colleges , became gradually mere dry , ingenious skeletons , without life or feeling . It was possible to learn a great deal from him ; it was not possible to catch from him any contagion of that amor intellectualis which had flamed at one moment so high within him . He ceased to compose ; but as the intellectual faculty must have some employment , he became a translator , a contributor to dictionaries , a microscopic student of texts , not in the interest of anything beyond , but simply as a kind of mental stone - breaking . The only survival of that moment of glow and colour in his life was his love of music and the theatre . Almost every year he disappeared to France to haunt the Paris theatres for a fortnight ; to Berlin or Bayreuth to drink his fill of music . He talked neither of music nor of acting ; he made no one sharer of his enjoyment , if he did enjoy . It was simply his way of cheating his creative faculty , which , though it had grown impotent , was still there , still restless . Altogether a melancholy , pitiable man — at once thorough - going sceptic and thorough - going idealist , the victim of that critical sense which says No to every impulse , and is always restlessly , and yet hopelessly , seeking the future through the neglected and outraged present . And yet the man 's instincts , at this period of his life at any rate , were habitually kindly and affectionate . He knew nothing of women , and was not liked by them , but it was not his fault if he made no impression on the youth about him . It seemed to him that he was always seeking in their eyes and faces for some light of sympathy which was always escaping him , and which he was powerless to compel . He met it for the first time in Robert Elsmere . The susceptible , poetical boy was struck at some favourable moment by that romantic side of the ineffective tutor — his silence , his melancholy , his personal beauty — which no one else , with perhaps one or two exceptions among the older men , cared to take into account ; or touched perhaps by some note in him , surprised in passing , of weariness or shrinking , as compared with the contemptuous tone of the College towards him . He showed his liking impetuously , boyishly , as his way was , and thenceforward during his University career Langham became his slave . He had no ambition for himself ; his motto might have been that dismal one—'The small things of life are odious to me , and the habit of them enslaves me ; the great things of life are eternally attractive to me , and indolence and fear put them by ; '
30991	31000	31001	31001	he	464	' I have had an offer , Elsmere , '
31109	31116	31095	31095	Robert	359	' I congratulate you , sir . '
31117	31123	31125	31125	Langham	464	' I have refused it , '
31158	31163	31165	31166	the other	1544	' Do you think — '
31235	31402	31220	31220	Reid	396	' He looked at Elsmere under his straight black brows imperiously . The youth felt the nervous tension in the elder man 's voice and manner , was startled by a confidence never before bestowed upon him , close as that unequal bond between them had been growing during the six months of his Oxford life , and plucking up courage hurled at him a number of frank , young expostulations , which really put into friendly shape all that was being said about Langham in his College and in the University . Why was he so self - distrustful , so absurdly diffident of responsibility , so bent on hiding his great gifts under a bushel ? The tutor smiled sadly , and , sitting down , buried his head in his hands and said nothing for a while . Then he looked up and stretched out a hand towards a book which lay on a table near . It was the Réveries of Senancour . '
31409	31413	31403	31403	My	0	' he said . '
31447	31479	31421	31421	Elsmere	359	' Elsmere looked up with one of his flashing , affectionate smiles , and took the book from Langham 's hand . He found on the open page a marked passage : '
31672	31717	31719	31720	that drivel	1557	' Robert looked up startled , the book dropping from his hand . The words sent a chill to the heart of one born to hope , to will , to crave . Suddenly Langham dashed the volume from him , almost with violence . '
31761	31788	31751	31751	They	1559	' Long after Elsmere , who had stayed talking a while on other things , had gone , Langham sat on brooding over the empty grate . '
31793	32163	31789	31791	Corrupter of youth	1560	' he said to himself once bitterly . And perhaps it was to a certain remorse in the tutor 's mind that Elsmere owed an experience of great importance to his after life . The name of a certain Mr. Grey had for some time before his entry at Oxford been more or less familiar to Robert 's ears as that of a person of great influence and consideration at St. Anselm 's . His tutor at Harden had spoken of him in the boy 's hearing as one of the most remarkable men of the generation , and had several times impressed upon his pupil that nothing could be so desirable for him as to secure the friendship of such a man . It was on the occasion of his first interview with the Provost , after the scholarship examination , that Robert was first brought face to face with Mr. Grey . He could remember a short dark man standing beside the Provost , who had been introduced to him by that name , but the nervousness of the moment had been so great that the boy had been quite incapable of giving him any special attention . During his first term and a half of residence , Robert occasionally met Mr. Grey in the quadrangle or in the street , and the tutor , remembering the thin , bright - faced youth , would return his salutations kindly , and sometimes stop to speak to him , to ask him if he were comfortably settled in his rooms , or make a remark about the boats . But the acquaintance did not seem likely to progress , for Mr. Grey was a Greats tutor , and Robert naturally had nothing to do with him as far as work was concerned . However , a day or two after the conversation we have described , Robert , going to Langham 's rooms late in the afternoon to return a book which had been lent to him , perceived two figures standing talking on the hearth - rug , and by the western light beating in recognised the thick - set frame and broad brow of Mr. Grey . '
32169	32181	32167	32167	Elsmere	359	' said Langham , as he stood hesitating on the threshold . '
32192	32193	32185	32186	Mr. Grey	399	' '
32202	32214	32185	32186	Mr. Grey	399	' said Mr. Grey , smiling and shaking hands with the boy '
32275	32302	32303	32303	Elsmere	313	' Langham stood a moment after the door closed , eyeing young Elsmere . There was a curious struggle going on in the tutor 's mind . '
32305	32312	32303	32303	Elsmere	313	' he said at last abruptly , '
32326	32327	32323	32323	Grey	399	' '
32330	32335	32338	32338	he	399	' exclaimed the lad . '
32343	32344	32346	32346	he	399	' '
32448	32449	32444	32444	his	399	' '
32458	32464	32452	32452	I	0	' said Robert with eagerness . '
32469	32470	32452	32452	I	0	' '
32509	32510	32497	32497	you	0	' '
32525	32542	32511	32512	The lad	8985	' thought the tutor to himself when he was alone , not without a strange reluctance . '
32562	32589	32549	32549	I	0	' The sarcasm of the last word was the kind of sarcasm which a man of his type in an earlier generation might have applied to the '
32591	32739	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' of an Arnoldian Rugby . At eight o'clock that evening Robert found himself crossing the quadrangle with Langham on the way to one of the larger lecture rooms , which was to be the scene of the address . The room when they got in was already nearly full , all the working fellows of the college were present , and a body of some thirty men besides , most of them already far on in their University career . A minute or two afterwards Mr. Grey entered . The door opening on to the quadrangle , where the trees , undeterred by east wind , were just bursting into leaf , was shut ; and the little assembly knelt , while Mr. Grey 's voice with its broad intonation , in which a strong native homeliness lingered under the gentleness of accent , recited the collect '
32747	32996	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' a silent pause following the last words . Then the audience settled itself , and Mr. Grey , standing by a small deal table with the gaslight behind him , began his address . All the main points of the experience which followed stamped themselves on Robert 's mind with extraordinary intensity . Nor did he ever lose the memory of the outward scene . In after years , memory could always recall to him at will the face and figure of the speaker , the massive head , the deep eyes sunk under the brows , the Midland accent , the make of limb and feature which seemed to have some suggestion in them of the rude strength and simplicity of a peasant ancestry ; and then the nobility , the fire , the spiritual beauty flashing through it all ! Here , indeed , was a man on whom his fellows might lean , a man in whom the generation of spiritual force was so strong and continuous that it overflowed of necessity into the poorer , barrener lives around him , kindling and enriching . Robert felt himself seized and penetrated , filled with a fervour and an admiration which he was too young and immature to analyse , but which was to be none the less potent and lasting . Much of the sermon itself , indeed , was beyond him . It was on the meaning of St. Paul 's great conception , '
33007	33030	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' What did the Apostle mean by a death to sin and self ? What were the precise ideas attached to the words '
33034	33265	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' ? Are this death and this resurrection necessarily dependent upon certain alleged historical events ? Or are they not primarily , and were they not , even in the mind of St. Paul , two aspects of a spiritual process perpetually re - enacted in the soul of man , and constituting the veritable revelation of God ? Which is the stable and lasting witness of the Father : the spiritual history of the individual and the world , or the envelope of miracle to which hitherto mankind has attributed so much importance ? Mr. Grey 's treatment of these questions was clothed , through out a large portion of the lecture , in metaphysical language , which no boy fresh from school , however intellectually quick , could be expected to follow with any precision . It was not , therefore , the argument , or the logical structure of the sermon , which so profoundly affected young Elsmere . It was the speaker himself , and the occasional passages in which , addressing himself to the practical needs of his hearers , he put before them the claims and conditions of the higher life with a pregnant simplicity and rugged beauty of phrase . Conceit , selfishness , vice — how , as he spoke of them , they seemed to wither from his presence ! How the '
33270	33282	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' with its passions and its cravings sank into nothingness beside the '
33285	33288	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' and the '
33291	33422	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' for which , as Christians and as men , he claimed their devotion . To the boy sitting among the crowd at the back of the room , his face supported in his hands and his gleaming eyes fixed on the speaker , it seemed as if all the poetry and history through which a restless curiosity and ideality had carried him so far , took a new meaning from this experience . It was by men like this that the moral progress of the world had been shaped and inspired ; he felt brought near to the great primal forces breathing through the divine workshop ; and in place of natural disposition and reverent compliance , there sprang up in him suddenly an actual burning certainty of belief . '

33443	33526	32740	32754	Lord of all power and might , ' a silent pause following the last words	9199	' and the old familiar figure of the Divine combat , of the struggle in which man and God are one , was proved once more upon a human pulse on that May night , in the hush of that quiet lecture room . As the little moving crowd of men dispersed over the main quadrangle to their respective staircases , Langham and Robert stood together a moment in the windy darkness , lit by the occasional glimmering of a cloudy moon . '
33535	33556	33533	33533	sir	1246	' said the lad , eager and yet afraid to speak , lest he should break the spell of memory . '
33567	33568	33533	33533	sir	1246	' '
33592	34106	34107	34107	You	1576	' And Langham turned away , his head sunk on his breast , his hands behind him . Robert went to his room conscious of a momentary check of feeling . But it soon passed , and he sat up late , thinking of the sermon , or pouring out in a letter to his mother the new hero - worship of which his mind was full . A few days later , as it happened , came an invitation to the junior exhibitioner to spend an evening at Mr. Grey 's house . Elsmere went in a state of curious eagerness and trepidation , and came away with a number of fresh impressions which , when he had put them into order , did but quicken his new - born sense of devotion . The quiet unpretending house with its exquisite neatness and its abundance of books , the family life , with the heart - happiness underneath , and the gentle trust and courtesy on the surface , the little touches of austerity which betrayed themselves here and there in the household ways — all these surroundings stole into the lad 's imagination , touched in him responsive fibres of taste and feeling . But there was some surprise , too , mingled with the charm . He came , still shaken , as it were , by the power of the sermon , expecting to see in the preacher of it the outward and visible signs of a leadership which , as he already knew , was a great force in Oxford life . His mood was that of the disciple only eager to be enrolled . And what he found was a quiet , friendly , host , surrounded by a group of men talking the ordinary pleasant Oxford chit - chat — the river , the schools , the Union , the football matches , and so on . Every now and then , as Elsmere stood at the edge of the circle listening , the rugged face in the centre of it would break into a smile , or some boyish speaker would elicit the low spontaneous laugh in which there was such a sound of human fellowship , such a genuine note of self - forgetfulness . Sometimes the conversation strayed into politics , and then Mr. Grey , an eager politician , would throw back his head , and talk with more sparkle and rapidity , flashing occasionally into grim humour which seemed to throw light on the innate strength and pugnacity of the peasant and Puritan breed from which he sprang . Nothing could be more unlike the inspired philosopher , the mystic surrounded by an adoring school , whom Robert had been picturing to himself in his walk up to the house , through the soft May twilight . It was not long before the tutor had learned to take much kindly notice of the ardent and yet modest exhibitioner , in whose future it was impossible not to feel a sympathetic interest . '
34119	34381	34107	34107	You	1576	' he said to him one day as they parted after watching a football match in the damp mists of the Park , and the boy 's flush of pleasure showed how much he valued the permission . For three years those Sunday half - hours were the great charm of Robert Elsmere 's life . When he came to look back upon them , he could remember nothing very definite . A few interesting scraps of talk about books ; a good deal of talk about politics , showing in the tutor a living interest in the needs and training of that broadening democracy on which the future of England rests ; a few graphic sayings about individuals ; above all , a constant readiness on the host 's part to listen , to sit quiet , with the slight unconscious look of fatigue which was so eloquent of a strenuous intellectual life , taking kindly heed of anything that sincerity , even a stupid awkward sincerity , had got to say — these were the sort of impressions they had left behind them , reinforced always , indeed , by the one continuous impression of a great soul speaking with difficulty and labour , but still clearly , still effectually , through an unblemished series of noble acts and efforts . Term after term passed away . Mrs. Elsmere became more and more proud of her boy , and more and more assured that her years of intelligent devotion to him had won her his entire love and confidence , '
34390	35075	34107	34107	You	1576	' she came up to see him once or twice , making Langham almost flee the University because she would be grateful to him in public , and attending the boat - races in festive attire to which she had devoted the most anxious attention for Robert 's sake , and which made her , dear , good , impracticable soul , the observed of all observers . When she came she and Robert talked all day , so far as lectures allowed , and most of the night , after their own eager , improvident fashion ; and she soon gathered , with that solemn , half - tragic sense of change which besets a mother 's heart at such a moment , that there were many new forces at work in her boy 's mind , deep under - currents of feeling , stirred in him by the Oxford influences , which must before long rise powerfully to the surface . He was passing from a bright buoyant lad into a man , and a man of ardour and conviction . And the chief instrument in the transformation was Mr. Grey . Elsmere got his first in Moderations easily . But the Final Schools were a different matter . In the first days of his return to Oxford , in the October of his third year , while he was still making up his lecture list , and taking a general oversight of the work demanded from him , before plunging definitely into it , he was oppressed with a sense that the two years lying before him constituted a problem which would be harder to solve than any which had yet been set him . It seemed to him in a moment which was one of some slackness and reaction , that he had been growing too fast . He had been making friends besides in far too many camps , and the thought , half attractive , half repellent , of all those midnight discussions over smouldering fires , which Oxford was preparing for him , those fascinating moments of intellectual fence with minds as eager and as crude as his own , and of all the delightful dipping into the very latest literature , which such moments encouraged and involved , seemed to convey a sort of warning to the boy 's will that it was not equal to the situation . He was neither dull enough nor great enough for a striking Oxford success . How was he to prevent himself from attempting impossibilities and achieving a final mediocrity ? He felt a dismal certainty that he should never be able to control the strayings of will and curiosity , now into this path , now into that ; and a still stronger and genuine certainty that it is not by such digression that a man gets up the Ethics or the Annals . Langham watched him with a half irritable attention . In spite of the paralysis of all natural ambitions in himself , he was illogically keen that Elsmere should win the distinctions of the place . He , the most laborious , the most disinterested of scholars , turned himself almost into a crammer for Elsmere 's benefit . He abused the lad 's multifarious reading , declared it was no better than dram - drinking , and even preached to him an ingenious variety of mechanical aids to memory and short cuts to knowledge , till Robert would turn round upon him with some triumphant retort drawn from his own utterances at some sincerer and less discreet moment . In vain . Langham felt a dismal certainty before many weeks were over that Elsmere would miss his first in Greats . He was too curious , too restless , too passionate about many things . Above all he was beginning , in the tutor 's opinion , to concern himself disastrously early with that most overwhelming and most brain - confusing of all human interests — the interest of religion . Grey had made him '
35077	35303	35304	35305	The Tories	1580	' with a vengeance . Elsmere was now attending Grey 's philosophical lectures , following them with enthusiasm , and making use of them , as so often happens , for the defence and fortification of views quite other than his teacher 's . The whole basis of Grey 's thought was ardently idealist and Hegelian . He had broken with the popular Christianity , but for him , God , consciousness , duty , were the only realities . None of the various forms of materialist thought escaped his challenge ; no genuine utterance of the spiritual life of man but was sure of his sympathy . It was known that after having prepared himself for the Christian ministry he had remained a layman because it had become impossible to him to accept miracle ; and it was evident that the commoner type of Churchmen regarded him as an antagonist all the more dangerous because he was so sympathetic . But the negative and critical side of him was what in reality told least upon his pupils . He was reserved , he talked with difficulty , and his respect for the immaturity of the young lives near him was complete . So that what he sowed others often reaped , or to quote the expression of a well - known rationalist about him : '
35316	35674	35304	35305	The Tories	1580	' Elsmere , for instance , took in all that Grey had to give , drank in all the ideal fervour , the spiritual enthusiasm of the great tutor , and then , as Grey himself would have done some twenty years earlier , carried his religious passion so stimulated into the service of the great positive tradition around him . And at that particular moment in Oxford history , the passage from philosophic idealism to glad acquiescence in the received Christian system , was a peculiarly easy one . It was the most natural thing in the world that a young man of Elsmere 's temperament should rally to the Church . The place was passing through one of those periodical crises of reaction against an overdriven rationalism , which show themselves with tolerable regularity in any great centre of intellectual activity . It had begun to be recognised with a great burst of enthusiasm and astonishment , that , after all , Mill and Herbert Spencer had not said the last word on all things in heaven and earth . And now there was exaggerated recoil . A fresh wave of religious romanticism was fast gathering strength ; the spirit of Newman had reappeared in the place which Newman had loved and left ; religion was becoming once more popular among the most trivial souls , and a deep reality among a large proportion of the nobler ones . With this movement of opinion Robert had very soon found himself in close and sympathetic contact . The meagre impression left upon his boyhood by the somewhat grotesque succession of the Harden curates , and by his mothers shafts of wit at their expense , was soon driven out of him by the stateliness and comely beauty of the Church order as it was revealed to him at Oxford . The religious air , the solemn beauty of the place itself , its innumerable associations with an organised and venerable faith , the great public functions and expressions of that faith , possessed the boy 's imagination more and more . As he sat in the undergraduates '
36229	36250	36251	36251	Robert	359	' Come with me for a walk , Elsmere ; you look as if some air would do you good . '
36270	36279	36281	36282	the youth	9147	' I have done for myself , sir , '
36293	36319	36281	36282	the youth	9147	' It seems to me to - day that I had neither mind nor memory . If I get a second I shall be lucky . '
36320	36331	36333	36334	Mr. Grey	399	' Oh , you will get your second whatever happens , '
36337	36357	36333	36334	Mr. Grey	399	' and you must n't be too much cast down about it if you do n't get your first . '
36411	36421	36422	36422	he	359	' I have been wasting my time here lately , '
36450	36453	36455	36456	Mr. Grey	399	' No , '
36466	36542	36544	36545	the speaker	920	' As far as general training goes , you have not wasted your time at all . There are many clever men who do n't get a first class , and yet it is good for them to be here — so long as they are not loungers and idlers , of course . And you have not been a lounger ; you have been headstrong , and a little over - confident , perhaps , '
36595	36660	36580	36580	Elsmere	359	' The young man was deeply touched . This tone of personal comment and admonition was very rare with Mr. Grey . He felt a sudden consciousness of a shared burden which was infinitely soothing , and though he made no answer , his face lost something of its harassed look as the two walked on together down Oriel Street and into Merton Meadows . '
36667	36700	36580	36580	Elsmere	359	' said Mr. Grey , as they turned into the Broad Walk , now in the full leafage of June , and rustling under a brisk western wind blowing from the river . '
36741	36742	36743	36743	You	920	' '
36748	36749	36743	36743	You	920	' '
36771	36798	36799	36799	You	920	' Mr. Grey said nothing for a while , and they strolled in and out of the great shadows thrown by the elms across their path . '
36807	36821	36799	36799	You	920	' he asked at last , with a certain quick brusqueness of manner . '
36824	36829	36799	36799	You	920	' said Robert eagerly . '
36837	36846	36799	36799	You	920	' he added , with a sudden humility , '
36880	36924	36925	36925	You	920	' The young voice speaking with hesitation and reserve , and yet with a deep inner conviction , was pleasant to hear . Mr. Grey turned towards it , and the great eyes under the furrowed brow had a peculiar gentleness of expression . '
36935	36939	36925	36925	You	920	' he said . '
36948	37087	36925	36925	You	920	' But through all the sympathy of the tone Robert was conscious of a veil between them . He knew , of course , pretty much what it was , and with a sudden impulse he felt that he would have given worlds to break through it and talk frankly with this man whom he revered beyond all others , wide as was the intellectual difference between them . But the tutor 's reticence and the younger man 's respect prevented it . When the unlucky second class was actually proclaimed to the world , Langham took it to heart perhaps more than either Elsmere or his mother . No one knew better than he what Elsmere 's gifts were . It was absurd that he should not have made more of them in sight of the public . '
37094	37219	36925	36925	You	920	' was about the gist of Langham 's mood during the days that followed on the class list . Elsmere , however , did not divulge his intention of taking orders to him till ten days afterwards , when he had carried off Langham to stay at Harden , and he and his old tutor were smoking in his mother 's little garden one moonlit night . When he had finished his statement Langham stood still a moment watching the wreaths of smoke as they curled and vanished . The curious interest in Elsmere 's career , which during a certain number of months had made him almost practical , almost energetic , had disappeared . He was his own languid , paradoxical self . '
37225	37234	36925	36925	You	920	' he said at last , very slowly , '
37254	37255	37242	37242	One	917	' '
37264	37268	37258	37258	you	1614	' cried Robert hotly .
37269	37278	37280	37280	Langham	464	' Simply ideas , or experiences , personified , '
37285	37299	37280	37280	Langham	464	' I take it they are the subject - matter of all theologies . '
37300	37307	37309	37309	Robert	359	' I do n't understand you , '
37313	37359	37309	37309	Robert	359	' To the Christian , facts have been the medium by which ideas the world could not otherwise have come at have been communicated to man . Christian theology is a system of ideas indeed , but of ideas realised , made manifest in facts . '
37382	37391	37392	37392	he	464	' How do you know they are facts ? '
37543	37552	37564	37564	sceptics	1622	' He imagines he has satisfied his intellect , '
37566	37585	37564	37564	sceptics	1622	' and he has never so much as exerted it . What a brute I am to protest ! '
37628	37685	37609	37609	his	1535	' No use to discuss it further . You have a strong case , of course , and you have put it well . Only , when you are pegging away at reforming and enlightening the world , do n't trample too much on the people who have more than enough to do to enlighten themselves . '
37826	37844	37845	37845	she	1624	' I suppose , then , Robert , we shall be back at Murewell before very long , '
37888	37891	37893	37893	Elsmere	359	' Mother , '
37896	37947	37893	37893	Elsmere	359	' what do you take me for ? Do you imagine I am going to bury myself in the country at five or six - and - twenty , take six hundred a year , and nothing to do for it ? That would be a deserter 's act indeed . '
37954	37986	37951	37951	her	1624	' Oh , I supposed you would insist on killing yourself , to begin with . To most people nowadays that seems to be the necessary preliminary of a useful career . '
38045	38057	38058	38058	he	359	' Do what you like with it when it falls vacant , '
38061	38128	38058	38058	he	359	' without reference to me . My views are strong that before a clergyman in health and strength , and in no immediate want of money , allows himself the luxury of a country parish , he is bound , for some years at any rate , to meet the challenge of evil and poverty where the fight is hardest — among our English town population . '
38308	38316	38317	38317	Grey	399	' Stay here a year or two , '
38321	38372	38317	38317	Grey	399	' you are at the beginning of your best learning time , and you are not one of the natures who can do without books . You will be all the better worth having afterwards , and there is no lack of work here for a man 's moral energies . '
39221	39229	39231	39233	the Liberal tutor	1676	' You overdrive your scruples , Elsmere , '
39237	39290	39231	39233	the Liberal tutor	1676	' No one can say a living with 1200 souls , and no curate , is a sinecure . As for hard town work , it is absurd — you could n't stand it . And after all , I imagine , there are some souls worth saving out of the towns . '
39342	39350	39351	39351	he	399	' After all , my dear fellow , '
39363	39374	39351	39351	he	399	' it is well even for reformers to be sane . '
39553	39556	39557	39557	he	359	' Mother , '
39574	39582	39557	39557	he	359	' can you be happy at Murewell ? '
39610	39619	39620	39620	she	8417	' I can be happy wherever you are , '
39633	39750	39620	39620	she	8417	' Then give me pen and paper and let me write to Mowbray . I wonder whether the place has changed at all . Heigh ho ! How is one to preach to people who have stuffed you up with gooseberries , or swung you on gates , or lifted you over puddles to save your petticoats ? I wonder what has become of that boy whom I hit in the eye with my bow and arrow , or of that other lout who pummelled me into the middle of next week for disturbing his bird - trap ? By the way , is the Squire — is Roger Wendover — living at the Hall now ? '
39763	39768	39770	39771	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' So I hear , '
39774	39784	39785	39785	He	359	' He wo n't be much good to you . '
39981	39994	39996	39996	Rose	369	' Agnes , if you want any tea , here it is , '
40008	40013	39996	39996	Rose	369	' and tell mamma . '
40262	40271	40273	40273	Rose	369	' Chattie , you fiend , come here ! '
40282	40299	40273	40273	Rose	369	' if Miss Barks were ever pretty she must have looked like you at this moment . '
40300	40309	40311	40311	Agnes	306	' I wo n't have Chattie put upon , '
40326	40350	40311	40311	Agnes	306	' she has done you no harm . Come to me , beastie . I wo n't compare you to disagreeable old maids . '
40381	40387	40389	40389	Rose	369	' Nothing but cupboard love , '
40399	40484	40389	40389	Rose	369	' she knows you will give her bread and butter and I wo n't , out of a double regard for my skirts and her morals . Oh , dear me ! Miss Barks was quite seraphic last night ; she never made a single remark about my clothes , and she did n't even say to me as she generally does , with an air of compassion , that she " quite understands how hard it must be to keep in tune . " '
40485	40496	40498	40498	Agnes	306	' The amusing thing was Mrs. Seaton and Mr. Elsmere , '
40500	40532	40498	40498	Agnes	306	' I just love , as Mrs. Thornburgh says , to hear her instructing other people in their own particular trades . She did n't get much change out of him . '
40566	40576	40389	40389	Rose	369	' My heart is whole . How is yours ? '
40577	40580	40582	40582	Agnes	306	' Intact , '
40585	40612	40582	40582	Agnes	306	' as that French bric - à - brac man in the Brompton Road used to say of his pots . But he is very nice . '
40613	40722	40723	40723	She	1715	' Oh , charming ! But when my destiny arrives'—and Rose , returning to her tea , swept her little hand with a teaspoon in it eloquently round—'he wo n't have his hair cut close . I must have luxuriant locks , and I will take no excuse ! Une chevelure de poète , the eye of an eagle , the moustache of a hero , the hand of a Rubinstein , and , if it pleases him , the temper of a fiend . He will be odious , insufferable for all the world besides , except for me ; and for me he will be heaven . '
40747	40751	40753	40753	Agnes	306	' No doubt , '
40756	40794	40753	40753	Agnes	306	' But you ca n't wonder if under the circumstances I do n't pine for a brother - in - law . To return to the subject , however , Catherine liked him . She said so . '
40795	40803	40805	40805	Rose	369	' Oh , that does n't count , '
40808	40823	40805	40805	Rose	369	' Catherine likes everybody — of a certain sort — and everybody likes Catherine . '
40824	40832	40834	40835	her sister	921	' Does that mean , Miss Hasty , '
40837	40850	40834	40835	her sister	921	' that you have made up your mind Catherine will never marry ? '
40851	40854	40856	40856	Rose	369	' Marry ! '
40858	40869	40856	40856	Rose	369	' You might as well talk of marrying Westminster Abbey . '
40886	40890	40891	40891	she	306	' After all , '
40895	40900	40891	40891	she	306	' St. Elizabeth married . '
40901	40946	40948	40948	Rose	369	' Yes , but then she was a princess . Reasons of State . If Catherine were " her Royal Highness " it would be her duty to marry , which would just make all the difference . Duty ! I hate the word . '
40996	41006	40990	40990	Agnes	306	' What 's the matter with you , Rose ? '
41007	41015	41017	41017	Rose	369	' The usual thing , my dear , '
41020	41149	41017	41017	Rose	369	' only more so . I had a letter this morning from Carry Ford — the daughter , you know , of those nice people I stayed in Manchester with last year . Well , she wants me to go and stay the winter with them and study under a first - rate man , Franzen , who is to be in Manchester two days a week during the winter . I have n't said a word about it — what 's the use ? I know all Catherine 's arguments by heart . Manchester is not Whindale , and papa wished us to live in Whindale ; I am not somebody else and need n't earn my bread ; and art is not religion ; and — — '
41150	41153	41155	41155	Agnes	306	' Wheels ! '
41157	41167	41155	41155	Agnes	306	' Catherine , I suppose , home from Whinborough . '
41191	41251	41168	41168	Rose	369	' Catherine , and an unknown . Catherine driving at a foot 's pace , and the unknown walking beside her . Oh , I see , of course — Mr. Elsmere . He will come in to tea , so I 'll go for a cup . It is his duty to call on us to - day . '
41303	41314	41315	41315	she	958	' After all , she is as handsome as Rose , '
41326	41377	41315	41315	she	958	' Rose , who was always tea - maker , dispensed her wares ; Catherine took her favourite low seat beside her mother , clasping Mrs. Leyburn 's thin mittened hand awhile tenderly in her own ; Robert and Agnes set up a lively gossip on the subject of the Thornburghs '
41459	41475	41455	41455	she	369	' Is all well ? have you had a good time this afternoon , Röschen ? '
41580	41587	41589	41589	Rose	369	' I do n't acknowledge him , '
41593	41613	41589	41589	Rose	369	' Other people 's godfathers give them mugs and corals . Mine never gave me anything but a Concordance . '
42117	42128	42111	42112	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Did you say he was a canon of somewhere ? '
42129	42133	42135	42135	Robert	359	' Oh no , '
42139	42146	42135	42135	Robert	359	' he is not a clergyman . '
42147	42154	42156	42156	Agnes	306	' But you said he preached , '
42158	42182	42156	42156	Agnes	306	' Yes — but lay sermons — addresses . He is not one of us even , according to your standard and mine . '
42183	42187	42189	42190	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' A Nonconformist ? '
42192	42204	42189	42190	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Oh , I know they have let in everybody now . '
42205	42212	42214	42214	Robert	359	' Well , if you like , '
42216	42245	42246	42246	He	359	' What I meant was that his opinions are not orthodox . He could not be a clergyman , but he is one of the noblest of men ! '
42295	42384	42289	42289	She	1759	' Mother , do you know , I have all sorts of messages from Aunt Ellen'—and in an under - voice she began to give Mrs. Leyburn the news of her afternoon expedition . Rose and Agnes soon plunged young Elsmere into another stream of talk . But he kept his feeling of perplexity . His experience of other women seemed to give him nothing to go upon with regard to Miss Leyburn . Presently Catherine got up and drew her plain little black cape round her again . '
42388	42393	42289	42289	She	1759	' remonstrated Mrs. Leyburn . '
42401	42402	42289	42289	She	1759	' '
42409	42417	42407	42407	mother	8451	' she said in a low voice ; '
42433	42442	42427	42427	I	0	' Mrs. Leyburn said no more . Catherine 's '
42444	42463	42464	42464	I	0	' were never disputed . She moved towards Elsmere with outstretched hand . But he also sprang up . '
42472	42476	42464	42464	I	0	' he said ; '
42503	42612	42613	42613	You	1765	' She stood quietly waiting while he made his farewells . Agnes , whose eye fell on her sister during the pause , was struck with a passing sense of something out of the common . She could hardly have defined her impression , but Catherine seemed more alive to the outer world , more like other people , less nun - like , than usual . When they had left the garden together , as they had come into it , and Mrs. Leyburn , complaining of chilliness , had retreated to the drawing - room , Rose laid a quick hand on her sister 's arm . '
42634	42635	42630	42630	he	399	' '
42638	42648	42630	42630	he	399	' said Agnes calmly,—'well , I await your remarks . '
42649	42750	42751	42751	You	1767	' Poor fellow ! said Rose grimly , and removed her hand . Meanwhile Elsmere and Catherine walked along the valley road towards the Vicarage . He thought , uneasily , she was a little more reserved with him than she had been in those pleasant moments after he had overtaken her in the pony - carriage ; but still she was always kind , always courteous . And what a white hand it was , hanging ungloved against her dress ! what a beautiful dignity and freedom , as of mountain winds and mountain streams , in every movement ! '
42758	42796	42797	42797	He	1768	' he said to her as they neared the vicarage gate . Is it not a long way for you ? You have been at a meeting already , your sister said , and teaching this morning ! '
42863	42873	42874	42874	she	1767	' It is most unfeminine , I am afraid , '
42877	42888	42874	42874	she	1767	' but I could n't be tired if I tried . '
42894	42907	42908	42908	he	1768	' You make me feel myself more than ever a shocking example , '
43084	43095	43097	43097	Robert	359	' Miss Leyburn seems to have very strong religious views , '
43120	43130	43132	43133	the vicar	1019	' Ah , she is her father 's daughter , '
43177	43193	43834	43835	the vicar	1019	' Richard Leyburn was a fanatic — as mild as you please , but immovable . '
43194	43198	43132	43133	the vicar	1019	' What line ? '
43199	43361	43132	43133	the vicar	1019	' Evangelical , with a dash of Quakerism . He lent me Madame Guyon 's Life once to read . I did n't appreciate it . I told him that for all her religion she seemed to me to have a deal of the vixen in her . He could hardly get over it : it nearly broke our friendship . But I suppose he was very like her , except that , in my opinion , his nature was sweeter . He was a fatalist — saw leadings of Providence in every little thing . And such a dreamer ! When he came to live up here just before his death , and all his active life was taken off him , I believe half his time he was seeing visions . He used to wander over the fells and meet you with a start , as though you belonged to another world than the one he was walking in . '
43362	43372	43834	43835	the vicar	1019	' And his eldest daughter was much with him ? '
43373	43544	43132	43133	the vicar	1019	' The apple of his eye . She understood him . He could talk his soul out to her . The others , of course , were children ; and his wife — well , his wife was just what you see her now , poor thing . He must have married her when she was very young and very pretty . She was a squire 's daughter somewhere near the school of which he was master — a good family , I believe — she'll tell you so , in a ladylike way . He was always fidgety about her health . He loved her , I suppose , or had loved her . But it was Catherine who had his mind ; Catherine who was his friend . She adored him . I believe there was always a sort of pity in her heart for him too . But at any rate he made her and trained her . He poured all his ideas and convictions into her . '
43545	43550	43132	43133	the vicar	1019	' Which were strong ? '
43551	43832	43834	43835	the vicar	1019	' Uncommonly . For all his gentle , ethereal look , you could neither bend nor break him . I do n't believe anybody but Richard Leyburn could have gone through Oxford at the height of the Oxford Movement , and , so to speak , have known nothing about it , while living all the time for religion . He had a great deal in common with the Quakers , as I said ; a great deal in common with the Wesleyans ; but he was very loyal to the Church all the same . He regarded it as the golden mean . George Herbert was his favourite poet . He used to carry his poems about with him on the mountains , and an expurgated Christian Year — the only thing he ever took from the High Churchmen — which he had made for himself , and which he and Catherine knew by heart . In some ways he was not a bigot at all . He would have had the Church make peace with the Dissenters ; he was all for upsetting tests so far as Nonconformity was concerned . But he drew the most rigid line between belief and unbelief . He would not have dined at the same table with a Unitarian if he could have helped it . I remember a furious article of his in the Record against admitting Unitarians to the Universities or allowing them to sit in Parliament . England is a Christian State , he said ; they are not Christians ; they have no right in her except on sufferance . Well , I suppose he was about right , '
43840	43850	43834	43835	the vicar	1019	' We are all so half - hearted nowadays . '
43851	43855	43857	43857	Robert	357	' Not he , '
43860	43898	43857	43857	Robert	357	' Who are we that because a man differs from us in opinion we are to shut him out from the education of political and civil duty ? But never mind , Cousin William . Go on . '
43899	44057	43834	43835	the vicar	1019	' There 's no more that I remember , except that of course Catherine took all these ideas from him . He would n't let his children know any unbeliever , however apparently worthy and good . He impressed it upon them as their special sacred duty , in a time of wicked enmity to religion , to cherish the faith and the whole faith . He wished his wife and daughters to live on here after his death that they might be less in danger spiritually than in the big world , and that they might have more opportunity of living the old - fashioned Christian life . There was also some mystical idea , I think , of making up through his children for the godless lives of their forefathers . He used to reproach himself for having in his prosperous days neglected his family , some of whom he might have helped to raise . '
44058	44063	44065	44065	Robert	357	' Well , but , '
44067	44088	44065	44065	Robert	357	' all very well for Miss Leyburn , but I do n't see the father in the two younger girls . '
44089	44098	44100	44101	the vicar	1019	' Ah , there is Catherine 's difficulty , '
44107	44223	44100	44101	the vicar	1019	' Poor thing ! How well I remember her after her father 's death ! She came down to see me in the dining - room about some arrangement for the funeral . She was only sixteen , so pale and thin with nursing . I said something about the comfort she had been to her father . She took my hand and burst into tears . " He was so good ! " she said ; " I loved him so ! Oh , Mr. Thornburgh , help me to look after the others ! " And that 's been her one thought since then — that , next to following the narrow road . '
44293	44308	44310	44310	Robert	357	' I should like to know the secret of the little musician 's independence , '
44314	44337	44310	44310	Robert	357	' There might be no tie of blood at all between her and the elder , so far as I can see . '
44338	44387	44445	44446	Richard Leyburn	364	' Oh , I do n't know that ! There 's more than you think , or Catherine would n't have kept her hold over her so far as she has . Generally she gets her way , except about the music . There Rose sticks to it . '
44388	44395	44310	44310	Robert	357	' And why should n't she ? '
44396	44415	44310	44310	Robert	357	' Ah , well , you see , my dear fellow , I am old enough , and you 're
44632	44633	44634	44634	She	369	' '
44648	44649	44644	44644	she	369	' '
44826	44827	44819	44819	she	369	' '
44837	44945	44828	44828	She	369	' said Robert . The vicar looked at him sharply , but the young man 's critical and meditative look reassured him . The next day , just before early dinner , Rose and Agnes , who had been for a walk , were startled , as they were turning into their own gate , by the frantic waving of a white handkerchief from the vicarage garden . It was Mrs. Thornburgh 's accepted way of calling the attention of the Burwood inmates , and the girls walked on . They found the good lady waiting for them in the drive in a characteristic glow and flutter . '
45026	45071	45022	45023	my dears	1804	' The vicar 's wife paused . Her square short figure was between the two girls ; she had on arm of each , and she looked significantly from one to another , her gray curls flapping across her face as she did so . '
45078	45082	45075	45076	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' cried Rose . '
45089	45090	45083	45083	You	448	' '
45098	45103	45093	45093	you	448	' she inquired solemnly . '
45107	45147	45093	45093	you	448	' said both in chorus . Mrs. Thornburgh surveyed Rose 's smiling frankness with a little sigh . Things were going grandly , but she could imagine a disposition of affairs which would have given her personally more pleasure . '
45165	45210	45093	45093	you	448	' she inquired , beginning in a whisper , with slow emphasis , patting Rose 's arm , and bringing out the last words with a rush . Agnes caught the twinkle in Rose 's eye , but she answered for them both demurely . '
45225	45226	45221	45221	you	448	' '
45229	45234	45235	45235	I	0	' cried Mrs. Thornburgh . '
45301	45335	45336	45336	He	313	' Mrs. Thornburgh had not seen it with two eyes , as we know , till it was pointed out to her ; but her imagination worked with equal liveliness backwards or forwards . '
45457	45505	45538	45538	Catherine	358	' Mrs. Thornburgh stopped , choked almost by her own eloquence . The girls , who had by this time established her between them on a garden - seat , looked at her with smiling composure . They were accustomed to letting her have her budget out . '
45512	45527	45538	45538	Catherine	358	' she resumed , taking breath , and chilled a little by their silence , '
45540	45558	45533	45533	I	0	' She regarded them with anxious interrogation . Rose , still smiling , slowly shook her head . '
45561	45572	45533	45533	I	0	' cried Mrs. Thornburgh ; then , with charming inconsistency , '
45584	45584	45575	45575	you	1822	'
45585	45591	45593	45593	Agnes	306	' That 's just it , '
45597	45627	45593	45593	Agnes	306	' we ca n't know anything in two days . No one ever will know anything about Catherine , if she takes to anybody , till the last minute . '
45634	45646	45647	45647	she	306	' It 's very difficult when people will be so reserved , '
45666	45676	45677	45677	she	306	' At any rate we can bring them together , '
45684	45706	45677	45677	she	306	' We can have picnics , you know , and teas , and all that — and watch . Now listen . '
45735	45778	45727	45727	her	306	' breath away . Rose bit her lip to keep in her laughter . Agnes with vast self - possession took Mrs. Thornburgh in hand . She pointed out firmly that nothing would be so likely to make Catherine impracticable as fuss . '
45786	45804	45727	45727	her	306	' etc . She preached from the text with a worldly wisdom which quickly crushed Mrs. Thornburgh . '
45816	45823	45727	45727	her	306	' she said at last helplessly . '
45843	45958	45964	45965	the family	1222	' Mrs. Thornburgh spent her life between a condition of effervescence and a condition of feeling the world too much for her . Rose and Agnes , having now reduced her to the latter state , proceeded cautiously to give her her head again . They promised her two or three expeditions and one picnic at least ; they said they would do their best ; they promised they would report what they saw and be very discreet , both feeling the comedy of Mrs. Thornburgh as the advocate of discretion ; and then they departed to their early dinner , leaving the vicars wife decidedly less self - confident than they found her . '
45967	45975	45964	45965	the family	1222	' cried Agnes as they walked home . '
45989	45990	45982	45984	the Miss Leyburns	324	' '
45997	46002	45982	45984	the Miss Leyburns	324	' Rose replied decisively . '
46059	46291	46052	46052	I	0	' Agnes made no answer . She was never so positive as Rose , and on the whole did not find herself the worse for it in life . Besides , she understood that there was a soreness at the bottom of Rose 's heart that was always showing itself in unexpected connections . There was no necessity , indeed , for elaborate schemes for assisting Providence . Mrs. Thornburgh had her picnics and her expeditions , but without them Robert Elsmere would have been still man enough to see Catherine Leyburn every day . He loitered about the roads along which she must needs pass to do her many offices of charity ; he offered the vicar to take a class in the school , and was naïvely exultant that the vicar curiously happened to fix an hour when he must needs see Miss Leyburn going or coming on the same errand ; he dropped into Burwood on any conceivable pretext , till Rose and Agnes lost all inconvenient respect for his cloth and Mrs. Leyburn sent him on errands ; and he even insisted that Catherine and the vicar should make use of him and his pastoral services in one or two of the cases of sickness or poverty under their care . Catherine , with a little more reserve than usual , took him one day to the Tysons '
48008	48015	48016	48016	she	358	' I am grateful to you , '
48025	48033	48016	48016	she	358	' I am very grateful to you ! '
48277	48288	48261	48261	she	358	' Very pleased indeed to make your acquaintance , sir , '
48481	48493	48496	48496	her	1909	' Oh , his success at Colesbridge has been somethin' marvellous , '
48505	48509	48496	48496	her	1909	' some - thin '

48692	48739	48689	48689	his	1465	' And while Rose turned away to a far window to hide an almost hysterical inclination to laugh , Mrs. Fleming opened her bag , took out a treasured paper , and read with the emphasis and the unction peculiar to a certain type of revivalism — '
48861	48880	48883	48885	your true minister	1924	' A dead silence . Mrs. Fleming folded up the letter and put it back into her bag . '
48887	48902	48883	48885	your true minister	1924	' she said , with a large judicial utterance as she closed the snap . '
48911	48927	48909	48909	souls	1914	' And she threw a swift searching look at the young clergyman in the window . '
48941	48965	48928	48928	He	1918	' said Catherine gently . Somehow , as soon as she spoke , Elsmere saw the whole odd little scene with other eyes . '
48971	48975	48977	48978	the mother	964	' him out , '
48981	49055	49056	49056	she	964	' but a minister does n't think of that . Wherever he goes there are sinners saved . He stayed last week at a house near Nuneaton . At family prayer alone there were five saved . And at the prayer - meetin 's on the Sabbath such outpourin 's of the Spirit ! Edward comes home , his wife tells me , just ready to drop . Are you acquainted , sir , '
49073	49082	49056	49056	she	964	' with the labours of our Wesleyan ministers ? '
49083	49086	49088	49088	Robert	359	' No , '
49095	49114	49088	49088	Robert	359	' not personally . But I have the greatest respect for them as a body of devoted men . '
49145	49147	49139	49139	Catherine	399	' You 're

49178	49191	49175	49176	Aunt Ellen	433	' said Catherine , while a sudden light broke over her face ; '
49217	49242	49243	49243	I	0	' And she laid her hand on her aunt 's knee with a smile in which there was the slightest touch of affectionate satire . '

49650	49655	49636	49644	the watcher on the other side of the room	1939	' I was n't thinkin '
49658	49665	49667	49668	Mrs. Fleming	430	' the Lord down to ministers , '

50358	50409	50338	50338	she	306	' Then raising her head she swept her eyes round the sky . The wind was freshening , the clouds were coming up fast from the westward ; over the summit of High Fell and the crags on either side , a gray straight - edged curtain was already lowering . '
50417	50421	50338	50338	she	306	' she thought , '
50441	50727	50338	50338	she	306	' And she walked on homewards meditating , her thin fingers clasped before her , the wind blowing her skirts , the blue ribbons on her hat , the little gold curls on her temples , in a pretty many - coloured turmoil about her . When she got to Burwood she shut herself into the room which was peculiarly hers , the room which had been a stable . Now it was full of artistic odds and ends — her fiddle , of course , and piles of music , her violin stand , a few deal tables and cane chairs beautified by a number of chiffons , bits of Liberty stuffs with the edges still ragged , or cheap morsels of Syrian embroidery . On the tables stood photographs of musicians and friends — the spoils of her visits to Manchester , and of two visits to London which gleamed like golden points in the girl 's memory . The plastered walls were covered with an odd medley . Here was a round mirror , of which Rose was enormously proud . She had extracted it from a farmhouse of the neighbourhood , and paid for it with her own money . There a group of unfinished headlong sketches of the most fiercely impressionist description — the work and the gift of a knot of Manchester artists , who had fêted and flattered the beautiful little Westmoreland girl , when she was staying among them , to her heart 's content . Manchester , almost alone among our great towns of the present day , has not only a musical , but a pictorial life of its own ; its young artists dub themselves '
50731	51102	50338	50338	she	306	' study in Paris , and when they come home scout the Academy and its methods , and pine to set up a rival art - centre , skilled in all the methods of the Salon , in the murky north . Rose 's uncle , originally a clerk in a warehouse , and a rough diamond enough , had more or less moved with the times , like his brother Richard ; at any rate he had grown rich , had married a decent wife , and was glad enough to befriend his dead brother 's children , who wanted nothing of him , and did their uncle a credit of which he was sensible , by their good manners and good looks . Music was the only point at which he touched the culture of the times , like so many business men ; but it pleased him also to pose as a patron of local art ; so that when Rose went to stay with her childless uncle and aunt , she found long - haired artists and fiery musicians about the place , who excited and encouraged her musical gift , who sketched her while she played , and talked to the pretty , clever , unformed creature of London and Paris and Italy , and set her pining for that golden vie de Bohème which she alone apparently of all artists was destined never to know . For she was an artist — she would be an artist — let Catherine say what she would ! She came back from Manchester restless for she knew not what , thirsty for the joys and emotions of art , determined to be free , reckless , passionate ; with Wagner and Brahms in her young blood ; and found Burwood waiting for her — Burwood , the lonely house in the lonely valley , of which Catherine was the presiding genius . Catherine ! For Rose , what a multitude of associations clustered round the name ! To her it meant everything at this moment against which her soul rebelled — the most scrupulous order , the most rigid self - repression , the most determined sacrificing of '
51108	51273	50338	50338	she	306	' with all its indefensible delights , to a cold other - world with its torturing inadmissible claims . Even in the midst of her stolen joys at Manchester or London , this mere name , the mere mental image of Catherine moving through life , wrapped in a religious peace and certainty as austere as they were beautiful , and asking of all about her the same absolute surrender to an awful Master she gave so easily herself , was enough to chill the wayward Rose , and fill her with a kind of restless despair . And at home , as the vicar said , the two sisters were always on the verge of conflict . Rose had enough of her father in her to suffer in resisting , but resist she must by the law of her nature . Now , as she threw off her walking things , she fell first upon her violin , and rushed through a Brahms 's '
51276	51361	50338	50338	she	306	' her eyes dancing , her whole light form thrilling with the joy of it ; and then with a sudden revulsion she stopped playing , and threw herself down listlessly by the open window . Close by against the wall was a little looking - glass , by which she often arranged her ruffled locks ; she glanced at it now , it showed her a brilliant face enough , but drooping lips , and eyes darkened with the extravagant melancholy of eighteen . '
51370	51376	51378	51378	I	0	' she said to herself , '
51429	51472	51473	51473	I	0	' And with a portentous sigh she dropped her chin on her hand . She was half acting , acting to herself . Life was not really quite unbearable , and she knew it . But it relieved her to overdo it . '
51481	51486	51473	51473	I	0	' she mused presently . '
51554	51592	51550	51550	she	1960	' She frowned and meditated , but got no light on the problem . Chattie jumped up on the window - sill , with her usual stealthy aplomb , and rubbed herself against the girl 's face . '
51597	51608	51550	51550	she	1960	' cried Rose , throwing her arms round the cat , '
51671	51730	51733	51733	Chattie	310	' And springing up she dragged in the cat , and snatching a scarlet anemone from a bunch on the table , stood opposite Chattie , who stood slowly waving her magnificent tail from side to side , and glaring as though it were not at all to her taste to be hustled and bustled in this way . '
51740	51752	51738	51738	she	1964	' A leaf of the flower dropped on Chattie 's nose . '
51808	51886	51887	51887	Rose	369	' And , snatching up her violin , the girl broke into a Strauss waltz , dancing to it the while , her cotton skirts flying , her pretty feet twinkling , till her eyes glowed , and her cheeks blazed with a double intoxication — the intoxication of movement , and the intoxication of sound — the cat meanwhile following her with little mincing perplexed steps , as though not knowing what to make of her . '
51892	51900	51887	51887	Rose	369	' cried Agnes , opening the door . '
51908	51918	51887	51887	Rose	369	' said Rose calmly , stopping to take breath . '
51935	52031	51927	51927	you	8398	' The weather held up in a gray grudging sort of way , and Mrs. Thornburgh especially was all for braving the clouds and going on with the expedition . It was galling to her that she herself would have to be driven to Shanmoor behind the fat vicarage pony , while the others would be climbing the fells , and all sorts of exciting things might be happening . Still it was infinitely better to be half in it than not in it at all , and she started by the side of the vicarage '
52033	52560	52630	52630	his	1967	' in a most delicious flutter . The skies might fall any day now . Elsmere had not confided in her , though she was unable to count the openings she had given him thereto . For one of the frankest of men he had kept his secret , so far as words went , with a remarkable tenacity . Probably the neighbourhood of Mrs. Thornburgh was enough to make the veriest chatterbox secretive . But notwithstanding , no one possessing the clue could live in the same house with him these June days without seeing that the whole man was absorbed , transformed , and that the crisis might be reached at any moment . Even the vicar was eager and watchful , and playing up to his wife in fine style , and if the situation had so worked on the vicar , Mrs. Thornburgh 's state is easier imagined than described . The walk to Shanmoor need not be chronicled . The party kept together . Robert fancied sometimes that there was a certain note of purpose in the way in which Catherine clung to the vicar . If so it did not disquiet him . Never had she been kinder , more gentle . Nay , as the walk went on a lovely gaiety broke through her tranquil manner , as though she , like the others , had caught exhilaration from the sharpened breeze and the towering mountains , restored to all their grandeur by the storm clouds . And yet she had started in some little inward trouble . She had promised to join this walk to Shanmoor , she had promised to go with the others on a picnic the following day , but her conscience was pricking her . Twice this last fortnight had she been forced to give up a night - school she held in a little lonely hamlet among the fells , because even she had been too tired to walk there and back after a day of physical exertion . Were not the world and the flesh encroaching ? She had been conscious of a strange inner restlessness as they all stood waiting in the road for the vicar and Elsmere . Agnes had thought her looking depressed and pale , and even dreamt for a moment of suggesting to her to stay at home . And then ten minutes after they had started it had all gone , her depression , blown away by the winds,—or charmed away by a happy voice , a manly presence , a keen responsive eye ? Elsmere , indeed , was gaiety itself . He kept up an incessant war with Rose ; he had a number of little jokes going at the vicar 's expense , which kept that good man in a half - protesting chuckle most of the way ; he cleared every gate that presented itself in first - rate Oxford form , and climbed every point of rock with a cat - like agility that set the girls scoffing at the pretence of invalidism under which he had foisted himself on Whindale . '
52569	52617	52630	52630	his	1967	' he cried , as they topped the ridge , and the Shanmoor valley lay before them , bounded on the other side by line after line of mountain , Wetherlam and the Pikes and Fairfield in the far distance , piled sombrely under a sombre sky . '
52637	52638	52627	52627	He	1967	' '
52646	52656	52627	52627	He	1967	' said Catherine , with a little mocking wonder . '
52663	52664	52630	52630	his	1967	' '
52671	52677	52630	52630	his	1967	' he said , laughing . '
52708	52781	52630	52630	his	1967	' She looked up , smiling , at his vehemence , taking it all as a tribute to the country , or to his own recovered health . He stood leaning on his stick , gazing , however , not at the view but at her . The others stood a little way off laughing and chatter ing . As their eyes met , a strange new pulse leapt up in Catherine . '
52789	52797	52798	52798	I	0	' she said , with a shiver . '
52807	52863	52864	52864	William	342	' And she hurried up to the others , nor did she leave their shelter till they were in sight of the little Shanmoor inn , where they were to have tea . The pony carriage was already standing in front of the inn , and Mrs. Thornburgh 's gray curls shaking at the window . '
52866	52870	52864	52864	William	342	' she shouted , '
52899	52902	52904	52905	the girls	973	' book ! '
53166	53203	53150	53150	Agnes	306	' book . The scrambling , chattering meal passed like a flash . At the beginning of it Mrs. Thornburgh 's small gray eyes had travelled restlessly from face to face , as though to say , '
53213	53454	53150	53150	Agnes	306	' As for Elsmere , though it seemed to him at the time one of the brightest moments of existence , he remembered little afterwards but the scene : the peculiar clean mustiness of the room only just opened for the summer season , a print of the Princess of Wales on the wall opposite him , a stuffed fox over the mantelpiece , Rose 's golden head and heavy amber necklace , and the figure at the vicar 's right , in a gown of a little dark blue check , the broad hat shading the white brow and luminous eyes . When tea was over they lounged out on the bridge . There was to be no long lingering , however . The clouds were deepening , the rain could not be far off . But if they started soon they could probably reach home before it came down . Elsmere and Rose hung over the gray stone parapet , mottled with the green and gold of innumerable mosses , and looked down through a fringe of English maidenhair growing along the coping , into the clear eddies of the stream . Suddenly he raised himself on one elbow , and , shading his eyes , looked to where the vicar and Catherine were standing in front of the inn , touched for an instant by a beam of fitful light slipping between two great rain - clouds . '
53465	53481	53483	53483	you	1994	' he said , the words breaking , as it were , from his lips . '
53488	53520	53483	53483	you	1994	' said Rose with an excellent pretence of innocence , detaching a little pebble and flinging it harmlessly at a water - wagtail balancing on a stone below . He flushed . '
53545	53546	53523	53523	You	1994	' '
53549	53553	53523	53523	You	1994	' thought Rose , '
53563	53642	53554	53554	she	1342	' But her girlish sympathy conquered her ; it was very exciting , and she liked Elsmere . She turned back to him , her face overspread with a quite irrepressible smile . He reddened still more , then they stared into each other 's eyes , and without a word more understood each other perfectly . Rose held out her hand to him with a little brusque bon camarade gesture . He pressed it warmly in his . '
53649	53653	53554	53554	she	1342	' he cried . '
53662	53698	53699	53699	You	2001	' She nodded , and drew her hand away just as Agnes and the vicar disturbed them . Meanwhile Catherine was standing by the side of the pony carriage , watching Mrs. Thornburgh 's preparations . '
53700	53710	53711	53711	she	1342	're sure you do n't mind driving home alone ? '
53718	53726	53711	53711	she	1342	' May n't I go with you ? '
53727	53776	53794	53794	She	1342	' My dear , certainly not ! As if I was n't accustomed to going about alone at my time of life ! No , no , my dear , you go and have your walk ; you 'll get home before the rain . Ready , James . '
53838	53850	53852	53853	the vicar	1019	' Now , then , right about face and quick march ! '
53855	53877	53852	53853	the vicar	1019	' We 've got to race that cloud over the Pike . It 'll be up with us in no time . '
53959	53965	53966	53966	he	1019	' You have crushed me , '
53983	54019	53966	53966	he	1019	' but it is worth while to be crushed by any one who can give so much ground for their knowledge . How you do know your mountains — from their peasants to their plants ! '
54020	54037	54038	54038	she	1342	' I have had more than ten able - bodied years living and scrambling among them , '
54043	54057	54038	54038	she	1342	' Do you keep up all your visits and teaching in the winter ? '
54058	54092	54118	54118	his	1019	' Oh , not so much , of course ! But people must be helped and taught in the winter . And our winter is often not as hard as yours down south . '
54093	54110	54111	54111	he	1019	' Do you go on with that night - school in Poll Ghyll , for instance ? '
54128	54135	54136	54136	she	1342	' Rose has been telling tales , '
54139	54201	54136	54136	she	1342	' I wish she would leave my proceedings alone . Poll Ghyll is the family bone of contention at present . Yes , I go on with it . I always take a lantern when the night is dark , and I know every inch of the ground , and Bob is always with me ; are n't you , Bob ? '
54241	54254	54255	54255	he	438	' I like to fancy you with your lantern in the dark , '
54264	54307	54255	54255	he	438	' the night wind blowing about you , the black mountains to right and left of you , some little stream , perhaps , running beside you for company , your dog guarding you , and all good angels going with you . '
54321	54329	54330	54330	she	1342	' Do n't fancy it at all , '
54335	54363	54330	54330	she	1342	' It is a very small and very natural incident of one 's life here . Look back , Mr. Elsmere ; the rain has beaten us ! '
54490	54493	54495	54495	Elsmere	313	' Caught ! '
54504	54516	54517	54517	He	438	' Let me help you into your cloak , Miss Leyburn . '
54843	54853	54825	54828	some shaft from Rose	2026	' Miss Leyburn , what have you been doing ? '
54854	54861	54862	54862	she	369	' Rose had forgotten her cloak , '
54866	54888	54862	54862	she	369	' She has a very thin dress on , and she is the only one of us that takes cold easily . '
54889	54896	54897	54897	he	2027	' You must take my mackintosh , '
54908	54919	54902	54902	She	369	' As if I should do anything of the sort ! '
54920	54924	54925	54925	he	2027	' You must , '
54933	54964	54965	54965	He	2027	' Do you think that you are always to be allowed to go through the world taking thought of other people and allowing no one to take thought for you ? '
54972	55001	55002	55002	He	2027	' No , no ! This is absurd , Mr. Elsmere . You are not strong yet . And I have often told you that nothing hurts me . '
55010	55020	55002	55002	He	2027	' Very well , then , there it stays ! '
55038	55045	55046	55046	she	369	' Mr. Elsmere , be sensible ! '
55059	55074	55046	55046	she	369	' I should never forgive myself if you got a chill after your illness ! '
55075	55083	55084	55084	he	2027	' You will not be called upon , '
55096	55107	55109	55109	he	2027	' Men 's coats are made to keep out weather , '
55119	55141	55109	55109	he	2027	' Your dress — I ca n't help being disrespectful under the circumstances — will be wet through in ten minutes . '
55150	55156	55157	55157	he	2027	' Please , Miss Leyburn , '
55209	55217	55206	55206	he	2027	' Mr. Elsmere , you are ridiculous ! '
55249	55252	55247	55247	Wordsworth	325	' Louisa , '
55369	55374	55375	55375	he	2027	' What a change ! '
55387	55429	55375	55375	he	2027	' How impossible that it should have been only yesterday afternoon I was lounging up here in the heat , by the pool where the stream rises , watching the white butterflies on the turf , and reading " Laodamia " ! '
55430	55435	55436	55436	she	369	' " Laodamia " ! '
55447	55457	55436	55436	she	369	' Is it one of those you like best ? '

55478	55505	55462	55462	he	2027	' How superb it is — the roll , the majesty of it ; the severe chastened beauty of the main feeling , the individual lines ! '
55518	55528	55529	55529	she	369	' It was my father 's favourite of all , '
55540	55554	55529	55529	she	369	' He said the last verse to me the day before he died . '
55570	55579	55580	55580	he	2027	' Was he happy in his school life ? '
55584	55591	55580	55580	he	2027	' Was teaching what he liked ? '
55592	55598	55599	55599	Catherine	399	' Oh yes — only — '
55622	55686	55687	55687	She	2039	' I never knew anybody so good who thought himself of so little account .

And all the time he was the noblest , purest , most devoted — — '
55801	55808	55809	55809	he	2027	' Oh , I can understand ! '
55844	55850	55809	55809	he	2027	' Then his voice dropped . '

I die'—and memory caught still the piteous , long - drawn breath by which the voice was broken—'in much — much perplexity about many things . You have a clear soul , an iron will . Strengthen the others . Bring them safe to the day of account . '—'Yes
58111	58397	58107	58107	God	304	' That long - past dialogue is clear and sharp to her now , as though it were spoken afresh in her ears . And how has she kept her pledge ? She looks back humbly on her life of incessant devotion , on the tie of long dependence which has bound to her her weak and widowed mother , on her relations to her sisters , the efforts she has made to train them in the spirit of her father 's life and beliefs . Have those efforts reached their term ? Can it be said in any sense that her work is done , her promise kept ? Oh , no — no ! she cries to herself with vehemence . Her mother depends on her every day and hour for protection , comfort , enjoyment . The girls are at the opening of life,—Agnes twenty , Rose eighteen , with all experience to come . And Rose — — Ah ! at the thought of Rose , Catherine 's heart sinks deeper and deeper — she feels a culprit before her father 's memory . What is it has gone so desperately wrong with her training of the child ? Surely she has given love enough , anxious thought enough , and here is Rose only fighting to be free from the yoke of her father 's wishes , from the galling pressure of the family tradition ! No . Her task has just now reached its most difficult , its most critical , moment . How can she leave it ? Impossible . What claim can she put against these supreme claims — of her promise , her mother 's and sisters '
58721	58739	58805	58805	She	2127	' Man approacheth so much the nearer unto God the farther he departeth from all earthly comfort . '

58994	59065	58939	58939	she	358	' Then she fell thinking again , and she remembered their talk about Rose . How often she had pondered it since ! In this intense trance of feeling it breaks upon her finally that he is right . May it not be that he with his clearer thought , his wider knowledge of life , has laid his finger on the weak point in her guardianship of her sisters ? '
59074	59078	59125	59125	his	2136	' she thought , '
59141	59463	59500	59500	you	2137	' She bowed her face on her knees again . It seemed to her that she had thrown herself at Elsmere 's feet , that her cheek was pressed against that young brown hand of his . How long the moment lasted she never knew . When at last she rose stiff and weary , darkness was overtaking even the lingering northern twilight . The angry clouds had dropped lower on the moors ; a few sheep beside the glimmering stone trough showed dimly white ; the night wind was sighing through the untenanted valley and the scanty branches of the thorn . White mists lay along the hollow of the dale ; they moved weirdly under the breeze . She could have fancied them a troop of wraiths to whom she had flung her warm crushed heart , and who were bearing it away to burial . As she came slowly over the pass and down the Whindale side of the fell a clear purpose was in her mind . Agnes had talked to her only that morning of Rose and Rose 's desire , and she had received the news with her habitual silence . The house was lit up when she returned . Her mother had gone upstairs . Catherine went to her , but even Mrs. Leyburn discovered that she looked worn out , and she was sent off to bed . She went along the passage quickly to Rose 's room , listening a moment at the door . Yes , Rose was inside , crooning some German song , and apparently alone . She knocked and went in . Rose was sitting on the edge of her bed , a white dressing - gown over her shoulders , her hair in a glorious confusion all about her . She was swaying backwards and forwards dreamily singing , and she started up when she saw Catherine . '
59466	59499	59500	59500	you	2137	' said the elder sister , going up to her with a tremor of heart , and putting her motherly arms round the curly golden hair and the half - covered shoulders , '
59570	59622	59565	59565	I	0	' Rose , pushing herself away with one hand , stood staring . She was struck dumb by this sudden breaking down of Catherine 's long resistance . And what a strange white Catherine ! What did it mean ? Catherine withdrew her arms with a little sigh and moved away . '
59633	59637	59631	59631	Röschen	330	' she said , '
59648	59650	59683	59683	Cathie	358	' Catherine '
59653	59663	59664	59664	Cathie	358	' ! Rose thought the skies must be falling . '
59666	59680	59664	59664	Cathie	358	' she cried , leaping forward just as her sister gained the door . '
59711	59711	59713	59713	she	358	'
59734	59741	59742	59742	she	8460	' Let me go , Rose , '
59749	59758	59742	59742	she	8460	' Oh , you must let me go ! '
59782	59790	59764	59764	she	8460	' Good - night ! Sleep well . '
60029	60035	60036	60036	she	358	' It was not mine , '
60044	60049	60036	60036	she	358	' but God 's . '
60268	60274	60255	60256	the vicar	1019	' supposed they could go , '
60276	60286	60255	60256	the vicar	1019	' did n't see what good it would do them '
60462	60549	60456	60456	she	358	' meeting with a noise like the rattle of musketry . Whistling ! She would like to know what grounds he had for it , indeed ! She always knew — she always said , and she would go on saying — that Catherine Leyburn would die an old maid . Meanwhile Robert had strolled across to Burwood with the lightest heart . By way of keeping all his anticipations within the bounds of strict reason , he told himself that it was impossible he should see '
60551	60633	60456	60456	she	358	' in the morning . She was always busy in the morning . He approached the house as a Catholic might approach a shrine . That was her window , that upper casement with the little Banksia rose twining round it . One night , when he and the vicar had been out late on the hills , he had seen a light streaming from it across the valley , and had thought how the mistress of the maiden solitude within shone '
60639	60688	60456	60456	she	358	' In the drive he met Mrs. Leyburn , who was strolling about the garden . She at once informed him with much languid plaintiveness that Catherine had gone to Whinborough for the day , and would not be able to join the picnic . Elsmere stood still . '
60691	60695	60456	60456	she	358	' he cried . '
60705	60720	60702	60702	her	2159	' Mrs. Leyburn shrugged her shoulders . She too was evidently much put out . '
60802	60803	60804	60805	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' '
60807	60977	60978	60978	Sarah	314	' And not a word for him — for him to whom she had given her promise ? She had gone to Whinborough to avoid him , and she had gone in the brusquest way , that it might be unmistakable . The young man stood with his hands thrust into the pockets of his long coat , hearing with half an ear the remarks that Mrs. Leyburn was making to him about the picnic . Was the wretched thing to come off after all ? He was too proud and sore to suggest an alternative . But Mrs. Thornburgh managed that for him . When he got back , he told the vicar in the hall of Miss Leyburn 's flight in the fewest possible words , and then his long legs vanished up the stairs in a twinkling , and the door of his room shut behind him . A few minutes afterwards Mrs. Thornburgh 's shrill voice was heard in the hall calling to the servant . '
60990	61003	61004	61004	Elsmere	313	' And a minute after the vicar came up to his door . '
61020	61164	61006	61007	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' To which Elsmere from inside replied with a vigorous assent . The vicar slowly descended to tackle his spouse , who seemed to have established herself for the morning in his sanctum , though the parish accounts were clamouring to be done , and this morning in the week belonged to them by immemorial usage . But Mrs. Thornburgh was unmanageable . She sat opposite to him with one hand on each knee , solemnly demanding of him if he knew what was to be done with young women nowadays , because she did n't . The tormented vicar declined to be drawn into so illimitable a subject , recommended patience , declared that it might be all a mistake , and tried hard to absorb himself in the consideration of 2s . 8d . plus 2s . 11d . minus 9d . '
61171	61184	61166	61166	I	0	' said his wife to him at last , with withering sarcasm , '
61256	61267	61246	61246	you	342	' And she fixed him with a fiercely interrogative eye . '
61271	61278	61246	61246	you	342	' cried the vicar , roused ; '
61320	61337	61314	61314	you	342	' The vicar 's wife rose , the upturned corners of her mouth saying unutterable things . '
61344	61361	61314	61314	you	342	' she echoed in a tone which implied that her husband 's headpiece was past praying for .
61362	61371	61373	61374	the vicar	1019	' Yes , does n't care for him ! '
61378	61391	61373	61374	the vicar	1019	' What else should make her give him a snub like this ? '
61410	61418	61419	61419	she	448	' Oh , the Lord only knows ! '
61479	61482	61457	61457	she	448	' cussedness . '
61779	61783	61784	61784	she	369	' Poor fellow ! '
61830	61842	61784	61784	she	369	' I wonder whether he thinks he knows anything about Catherine . '
62025	62046	62048	62048	Rose	369	' Oh , of course it 's our salvation in this world and the next that 's in the way , '
62074	62095	62097	62100	this incorrigible young person—'I	2198	' I wish to goodness Catherine would n't think so much about mine , at any rate . I hate , '
62202	62233	62234	62234	Mamma	331	' It was getting uncomfortably serious all round , Rose admitted . But there was one element of comedy besides Mrs. Thornburgh , and that was Mrs. Leyburn 's unconsciousness . '
62239	62251	62252	62252	She	331	' thought the girl , with a little ripple of laughter . '
62282	62410	62269	62269	she	331	' Which was perfectly true . Mrs. Leyburn was too devoted to her daughters to feel any fidgety interest in their marrying . Of course the most eligible persons would be only too thankful to marry them when the moment came . Meanwhile her devotion was in no need of the confirming testimony of lovers . It was sufficient in itself , and kept her mind gently occupied from morning till night . If it had occurred to her to notice that Robert Elsmere had been paying special attentions to any one in the family , she would have suggested with perfect naïveté that it was herself . For he had been to her the very pink of courtesy and consideration , and she was of opinion that '
62415	62470	62412	62412	Richard	364	' of the degeneracy of Oxford men would have been modified could he have seen this particular specimen . Later on in the morning Rose had been out giving Bob a run , while Agnes drove with her mother . On the way home she overtook Elsmere returning from an errand for the vicar . '
62477	62490	62664	62664	Elsmere	313	' she said to him , laughing , pointing to the sky ; '
62497	62498	62664	62664	Elsmere	313	' '
62507	62592	62664	62664	Elsmere	313	' he said simply . His look of depression amazed her . She felt a quick movement of sympathy , a wild wish to bid him cheer up and fight it out . If she could just have shown him Catherine as she looked last night ! Why could n't she talk it out with him ? Absurd conventions ! She had half a mind to try . But the grave look of the man beside her deterred even her young half - childish audacity .
62593	62605	62606	62606	she	2204	' Catherine will have a good day for all her business , '
62640	62663	62664	62664	Elsmere	313	' I suppose she will spend the afternoon with Aunt Ellen . Mr. Elsmere , what did you think of Aunt Ellen ? '
62686	62692	62693	62693	he	2205	' A most estimable person , '
62696	62708	62693	62693	he	2205	' Are you on good terms with her , Miss Rose ? '
62709	62715	62716	62716	she	2204	' Oh dear , no ! '
62724	62726	62716	62716	she	2204	' I 'm
62788	62811	62783	62783	she	358	' She flashed a mischievous look at him , and thrilled as she caught the sudden change of expression in his face . '
62826	62836	62812	62813	Your sister	1342	' he said , evidently speaking with some difficulty . '
62848	62859	62860	62860	You	2204	' cried Rose , and then was silent a moment . '
62866	63145	63146	63146	She	2213	' she went on at last , obeying some inward impulse—'or perhaps you do n't know — that , at home , we are all Catherine 's creatures . She does exactly what she likes with us . When my father died she was sixteen , Agnes was ten , I was eight . We came here to live — we were not very rich of course , and mamma was n't strong . Well , she did everything : she taught us — we have scarcely had any teacher but her since then ; she did most of the housekeeping ; and you can see for yourself what she does for the neighbours and poor folk . She is never ill , she is never idle , she always knows her own mind . We owe everything we are , almost everything we have , to her . Her nursing has kept mamma alive through one or two illnesses . Our lawyer says he never knew any business affairs better managed than ours , and Catherine manages them . The one thing she never takes any care or thought for is herself . What we should do without her I ca n't imagine ; and yet sometimes I think if it goes on much longer none of us three will have any character of our own left . After all , you know , it may be good for the weak people to struggle on their own feet , if the strong would only believe it , instead of always being carried . The strong people need n't be always trampling on themselves,—if they only knew — — '
63349	63370	63371	63371	he	313	' You do n't hope to persuade me that your sister reckons you among the weak persons of the world ? '
64834	64844	64845	64845	he	313	' What are you made of , I wonder ! '
64849	64858	64845	64845	he	313	' Nothing , certainly , that minds weather . '
64859	64871	64872	64872	she	358	' No Westmoreland native thinks of staying at home for this , '
64963	64966	64967	64967	he	313	' Look , '
64975	64987	64967	64967	he	313	' have you been watching that magical break in the clouds ? '
65003	65006	65007	65007	she	358	' Ah , '
65014	65037	65007	65007	she	358	' that is one of our loveliest effects , and one of the rarest . You are lucky to have seen it . '
65038	65044	65045	65045	he	313	' I am conceited enough , '
65049	65097	65045	65045	he	313	' to feel as if some enchanter were at work up there drawing pictures on the mists for my special benefit . How welcome the rain is ! As I am afraid you have heard me say before , what new charm it gives to your valley ! '
65142	65157	65158	65158	he	313	' Oh , yes . As usual , she is doing everything for me , '
65163	65317	65319	65319	his	2280	' It is disgraceful that I should be idling here while she is struggling with carpenters and paperers , and puzzling out the decorations of the drawing - room . She writes to me in a fury about the word " artistic . " She declares even the little upholsterer at Churton hurls it at her every other minute , and that if it were n't for me she would select everything as frankly , primevally hideous as she could find , just to spite him . As it is , he has so warped her judgment that she has left the sitting - room papers till I arrive . For the drawing - room she avows a passionate preference for one all cabbage - roses and no stalks ; but she admits that it may be exasperation . She wants your sister , clearly , to advise her . By the way , '
65323	65362	65319	65319	his	2280	' the vicar told me last night that Miss Rose is going to Manchester for the winter to study . He heard it from Miss Agnes , I think . The news interested me greatly after our conversation . '
65416	65423	65424	65424	she	358	' I trust it may answer , '
65450	65461	65462	65462	she	358	' It must be a great trial to Mrs. Elsmere , '
65479	65488	65462	65462	she	358	' this going back to her old home . '
65489	65552	65555	65555	she	358	' It is . My father 's long struggle for life in that house is a very painful memory . I wished her to put it off till I could go with her , but she declared she would rather get over the first week or two by herself . How I should like you to know my mother , Miss Leyburn ! '
65579	65590	65591	65591	she	358	' I hope I may some day see Mrs. Elsmere , '
65594	65603	65604	65604	he	2282	' It is one of my strongest wishes , '
65608	65614	65604	65604	he	2282	' to bring you together . '
65668	65684	65685	65685	she	358	' Your mother was with you most of your Oxford life , was she not ? '
65706	65734	65754	65754	her	358	' Since I became a Fellow . We have been alone in the world so long . We have never been able to do without each other . '
65735	65743	65745	65745	Catherine	358	' Is n't it wonderful to you ? '
65851	65864	65878	65879	the parents	2289	' He looked at her quickly — a troubled , questioning look . '
65940	65941	65933	65933	You	0	' '
65944	65965	65933	65933	You	0	' she said , looking straight before her , and still speaking with a distinctness which caught his ear painfully , '
66066	66089	66132	66132	parent	2299	' The voice was low , but it had the clear vibrating ring of steel . Robert 's face had darkened visibly . '
66094	66128	66132	66132	parent	2299	' he cried , goaded by a new stinging sense of revolt and pain—'surely the child may make a fatal mistake if it imagines that its own happiness counts for nothing in the parents '
66217	66247	66301	66302	The parent	2306	' He spoke with heat and anger , with a sense of dashing himself against an obstacle , and a dumb despairing certainty rising at the heart of him . '
66260	66283	66301	66302	The parent	2306	' she answered , her breath coming more quickly , and her eye meeting his with a kind of antagonism in it ; '
66356	66357	66359	66359	you	2315	' '
66370	66383	66359	66359	you	2315	' he cried , quivering under the blow she was dealing him . '
66390	66417	66359	66359	you	2315	' she said , struggling hard to preserve her perfect calm of manner : he could not know that she was trembling from head to foot . '
66496	66700	66457	66457	her	2315	' And she turned to him deadly pale , the faintest , sweetest smile on her lip . He was for the moment incapable of speech . He began phrase after phrase , and broke them off . A whirlwind of feeling possessed him . The strangeness , the unworldliness of what she had done struck him singularly . He realised through every nerve that what she had just said to him she had been bracing herself to say to him ever since their last parting . And now he could not tell , or rather , blindly could not see , whether she suffered in the saying it . A passionate protest rose in him , not so much against her words as against her self - control . The man in him rose up against the woman 's unlooked - for , unwelcome strength . But as the hot words she had dared so much in her simplicity to avert from them both were bursting from him , they were checked by a sudden physical difficulty . A bit of road was under water . A little beck , swollen by the rain , had overflowed , and for a few yards '
66752	66759	66760	66760	he	359	' You must climb the bank , '
66763	66771	66760	66760	he	359	' and get through into the field . '
66861	66869	66870	66870	he	359	' You talk of baseness and treason , '
66892	66981	66883	66883	she	2320	' Life is not so simple . It is so easy to sacrifice others with one 's self , to slay all claims in honour of one , instead of knitting the new ones to the old . Is life to be allowed no natural expansion ? Have you forgotten that , in refusing the new bond for the old bond 's sake , the child may be simply wronging the parents , depriving them of another affection , another support , which ought to have been theirs ? '
67075	67080	67081	67081	she	2320	' In some cases , '
67096	67170	67081	67081	she	2320	' one can not risk the old bond . One dare not trust one 's self — or circumstance . The responsibility is too great ; one can but follow the beaten path , cling to the one thread . But do n't let us talk of it any more . We must make for that gate , Mr. Elsmere . It will bring us out on the road again close by home . '
67403	67416	67395	67395	She	358	' You will come in and see my mother , Mr. Elsmere ? '
67427	67434	67395	67395	She	358	' Your pardon , your friendship , '
67487	67495	67496	67496	he	359	' No , no ; not now , '
67511	67516	67496	67496	he	359	' good - bye . '
67573	67600	67602	67602	she	306	' My dear Cathie ! you have been walking yourself to death . You look like a ghost . Come and have some tea at once . '
67653	67662	67663	67663	she	358	' The weather is very close and exhausting , '
67687	67694	67696	67696	Agnes	306	' Cathie , you are faint , '
67727	67737	67738	67738	she	358	' I have been a long way , dear , '
67746	67782	67738	67738	she	358	' and there is no air . Yes , I will go upstairs and lie down a minute or two . Oh no , do n't come , I will be down for tea directly . '
67853	67866	67847	67847	her	369	' He has proposed to her , and she has said no ! '
67867	67882	67830	67830	Rose	369	' He ? What , Mr. Elsmere ? How on earth can you know ? '
67883	67923	67924	67924	Agnes	306	' I saw them from upstairs come to the bottom of the lane . Then he rushed on , and I have just met her on the stairs . It 's as plain as the nose on your face . '
67929	67936	67937	67937	she	306	' It is hard on him , '
67942	67952	67954	67954	Rose	369	' Yes , it is very hard on him ! '
67972	67978	67968	67968	her	369	' for she loves him ! '
67979	67982	67968	67968	her	369	' Rose ! '
67983	67993	67995	67996	the girl	930	' She does , my dear , she does , '
68000	68009	67995	67996	the girl	930	' I know it in a hundred ways . '
68013	68022	68023	68023	she	306	' And it 's all because of us ? '
68029	68075	68023	68023	she	306	' Of course ! I put it to you , Agnes'—and Rose stood still with a tragic air—'I put it to you , whether it is n't too bad that three unoffending women should have such a rôle as this assigned them against their will ! '
68129	68138	68139	68139	she	369	' It 's absurd , it 's insulting , '
68142	68222	68139	68139	she	369	' I should imagine that you and I , Agnes , were old enough and sane enough to look after mamma , put out the stores , say our prayers , and prevent each other from running away with adventurers ! I wo n't be always in leading - strings . I wo n't acknowledge that Catherine is bound to be an old maid to keep me in order . I hate it ! It is sacrifice run mad . '
68246	68264	68266	68266	Agnes	306	' It is very easy , my dear , to be judge in one 's own case , '
68272	68283	68266	68266	Agnes	306	' Suppose you tell Catherine some of these home truths ? '
68381	68400	68401	68401	she	369	' Well , then , if you wo n't say them to Catherine , say them to mamma , '
68409	68415	68417	68417	Rose	369	' Mamma is no good , '
68420	68437	68417	68417	Rose	369	' why do you bring her in ? Catherine would talk her round in ten minutes . '

68880	68889	68890	68890	she	358	' Why , why am I so weak ? '
69017	69027	69028	69028	she	358	' We are not here only to be happy , '

70319	70330	70317	70318	the girls	973	' sense of expectancy was roused to its highest pitch . '
70339	70344	70317	70318	the girls	973	' said Rose thoughtfully , '

70609	70629	70578	70579	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' Yes , Catherine and Agnes are at the school ; and Rose , I think , is practising . '
70630	70635	70637	70638	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' Ah , well , '
70650	70658	70637	70638	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' I wanted to find you alone . '
70814	70825	70827	70828	her visitor	2409	' I am sure you will be sorry to hear , '
70830	70837	70827	70828	her visitor	2409	' that Mr. Elsmere is going . '
70838	70841	70843	70844	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Going ? '
70851	70869	70843	70844	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Why , I thought he was going to stay with you another ten days at least . '
70870	70879	70881	70882	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' So did I — so did he , '
70898	70901	70881	70882	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' recollection . '
70902	70911	70913	70914	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Then why — what 's the matter ? '
70972	70980	70982	70983	the vicar	1019	' The young man is in love ! '
71005	71011	71016	71016	her	323	' Oh ! with whom ? '
71068	71081	71090	71090	her	323	' Have you guessed nothing ? have the girls told you anything ? '
71082	71085	71090	71090	her	323	' No ! '
71125	71128	71129	71129	she	323	' No , '
71133	71142	71129	71129	she	323	' I ca n't imagine what you mean . '
71156	71168	71169	71169	she	323	' Well , then , he is in love with Catherine ! '
71187	71191	71169	71169	she	323	' With Catherine ! '
71196	71200	71193	71194	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' with Catherine ! '
71241	71242	71237	71237	he	2416	' '
71250	71256	71257	71257	William	342	' said Mrs. Thornburgh hastily . '
71319	71320	71334	71334	you	448	' '
71323	71328	71334	71334	you	448	' cried Mrs. Leyburn . '
71352	71363	71346	71346	he	2416	' She was in a maze of bewilderment and excitement . '
71393	71394	71387	71387	she	358	' '
71408	71421	71401	71401	she	358	' exclaimed Mrs. Leyburn , opening her blue eyes wider and wider . '
71446	71447	71429	71429	she	358	' '
71456	71462	71464	71464	she	358	' said Mrs. Thornburgh boldly , '
71488	71488	71486	71486	yourself	0	'
71608	71617	71619	71620	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' You think Catherine does care for him ? '
71623	71641	71619	71620	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Well , is n't he just the kind of man one would suppose Catherine would like ? '
71647	71794	71643	71644	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' he is a clergyman , and she likes serious people ; and he 's sensible and nice and well - mannered . And then he can talk about books , just like her father used — I'm sure William thinks he knows everything ! He is n't as nice - looking as he might be just now , but then that 's his hair and his fever , poor man . And then he is n't hanging about . He 's got a living , and there 'd be the poor people all ready , and everything else Catherine likes . And now I 'll just ask you — did you ever see Catherine more — more — lively — well , I know that 's not just the word , but you know what I mean — than she has been the last fortnight ? '
71827	71829	71816	71816	She	323	' lively '
71835	71843	71845	71846	the vicar	1019	' Girls get so frightfully particular nowadays , '
71854	71919	71920	71921	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Why , when William fell in love with me , I just fell in love with him — at once — because he did . And if it had n't been William , but somebody else , it would have been the same . I do n't believe girls have got hearts like pebbles — if the man 's nice , of course ! '
71947	71950	71951	71951	she	323	' But , '
71959	71974	71951	71951	she	323	' if she did care for him , why should she send him away ? '
71975	71983	71985	71986	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' Because she wo n't have him ! '
72016	72100	72012	72013	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Because she wo n't have him , my dear Mrs. Leyburn ! And — and — I'm sure nothing would make me interfere like this if I were n't so fond of you all , and if William and I did n't know for certain that there never was a better young man born ! And then I was just sure you 'd be the last person in the world , if you knew , to stand in young people 's way ! '
72101	72104	72106	72108	poor Mrs. Leyburn—'I	450	' I ! '
72114	72130	72106	72108	poor Mrs. Leyburn—'I	450	' She was getting tremulous and tearful , and Mrs. Thornburgh felt herself a brute . '
72133	72141	72142	72142	I	0	' she said , plunging on desperately , '
72179	72210	72178	72178	I	0	'm just about sure that there might be a chance for Robert , if only Catherine did n't feel that you and the girls could n't get on without her ! '
72252	72263	72265	72266	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' I do n't know how we should get on , '
72356	72375	72341	72341	she	323	' Is his mother nice ? Where 's his living ? Would he want to be married soon ? '
72630	72639	72641	72642	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Yes , it all sounds very well , '
72648	72661	72641	72642	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' but , you know , Catherine is n't easy to manage . '
72662	72674	72641	72642	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Could you talk to her — find out a little ? '
72675	72771	72641	72642	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Well , not to - day ; I shall hardly see her . Does n't it seem to you that when a girl takes up notions like Catherine 's , she has n't time for thinking about the young men ? Why , she 's as full of business all day long as an egg 's full of meat . Well , it was my poor Richard 's doing — it was his doing , bless him ! I am not going to say anything against it . But it was different — once . '
72772	72778	72780	72781	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' Yes , I know , '
72784	72870	72780	72781	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' One had plenty of time , when you and I were young , to sit at home and think what one was going to wear , and how one would look , and whether he had been paying attention to any one else ; and if he had , why ; and all that . And now the young women are so superior . But the marrying has got to be done somehow all the same . What is she doing to - day ? '
72871	72896	72641	72642	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Oh , she 'll be busy all to - day and to - morrow ; I hardly expect to see her till Saturday . '
72905	72914	72915	72915	she	448	' Why , what is the matter now ? '
72923	72946	72918	72918	her	448	' My dear Mrs. Leyburn , one would think we had the cholera in the parish . Catherine just spoils the people . '
72947	72953	72955	72956	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Do n't you remember , '
72970	72991	72965	72965	herself	323	' that to - morrow is Midsummer Day , and that Mary Backhouse is as bad as she can be ? '
72992	73005	73007	73008	the vicar	1019	' Mary Backhouse ! Why , I had forgotten all about her ! '
73132	73144	73145	73145	she	448	' How do you get her home to - morrow night ? '
73152	73172	73145	73145	she	448	' Oh , we send our man Richard at ten . He takes a lantern if it 's dark . '
73312	73318	73324	73324	herself	448	' Ten o'clock — moonlight , '
73341	73638	73639	73639	Catherine	358	' To any person familiar with her character the signs of some unusual preoccupation were clear enough in Mrs. Leyburn during this Thursday evening . Catherine noticed them at once when she got back from High Ghyll about eight o'clock , and wondered first of all what was the matter ; and then , with more emphasis , why the trouble was not immediately communicated to her . It had never entered into her head to take her mother into her confidence with regard to Elsmere . Since she could remember , it had been an axiom in the family to spare the delicate nervous mother all the anxieties and perplexities of life . It was a system in which the subject of it had always acquiesced with perfect contentment , and Catherine had no qualms about it . If there was good news , it was presented in its most sugared form to Mrs. Leyburn ; but the moment any element of pain and difficulty cropped up in the common life , it was pounced upon and appropriated by Catherine , aided and abetted by the girls , and Mrs. Leyburn knew no more about it than an unweaned babe . So that Catherine was thinking at most of some misconduct of a Perth dyer with regard to her mother 's best gray poplin , when one of the greatest surprises of her life burst upon her . She was in Mrs. Leyburn 's bedroom that night , helping to put away her mother 's things , as her custom was . She had just taken off the widow 's cap , caressing as she did so the brown hair underneath , which was still soft and plentiful , when Mrs. Leyburn turned upon her . '
73641	73659	73639	73639	Catherine	358	' she said in an agitated voice , laying a thin hand on her daughter 's arm . '
73671	73690	73664	73664	I	0	' Catherine knelt lightly down by her mother 's side , and put her arms round her waist . '
73696	73703	73664	73664	I	0	' she said , half smiling . '
73739	73786	73787	73787	Mother	393	' The change that took place in Catherine Leyburn 's face is indescribable . She rose instantly , her arms falling behind her , her beautiful brows drawn together . Mrs. Leyburn looked up at her with a pathetic mixture of helplessness , alarm , entreaty . '
73801	73805	73787	73787	Mother	393	' demanded Catherine . '
73816	73822	73811	73811	dear	9802	' said the widow hastily ; '
73839	73846	73848	73848	she	358	'm a bad mother , Catherine ! '
73860	73867	73848	73848	she	358	' Do you care for him ? '
73888	73893	73894	73894	she	358	' I want nothing , '
73929	73979	73923	73923	I	0	' Mrs. Leyburn gazed down on her with infinite perplexity . The brown hair , escaped from the cap , had fallen about her still pretty neck , a pink spot of excitement was on each gently - hollowed cheek ; she looked almost younger than her pale daughter . '
73987	73992	73982	73982	he	2465	' she said timidly . '
74011	74012	74013	74013	I	0	' '
74024	74060	74061	74061	I	0	' said Catherine , smiling a little with an unsteady lip , and kissing her hand . Mrs. Leyburn sighed and looked straight before her . Perhaps in imagination she saw the vicar 's wife . '
74067	74073	74064	74064	I	0	' she said very seriously , '
74079	74097	74098	74098	Mother	8451	' Catherine straightened herself brusquely at that . It was as though she had felt a blow . '
74100	74118	74120	74120	you	8451	' she cried , with a stifled accent of pain , and yet still trying to smile , '
74127	74128	74120	74120	you	8451	' '
74133	74139	74120	74120	you	8451	' cried Mrs. Leyburn hastily . '
74213	74257	74204	74205	Your father	8901	' She spoke with pleading agitation , her own tempting imaginations — the pallor , the latent storm of Catherine 's look — exciting her more and more . Catherine was silent a moment , then she caught her mother 's hand again . '
74291	74306	74278	74278	I	0	' And she once more rested her head clingingly on Mrs. Leyburn 's knee . '
74318	74319	74309	74309	you	2478	' '
74335	74336	74320	74320	I	0	' '
74340	74359	74360	74360	she	2484	' sighed Mrs. Leyburn , as though addressing a third person , the tears in her mild eyes , '
74375	74383	74373	74373	I	0	' Catherine rose , stung beyond bearing . '
74394	74400	74385	74385	I	0	' her deep voice quivering . '
74421	74422	74401	74401	You	2478	' '
74439	74451	74424	74424	you	2478	' cried Mrs. Leyburn , almost with an accent of pettishness . '
74512	74512	74504	74505	a man	1055	'
74513	74522	74525	74525	Catherine	358	' And you , mother , without me ? '
74529	74539	74541	74542	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' Oh , I should come and see you , '
74546	74565	74541	74542	Mrs. Leyburn	323	' They say it is such a nice house , Catherine , and such pretty country ; and I 'm
74578	74657	74574	74574	she	8417	' It was the bitterest moment of Catherine Leyburn 's life . In it the heroic dream of years broke down . Nay , the shrivelling ironic touch of circumstance laid upon it made it look even in her own eyes almost ridiculous . What had she been living for , praying for , all these years ? She threw herself down by the widow 's side , her face working with a passion that terrified Mrs. Leyburn . '
74677	74793	74660	74660	mother	8451	' Then Mrs. Leyburn herself broke down , and the two women clung to each other , weeping . Catherine 's sore heart was soothed a little by her mother 's tears , and by the broken words of endearment that were lavished on her . But through it all she felt that the excited imaginative desire in Mrs. Leyburn still persisted . It was the cheapening — the vulgarising , so to speak , of her whole existence . In the course of their long embrace Mrs. Leyburn let fall various items of news that showed Catherine very plainly who had been at work upon her mother , and one of which startled her . '
74829	74852	74816	74817	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' And Mrs. Leyburn looked up at her now standing daughter with eyes as woe - begone for Elsmere as for herself . '
74863	74867	74861	74861	mother	8451	' Catherine implored . '
74887	74933	74880	74881	Mrs. Thornburgh	448	' Mrs. Leyburn let herself be gradually soothed and coerced , and Catherine , with a last kiss to the delicate emaciated fingers on which the worn wedding - ring lay slipping forward — in itself a history — left her at last to sleep . '
74946	74954	74943	74943	I	0	' sighed the perplexed widow to herself . '
74966	75187	74959	74959	Richard	364	' Catherine 's night was a night of intense mental struggle . Her struggle was one with which the modern world has perhaps but scant sympathy . Instinctively we feel such things out of place in our easy indifferent generation . We think them more than half unreal . We are so apt to take it for granted that the world has outgrown the religious thirst for sanctification , for a perfect moral consistency , as it has outgrown so many of the older complications of the sentiment of honour . And meanwhile half the tragedy of our time lies in this perpetual clashing of two estimates of life — the estimate which is the offspring of the scientific spirit , and which is for ever making the visible world fairer and more desirable in mortal eyes ; and the estimate of Saint Augustine . As a matter of fact , owing to some travelling difficulties , the vicar and Elsmere did not get home till noon on Friday . Catherine knew nothing of either delay or arrival . Mrs. Leyburn watched her with anxious timidity , but she never mentioned Elsmere 's name to any one on the Friday morning , and no one dared speak of him to her . She came home in the afternoon from the Backhouses '
75203	75224	74959	74959	Richard	364	' rest , and hurried off again . She passed the vicarage with bent head , and never looked up . '
75229	75248	75225	75225	She	2448	' said Rose to Agnes as she stood at the window looking after her sister 's retreating figure . '
75270	76420	75260	75260	He	2499	' The girl spoke with a lump in her throat , and flung herself down by the window , moodily watching the dark form against the fells . Catherine 's coldness seemed to make all life colder and more chilling — to fling a hard denial in the face of the dearest claims of earth . The stormy light of the afternoon was fading towards sunset . Catherine walked on fast towards the group of houses at the head of the valley , in one of which lived the two old carriers who had worked such havoc with Mrs. Thornburgh 's housekeeping arrangements . She was tired physically , but she was still more tired mentally . She had the bruised feeling of one who has been humiliated before the world and before herself . Her self - respect was for the moment crushed , and the breach made in the wholeness of personal dignity had produced a strange slackness of nerve , extending both to body and mind . She had been convicted , it seemed to her , in her own eyes , and in those of her world , of an egregious over - estimate of her own value . She walked with hung head like one ashamed , the overstrung religious sense deepening her discomfiture at every step . How rich her life had always been in the conviction of usefulness — nay , indispensableness ! Her mother 's persuasions had dashed it from her . And religious scruple , for her torment , showed her her past , transformed , alloyed with all sorts of personal prides and cravings , which stood unmasked now in a white light . And he ? Still near her for a few short hours ! Every pulse in her had thrilled as she had passed the house which sheltered him . But she will see him no more . And she is glad . If he had stayed on , he too would have discovered how cheaply they held her — those dear ones of hers for whom she had lived till now ! And she might have weakly yielded to his pity what she had refused to his homage . The strong nature is half tortured , half soothed by the prospect of his going . Perhaps when he is gone she will recover something of that moral equilibrium which has been so shaken . At present she is a riddle to herself , invaded by a force she has no power to cope with , feeling the moral ground of years crumbling beneath her , and struggling feverishly for self - control . As she neared the head of the valley the wind became less tempestuous . The great wall of High Fell , towards which she was walking , seemed to shelter her from its worst violence . But the hurrying clouds , the gleams of lurid light which every now and then penetrated into the valley from the west , across the dip leading to Shanmoor , the voice of the river answering the voice of the wind , and the deep unbroken shadow that covered the group of houses and trees towards which she was walking , all served to heighten the nervous depression which had taken hold of her . As she neared the bridge , however , leading to the little hamlet , beyond which northwards all was stony loneliness and desolation , and saw in front of her the gray stone house , backed by the sombre red of a great copper beech , and overhung by crags , she had perforce to take herself by both hands , try and realise her mission afresh , and the scene which lay before her . Mary Backhouse , the girl whom Catherine had been visiting with regularity for many weeks , and whose frail life was this evening nearing a terrible and long - expected crisis , was the victim of a fate sordid and common enough , yet not without its elements of dark poetry . Some fifteen months before this Midsummer Day she had been the mistress of the lonely old house in which her father and uncle had passed their whole lives , in which she had been born , and in which , amid snowdrifts so deep that no doctor could reach them , her mother had passed away . She had been then strong and well favoured , possessed of a certain masculine black - browed beauty , and of a temper which sometimes gave to it an edge and glow such as an artist of ambition might have been glad to catch . At the bottom of all the outward sauvagerie , however , there was a heart , and strong wants , which only affection and companionship could satisfy and tame . Neither was to be found in sufficient measure within her home . Her father and she were on fairly good terms , and had for each other up to a certain point the natural instincts of kinship . On her uncle , whom she regarded as half - witted , she bestowed alternate tolerance and jeers . She was , indeed , the only person whose remonstrances ever got under the wool with old Jim , and her sharp tongue had sometimes a cowing effect on his curious nonchalance which nothing else had . For the rest , they had no neighbours with whom the girl could fraternise , and Whinborough was too far off to provide any adequate food for her vague hunger after emotion and excitement . In this dangerous morbid state she fell a victim to the very coarse attractions of a young farmer in the neighbouring valley of Shanmoor . He was a brute with a handsome face , and a nature in which whatever grains of heart and conscience might have been interfused with the original composition had been long since swamped . Mary , who had recklessly flung herself into his power on one or two occasions , from a mixture of motives , partly passion , partly jealousy , partly ennui , awoke one day to find herself ruined , and a grim future hung before her . She had realised her doom for the first time in its entirety on the Midsummer Day preceding that we are now describing . On that day she had walked over to Shanmoor in a fever of dumb rage and despair , to claim from her betrayer the fulfilment of his promise of marriage . He had laughed at her , and she had fled home in the warm rainy dusk , a prey to all those torturing terrors which only a woman in extremis can know . And on her way back she had seen the ghost or '
76422	77011	77332	77332	he	0	' of Deep Crag ; the ghost had spoken to her , and she had reached home more dead than alive , having received what she at once recognised as her death sentence . What had she seen ? An effect of moonlit mist — a shepherd boy bent on a practical joke — a gleam of white waterfall among the darkening rocks ? What had she heard ? The evening greeting of a passer - by , wafted down to her from some higher path along the fell ? distant voices in the farm enclosures beneath her feet ? or simply the eerie sounds of the mountain , those weird earth - whispers which haunt the lonely places of nature ? Who can tell ? Nerves and brain were strained to their uttermost . The legend of the ghost — of the girl who had thrown her baby and herself into the tarn under the frowning precipitous cliffs which marked the western end of High Fell , and who had since then walked the lonely road to Shanmoor every Midsummer Night , with her moaning child upon her arm — had flashed into Mary 's mind as she left the white - walled village of Shanmoor behind her , and climbed upward with her shame and her secret into the mists . To see the bogle was merely distressing and untoward ; to be spoken to by the phantom voice was death . No one so addressed could hope to survive the following Midsummer Day . Revolving these things in her mind , along with the terrible details of her own story , the exhausted girl had seen her vision , and , as she firmly believed , incurred her doom . A week later she had disappeared from home and from the neighbourhood . The darkest stories were afloat . She had taken some money with her , and all trace of her was lost . The father had a period of gloomy taciturnity , during which his principal relief was got out of jeering and girding at his elder brother , the noodle 's eyes wandered and glittered more ; his shrunken frame seemed more shrunken as he sat dangling his spindle legs from the shaft of the carrier 's cart ; his absence of mind was for a time more marked , and excused with less buoyancy and inventiveness than usual . But otherwise all went on as before . John Backhouse took no step , and for nine months nothing was heard of his daughter . At last one cheerless March afternoon , Jim , coming back first from the Wednesday round with the cart , entered the farm kitchen , while John Backhouse was still wrangling at one of the other farmhouses of the hamlet about some disputed payment . The old man came in cold and weary , and the sight of the half - tended kitchen and neglected fire — they paid a neighbour to do the housework , as far as the care of her own seven children would let her — suddenly revived in his slippery mind the memory of his niece , who , with all her faults , had had the makings of a housewife , and for whom , in spite of her flouts and jeers , he had always cherished a secret admiration . As he came in he noticed that the door to the left hand , leading into what Westmoreland folk call the '
77013	77285	75260	75260	He	2499	' or sitting - room of the farm , was open . The room had hardly been used since Mary 's flight , and the few pieces of black oak and shining mahogany which adorned it had long ago fallen from their pristine polish . The geraniums and fuchsias with which she had filled the window all the summer before had died into dry blackened stalks ; and the dust lay heavy on the room , in spite of the well - meant but wholly ineffective efforts of the charwoman next door . The two old men had avoided the place for months past by common consent , and the door into it was hardly ever opened . Now , however , it stood ajar , and old Jim going up to shut it , and looking in , was struck dumb with astonishment . For there on a wooden rocking - chair , which had been her mother 's favourite seat , sat Mary Backhouse , her feet on the curved brass fender , her eyes staring into the parlour grate . Her clothes , her face , her attitude of cowering chill and mortal fatigue , produced an impression which struck through the old man 's dull senses , and made him tremble so that his hand dropped from the handle of the door . The slight sound roused Mary , and she turned towards him . She said nothing for a few seconds , her hollow black eyes fixed upon him ; then with a ghastly smile , and a voice so hoarse as to be scarcely audible — '
77298	77312	77332	77332	he	0	' There was a sound behind on the cobbles outside the kitchen door . '

77543	77655	77483	77485	the old man	8600	' She sank again into her chair , as though her limbs could not support her , and her eyes closed in the utter indifference of a fatigue which had made even fear impossible . The father 's arm dropped ; he stood there sullenly looking at her . Jim , thinking she had fainted , went up to her , took a glass of water out of which she had already been drinking from the mahogany table , and held it to her lips . She drank a little , and then with a desperate effort raised herself , and clutching the arm of the chair , faced her father . '

77874	78010	77805	77809	the neighbour from next door	2517	' She needed no telling . She soon crept downstairs again , and went to the task of house - cleaning . The two men lived in the kitchen as before ; when they were at home she ate and sat in the parlour alone . Jim watched her as far as his dull brain was capable of watching , and he dimly understood that she was dying . Both men , indeed , felt a sort of superstitious awe of her , she was so changed , so unearthly . As for the story of the ghost , the old popular superstitions are almost dead in the Cumbrian mountains , and the shrewd north - country peasant is in many places quite as scornfully ready to sacrifice his ghosts to the Time Spirit as any '
78013	79131	77805	77809	the neighbour from next door	2517	' haunter of scientific associa tions could wish him to be . But in a few of the remoter valleys they still linger , though beneath the surface . Either of the Backhouses , or Mary in her days of health , would have suffered many things rather than allow a stranger to suppose they placed the smallest credence in the story of Bleacliff Tarn . But , all the same , the story which each had heard in childhood , on stormy nights perhaps , when the mountain side was awful with the sounds of tempest , had grown up with them , had entered deep into the tissue of consciousness . In Mary 's imagination the ideas and images connected with it had now , under the stimulus of circumstance , become instinct with a living pursuing terror . But they were present , though in a duller , blunter state , in the minds of her father and uncle ; and as the weeks passed on , and the days lengthened towards midsummer , a sort of brooding horror seemed to settle on the house . Mary grew weaker and weaker ; her cough kept Jim awake at nights ; once or twice when he went to help her with a piece of work which not even her extraordinary will could carry her through , her hand burnt him like a hot cinder . But she kept all other women out of the house by her mad , strange ways ; and if her uncle showed any consciousness of her state , she turned upon him with her old temper , which had lost all its former stormy grace , and had become ghastly by the contrast it brought out between the tempestuous vindictive soul and the shaken weakness of frame . A doctor would have discovered at once that what was wrong with her was phthisis , complicated with insanity ; and the insanity , instead of taking the hopeful optimistic tinge which is characteristic of the insanity of consumption , had rather assumed the colour of the events from which the disease itself had started . Cold , exposure , long - continued agony of mind and body — the madness intertwined with an illness which had such roots as these was naturally a madness of despair . One of its principal signs was the fixed idea as to Midsummer Day . It never occurred to her as possible that her life should be prolonged beyond that limit . Every night , as she dragged herself up the steep little staircase to her room , she checked off the day which had just passed from the days she had still to live . She had made all her arrangements ; she had even sewed with her own hands , and that without any sense of special horror , but rather in the provident peasant way , the dress in which she was to be carried to her grave . At last one day , her father , coming unexpectedly into the yard , saw her carrying a heavy pail of water from the pump . Something stirred within him , and he went up to her and forcibly took it from her . Their looks met , and her poor mad eyes gazed intensely into his . As he moved forward towards the house she crept after him , passing him into the parlour , where she sank down breathless on the settle where she had been sleeping for the last few nights , rather than face climbing the stairs . For the first time he followed her , watching her gasping struggle for breath , in spite of her impatient motion to him to go . After a few seconds he left her , took his hat , went out , saddled his horse , and rode off to Whinborough . He got Dr. Baker to promise to come over on the morrow , and on his way back he called and requested to see Catherine Leyburn . He stammeringly asked her to come and visit his daughter who was ill and lonesome , and when she consented gladly he went on his way feeling a load off his mind . What he had just done had been due to an undefined , but still vehement prompting of conscience . It did not make it any the less probable that the girl would die on or before Midsummer Day ; but , supposing her story were true , it absolved him from any charge of assistance to the designs of those grisly powers in whose clutch she was . When the doctor came next morning a change for the worse had taken place , and she was too feeble actively to resent his appearance . She lay there on the settle , every now and then making superhuman efforts to get up , which generally ended in a swoon . She refused to take any medicine , she would hardly take any food , and to the doctor 's questions she returned no answer whatever . In the same way , when Catherine came , she would be absolutely silent , looking at her with glittering , feverish eyes , but taking no notice at all , whether she read or talked , or simply sat quietly beside her . After the silent period , as the days went on , and Midsummer Day drew nearer , there supervened a period of intermittent delirium . In the evenings , especially when her temperature rose , she became talkative and incoherent , and Catherine would sometimes tremble as she caught the sentences which , little by little , built up the girl 's hidden tragedy before her eyes . London streets , London lights , London darkness , the agony of an endless wandering , the little clinging puny life , which could never be stilled or satisfied , biting cold , intolerable pain , the cheerless workhouse order , and , finally , the arms without a burden , the breast without a child — these were the sharp fragments of experience , so common , so terrible to the end of time , which rose on the troubled surface of Mary Backhouse 's delirium , and smote the tender heart of the listener . Then in the mornings she would lie suspicious and silent , watching Catherine 's face with the long gaze of exhaustion , as though trying to find out from it whether her secret had escaped her . The doctor , who had gathered the story of the '
79133	79664	79665	79665	I	0	' from Catherine , to whom Jim had told it , briefly and reluctantly , and with an absolute reservation of his own views on the matter , recommended that if possible they should try and deceive her as to the date of the day and month . Mere nervous excitement might , he thought , be enough to kill her when the actual day and hour came round . But all their attempts were useless . Nothing distracted the intense sleepless attention with which the darkened mind kept always in view that one absorbing expectation . Words fell from her at night which seemed to show that she expected a summons — a voice along the fell , calling her spirit into the dark . And then would come the shriek , the struggle to get loose , the choked waking , the wandering , horror - stricken eyes , subsiding by degrees into the old silent watch . On the morning of the 23d , when Robert , sitting at his work , was looking at Burwood through the window in the flattering belief that Catherine was the captive of the weather , she had spent an hour or more with Mary Backhouse , and the austere influences of the visit had perhaps had more share than she knew in determining her own mood that day . The world seemed such dross , the pretences of personal happiness so hollow and delusive , after such a sight ! The girl lay dying fast , with a look of extraordinary attentiveness in her face , hearing every noise , every footfall , and , as it seemed to Catherine , in a mood of inward joy . She took , moreover , some notice of her visitor . As a rough tomboy of fourteen , she had shown Catherine , who had taught her in the school sometimes , and had especially won her regard on one occasion by a present of some article of dress , a good many uncouth signs of affection . On the morning in question Catherine fancied she saw something of the old childish expression once or twice . At any rate , there was no doubt her presence was soothing , as she read in her low vibrating voice , or sat silently stroking the emaciated hand , raising it every now and then to her lips with a rush of that intense pitifulness which was to her the most natural of all moods . The doctor , whom she met there , said that this state of calm was very possibly only transitory . The night had been passed in a succession of paroxysms , and they were almost sure to return upon her , especially as he could get her to swallow none of the sedatives which might have carried her in unconsciousness past the fatal moment . She would have none of them ; he thought that she was determined to allow of no encroachments on the troubled remnants of intelligence still left to her ; so the only thing to be done was to wait and see the result . '
79672	79677	79665	79665	I	0	' said Catherine briefly ; '
79687	79710	79665	79665	I	0	' She had long ago established her claim to be treated seriously as a nurse , and Dr. Baker made no objection . '
79717	79722	79665	79665	I	0	' he said dubiously . '
79777	79973	79974	79974	She	2522	' All through Catherine 's own struggle and pain during these two days the image of the dying girl had lain at her heart . It served her as the crucifix serves the Romanist ; as she pressed it into her thought , it recovered from time to time the failing forces of the will . Need life be empty because self was left unsatisfied ? Now , as she neared the hamlet , the quality of her nature reasserted itself . The personal want tugging at her senses , the personal soreness , the cry of resentful love , were silenced . What place had they in the presence of this lonely agony of death , this mystery , this opening beyond ? The old heroic mood revived in her . Her step grew swifter , her carriage more erect , and as she entered the farm kitchen she felt herself once more ready in spirit for what lay before her . From the next room there came a succession of husky sibilant sounds , as though some one were whispering hurriedly and continuously . After her subdued greeting she looked inquiringly at Jim . '
79981	80002	79974	79974	She	2522	' said Jim , who looked more attenuated and his face more like a pink and white parchment than ever . '
80008	80022	80023	80023	he	2523	' taaking a long while . She woan't know ye . Luke ye , '
80033	80035	80027	80027	his	2523	' house '
80040	80062	80030	80030	he	2523	' ef you want ayder ov oos , you jest call oot — sharp ! Mrs. Irwin , shell stay in wi '
80070	80235	80065	80065	she	2522	' The superstitious excitement which the looks and gestures of the old man expressed touched Catherine 's imagination , and she entered the room with an inward shiver . Mary Backhouse lay raised high on her pillows , talking to herself or to imaginary other persons , with eyes wide open but vacant , and senses conscious of nothing but the dream world in which the mind was wandering . Catherine sat softly down beside her , unnoticed , thankful for the chances of disease . If this delirium lasted till the ghost - hour — the time of twilight , that is to say , which would begin about half - past eight , and the duration of which would depend on the cloudiness of the evening — was over , or , better still , till midnight were past , the strain on the girl 's agonised senses might be relieved , and death come at last in softer , kinder guise . '
80243	80266	80027	80027	his	2523	' she asked softly of the neighbour who sat quietly knitting by the evening light . The woman looked up and thought . '
80269	80273	80274	80274	Aa	453	' she said . '
80283	80289	80274	80274	Aa	453	' she 's been maistly taakin '
80293	80519	80274	80274	Aa	453	' The incoherent whisperings and restless movements , which obliged Catherine constantly to replace the coverings over the poor wasted and fevered body , went on for some time . Catherine noticed presently , with a little thrill , that the light was beginning to change . The weather was growing darker and stormier ; the wind shook the house in gusts ; and the farther shoulder of High Fell , seen in distorted outline through the casemented window , was almost hidden by the trailing rain clouds . The mournful western light coming from behind the house struck the river here and there ; almost everything else was gray and dark . A mountain ash , just outside the window , brushed the panes every now and then ; and in the silence every surrounding sound — the rare movements in the next room , the voices of quarrelling children round the door of a neighbouring house , the far - off barking of dogs — made itself distinctly audible . Suddenly Catherine , sunk in painful reverie , noticed that the mutterings from the bed had ceased for some little time . She turned her chair , and was startled to find those weird eyes fixed with recognition on herself . There was a curious malign intensity , a curious triumph in them . '
80527	80534	80274	80274	Aa	453	' said the gasping voice—'eight o'clock ; '
80561	80564	80566	80566	Catherine	358	' Mary , '
80588	80631	80566	80566	Catherine	358	' ca n't you put this thought away from you ? We are not the playthings of evil spirits — we are the children of God ! We are in His hands . No evil thing can harm us against His will . '
80785	80788	80790	80790	Catherine	358	' Mary , '
80804	80913	80790	80790	Catherine	358	' Mary , if I were to go out now and leave Mrs. Irwin with you , and if I were to go up all the way to the top of Shanmoss and back again , and if I could tell you there was nothing there , nothing!—if I were to stay out till the dark has come — it will be here in half an hour — and you could be quite sure when you saw me again , that there was nothing near you but the dear old hills , and the power of God , could you believe me and try and rest and sleep ? '
80995	80998	81008	81009	the girl	930	' Go ! '
81022	81025	81008	81009	the girl	930	' Go ! '

81088	81095	81082	81082	she	358	' God is everywhere , Mary . '

81393	81414	81370	81370	he	359	' I never dreamt of it — so late . My cousin sent me over — she wished for news . '
81441	81454	81455	81455	she	358	' The excited state may be over in a short time now , '
81463	81532	81455	81455	she	358	' but at present it is at its height . It seemed to please her'—and withdrawing her hand , she turned to John Backhouse—'when I suggested that I should walk up to Shanmoss and back . I said I would come back to her in half an hour or so , when the daylight was quite gone , and prove to her there was nothing on the path . '
81553	81563	81541	81542	Mrs. Irwin	452	' Miss Leyburn — Miss Catherine ! Yur not gawin '
81568	81573	81574	81575	The woman	8910	' oop that path ? '
81586	81611	81574	81575	The woman	8910	' Yes , I am , Mrs. Irwin — but I shall be back very soon . Do n't leave her ; go back . '
81623	81627	81613	81613	Catherine	358	' Doan't ye let '
81632	81640	81641	81641	One	917	' said the woman excitedly to Robert . '
81647	81674	81641	81641	One	917	' And she pointed with a meaning gesture to the room behind her . Robert looked at Catherine , who was moving towards the outer door . '
81681	81691	81675	81675	I	0	' he said hastily , his face lighting up . '
81708	82199	81641	81641	One	917	' Catherine trembled as she heard the words , but she made no sign , and the two men and the woman watched their departure with blank uneasy wonderment . A second later they were on the fell - side climbing a rough stony path , which in places was almost a watercourse , and which wound up the fell towards a tract of level swampy moss or heath , beyond which lay the descent to Shanmoor . Daylight was almost gone ; the stormy yellow west was being fast swallowed up in cloud ; below them as they climbed lay the dark group of houses , with a light twinkling here and there . All about them were black mountain forms ; a desolate tempestuous wind drove a gusty rain into their faces ; a little beck roared beside them , and in the distance from the black gulf of the valley the swollen river thundered . Elsmere looked down on his companion with an indescribable exultation , a passionate sense of possession which could hardly restrain itself . He had come back that morning with a mind clearly made up . Catherine had been blind indeed when she supposed that any plan of his or hers would have been allowed to stand in the way of that last wrestle with her , of which he had planned all the methods , rehearsed all the arguments . But when he reached the vicarage he was greeted with the news of her absence . She was inaccessible it appeared for the day . No matter ! The vicar and he settled in the fewest possible words that he should stay till Monday , Mrs. Thornburgh meanwhile looking on , saying what civility demanded , and surprisingly little else . Then in the evening Mrs. Thornburgh had asked of him with a manner of admirable indifference whether he felt inclined for an evening walk to High Ghyll to inquire after Mary Backhouse . The request fell in excellently with a lover 's restlessness , and Robert assented at once . The vicar saw him go with puzzled brows and a quick look at his wife , whose head was bent close over her worsted work . It never occurred to Elsmere — or if it did occur , he pooh - poohed the notion — that he should find Catherine still at her post far from home on this dark stormy evening . But in the glow of joy which her presence had brought him he was still capable of all sorts of delicate perceptions and reasonings . His quick imagination carried him through the scene from which she had just momentarily escaped . He had understood the exaltation of her look and tone . If love spoke at all , ringed with such surroundings , it must be with its most inward and spiritual voice , as those speak who feel '
82202	82235	82236	82236	We	2540	' about them . But the darkness hid her from him so well that he had to feel out the situation for himself . He could not trace it in her face . '
82248	82276	82236	82236	We	2540	' she said to him as he held a gate open for her which led them into a piece of larch plantation on the mountain - side . '
82321	82322	82324	82324	you	2545	' '
82333	82334	82324	82324	you	2545	' '
82339	82344	82324	82324	you	2545	' she said sighing , '
82382	82383	82438	82438	I	0	' '
82388	82417	82438	82438	I	0	' said Robert , startled a little by some ghostly sounds in front of them . The little wood was almost dark , and he could see nothing . '
82428	82432	82433	82433	our	2547	' said Catherine ; '
82451	82512	82441	82441	We	2547	' And as they quitted the trees , a dark bulky form to the left suddenly lifted a shadowy head from the grass , and clattered down the slope . A cluster of white - stemmed birches just ahead of them caught whatever light was still left in the atmosphere , their feathery tops bending and swaying against the sky . '
82529	82533	82441	82441	We	2547	' said Robert . '
82559	82620	82441	82441	We	2547	' For they were passing a little gully deep in bracken , up which the blast was tearing its tempestuous way . Catherine shivered a little , and the sense of physical exhaustion , which had been banished like everything else — doubt , humiliation , bitterness — by the one fact of his presence , came back on her . '
82632	82639	82441	82441	We	2547	' she said , and paused . '
82647	82661	82641	82641	you	0	' he asked , his voice thrilling her with a hundred different meanings . '
82669	82670	82662	82662	I	0	' '
82679	82685	82671	82671	I	0	' she said , trembling . '

82735	82802	82803	82803	Catherine	358	' said Catherine , trying to smile , and could find nothing else to say . They walked on a few moments in silence , splashes of rain breaking in their faces . Robert 's inward excitement was growing fast . Suddenly Catherine 's pulse stood still . She felt her hand lifted , drawn within his arm , covered close with his warm trembling clasp . '
82868	82902	82835	82835	I	0	' She could hardly see his face , but she could feel the passion in his voice and touch . Her cheek seemed to droop against his arm . He felt her tottering . '
82908	82950	82951	82951	I	0	' she said ; and after one moment of dizzy silence he guided her to a rock , sinking down himself beside her , longing , but not daring , to shelter her under his broad Inverness cloak against the storm . '
82955	82962	82951	82951	I	0	' she said , almost whispering , '
82972	82973	82974	82974	I	0	' '
82981	82986	82974	82974	I	0	' he said passionately ; '
83099	83113	83086	83086	you	0	' He caught her unresisting hand , and raised it to his lips . '
83119	83124	83086	83086	you	0	' he said brokenly , '
83179	83282	83295	83295	you	358	' Catherine could hardly breathe . Every word had been like balm upon a wound — like a ray of intense light in the gloom about them . Oh , where was this softness bearing her — this emptiness of all will , of all individual power ? She hid her eyes with her other hand , struggling to recall that far away moment in Marrisdale . But the mind refused to work . Consciousness seemed to retain nothing but the warm grasp of his hand — the tones of his voice . He saw her struggle , and pressed on remorselessly . '
83305	83328	83295	83295	you	358	' She turned to him , and laid her trembling free hand on his arm . He clasped them both with rapture . '
83335	83336	83295	83295	you	358	' '
83341	83356	83295	83295	you	358	' he said , and it almost seemed to her that he was smiling : '
83433	83635	83636	83636	Catherine	358	' But his voice failed him . What a note of youth , of imagination , of impulsive eagerness there was through it all ! The more slowly - moving inarticulate nature was swept away by it . There was but one object clear to her in the whole world of thought or sense , everything else had sunk out of sight — drowned in a luminous mist . He rose and stood before her as he delivered his ultimatum , his tall form drawn up to its full height . In the east , across the valley , above the farther buttress of High Fell , there was a clearer strip of sky , visible for a moment among the moving storm clouds , and a dim haloed moon shone out in it . Far away a white - walled cottage glimmered against the fell ; the pools at their feet shone in the weird passing light . She lifted her head , and looked at him , still irresolute . Then she too rose , and helplessly , like some one impelled by a will not her own , she silently held out to him two white trembling hands . '
83644	83741	83636	83636	Catherine	358	' There was something in the pale virginal grace of look and form which kept his young passion in awe . But he bent his head again over those yielded hands , kissing them with dizzy unspeakable joy . About twenty minutes later Catherine and Robert , having hurried back with all speed from the top of Shanmoss , reached the farmhouse door . She knocked . No one answered . She tried the lock ; it yielded , and they entered . No one in the kitchen . She looked disturbed and conscience - stricken . '
83744	83754	83852	83853	Mrs. Irwin	452	' she cried to him , under her breath ; '
83761	83837	83852	83853	Mrs. Irwin	452	' And hurrying into the inner room she left him waiting . Inside was a mournful sight . The two men and Mrs. Irwin stood close round the settle , but as she came nearer , Catherine saw Mary Backhouse lying panting on her pillows , her breath coming in loud gasps , her dress and all the coverings of the bed showing signs of disorder and confusion , her black hair tossed about her .

84226	84330	84211	84211	she	358	' Mary , I went out ; I climbed all the path as far as Shanmoss . There was nothing evil there . Oh , I must tell you ! Can I make you understand ? I want you to feel that it is only God and love that are real . Oh , think of them ! He would not let you be hurt and terrified in your pain , poor Mary . He loves you .

While you thought you were sending me out to face the evil thing , you were really my kind angel — God 's messenger — sending me to meet the joy of my whole life ! '
84478	84493	84471	84474	some one waiting here	2571	' she went on hurriedly , breathing her sobbing words into Mary 's ear . '

There were tears forming under the heavy lids , the corners of the lips were relaxed and soft . Slowly the feeble hand sought her own . She waited in an intense expectant silence . There was a faint breathing from the lips ; she stooped and caught it . '
84761	84903	84666	84666	His	2572	' said the whisper ; and she laid her soft fresh lips to the parched mouth of the dying . When she lifted her head again Mary still held her hand ; Catherine softly stretched out hers for the opiate Dr. Baker had left ; it was swallowed without resistance , and a quiet to which the invalid had been a stranger for days stole little by little over the wasted frame . The grasp of the fingers relaxed , the laboured breath came more gently , and in a few more minutes she slept . Twilight was long over . The ghost - hour was past , and the moon outside was slowly gaining a wider empire in the clearing heavens . It was a little after ten o'clock when Rose drew aside the curtain at Burwood and looked out . '
84909	84915	84666	84666	His	2572	' she said to Agnes , '
84927	85001	84666	84666	His	2572	' She turned back to her book . Agnes was writing letters . Mrs. Leyburn was sitting by the bit of fire that was generally lit for her benefit in the evenings , her white shawl dropping gracefully about her , a copy of the Cornhill on her lap . But she was not reading , she was meditating , and the girls thought her out of spirits . The hall door opened . '
85009	85021	85023	85024	the vicar	1019	' cried Rose , starting up . Agnes suspended her letter . '
85026	85125	85023	85024	the vicar	1019	' said Mrs. Leyburn , with a little sigh . A hand turned the drawing - room door , and in the doorway stood Elsmere . Rose caught a gray dress disappearing up the little stairs behind him . Elsmere 's look was enough for the two girls . They understood in an instant . Rose flushed all over . The first contact with love is intoxicating to any girl of eighteen , even though the romance be not hers . But Mrs. Leyburn sat bewildered . Elsmere went up to her , stooped and took her hand . '
85136	85149	85127	85127	you	2581	' he said , his boyish looks aglow , his voice unsteady . '

However'—and Langham sighed over his fire—'what have he and I to do with one another in the future ? By all the laws of character something untoward might come out of this marriage . But she will mould him , rather than he her . Besides , she will have children — and that solves most things . '

87529	87847	87524	87524	she	2663	' guest for ten days before the marriage in September , and Catherine , moreover , had paid her a short visit earlier in the summer . But it was now that for the first time she realised to the full the character of the woman Robert had married . Catherine 's manner to her was sweetness itself . Parted from her own mother as she was , the younger woman 's strong filial instincts spent themselves in tending the mother who had been the guardian and life of Robert 's youth . And Mrs. Elsmere in return was awed by Catherine 's moral force and purity of nature , and proud of her personal beauty , which was so real , in spite of the severity of the type , and to which marriage had given , at any rate for the moment , a certain added softness and brilliancy . But there were difficulties in the way . Catherine was a little too apt to treat Mrs. Elsmere as she would have treated her own mother . But to be nursed and protected , to be screened from draughts , and run after with shawls and stools was something wholly new and intolerable to Mrs. Elsmere . She could not away with it , and as soon as she had sufficiently lost her first awe of her daughter - in - law she would revenge herself in all sorts of droll ways , and with occasional flashes of petulant Irish wit which would make Catherine colour and draw back . Then Mrs. Elsmere , touched with remorse , would catch her by the neck and give her a resounding kiss , which perhaps puzzled Catherine no less than her sarcasm of a minute before . Moreover Mrs. Elsmere felt ruefully from the first that her new daughter was decidedly deficient in the sense of humour . '
87857	87865	87852	87855	that father of hers	2670	' she would say to herself crossly . '
87925	88170	87917	87917	his	2673	' Certainly it needed a faculty of laughter to be always able to take Mrs. Elsmere on the right side . For instance , Catherine was more often scandalised than impressed by her mother - in - law 's charitable performances . Mrs. Elsmere 's little cottage was filled with workhouse orphans sent to her from different London districts . The training of these girls was the chief business of her life , and a very odd training it was , conducted in the noisiest way and on the most familiar terms . It was undeniable that the girls generally did well , and they invariably adored Mrs. Elsmere , but Catherine did not much like to think about them . Their household teaching under Mrs. Elsmere and her old servant Martha — as great an original as herself — was so irregular , their religious training so extraordinary , the clothes in which they were allowed to disport themselves so scandalous to the sober taste of the rector 's wife , that Catherine involuntarily regarded the little cottage on the hill as a spot of misrule in the general order of the parish . She would go in , say , at eleven o'clock in the morning , find her mother - in - law in bed , half - dressed , with all her handmaidens about her , giving her orders , reading her letters and the newspaper , cutting out her girls '

There is a trace of a visit of Sidney 's . Waller was there , and left a copy of verses in the library . Evelyn laid out a great deal of the garden . Lord Clarendon wrote part of his History in the garden , et cetera , et cetera . The place is steeped in associations , and as beautiful as a dream to begin with . '

92465	92471	92462	92463	Mrs. Elsmere	359	' said Rose , pouting ; '

92525	92530	92531	92536	A High Church clergyman near here	2825	' inquired Rose sharply . '
92546	92575	92576	92576	Lohengrin	479	' said Catherine , escaping . Rose took her hat off very leisurely . The prospect downstairs did not seem to justify despatch . She lingered and thought of '
92577	92649	92576	92576	Lohengrin	479	' and Albani , of the crowd of artistic friends that had escorted her to Waterloo , of the way in which she had been applauded the night before , of the joys of playing Brahms with a long - haired pupil of Rubinstein 's , who had dropped on one knee and kissed her hand at the end of it , etc . During the last six weeks the colours of '
92653	92858	92859	92859	She	2828	' had been freshening before her in marvellous fashion . And now , as she stood looking out , the quiet fields opposite , the sight of a cow pushing its head through the hedge , the infinite sunset sky , the quiet of the house , filled her with a sudden depression . How dull it all seemed — how wanting in the glow of life ! Meanwhile downstairs a curious little scene was passing , watched by Langham , who , in his usual anti - social way , had retreated into a corner of his own as soon as another visitor appeared . Beside Catherine sat a Ritualist clergyman in cassock and long cloak — a saint clearly , though perhaps , to judge from the slight restlessness of movement that seemed to quiver through him perpetually , an irritable one . But he had the saint 's wasted unearthly look , the ascetic brow high and narrow , the veins showing through the skin , and a personality as magnetic as it was strong . Catherine listened to the new - comer , and gave him his tea , with an aloofness of manner which was not lost on Langham . '
92870	92876	92859	92859	She	2828	' he said to himself . '
92895	93393	92859	92859	She	2828	' Elsmere apparently was not perfectly happy . He sat balancing his long person over the arm of a chair listening to the recital of some of the High Churchman 's parish troubles with a slight half - embarrassed smile . The vicar of Nottingham was always in trouble . The narrative he was pouring out took shape in Langham 's sarcastic sense as a sort of classical epic , with the High Churchman as a new champion of Christendom , harassed on all sides by pagan parishioners , crass churchwardens , and treacherous bishops . Catherine 's fine face grew more and more set , nay disdainful . Mr. Newcome was quite blind to it . Women never entered into his calculations except as sisters or as penitents . At a certain diocesan conference he had discovered a sympathetic fibre in the young rector of Murewell , which had been to the imperious persecuted zealot like water to the thirsty . He had come to - day , drawn by the same quality in Elsmere as had originally attracted Langham to the St. Anselm 's undergraduate , and he sat pouring himself out with as much freedom as if all his companions had been as ready as he was to die for an alb , or to spend half their days in piously circumventing a bishop . But presently the conversation had slid , no one knew how , from Nottingham and its intrigues to London and its teeming East . Robert was leading , his eye now on the apostolic - looking priest , now on his wife . Mr. Newcome resisted , but Robert had his way . Then it came out that behind these battles of kites and crows at Mottringham , there lay an heroic period , when the pale ascetic had wrestled ten years with London poverty , leaving health and youth and nerves behind him in the mêlée . Robert dragged it out at last , that struggle , into open view , but with difficulty . The Ritualist may glory in the discomfiture of an Erastian bishop — what Christian dare parade ten years of love to God and man ? And presently round Elsmere 's lip there dawned a little smile of triumph . Catherine had shaken off her cold silence , her Puritan aloofness , was bending forward eagerly — listening . Stroke by stroke , as the words and facts were beguiled from him , all that was futile and quarrelsome in the sharp - featured priest sank out of sight ; the face glowed with inward light ; the stature of the man seemed to rise ; the angel in him unsheathed its wings . Suddenly a story of the slums that Mr. Newcome was telling — a story of the purest Christian heroism told in the simplest way — came to an end , and Catherine leaned towards him with a long quivering breath . '
93412	93423	93397	93397	you	2830	' Mr. Newcome turned and looked at her with surprise . '
93431	93466	93397	93397	you	2830	' he said slowly — the story had been an account of the rescue of a young country lad from a London den of thieves and profligates—'you are right ; it was just that . '
93521	93560	93515	93516	Mr. Newcome	478	' He is coming back ? I am sorry for you , Elsmere . " Woe is me that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech , and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar ! " '
93602	93608	93610	93610	Robert	359	' I do n't know , '
93625	93664	93614	93614	he	359	' The squire is a man of strong character , of vast learning . His library is one of the finest in England , and it is at my service . I am not concerned with his opinions . '
93665	93671	93675	93675	his	478	' Ah , I see , '
93682	93700	93675	93675	his	478	' You are one of the people who believe in what you call tolerance — I remember . '
93701	93714	93716	93716	Robert	359	' Yes , that is an impeachment to which I plead guilty , '
93723	93737	93716	93716	Robert	359	' and you — have your worries driven you to throw tolerance overboard ? '
93760	93763	93764	93764	he	478	' Tolerance ! '
93828	93886	93929	93929	his	2837	' he drooped his voice , throwing out every word with a scornful , sibilant emphasis—'you would have us behave as though our friends were our enemies and our enemies our friends , as though eternal misery were a bagatelle and our faith a mere alternative . I stand for Christ , and His foes are mine . '
93887	93895	93897	93897	Robert	359	' By which I suppose you mean , '
93900	93919	93897	93897	Robert	359	' that you would shut your door on the writer of The Idols of the Market - place ? '
93920	93923	93929	93929	his	2837	' Certainly . '
93956	94018	94019	94019	Robert	359	' Certainly . Judge not — so long as a man has not judged himself,—only till then . As to an open enemy , the Christian 's path is clear . We are but soldiers under orders . What business have we to be truce - making on our own account ? The war is not ours , but God 's ! '
94130	94134	94135	94135	he	359	' To me , '
94152	94204	94135	94135	he	359	' a clergyman has enough to do with those foes of Christ he can not choose but recognise . There is no making truce with vice or cruelty . Why should we complicate our task and spend in needless struggle the energies we might give to love and to our brother ? '
94241	94247	94248	94248	he	478	' Wait , my friend , '
94252	94310	94248	94248	he	478	' till you have watched that man 's books eating the very heart out of a poor creature as I have . When you have once seen Christ robbed of a soul that might have been His , by the infidel of genius , you will loathe all this Laodicean ca nt of tolerance as I do ! '
94474	94479	94480	94480	he	478	' I must go , '

94507	94547	94548	94548	Elsmere	458	' He took a cold punctilious leave of Catherine , and a still colder and slighter leave of Langham . Elsmere accompanied him to the gate . On the way the older man suddenly caught him by the arm . '
94575	94643	94568	94568	My	0	' And the eagle face softened ; the harsh commanding presence became enveloping , magnetic . Robert paused and looked down upon him , a quick light of foresight in his eye . He felt what was coming . And down it swept upon him , a hurricane of words hot from Newcome 's inmost being , a protest winged by the gathered passion of years against certain '
94646	94690	94732	94732	God	304	' the elder priest discerned in the younger , against the worship of intellect and science as such which appeared in Elsmere 's talk , in Elsmere 's choice of friends . It was the eternal cry of the mystic of all ages . '
94695	94705	94706	94706	You	458	' Eyes and lips flashed into a vehement scorn . '
94834	94856	94857	94857	We	2852	' Robert was silent a moment , and they stood together , Newcome 's gaze of fiery appeal fixed upon him . '
94866	94876	94864	94864	I	0	' said the young rector at last with difficulty . '
94902	94909	94891	94891	God	304	' Newcome dropped his hold abruptly . '
94914	94920	94891	94891	God	304	' he said with harshness . '
95009	95092	95093	95093	You	2858	' Elsmere drew himself up suddenly ; the words seemed to him a blasphemy . Then something stayed the vehement answer on his lips . It was a sense of profound intolerable pity . What a maimed life ! what an indomitable soul ! Husbandhood , fatherhood , and all the sacred education that flows from human joy for ever self - forbidden , and this grim creed for recompense ! He caught Newcome 's hand with a kind of filial eagerness . '
95101	95108	95093	95093	You	2858	' he said , most gently . '
95161	95665	95150	95150	I	0	' A flush of something like sombre resentment passed over Newcome 's face . There is a tyrannical element in all fanaticism , an element which makes opposition a torment . He turned abruptly away , and Robert was left alone . It was a still clear evening , rich in the languid softness and balm which mark the first approaches of autumn . Elsmere walked back to the house , his head uplifted to the sky which lay beyond the cornfield , his whole being wrought into a passionate protest — a passionate invocation of all things beautiful and strong and free , a clinging to life and nature as to something wronged and outraged . Suddenly his wife stood beside him . She had come down to warn him that it was late and that Langham had gone to dress ; but she stood lingering by his side after her message was given , and he made no movement to go in . He turned to her , the exaltation gradually dying out of his face , and at last he stooped and kissed her with a kind of timidity unlike him . She clasped both hands on his arm and stood pressing towards him as though to make amends — for she knew not what . Something — some sharp momentary sense of difference , of antagonism , had hurt that inmost fibre which is the conscience of true passion . She did the most generous , the most ample penance for it as she stood there talking to him of half - indifferent things , but with a magic , a significance of eye and voice which seemed to take all the severity from her beauty and make her womanhood itself . At the evening meal Rose appeared in pale blue , and it seemed to Langham , fresh from the absolute seclusion of college rooms in vacation , that everything looked flat and stale beside her , beside the flash of her white arms , the gleam of her hair , the confident grace of every movement . He thought her much too self - conscious and self - satisfied ; and she certainly did not make herself agreeable to him ; but for all that he could hardly take his eyes off her ; and it occurred to him once or twice to envy Robert the easy childish friendliness she showed to him , and to him alone of the party . The lack of real sympathy between her and Catherine was evident to the stranger at once — what , indeed , could the two have in common ? He saw that Catherine was constantly on the point of blaming , and Rose constantly on the point of rebelling . He caught the wrinkling of Catherine 's brow as Rose presently , in emulation apparently of some acquaintances she had been making in London , let slip the names of some of her male friends without the '
95668	95986	95150	95150	I	0	' or launched into some bolder affectation than usual of a comprehensive knowledge of London society . The girl , in spite of all her beauty , and her fashion , and the little studied details of her dress , was in reality so crude , so much of a child under it all , that it made her audacities and assumptions the more absurd , and he could see that Robert was vastly amused by them . But Langham was not merely amused by her . She was too beautiful and too full of character . It astonished him to find himself afterwards edging over to the corner where she sat with the rectory cat on her knee — an inferior animal , but the best substitute for Chattie available . So it was , however ; and once in her neighbourhood he made another serious effort to get her to talk to him . The Elsmeres had never seen him so conversational . He dropped his paradoxical melancholy ; he roared as gently as any sucking dove ; and Robert , catching from the pessimist of St. Anselm 's , as the evening went on , some hesitating commonplaces worthy of a bashful undergraduate on the subject of the boats and Commemoration , had to beat a hasty retreat , so greatly did the situation tickle his sense of humour . But the tutor made his various ventures under a discouraging sense of failure . What a capricious ambiguous creature it was , how fearless , how disagreeably alive to all his own damaging peculiarities ! Never had he been so piqued for years , and as he floundered about trying to find some common ground where he and she might be at ease , he was conscious throughout of her mocking indifferent eyes , which seemed to be saying to him all the time , '
96022	96568	96013	96013	you	2861	' Long before the little party separated for the night Langham had given it up , and had betaken himself to Catherine , reminding himself with some sharpness that he had come down to study his friend 's life , rather than the humours of a provoking girl . How still the summer night was round the isolated rectory ; how fresh and spotless were all the appointments of the house ; what a Quaker neatness and refinement everywhere ! He drank in the scent of air and flowers with which the rooms were filled ; for the first time his fastidious sense was pleasantly conscious of Catherine 's grave beauty ; and even the mystic ceremonies of family prayer had a certain charm for him , pagan as he was . How much dignity and persuasiveness it has still , he thought to himself , this commonplace country life of ours , on its best sides ! Half - past ten arrived . Rose just let him touch her hand ; Catherine gave him a quiet good - night , with various hospitable wishes for his nocturnal comfort , and the ladies withdrew . He saw Robert open the door for his wife , and catch her thin white fingers as she passed him with all the secrecy and passion of a lover . Then they plunged into the study , he and Robert , and smoked their fill . The study was an astonishing medley . Books , natural history specimens , a half - written sermon , fishing - rods , cricket - bats , a huge medicine cupboard — all the main elements of Elsmere 's new existence were represented there . In the drawing - room with his wife and his sister - in - law he had been as much of a boy as ever ; here clearly he was a man , very much in earnest . What about ? What did it all come to ? Can the English country clergyman do much with his life and his energies ? Langham approached the subject with his usual scepticism . Robert for a while , however , did not help him to solve it . He fell at once to talking about the squire , as though it cleared his mind to talk out his difficulties even to so ineffective a counsellor as Langham . Langham , indeed , was but faintly interested in the squire 's crimes as a landlord , but there was a certain interest to be got out of the struggle in Elsmere 's mind between the attractiveness of the squire , as one of the most difficult and original personalities of English letters , and that moral condemnation of him as a man of possessions and ordinary human responsibilities with which the young reforming rector was clearly penetrated . So that , as long as he could smoke under it , he was content to let his companion describe to him Mr. Wendover 's connection with the property , his accession to it in middle life after a long residence in Germany , his ineffectual attempts to play the English country gentleman , and his subsequent complete withdrawal from the life about him . '
96586	96592	96593	96593	He	2863	' said Robert with energy . '
96744	96745	96740	96740	nobody	8566	' '
96764	96765	96757	96757	she	2878	' '
96772	96780	96757	96757	she	2878	' said the rector with a shrug , '
96972	97031	96969	96970	the squire	9352	' And the rector , having laid down his pipe , took to studying his boots with a certain dolefulness . Langham , however , who always treated the subjects of conversation presented to him as an epicure treats foods , felt at this point that he had had enough of the Wendovers , and started something else . '
97041	97051	97052	97052	I	0	' he said , pointing to the medicine cupboard . '
97057	97065	97052	97052	I	0	' cried Robert , brightening at once . '
97133	97170	97171	97171	I	0	' And the rector reached out his hand again for his pipe , and gave one or two energetic puffs to it as he surveyed his friend stretched before him in the depths of an armchair . '
97187	97188	97184	97184	their	1229	' '
97194	97200	97184	97184	their	1229	' said Langham , musing , '
97216	97217	97211	97211	they	1086	' '
97252	97253	97259	97259	Darwin	485	' '
97261	97293	97259	97259	Darwin	485	' said Langham meditatively , taking up Darwin 's Earthworms , which lay on the study table beside him , side by side with a volume of Grant Allen 's Sketches . '
97306	97324	97327	97327	Langham	464	' Robert did not answer for a moment , and a faint flush stole into his face . '
97329	97334	97327	97327	Langham	464	' he said presently , '
97413	97414	97539	97539	you	2908	' '
97417	97427	97539	97539	you	2908	' said Langham ; and could not forbear adding , '
97449	97510	97539	97539	you	2908	' In general these two kept carefully off the religious ground . The man who is religious by nature tends to keep his treasure hid from the man who is critical by nature , and Langham was much more interested in other things . But still it had always been understood that each was free to say what he would . '
97517	97529	97539	97539	you	2908	' said Robert , throwing back his head at the challenge . '
97609	97659	97601	97601	God	304	' Langham said nothing . It had seemed to him for long that the clergy were becoming dangerously ready to throw the Old Testament overboard , and all that it appeared to him to imply was that men 's logical sense is easily benumbed where their hearts are concerned . '
97672	97685	97601	97601	God	304	' resumed Robert after a while , going back to his pipe . '
97718	97735	97711	97711	her	1204	' His voice altered as he mentioned his wife — grew extraordinarily soft , even reverential . '
97741	97757	97711	97711	her	1204	' said Langham interrogatively , and inwardly conscious of pursuing investigations begun a year before . '
97818	98644	97803	97803	I	0	' The young husband 's face seemed to gleam in the dim light which fell upon it . Langham involuntarily put up his hand in silence and touched his sleeve . Robert gave him a quiet friendly look , and the two men instantly plunged into some quite trivial and commonplace subject . Langham entered his room that night with a renewed sense of pleasure in the country quiet , the peaceful flower - scented house . Catherine , who was an admirable housewife , had put out her best guest - sheets for his benefit , and the tutor , accustomed for long years to the second - best of college service , looked at their shining surfaces and frilled edges , at the freshly matted floor , at the flowers on the dressing - table , at the spotlessness of everything in the room , with a distinct sense that matrimony had its advantages . He had come down to visit the Elsmeres , sustained by a considerable sense of virtue . He still loved Elsmere and cared to see him . It was a much colder love , no doubt , than that which he had given to the undergraduate . But the man altogether was a colder creature , who for years had been drawing in tentacle after tentacle , and becoming more and more content to live without his kind . Robert 's parsonage , however , and Robert 's wife had no attractions for him ; and it was with an effort that he had made up his mind to accept the invitation which Catherine had made an effort to write . And , after all , the experience promised to be pleasant . His fastidious love for the quieter , subtler sorts of beauty was touched by the Elsmere surroundings . And whatever Miss Leyburn might be , she was not commonplace . The demon of convention had no large part in her ! Langham lay awake for a time analysing his impressions of her with some gusto , and meditating , with a whimsical candour which seldom tailed him , on the manner in which she had trampled on him , and the reasons why . He woke up , however , in a totally different frame of mind . He was pre - eminently a person of moods , dependent , probably , as all moods are , on certain obscure physical variations . And his mental temperature had run down in the night . The house , the people who had been fresh and interesting to him twelve hours before , were now the burden he had more than half expected them to be . He lay and thought of the unbroken solitude of his college rooms , of Senancour 's flight from human kind , of the uselessness of all friendship , the absurdity of all effort , and could hardly persuade himself to get up and face a futile world , which had , moreover , the enormous disadvantage for the moment of being a new one . Convention , however , is master even of an Obermann . That prototype of all the disillusioned had to cut himself adrift from the society of the eagles on the Dent du Midi , to go and hang like any other ridiculous mortal on the Paris law - courts . Langham , whether he liked it or no , had to face the parsonic breakfast and the parsonic day . He had just finished dressing when the sound of a girl 's voice drew him to the window , which was open . In the garden stood Rose , on the edge of the sunk fence dividing the rectory domain from the cornfield . She was stooping forward playing with Robert 's Dandie Dinmont . In one hand she held a mass of poppies , which showed a vivid scarlet against her blue dress ; the other was stretched out seductively to the dog leaping round her . A crystal buckle flashed at her waist ; the sunshine caught the curls of auburn hair , the pink cheek , the white moving hand , the lace ruffles at her throat and wrist . The lithe glittering figure stood thrown out against the heavy woods behind , the gold of the cornfield , the blues of the distance . All the gaiety and colour which is as truly representative of autumn as the gray languor of a September mist had passed into it . Langham stood and watched , hidden , as he thought , by the curtain , till a gust of wind shook the casement window beside him , and threatened to blow it in upon him . He put out his hand perforce to save it , and the slight noise caught Rose 's ear . She looked up ; her smile vanished . '
98650	99049	97803	97803	I	0	' she said severely , and walked quickly into the house with as much dignity as nineteen is capable of . At breakfast the Elsmeres found their guest a difficulty . But they also , as we know , had expected it . He was languor itself ; none of their conversational efforts succeeded ; and Rose , studying him out of the corners of her eyes , felt that it would be of no use even to torment so strange and impenetrable a being . Why on earth should people come and visit their friends if they could not keep up even the ordinary decent pretences of society ? Robert had to go off to some clerical business afterwards , and Langham wandered out into the garden by himself . As he thought of his Greek texts and his untenanted Oxford rooms , he had the same sort of craving that an opium - eater has cut off from his drugs . How was he to get through ? Presently he walked back into the study , secured an armful of volumes , and carried them out . True to himself in the smallest things , he could never in his life be content with the companionship of one book . To cut off the possibility of choice and change in anything whatever was repugnant to him . He sat himself down under the shade of a great chestnut near the house , and an hour glided pleasantly away . As it happened , however , he did not open one of the books he had brought with him . A thought had struck him as he sat down , and he went groping in his pockets in search of a yellow - covered brochure , which , when found , proved to be a new play by Dumas , just about to be produced by a French company in London . Langham , whose passion for the French theatre supplied him , as we know , with a great deal of life without the trouble of living , was going to see it , and always made a point of reading the piece beforehand . The play turned upon a typical French situation , treated in a manner rather more French than usual . The reader shrugged his shoulders a good deal as he read on . '
99053	99064	97803	97803	I	0	' he muttered to himself after an act or two . '
99072	99235	97803	97803	I	0	' Presently , just as the fifth act was beginning to get hold of him with that force which , after all , only a French playwright is master of , he looked up and saw the two sisters coming round the corner of the house from the great kitchen garden , which stretched its grass paths and tangled flower - masses down the further slope of the hill . The transition was sharp from Dumas 's heated atmosphere of passion and crime to the quiet English rectory , its rural surroundings , and the figures of the two Englishwomen advancing towards him . Catherine was in a loose white dress with a black lace scarf draped about her head and form . Her look hardly suggested youth , and there was certainly no touch of age in it . Ripeness , maturity , serenity — these were the chief ideas which seemed to rise in the mind at sight of her . '
99244	99267	99237	99237	you	2916	' she said , stopping beside him and retaining with slight imperceptible force Rose 's hand , which threatened to slip away . '
99292	99331	99332	99332	You	2916	' Rose turned involuntarily . Not wishing to discuss Marianne with either Catherine or her sister , Langham had just closed the book and was returning it to his pocket . But she had caught sight of it . '
99337	99351	99332	99332	You	2916	' she exclaimed , the slightest possible touch of wonder in her tone . '
99358	99415	99356	99356	Marianne	355	' said Langham , surprised in his turn . He had very old - fashioned notions about the limits of a girl 's acquaintance with the world , knowing nothing , therefore , as may be supposed , about the modern young woman , and he was a trifle scandalised by Rose 's accent of knowledge . '
99422	99427	99416	99416	I	0	' she said carelessly ; '
99453	99454	99444	99444	Desforêts	492	' '
99459	99504	99505	99505	Dumas	490	' asked Catherine innocently . The theatre not only gave her little pleasure , but wounded in her a hundred deep unconquerable instincts . But she had long ago given up in despair the hope of protesting against Rose 's dramatic instincts with success . '
99508	99536	99505	99505	Dumas	490	' said Langham drily . He was distinctly a good deal astonished . Rose looked at him , and something brought a sudden flame into her cheek . '
99546	99551	99552	99552	I	0	' she said defiantly . '
99591	99605	99578	99578	she	492	' All this , of course , with the delicate nose well in air .
99606	99614	99616	99616	Langham	464	' You were introduced to Madame Desforêts ? '
99680	99684	99686	99686	Rose	369	' I was , '
99689	99704	99686	99686	Rose	369	' Other people may think it a disgrace . I thought it an honour ! '
99736	99744	99746	99746	Catherine	458	' Rose , you do n't know ! '
99760	99778	99746	99746	Catherine	458	' I do n't think Mrs. Pierson ought to have done that , without consulting mamma especially . '
99779	99783	99785	99785	Rose	369	' Why not ? '
99813	99817	99818	99818	she	369	' I think , '
99829	99883	99885	99886	the speaker	920	' that the way in which all sorts of stories are believed against a woman , just because she is an actress , is disgraceful ! Just because a woman is on the stage , everybody thinks they may throw stones at her . I know , because — because she told me , '
99898	99960	99885	99886	the speaker	920	' that she feels the things that are said of her deeply ! She has been ill , very ill , and one of her friends said to me , " You know it is n't her work , or a cold , or anything else that 's made her ill — it 's calumny ! " And so it is . '
100080	100091	100092	100092	they	2927	' What a child , what an infant it is ! '
100211	100219	100220	100220	she	458	' At any rate , Mr. Langham , '

100822	100964	100762	100762	she	369	' fragments from a wild and alien dance - music , they rippled over him in a warm intoxicating stream of sound , stirring association after association , and rousing from sleep a hundred bygone moods of feeling . What magic and mastery in the girl 's touch ! What power of divination , and of rendering ! Ah ! she too was floating in passion and romance , but of a different sort altogether from the conscious reflected product of the man 's nature . She was not thinking of the past , but of the future ; she was weaving her story that was to be into the flying notes , playing to the unknown of her Whindale dreams , the strong ardent unknown,—'insufferable , if he pleases , to all the world besides , but to me heaven ! '
101073	101083	101084	101084	she	369	' I had no notion you cared for music , '

101808	101818	101820	101820	Robert	359	' But catch that man doing anything for us ! '
101823	101848	101820	101820	Robert	359	' He will hardly mend the roof now , merely , I believe , to spite me . But come and see my new Naturalists '
101851	101927	101820	101820	Robert	359	' And he opened the Institute door . Langham followed in the temper of one getting up a subject for examination . Poor Robert ! His labour and his enthusiasm deserved a more appreciative eye . He was wrapped up in his Club , which had been the great success of his first year , and he dragged Langham through it all , not indeed , sympathetic creature that he was , without occasional qualms . '
101932	101940	101941	101941	I	0	' he would say to himself indignantly , '
101948	102236	101941	101941	I	0	' Langham , indeed , behaved with resignation . He looked at the collections for the year , and was quite ready to take it for granted that they were extremely creditable . Into the old - fashioned window - sills glazed compartments had been fitted , and these were now fairly filled with specimens , with eggs , butterflies , moths , beetles , fossils , and what not . A case of stuffed tropical birds presented by Robert stood in the centre of the room ; another containing the birds of the district was close by . On a table farther on stood two large open books , which served as records of observations on the part of members of the Club . In one , which was scrawled over with mysterious hieroglyphs , any one might write what he would . In the other , only such facts and remarks as had passed the gauntlet of a Club meeting were recorded in Robert 's neatest hand . On the same table stood jars full of strange creatures — tadpoles and water larvæ of all kinds , over which Robert hung now absorbed , poking among them with a straw , while Langham , to whom only the generalisations of science were congenial , stood by and mildly scoffed . As they came out a great loutish boy , who had evidently been hanging about waiting for the rector , came up to him , boorishly touched his cap , and then , taking a cardboard box out of his pocket , opened it with infinite caution , something like a tremor of emotion passing over his gnarled countenance . The rector 's eyes glistened . '
102269	102372	102373	102374	Lucky dog	2982	' And the two plunged back into the Club together , leaving Langham to the philosophic and patient contemplation of the village green , its geese , its donkeys , and its surrounding fringe of houses . He felt that quite indisputably life would have been better worth living if , like Robert , he could have taken a passionate interest in rare moths or common ploughboys ; but Nature having denied him the possibility , there was small use in grumbling . Presently the two naturalists came out again , and the boy went off , bearing his treasure with him . '
102376	102393	102394	102394	he	2982	' said Robert , turning his friend into a country road leading out of the village , '
102442	102467	102433	102433	I	0	' And he turned to his friend with a laugh , and yet with a little quick look of feeling in the gray eyes . '
102474	102479	102480	102480	I	0	' said Langham drily . '
102493	102494	102480	102480	I	0	' '

102967	103015	103088	103088	You	3019	' The speaker threw back his head impulsively , as though defying his own feeling . Langham looked at him curiously . The pastoral temper was a novelty to him , and the strong development of it in the undergraduate of his Oxford recollections had its interest . '
103021	103051	103088	103088	You	3019	' said Robert , as on their return from their walk they were descending a low - wooded hill above the village , and the church clock rang out . '

103096	103103	103104	103104	I	0	' Robert laughed a trifle bitterly . '
103113	103125	103104	103104	I	0	' he said , thrusting his hands far into his pockets . '
103263	103287	103262	103262	you	3027	're a purist about your Scott ! None other of the immortals have such longueurs as he , and we cut him freely . '
103288	103293	103295	103295	Langham	464	' By all means , '
103297	103301	103295	103295	Langham	464	' lead on . '
103631	103640	103647	103647	Robert	357	' adequate and masterly expression of one 's self '
104042	104052	104053	104054	His friend	9433	' where men sit and hear each other groan . '
104087	104095	104113	104113	Elsmere	359	' said the dreaming spectator to himself , '
104154	104317	104128	104129	A man	1055	' In the evening Langham , with the usual reaction of his afternoon self against his morning self , felt that wild horses should not take him to Church again , and , with a longing for something purely mundane , he stayed at home with a volume of Montaigne , while apparently all the rest of the household went to evening service . After a warm day the evening had turned cold and stormy ; the west was streaked with jagged strips of angry cloud , the wind was rising in the trees , and the temperature had suddenly fallen so much that when Langham shut himself up in Robert 's study he did what he had been admonished to do in case of need , set a light to the fire , which blazed out merrily into the darkening room . Then he drew the curtains and threw himself down into Robert 's chair with a sigh of Sybaritic satisfaction . '
104330	104336	104128	104129	A man	1055	' he said to himself ; '
104345	104366	104128	104129	A man	1055	' He opened his Montaigne and read on very happily for half an hour . The house seemed entirely deserted . '
104373	104383	104128	104129	A man	1055	' he said presently , looking up and listening . '
104402	104476	104395	104395	I	0	' And he plunged back again into his book . At last there was a sound of the swing door which separated Robert 's passage from the front hall opening and shutting . Steps came quickly towards the study , the handle was turned , and there on the threshold stood Rose . He turned quickly round in his chair with a look of astonishment . She also started as she saw him . '
104486	104498	104499	104499	I	0	' she said awkwardly , the colour spreading over her face . '
104507	104567	104499	104499	I	0	' She made a delicious picture as she stood framed in the darkness of the doorway ; her long dress caught up round her in one hand , the other resting on the handle . A gust of some delicate perfume seemed to enter the room with her , and a thrill of pleasure passed through Langham 's senses . '
104575	104622	104569	104569	I	0	' he said , springing up . She hesitated a moment , then apparently made up her mind that it would be foolish to retreat , and , coming forward , she said , with an accent as coldly polite as she could make it , — '
104637	104681	104629	104629	I	0	' She went up to the shelves where Robert kept his novels , and began running her fingers over the books , with slightly knitted brows and a mouth severely shut . Langham , still standing , watched her and presently stepped forward . '
104690	104694	104697	104697	me	0	' he said ; '
104699	104711	104697	104697	me	0	' He was already beside her , and she gave way . '
104717	104724	104712	104712	I	0	' she said , still forbiddingly . '

104752	104771	104772	104772	Robert	359	' and he ran over the shelves with the practised eye of one accustomed to deal with books . '
104778	104787	104772	104772	Robert	359	' said Rose , with a little sigh . '
104798	104806	104772	104772	Robert	359	' and she was already moving away . '
104812	104823	104772	104772	Robert	359	' he said , smiling , his arm still upstretched . '
104831	104855	104856	104856	He	359	' His manner had an animation and ease usually quite foreign to it . Rose stopped , and her lips relaxed a little . '

104939	104955	104934	104934	you	359	' said Rose , obeying an irresistible impulse , and biting her lip the moment afterwards .
104956	104978	104979	104979	he	359	' Do you think that we poor people at Oxford are always condemned to works on the " enclitic δέ " ? '
105096	105103	105104	105104	she	369	' I know nothing of Oxford , '
105116	105133	105134	105134	she	369	' I never was there — but I never was anywhere , I have seen nothing , '
105146	105159	105160	105160	he	359	' Except London , and the great world , and Madame Desforêts ! '
105165	105171	105172	105172	She	369	' Is that so little ? '
105211	105216	105218	105218	Langham	464	' Do you know , '
105222	105239	105218	105218	Langham	464	' that you are standing in a draught , and that it has turned extremely cold ? '
105281	105286	105288	105288	Rose	369	' So it has , '
105292	105312	105288	105288	Rose	369	' I do n't envy the Church people . You have n't found me a book , Mr. Langham ? '
105313	105334	105335	105335	he	359	' I will find you one in a minute , if you will come and read it by the fire , '
105402	105411	105386	105386	she	369	' Find me an exciting one , please . '
105595	105601	105602	105602	he	464	' I am so sorry ! '
105605	105624	105602	105602	he	464	' Coals never do what you want them to do . Are you very much interested in Villette ? '
105625	105628	105630	105630	Rose	369	' Deeply , '
105724	105739	105740	105740	she	369	' Charlotte Brontë wrote it out of her Brussels experience , did n't she ? '
105744	105767	105740	105740	she	369	' How sorry she must have been to come back to that dull home and that awful brother after such a break ! '
105768	105785	105787	105787	Langham	464	' There were reasons more than one that must have made her sorry to come back , '
105790	105817	105787	105787	Langham	464	' But how she pined for her wilds all through ! I am afraid you do n't find your wilds as interesting as she found hers ? '
105899	105912	105913	105913	she	369	' No , I do n't find my wilds interesting at all , '
105917	105930	105913	105913	she	369	' You are not fond of the people as your sister is ? '
105931	105936	105938	105938	Rose	369	' Fond of them ? '
105941	106009	105938	105938	Rose	369	' I should think not ; and what is more , they do n't like me . It is quite intolerable since Catherine left . I have so much more to do with them . My other sister and I have to do all her work . It is dreadful to have to work after somebody who has a genius for doing just what you do worst . '
106119	106133	106134	106134	he	464	' Your sister , I suppose , has been always happy in charity ? '
106137	106143	106145	106145	Rose	369	' Oh dear , yes , '
106148	106168	106145	106145	Rose	369	' anything that has two legs and is ill , that is all Catherine wants to make her happy . '
106169	106181	106182	106182	he	464	' And you want something quite different , something more exciting ? '
106228	106236	106237	106237	she	369	' Yes , I want something different , '
106260	106305	106252	106252	she	369	' But it is not idleness I want . I want to work , but at things I was born for ; I ca n't have patience with old women , but I could slave all day and all night to play the violin . '
106306	106322	106323	106323	he	464	' You want to give yourself up to study then , and live with musicians ? '
106407	106418	106419	106419	she	369	' But it is all so difficult , you see , '
106423	106473	106419	106419	she	369	' Papa thought it wicked to care about anything except religion . If he had lived , of course I should never have been allowed to study music . It has been all mutiny so far , every bit of it , whatever I have been able to do . '
106474	106483	106485	106485	Langham	464	' He would have changed with the times , '
106487	106493	106495	106495	Rose	369	' I know he would , '
106497	106526	106527	106527	She	369	' I have told Catherine so a hundred times . People — good people — think quite differently about art now , do n't they , Mr. Langham ? '
106555	106564	106565	106565	he	464	' They call it the handmaid of religion , '
106576	106581	106582	106582	she	369	' I should n't , '
106589	106663	106665	106665	she	369	' But then there 's something else . You know where we live — at the very ends of the earth , seven miles from a station , in the very loneliest valley of all Westmoreland . What 's to be done with a fiddle in such a place ? Of course , ever since papa died I 've just been plotting and planning to get away . But there 's the difficulty , '
106679	106745	106747	106748	the child	1430	' That house where we live has been lived in by Leyburns ever since — the Flood ! Horrid set they were , I know , because I ca n't ever make mamma or even Catherine talk about them . But still , when papa retired , he came back and bought the old place from his brother . Such a dreadful , dreadful mistake ! '
106758	106766	106747	106748	the child	1430	' Had he been so happy there ? '
106767	106774	106775	106776	His brothers	3094	' Happy!'—and Rose 's lip curled . '
106837	106857	106831	106831	him	3093	' And again looking despondently into the fire she pondered that far - off perversity of her father 's . '
106863	106882	106884	106884	they	3098	' said Langham , seized as he spoke by the pensive prettiness of the bent head and neck , '
106892	106893	106897	106897	they	3098	' '
106901	106906	106897	106897	they	3098	' she said irritably . '
107006	107013	106978	106978	he	3093	' Then she broke off suddenly . '
107018	107032	107036	107036	he	3093	' she went on wistfully , raising her beautiful eyes to her companion , '
107043	107047	107036	107036	he	3093	' Langham smiled . '
107054	107058	107048	107048	I	0	' he said . '
107231	107236	107237	107237	he	3093	' Poor little naughty child '
107245	107259	107237	107237	he	3093	' I think your father must have been a man to be loved . '
107279	107403	107270	107270	her	2431	' Oh , so he was — so he was ! If he had been hard and ugly to us , why , it would have been much easier for me ; but he was so good ! And there was Catherine just like him , always preaching to us what he wished . You see what a chain it 's been — what a weight ! And as I must struggle — must , because I was I — to get back into the world on the other side of the mountains , and do what all the dear wicked people there were doing , why , I have been a criminal all my life ! And that is n't exhilarating always . '
107425	107442	107443	107443	he	3113	' I wish your father could have heard you play as I heard you play yesterday , '
107450	107459	107447	107447	She	3112	' Did you hear me — that Wagner ? '
107476	107495	107465	107465	She	3112	' Do you want to know what I thought ? I have heard much music , you know . '
107508	107522	107496	107496	He	3113	' I am not quite the mummy you thought me , after all ! '
107528	107567	107524	107524	she	3112	' I have heard every violinist of any fame in Europe play , and play often ; and it seemed to me that with time — and work — you might play as well as any of them . '
107598	107606	107607	107607	he	3113	' And I ca n't help thinking , '
107627	107675	107607	107607	he	3113	' that if your father had lived till now , and had gone with the times a little , as he must have gone , he would have learnt to take pleasure in your pleasure , and to fit your gift somehow into his scheme of things . '
107676	107685	107687	107687	Rose	369	' Catherine has n't moved with the times , '
107716	107721	107722	107722	she	3115	' And you think , '
107726	107849	107722	107722	she	3115	' you really think , without being too ungrateful to papa , and too unkind to the old Leyburn ghosts'—and a little laugh danced through the vibrating voice—'I might try and get them to give up Burwood — I might struggle to have my way ? I shall , of course I shall ! I never was a meek martyr , and never shall be . But one ca n't help having qualms , though one does n't tell them to one 's sisters and cousins and aunts . And sometimes'—she turned her chin round on her hand and looked at him with a delicious shy impulsiveness—'sometimes a stranger sees clearer . Do you think me a monster , as Catherine does ? '
107998	108002	108003	108003	she	3116	' Tell me , '
108028	108081	108003	108003	she	3116	' The harsh noise of an opening door in the distance , and a gust of wind sweeping through the house , voices and steps approaching .

108089	108121	108087	108087	Robert	359	' she exclaimed , as the study door opened , and Robert 's wind - blown head and tall form , wrapped in an Inverness cape , appeared on the threshold . '

108130	108145	108146	108146	She	458	' said Robert , the slightest gleam of surprise betraying itself on his face . '
108168	108169	108146	108146	She	458	' '
108181	108185	108170	108170	You	3117	' asked Rose . '

108206	108262	108197	108197	she	458	' He went out again into the passage to hang up his greatcoat . She followed , longing to tell him that it was pure accident that took her to the study , but she could not find words in which to do it , and could only say good - night a little abruptly . '
108269	108279	108197	108197	she	458	' said Robert , re - entering the study . '

108296	108315	108281	108281	you	3117	' said Langham , smiling , his arm behind his head , his eyes fixed on the blaze ; '
108326	108462	108317	108317	I	0	' Catherine stopped beside the drawing - room window with a start , caught by something she saw outside . It was nothing , however , but the figures of Rose and Langham strolling round the garden . A bystander would have been puzzled by the sudden knitting of Catherine 's brows over it . Rose held a red parasol , which gleamed against the trees ; Dandie leapt about her , but she was too busy talking to take much notice of him . Talking , chattering , to that cold cynic of a man , for whom only yesterday she had scarcely had a civil word ! Catherine felt herself a prey to all sorts of vague unreasonable alarms . Robert had said to her the night before , with an odd look : '
108507	108507	108493	108493	Langham	464	'
108755	108773	108720	108720	She	458	' meeting to be held that afternoon . Rose , who was supposed by the family to be '
108776	108899	108900	108900	You	458	' of her sister at a critical time , had a moment 's prick of conscience , and went off with a good grace . Langham felt vaguely that he owed Mrs. Elsmere another grudge , but he resigned himself and took out a cigarette , wherewith to console himself for the loss of his companion . Presently , as he stood for a moment turning over some new books on the drawing - room table , Rose came in . She held an armful of blue serge , and , going up to a table in the window , she took from it a little work - case , and was about to vanish again when Langham went up to her . '
108905	108913	108900	108900	You	458	' he said to her , discontentedly . '
108929	108944	108900	108900	You	458	' she answered demurely , with a countenance of most Dorcas - like seriousness , '
108959	108980	108900	108900	You	458	' He shrugged his shoulders and looked at her , smiling , still master of himself and of his words . '
109000	109001	109002	109002	You	0	' '
109005	109011	109002	109002	You	0	' she exclaimed , incredulous . '
109015	109038	109013	109013	me	0	' The light of his fine black eyes seemed to encompass her . She moved backward a little , shaking her head . '
109043	109047	109091	109091	she	458	' she said . '
109101	109101	109091	109091	she	458	'
109102	109119	109120	109120	he	0	' And not this afternoon , for Robert and I go fishing . But this evening ? '
109161	109204	109151	109151	Elsmere	359	' Come and see the Hall , old fellow . It will be our last chance , for the squire and his sister come back this afternoon . I must parochialise a bit afterwards , but you sha n't be much victimised . '
110083	110086	110088	110088	sir	1246	' Oh lor '
110098	110165	110088	110088	sir	1246	' From the drawing - rooms , full of a more modern and less poetical magnificence , where Langham turned restless and refractory , Elsmere with a smile took his guest silently back into the hall , and opened a carved door behind a curtain . Passing through , they found themselves in a long passage lighted by small windows on the left - hand side . '
110172	110176	110088	110088	sir	1246	' said Robert , '
110232	110658	110792	110792	he	8701	' For half - way down the passage the ceiling seemed to descend upon their heads , the flooring became uneven and woodwork and walls showed that they had passed from the Jacobean house into the much older Tudor building . Presently Robert led the way up a few shallow steps , pushed open a heavy door , also covered by curtains , and bade his companion enter . They found themselves in a low immense room , running at right angles to the passage they had just quitted . The long diamond - paned window , filling almost half of the opposite wall , faced the door by which they had come in ; the heavy carved mantelpiece was to their right ; an open doorway on their left , closed at present by tapestry hangings , seemed to lead into yet other rooms . The walls of this one were completely covered from floor to ceiling with latticed bookcases , enclosed throughout in a frame of oak carved in light classical relief by what appeared to be a French hand of the sixteenth century . The chequered bindings of the books , in which the creamy tints of vellum predominated , lined the whole surface of the wall with a delicate sobriety of colour ; over the mantelpiece , the picture of the founder of the house — a Holbein portrait , glorious in red robes and fur and golden necklace — seemed to gather up and give voice to all the dignity and impressiveness of the room beneath him ; while on the window side the book - lined wall was , as it were , replaced by the wooded face of a hill , clothed in dark lines of trimmed yews , which rose abruptly about a hundred yards from the house and overshadowed the whole library wing . Between the window and the hill , however , was a small old English garden , closely hedged round with yew hedges , and blazing now with every flower that an English August knows — with sun - flowers , tiger - lilies , and dahlias white and red . The window was low , so that the flowers seemed to be actually in the room , challenging the pale tints of the books , the tawny browns and blues of the Persian carpet , and the scarlet splendours of the courtier over the mantelpiece . The room was lit up besides by a few gleaming casts from the antique , by the '
110661	110751	110792	110792	he	8701	' of the Louvre , by the Hermes of Praxiteles smiling with immortal kindness on the child enthroned upon his arm , and by a Donatello figure of a woman in marble , its subtle sweet austerity contrasting with the Greek frankness and blitheness of its companions . Langham was penetrated at once by the spell of this strange and beautiful place . The fastidious instincts which had been half revolted by the costly accumulations , the overblown splendours of the drawing - room , were abundantly satisfied here . '
110757	110765	110792	110792	he	8701	' he said , looking round him , '
110778	110779	110767	110768	that man	8701	' '
110784	110788	110767	110768	that man	8701	' said Robert ; '
110842	110864	110828	110828	Langham	464	' And he turned the key of a particular section of the wall , which was not only latticed but glazed . '
110971	111232	111261	111261	they	3201	' Langham took the volumes reverently from Robert 's hands into his own , the scholar 's passion hot within him . That glazed case was indeed a storehouse of treasures . Ben Jonson 's Underwoods with his own corrections ; a presentation copy of Andrew Marvell 's Poems , with autograph notes ; manuscript volumes of letters , containing almost every famous name known to English literature in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the literary cream , in fact , of all the vast collection which filled the muniment room upstairs ; books which had belonged to Addison , to Sir William Temple , to Swift , to Horace Walpole ; the first four folios of Shakespeare , all perfect , and most of the quartos — everything that the heart of the English collector could most desire was there . And the charm of it was that only a small proportion of these precious things represented conscious and deliberate acquisition . The great majority of them had , as it were , drifted thither one by one , carried there by the tide of English letters as to a warm and natural resting - place . But Robert grew impatient , and hurried on his guest to other things — to the shelves of French rarities , ranging from Du Bellay 's Visions , with his autograph , down to the copy of Les Mémoires d'Outre - Tombe presented by Chateaubriand to Madame Récamier , or to a dainty manuscript volume in the fine writing of Lamartine . '
111235	111239	111261	111261	they	3201	' Robert explained , '
111314	111332	111334	111339	the old doctor of the house	3204	' said Robert , laying down the book he held , and speaking in a lower key , '

111375	111376	111377	111377	Mania	522	' '
111379	111384	111377	111377	Mania	522	' said Robert quietly . '
111387	111396	111377	111377	Mania	522	' said the other , lifting his eyebrows . '
111407	111408	111377	111377	Mania	522	' '
111445	111453	111440	111440	I	0	' said Robert , his lip hardening , '

111621	111656	111610	111612	a decent agent	3216	' said Langham , who was , however , so deep in a collection of Spanish romances and chronicles that the squire 's mental history did not seem to make much impression upon him . '
111669	111680	111664	111664	I	0	' he added , with a sudden and fretful emphasis , '
111720	111745	111751	111751	I	0	' And he held up a couple of priceless books , of which the Spanish sheepskin bindings showed traces here and there of moisture . '
111767	111774	111775	111775	I	0	' said Robert with a shrug . '
111846	111943	111947	111947	I	0	' Langham reluctantly allowed himself to be dragged away . Robert held back the hangings over the doorway leading into the rest of the wing , and , passing through , they found themselves in a continuation of the library totally different in character from the magnificent room they had just left . The walls were no longer latticed and carved ; they were closely packed , in the most business - like way , with books which represented the squire 's own collection , and were in fact a chart of his own intellectual history . '
111952	111960	111947	111947	I	0	' said Robert , looking round it . '
111979	112006	111947	111947	I	0	' and he pulled out a volume of St. Basil . Langham looked , and saw on the title - page a note in faded characters : '
112018	112019	111947	111947	I	0	' '
112031	112043	112045	112045	Langham	464	' 45 ; he must have left them very soon after , '
112051	112093	112048	112048	Robert	359	' But look at them ! There are the Tracts , all the Fathers , all the Councils , and masses , as you see , of Anglican theology . Now look at the next case , nothing but eighteenth century ! '
112094	112116	111947	111947	I	0	' I see,—from the Fathers to the Philosophers , from Hooker to Hume . How history repeats itself in the individual ! '
112117	112122	112124	112124	Robert	359	' And there again , '
112135	112147	112124	112124	Robert	359	' are the results of his life as a German student . '
112148	112162	112048	112048	Robert	359	' Germany — ah , I remember ! How long was he there ? '
112163	112226	112048	112048	Robert	359	' Ten years , at Berlin and Heidelberg . According to old Meyrick , he buried his last chance of living like other men at Berlin . His years of extravagant labour there have left marks upon him physically that can never be effaced . But that bookcase fascinates me . Half the great names of modern thought are in those books . '

112715	112721	112722	112722	he	359	' This is my corner , '
112739	112755	112722	112722	he	359	' Perhaps you do n't know that I too am engaged upon a great work . '
112756	112763	112764	112764	Langham	464	' A great work — you ? '
112882	113050	113051	113051	Langham	464	' Well , Grey is responsible . He gave me such a homily before I left Oxford on the absolute necessity of keeping up with books , that I could do nothing less than set up a " subject " at once . " Half the day , " he used to say to me , " you will be king of your world ; the other half be the slave of something which will take you out of your world into the general world ; " and then he would quote to me that saying he was always bringing into lectures — I forget whose it is—"The decisive events of the world take place in the intellect . It is the mission of books that they help one to remember it . " Altogether it was striking , coming from one who has always had such a tremendous respect for practical life and work , and I was much impressed by it . So blame him ! '
113070	113081	113082	113082	he	464	' Well , what is the " great work " ? '
113089	113147	113082	113082	he	464	' Historical . Oh , I should have written something without Grey ; I have always had a turn for it since I was a child . But he was clear that history was especially valuable — especially necessary to a clergyman . I felt he was right , entirely right . So I took my Final Schools '
113213	113214	113204	113204	I	0	' '

113245	113261	113227	113227	I	0	' and Robert threw back his head with one of his most brilliant enthusiastic smiles . '
113292	113293	113289	113290	a godsend	3249	' '
113299	113329	113289	113290	a godsend	3249	' Langham sat down on one of the carved wooden stools placed at intervals along the bookcases and looked at his friend , his psychological curiosity rising a little . '
113333	113359	113289	113290	a godsend	3249	' he said presently—'tell me what interests you specially — what seizes you — in a subject like the making of France , for instance ? '
113360	113368	113370	113370	Robert	359	' Do you really want to know ? '
113800	113803	113783	113783	he	464	' throwing out '
113871	113887	113866	113866	Frank	535	' beggars hutting in a palace — the place had harboured greater men than they ! '
113888	113894	113895	113895	Langham	464	' There is one thing , '
113917	114027	114028	114028	He	464	' that does n't seem to have touched you yet . But you will come to it . To my mind , it makes almost the chief interest of history . It is just this . History depends on testimony . What is the nature and the value of testimony at given times ? In other words , did the man of the third century understand , or report , or interpret facts in the same way as the man of the sixteenth or the nineteenth ? And if not , what are the differences , and what are the deductions to be made from them , if any ? '
114057	114062	114064	114065	the rector	8476	' Ah , well , '
114069	114165	114166	114166	he	464	' I am only just coming to that . As I told you , I am only now beginning to dig for myself . Till now it has all been work at second hand . I have been getting a general survey of the ground as quickly as I could with the help of other men 's labours . Now I must go to work inch by inch , and find out what the ground is made of . I wo n't forget your point . It is enormously important , I grant — enormously , '
114170	114177	114179	114179	Langham	464	' I should think it is , '
114186	114199	114179	114179	Langham	464	' the whole of orthodox Christianity is in it , for instance ! '
114363	114372	114374	114374	Robert	359	' This is my last day of privilege , '
114376	114404	114406	114407	the rector	8476	' Everybody is shut out when once he appears , from this wing , and this part of the grounds . This was his father 's room , '
114418	114423	114406	114407	the rector	8476	' and through there , '
114432	114456	114406	114407	the rector	8476	' lies the way to his own sleeping room , which is of course connected with the more modern side of the house . '
114457	114475	114477	114477	Langham	464	' So this is where that old man ventured " what Cato did and Addison approved , " '
114683	114691	114693	114693	Robert	359	' Now , having seen our sight , '
114706	114838	114839	114839	He	3281	' come and see our scandal . Both run by the same proprietor , if you please . There is a hamlet down there in the hollow'—and he pointed to a gray speck in the distance—'which deserves a Royal Commission all to itself , which is a disgrace'—and his tone warmed—'to any country , any owner , any agent ! It is owned by Mr. Wendover , and I see the pleasing prospect straight before me of beginning my acquaintance with him by a fight over it . You will admit that it is a little hard on a man who wants to live on good terms with the possessor of the Murewell library to have to open relations with him by a fierce attack on his drains and his pigsties . '
114874	114878	114879	114879	he	464	' An attack , '
114883	114888	114879	114879	he	464	' why an attack ? '
114953	114963	114964	114964	he	3281	' What 's the matter with this particular place ? '
114996	115217	114964	114964	he	3281	' What is n't the matter with it ? The houses , which were built on a swamp originally , are falling into ruin ; the roofs , the drains , the accommodation per head , are all about equally scandalous . The place is harried with illness ; since I came there has been both fever and diphtheria there . They are all crippled with rheumatism , but that they think nothing of ; the English labourer takes rheumatism as quite in the day 's bargain ! And as to vice — the vice that comes of mere endless persecuting opportunity — I can tell you one 's ideas of personal responsibility get a good deal shaken up by a place like this ! And I can do nothing . I brought over Henslowe to see the place , and he behaved like a brute . He scoffed at all my complaints , said that no landlord would be such a fool as to build fresh cottages on such a site , that the old ones must just be allowed to go to ruin ; that the people might live in them if they chose , or turn out of them if they chose . Nobody forced them to do either ; it was their own look - out . '
115218	115223	115225	115225	Langham	464	' That was true , '
115227	115232	115225	115225	Langham	464	' was n't it ? '
115239	115370	115233	115233	Robert	359	' Ah ! you think it so easy for those poor creatures to leave their homes , their working places ! Some of them have been there thirty years . They are close to the two or three farms that employ them , close to the osier beds which give them extra earnings in the spring . If they were turned out there is nothing nearer than Murewell , and not a single cottage to be found there . I do n't say it is a landlord 's duty to provide more cottages than are wanted ; but if the labour is wanted , the labourer should be decently housed . He is worthy of his hire , and woe to the man who neglects or ill - treats him ! '
115428	115437	115438	115438	he	359	' There I am , ranting as usual , '
115442	115469	115438	115438	he	359	' Took you for Henslowe , I suppose ! Ah , well , never mind . I hear the Provost has another book on the stocks . '
115558	115561	115563	115563	Robert	359	' There , '
115567	115592	115563	115563	Robert	359	' we are at our journey 's end . Now then , what sort of a place of human habitation do you call that ? '
115817	115828	115830	115830	Langham	464	' Well , that is a God - forsaken hole ! '
115862	115885	115830	115830	Langham	464	' I could hardly have imagined such a place existed in southern England . It is more like a bit of Ireland . '
115886	115903	115905	115905	Robert	359	' If it were Ireland it might be to somebody 's interest to ferret it out , '
115908	116086	115830	115830	Langham	464	' But these poor folks are out of the world . They may be brutalised with impunity . Oh , such a case as I had here last autumn ! A young girl of sixteen or seventeen , who would have been healthy and happy anywhere else , stricken by the damp and the poison of the place , dying in six weeks , of complications due to nothing in the world but preventable cruelty and neglect ! It was a sight that burnt into my mind , once for all , what is meant by a landlord 's responsibility . I tried , of course , to move her , but neither she nor her parents — elderly folk — had energy enough for a change . They only prayed to be let alone . I came over the last evening of her life to give her the communion . " Ah , sir ! " said the mother to me — not bitterly — that is the strange thing , they have so little bitterness—"if Mister '
116090	116095	115830	115830	Langham	464	' a mended that bit '
116121	116136	115830	115830	Langham	464	' fit to break your heart , for all the things yer could put over '
116140	116161	116119	116119	she	538	' Robert paused , his strong young face , so vehemently angry a few minutes before , tremulous with feeling . '
116166	116191	116119	116119	she	538	' he said at last with a long breath , moving away from the parapet of the bridge on which he had been leaning , '
116229	116344	116218	116218	I	0	' They crossed the bridge and turned down the track leading to the hamlet . Some planks carried them across the ditch , the main sewer of the community , as Robert pointed out , and they made their way through the filth surrounding one of the nearest cottages . A feeble elderly man , whose shaking limbs and sallow blood less skin make him look much older than he actually was , opened the door and invited them to come in . Robert passed on into an inner room , conducted thither by a woman who had been sitting working over the fire . Langham stood irresolute ; but the old man 's quavering '
116359	116664	116352	116352	you	1246	' decided him , and he stepped in . Inside the hovel was miserable indeed . It belonged to that old and evil type which the efforts of the last twenty years have done so much all over England to sweep away : four mud walls , enclosing an oblong space about eight yards long , divided into two unequal portions by a lath and plaster partition , with no upper storey , a thatched roof , now entirely out of repair , and letting in the rain in several places , and a paved floor little better than the earth itself , so large and cavernous were the gaps between the stones . The dismal place had no small adornings — none of those little superfluities which , however ugly and trivial , are still so precious in the dwellings of the poor , as showing the existence of some instinct or passion which is not the creation of the sheerest physical need ; and Langham , as he sat down , caught the sickening marsh smell which the Oxford man , accustomed to the odours of damp meadows in times of ebbing flood and festering sun , knows so well . As old Milsom began to talk to him in his weak tremulous voice , the visitor 's attention was irresistibly held by the details about him . Fresh as he was from all the delicate sights , the harmonious colours and delightful forms of the squire 's house , they made an unusually sharp impression on his fastidious senses . What does human life become lived on reeking floors and under stifling roofs like these ? What strange abnormal deteriorations , physical and spiritual , must it not inevitably undergo ? Langham felt a sudden inward movement of disgust and repulsion . '

116724	116745	116746	116747	Mr. Elsmere	313	' Meanwhile the old man went maundering on , talking of the weather , and of his sick child , and '
116749	116808	116746	116747	Mr. Elsmere	313	' with a kind of listless incoherence which hardly demanded an answer , though Langham threw in a word or two here and there . Among other things , he began to ask a question or two about Robert 's predecessor , a certain Mr. Preston , who had left behind him a memory of amiable evangelical indolence . '
116816	116820	116810	116810	you	3316	' he asked . '
116828	116839	116810	116810	you	3316	' replied the man , surprised into something like energy . '

Father , mother , grown - up son , girl of thirteen , and grandchild , all huddled in a space just fourteen feet square . Langham ! '
117293	117327	117216	117216	he	359	' what defence can be found for a man who lives in a place like Murewell Hall , and can take money from human beings for the use of a sty like that ? '
117328	117368	117216	117216	he	359	' Gently , my friend . Probably the squire , being the sort of recluse he is , has never seen the place , or , at any rate , not for years , and knows nothing about it ! '
117369	117375	117216	117216	he	359	' More shame for him ! '
117376	117382	117384	117384	Langham	464	' True in a sense , '
117390	117426	117384	117384	Langham	464	' but as you may want hereafter to make excuses for your man , and he may give you occasion , I would n't begin by painting him to yourself any blacker than need be . '

117917	117920	117922	117922	Langham	464	' Extraordinary ! '
117925	117938	117922	117922	Langham	464	' The most considerable gift I ever came across in an amateur . '
117956	117960	117961	117961	he	359	' The difficulty , '
117964	117974	117961	117961	he	359	' is to know what to do with it ! '
117975	117998	117999	117999	Langham	464	' Why do you make the difficulty ? I gather she wants to study abroad . What is there to prevent it ? '

118065	118074	118057	118057	Robert	359	' there is not much to prevent it . '

118144	118202	118138	118138	he	359	' would be to get her married . I do n't wonder her belongings dislike the notion of anything so pretty and so flighty going off to live by itself . And to break up the home in Whindale would be to undo everything their father did for them , to defy his most solemn last wishes . '
118203	118229	118231	118231	Langham	464	' To talk of a father 's wishes , in a case of this kind , ten years after his death , is surely excessive ? '

118263	118296	118260	118260	Robert	359	' I do n't wonder , it seems like a difficulty of our own making . Like so many difficulties , it depends on character , present character , bygone character — — '

118339	118348	118350	118350	Langham	464	' An easy way , I should think , '
118356	118457	118350	118350	Langham	464	' It wo n't be so easy to find the right man . She is a young person with a future , is Miss Rose . She wants somebody in the stream ; somebody with a strong hand who will keep her in order and yet give her a wide range ; a rich man , I think — she has n't the ways of a poor man 's wife ; but , at any rate , some one who will be proud of her , and yet have a full life of his own in which she may share .

He had been describing to Langham his acquaintance with the Dissenting minister of the place — a strong coarse - grained fellow of sensuous excitable temperament , famous for his noisy '
119678	119730	119731	119731	You	3401	' and for a gymnastic dexterity in the quoting and combining of texts , unrivalled in Robert 's experience . Some remark on the Dissenter 's logic , made , perhaps , a little too much in the tone of the Churchman conscious of University advantages , seemed to irritate Langham . '
119819	119837	119838	119838	We	3408	' Robert smoked on a moment in silence . Then he flushed and laid down his pipe . '

120257	120319	120247	120247	Rose	369	' She had another young Oxford man staying with her in June — a missionary — and it annoyed her very much that neither Agnes nor I would intervene to prevent his resuming his profession . She seemed to think it was a question of saving him from being eaten , and apparently he would have proposed to either of us . '
120326	120338	120247	120247	Rose	369	' I suppose she still thinks she married Robert and me . '
120339	120347	120348	120348	Catherine	358	' Of course . So she did . '

120374	120485	120371	120371	Rose	369	' nobody could have the heart to rob her of the illusion . Oh , by the way , Sarah has been under warning since June ! Mrs. Thornburgh told her desperately that she must either throw over her young man , who was picked up drunk at the vicarage gate one night , or vacate the vicarage kitchen . Sarah cheerfully accepted her month 's notice , and is still making the vicarage jams and walking out with the young man every Sunday . Mrs. Thornburgh sees that it will require a convulsion of nature to get rid either of Sarah or the young man , and has succumbed . '
120486	120497	120606	120606	she	369	' And the Tysons ? And that poor Walker girl ? '

120689	120727	120686	120686	Rose	369	' Well , after Berlin I shall try to persuade mamma and Agnes , I suppose , to come and back me up in London . We could still be some months of the year at Burwood . '

When I was young — when I was Maid of Honour'—and she drew herself up slightly—'everybody had albums . Even the dear Queen herself ! I remember how she made M.

He had made her feel her indiscretions of Sunday night as she deserved to feel them , and now after three minutes conversation she was on the verge of fresh ones . Would she never grow up , never behave like other girls ? That word humble ! It seemed to burn her memory . Before he could possibly answer she barred the way by a question as short and dry as possible — '

124329	124368	124325	124325	she	369	' Not at all ! Not for a moment ! No , but it seemed to me so pathetic , so strange that anybody should wish for anything so much as you wished for the musician 's life . '
124369	124377	124378	124378	she	369	' And you never wish for anything ? '

124588	124591	124592	124592	he	0	' Nothing , '
124596	124680	124592	124592	he	0	' Between them and me there is a great gulf fixed . I watch them pass , and I say to myself : " There are the living — that is how they look , how they speak ! Realise once for all that you have nothing to do with them . Life is theirs — belongs to them . You are already outside it . Go your way , and be a spectre among the active and the happy no longer . " '
124746	124797	124738	124738	she	3516	' Don't — don't — Mr. Langham ! Oh , do n't say such things ! Why should you be so unhappy ? Why should you talk so ? Can no one do anything ? Why do you live so much alone ? Is there no one you care about ? '

126008	126038	126040	126040	you	464	' The words were low and deliberate . After his moment of passionate speech , and hers of passionate sympathy , she began to feel strangely remote from him . '
126048	126070	126040	126040	you	464	' she asked him after a pause , timidly . Her voice recalled him . He turned and smiled at her . '
126077	126278	126072	126073	the dreamer	3539	' And as her eyes still questioned , as he was still moved by the spell of her responsiveness , he let the new wave of feeling break in words . Vaguely at first , and then with a growing flame and force , he fell to describing to her what the life of thought may be to the thinker , and those marvellous moments which belong to that life when the mind which has divorced itself from desire and sense sees spread out before it the vast realms of knowledge , and feels itself close to the secret springs and sources of being . And as he spoke , his language took an ampler turn , the element of smallness which attaches to all mere personal complaint vanished , his words flowed , became eloquent , inspired , till the bewildered child beside him , warm through and through as she was with youth and passion , felt for an instant by sheer fascinated sympathy the cold spell , the ineffable prestige , of the thinker 's voluntary death in life . But only for an instant . Then the natural sense of chill smote her to the heart . '
126284	126291	126279	126279	You	3540	' she cried , interrupting him . '
126345	126369	126342	126343	Mr. Langham	464	' she said , with bright cheeks , half smiling at her own magniloquence , her hand waving over the view before them . '

126520	126546	126503	126503	You	3540	' he said softly , but lightly , as though to keep the conversation from slipping back into those vague depths it had emerged from ; '
126602	126613	126570	126570	one	917	' She gave a long quivering sigh of passionate antagonism . '
126622	126626	126570	126570	one	917	' she cried . '
126635	126646	126570	126570	one	917	' Then , after a pause , in another tone , '
126662	126663	126652	126652	you	464	' '
126680	126686	126672	126672	I	0	' he admitted , smiling . '
126690	126698	126672	126672	I	0	' and she looked at him persuasively , '
126729	126756	126760	126760	my	0	' Then , for the first time , Langham became conscious — probably through these admonitions of hers — that the situation had absurdity in it . '
126763	126768	126760	126760	my	0	' he said hastily . '
126839	126840	126830	126830	I	0	' '
126850	126866	126830	126830	I	0	' she said faltering , reddening , her womanliness forcing the words out of her , '
126881	126920	126872	126872	Robert	359	' He faced her with a little quick movement . And as their eyes met each was struck once more with the personal beauty of the other . His eyes shone — their black depths seemed all tenderness . '
126934	127004	126872	126872	Robert	359	' he said slowly , and they stood looking at each other . Rose felt herself swept off her feet into a world of tragic mysterious emotion . She all but put her hand into his again , asking him childishly to hope , to be consoled . But the maidenly impulse restrained her , and once more he leant on the gate , burying his face in his hands .
127178	127186	127188	127188	Rose	369	' Do you know , Mr. Langham , '
127195	127264	127188	127188	Rose	369	' that there is no time at all left for you to give me good advice in ? That is an obligation still hanging over you . I do n't mean to release you from it , but if I do n't go in now and finish the covering of those library books , the youth of Murewell will be left without any literature till Heaven knows when ! '
127281	127290	127291	127291	he	0	' Hang literature — hang the parish library ! '
127317	127324	127325	127325	she	369	' Hear these men of letters ! '
127437	127440	127443	127443	Catherine	358	' Rose ! '
127550	127557	127558	127558	she	358	' I can not bear it ! '
127568	127635	127636	127636	She	358	' I can not bear it ! I hear it always in my ears : " What hast thou done with thy sister ? " Oh , Robert , do n't mind , dear , though he is your friend . My father would have shrunk from him with horror — An alien from the household of faith ! An enemy to the Cross of Christ ! '
127693	127698	127699	127699	he	359	' My dear wifie , '
127704	127715	127699	127699	he	359	' I am certain Langham has no intention of marrying . '
127716	127723	127725	127725	Catherine	358	' Then more shame for him , '
127729	127752	127725	127725	Catherine	358	' They could not have looked more conscious , Robert , when I found them together , if he had just proposed . '
127753	127760	127762	127762	Robert	359	' What , in five days ? '
127784	127793	127794	127794	he	359	' I believe with men of that sort , '
127799	127833	127794	127794	he	359	' relations to women are never more than half - real — always more or less literature — acting . Langham is tasting an experience , to be bottled up for future use . '
127867	127873	127874	127874	he	359	' After all , darling , '
127882	127912	127874	127874	he	359	' you can act dragon splendidly ; you have already — so can I. And you really can not make me believe in anything very tragic in a week . '
129084	129102	129103	129103	he	1465	' I wonder whether my Oxford friends have been doing me a good turn with the squire , '
129110	129150	129103	129103	he	1465	' He knows the provost , of course . If they talked me over it is to be hoped my scholarship did n't come up . Precious little the provost used to think of my abilities for Greek prose ! '
129220	129227	129229	129230	the butler	3624	' Mr. and Mrs. Robert Elsmere , '
129389	129412	129379	129387	a gentleman standing in a group just behind her	3630	' Roger , here are Mr. and Mrs. Robert Elsmere . Mr. Elsmere , the squire remembers you in petticoats , and I 'm
129421	130223	129416	129416	I	0	' Robert , smiling , looked beyond her to the advancing figure of the squire , but if Mr. Wendover heard his sister 's remark he took no notice of it . He held out his hand stiffly to Robert , bowed to Catherine and Rose before extending to them the same formal greeting , and just recognised Langham as having met him at Oxford . Having done so he turned back to the knot of people with whom he had been engaged on their entrance . His manner had been reserve itself . The hauteur of the grandee on his own ground was clearly marked in it , and Robert could not help fancying that towards himself there had even been something more . And not one of those phrases which , under the circumstances , would have been so easy and so gracious , as to Robert 's childish connection with the place , or as to the squire 's remembrance of his father , even though Mrs. Darcy had given him a special opening of the kind . The young rector instinctively drew himself together , like one who has received a blow , as he moved across to the other side of the fireplace to shake hands with the worthy family doctor , old Meyrick , who was already well known to him . Catherine , in some discomfort , for she too had felt their reception at the squire 's hands to be a chilling one , sat down to talk to Mrs. Darcy , disagreeably conscious the while that Rose and Langham left to themselves were practically tête - à - tête , and that , moreover , a large stand of flowers formed a partial screen between her and them . She could see , however , the gleam of Rose 's upstretched neck , as Langham , who was leaning on the piano beside her , bent down to talk to her ; and when she looked next she caught a smiling motion of Langham 's head and eyes towards the Romney portrait of Mr. Wendover 's grandmother , and was certain when he stooped afterwards to say something to his companion , that he was commenting on a certain surface likeness there was between her and the young auburn - haired beauty of the picture . Hateful ! And they would be sent down to dinner together to a certainty . The other guests were Lady Charlotte Wynnstay , a cousin of the squire — a tall , imperious , loud - voiced woman , famous in London society for her relationships , her audacity , and the salon which in one way or another she managed to collect round her ; her dark , thin , irritable - looking husband ; two neighbouring clerics — the first , by name Longstaffe , a somewhat inferior specimen of the cloth , whom Robert cordially disliked ; and the other , Mr. Bickerton , a gentle Evangelical , one of those men who help to ease the harshness of a cross - grained world , and to reconcile the cleverer or more impatient folk in it to the worries of living . Lady Charlotte was already known by name to the Elsmeres as the aunt of one of their chief friends of the neighbourhood — the wife of a neighbouring squire whose property joined that of Murewell Hall , one Lady Helen Varley , of whom more presently . Lady Charlotte was the sister of the Duke of Sedbergh , one of the greatest of dukes , and the sister also of Lady Helen 's mother , Lady Wanless . Lady Wanless had died prematurely , and her two younger children , Helen and Hugh Flaxman , creatures both of them of unusually fine and fiery quality , had owed a good deal to their aunt . There were family alliances between the Sedberghs and the Wendovers , and Lady Charlotte made a point of keeping up with the squire . She adored cynics and people who said piquant things , and it amused her to make her large tyrannous hand felt by the squire 's timid , crack - brained , ridiculous little sister . As to Dr. Meyrick , he was tall and gaunt as Don Quixote . His gray hair made a ragged fringe round his straight - backed head ; he wore an old - fashioned neck - cloth ; his long body had a perpetual stoop , as though of deference , and his spectacled look of mild attentiveness had nothing in common with that medical self - assurance with which we are all nowadays so familiar . Robert noticed presently that when he addressed Mrs. Darcy he said '
130226	130374	129416	129416	I	0	' making no bones at all about it ; and his manner generally was the manner of one to whom class distinctions were the profoundest reality , and no burden at all on a naturally humble temper . Dr. Baker , of Whindale , accustomed to trouncing Mrs. Seaton , would have thought him a poor creature . When dinner was announced , Robert found himself assigned to Mrs. Darcy ; the squire took Lady Charlotte . Catherine fell to Mr. Bickerton , Rose to Mr. Wynnstay , and the rest found their way in as best they could . Catherine seeing the distribution was happy for a moment , till she found that if Rose was covered on her right she was exposed to the full fire of the enemy on her left , in other words that Langham was placed between her and Dr. Meyrick . '
130385	130532	129416	129416	I	0	' Langham said to his neighbour as they sat down . The table was entirely covered with Japanese lilies , save for the splendid silver candelabra from which the light flashed , first on to the faces of the guests , and then on to those of the family portraits , hung thickly round the room . A roof embossed with gilded Tudor roses on a ground of black oak hung above them ; a rose- water dish in which the Merry Monarch had once dipped his hands , and which bore a record of the fact in the inscription on its sides , stood before them ; and the servants were distributing to each guest silver soup - plates which had been the gift of Sarah , Duchess of Marlborough , in some moment of generosity or calculation , to the Wendover of her day . '
130538	130543	129416	129416	I	0	' said Rose carelessly . '
130563	130646	130552	130552	I	0	' Langham looked at her , at the daring harmony of colour made by the reddish gold of her hair , the warm whiteness of her skin , and the brown - pink tints of her dress , at the crystals playing the part of diamonds on her beautiful neck , and remembered Robert 's remarks to him . The same irony mingled with the same bitterness returned to him , and the elder brother 's attitude became once more temporarily difficult . '
130652	130659	130660	130661	Lady Charlotte	556	' he inquired of her presently . '
130665	130674	130660	130661	Lady Charlotte	556	' she answered mischievously , under her breath . '
130686	130687	130683	130683	I	0	' '
130693	130694	130689	130691	that man opposite	3637	' '
130700	130742	130695	130695	Robert	359	' she said calmly , without a change of countenance , so that Mr. Longstaffe opposite , who was studying her as he always studied pretty young women , stared at her through her remark in sublime ignorance of its bearing . '
130749	130750	130751	130751	I	0	' '
130766	130771	130751	130751	I	0	' said Rose laughing ; '
130799	130800	130751	130751	I	0	' '
130810	130817	130805	130805	I	0	' said Langham with a shrug . '
130847	130848	130849	130850	The squire	9352	' '
130857	130896	130849	130850	The squire	9352	' said Rose , after a second , with a curl of her red lips . Mr. Wynnstay was still safely engaged with Mrs. Darcy , and there was a buzz of talk largely sustained by Lady Charlotte . '
130899	130903	130849	130850	The squire	9352	' Langham admitted ; '
130916	130917	130922	130922	he	3639	' '
130931	130950	130922	130922	he	3639	' said Rose indignantly , ready enough in girl fashion to defend her belongings against the outer world . '
130971	130972	130973	130973	You	3647	' '
130980	131036	130973	130973	You	3647	' and Langham smiled at her as she leant back in her chair , her white arms and wrists lying on her lap , and her slightly flushed face turned towards him . They had been on these pleasant terms of camaraderie all day , and the intimacy between them had been still making strides . '
131058	131076	131077	131077	I	0	' she asked him , with a little quick repentance passing like a shadow through her eyes . '
131108	131156	131087	131087	I	0	' She sighed remorsefully , and Langham , who five minutes before could have wished her to be always smiling , could now have almost asked to fix her as she was : the eyes veiled , the soft lips relaxed in this passing instant of gravity . '
131162	131221	131159	131159	I	0	' and she looked up again with light bewitching appeal—'there is still that question , my poor little question of Sunday night , when I was in that fine moral frame of mind and you were near giving me , I believe , the only good advice you ever gave in your life,—how shamefully you have treated it ! '
132074	132078	132079	132079	she	548	' clever men , '
132164	132174	132175	132175	she	548	' Ah ! but you have n't read it , '
132179	132239	132175	132175	she	548	' It was when I was Maid of Honour , you know . No Maid of Honour had ever written a novel before . It was quite an event . Dear Prince Albert borrowed a copy of me one night to read in bed — I have it still , with the page turned down where he left off . '
132243	132252	132253	132253	she	548	' It was only in the second chapter , '
132262	132289	132253	132253	she	548	' but you know he was so busy , all the Queen 's work to do , of course , besides his own — poor man ! '
132646	132651	132652	132652	she	548	' Do you remember , '
132664	132722	132652	132652	she	548	' what I said about my hobbies the other day ? Now , Mr. Elsmere , will you tell me — don't mind me — don't be polite — have you ever heard people tell stories of me ? Have you ever , for instance , heard them call me a — a — tuft - hunter ? '
132723	132726	132728	132728	Robert	359	' Never ! '
132731	132735	132736	132736	she	548	' They might , '
132741	132870	132872	132872	she	3685	' I am a tuft - hunter . I ca n't help it . And yet we are a good family , you know . I suppose it was that year at Court , and that horrid Warham afterwards . Twenty years in a cathedral town — and a very little cathedral town , after Windsor , and Buckingham Palace , and dear Lord Melbourne ! Every year I came up to town to stay with my father for a month in the season , and if it had n't been for that I should have died — my husband knew I should . It was the world , the flesh , and the devil , of course , but it could n't be helped . But now , '
132888	132913	132872	132872	she	3685	' You would be more interesting , would n't you , to tell the truth , if you had a handle to your name ? '
132914	132917	132919	132919	Robert	359	' Immeasurably , '
132938	132952	132955	132955	she	3685	' Well , yes , you know . But it is n't right ; '
132958	133006	132955	132955	she	3685	' And so I have been writing this novel just for that . It is called — what do you think?—"Mr . Jones . " Mr. Jones is my hero — it 's so good for me , you know , to think about a Mr. Jones . '
133013	133027	133007	133007	She	3685	' It must be indeed ! Have you endowed him with every virtue ? '
133028	133040	133042	133042	she	3685	' Oh yes , and in the end , you know — '
133067	133068	133050	133051	His father	8685	' '
133071	133075	133077	133077	he	3687	' cried Robert , '
133083	133091	133077	133077	he	3687	' Mrs. Darcy looked a little conscious . '
133096	133101	133077	133077	he	3687	' she said guiltily , '
133120	133202	133077	133077	he	3687	' Robert shook his head , with a look of protest as admonitory as he could make it , which evoked in her an answering expression of anxiety . But just at that moment a loud wave of conversation and of laughter seemed to sweep down upon them from the other end of the table , and their little private eddy was effaced . The squire had been telling an anecdote , and his clerical neighbours had been laughing at it . '
133205	133220	133077	133077	he	3687	' cried Mr. Longstaffe , throwing himself back in his chair with a chuckle , '
133228	133229	133077	133077	he	3687	' '
133234	133294	133077	133077	he	3687	' said Mr. Bickerton , benevolently , the point of it , however , to tell the truth , not being altogether clear to him . It seemed to Robert that the squire 's keen eye , as he sat looking down the table , with his large nervous hands clasped before him , was specially fixed upon himself . '
133301	133332	133296	133296	we	3690	' he said , bending forward . Catherine , faintly smiling in her corner beside the host , was looking a little flushed and moved out of her ordinary quiet . '
133342	133353	133338	133340	Archbishop Manners Sutton	571	' said Mr. Wendover , in his dry nasal voice . '
133462	133595	133596	133599	An unblushing old worldling	3694	' There was a sudden gleam of steely animation in the squire 's look as he told his story , his eye all the while fixed on Robert . Robert divined in a moment that the story had been re - told for his special benefit , and that in some unexplained way the relations between him and the squire were already biassed . He smiled a little with faint politeness , and falling back into his place made no comment on the squire 's anecdote . Lady Charlotte 's eyeglass , having adjusted itself for a moment to the distant figure of the rector , with regard to whom she had been asking Dr. Meyrick for particulars , quite unmindful of Catherine 's neighbourhood , turned back again towards the squire . '
133607	133612	133596	133599	An unblushing old worldling	3694	' she said briskly . '
133639	133686	133627	133627	Our	3697	' Lady Charlotte prided herself on these vigorous forms of speech , and the squire 's neighbourhood generally called out an unusual crop of them . The squire was still sitting with his hands on the table , his great brows bent , surveying his guests . '
133698	133703	133627	133627	Our	3697	' he said indifferently . '
133721	133734	133737	133737	you	3702	' Robert flushed , and after a moment 's hesitation bent forward . '
133740	133745	133737	133737	you	3702	' he asked quietly , '
133761	133762	133758	133758	I	0	' '
133768	133782	133758	133758	I	0	' and again Robert found the hawk - like glance concentrated on himself . '
133862	133863	133868	133868	squire	3711	' '
133870	133875	133868	133868	squire	3711	' said Lady Charlotte , '
133889	133898	133882	133883	Mr. Elsmere	313	' Mr. Wendover made her a little bow . '
133911	133916	133917	133917	I	0	' he said drily . '
133923	133936	133937	133937	I	0	' said Robert , taking no notice of this by - play ; '
133966	133967	133954	133954	you	465	' '
133972	133990	133954	133954	you	465	' thought Lady Charlotte , who , for all her noisiness , was an extremely shrewd woman , '
133999	134046	133954	133954	you	465	' Catherine 's trained eye , however , had detected signs in Robert 's look and bearing which were lost on Lady Charlotte , and which made her look nervously on . As to the rest of the table , they had all fallen to watching the '
134048	134062	134063	134064	The squire	9352	' between the new rector and their host with a good deal of curiosity .
134072	134082	134083	134083	he	9352	' It is not easy to put it tersely , '
134088	134136	134083	134083	he	9352	' but I may define it , perhaps , as the mania for mending the roof of your right - hand neighbour with straw torn off the roof of your left - hand neighbour ; the custom , in short , of robbing Peter to propitiate Paul . '
134137	134140	134142	134143	Mr. Wynnstay	563	' Precisely , '
134146	134189	134142	134143	Mr. Wynnstay	563	' all the ridiculous Radical nostrums of the last fifty years — you have hit them off exactly . Sometimes you rob more and propitiate less ; sometimes you rob less and propitiate more . But the principle is always the same . '
134262	134271	134273	134274	the squire	9352	' And the cynic takes pleasure in observing , '
134276	134314	134315	134315	He	9352	' that the man who effects the change of balance does it in the loftiest manner , and profits in the vulgarest way . Other trades may fail . The agitator is always sure of his market . '
134362	134391	134392	134392	he	9352	' Oh , if you and Mr. Wynnstay are prepared to draw an indictment against your generation and all its works , I have no more to say , '
134410	134459	134460	134460	He	9352	' I should be content to withdraw with my Burke into the majority . I imagined your attack on enthusiasm had a narrower scope , but if it is to be made synonymous with social progress I give up . The subject is too big . Only — — '
134499	134502	134503	134503	he	9352	' However , '
134510	134535	134503	134503	he	9352	' I imagine that we should find it difficult anyhow to discover common ground . I regard your Archbishop 's maxim , Mr. Wendover , '
134544	134569	134503	134503	he	9352	' as first of all a contradiction in terms ; and in the next place , to me , almost all enthusiasms are respectable ! '
134570	134581	134583	134584	Mr. Wendover	465	' You are one of those people , I see , '
134600	134667	134669	134669	he	9352	' who imagine we owe civilisation to the heart ; that mankind has felt its way — literally . The school of the majority , of course — I admit it amply . I , on the other hand , am with the benighted minority who believe that the world , so far as it has lived to any purpose , has lived by the head , '
134677	134711	134669	134669	he	9352	' But I am quite aware that in a world of claptrap the philosopher gets all the kicks , and the philanthropists , to give them their own label , all the halfpence . '
134904	134912	134913	134913	he	9352	' The one necessary thing in life , '
134931	135056	134913	134913	he	9352	' is — not to be duped . Put too much faith in these fine things the altruists talk of , and you arrive one day at the condition of Louis XIV . after the battle of Ramillies : " Dieu a donc oublié tout ce que j'ai fait pour lui ? " Read your Renan ; remind yourself at every turn that it is quite possible after all the egotist may turn out to be in the right of it , and you will find at any rate that the world gets on excellently well without your blundering efforts to set it straight . And so we get back to the Archbishop 's maxim — adapted , no doubt , to English requirements , '
135065	135081	135058	135058	he	9352	' Pace Mr. Elsmere , of course , and the rest of our clerical friends ! '
135136	135142	135143	135143	he	9352	' I am well content , '
135154	135203	135143	135143	he	9352	' I give you your Renan . Only leave us poor dupes our illusions . We will not quarrel with the division . With you all the cynics of history ; with us all the " scorners of the ground " from the world 's beginning until now ! '
135371	135374	135375	135375	she	548	' Roger , '
135379	135399	135400	135400	she	548	' you must not be so philosophical . It 's too hot ! He used to talk like that , '
135410	135484	135400	135400	she	548	' to the French priests who came to see us last winter in Paris . They never minded a bit — they used to laugh . " Monsieur votre frère , madame , c'est un homme qui a trop lu , " they would say to me when I gave them their coffee . Oh , they were such dears , those old priests ! Roger said they had great hopes of me . '
135507	135515	135516	135516	she	556	' Why did n't you support Robert ? '
135528	135537	135516	135516	she	556	' He was alone , against the table ! '
135538	135547	135548	135548	he	9352	' What good should I have done him ? '
135555	135571	135548	135548	he	9352	' And pray , my lady confessor , what enthusiasms do you suspect me of ? '
135673	135741	135648	135648	herself	556	' talk produced in her the conviction that without a good deal of pains — and why should a Londoner , accustomed to the cream of things , take pains with a country clergyman 's wife?—she was not likely to get much out of her . Her appearance promised more , Lady Charlotte thought , than her conversation justified , and she looked about for easier game . '
135749	135791	135743	135743	you	556	' said a loud voice over Rose 's head ; and Rose , who had been turning over an illustrated book , with a mind wholly detached from it , looked up to see Lady Charlotte 's massive form standing over her .
135792	135802	135804	135804	Rose	369	' No , his sister - in - law , '
135819	135822	135828	135828	herself	3736	' Hum , '
135832	135853	135828	135828	herself	3736	' I never saw two sisters more unlike . You have got a very argumentative brother - in - law . '
135867	135874	135876	135877	Lady Charlotte	556	' Did you agree with him ? '
135905	135908	135910	135910	Rose	369	' Entirely , '
135920	135962	135910	135910	Rose	369	' And what can you know about it , I wonder ? However , you are on the right side . It is the fashion nowadays to have enthusiasms . I suppose you muddle about among the poor like other people ? '
135963	135971	135973	135973	Rose	369	' I know nothing about the poor , '
135975	135992	135994	135995	the other	1544	' Oh , then , I suppose you feel yourself effective enough in some other line ? '
135998	136016	135994	135995	the other	1544	' What is it — lawn tennis , or private theatricals , or — hem — prettiness ? '
136024	136029	136031	136031	Rose	369	' Whichever you like , '
136091	136096	136098	136099	Lady Charlotte	556	' Do n't read , '
136102	136155	136098	136099	Lady Charlotte	556	' Look at me . It 's your duty to talk to me , you know ; and I wo n't make myself any more disagreeable than I can help . I generally make myself disagreeable , and yet , after all , there are a great many people who like me . '
136360	136367	136369	136369	Rose	369	' What shall we talk about ? '
136372	136381	136369	136369	Rose	369	' What a magnificent old house this is ! '
136382	136461	136462	136463	Lady Charlotte	556	' Stuff and nonsense ! I do n't want to talk about the house . I am sick to death of it . And if your people live in the parish , you are too . I return to my question . Come , tell me , what is your particular line in life ? I am sure you have one , by your face . You had better tell me ; it will do you no harm . '
136493	136499	136501	136501	she	369	' Really — Lady Charlotte — '
136520	136521	136501	136501	she	369	' '
136524	136540	136545	136545	you	369	' said her questioner again , rather disconcerted by the obvious missishness of the answer . '
136618	136619	136606	136606	I	0	' '
136627	136632	136620	136620	I	0	' said Rose meekly . '
136642	136647	136620	136620	I	0	' laughed Lady Charlotte . '
136654	136667	136668	136669	Mrs. Darcy	548	' Rose was silent again , the corners of her mouth twitching . '
136671	136680	136681	136683	this young lady	3751	' said her neighbour , raising her voice , '
136694	136746	136686	136686	she	3751	' Mrs. Darcy looked in a rather helpless way at Catherine . She was dreadfully afraid of Lady Charlotte . Catherine , with a curious reluctance , gave the required information ; and then Lady Charlotte insisted that the violin should be sent for , as it had not been brought . '
136751	136757	136686	136686	she	3751	' she inquired of Rose . '
136764	136775	136758	136759	Mr. Langham	464	' said Rose indifferently . Lady Charlotte raised her eyebrows . '
136817	136941	136812	136812	you	577	' Mrs. Darcy hurriedly gave orders , and Rose , inwardly furious , was obliged to submit . Then Lady Charlotte , having gained her point , and secured a certain amount of diversion for the evening , lay back on the sofa , used her fan , and yawned till the gentlemen appeared . When they came in , the precious violin which Rose never trusted to any other hands but her own without trepidation had just arrived , and its owner , more erect than usual , because more nervous , was trying to prop up a dilapidated music - stand which Mrs. Darcy had unearthed for her . As Langham came in , she looked up and beckoned to him . '
136946	136953	136943	136943	you	1055	' she said to him impatiently , '
136977	137025	137026	137026	I	0	' If there was one thing Langham loathed on his own account , it was any sort of performance in public . But the half - plaintive look which accompanied her last words showed that she knew it , and he did his best to be amiable . '
137033	137042	137026	137026	I	0	' he said , sitting down with resignation . '
137054	137065	137046	137048	that tiresome woman	3757	' she whispered to him behind the music - stand . '
137076	137077	137078	137078	Macaulay	578	' '
137086	137109	137080	137081	Lady Holland	579	' suggested Langham with languid vindictiveness as he gave her the note . Meanwhile Mr. Wynnstay and the squire sauntered in together . '
137116	137130	137078	137078	Macaulay	578	' whispered the guest to the host . The squire shrugged his shoulders . '
137133	137315	137078	137078	Macaulay	578	' said Lady Charlotte , looking severely at her husband . Mr. Wynnstay 's smile instantly disappeared ; he leant against the doorway and stared sulkily at the ceiling . Then the musicians began , on some Hungarian melodies put together by a younger rival of Brahms . They had not played twenty bars before the attention of every one in the room was more or less seized — unless we except Mr. Bickerton , whose children , good soul , were all down with some infantile ailment or other , and who was employed in furtively watching the clock all the time to see when it would be decent to order round the pony - carriage which would take him back to his pale overweighted spouse . First came wild snatches of march music , primitive , savage , non - European ; then a waltz of the lightest , maddest rhythm , broken here and there by strange barbaric clashes ; then a song , plaintive and clinging , rich in the subtlest shades and melancholies of modern feeling . '
137321	137335	137078	137078	Macaulay	578	' said Lady Charlotte once , under her breath , at a pause ; '
137343	137424	137078	137078	Macaulay	578	' For Rose 's figure was standing thrown out against the dusky blue of the tapestried walls , and from that delicate relief every curve , every grace , each tint — hair and cheek and gleaming arm gained an enchanting picture - like distinctness . There was jessamine at her waist and among the gold of her hair ; the crystals on her neck , and on the little shoe thrown forward beyond her dress , caught the lamplight . '
137440	137458	137459	137459	He	8701	' thought Lady Charlotte to herself , with a sigh , perhaps , for her own youth . '
137476	137608	137470	137470	his	8701	' Then the slow passionate sweetness of the music swept her away with it , she being in her way a connoisseur , and she ceased to speculate . When the sounds ceased there was silence for a moment . Mrs. Darcy , who had a piano in her sitting - room whereon she strummed every morning with her tiny rheumatic fingers , and who had , as we know , strange little veins of sentiment running all about her , stared at Rose with open mouth . So did Catherine . Perhaps it was then for the first time that , touched by this publicity , this contagion of other people 's feeling , Catherine realised fully against what a depth of stream she had been building her useless barriers . '
137613	137681	137683	137683	we	3763	' cried Lady Charlotte . The whole room seconded the demand save the squire and Mr. Bickerton . They withdrew together into a distant oriel . Robert , who was delighted with his little sister - in - law 's success , went smiling to talk of it to Mrs. Darcy , while Catherine with a gentle coldness answered Mr. Longstaffe 's questions on the same theme . '
137685	137702	137683	137683	we	3763	' said Rose , panting a little , but radiant , looking down on her companion . '
137706	137732	137683	137683	we	3763	' he said , his grave lips slightly smiling , his eyes taking in the same vision that had charmed Lady Charlotte 's . What a '
137739	137740	137683	137683	we	3763	' '
137747	137751	137743	137743	you	0	' she persisted . '
137760	137761	137743	137743	you	0	' '
137765	137779	137743	137743	you	0	' showing off , I mean . I am quite ready to stop . '
137780	137787	137788	137788	he	0	' Go on ; go on ! '
137797	137817	137788	137788	he	0	' You have driven all my mauvaise honte away . I have not heard you play so splendidly yet . '
137823	137830	137831	137831	she	3764	' Then we will go on , '
138039	138061	138032	138032	Langham	464	' Do you know that for years I have enjoyed nothing so much as the music of the last two days ? '
138080	138094	138077	138077	She	930	' How little I imagined that first evening that you cared for music ! '
138095	138104	138105	138105	he	464	' Or about anything else worth caring for ? '
138122	138129	138130	138130	she	930	' Oh , if you like , '
138141	138175	138130	138130	she	930	' I believe you talked to Catherine the whole of the first evening , when you were n't reading Hamlet in the corner , about the arrangements for women 's education at Oxford . '
138176	138186	138187	138187	he	464	' Could I have found a more respectable subject ? '
138192	138198	138199	138199	she	930	' The adjective is excellent , '
138215	138291	138207	138207	she	930	' If I remember right , Catherine and I felt it personal . None of us were ever educated , except in arithmetic , sewing , English history , the Catechism , and Paradise Lost . I taught myself French at seventeen , because one Molière wrote plays in it , and German because of Wagner . But they are my French and my German . I would n't advise anybody else to steal them ! '
138306	138310	138311	138311	he	464	' I wonder , '
138318	138327	138311	138311	he	464	' when I shall play that Beethoven again ? '
138328	138339	138340	138340	she	930	' To - morrow morning if you have a conscience , '
138344	138355	138340	138340	she	930	' we murdered one or two passages in fine style . '
138363	138372	138356	138356	He	464	' But I go by the morning train ! '
138389	138398	138399	138399	she	930	' I thought it was to be Saturday , '
138403	138406	138407	138407	he	464	' No , '
138413	138434	138407	138407	he	464	' it was always Friday . There is a meeting in London I must get to to - morrow afternoon . '
138435	138445	138446	138446	she	930	' Then we sha n't finish these Hungarian duets , '
138530	138538	138539	138539	he	464	' No , we shall finish nothing , '
138557	138590	138539	138539	he	464	' there are some whose destiny it is never to finish — never to have enough — to leave the feast on the table , and all the edges of life ragged ! '
138634	138641	138642	138642	she	930	' We make our own destiny , '
138646	138692	138693	138693	she	930	' We choose . It is all our own doing . Perhaps destiny begins things — friendship , for instance ; but afterwards it is absurd to talk of anything but ourselves . We keep our friends , our chances , our — our joys , '
138703	138715	138693	138693	she	930	' or we throw them away wilfully , because we choose . '
138724	138728	138729	138729	he	464	' Not wilfully , '
138735	138777	138732	138732	his	464	' But — no matter . May I take you at your word , Miss Leyburn ? Wretched shirker that I am , whom even Robert 's charity despairs of : have I made a friend ? Can I keep her ? '
138800	138803	138804	138804	she	930	' Try , '
138838	138844	138846	138847	Lady Charlotte	556	' Albert , come here ! '
138865	138895	138855	138855	Albert	359	' Just go and ask that girl to come and talk to me , will you ? Why on earth did n't you make friends with her at dinner ? '
138908	138913	138914	138914	she	2651	' Just like you ! '
138941	138966	138914	138914	she	2651	' You always expect to kill at the first stroke . I mean to take her in tow . Go and bring her here . '
139057	139073	139050	139051	Mrs. Darcy	548	' Oh , Mr. Langham , you play so beautifully ! Do play a solo ! '
139536	139550	139552	139553	Dr. Meyrick	562	' Look at that Romney , Mr. Elsmere ; just look at it ! '
139556	139589	139552	139553	Dr. Meyrick	562	' did you ever see anything finer ? There was one of those London dealer fellows down here last summer offered the squire four thousand pounds down on the nail for it . '
139808	139875	139790	139791	the rector	8476	' What , play your cards so badly , give up the game so rashly , the very first round ? Nonsense ! Patience and try again . There must be some cause in the background . No need to be white - livered , but every need , in the case of such a man as the squire , to take no hasty needless offence . '
139970	139974	139975	139975	he	359	' I believe , '
139982	140009	139975	139975	he	359	' my father used to be allowed the same privileges . If so , it quite accounts for the way in which he clung to Murewell . '
140010	140023	140025	140026	the squire	9352	' I had never the honour of Mr. Edward Elsmere 's acquaintance , '
140029	140045	140025	140026	the squire	9352	' During the time of his occupation of the rectory I was not in England . '
140046	140067	139975	139975	he	359	' I know . Do you still go much to Germany ? Do you keep up your relations with Berlin ? '
140068	140078	140080	140081	the squire	9352	' I have not seen Berlin for fifteen years , '
140120	140147	140112	140113	the squire	9352	' Bickerton , have you noticed how many trees that storm of last February has brought down at the north - east corner of the park ? '
140223	140229	140231	140231	Catherine	358	' What time is it ? '
140238	140243	140244	140244	he	359	' Time to go , '
140285	140293	140294	140294	she	358	' Then let us go at once , '
140297	140302	140294	140294	she	358	' Where is Rose ? '
140492	140505	140506	140506	Wynnstay	556	' What an absurd fuss you have been making about that girl , '
140528	140582	140519	140520	the squire	9352	' And now , I suppose , you will be having her up in town , and making some young fellow who ought to know better fall in love with her . I am told the father was a grammar - school headmaster . Why ca n't you leave people where they belong ? '
140583	140592	140593	140594	Lady Charlotte	556	' I have already pointed out to you , '
140598	140661	140663	140663	she	556	' that the world has moved on since you were launched into it . I ca n't keep up class - distinctions to please you ; otherwise , no doubt , being the devoted wife I am , I might try . However , my dear , we both have our fancies . You collect Sèvres china with or without a pedigree , '
140667	140694	140663	140663	she	556	' I collect promising young women . On the whole , I think my hobby is more beneficial to you than yours is profitable to me . '
140984	140987	140989	140989	Robert	359	' Wifie ! '
140997	141141	140989	140989	Robert	359	' do you know it has just occurred to me that , as I was going through the park this afternoon by the lower footpath , I crossed Henslowe coming away from the house . Of course this is what has happened ! He has told his story first . No doubt just before I met him he had been giving the squire a full and particular account — à la Henslowe — of my proceedings since I came . Henslowe lays it on thick — paints with a will . The squire receives me afterwards as the meddlesome pragmatical priest he understands me to be ; puts his foot down to begin with ; and , hinc illæ lacrymæ . It 's as clear as daylight ! I thought that man had an odd twist of the lip as he passed me . '
141142	141154	141156	141156	Catherine	358	' Then a disagreeable evening will be the worst of it , '
141159	141174	141156	141156	Catherine	358	' I imagine , Robert , you can defend yourself against that bad man ? '
141175	141203	141205	141207	the young rector	1873	' He has got the start ; he has no scruples ; and it remains to be seen whether the squire has a heart to appeal to , '
141212	141281	141205	141207	the young rector	1873	' Oh , Catherine , have you ever thought , wifie , what a business it will be for us if I ca n't make friends with that man ? Here we are at his gates — all our people in his power ; the comfort , at any rate , of our social life depending on him . And what a strange , unmanageable , inexplicable being ! '
141908	141927	141896	141896	Catherine	358	' Mr. Langham , Robert has gone to the study ; will you go and smoke with him ? '
141928	141942	141943	141943	Catherine	358	' By all means . Good - night , then , Mrs. Elsmere . '
141978	141983	141984	141984	she	358	' Good - night ! '
141992	141999	142000	142000	Catherine	358	' Oh , and Mr. Langham ! '
142009	142019	142000	142000	Catherine	358	' will you settle with Robert about the carriage ? '
142033	142036	142038	142038	Rose	369	' When ? '
142041	142048	142038	142038	Rose	369	' For the nine o'clock train . '
142049	142063	142065	142065	Rose	369	' There should be a law against interfering with people 's breakfast hour , '
142067	142113	142065	142065	Rose	369	' though , to be sure , a guest may as well get himself gone early and be done with it . How you and Robert raced , Cathie ! We did our best to catch you up , but the pace was too good . '
142150	142160	142135	142135	her	930	' Rose , darling , you are not tired ? '
142161	142181	142190	142190	Rose	369	' Oh dear , no ! Good - night , sleep well . What a goose Mrs. Darcy is ! '
142660	142665	142666	142666	he	464	' Am I sane ? '
142671	142731	142666	142666	he	464	' Have I ever been sane ? Probably not . The disproportion between my motives and other men 's is too great to be normal . Well , at least I am sane enough to shut myself up . Long after that beautiful child has forgotten she ever saw me I shall still be doing penance in the desert . '
143134	143138	143193	143193	her	369	' indifferent red , '
143182	143187	143188	143188	she	369	' I am handsome , '
143198	143209	143188	143188	she	369	' I am . I may say it to myself . '
143270	143279	143280	143280	she	369	' I hate him ! I hate him ! '
143450	143467	143429	143431	The poor child	3508	' I hate him ! I hate him ! Cold - blooded — ungrateful — unkind ! '
144686	144693	144694	144694	Henslowe	466	' Seen him yet , sir ? '
144729	144747	144749	144750	the rector	8476	' I have seen him , but I have not talked to him on this particular matter , '
144761	144788	144749	144750	the rector	8476	' You may , however , be very sure , Mr. Henslowe , that everything I know about Mile End the squire shall know before long . '
144789	144793	144749	144750	the rector	8476	' Oh , lor '
144799	144806	144749	144750	the rector	8476	' cried Henslowe with a guffaw , '
144862	145112	144844	144844	You	0	' Then Robert 's temper gave way , and he turned upon the half - drunken brute before him with a few home - truths delivered with a rapier - like force which for the moment staggered Henslowe , who turned from red to purple . The rector , with some of those pitiful memories of the hamlet , of which we had glimpses in his talk with Langham , burning at his heart , felt the man no better than a murderer , and as good as told him so . Then , without giving him time to reply , Robert strode on , leaving Henslowe planted in the pathway . But he was hardly up the hill before the agent , having recovered himself by dint of copious expletives , was looking after him with a grim chuckle . He knew his master , and he knew himself , and he thought between them they would about manage to keep that young spark in order . Robert meanwhile went straight home into his study , and there fell upon ink and paper . What was the good of protracting the matter any longer ? Something must and should be done for these people , if not one way , then another . So he wrote to the squire , showing the letter to Catherine when it was done , lest there should be anything over - fierce in it . It was the simple record of twelve months '
145231	145234	145236	145236	Robert	359	' H'm , '
145250	145259	145239	145239	he	359	' ca n't be said to be lengthy . '
145311	145441	145303	145304	the squire	9352	' As for the bulk of your communication , I am at a loss to understand the vehemence of your remarks on the subject of my Mile End property . My agent informed me shortly after my return home that you had been concerning yourself greatly , and , as he conceived , unnecessarily about the matter . Allow me to assure you that I have full confidence in Mr. Henslowe , who has been in the district for as many years as you have spent months in it , and whose authority on points connected with the business management of my estate naturally carries more weight with me , if you will permit me to say so , than your own.—I am , sir , your obedient servant , '
145445	145510	145442	145443	Roger Wendover	406	' Catherine returned the letter to her husband with a look of dismay . He was standing with his back to the chimney - piece , his hands thrust far into his pockets , his upper lip quivering . In his happy expansive life this was the sharpest personal rebuff that had ever happened to him . He could not but smart under it . '
145515	145551	145442	145443	Roger Wendover	406	' he said , tossing his hair back impetuously , as Catherine stood opposite watching him—'not one single word about the miserable people themselves ! What kind of stuff can the man be made off ? '
145552	145558	145560	145560	Catherine	358	' Does he believe you ? '
145564	145575	145576	145576	he	3981	' If not , one must try and make him , '
145586	145603	145576	145576	he	3981	' To - morrow , Catherine , I go down to the Hall and see him . '
145756	145762	145751	145751	he	359	' Mr. Elsmere , sir ! '
145922	145933	145935	145935	Robert	359	' I persuaded Vincent to admit me , Mr. Wendover , '
145966	145994	145995	145996	The squire	9352	' I should have preferred not to disturb you without an appointment , but after your letter it seemed to me some prompt personal explanation was necessary . '
146517	146521	146522	146522	he	465	' Mr. Elsmere , '
146531	146752	146753	146753	he	4026	' I imagine it would have been better — infinitely better — to have spared both yourself and me the disagreeables of this interview . However , I am not sorry we should understand each other . I have lived a life which is at least double the length of yours in very tolerable peace and comfort . The world has been good enough for me , and I for it , so far . I have been master in my own estate , and intend to remain so . As for the new - fangled ideas of a landowner 's duty , with which your mind seems to be full'—the scornful irritation of the tone was unmistakable—'I have never dabbled in them , nor do I intend to begin now . I am like the rest of my kind ; I have no money to chuck away in building schemes , in order that the rector of the parish may pose as the apostle of the agricultural labourer . That , however , is neither here nor there . What is to the purpose is , that my business affairs are in the hands of a business man , deliberately chosen and approved by me , and that I have nothing to do with them . Nothing at all ! '
146758	146903	146753	146753	he	4026	' It may seem to you very shocking . You may regard it as the object in life of the English landowner to inspect the pigstyes and amend the habits of the English labourer . I do n't quarrel with the conception , I only ask you not to expect me to live up to it . I am a student first and foremost , and desire to be left to my books . Mr. Henslowe is there on purpose to protect my literary freedom . What he thinks desirable is good enough for me , as I have already informed you . I am sorry for it if his methods do not commend themselves to you . But I have yet to learn that the rector of the parish has an ex - officio right to interfere between a landlord and his tenants . '
146934	146981	146915	146915	he	359	' If I were to take all the trouble and all the expense off your hands , Mr. Wendover , would it be impossible for you to authorise me to make one or two alterations most urgently necessary for the improvement of the Mile End cottages ? '
146990	147026	146982	146983	The squire	9352	' I have never yet been in the habit , Mr. Elsmere , of doing my repairs by public subscription . You ask a little too much from an old man 's powers of adaptation . '
147045	147049	147050	147050	he	359	' Mr. Wendover , '
147068	147109	147050	147050	he	359	' what I think you can not understand is that at any moment a human creature may sicken and die , poisoned by the state of your property , for which you — and nobody else — are ultimately responsible . '
147116	147151	147113	147113	his	9352	' So you say , Mr. Elsmere . If true , every person in such a condition has a remedy in his own hands . I force no one to remain on my property . '
147152	147159	147161	147161	Robert	359	' The people who live there , '
147163	147188	147161	147161	Robert	359	' have neither home nor subsistence if they are driven out . Murewell is full — times bad — most of the people old . '
147189	147202	147204	147205	the squire	9352	' And eviction " a sentence of death , " I suppose , '
147213	147340	147204	147205	the squire	9352	' Well , I have no belief in a Gladstonian Ireland , still less in a Radical England . Supply and demand , cause and effect , are enough for me . The Mile End cottages are out of repair , Mr. Elsmere , so Mr. Henslowe tells me , because the site is unsuitable , the type of cottage out of date . People live in them at their peril ; I do n't pull them down , or rather'—correcting himself with exasperating consistency—'Mr . Henslowe does n't pull them down , because , like other men , I suppose , he dislikes an outcry . But if the population stays , it stays at its own risk . Now have I made myself plain ? '
147348	147352	147354	147354	Robert	359	' Perfectly plain , '
147357	147380	147354	147354	Robert	359	' Allow me to remind you , Mr. Wendover , that there are other matters than eviction capable of provoking an outcry . '
147381	147386	147388	147389	the other	1544	' As you please , '
147392	147447	147388	147389	the other	1544	' I have no doubt I shall find myself in the newspapers before long . If so , I daresay I shall manage to put up with it . Society is made up of fanatics and the creatures they hunt . If I am to be hunted , I shall be in good company . '
147498	147511	147512	147512	he	359	' I have done no good , I see , Mr. Wendover , '
147519	147568	147512	147512	he	359	' I wish I could have induced you to do an act of justice and mercy . I wish I could have made you think more kindly of myself . I have failed in both . It is useless to keep you any longer . Good - morning . '
147703	147711	147712	147712	he	8405	' Shall I ever see this again ? '
147864	147871	147872	147872	she	358	' What shall you do next ? '
147876	147885	147886	147886	he	8405	' Make out the law of the matter , '
147890	147898	147900	147900	Catherine	358	' If you get over the inspector , '
147903	147915	147900	147900	Catherine	358	' I am tolerably certain Henslowe will turn out the people . '
148024	148031	148032	148032	he	8405	' Let it be a while , '
148043	148074	148032	148032	he	8405	' I shall get morbid over it if I do n't mind . I am a selfish wretch too . I know you have worries of your own , wifie . '
148091	148094	148096	148096	Catherine	358	' Yes , '
148104	148107	148108	148108	she	358	' Robert , '
148113	148153	148108	148108	she	358	' I am certain that man made love of a kind to Rose . He will never think of it again , but since the night before last she , to my mind , is simply a changed creature . '
148154	148161	148163	148163	Robert	359	' I do n't see it , '
148195	148211	148213	148213	she	358	' You have been studying the squire , sir — I have been studying Rose . '
148329	148338	148339	148339	he	8405	' Of course I feel myself to blame , '
148345	148372	148339	148339	he	8405	' But how could one foresee , with such an inveterate hermit and recluse ? And I owed him — I owe him — so much . '
148373	148377	148379	148379	Catherine	358	' I know , '
148400	148410	148412	148412	Elsmere	359	' You will have to send her to Berlin , '
148417	148438	148412	148412	Elsmere	359	' You must play off her music against this unlucky feeling . If it exists it is your only chance . '
148439	148448	148450	148450	Catherine	358	' Yes , she must go to Berlin , '
148473	148494	148455	148455	she	358	' I am not sad about that , Robert . Oh , how you have widened my world for me ! '
148974	149003	149004	149005	the agent	3913	' And if you do n't find Thurston Common nice lying this weather , with the winter coming on , you 'll know who to thank for it , '
149043	149052	149054	149055	old Milsom	539	' If they turn us out , sir , '
149066	149078	149054	149055	old Milsom	539	' there 'll be nothing left but the House for us old '
149084	149101	149109	149109	Robert	359	' bless you , sir , it 's not so bad but we can make shift . '
149102	149107	149109	149109	Robert	359	' You , Milsom ! '
149111	149144	149109	149109	Robert	359	' and you 've just all but lost your grandchild ! And you know your wife'll never be the same woman since that bout of fever in the spring . And — — '
149165	149172	149174	149174	Milsom	539	' Ay , ay , sir , '
149178	149276	149174	149174	Milsom	539	' But if it is n't fevers , it 's summat else . I can make a shilling or two where I be , speshally in the first part of the year , in the basket work , and my wife she goes charring up at Mr. Carter 's farm , and Mr. Dodson , him at the farther farm , he do give us a bit sometimes . Ef you git us turned away it will be a bad day 's work for all on us , sir , you may take my word on it . '
149277	149287	149289	149289	Sharland	589	' And my wife so ill , Mr. Elsmere , '
149291	149336	149289	149289	Sharland	589	' and all those childer ! I ca n't walk three miles farther to my work , Mr. Elsmere , I ca n't nohow . I have n't got the legs for it . Let un be , sir . We 'll rub along . '
149507	149510	149511	149511	she	369	' Defeated ! '
149520	149542	149543	149543	she	369	' Well , everybody must have his turn . Robert has been too successful in his life , I think.—You wretch ! '
149609	149615	149602	149602	Catherine	358	' Must you , Robert ? '
149616	149635	149636	149636	he	359	' I wo n't be beholden to that man for anything an hour longer than I can help , '
149658	149673	149674	149674	he	359	' Things wo n't be as easy for us in the future , darling , '
149679	149703	149674	149674	he	359	' A rector with both squire and agent against him is rather heavily handicapped . We must make up our minds to that . '
149704	149711	149712	149712	she	358	' I have no great fear , '
149720	149730	149731	149731	he	359	' Oh , well — nor I — perhaps , '
149738	149770	149771	149771	Catherine	358	' We can hold our own . But I wish — oh , I wish'—and he laid his hand on his wife 's shoulder—'I could have made friends with the squire . '
149776	149787	149771	149771	Catherine	358	' As squire , Robert , or as Mr. Wendover ? '
149788	149801	149771	149771	Catherine	358	' As both , of course , but specially as Mr. Wendover . '

Oh , when I get well , how I will take care of the women here ! What women must suffer even here in out - of - the - way cottages — no doctor , no kind nursing , all blind agony and struggle ! And women in London in dens like those Mr. Newcome got into , degraded , forsaken , ill - treated , the thought of the child only an extra horror and burden ! And the pain all the time so merciless , so cruel — no escape ! Oh , to give all one is , or ever can be , to comforting ! And yet the great sea of it one can never touch ! It is a nightmare — I am weak still , I suppose ; I do n't know myself ; but I can see nothing but jarred , tortured creatures everywhere .

But if I could have made you see and know the things I have seen up in the mountains — among the poor , the dying — you would have felt Him saving , redeeming , interceding , as I did . Oh , then you must , you would have known that Christ only is real , that our joys can only truly exist in Him . I should have been more open — more faithful — more humble . '

154676	154864	154865	154865	I	0	' The word had a little sound of bitterness . In spite of all his love , had the gentle puzzle - headed woman found her unearthly husband often very hard to live with ? Rose meanwhile was sitting up in bed , with her hands round her knees , dreaming . So she had got her heart 's desire ! There did not seem to be much joy in the getting , but that was the way of things , one was told . She knew she should hate the Germans — great , bouncing , over - fed , sentimental creatures ! Then her thoughts ran into the future . After six months — yes , by April — she would be home , and Agnes and her mother could meet her in London . London . Ah , it was London she was thinking of all the time , not Berlin ! She could not stay in the present ; or rather the Rose of the present went straining to the Rose of the future , asking to be righted , to be avenged . '
154879	154886	154888	154888	April	99	' she said to herself feverishly . '
155000	155311	154977	154977	I	0	' So once more Rose flung her defiance at fate . But when Catherine came along the passage an hour later she heard low sounds from Rose 's room , which ceased abruptly as her step drew near . The elder sister paused ; her eyes filled with tears ; her hand closed indignantly . Then she came closer , all but went in , thought better of it , and moved away . If there is any truth in brain - waves , Langham should have slept restlessly that night . Ten days later an escort had been found , all preparations had been made , and Rose was gone . Mrs. Leyburn and Agnes lingered a while , and then they too departed under an engagement to come back after Christmas for a long stay , that Mrs. Leyburn might cheat the northern spring a little . So husband and wife were alone again . How they relished their solitude ! Catherine took up many threads of work which her months of comparative weakness had forced her to let drop . She taught vigorously in the school ; in the afternoons , so far as her child would let her , she carried her tender presence and her practical knowledge of nursing to the sick and feeble ; and on two evenings in the week she and Robert threw open a little room there was on the ground - floor between the study and the dining - room to the women and girls of the village , as a sort of drawing - room . Hard - worked mothers would come , who had put their fretful babes to sleep , and given their lords to eat , and had just energy left , while the eldest daughter watched , and the men were at the club or the '
155315	155718	154977	154977	I	0	' to put on a clean apron and climb the short hill to the rectory . Once there , there was nothing to think of for an hour but the bright room , Catherine 's kind face , the rector 's jokes , and the illustrated papers or the photographs that were spread out for them to look at if they would . The girls learned to come , because Catherine could teach them a simple dressmaking , and was clever in catching stray persons to set them singing ; and because Mr. Elsmere read exciting stories , and because nothing any one of them ever told Mrs. Elsmere was forgotten by her , or failed to interest her . Any of her social equals of the neighbourhood would have hardly recognised the reserved and stately Catherine on these occasions . Here she felt herself at home , at ease . She would never , indeed , have Robert 's pliancy , his quick divination , and for some time after her transplanting the North - country woman had found it very difficult to suit herself to a new shade of local character . But she was learning from Robert every day ; she watched him among the poor , recognising all his gifts with a humble intensity of admiring love , which said little but treasured everything , and for herself her inward happiness and peace shone through her quiet ways , making her the mother and the friend of all about her . As for Robert , he , of course , was living at high pressure all round . Outside his sermons and his school , his Natural History Club had perhaps most of his heart , and the passion for science , little continuous work as he was able to give it , grew on him more and more . He kept up as best he could , working with one hand , so to speak , when he could not spare two , and in his long rambles over moor and hill , gathering in with his quick eye a harvest of local fact wherewith to feed their knowledge and his own . The mornings he always spent at work among his books , the afternoons in endless tramps over the parish , sometimes alone , sometimes with Catherine ; and in the evenings , if Catherine was '
155722	155930	154977	154977	I	0	' twice a week to womankind , he had his nights when his study became the haunt and prey of half the boys in the place , who were free of everything , as soon as he had taught them to respect his books , and not to taste his medicines ; other nights when he was lecturing or story - telling in the club or in some outlying hamlet ; or others again , when with Catherine beside him he would sit trying to think some of that religious passion which burned in both their hearts , into clear words or striking illustrations for his sermons . Then his choir was much upon his mind . He knew nothing about music , nor did Catherine ; their efforts made Rose laugh irreverently when she got their letters at Berlin . But Robert believed in a choir chiefly as an excellent social and centralising instrument . There had been none in Mr. Preston 's day . He was determined to have one , and a good one , and by sheer energy he succeeded , delighting in his boyish way over the opposition some of his novelties excited among the older and more stiff - backed inhabitants .

Then those stiff - necked sons of the devil fell upon the man of God , scourged him sore , and threatened him with death , if he would not instantly loose those spirits he had bound . And seeing he could prevail nothing , and being , moreover , admonished by God so to do , he permitted them to work their own damnation . For he called for a parchment and wrote upon it , " Ambrose unto Satan — Enter ! " Then was the spell loosed , the spirits returned , the sorcerers inquired as they were accustomed , and received answers . But in a short space of time every one of them perished miserably and was delivered unto his natural lord Satanas , whereunto he belonged . '

158894	159915	158856	158856	he	359	' he said to himself with a laugh and a shrug as he turned up the lane to the rectory , and then , boy - like , was ashamed of himself , and greeted Catherine with all the tenderer greeting . Only on two occasions during three months could he be sure of having seen the squire . Both were in the twilight , when , as the neighbourhood declared , Mr. Wendover always walked , and both made a sharp impression on the rector 's nerves . In the heart of one of the loneliest commons of the parish Robert , swinging along one November evening through the scattered furze bushes , growing ghostly in the darkness , was suddenly conscious of a cloaked figure with slouching shoulders and head bent forward coming towards him . It passed without recognition of any kind , and for an instant Robert caught the long sharpened features and haughty eyes of the squire . At another time Robert was walking , far from home , along a bit of level road . The pools in the ruts were just filmed with frost , and gleamed under the sunset ; the winter dusk was clear and chill . A horseman turned into the road from a side lane . It was the squire again , alone . The sharp sound of the approaching hoofs stirred Robert 's pulse , and as they passed each other the rector raised his hat . He thought his greeting was acknowledged , but could not be quite sure . From the shelter of a group of trees he stood a moment and looked after the retreating figure . It and the horse showed dark against a wide sky barred by stormy reds and purples . The wind whistled through the withered oaks ; the long road with its lines of glimmering pools seemed to stretch endlessly into the sunset ; and with every minute the night strode on . Age and loneliness could have found no fitter setting . A shiver ran through Elsmere as he stepped forward . Undoubtedly the quarrel , helped by his work , and the perpetual presence of that beautiful house commanding the whole country round it from its plateau above the river , kept Elsmere specially in mind of the squire . As before their first meeting , and in spite of it , he became more and more imaginatively preoccupied with him . One of the signs of it was a strong desire to read the squire 's two famous books : one , The Idols of the Market - place , an attack on English beliefs ; the other , Essays on English Culture , an attack on English ideals of education . He had never come across them as it happened , and perhaps Newcome 's denunciation had some effect in inducing him for a time to refrain from reading them . But in December he ordered them and waited their coming with impatience . He said nothing of the order to Catherine ; somehow there were by now two or three portions of his work , two or three branches of his thought , which had fallen out of their common discussion . After all she was not literary , and with all their oneness of soul there could not be an identity of interests or pursuits . The books arrived in the morning . ( Oh , how dismally well , with what a tightening of the heart , did Robert always remember that day in after years ! ) He was much too busy to look at them , and went off to a meeting . In the evening , coming home late from his night - school , he found Catherine tired , sent her to bed , and went himself into his study to put together some notes for a cottage lecture he was to give the following day . The packet of books , unopened , lay on his writing - table . He took off the wrapper , and in his eager way fell to reading the first he touched . It was the first volume of The Idols of the Market - place . Ten or twelve years before , Mr. Wendover had launched this book into a startled and protesting England . It had been the fruit of his first renewal of contact with English life and English ideas after his return from Berlin . Fresh from the speculative ferment of Germany and the far profaner scepticism of France , he had returned to a society where the first chapter of Genesis and the theory of verbal inspiration were still regarded as valid and important counters on the board of thought . The result had been this book . In it each stronghold of English popular religion had been assailed in turn , at a time when English orthodoxy was a far more formidable thing than it is now . The Pentateuch , the Prophets , the Gospels , St. Paul , Tradition , the Fathers , Protestantism and Justification by Faith , the Eighteenth Century , the Broad Church Movement , Anglican Theology — the squire had his say about them all . And while the coolness and frankness of the method sent a shock of indignation and horror through the religious public , the subtle and caustic style , and the epigrams with which the book was strewn , forced both the religious and irreligious public to read , whether they would or no . A storm of controversy rose round the volumes , and some of the keenest observers of English life had said at the time , and maintained since , that the publication of the book had made or marked an epoch . Robert had lit on those pages in the Essay on the Gospels where the squire fell to analysing the evidence for the Resurrection , following up his analysis by an attempt at reconstructing the conditions out of which the belief in '
159918	160278	160279	160279	Master	9431	' arose . Robert began to read vaguely at first , then to hurry on through page after page , still standing , seized at once by the bizarre power of the style , the audacity and range of the treatment . Not a sound in the house . Outside , the tossing moaning December night ; inside , the faintly crackling fire , the standing figure . Suddenly it was to Robert as though a cruel torturing hand were laid upon his inmost being . His breath failed him ; the book slipped out of his grasp ; he sank down upon his chair , his head in his hands . Oh , what a desolate intolerable moment ! Over the young idealist soul there swept a dry destroying whirlwind of thought . Elements gathered from all sources — from his own historical work , from the squire 's book , from the secret half - conscious recesses of the mind — entered into it , and as it passed it seemed to scorch the heart . He stayed bowed there a while , then he roused himself with a half - groan , and hastily extinguishing his lamp he groped his way upstairs to his wife 's room . Catherine lay asleep . The child , lost among its white coverings , slept too ; there was a dim light over the bed , the books , the pictures . Beside his wife 's pillow was a table on which there lay open her little Testament and the Imitation her father had given her . Elsmere sank down beside her , appalled by the contrast between this soft religious peace and that black agony of doubt which still overshadowed him . He knelt there , restraining his breath lest it should wake her , wrestling piteously with himself , crying for pardon , for faith , feeling himself utterly unworthy to touch even the dear hand that lay so near him . But gradually the traditional forces of his life reasserted themselves . The horror lifted . Prayer brought comfort and a passionate healing self - abasement . '
160287	160293	160279	160279	Master	9431	' cried the aching heart . '
160310	160357	160307	160308	O God	4335	' He did not open the book again . Next morning he put it back into his shelves . If there were any Christian who could affront such an antagonist with a light heart , he felt with a shudder of memory it was not he . '
160368	160379	160307	160308	O God	4335	' he said to himself slowly as he moved away , '
160397	160708	160388	160388	I	0	' And of that night 's wrestle he said not a word to any living soul . He did penance for it in the tenderest , most secret ways , but he shrank in misery from the thought of revealing it even to Catherine . Meanwhile the poor poisoned folk at Mile End lived and apparently throve , in defiance of all the laws of the universe . Robert , as soon as he found that radical measures were for the time hopeless , had applied himself with redoubled energy to making the people use such palliatives as were within their reach , and had preached boiled water and the removal of filth till , as he declared to Catherine , his dreams were one long sanitary nightmare . But he was not confiding enough to believe that the people paid much heed , and he hoped more from a dry hard winter than from any exertion either of his or theirs . But , alas ! with the end of November a season of furious rain set in . Then Robert began to watch Mile End with anxiety , for so far every outbreak of illness there had followed upon unusual damp . But the rains passed , leaving behind them no worse results than the usual winter crop of lung ailments and rheumatism , and he breathed again . Christmas came and went , and with the end of December the wet weather returned . Day after day rolling masses of south - west cloud came up from the Atlantic and wrapped the whole country in rain , which reminded Catherine of her Westmoreland rain more than any she had yet seen in the South . Robert accused her of liking it for that reason , but she shook her head with a sigh , declaring that it was '
160714	160800	160805	160805	you	10864	' One afternoon she was shutting the door of the school behind her , and stepping out on the road skirting the green — the bedabbled wintry green — when she saw Robert emerging from the Mile End lane . She crossed over to him , wondering as she neared him that he seemed to take no notice of her . He was striding along , his wideawake over his eyes , and so absorbed that she had almost touched him before he saw her . '
160854	160861	160843	160843	Sharland	589	' She made a horrified exclamation . '
160866	160871	160872	160872	I	0	' he said gloomily , '
160911	161870	160897	160898	a nurse	10048	' In a few days the diphtheria epidemic in the hamlet had reached terrible proportions . There had been one death , others were expected , and soon Robert in his brief hours at home could find no relief in anything , so heavy was the oppression of the day 's memories . At first Catherine for the child 's sake kept away ; but the little Mary was weaned , had a good Scotch nurse , was in every way thriving , and after a day or two Catherine 's craving to help , to be with Robert in his trouble , was too strong to be withstood . But she dared not go backwards and forwards between her baby and the diphtheritic children . So she bethought herself of Mrs. Elsmere 's servant , old Martha , who was still inhabiting Mrs. Elsmere 's cottage till a tenant could be found for it , and doing good service meanwhile as an occasional parish nurse . The baby and its nurse went over to the cottage . Catherine carried the child there , wrapped close in maternal arms , and leaving her on old Martha 's lap , went back to Robert . Then she and he devoted themselves to a hand - to - hand fight with the epidemic . At the climax of it there were about twenty children down with it in different stages , and seven cases of fever . They had two hospital nurses ; one of the better cottages , turned into a sanatorium , accommodated the worst cases under the nurses , and Robert and Catherine , directed by them and the doctors , took the responsibility of the rest , he helping to nurse the boys and she the girls . Of the fever cases Sharland 's wife was the worst . A feeble creature at all times , it seemed almost impossible she could weather through . But day after day passed , and by dint of incessant nursing she still lived . A youth of twenty , the main support of a mother and five or six younger children was also desperately ill . Robert hardly ever had him out of his thoughts , and the boy 's dog - like affection for the rector , struggling with his deathly weakness , was like a perpetual exemplification of Ahriman and Ormuzd — the power of life struggling with the power of death . It was a fierce fight . Presently it seemed to the husband and wife as though the few daily hours spent at the rectory were mere halts between successive acts of battle with the plague - fiend — a more real and grim Grendel of the Marshes — for the lives of children . Catherine could always sleep in these intervals , quietly and dreamlessly ; Robert very soon could only sleep by the help of some prescription of old Meyrick 's . On all occasions of strain since his boyhood there had been signs in him of a certain lack of constitutional hardness which his mother knew very well , but which his wife was only just beginning to recognise . However , he laughed to scorn any attempt to restrain his constant goings and comings , or those hours of night - nursing , in which , as the hospital nurses were the first to admit , no one was so successful as the rector . And when he stood up on Sundays to preach in Murewell Church , the worn and spiritual look of the man , and the knowledge warm at each heart of those before him of how the rector not only talked but lived , carried every word home . This strain upon all the moral and physical forces , however , strangely enough , came to Robert as a kind of relief . It broke through a tension of brain which of late had become an oppression . And for both him and Catherine these dark times had moments of intensest joy , points of white light illuminating heaven and earth . There were cloudy nights — wet , stormy January nights — when sometimes it happened to them to come back both together from the hamlet , Robert carrying a lantern , Catherine clothed in waterproof from head to foot , walking beside him , the rays flashing now on her face , now on the wooded sides of the lane , while the wind howled through the dark vault of branches overhead . And then , as they talked or were silent , suddenly a sense of the intense blessedness of this comradeship of theirs would rise like a flood in the man 's heart , and he would fling his free arm round her , forcing her to stand a moment in the January night and storm while he said to her words of passionate gratitude , of faith in an immortal union reaching beyond change or death , lost in a kiss which was a sacrament . Then there were the moments when they saw their child , held high in Martha 's arms at the window , and leaping towards her mother ; the moments when one pallid sickly being after another was pronounced out of danger ; and by the help of them the weeks passed away . Nor were they left without help from outside . Lady Helen Varley no sooner heard the news than she hurried over . Robert , on his way one morning from one cottage to another , saw her pony - carriage in the lane . He hastened up to her before she could dismount . '
161882	161896	161876	161876	you	483	' he said to her peremptorily , as she held out her hand . '
161932	161968	161927	161927	I	0	' Robert shook his head , smiling . A common friend of theirs and hers had once described this little lady to Elsmere by a French sentence which originally applied to the Duchesse de Choiseul . '

162401	162409	162410	162410	Robert	359	' No , Lady Helen — no , '
162414	162429	162410	162410	Robert	359	' This is no place for you , and we are getting on capitally . '
162435	162457	162458	162458	she	483	' I believe you and Mrs. Elsmere are just killing yourselves all in a corner , with no one to see , '
162462	162502	162458	162458	she	483	' If you wo n't let me see , I shall send Sir Harry . But who'—and her brown fawn 's eyes ran startled over the cottages before her—'who , Mr. Elsmere , does this dreadful place belong to ? '
162503	162507	162509	162509	Robert	359	' Mr. Wendover , '
162512	162515	162516	162516	she	483	' Impossible ! '
162520	162535	162537	162537	she	483	' Why , I would n't ask one of my dogs to sleep there , '
162581	162590	162592	162592	Robert	359	' No , you would be ill advised , '
162611	162619	162592	162592	Robert	359	' But what is the agent about ? '
162731	162745	162746	162746	he	359	' Old Meyrick and I have taken things into our own hands now , '
162752	162836	162746	162746	he	359	' We have already made two cottages fairly habitable . To - morrow the inspector comes . I told the people yesterday I would n't be bound by my promise a day longer . He must put the screw on Henslowe , and if Henslowe dawdles , why we shall just drain and repair and sink for a well ourselves . I can find the money somehow . At present we get all our water from one of the farms on the brow . '
162837	162840	162842	162843	Lady Helen	483	' Money ! '
162858	162878	162881	162881	her	483	' Sir Harry shall send you as much as you want . And anything else — blankets — coals ? '
162933	162937	162911	162911	she	483	' to tell Harry '
162957	163012	162951	162951	her	483	' Oh , Mr. Elsmere , my aunt , Lady Charlotte , does nothing but talk about your sister - in - law . Why did you keep her all to yourself ? Is it kind , is it neighbourly , to have such a wonder to stay with you and let nobody share ? '
163013	163017	163019	163019	Robert	359	' A wonder ? '
163023	163034	163019	163019	Robert	359	' Rose plays the violin very well , but — — '
163035	163046	163048	163049	Lady Helen	483	' As if relations ever saw one in proper perspective ! '
163051	163093	163048	163049	Lady Helen	483	' My aunt wants to be allowed to have her in town next season if you will all let her . I think she would find it fun . Aunt Charlotte knows all the world and his wife . And if I 'm
163123	163194	163120	163121	Aunt Charlotte	616	' The little laughing face bent forward again ; Robert , smiling , raised his hat , and the ponies whirled her off . In anybody else Elsmere would have thought all this effusion insincere or patronising . But Lady Helen was the most spontaneous of mortals , and the only high - born woman he had ever met who was really , and not only apparently , free from the '
163199	164017	164021	164021	him	4367	' Robert shrewdly suspected Lady Charlotte 's social tolerance to be a mere varnish . But this little person , and her favourite brother Hugh , to judge from the accounts of him , must always have found life too romantic , too wildly and delightfully interesting from top to bottom , to be measured by any but romantic standards . Next day Sir Harry Varley , a great burly country squire , who adored his wife , kept the hounds , owned a model estate , and thanked God every morning that he was an Englishman , rode over to Mile End . Robert , who had just been round the place with the inspector and was dead tired , had only energy to show him a few of the worst enormities . Sir Harry , leaving a cheque behind him , rode off with a discharge of strong language , at which Robert , clergyman as he was , only grimly smiled . A few days later Mr. Wendover 's crimes as a landowner , his agent 's brutality , young Elsmere 's devotion , and the horrors of the Mile End outbreak , were in everybody 's mouths . The county was roused . The Radical newspaper came out on the Saturday with a flaming article ; Robert , much to his annoyance , found himself the local hero ; and money began to come in to him freely . On the Monday morning Henslowe appeared on the scene with an army of workmen . A racy communication from the inspector had reached him two days before , so had a copy of the Churton Advertiser . He had spent Sunday in a drinking bout , turning over all possible plans of vengeance and evasion . Towards the evening , however , his wife , a gaunt clever Scotchwoman , who saw ruin before them , and had on occasion an even sharper tongue than her husband , managed to capture the supplies of brandy in the house and effectually conceal them . Then she waited for the moment of collapse which came on towards morning , and with her hands on her hips she poured into him a volley of home - truths which not even Sir Harry Varley could have bettered . Henslowe 's nerve gave way . He went out at daybreak , white and sullen , to look for workmen . Robert , standing on the step of a cottage , watched him give his orders , and took vigilant note of their substance . They embodied the inspector 's directions , and the rector was satisfied . Henslowe was obliged to pass him on his way to another group of houses . At first he affected not to see the rector , then suddenly Elsmere was conscious that the man 's bloodshot eyes were on him . Such a look ! If hate could have killed , Elsmere would have fallen where he stood . Yet the man 's hand mechanically moved to his hat , as though the spell of his wife 's harangue were still potent over his shaking muscles . Robert took no notice whatever of the salutation . He stood calmly watching till Henslowe disappeared into the last house . Then he called one of the agent 's train , heard what was to be done , gave a sharp nod of assent , and turned on his heel . So far so good : the servant had been made to feel , but he wished it had been the master . Oh , those three little emaciated creatures whose eyes he had closed , whose clammy hands he had held to the last!—what reckoning should be asked for their undeserved torments when the Great Account came to be made up ? Meanwhile not a sound apparently of all this reached the squire in the sublime solitude of Murewell . A fortnight had passed . Henslowe had been conquered , the county had rushed to Elsmere 's help , and neither he nor Mrs. Darcy had made a sign . Their life was so abnormal that it was perfectly possible they had heard nothing . Elsmere wondered when they would hear . The rector 's chief help and support all through had been old Meyrick . The parish doctor had been in bed with rheumatism when the epidemic broke out , and Robert , feeling it a comfort to be rid of him , had thrown the whole business into the hands of Meyrick and his son . This son was nominally his father 's junior partner , but as he was , besides , a young and brilliant M.D. fresh from a great hospital , and his father was just a poor old general practitioner , with the barest qualification , and only forty years '

164593	164600	164602	164602	Robert	359	' Do n't abuse the man , '
164607	164624	164602	164602	Robert	359	' It 's not worth while , when you can say your mind of the master . '
164629	164632	164634	164634	Robert	359	' Well , '
164646	164678	164634	164634	Robert	359	' you told him the story , I suppose ? Seven deaths , is it , by now ? Well , what sort of impression did these unfortunate accidents'—and he smiled—'produce ? '
164679	164686	164688	164688	Meyrick	523	' He talked of sending money , '
164691	164726	164688	164688	Meyrick	523	' he said he would have Henslowe up and inquire . He seemed put about and annoyed . Oh , Mr. Elsmere , you think too hardly of the squire , that you do ! '
165200	165214	165215	165215	he	8600	' Ah well , I daresay it 's hard , it 's hard , '
165224	165278	165215	165215	he	8600	' to believe a man ca n't help himself . I daresay we doctors get to muddle up right and wrong . But if ever there was a man sick in mind — for all his book - learning they talk about — and sick in soul , that man is the squire . '
165398	165404	165405	165405	he	4414	' Ah , Mr. Elsmere , '

But when you were coming , and I heard tell all about you , I thought of my poor squire , and I said to myself , " That young man'll be good to him . The squire will make friends with him , and Mr. Elsmere will have a good wife — and there 'll be children born to him — and the squire will take an interest — and — and — maybe — — '

And it was a last chance ; and now its missed — it 's missed . Ah ! it 's no good talking ; he has a heart — he has ! Many 's the kind thing he 's done in old days for me and mine — I'll never forget them ! But all these last few years — oh , I know , I know . You ca n't go and shut your heart up , and fly in the face of all the duties the Lord laid on you , without losing yourself and setting the Lord against you . But it is pitiful , Mr. Elsmere , it 's pitiful ! '
165753	165781	165782	165783	The rector	8476	' Thank you , Meyrick , thank you , and God bless you ! Do n't imagine I will forget a word you have said to me . '
166296	166304	166292	166293	The soul	4450	' ampler æther , a diviner air . '

167320	167354	167355	167356	The squire	9352	' I have been here through the night , sitting up with one of the fever cases . It 's hard work for the nurses , and the relations sometimes , without help . '
167370	167375	167365	167365	Robert	359	' And Mrs. Elsmere ? '
167376	167413	167414	167415	The squire	9352	' Mrs. Elsmere was here most of yesterday . She used to stay the night when the diphtheria was at its worst ; but there are only four anxious cases left — the rest all convalescent . '

168251	168257	168258	168258	He	359	' Meyrick spoke of deaths . '

168575	168656	168569	168569	he	9352	' Mr. Elsmere , I did you a wrong — I did this place and its people a wrong . In my view , regret for the past is useless . Much of what has occurred here is plainly irreparable ; I will think what can be done for the future . As for my relation to you , it rests with you to say whether it can be amended . I recognise that you have just cause of complaint . '
168728	168762	168705	168705	He	313	' Let us be friends , Mr. Wendover . It will be a great comfort to us — my wife and me . Will you remember us both very kindly to Mrs. Darcy ? '

168912	168918	168919	168919	he	359	' Never think any more , '

He went home in much irritable discomfort . It seemed to him probably that fortune need not have been so eager to put him in the wrong . To relieve his mind he sent for Henslowe , and in an interview , the memory of which sent a shiver through the agent to the end of his days , he let it be seen that though it did not for the moment suit him to dismiss the man who had brought this upon him , that man 's reign in any true sense was over . But afterwards the squire was still restless . What was astir in him was not so much pity or remorse as certain instincts of race which still survived under the strange superstructure of manners he had built upon them . It may be the part of a gentleman and a scholar to let the agent whom you have interposed between yourself and a boorish peasantry have a free hand ; but , after all , the estate is yours , and to expose the rector of the parish to all sorts of avoidable risks in the pursuit of his official duty by reason of the gratuitous filth of your property , is an act of doubtful breeding . The squire in his most rough - and - tumble days at Berlin had always felt himself the grandee as well as the student . He abhorred sentimentalism , but neither did he choose to cut an unseemly figure in his own eyes .
169658	169670	169671	169671	he	465	' History would be inexplicable after all without the honest fanatic , '
169680	169703	169671	169671	he	465	' I suppose I had forgotten it . There is nothing like a dread of being bored for blunting your psychological instinct . '
170325	170347	170348	170349	The squire	9352	' Who would ever have thought of discovering instincts and aptitudes of such a kind in this long - legged optimist ? '
170419	170437	170439	170440	the squire	9352	' Why the deuce could n't he have given some rational account of himself to begin with ! '
170459	170475	170439	170440	the squire	9352	' And then the sending back of those books : what a piece of idiocy ! '

" And so long as they do n't run France into adventures , and a man can keep a roof over his head and a sou in his pocket , the men of letters at any rate can rub along . The really interesting thing in France just now is not French politics — Heaven save the mark!—but French scholarship . There never was so little original genius going in Paris , and there never was so much good work being done . '

171997	172027	171993	171994	the squire	9352	' as an intellectual force . They have n't got a writer , scarcely a preacher . Not one decent book has been produced on that side for years . '

172039	172049	172051	172051	he	359	' have lost all their best men of late , '
172063	172102	172109	172109	he	9352	' Oh , as to French Protestantism'—and the squire 's shrug was superb—'Teutonic Protestantism is in the order of things , so to speak , but Latin Protestantism ! There is no more sterile hybrid in the world ! '

172540	172564	172566	172566	Elsmere	359	' Generally the mornings — not always . A man with twelve hundred souls to look after , you know , Mr. Wendover , '

172635	172666	172619	172619	he	359	' of course I shall never do very much . But if I do n't , it wo n't be for want of knowing what the scholar 's ideal is . '
172919	172958	172915	172915	he	359	' I beg your pardon ? Mr. Wendover , it is too bad to interrupt you — I have enjoyed it immensely — but the fact is I have only two minutes to get to Sunday School in ! '
172970	172978	172979	172979	he	465	' It is I who should apologise , '
172985	173000	172979	172979	he	465	' for having encroached in this way on your busy day , Mr. Elsmere . '
173018	173079	173012	173013	the squire	9352	' You were preaching this morning on one of the Isaiah quotations in St. Matthew . It would interest you , I imagine , to see a recent Jewish book on the subject of the prophecies quoted in the Gospels which reached me yesterday . There is nothing particularly new in it , but it looked to me well done . '
173080	173084	173086	173086	Robert	359	' Thank you , '
173127	173133	173135	173136	the squire	9352	' Sunday School — pshaw ! '

173805	173808	173809	173809	he	9352	' Humph ! '

174038	174055	174017	174017	she	2651	' It is hard to be even a fraction less to him than I once was ! '
174386	174400	174401	174401	Robert	359	' I think we ought to understand one another perhaps , Mr. Wendover , '
174421	174615	174616	174617	The squire	9352	' I know your opinions , of course , from your books ; you know what mine , as an honest man , must be , from the position I hold . My conscience does not forbid me to discuss anything , only — I am no match for you on points of scholarship , and I should just like to say once for all , that to me , whatever else is true , the religion of Christ is true . I am a Christian and a Christian minister . Therefore , whenever we come to discuss what may be called Christian evidence , I do it with reserves , which you would not have . I believe in an Incarnation , a Resurrection , a Revelation . If there are literary difficulties , I must want to smooth them away — you may want to make much of them . We come to the matter from different points of view . You will not quarrel with me for wanting to make it clear . It is n't as if we differed slightly . We differ fundamentally — is it not so ? '
174669	174694	174659	174659	he	9352	' Your reminder is perfectly just . Naturally we all have our reserves . Neither of us can be expected to stultify his own . '
175151	175158	175160	175160	Catherine	358	' And now , of course , '
175162	175297	175160	175160	Catherine	358	' she is desperately disappointed that mamma and Agnes can not join her in town , as she had hoped . She does her best , I know , poor child , to conceal it and to feel as she ought about mamma , but I can see that the idea of an indefinite time at Burwood is intolerable to her . As to Berlin , I think she has enjoyed it , but she talks very scornfully of German Schwärmerei and German women , and she tells the oddest stories of her professors . With one or two of them she seems to have been in a state of war from the beginning ; but some of them , my dear Robert , I am persuaded were just simply in love with her ! '
175364	175375	175345	175345	she	369	' His next day 's letter contained the following : — '
175456	175510	175452	175454	such ghastly women	4796	' But since then Rose has been taking me into society . Yesterday afternoon , after I wrote to you , we went to see Rose 's artistic friends — the Piersons — with whom she was staying last summer , and to - day we have even called on Lady Charlotte Wynnstay . '
175648	175659	175660	175660	We	4804	' Then Lady Charlotte,—you would have laughed at our entrée . '
175870	176034	175855	175855	she	556	' We stayed about half an hour . One of the gentlemen was , I believe , a member of the Government , an under - secretary for something , but he and Rose and Lady Charlotte talked again of nothing but musicians and actors . It is strange that politicians should have time to know so much of these things . The other gentleman reminded me of Hotspur 's popinjay . I think now I made out that he wrote for the newspapers , but at the moment I should have felt it insulting to accuse him of anything so humdrum as an occupation in life . He discovered somehow that I had an interest in the Church , and he asked me , leaning back in his chair and lisping , whether I really thought " the Church could still totter on a while in the rural dithtricts . " He was informed her condition was so " vewy dethperate . " '
176135	176248	176126	176126	I	0	' Then when we got up to go , Lady Charlotte asked Rose to stay with her . Rose explained why she could n't , and Lady Charlotte pitied her dreadfully for having a family , and the under - secretary said that it was one 's first duty in life to trample on one 's relations , and that he hoped nothing would prevent his hearing her play some time later in the year . Rose said very decidedly she should be in town for the winter . Lady Charlotte said she would have an evening specially for her , and as I said nothing , we got away at last . '
176261	176399	176415	176415	she	4819	' I was much startled this morning . I had got Rose to come with me to the National Gallery on our way to her dressmaker . We were standing before Raphael 's " Vigil of the Knight , " when suddenly I saw Rose , who was looking away towards the door into the long gallery , turn perfectly white . I followed her eyes , and there , in the doorway , disappearing,—I am almost certain,—was Mr. Langham ! One can not mistake his walk or his profile . Before I could say a word Rose had walked away to another wall of pictures , and when we joined again we did not speak of it . Did he see us , I wonder , and purposely avoid us ? Something made me think so . '
176473	176496	176497	176497	Robert	359	' Yes , as you say , Burwood may as well be shut up or let . My dear , dear father ! '
176617	176794	176795	176795	Catherine	358	' I told you of my two dinners at the Hall ? The first was just tête - à - tête with the squire — oh , and Mrs. Darcy , of course . I am always forgetting her , poor little thing , which is most ungrateful of me . A pathetic life that , Catherine . She seems to me , in her odd way , perpetually hungering for affection , for praise . No doubt , if she got them , she would n't know what to do with them . She would just touch and leave them as she does everything . Her talk and she are both as light and wandering as thistledown . But still , meanwhile , she hungers , and is never satisfied . There seems to be something peculiarly antipathetic in her to the squire . I ca n't make it out . He is sometimes quite brutal to her when she is more inconsequent than usual . I often wonder she goes on living with him . '
176801	176804	176806	176806	Robert	359	' Yes , '
176810	176817	176806	176806	Robert	359	' Yes , it is bad . '
176864	176875	176850	176850	his	359	' On the second occasion we had Freake and Dashwood , '
176884	176947	176948	176948	He	359	' Very learned , very jealous , and very snuffy ; altogether " too genuine , " as poor mother used to say of those old chairs we got for the dining - room . But afterwards when we were all smoking in the library , the squire came out of his shell and talked . I never heard him more brilliant ! '
176972	176977	176978	176978	he	359	' Such a mind ! '
176987	177054	176978	176978	he	359	' such a memory ! Catherine , my book has been making great strides since you left . With Mr. Wendover to go to , all the problems are simplified . One is saved all false starts , all beating about the bush . What a piece of luck it was that put one down beside such a guide , such a living storehouse of knowledge ! '
177104	177123	177124	177124	he	359	' Do you think I am making knowledge too much of a god just now , Madonna mine ? '
177133	177196	177124	177124	he	359	' I have been full of qualms myself . The squire excites one so , makes one feel as though intellect — accumulation — were the whole of life . But I struggle against it — I do . I go on , for instance , trying to make the squire do his social duties — behave like " a human . " '
177206	177209	177210	177210	she	358	' Well ? '
177219	177271	177215	177215	his	359	' The squire is a tough customer — most men of sixty - seven with strong wills are , I suppose . At any rate , he is like one of the Thurston trout — sees through all my manœuvres . But one piece of news will astonish you , Catherine ! '
177282	177287	177273	177273	he	359	' Henslowe is dismissed . '
177288	177292	177293	177293	Catherine	358	' Henslowe dismissed ! '
177509	177524	177525	177526	Mr. Wendover	465	' His religious foundations are gone already , if he did but know it , '
177537	177556	177525	177526	Mr. Wendover	465	' but he will take so long finding it out that the results are not worth speculating on . '
177790	177798	177799	177799	he	313	' He has a wife and children , '
177808	177816	177818	177819	the squire	9352	' Of course I have pensioned him , '
177822	177840	177818	177819	the squire	9352	' otherwise I imagine he would be hanging round our necks to the end of the chapter . '

178319	178336	178317	178317	ye	3913	' she said sullenly , putting out a long bony arm in front of her husband , '
178361	178366	178368	178368	ye	3913	' turning to Elsmere , '
178394	178440	178389	178389	ye	3913	' And she motioned him out , not without a sombre dignity . Elsmere went home crestfallen . The enthusiast is a good deal too apt to under - estimate the stubbornness of moral fact , and these rebuffs have their stern uses for character . '
178453	178464	178449	178449	I	0	' Elsmere said , as he wound up the story , '
178549	178897	178900	178900	his	4881	' Catherine was irresponsive . The Old Testament element in her found a lawful satisfaction in Henslowe 's fall , and a wicked man 's hatred , according to her , mattered only to himself . The squire 's conduct , on the other hand , made her uneasily proud . To her , naturally , it simply meant that he was falling under Robert 's spell . So much the better for him , but — — That same afternoon Robert started on a walk to a distant farm , where one of his Sunday - school boys lay recovering from rheumatic fever . The rector had his pocket full of articles — a story - book in one , a puzzle map in the other — destined for Master Carter 's amusement . On the way he was to pick up Mr. Wendover at the park gates . It was a delicious April morning . A soft west wind blew through leaf and grass — The spring was stirring everywhere , and Robert raced along , feeling in every vein a life , an ebullience akin to that of nature . As he neared the place of meeting it occurred to him that the squire had been unusually busy lately , unusually silent and absent too on their walks . What was he always at work on ? Robert had often inquired of him as to the nature of those piles of proof and manuscript with which his table was littered . The squire had never given any but the most general answer , and had always changed the subject . There was an invincible personal reserve about him which , through all his walks and talks with Elsmere , had never as yet broken down . He would talk of other men and other men 's labours by the hour , but not of his own . Elsmere reflected on the fact , mingling with the reflection a certain humorous scorn of his own constant openness and readiness to take counsel with the world . '
178913	178918	178900	178900	his	4881	' Elsmere inwardly remarked . '
178937	178991	178931	178932	Mr. Wendover	465	' By the way , he had a letter from Langham in his pocket much more cheerful and human than usual . Let him look through it again . Not a word , of course , of that National Gallery experience!—a circumstance , however , which threw no light on it either way . '
179007	179011	178992	178992	I	0	' wrote Langham . '
179096	179218	179242	179242	he	465	' meetings , and all the rest of the wearisome Oxford make - believe , and the creature left behind feels lighter and nimbler than he has felt for years . I go to concerts and theatres ; I look at the people in the streets ; I even begin to take an outsider 's interest in social questions , in the puny dykes which well - meaning people are trying to raise all round us against the encroaching , devastating labour - troubles of the future . By dint of running away from life , I may end by cutting a much more passable figure in it than before . Be consoled , my dear Elsmere ; reconsider your remonstrances . '
179281	179288	179289	179289	he	465	' Do n't take me far , '
179297	179319	179289	179289	he	465	' I have not got the energy for it . I have been over - working , and must go away . '
179320	179331	179333	179333	Elsmere	359	' I have been sure of it for some time , '
179336	179381	179333	179333	Elsmere	359	' You ought to have a long rest . But may n't I know , Mr. Wendover , before you take it , what this great task is you have been toiling at ? Remember , you have never told me a word of it .
179425	179430	179431	179431	he	359	' A task indeed , '
179437	179506	179431	179431	he	359	' the task of a lifetime . To - day I finished the second third of it . Probably before the last section is begun some interloping German will have stepped down before me ; it is the way of the race ! But for the moment there is the satisfaction of having come to an end of some sort — a natural halt , at any rate . '
179514	179519	179521	179522	the squire	9352	' Oh , well , '
179525	179575	179521	179522	the squire	9352	' it is a book I planned just after I took my doctor 's degree at Berlin . It struck me then as the great want of modern scholarship . It is a History of Evidence , or rather , more strictly , " A History of Testimony . " '
179600	179605	179606	179606	he	359	' A great subject , '
179610	179624	179606	179606	he	359	' a magnificent subject . How have you conceived it , I wonder ? '
179625	179705	179706	179707	The squire	9352	' Simply from the standpoint of evolution , of development . The philosophical value of the subject is enormous . You must have considered it , of course ; every historian must . But few people have any idea in detail of the amount of light which the history of human witness in the world , systematically carried through , throws on the history of the human mind ; that is to say , on the history of ideas . '
179730	179735	179737	179737	Elsmere	359	' Oh , true ! '
179739	179760	179761	179761	He	9352	' most true . Now I know what vague want it is that has been haunting me for months — — '
179795	179800	179802	179802	Elsmere	359	' But go on , '
179804	179809	179802	179802	Elsmere	359	' please go on . '
179810	179816	179818	179819	the squire	9352	' Well , you remember , '
179822	179960	179818	179819	the squire	9352	' that when Tractarianism began I was for a time one of Newman 's victims . Then , when Newman departed , I went over body and bones to the Liberal reaction which followed his going . In the first ardour of what seemed to me a release from slavery I migrated to Berlin , in search of knowledge which there was no getting in England , and there , with the taste of a dozen aimless theological controversies still in my mouth , this idea first took hold of me . It was simply this:—Could one through an exhaustive examination of human records , helped by modern physiological and mental science , get at the conditions , physical and mental , which govern the greater or lesser correspondence between human witness and the fact it reports ? '
179961	179967	179969	179969	Robert	359	' A giant 's task ! '
179971	179975	179969	179969	Robert	359	' hardly conceivable ! '
180003	180006	180007	180007	he	9352	' Naturally , '
180010	180152	180007	180007	he	9352	' I soon saw I must restrict myself to European testimony , and that only up to the Renaissance . To do that , of course , I had to dig into the East , to learn several Oriental languages — Sanskrit among them . Hebrew I already knew . Then , when I had got my languages , I began to work steadily through the whole mass of existing records , sifting and comparing . It is thirty years since I started . Fifteen years ago I finished the section dealing with classical antiquity — with India , Persia , Egypt , and Judæa . To - day I have put the last strokes to a History of Testimony from the Christian era down to the sixth century — from Livy to Gregory of Tours , from Augustus to Justinian . '

180741	180785	180737	180737	he	465	' Well , as you will understand , it is tolerably difficult to summarise such a mass at a moment 's notice . But I can give you the lines of my last volumes , if it would interest you to hear them . '
181203	181284	181165	181166	Mr. Wendover	465	' Testimony like every other human product has developed . Man 's power of apprehending and recording what he sees and hears has grown from less to more , from weaker to stronger , like any other of his faculties , just as the reasoning powers of the cave - dweller have developed into the reasoning powers of a Kant . What one wants is the ordered proof of this , and it can be got from history and experience . '
181285	181496	181165	181166	Mr. Wendover	465	' To plunge into the Christian period without having first cleared the mind as to what is meant in history and literature by " the critical method , " which in history may be defined as the " science of what is credible , " and in literature as " the science of what is rational , " is to invite fiasco . The theologian in such a state sees no obstacle to accepting an arbitrary list of documents with all the strange stuff they may contain , and declaring them to be sound historical material , while he applies to all the strange stuff of a similar kind surrounding them the most rigorous principles of modern science . Or he has to make believe that the reasoning processes exhibited in the speeches of the Acts , in certain passages of St. Paul 's Epistles , or in the Old Testament quotations in the Gospels , have a validity for the mind of the nineteenth century , when in truth they are the imperfect , half - childish products of the mind of the first century , of quite insignificant or indirect value to the historian of fact , of enormous value to the historian of testimony and its varieties . '
181497	181567	181165	181166	Mr. Wendover	465	' Suppose , for instance , before I begin to deal with the Christian story , and the earliest Christian development , I try to make out beforehand what are the moulds , the channels into which the testimony of the time must run . I look for these moulds , of course , in the dominant ideas , the intellectual preconceptions and preoccupations existing when the period begins . '
181803	181951	181795	181795	you	4927	' In the next place , look for the preconceptions that have a definite historical origin ; those , for instance , flowing from the pre - Christian , apocalyptic literature of the Jews , taking the Maccabean legend of Daniel as the centre of inquiry — those flowing from Alexandrian Judaism and the school of Philo — those flowing from the Palestinian schools of exegesis . Examine your synoptic gospels , your Gospel of St. John , your Apocalypse , in the light of these . You have no other chance of understanding them . But so examined , they fall into place , become explicable and rational ; such material as science can make full use of . The doctrine of the Divinity of Christ , Christian eschatology , and Christian views of prophecy will also have found their place in a sound historical scheme ! '
181952	182092	181795	181795	you	4927	' It is discreditable now for the man of intelligence to refuse to read his Livy in the light of his Mommsen . My object has been to help in making it discreditable to him to refuse to read his Christian documents in the light of a trained scientific criticism . We shall have made some positive advance in rationality when the man who is perfectly capable of dealing sanely with legend in one connection , and , in another , will insist on confounding it with history proper , can not do so any longer without losing caste , without falling ipso facto out of court with men of education . It is enough for a man of letters if he has helped ever so little in the final staking out of the boundaries between reason and unreason ! '
182184	182196	182197	182197	he	4931	' I will not fight you any more , Mr. Wendover , '
182206	182276	182197	182197	he	4931	' I am perfectly conscious that my own mental experience of the last two years has made it necessary to re - examine some of these intellectual foundations of faith . But as to the faith itself , that is its own witness . It does not depend , after all , upon anything external , but upon the living voice of the Eternal in the soul of man ! '
182334	182407	182331	182331	he	9352	' No , let it be . Forget me and my book , Elsmere . Everything can be got out of in this world . By the way , we seem to have reached the ends of the earth . Those are the new Mile End cottages , I believe . With your leave , I 'll sit down in one of them , and send to the Hall for the carriage . '
182420	182427	182428	182428	he	9352	' I am a selfish idiot , '

182639	182687	182688	182689	Mr. Wendover	465	' Well , Squire ; well , Mr. Elsmere , are you going to have a look at those places ? Never saw such palaces . I only hope I may end my days in anything so good . Will you give me a lease , Squire ? '
183124	183132	183133	183133	he	359	' For the Catholic Church to confess , '
183139	183184	183133	183133	he	359	' that Daniel is an apocryphal book of the time of the Maccabees , would be to confess that she had made a mistake ; if she had made this mistake , she may have made others ; she is no longer divinely inspired . '
183264	183272	183273	183273	he	359	' Your arguments are useless and irrelevant , '
183278	183355	183273	183273	he	359	' However plausible may be your objections , the Book of Daniel is what it professes to be , because our Lord quoted it in such a manner as to distinctly recognise its authority . The All - True and All - Knowing can not have made a mistake , nor can He have expressly led His disciples to regard as genuine and Divine , prophecies which were in truth the inventions of an ingenious romancer . '
183385	183392	183393	183393	he	359	' Your arguments are perfectly just , '
183399	183457	183393	183393	he	359	' the book is a patriotic fraud , of no value except to the historian of literature . But how do you know that our Lord quoted it as true in the strict sense ? In fact He quoted it as literature , as a Greek might have quoted Homer , as an Englishman might quote Shakespeare . '
183556	183561	183563	183571	the ablest German exponent of the Book of Daniel	4965	' No reasonable man , '
183573	183834	183563	183571	the ablest German exponent of the Book of Daniel	4965	' can doubt'—that this most interesting piece of writing belongs to the year 169 or 170 B.C. It was written to stir up the courage and patriotism of the Jews , weighed down by the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes . It had enormous vogue . It inaugurated a new Apocalyptic literature . And clearly the youth of Jesus of Nazareth was vitally influenced by it . It entered into his thought , it helped to shape his career . But Elsmere did not trouble himself much with the critic , as at any rate he was reported by the author of the book before him . Long before the critical case was reached , he had flung the book heavily from him . The mind accomplished its further task without help from outside . In the stillness of the night there rose up weirdly before him a whole new mental picture — effacing , pushing out , innumerable older images of thought . It was the image of a purely human Christ — a purely human , explicable , yet always wonderful Christianity . It broke his heart , but the spell of it was like some dream - country wherein we see all the familiar objects of life in new relations and perspectives . He gazed upon it fascinated , the wailing underneath checked a while by the strange beauty and order of the emerging spectacle . Only a little while ! Then with a groan Elsmere looked up , his eyes worn , his lips white and set . '
183850	183886	183846	183846	God	304	' A slight sound overhead in Catherine 's room sent a sudden spasm of feeling through the young face . He threw himself down , hiding from his own foresight of what was to be . '
183903	184633	183894	183894	she	9656	' And he did face it through . The next three months were the bitterest months of Elsmere 's life . They were marked by anguished mental struggle , by a consciousness of painful separation from the soul nearest to his own , and by a constantly increasing sense of oppression , of closing avenues and narrowing alternatives , which for weeks together seemed to hold the mind in a grip whence there was no escape . That struggle was not hurried and embittered by the bodily presence of the squire . Mr. Wendover went off to Italy a few days after the conversation we have described . But though he was not present in the flesh the great book of his life was in Elsmere 's hands , he had formally invited Elsmere 's remarks upon it ; and the air of Murewell seemed still echoing with his sentences , still astir with his thoughts . That curious instinct of pursuit , that avid imperious wish to crush an irritating resistance , which his last walk with Elsmere had first awakened in him with any strength , persisted . He wrote to Robert from abroad , and the proud fastidious scholar had never taken more pains with anything than with those letters . Robert might have stopped them , might have cast the whole matter from him with one resolute effort . In other relations he had will enough and to spare . Was it an unexpected weakness of fibre that made it impossible?—that had placed him in this way at the squire 's disposal ? Half the world would answer yes . Might not the other half plead that in every generation there is a minority of these mobile , impressionable , defenceless natures , who are ultimately at the mercy of experience , at the mercy of thought , at the mercy ( shall we say ? ) of truth ; and that , in fact , it is from this minority that all human advance comes ? During these three miserable months it can not be said — poor Elsmere!—that he attempted any systematic study of Christian evidence . His mind was too much torn , his heart too sore . He pounced feverishly on one test point after another , on the Pentateuch , the Prophets , the relation of the New Testament to the thoughts and beliefs of its time , the Gospel of St. John , the evidence as to the Resurrection , the intellectual and moral conditions surrounding the formation of the Canon . His mind swayed hither and thither , driven from each resting - place in turn by the pressure of some new difficulty . And — let it be said again — all through , the only constant element in the whole dismal process was his trained historical sense . If he had gone through this conflict at Oxford , for instance , he would have come out of it unscathed : for he would simply have remained throughout it ignorant of the true problems at issue . As it was , the keen instrument he had sharpened so laboriously on indifferent material now ploughed its agonising way , bit by bit , into the most intimate recesses of thought and faith . Much of the actual struggle he was able to keep from Catherine 's view , as he had vowed to himself to keep it . For after the squire 's departure Mrs. Darcy too went joyously up to London to flutter a while through the golden alleys of Mayfair ; and Elsmere was left once more in undisturbed possession of the Murewell library . There for a while on every day — oh , pitiful relief!—he could hide himself from the eyes he loved . But , after all , married love allows of nothing but the shallowest concealments . Catherine had already had one or two alarms . Once , in Robert 's study , among a tumbled mass of books he had pulled out in search of something missing , and which she was putting in order , she had come across that very book on the Prophecies which at a critical moment had so deeply affected Elsmere . It lay open , and Catherine was caught by the heading of a section : '
184638	184751	183894	183894	she	9656	' She began to read , mechanically at first , and read about a page . That page so shocked a mind accustomed to a purely traditional and mystical interpretation of the Bible that the book dropped abruptly from her hand , and she stood a moment by her husband 's table , her fine face pale and frowning . She noticed , with bitterness , Mr. Wendover 's name on the title - page . Was it right for Robert to have such books ? Was it wise , was it prudent , for the Christian to measure himself against such antagonism as this ? She wrestled painfully with the question . '
184760	184771	184755	184755	I	0	' she said to herself with an almost agonised energy . '
184809	185404	184801	184801	he	4968	' So she stilled and trampled on the inward protest . She yearned to speak of it to Robert , but something withheld her . In her passionate wifely trust she could not bear to seem to question the use he made of his time and thought ; and a delicate moral scruple warned her she might easily allow her dislike of the Wendover friendship to lead her into exaggeration and injustice . But the stab of that moment recurred — dealt now by one slight incident , now by another . And after the squire 's departure Catherine suddenly realised that the whole atmosphere of their home - life was changed . Robert was giving himself to his people with a more scrupulous energy than ever . Never had she seen him so pitiful , so full of heart for every human creature . His sermons , with their constant imaginative dwelling on the earthly life of Jesus , affected her now with a poignancy , a pathos , which were almost unbearable . And his tenderness to her was beyond words . But with that tenderness there was constantly mixed a note of remorse , a painful self - depreciation which she could hardly notice in speech , but which every now and then wrung her heart . And in his parish work he often showed a depression , an irritability , entirely new to her . He who had always the happiest power of forgetting to - morrow all the rubs of to - day , seemed now quite incapable of saving himself and his cheerfulness in the old ways , nay , had developed a capacity for sheer worry she had never seen in him before . And meanwhile all the old gossips of the place spoke their mind freely to Catherine on the subject of the rector 's looks , coupling their remarks with a variety of prescriptions , out of which Robert did sometimes manage to get one of his old laughs . His sleeplessness , too , which had always been a constitutional tendency , had become now so constant and wearing that Catherine began to feel a nervous hatred of his book - work , and of those long mornings at the Hall ; a passionate wish to put an end to it , and carry him away for a holiday . But he would not hear of the holiday , and he could hardly bear any talk of himself . And Catherine had been brought up in a school of feeling which bade love be very scrupulous , very delicate , and which recognised in the strongest way the right of every human soul to its own privacy , its own reserves . That something definite troubled him she was certain . What it was he clearly avoided telling her , and she could not hurt him by impatience . He would tell her soon — when it was right — she cried pitifully to herself . Meantime both suffered , she not knowing why , clinging to each other the while more passionately than ever . One night , however , coming down in her dressing - gown into the study in search of a Christian Year she had left behind her , she found Robert with papers strewn before him , his arms on the table and his head laid down upon them . He looked up as she came in , and the expression of his eyes drew her to him irresistibly . '
185416	185457	184801	184801	he	4968	' He sat up , and with a pathetic gesture held out his arms to her . She came on to his knee , putting her white arms round his neck , while he leant his head against her breast . '
185469	185480	185459	185459	you	359	' she said presently , a pang at her heart . '
185485	185489	185481	185481	I	0	' he said , '
185495	185496	185459	185459	you	359	' '
185516	185520	185512	185512	you	359	' He started . '
185540	185580	185512	185512	you	359	' And he tightened his arms round her , happy once more for a moment in this environment of a perfect love . There was silence for a few moments , Catherine feeling more and more disturbed and anxious . '
185586	185598	185583	185583	your	359	' he said presently , his eyes still pressed against her , '
185642	185643	185631	185631	you	358	' '
185655	185660	185650	185650	her	4975	' said Catherine softly , '
185707	185708	185763	185763	you	0	' '
185720	185741	185763	185763	you	0	' cried Robert,—it was so new to her , the dear voice with this accent in it of yearning depression ! '
185846	185902	185903	185903	He	4985	' And Catherine , whose mere voice was as balm to this man of many impulses , repeated to him , softly in the midnight silence , those noble lines in which Wordsworth has expressed , with the reserve and yet the strength of the great poet , the loftiest yearning of the purest hearts — '
185909	185932	185954	185954	he	4985	' said Robert , drawing a long breath when she stopped , which seemed to relax the fibres of the inner man , '
185960	185961	185954	185954	he	4985	' '
185970	185985	185954	185954	he	4985	' cried Catherine , her look kindling , and her rare passion breaking through ; '
185991	186004	186005	186005	He	4985	' For her thoughts were with him of whom it was said , '
186025	186040	186041	186041	Robert	359	' But Robert 's only response was silence and a kind of quivering sigh . '
186043	186054	186041	186041	Robert	359	' she cried , pressing her cheek against his temple , '
186079	186080	186081	186081	Catherine	358	' '
186087	186107	186081	186081	Catherine	358	' he said to her , after another pause , in a tone of strange tension she never forgot ; '
186179	186184	186141	186141	I	0	' and he shuddered . '
186208	186361	187087	187087	Christ	447	' He pressed her to him convulsively , then gently released her . His solemn eyes , fixed upon her as she stood there beside him , seemed to forbid her to say a word more . She stooped ; she laid her lips to his ; it was a meeting of soul with soul ; then she went softly out , breaking the quiet of the house by a stifled sob as she passed upstairs . Oh ! but at last she thought she understood him . She had not passed her girlhood , side by side with a man of delicate fibre , of melancholy and scrupulous temperament , and within hearing of all the natural interests of a deeply religious mind , religious biography , religious psychology , and — within certain sharply defined limits — religious speculation , without being brought face to face with the black possibilities of '
186363	186365	187084	187084	I	0	' and '
186367	187080	187087	187087	Christ	447	' as barriers in the Christian path . Has not almost every Christian of illustrious excellence been tried and humbled by them ? Catherine , looking back upon her own youth , could remember certain crises of religious melancholy , during which she had often dropped off to sleep at night on a pillow wet with tears . They had passed away quickly , and for ever . But she went back to them now , straining her eyes through the darkness of her own past , recalling her father 's days of spiritual depression , and the few difficult words she had sometimes heard from him as to those bitter times of religious dryness and hopelessness , by which God chastens from time to time His most faithful and heroic souls . A half - contempt awoke in her for the unclouded serenity and confidence of her own inner life . If her own spiritual experience had gone deeper , she told herself with the strangest self - blame , she would have been able now to understand Robert better — to help him more . She thought as she lay awake after those painful moments in the study , the tears welling up slowly in the darkness , of many things that had puzzled her in the past . She remembered the book she had seen on his table ; her thoughts travelled over his months of intercourse with the squire ; and the memory of Mr. Newcome 's attitude towards the man whom he conceived to be his Lord 's adversary , as contrasted with Robert 's , filled her with a shrinking pain she dared not analyse . Still all through , her feeling towards her husband was in the main akin to that of the English civilian at home towards English soldiers abroad , suffering and dying that England may be great . She had sheltered herself all her life from those deadly forces of unbelief which exist in English society , by a steady refusal to know what , however , any educated university man must perforce know . But such a course of action was impossible for Robert . He had been forced into the open , into the full tide of the Lord 's battle . The chances of that battle are many ; and the more courage the more risk of wounds and pain . But the great Captain knows — the great Captain does not forget His own ! For never , never had she the smallest doubt as to the issue of this sudden crisis in her husband 's consciousness , even when she came nearest to apprehending its nature . As well might she doubt the return of daylight , as dream of any permanent eclipse descending upon the faith which had shone through every detail of Robert 's ardent impulsive life , with all its struggles , all its failings , all its beauty , since she had known him first . The dread did not even occur to her . In her agony of pity and reverence she thought of him as passing through a trial , which is specially the believer 's trial — the chastening by which God proves the soul He loves . Let her only love and trust in patience . So that day by day as Robert 's depression still continued , Catherine surrounded him with the tenderest and wisest affection . Her quiet common sense made itself heard , forbidding her to make too much of the change in him , which might after all , she thought , be partly explained by the mere physical results of his long strain of body and mind during the Mile End epidemic . And for the rest she would not argue ; she would not inquire . She only prayed that she might so lead the Christian life beside him , that the Lord 's tenderness , the Lord 's consolation , might shine upon him through her . It had never been her wo nt to speak to him much about his own influence , his own effect , in the parish . To the austerer Christian considerations of this kind are forbidden : '
187093	187471	187087	187087	Christ	447	' But now , whenever she came across any striking trace of his power over the weak or the impure , the sick or the sad , she would in some way make it known to him , offering it to him in her delicate tenderness , as though it were a gift that the Father had laid in her hand for him — a token that the Master was still indeed with His servant , and that all was fundamentally well ! And so much , perhaps , the contact with his wife 's faith , the power of her love , wrought in Robert , that during these weeks and months he also never lost his own certainty of emergence from the shadow which had overtaken him . And , indeed , driven on from day to day as he was by an imperious intellectual thirst which would be satisfied , the religion of the heart , the imaginative emotional habit of years , that incessant drama which the soul enacts with the Divine Powers to which it feels itself committed , lived and persisted through it all . Feeling was untouched . The heart was still passionately on the side of all its old loves and adorations , still blindly trustful that in the end , by some compromise as yet unseen , they would be restored to it intact . Some time towards the end of July Robert was coming home from the Hall before lunch , tired and worn , as the morning always left him , and meditating some fresh sheets of the squire 's proofs which had been in his hands that morning . On the road crossing that to the rectory he suddenly saw Reginald Newcome , thinner and whiter than ever , striding along as fast as cassock and cloak would let him , his eyes on the ground , and his wideawake drawn over them . He and Elsmere had scarcely met for months , and Robert had lately made up his mind that Newcome was distinctly less friendly , and wished to show it . Elsmere had touched his arm before Newcome had perceived any one near him . Then he drew back with a start . '

They turned towards the rectory together , Newcome still asking abrupt questions as to the squire , the length of time he was to be away , Elsmere 's work , parochial and literary , during the past six months , the numbers of his Sunday congregation , of his communicants , etc . Elsmere bore his catechism with perfect temper , though Newcome 's manner had in it a strange and almost judicial imperativeness . '

But I am in a state just now when I must fight my battles for myself , and in God 's sight only ! '
188090	188112	188075	188075	Newcome	478	' You are in trouble , Elsmere ; I felt it , I knew it , when I first saw you ! '

Catherine or a stray parishioner was almost always with him . All the while , vaguely , in the depths of consciousness , there was the knowledge that behind this piece of quiet water on which his life was now sailing , there lay storm and darkness , and that in front loomed fresh possibilities of tempest . He knew , in a way , that it was a treacherous peace which had overtaken him . And yet it was peace . The pressure exerted by the will had temporarily given way , and the deepest forces of the man 's being had reasserted themselves . He could feel and love and pray again ; and Catherine , seeing the old glow in the eyes , the old spring in the step , made the whole of life one thank - offering . On the evening following that moment of reaction in the Murewell library , Robert had written to the squire . His letter had been practically a withdrawal from the correspondence . '

Not for the money 's sake — there never was a more incredibly disinterested person born . But his work ? Well , who is to hinder his work ? Will he be the first parson in the Church of England who looks after the poor and holds his tongue ?

193861	194073	193844	193844	he	359	' For after the Lord had in this manner thus graciously delivered me , and had set me down so sweetly in the faith of His Holy Gospel , and had given me such strong consolation and blessed evidence from heaven , touching my interest in His love through Christ , the tempter came upon me again , and that with a more grievous and dreadful temptation than before . And that was , " To sell and part with this most blessed Christ ; to exchange Him for the things of life , for anything ! " The temptation lay upon me for the space of a year , and did follow me so continually that I was not rid of it one day in a month : no , not sometimes one hour in many days together , for it did always , in almost whatever I thought , intermix itself therewith , in such sort that I could neither eat my food , stoop for a pin , chop a stick , or cast mine eyes to look on this or that , but still the temptation would come : " Sell Christ for this , or sell Christ for that , sell Him , sell Him !

194231	194288	194293	194293	God	304	' Was it the summons of Truth which was rending the whole nature in this way ? Robert stood still , and with his hands locked behind him , and his face turned like the face of a blind man towards a world of which it saw nothing , went through a desperate catechism of himself .

194485	194560	194472	194472	He	0	' Now was the battle won , and down fell I as a bird that is shot from the top of a tree into great guilt and fearful despair . Thus getting out of my bed I went moping in the field ; but God knows with as heavy an heart as mortal man I think could bear , where for the space of two hours I was like a man bereft of life . '
194587	194807	194809	194809	God	304	' il gran rifiuto'—the greatest of which human daring is capable ? The lane darkened round him . Not a soul was in sight . The only sounds were the sounds of a gently - breathing nature , sounds of birds and swaying branches and intermittent gusts of air rustling through the gorse and the drifts of last year 's leaves in the wood beside him . He moved mechanically onward , and presently , after the first flutter of desolate terror had passed away , with a new inrushing sense which seemed to him a sense of liberty — of infinite expansion . Suddenly the trees before him thinned , the ground sloped away , and there to the left on the westernmost edge of the hill lay the square stone rectory , its windows open to the evening coolness , a white flutter of pigeons round the dovecote on the side lawn , the gold of the August wheat in the great cornfield showing against the heavy girdle of oak - wood . Robert stood gazing at it — the home consecrated by love , by effort , by faith . The high alternations of intellectual and spiritual debate , the strange emerging sense of deliverance , gave way to a most bitter human pang of misery . '
194817	195021	195022	195022	Robert	359	' ... There was a sound of a voice calling — Catherine 's voice calling for him . He leant against the gate of the wood - path , struggling sternly with himself . This was no simple matter of his own intellectual consistency or happiness . Another 's whole life was concerned . Any precipitate speech , or hasty action , would be a crime . A man is bound above all things to protect those who depend on him from his own immature or revocable impulses . Not a word yet , till this sense of convulsion and upheaval had passed away , and the mind was once more its own master . He opened the gate and went towards her . She was strolling along the path looking out for him , one delicate hand gathering up her long evening dress — that very same black brocade she had worn in the old days at Burwood — the other playing with their Dandie Dinmont puppy who was leaping beside her . As she caught sight of him , there was the flashing smile , the hurrying step . And he felt he could but just drag himself to meet her . '
195047	195048	195049	195049	I	0	' '
195055	195081	195049	195049	I	0	' he said , catching her hand , as it slipped itself under his arm , and clinging to it as though to a support . '
195096	195188	195049	195049	I	0	' His voice was light , but if it had not been so dark she must have been startled by his face . As they went on towards the house , however , she scolding him for over - walking , he won his battle with himself . He went through the evening so that even Catherine 's jealous eyes saw nothing but extra fatigue . In the most desperate straits of life love is still the fountain of all endurance , and if ever a man loved it was Robert Elsmere .
195230	195234	195242	195242	he	0	' fair weather snow '
195403	195813	195814	195814	Catherine	399	' And with this intellectual conscience he was no more capable of trifling than with the moral conscience . The night passed away . How the rare intermittent sounds impressed themselves upon him!—the stir of the child 's waking soon after midnight in the room overhead ; the cry of the owls on the oak - wood ; the purring of the night - jars on the common ; the morning chatter of the swallows round the eaves . With the first invasion of the dawn Robert raised himself and looked at Catherine . She was sleeping with that light sound sleep which belongs to health of body and mind , one hand under her face , the other stretched out in soft relaxation beside her . Her husband hung over her in a bewilderment of feeling . Before him passed all sorts of incoherent pictures of the future ; the mind was caught by all manner of incongruous details in that saddest uprooting which lay before him . How her sleep , her ignorance , reproached him ! He thought of the wreck of all her pure ambitions — for him , for their common work , for the people she had come to love ; the ruin of her life of charity and tender usefulness , the darkening of all her hopes , the shaking of all her trust . Two years of devotion , of exquisite self - surrender , had brought her to this ! It was for this he had lured her from the shelter of her hills , for this she had opened to him all her sweet stores of faith , all the deepest springs of her womanhood . Oh , how she must suffer ! The thought of it and his own helplessness wrung his heart . Oh , could he keep her love through it all ? There was an unspeakable dread mingled with his grief — his remorse . It had been there for months . In her eyes would not only pain but sin divide them ? Could he possibly prevent her whole relation to him from altering and dwindling ? It was to be the problem of his remaining life . With a great cry of the soul to that God it yearned and felt for through all the darkness and ruin which encompassed it , he laid his hand on hers with the timidest passing touch . '
195829	195953	195954	195954	Robert	359	' The next morning Catherine , finding that Robert still slept on after their usual waking time , and remembering his exhaustion of the night before , left him softly , and kept the house quiet that he might not be disturbed . She was in charge of the now toddling Mary in the dining - room when the door opened and Robert appeared . At sight of him she sprang up with a half - cry ; the face seemed to have lost all its fresh colour , its look of sun and air ; the eyes were sunk ; the lips and chin lined and drawn . It was like a face from which the youth had suddenly been struck out . '
195957	195966	195954	195954	Robert	359	' but her question died on her lips . '
195978	196003	195954	195954	Robert	359	' he said , groping his way , as it seemed to her , to the table , his hand leaning on her arm . '
196009	196052	195954	195954	Robert	359	' She restrained herself at once , put him into an armchair by the window , and cared for him in her tender noiseless way . But she had grown almost as pale as he , and her heart was like lead . '
196065	196088	196054	196054	you	10864	' he said presently , trying to smile with lips so stiff and nerveless that the will had small control over them . '
196114	196180	196112	196112	Robert	359	' But her voice had a note in it which in his weakness he could hardly bear . He thirsted to be alone again , to be able to think over quietly what was best for her — for them both . There must be a next step , and in her neighbourhood he was too feeble , too tortured , to decide upon it . '
196189	196208	196184	196184	dear	9802	' he said impatiently , as she tried to feed him ; then he added as he rose : '
196228	196266	196267	196267	Robert	359	' Catherine looked at him with eyes of utter dismay . The sustaining hope of all these difficult weeks , which had slipped with such terrible unexpectedness into their happy life , was swept away from her . '

196284	196297	196276	196276	I	0	' he said sharply , almost irritably . Then his tone changed : '
196305	196328	196303	196303	Catherine	399	' His eyes in their weariness seemed to entreat her not to argue . She stooped and kissed him , her lips trembling .
196329	196339	196303	196303	Catherine	399	' When do you want to go to Thurston ? '
196340	196370	196371	196371	She	5179	' As soon as possible . Can you find me my fishing - basket and get me some sandwiches ? I shall only lounge there and take it easy . '
196416	196425	196409	196409	she	5179	' Robert , you will come away soon . '

196460	196475	196438	196438	he	359	' Good - bye ! I shall be back some time in the afternoon . '
196535	196540	196541	196541	she	5179	' Oh , Robert , '
196561	196588	196541	196541	she	5179	' why wo n't you tell me , dear ? Why wo n't you let me share ? I might help you through — I might . '

198469	198497	198459	198459	He	5243	' The lad nodded with a guttural sound of assent . Then his new - born scientific ardour seemed to struggle with his rustic costiveness of speech . '

198522	198543	198517	198517	he	5244	' And he pulled out a well - thumbed handbook , and pointed to a cut of the grasshopper warbler . '
198546	198560	198517	198517	he	5244	' asked Robert , wondering the while at his own start of interest . '
198572	198588	198517	198517	he	5244	' said Ned , pointing , his brick - red countenance kindling into suppressed excitement . '
198594	198746	198517	198517	he	5244	' said the rector , and the two went off together . And sure enough , after a little beating about , they heard the note which had roused the lad 's curiosity , the loud whirr of a creature that should have been a grasshopper , and was not . They stalked the bird a few yards , stooping and crouching , Robert 's eager hand on the boy 's arm , whenever the clumsy rustic movements made too much noise among the underwood . They watched it uttering its jarring imitative note on bush after bush , just dropping to the ground as they came near , and flitting a yard or two farther , but otherwise showing no sign of alarm at their presence . Then suddenly the impulse which had been leading him on died in the rector . He stood upright , with a long sigh . '
198754	198759	198752	198752	Ned	664	' he said abruptly . '

199030	199171	199024	199024	Ned	664	' He stood still , towering over the slouching thick - set form beside him , his pale intensity of look giving a rare dignity and beauty to the face which owed so little of its attractiveness to comeliness of feature . He had the makings of a true shepherd of men , and his mind as he spoke was crossed by a hundred different currents of feeling — bitterness , pain , and yearning unspeakable . No man could feel the wrench that lay before him more than he . Ned Irwin said not a word . His heavy lids were dropped over his deep - set eye ; he stood motionless , nervously fiddling with his butterfly net — awkwardness , and , as it seemed , irresponsiveness , in his whole attitude . Robert gathered himself together . '
199181	199190	199024	199024	Ned	664	' he said with a change of tone . '
199202	199263	199024	199024	Ned	664	' And he turned away , striding swiftly over the short burnt August grass in the direction of the Murewell woods , which rose in a blue haze of heat against the slumberous afternoon sky . He had not gone a hundred yards before he heard a clattering after him . He stopped , and Ned came up with him . '

199297	199312	199313	199313	Robert	359	' I am going that way , I can leave un at the rectory . '
199318	199362	199366	199366	you	359	' They are no weight , Ned—'cause why ? I 've been lazy and caught no fish ! But there,'—after a moment 's hesitation he slipped off the basket and rod , and put them into the begrimed hands held out for them . '
199388	199400	199386	199386	you	359	' The boy was off with his booty in a second . '
199417	199476	199407	199407	he	5263	' said Robert sadly to himself , moving on , a little moisture in the clear gray eye . About three o'clock next day Robert was in Oxford . The night before he had telegraphed to ask if Grey was at home . The reply had been—'Here for a week on way north ; come by all means . '
199505	199547	199485	199485	he	0	' It is more than a year since I have set eyes on Grey , Catherine . And the day 's change would be a boon . I could stay the night at Merton , and get home early next day . '
199630	199639	199640	199640	he	0	' Have patience a little more , Catherine ! '
199644	199661	199640	199640	he	0	' Oh , how I have blessed you for silence ! Only till I come back ! '
199662	199668	199669	199669	she	358	' Till you come back , '
199673	199696	199669	199669	she	358	' I can not bear it any longer , Robert , that you should give others your confidence , and not me . '
199836	199875	199876	199876	Elsmere	359	' open windows , amid their shuttered neighbours , had a friendly human air . Yes ; Mr. Grey was in , and expecting Mr. Elsmere . Robert climbed the dim familiar staircase , his heart beating fast . '
199886	199959	199876	199876	Elsmere	359	' And the two men , after a grasp of the hand , stood front ing each other : Mr. Grey , a light of pleasure on the rugged dark - complexioned face , looking up at his taller and paler visitor . But Robert could find nothing to say in return ; and in an instant Mr. Grey 's quick eye detected the strained nervous emotion of the man before him . '
199992	199993	199978	199978	One	917	' '
199999	200023	199978	199978	One	917	' said Mr. Grey , scrutinising him , as he returned to his own book - littered corner of the window - seat . '
200058	200059	200042	200042	I	0	' '
200064	200070	200071	200071	I	0	' said Robert almost impatiently . '
200081	200094	200079	200079	Grey	399	' and he looked nervously out over garden and apple - trees , '
200123	200145	200146	200146	I	0	' He stopped . Mr. Grey was silent — his expression changing instantly , the bright eyes profoundly , anxiously attentive . '
200154	200166	200146	200146	I	0	' said Robert , after a moment , with quick abruptness , '
200226	200227	200219	200220	other persons	5274	' '
200233	200347	200230	200230	your	399	' echoed Mr. Grey in a low voice of astonishment . He sat looking at the face and figure of the man before him with a half - frowning expression . How often Robert had seen some rash exuberant youth quelled by that momentary frown ! Essentially conservative as was the inmost nature of the man , for all his radicalism there were few things for which Henry Grey felt more instinctive distaste than for unsteadiness of will and purpose , however glorified by fine names . Robert knew it , and , strangely enough , felt for a moment in the presence of the heretical tutor as a culprit before a judge . '
200359	200367	200369	200369	you	399	' he said , with an effort . '
200446	200546	200548	200548	you	399	' And at last his eyes met Mr. Grey 's firmly , almost with solemnity . It was as if in the last few moments he had been instinctively testing the quality of his own conduct and motives by the touchstone of the rare personality beside him ; and they had stood the trial . There was such pain , such sincerity , above all such freedom from littleness of soul implied in words and look , that Mr. Grey quickly held out his hand . Robert grasped it , and felt that the way was clear before him . '
200556	200569	200548	200548	you	399	' said Mr. Grey , and his tone was grave sympathy itself . '
200582	200583	200572	200572	you	399	' '
200595	200685	200584	200584	I	0	' said Robert ; and sitting there with his elbows on his knees , his gaze fixed on the yellowing afternoon sky , and the intricacies of the garden - walls between them and the new Museum , he went through the history of the last two years . He described the beginnings of his historical work , the gradual enlargement of the mind 's horizons , and the intrusion within them of question after question , and subject after subject . Then he mentioned the squire 's name . '
200688	200693	200584	200584	I	0	' exclaimed Mr. Grey , '
200720	200765	200706	200706	he	8701	' He spoke with the strong dislike of the idealist , devoted in practice to an everyday ministry to human need , for the intellectual egotist . Robert caught and relished the old pugnacious flash in the eye , the Midland strength of accent . '
200831	200910	200911	200911	I	0	' Mr. Grey was struck with the simplicity and fulness of the avowal . A lesser man would hardly have made it in the same way . Rising to pace up and down the room — the familiar action recalling vividly to Robert the Sunday afternoons of bygone years — he began to put questions with a clearness and decision that made them so many guides to the man answering , through the tangle of his own recollections . '
200914	200938	200911	200911	I	0	' said the tutor at last , his hands in the pockets of his short gray coat , his brow bent and thoughtful . '
201056	201062	201052	201054	the orthodox apologists	5282	' Robert shrugged his shoulders . '
201069	201074	201075	201075	I	0	' he said drearily , '
201244	201286	201233	201233	you	5280	' But his voice dropped . The momentary eagerness died away as quickly as it had risen , leaving nothing but depression behind it . Mr. Grey meditated . At last he said , with a delicate change of tone , — '
201306	201307	201308	201308	I	0	' '
201314	201325	201308	201308	I	0	' said Robert , turning away almost with a groan ; '
201369	201401	201404	201404	you	359	' The tutor 's eye flashed . Robert had gone back to the window , and was miserably looking out . After all , he had told only half his story . '
201413	201414	201404	201404	you	359	' '
201424	201439	201404	201404	you	359	' cried Robert , turning upon him , startled by the slow deliberate tone . '
201494	201495	201496	201496	I	0	' '
201499	201605	201496	201496	I	0	' said Elsmere quickly—'I know ; I can not conceive it , nor could you . Imagine standing up Sunday after Sunday to say the things you do not believe,—using words as a convention which those who hear you receive as literal truth,—and trusting the maintenance of your position either to your neighbour 's forbearance or to your own powers of evasion ! With the ideas at present in my head , nothing would induce me to preach another Easter Day sermon to a congregation that have both a moral and a legal right to demand from me an implicit belief in the material miracle ! '
201606	201609	201611	201613	the other gravely—'yes	5292	' Yes , '
201692	201692	201694	201694	his	0	'
201720	201726	201727	201727	he	359	' At the same time , '
201746	201809	201727	201727	he	359	' let me not be rash ! If you think this change has been too rapid to last — if you , knowing me better than at this moment I can know myself — if you bid me wait a while , before I take any overt step , I will wait — oh , God knows I will wait!—my wife — — '
201818	201822	201824	201825	Mr. Grey	399	' Your wife ! '
201829	201836	201824	201825	Mr. Grey	399	' Mrs. Elsmere does not know ? '
201837	201854	201855	201855	He	399	' My wife knows nothing , or almost nothing — and it will break her heart ! '
201980	202002	201964	201964	he	399	' Elsmere , it wo n't break her heart ! You are a good man . She is a good woman . '
202015	202060	202061	202061	He	399	' Take courage . Tell her at once — tell her everything — and let her decide whether there shall be any waiting . I can not help you there ; she can ; she will probably understand you better than you understand yourself . '
202128	202137	202138	202138	he	399	' It is hard , it is bitter , '
202148	202254	202138	202138	he	399	' I know it , I have gone through it . So has many and many a poor soul that you and I have known ! But there need be no sting in the wound unless we ourselves envenom it . I know — oh ! I know very well — the man of the world scoffs , but to him who has once been a Christian of the old sort , the parting with the Christian mythology is the rending asunder of bones and marrow . It means parting with half the confidence , half the joy , of life ! But take heart , '
202267	202898	202138	202138	he	399	' It is the education of God ! Do not imagine it will put you farther from Him ! He is in criticism , in science , in doubt , so long as the doubt is a pure and honest doubt , as yours is . He is in all life , in all thought . The thought of man , as it has shaped itself in institutions , in philosophies , in science , in patient critical work , or in the life of charity , is the one continuous revelation of God ! Look for Him in it all ; see how , little by little , the Divine indwelling force , using as its tools — but merely as its tools!—man 's physical appetites and conditions , has built up conscience and the moral life ; think how every faculty of the mind has been trained in turn to take its part in the great work of faith upon the visible world ! Love and imagination built up religion,—shall reason destroy it ! No!—reason is God 's like the rest ! Trust it,—trust him . The leading strings of the past are dropping from you ; they are dropping from the world , not wantonly , or by chance , but in the providence of God . Learn the lesson of your own pain,—learn to seek God , not in any single event of past history , but in your own soul,—in the constant verifications of experience , in the life of Christian love . Spiritually you have gone through the last wrench ; I promise it you ! You being what you are , nothing can cut this ground from under your feet . Whatever may have been the forms of human belief , faith , the faith which saves , has always been rooted here ! All things change,—creeds and philosophies and outward systems,—but God remains ! The lines dropped with low vibrating force from lips unaccustomed indeed to such an outburst . The speaker stood a moment longer in silence beside the figure in the chair , and it seemed to Robert , gazing at him with fixed eyes , that the man 's whole presence , at once so homely and so majestic , was charged with benediction . It was as though invisible hands of healing and consecration had been laid upon him . The fiery soul beside him had kindled anew the drooping life of his own . So the torch of God passes on its way , hand reaching out to hand . He bent forward , stammering incoherent words of assent and gratitude , he knew not what . Mr. Grey , who had sunk into his chair , gave him time to recover himself . The intensity of the tutor 's own mood relaxed ; and presently he began to talk to his guest , in a wholly different tone , of the practical detail of the step before him , supposing it to be taken immediately , discussing the probable attitude of Robert 's bishop , the least conspicuous mode of withdrawing from the living , and so on — all with gentleness and sympathy indeed , but with an indefinable change of manner , which showed that he felt it well both for himself and Elsmere to repress any further expression of emotion . There was something , a vein of stoicism perhaps , in Mr. Grey 's temper of mind , which , while it gave a special force and sacredness to his rare moments of fervent speech , was wo nt in general to make men more self - controlled than usual in his presence . Robert felt now the bracing force of it . '
202907	202920	202900	202900	you	5306	' Mr. Grey asked when at last Elsmere got up to go . '
202945	202946	202947	202947	I	0	' '
202951	202959	202947	202947	I	0	' said Robert , after a pause . '
202975	202994	203021	203022	poor thing	9462	' Mr. Grey did not press him . He rose and went with his visitor to the door . '
203046	204186	203029	203029	Elsmere	359	' They grasped each other 's hands . Mr. Grey followed him down the stairs and along the narrow hall . He opened the hall door , and smiled a last smile of encouragement and sympathy into the eyes that expressed such a young moved gratitude . The door closed . Little did Elsmere realise that never , in this life , would he see that smile or hear that voice again ! In half an hour from the time Mr. Grey 's door closed upon him , Elsmere had caught a convenient cross - country train , and had left the Oxford towers and spires , the shrunken summer Isis , and the flat hot river meadows far behind him . He had meant to stay at Merton , as we know , for the night . Now , his one thought was to get back to Catherine . The urgency of Mr. Grey 's words was upon him , and love had a miserable pang that it should have needed to be urged . By eight o'clock he was again at Churton . There were no carriages waiting at the little station , but the thought of the walk across the darkening common through the August moonrise had been a refreshment to him in the heat and crowd of the train . He hurried through the small town , where the streets were full of summer idlers , and the lamps were twinkling in the still balmy air , along a dusty stretch of road , leaving man and his dwellings farther and farther to the rear of him , till at last he emerged on a boundless tract of common , and struck to the right into a cart - track leading to Murewell . He was on the top of a high sandy ridge , looking west and north , over a wide evening world of heather and wood and hill . To the right , far ahead , across the misty lower grounds into which he was soon to plunge , rose the woods of Murewell , black and massive in the twilight distance . To the left , but on a nearer plane , the undulating common stretching downwards from where he stood rose suddenly towards a height crowned with a group of gaunt and jagged firs — landmarks for all the plain — of which every ghostly bough and crest was now sharply outlined against a luminous sky . For the wide heaven in front of him was still delicately glowing in all its under parts with soft harmonies of dusky red or blue , while in its higher zone the same tract of sky was closely covered with the finest network of pearl - white cloud , suffused at the moment with a silver radiance so intense that a spectator might almost have dreamed the moon had forgotten its familiar place of rising , and was about to mount into a startled expectant west . Not a light in all the wide expanse , and for a while not a sound of human life , save the beat of Robert 's step , or the occasional tap of his stick against the pebbles of the road . Presently he reached the edge of the ridge whence the rough track he was following sank sharply to the lower levels . Here was a marvellous point of view , and the rector stood a moment , beside a bare weather - blasted fir , a ghostly shadow thrown behind him . All around the gorse and heather seemed still radiating light , as though the air had been so drenched in sunshine that even long after the sun had vanished the invading darkness found itself still unable to win firm possession of earth and sky . Every little stone in the sandy road was still weirdly visible ; the colour of the heather , now in lavish bloom , could be felt though hardly seen . Before him melted line after line of woodland , broken by hollow after hollow , filled with vaporous wreaths of mist . About him were the sounds of a wild nature . The air was resonant with the purring of the night - jars , and every now and then he caught the loud clap of their wings as they swayed unsteadily through the furze and bracken . Overhead a trio of wild ducks flew across , from pond to pond , their hoarse cry descending through the darkness . The partridges on the hill called to each other , and certain sharp sounds betrayed to the solitary listener the presence of a flock of swans on a neighbouring pool . The rector felt himself alone on a wide earth . It was almost with a start of pleasure that he caught at last the barking of dogs on a few distant farms , or the dim thunderous rush of a train through the wide wooded landscape beyond the heath . Behind that frowning mass of wood lay the rectory . The lights must be lit in the little drawing - room ; Catherine must be sitting by the lamp , her fine head bent over book or work , grieving for him perhaps , her anxious expectant heart going out to him through the dark . He thinks of the village lying wrapped in the peace of the August night , the lamp rays from shop - front or casement streaming out on to the green ; he thinks of his child , of his dead mother , feeling heavy and bitter within him all the time the message of separation and exile . But his mood was no longer one of mere dread , of helpless pain , of miserable self - scorn . Contact with Henry Grey had brought him that rekindling of the flame of conscience , that medicinal stirring of the soul 's waters , which is the most precious boon that man can give to man . In that sense which attaches to every successive resurrection of our best life from the shades of despair or selfishness , he had that day , almost that hour , been born again . He was no longer filled mainly with the sense of personal failure , with scorn for his own blundering impetuous temper , so lacking in prescience and in balance ; or , in respect to his wife , with such an anguished impotent remorse . He was nerved and braced ; whatever oscillations the mind might go through in its search for another equilibrium , to - night there was a moment of calm . The earth to him was once more full of God , existence full of value . '
204198	204301	204303	204303	God	304	' he had said to Mr. Grey . And in this healing darkness it was as if the old loves , the old familiar images of thought , returned to him new - clad , re - entering the desolate heart in a white - winged procession of consolation . On the heath beside him the Christ stood once more , and as the disciple felt the sacred presence he could bear for the first time to let the chafing pent - up current of love flow into the new channels , so painfully prepared for it by the toil of thought . '
204308	204372	204305	204306	an impostor	5311	' What scorn the heart , the intellect , threw on the alternative ! Not in the dress of speculations which represent the product of long past , long superseded looms of human thought , but in the guise of common manhood , laden like his fellows with the pathetic weight of human weakness and human ignorance , the Master moves towards him — '
204553	204759	204760	204760	Robert	359	' So said the vision ; and carrying the passion of it deep in his heart the rector went his way , down the long stony hill , past the solitary farm amid the trees at the foot of it , across the grassy common beyond , with its sentinel clumps of beeches , past an ethereal string of tiny lakes just touched by the moonrise , beside some of the first cottages of Murewell , up the hill , with pulse beating and step quickening , and round into the stretch of road leading to his own gate . As soon as he had passed the screen made by the shrubs on the lawn , he saw it all as he had seen it in his waking dream on the common — the lamplight , the open windows , the white muslin curtains swaying a little in the soft evening air , and Catherine 's figure seen dimly through them . The noise of the gate , however — of the steps on the drive — had startled her . He saw her rise quickly from her low chair , put some work down beside her , and move in haste to the window . '
204762	204768	204760	204760	Robert	359	' she cried in amazement . '
204771	204793	204760	204760	Robert	359	' he answered , still some yards from her , his voice coming strangely to her out of the moonlit darkness . '
204812	204830	204809	204809	I	0	' She flew to the door , opened it , and felt herself caught in his arms . '
204838	204864	204831	204831	Robert	359	' she said , fluttering and shrinking , for all her sweet habitual gravity of manner — was it the passion of that yearning embrace ? '
204869	204870	204866	204866	you	359	' '
204889	204890	204892	204892	you	359	' '

204915	204924	204907	204907	I	0	' he said , hanging up his hat . '
204954	205077	204943	204943	you	359	' He came up to her , pushing back the thick disordered locks of hair from his eyes with one hand , the other held out to her . As he came under the light of the hall lamp she was so startled by the gray pallor of the face that she caught hold of his outstretched hand with both hers . What she said he never knew — her look was enough . He put his arm round her , and as he opened the drawing - room door holding her pressed against him , she felt the desperate agitation in him penetrating , beating against an almost iron self - control of manner . He shut the door behind them . '
205083	205091	205081	205081	Robert	359	' she said , clinging to him , '
205115	205132	205133	205133	My	0	' It was almost like a child 's wail . His brow contracted still more painfully . '
205136	205140	205133	205133	My	0	' he said ; '
205149	205188	205133	205133	My	0	' and he bent his head down to her as she lay against his breast , kissing her hair with a passion of pity , of remorse , of tenderness , which seemed to rend his whole nature . '
205197	205197	205195	205195	Robert	359	'
205324	205339	205305	205305	he	0	' My dear wife — you have loved me — you do love me ? '
205367	205370	205371	205371	he	0	' Catherine , '
205379	205421	205371	205371	he	0	' you remember that night you came down to me in the study , the night I told you I was in trouble and you could not help me . Did you guess from what I said what the trouble was ? '
205422	205425	205426	205426	she	9656	' Yes , '
205431	205450	205426	205426	she	9656	' yes , I did , Robert ; I thought you were depressed — troubled — about religion . '
205451	205456	205457	205457	he	0	' And I know , '
205588	205589	205590	205590	Robert	359	' '
205592	205600	205590	205590	Robert	359	' she said piteously , deadly pale , '
205606	205607	205590	205590	Robert	359	' '
205614	205660	205590	205590	Robert	359	' he cried , with a kind of moan of pity and misery . Then still holding her , he said , with strong deliberate emphasis , looking into the gray - blue eyes — the quivering face so full of austerity and delicacy , — '
205928	206038	205924	205924	God	304	' Catherine looked at him stupefied . The world seemed to be turning round her . Infinitely more terrible than his actual words was the accent running through words and tone and gesture — the accent of irreparableness , as of something dismally done and finished . What did it all mean ? For what had he brought her there ? She sat stunned , realising with awful force the feebleness , the inadequacy , of her own fears . He , meanwhile , had paused a moment , meeting her gaze with those yearning sunken eyes . Then he went on , his voice changing a little , — '
206108	206121	206092	206092	I	0	' She shivered . He stooped and kissed her hands again passionately . '
206134	206150	206154	206154	you	5336	' he cried . Then , restraining himself at once , he hurried on again : '
206228	206274	206180	206180	his	9352	' And again that bitter , perplexed , half - scornful sense of his own pliancy at the hands of circumstance as compared with the rigidity of other men descended upon him . Catherine made a faint movement as though to draw her hands away . '
206279	206296	206180	206180	his	9352	' she said , in a voice which sounded like a harsh echo of her own , '
206313	206457	206301	206302	a clergyman	9390	' He let her hands go , guided for the moment by a delicate imperious instinct which bade him appeal to something else than love . Rising , he sat down opposite to her on the low window seat , while she sank back into her chair , her fingers clinging to the arm of it , the lamplight far behind deepening all the shadows of the face , the hollows in the cheeks , the line of experience and will about the mouth . The stupor in which she had just listened to him was beginning to break up . Wild forces of condemnation and resistance were rising in her ; and he knew it . He knew , too , that as yet she only half realised the situation , and that blow after blow still remained to him to deal . '
206471	206482	206468	206469	the squire	9352	' he repeated , his face resting on his hands . '
206495	206915	206916	206916	Robert	359	' Then , still controlling himself rigidly , his eyes fixed on the shadowy face of his wife , his ear catching her quick uneven breath , he went once more through the dismal history of the last few months , dwelling on his state of thought before the intimacy with Mr. Wendover began , on his first attempts to escape the squire 's influence , on his gradual pitiful surrender . Then he told the story of the last memorable walk before the squire 's journey , of the moment in the study afterwards , and of the months of feverish reading and wrestling which had followed . Half - way through it a new despair seized him . What was the good of all he was saying ? He was speaking a language she did not really understand . What were all these critical and literary considerations to her ? The rigidity of her silence showed him that her sympathy was not with him , that in comparison with the vibrating protest of her own passionate faith which must be now ringing through her , whatever he could urge must seem to her the merest culpable trifling with the soul 's awful destinies . In an instant of tumultuous speech he could not convey to her the temper and results of his own complex training , and on that training , as he very well knew , depended the piercing , convincing force of all that he was saying . There were gulfs between them — gulfs which , as it seemed to him , in a miserable insight , could never be bridged again . Oh , the frightful separateness of experience ! Still he struggled on . He brought the story down to the conversation at the Hall , described — in broken words of fire and pain — the moment of spiritual wreck which had come upon him in the August lane , his night of struggle , his resolve to go to Mr. Grey . And all through he was not so much narrating as pleading a cause , and that not his own , but Love 's . Love was at the bar , and it was for love that the eloquent voice , the pale varying face , were really pleading , through all the long story of intellectual change . At the mention of Mr. Grey Catherine grew restless ; she sat up suddenly , with a cry of bitterness . '
206944	207093	206936	206936	He	359	' She clasped her hands round her knees , her beautiful mouth set and stern . The moon had been sailing westward all this time , and as Catherine bent forward the yellow light caught her face , and brought out the haggard change in it . He held out his hands to her with a low groan , helpless against her reproach , her jealousy . He dared not speak of what Mr. Grey had done for him , of the tenderness of his counsel towards her specially . He felt that everything he could say would but torture the wounded heart still more . But she did not notice the outstretched hands . She covered her face in silence a moment , as though trying to see her way more clearly through the mazes of disaster ; and he waited . At last she looked up . '
207104	207111	207099	207099	you	5343	' she said , almost harshly . '
207218	207223	207225	207225	you	5343	' and she faltered . '
207280	207326	207327	207327	I	0	' She threw an intensity into every word , which made the short breathless questions thrill through him , through the nature saturated and steeped as hers was in Christian association , with a bitter accusing force . But he did not flinch from them . '
207338	207349	207350	207350	Christ	447	' he said slowly , but with a resolute plainness . '
207409	207423	207440	207440	My	0	' His voice dropped to a whisper . She grew paler and paler . '
207428	207439	207440	207440	My	0	' she said presently in the same strange altered voice . '
207478	207483	207484	207484	you	0	' and she trembled , '
207496	207568	207484	207484	you	0	' It was agony to him to see her driving herself through this piteous catechism . The lantern of memory flashed a moment on to the immortal picture of Faust and Margaret . Was it not only that winter they had read the scene together ? Forcibly he possessed himself once more of those closely locked hands , pressing their coldness on his own burning eyes and forehead in hopeless silence . '
207574	207579	207570	207570	you	0	' she repeated insistently . '
207584	207593	207594	207594	I	0	' he said , his eyes still hidden . '
207627	207663	207622	207622	His	304	' The pressure of her despair seemed to be wringing his own faith out of him , forcing into definiteness things and thoughts that had been lying in an accepted , even a welcomed , obscurity .
207681	207691	207692	207692	she	5353	' And the end of it all , Robert ? '
207698	207730	207692	207692	she	5353	' Never did he forget the note of that question , the desolation of it , the indefinable change of accent . It drove him into a harsh abruptness of reply . '
207788	207851	207852	207852	Robert	359	' She caught her breath painfully . His heart was breaking for her , and yet there was something in her manner now which kept down caresses and repressed all words . Suddenly , however , as he sat there mutely watching her , he found her at his knees , her dear arms around him , her face against his breast . '
207985	208110	208112	208112	you	5362	' She pushed herself backwards , smiling at him with an exquisite tenderness . The tears were streaming down her cheeks . They were wet on his own . Another moment and Robert would have lost the only clue which remained to him through the mists of this bewildering world . He would have yielded again as he had many times yielded before , for infinitely less reason , to the urgent pressure of another 's individuality , and having jeopardised love for truth , he would now have murdered — or tried to murder — in himself the sense of truth for love . But he did neither . Holding her close pressed against him , he said in breaks of intense speech : '
208286	208286	208287	208287	She	5362	'
208507	208514	208515	208515	he	359	' Would you rather be alone ? '
209689	209692	209693	209693	he	359	' Catherine , '
209823	209830	209831	209831	he	359	' Would it prevent your sleeping , '
209836	209864	209831	209831	he	359	' if I came to read here , as I used to when you were ill ? I could shade the light from you , of course . '
209871	209880	209867	209867	her	5398	' But you — you ought to sleep . '
209892	209895	209896	209896	he	359	' Impossible ! '
209909	209918	209896	209896	he	359	' At any rate I will read first . '
210272	210339	210347	210349	a virgin best	5413	' carts , and shouting children carrying branches of mountain - ash — winding on and up into the heart of wild hills dyed with reddening fern , the sun - gleams stealing from crag to crag , and shoulder to shoulder ; inside , row after row of intent faces , all turned towards the central passage , and , moving towards him , a figure '
210351	210465	210347	210349	a virgin best	5413	' whose every step brings nearer to him the heaven of his heart 's desire . Everything is plain to him — Mrs. Thornburgh 's round cheeks and marvellous curls and jubilant airs , Mrs. Leyburn 's mild and tearful pleasure , the vicar 's solid satisfaction . With what confiding joy had those who loved her given her to him ! And he knows well that out of all griefs , the grief he has brought upon her in two short years is the one which will seem to her hardest to bear . Very few women of the present day could feel this particular calamity as Catherine Elsmere must feel it . '
210479	210488	210347	210349	a virgin best	5413	' he cried to her in his heart . '
210521	211167	210518	210518	I	0	' But it was impossible to him to sink himself wholly in the past . Inevitably such a nature as Elsmere 's turns very quickly from despair to hope ; from the sense of failure to the passionate planning of new effort . In time will he not be able to comfort her , and , after a miserable moment of transition , to repair her trust in him and make their common life once more rich towards God and man ? There must be painful readjustment and friction , no doubt . He tries to see the facts as they truly are , fighting against his own optimist tendencies , and realising as best he can all the changes which his great change must introduce into their most intimate relations . But after all can love and honesty and a clear conscience do nothing to bridge over , nay , to efface , such differences as theirs will be ? Oh to bring her to understand him ! At this moment he shrinks painfully from the thought of touching her faith — his own sense of loss is too heavy , too terrible . But if she will only be still open with him!—still give him her deepest heart , any lasting difference between them will surely be impossible . Each will complete the other , and love knit up the ravelled strands again into a stronger unity . Gradually he lost himself in half - articulate prayer , in the solemn girding of the will to this future task of a recreating love . And by the time the morning light had well established itself sleep had fallen on him . When he became sensible of the longed - for drowsiness , he merely stretched out a tired hand and drew over him a shawl hanging at the foot of the bed . He was too utterly worn out to think of moving . When he woke the sun was streaming into the room , and behind him sat the tiny Mary on the edge of the bed , the rounded apple cheeks and wild - bird eyes aglow with mischief and delight . She had climbed out of her cot , and , finding no check to her progress , had crept on , till now she sat triumphantly , with one diminutive leg and rosy foot doubled under her , and her father 's thick hair at the mercy of her invading fingers , which , however , were as yet touching him half timidly , as though something in his sleep had awed the baby sense . But Catherine was gone . He sprang up with a start . Mary was frightened by the abrupt movement , perhaps disappointed by the escape of her prey , and raised a sudden wail . He carried her to her nurse , even forgetting to kiss the little wet cheek , ascertained that Catherine was not in the house , and then came back , miserable , with the bewilderment of sleep still upon him . A sense of wrong rose high within him . How could she have left him thus without a word ? It had been her way , sometimes , during the summer , to go out early to one or other of the sick folk who were under her especial charge . Possibly she had gone to a woman , just confined , on the farther side of the village , who yesterday had been in danger . But , whatever explanation he could make for himself , he was none the less irrationally wretched . He bathed , dressed , and sat down to his solitary meal in a state of tension and agitation indescribable . All the exaltation , the courage of the night , was gone .
211180	211189	211190	211190	he	5416	' Your mistress must have been detained somewhere , '
211216	211223	211200	211200	Susan	672	' Leave breakfast things for one . '

211519	211559	211513	211513	her	674	' Shrinking from and detesting the blasphemies of his error , she began to doubt whether it was right in her to allow her son to live in her house and to eat at the same table with her ; '
211624	211663	211620	211620	she	420	' As soon as I heard that my husband had just expired , I said to Thee , O my God , Thou hast broken my bonds , and I will offer to Thee a sacrifice of praise ! '
212049	212054	212055	212055	she	458	' Oh , Robert ! '
212069	212078	212055	212055	she	458	' you look so pale , so sad . '
212079	212085	212086	212086	he	5429	' I have you again ! '
212098	212103	212104	212104	she	458	' I went away , '
212295	212392	212290	212290	I	0	' and she shuddered—'your death , or my death , and how this change in you would cleave a gulf of misery between us . And then I thought of losing my own faith , of denying Christ . It was a nightmare — I saw myself on a long road , escaping with Mary in my arms , escaping from you ! Oh , Robert ! it was n't only for myself,'—and she clung to him as though she were a child , confessing , explaining away , some grievous fault hardly to be forgiven . '
212463	212489	212438	212439	no one	8624	' She paused , struggling for breath . The terrible excitement of that bygone moment had seized upon her again and communicated itself to him . '
212496	212501	212438	212439	no one	8624	' she said sobbing , '
212821	212884	212885	212885	Robert	448	' And again she broke off , weeping , as if to the tender torn heart the only crime that could not be forgiven was its own offence against love . As for him he was beyond speech . If he had ever lost his vision of God , his wife 's love would that moment have given it back to him . '
212887	212904	212885	212885	Robert	448	' she said presently , urged on by the sacred yearning to heal , to atone , '

213505	213514	213503	213503	Robert	448	' she asked him , after a pause . '
213547	213621	213515	213515	I	0	' Catherine 's hands clasped each other still more closely . So then she had heard her husband 's voice for the last time in the public ministry of the Church , in prayer , in exhortation , in benediction ! One of the most sacred traditions of her life was struck from her at a blow . It was long before either of them spoke again . Then she ventured another question . '

213643	213652	213653	213653	he	671	' Shall we try London for a little ? '

213947	213976	213940	213940	he	671	' No , I had not forgotten it . Do n't go , Catherine — don't go . I must . But why should you go through it ? '

There against the wall stood the new glass cases he had wrung out of the squire , with various new collections lying near , ready to be arranged and unpacked when time allowed . The old collections stood out bravely in the added space and light ; the walls were hung here and there with a wonderful set of geographical pictures he had carried off from a London exhibition , and fed his boys on for weeks ; the floors were freshly matted ; the new pine fittings gave out their pleasant cleanly scent ; the white paint of doors and windows shone in the August sun . The building had been given by the squire . The fittings and furniture had been mainly of his providing . What uses he had planned for it all!—only to see the fruits of two years '

Robert had recognised the slouching gait and unwieldy form of Henslowe . There were at this moment all kinds of gruesome stories afloat in the village about the ex - agent . It was said that he was breaking up fast ; it was known that he was extensively in debt ; and the village shopkeepers had already held an agitated meeting or two , to decide upon the best mode of getting their money out of him , and upon a joint plan of cautious action towards his custom in future . The man , indeed , was sinking deeper and deeper into a pit of sordid misery , maintaining all the while a snarling exasperating front to the world , which was rapidly converting the careless half - malicious pity wherewith the village had till now surveyed his fall into that more active species of baiting which the human animal is never very loth to try upon the limping specimens of his race . Henslowe stopped and turned as he heard the steps behind him . Six months '
214857	214861	214863	214863	Robert	448	' Mr. Henslowe ! '
214869	214878	214863	214863	Robert	448	' may I speak to you a moment ? '
214991	215098	215099	215099	He	5539	' I am going away next week , Mr. Henslowe ; I shall be away some considerable time . Before I go I should like to ask you whether you do not think the feud between us had better cease . Why will you persist in making an enemy of me ? If I did you an injury it was neither wittingly nor willingly . I know you have been ill and I gather that — that — you are in trouble . If I could stand between you and further mischief I would — most gladly . If help — or — or money — — '
215161	215194	215196	215196	he	466	' I 'll thank you to make your canting offers to some one else , Mr. Elsmere . When I want your advice I 'll ask it . Good day to you . '
215215	215221	215223	215223	Robert	448	' Listen , Mr. Henslowe , '
215230	215479	215223	215223	Robert	448	' you know — I know — that if this goes on , in a year 's time you will be in your grave , and your poor wife and children struggling to keep themselves from the workhouse . You may think that I have no right to preach to you — that you are the older man — that it is an intrusion . But what is the good of blinking facts that you must know all the world knows ? Come , now , Mr. Henslowe , let us behave for a moment as though this were our last meeting . Who knows ? the chances of life are many . Lay down your grudge against me , and let me speak to you as one struggling human being to another . The fact that you have , as you say , become less prosperous , in some sort through me , seems to give me a right — to make it a duty for me , if you will — to help you if I can . Let me send a good doctor to see you . Let me implore you as a last chance to put yourself into his hands , and to obey him , and your wife ; and let me,'—the rector hesitated,—'let me make things pecuniarily easier for Mrs. Henslowe till you have pulled yourself out of the hole in which , by common report at least , you are now .

When I see you and people like you throwing yourselves at the heads of the people , I always think of Scaliger 's remark about the Basques : " They say they understand one another — I do n't believe a word of it ! " All that the lower class wants to understand , at any rate , is the shortest way to the pockets of you and me ; all that you and I need understand , according to me , is how to keep 'em

217150	217164	217140	217140	himself	4019	' said Robert , fixing him with a pair of deliberate feverish eyes , '

217181	217215	217140	217140	himself	4019	' said the squire , turning , however , to meet the rector 's look , his gold spectacles falling forward over his long hooked nose , his attitude one of sudden attention . '
217219	217244	217140	217140	himself	4019	' All his grievances against Elsmere returned to him . He stood aggressively waiting . Robert paused a moment , and then said abruptly — '

217305	217390	217302	217302	your	0	' he said , with quick imperativeness . Robert gave them . He admitted , as plainly and bluntly as he had done to Grey , the squire 's own part in the matter ; but here a note of antagonism , almost of defiance , crept even into his confession of wide and illimitable defeat . He was there , so to speak , to hand over his sword . But to the squire , his surrender had all the pride of victory . '
217399	217406	217410	217410	He	0	' asked the squire after several minutes '

Grey of St. Anselm's — you know him of course — was a very close personal friend of mine at Oxford . I have been to see him , and we agreed it was the only thing to do . '

217509	217547	217500	217501	the squire	9352	' Grey of course wanted you to set up a church of your own , or to join his ! He is like all idealists , he has the usual foolish contempt for the compromise of institutions . '
217548	217553	217555	217555	Robert	448	' Not at all , '
217558	217605	217555	217555	Robert	448	' you are mistaken ; he has the most sacred respect for institutions . He only thinks it well , and I agree with him , that with regard to a man 's public profession and practice he should recognise that two and two make four . '
217746	217903	217735	217735	himself	9352	' Why should you break up your life in this wanton way ? Who , in God 's name , is injured if you keep your living ? It is the business of the thinker and the scholar to clear his mind of cobwebs . Granted . You have done it . But it is also the business of the practical man to live ! If I had your altruist emotional temperament , I should not hesitate for a moment . I should regard the historical expressions of an eternal tendency in men as wholly indifferent to me . If I understand you aright , you have flung away the sanctions of orthodoxy . There is no other in the way . Treat words as they deserve . You'—and the speaker laid an emphasis on the pronoun which for the life of him he could not help making sarcastic—'you will always have Gospel enough to preach . '

You remember what I told you once about my " imps " ? I have seen them all my life , since I was a child in France with papa , and I have never been able to draw them till the last few weeks . They are such dears — such darlings ; every one will know them when he sees them ! There is the Chinese imp , the low smirking creature , you know , that sits on the edge of your cup of tea ; there is the flipperty - flopperty creature that flies out at you when you open a drawer ; there is the twisty - twirly person that sits jeering on the edge of your hat when it blows away from you ; and'—her voice dropped—'that ugly , ugly thing I always see waiting for me on the top of a gate .

In the next place , even supposing he had been ever inclined to fall in love with her , which her new sardonic fairness of mind obliged her to regard as entirely doubtful , he was a man to whom marriage was impossible . How could any one expect such a superfine dreamer to turn bread - winner for a wife and household ? Imagine Mr. Langham interviewed by a rate - collector or troubled about coals ! As to her — simply — she had misunderstood the laws of the game . It was a little bitter to have to confess it ; a little bitter that he should have seen it , and have felt reluctantly compelled to recall the facts to her . But , after all , most girls have some young follies to blush over . So far the little cynic would get , becoming rather more scarlet , however , over the process of reflection than was quite compatible with the ostentatious worldly wisdom of it . Then a sudden inward restlessness would break through , and she would spend a passionate hour pacing up and down , and hungering for the moment when she might avenge upon herself and him the week of silly friendship he had found it necessary as her elder and monitor to cut short ! In September came the news of Robert 's resignation of his living . Mother and daughters sat looking at each other over the letter , stupefied . That this calamity , of all others , should have fallen on Catherine , of all women ! Rose said very little , and presently jumped up with shining excited eyes , and ran out for a walk with Bob , leaving Agnes to console their tearful and agitated mother . When she came in she went singing about the house as usual . Agnes , who was moved by the news out of all her ordinary sangfroid , was outraged by what seemed to her Rose 's callousness . She wrote a letter to Catherine , which Catherine put among her treasures , so strangely unlike it was to the quiet indifferent Agnes of every day . Rose spent a morning over an attempt at a letter , which when it reached its destination only wounded Catherine by its constraint and convention . And yet that same night when the child was alone , suddenly some phrase of Catherine 's letter recurred to her . She saw , as only imaginative people see , with every detail visualised , her sister 's suffering , her sister 's struggle that was to be . She jumped into bed , and , stifling all sounds under the clothes , cried herself to sleep , which did not prevent her next morning from harbouring somewhere at the bottom of her , a wicked and furtive satisfaction that Catherine might now learn there were more opinions in the world than one . As for the rest of the valley , Mrs. Leyburn soon passed from bewailing to a plaintive indignation with Robert , which was a relief to her daughters . It seemed to her a reflection on '
220968	220983	220984	220984	Richard	501	' that Robert should have behaved so . Church opinions had been good enough for '
220986	220987	220984	220984	Richard	501	' '
221004	221264	221001	221002	all fools	5695	' The vicar , good man , was sincerely distressed , but sincerely confident , also , that in time Elsmere would find his way back into the fold . In Mrs. Thornburgh 's dismay there was a secret superstitious pang . Perhaps she had better not have meddled . Perhaps it was never well to meddle . One event bears many readings , and the tragedy of Catherine Elsmere 's life took shape in the uneasy consciousness of the vicar 's spouse as a more or less sharp admonition against wilfulness in match - making . Of course Rose had her way as to wintering in London . They came up in the middle of October while the Elsmeres were still abroad , and settled into a small house in Lerwick Gardens , Campden Hill , which Catherine had secured for them on her way through town to the Continent . As soon as Mrs. Leyburn had been made comfortable , Rose set to work to look up her friends . She owed her acquaintance in London hitherto mainly to Mr. and Mrs. Pierson , the young barrister and his æsthetic wife whom she had originally met and made friends with in a railway - carriage . Mr. Pierson was bustling and shrewd ; not made of the finest clay , yet not at all a bad fellow . His wife , the daughter of a famous Mrs. Leo Hunter of a bygone generation , was small , untidy , and in all matters of religious or political opinion '
221266	221556	221557	221557	I	0	' to an extreme . She had also a strong vein of inherited social ambition , and she and her husband welcomed Rose with greater effusion than ever , in proportion as she was more beautiful and more indisputably gifted than ever . They placed themselves and their house at the girl 's service , partly out of genuine admiration and good - nature , partly also because they divined in her a profitable social appendage . For the Piersons , socially , were still climbing , and had by no means attained . Their world , so far , consisted too much of the odds and ends of most other worlds . They were not satisfied with it , and the friendship of the girl - violinist , whose vivacious beauty and artistic gift made a stir wherever she went , was a very welcome addition to their resources . They fêted her in their own house ; they took her to the houses of other people ; society smiled on Miss Leyburn 's protectors more than it had ever smiled on Mr. and Mrs. Pierson taken alone ; and meanwhile Rose , flushed , excited , and totally unsuspicious , thought the world a fairy tale , and lived from morning till night in a perpetual din of music , compliments , and bravos , which seemed to her life indeed — life at last ! With the beginning of November the Elsmeres returned , and about the same time Rose began to project tea - parties of her own , to which Mrs. Leyburn gave a flurried assent . When the invitations were written , Rose sat staring at them a little , pen in hand . '
221569	221579	221560	221560	Catherine	458	' she remarked in a dubious voice to Agnes . '
221616	221617	221610	221610	they	5699	' '
221627	221684	221622	221623	poor Cathie	458	' said Agnes with sudden energy . Rose 's eyebrows went up . Agnes resented her ironical expression , and with a word or two of quite unusual sharpness got up and went . Rose , left alone , sprang up suddenly , and clasped her white fingers above her head , with a long breath . '
221703	221710	221711	221711	I	0	' she remarked with sarcastic emphasis . '
221735	222188	221711	221711	I	0	' She stayed so a minute or more ; then two tears suddenly broke and fell . She dashed them angrily away , and sat down again to her note - writing . Amongst the cards she had still to fill up was one of which the envelope was addressed to the Hon . Hugh Flaxman , 90 St. James 's Place . Lady Charlotte , though she had afterwards again left town , had been in Martin Street at the end of October . The Leyburns had lunched there , and had been introduced by her to her nephew , and Lady Helen 's brother , Mr. Flaxman . The girls had found him agreeable ; he had called the week afterwards when they were not at home ; and Rose now carelessly sent him a card , with the inward reflection that he was much too great a man to come , and was probably enjoying himself at country houses , as every aristocrat should , in November . The following day the two girls made their way over to Bedford Square , where the Elsmeres had taken a house in order to be near the British Museum . They pushed their way upstairs through a medley of packing - cases , and a sickening smell of paint . There was a sound of an opening door , and a gentleman stepped out of the back room , which was to be Elsmere 's study , on to the landing . It was Edward Langham . He and Rose stood and stared at each other a moment . Then Rose in the coolest , lightest voice introduced him to Agnes . Agnes , with one curious glance , took in her sister 's defiant smiling ease and the stranger 's embarrassment ; then she went on to find Catherine . The two left behind exchanged a few banal questions and answers . Langham had only allowed himself one look at the dazzling face and eyes framed in fur cap and boa . Afterwards he stood making a study of the ground , and answering her remarks in his usual stumbling fashion . What was it had gone out of her voice — simply the soft callow sounds of first youth ? And what a personage she had grown in these twelve months — how formidably , consciously brilliant in look and dress and manner ! Yes , he was still in town — settled there , indeed , for some time . And she — was there any special day on which Mrs. Leyburn received visitors ? He asked the question , of course , with various hesitations and circumlocutions . '
222239	222519	222222	222222	I	0	' The prospect offered could hardly have been more repellent to him , but he got out an acceptance somehow . She nodded lightly to him and passed on , and he went downstairs , his head in a whirl . Where had the crude pretty child of yester - year departed to — impulsive , conceited , readily offended , easily touched , sensitive as to what all the world might think of her and her performances ? The girl he had just left had counted all her resources , tried the edge of all her weapons , and knew her own place too well to ask for anybody else 's appraisement . What beauty — good heavens!—what aplomb ! The rich husband Elsmere talked of would hardly take much waiting for . So cogitating , Langham took his way westward to his Beaumont Street rooms . They were on the second floor , small , dingy , choked with books . Ordinarily he shut the door behind him with a sigh of content . This evening they seemed to him intolerably confined and stuffy . He thought of going out to his club and a concert , but did nothing , after all , but sit brooding over the fire till midnight , alternately hugging and hating his solitude . And so we return to the Wednesday following this unexpected meeting . The drawing - room at No . 27 was beginning to fill . Rose stood at the door receiving the guests as they flowed in , while Agnes in the background dispensed tea . She was discussing with herself the probability of Langham 's appearance . '
222528	222537	222538	222539	The poet	2032	' she pondered , while she shook hands . '
222551	222586	222550	222555	The ' cellist with the hair	12357	' cellist with the hair — or the lady in Greek dress — or the esoteric Buddhist ? What a fascinating selection ! I had really no notion we should be quite so curious ! '
222587	222596	222598	222612	a charming golden - bearded young German , viola in hand , bowing before her	5708	' Mees Rose , they vait for you , '
222673	222861	222646	222646	She	5709	' cello was divinely played by a Hungarian , of whose outer man it need only be said that in wild profusion of much - tortured hair , in Hebraism of feature , and swarthy smoothness of cheek , he belonged to that type which Nature would seem to have already used to excess in the production of the continental musician . Rose herself was violinist , and the instruments dashed into the opening allegro with a precision and an entrain that took the room by storm . In the middle of it , Langham pushed his way into the crowd round the drawing - room door . Through the heads about him , he could see her standing a little in advance of the others , her head turned to one side , really in the natural attitude of violin - playing , but , as it seemed to him , in a kind of ravishment of listening — cheeks flushed , eyes shining , and the right arm and high - curved wrist managing the bow with a grace born of knowledge and fine training . '
222868	222897	222898	222898	Joachim	627	' said an English professional to a German neighbour , lifting his eyebrows interrogatively . The other nodded with the business - like air of one who knows . '
222937	222938	222930	222930	He	627	' '
222956	223017	223018	223018	Vell	684	' And the questioner nudged his companion , dropping his voice . Langham would have given worlds to get on into the room , over the prostrate body of the speaker by preference , but the laws of mass and weight had him at their mercy , and he was rooted to the spot . The other shrugged his shoulders . '
223049	223233	223234	223235	Mr. Langham	464	' This whispered conversation went on during the andante . With the scherzo the two hirsute faces broke into broad smiles . The artist behind each woke up , and Langham heard no more , except guttural sounds of delight and quick notes of technical criticism . How that Scherzo danced and coquetted , and how the Presto flew as though all the winds were behind it , chasing its mad eddies of notes through listening space ! At the end , amid a wild storm of applause , she laid down her violin , and , proudly smiling , her breast still heaving with excitement and exertion , received the praises of those crowding round her . The group round the door was precipitated forward , and Langham with it . She saw him in a moment . Her white brow contracted , and she gave him a quick but hardly smiling glance of recognition through the crowd . He thought there was no chance of getting at her , and moved aside amid the general hubbub to look at a picture . '
223242	223317	223239	223239	you	464	' He turned sharply and found her beside him . She had come to him with malice in her heart — malice born of smart and long smouldering pain ; but as she caught his look , the look of the nervous short - sighted scholar and recluse , as her glance swept over the delicate refinement of the face , a sudden softness quivered in her own . The game was so defenceless ! '
223326	223337	223323	223323	you	464	' she said abruptly , a little under her breath . '
223358	223359	223354	223354	I	0	' '
223395	223396	223373	223374	Miss Leyburn	369	' '
223400	223408	223410	223410	you	464	' she said , with frank audacity , '
223415	223422	223373	223374	Miss Leyburn	369	' His eye kindled at once . '
223459	223460	223453	223453	you	464	' '
223463	223511	223453	223453	you	464	' She glanced at him from under her long lashes , one hand playing with the rings on the other . He thought , suddenly , with a sting of regret , of the confiding child who had flushed under his praise that Sunday evening at Murewell . '
223514	223523	223524	223524	I	0	' he said , but half - mechanically . '
223575	223576	223578	223578	you	464	' '
223589	223629	223630	223630	I	0	' she said scornfully . Her manner was by no means simple . He did not feel himself at all at ease with her . His very embarrassment , however , drove him into rashness , as often happens . '
223639	223683	223630	223630	I	0	' he said in another tone ; and his black eyes , sparkling as though a film had dropped from them , supplied the reference his words forbore . She turned away from him with a perceptible drawing up of the whole figure . '
223691	223927	223685	223685	you	464	' she asked him coldly . He bowed as coldly and followed her . Wholesome resentment of her manner was denied him . He had asked for her friendship , and had then gone away and forgotten her . Clearly what she meant him to see now was that they were strangers again . Well , she was amply in her right . He suspected that his allusion to their first talk over the fire had not been unwelcome to her , as an opportunity . And he had actually debated whether he should come , lest in spite of himself she might beguile him once more into those old lapses of will and common sense ! Coxcomb ! He made a few spasmodic efforts at conversation with the lady to whom she had introduced him , then awkwardly disengaged himself and went to stand in a corner and study his neighbours . Close to him , he found , was the poet of the party , got up in the most correct professional costume — long hair , velvet coat , eyeglass and all . His extravagance , however , was of the most conventional type . Only his vanity had a touch of the sublime . Langham , who possessed a sort of fine - ear gift for catching conversation , heard him saying to an open - eyed ingénue beside him , — '
223951	223952	223938	223938	I	0	' '
223958	223984	223955	223956	Mr. Wood	686	' said the maiden , mildly protesting against so much modesty . He smiled , thrusting his hand into the breast of the velvet coat . '
223988	224000	223955	223956	Mr. Wood	686	' he said , in a tone of the purest candour , '
224013	224302	224303	224303	Victoria	687	' Langham , who , like all shy men , was liable to occasional explosions , was seized with a convulsive fit of coughing , and had to retire from the neighbourhood of the bard , who looked round him , disturbed and slightly frowning . At last he discovered a point of view in the back room whence he could watch the humours of the crowd without coming too closely in contact with them . What a miscellaneous collection it was ! He began to be irritably jealous for Rose 's place in the world . She ought to be more adequately surrounded than this . What was Mrs. Leyburn — what were the Elsmeres about ? He rebelled against the thought of her living perpetually among her inferiors , the centre of a vulgar publicity , queen of the second - rate . It provoked him that she should be amusing herself so well . Her laughter , every now and then , came ringing into the back room . And presently there was a general hubbub . Langham craned his neck forward , and saw a struggle going on over a roll of music , between Rose and the long - haired , long - nosed violoncellist . Evidently she did not want to play some particular piece , and wished to put it out of sight . Whereupon the Hungarian , who had been clamouring for it , rushed to its rescue , and there was a mock fight over it . At last , amid the applause of the room , Rose was beaten , and her conqueror , flourishing the music on high , executed a kind of pas seul of triumph . '
224305	224309	224303	224303	Victoria	687	' he cried . '
224338	224339	224333	224334	the French	688	' '
224354	224390	224333	224334	the French	688	' said Rose , with fine emphasis , crossing her white wrists before her . The Hungarian looked at her , the wild poetic strain in him which was the strain of race asserting itself . '
224397	224408	224393	224394	de victor	5730	' he said , dropping on one knee before her . '
224421	224648	224413	224413	his	5730	' The circle round them applauded hotly , the touch of theatricality finding immediate response . Langham was remorselessly conscious of the man 's absurd chevelure and ill- fitting clothes . But Rose herself had evidently nothing but relish for the scene . Proudly smiling , she held out her hand for her property , and as soon as she had it safe , she whisked it into the open drawer of a cabinet standing near , and drawing out the key , held it up a moment in her taper fingers , and then , depositing it in a little velvet bag hanging at her girdle , she closed the snap upon it with a little vindictive wave of triumph . Every movement was graceful , rapid , effective . Half a dozen German throats broke into guttural protest . Amid the storm of laughter and remonstrance , the door suddenly opened . The fluttered parlour - maid mumbled a long name , and , with a port of soldierly uprightness , there advanced behind her a large fair - haired woman , followed by a gentleman , and in the distance by another figure . Rose drew back a moment astounded , one hand on the piano , her dress sweeping round her . An awkward silence fell on the chattering circle of musicians . '
224652	224658	224413	224413	his	5730	' said Langham to himself , '

224981	225005	224973	224973	I	0	' said Mr. Flaxman , looking down upon her , his well - bred , slightly worn face aglow with animation and pleasure . '
225012	225060	224973	224973	I	0	' said Rose , laughing , as she escaped from him a moment , to arrange for a song from a tall formidable maiden , built after the fashion of Mr. Gilbert 's contralto heroines , with a voice which bore out the ample promise of her frame .
225061	225076	225078	225079	Lady Charlotte	556	' Your sister is a terribly self - possessed young person , Mr. Elsmere , '
225089	225103	225105	225105	Robert	359	' Does that imply praise or blame on your part , Lady Charlotte ? '
225109	225158	225105	225105	Robert	359	' Neither at present . I do n't know Miss Leyburn well enough . I merely state a fact . No tea , Mr. Elsmere . I have had three teas already , and I am not like the American woman who could always worry down another cup . '
225238	225247	225248	225248	she	556	' The art of singing has gone out . '
225251	225284	225248	225248	she	556	' since the Germans have been allowed to meddle in it . By the way , Mr. Elsmere , how do you manage to be here ? Are you taking a holiday ? '
225293	225302	225285	225285	Robert	359	' I have left Murewell , Lady Charlotte . '
225303	225307	225308	225308	she	556	' Left Murewell ! '
225326	225342	225308	225308	she	556	' Why has Helen told me nothing about it ? Have you got another living ? '
225343	225368	225323	225323	her	556	' No . My wife and I are settling in London . We only told Lady Helen of our intentions a few weeks ago . '
225430	225457	225425	225425	she	556	' You do n't mean to tell me any more , I can see , Mr. Elsmere . But you will allow me to be astonished ? '
225458	225461	225462	225462	he	313	' Certainly , '
225475	225484	225485	225485	he	313	' Have you heard of the squire lately ? '
225492	225553	225485	225485	he	313	' Not from him . We are excellent friends when we meet , but he does n't consider me worth writing to . His sister — little idiot — writes to me every now and then . But she has not vouchsafed me a letter since the summer . I should say from the last accounts that he was breaking . '
225554	225567	225569	225569	Robert	359	' He had a mysterious attack of illness just before I left , '
225572	225578	225569	225569	Robert	359	' It made one anxious . '
225579	225652	225653	225653	She	5745	' Oh , it is the old story . All the Wendovers have died of weak hearts or queer brains — generally of both together . I imagine you had some experience of the squire 's queerness at one time , Mr. Elsmere . I ca n't say you and he seemed to be on particularly good terms on the only occasion I ever had the pleasure of meeting you at Murewell . '

She had always the sort of manner that provoked people one moment and charmed them the next . And , to judge by my few words with her just now , I should say she had developed it finely . Well , now , Mr. Elsmere , who is going to take care of her ? '
225913	225928	225789	225789	she	556	' I suppose we shall all have a try at it , Lady Charlotte . '

225998	226010	226012	226012	Langham	464	' Elsmere , who is that man talking to Miss Leyburn ? '
226030	226073	226012	226012	Langham	464	' A certain Mr. Flaxman , brother to a pretty little neighbour of ours in Surrey — Lady Helen Varley — and nephew to Lady Charlotte . I have not seen him here before ; but I think the girls like him . '
226074	226089	225945	225946	Lady Charlotte	556	' Is he the Flaxman who got the mathematical prize at Berlin last year ? '
226090	226174	226012	226012	Langham	464	' Yes , I believe so . A striking person altogether . He is enormously rich , Lady Helen tells me , in spite of an elder brother . All the money in his mother 's family has come to him , and he is the heir to Lord Daniel 's great Derbyshire property . Twelve years ago I used to hear him talked about incessantly by the Cambridge men one met . " Citizen Flaxman " they called him , for his opinions '
226200	226282	226283	226283	Langham	464	' butlers . The scouts and the butlers put an end to that , and altogether , I imagine , the world disappointed him . He has a story , poor fellow , too — a young wife , who died with her first baby ten years ago . The world supposes him never to have got over it , which makes him all the more interesting . A distinguished face , do n't you think?—the good type of English aristocrat . '

226569	226575	226576	226576	she	369	' Are you here still ? '
226636	226662	226619	226619	she	369	' We are not always in this turmoil , Mr. Langham . Perhaps some other day you will come and make friends with my mother ? '

227419	227922	227405	227405	His	313	' sailing the seas where there was never sand'—the vast shadowy seas of speculative thought . All his life , reserve to those nearest to him had been pain and grief to him . He was one of those people , as we know , who throw off readily ; to whom sympathy , expansion , are indispensable ; who suffer physically and mentally from anything cold and rigid beside them . And now , at every turn , in their talk , their reading , in many of the smallest details of their common existence , Elsmere began to feel the presence of this cold and rigid something . He was ever conscious of self - defence on her side , of pained drawing back on his . And with every succeeding effort of his at self - repression , it seemed to him as though fresh nails were driven into the coffin of that old free habit of perfect confidence which had made the heaven of their life since they had been man and wife . He sat on for long , through the September evening , pondering , wrestling . Was it simply inevitable , the natural result of his own act , and of her antecedents , to which he must submit himself , as to any mutilation or loss of power in the body ? The young lover and husband rebelled — the believer rebelled — against the admission . Probably if his change had left him anchorless and forsaken , as it leaves many men , he would have been ready enough to submit , in terror lest his own forlornness should bring about hers . But in spite of the intellectual confusion , which inevitably attends any wholesale reconstruction of a man 's platform of action , he had never been more sure of God , or the Divine aims of the world , than now ; never more open than now , amid this exquisite Alpine world , to those passionate moments of religious trust which are man 's eternal defiance to the iron silences about him . Originally , as we know , he had shrunk from the thought of change in her corresponding to his own ; now that his own foothold was strengthening , his longing for a new union was overpowering that old dread . The proselytising instinct may be never quite morally defensible , even as between husband and wife . Nevertheless , in all strong , convinced , and ardent souls it exists , and must be reckoned with . At last one evening he was overcome by a sudden impulse which neutralised for the moment his nervous dread of hurting her . Some little incident of their day together was rankling , and it was borne in upon him that almost any violent protest on her part would have been preferable to this constant soft evasion of hers , which was gradually , imperceptibly dividing heart from heart .

You always stop me when I try . I believe you think of me as having thrown it all away . Would it not comfort you sometimes , if you knew that although much of the Gospels , this very raising of Lazarus , for instance , seem to me no longer true in the historical sense , still they are always full to me of an ideal , a poetical truth ? Lazarus may not have died and come to life , may never have existed ; but still to me , now as always , love for Jesus of Nazareth is " resurrection " and " life " ? '
228674	228706	228664	228664	Catherine	358	' If the Gospels are not true in fact , as history , as reality , I can not see how they are true at all , or of any value . '

And all the time this is going on , are you and I to remain strangers to one another in all that concerns our truest life — are we , Catherine ? '

231691	231751	231666	231666	Armitstead	671	' If it were not for the Gospels and the Church I should be a Positivist to - morrow . Your Theism is a mere arbitrary hypothesis , at the mercy of any rival philosophical theory . How , regarding our position as precarious , you should come to regard your own as stable , is to me incomprehensible ! '
231752	231766	231768	231768	Elsmere	333	' What I conceive to be the vital difference between Theism and Christianity , '
231772	231843	231768	231768	Elsmere	333	' is that as an explanation of things Theism can never be disproved . At the worst it must always remain in the position of an alternative hypothesis , which the hostile man of science can not destroy , though he is under no obligation to adopt it . Broadly speaking , it is not the facts which are in dispute , but the inference to be drawn from them . '
231909	232085	232091	232091	he	0	' Christianity is in a totally different position . Its grounds are not philosophical but literary and historical . It rests not upon all fact , but upon a special group of facts . It is , and will always remain , a great literary and historical problem , a question of documents and testimony . Hence , the Christian explanation is vulnerable in a way in which the Theistic explanation can never be vulnerable . The contention , at any rate , of persons in my position is : That to the man who has had the special training required , and in whom this training has not been neutralised by any overwhelming bias of temperament , it can be as clearly demonstrated that the miraculous Christian story rests on a tissue of mistake , as it can be demonstrated that the Isidorian Decretals were a forgery , or the correspondence of Paul and Seneca a pious fraud , or that the mediæval belief in witchcraft was the product of physical ignorance and superstition .

232104	232354	232091	232091	he	0	' you say you think my later letters have been far too aggressive and positive . I , too , am astonished at myself . I do not know my own mood , it is so clear , so sharp , so combative . Is it the spectacle of Italy , I wonder — of a country practically without religion — the spectacle in fact of Latin Europe as a whole , and the practical Atheism in which it is ingulfed ? My dear friend , the problem of the world at this moment is — how to find a religion?—some great conception which shall be once more capable , as the old were capable , of welding societies , and keeping man 's brutish elements in check . Surely Christianity of the traditional sort is failing everywhere — less obviously with us , and in Teutonic Europe generally , but egregiously , notoriously , in all the Catholic countries . We talk complacently of the decline of Buddhism . But what have we to say of the decline of Christianity ? And yet this last is infinitely more striking and more tragic , inasmuch as it affects a more important section of mankind . I , at any rate , am not one of those who would seek to minimise the results of this decline for human life , nor can I bring myself to believe that Positivism or " evolutional morality " will ever satisfy the race .

What if it be God Himself who is driving His painful lesson home to me , to you , to the world ? What does it mean , this gradual growth of what we call infidelity , of criticism and science on the one hand , this gradual death of the old traditions on the other ? Sin , you answer , the enmity of the human mind against God , the momentary triumph of Satan . And so you acquiesce , heavy - hearted , in God 's present defeat , looking for vengeance and requital hereafter . Well , I am not so ready to believe in man 's capacity to rebel against his Maker ! Where you see ruin and sin , I see the urgent process of Divine education , God 's steady ineluctable command " to put away childish things , " the pressure of His spirit on ours towards new ways of worship and new forms of love !

You are rooted deep in the past ; you have also a future of infinite expansiveness stretching before you . Among European nations at this moment you alone have freedom in the true sense , you alone have religion .

Let me bear my witness bravely , not spending life in speech , but not undervaluing speech — above all , not being ashamed or afraid of it , because other wise people may prefer a policy of silence . A man has but the one puny life , the one tiny spark of faith . Better be venturesome with both for God 's sake , than over - cautious , over - thrifty .

235128	235141	235077	235077	Vernon	698	' kind . He grew uncomfortable , begged Elsmere to beware of any '

235173	235222	235077	235077	Vernon	698	' In short , it became plain that two men so much alike , and yet so different , could not long co - operate . However , just as the fact was being brought home to Elsmere , a friendly chance intervened . Hugh Flaxman , the Leyburns '
235256	235392	235254	235255	the Leyburns	324	' , had led both men far on the way to a friendship . Of Hugh Flaxman himself more hereafter . At present all that need be recorded is that it was at Mr. Flaxman 's house , overlooking St. James 's Park , Robert first met a man who was to give him the opening for which he was looking . Mr. Flaxman was fond of breakfast parties à la Rogers , and on the first occasion when Robert could be induced to attend one of these functions , he saw opposite to him what he supposed to be a lad of twenty , a young slip of a fellow , whose sallies of fun and invincible good humour attracted him greatly . Sparkling brown eyes , full lips rich in humour and pugnacity , '

235409	235540	235541	235543	Mr. Murray Edwardes	700	' activity too , in spite of his short stature and dainty make , as Chaucer lends his squire — the type was so fresh and pleasing that Robert was more and more held by it , especially when he discovered to his bewilderment that the supposed stripling must be from his talk a man quite as old as himself , an official besides , filling what was clearly some important place in the world . He took his full share in the politics and literature started at the table , and presently , when conversation fell on the proposed municipality for London , said things to which the whole party listened . Robert 's curiosity was aroused , and after breakfast he questioned his host and was promptly introduced to '
235545	235545	235541	235543	Mr. Murray Edwardes	700	'
236554	236563	236564	236564	he	6023	' You can not work with the Church ! '

Robert gathered that in this soul , too , there had risen the same large intoxicating dream of a reorganised Christendom , a new wide - spreading shelter of faith for discouraged browbeaten man , as in his own . '
236746	236783	236743	236743	I	0	' he said briefly , after a pause , his own look kindling—'it is the opening I have been pining for . I will give you all I can , and bless you for the chance . '

Since his departure Robert had made the keeping up of his correspondence with the squire a binding obligation , and he was to - night chiefly anxious to go to Madame de Netteville 's that he might write an account of it to Murewell . Still the squire 's talk , and his own glimpse of her at Murewell , had made him curious to see more of the woman herself . The squire 's ways of describing her were always half approving , half sarcastic . Robert sometimes imagined that he himself had been at one time more under her spell than he cared to confess . If so , it must have been when she was still in Paris , the young English widow of a man of old French family , rich , fascinating , distinguished , and the centre of a small salon , admission to which was one of the social blue ribbons of Paris . Since the war of 1870 Madame de Netteville had fixed her headquarters in London , and it was to her house in Hans Place that the squire wrote to her about the Elsmeres . She owed Roger Wendover debts of various kinds , and she had an encouraging memory of the young clergyman on the terrace at Murewell . So she promptly left her cards , together with the intimation that she was at home always on Friday evenings . '

They received her in dead silence — they gave her not one single recall — and they only gave her a clap , that I can remember , at those two or three points in the play where clap they positively must or burst . They go to see her — but they loathe her — and they let her know it . '

239207	239247	239248	239248	he	3490	' it is only because they are tired of her . Her vagaries do n't amuse them any longer — they know them by heart . And — by George ! she has some pretty rivals too , now ! '

The men , understanding his reference to the avidity with which certain English aristocratic scandals had been lately seized upon by the French papers , laughed out — so did Lady Aubrey . Madame de Netteville contented herself with a smile . '
239368	239380	239363	239363	Renan	623	' said the editor from the other side of the room . '
239384	239419	239363	239363	Renan	623	' said Lady Aubrey , with meditative scorn , fanning herself lightly the while , her thin but extraordinarily graceful head and neck thrown out against the golden brocade of the cushion behind her . '

239547	239654	239656	239658	the young man	8405	' Robert looked at Catherine . She sat upright by the side of Lady Aubrey ; her face , of which the beauty to - night seemed lost in rigidity , pale and stiff . With a contraction of heart he plunged himself into the conversation . On his road home that evening he had found an important foreign telegram posted up at the small literary club to which he had belonged since Oxford days . He made a remark about it now to Count Wielandt ; and the diplomatist , turning rather unwillingly to face his questioner , recognised that the remark was a shrewd one .
239987	239994	239995	239996	Lady Aubrey	703	' Are you new to London ? '
240054	240062	240064	240064	Catherine	458	' We have been two months here , '

240099	240104	240105	240106	Lady Aubrey	703	' In Bedford Square . '
240123	240129	240131	240131	Catherine	458	' We are very central , '

240239	240253	240233	240233	she	458	' I wish we were n't , for my little girl 's sake . '
240254	240266	240219	240221	supercilious great ladies	6146	' Oh , you have a little girl ! How old ? '
240267	240271	240233	240233	she	458	' Sixteen months . '
240272	240316	240318	240319	Lady Aubrey	703	' Too young to be a nuisance yet . Mine are just old enough to be in everybody 's way . Children are out of place in London . I always want to leave mine in the country , but my husband objects , '

240635	240642	240644	240646	Madame de Netteville	655	' Agreeable — rather an acquisition ! '
240664	240703	240704	240705	Lady Aubrey	703	' But the wife ! Good heavens ! I owe Roger Wendover a grudge . I think he might have made it plain to those good people that I do n't want strange women at my Friday evenings . '
240708	240735	240704	240705	Lady Aubrey	703	' No doubt she is a genius , or a saint , in mufti . She might be handsome too if some one would dress her . '

240989	240994	240995	240995	he	359	' What is it ? '
241002	241009	241010	241010	she	655	' I seem all at sea , '
241051	241069	241070	241070	Darling	709	' She drew herself away from him , once more looking into the fire with drawn brows . '
241100	241114	241142	241143	those women	6170	' He spoke with a moved gentleness , taking her hand the while . '
241127	241139	241142	241143	those women	6170	' she said presently , with strong , almost stern emphasis . '
241151	241192	241142	241143	those women	6170	' He rose and looked down on her from the mantelpiece . Within him was a movement of impatience , repressed almost at once by the thought of that long night at Murewell , when he had vowed to himself to '
241195	241212	241142	241143	those women	6170	' ! And if that memory had not intervened she would still have disarmed him wholly . '
241215	241231	241142	241143	those women	6170	' she said to him suddenly , her eyes kindling with a strange childish pleasure . '
241283	241763	241779	241779	himself	6172	' A yearning passion breathed through every feature . It seemed to him she saw nothing before her . Her longing soul was back in the old haunts , surrounded by the old loved forms and sounds . It went to his heart . He tried to soothe her with the tenderest words remorseful love could find . But the conflict of feeling — grief , rebellion , doubt , self - judgment — would not be soothed , and long after she had made him leave her and he had fallen asleep , she knelt on , a white and rigid figure in the dying firelight , the wind shaking the old house , the eternal murmur of London booming outside . Meanwhile , as if to complete the circle of pain with which poor Catherine 's life was compassed , it began to be plain to her that , in spite of the hard and mocking tone Rose generally adopted with regard to him , Edward Langham was constantly at the house in Lerwick Gardens , and that it was impossible he should be there so much unless in some way or other Rose encouraged it . The idea of such a marriage — nay , of such a friendship — was naturally as repugnant as ever to her . It had been one of the bitterest moments of a bitter time when , at their first meeting after the crisis in her life , Langham , conscious of a sudden movement of pity for a woman he disliked , had pressed the hand she held out to him in a way which clearly showed her what was in his mind , and had then passed on to chat and smoke with Robert in the study , leaving her behind to realise the gulf that lay between the present and that visit of his to Murewell , when Robert and she had felt in unison towards him , his opinions , and his conduct to Rose , as towards everything else of importance in their life . Now it seemed to her Robert must necessarily look at the matter differently , and she could not make up her mind to talk to him about it . In reality , his objections had never had the same basis as hers , and he would have given her as strong a support as ever , if she had asked for it . But she held her peace , and he , absorbed in other things , took no notice . Besides , he knew Langham too well . He had never been able to take Catherine 's alarms seriously . An attentive onlooker , however , would have admitted that this time , at any rate , they had their justification . Why Langham was so much in the Leyburns '
242260	242356	242357	242357	You	6184	' item'—something systematically overlooked and forgotten in the bustle of her days and nights . He saw that she thought badly of him , that the friendship he might have had was now proudly refused him , that their first week together had left a deep impression of resentment and hostility in her mind . And all the same he came ; and she asked him ! And sometimes , after an hour when she had been more difficult or more satirical than usual , ending notwithstanding with a little change of tone , a careless '
242376	242470	242475	242475	his	6186	' Langham would walk home in a state of feeling he did not care to analyse , but which certainly quickened the pace of life a good deal . She would not let him try his luck at friendship again , but in the strangest slightest ways did she not make him suspect every now and then that he was in some sort important to her , that he sometimes preoccupied her against her will ; that her will , indeed , sometimes escaped her , and failed to control her manner to him ?
242540	242547	242549	242550	Mr. Flaxman	560	' Tell me about Mr. Langham , '
242567	242574	242549	242550	Mr. Flaxman	560	' is he an old friend ? '
242575	242580	242582	242582	Agnes	306	' Of Robert 's , '
242593	242608	242584	242584	her	306	' My sister met him once for a week in the country at the Elsmeres '
242622	242631	242613	242613	I	0	' Hugh Flaxman pondered the information a little . '
242645	242654	242633	242633	he	560	' His smile struck one out of her . '
242661	242666	242656	242656	Robert	359	' she said demurely . '
242829	242830	242831	242831	I	0	' '
242836	242876	242877	242877	he	560	' said Agnes , looking her questioner full in the face . Hugh Flaxman 's fair complexion flushed a little . He got up to go . He is one of the most extraordinarily handsome persons I ever saw , '
242886	242893	242877	242877	he	560	' Do n't you think so ? '
242894	242897	242899	242899	Agnes	306	' Yes , '
242902	242921	242899	242899	Agnes	306	' if he did n't stoop , and if he did n't in general look half - asleep . '
242947	243207	242922	242923	Hugh Flaxman	560	' house . Being himself a man of very subtle and fastidious tastes , he could imagine that so original a suitor , with such eyes , such an intellectual reputation so well sustained by scantiness of speech and the most picturesque capacity for silence , might have attractions for a romantic and wilful girl . But where were the signs of it ? Rose rarely talked to him , and was always ready to make him the target of a sub - acid raillery . Agnes was clearly indifferent to him , and Mrs. Leyburn equally clearly afraid of him . Mrs. Elsmere , too , seemed to dislike him , and yet there he was , week after week . Flaxman could not make it out . Then he tried to explore the man himself . He started various topics with him — University reform , politics , music . In vain . In his most characteristic Oxford days Langham had never assumed a more wholesale ignorance of all subjects in heaven and earth , and never stuck more pertinaciously to the flattest forms of commonplace . Flaxman walked away at last boiling over . The man of parts masquerading as the fool is perhaps at least as exasperating as the fool playing at wisdom . However , he was not the only person irritated . After one of these fragments of conversation Langham also walked rapidly home in a state of most irrational petulance , his hands thrust with energy into the pockets of his overcoat . '
243260	243661	243662	243663	Citizen Flaxman	693	' And he stiffened himself as he walked , feeling life electric all about him , and a strange new force tingling in every vein . Meanwhile , however , Mr. Flaxman was certainly having a good deal of his own way . Since the moment when his aunt , Lady Charlotte , had introduced him to Miss Leyburn — watching him the while with a half - smile which soon broadened into one of sly triumph — Hugh Flaxman had persuaded himself that country houses are intolerable even in the shooting season , and that London is the only place of residence during the winter for the man who aspires to govern his life on principles of reason . Through his influence and that of his aunt , Rose and Agnes — Mrs. Leyburn never went out — were being carried into all the high life that London can supply in November and January . Wealthy , high - born , and popular , he was gradually devoting his advantages in the freest way to Rose 's service . He was an excellent musical amateur , and he was always proud to play with her ; he had a fine country house , and the little rooms on Campden Hill were almost always filled with flowers from his gardens ; he had a famous musical library , and its treasures were lavished on the girl violinist ; he had a singularly wide circle of friends , and with his whimsical energy he was soon inclined to make kindness to the two sisters the one test of a friend 's goodwill . He was clearly touched by Rose ; and what was to prevent his making an impression on her ? To her sex he had always been singularly attractive . Like his sister , he had all sorts of bright impulses and audacities flashing and darting about him . He had a certain hauteur with men , and could play the aristocrat when he pleased , for all his philosophical radicalism . But with women he was the most delightful mixture of deference and high spirits . He loved the grace of them , the daintiness of their dress , the softness of their voices . He would have done anything to please them , anything to save them pain . At twenty - five , when he was still '
243664	243951	243662	243663	Citizen Flaxman	693	' to his college friends , and in the first fervours of a poetic defiance of prejudice and convention , he had married a gamekeeper 's pretty daughter . She had died with her child — died , almost , poor thing ! of happiness and excitement — of the over - greatness of Heaven 's boon to her . Flaxman had adored her , and death had tenderly embalmed a sentiment to which life might possibly have been less kind . Since then he had lived in music , letters , and society , refusing out of a certain fastidiousness to enter politics , but welcomed and considered , wherever he went , tall , good - looking , distinguished , one of the most agreeable and courted of men , and perhaps the richest parti in London . Still , in spite of it all , Langham held his ground — Langham would see it out ! And indeed Flaxman 's footing with the beauty was by no means clear — least of all to himself . She evidently liked him , but she bantered him a good deal ; she would not be the least subdued or dazzled by his birth and wealth , or by those of his friends ; and if she allowed him to provide her with pleasures , she would hardly ever take his advice , or knowingly consult his tastes . Meanwhile she tormented them both a good deal by the artistic acquaintance she gathered about her . Mrs. Pierson 's world , as we have said , contained a good many dubious odds and ends , and she had handed them all over to Rose . The Leyburns '
244596	244599	244601	244601	Rose	369	' Well ? '
244610	244617	244618	244618	he	464	' I have sent him away , '
244634	244668	244618	244618	he	464	' he was in no condition to sing . He chose to be offended , apparently , because he was put out of his turn , and has been giving the servants trouble . '
244689	244699	244700	244700	he	464	' I trust you will not ask him again , '
244708	244736	244700	244700	he	464	' And if I might say so there are one or two people still here whom I should like to see you exclude at the same time . '
244831	244835	244836	244836	she	369	' I know , '
244840	244856	244836	244836	she	369	' that you dislike artists . They are not your world . They are mine . '
244857	244902	244903	244903	He	464	' I dislike artists ? What nonsense , too ! To me personally these men 's ways do n't matter in the least . They go their road and I mine . But I deeply resent any danger of discomfort and annoyance to you ! '
244986	244991	244992	244992	she	6233	' I am afraid , '
245001	245021	245022	245022	she	6233	' you have been going through something very disagreeable . I am very sorry . Is it my fault ? '
245045	245056	245057	245057	he	464	' Yes , it is your fault , I think ! '
245067	245140	245057	245057	he	464	' Not that I was annoyed — Heavens ! what does that matter?—but that you and your mother and sister were very near an unpleasant scene . You will not take advice , Miss Leyburn,—you will take your own way in spite of what any one else can say or hint to you , and some day you will expose yourself to annoyance when there is no one near to protect you ! '
245141	245157	245158	245158	she	6233	' Well , if so , it wo n't be for want of a mentor , '
245231	245237	245213	245213	He	464	' Am I interrupting you ? '
245238	245243	245245	245245	Rose	369	' Not at all , '
245261	245284	245254	245254	she	6233	' Do n't say anything about the wretched man ; it would make mamma nervous . He sha n't come here again . '

245915	245915	245904	245904	they	6261	'

245931	245943	245920	245920	she	369	' Yes — I suppose I ought to be much flattered . '
245944	245948	245949	245949	he	464	' Of course , '
245957	245989	245949	245949	he	464	' To many people you must be at this moment one of the most enviable persons in the world . A delightful art — and every opportunity to make it tell ! '
246001	246013	246014	246014	she	369	' I do n't know whether it is a delightful art , '
246023	246052	246014	246014	she	369	' I believe I am getting very tired of London . Sometimes I think I should n't be very sorry to find myself suddenly spirited back to Burwood ! '
246077	246084	246085	246085	she	369	' Oh no , not yet ! '
246095	246109	246085	246085	she	369	' Madame Desforêts comes next week , and I am to see her . '
246142	246149	246150	246150	he	464	' You are to see her ? '
246154	246160	246150	246150	he	464	' Is she coming here ? '
246161	246225	246227	246227	he	464	' I hope so . Mrs. Pierson is to bring her . I want mamma to have the amusement of seeing her . My artistic friends are a kind of tonic to her — they excite her so much . She regards them as a sort of show — much as you do , in fact , only in a more charitable fashion . '
246237	246244	246245	246245	he	464	' Madame Desforêts is coming here ? '
246259	246262	246263	246263	she	6262	' Yes ! '
246276	246351	246263	246263	she	6262	' Oh , I remember when we were at Murewell , you were exercised that we should know her . Well , Mr. Langham , I told you then that you were only echoing unworthy gossip . I am in the same mind still . I have seen her , and you have n't . To me she is the greatest actress in the world , and an ill - used woman to boot ! '
246419	246424	246425	246425	he	6263	' It is strange , '
246429	246510	246425	246425	he	6263	' very strange — that you should have told me this at this moment ! Miss Leyburn , a great deal of the truth about Madame Desforêts I could neither tell , nor could you hear . There are charges against her proved in open court , again and again , which I could not even mention in your presence . But one thing I can speak of . Do you know the story of the sister at St. Petersburg ? '
246511	246520	246522	246522	Rose	369	' I know no stories against Madame Desforêts , '
246536	246546	246522	246522	Rose	369	' I have always chosen not to know them . '
246547	246570	246425	246425	he	6263	' The newspapers were full of this particular story just before Christmas . I should have thought it must have reached you . '
246571	246578	246579	246579	she	369	' I did not see it , '
246583	246606	246579	246579	she	369	' and I can not see what good purpose is to be served by your repeating it to me , Mr. Langham . '
246627	246638	246639	246639	he	6263	' You will let me tell it , I hope ? '
246643	246698	246639	246639	he	6263	' I will tell it so that it shall not offend your ears . As it happens , I myself thought it incredible at the time . But , by an odd coincidence , it has just this afternoon been repeated to me by a man who was an eyewitness of part of it . '
246717	246722	246723	246723	he	6263	' Three months ago , '
246744	246811	246723	246723	he	6263	' Madame Desforêts was acting in St. Petersburg . She had with her a large company , and amongst them her own young sister , Elise Romey , a girl of eighteen . This girl had been always kept away from Madame Desforêts by her parents , who had never been sufficiently consoled by their eldest daughter 's artistic success for the infamy of her life . '
246824	246982	246816	246816	Langham	464	' Elise Romey , however , had developed a passion for the stage . Her parents were respectable — and you know young girls in France are brought up strictly . She knew next to nothing of her sister 's escapades . But she knew that she was held to be the greatest actress in Europe — the photographs in the shops told her that she was beautiful . She conceived a romantic passion for the woman whom she had last seen when she was a child of five , and actuated partly by this hungry affection , partly by her own longing wish to become an actress , she escaped from home and joined Madame Desforêts in the South of France . Madame Desforêts seems at first to have been pleased to have her . The girl 's adoration pleased her vanity . Her presence with her gave her new opportunities of posing . I believe , '
246991	247235	246984	246984	Langham	464	' they were photographed together at Marseilles with their arms round each other 's necks , and the photograph had an immense success . However , on the way to St. Petersburg , difficulties arose . Elise was pretty , in a blonde childish way , and she caught the attention of the jeune premier of the company , a man'—the speaker became somewhat embarrassed—'whom Madame Desforêts seems to have regarded as her particular property . There were scenes at different towns on the journey . Elise became frightened — wanted to go home . But the elder sister , having begun tormenting her , seems to have determined to keep her hold on her , as a cat keeps and tortures a mouse — mainly for the sake of annoying the man of whom she was jealous . They arrived at St. Petersburg in the depth of winter . The girl was worn out with travelling , unhappy , and ill . One night in Madame Desforêts 's apartment there was a supper party , and after it a horrible quarrel . No one exactly knows what happened . But towards twelve o'clock that night Madame Desforêts turned her young sister in evening dress , a light shawl round her , out into the snowy streets of St. Petersburg , barred the door behind her , and revolver in hand dared the wretched man who had caused the fracas to follow her . '
247269	247274	247275	247275	he	464	' The poor child , '
247287	247349	247275	247275	he	464	' wandered about for some hours . It was a frightful night — the great capital was quite strange to her . She was insulted — fled this way and that — grew benumbed with cold and terror , and was found unconscious in the early morning under the archway of a house some two miles from her sister 's lodgings . '
247364	247371	247372	247372	she	369	' I do not believe it ! '
247376	247383	247372	247372	she	369	' I can not believe it ! '
247384	247393	247395	247395	Langham	464	' It was amply proved at the time , '
247398	247543	247395	247395	Langham	464	' though of course Madame Desforêts tried to put her own colour on it . But I told you I had private information . On one of the floors of the house where Elise Romey was picked up , lived a young university professor . He is editing an important Greek text , and has lately had business at the Museum . I made friends with him there . He walked home with me this afternoon , saw the announcement of Madame Desforêts 's coming , and poured out the story . He and his wife nursed the unfortunate girl with devotion . She lived just a week , and died of inflammation of the lungs . I never in my life heard anything so pitiful as his description of her delirium , her terror , her appeals , her shivering misery of cold . '
247549	247556	247557	247557	he	6265	' She is not a woman , '
247565	247572	247557	247557	he	6265	' She is a wild beast . '
247601	247610	247611	247611	he	6265	' I have told you a shocking story , '
247615	247690	247611	247611	he	6265	' Perhaps I ought not to have done it . But , as you sat there talking so lightly , so gaily , it suddenly became to me utterly intolerable that that woman should ever sit here in this room — talk to you — call you by your name — laugh with you — touch your hand ! Not even your wilfulness shall carry you so far — you shall not do it ! '
247818	247826	247827	247827	she	6266	' I will never see her again , '
247925	247930	247931	247931	her	6266	' Be always thus ! '
247973	247983	247965	247965	He	6265	' To - night — at Lady Charlotte 's ? '
247984	247989	247990	247990	she	6266	' To - night , '
248024	248034	248036	248037	Mr. Flaxman	560	' In the first place , my dear aunt , '
248056	248091	248092	248092	He	560	' you may spare your admonitions , because it is becoming more and more clear to me that , whatever my sentiments may be , Miss Leyburn never gives a serious thought to me . '
248119	248124	248126	248127	the lady	8775	' Stuff and nonsense ! '
248133	248177	248126	248127	the lady	8775	' I never flatter you , Hugh , and I do n't mean to begin now , but it would be mere folly not to recognise that you have advantages which must tell on the mind of any girl in Miss Leyburns position . '
248210	248221	248222	248222	he	560	' I am sorry for your theory , Aunt Charlotte , '
248228	248240	248222	248222	he	560	' but Miss Leyburn does n't care twopence about my advantages . '
248241	248250	248252	248253	Lady Charlotte	556	' Very proper of you to say so , '
248256	248276	248252	248253	Lady Charlotte	556	' the remark , however , my good sir , does more credit to your heart than your head . '
248277	248283	248284	248284	he	560	' In the next place , '
248289	248326	248327	248327	He	560	' why you should have done your best this whole winter to throw Miss Leyburn and me together , if you meant in the end to oppose my marrying her , I do n't quite see . '
248339	248345	248346	248346	she	556	' You know my weaknesses , '
248358	248425	248346	248346	she	556	' She is my latest novelty , she excites me , I ca n't do without her . As to you , I ca n't remember that you wanted much encouragement , but , I acknowledge , after all these years of resistance — resistance to my most legitimate efforts to dispose of you — there was a certain piquancy in seeing you caught at last ! '
248426	248431	248432	248432	he	12322	' Upon my word ! '
248610	248614	248616	248617	Mr. Flaxman	560	' And now , '
248619	248656	248616	248617	Mr. Flaxman	560	' having confessed in so many words that you have done your best to bring me up to the fence , will you kindly recapitulate the arguments why in your opinion I should not jump it ? '
248657	248668	248669	248669	she	556	' Society , amusement , flirtation , are one thing , '
248675	248696	248669	248669	she	556	' marriage is another . In these democratic days we must know everybody ; we should only marry our equals . '
248720	248728	248729	248729	he	560	' I do not agree with you , '
248733	248755	248729	248729	he	560	' and you know I do not . You could not , I imagine , have relied much upon that argument . '
248756	248762	248764	248765	Lady Charlotte	556	' Good gracious , Hugh ! '
248768	248878	248764	248765	Lady Charlotte	556	' you talk as if I were really the old campaigner some people suppose me to be . I have been amusing myself — I have liked to see you amused . And it is only the last few weeks since you have begun to devote yourself so tremendously , that I have come to take the thing seriously at all . I confess , if you like , that I have got you into the scrape — now I want to get you out of it ! I am not thin - skinned , but I hate family unpleasantnesses — and you know what the duke will say . '
248879	248886	248888	248888	Flaxman	560	' The duke be — translated ! '
248891	248954	248955	248955	He	560	' Nothing of what you have said or could say on this point , my dear aunt , has the smallest weight with me . But Providence has been kinder to you and the duke than you deserve . Miss Leyburn does not care for me , and she does care — or I am very much mistaken — for somebody else . '
248967	248979	248955	248955	He	560	' What , that Oxford nonentity , Mr. Langham , the Elsmeres '
248999	249000	249001	249001	I	0	' '
249013	249018	249001	249001	I	0	' replied her nephew . '
249055	249065	249067	249068	Lady Charlotte	556	' Another instance of what university reputation is worth ! '
249147	249154	249155	249155	he	560	' I should like to know , '
249166	249182	249155	249155	he	560	' I should greatly like to know why you asked him here to - night ? '
249183	249217	249218	249218	Flaxman	560	' You know perfectly well that I should ask anybody — a convict , a crossing - sweeper — if I happened to be half an hour in the same room with him ! '
249221	249232	249233	249233	he	560	' Well , it may be convenient to - night , '
249237	249249	249233	249233	he	560	' What are we to do — some thought - reading ? '
249250	249276	249277	249277	She	6285	' Yes . It is n't a crush . I have only asked about thirty or forty people . Mr. Denman is to manage it . '
249316	249325	249326	249326	he	560	' I want to make a few notes , '
249335	249344	249326	249326	he	560	' I should be glad to satisfy myself . '
249695	249702	249703	249703	he	560	' You failed us at rehearsal , '
249709	249718	249703	249703	he	560	' we were all at sixes and sevens . '
249719	249756	249779	249780	Lady Charlotte	556	' I had a sick mother , unfortunately , who kept me at home . Lady Charlotte , Catherine could n't come . Agnes and I are alone in the world . Will you chaperon us ? '
249757	249777	249779	249780	Lady Charlotte	556	' I do n't know whether I will accept the responsibility to - night — in that new gown , '
249815	249820	249821	249821	she	369	' On the contrary , '
249824	249838	249821	249821	she	369	' one always feels so particularly good and prim in a new frock . '
249839	249854	249856	249856	Flaxman	560	' Really ? I should have thought it one of Satan 's likeliest moments , '
249908	249917	249918	249918	she	369	' I have made a muddle as usual , '
249925	249935	249918	249918	she	369	' perhaps even a worse one than I thought ! '
250233	250257	250258	250258	Agnes	306	' Mr. Langham ! But Rose never told me he was to be here to - night , and how dreadful he looks ! '
250437	250452	250453	250453	he	717	' Have you seen any experiments in the working of this new force before ? '
250469	250473	250474	250474	she	369	' Oh yes ! '
250478	250491	250474	250474	she	369	' We have tried it sometimes . It is very good fun . '
250497	250501	250502	250502	he	717	' Not fun , '
250506	250543	250502	250502	he	717	' not fun . Thought - reading wants seriousness ; the most tremendous things depend upon it . If established it will revolutionise our whole views of life . Even a Huxley could not deny that ! '
250551	250564	250544	250544	She	369	' Do you imagine this party to - night looks very serious ? '
250569	250580	250581	250581	he	717	' One can seldom get people to take it scientifically , '
250656	250662	250664	250664	Flaxman	560	' Come , Mr. Denman , '
250671	250687	250689	250689	he	560	' the audience is about collected , I think . Ah , there you are ! '
250696	250710	250689	250689	he	560	' Have you seen anything yet of these fashionable dealings with the devil ? '
250711	250719	250720	250720	Flaxman	560	' Nothing . Are you a believer ? '
250725	250735	250736	250736	he	560	' I never refuse an experiment of any kind , '
250745	250750	250736	250736	he	560	' Come , Denman . '
251159	251168	251170	251170	Rose	369	' Are you convinced ? Do you believe ? '
251179	251211	251170	251170	Rose	369	' In telepathy ? Well — so far — I have not got beyond the delicacy and perfection of Mr. Denman's — muscular sensation . So much I am sure of ! '
251212	251221	251222	251222	she	369	' Oh , but your scepticism is ridiculous ! '
251226	251239	251222	251222	she	369	' We know that some people have an extraordinary power over others . '
251240	251248	251249	251249	he	560	' Yes , that certainly we know ! '
251263	251269	251252	251252	his	560	' I grant you that . '
251288	251291	251293	251294	Mr. Denman	717	' Now , '
251307	251377	251293	251294	Mr. Denman	717	' I have done all I can — I am exhausted . But let me beg of you all to go on with some experiments amongst yourselves . Every fresh discovery of this power in a new individual is a gain to science . I believe about one in ten has some share of it . Mr. Flaxman and I will arrange everything , if any one will volunteer ? '
251419	251429	251406	251406	she	6357	' Somebody must venture — we are losing time . '
251456	251477	251478	251479	The girl	930	' Miss Leyburn — you are always public - spirited — will you be victimised for the good of science ? '
251486	251519	251520	251520	Flaxman	560	' And Mr. Langham — will you see what you can do with Miss Leyburn ? Hugh — we all choose her task , do n't we — then Mr. Langham wills ? '
251575	251579	251580	251580	he	560	' Command me ! '
251597	251611	251580	251580	he	560	' I am afraid Miss Leyburn will find me a very bad partner . '
251612	251618	251620	251620	Flaxman	560	' Well , now then ! '
251622	251643	251620	251620	Flaxman	560	' Miss Leyburn , will you please go down into the library while we settle what you are to do ! '
251675	251686	251688	251689	Lady Charlotte	556	' Now , then , what shall Miss Leyburn do ? '
251697	251713	251715	251716	Mr. Flaxman	560	' If I might suggest something quite different from anything that has been yet tried , '
251718	251750	251715	251716	Mr. Flaxman	560	' suppose we re quire Miss Leyburn to kiss the hand of the little marble statue of Hope in the far drawing - room . What do you say , Langham ? '
251751	251756	251758	251758	Langham	464	' What you please ! '
251792	251800	251774	251774	Langham	464	' Now then , said Flaxman coolly , '
251838	252247	251834	251834	I	0	' Langham abruptly assented . He had a passionate sense of being watched — tricked . Why were he and she to be made a spectacle for this man and his friends ! A mad irrational indignation surged through him . Then she was led in blindfolded , one hand stretched out feeling the air in front of her . The circle of people drew back . Mr. Flaxman and Mr. Denman prepared , note - book in hand , to watch the experiment . Langham moved desperately forward . But the instant her soft trembling hand touched his , as though by enchantment , the surrounding scene , the faces , the lights , were blotted out from him . He forgot his anger , he forgot everything but her and this thing she was to do . He had her in his grasp — he was the man , the master — and what enchanting readiness to yield in the swaying pliant form ! In the distance far away gleamed the statue of Hope , a child on tiptoe , one outstretched arm just visible from where he stood . There was a moment 's silent expectation . Every eye was riveted on the two figures — on the dark handsome man — on the blindfolded girl . At last Rose began to move gently forward . It was a strange wavering motion . The breath came quickly through her slightly parted lips ; her bright colour was ebbing . She was conscious of nothing but the grasp in which her hand was held — otherwise her mind seemed a blank . Her state during the next few seconds was not unlike the state of some one under the partial influence of an anæsthetic ; a benumbing grip was laid on all her faculties ; and she knew nothing of how she moved or where she was going . Suddenly the trance cleared away . It might have lasted half an hour or five seconds , for all she knew . But she was standing beside a small marble statue in the farthest drawing - room , and her lips had on them a slight sense of chill , as though they had just been laid to something cold . She pulled off the handkerchief from her eyes . Above her was Langham 's face , a marvellous glow and animation in every line of it . '
252253	252275	251834	251834	I	0	' she asked in a tremulous whisper . For the moment her self - control was gone . She was still bewildered .
252281	252287	252288	252288	she	6364	' I am so glad , '
252380	252388	252390	252391	Mr. Flaxman	560	' She has done it ! Hurrah ! '
252393	252410	252390	252391	Mr. Flaxman	560	' What a rush that last was , Miss Leyburn ! You left us all behind . '
252516	252523	252525	252526	Lady Helen	483	' Did she do it exactly ? '
252529	252532	252533	252533	he	560	' Exactly , '
252554	252563	252565	252565	Rose	369	' Lady Charlotte , where is my sister ? '
252688	252693	252695	252695	Rose	369	' I must go , '
252704	252719	252695	252695	Rose	369	' How tiring this is ! How long did it take , Mr. Flaxman ? '
252720	252725	252726	252726	he	6376	' Exactly three minutes , '
252743	252754	252726	252726	he	6376	' So little ! Good - night , Lady Charlotte ! '
252778	252790	252792	252793	Lady Charlotte	556	' Hugh , of course you are going down with her ? '
252798	252812	252792	252793	Lady Charlotte	556	' You must . I promised to see her safely off the premises . '
252834	252840	252841	252841	he	6376	' Do n't spoil sport , '
252923	252928	252931	252931	she	483	' Oh , Hugh ! '
252942	252948	252949	252949	he	6376	' Never mind , Nellie , '
252961	253002	252949	252949	he	6376	' I will tell you all about it to - morrow . I have not been behaving well , and am not particularly pleased with myself . But for her it is all right . Poor , pretty little thing ! '
253066	253076	253055	253055	her	369	' Miss Leyburn , how are you going home ? '
253077	253087	253055	253055	her	369	' Will you ask for a hansom , please ? '
253088	253093	253094	253094	he	464	' Take my arm , '
253142	253150	253139	253139	them	6389	' Shall we walk a few steps ? '
253183	253195	253196	253196	he	464	' We shall find a cab at once in Park Lane , '
253199	253204	253196	253196	he	464	' Are you warm ? '
253205	253208	253214	253214	her	369	' Perfectly . '
253462	253468	253499	253499	He	6402	' Oh , stay there ! '
253477	253490	253499	253499	He	6402	' Rest there — pale tired child — pale tired little child ! '
253531	253538	253539	253539	she	369	' Are you sure at last ? '
253558	253561	253562	253562	he	6402	' Sure ! '
253569	253613	253614	253614	She	369	' What can I be sure of ? I am sure that I am not worth your loving , sure that I am poor , insignificant , obscure , that if you give yourself to me you will be miserably throwing yourself away ! '
253656	253661	253662	253662	he	6402	' Do you know , '
253682	253683	253662	253662	he	6402	' '
253687	253714	253684	253684	I	0	' she answered , her face turned shyly away from him , her words coming from under the fur hood which had fallen forward a little . '
253734	253735	253684	253684	I	0	' '
253740	253752	253684	253684	I	0	' he said , and his voice was full of pain . '
253901	253914	253915	253915	You	369	' he broke out , almost putting her hand away from him . '
253964	253990	254003	254003	you	0	' Rose raised her head . A passing light shone upon her . She was trembling and pale again , but her eyes were unchanged . '
253995	254000	254003	254003	you	0	' she said wistfully ; '
254007	254101	254102	254102	You	0	' He hung above her , an agony of feeling in the fine rigid face , of which the beautiful features and surfaces were already worn and blanched by the life of thought . What possessed him was not so much distrust of circumstance as doubt , hideous doubt , of himself , of this very passion beating within him . She saw nothing , meanwhile , but the self - depreciation which she knew so well in him , and against which her love in its rash ignorance and generosity cried out . '

Mere contact with her , the mere necessities of the situation , will drive me back to life , teach me how to live normally , like other men . I have not forced her love — it has been a free gift . Who can blame me if I take it , if I cling to it , as the man freezing in a crevasse clutches the rope thrown to him ? '

Replace them by two others — habit and character . Slave as you are of habit , of the character you have woven for yourself out of years of deliberate living — what wild unreason to imagine that love can unmake , can recreate ! What you are , you are to all eternity . Bear your own burden , but for God 's sake beguile no other human creature into trusting you with theirs ! '
255028	255088	254920	254923	the pale spectre self	6429	' But she loves me ! Impossible that I should crush and tear so kind , so warm a heart ! Poor child — poor child ! I have played on her pity . I have won all she had to give . And now to throw her gift back in her face — oh monstrous — oh inhuman ! '

But at least do not add another crime to the first . What in God 's name have you to offer a creature of such claims , such ambitions ? You are poor — you must go back to Oxford — you must take up the work your soul loathes — grow more soured , more embittered — maintain a useless degrading struggle , till her youth is done , her beauty wasted , and till you yourself have lost every shred of decency and dignity , even that decorous outward life in which you can still wrap yourself from the world ! Think of the little house — the children — the money difficulties — she , spiritually starved , every illusion gone,—you incapable soon of love , incapable even of pity , conscious only of a dull rage with her , yourself , the world ! Bow the neck — submit — refuse that long agony for yourself and her , while there is still time . Kismet — Kismet ! '

I had gone up to ask after them all , and came on to you,—of course on my own responsibility entirely ! Rose knows nothing of my coming — nothing of what I have to say . '
258723	258731	258733	258733	Langham	464	' You can have nothing to say ! '
258751	258756	258733	258733	Langham	464	' You know me . '
258807	258810	258812	258812	Robert	359	' No ! '
258815	258864	258812	258812	Robert	359	' I do not know you in the sense you mean . I do not know you as the man who could beguile a girl on to a confession of love , and then tell her that for you marriage was too great a burden to be faced ! '
258895	258907	258908	258908	he	464	' I did not come simply to reproach you , Langham , '
258912	259182	258908	258908	he	464	' though I confess to being very hot ! I came to try and find out — for myself only , mind — whether what prevents you from following up what I understand happened last night is really a matter of feeling , or a matter of outward circumstance . If , upon reflection , you find that your feeling for Rose is not what you imagined it to be , I shall have my own opinion about your conduct — but I shall be the first to acquiesce in what you have done this morning . If , on the other hand , you are simply afraid of yourself in harness , and afraid of the responsibilities of practical married life , I can not help begging you to talk the matter over with me , and let us face it together . Whether Rose would ever , under any circumstances , get over the shock of this morning I have not the remotest idea . But'—and he hesitated—'it seems the feeling you appealed to yesterday has been of long growth . You know perfectly well what havoc a thing of this kind may make in a girl 's life . I do n't say it will . But , at any rate , it is all so desperately serious I could not hold my hand . I am doing what is no doubt wholly unconventional ; but I am your friend and her brother ; I brought you together , and I ask you to take me into counsel . If you had but done it before ! '
259191	259199	259201	259201	Langham	464	' You can not pretend to believe , '
259213	259231	259201	259201	Langham	464	' that a marriage with me would be for your sister - in - law 's happiness ? '
259232	259241	259243	259243	Robert	359	' I do n't know what to believe ! '
259245	259248	259249	259249	he	359	' No , '
259253	259322	259249	259249	he	359	' no ; when I saw you first attracted by Rose at Murewell I disliked the idea heartily ; I was glad to see you separated ; à priori , I never thought you suited to each other . But reasoning that holds good when a thing is wholly in the air looks very different when a man has committed himself and another , as you have done . '
259348	259456	259457	259457	he	6508	' Elsmere , there is nothing to be said ! I have behaved as vilely as you please . I have forfeited your friendship . But I should be an even greater fiend and weakling than you think me if , in cold blood , I could let your sister run the risk of marrying me . I could not trust myself — you may think of the statement as you like — I should make her miserable . Last night I had not parted from her an hour before I was utterly and irrevocably sure of it . My habits are my masters . I believe , '
259470	259484	259457	259457	he	6508	' I could even grow to hate what came between me and them ! '
259505	259509	259510	259510	he	359	' Pray heaven , '
259521	259531	259510	259510	he	359	' you may not have made her miserable already ! '
259532	259540	259542	259542	Langham	464	' Did it hurt her so much ? '
259566	259573	259575	259575	Robert	359	' I have not seen her , '
259578	259600	259575	259575	Robert	359	' but when I came in I found my wife — who has no light tears — weeping for her sister . '
259635	259640	259642	259642	Robert	359	' Good - bye ! '
259662	259747	259748	259748	He	359	' As I said to you before , what Rose 's feeling is at this moment I can not even guess . Very likely she would be the first to repudiate half of what I have been saying . And I see that you will not talk to me — you will not take me into your confidence and speak to me not only as her brother but as your friend . And — and — are you going ? What does this mean ? '
259758	259766	259768	259769	the other	1544	' I am going back to Oxford , '
259772	259785	259768	259769	the other	1544	' I can not stay in these rooms , in these streets . '
259841	259847	259848	259848	he	359	' It is very hard , '
259855	259904	259848	259848	he	359	' that our old friendship should be crossed like this . Do trust me a little ! You are always undervaluing yourself . Why not take a friend into council sometimes when you sit in judgment on yourself and your possibilities ? Your own perceptions are all warped ! '
259931	259940	259941	259941	he	359	' I will write to you , Elsmere , '
259949	259966	259941	259941	he	359	' speech is impossible to me . I never had any words except through my pen . '
260398	260401	260402	260402	she	369	' You ! '
260469	260472	260473	260473	she	369	' What ? '
260480	260504	260473	260473	she	369	' You think to - night is last night ! You and I have nothing to say to each other , Mr. Langham . '

260520	260530	260517	260517	his	464	' I have committed a crime — a villainy . '
260531	260540	260541	260541	she	369	' And it is not pleasant to you ? '
260546	260651	260652	260652	She	369	' I am sorry — I can not help you . But you are wrong — it was no crime — it was necessary and profitable , like the doses of one 's childhood ! Oh ! I might have guessed you would do this ; No , Mr. Langham , I am in no danger of an interesting decline . I have just played my concerto very fairly . I shall not disgrace myself at the concert to - morrow night . You may be at peace — I have learnt several things to - day that have been salutary — very salutary . '
260667	260674	260675	260675	she	369	' Do n't come any farther , '
260687	260756	260675	260675	she	369	' Let us be quits ! I was a temptingly easy prey . I bear no malice . And do not let me break your friendship with Robert ; that began before this foolish business — it should outlast it . Very likely we shall be friends again , like ordinary people , some day . I do not imagine your wound is very deep , and — — '
260839	260845	260846	260846	he	464	' You do not understand , '
260869	260878	260846	260846	he	464	' Thank heaven , you never will understand . '
260879	260885	260886	260886	she	369	' I think I do , '
260928	261088	260886	260886	she	369	' If things had been different — if one could change the self — if the past were nobler!'—was that the cry of them ? A painful humility — a boundless pity — the rise of some moral wave within her he could neither measure nor explain — these were some of the impressions which passed from her to him . A fresh gulf opened between them , and he saw her transformed on the farther side , with , as it were , a loftier gesture , a nobler stature , than had ever yet been hers . He bent forward quickly , caught her hands , held them for an instant to his lips in a convulsive grasp , dropped them , and was gone . He gained his own room again . There lay the medley of his books , his only friends , his real passion . Why had he ever tampered with any other ? '
261097	261116	261117	261117	Her	6522	' he said to himself , with an accent of infinite relief as he sank into his chair . '
261122	261122	261117	261117	Her	6522	'
261360	261489	261336	261336	he	359	' As far as we two are concerned , let us forget it all . I could hardly say this , you will easily imagine , if I thought that you had done serious or irreparable harm . But both my wife and I agree now in thinking that by a pure accident , as it were , and to her own surprise , Rose has escaped either . It will be some time , no doubt , before she will admit it . A girl is not so easily disloyal to her past . But to us it is tolerably clear . At any rate , I send you our opinion for what it is worth , believing that it will and must be welcome to you . '
261678	261740	261665	261665	she	369	' Do you know , Cathie , how I always see myself nowadays ? It is a sort of hallucination . I see a girl at the foot of a precipice . She has had a fall , and she is sitting up , feeling all her limbs . And , to her great astonishment , there is no bone broken ! '
262213	262304	262195	262195	He	464	' As compared to last night , she looks this afternoon as if she had had an illness ! What on earth has that philandering ass been about ? If he did not propose to her last night , he ought to be shot — and if he did , à fortiori , for clearly she is miserable . But what a brave child ! How she played her part ! I wonder whether she thinks that I saw nothing , like all the rest ! Poor little cold hand ! '
262371	262602	262369	262370	the Varleys	720	' , now at the house of some other connection of his — for the concert was the work of his friends , and given in the town house of his decrepit great - uncle , Lord Daniel — he had many opportunities of observing Rose . And he felt a soft indefinable change in her which kept him in a perpetual answering vibration of sympathy and curiosity . She seemed to him for the moment to have lost her passionate relish for living , that relish which had always been so marked with her . Her bubble of social pleasure was pricked . She did everything she had to do , and did it admirably . But all through she was to his fancy absent and distraite , pursuing through the tumult of which she was often the central figure some inner meditations of which neither he nor any one else knew anything . Some eclipse had passed over the girl 's light self - satisfied temper ; some searching thrill of experience had gone through the whole nature . She had suffered , and she was quietly fighting down her suffering without a word to anybody . Flaxman 's guesses as to what had happened came often very near the truth , and the mixture of indignation and relief with which he received his own conjectures amused himself . '
262606	262617	262369	262370	the Varleys	720	' he said to himself once with a long breath , '
262644	262662	262369	262370	the Varleys	720	' Then his very next impulse , perhaps , would be an impulse of gratitude towards this same '
262665	263026	262369	262370	the Varleys	720	' towards the man who had released a prize he had had the tardy sense to see was not meant for him . Free again — to be loved , to be won ! There was the fact of facts after all . His own future policy , however , gave him much anxious thought . Clearly at present the one thing to be done was to keep his own ambitions carefully out of sight . He had the skill to see that she was in a state of reaction , of moral and mental fatigue . What she mutely seemed to ask of her friends was not to be made to feel . He took his cue accordingly . He talked to his sister . He kept Lady Charlotte in order . After all her eager expectation on Hugh 's behalf , Lady Helen had been dumfoundered by the sudden emergence of Langham at Lady Charlotte 's party for their common discomfiture . Who was the man?—why , what did it all mean ? Hugh had the most provoking way of giving you half his confidence . To tell you he was seriously in love , and to omit to add the trifling item that the girl in question was probably on the point of engaging herself to somebody else ! Lady Helen made believe to be angry , and it was not till she had reduced Hugh to a whimsical penitence and a full confession of all he knew or suspected , that she consented , with as much loftiness as the physique of an elf allowed her , to be his good friend again , and to play those cards for him which at the moment he could not play for himself . So in the cheeriest daintiest way Rose was made much of by both brother and sister . Lady Helen chatted of gowns and music and people , whisked Rose and Agnes off to this party and that , brought fruit and flowers to Mrs. Leyburn , made pretty deferential love to Catherine , and generally , to Mrs. Pierson 's disgust , became the girls '
263132	263134	263113	263113	Helen	483	' humphs '
263355	263674	263344	263344	she	358	' life . As much tenderness , between husband and wife as ever — perhaps more expression of it even than before , as though from an instinctive craving to hide the separateness below from each other and from the world . But Robert went his way , Catherine hers . Their spheres of work lay far apart ; their interests were diverging fast ; and though Robert at any rate was perpetually resisting , all sorts of fresh invading silences were always coming in to limit talk , and increase the number of sore points which each avoided . Robert was hard at work in the East End under Murray Edwardes 's auspices . He was already known to certain circles as a seceder from the Church who was likely to become both powerful and popular . Two articles of his in the Nineteenth Century , on disputed points of Biblical criticism , had distinctly made their mark , and several of the veterans of philosophical debate had already taken friendly and flattering notice of the new writer . Meanwhile Catherine was teaching in Mr. Clarendon 's Sunday school , and attending his prayer - meetings . The more expansive Robert 's energies became , the more she suffered , and the more the small daily opportunities for friction multiplied . Soon she could hardly bear to hear him talk about his work , and she never opened the number of the Nineteenth Century which contained his papers . Nor had he the heart to ask her to read them . Murray Edwardes had received Elsmere , on his first appearance in R — — , with a cordiality and a helpfulness of the most self - effacing kind . Robert had begun with assuring his new friend that he saw no chance , at any rate for the present , of his formally joining the Unitarians . '

263765	263822	263823	263823	You	6563	' Edwardes laughed the notion to scorn . The parish , as a whole , contained 20,000 persons . The existing churches , which , with the exception of St. Wilfrid 's , were miserably attended , provided accommodation at the outside for 3000 . His own chapel held 400 , and was about half full . '
263832	263862	263825	263825	I	0	' he said , his pleasant friendliness darkened for a moment by the look of melancholy which London work seems to develop even in the most buoyant of men , '
263889	264045	264046	264046	I	0	' And he forthwith carried off his visitor to the point from which , as it seemed to him , Elsmere 's work might start , viz . a lecture - room half a mile from his own chapel , where two helpers of his had just established an independent venture . Murray Edwardes had at the time an interesting and miscellaneous staff of lay - curates . He asked no questions as to religious opinions , but in general the men who volunteered under him — civil servants , a young doctor , a briefless barrister or two — were men who had drifted from received beliefs , and found a pleasure and freedom in working for and with him they could hardly have found elsewhere . The two who had planted their outpost in what seemed to them a particularly promising corner of the district were men of whom Edwardes knew personally little . '
264057	264063	264046	264046	I	0	' he explained to Elsmere , '
264099	264251	264090	264090	I	0	' After a tramp through the muddy winter streets , they came upon a new block of warehouses , in the lower windows of which some bills announced a night - school for boys and men . Here , to judge from the commotion round the doors , a lively scene was going on . Outside , a gang of young roughs were hammering at the doors , and shrieking witticisms through the keyhole . Inside , as soon as Murray Edwardes and Elsmere , by dint of good humour and strong shoulders , had succeeded in shoving their way through and shutting the door behind them , they found a still more animated performance in progress . The schoolroom was in almost total darkness ; the pupils , some twenty in number , were racing about , like so many shadowy demons , pelting each other and their teachers with the '
264253	264366	264465	264465	my	0	' which , as the buildings were new , and not yet fitted for gas , had been provided to light them through their three R 's . In the middle stood the two philanthropists they were in search of , freely bedaubed with tallow , one employed in boxing a boy 's ears , the other in saving a huge inkbottle whereon some enterprising spirit had just laid hands by way of varying the rebel ammunition . Murray Edwardes , who was in his element , went to the rescue at once , helped by Robert . The boy - minister , as he looked , had been , in fact , '
264368	264460	264461	264461	My	0	' of the Cambridge eight , and possessed muscles which men twice his size might have envied . In three minutes he had put a couple of ringleaders into the street by the scruff of the neck , relit a lamp which had been turned out , and got the rest of the rioters in hand . Elsmere backed him ably , and in a very short time they had cleared the premises . Then the four looked at each other , and Edwardes went off into a shout of laughter . '
264526	264574	264495	264496	Mr. Elsmere	313	' The short red - haired man addressed shook hands with Elsmere , scrutinising him from under bushy eyebrows . He was panting and beplastered with tallow , but the inner man was evidently quite unruffled , and Elsmere liked the shrewd Scotch face and gray eyes . '
264586	264591	264665	264665	they	6574	' he remarked drily , '
264610	264659	264600	264601	Mr. Elsmere	313	' Then he turned to a tall affected - looking youth with a large nose and long fair hair , who stood gasping with his hands upon his sides , his eyes , full of a moody wrath , fixed on the wreck and disarray of the schoolroom . '
264722	264868	264872	264872	I	0	' The four men sat on chatting some time , and then Wardlaw and Elsmere walked home together . It had been all arranged . Mackay , a curious morbid fellow , who had thrown himself into Unitarianism and charity mainly out of opposition to an orthodox and bourgeois family , and who had a great idea of his own social powers , was somewhat grudging and ungracious through it all . But Elsmere 's proposals were much too good to be refused . He offered to bring to the undertaking his time , his clergyman 's experience , and as much money as might be wanted . Wardlaw listened to him cautiously for an hour , took stock of the whole man physically and morally , and finally said , as he very quietly and deliberately knocked the ashes out of his pipe , — '
264873	264894	264872	264872	I	0	'm your man , Mr. Elsmere . If Mackay agrees , I vote we make you captain of this venture . '
264895	264901	264903	264903	Elsmere	313	' Nothing of the sort , '
264905	264922	264903	264903	Elsmere	313	' In London I am a novice ; I come to learn , not to lead . '
265767	266061	265761	265761	Robert	359	' work in the place , set up a popular historical lecture once a fortnight , announcing the fact by a blue and white poster in the schoolroom windows , it was the potters who provided him with his first hearers . The rest of the parish was divided between a population of dock labourers , settled there to supply the needs of the great dock which ran up into the south - eastern corner of it , two or three huge breweries , and a colony of watchmakers , an offshoot of Clerkenwell , who lived together in two or three streets , and showed the same peculiarities of race and specialised training to be noticed in the more northerly settlement from which they had been thrown off like a swarm from a hive . Outside these well - defined trades there was , of course , a warehouse population , and a mass of heterogeneous cadging and catering which went on chiefly in the riverside streets at the other side of the parish from Elgood Street , in the neighbourhood of St. Wilfrid 's . St. Wilfrid 's at this moment seemed to Robert to be doing a very successful work among the lowest strata of the parish . From them at one end of the scale , and from the innumerable clerks and superintendents who during the daytime crowded the vast warehouses of which the district was full , its Lenten congregations , now in full activity , were chiefly drawn . The Protestant opposition , which had shown itself so brutally and persistently in old days , was now , so far as outward manifestations went , all but extinct . The cassocked monk - like clergy might preach and '
266063	266270	265761	265761	Robert	359	' in the open air as much as they pleased . The populace , where it was not indifferent , was friendly , and devoted living had borne its natural fruits . A small incident , which need not be recorded , recalled to Elsmere 's mind — after he had been working some six weeks in the district — the forgotten unwelcome fact that St. Wilfrid 's was the very church where Newcome , first as senior curate and then as vicar , had spent those ten wonderful years into which Elsmere at Murewell had been never tired of inquiring . The thought of Newcome was a very sore thought . Elsmere had written to him announcing his resignation of his living immediately after his interview with the bishop . The letter had remained unanswered , and it was by now tolerably clear that the silence of its recipient meant a withdrawal from all friendly relations with the writer . Elsmere 's affectionate sensitive nature took such things hardly , especially as he knew that Newcome 's life was becoming increasingly difficult and embittered . And it gave him now a fresh pang to imagine how Newcome would receive the news of his quondam friend 's '
266274	266691	265761	265761	Robert	359	' established on the very ground where he himself had all but died for those beliefs Elsmere had thrown over . But Robert was learning a certain hardness in this London life which was not without its uses to character . Hitherto he had always swum with the stream , cheered by the support of all the great and prevailing English traditions . Here , he and his few friends were fighting a solitary fight apart from the organised system of English religion and English philanthropy . All the elements of culture and religion already existing in the place were against them . The clergy of St. Wilfrid 's passed them with cold averted eyes ; the old and fainéant rector of the parish church very soon let it be known what he thought as to the taste of Elsmere 's intrusion on his parish , or as to the eternal chances of those who might take either him or Edwardes as guides in matters religious . His enmity did Elgood Street no harm , and the pretensions of the Church , in this Babel of 20,000 souls , to cover the whole field , bore clearly no relation at all to the facts . But every little incident in this new struggle of his life cost Elsmere more perhaps than it would have cost other men . No part of it came easily to him . Only a high Utopian vision drove him on from day to day , bracing him to act and judge , if need be , alone and for himself , approved only by conscience and the inward voice . and it was that moment by the river which worked in him through all the prosaic and perplexing details of this new attempt to carry enthusiasm into life . It was soon plain to him that in this teeming section of London the chance of the religious reformer lay entirely among the upper working class . In London , at any rate , all that is most prosperous and intelligent among the working class holds itself aloof — broadly speaking — from all existing spiritual agencies , whether of Church or Dissent . Upon the genuine London artisan the Church has practically no hold whatever ; and Dissent has nothing like the hold which it has on similar material in the great towns of the North . Towards religion in general the prevailing attitude is one of indifference tinged with hostility . '
266725	266862	267933	267934	a mechanic	6641	' Such is the estimate of an Evangelical of our day ; and similar laments come from all parts of the capital . The Londoner is on the whole more conceited , more prejudiced , more given over to crude theorising , than his North - country brother , the mill - hand , whose mere position , as one of a homogeneous and tolerably constant body , subjects him to a continuous discipline of intercourse and discussion . Our popular religion , broadly speaking , means nothing to him . He is sharp enough to see through its contradictions and absurdities ; he has no dread of losing what he never valued ; his sense of antiquity , of history , is nil ; and his life supplies him with excitement enough without the stimulants of '
266867	267680	267933	267934	a mechanic	6641	' Religion has been on the whole irrationally presented to him , and the result on his part has been an irrational breach with the whole moral and religious order of ideas . But the race is quick - witted and imaginative . The Greek cities which welcomed and spread Christianity carried within them much the same elements as are supplied by certain sections of the London working class — elements of restlessness , of sensibility , of passion . The mere intermingling of races , which a modern capital shares with those old towns of Asia Minor , predisposes the mind to a greater openness and receptiveness , whether for good or evil . As the weeks passed on , and after the first inevitable despondency produced by strange surroundings and an unwonted isolation had begun to wear off , Robert often found himself filled with a strange flame and ardour of hope ! But his first steps had nothing to do with religion . He made himself quickly felt in the night - school , and as soon as he possibly could he hired a large room at the back of their existing room , on the same floor , where , on the recreation evenings , he might begin the story - telling , which had been so great a success at Murewell . The story - telling struck the neighbourhood as a great novelty . At first only a few youths straggled in from the front room , where dominoes and draughts and the illustrated papers held seductive sway . The next night the number was increased , and by the fourth or fifth evening the room was so well filled both by boys and a large contingent of artisans , that it seemed well to appoint a special evening in the week for story - telling , or the recreation room would have been deserted . In these performances Elsmere 's aim had always been twofold — the rousing of moral sympathy and the awakening of the imaginative power pure and simple . He ranged the whole world for stories . Sometimes it would be merely some feature of London life itself — the history of a great fire , for instance , and its hairbreadth escapes ; a collision in the river ; a string of instances as true and homely and realistic as they could be made of the way in which the poor help one another . Sometimes it would be stories illustrating the dangers and difficulties of particular trades — a colliery explosion and the daring of the rescuers ; incidents from the life of the great Northern ironworks , or from that of the Lancashire factories ; or stories of English country life and its humours , given sometimes in dialect — Devonshire , or Yorkshire , or Cumberland — for which he had a special gift . Or , again , he would take the sea and its terrors — the immortal story of the Birkenhead ; the deadly plunge of the Captain ; the records of the lifeboats , or the fascinating story of the ships of science , exploring step by step , through miles of water , the past , the inhabitants , the hills and valleys of that underworld , that vast Atlantic bed , in which Mont Blanc might be buried without showing even his topmost snowfield above the plain of waves . Then at other times it would be the simple frolic and fancy of fiction — fairy tale and legend , Greek myth or Icelandic saga , episodes from Walter Scott , from Cooper , from Dumas ; to be followed perhaps on the next evening by the terse and vigorous biography of some man of the people — of Stephenson or Cobden , of Thomas Cooper or John Bright , or even of Thomas Carlyle . One evening , some weeks after it had begun , Hugh Flaxman , hearing from Rose of the success of the experiment , went down to hear his new acquaintance tell the story of Monte Cristo 's escape from the Château d'If . He started an hour earlier than was necessary , and with an admirable impartiality he spent that hour at St. Wilfrid 's hearing vespers . Flaxman had a passion for intellectual or social novelty ; and this passion was beguiling him into a close observation of Elsmere . At the same time he was crossed and complicated by all sorts of fastidious conservative fibres , and when his friends talked rationalism , it often gave him a vehement pleasure to maintain that a good Catholic or Ritualist service was worth all their arguments , and would outlast them . His taste drew him to the Church , so did a love of opposition to current '
267683	267921	267933	267934	a mechanic	6641	' Bishops counted on him for subscriptions , and High Church divines sent him their pamphlets . He never refused the subscriptions , but it should be added that with equal regularity he dropped the pamphlets into his waste - paper basket . Altogether a not very decipherable person in religious matters — as Rose had already discovered . The change from the dim and perfumed spaces of St. Wilfrid 's to the bare warehouse room with its packed rows of listeners was striking enough . Here were no bowed figures , no recueillement . In the blaze of crude light every eager eye was fixed upon the slight elastic figure on the platform , each change in the expressive face , each gesture of the long arms and thin flexible hands , finding its response in the laughter , the attentive silence , the frowning suspense of the audience . At one point a band of young roughs at the back made a disturbance , but their neighbours had the offenders quelled and out in a twinkling , and the room cried out for a repetition of the sentences which had been lost in the noise . When Dantes , opening his knife with his teeth , managed to cut the strings of the sack , a gasp of relief ran through the crowd ; when at last he reached terra firma there was a ringing cheer .

During the story Flaxman had noticed the man 's thin begrimed hand , as it rested on the bench in front of him , trembling with excitement . Another project of Robert 's , started as soon as he had felt his way a little in the district , was the scientific Sunday school . This was the direct result of a paragraph in Huxley 's Lay Sermons , where the hint of such a school was first thrown out . However , since the introduction of science teaching into the Board schools , the novelty and necessity of such a supplement to a child 's ordinary education is not what it was . Robert set it up mainly for the sake of drawing the boys out of the streets in the afternoons , and providing them with some other food for fancy and delight than larking and smoking and penny dreadfuls . A little simple chemical and electrical experiment went down greatly ; so did a botany class , to which Elsmere would come armed with two stores of flowers , one to be picked to pieces , the other to be distributed according to memory and attention . A year before he had had a number of large coloured plates of tropical fruit and flowers prepared for him by a Kew assistant . These he would often set up on a large screen , or put up on the walls , till the dingy schoolroom became a bower of superb blossom and luxuriant leaf , a glow of red and purple and orange . And then — still by the help of pictures — he would take his class on a tour through strange lands , talking to them of China or Egypt or South America , till they followed him up the Amazon , or into the pyramids or through the Pampas , or into the mysterious buried cities of Mexico , as the children of Hamelin followed the magic of the Pied Piper . Hardly any of those who came to him , adults or children , while almost all of the artisan class , were of the poorest class . He knew it , and had laid his plans for such a result . Such work as he had at heart has no chance with the lowest in the social scale , in its beginnings . It must have something to work upon , and must penetrate downwards . He only can receive who already hath — there is no profounder axiom . And meanwhile the months passed on , and he was still brooding , still waiting . At last the spark fell . There , in the next street but one to Elgood Street , rose the famous Workmen 's Club of North R——. It had been started by a former Liberal clergyman of the parish , whose main object , however , had been to train the workmen to manage it for themselves . His training had been , in fact , too successful . Not only was it now wholly managed by artisans , but it had come to be a centre of active , nay , brutal , opposition to the Church and faith which had originally fostered it . In organic connection with it was a large debating hall , in which the most notorious secularist lecturers held forth every Sunday evening ; and next door to it , under its shadow and patronage , was a little dingy shop filled to overflowing with the coarsest free - thinking publications , Colonel Ingersoll 's books occupying the place of honour in the window and the Freethinker placard flaunting at the door . Inside there was still more highly seasoned literature even than the Freethinker to be had . There was in particular a small halfpenny paper which was understood to be in some sense the special organ of the North R — — Club ; which was at any rate published close by , and edited by one of the workmen founders of the club . This unsavoury sheet began to be more and more defiantly advertised through the parish as Lent drew on towards Passion week , and the exertions of St. Wilfrid 's and of the other churches , which were being spurred on by the Ritualists '

272102	272177	272099	272099	Flaxman	560	' that your two sisters - in - law were going down there with Lady Helen , to meet some musical folk . Well , they are not coming . Miss Leyburn thinks your mother - in - law not very well to - day , and does n't like to come . And your younger sister prefers also to stay in town . Helen is much disappointed , so am I. But — — '

272534	272554	272530	272530	Robert	359	' Go down to Greenlaws , and go to church . That will be much more in your line . '
272555	272560	272562	272562	Flaxman	560	' As for church , '
272565	272643	272562	272562	Flaxman	560	' if I put off my party altogether , and stay in town , there will be this further advantage , that , after hearing you on Saturday night , I can , with a blameless impartiality , spend the following day in St. Andrew 's , Well Street . Yes ! I telegraph to Helen — she knows my ways — and I come down to protect you against an atheistical mob to - morrow night ! '
272731	272734	272735	272735	he	560	' No , '

In the first place , you wo n't see me ; in the next , if you did , you would feel me as wax in your hands . I am like the man in Sophocles — always the possession of the last speaker ! One day I am all for the church . A certain number of chances in the hundred there still are , you will admit , that she is in the right of it . And if so , why should I cut myself off from a whole host of beautiful things not to be got outside her ? But the next day — vive Elsmere and the Revolution ! If only Elsmere could persuade me intellectually ! But I never yet came across a religious novelty that seemed to me to have a leg of logic to stand on ! '

I will go down beforehand and see some one on the spot , in case there should be difficulties about getting in . Perhaps Miss Leyburn , too , might like to hear her brother - in - law ? '
273193	273198	273200	273201	Lady Charlotte	556	' Really , Hugh , '
273204	273237	273200	273201	Lady Charlotte	556	' I think you might take your snubbing with dignity . Her refusal this morning to go to Greenlaws was brusqueness itself . To my mind that young person gives herself airs ! '
273257	273264	273266	273266	Flaxman	560	' Yes , I was snubbed , '
273270	273292	273266	273266	Flaxman	560	' that , however , is no reason why she should n't find it attractive to go to - morrow night . '

273473	273520	273470	273471	Lady Charlotte	556	' Who ? Elsmere 's ? My dear aunt , when you happen to be the orthodox wife of a rising heretic , your husband 's opinions are not exactly the spectacular performance they are to you and me . I should think it most unlikely . '
273521	273531	273578	273579	Lady Charlotte	556	' Oh , she persecutes him , does she ? '

273938	273956	273925	273925	she	556	' a woman , in my opinion , ought to go with her husband in religious matters . '
273957	273972	273975	273976	Mr. Wynnstay	563	' Provided , of course , she sets him at nought in all others , '
273985	274022	274023	274023	He	563	' Many men , however , my dear , might be willing to compromise it differently . Granted a certain modicum of worldly conformity , they would not be at all indisposed to a conscience clause . '

274867	274888	274861	274861	herself	369	' But I had rather not leave London this week . I think I will stay with mamma and Agnes . '

275074	275137	275138	275138	I	0	' And over his solitary fire he meditated far into the night . Next day , at half - past seven in the evening , he entered Lady Charlotte 's drawing - room , gayer , brisker , more alert than ever . Rose started visibly at the sight of him , and shot a quick glance at the unblushing Lady Charlotte . '
275145	275180	275140	275140	you	560	' she could not help saying to him , as she coldly offered him her hand . Why had Lady Charlotte never told her he was to escort them ? Her irritation rose anew . '
275186	275191	275183	275183	one	917	' he said lightly , '
275227	276013	276014	276015	Miss Leyburn	369	' Rose flushed up , but he turned on his heel at once , and began to banter his aunt on the housekeeper 's bonnet and veil in which she had a little too obviously disguised herself . And certainly , in the drive to the East End , Rose had no reason to complain of importunity on his part . Most of the way he was deep in talk with Lady Charlotte as to a certain loan exhibition in the East End , to which he and a good many of his friends were sending pictures ; apparently his time and thoughts were entirely occupied with it . Rose , leaning back silent in her corner , was presently seized with a little shock of surprise that there should be so many interests and relations in his life of which she knew nothing . He was talking now as the man of possessions and influence . She saw a glimpse of him as he was in his public aspect , and the kindness , the disinterestedness , the quiet sense , and the humour of his talk insensibly affected her as she sat listening . The mental image of him which had been dominant in her mind altered a little . Nay , she grew a little hot over it . She asked herself scornfully whether she were not as ready as any bread - and - butter miss of her acquaintance to imagine every man she knew in love with her . Very likely he had meant what he said quite differently , and she — oh ! humiliation — had flown into a passion with him for no reasonable cause . Supposing he had meant , two days ago , that if they were to go on being friends she must let him be her lover too , it would of course have been unpardonable . How could she let any one talk to her of love yet — especially Mr. Flaxman , who guessed , as she was quite sure , what had happened to her ? He must despise her to have imagined it . His outburst had filled her with the oddest and most petulant resentment . Were all men self - seeking ? Did all men think women shallow and fickle ? Could a man and a woman never be honestly and simply friends ? If he had made love to her , he could not possibly — and there was the sting of it — feel towards her maiden dignity that romantic respect which she herself cherished towards it . For it was incredible that any delicate - minded girl should go through such a crisis as she had gone through , and then fall calmly into another lover 's arms a few weeks later as though nothing had happened . How we all attitudinise to ourselves ! The whole of life often seems one long dramatic performance , in which one half of us is for ever posing to the other half . But had he really made love to her?—had he meant what she had assumed him to mean ? The girl lost herself in a torment of memory and conjecture , and meanwhile Mr. Flaxman sat opposite , talking away , and looking certainly as little love - sick as any man can well look . As the lamps flashed into the carriage her attention was often caught by his profile and finely - balanced head , by the hand lying on his knee , or the little gestures , full of life and freedom , with which he met some raid of Lady Charlotte 's on his opinions , or opened a corresponding one on hers . There was certainly power in the man , a bright human sort of power , which inevitably attracted her . And that he was good too she had special grounds for knowing . But what an aristocrat he was after all ! What an over - prosperous exclusive set he belonged to ! She lashed herself into anger as the other two chatted and sparred , with all these names of wealthy cousins and relations , with their parks and their pedigrees and their pictures ! The aunt and nephew were debating how they could best bleed the family , in its various branches , of the art treasures belonging to it for the benefit of the East - Enders ; therefore the names were inevitable . But Rose curled her delicate lip over them . And was it the best breeding , she wondered , to leave a third person so ostentatiously outside the conversation ? '
276022	276028	276019	276019	you	369	' said Lady Charlotte suddenly . '
276035	276043	276019	276019	you	369	' said Rose , shivering a little . '
276048	276053	276019	276019	you	369	' cried Lady Charlotte . '
276072	276083	276064	276064	Hugh	560	' He moved over to her and drew it up . '
276091	276099	276086	276086	you	369	' he said to her , smiling . '
276110	276111	276115	276115	you	0	' '
276117	276137	276115	276115	you	0	' she replied rather stiffly , and he was silent — retaining his place opposite to her , however . '
276150	276158	276141	276142	Mr. Elsmere	313	' asked Lady Charlotte , looking out . '
276182	276475	276476	276476	She	6802	' The coachman turned into a street where an open - air market was going on . The roadway and pavements were swarming ; the carriage could barely pick its way through the masses of human beings . Flaming gas - jets threw it all into strong satanic light and shade . At the corner of a dingy alley Rose could see a fight going on ; the begrimed ragged children , regardless of the April rain , swooped backwards and forwards under the very hoofs of the horses , or flattened their noses against the windows whenever the horses were forced into a walk . The young girl - figure in gray , with the gray feathered hat , seemed specially to excite their notice . The glare of the street brought out the lines of the face , the gold of the hair . The Arabs outside made loutishly flattering remarks once or twice , and Rose , colouring , drew back as far as she could into the carriage . Mr. Flaxman seemed not to hear ; his aunt , with that obtrusive thirst for information which is so fashionable now among all women of position , was cross - questioning him as to the trades and population of the district , and he was drily responding . In reality his mind was full of a whirl of feeling , of a wild longing to break down a futile barrier and trample on a baffling resistance , to take that beautiful tameless creature in strong coercing arms , scold her , crush her , love her ! Why does she make happiness so difficult ? What right has she to hold devotion so cheap ? He too grows angry . '
276486	276555	276476	276476	She	6802	' the inner self declares with energy—'I will vow she never was . But she is like all the rest — a slave to the merest forms and trappings of sentiment . Because he ought to have loved her , and did n't , because she fancied she loved him , and did n't , my love is to be an offence to her ! Monstrous — unjust ! '
276596	276601	276675	276675	he	755	' torches glimmering fair , '
276622	276627	276628	276628	she	369	' What angel singing ! '
276648	276666	276628	276628	she	369	' Did you hear it ? It was the last chorus in the St. Matthew Passion music . '
276667	276674	276675	276675	he	755	' I did not distinguish it , '
276682	276802	276675	276675	he	755	' His tone was distant ; there was no friendliness in it . It would have been pleasant to her if he would have taken up her little remark and let bygones be bygones . But he showed no readiness to do so . The subject dropped , and presently he moved back to his former seat and Lady Charlotte and he resumed their talk . Rose could not but see that his manner towards her was much changed . She herself had compelled it , but all the same she saw him leave her with a capricious little pang of regret , and afterwards the drive seemed to her more tedious and the dismal streets more dismal than before .
276938	276946	276947	276947	she	6808	' What will he have to say ? '
277009	277019	277021	277021	Flaxman	560	' I saw the president of the club yesterday , '
277026	277093	277021	277021	Flaxman	560	' He is an old friend of mine — a most intelligent fanatic — met him on a Mansion House Fund committee last winter . He promised we should be looked after . But we shall only get back seats , and you 'll have to put up with the smoking . They do n't want ladies , and we shall only be there on sufferance . '

277258	277334	277245	277245	he	758	' It was a new position for Lady Charlotte to be anywhere on sufferance . However , in the presence of three hundred smoking men , who might all of them be political assassins in disguise for anything she knew , she accepted her fate with meekness ; and she and Rose settled themselves into their back seat under a rough sort of gallery , glad of their veils , and nearly blinded with the smoke .
277519	277524	277526	277527	Mr. Flaxman	560	' There he is , '
277564	277571	277573	277574	Lady Charlotte	556	' He looks pale and nervous , '

As some of you know , I am endeavouring to make what is practically a settlement among you , asking you working - men to teach me , if you will , what you have to teach as to the wants and prospects of your order , and offering you in return whatever there is in me which may be worth your taking . Well , I imagine I should look at a man who preferred a claim of that sort with some closeness ! You may well ask me for " antecedents , " and I should like , if I may , to give them to you very shortly . '

As he spoke about a score of pipes which had till now been active in Flaxman 's neighbourhood went down . The silence in the room became suddenly of a perceptibly different quality . '
278942	278969	278925	278926	the men	3233	' Voice and look had kindled into fire . The consciousness of his audience was passing from him — the world of ideas was growing clearer . '

And into the silence there fell , one by one , the short terse sentences , in which the seer , the believer , struggled to express what God has been , is , and will ever be to the soul which trusts Him . In them the whole effort of the speaker was really to restrain , to moderate , to depersonalise the voice of faith . But the intensity of each word burnt it into the hearer as it was spoken . Even Lady Charlotte turned a little pale — the tears stood in her eyes . Then , from the witness of God in the soul , and in the history of man 's moral life , Elsmere turned to the glorification of Experience , '

279661	279725	279624	279624	God	304	' restating Hume 's old argument , and adding to it some of the most cogent of those modern arguments drawn from literature , from history , from the comparative study of religions and religious evidence , which were not practically at Hume 's disposal , but which are now affecting the popular mind as Hume 's reasoning could never have affected it .

You think — because it is becoming plain to the modern eye that the ignorant love of his first followers wreathed his life in legend , that therefore you can escape from Jesus of Nazareth , you can put him aside as though he had never been ? Folly ! Do what you will , you can not escape him . His life and death underlie our institutions as the alphabet underlies our literature . Just as the lives of Buddha and of Mohammed are wrought ineffaceably into the civilisation of Africa and Asia , so the life of Jesus is wrought ineffaceably into the higher civilisation , the nobler social conceptions of Europe . It is wrought into your being and into mine . We are what we are to - night , as Englishmen and as citizens , largely because a Galilean peasant was born and grew to manhood , and preached , and loved , and died . And you think that a fact so tremendous can be just scoffed away — that we can get rid of it , and of our share in it , by a ribald paragraph and a caricature ! '

Simply this , as I conceive it — that instead of wasting your time , and degrading your souls , by indulgence in such grime as this'—and he pointed to the newspapers—'it is your urgent business and mine — at this moment — to do our very utmost to bring this life of Jesus , our precious invaluable possession as a people , back into some real and cogent relation with our modern lives and beliefs and hopes . Do not answer me that such an effort is a mere dream and futility , conceived in the vague , apart from reality — that men must have something to worship , and that if they can not worship Jesus they will not trouble to love him . Is the world desolate with God still in it , and does it rest merely with us to love or not to love ? Love and revere something we must , if we are to be men and not beasts . At all times and in all nations , as I have tried to show you , man has helped himself by the constant and passionate memory of those great ones of his race who have spoken to him most audibly of God and of eternal hope . And for us Europeans and Englishmen , as I have also tried to show you , history and inheritance have decided . If we turn away from the true Jesus of Nazareth because he has been disfigured and misrepresented by the Churches , we turn away from that in which our weak wills and desponding souls are meant to find their most obvious and natural help and inspiration — from that symbol of the Divine , which , of necessity , means most to us . No ! give him back your hearts — be ashamed that you have ever forgotten your debt to him ! Let combination and brotherhood do for the newer and simpler faith what they did once for the old — let them give it a practical shape , a practical grip on human life .... Then we too shall have our Easter!—we too shall have the right to say , He is not here , he is risen . Not here — in legend , in miracle , in the beautiful outworn forms and crystallisations of older thought . He is risen — in a wiser reverence and a more reasonable love ; risen in new forms of social help inspired by his memory , called afresh by his name ! Risen — if you and your children will it — in a church or company of the faithful , over the gates of which two sayings of man 's past , into which man 's present has breathed new meanings , shall be written : — '

In the midst of it , and as the majority of the audience were filing out into the adjoining rooms , the gasfitter 's tall companion Andrews mounted the platform , while the gasfitter himself , with an impatient shrug , pushed his way into the outgoing crowd . Andrews went slowly and deliberately to work , dealing out his long cantankerous sentences with a nasal sang froid which seemed to change in a moment the whole aspect and temperature of things . He remarked that Mr. Elsmere had talked of what great scholars had done to clear up this matter of Christ and Christianity .

285397	286078	286079	286079	You	7048	' that afterwards he never missed a lecture . Lestrange was more difficult . He had the inherited temperament of the Genevese frondeur , which made Geneva the headquarters of Calvinism in the sixteenth century , and bids fair to make her the headquarters of continental radicalism in the nineteenth . Robert never felt his wits so much stretched and sharpened as when after the lecture Lestrange was putting questions and objections with an acrid subtlety and persistence worthy of a descendant of that burgher class which first built up the Calvinistic system and then produced the destroyer of it in Rousseau . Robert bore his heckling , however , with great patience and adroitness . He had need of all he knew , as Murray Edwardes had warned him . But luckily he knew a great deal ; his thought was clearing and settling month by month , and whatever he may have lost at any moment by the turn of an argument , he recovered immediately afterwards by the force of personality , and of a single - mindedness in which there was never a trace of personal grasping . Week by week the lecture became more absorbing to him , the men more pliant , his hold on them firmer . His disinterestedness , his brightness and resource , perhaps , too , the signs about him of a light and frail physical organisation , the novelty of his position , the inventiveness of his method , gave him little by little an immense power in the place . After the first two lectures Murray Edwardes became his constant and enthusiastic hearer on Sunday afternoons , and , catching some of Robert 's ways and spirit , he gradually brought his own chapel and teaching more and more into line with the Elgood Street undertaking . So that the venture of the two men began to take ever larger proportions ; and , kindled by the growing interest and feeling about him , dreams began to rise in Elsmere 's mind which as yet he hardly dared to cherish ; which came and went , however , weaving a substance for themselves out of each successive incident and effort . Meanwhile he was at work on an average three evenings in the week besides the Sunday . In West End drawing - rooms his personal gift had begun to tell no less than in this crowded , squalid East ; and as his aims became known , other men , finding the thoughts of their own hearts revealed in him , or touched with that social compunction which is one of the notes of our time , came down and became his helpers . Of all the social projects of which that Elgood Street room became the centre , Elsmere was , in some sense , the life and inspiration . But it was not these projects themselves which made this period of his life remarkable . London at the present moment , if it be honeycombed with vice and misery , is also honeycombed with the labour of an ever - expanding charity . Week by week men and women of like gifts and energies with Elsmere spend themselves , as he did , in the constant effort to serve and to alleviate . What was noticeable , what was remarkable in this work of his , was the spirit , the religious passion which , radiating from him , began after a while , to kindle the whole body of men about him . It was from his Sunday lectures and his talks with the children , boys and girls , who came in after the lecture to spend a happy hour and a half with him on Sunday afternoons , that in later years hundreds of men and women will date the beginnings of a new absorbing life . There came a time , indeed , when , instead of meeting criticism by argument , Robert was able simply to point to accomplished facts . '
286083	286090	286079	286079	You	7048	' he would say in effect , '
286206	286253	286254	286255	Mr. Wendover	465	' However , we are anticipating . Let us go back to May. One beautiful morning Robert was sitting working in his study , his windows open to the breezy blue sky and the budding plane - trees outside , when the door was thrown open and '

The gait was feeble , the bearing had lost all its old erectness , the bronzed strength of the face had given place to a waxen and ominous pallor . Robert , springing up with joy to meet the great gust of Murewell air which seemed to blow about him with the mention of the squire 's name , was struck , arrested . He guided his guest to a chair with an almost filial carefulness . '

He grasped his umbrella between his knees with a pair of brown twisted hands , and , sitting very upright , looked critically round the room . Robert , studying the dwindled figure , remembered with a pang the saying of another Oxford scholar , à propos of the death of a young man of extraordinary promise , '

292440	292454	292457	292457	she	7243	' Robert , you look so tired ! and how late you are ! '
292463	292472	292457	292457	she	7243	' And your coat — torn — blood ! '
292473	292483	292484	292484	he	359	' There is nothing wrong with me , dear , '
292533	292550	292526	292526	you	560	' And , loosing his hold , he went heavily out of the room and upstairs . '
292557	292565	292526	292526	you	560	' said Flaxman gently , coming forward , '
292598	292646	292647	292647	We	7253	' He sat down with a long breath , evidently trying to regain his ordinary even manner . His clothes , too , were covered with dust , and his hand shook . Catherine stood before him in consternation , while a nurse came for the child . '
292657	292663	292698	292700	a great crowd	7258	' he said at last , '
292743	292744	292736	292736	him	8810	' '
292748	292773	292736	292736	him	8810	' Catherine repeated vacantly . Flaxman looked up at her , as though puzzled ; then a flash of astonishment passed over his face . '
292799	292800	292780	292781	Charles Richards	772	' '
292805	292821	292780	292781	Charles Richards	772	' she said slowly . Again he looked astonished ; then he went on sadly : '
292969	292975	292962	292963	The neighbours	9746	' Then he stopped himself . '
292984	292989	292977	292977	I	0	' he said kindly ; '
293008	293009	292996	292996	I	0	' '
293013	293018	292996	292996	I	0	' she said hurriedly ; '
293024	293051	292996	292996	I	0	' And she forgot to feel any wonder that Flaxman , in his chivalry , should treat her as though she were a girl with nerves . '
293505	293523	293524	293525	Your husband	8810	' Flaxman paused , and looked away out of window . He told his story with difficulty . '
293710	293727	293701	293701	he	8810	' He looked up at her interrogatively , but there was no response in her face . '
293734	293740	293728	293728	I	0	' the speaker went on , '
293770	293771	293746	293746	He	8810	' '
293780	293802	293773	293773	he	8810	' asked Catherine presently after a silence . Her voice was dull and quiet . He thought her a strange woman . '
293805	293812	293773	293773	he	8810	' said Flaxman , almost sharply ; '
293908	293966	293973	293973	he	8810	' Hugh Flaxman sat looking out into the dingy bit of London garden . Penetrated with pity as he was , he felt the presence of Elsmere 's pale , silent , unsympathetic wife an oppression . How could she receive such a story in such a way ? The door opened and Robert came in hurriedly . '
293978	294007	293973	293973	he	8810	' He stood by her , his hand on her shoulder , wistfully looking at her , the face full of signs of what he had gone through . '
294014	294380	293973	293973	he	8810	' she said , with an effort . His face fell . He kissed her on the forehead and went away . When he was gone , Flaxman suddenly got up and leant against the open French window , looking keenly down on his companion . A new idea had stirred in him . And presently , after more talk of the incident of the afternoon , and when he had recovered his usual manner , he slipped gradually into the subject of his own experiences in North R — — during the last six months . He assumed all through that she knew as much as there was to be known of Elsmere 's work , and that she was as much interested as the normal wife is in her husband 's doings . His tact , his delicacy , never failed him for a moment . But he spoke of his own impressions , of matters within his personal knowledge . And since the Easter sermon he had been much on Elsmere 's track ; he had been filled with curiosity about him . Catherine sat a little way from him , her blue dress lying in long folds about her , her head bent , her long fingers crossed on her lap . Sometimes she gave him a startled look , sometimes she shaded her eyes , while her other hand played silently with her watch - chain . Flaxman , watching her closely , however little he might seem to do so , was struck by her austere and delicate beauty as he had never been before . She hardly spoke all through , but he felt that she listened without resistance , nay , at last that she listened with a kind of hunger . He went from story to story , from scene to scene , without any excitement , in his most ordinary manner , making his reserves now and then , expressing his own opinion when it occurred to him , and not always favourably . But gradually the whole picture emerged , began to live before them . At last he hurriedly looked at his watch . '
294399	294400	294401	294401	You	0	' '
294407	294431	294401	294401	You	0	' she said , looking up at him with a sudden nervous bewilderment which touched him and subtly changed his impression of her . '
294446	294783	294784	294788	a beastly set of tenants	7322	' When he was gone she carried the child up to bed ; her supper was brought to her solitary in the dining - room ; and afterwards in the drawing - room , where a soft twilight was fading into a soft and starlit night , she mechanically brought out some work for Mary , and sat bending over it by the window . After about an hour she looked up straight before her , threw her work down , and slipped on to the floor , her head resting on the chair . The shock , the storm , had come . There for hours lay Catherine Elsmere weeping her heart away , wrestling with herself , with memory , with God . It was the greatest moral upheaval she had ever known — greater even than that which had convulsed her life at Murewell . Robert , tired and sick at heart , felt himself in no mood this evening for a dinner - party in which conversation would be treated more or less as a fine art . Liberal Catholicism had lost its charm ; his sympathetic interest in Montalembert , Lacordaire , Lamennais , had to be quickened , pumped up again as it were , by great efforts , which were constantly relaxed within him as he sped westwards by the recurrent memory of that miserable room , the group of men , the bleeding hand , the white dying face . In Madame de Netteville 's drawing - room he found a small number of people assembled . M. de Quérouelle , a middle - sized , round - headed old gentleman of a familiar French type ; Lady Aubrey , thinner , more lath - like than ever , clad in some sumptuous mingling of dark red and silver ; Lord Rupert , beaming under the recent introduction of a Land Purchase Bill for Ireland , by which he saw his way at last to wash his hands of '
294789	294901	294788	294788	tenants	7323	' ; Mr. Wharncliffe , a young private secretary with a waxed moustache , six feet of height , and a general air of superlativeness which demanded and secured attention ; a famous journalist , whose smiling self - repressive look assured you that he carried with him the secrets of several empires ; and one Sir John Headlam , a little black - haired Jewish - looking man with a limp — an ex - Colonial Governor , who had made himself accepted in London as an amusing fellow , but who was at least as much disliked by one half of society as he was popular with the other . '
294913	294939	294788	294788	tenants	7323	' said Madame de Netteville to Robert , with a little smiling nod round her circle as they stood waiting for the commencement of dinner . '
294947	294955	294940	294940	I	0	' he said with a little sigh . '
294966	294975	294956	294956	I	0	' She looked at him with inquiring eyes . '
294984	294989	294990	294990	We	7325	' he said briefly . '
295014	295189	294788	294788	tenants	7323	' She said no more , but , seeing that he was indeed out of heart , physically and mentally , she showed the most subtle considera tion for him at dinner . M. de Quérouelle was made to talk . His hostess wound him up and set him going , tune after tune . He played them all , and , by dint of long practice , to perfection , in the French way . A visit of his youth to the island grave of Chateaubriand ; his early memories , as a poetical aspirant , of the magnificent flatteries by which Victor Hugo made himself the god of young romantic Paris ; his talks with Montalembert in the days of L'Avenir ; his memories of Lamennais 's sombre figure , of Maurice de Guérin 's feverish ethereal charm ; his account of the opposition salons under the Empire — they had all been elaborated in the course of years , till every word fitted and each point led to the next with the '
295191	295350	295411	295411	they	7330	' of true art . Robert , at first silent and distrait , found it impossible after a while not to listen with interest . He admired the skill , too , of Madame de Netteville 's second in the duet , the finish , the alternate sparkle and melancholy of it ; and at last he too was drawn in , and found himself listened to with great benevolence by the Frenchman , who had been informed about him , and regarded him indulgently , as one more curious specimen of English religious provincialisms . The journalist , Mr. Addlestone , who had won a European reputation for wisdom by a great scantiness of speech in society , coupled with the look of Minerva 's owl , attached himself to them ; while Lady Aubrey , Sir John Headlam , Lord Rupert , and Mr. Wharncliffe made a noisier and more dashing party at the other end . '
295362	295376	295359	295360	Lady Aubrey	703	' asked Sir John Headlam , turning his old roguish face upon her . '
295392	295393	295359	295360	Lady Aubrey	703	' '
295465	295466	295460	295460	I	0	' '
295474	295489	295460	295460	I	0	' said Sir John , mincing out his pun as though he loved it . '
295496	295505	295460	295460	I	0	' she said , looking at him calmly , '
295532	295533	295521	295521	you	351	' '
295550	295571	295572	295572	My	0	' he rejoined , smiling , though a close observer might have seen an angry flash in his little eyes . '
295654	295668	295646	295646	you	703	' He looked at her audaciously . The book had affronted even Paris . '
295673	295691	295669	295669	I	0	' she said , adjusting her bracelets , while she flashed a rapier - glance at him , '
295716	295766	295708	295708	you	706	' Lord Rupert plunged in with the gallant floundering motion characteristic of him , while Mr. Wharncliffe followed like a modern gunboat behind a three - decker . That young man was a delusion . The casual spectator , to borrow a famous Cambridge mot , invariably assumed that all '
295784	296019	295776	295776	he	351	' Not at all ! The tenue of a dandy was never more cleverly used to mask the schemes of a Disraeli or the hard ambition of a Talleyrand than in Master Frederick Wharncliffe , who was in reality going up the ladder hand over hand , and meant very soon to be on the top rungs . It was a curious party , typical of the house , and of a certain stratum of London . When , every now and then , in the pauses of their own conversation , Elsmere caught something of the chatter going on at the other end of the table , or when the party became fused into one for a while under the genial influence of a good story or the exhilaration of a personal skirmish , the whole scene — the dainty oval room , the lights , the servants , the exquisite fruit and flowers , the gleaming silver , the tapestried walls — would seem to him for an instant like a mirage , a dream , yet with something glittering and arid about it which a dream never has . The hard self - confidence of these people — did it belong to the same world as that humbling , that heavenly self - abandonment which had shone on him that afternoon from Charles Richards 's begrimed and blood - stained face ? '
296027	296038	295776	295776	he	351	' he said to himself once with an inward groan . '
296053	296136	296051	296051	Catherine	458	' But Madame de Netteville was pleasant to him . He had never seen her so womanly , never felt more grateful for her delicate social skill . As she talked to him , or to the Frenchman , of literature , or politics , or famous folk , flashing her beautiful eyes from one to the other , Sir John Headlam would , every now and then , turn his odd puckered face observantly towards the farther end of the table . '
296140	296155	296156	296156	she	458	' he said afterwards to Wharncliffe as they walked away from the door together , '
296170	296284	296163	296163	she	458	' Sir John and his hostess were very old friends . Upstairs smoking began , Lady Aubrey and Madame de Netteville joining in . M. de Quérouelle , having talked the best of his répertoire at dinner , was now inclined for amusement , and had discovered that Lady Aubrey could amuse him , and was , moreover , une belle personne . Madame de Netteville was obliged to give some time to Lord Rupert . The other men stood chatting politics and the latest news , till Robert , conscious of a complete failure of social energy , began to look at his watch . Instantly Madame de Netteville glided up to him .
296285	296319	296321	296321	she	7339	' Mr. Elsmere , you have talked no business to me , and I must know how my affairs in Elgood Street are getting on . Come into my little writing - room . '
296356	296360	296362	296363	Fred Wharncliffe	807	' The latest ? '
296384	296389	296390	296390	she	7339	' I suppose so , '
296394	296431	296390	296390	she	7339	' she is East - Ending for a change . We all do it nowadays . It is like Dizzy 's young man who " liked bad wine , he was so bored with good . " '
296454	296465	296466	296466	she	655	' You look as if you had had a strain , '
296482	296489	296490	296490	He	359	' What has been the matter ? '
296571	296586	296566	296566	she	655	' I was at your lecture last Sunday — you did n't see me ! '
296587	296620	296566	296566	she	655	' Were you ? Ah ! I remember a person in black , and veiled , who puzzled me . I do n't think we want you there , Madame de Netteville . '
296635	296655	296627	296627	his	359	' Why not ? Is it only the artisans who have souls ? A reformer should refuse no one . '
296656	296663	296664	296664	he	359	' You have your own opportunities , '
296668	296691	296664	296664	he	359	' I think the men prefer to have it to themselves for the present . Some of them are dreadfully in earnest . '
296692	296704	296705	296705	she	7348	' Oh , I do n't pretend to be in earnest , '
296715	296733	296705	296705	she	7348	' or , at any rate , I know better than to talk of earnestness to you . '
296734	296739	296740	296740	he	359	' Why to me ? '
296745	296792	296793	296793	She	7348	' Oh , because you and your like have your fixed ideas of the upper class and the lower . One social type fills up your horizon . You are not interested in any other , and , indeed , you know nothing of any other . '
296844	296848	296849	296849	he	359	' Perhaps not , '
296852	296873	296849	296849	he	359	' it is enough for one life to try and make out where the English working class is tending to . '
296874	296938	296849	296849	he	359	' You are quite wrong , utterly wrong . The man who keeps his eye only on the lower class will achieve nothing . What can the idealist do without the men of action — the men who can take his beliefs and make them enter by violence into existing institutions ? And the men of action are to be found with us . '
296939	296960	296961	296961	he	359	' It hardly looks just now as if the upper class was to go on enjoying a monopoly of them , '
296966	297071	296961	296961	he	359	' Then appearances are deceptive . The populace supplies mass and weight — nothing else . What you want is to touch the leaders , the men and women whose voices carry , and then your populace would follow hard enough . For instance,'—and she dropped her aggressive tone and spoke with a smiling kindness,—'come down next Saturday to my little Surrey cottage ; you shall see some of these men and women there , and I will make you confess when you go away that you have profited your workmen more by deserting them than by staying with them . Will you come ? '
297072	297178	297295	297295	she	7349	' My Sundays are too precious to me just now , Madame de Netteville . Besides , my firm conviction is that the upper class can produce a Brook Farm , but nothing more . The religious movement of the future will want a vast effusion of feeling and passion to carry it into action , and feeling and passion are only to be generated in sufficient volume among the masses , where the vested interests of all kinds are less tremendous . You upper - class folk have your part , of course . Woe betide you if you shirk it — but — — '
297179	297188	297189	297189	she	7349	' Oh , let us leave it alone , '
297196	297258	297189	297189	she	7349	' I know you would give us all the work and refuse us all the profits . We are to starve for your workman , to give him our hearts and purses and everything we have , not that we may hoodwink him — which might be worth doing — but that he may rule us . It is too much ! '
297259	297263	297264	297264	he	7350	' Very well , '
297272	297282	297264	297264	he	7350	' Very well , let it be too much . '
297383	297404	297405	297405	she	7349	' What did you really mean by " worldliness " and the " world " in your lecture last Sunday ? '
297417	297455	297405	297405	she	7349	' I thought your diatribes absurd . What you religious people call the " world " is really only the average opinion of sensible people which neither you nor your kind could do without for a day . '
297687	297693	297694	297694	he	351	' Very sorry , madame , '
297702	297726	297694	297694	he	351	' but Wharncliffe and I are off to the New Club to see Desforêts . They have got her there to - night . '
297727	297730	297731	297731	she	7363	' Go , '
297740	297754	297731	297731	she	7363	' I do n't envy you . She is not what she was . '
297755	297764	297765	297765	he	351	' No , there is only one person , '
297776	297783	297765	297765	he	351	' for whom time stands still . '
297810	297822	297823	297823	she	7363	' Perhaps I had better go back and send them off , '
297828	297841	297823	297823	she	7363	' But you and I have not had our talk out yet . '
297925	297928	297930	297931	Lady Aubrey	703	' My dear '
297933	297993	297994	297994	She	703	' it is disgracefully early , but my country before pleasure . It is the Foreign Office to - night , and since James took office I ca n't with decency absent myself . I had rather be a scullerymaid than a minister 's wife . Lord Rupert , I will take you on if you want a lift . '

298199	298230	298191	298191	she	703	' no : I want my talk out . It is barely half - past ten , and neither of us wants to be racing about London to - night . '
298659	298866	298657	298657	Elsmere	359	' in one minute glad life 's arrears,'—the natural penalty of an optimism , a boundless faith in human nature , with which life , as we know it , is inconsistent . How he met the softness , the grace , the seduction of a woman who was an expert in all the arts of fascination he never knew . In memory afterwards it was all a ghastly mirage to him . The low voice , the splendid dress , the scented room came back to him , and a confused memory of his own futile struggle to ward off what she was bent on saying — little else . He had been maladroit , he thought , had lost his presence of mind . Any man of the world of his acquaintance , he believed , trampling on himself , would have done better . But when the softness and the grace were all lost in smart and humiliation , when the Madame de Netteville of ordinary life disappeared , and something took her place which was like a coarse and malignant underself suddenly brought into the light of day — from that point onwards , in after days , he remembered it all . '
298871	298950	298952	298952	she	7382	' cried Eugénie de Netteville at last , standing at bay before him , her hands locked before her , her white lips quivering , when her cup of shame was full , and her one impulse left was to strike the man who had humiliated her—'I know that you and your puritanical wife are miserable — miserable . What is the use of denying facts that all the world can see , that you have taken pains , '
298962	298998	299000	299000	she	7382	' all the world shall see ? There — let your wife 's ignorance and bigotry , and your own obvious relation to her , be my excuse , if I wanted any ; but , '
299007	299038	299000	299000	she	7382	' I want none ! I am not responsible to your petty codes . Nature and feeling are enough for me . I saw you wanting sympathy and affection — — '
299039	299043	299045	299045	Robert	359	' My wife ! '
299073	299116	299066	299066	he	359	' Let me go , Madame de Netteville , let me go , or I shall forget that you are a woman and I a man , and that in some way I can not understand my own blindness and folly — — '
299117	299127	299128	299128	she	7383	' Must have led to this most undesirable scene , '
299264	299269	299270	299270	he	359	' You shall not , '
299276	299303	299270	299270	he	359	' you shall not ! What have I done — what has she done — that you should allow yourself such words ? My poor wife ! '

299371	299453	299367	299367	he	359	' thank God for yourself and me that I love my wife ! I am not worthy of her — doubly unworthy , since it has been possible for any human being to suspect for one instant that I was ungrateful for the blessing of her love , that I could ever forget and dishonour her ! But worthy or not — — No!—no matter ! Madame de Netteville , let me go , and forget that such a person exists . '
299654	299662	299663	299663	he	1055	' Save for the grace of God , '
299670	299680	299663	299663	he	1055	' save only for the grace of God — — '

I thought'—and she choked down a sob—'perhaps something has happened to him , we are separated for ever , and I shall never be able to tell him . Robert , Mr. Flaxman talked to me ; he opened my eyes ; I have been so cruel to you , so hard ! I have broken my vow . I do n't deserve it ; but — Robert ! — — '

300732	301096	300677	300677	she	7407	' My Lord is my Lord always ; but He is yours too . Oh , I know it , say what you will ! That is what has been hidden from me ; that is what my trouble has taught me ; the powerlessness , the worthlessness , of words . It is the spirit that quickeneth . I should never have felt it so , but for this fiery furnace of pain . But I have been wandering in strange places , through strange thoughts . God has not one language , but many . I have dared to think He had but one , the one I knew . I have dared'—and she faltered—'to condemn your faith as no faith . Oh ! I lay there so long in the dark downstairs , seeing you by that bed ; I heard your voice , I crept to your side . Jesus was there , too . Ah , He was — He was ! Leave me that comfort ! What are you saying ? Wrong — you ? Unkind ? Your wife knows nothing of it . Oh , did you think when you came in just now before dinner that I did n't care , that I had a heart of stone ? Did you think I had broken my solemn promise , my vow to you that day at Murewell ? So I have , a hundred times over . I made it in ignorance ; I had not counted the cost — how could I ? It was all so new , so strange . I dare not make it again , the will is so weak , circumstances so strong . But oh ! take me back into your life ! Hold me there ! Remind me always of this night ; convict me out of my own mouth ! But I will learn my lesson ; I will learn to hear the two voices , the voice that speaks to you and the voice that speaks to me — I must . It is all plain to me now . It has been appointed me . '

302954	302969	302949	302949	Robert	359	' Do you remember in this room , Langham , you introduced us first ? '
302970	302974	302976	302978	the other abruptly	7468	' I remember , '
303003	303018	302996	302996	he	359	' What a faculty of hero - worship you have always had , Elsmere ! '

303051	303058	303060	303060	Langham	464	' No , I never asked ! '
303067	303148	303060	303060	Langham	464	' What purpose could be served ? Death should be avoided by the living . We have no business with it . Do what we will , we can not rehearse our own parts . And the sight of other men 's performances helps us no more than the sight of a great actor gives the dramatic gift . All they do for us is to imperil the little nerve , break through the little calm , we have left . '
303165	303178	303155	303155	he	359	' Ah — I know it now — you loved him still . '
303195	303204	303205	303205	he	464	' How much you always made of feeling , '

303621	303933	303619	303620	the citizens	7494	' cemetery on the western side of the town , will not soon be forgotten , even in a place which forgets notoriously soon . All the University was there , all the town was there . Side by side with men honourably dear to England , who had carried with them into one or other of the great English careers the memory of the teacher , were men who had known from day to day the cheery modest helper in a hundred local causes ; side by side with the youth of Alma Mater went the poor of Oxford ; tradesmen and artisans followed or accompanied the group of gowned and venerable figures , representing the Heads of Houses and the Professors , or mingled with the slowly pacing crowd of Masters ; while along the route groups of visitors and merrymakers , young men in flannels or girls in light dresses , stood with suddenly grave faces here and there , caught by the general wave of mourning , and wondering what such a spectacle might mean . Robert , losing sight of Langham as they left the chapel , found his arm grasped by young Cathcart , his correspondent . The man was a junior Fellow who had attached himself to Grey during the two preceding years with especial devotion . Robert had only a slight knowledge of him , but there was something in his voice and grip which made him feel at once infinitely more at home with him at this moment than he had felt with the old friend of his undergraduate years . They walked down Beaumont Street together . The rain came on again , and the long black crowd stretched before them was lashed by the driving gusts . As they went along , Cathcart told him all he wanted to know . '
304093	304246	304085	304085	she	7502	'm seventy - seven this spring . I shall come to you soon . " He made no reply , and his silence seemed to disturb her . I do n't fancy she had known much of his mind of late years . " You 'll not be doubting the Lord 's goodness , Henry ? " she said to him , with the tears in her eyes . " No , " he said , " no , never . Only it seems to be His Will , we should be certain of nothing — but Himself ! I ask no more . " I shall never forget the accent of those words : they were the breath of his inmost life . If ever man was Gottbetrunken it was he — and yet not a word beyond what he felt to be true , beyond what the intellect could grasp ! '
304351	304358	304345	304345	Elsmere	359	' My friend , my master , '
304365	304403	304345	304345	Elsmere	359	' oh , give me something of yourself to take back into life , something to brace me through this darkness of our ignorance , something to keep hope alive as you kept it to the end ! '
304447	304521	304345	304345	Elsmere	359	' Amid a world of forgetfulness and decay , in the sight of his own shortcomings and limitations , or on the edge of the tomb , he alone who has found his soul in losing it , who in singleness of mind has lived in order to love and understand , will find that the God who is near to him as his own conscience has a face of light and love ! '
304540	304545	304546	304546	he	359	' Man 's hope , '
304549	304590	304546	304546	he	359	' has grown humbler than this . It keeps now a more modest mien in the presence of the Eternal Mystery ; but is it in truth less real , less sustaining ? Let Grey 's trust answer for me . '
304631	304636	304637	304637	he	359	' Is Langham behind ? '
304640	304651	304637	304637	he	359	' I want a word with him before I go . '

304667	304683	304659	304660	the other	1544	' But of course ! He was in the chapel . How could you — — '
304684	304693	304695	304695	Cathcart	811	' I thought he would probably go away , '
304700	304731	304695	304695	Cathcart	811	' Grey made many efforts to get him to come and see him before he became so desperately ill . Langham came once . Grey never asked for him again . '
304732	304744	304746	304746	Robert	359	' It is his old horror of expression , I suppose , '
304749	304800	304746	304746	Robert	359	' his dread of being forced to take a line , to face anything certain and irrevocable . I understand . He could not say good - bye to a friend to save his life . There is no shirking that ! One must either do it or leave it ! '
304840	305047	305048	305048	Both	8996	' He attends college - meeting sometimes , and contributes a sarcasm or two on the cramming system of the college . He takes a constitutional to Summertown every day on the least frequented side of the road , that he may avoid being spoken to . And as to his ways of living , he and I happen to have the same scout — old Dobson , you remember ? And if I would let him , he would tell me tales by the hour . He is the only man in the University who knows anything about it . I gather from what he says that Langham is becoming a complete valetudinarian . Everything must go exactly by rule — his food , his work , the management of his clothes — and any little contretemps makes him ill . But the comedy is to watch him when there is anything going on in the place that he thinks may lead to a canvass and to any attempt to influence him for a vote . On these occasions he goes off with automatic regularity to an hotel at West Malvern , and only reappears when the Times tells him the thing is done with . '
305229	305237	305238	305238	He	359	' Elsmere , have you forgotten me ? '

During the whole of May he paid one formal call in Lerwick Gardens , and was then entertained tête - à - tête by Mrs. Leyburn , to Rose 's intense subsequent annoyance , who knew perfectly well that her mother was incapable of chattering about anything but her daughters . He still sent flowers , but they came from his head gardener , addressed to Mrs. Leyburn . Agnes put them in water ; and Rose never gave them a look . Rose went to Lady Helen 's because Lady Helen made her , and was much too engaging a creature to be rebuffed ; but , however merry and protracted the teas in those scented rooms might be , Mr. Flaxman 's step on the stairs , and Mr. Flaxman 's hand on the curtain over the door , till now the feature in the entertainment most to be counted on , were , generally speaking , conspicuously absent . He and the Leyburns met , of course ; for their list of common friends was now considerable ; but Agnes , reporting matters to Catherine , could only say that each of these occasions left Rose more irritable , and more inclined to say biting things as to the foolish ways in which society takes its pleasures . Rose certainly was irritable , and at times , Agnes thought , depressed . But as usual she was unapproachable about her own affairs , and the state of her mind could only be somewhat dolefully gathered from the fact that she was much less unwilling to go back to Burwood this summer than had ever been known before . Meanwhile , Mr. Flaxman left certain other people in no doubt as to his intentions . '

306309	306477	306295	306295	you	560	' Lady Charlotte was in a most variable frame of mind ; one day hoping devoutly that the Langham affair might prove lasting enough in its effects to tire Hugh out ; the next , outraged that a silly girl should waste a thought on such a creature , while Hugh was in her way ; at one time angry that an insignificant chit of a schoolmaster 's daughter should apparently care so little to be the Duke of Sedbergh 's niece , and should even dare to allow herself the luxury of snubbing a Flaxman ; at another , utterly sceptical as to any lasting obduracy on the chit 's part . The girl was clearly anxious not to fall too easily , but as to final refusal — pshaw ! And it made her mad that Hugh would hold himself so cheap . Meanwhile , Mr. Flaxman felt himself in no way called upon to answer that remark of his aunt 's we have recorded . '
306482	306486	306295	306295	you	560	' he repeated , '
306504	306513	306497	306497	you	7556	' Lady Charlotte crossed her hands before her . '
306525	306530	306497	306497	you	7556	' she said firmly , '

306603	306664	306592	306592	Helen	483	' But this did not suit Lady Charlotte at all . She had always played the part of earthly providence to this particular nephew , and it was abominable to her that the wretch , having refused for ten years to provide her with a love affair to manage , should now manage one for himself in spite of her .

307598	308007	307580	307580	Your	369	' Rose listened ; her eye kindled ; the maid was summoned ; and the invitation accepted in Agnes 's neatest hand . Even Catherine was roused during the following ten days to a smiling indulgent interest in the concerns of the workroom . The evening came , and Lady Helen fetched the sisters in her carriage . The ball was a magnificent affair . The house was one of historical interest and importance , and all that the ingenuity of the present could do to give fresh life and gaiety to the pillared rooms , the carved galleries and stately staircases of the past , had been done . The ball - room , lined with Vandycks and Lelys , glowed softly with electric light ; the picture gallery had been banked with flowers and carpeted with red , and the beautiful dresses of the women trailed up and down it , challenging the satins of the Netschers and the Terburgs on the walls . Rose 's card was soon full to overflowing . The young men present were of the smartest , and would not willingly have bowed the knee to a nobody , however pretty . But Lady Helen 's devotion , the girl 's reputation as a musician , and her little nonchalant disdainful ways , gave her a kind of prestige , which made her , for the time being at any rate , the equal of anybody . Petitioners came and went away empty . Royalty was introduced , and smiled both upon the beauty and the beauty 's delicate and becoming dress ; and still Rose , though a good deal more flushed and erect than usual , and though flesh and blood could not resist the contagious pleasure which glistened even in the eyes of that sage Agnes , was more than half - inclined to say with the Preacher , that all was vanity . Presently , as she stood waiting with her hand on her partner 's arm before gliding into a waltz , she saw Mr. Flaxman opposite to her , and with him a young débutante in white tulle — a thin , pretty , undeveloped creature , whose sharp elbows and timid movements , together with the blushing enjoyment glowing so frankly from her face , pointed her out as the school - girl of sweet seventeen , just emancipated , and trying her wings . '

Mr. Flaxman was of it . She was not . '
308129	308141	308062	308063	a cousin	7577	' the little Jacobin said to herself fiercely as she waltzed ; '

309022	309027	309029	309030	Lady Helen	483	' That 's over , '
309034	309087	309029	309030	Lady Helen	483	' My uncle hardly meets any of us now without a spar . He has never forgiven my father for going over to the Liberals . And then he thinks we none of us consult him enough . No more we do — except Aunt Charlotte . She 's afraid of him ! '
309088	309093	309095	309095	Rose	369	' Lady Charlotte afraid ! '
309097	309119	309095	309095	Rose	369	' Odd , is n't it ? The Duke avenges a good many victims on her , if they only knew ! '
309171	309274	309163	309163	she	819	' conversation such as , by the kind contrivances of fate , a girl is tolerably sure to hear under similar circumstances . The débutante 's good looks , Hugh Flaxman 's apparent susceptibility to them , the possibility of results , and the satisfactory disposition of the family goods and chattels that would be brought about by such a match , the opportunity it would offer the man , too , of rehabilitating himself socially after his first matrimonial escapade — Rose caught fragments of all these topics as they were discussed by two old ladies , presumably also of the family '
309277	309424	309163	309163	she	819	' who gossiped behind her with more gusto than discretion . Highmindedness , of course , told her to move away ; something else held her fast , till her partner came up for her . Then she floated away into the whirlwind of waltzers . But as she moved round the room on her partner 's arm , her delicate half - scornful grace attracting look after look , the soul within was all aflame — aflame against the serried ranks and phalanxes of this unfamiliar , hostile world ! She had just been reading Trevelyan 's Life of Fox aloud to her mother , who liked occasionally to flavour her knitting with literature , and she began now to revolve a passage from it , describing the upper class of the last century , which had struck that morning on her quick retentive memory : '
309550	309557	309558	309558	I	0	' said the impetuous inner voice . '
309566	309698	309558	309558	I	0	' But why so strong a flood of bitterness against our poor upper class , so well intentioned for all its occasional lack of lucidity , should have arisen in so young a breast it is a little difficult for the most conscientious biographer to explain . She had partners to her heart 's desire ; young Lord Waynflete used his utmost arts upon her to persuade her that at least half a dozen numbers of the regular programme were extras and therefore at his disposal ; and when royalty supped , it was graciously pleased to ordain that Lady Helen and her two companions should sup behind the same folding - doors as itself , while beyond these doors surged the inferior crowd of persons who had been specially invited to '
309704	309772	309700	309702	their Royal Highnesses	13725	' and had so far been held worthy neither to dance nor to eat in the same room with them . But in vain . Rose still felt herself , for all her laughing outward insouciance , a poor , bruised , helpless chattel , trodden under the heel of a world which was intolerably powerful , rich , and self - satisfied , the odious product of '
309776	309798	309799	309799	She	7623	' Mr. Flaxman sat far away at the same royal table as herself . Beside him was the thin tall débutante . '
309808	309818	309799	309799	She	7623	' thought Rose , studying her with involuntary admiration . '
309848	309980	309826	309826	He	7626	' Then it startled her to find that the eyes of Lady Florence 's neighbour were , as it seemed , on herself ; or was he merely nodding to Lady Helen?—and she began immediately to give a smiling attention to the man on her left . An hour later she and Agnes and Lady Helen were descending the great staircase on their way to their carriage . The morning light was flooding through the chinks of the carefully veiled windows ; Lady Helen was yawning behind her tiny white hand , her eyes nearly asleep . But the two sisters , who had not been up till three , on four preceding nights , like their chaperon , were still almost as fresh as the flowers massed in the hall below .
309981	309988	309990	309991	Lady Helen	483	' Ah , there is Hugh ! '
309993	310003	309990	309991	Lady Helen	483	' How I hope he has found the carriage ! '

311543	312036	312038	312038	Thy	7658	' to use the mysterious terms of the trade — Robson by name — whom Elsmere had originally known as a clever workman belonging to the watchmaking colony , and a diligent attendant from the beginning on the Sunday lectures . He was now too ill to leave his lodgings , and his sickly pessimist personality had established a special hold on Robert . He was dying of tumour in the throat , and had become a torment to himself and a disgust to others . There was a spark of wayward genius in him , however , which enabled him to bear his ills with a mixture of savage humour and clear - eyed despair . In general outlook he was much akin to the author of the City of Dreadful Night , whose poems he read ; the loathsome spectacles of London had filled him with a kind of sombre energy of revolt against all that is . And now that he could only work intermittently , he would sit brooding for hours , startling the fellow - workmen who came in to see him with ghastly Heine - like jokes on his own hideous disease , living no one exactly knew how , though it was supposed on supplies sent him by a shopkeeper uncle in the country , and constantly on the verge , as all his acquaintances felt , of some ingenious expedient or other for putting an end to himself and his troubles . He was unmarried , and a misogynist to boot . No woman willingly went near him , and he tended himself . How Robert had gained any hold upon him no one could guess . But from the moment when Elsmere , struck in the lecture - room by the pallid ugly face and swathed neck , began regularly to go and see him , the elder man felt instinctively that virtue had gone out of him , and that in some subtle way yet another life had become pitifully , silently dependent on his own stock of strength and comfort . His lecturing and teaching work also was becoming more and more the instrument of far - reaching change , and therefore more and more difficult to leave . The thoughts of God , the image of Jesus , which were active and fruitful in his own mind , had been gradually passing from the one into the many , and Robert watched the sacred transforming emotion , once nurtured at his own heart , now working among the crowd of men and women his fiery speech had gathered round him , with a trembling joy , a humble prostration of the soul before the Eternal Truth , no words can fitly describe . With an ever - increasing detachment of mind from the objects of self and sense , he felt himself a tool in the Great Workman 's hand . '
312043	312054	312038	312038	Thy	7658	' was the cry of his whole heart and life ; '
312075	312502	312067	312067	O	7659	' But in the end his work itself drove him away . A certain memorable Saturday evening brought it about . It had been his custom of late to spend an occasional evening hour after his night - school work in the North R — — Club , of which he was now by invitation a member . Here , in one of the inner rooms , he would stand against the mantelpiece chatting , smoking often with the men . Everything came up in turn to be discussed ; and Robert was at least as ready to learn from the practical workers about him as to teach . But in general these informal talks and debates became the supplement of the Sunday lectures . Here he met Andrews and the Secularist crew face to face ; here he grappled in Socratic fashion with objections and difficulties , throwing into the task all his charm and all his knowledge , a man at once of no pretensions and of unfailing natural dignity . Nothing , so far , had served his cause and his influence so well as these moments of free discursive intercourse . The mere orator , the mere talker , indeed , would never have gained any permanent hold ; but the life behind gave weight to every acute or eloquent word , and importance even to those mere sallies of a boyish enthusiasm which were still common enough in him . He had already visited the club once during the week preceding this Saturday . On both occasions there was much talk of the growing popularity and efficiency of the Elgood Street work , of the numbers attending the lectures , the story - telling , the Sunday school , and of the way in which the attractions of it had spread into other quarters of the parish , exciting there , especially among the clergy of St. Wilfrid 's , an anxious and critical attention . The conversation on Saturday night , how ever , took a turn of its own . Robert felt in it a new and curious note of responsibility . The men present were evidently beginning to regard the work as their work also , and its success as their interest . It was perfectly natural , for not only had most of them been his supporters and hearers from the beginning , but some of them were now actually teaching in the night - school or helping in the various branches of the large and overflowing boys '

312808	312875	312876	312876	He	7662	' A good thing surely , " yet is there better than it . " The real difficulty of every social effort — you know it and I know it — lies , not in the planning of the work , but in the kindling of will and passion enough to carry it through . And that can only be done by religion — by faith . '

313067	313124	313127	313127	I	0	' Again he paused with knit brows , thinking . Lestrange sat with his elbows on his knees studying him , the spare gray hair brushed back tightly from the bony face , on the lips the slightest Voltairean smile . Perhaps it was the coolness of his look which insensibly influenced Robert 's next words . '
313376	313538	313539	313540	the hartist	7682	' Other men had been stealing in while he was speaking . The little room was nearly full . It was strange , the contrast between the squalid modernness of the scene , with its incongruous sights and sounds , the Club - room , painted in various hideous shades of cinnamon and green , the smoke , the lines and groups of working - men in every sort of working dress , the occasional rumbling of huge waggons past the window , the click of glasses and cups in the refreshment bar outside , and this stir of spiritual passion which any competent observer might have felt sweeping through the little crowd as Robert spoke , connecting what was passing there with all that is sacred and beautiful in the history of the world . After another silence a young fellow , in a shabby velvet coat , stood up . He was commonly known among his fellow - potters as '
313542	313624	313539	313540	the hartist	7682	' because of his long hair , his little affectations of dress , and his æsthetic susceptibilities generally . The wits of the Club made him their target , but the teasing of him that went on was more or less tempered by the knowledge that in his own queer way he had brought up and educated two young sisters almost from infancy , and that his sweetheart had been killed before his eyes a year before in a railway accident .

He , on his side , informed her that on his way to Scotland he had bethought himself that he had never seen the Lakes , that he had stopped at Whinborough , was bent on walking over the High Fell pass to Ullswater , and making his way thence to Ambleside , Grasmere , and Keswick .

In London it had been so easy to stand on her dignity , to remember whenever he was friendly that the night before he had been distant . In these green solitudes it was not easy to be anything but natural — the child of the moment ! '

318095	318407	318078	318078	I	0	' They wandered on past the vicarage talking fast . Mr. Flaxman , who had been joined for a time , on his fishing tour , by Lord Waynflete , was giving her an amusing account of the susceptibility to titles shown by the primitive democrats of Norway . As they passed a gap in the vicarage hedge , laughing and chatting . Rose became aware of a window and a gray head hastily withdrawn . Mr. Flaxman was puzzled by the merry flash , instantly suppressed , that shot across her face . Presently they reached the hamlet of High Close , and the house where Mary Backhouse died , and where her father and the poor bedridden Jim still lived . They mounted the path behind it , and plunged into the hazel plantation which had sheltered Robert and Catherine on a memorable night . But when they were through it , Rose turned to the right along a scrambling path leading to the top of the first great shoulder of High Fell . It was a steep climb , though a short one , and it seemed to Rose that when she had once let him help her over a rock her hand was never her own again . He kept it an almost constant prisoner on one pretext or another till they were at the top . Then she sank down on a rock out of breath . He stood beside her , lifting his brown wideawake from his brow . The air below had been warm and relaxing . Here it played upon them both with a delicious life - giving freshness . He looked round on the great hollow bosom of the fell , the crags buttressing it on either hand , the winding greenness of the valley , the white sparkle of the river . '

I may scold her if she gives me occasion . And in six months , as one says to a publisher , " the agreement will be open to revision . " '

323037	323065	323026	323026	Robert	359	' A fantastic thing , the modern young woman ! Still I think I can understand . There may have been more than mere caprice in it . '
323074	323079	323081	323081	Flaxman	560	' I suppose so , '
323103	323145	323146	323146	Robert	359	' Never mind , old fellow , I am content . And , indeed , faute de mieux , I should be content with anything that brought me nearer to her , were it but by the thousandth of an inch . '
323152	323155	323156	323156	he	560	' Catherine , '
323162	323176	323156	323156	he	560	' never mind the supper ; let it burn . Flaxman brings news . '
323197	323204	323205	323205	she	9433	' Are we supposed to know ? '
323211	323219	323221	323221	Flaxman	560	' She never forbade me to tell , '
323224	323383	323221	323221	Flaxman	560	' I think , however , if I were you , I should say nothing about it — yet . I told her it was part of our bargain that she should explain my letters to Mrs. Leyburn . I gave her free leave to invent any fairy tale she pleased , but it was to be her invention , not mine . Neither Robert nor Catherine were very well pleased . But there was something reassuring as well as comic in the stoicism with which Flaxman took his position . And clearly the matter must be left to manage itself . Next morning the weather had improved . Robert , his hand on Flaxman 's arm , got down to the beach . Flaxman watched him critically , did not like some of his symptoms , but thought on the whole he must be recovering at the normal rate , considering how severe the attack had been . '
323391	323424	323386	323386	you	7907	' Catherine asked him next day , with all her soul in her eyes . They had left Robert established in a sunny nook , and were strolling on along the sands . '
323446	323450	323427	323427	you	7907	' said Flaxman . '
323458	323459	323427	323427	you	7907	' '
323467	323481	323427	323427	you	7907	' said Catherine , with a momentary despair in her fine pale face . '
323508	323812	323427	323427	you	7907	' Flaxman felt the truth of the remark during the four days of calm autumn weather he spent with them before the return journey . Robert would talk to him for hours , now on the sands , with the gray infinity of sea before them , now pacing the bounds of their little room till fatigue made him drop heavily into his long chair ; and the burden of it all was the religious future of the working - class . He described the scene in the Club , and brought out the dreams swarming in his mind , presenting them for Flaxman 's criticism , and dealing with them himself , with that startling mixture of acute common - sense and eloquent passion which had always made him so effective as an initiator . Flaxman listened dubiously at first , as he generally listened to Elsmere , and then was carried away , not by the beliefs , but by the man . He found his pleasure in dallying with the magnificent possibility of the Church ; doubt with him applied to all propositions , whether positive or negative ; and he had the dislike of the aristocrat and the cosmopolitan for the provincialisms of religious dissent . Political dissent or social reform was another matter . Since the Revolution , every generous child of the century has been open to the fascination of political or social Utopias . But religion ! What — what is truth ? Why not let the old things alone ? However , it was through the social passion , once so real in him , and still living , in spite of disillusion and self - mockery , that Robert caught him , had in fact been slowly gaining possession of him all these months .

323968	324153	324154	324154	He	7915	' was the flashing answer—'a new compelling force in man and in society . Can you deny that the world wants it ? What are you economists and sociologists of the new type always pining for ? Why , for that diminution of the self in man which is to enable the individual to see the world 's ends clearly , and to care not only for his own but for his neighbour 's interest , which is to make the rich devote themselves to the poor , and the poor bear with the rich . If man only would , he could , you say , solve all the problems which oppress him . It is man 's will which is eternally defective , eternally inadequate . Well , the great religions of the world are the stimulants by which the power at the root of things has worked upon this sluggish instrument of human destiny . Without religion you can not make the will equal to its tasks . Our present religion fails us ; we must , we will have another ! '

324555	324566	324553	324553	you	0	' he said quietly , after a moment 's pause ; '
324574	324614	324615	324615	I	0	' Again they strolled on , talking , plunging into details , till Flaxman 's pulse beat as fast as Robert 's ; so full of infectious hope and energy was the whole being of the man before him . '

324639	324964	324965	324967	that young lady	7924	' Then suddenly something struck the mobile mind , and he stood an instant looking at his companion . It was the first time he had mentioned Catherine 's name in connection with the North R — — work . Flaxman could not mistake the emotion , the unspoken thanks in those eyes . He turned away , nervously knocking off the ashes of his cigar . But the two men understood each other . Two days later they were in London again . Robert was a great deal better , and beginning to kick against invalid restraints . All men have their pet irrationalities . Elsmere 's irrationality was an aversion to doctors , from the point of view of his own ailments . He had an unbounded admiration for them as a class , and would have nothing to say to them as individuals that he could possibly help . Flaxman was sarcastic ; Catherine looked imploring in vain . He vowed that he was treating himself with a skill any professional might envy , and went his way . And for a time the stimulus of London and of his work seemed to act favourably upon him . After his first welcome at the Club he came home with bright eye and vigorous step , declaring that he was another man . Flaxman established himself in St. James 's Place . Town was deserted ; the partridges at Greenlaws clamoured to be shot ; the head - keeper wrote letters which would have melted the heart of a stone . Flaxman replied recklessly that any decent fellow in the neighbourhood was welcome to shoot his birds — a reply which almost brought upon him the resignation of the outraged keeper by return of post . Lady Charlotte wrote and remonstrated with him for neglecting a landowner 's duties , inquiring at the same time what he meant to do with regard to '
324969	325031	324965	324967	that young lady	7924	' To which Flaxman replied calmly that he had just come back from the Lakes , where he had done , not indeed all that he meant to do , but still something . Miss Leyburn and he were not engaged , but he was on probation for six months , and found London the best place for getting through it . '
325035	325039	324965	324967	that young lady	7924	' he said , '
325129	325133	325137	325137	he	560	' On probation ! '
325386	325392	325412	325412	Flaxman	560	' The New Brotherhood of Christ '
325624	326042	326469	326469	God	304	' And we go on prating that the age of saints is over , the rôle of the individual lessening day by day ! Fool ! go and be a saint , go and give yourself to ideas ; go and live the life hid with Christ in God , and see,'—so would run the quick comment of the observer . But incessant as was the reciprocity , the interchange and play of feeling between Robert and the wide following growing up around him , it was plain to Flaxman that although he never moved a step without carrying his world with him , he was never at the mercy of his world . Nothing was ever really left to chance . Through all these strange debates , which began rawly and clumsily enough , and grew every week more and more absorbing to all concerned , Flaxman was convinced that hardly any rule or formula of the new society was ultimately adopted which had not been for long in Robert 's mind — thought out and brought into final shape , perhaps , on the Petites Dalles sands . It was an unobtrusive art , his art of government , but a most effective one . At any moment , as Flaxman often felt , at any rate in the early meetings , the discussions as to the religious practices which were to bind together the new association might have passed the line , and become puerile or grotesque . At any moment the jarring characters and ambitions of the men Elsmere had to deal with might have dispersed that delicate atmosphere of moral sympathy and passion in which the whole new birth seemed to have been conceived , and upon the maintenance of which its fruition and development depended . But as soon as Elsmere appeared , difficulties vanished , enthusiasm sprang up again . The rules of the new society came simply and naturally into being , steeped and haloed , as it were , from the beginning , in the passion and genius of one great heart . The fastidious critical instinct in Flaxman was silenced no less than the sour , half - educated analysis of such a man as Lestrange . In the same way all personal jars seemed to melt away beside him . There were some painful things connected with the new departure . Wardlaw , for instance , a conscientious Comtist , refusing stoutly to admit anything more than '
326049	326467	326469	326469	God	304	' was distressed and affronted by the strongly religious bent Elsmere was giving to the work he had begun . Lestrange , who was a man of great though raw ability , who almost always spoke at the meetings , and whom Robert was bent on attaching to the society , had times when the things he was half inclined to worship one day he was much more inclined to burn the next in the sight of all men , and when the smallest failure of temper on Robert 's part might have entailed a disagreeable scene , and the possible formation of a harassing left wing . But Robert 's manner to Wardlaw was that of a grateful younger brother . It was clear that the Comtist could not formally join the Brotherhood . But all the share and influence that could be secured him in the practical working of it was secured him . And what was more , Robert succeeded in infusing his own delicacy , his own compunctions on the subject , into the men and youths who had profited in the past by Wardlaw 's rough self - devotion . So that if , through much that went on now , he could only be a spectator , at least he was not allowed to feel himself an alien or forgotten . As to Lestrange , against a man who was as ready to laugh as to preach , and into whose ardent soul nature had infused a saving sense of the whimsical in life and character , cynicism and vanity seemed to have no case . Robert 's quick temper had been wonderfully disciplined by life since his Oxford days . He had now very little of that stiff - neckedness , so fatal to the average reformer , which makes a man insist on all or nothing from his followers . He took what each man had to give . Nay , he made it almost seem as though the grudging support of Lestrange , or the critical half - patronising approval of the young barrister from the West who came down to listen to him , and made a favour of teaching in his night - school , were as precious to him as was the whole - hearted , the self - abandoning veneration , which the majority of those about him had begun to show towards the man in whom , as Charles Richards said , they had '
326471	326609	326469	326469	God	304	' At last by the middle of November the whole great building , with the exception of the top floor , was cleared and ready for use . Robert felt the same joy in it , in its clean paint , the half - filled shelves in the library , the pictures standing against the walls ready to be hung , the rolls of bright - coloured matting ready to be laid down , as he had felt in the Murewell Institute . He and Flaxman , helped by a voluntary army of men , worked at it from morning till night . Only Catherine could ever persuade him to remember that he was not yet physically himself . Then came the day when the building was formally opened , when the gilt letters over the door , '

For two hours a continuous stream of human beings surrounded the little table beside which Elsmere stood , inscribing their names , and receiving from him the silver badge , bearing the head of Christ , which was to be the outward and conspicuous sign of membership . Men came of all sorts : the intelligent well - paid artisan , the pallid clerk or small accountant , stalwart warehousemen , huge carters and draymen , the boy attached to each by the laws of the profession often straggling lumpishly behind his master . Women were there : wives who came because their lords came , or because Mr. Elsmere had been '

Flaxman stood and watched it from the side . It was an extraordinary scene : the crowd , the slight figure on the platform , the two great inscriptions , which represented the only '
326858	326871	326873	326873	Thee	7953	' of the new faith , gleaming from the freshly coloured walls — '

326948	326999	326946	326947	Charles Richards	772	' ) ; the copies of Giotto 's Paduan Virtues — faith , fortitude , charity , and the like — which broke the long wall at intervals .

327303	327458	327296	327296	Elsmere	359	' Since then the first religious service under the new constitution has been held . The service is extremely simple , and the basis of the whole is " new bottles for the new wine . " The opening prayer is recited by everybody present standing . It is rather an act of adoration and faith than a prayer , properly so called . It represents , in fact , the placing of the soul in the presence of God . The mortal turns to the eternal ; the ignorant and imperfect look away from themselves to the knowledge and perfection of the All - Holy . It is Elsmere 's drawing up , I imagine — at any rate it is essentially modern , expressing the modern spirit , answering to modern need , as I imagine the first Christian prayers expressed the spirit and answered to the need of an earlier day .

Whether he has got hold of the true Christ is another matter ; but that the Christ he preaches moves the human heart as much as — and in the case of the London artisan , more than — the current orthodox presentation of him , I begin to have ocular demonstration .

But there is something piercingly penetrating and austere even in the consolations of this new faith . He did but remind the children of the burden of gratitude laid upon them . " Would you let him suffer so much in vain ? His suffering has made you and me happier and better to - day , at this moment , than we could have been without Jesus . You will understand how , and why , more clearly when you grow up . Let us in return keep him in our hearts always , and obey his words ! It is all you can do for his sake , just as all you could do for a mother who died would be to follow her wishes and sacredly keep her memory . " '

There are only seven hymns in the little service book , gathered out of the finest we have . It is supposed that in a short time they will become so familiar to the members of the Brotherhood that they will be sung readily by heart . The singing of them in the public service alternates with an equal number of psalms . And both psalms and hymns are meant to be recited or sung constantly in the homes of the members , and to become part of the everyday life of the Brotherhood . They have been most carefully chosen , and a sort of ritual importance has been attached to them from the beginning . Each day in the week has its particular hymn or psalm . '

The amount of activity , social , educational , religious , of which this great building promises to be the centre is already astonishing . Everything , of course including the constitution of the infant society , is as yet purely tentative and experimental . But for a scheme so young , things are falling into working order with wonderful rapidity . Each department is worked by committees under the central council . Elsmere , of course , is ex - officio chairman of a large proportion ; Wardlaw , Mackay , I , and a few other fellows " run " the rest for the present . But each committee contains working - men ; and it is the object of everybody concerned to make the workman element more and more real and efficient . What with the " tax " on the members which was fixed by a general meeting , and the contributions from outside , the society already commands a fair income . But Elsmere is anxious not to attempt too much at once , and will go slowly and train his workers . '

No one to cheer him , no one to please him with his food — to put his cushions right — to coax him up a bit , and that — and his poor sister too , always there before his eyes . Of course he would stand to it he liked to be alone . But I 'll never believe men are made so unlike one to the other . The Almighty meant a man to have a wife or a child about him when he comes to the last . He missed you , sir , when you went away . Not that he 'd say a word , but he moped .

He crept away to his own room , his nerves still quivering with the terror of that sudden waking , the horror of that struggle . It was impossible to sleep . The moon was at the full outside . He drew back the curtains , made up the fire , and , wrapping himself in a fur coat which Flaxman had lately forced upon him , sat where he could see the moonlit park , and still be within the range of the blaze . As the excitement passed away a reaction of feverish weakness set in . The strangest whirlwind of thoughts fled through him in the darkness , suggested very often by the figures on the seventeenth - century tapestry which lined the walls . Were those the trees in the wood - path ? Surely that was Catherine 's figure , trailing — and that dome — strange ! Was he still walking in Grey 's funeral procession , the Oxford buildings looking sadly down ? Death here ! Death there ! Death everywhere , yawning under life from the beginning ! The veil which hides the common abyss , in sight of which men could not always hold themselves and live , is rent asunder , and he looks shuddering into it . Then the image changed , and in its stead , that old familiar image of the river of Death took possession of him . He stood himself on the brink ; on the other side were Grey and the squire . But he felt no pang of separation , of pain ; for he him self was just about to cross and join them ! And during a strange brief lull of feeling the mind harboured image and expectation alike with perfect calm . Then the fever - spell broke — the brain cleared — and he was terribly himself again . Whence came it — this fresh inexorable consciousness ? He tried to repel it , to forget himself , to cling blindly , without thought , to God 's love and Catherine 's . But the anguish mounted fast . On the one hand , this fast - growing certainty , urging and penetrating through every nerve and fibre of the shaken frame ; on the other , the ideal fabric of his efforts and his dreams , the New Jerusalem of a regenerate faith ; the poor , the loving , and the simple walking therein !

Outside , the river , just filmed with ice , shone under the moon ; over it bent the trees , laden with hoar - frost . Was that a heron , rising for an instant , beyond the bridge , in the unearthly blue ? And quietly — heavily — like an irrevocable sentence , there came , breathed to him as it were from that winter cold and loneliness , words that he had read an hour or two before , in the little red book beside his hand — words in which the gayest of French poets has fixed , as though by accident , the most tragic of all human cries — '

335731	336157	335524	335524	My	0	' There is little more to tell . The man who had lived so fast was no long time dying . The eager soul was swift in this as in all else . The day after Elsmere 's return from Murewell , where he left the squire still alive ( the telegram announcing the death reached Bedford Square a few hours after Robert 's arrival ) , Edmondson came up to see him and examine him . He discovered tubercular disease of the larynx , which begins with slight hoarseness and weakness , and develops into one of the most rapid forms of phthisis . In his opinion it had been originally set up by the effects of the chill at Petites Dalles acting upon a constitution never strong , and at that moment peculiarly susceptible to mischief . And of course the speaking and preaching of the last four months had done enormous harm . It was with great outward composure that Elsmere received his arrêt de mort at the hands of the young doctor , who announced the result of his examination with a hesitating lip and a voice which struggled in vain to preserve its professional calm . He knew too much of medicine himself to be deceived by Edmondson 's optimist remarks as to the possible effect of a warm climate like Algiers on his condition . He sat down , resting his head on his hands a moment ; then , wringing Edmondson 's hand , he went out feebly to find his wife . Catherine had been waiting in the dining - room , her whole soul one dry tense misery . She stood looking out of the window taking curious heed of a Jewish wedding that was going on in the square , of the preposterous bouquets of the coachman and the gaping circle of errand - boys . How pinched the bride looked in the north wind ! When the door opened and Catherine saw her husband come in — her young husband , to whom she had been married not yet four years — with that indescribable look in the eyes which seemed to divine and confirm all those terrors which had been shaking her during her agonised waiting , there followed a moment between them which words can not render . When it ended — that half - articulate convulsion of love and anguish — she found herself sitting on the sofa beside him , his head on her breast , his hand clasping hers . '
336167	336174	336175	336175	Her	8227	' he asked her gently,—'to Algiers ? '
336181	336186	336187	336187	he	0	' Then I will , '
336196	336205	336206	336206	he	0	' It will only prolong it two months , '
336209	336247	336206	336206	he	0	' and does one not owe it to the people for whom one has tried to live , to make a brave end among them ? Ah , no ! no ! those two months are hers ! '
336339	336349	336332	336332	Flaxman	560	' A bad case , you say — advanced ? '
336350	336355	336356	336356	Edmondson	846	' A bad case ! '
336360	336442	336356	336356	Edmondson	846	' He has been fighting against it too long under that absurd delusion of clergyman 's throat . If only men would not insist upon being their own doctors ! And , of course , that going down to Murewell the other day was madness . I shall go with him to Algiers , and probably stay a week or two . To think of that life , that career , cut short ! This is a queer sort of world ! '
336471	336478	336479	336479	she	8231	' You have seen Dr. Edmondson ? '
336503	336531	336496	336496	He	560	' Yes . He says he goes with you to Algiers . I will come after if you will have me . The climate may do wonders . '
336545	336559	336560	336560	He	560	' Will you go in to Robert ? He is in the study . '
336579	336587	336588	336588	he	560	' Don't — don't , old fellow , '
336598	336711	336588	336588	he	560	' It comes to all of us sooner or later . Whenever it comes we think it too soon . I believe I have been sure of it for some time . We are such strange creatures ! It has been so present to me lately that life was too good to last . You remember the sort of feeling one used to have as a child about some treat in the distance — that it was too much joy — that something was sure to come between you and it ? Well , in a sense , I have had my joy , the first - fruits of it at least . '
336754	336758	336759	336759	Robert	359	' How strange ! '

But we hope it will be possible to work them together . What a brick he is ! What a blessed chance it was that took me to that breakfast party at Flaxman 's ! '
337658	337672	337675	337675	they	8254	' Eh , Mister Elsmere , but it 's a fine place yur gawin '

Lestrange came in , with a pale sharp face , and said little in his ten minutes . But Robert divined in him a sort of repressed curiosity and excitement akin to that of Voltaire turning his feverish eyes towards le grand secret . '
337841	337901	337902	337902	I	0	' These were the sort of questions that seemed to underlie the man 's spoken words . There was something trying in it , but Robert did his best to put aside his consciousness of it . He thanked him for his help in the past , and implored him to stand by the young society and Mr. Edwardes . '
337925	337941	337917	337918	One soldier	8262	' The watchmaker rose , then paused a moment , a flush passing over him . '
337949	338137	337917	337918	One soldier	8262	' he said abruptly ; then , seeing Robert 's look of distress , he seemed to cast about for something reassuring to say , but could find nothing . Robert at last held out his hand with a smile , and he went . He left Elsmere struggling with a pang of horrible depression . In reality there was no man who worked harder at the New Brotherhood during the months that followed than Lestrange . He worked under perpetual protest from the frondeur within him , but something stung him on — on — till a habit had been formed which promises to be the joy and salvation of his later life . Was it the haunting memory of that thin figure — the hand clinging to the chair — the white appealing look ? Others came and went , till Catherine trembled for the consequences . She herself took in Mrs. Richards and her children , comforting the sobbing creatures afterwards with a calmness born of her own despair . Robson , in the last stage himself , sent him a grimly characteristic message . '
338193	338206	338186	338186	he	8266	' After it all Robert sank on the sofa with a groan . '
338210	338248	338186	338186	he	8266	' he said hoarsely—'no more ! Now for air — the sea ! To - morrow , wife , to - morrow ! Cras ingens iterabimus æquor . Ah me ! I leave my new Salamis behind ! '

338280	338314	338274	338274	he	1246	' And I will spare myself the sight of Newcome — I could not bear it , I think ! But I must say good - bye — for I love them both . '

338590	338606	338608	338608	Edmondson	846	' I have got rooms close by them in the Vice - Consul 's cottage , '
338610	338785	338608	338608	Edmondson	846	' Imagine , within sixty hours of leaving London in a January fog , finding yourself tramping over wild marigolds and mignonette , under a sky and through an air as balmy as those of an English June — when an English June behaves itself . Elsmere 's room overlooks the bay , the great plain of the Metidja dotted with villages , and the grand range of the Djurjura , backed by snowy summits one can hardly tell from the clouds . His spirits are marvellous . He is plunged in the history of Algiers , raving about one Fromentin , learning Spanish even ! The wonderful purity and warmth of the air seem to have relieved the larynx greatly . He breathes and speaks much more easily than when we left London . I sometimes feel when I look at him as though in this as in all else he were unlike the common sons of men — as though to him it might be possible to subdue even this fell disease . '
338790	338896	338608	338608	Edmondson	846	' " I had not heard the half"—O Flaxman ! An enchanted land — air , sun , warmth , roses , orange blossom , new potatoes , green peas , veiled Eastern beauties , domed mosques and preaching Mahdis — everything that feeds the outer and the inner man . To throw the window open at waking to the depth of sunlit air between us and the curve of the bay , is for the moment heaven ! One 's soul seems to escape one , to pour itself into the luminous blue of the morning . I am better — I breathe again . '
338959	339069	338942	338943	her mother	958	' As for Rose , she writes more letters than Clarissa , and receives more than an editor of the Times . I have the strongest views , as you know , as to the vanity of letter - writing . There was a time when you shared them , but there are circumstances and conjunctures , alas ! in which no man can be sure of his friend or his friend 's principles . Kind friend , good fellow , go often to Elgood Street . Tell me everything about everybody . It is possible , after all , that I may live to come back to them . '
339176	339183	339185	339185	Edmondson	846	' He is very depressed too , '
339187	339239	339185	339185	Edmondson	846	' I have never seen him so yet . He sits and looks at us in the evening sometimes with eyes that wring one 's heart . It is as though , after having for a moment allowed himself to hope , he found it a doubly hard task to submit . '
339426	339431	339423	339423	Edmondson	846	' wrung the heart . '

340023	340038	340013	340013	he	359	' would you leave me without comfort , without help , at the end ? '
340039	340045	340046	340046	she	2651	' Oh , my beloved ! '
340059	340085	340046	340046	she	2651	' if you would but stretch out your hand to the true comfort — the true help — the Lamb of God sacrificed for us ! '
340092	340155	340086	340086	He	359	' My weakness might yield — my true best self never . I know Whom I have believed . Oh , my darling , be content . Your misery , your prayers hold me back from God — from that truth and that trust which can alone be honestly mine . Submit , my wife ! Leave me in God 's hands . '
340346	340351	340352	340352	he	359	' He made it , '
340422	340542	340411	340411	He	359	' Flaxman arrived a few days afterwards . Edmondson had started for London the night before , leaving Elsmere better again , able to drive and even walk a little , and well looked after by a local doctor of ability . As Flaxman , tramping up behind his carriage , climbed the long hill to El Biar , he saw the whole marvellous place in a white light of beauty — the bay , the city , the mountains , oliveyard and orange - grove , drawn in pale tints on luminous air . Suddenly , at the entrance of a steep and narrow lane , he noticed a slight figure standing — a parasol against the sun . '
340558	340569	340545	340545	you	359	' said Rose 's voice , strangely demure and shy . '
340576	340775	340545	340545	you	359	' A grip of the hand , a word to the driver , and they were alone in the high - walled lane , which was really the old road up the hill , before the French brought zigzags and civilisation . She gave him news of Robert — better than he had expected . Under the influence of one of the natural reactions that wait on illness , the girl 's tone was cheerful , and Flaxman 's spirits rose . They talked of the splendour of the day , the discomforts of the steamer , the picturesqueness of the landing — of anything and everything but the hidden something which was responsible for the dancing brightness in his eyes , the occasional swift veiling of her own . Then , at an angle of the lane , where a little spring ran cool and brown into a moss - grown trough , where the blue broke joyously through the gray cloud of olive - wood , where not a sight or sound was to be heard of all the busy life which hides and nestles along the hill , he stopped , his hands seizing hers . '
340779	340799	340545	340545	you	359	' he said , flushing , his light overcoat falling back from his strong , well - made frame ; '
340808	341007	341008	341008	We	8312	' No more ! It was most natural , nay , inevitable . For the moment death stood aside and love asserted itself . But this is no place to chronicle what it said . And he had hardly asked , and she had hardly yielded , before the same misgiving , the same shrinking , seized on the lovers themselves . They sped up the hill , they crept into the house , far apart . It was agreed that neither of them should say a word . But , with that extraordinarily quick perception that sometimes goes with such a state as his , Elsmere had guessed the position of things before he and Flaxman had been half an hour together . He took a boyish pleasure in making his friend confess himself , and , when Flaxman left him , at once sent for Catherine and told her . Catherine , coming out afterwards , met Flaxman in the little tiled hall . How she had aged and blanched ! She stood a moment opposite to him , in her plain long dress with its white collar and cuffs , her face working a little . '
341013	341025	341032	341032	she	8314	' she said , but almost with a sob—'God bless you ! '
341204	341235	341198	341198	her	369	' You won't — you wo n't ever be angry with me for making you wait like that ? It was impertinent — it was like a child playing tricks ! '
341701	341708	341709	341709	he	560	' I have had a letter , '
341716	341989	341709	341709	he	560	' from a Broad Church clergyman in the Midlands , who imagines me to be still militant in London , protesting against the " absurd and wasteful isolation " of the New Brotherhood . He asks me why instead of leaving the Church I did not join the Church Reform Union , why I did not attempt to widen the Church from within , and why we in Elgood Street are not now in organic connection with the new Broad Church settlement in East London . I believe I have written him rather a sharp letter ; I could not help it . It was borne in on me to tell him that it is all owing to him and his brethren that we are in the muddle we are in to - day . Miracle is to our time what the law was to the early Christians . We must make up our minds about it one way or the other . And if we decide to throw it over as Paul threw over the law , then we must fight as he did . There is no help in subterfuge , no help in anything but a perfect sincerity . We must come out of it . The ground must be cleared ; then may come the re - building . Religion itself , the peace of generations to come , is at stake . If we could wait indefinitely while the Church widened , well and good . But we have but the one life , the one chance of saying the word or playing the part assigned us . '
342004	342141	341999	341999	he	8327	' I often lie here , Flaxman , wondering at the way in which men become the slaves of some metaphysical word — personality , or intelligence , or what not ! What meaning can they have as applied to God ? Herbert Spencer is quite right . We no sooner attempt to define what we mean by a Personal God than we lose ourselves in labyrinths of language and logic . But why attempt it at all ? I like that French saying , " Quand on me demande ce que c'est que Dieu , je l'ignore ; quand on ne me le demande pas , je le sais très - bien ! " No , we can not realise Him in words — we can only live in Him , and die to Him ! '
342167	342217	342146	342146	he	8327	' How selfish one is , always — when one least thinks it ! How could I have forgotten him so completely as I did during all that New Brotherhood time ? Where , what is he now ? Ah ! if somewhere , somehow , one could — — '
342482	342485	342486	342486	she	8334	' Master ! '
342491	342517	342486	342486	she	8334	' I can not leave him ! Call me not ! My life is here . I have no heart — it beats in his . '
342639	342655	342660	342660	he	359	' The child 's cry!—thank God ! Oh ! Meyrick — Catherine — thank God ! '
