4133	4139	4123	4123	He	121	" John Bold , Surgeon , "
5467	5471	5472	5472	he	577	" My dear , "
5485	5509	5472	5472	he	577	" there was that John Bold at your father 's again to - day . I must say your father is very imprudent . "
5510	5519	5521	5522	Mrs. Grantly	129	" He is imprudent — he always was , "
5531	5539	5521	5522	Mrs. Grantly	129	" There 's nothing new in that . "
5540	5597	5521	5522	Mrs. Grantly	129	" No , my dear , there 's nothing new — I know that ; but , at the present juncture of affairs , such imprudence is — is — I'll tell you what , my dear , if he does not take care what he 's about , John Bold will be off with Eleanor . "
5598	5615	5521	5522	Mrs. Grantly	129	" I think he will , whether papa takes care or no ; and why not ? "
5616	5620	5623	5624	the archdeacon	382	" Why not ! "
5643	5683	5623	5624	the archdeacon	382	" why not!—that pestilent , interfering upstart , John Bold — the most vulgar young person I ever met ! Do you know that he is meddling with your father 's affairs in a most uncalled for — most — "
5704	5708	5695	5695	he	382	" Good heavens ! "
5736	5744	5695	5695	he	382	" As to his vulgarity , archdeacon , "
5763	5831	5833	5834	the lady	612	" I do n't agree with you . Not that I like Mr. Bold — he is a great deal too conceited for me ; but then Eleanor does , and it would be the best thing in the world for papa if they were to marry . Bold would never trouble himself about Hiram 's Hospital if he were papa 's son - in - law . "
5880	5884	5886	5887	the doctor	613	" Good heavens ! "
6214	6236	6241	6241	he	626	" They are church revenues : the laity admit it . Surely the church is able to administer her own revenues . "
6548	6552	6554	6554	he	106	" Good heavens ! "
7289	7303	7305	7305	Bold	121	" And who is competent to give you that authority , Mr. Chadwick ? "
7307	7317	7319	7320	the steward	350	" Only those who employ me , Mr. Bold , "
7322	7331	7333	7333	Bold	121	" And who are those , Mr. Chadwick ? "
7588	7612	7577	7577	Cummins	133	" Slap at them at once , Mr. Bold ; demand categorically and explicitly a full statement of the affairs of the hospital . "
7613	7623	7625	7625	Bold	122	" Suppose I were to see Mr. Harding first , "
7627	7636	7638	7640	the acquiescing Finney	700	" Yes , yes , by all means , "
7642	7687	7638	7640	the acquiescing Finney	700	" though , perhaps , as Mr. Harding is no man of business , it may lead — lead to some little difficulties ; but perhaps you 're right . Mr. Bold , I do n't think seeing Mr. Harding can do any harm . "
8438	8455	8456	8456	he	136	" Well , well , Mr. Harding ; you 're too good , much too good , "
8760	8774	8776	8776	Bold	122	" Pray , Mr. Harding ; pray do n't let me disturb you , "
8778	8789	8776	8776	Bold	122	" you know how fond I am of sacred music . "
8790	8797	8799	8800	the precentor	441	" Oh ! it 's nothing , "
8844	8887	8833	8833	I	0	" Well , I 'll just finish it then ; it 's a favourite little bit of Bishop 's ; and then , Mr. Bold , we 'll have a stroll and a chat till Eleanor comes in and gives us tea . "
9009	9014	9016	9016	he	122	" One evening call , "
9018	9062	9016	9016	he	122	" is worth ten in the morning . It 's all formality in the morning ; real social talk never begins till after dinner . That 's why I dine early , so as to get as much as I can of it . "
9063	9070	9072	9073	the other	762	" Quite true , Mr. Harding , "
9075	9115	9072	9073	the other	762	" but I fear I 've reversed the order of things , and I owe you much apology for troubling you on business at such an hour ; but it is on business that I have called just now . "
9160	9171	9173	9173	Bold	122	" I wish to speak to you about the hospital , "
9175	9191	9173	9173	Bold	122	" Well , well , anything I can tell you I shall be most happy — "
9192	9199	9072	9073	the other	762	" It 's about the accounts . "
9200	9265	9173	9173	Bold	122	" Then , my dear fellow , I can tell you nothing , for I 'm as ignorant as a child . All I know is , that they pay me 800 l. a year . Go to Chadwick , he knows all about the accounts ; and now tell me , will poor Mary Jones ever get the use of her limb again ? "
9266	9303	9173	9173	Bold	122	" Well , I think she will , if she 's careful ; but , Mr. Harding , I hope you wo n't object to discuss with me what I have to say about the hospital . "
9365	9377	9379	9379	Bold	121	" I have the greatest regard for you , Mr. Harding , "
9381	9390	9379	9379	Bold	121	" the truest respect , the most sincere — "
9391	9401	9403	9404	the precentor	441	" Thank ye , thank ye , Mr. Bold , "
9408	9436	9403	9404	the precentor	441	" I 'm much obliged , but never mind that ; I 'm as likely to be in the wrong as another man — quite as likely . "
9437	9466	9379	9379	Bold	121	" But , Mr. Harding , I must express what I feel , lest you should think there is personal enmity in what I 'm going to do . "
9467	9493	9403	9404	the precentor	441	" Personal enmity ! Going to do ! Why you 're not going to cut my throat , nor put me into the Ecclesiastical Court — "
9558	9582	9584	9586	the young man	763	" I fear there is reason to think that John Hiram 's will is not carried out to the letter , Mr. Harding , "
9590	9601	9584	9586	the young man	763	" and I have been asked to see into it . "
9602	9624	9532	9532	he	121	" Very well , I 've no objection on earth ; and now we need not say another word about it . "
9625	9684	9584	9586	the young man	763	" Only one word more , Mr. Harding . Chadwick has referred me to Cox and Cummins , and I think it my duty to apply to them for some statement about the hospital . In what I do I may appear to be interfering with you , and I hope you will forgive me for doing so . "
9685	9689	9691	9692	the other	762	" Mr. Bold , "
9702	9857	9691	9692	the other	762	" if you act justly , say nothing in this matter but the truth , and use no unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes , I shall have nothing to forgive . I presume you think I am not entitled to the income I receive from the hospital , and that others are entitled to it . Whatever some may do , I shall never attribute to you base motives because you hold an opinion opposed to my own , and adverse to my interests : pray do what you consider to be your duty ; I can give you no assistance , neither will I offer you any obstacle . Let me , however , suggest to you , that you can in no wise forward you views nor I mine , by any discussion between us . Here comes Eleanor and the ponies , and we 'll go in to tea . "
11363	11370	11371	11371	he	260	" Refer him to the archdeacon , "
11384	11395	11396	11396	he	260	" The archdeacon will set you quite right about that , "
11413	11427	11396	11396	he	260	" No man has got up all that so well as the archdeacon ; "
11451	11455	11457	11457	you	845	" said he , "
11465	11522	11457	11457	you	845	" The bishop thought probably he had , thirty - five years ago , when first instituted to his see , but could not state positively : however , he very well knew that he had the absolute right to present to the wardenship , and that the income of the warden had been regularly settled . "
11572	11760	11761	11761	Bishop	137	" The bishop had an indistinct idea that they altered themselves by the lapse of years ; that a kind of ecclesiastical statute of limitation barred the rights of the twelve bedesmen to any increase of income arising from the increased value of property . He said something about tradition ; more of the many learned men who by their practice had confirmed the present arrangement ; then went at some length into the propriety of maintaining the due difference in rank and income between a beneficed clergyman , and certain poor old men who were dependent on charity ; and concluded his argument by another reference to the archdeacon . The precentor sat thoughtfully gazing at the fire , and listening to the good - natured reasoning of his friend . What the bishop said had a sort of comfort in it , but it was not a sustaining comfort . It made Mr. Harding feel that many others — indeed , all others of his own order — would think him right ; but it failed to prove to him that he truly was so . "
11763	11779	11761	11761	Bishop	137	" said he , at last , after both had sat silent for a while , "
11836	11971	11829	11829	I	0	" The two men were sitting near each other — so near , that the bishop was able to lay his hand upon the other 's knee , and he did so with a gentle pressure . Mr. Harding well knew what that pressure meant . The bishop had no further argument to adduce ; he could not fight for the cause as his son would do ; he could not prove all the precentor 's doubts to be groundless ; but he could sympathise with his friend , and he did so ; and Mr. Harding felt that he had received that for which he came . There was another period of silence , after which , the bishop asked with a degree of irritable energy , very unusual with him , whether this "
11974	12053	12054	12054	He	849	" ( meaning John Bold ) had any friends in Barchester . Mr. Harding had fully made up his mind to tell the bishop everything ; to speak of his daughter 's love , as well as his own troubles ; to talk of John Bold in his double capacity of future son - in - law and present enemy ; and though he felt it to be sufficiently disagreeable , now was his time to do it . "
12065	12137	12054	12054	He	849	" The bishop stared ; he was not so far gone in orthodoxy and church - military as his son , but still he could not bring himself to understand how so declared an enemy of the establishment could be admitted on terms of intimacy into the house , not only of so firm a pillar as Mr. Harding , but one so much injured as the warden of the hospital . "
12148	12154	12140	12140	I	0	" continued the disinterested victim ; "
12164	12174	12054	12054	He	849	" — he hesitated as he brought out the dreadful tidings,—"I
12193	12412	12054	12054	He	849	" The bishop did not whistle ; we believe that they lose the power of doing so on being consecrated ; and that in these days one might as easily meet a corrupt judge as a whistling bishop ; but he looked as though he would have done so , but for his apron . What a brother - in - law for the archdeacon ! what an alliance for Barchester close ! what a connexion for even the episcopal palace ! The bishop , in his simple mind , felt no doubt that John Bold , had he so much power , would shut up all cathedrals , and probably all parish churches ; distribute all tithes among Methodists , Baptists , and other savage tribes ; utterly annihilate the sacred bench , and make shovel hats and lawn sleeves as illegal as cowls , sandals , and sackcloth ! Here was a nice man to be initiated into the comfortable arcana of ecclesiastical snuggeries ; one who doubted the integrity of parsons , and probably disbelieved the Trinity ! Mr. Harding saw what an effect his communication had made , and almost repented the openness of his disclosure ; he , however , did what he could to moderate the grief of his friend and patron . "
12480	12481	12484	12484	Harding	102	" "
12486	12491	12484	12484	Harding	102	" said the bishop , "
12509	12510	12511	12511	I	0	" "
12545	12546	12542	12542	I	0	" "
12583	12936	12577	12577	he	382	" Mr. Harding reminded the bishop that the archdeacon and the reformer were not yet brothers , and very probably never would be ; exacted from him a promise that Eleanor 's name should not be mentioned in any discussion between the father bishop and son archdeacon respecting the hospital ; and then took his departure , leaving his poor old friend bewildered , amazed , and confounded . The parties most interested in the movement which is about to set Barchester by the ears , were not the foremost to discuss the merit of the question , as is often the case ; but when the bishop , the archdeacon , the warden , the steward , and Messrs. Cox and Cummins , were all busy with the matter , each in his own way , it is not to be supposed that Hiram 's bedesmen themselves were altogether passive spectators . Finney , the attorney , had been among them , asking sly questions , and raising immoderate hopes , creating a party hostile to the warden , and establishing a corps in the enemy 's camp , as he figuratively calls it to himself . Poor old men ; whoever may be righted or wronged by this inquiry , they at any rate will assuredly be only injured ; to them it can only be an unmixed evil . How can their lot be improved ? all their wants are supplied ; every comfort is administered ; they have warm houses , good clothes , plentiful diet , and rest after a life of labour ; and above all , that treasure so inestimable in declining years , a true and kind friend to listen to their sorrows , watch over their sickness , and administer comfort as regards this world , and the world to come ! John Bold sometimes thinks of this , when he is talking loudly of the rights of the bedesmen , whom he has taken under his protection ; but he quiets the suggestion within his breast with the high - sounding name of justice—"fiat
12942	13010	12577	12577	he	382	" These old men should , by rights , have one hundred pounds a year instead of one shilling and sixpence a day , and the warden should have two hundred or three hundred pounds instead of eight hundred pounds . What is unjust must be wrong ; what is wrong should be righted ; and if he declined the task , who else would do it ? "
13028	13447	12577	12577	he	382	" such had been the important whisper made by Finney into the ears of Abel Handy , and by him retailed to his eleven brethren . Too much must not be expected from the flesh and blood even of John Hiram 's bedesmen , and the positive promise of one hundred a year to each of the twelve old men , had its way with most of them . The great Bunce was not to be wiled away , and was upheld in his orthodoxy by two adherents . Abel Handy , who was the leader of the aspirants after wealth , had , alas , a stronger following . No less than five of the twelve soon believed that his views were just , making with their leader a moiety of the hospital . The other three , volatile unstable minds , vacillated between the two chieftains , now led away by the hope of gold , now anxious to propitiate the powers that still existed . It had been proposed to address a petition to the bishop as visiter , praying his lordship to see justice done to the legal recipients of John Hiram 's Charity , and to send copies of this petition and of the reply it would elicit , to all the leading London papers , and thereby to obtain notoriety for the subject . This it was thought would pave the way for ulterior legal proceedings . It would have been a great thing to have had the signatures and marks of all the twelve injured legatees ; but this was impossible : Bunce would have cut his hand off sooner than have signed it . It was then suggested by Finney that if even eleven could be induced to sanction the document , the one obstinate recusant might have been represented as unfit to judge on such a question,—in fact , as being non compos mentis , — and the petition would have been taken as representing the feeling of the men . But this could not be done : Bunce 's friends were as firm as himself , and as yet only six crosses adorned the document . It was the more provoking , as Bunce himself could write his name legibly , and one of those three doubting souls had for years boasted of like power , and possessed , indeed , a Bible , in which he was proud to show his name written by himself some thirty years ago—"Job
13450	13740	12577	12577	he	382	" but it was thought that Job Skulpit , having forgotten his scholarship , on that account recoiled from the petition , and that the other doubters would follow as he led them . A petition signed by half the hospital would have but a poor effect . It was in Skulpit 's room that the petition was now lying , waiting such additional signatures as Abel Handy , by his eloquence , could obtain for it . The six marks it bore were duly attested , thus : — Abel his + mark Handy , Greg y his + mark Moody , Mathew his + mark Spriggs , & c. , and places were duly designated in pencil for those brethren who were now expected to join : for Skulpit alone was left a spot on which his genuine signature might be written in fair clerklike style . Handy had brought in the document , and spread it out on the small deal table , and was now standing by it persuasive and eager . Moody had followed with an inkhorn , carefully left behind by Finney ; and Spriggs bore aloft , as though it were a sword , a well - worn ink - black pen , which from time to time he endeavoured to thrust into Skulpit 's unwilling hand . With the learned man were his two abettors in indecision , William Gazy and Jonathan Crumple . If ever the petition were to be forwarded , now was the time , so said Mr. Finney ; and great was the anxiety on the part of those whose one hundred pounds a year , as they believed , mainly depended on the document in question . "
13750	13762	13764	13766	an old fool	865	" as the avaricious Moody had muttered to his friend Handy , "
13779	13780	13769	13769	he	865	" "
13784	13811	13769	13769	he	865	" said Handy , trying to impart to his own sour , ill - omened visage a smile of approbation , in which he greatly failed ; "
13828	13842	13818	13819	Mr. Finney	131	see,"—and he put his huge brown finger down on the dirty paper , — "
13882	13883	13879	13879	my	0	" "
13888	13892	13893	13893	we	869	" said Moody ; "
13912	13958	13907	13908	old Catgut	148	" It was thus these miscreants named our excellent friend : the nickname he could easily have forgiven , but the allusion to the divine source of all his melodious joy would have irritated even him . Let us hope he never knew the insult . "
13966	14026	13962	13964	old Billy Gazy	146	" said Spriggs , who rejoiced in greater youth than his brethren , but having fallen into a fire when drunk , had had one eye burnt out , one cheek burnt through , and one arm nearly burnt off , and who , therefore , in regard to personal appearance , was not the most prepossessing of men ; "
14044	14117	14040	14042	old Billy Gazy	146	" and he gave a hideous grin that showed off his misfortunes to their full extent . Old Billy Gazy was not alive to much enthusiasm — even these golden prospects did not arouse him to do more than rub his poor old bleared eyes with the cuff of his bedesman 's gown , and gently mutter ; ' he did n't know , not he ; he did n't know . ' "
14125	14230	14123	14123	Jonathan	147	" continued Spriggs , turning to the other friend of Skulpit 's , who was sitting on a stool by the table , gazing vacantly at the petition . Jonathan Crumple was a meek , mild man , who had known better days ; his means had been wasted by bad children , who had made his life wretched till he had been received into the hospital , of which he had not long been a member . Since that day he had known neither sorrow nor trouble , and this attempt to fill him with new hopes was , indeed , a cruelty . "
14246	14250	14243	14244	neighbour Spriggs	145	" said he : "
14268	14291	14243	14244	neighbour Spriggs	145	" And he gave a low sigh , as he thought of the children of his own loins who had robbed him . "
14299	14303	14297	14297	Joe	120	" said Handy ; "
14320	14355	14307	14308	some one	872	" Crumple sighed again — he had learned the impotency of worldly wealth , and would have been satisfied , if left untempted , to have remained happy with one and sixpence a day . "
14360	14367	14358	14358	Skulpit	141	" repeated Handy , getting impatient , "
14399	14409	14412	14413	a man	545	" he added , seeing that Skulpit still doubted , "
14434	14435	14443	14443	I	0	" "
14445	14449	14443	14443	I	0	" growled Moody ; "
14468	14469	14460	14460	they	878	" "
14478	14482	14492	14492	they	877	" argued Spriggs : "
14517	14537	14512	14512	Calves	149	" I am sorry to say the archdeacon himself was designated by this scurrilous allusion to his nether person . "
14550	14554	14512	14512	Calves	149	" continued Handy , "
14608	14639	14591	14592	some men	881	" Oh , Mr. Harding , if you had but taken the archdeacon 's advice in that disputed case , when Joe Mutters was this ungrateful demagogue 's rival candidate ! "
14645	14656	14657	14657	I	0	" growled Moody , with a look of ineffable scorn ; "
14704	14705	14692	14692	I	0	" "
14708	14714	14715	14716	Mr. Harding	102	" said Skulpit , apologetically , "
14735	14736	14732	14732	he	102	" "
14741	14757	14732	14732	he	102	" exclaimed Spriggs with scorn , opening awfully the red cavern of his lost eye . "
14762	14769	14732	14732	he	102	" muttered Moody with a curse ; "
14774	14775	14732	14732	he	102	" "
14780	14784	14786	14786	I	0	" exclaimed Handy ; "
14856	14868	14834	14834	I	0	" Skulpit looked round in wretched indecision to his two friends . "
14876	14922	14873	14874	Billy Gazy	146	" said he . But Billy Gazy could n't think : he made a noise like the bleating of an old sheep , which was intended to express the agony of his doubt , and again muttered that ' he did ' nt know . ' "
14930	14943	14926	14926	you	141	" said Handy , thrusting the pen into poor Billy 's hand : "
14981	14997	14968	14968	you,—that	891	" and a big blotch of ink was presumed to represent Billy Gazy 's acquiescence . "
15001	15009	14999	14999	Jonathan	147	" said Handy , turning to Crumple . "
15022	15027	15020	15020	sartain	871	" again argued Crumple . "
15039	15040	15044	15044	yourself	141	" "
15046	15050	15052	15052	yourself	141	" said Skulpit ; "
15060	15094	15055	15055	you	141	" The pen was thrust into Crumple 's hand , and a faint , wandering , meaningless sign was made , betokening such sanction and authority as Jonathan Crumple was able to convey . "
15098	15106	15096	15096	Joe	120	" said Handy , softened by success , "
15165	15185	15162	15162	he	136	" Skulpit held the pen , and made little flourishes with it in the air , but still hesitated . "
15195	15199	15188	15188	you	120	" continued Handy , "
15219	15227	15248	15248	you	120	others,"—the cloud began to clear from Skulpit 's brow:—"we
15251	15252	15240	15240	you	120	" "
15261	15265	15240	15240	you	120	" said Skulpit : "
15281	15282	15248	15248	you	120	" "
15289	15293	15248	15248	you	120	" said Handy ; "
15298	15320	15248	15248	you	120	" and stooping over the petition , the learned clerk made a huge cross on the place left for his signature . "
15326	15335	15248	15248	you	120	" said Handy , triumphantly pocketing the petition ; "
15365	15396	15362	15362	they	901	" But as he was hobbling off to the door , with a crutch on one side and a stick on the other , he was met by Bunce himself . "
15408	15442	15404	15405	old Bunce	136	" said the grey - haired , upright senior . Handy muttered something , and was departing ; but he was stopped in the doorway by the huge frame of the new comer . "
15454	15458	15451	15452	Abel Handy	119	" said he , "
15481	15482	15473	15473	I	0	" "
15492	15497	15489	15490	Master Bunce	136	" muttered the other , "
15530	15531	15532	15532	I	0	" "
15538	15547	15532	15532	I	0	" continued Bunce , not noticing his opponent , "
15567	15582	15557	15557	your	120	" Skulpit looked as though he were about to sink into nothing with shame . "
15592	15596	15557	15557	your	120	" said Handy . "
15652	15653	15654	15654	I	0	" "
15667	15680	15657	15658	Job Skulpit	141	" said Bunce , looking at the man of whom he spoke , "
15751	15752	15754	15754	you	0	" "
15760	15764	15766	15766	you	0	" said Skulpit ; "
15776	15777	15785	15785	him	141	" "
15789	15803	15779	15779	I	0	" continued Bunce , looking at the one man and addressing the other ; "
15896	15908	15953	15953	you	912	it?"—and he pointed to Billy Gazy , Spriggs , and Crumple . "
15963	15976	15961	15961	he	141	his?"—and the orator pointed to the side on which the warden lived . "
16017	16018	16019	16019	We	913	" "
16027	16031	16032	16032	we	913	" said Handy ; "
16065	16066	16060	16060	we	913	" "
16069	16081	16060	16060	we	913	" said Bunce , with all the scorn he knew how to command,—"law
16141	16142	16139	16139	he	920	" "
16168	16633	16166	16166	he	920	" asked Handy : and laughing at the severity of his own wit , he and his colleagues retired , carrying with them , however , the now powerful petition . There is no help for spilt milk ; and Mr. Bunce could only retire to his own room , disgusted at the frailty of human nature — Job Skulpit scratched his head — Jonathan Crumple again remarked , that , ' for sartain , sure a hundred a year was very nice ' — and Billy Gazy again rubbed his eyes , and lowly muttered that ' he did n't know . ' Though doubt and hesitation disturbed the rest of our poor warden , no such weakness perplexed the nobler breast of his son - in - law . As the indomitable cock preparing for the combat sharpens his spurs , shakes his feathers , and erects his comb , so did the archdeacon arrange his weapons for the coming war , without misgiving and without fear . That he was fully confident of the justice of his cause let no one doubt . Many a man can fight his battle with good courage , but with a doubting conscience ; such was not the case with Dr. Grantly . He did not believe in the Gospel with more assurance than he did in the sacred justice of all ecclesiastical revenues . When he put his shoulder to the wheel to defend the income of the present and future precentors of Barchester , he was animated by as strong a sense of a holy cause , as that which gives courage to a missionary in Africa , or enables a sister of mercy to give up the pleasures of the world for the wards of a hospital . He was about to defend the holy of holies from the touch of the profane ; to guard the citadel of his church from the most rampant of its enemies ; to put on his good armour in the best of fights ; and secure , if possible , the comforts of his creed for coming generations of ecclesiastical dignitaries . Such a work required no ordinary vigour ; and the archdeacon was , therefore , extraordinarily vigorous : it demanded a buoyant courage , and a heart happy in its toil ; and the archdeacon 's heart was happy , and his courage was buoyant . He knew that he would not be able to animate his father - in - law with feelings like his own , but this did not much disturb him . He preferred to bear the brunt of the battle alone , and did not doubt that the warden would resign himself into his hands with passive submission . "
16639	16666	16166	16166	he	920	" he said , walking into the steward 's office a day or two after the signing of the petition as commemorated in the last chapter ; "
16675	16757	16762	16762	them	922	" Mr. Chadwick handed him a letter , which he read , stroking the tight - gaitered calf of his right leg as he did so . Messrs. Cox and Cummins merely said that they had as yet received no notice from their adversaries ; that they could recommend no preliminary steps ; but that should any proceeding really be taken by the bedesmen , it would be expedient to consult that very eminent Queen 's Counsel , Sir Abraham Haphazard . "
16764	16773	16774	16774	I	0	" said Dr. Grantly , refolding the letter . "
16821	16827	16832	16832	he	151	" Mr. Chadwick quite agreed . "
16859	16878	16879	16880	the earl	931	" Since the question of St. Cross had been mooted by the public , one noble lord had become "
16882	16892	16894	16894	he	151	" par excellence , in the doctor 's estimation . "
16935	17401	16928	16930	the other party	934	" With all his admiration for Sir Abraham , the doctor seemed to think it not impossible that that great man might be induced to lend his gigantic powers to the side of the church 's enemies . Having settled this point to his satisfaction , the doctor stepped down to the hospital , to learn how matters were going on there ; and as he walked across the hallowed close , and looked up at the ravens who cawed with a peculiar reverence as he wended his way , he thought with increased acerbity of those whose impiety would venture to disturb the goodly grace of cathedral institutions . And who has not felt the same ? We believe that Mr. Horseman himself would relent , and the spirit of Sir Benjamin Hall give way , were those great reformers to allow themselves to stroll by moonlight round the towers of some of our ancient churches . Who would not feel charity for a prebendary , when walking the quiet length of that long aisle at Winchester , looking at those decent houses , that trim grassplat , and feeling , as one must , the solemn , orderly comfort of the spot ? Who could be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet close of Hereford , and owning that in that precinct , tone and colour , design and form , solemn tower and storied window , are all in unison , and all perfect ? Who could lie basking in the cloisters of Salisbury , and gaze on Jewel 's library , and that unequalled spire , without feeling that bishops should sometimes be rich ? The tone of our archdeacon 's mind must not astonish us ; it has been the growth of centuries of church ascendancy ; and though some fungi now disfigure the tree , though there be much dead wood , for how much good fruit have not we to be thankful ? Who , without remorse , can batter down the dead branches of an old oak , now useless , but , ah ! still so beautiful , or drag out the fragments of the ancient forest , without feeling that they sheltered the younger plants , to which they are now summoned to give way in a tone so peremptory and so harsh ? The archdeacon , with all his virtues , was not a man of delicate feeling ; and after having made his morning salutations in the warden 's drawing - room , he did not scruple to commence an attack on ' pestilent ' John Bold in the presence of Miss Harding , though he rightly guessed that that lady was not indifferent to the name of his enemy . "
17416	17505	17402	17402	Nelly	104	" said her father , anxious to save both her blushes and her feelings . Eleanor brought the spectacles , while her father was trying , in ambiguous phrases , to explain to her too - practical brother - in - law that it might be as well not to say anything about Bold before her , and then retreated . Nothing had been explained to her about Bold and the hospital ; but , with a woman 's instinct , she knew that things were going wrong . "
17513	17550	17506	17506	We	937	" commenced the archdeacon , wiping his brows with a large , bright - coloured handkerchief ; for he had felt busy , and had walked quick , and it was a broiling summer 's day . "
17560	17575	17506	17506	We	937	" Mr. Harding owned , somewhat unwillingly , that he had heard of it . "
17576	17593	17594	17594	We	937	Well,"—the archdeacon looked for some expression of opinion , but none coming , he continued , — "
17622	17869	17870	17870	I	0	" The archdeacon , who was a practical man , allowed himself the use of every - day expressive modes of speech when among his closest intimates , though no one could soar into a more intricate labyrinth of refined phraseology when the church was the subject , and his lower brethren were his auditors . The warden still looked mutely in his face , making the slightest possible passes with an imaginary fiddle bow , and stopping , as he did so , sundry imaginary strings with the fingers of his other hand . ' T was his constant consolation in conversational troubles . While these vexed him sorely , the passes would be short and slow , and the upper hand would not be seen to work ; nay the strings on which it operated would sometimes lie concealed in the musician 's pocket , and the instrument on which he played would be beneath his chair ; but as his spirit warmed to the subject,—as his trusting heart , looking to the bottom of that which vexed him , would see its clear way out,—he would rise to a higher melody , sweep the unseen strings with a bolder hand , and swiftly fingering the cords from his neck , down along his waistcoat , and up again to his very ear , create an ecstatic strain of perfect music , audible to himself and to St. Cecilia , and not without effect . "
17878	17883	17870	17870	I	0	" continued the archdeacon : "
17910	17930	17931	17931	I	0	" The warden played the slowest and saddest of tunes : it was but a dirge on one string . "
17964	18003	17953	17954	Sir Abraham	151	" The warden thought of his income being thus discussed , his modest life , his daily habits , and his easy work ; and nothing issued from that single cord , but a low wail of sorrow . "
18016	18033	18006	18006	they	940	" The warden did n't know ; he imagined they would do so this very day . "
18080	18081	18074	18074	you	0	" "
18085	18090	18074	18074	you	0	" asked the warden . "
18125	18126	18117	18117	you	0	" "
18134	18139	18117	18117	you	0	" said the warden . "
18188	18189	18183	18183	I	0	" "
18199	18200	18197	18197	doctor	948	" "
18206	18234	18238	18238	they	940	" responded the archdeacon , in a loud brazen voice , as though all the men in the hospital were expected to hear him through the walls ; "
18271	18380	18258	18258	I	0	" The warden 's mind misgave him , and even for a moment he forgot to play . He by no means wished to delegate to his son - in - law his place and authority of warden ; he had expressly determined not to interfere in any step which the men might wish to take in the matter under dispute ; he was most anxious neither to accuse them nor to defend himself . All these things he was aware the archdeacon would do in his behalf , and that not in the mildest manner ; and yet he knew not how to refuse the permission requested . "
18392	18401	18381	18381	I	0	" said he , in an apologetic voice . "
18404	18416	18258	18258	I	0	" said the archdeacon , still speaking with his brazen trumpet ; "
18426	18427	18258	18258	I	0	" "
18439	18440	18443	18443	warden	304	" "
18479	18786	18470	18470	I	0	" Mr. Harding knew not how to resist , and the disagreeable order was given . The quad , as it was familiarly called , was a small quadrangle , open on one side to the river , and surrounded on the others by the high wall of Mr. Harding 's garden , by one gable end of Mr. Harding 's house , and by the end of the row of buildings which formed the residences of the bedesmen . It was flagged all round , and the centre was stoned ; small stone gutters ran from the four corners of the square to a grating in the centre ; and attached to the end of Mr. Harding 's house was a conduit with four cocks covered over from the weather , at which the old men got their water , and very generally performed their morning toilet . It was a quiet , sombre place , shaded over by the trees of the warden 's garden . On the side towards the river , there stood a row of stone seats , on which the old men would sit and gaze at the little fish , as they flitted by in the running stream . On the other side of the river was a rich , green meadow , running up to and joining the deanery , and as little open to the public , as the garden of the dean itself . Nothing , therefore , could be more private than the quad of the hospital ; and it was there that the archdeacon determined to convey to them his sense of their refractory proceedings . The servant soon brought in word that the men were assembled in the quad , and the archdeacon , big with his purpose , rose to address them . "
18797	18812	18789	18789	warden	304	" said he , seeing that Mr. Harding did not prepare to follow him . "
18820	18825	18815	18815	you	955	" said Mr. Harding . "
18841	18846	18848	18848	us	956	" replied the archdeacon : "
18879	19188	19190	19191	the doctor	613	" Mr. Harding was afraid ; he was afraid that he was being led to do that which was not his duty : he was not , however , strong enough to resist , so he got up and followed his son - in - law . The old men were assembled in groups in the quadrangle — eleven of them at least , for poor old Johnny Bell was bed - ridden , and could n't come ; he had , however , put his mark to the petition , as one of Handy 's earliest followers . ' T is true he could not move from the bed where he lay ; ' t is true he had no friend on earth , but those whom the hospital contained ; and of those the warden and his daughter were the most constant and most appreciated ; ' t is true that every thing was administered to him which his failing body could require , or which his faint appetite could enjoy ; but still his dull eye had glistened for a moment at the idea of possessing a hundred pounds a year ' to his own cheek , ' as Abel Handy had eloquently expressed it ; and poor old Johnny Bell had greedily put his mark to the petition . When the two clergymen appeared , they all uncovered their heads . Handy was slow to do it , and hesitated ; but the black coat and waistcoat , of which he had spoken so irreverently in Skulpit 's room , had its effect even on him , and he too doffed his hat . Bunce , advancing before the others , bowed lowly to the archdeacon , and with affectionate reverence expressed his wish , that the warden and Miss Eleanor were quite well ; "
19195	19204	19190	19191	the doctor	613	" he added , turning to the archdeacon , "
19215	19429	19212	19213	my lord	962	" and having made his speech , he also retired among the others , and took his place with the rest upon the stone benches . As the archdeacon stood up to make his speech , erect in the middle of that little square , he looked like an ecclesiastical statue placed there , as a fitting impersonation of the church militant here on earth ; his shovel hat , large , new , and well - pronounced , a churchman 's hat in every inch , declared the profession as plainly as does the Quaker 's broad brim ; his heavy eyebrow , large open eyes , and full mouth and chin expressed the solidity of his order ; the broad chest , amply covered with fine cloth , told how well to do was its estate ; one hand ensconced within his pocket , evinced the practical hold which our mother church keeps on her temporal possessions ; and the other , loose for action , was ready to fight if need be in her defence ; and below these the decorous breeches , and neat black gaiters showing so admirably that well - turned leg , betokened the decency , the outward beauty , and grace of our church establishment . "
19434	19448	19212	19213	my lord	962	" he began , when he had settled himself well in his position ; "
19545	19595	19619	19619	my	0	" Here the orator stopped for a moment , expecting that some little murmurs of applause would show that the weakest of the men were beginning to give way ; but no such murmurs came . Bunce , himself , even sat with closed lips , mute and unsatisfactory . "
19605	19609	19610	19610	I	0	" he repeated . "
19622	19645	19648	19648	we	971	" He paused for a reply from the men , and after a while , Handy plucked up courage , and said , "
19651	19652	19648	19648	we	971	" "
19689	19699	19670	19670	you	963	" Here most of the men expressed their assent . "
19723	19724	19711	19711	you	963	" "
19730	19747	19711	19711	you	963	" muttered old Moody , with a voice as if it came out of the ground . "
19753	19806	19711	19711	you	963	" ejaculated the archdeacon militant , defying the impudence of these claimants with one hand stretched out and closed , while with the other he tightly grasped , and secured within his breeches pocket , that symbol of the church 's wealth which his own loose half - crowns not unaptly represented . "
20077	20137	20061	20061	I	0	" Not a sound came from the eleven bedesmen , as they sat listening to what , according to the archdeacon , was their intended estate . They grimly stared upon his burly figure , but did not then express , by word or sign , the anger and disgust to which such language was sure to give rise . "
20144	20148	20150	20150	you	963	" he continued , "
20320	20321	20310	20311	the bishop	260	" "
20328	20351	20310	20311	the bishop	260	" interrupted Mr. Harding , who had been listening with indescribable misery to the tirade of his son - in - law ; "
20384	20385	20388	20388	you	0	" "
20393	20398	20390	20391	Mr. Harding	102	" said Bunce ; and "
20419	20486	20413	20413	you	0	" was exclaimed by enough of the men to make it appear that the sentiment was general . The archdeacon had been interrupted in his speech before he had quite finished it ; but he felt that he could not recommence with dignity after this little ebullition , and he led the way back into the garden , followed by his father - in - law . "
20489	20509	20512	20512	I	0	" said he , as soon as he found himself within the cool retreat of the warden 's garden ; "
20518	20555	20512	20512	I	0	" And he wiped the perspiration from his brow ; for making a speech under a broiling mid - day sun in summer , in a full suit of thick black cloth , is warm work . "
20563	20577	20558	20558	you	998	" replied the warden , in a tone which did not express approbation . "
20583	20596	20627	20627	I	0	" said the other , who was clearly well satisfied with himself ; "
20635	20656	20629	20629	they	997	" The warden agreed . He certainly thought they had understood to the full what had been said to them . "
20727	21664	20712	20712	I	0	" The warden 's mind was very full — full nearly to overcharging itself ; and had it done so — had he allowed himself to speak the thoughts which were working within him , he would indeed have astonished the archdeacon by the reprobation he would have expressed as to the proceeding of which he had been so unwilling a witness . But different feelings kept him silent ; he was as yet afraid of differing from his son - in - law — he was anxious beyond measure to avoid even a semblance of rupture with any of his order , and was painfully fearful of having to come to an open quarrel with any person on any subject . His life had hitherto been so quiet , so free from strife ; his little early troubles had required nothing but passive fortitude ; his subsequent prosperity had never forced upon him any active cares — had never brought him into disagreeable contact with any one . He felt that he would give almost anything — much more than he knew he ought to do — to relieve himself from the storm which he feared was coming . It was so hard that the pleasant waters of his little stream should be disturbed and muddied by rough hands ; that his quiet paths should be made a battle - field ; that the unobtrusive corner of the world which had been allotted to him , as though by Providence , should be invaded and desecrated , and all within it made miserable and unsound . Money he had none to give ; the knack of putting guineas together had never belonged to him ; but how willingly , with what a foolish easiness , with what happy alacrity , would he have abandoned the half of his income for all time to come , could he by so doing have quietly dispelled the clouds that were gathering over him — could he have thus compromised the matter between the reformer and the conservative , between his possible son - in - law , Bold , and his positive son - in - law , the archdeacon . And this compromise would not have been made from any prudential motive of saving what would yet remain , for Mr. Harding still felt little doubt but he should be left for life in quiet possession of the good things he had , if he chose to retain them . No ; he would have done so from the sheer love of quiet , and from a horror of being made the subject of public talk . He had very often been moved to pity — to that inward weeping of the heart for others ' woes ; but none had he ever pitied more than that old lord , whose almost fabulous wealth , drawn from his church preferments , had become the subject of so much opprobrium , of such public scorn ; that wretched clerical octogenarian Croesus , whom men would not allow to die in peace — whom all the world united to decry and to abhor . Was he to suffer such a fate ? Was his humble name to be bandied in men 's mouths , as the gormandizer of the resources of the poor , as of one who had filched from the charity of other ages wealth which had been intended to relieve the old and the infirm ? Was he to be gibbeted in the press , to become a byword for oppression , to be named as an example of the greed of the English church ? Should it ever be said that he had robbed those old men , whom he so truly and so tenderly loved in his heart of hearts ? As he slowly paced , hour after hour , under those noble lime - trees , turning these sad thoughts within him , he became all but fixed in his resolve that some great step must be taken to relieve him from the risk of so terrible a fate . In the meanwhile , the archdeacon , with contented mind and unruffled spirit , went about his business . He said a word or two to Mr. Chadwick , and then finding , as he expected , the petition lying in his father 's library , he wrote a short answer to the men , in which he told them that they had no evils to redress , but rather great mercies for which to be thankful ; and having seen the bishop sign it , he got into his brougham and returned home to Mrs. Grantly , and Plumstead Episcopi . After much painful doubting , on one thing only could Mr. Harding resolve . He determined that at any rate he would take no offence , and that he would make this question no cause of quarrel either with Bold or with the bedesmen . In furtherance of this resolution , he himself wrote a note to Mr. Bold , the same afternoon , inviting him to meet a few friends and hear some music on an evening named in the next week . Had not this little party been promised to Eleanor , in his present state of mind he would probably have avoided such gaiety ; but the promise had been given , the invitations were to be written , and when Eleanor consulted her father on the subject , she was not ill pleased to hear him say , "
21694	21871	21687	21687	you	1005	" Mary Bold was older than her brother , and , at the time of our story , was just over thirty . She was not an unattractive young woman , though by no means beautiful . Her great merit was the kindliness of her disposition . She was not very clever , nor very animated , nor had she apparently the energy of her brother ; but she was guided by a high principle of right and wrong ; her temper was sweet , and her faults were fewer in number than her virtues . Those who casually met Mary Bold thought little of her ; but those who knew her well loved her well , and the longer they knew her the more they loved her . Among those who were fondest of her was Eleanor Harding , and though Eleanor had never openly talked to her of her brother , each understood the other 's feelings about him . The brother and sister were sitting together when the two notes were brought in . "
21875	21879	21687	21687	you	1005	" said Mary , "
21902	22065	21687	21687	you	1005	" Her brother understood immediately the nature and intention of the peace offering ; but it was not so easy for him to behave well in the matter , as it was for Mr. Harding . It is much less difficult for the sufferer to be generous than for the oppressor . John Bold felt that he could not go to the warden 's party : he never loved Eleanor better than he did now ; he had never so strongly felt how anxious he was to make her his wife as now , when so many obstacles to his doing so appeared in view . Yet here was her father himself , as it were clearing away those very obstacles , and still he felt that he could not go to the house any more as an open friend . As he sat thinking of these things with the note in his hand , his sister was waiting for his decision . "
22068	22072	21687	21687	you	1005	" said she , "
22090	22091	22092	22092	You	0	" "
22101	22111	22099	22099	Mary	162	" said he ; to which she readily assented . "
22116	22125	22126	22126	I	0	" he continued , looking serious and gloomy ; "
22136	22137	22128	22128	I	0	" "
22144	22215	22142	22142	John	121	" said she . She had as yet heard nothing of the new - found abuse which her brother was about to reform ; at least , nothing which connected it with her brother 's name . He sat thinking for awhile till he determined that it would be best to tell her at once what it was that he was about : it must be done sooner or later . "
22237	22238	22223	22224	Mr. Harding	102	" "
22254	22255	22248	22248	you	121	" "
22260	22264	22248	22248	you	121	" said he ; "
22274	22275	22270	22270	her	104	" "
22282	22319	22280	22280	John	121	" said she , looking at him with an anxious , loving face ; for she knew well how much of his heart was there in that house which he said he could no longer enter . "
22322	22328	22329	22329	I	0	" said he at last , "
22372	22403	22357	22357	I	0	" Mary looked at him steadily for some time before she committed herself to reply , and then merely asked him what he meant to do for the old men . "
22472	22473	22475	22475	you	1013	" "
22488	22489	22475	22475	you	1013	" "
22568	22569	22552	22552	I	0	" "
22580	22581	22573	22573	you	1013	" "
22592	22596	22582	22582	You	1013	" said he ; "
22648	22663	22667	22668	no one	283	" And Bold began to comfort himself in the warmth of his own virtue . "
22703	22704	22700	22701	Mr. Harding	102	" "
22806	22807	22809	22809	Eleanor	104	" "
22813	22826	22827	22827	Eleanor	104	" said the sister , looking timidly into her brother 's face . "
22914	22972	22973	22974	Pakenham Villas	163	" And Bold consoled himself with the consolation of a Roman . Mary sat silent for awhile , till at last her brother reminded her that the notes must be answered , and she got up , and placed her desk before her , took out her pen and her paper , wrote on it slowly , — "
22979	22984	22985	22985	I	0	" My dear Eleanor , "
22987	22998	22985	22985	I	0	" and then stopped , and looked at her brother . "
23010	23011	23006	23006	you	164	" "
23016	23020	23014	23014	John	121	" said she , "
23030	23031	23021	23022	dear John	121	" "
23037	23041	23021	23022	dear John	121	" said he . "
23097	23098	23086	23086	Eleanor	104	" "
23113	23114	23103	23104	Miss Harding	156	" "
23137	23149	23133	23133	you	121	" And she came and knelt before him on the rug . "
23202	23203	23204	23204	You	162	" "
23214	23225	23204	23204	You	162	" said he , smoothing her hair with his hand . "
23343	23372	23326	23326	you	121	" He did not answer , as she knelt there , leaning on his knees , but by his face she thought that he was inclined to yield . "
23402	23419	23420	23420	My	0	" And she got up , hoping to conclude her note in the way she desired . "
23427	23435	23420	23420	My	0	" at last he said , rising ; "
23524	24718	24720	24720	David	168	" And the Barchester Brutus went out to fortify his own resolution by meditations on his own virtue . Poor Mary Bold sat down , and sadly finished her note , saying that she would herself attend the party , but that her brother was unavoidably prevented from doing so . I fear that she did not admire as she should have done the self - devotion of his singular virtue . The party went off as such parties do : there were fat old ladies , in fine silk dresses , and slim young ladies , in gauzy muslin frocks ; old gentlemen stood up with their backs to the empty fire - place , looking by no means so comfortable as they would have done in their own armchairs at home ; and young gentlemen , rather stiff about the neck , clustered near the door , not as yet sufficiently in courage to attack the muslin frocks , who awaited the battle , drawn up in a semicircular array . The warden endeavoured to induce a charge , but failed signally , not having the tact of a general : his daughter did what she could to comfort the forces under her command , who took in refreshing rations of cake and tea , and patiently looked for the coming engagement : but she herself , Eleanor , had no spirit for the work ; the only enemy whose lance she cared to encounter was not there , and she and others were somewhat dull . Loud above all voices was heard the clear sonorous tones of the archdeacon as he dilated to brother parsons of the danger of the church , of the fearful rumours of mad reforms even at Oxford , and of the damnable heresies of Dr. Whiston . Soon , however , sweeter sounds began timidly to make themselves audible . Little movements were made in a quarter , notable for round stools and music stands . Wax candles were arranged in sconces , big books were brought from hidden recesses , and the work of the evening commenced . How often were those pegs twisted and retwisted before our friend found that he had twisted them enough ; how many discordant scrapes gave promise of the coming harmony ! How much the muslin fluttered and crumpled before Eleanor and another nymph were duly seated at the piano ; how closely did that tall Apollo pack himself against the wall , with his flute , long as himself , extending high over the heads of his pretty neighbours ; into how small a corner crept that round and florid little minor canon , and there with skill amazing found room to tune his accustomed fiddle ! And now the crash begins : away they go in full flow of harmony together — up hill and down dale — now louder and louder , then lower and lower : now loud , as though stirring the battle ; then low , as though mourning the slain . In all , through all , and above all , is heard the violoncello . Ah , not for nothing were those pegs so twisted and retwisted — listen , listen ! Now alone that saddest of instruments tells its touching tale . Silent , and in awe , stand fiddle , flute , and piano , to hear the sorrows of their wailing brother . ' Tis but for a moment : before the melancholy of those low notes has been fully realised , again comes the full force of all the band — down go the pedals , away rush twenty fingers scouring over the bass notes with all the impetus of passion . Apollo blows till his stiff neckcloth is no better than a rope , and the minor canon works both arms till he falls in a syncope of exhaustion against the wall . How comes it that now , when all should be silent , when courtesy , if not taste , should make men listen , — how is it at this moment the black - coated corps leave their retreat and begin skirmishing ? One by one they creep forth , and fire off little guns timidly , and without precision . Ah , my men , efforts such as these will take no cities , even though the enemy should be never so open to assault . At length a more deadly artillery is brought to bear ; slowly , but with effect , the advance is made ; the muslin ranks are broken , and fall into confusion ; the formidable array of chairs gives way ; the battle is no longer between opposing regiments , but hand to hand , and foot to foot with single combatants , as in the glorious days of old , when fighting was really noble . In corners , and under the shadow of curtains , behind sofas and half hidden by doors , in retiring windows , and sheltered by hanging tapestry , are blows given and returned , fatal , incurable , dealing death . Apart from this another combat arises , more sober and more serious . The archdeacon is engaged against two prebendaries , a pursy full - blown rector assisting him , in all the perils and all the enjoyments of short whist . With solemn energy do they watch the shuffled pack , and , all - expectant , eye the coming trump . With what anxious nicety do they arrange their cards , jealous of each other 's eyes ! Why is that lean doctor so slow — cadaverous man with hollow jaw and sunken eye , ill beseeming the richness of his mother church ! Ah , why so slow , thou meagre doctor ? See how the archdeacon , speechless in his agony , deposits on the board his cards , and looks to heaven or to the ceiling for support . Hark , how he sighs , as with thumbs in his waistcoat pocket he seems to signify that the end of such torment is not yet even nigh at hand ! Vain is the hope , if hope there be , to disturb that meagre doctor . With care precise he places every card , weighs well the value of each mighty ace , each guarded king , and comfort - giving queen ; speculates on knave and ten , counts all his suits , and sets his price upon the whole . At length a card is led , and quick three others fall upon the board . The little doctor leads again , while with lustrous eye his partner absorbs the trick . Now thrice has this been done — thrice has constant fortune favoured the brace of prebendaries , ere the archdeacon rouses himself to the battle : but at the fourth assault he pins to the earth a prostrate king , laying low his crown and sceptre , bushy beard , and lowering brow , with a poor deuce . "
24724	24784	24720	24720	David	168	" says the archdeacon , pushing over the four cards to his partner . And then a trump is led , then another trump ; then a king — and then an ace — and then a long ten , which brings down from the meagre doctor his only remaining tower of strength — his cherished queen of trumps . "
24791	24799	25309	25309	papa	2730	" says the archdeacon to his partner . "
24804	24890	25309	25309	papa	2730	" mutters from his inmost stomach the pursy rector , who sits there red - faced , silent , impervious , careful , a safe but not a brilliant ally . But the archdeacon cares not for many clubs , or for none . He dashes out his remaining cards with a speed most annoying to his antagonists , pushes over to them some four cards as their allotted portion , shoves the remainder across the table to the red - faced rector : calls out "
24906	25107	25309	25309	papa	2730	" marks a treble under the candle - stick , and has dealt round the second pack before the meagre doctor has calculated his losses . And so went off the warden 's party , and men and women arranging shawls and shoes declared how pleasant it had been ; and Mrs. Goodenough , the red - faced rector 's wife , pressing the warden 's hand , declared she had never enjoyed herself better ; which showed how little pleasure she allowed herself in this world , as she had sat the whole evening through in the same chair without occupation , not speaking , and unspoken to . And Matilda Johnson , when she allowed young Dickson of the bank to fasten her cloak round her neck , thought that two hundred pounds a year and a little cottage would really do for happiness ; besides he was sure to be manager some day . And Apollo folding his flute into his pocket , felt that he had acquitted himself with honour ; and the archdeacon pleasantly gingled his gains ; but the meagre doctor went off without much audible speech , muttering ever and anon as he went "
25113	25114	25309	25309	papa	2730	" "
25120	25277	25309	25309	papa	2730	" And so they all were gone , and Mr. Harding was left alone with his daughter . What had passed between Eleanor Harding and Mary Bold need not be told . It is indeed a matter of thankfulness that neither the historian nor the novelist hears all that is said by their heroes or heroines , or how would three volumes or twenty suffice ! In the present case so little of this sort have I overheard , that I live in hopes of finishing my work within 300 pages , and of completing that pleasant task — a novel in one volume ; but something had passed between them , and as the warden blew out the wax candles , and put his instrument into its case , his daughter stood sad and thoughtful by the empty fireplace , determined to speak to her father , but irresolute as to what she would say . "
25282	25286	25309	25309	papa	2730	" said he , "
25292	25293	25288	25288	you	104	" "
25296	25302	25288	25288	you	104	" said she , moving , "
25326	25327	25328	25328	He	122	" "
25338	25343	25332	25332	I	0	" said the warden . "
25356	25357	25346	25346	you	104	" "
25388	25389	25391	25391	papa	2730	" "
25397	25413	25391	25391	papa	2730	" she exclaimed , throwing her arms round him , and looking into his face ; "
25437	25446	25479	25479	papa	2730	" she did n't well know what word to use—"any
25449	25450	25479	25479	papa	2730	" "
25461	25462	25479	25479	papa	2730	" "
25491	25678	25483	25483	you	0	" Mr. Harding was not the man to judge harshly of any one , much less of the daughter whom he now loved better than any living creature ; but still he did judge her wrongly at this moment . He knew that she loved John Bold ; he fully sympathised in her affection ; day after day he thought more of the matter , and , with the tender care of a loving father , tried to arrange in his own mind how matters might be so managed that his daughter 's heart should not be made the sacrifice to the dispute which was likely to exist between him and Bold . Now , when she spoke to him for the first time on the subject , it was natural that he should think more of her than of himself , and that he should imagine that her own cares , and not his , were troubling her . He stood silent before her awhile , as she gazed up into his face , and then kissing her forehead he placed her on the sofa . "
25684	25713	25682	25682	Nelly	104	" he said ( he only called her Nelly in his kindest , softest , sweetest moods , and yet all his moods were kind and sweet ) , "
25727	25895	25722	25723	Mr. Bold	122	" She was quite taken aback by the question . I will not say that she had forgotten herself , and her own love in thinking about John Bold , and while conversing with Mary : she certainly had not done so . She had been sick at heart to think , that a man of whom she could not but own to herself that she loved him , of whose regard she had been so proud , that such a man should turn against her father to ruin him . She had felt her vanity hurt , that his affection for her had not kept him from such a course ; had he really cared for her , he would not have risked her love by such an outrage ; but her main fear had been for her father , and when she spoke of danger , it was of danger to him and not to herself . She was taken aback by the question altogether : "
25903	25904	25901	25901	papa	2730	" "
25933	25978	25929	25929	you	104	" She sat still in his arms without answering him . She certainly had not prepared herself for an avowal of affection , intending , as she had done , to abuse John Bold herself , and to hear her father do so also . "
25984	25988	25999	25999	you	1059	" said he , "
26018	26313	26314	26315	My sister	1062	" And then , without waiting for an answer , he described to her , as he best could , the accusation that was made about Hiram 's will , the clains which the old men put forward ; what he considered the strength and what the weakness of his own position ; the course which Bold had taken , and that which he presumed he was about to take ; and then by degrees , without further question , he presumed on the fact of Eleanor 's love , and spoke of that love as a feeling which he could in no way disapprove : he apologised for Bold , excused what he was doing ; nay praised him for his energy and intentions : made much of his good qualities , and harped on none of his foibles ; then , reminding his daughter how late it was , and comforting her with much assurance which he hardly felt himself , he sent her to her room , with flowing eyes and a full heart . When Mr. Harding met his daughter at breakfast the next morning , there was no further discussion on the matter , nor was the subject mentioned between them for some days . Soon after the party Mary Bold called at the hospital , but there were various persons in the drawing - room at the time , and she therefore said nothing about her brother . On the day following , John Bold met Miss Harding in one of the quiet sombre shaded walks of the close : he was most anxious to see her , but unwilling to call at the warden 's house , and had in truth waylaid her in her private haunts . "
26319	26331	26314	26315	My sister	1062	" said he , abruptly hurrying on with his premeditated speech , "
26356	26357	26346	26346	I	0	" "
26363	26371	26346	26346	I	0	" said Eleanor , with dignified composure . "
26386	26414	26378	26378	you	156	" And Bold hesitated , muttered , stopped , commenced his explanation again , and again broke down . Eleanor would not help him in the least . "
26426	26427	26423	26424	Miss Harding	156	" "
26485	26486	26487	26488	Your father	2726	" "
26521	26522	26512	26512	you	156	" "
26526	26530	26523	26524	Mr. Bold	122	" said she , "
26623	27797	27800	27801	the Jupiter	171	" And then curtseying low she sailed on , leaving her lover in anything but a happy state of mind . Though Eleanor Harding rode off from John Bold on a high horse , it must not be supposed that her heart was so elate as her demeanour . In the first place , she had a natural repugnance to losing her lover ; and in the next , she was not quite so sure that she was in the right as she pretended to be . Her father had told her , and that now repeatedly , that Bold was doing nothing unjust or ungenerous , and why then should she rebuke him , and throw him off , when she felt herself so ill able to bear his loss ? — but such is human nature , and young - lady - nature especially . As she walked off from him beneath the shady elms of the close , her look , her tone , every motion and gesture of her body , belied her heart ; she would have given the world to have taken him by the hand , to have reasoned with him , persuaded him , cajoled him , coaxed him out of his project ; to have overcome him with all her female artillery , and to have redeemed her father at the cost of herself ; but pride would not let her do this , and she left him without a look of love or a word of kindness . Had Bold been judging of another lover and of another lady he might have understood all this as well as we do ; but in matters of love men do not see clearly in their own affairs . They say that faint heart never won fair lady ; and it is amazing to me how fair ladies are won , so faint are often men 's hearts ! Were it not for the kindness of their nature , that seeing the weakness of our courage they will occasionally descend from their impregnable fortresses , and themselves aid us in effecting their own defeat , too often would they escape unconquered if not unscathed , and free of body if not of heart . Poor Bold crept off quite crest - fallen ; he felt that as regarded Eleanor Harding his fate was sealed , unless he could consent to give up a task to which he had pledged himself , and which indeed it would not be easy for him to give up . Lawyers were engaged , and the question had to a certain extent been taken up by the public ; besides , how could a high - spirited girl like Eleanor Harding really learn to love a man for neglecting a duty which he assumed ! Could she allow her affection to be purchased at the cost of his own self - respect ? As regarded the issue of his attempt at reformation in the hospital , Bold had no reason hitherto to be discontented with his success . All Barchester was by the ears about it . The bishop , the archdeacon , the warden , the steward , and several other clerical allies , had daily meetings , discussing their tactics , and preparing for the great attack . Sir Abraham Haphazard had been consulted , but his opinion was not yet received : copies of Hiram 's will , copies of warden 's journals , copies of leases , copies of accounts , copies of everything that could be copied , and of some that could not , had been sent to him ; and the case was assuming most creditable dimensions . But above all , it had been mentioned in the daily Jupiter . That all powerful organ of the press in one of its leading thunderbolts launched at St. Cross , had thus remarked : ' Another case , of smaller dimensions indeed , but of similar import , is now likely to come under public notice . We are informed that the warden or master of an old almshouse attached to Barchester Cathedral is in receipt of twenty - five times the annual income appointed for him by the will of the founder , while the sum yearly expended on the absolute purposes of the charity has always remained fixed . In other words , the legatees under the founder 's will have received no advantage from the increase in the value of the property during the last four centuries , such increase having been absorbed by the so - called warden . It is impossible to conceive a case of greater injustice . It is no answer to say that some six or nine or twelve old men receive as much of the goods of this world as such old men require . On what foundation , moral or divine , traditional or legal , is grounded the warden 's claim to the large income he receives for doing nothing ? The contentment of these almsmen , if content they be , can give him no title to this wealth ! Does he ever ask himself , when he stretches wide his clerical palm to receive the pay of some dozen of the working clergy , for what service he is so remunerated ? Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies ? Or is it possible that the subject never so presents itself to his mind ; that he has received for many years , and intends , should God spare him , to receive for years to come , these fruits of the industrious piety of past ages , indifferent as to any right on his own part , or of any injustice to others ! We must express an opinion that nowhere but in the Church of England , and only there among its priests , could such a state of moral indifference be found . ' I must for the present leave my readers to imagine the state of Mr. Harding 's mind after reading the above article . They say that forty thousand copies of the Jupiter are daily sold , and that each copy is read by five persons at the least . Two hundred thousand readers then would hear this accusation against him ; two hundred thousand hearts would swell with indignation at the griping injustice , the bare - faced robbery of the warden of Barchester Hospital ! And how was he to answer this ? How was he to open his inmost heart to this multitude , to these thousands , the educated , the polished , the picked men of his own country ; how show them that he was no robber , no avaricious lazy priest scrambling for gold , but a retiring humble - spirited man who had innocently taken what had innocently been offered to him ? "
27803	27808	27800	27801	the Jupiter	171	" suggested the bishop . "
27811	27823	27800	27801	the Jupiter	171	" said the archdeacon , more worldly wise than his father , "
28068	28371	28372	28375	each one of us	1082	" The article in the Jupiter , while it so greatly harassed our poor warden , was an immense triumph to some of the opposite party . Sorry as Bold was to see Mr. Harding attacked so personally , it still gave him a feeling of elation to find his cause taken up by so powerful an advocate : and as to Finney , the attorney , he was beside himself . What ! to be engaged in the same cause and on the same side with the Jupiter ; to have the views he had recommended seconded , and furthered , and battled for by the Jupiter ! Perhaps to have his own name mentioned as that of the learned gentleman whose efforts had been so successful on behalf of the poor of Barchester ! He might be examined before committees of the House of Commons , with heaven knows how much a day for his personal expenses — he might be engaged for years on such a suit ! There was no end to the glorious golden dreams which this leader in the Jupiter produced in the soaring mind of Finney . And the old bedesmen , they also heard of this article , and had a glimmering , indistinct idea of the marvellous advocate which had now taken up their cause . Abel Handy limped hither and thither through the rooms , repeating all that he understood to have been printed , with some additions of his own which he thought should have been added . He told them how the Jupiter had declared that their warden was no better than a robber , and that what the Jupiter said was acknowledged by the world to be true . How the Jupiter had affirmed that each one of them — "
28384	28628	28377	28378	Jonathan Crumple	147	" — had a clear right to a hundred a year ; and that if the Jupiter had said so , it was better than a decision of the Lord Chancellor ; and then he carried about the paper , supplied by Mr. Finney , which , though none of them could read it , still afforded in its very touch and aspect positive corroboration of what was told them , and Jonathan Crumple pondered deeply over his returning wealth ; and Job Skulpit saw how right he had been in signing the petition , and said so many scores of times ; and Spriggs leered fearfully with his one eye ; and Moody , as he more nearly approached the coming golden age , hated more deeply than ever those who still kept possession of what he so coveted . Even Billy Gazy and poor bedridden Bell became active and uneasy , and the great Bunce stood apart with lowering brow , with deep grief seated in his heart , for he perceived that evil days were coming . It had been decided , the archdeacon advising , that no remonstrance , explanation , or defence should be addressed from the Barchester conclave to the Editor of the Jupiter , but hitherto that was the only decision to which they had come . Sir Abraham Haphazard was deeply engaged in preparing a bill for the mortification of papists , to be called the "
28633	28950	28377	28378	Jonathan Crumple	147	" the purport of which was to enable any protestant clergyman over fifty years of age to search any nun whom he suspected of being in possession of treasonable papers , or jesuitical symbols : and as there were to be a hundred and thirty - seven clauses in the bill , each clause containing a separate thorn for the side of the papist , and as it was known the bill would be fought inch by inch , by fifty maddened Irishmen , the due construction and adequate dovetailing of it did consume much of Sir Abraham 's time . The bill had all its desired effect . Of course it never passed into law ; but it so completely divided the ranks of the Irish members , who had bound themselves together to force on the ministry a bill for compelling all men to drink Irish whisky , and all women to wear Irish poplins , that for the remainder of the session the Great Poplin and Whisky League was utterly harmless . Thus it happened that Sir Abraham 's opinion was not at once forthcoming , and the uncertainty , the expectation , and suffering of the folk of Barchester was maintained at a high pitch . The reader must now be requested to visit the rectory of Plumstead Episcopi ; and as it is as yet still early morning , to ascend again with us into the bedroom of the archdeacon . The mistress of the mansion was at her toilet ; on which we will not dwell with profane eyes , but proceed into a small inner room , where the doctor dressed and kept his boots and sermons ; and here we will take our stand premising that the door of the room was so open as to admit of a conversation between our reverend Adam and his valued Eve . "
28960	28965	28958	28958	archdeacon	2734	" said the latter ; "
28987	28988	28985	28985	you	1084	" "
28995	29026	29029	29029	you	1084	" said the doctor , appearing at the door of his dressing - room , with his face and head enveloped in the rough towel which he was violently using ; "
29040	29041	29036	29036	my	0	" "
29051	29059	29036	29036	my	0	" said the lady , interrupting him ; "
29103	29104	29120	29120	archdeacon	2734	" "
29110	29111	29120	29120	archdeacon	2734	" "
29168	29169	29151	29151	you	1084	" "
29175	29176	29151	29151	you	1084	" "
29250	29370	29242	29243	John Bold	121	" added the anxious sister , giving the last twist to her last shoestring . Dr. Grantly felt keenly the injustice of this attack ; but what could he say ? He certainly had huffed John Bold ; he certainly had objected to him as a brother - in - law , and a very few months ago the very idea had excited his wrath : but now matters were changed ; John Bold had shown his power , and , though he was as odious as ever to the archdeacon , power is always respected , and the reverend dignitary began to think that such an alliance might not have been imprudent . Nevertheless , his motto was still "
29374	29446	29449	29450	Sir Abraham	151	" he would still fight it out ; he still believed confidently in Oxford , in the bench of bishops , in Sir Abraham Haphazard , and in himself ; and it was only when alone with his wife that doubts of defeat ever beset him . He once more tried to communicate this confidence to Mrs. Grantly , and for the twentieth time began to tell her of Sir Abraham . "
29452	29468	29469	29470	Sir Abraham	151	" said she , collecting all her house keys into her basket before she descended ; "
29553	32042	29543	29543	he	2730	" And so the lady descended to family worship among her children and servants , the pattern of a good and prudent wife . Dr. Grantly was blessed with a happy , thriving family . There were , first , three boys , now at home from school for the holidays . They were called , respectively , Charles James , Henry , and Samuel . The two younger ( there were five in all ) were girls ; the elder , Florinda , bore the name of the Archbishop of York 's wife , whose godchild she was ; and the younger had been christened Grizzel , after a sister of the Archbishop of Canterbury . The boys were all clever , and gave good promise of being well able to meet the cares and trials of the world ; and yet they were not alike in their dispositions , and each had his individual character , and each his separate admirers among the doctor 's friends . Charles James was an exact and careful boy ; he never committed himself ; he well knew how much was expected from the eldest son of the Archdeacon of Barchester , and was therefore mindful not to mix too freely with other boys . He had not the great talents of his younger brothers , but he exceeded them in judgment and propriety of demeanour ; his fault , if he had one , was an over - attention to words instead of things ; there was a thought too much finesse about him , and , as even his father sometimes told him , he was too fond of a compromise . The second was the archdeacon 's favourite son , and Henry was indeed a brilliant boy . The versatility of his genius was surprising , and the visitors at Plumstead Episcopi were often amazed at the marvellous manner in which he would , when called on , adapt his capacity to apparently most uncongenial pursuits . He appeared once before a large circle as Luther the reformer , and delighted them with the perfect manner in which he assumed the character ; and within three days he again astonished them by acting the part of a Capuchin friar to the very life . For this last exploit his father gave him a golden guinea , and his brothers said the reward had been promised beforehand in the event of the performance being successful . He was also sent on a tour into Devonshire ; a treat which the lad was most anxious of enjoying . His father 's friends there , however , did not appreciate his talents , and sad accounts were sent home of the perversity of his nature . He was a most courageous lad , game to the backbone . It was soon known , both at home , where he lived , and within some miles of Barchester Cathedral , and also at Westminster , where he was at school , that young Henry could box well and would never own himself beat ; other boys would fight while they had a leg to stand on , but he would fight with no leg at all . Those backing him would sometimes think him crushed by the weight of blows and faint with loss of blood , and his friends would endeavour to withdraw him from the contest ; but no , Henry never gave in , was never weary of the battle . The ring was the only element in which he seemed to enjoy himself ; and while other boys were happy in the number of their friends , he rejoiced most in the multitude of his foes . His relations could not but admire his pluck , but they sometimes were forced to regret that he was inclined to be a bully ; and those not so partial to him as his father was , observed with pain that , though he could fawn to the masters and the archdeacon 's friends , he was imperious and masterful to the servants and the poor . But perhaps Samuel was the general favourite ; and dear little Soapy , as he was familiarly called , was as engaging a child as ever fond mother petted . He was soft and gentle in his manners , and attractive in his speech ; the tone of his voice was melody , and every action was a grace ; unlike his brothers , he was courteous to all , he was affable to the lowly , and meek even to the very scullery maid . He was a boy of great promise , minding his books and delighting the hearts of his masters . His brothers , however , were not particularly fond of him ; they would complain to their mother that Soapy 's civility all meant something ; they thought that his voice was too often listened to at Plumstead Episcopi , and evidently feared that , as he grew up , he would have more weight in the house than either of them ; there was , therefore , a sort of agreement among them to put young Soapy down . This , however , was not so easy to be done ; Samuel , though young , was sharp ; he could not assume the stiff decorum of Charles James , nor could he fight like Henry ; but he was a perfect master of his own weapons , and contrived , in the teeth of both of them , to hold the place which he had assumed . Henry declared that he was a false , cunning creature ; and Charles James , though he always spoke of him as his dear brother Samuel , was not slow to say a word against him when opportunity offered . To speak the truth , Samuel was a cunning boy , and those even who loved him best could not but own that for one so young , he was too adroit in choosing his words , and too skilled in modulating his voice . The two little girls Florinda and Grizzel were nice little girls enough , but they did not possess the strong sterling qualities of their brothers ; their voices were not often heard at Plumstead Episcopi ; they were bashful and timid by nature , slow to speak before company even when asked to do so ; and though they looked very nice in their clean white muslin frocks and pink sashes , they were but little noticed by the archdeacon 's visitors . Whatever of submissive humility may have appeared in the gait and visage of the archdeacon during his colloquy with his wife in the sanctum of their dressing - rooms , was dispelled as he entered his breakfast - parlour with erect head and powerful step . In the presence of a third person he assumed the lord and master ; and that wise and talented lady too well knew the man to whom her lot for life was bound , to stretch her authority beyond the point at which it would be borne . Strangers at Plumstead Episcopi , when they saw the imperious brow with which he commanded silence from the large circle of visitors , children , and servants who came together in the morning to hear him read the word of God , and watched how meekly that wife seated herself behind her basket of keys with a little girl on each side , as she caught that commanding glance ; strangers , I say , seeing this , could little guess that some fifteen minutes since she had stoutly held her ground against him , hardly allowing him to open his mouth in his own defence . But such is the tact and talent of women ! And now let us observe the well - furnished breakfast - parlour at Plumstead Episcopi , and the comfortable air of all the belongings of the rectory . Comfortable they certainly were , but neither gorgeous nor even grand ; indeed , considering the money that had been spent there , the eye and taste might have been better served ; there was an air of heaviness about the rooms which might have been avoided without any sacrifice of propriety ; colours might have been better chosen and lights more perfectly diffused : but perhaps in doing so the thorough clerical aspect of the whole might have been somewhat marred ; at any rate , it was not without ample consideration that those thick , dark , costly carpets were put down ; those embossed , but sombre papers hung up ; those heavy curtains draped so as to half - exclude the light of the sun : nor were these old - fashioned chairs , bought at a price far exceeding that now given for more modern goods , without a purpose . The breakfast - service on the table was equally costly and equally plain ; the apparent object had been to spend money without obtaining brilliancy or splendour . The urn was of thick and solid silver , as were also the tea - pot , coffee - pot , cream - ewer , and sugar - bowl ; the cups were old , dim dragon china , worth about a pound a piece , but very despicable in the eyes of the uninitiated . The silver forks were so heavy as to be disagreeable to the hand , and the bread - basket was of a weight really formidable to any but robust persons . The tea consumed was the very best , the coffee the very blackest , the cream the very thickest ; there was dry toast and buttered toast , muffins and crumpets ; hot bread and cold bread , white bread and brown bread , home - made bread and bakers ' bread , wheaten bread and oaten bread , and if there be other breads than these , they were there ; there were eggs in napkins , and crispy bits of bacon under silver covers ; and there were little fishes in a little box , and devilled kidneys frizzling on a hot - water dish ; which , by the bye , were placed closely contiguous to the plate of the worthy archdeacon himself . Over and above this , on a snow - white napkin , spread upon the sideboard , was a huge ham and a huge sirloin ; the latter having laden the dinner table on the previous evening . Such was the ordinary fare at Plumstead Episcopi . And yet I have never found the rectory a pleasant house . The fact that man shall not live by bread alone seemed to be somewhat forgotten ; and noble as was the appearance of the host , and sweet and good - natured as was the face of the hostess , talented as were the children , and excellent as were the viands and the wines , in spite of these attractions , I generally found the rectory somewhat dull . After breakfast the archdeacon would retire , of course to his clerical pursuits . Mrs. Grantly , I presume , inspected her kitchen , though she had a first - rate housekeeper , with sixty pounds a year ; and attended to the lessons of Florinda and Grizzel , though she had an excellent governess with thirty pounds a year : but at any rate she disappeared : and I never could make companions of the boys . Charles James , though he always looked as though there was something in him , never seemed to have much to say ; and what he did say he would always unsay the next minute . He told me once , that he considered cricket , on the whole , to be a gentleman - like game for boys , provided they would play without running about ; and that fives , also , was a seemly game , so that those who played it never heated themselves . Henry once quarrelled with me for taking his sister Grizzel 's part , in a contest between them as to the best mode of using a watering - pot for the garden flowers ; and from that day to this he has not spoken to me , though he speaks at me often enough . For half an hour or so I certainly did like Sammy 's gentle speeches ; but one gets tired of honey , and I found that he preferred the more admiring listeners whom he met in the kitchen - garden and back precincts of the establishment ; besides , I think I once caught Sammy fibbing . On the whole , therefore , I found the rectory a dull house , though it must be admitted that everything there was of the very best . After breakfast , on the morning of which we are writing , the archdeacon , as usual , retired to his study , intimating that he was going to be very busy , but that he would see Mr. Chadwick if he called . On entering this sacred room he carefully opened the paper case on which he was wo nt to compose his favourite sermons , and spread on it a fair sheet of paper , and one partly written on ; he then placed his inkstand , looked at his pen , and folded his blotting - paper ; having done so , he got up again from his seat , stood with his back to the fire - place , and yawned comfortably , stretching out vastly his huge arms , and opening his burly chest . He then walked across the room and locked the door ; and having so prepared himself , he threw himself into his easy chair , took from a secret drawer beneath his table a volume of Rabelais , and began to amuse himself with the witty mischief of Panurge ; and so passed the archdeacon 's morning on that day . He was left undisturbed at his studies for an hour or two , when a knock came to the door , and Mr. Chadwick was announced . Rabelais retired into the secret drawer , the easy chair seemed knowingly to betake itself off , and when the archdeacon quickly undid his bolt , he was discovered by the steward working , as usual , for that church of which he was so useful a pillar . Mr. Chadwick had just come from London , and was , therefore , known to be the bearer of important news . "
32053	32063	32043	32043	We	1105	" said Mr. Chadwick , as he seated himself . "
32070	32076	32043	32043	We	1105	" exclaimed the archdeacon impatiently . "
32087	32092	32043	32043	We	1105	" said the other ; "
32108	32152	32103	32103	you	1106	" and he handed him a copy , in heaven knows how many spun - out folios , of the opinion which the attorney - general had managed to cram on the back and sides of the case as originally submitted to him . "
32157	32161	32103	32103	you	1106	" said Chadwick , "
32235	32236	32232	32233	your father	2726	" "
32241	32246	32232	32233	your father	2726	" said the archdeacon ; "
32259	32260	32257	32257	he	122	" "
32341	32342	32375	32376	the bishop	260	" "
32348	32353	32375	32376	the bishop	260	" said the archdeacon . "
32359	32364	32365	32365	You	1119	" said the other . "
32480	32600	32605	32605	Chadwick	109	" The archdeacon rubbed his hands with delight ; he had never doubted the justice of his case , but he had begun to have some dread of unjust success on the part of his enemies . It was delightful to him thus to hear that their cause was surrounded with such rocks and shoals ; such causes of shipwreck unseen by the landsman 's eye , but visible enough to the keen eyes of practical law mariners . How wrong his wife was to wish that Bold should marry Eleanor ! Bold ! why , if he should be ass enough to persevere , he would be a beggar before he knew whom he was at law with ! "
32622	32641	32614	32615	Sir Abraham	151	" and he put down on the table the copy of the opinion , and patted it fondly . "
32654	32655	32652	32652	archdeacon	2734	" "
32660	32665	32652	32652	archdeacon	2734	" said the doctor . "
32675	32676	32666	32666	People	1126	" "
32683	32688	32666	32666	People	1126	" said the doctor . "
32707	32708	32666	32666	People	1126	" "
32712	32717	32666	32666	People	1126	" said the doctor . "
32734	32735	32732	32732	archdeacon	2734	" "
32745	32758	32732	32732	archdeacon	2734	" said the archdeacon , pleased with the closeness of the confidence ; "
32764	32765	32766	32767	Mrs. Grantly	129	" "
32778	32977	32766	32767	Mrs. Grantly	129	" said Mr. Chadwick . Did the archdeacon wink , or did he not ? I am inclined to think he did not quite wink ; but that without such , perhaps , unseemly gesture he communicated to Mr. Chadwick , with the corner of his eye , intimation that , deep as was Mrs. Grantly 's interest in the matter , it should not procure for her a perusal of that document ; and at the same time he partly opened the small drawer , above spoken of , deposited the paper on the volume of Rabelais , and showed to Mr. Chadwick the nature of the key which guarded these hidden treasures . The careful steward then expressed himself contented . Ah ! vain man ! he could fasten up his Rabelais , and other things secret , with all the skill of Bramah or of Chubb ; but where could he fasten up the key which solved these mechanical mysteries ? It is probable to us that the contents of no drawer in that house were unknown to its mistress , and we think , moreover , that she was entitled to all such knowledge . "
32980	32985	32766	32767	Mrs. Grantly	129	" said Mr. Chadwick , "
33016	33017	33001	33002	Sir Abraham	151	" "
33025	33030	33001	33002	Sir Abraham	151	" said the doctor . "
33123	33124	33121	33121	myself	0	" "
33175	34087	34088	34089	Sir Abraham	151	" and he shook hands with the diocesan steward , and bowed him out . And the archdeacon had again recourse to his drawer , and twice read through the essence of Sir Abraham Haphazard 's law - enlightened and law - bewildered brains . It was very clear that to Sir Abraham , the justice of the old men 's claim or the justice of Mr. Harding 's defence were ideas that had never presented themselves . A legal victory over an opposing party was the service for which Sir Abraham was , as he imagined , to be paid ; and that he , according to his lights , had diligently laboured to achieve , and with probable hope of success . Of the intense desire which Mr. Harding felt to be assured on fit authority , that he was wronging no man , that he was entitled in true equity to his income , that he might sleep at night without pangs of conscience , that he was no robber , no spoiler of the poor ; that he and all the world might be openly convinced that he was not the man which the Jupiter had described him to be ; of such longings on the part of Mr. Harding , Sir Abraham was entirely ignorant ; nor , indeed , could it be looked on as part of his business to gratify such desires . Such was not the system on which his battles were fought , and victories gained . Success was his object , and he was generally successful . He conquered his enemies by their weakness rather than by his own strength , and it had been found almost impossible to make up a case , in which Sir Abraham , as an antagonist , would not find a flaw . The archdeacon was delighted with the closeness of the reasoning . To do him justice , it was not a selfish triumph that he desired ; he would personally lose nothing by defeat , or at least what he might lose did not actuate him ; but neither was it love of justice which made him so anxious , nor even mainly solicitude for his father - in - law . He was fighting a part of a never - ending battle against a never - conquered foe — that of the church against its enemies . He knew Mr. Harding could not pay all the expense of these doings ; for these long opinions of Sir Abraham 's , these causes to be pleaded , these speeches to be made , these various courts through which the case was , he presumed , to be dragged . He knew that he and his father must at least bear the heavier portion of this tremendous cost ; but to do the archdeacon justice , he did not recoil from this . He was a man fond of obtaining money , greedy of a large income , but open - handed enough in expending it , and it was a triumph to him to foresee the success of this measure , although he might be called on to pay so dearly for it himself . On the following morning the archdeacon was with his father betimes , and a note was sent down to the warden begging his attendance at the palace . Dr. Grantly , as he cogitated on the matter , leaning back in his brougham as he journeyed into Barchester , felt that it would be difficult to communicate his own satisfaction either to his father or his father - in - law . He wanted success on his own side and discomfiture on that of his enemies . The bishop wanted peace on the subject ; a settled peace if possible , but peace at any rate till the short remainder of his own days had spun itself out ; but Mr. Harding required , not only success and peace , but he also demanded that he might stand justified before the world . The bishop , however , was comparatively easy to deal with , and before the arrival of the other , the dutiful son had persuaded his father that all was going on well , and then the warden arrived . It was Mr. Harding 's wo nt , whenever he spent a morning at the palace , to seat himself immediately at the bishop 's elbow , the bishop occupying a huge armchair fitted up with candle - sticks , a reading table , a drawer , and other paraphernalia , the position of which chair was never moved , summer or winter ; and when , as was very usual , the archdeacon was there also , he confronted the two elders , who thus were enabled to fight the battle against him together ; and together submit to defeat , for such was their constant fate . Our warden now took his accustomed place , having greeted his son - in - law as he entered , and then affectionately inquired after his friend 's health . There was a gentleness about the bishop to which the soft womanly affection of Mr. Harding particularly endeared itself , and it was quaint to see how the two mild old priests pressed each other 's hands , and smiled and made little signs of love . "
34097	34118	34088	34089	Sir Abraham	151	" began the archdeacon . Mr. Harding had heard so much , and was most anxious to know the result . "
34124	34135	34136	34136	I	0	" said the bishop , pressing his friend 's arm . "
34141	34160	34136	34136	I	0	" Mr. Harding looked at the mighty bearer of the important news for confirmation of these glad tidings . "
34163	34168	34136	34136	I	0	" said the archdeacon , "
34232	34233	34223	34223	they	1139	" "
34240	34241	34238	34238	archdeacon	2734	" "
34303	34304	34295	34295	I	0	" "
34319	34324	34312	34312	I	0	" said Mr. Harding . "
34329	34330	34327	34327	you	2734	" "
34335	34348	34327	34327	you	2734	" said the archdeacon , impatient of poetry at such a time . "
34429	34430	34403	34404	the founder	464	" "
34436	34466	34403	34404	the founder	464	" said the bishop , who had winced visibly under the words servants and stipend , which , however , appeared to have caused no uneasiness to the archdeacon . "
34470	34474	34403	34404	the founder	464	" said he , "
34541	34542	34535	34539	the only judges of this	1160	" "
34550	34555	34535	34539	the only judges of this	1160	" asked the warden . "
34600	34601	34595	34595	I	0	" "
34604	34630	34595	34595	I	0	" said the bishop , looking inquiringly up into his friend 's face , who sat silent awhile , and apparently not so well satisfied . "
34634	34639	34595	34595	I	0	" continued the archdeacon ; "
34668	34669	34654	34658	no twelve men in England	1162	" "
34675	34680	34654	34658	no twelve men in England	1162	" said Mr. Harding , "
34728	34729	34714	34716	the chief manager	1166	" "
34808	34904	34906	34906	you	1173	" Mr. Harding again sat silent for awhile , during which the bishop once and again pressed his arm , and looked in his face to see if he could catch a gleam of a contented and eased mind ; but there was no such gleam , and the poor warden continued playing sad dirges on invisible stringed instruments in all manner of positions : he was ruminating in his mind on this opinion of Sir Abraham , looking to it wearily and earnestly for satisfaction , but finding none . At last he said , "
34913	35008	34906	34906	you	1173	" The archdeacon said he had not — that was to say , he had — that was , he had not seen the opinion itself ; he had seen what had been called a copy , but he could not say whether of a whole or part ; nor could he say that what he had seen were the ipsissima verba of the great man himself ; but what he had seen contained exactly the decision which he had announced , and which he again declared to be to his mind extremely satisfactory . "
35017	35022	34911	34911	archdeacon	2734	" said the warden ; "
35030	35031	34911	34911	archdeacon	2734	" "
35079	35080	34911	34911	archdeacon	2734	" "
35088	35093	34911	34911	archdeacon	2734	" asked the warden . "
35103	35118	34911	34911	archdeacon	2734	" said the archdeacon , throwing up his hands in token of his surprise ; "
35190	35206	35170	35170	we	1177	" The warden again sat silent , and the bishop again looked at him wistfully : "
35216	35221	35170	35170	we	1177	" continued the archdeacon , "
35242	35243	35244	35244	We	1177	" "
35252	35257	35244	35244	We	1177	" said the warden , "
35286	35287	35273	35273	him	3508	" "
35293	35298	35273	35273	him	3508	" said the archdeacon , "
35358	35407	35409	35410	the Jupiter	171	" Mr. Harding rose from his seat and paced thoughtfully up and down the library , the bishop the while watching him painfully at every turn , and the archdeacon continuing to pour forth his convictions that the affair was in a state to satisfy any prudent mind . "
35412	35420	35409	35410	the Jupiter	171	" said the warden , stopping suddenly . "
35426	35431	35423	35424	the Jupiter	3310	" answered the other . "
35469	35477	35423	35424	the Jupiter	3310	" and the archdeacon looked exceedingly moral ; "
35505	35833	35499	35499	we	1177	" and the archdeacon again looked exceedingly knowing and worldly wise . The warden continued his walk ; the hard and stinging words of that newspaper article , each one of which had thrust a thorn as it were into his inmost soul , were fresh in his memory : he had read it more than once , word by word , and what was worse , he fancied it was as well known to every one as to himself . Was he to be looked on as the unjust griping priest he had been there described ? Was he to be pointed at as the consumer of the bread of the poor , and to be allowed no means of refuting such charges , of clearing his begrimed name , of standing innocent in the world , as hitherto he had stood ? Was he to bear all this , to receive as usual his now hated income , and be known as one of those greedy priests who by their rapacity have brought disgrace on their church ? and why ? Why should he bear all this ? why should he die , for he felt that he could not live , under such a weight of obloquy ? As he paced up and down the room he resolved in his misery and enthusiasm that he could with pleasure , if he were allowed , give up his place , abandon his pleasant home , leave the hospital , and live poorly , happily , and with an unsullied name , on the small remainder of his means . He was a man somewhat shy of speaking of himself , even before those who knew him best , and whom he loved the most ; but at last it burst forth from him , and with a somewhat jerking eloquence he declared that he could not , would not , bear this misery any longer . "
35840	35846	35859	35859	God	159	" said he at last , "
35976	36018	35969	35969	you	1188	" and he appealed , almost in tears , to the bishop , who had left his chair , and was now leaning on the warden 's arm as he stood on the further side of the table facing the archdeacon . "
36048	36072	36020	36020	you	1188	" The bishop could feel for him and sympathise with him , but he could not advise him , he could only say , "
36130	36165	36168	36169	my lord	962	" But the archdeacon , though he could not sympathise , could advise ; and he saw that the time had come when it behoved him to do so in a somewhat peremptory manner . "
36171	36209	36168	36169	my lord	962	" he said speaking to his father : and when he called his father ' my lord , ' the good old bishop shook in his shoes , for he knew that an evil time was coming . "
36267	36268	36275	36275	I	0	" "
36279	36336	36275	36275	I	0	" said the bishop , reseating himself , and shading his face with his hands . Mr. Harding sat down with his back to the further wall , playing to himself some air fitted for so calamitous an occasion , and the archdeacon said out his say standing , with his back to the empty fireplace . "
36645	36646	36628	36628	you	1198	" "
36649	36670	36628	36628	you	1198	" said the bishop , expostulating . Mr. Harding sat unmoved , gazing on his son - in - law . "
36977	37029	37032	37032	us	1213	" The poor warden groaned as he sat perfectly still , looking up at the hard - hearted orator who thus tormented him , and the bishop echoed the sound faintly from behind his hands ; but the archdeacon cared little for such signs of weakness , and completed his exhortation . "
37225	37597	37598	37598	I	0	" And so the archdeacon ceased , and stood self - satisfied , watching the effect of his spoken wisdom . The warden felt himself , to a certain extent , stifled ; he would have given the world to get himself out into the open air without speaking to , or noticing those who were in the room with him ; but this was impossible . He could not leave without saying something , and he felt himself confounded by the archdeacon 's eloquence . There was a heavy , unfeeling , unanswerable truth in what he had said ; there was so much practical , but odious common sense in it , that he neither knew how to assent or to differ . If it were necessary for him to suffer , he felt that he could endure without complaint and without cowardice , providing that he was self - satisfied of the justice of his own cause . What he could not endure was , that he should be accused by others , and not acquitted by himself . Doubting , as he had begun to doubt , the justice of his own position in the hospital , he knew that his own self - confidence would not be restored because Mr. Bold had been in error as to some legal form ; nor could he be satisfied to escape , because , through some legal fiction , he who received the greatest benefit from the hospital might be considered only as one of its servants . The archdeacon 's speech had silenced him — stupefied him — annihilated him ; anything but satisfied him . With the bishop it fared not much better . He did not discern clearly how things were , but he saw enough to know that a battle was to be prepared for ; a battle that would destroy his few remaining comforts , and bring him with sorrow to the grave . The warden still sat , and still looked at the archdeacon , till his thoughts fixed themselves wholly on the means of escape from his present position , and he felt like a bird fascinated by gazing on a snake . "
37605	37617	37600	37600	you	1227	" said the archdeacon at last , breaking the dread silence ; "
37628	37637	37638	37639	My lord	962	" Oh what a sigh the bishop gave ! "
37648	37655	37641	37641	I	0	" again repeated the merciless tyrant . "
37662	37671	37641	37641	I	0	" groaned the poor old man , slowly . "
37677	37704	37673	37673	you	1227	" Mr. Harding was now stirred to action — he must speak and move , so he got up and took one turn before he answered . "
37739	38411	37730	37730	I	0	" And so without another word he took his leave , escaping quickly through the palace hall , and down the lofty steps , nor did he breathe freely till he found himself alone under the huge elms of the silent close . Here he walked long and slowly , thinking on his case with a troubled air , and trying in vain to confute the archdeacon 's argument . He then went home , resolved to bear it all — ignominy , suspense , disgrace , self - doubt , and heart - burning — and to do as those would have him , who he still believed were most fit and most able to counsel him aright . Mr. Harding was a sadder man than he had ever yet been when he returned to his own house . He had been wretched enough on that well remembered morning when he was forced to expose before his son - in - law the publisher 's account for ushering into the world his dear book of sacred music ; when after making such payments as he could do unassisted , he found that he was a debtor of more than three hundred pounds : but his sufferings then were as nothing to his present misery;—then he had done wrong , and he knew it , and was able to resolve that he would not sin in like manner again ; but now he could make no resolution , and comfort himself by no promises of firmness . He had been forced to think that his lot had placed him in a false position , and he was about to maintain that position against the opinion of the world and against his own convictions . He had read with pity , amounting almost to horror , the strictures which had appeared from time to time against the Earl of Guildford as master of St. Cross , and the invectives that had been heaped on rich diocesan dignitaries and overgrown sinecure pluralists . In judging of them , he judged leniently ; the whole bias of his profession had taught him to think that they were more sinned against than sinning , and that the animosity with which they had been pursued was venomous and unjust ; but he had not the less regarded their plight as most miserable . His hair had stood on end and his flesh had crept as he read the things which had been written ; he had wondered how men could live under such a load of disgrace ; how they could face their fellow creatures while their names were bandied about so injuriously and so publicly — and now this lot was to be his — he , that shy retiring man , who had so comforted himself in the hidden obscurity of his lot , who had so enjoyed the unassuming warmth of his own little corner , he was now to be dragged forth into the glaring day , and gibbeted before ferocious multitudes . He entered his own house a crest - fallen , humiliated man , without a hope of overcoming the wretchedness which affected him . He wandered into the drawing - room where was his daughter ; but he could not speak to her now , so he left it , and went into the book room . He was not quick enough to escape Eleanor 's glance , or to prevent her from seeing that he was disturbed ; and in a little while she followed him . She found him seated in his accustomed chair , with no book open before him , no pen ready in his hand , no ill - shapen notes of blotted music lying before him as was usual , none of those hospital accounts with which he was so precise and yet so unmethodical : he was doing nothing , thinking of nothing , looking at nothing ; he was merely suffering . "
38419	38423	37730	37730	I	0	" he said , "
38438	38507	37730	37730	I	0	" Eleanor saw well how it was , but she did leave him , and glided silently back to her drawing - room . When he had sat awhile , thus alone and unoccupied , he got up to walk again — he could make more of his thoughts walking than sitting , and was creeping out into his garden , when he met Bunce on the threshold . "
38512	38525	37730	37730	I	0	" said he , in a tone that for him was sharp , "
38535	38536	38537	38537	I	0	" "
38547	38557	38537	38537	I	0	" said the old bedesman , touching his hat ; "
38567	38589	38590	38591	Attorney Finney	188	" he added after a pause . The warden winced , and put his hand to his forehead and felt bewildered . "
38598	38602	38605	38605	his	188	" continued Bunce , "
38652	38664	38649	38649	I	0	" said the man , trying to assume a cheery tone , "
38690	38691	38700	38700	Bunce	136	" "
38702	38703	38700	38700	Bunce	136	" "
38712	38743	38709	38709	your	0	" said the old man , almost whispering . Mr. Harding walked on , and shook his head impatiently . Poor Bunce little knew how he was tormenting his patron . "
38761	38795	38796	38797	My friend	1236	" said he , with a tone of affection which the warden in all his misery could not resist . He stopped , and took both the old man 's hands in his . "
38799	38803	38804	38807	my dear old friend	1237	" said he , "
38827	38845	38821	38821	God	159	" and two small hot tears broke away from his eyes and stole down his furrowed cheeks . "
38853	38859	38847	38847	God	159	" said the other solemnly , "
38888	39083	38882	38882	God	159	" and so the warden again walked on , and the bedesman looking wistfully after him , and receiving no encouragement to follow , returned sadly to his own abode . For a couple of hours the warden remained thus in the garden , now walking , now standing motionless on the turf , and then , as his legs got weary , sitting unconsciously on the garden seats , and then walking again . And Eleanor , hidden behind the muslin curtains of the window , watched him through the trees as he now came in sight , and then again was concealed by the turnings of the walk ; and thus the time passed away till five , when the warden crept back to the house and prepared for dinner . It was but a sorry meal . The demure parlour - maid as she handed the dishes and changed the plates , saw that all was not right , and was more demure than ever : neither father nor daughter could eat , and the hateful food was soon cleared away , and the bottle of port placed upon the table . "
39094	39111	39092	39092	papa	2730	" said Eleanor , thinking that the company of the old man might lighten his sorrow . "
39147	39148	39149	39149	I	0	" "
39158	39159	39156	39156	papa	2730	" "
39162	39167	39156	39156	papa	2730	" said he irritated ; "
39211	40026	40027	40027	Papa	191	" And Eleanor was again banished from her father 's sorrow . Ah ! her desire now was not to find him happy , but to be allowed to share his sorrows ; not to force him to be sociable , but to persuade him to be trustful . She put on her bonnet as desired , and went up to Mary Bold ; this was now her daily haunt , for John Bold was up in London among lawyers and church reformers , diving deep into other questions than that of the wardenship of Barchester ; supplying information to one member of parliament , and dining with another ; subscribing to funds for the abolition of clerical incomes , and seconding at that great national meeting at the Crown and Anchor a resolution to the effect , that no clergyman of the Church of England , be he who he might , should have more than a thousand a year , and none less than two hundred and fifty . His speech on this occasion was short , for fifteen had to speak , and the room was hired for two hours only , at the expiration of which the Quakers and Mr. Cobden were to make use of it for an appeal to the public in aid of the Emperor of Russia ; but it was sharp and effective : at least he was told so by a companion with whom he now lived much , and on whom he greatly depended — one Tom Towers , a very leading genius , and supposed to have high employment on the staff of the Jupiter . So Eleanor , as was now her wo nt , went up to Mary Bold , and Mary listened kindly , while the daughter spoke much of her father , and , perhaps kinder still , found a listener in Eleanor , while she spoke about her brother . In the meantime the warden sat alone , leaning on the arm of his chair ; he had poured out a glass of wine , but had done so merely from habit , for he left it untouched : there he sat gazing at the open window , and thinking , if he can be said to have thought , of the happiness of his past life . All manner of past delights came before his mind , which at the time he had enjoyed without considering them ; his easy days , his absence of all kind of hard work , his pleasant shady home , those twelve old neighbours whose welfare till now had been the source of so much pleasant care , the excellence of his children , the friendship of the dear old bishop , the solemn grandeur of those vaulted aisles , through which he loved to hear his own voice pealing ; and then that friend of friends , that choice ally that had never deserted him , that eloquent companion that would always , when asked , discourse such pleasant music , that violoncello of his — ah , how happy he had been ! but it was over now ; his easy days and absence of work had been the crime which brought on him his tribulation ; his shady home was pleasant no longer ; may be it was no longer his ; the old neighbours , whose welfare had been so desired by him , were his enemies ; his daughter was as wretched as himself , and even the bishop was made miserable by his position . He could never again lift up his voice boldly as he had hitherto done among his brethren , for he felt that he was disgraced ; and he feared even to touch his bow , for he knew how grievous a sound of wailing , how piteous a lamentation , it would produce . He was still sitting in the same chair and the same posture , having hardly moved a limb for two hours , when Eleanor came back to tea , and succeeded in bringing him with her into the drawing - room . The tea seemed as comfortless as the dinner , though the warden , who had hitherto eaten nothing all day , devoured the plateful of bread and butter , unconscious of what he was doing . Eleanor had made up her mind to force him to talk to her , but she hardly knew how to commence : she must wait till the urn was gone , till the servant would no longer be coming in and out . At last everything was gone , and the drawingroom door was permanently closed ; then Eleanor , getting up and going round to her father , put her arm round his neck , and said , "
40038	40039	40031	40031	you	191	" "
40047	40048	40031	40031	you	191	" "
40064	40065	40062	40062	papa	2730	" "
40085	40099	40081	40081	our	1249	" and he tried to smile , but it was a ghastly failure ; "
40118	40119	40121	40121	papa	2730	" "
40137	40165	40166	40166	Papa	191	" and she sat upon his knee , as she sometimes would in their gayest moods , and with her arm round his neck , she said , "
40201	40246	40249	40249	papa	2730	" The father kissed his daughter , and pressed her to his heart ; but still he said nothing : it was so hard to him to speak of his own sorrows ; he was so shy a man even with his own child . "
40318	40386	40310	40311	dear papa	1258	" Mr. Harding could not well speak now , for the warm tears were running down his cheeks like rain in May , but he held his child close to his heart , and squeezed her hand as a lover might , and she kissed his forehead and his wet cheeks , and lay upon his bosom , and comforted him as a woman only can do . "
40391	40405	40310	40311	dear papa	1258	" he said , as soon as his tears would let him speak ; "
40450	40451	40457	40457	papa	2730	" "
40510	40722	40727	40727	papa	2730	" And Eleanor 's face was lighted up with enthusiasm as she told her father how he might banish all his care ; and a gleam of joy shot across his brow as this idea of escape again presented itself , and he again fancied for a moment that he could spurn away from him the income which the world envied him ; that he could give the lie to that wielder of the tomahawk who had dared to write such things of him in the Jupiter . That he could leave Sir Abraham , and the archdeacon , and Bold , and the rest of them with their lawsuit among them , and wipe his hands altogether of so sorrow - stirring a concern . Ah , what happiness might there be in the distance , with Eleanor and him in some small cottage , and nothing left of their former grandeur but their music ! Yes , they would walk forth with their music books , and their instruments , and shaking the dust from off their feet as they went , leave the ungrateful place . Never did a poor clergyman sigh for a warm benefice more anxiously than our warden did now to be rid of his . "
40729	40752	40727	40727	papa	2730	" she said again , jumping from his knees and standing on her feet before him , looking boldly into his face ; "
40759	40842	40757	40757	papa	2730	" Oh , it was sad to see how that momentary gleam of joy passed away ; how the look of hope was dispersed from that sorrowful face , as the remembrance of the archdeacon came back upon our poor warden , and he reflected that he could not stir from his now hated post . He was as a man bound with iron , fettered with adamant : he was in no respect a free agent ; he had no choice . "
40847	40866	40867	40867	Papa	191	" oh if he only could : what an easy way that were out of all his troubles ! "
40874	40893	40867	40867	Papa	191	" she continued , thinking that his hesitation arose from his unwillingness to abandon so comfortable a home ; "
41017	41445	41456	41456	she	1275	" How he pressed her to his heart again with almost a spasmodic pressure ! how he kissed her as the tears fell like rain from his old eyes ! how he blessed her , and called her by a hundred soft sweet names which now came new to his lips ! how he chid himself for ever having been unhappy with such a treasure in his house , such a jewel on his bosom , with so sweet a flower in the choice garden of his heart ! and then the flood - gates of his tongue were loosed , and , at length , with unsparing detail of circumstances , he told her all that he wished , and all that he could not do . He repeated those arguments of the archdeacon , not agreeing in their truth , but explaining his inability to escape from them ; how it had been declared to him that he was bound to remain where he was by the interests of his order , by gratitude to the bishop , by the wishes of his friends , by a sense of duty , which , though he could not understand it , he was fain to acknowledge . He told her how he had been accused of cowardice , and though he was not a man to make much of such a charge before the world , now in the full candour of his heart , he explained to her that such an accusation was grievous to him ; that he did think it would be unmanly to desert his post , merely to escape his present sufferings , and that , therefore , he must bear as best he might the misery which was prepared for him . And did she find these details tedious ? Oh , no — she encouraged him to dilate on every feeling he expressed , till he laid bare the inmost corners of his heart to her . They spoke together of the archdeacon , as two children might of a stern , unpopular , but still respected schoolmaster , and of the bishop as a parent kind as kind could be , but powerless against an omnipotent pedagogue . And then , when they had discussed all this , when the father had told all to the child , she could not be less confiding than he had been ; and as John Bold 's name was mentioned between them , she owned how well she had learned to love him,—"had
41450	41454	41456	41456	she	1275	" she said , "
41516	42550	42551	42551	John	121	" But the warden declared that Bold was no enemy of his , and encouraged her love ; and gently rebuked , as he kissed her , the stern resolve she had made to cast him off ; and then he spoke to her of happier days when their trials would all be over ; and declared that her young heart should not be torn asunder to please either priest or prelate , dean or archdeacon . No , not if all Oxford were to convocate together , and agree as to the necessity of the sacrifice . And so they greatly comforted each other — and in what sorrow will not such mutual confidence give consolation!—and with a last expression of tender love they parted , and went comparatively happy to their rooms . When Eleanor laid her head on her pillow that night , her mind was anxiously intent on some plan by which she might extricate her father from his misery ; and , in her warm - hearted enthusiasm , self - sacrifice was decided on as the means to be adopted . Was not so good an Agamemnon worthy of an Iphigenia ? She would herself personally implore John Bold to desist from his undertaking ; she would explain to him her father 's sorrows , the cruel misery of his position ; she would tell him how her father would die if he were thus dragged before the public and exposed to such unmerited ignominy ; she would appeal to his old friendship , to his generosity , to his manliness , to his mercy ; if need were she would kneel to him for the favour she would ask ; but before she did this , the idea of love must be banished . There must be no bargain in the matter . To his mercy , to his generosity , she could appeal ; but as a pure maiden , hitherto even unsolicited , she could not appeal to his love , nor under such circumstances could she allow him to do so . Of course when so provoked , he would declare his passion ; that was to be expected ; there had been enough between them to make such a fact sure ; but it was equally certain that he must be rejected . She could not be understood as saying , Make my father free and I am the reward . There would be no sacrifice in that — not so had Jephthah 's daughter saved her father — not so could she show to that kindest , dearest of parents how much she was able to bear for his good . No ; to one resolve must her whole soul be bound ; and so resolving , she felt that she could make her great request to Bold with as much self - assured confidence as she could have done to his grandfather . And now I own I have fears for my heroine : not as to the upshot of her mission — not in the least as to that ; as to the full success of her generous scheme , and the ultimate result of such a project , no one conversant with human nature and novels can have a doubt ; but as to the amount of sympathy she may receive from those of her own sex . Girls below twenty and old ladies above sixty will do her justice ; for in the female heart the soft springs of sweet romance reopen after many years , and again gush out with waters pure as in earlier days , and greatly refresh the path that leads downwards to the grave . But I fear that the majority of those between these two eras will not approve of Eleanor 's plan . I fear that unmarried ladies of thirty - five will declare that there can be no probability of so absurd a project being carried through ; that young women on their knees before their lovers are sure to get kissed , and that they would not put themselves in such a position did they not expect it ; that Eleanor is going to Bold , only because circumstances prevent Bold from coming to her ; that she is certainly a little fool , or a little schemer , but that in all probability she is thinking a good deal more about herself than her father . Dear ladies , you are right as to your appreciation of the circumstances , but very wrong as to Miss Harding 's character . Miss Harding was much younger than you are , and could not , therefore , know , as you may do , to what dangers such an encounter might expose her . She may get kissed ; I think it very probable that she will ; but I give my solemn word and positive assurance , that the remotest idea of such a catastrophe never occurred to her , as she made the great resolve now alluded to . And then she slept ; and then she rose refreshed , and met her father with her kindest embrace and most loving smiles ; and on the whole their breakfast was by no means so triste as had been their dinner the day before ; and then , making some excuse to her father for so soon leaving him , she started on the commencement of her operations . She knew that John Bold was in London , and that , therefore , the scene itself could not be enacted to - day ; but she also knew that he was soon to be home , probably on the next day , and it was necessary that some little plan for meeting him should be concerted with his sister Mary . When she got up to the house , she went as usual into the morning sitting - room , and was startled by perceiving , by a stick , a great coat , and sundry parcels which were lying about , that Bold must already have returned . "
42558	42567	42551	42551	John	121	" said Mary , coming into the room ; "
42575	42576	42568	42568	he	121	" "
42587	42601	42578	42578	I	0	" said Eleanor , about to beat a retreat in her sudden dismay . "
42616	42621	42622	42622	he	121	" said the other ; "
42647	42746	42637	42637	he	121	" Returns by the mail train to - night , thought Eleanor to herself , as she strove to screw up her courage — away again to - night — then it must be now or never ; and she again sat down , having risen to go . She wished the ordeal could have been postponed : she had fully made up her mind to do the deed , but she had not made up her mind to do it this very day ; and now she felt ill at ease , astray , and in difficulty . "
42749	42753	42747	42747	Mary	162	" she began , "
42764	42765	42747	42747	Mary	162	" "
42772	42777	42747	42747	Mary	162	" said the other ; "
42788	42941	42780	42780	he	121	" and she tried to treat it as a matter of course , but she was not the less surprised ; for Mary and Eleanor had daily talked over John Bold and his conduct , and his love , and Mary would insist on calling Eleanor her sister , and would scold her for not calling Bold by his christian name ; and Eleanor would half confess her love , but like a modest maiden would protest against such familiarities even with the name of her lover : and so they talked hour after hour , and Mary Bold , who was much the elder , looked forward with happy confidence to the day when Eleanor would not be ashamed to call her , her sister . She was , however , fully sure that just at present Eleanor would be much more likely to avoid her brother than to seek him . "
42964	43023	42944	42944	I	0	" and she spoke with a solemn air , not at all usual to her ; and then she went on , and opened to her friend all her plan , her well - weighed scheme for saving her father from a sorrow which would , she said , if it lasted , bring him to his grave . "
43027	43031	43025	43025	Mary	162	" she continued , "
43085	43330	43332	43332	I	0	" and this she said with a staid and solemn air , quite worthy of Jephthah 's daughter or of Iphigenia either . It was quite clear that Mary Bold did not follow the argument : that Eleanor Harding should appeal , on behalf of her father , to Bold 's better feelings , seemed to Mary quite natural ; it seemed quite natural that he should relent , overcome by such filial tears , and by so much beauty ; but , to her thinking , it was at any rate equally natural , that having relented , John should put his arm round his mistress 's waist , and say , ' Now having settled that , let us be man and wife , and all will end happily ! ' Why him good nature should not be rewarded , when such reward would operate to the disadvantage of none , Mary , who had more sense than romance , could not understand ; and she said as much . Eleanor , however , was firm , and made quite an eloquent speech to support her own view of the question : she could not condescend , she said , to ask such a favour on any other terms than those proposed . Mary might , perhaps , think her high - flown , but she had her own ideas , and she could not submit to sacrifice her self - respect . "
43340	43344	43332	43332	I	0	" pleaded Mary ; "
43359	43416	43346	43346	I	0	" Eleanor was going to make another speech , but a tear came to each eye , and she could not ; so she pretended to blow her nose , and walked to the window , and made a little inward call on her own courage , and finding herself somewhat sustained , said sententiously , — "
43423	43424	43346	43346	I	0	" "
43431	43458	43426	43426	you	1284	" said Mary , who had followed her friend to the window , and now spoke with her arms close wound round the other 's waist . "
43478	43479	43480	43480	I	0	" "
43481	43683	43685	43685	him	1287	" commenced Eleanor , turning sharply round to refute the charge ; but the intended falsehood stuck in her throat , and never came to utterance . She could not deny her love , so she took plentifully to tears , and leant upon her friend 's bosom and sobbed there , and protested that , love or no love , it would make no difference in her resolve , and called Mary , a thousand times , the most cruel of girls , and swore her to secrecy by a hundred oaths , and ended by declaring that the girl who could betray her friend 's love , even to a brother , would be as black a traitor as a soldier in a garrison who should open the city gates to the enemy . While they were yet discussing the matter , Bold returned , and Eleanor was forced into sudden action : she had either to accomplish or abandon her plan ; and having slipped into her friend 's bedroom , as the gentleman closed the hall door , she washed the marks of tears from her eyes , and resolved within herself to go through with it . "
43690	43694	43686	43686	I	0	" said she , "
43711	44437	43703	43703	you	1287	" So Mary informed her brother , with a somewhat sombre air , that Miss Harding was in the next room , and was coming to speak to him . Eleanor was certainly thinking more of her father than herself , as she arranged her hair before the glass , and removed the traces of sorrow from her face , and yet I should be untrue if I said that she was not anxious to appear well before her lover : why else was she so sedulous with that stubborn curl that would rebel against her hand , and why did she smooth so eagerly her ruffled ribands ? why else did she damp her eyes to dispel the redness , and bite her pretty lips to bring back the colour ? Of course she was anxious to look her best , for she was but a mortal angel after all . But had she been immortal , had she flitted back to the sitting room on a cherub 's wings , she could not have had a more faithful heart , or a truer wish to save her father at any cost to herself . John Bold had not met her since the day when she left him in dudgeon in the cathedral close . Since that his whole time had been occupied in promoting the cause against her father , and not unsuccessfully . He had often thought of her , and turned over in his mind a hundred schemes for showing her how disinterested was his love . He would write to her and beseech her not to allow the performance of a public duty to injure him in her estimation ; he would write to Mr. Harding , explain all his views , and boldly claim the warden 's daughter , urging that the untoward circumstances between them need be no bar to their ancient friendship , or to a closer tie ; he would throw himself on his knees before his mistress ; he would wait and marry the daughter when the father had lost his home and his income ; he would give up the lawsuit and go to Australia , with her of course , leaving the Jupiter and Mr. Finney to complete the case between them . Sometimes as he woke in the morning fevered and impatient , he would blow out his brains and have done with all his cares — but this idea was generally consequent on an imprudent supper enjoyed in company with Tom Towers . How beautiful Eleanor appeared to him as she slowly walked into the room ! Not for nothing had all those little cares been taken . Though her sister , the archdeacon 's wife , had spoken slightingly of her charms , Eleanor was very beautiful when seen aright . Hers was not of those impassive faces , which have the beauty of a marble bust ; finely chiselled features , perfect in every line , true to the rules of symmetry , as lovely to a stranger as to a friend , unvarying unless in sickness , or as age affects them . She had no startling brilliancy of beauty , no pearly whiteness , no radiant carnation : she had not the majestic contour that rivets attention , demands instant wonder , and then disappoints by the coldness of its charms . You might pass Eleanor Harding in the street without notice , but you could hardly pass an evening with her and not lose your heart . She had never appeared more lovely to her lover than she now did . Her face was animated though it was serious , and her full dark lustrous eyes shone with anxious energy ; her hand trembled as she took his , and she could hardly pronounce his name , when she addressed him . Bold wished with all his heart that the Australian scheme was in the act of realisation , and that he and Eleanor were away together , never to hear further of the lawsuit . He began to talk , asked after her health — said something about London being very stupid , and more about Barchester being very pleasant : declared the weather to be very hot , and then inquired after Mr. Harding . "
44445	44481	44482	44482	I	0	" said Eleanor . John Bold was very sorry , so sorry : he hoped it was nothing serious , and put on the unmeaningly solemn face , which people usually use on such occasions . "
44543	44544	44533	44533	you	0	" "

44631	44660	44661	44661	He	191	" Here Eleanor had recourse to her handkerchief , and so also had her auditors ; but she plucked up her courage and went on with her tale . "
44690	44714	44680	44680	you	122	" John Bold eagerly protested that it was not , but his heart smote him as to his intimate alliance with Tom Towers . "
44800	44801	44781	44781	they	1126	" "
44813	44814	44811	44811	I	0	" "
44817	44837	44811	44811	I	0	" continued Eleanor , interrupting him , for she was now in the full flood tide of her eloquence ; "
44895	44927	44887	44887	papa	2730	" Both her auditors , brother and sister , assented to this , and declared on their own knowledge that no man lived less addicted to filthy lucre than the warden . "
45034	45040	45031	45032	the archdeacon	382	" Eleanor was going to say "
45045	45066	45031	45032	the archdeacon	382	" but she stopped herself before she had compromised her father 's dignity ; and giving a long sigh , she added—"Oh
45075	45076	45077	45083	No one who knows Mr. Harding personally	1313	" "
45091	45095	45086	45086	him	102	" said Bold . "
45112	45116	45108	45108	he	102	" said Eleanor ; "
45153	45196	45134	45134	he	102	" and here she broke down , and the violence of her sobs stopped her utterance . Bold , for the fifth or sixth time , declared that neither he nor any of his friends imputed any blame personally to Mr. Harding . "
45204	45228	45266	45267	Mr. Bold	122	" ejaculated Eleanor through her tears , forgetting in her eagerness that her intention had been to humble herself as a suppliant before John Bold—"why
45250	45264	45249	45250	Mr. Bold,"—and	195	Bold,"—and she turned towards him as though the kneeling scene were about to be commenced—"oh
45286	45419	45420	45421	Mr. Bold	122	" To speak the truth , the reformer 's punishment was certainly come upon him , for his present plight was not enviable ; he had nothing for it but to excuse himself by platitudes about public duty , which it is by no means worth while to repeat , and to reiterate his eulogy on Mr. Harding 's character . His position was certainly a cruel one : had any gentlemen called upon him on behalf of Mr. Harding he could of course have declined to enter upon the subject ; but how could he do so with a beautiful girl , with the daughter of the man whom he had injured , with his own love ? In the meantime Eleanor recollected herself , and again summoned up her energies . "
45423	45427	45420	45421	Mr. Bold	122	" said she , "
45440	45454	45428	45428	I	0	" He stood up from his seat , and looked beyond measure distressed . "
45554	45648	45528	45529	Mr. Bold	122	" She did not absolutely kneel to him , but she followed him as he moved from his chair , and laid her soft hands imploringly upon his arm . Ah ! at any other time how exquisitely valuable would have been that touch ! but now he was distraught , dumbfounded , and unmanned . What could he say to that sweet suppliant ; how explain to her that the matter now was probably beyond his control ; how tell her that he could not quell the storm which he had raised ? "
45661	45666	45655	45655	you	194	" said his sister . "
45674	45678	45667	45667	I	0	" said he , "
45685	45686	45655	45655	you	194	" "
45692	45696	45689	45690	Mr. Bold	122	" said Eleanor , "
45724	45725	45726	45726	I	0	" "
45739	45748	45756	45756	she	1318	" said Bold , still addressing his sister ; "
45819	45820	45843	45843	you	0	" "
45827	45831	45843	45843	you	0	" ejaculated Eleanor , "
45856	45857	45860	45860	Eleanor	104	" "
45876	45877	45868	45868	me	0	" "
45884	45889	45868	45868	me	0	" she almost screamed ; "
45919	45939	45940	45940	I	0	" and seizing him by his arm and hand , she followed him across the room towards the door . "
45984	46002	45975	45975	you	0	" And she clung to him with fixed tenacity , and reiterated her resolve with hysterical passion . "
46012	46026	46010	46010	her	1328	" said Mary , bewildered by the unexpected vehemence of Eleanor 's manner ; "
46037	46038	46040	46040	me	0	" "
46045	46047	46040	46040	me	0	" said Eleanor;"say
46077	46154	46071	46071	I	0	" She still held him , and looked eagerly into his face , with her hair dishevelled , and her eyes all bloodshot . She had no thought now of herself , no care now for her appearance , and yet he thought he had never seen her half so lovely ; he was amazed at the intensity of her beauty , and could hardly believe that it was she whom he had dared to love . "
46158	46162	46156	46156	me	0	" said she ; "
46174	46175	46176	46176	I	0	" "
46179	46185	46186	46186	I	0	" said he at length , "
46198	46199	46202	46203	God Almighty	159	" "
46211	46559	46560	46561	Mr. Bold	122	" said Eleanor ; and falling on her knees with her face on Mary 's lap , she wept and sobbed like a child : her strength had carried her through her allotted task , but now it was well nigh exhausted . In a while she was partly recovered , and got up to go , and would have gone , had not Bold made her understand that it was necessary for him to explain to her how far it was in his power to put an end to the proceedings which had been taken against Mr. Harding . Had he spoken on any other subject , she would have vanished , but on that she was bound to hear him ; and now the danger of her position commenced . While she had an active part to play , while she clung to him as a suppliant , it was easy enough for her to reject his proffered love , and cast from her his caressing words ; but now — now that he had yielded , and was talking to her calmly and kindly as to her father 's welfare , it was hard enough for her to do so . Then Mary Bold assisted her , but now she was quite on her brother 's side . Mary said but little , but every word she did say gave some direct and deadly blow . The first thing she did was to make room for her brother between herself and Eleanor on the sofa : as the sofa was full large for three , Eleanor could not resent this , nor could she show suspicion by taking another seat ; but she felt it to be a most unkind proceeding . And then Mary would talk as though they three were joined in some close peculiar bond together ; as though they were in future always to wish together , contrive together , and act together ; and Eleanor could not gainsay this ; she could not make another speech , and say , "
46577	46870	46563	46563	I	0	" He explained to her that , though undoubtedly the proceeding against the hospital had commenced solely with himself , many others were now interested in the matter , some of whom were much more influential than himself : that it was to him alone , however , that the lawyers looked for instruction as to their doings , and , more important still , for the payment of their bills ; and he promised that he would at once give them notice that it was his intention to abandon the cause . He thought , he said , that it was not probable that any active steps would be taken after he had seceded from the matter , though it was possible that some passing allusion might still be made to the hospital in the daily Jupiter . He promised , however , that he would use his best influence to prevent any further personal allusion being made to Mr. Harding . He then suggested that he would on that afternoon ride over himself to Dr. Grantly , and inform him of his altered intentions on the subject , and with this view , he postponed his immediate return to London . This was all very pleasant , and Eleanor did enjoy a sort of triumph in the feeling that she had attained the object for which she had sought this interview ; but still the part of Iphigenia was to be played out . The gods had heard her prayer , granted her request , and were they not to have their promised sacrifice ? Eleanor was not a girl to defraud them wilfully ; so , as soon as she decently could , she got up for her bonnet . "
46877	46906	46872	46872	you	1331	" said Bold , who half - an - hour since would have given a hundred pounds that he was in London , and she still at Barchester . "
46910	46914	46872	46872	you	1331	" said she . "
46931	46946	46952	46952	him	2730	" ( she did not , quite appreciate all her father 's feelings ) ; "
46965	46966	46955	46955	I	0	" "
46977	46981	46969	46969	I	0	" said Bold . "
46991	47003	47004	47004	Mary	162	" said Mary , in the act of leaving the room . "
47008	47021	46982	46982	I	0	" said she , getting up and catching her by her dress , "
47033	47094	47026	47026	I	0	" but Mary , the traitress , stood fast by the door , and permitted no such retreat . Poor Iphigenia ! And with a volley of impassioned love , John Bold poured forth the feelings of his heart , swearing , as men do , some truths and many falsehoods ; and Eleanor repeated with every shade of vehemence the "
47101	47138	47026	47026	I	0	" which had had a short time since so much effect ; but now , alas ! its strength was gone . Let her be never so vehement , her vehemence was not respected ; all her "
47145	47467	47468	47468	I	0	" were met with counter asseverations , and at last were overpowered . The ground was cut from under her on every side : she was pressed to say whether her father would object ; whether she herself had any aversion ( aversion ! God help her , poor girl ! the word nearly made her jump into his arms ) ; any other preference ( this she loudly disclaimed ) ; whether it was impossible that she should love him ( Eleanor could not say that it was impossible ): and so at last , all her defences demolished , all her maiden barriers swept away , she capitulated , or rather marched out with the honours of war , vanquished evidently , palpably vanquished , but still not reduced to the necessity of confessing it . And so the altar on the shore of the modern Aulis reeked with no sacrifice . Whether or no the ill - natured prediction made by certain ladies in the beginning of the last chapter , was or was not carried out to the letter , I am not in a position to state ; Eleanor , however , certainly did feel herself to have been baffled , as she returned home with all her news to her father . Certainly she had been victorious , certainly she had achieved her object , certainly she was not unhappy , and yet she did not feel herself triumphant . Everything would run smooth now . Eleanor was not at all addicted to the Lydian school of romance ; she by no means objected to her lover because he came in at the door under the name of Absolute , instead of pulling her out of a window under the name of Beverley ; and yet she felt that she had been imposed upon , and could hardly think of Mary Bold with sisterly charity . "
47477	47487	47475	47475	Mary	162	" she said to herself over and over again . "
47507	47985	47490	47490	she	162	" Eleanor , however , felt that the game was up , and that she had now nothing further to do , but to add to the budget of news which was prepared for her father , that John Bold was her accepted lover . We will , however , now leave her on her way , and go with John Bold to Plumstead Episcopi , merely premising that Eleanor on reaching home will not find things so smooth as she fondly expected ; two messengers had come , one to her father , and the other to the archdeacon , and each of them much opposed to her quiet mode of solving all their difficulties ; the one in the shape of a number of the Jupiter , and the other in that of a further opinion from Sir Abraham Haphazard . John Bold got on his horse and rode off to Plumstead Episcopi ; not briskly and with eager spur , as men do ride when self - satisfied with their own intentions , but slowly , modestly , thoughtfully , and somewhat in dread of the coming interview . Now and again he would recur to the scene which was just over , support himself by the remembrance of the silence that gives consent , and exult as a happy lover ; but even this feeling was not without a shade of remorse . Had he not shown himself childishly weak thus to yield up the resolve of many hours of thought to the tears of a pretty girl ? How was he to meet his lawyer ? How was he to back out of a matter in which his name was already so publicly concerned ? What , oh what ! was he to say to Tom Towers ? While meditating these painful things he reached the lodge leading up to the archdeacon 's glebe , and for the first time in his life found himself within the sacred precincts . All the doctor 's children were together on the slope of the lawn close to the road , as Bold rode up to the hall door . They were there holding high debate on matters evidently of deep interest at Plumstead Episcopi , and the voices of the boys had been heard before the lodge gate was closed . Florinda and Grizzel , frightened at the sight of so well - known an enemy to the family , fled on the first appearance of the horseman , and ran in terror to their mother 's arms ; not for them was it , tender branches , to resent injuries , or as members of a church militant to put on armour against its enemies : but the boys stood their ground like heroes , and boldly demanded the business of the intruder . "
47996	48054	48055	48055	Henry	116	" said Henry , with a defiant eye and a hostile tone , which plainly said that at any rate no one there wanted to see the person so addressed ; and as he spoke he brandished aloft his garden water - pot , holding it by the spout , ready for the braining of any one . "
48057	48071	48055	48055	Henry	116	" said Charles James slowly , and with a certain dignity of diction , "
48111	48128	48131	48132	Mr. Bold	122	" But Samuel stepped lightly up to the horse 's head , and offered his services . "
48134	48138	48139	48139	papa	2730	" said he , "
48176	48189	48190	48190	papa	2730	" and he turned his head and winked funnily at his brother ; "
48231	48232	48228	48229	aunt Nelly	200	" "
48239	48245	48228	48229	aunt Nelly	200	" said Bold , dismounting ; "
48258	48259	48260	48260	Lads	1347	" "
48262	48286	48287	48287	lads	1347	" said Henry , turning on his heel and addressing himself to his brother , but loud enough to be heard by Bold ; "
48302	48990	48298	48298	he	2726	" Charles James condescended to say nothing further , but cocked his hat with much precision , and left the visitor to the care of his youngest brother . Samuel stayed till the servant came , chatting and patting the horse ; but as soon as Bold had disappeared through the front door , he stuck a switch under the animal 's tail to make him kick , if possible . The church reformer soon found himself tête à tête with the archdeacon in that same room , in that sanctum sanctorum of the rectory , to which we have already been introduced . As he entered he heard the click of a certain patent lock , but it struck him with no surprise : the worthy clergyman was no doubt hiding from eyes profane his last much - studied sermon , for the archdeacon , though he preached but seldom , was famous for his sermons . No room , Bold thought , could have been more becoming for a dignitary of the church ; each wall was loaded with theology ; over each separate book - case was printed in small gold letters the names of those great divines whose works were ranged beneath : beginning from the early fathers in due chronological order , there were to be found the precious labours of the chosen servants of the church down to the last pamphlet written in opposition to the consecration of Dr. Hampden ; and raised above this were to be seen the busts of the greatest among the great : Chrysostom , St. Augustine , Thomas à Becket , Cardinal Wolsey , Archbishop Laud , and Dr. Philpotts . Every appliance that could make study pleasant and give ease to the over - toiled brain was there : chairs made to relieve each limb and muscle ; reading - desks and writing - desks to suit every attitude ; lamps and candles mechanically contrived to throw their light on any favoured spot , as the student might desire ; a shoal of newspapers to amuse the few leisure moments which might be stolen from the labours of the day ; and then from the window a view right through a bosky vista along which ran a broad green path from the rectory to the church , at the end of which the tawny - tinted fine old tower was seen with all its variegated pinnacles and parapets . Few parish churches in England are in better repair , or better worth keeping so , than that at Plumstead Episcopi ; and yet it is built in a faulty style : the body of the church is low — so low , that the nearly flat leaden roof would be visible from the churchyard , were it not for the carved parapet with which it is surrounded . It is cruciform , though the transepts are irregular , one being larger than the other ; and the tower is much too high in proportion to the church : but the colour of the building is perfect ; it is that rich yellow grey which one finds nowhere but in the south and west of England , and which is so strong a characteristic of most of our old houses of Tudor architecture . The stone work also is beautiful ; the mullions of the windows and the thick tracery of the Gothic workmanship is as rich as fancy can desire ; and though in gazing on such a structure , one knows by rule that the old priests who built it , built it wrong , one can not bring oneself to wish that they should have made it other than it is . When Bold was ushered into the book - room , he found its owner standing with his back to the empty fire - place ready to receive him , and he could not but perceive that that expansive brow was elated with triumph , and that those full heavy lips bore more prominently than usual an appearance of arrogant success . "
48996	48998	48993	48994	Mr. Bold	122	" said he,—"well

49079	49157	49065	49066	Mr. Bold	122	" Dr. Grantly was standing himself , and he did not ask Bold to sit , and therefore he had to tell his tale standing , leaning on the table , with his hat in his hand . He did , however , manage to tell it ; and as the archdeacon never once interrupted him , or even encouraged him by a single word , he was not long in coming to the end of it . "

50256	50304	50305	50306	Dr. Grantly	106	" Bold was now choking with passion ; he had let the archdeacon run on , because he knew not with what words to interrupt him ; but now that he had been so defied and insulted , he could not leave the room without some reply . "
50308	50312	50305	50306	Dr. Grantly	106	" he commenced . "
50323	50328	50305	50306	Dr. Grantly	106	" said the archdeacon ; "

50477	50539	50474	50475	Mr. Bold	122	" and the doctor stalked into his own drawing - room , closing the door behind him , and making it quite impossible that John Bold should speak another word . As he got on his horse , which he was fain to do feeling like a dog turned out of a kitchen , he was again greeted by little Sammy . "
50572	50804	50563	50563	papa	2730	" That was certainly the bitterest moment in John Bold 's life ; not even the remembrance of his successful love could comfort him ; nay , when he thought of Eleanor , he felt that it was that very love which had brought him to such a pass . That he should have been so insulted , and be unable to reply ! That he should have given up so much to the request of a girl , and then have had his motives so misunderstood ! That he should have made so gross a mistake as this visit of his to the archdeacon 's ! He bit the top of his whip , till he penetrated the horn of which it was made : he struck the poor animal in his anger , and then was doubly angry with himself at his futile passion . He had been so completely check - mated , so palpably overcome ! and what was he to do ? He could not continue his action after pledging himself to abandon it ; nor was there any revenge in that — it was the very step to which his enemy had endeavoured to goad him ! He threw the reins to the servant who came to take his horse , and rushed up stairs into his drawingroom , where his sister Mary was sitting . "
50811	50815	50808	50809	a devil	1397	" said he , "
50828	50971	50825	50826	Dr. Grantly	106	" He vouchsafed her no further intelligence , but again seizing his hat , he rushed out , and took his departure for London without another word to any one . The meeting between Eleanor and her father was not so stormy as that described in the last chapter , but it was hardly more successful . On her return from Bold 's house , she found her father in a strange state . He was not sorrowful and silent as he had been on that memorable day when his son - in - law lectured him as to all that he owed to his order ; nor was he in his usual quiet mood . When Eleanor reached the hospital , he was walking quickly to and fro upon the lawn , and she soon saw that he was much excited . "
50981	50991	50994	50994	papa	2730	" he said as soon as he saw her . "
50996	50997	50994	50994	papa	2730	" "
51027	51028	51031	51031	papa	2730	" "
51037	51048	51031	51031	papa	2730	" said she , leading him by the arm into the house—"I
51067	51228	51058	51058	you	2730	" and then , before he could let her know what had caused this sudden resolve , or could point to the fatal paper which lay on the table , she told him that the lawsuit was over , that Bold had commissioned her to assure her father in his name that it would be abandoned , that there was no further cause for misery , that the whole matter might be looked on as though it had never been discussed . She did not tell him with what determined vehemence she had obtained this concession in his favour , nor did she mention the price she was to pay for it . The warden did not express himself peculiarly gratified at this intelligence , and Eleanor , though she had not worked for thanks , and was by no means disposed to magnify her own good offices , felt hurt at the manner in which her news was received . "
51241	51245	51234	51234	he	122	" said he ; "
51274	51275	51278	51278	papa	2730	" "
51280	51288	51278	51278	papa	2730	" she exclaimed , all but crying with vexation—"I
51306	51307	51297	51297	I	0	" "
51311	51315	51308	51309	Mr. Bold	122	" continued he , "
51341	51498	51499	51499	We	1407	" and the warden , doubling up a number of the Jupiter , pointed to the peculiar article which she was to read . It was to the last of the three leaders , which are generally furnished daily for the support of the nation , that Mr. Harding directed her attention . It dealt some heavy blows on various clerical delinquents ; on families who had received their tens of thousands yearly for doing nothing ; on men who , as the article stated , rolled in wealth which they had neither earned nor inherited , and which was in fact stolen from the poorer clergy . It named some sons of bishops , and grandsons of archbishops ; men great in their way , who had redeemed their disgrace in the eyes of many by the enormity of their plunder ; and then having disposed of these leviathans , it descended to Mr. Harding . "
51689	51772	51773	51773	We	1423	" The case is certainly a paltry one after the tens of thousands with which we have been dealing , for the warden 's income is after all but a poor eight hundred a year : eight hundred a year is not magnificent preferment of itself , and the warden may , for anything we know , be worth much more to the church ; but if so , let the church pay him out of funds justly at its own disposal . "
51936	52006	51916	51934	a clergyman of the Church of England who could allow such an argument to be put into his mouth	1434	" If this plea be put forward , we trust Mr. Harding will be forced as a witness to state the nature of his employment ; the amount of work that he does ; the income which he receives , and the source from whence he obtained his appointment . We do not think he will receive much public sympathy to atone for the annoyance of such an examination . "
52035	52041	52043	52043	he	293	" Well , my dear , "
52045	52065	52043	52043	he	293	" what do you think of that — is it worth while to be a warden at that price ? "
52066	52074	52114	52114	he	293	" Oh , papa — dear papa . "
52075	52111	52114	52114	he	293	" Mr. Bold ca n't unwrite that my dear — Mr. Bold ca n't say that that sha n't be read by every clergyman at Oxford ; nay , by every gentleman in the land : "
52133	52144	52145	52145	he	293	" and I 'll tell you what , my dear , "
52162	52184	52145	52145	he	293	" Mr. Bold ca n't dispute the truth of every word in that article you have just read — nor can I. "
52201	52239	52241	52241	he	293	" Nor can I , Eleanor : that 's the worst of all , or would be so if there were no remedy ; I have thought much of all this since we were together last night ; "
52261	52292	52241	52241	he	293	" I have thought much of what the archdeacon has said , and of what this paper says ; and I do believe I have no right to be here . "
52293	52305	52250	52250	his	293	" No right to be warden of the hospital , papa ? "
52306	52366	52241	52241	he	293	" No right to be warden with eight hundred a year ; no right to be warden with such a house as this ; no right to spend in luxury money that was intended for charity . Mr. Bold may do as he pleases about his suit , but I hope he will not abandon it for my sake . "
52688	52700	52702	52703	the warden	318	" They shall not put forward this plea on my behalf , "
52705	52781	52702	52703	the warden	318	" Whatever may be the truth of the matter , that at any rate is not true ; and the man who wrote that article is right in saying that such a plea is revolting to an honest mind . I will go up to London , my dear , and see these lawyers myself , and if no better excuse can be made for me than that , I and the hospital will part . "
52782	52789	52819	52819	his	318	" But the archdeacon , papa ? "
52790	52814	52817	52817	he	318	" I ca n't help it , my dear ; there are some things which a man can not bear,—I can not bear that "
52825	52834	52817	52817	he	318	" But will the archdeacon go with you ? "
53059	53066	53068	53068	he	102	" No , I think not , "
53070	53092	53068	53068	he	102	" I think I shall start before the archdeacon could be ready — I shall go early to - morrow morning . "
53093	53101	53103	53103	Eleanor	104	" That will be best , papa , "
53114	53246	53247	53247	Eleanor	104	" Why , yes , my love : the fact is , I wish to do all this before the archdeacon can — can interfere . There is a great deal of truth in all he says — he argues very well , and I ca n't always answer him ; but there is an old saying , Nelly , ' every one knows where his own shoe pinches ! ' He 'll say that I want moral courage , and strength of character , and power of endurance , and it 's all true ; but I 'm sure I ought not to remain here , if I have nothing better to put forward than a quibble : so , Nelly , we shall have to leave this pretty place . "
53265	53271	53273	53273	he	293	" True , my love , "
53286	53309	53273	53273	he	293	" What good to us is this place or all the money , if we are to be ill - spoken of ? "
53310	53320	53254	53254	she	104	" Oh , papa , I am so glad . "
53321	53379	53273	53273	he	293	" My darling child . It did cost me a pang at first , Nelly , to think that you should lose your pretty drawing - room , and your ponies , and your garden : the garden will be the worst of all — but there is a garden at Crabtree , a very pretty garden . "
53610	53613	53615	53616	the warden	318	" Yes , "
53619	53639	53615	53616	the warden	318	" there is a very pretty garden at Crabtree , but I shall be sorry to disturb poor Smith . "
53710	53721	53692	53692	she	104	" But we will take the music , my dear . "
53840	53858	53837	53838	my love	1059	" he ended by saying,—to whom I firmly believe that I can trust my treasure with safety . "
53859	53867	53837	53838	my love	1059	" But what will Dr. Grantly say ? "
53868	53888	53837	53838	my love	1059	" Well , my dear , it ca n't be helped — we shall be out at Crabtree then . "

57511	57875	57882	57882	you	121	" but what member of Parliament had half his power ? It is true that in far - off provinces men did not talk daily of Tom Towers , but they read the Jupiter , and acknowledged that without the Jupiter life was not worth having . This kind of hidden but still conscious glory suited the nature of the man . He loved to sit silent in a corner of his club and listen to the loud chattering of politicians , and to think how they all were in his power — how he could smite the loudest of them , were it worth his while to raise his pen for such a purpose . He loved to watch the great men of whom he daily wrote , and flatter himself that he was greater than any of them . Each of them was responsible to his country , each of them must answer if inquired into , each of them must endure abuse with good humour , and insolence without anger . But to whom was he , Tom Towers , responsible ? No one could insult him ; no one could inquire into him . He could speak out withering words , and no one could answer him : ministers courted him , though perhaps they knew not his name ; bishops feared him ; judges doubted their own verdicts unless he confirmed them ; and generals , in their councils of war , did not consider more deeply what the enemy would do , than what the Jupiter would say . Tom Towers never boasted of the Jupiter ; he scarcely ever named the paper even to the most intimate of his friends ; he did not even wish to be spoken of as connected with it ; but he did not the less value his privileges , or think the less of his own importance . It is probable that Tom Towers considered himself the most powerful man in Europe ; and so he walked on from day to day , studiously striving to look a man , but knowing within his breast that he was a god . "
57889	57890	57884	57884	You	121	" "
57902	58023	57900	57900	you	121	" When one Esquimaux meets another , do the two , as an invariable rule , ask after each other 's health ? is it inherent in all human nature to make this obliging inquiry ? Did any reader of this tale ever meet any friend or acquaintance without asking some such question , and did any one ever listen to the reply ? Sometimes a studiously courteous questioner will show so much thought in the matter as to answer it himself , by declaring that had he looked at you he need n't have asked ; meaning thereby to signify that you are an absolute personification of health : but such persons are only those who premeditate small effects . "
58030	58047	58026	58026	you	121	" inquired Bold . Why , yes , rather ; or I should say rather not : "
58061	58062	58048	58048	I	0	" "
58078	58116	58069	58069	you	121	" Towers understood in a moment , from the tone of his friend 's voice , that the certain matter referred to the newspaper . He smiled , and nodded his head , but made no promise . "
58128	58149	58122	58122	I	0	" said Bold . Tom Towers intimated that he was aware of the action which was pending about the hospital . "
58157	58182	58152	58152	I	0	" Tom Towers merely raised his eyebrows , thrust his hands into his trousers ' pockets , and waited for his friend to proceed . "
58217	58218	58222	58226	the master of the place	1717	" "
58239	58247	58222	58226	the master of the place	1717	" said Tom Towers , interrupting him . "
58287	58313	58314	58314	I	0	" Bold 's heart misgave him as to Eleanor as he said this ; and yet he felt that what he said was not untrue . "
58327	58328	58314	58314	I	0	" "
58334	58338	58314	58314	I	0	" said Towers , "
58414	58472	58481	58481	I	0	" Bold could n't deny it , but thought it was one of those cases which required a good deal of management before any real good could be done . It was a pity that he had not considered this before he crept into the lion 's mouth , in the shape of an attorney 's office . "
58484	58488	58481	58481	I	0	" said Towers . "
58493	58495	58481	58481	I	0	" said Bold—"perhaps
58511	58512	58499	58499	I	0	" "
58570	59964	58566	58566	you	0	" and he threw a small pamphlet across the table , which was all but damp from the press . Bold had not seen it nor heard of it ; but he was well acquainted with the author of it — a gentleman whose pamphlets , condemnatory of all things in these modern days , had been a good deal talked about of late . Dr. Pessimist Anticant was a Scotchman , who had passed a great portion of his early days in Germany ; he had studied there with much effect , and had learnt to look with German subtilty into the root of things , and to examine for himself their intrinsic worth and worthlessness . No man ever resolved more bravely than he to accept as good nothing that was evil ; to banish from him as evil nothing that was good . ' Tis a pity that he should not have recognised the fact , that in this world no good is unalloyed , and that there is but little evil that has not in it some seed of what is goodly . Returning from Germany , he had astonished the reading public by the vigour of his thoughts , put forth in the quaintest language . He can not write English , said the critics . No matter , said the public ; we can read what he does write , and that without yawning . And so Dr. Pessimist Anticant became popular . Popularity spoilt him for all further real use , as it has done many another . While , with some diffidence , he confined his objurgations to the occasional follies or short - comings of mankind ; while he ridiculed the energy of the squire devoted to the slaughter of partridges , or the mistake of some noble patron who turned a poet into a gauger of beer barrels , it was all well ; we were glad to be told our faults and to look forward to the coming millennium , when all men , having sufficiently studied the works of Dr. Anticant , would become truthful and energetic . But the doctor mistook the signs of the times and the minds of men , instituted himself censor of things in general , and began the great task of reprobating everything and everybody , without further promise of any millennium at all . This was not so well ; and , to tell the truth , our author did not succeed in his undertaking . His theories were all beautiful , and the code of morals that he taught us certainly an improvement on the practices of the age . We all of us could , and many of us did , learn much from the doctor while he chose to remain vague , mysterious , and cloudy ; but when he became practical , the charm was gone . His allusion to the poet and the partridges was received very well . ' Oh , my poor brother , ' said he , ' slaughtered partridges a score of brace to each gun , and poets gauging ale barrels , with sixty pounds a - year , at Dumfries , are not the signs of a great era ! perhaps of the smallest possible era yet written of . Whatever economies we pursue , political or other , let us see at once that this is the maddest of the uneconomic : partridges killed by our land magnates at , shall we say , a guinea a - head , to be retailed in Leadenhall at one shilling and ninepence , with one poacher in limbo for every fifty birds ! our poet , maker , creator , gauging ale , and that badly , with no leisure for making or creating , only a little leisure for drinking , and such like beer - barrel avocations ! Truly , a cutting of blocks with fine razors while we scrape our chins so uncomfortably with rusty knives ! Oh , my political economist , master of supply and demand , division of labour and high pressure — oh , my loud - speaking friend , tell me , if so much be in you , what is the demand for poets in these kingdoms of Queen Victoria , and what the vouchsafed supply ? ' This was all very well ; this gave us some hope . We might do better with our next poet , when we got one ; and though the partridges might not be abandoned , something could perhaps be done as to the poachers . We were unwilling , however , to take lessons in politics from so misty a professor ; and when he came to tell us that the heroes of Westminster were naught , we began to think that he had written enough . His attack upon despatch boxes was not thought to have much in it ; but as it is short , the doctor shall again be allowed to speak his sentiments : — ' Could utmost ingenuity in the management of red tape avail anything to men lying gasping — we may say , all but dead ; could despatch boxes with never - so - much velvet lining and Chubb 's patent , be of comfort to a people in extremis , I also , with so many others , would , with parched tongue , call on the name of Lord John Russell ; or , my brother , at your advice , on Lord Aberdeen ; or , my cousin , on Lord Derby , at yours ; being , with my parched tongue , indifferent in such matters . ' Tis all one . Oh , Derby ! Oh , Gladstone ! Oh , Palmerston ! Oh , Lord John ! Each comes running with serene face and despatch box . Vain physicians ! though there were hosts of such , no despatch box will cure this disorder ! What ! are these other doctors ' new names , disciples who have not burdened their souls with tape ? Well , let us call again . Oh , Disraeli , great oppositionist , man of the bitter brow ! or , Oh , Molesworth , great reformer , thou who promisest Utopia . They come ; each with that serene face , and each — alas , me ! alas , my country!—each with a despatch box ! ' Oh , the serenity of Downing Street ! ' My brothers , when hope was over on the battle field , when no dimmest chance of victory remained , the ancient Roman could hide his face within his toga , and die gracefully . Can you and I do so now ? If so , ' t were best for us ; if not , oh my brothers , we must die disgracefully , for hope of life and victory I see none left to us in this world below . I for one can not trust much to serene face and despatch box ! ' There might be truth in this , there might be depth of reasoning ; but Englishmen did not see enough in the argument to induce them to withdraw their confidence from the present arrangements of the government , and Dr. Anticant 's monthly pamphlet on the decay of the world did not receive so much attention as his earlier works . He did not confine himself to politics in these publications , but roamed at large over all matters of public interest , and found everything bad . According to him nobody was true , and not only nobody , but nothing ; a man could not take off his hat to a lady without telling a lie — the lady would lie again in smiling . The ruffles of the gentleman 's shirt would be fraught with deceit , and the ladies ' flounces full of falsehood . Was ever anything more severe than that attack of his on chip bonnets , or the anathemas with which he endeavoured to dust the powder out of the bishops ' wigs ? The pamphlet which Tom Towers now pushed across the table was entitled "
59968	60018	58566	58566	you	0	" and was written with the view of proving how much in the way of charity was done by our predecessors — how little by the present age ; and it ended by a comparison between ancient and modern times , very little to the credit of the latter . "
60023	60047	60050	60057	the warden , who is so little selfish	1728	" said Towers , getting up and turning over the pages of the pamphlet , and pointing to a passage near the end ; "
60067	60752	60753	60753	You	1729	" Bold read as follows : — ' Heavens , what a sight ! Let us with eyes wide open see the godly man of four centuries since , the man of the dark ages : let us see how he does his godlike work , and , again , how the godly man of these latter days does his . ' Shall we say that the former is one walking painfully through the world , regarding , as a prudent man , his worldly work , prospering in it as a diligent man will prosper , but always with an eye to that better treasure to which thieves do not creep in ? Is there not much nobility in that old man , as , leaning on his oaken staff , he walks down the high street of his native town , and receives from all courteous salutation and acknowledgment of his worth ? A noble old man , my august inhabitants of Belgrave Square and such like vicinity — a very noble old man , though employed no better than in the wholesale carding of wool . ' This carding of wool , however , did in those days bring with it much profit , so that our ancient friend , when dying , was declared , in whatever slang then prevailed , to cut up exceeding well . For sons and daughters there was ample sustenance , with assistance of due industry ; for friends and relatives some relief for grief at this great loss ; for aged dependants comfort in declining years . This was much for one old man to get done in that dark fifteenth century . But this was not all : coming generations of poor woolcarders should bless the name of this rich one ; and a hospital should be founded and endowed with his wealth for the feeding of such of the trade as could not , by diligent carding , any longer duly feed themselves . '' Twas thus that an old man in the fifteenth century did his godlike work to the best of his power , and not ignobly , as appears to me . ' We will now take our godly man of latter days . He shall no longer be a woolcarder , for such are not now men of mark . We will suppose him to be one of the best of the good — one who has lacked no opportunities . Our old friend was , after all , but illiterate ; our modern friend shall be a man educated in all seemly knowledge ; he shall , in short , be that blessed being — a clergyman of the Church of England ! ' And now , in what perfectest manner does he in this lower world get his godlike work done and put out of hand ? Heavens ! in the strangest of manners . Oh , my brother ! in a manner not at all to be believed but by the most minute testimony of eyesight . He does it by the magnitude of his appetite — by the power of his gorge ; his only occupation is to swallow the bread prepared with so much anxious care for these impoverished carders of wool — that , and to sing indifferently through his nose once in the week some psalm more or less long — the shorter the better , we should be inclined to say . ' Oh , my civilised friends!—great Britons that never will be slaves , men advanced to infinite state of freedom and knowledge of good and evil — tell me , will you , what becoming monument you will erect to an highly - educated clergyman of the Church of England ? ' Bold certainly thought that his friend would not like that : he could not conceive anything that he would like less than this . To what a world of toil and trouble had he , Bold , given rise by his indiscreet attack upon the hospital ! "
60756	60760	60753	60753	You	1729	" said Towers , "
60799	60847	60788	60788	you	1729	" No ; Bold had not seen the ' Almshouse . ' He had seen advertisements of Mr. Popular Sentiment 's new novel of that name , but had in no way connected it with Barchester Hospital , and had never thought a moment on the subject . "
60858	60940	60941	60941	Bold	121	" said Towers . It 'll go a long way to put down Rochester , and Barchester , and Dulwich , and St. Cross , and all such hotbeds of peculation . It 's very clear that Sentiment has been down to Barchester , and got up the whole story there ; indeed , I thought he must have had it all from you . It 's very well done , as you 'll see : his first numbers always are . "
60968	60979	60981	60981	Towers	190	" The fire has gone too far to be quenched , "
60983	61024	60981	60981	Towers	190	" the building must go now ; and as the timbers are all rotten , why , I should be inclined to say , the sooner the better . I expected to see you get some éclat in the matter . "
61263	61270	61272	61272	he	121	" I could n't continue it , "
61274	61284	61272	61272	he	121	" because I found I was in the wrong . "
61301	61306	61308	61308	he	121	" In that case , "
61310	61318	61308	61308	he	121	" of course you must abandon it . "
61319	61333	61335	61335	Bold	121	" And I called this morning to ask you also to abandon it , "
61337	61342	61344	61345	Tom Towers	190	" To ask me , "
61382	61385	61387	61387	Bold	121	" Yes , "
61394	61444	61387	61387	Bold	121	" The Jupiter , you know , has taken the matter up very strongly . Mr. Harding has felt what it has said deeply ; and I thought that if I could explain to you that he personally has not been to blame , these articles might be discontinued . "

61515	61525	61506	61506	he	190	" I really can not answer for the Jupiter . "
61526	61561	61492	61492	his	121	" But if you saw that these articles were unjust , I think you would endeavour to put a stop to them : of course nobody doubts that you could , if you chose . "
61562	61578	61506	61506	he	190	" Nobody and everybody are always very kind , but unfortunately are generally very wrong . "
61579	61586	61588	61588	Bold	121	" Come , come , Towers , "
61611	61655	61607	61607	his	121	" I have no doubt in my own mind but that you wrote the articles yourself ; and very well written they were : it will be a great favour if you will in future abstain from any personal allusion to poor Harding . "
61656	61661	61663	61664	Tom Towers	190	" My dear Bold , "
61666	61717	61663	61664	Tom Towers	190	" I have a sincere regard for you . I have known you for many years , and value your friendship ; I hope you will let me explain to you , without offence , that none who are connected with the public press can with propriety listen to interference . "
61718	61721	61723	61723	Bold	121	" Interference ! "
61725	61733	61723	61723	Bold	121	" I do n't want to interfere . "
61734	61806	61663	61664	Tom Towers	190	" Ah , but my dear fellow , you do ; what else is it ? You think that I am able to keep certain remarks out of a newspaper . Your information is probably incorrect , as most public gossip on such subjects is ; but , at any rate , you think I have such power , and you ask me to use it : now that is interference . "
61807	61818	61663	61664	Tom Towers	190	" Well , if you choose to call it so . "
61819	61987	61723	61723	Bold	121	" And now suppose for a moment that I had this power , and used it as you wish : is n't it clear that it would be a great abuse ? Certain men are employed in writing for the public press ; and if they are induced either to write or to abstain from writing by private motives , surely the public press would soon be of little value . Look at the recognised worth of different newspapers , and see if it does not mainly depend on the assurance which the public feel that such a paper is , or is not , independent . You alluded to the Jupiter : surely you can not but see that the weight of the Jupiter is too great to be moved by any private request , even though it should be made to a much more influential person than myself : you 've only to think of this , and you 'll see that I am right . "
62023	62029	62031	62031	he	190	" The public is defrauded , "
62033	62043	62031	62031	he	190	" whenever private considerations are allowed to have weight . "

64975	65043	64946	64946	he	102	" No , it can be no Christian country , in which the head of the bar , the lagal adviser ( loud laughter and cheers)—yes , I say the lagal adviser of the crown ( great cheers and laughter,—can stand up in his seat in this house ( prolonged cheers and laughter ) , and attempt to lagalise indacent assaults on the bodies of religious ladies .

Better take the cigar , sir — you can always give it to a friend you know . Well , sir , thank ye , sir — as you are so good , I 'll smoke it myself . "
69346	69357	69359	69360	Sir Abraham	151	" Very sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Warden , "
69367	69406	69359	69360	Sir Abraham	151	" and sorry , too , to name so disagreeable an hour ; but your notice was short , and as you said to - day , I named the very earliest hour that was not disposed of . "
70081	70088	70090	70091	Sir Abraham	151	" And so , Mr. Warden , "
70093	70107	70090	70091	Sir Abraham	151	" all our trouble about this law - suit is at an end . "
70147	70197	70127	70128	Sir Abraham	151	" All over . You need trouble yourself no further about it ; of course they must pay the costs , and the absolute expense to you and Dr. Grantly will be trifling — that is , compared with what it might have been if it had been continued . "
70198	70211	70264	70264	he	102	" I fear I do n't quite understand you , Sir Abraham . "
70212	70230	70231	70232	Mr. Harding	102	" Do n't you know that their attorneys have noticed us that they have withdrawn the suit ? "
70319	70365	70366	70367	Sir Abraham	151	" I know I have no right to trouble you personally with this matter , but as it is of most vital importance to me , as all my happiness is concerned in it , I thought I might venture to seek your own advice . "
70400	70463	70380	70380	he	151	" A spoken word , Sir Abraham , is often of more value than volumes of written advice . The truth is , I am ill satisfied with this matter as it stands at present . I do see — I can not help seeing , that the affairs of the hospital are not arranged according to the will of the founder . "
70464	70492	70589	70590	Sir Abraham	151	" None of such institutions are , Mr. Harding , nor can they be ; the altered circumstances in which we live do not admit of it . "
70493	70588	70593	70593	he	151	" Quite true — that is quite true ; but I ca n't see that those altered circumstances give me a right to eight hundred a year . I do n't know whether I ever read John Hiram 's will , but were I to read it now I could not understand it . What I want you , Sir Abraham , to tell me , is this — am I , as warden , legally and distinctly entitled to the proceeds of the property , after the due maintenance of the twelve bedesmen ? "
70673	70680	70682	70685	the attorney - general	3508	" Nay , my dear sir , "
70687	70710	70682	70685	the attorney - general	3508	" there is no further ground for any question ; I do n't see that you have the power of raising it . "
70711	70716	70718	70719	Mr. Harding	102	" I can resign , "
70743	70751	70753	70756	the attorney - general	3508	" What ! throw it up altogether ? "
70766	70776	70778	70779	Mr. Harding	102	" Did you see those articles in the Jupiter ? "
70841	70848	70850	70850	he	151	" Had n't you better wait , "
70852	70879	70850	70850	he	151	" till Dr. Grantly is in town with you ? Would n't it be better to postpone any serious step till you can consult with him ? "
70900	70904	70906	70907	the latter	3357	" Of course , "
70909	70924	70906	70907	the latter	3357	" if you have private means sufficient for your wants , and if this — "
70925	70935	70937	70938	the warden	318	" I have n't a sixpence , Sir Abraham , "
70940	70957	70937	70938	the warden	318	" God bless me ! Why , Mr. Harding , how do you mean to live ? "
71069	71147	71062	71063	Sir Abraham	151	" I really think , Mr. Harding , you had better wait for the archdeacon . This is a most serious step : one for which , in my opinion , there is not the slightest necessity ; and , as you have done me the honour of asking my advice , I must implore you to do nothing without the approval of your friends . A man is never the best judge of his own position . "
71148	71199	71059	71059	his	102	" A man is the best judge of what he feels himself . I 'd sooner beg my bread till my death , than read such another article as those two that have appeared , and feel , as I do , that the writer has truth on his side . "
71200	71212	71062	71063	Sir Abraham	151	" Have you not a daughter , Mr. Harding,—an unmarried daughter ? "
71213	71217	71219	71219	he	2170	" I have , "
71239	71257	71219	71219	he	2170	" I have , Sir Abraham ; and she and I are completely agreed on this subject . "
71258	71326	71327	71328	The warden	318	" Pray excuse me , Mr. Harding , if what I say seems impertinent : but surely it is you that should be prudent on her behalf . She is young , and does not know the meaning of living on an income of a hundred and fifty pounds a year . On her account give up this idea . Believe me , it is sheer Quixotism . "
71380	71400	71402	71403	the warden	318	" But if this income be not justly mine , what if she and I have both to beg ? "
71428	71439	71402	71403	the warden	318	" If so , it would be better to beg . "
71440	71451	71706	71706	he	2174	" My dear sir , nobody now questions its justness . "
71452	71694	71706	71706	he	2174	" Yes , Sir Abraham , one does question it,—the most important of all witnesses against me,—I question it myself . My God knows whether or no I love my daughter ; but I would sooner that she and I should both beg , than that she should live in comfort on money which is truly the property of the poor . It may seem strange to you , Sir Abraham , it is strange to myself , that I should have been ten years in that happy home , and not have thought of these things , till they were so roughly dinned into my ears . I can not boast of my conscience , when it required the violence of a public newspaper to awaken it ; but , now that it is awake , I must obey it . When I came here I did not know that the suit was withdrawn by Mr. Bold , and my object was to beg you to abandon my defence . As there is no action , there can be no defence ; but it is , at any rate , as well that you should know that , from to - morrow , I shall cease to be the warden of the hospital . My friends and I differ on this subject , Sir Abraham , and that adds much to my sorrow : but it can not be helped . "
71864	71879	71892	71893	the warden	318	" You 'll sleep on this , Mr. Harding , and to - morrow — "
71880	71890	71892	71893	the warden	318	" I have done more than sleep upon it , "
71895	71925	71892	71893	the warden	318	" I have laid awake upon it , and that night after night . I found I could not sleep upon it ; now I hope to do so . "
72238	72246	72248	72248	his	102	" Dr. Grantly is here , sir , "
72257	72277	72248	72248	his	102	" and Mrs. Grantly ; they have a sitting - room above , and are waiting up for you . "
72342	72354	72339	72339	he	318	" Oh , indeed ! I 'll go upstairs at once ; "
72470	72481	72483	72484	the lady	612	" Papa , I thought you were never coming back , "
72486	72492	72483	72484	the lady	612	" it 's twelve o'clock . "
72493	72499	72501	72502	the warden	318	" Yes , my dear , "
72504	72539	72501	72502	the warden	318	" The attorney - general named ten for my meeting ; to be sure ten is late , but what could I do , you know ? Great men will have their own way . "
72562	72574	72576	72577	the archdeacon	382	" And you have absolutely been with the attorney - general ? "
72586	72593	72579	72580	Mr. Harding	102	" Good heavens , how unfortunate ! "
72619	72646	72598	72598	his	382	" What will Sir Abraham think of it ? Did you not know that it is not customary for clients to go direct to their counsel ? "
72647	72652	72654	72655	the warden	318	" Is n't it ? "
72659	72684	72654	72655	the warden	318	" Well , at any rate , I 've done it now . Sir Abraham did n't seem to think it so very strange . "
72700	72713	72715	72716	the lady	612	" But , papa , what did you say to Sir Abraham ? "
72718	72757	72715	72716	the lady	612	" I asked him , my dear , to explain John Hiram 's will to me . He could n't explain it in the only way which would have satisfied me , and so I resigned the wardenship . "
72758	72762	72764	72765	the archdeacon	382	" Resigned it ! "
72802	72809	72764	72765	the archdeacon	382	" Resigned it ! Good heavens ! "
72827	72848	72811	72815	the dignitary of the church	2219	" At least I told Sir Abraham that I would resign ; and of course I must now do so . "
72849	72854	72856	72857	the archdeacon	382	" Not at all , "
72865	72910	72856	72857	the archdeacon	382	" Nothing that you say in such a way to your own counsel can be in any way binding on you ; of course you were there to ask his advice . I 'm sure , Sir Abraham did not advise any such step . "
72920	72930	72932	72936	the reverend cross - examiner	2222	" I am sure he disadvised you from it , "
72945	72960	72938	72939	Mr. Harding	102	" I 'm sure Sir Abraham must have advised you to consult your friends . "
72972	72991	72965	72966	Mr. Harding	102	" Then your threat of resignation amounts to nothing , and we are just where we were before . "
73143	73152	73154	73154	he	102	" You must be very tired , Susan , "
73156	73166	73154	73154	he	102	" would n't you like to go to bed ? "
73238	73241	73244	73244	he	382	" Why , "
73260	73291	73244	73244	he	382	" Why did you go off from Barchester so suddenly ? Why did you take such a step without giving us notice , after what had passed at the palace ? "
73340	73349	73351	73352	the lady	612	" Papa has been to much for you , "
73364	73368	73354	73355	The archdeacon	382	" Good heavens ! "
73381	73390	73392	73393	the warden	318	" I think I 'll go to bed , "
73401	73417	73419	73420	the archdeacon	382	" At any rate you 'll promise me to take no further step without consultation , "
73436	73440	73442	73443	the other	762	" Of course , "
73445	73510	73442	73443	the other	762	" such a declaration as that you made to Sir Abraham means nothing . Come , warden , promise me this . The whole affair , you see , is already settled , and that with very little trouble or expense . Bold has been compelled to abandon his action , and all you have to do is to remain quiet at the hospital . "
73564	73567	73569	73569	he	382	" Come , "
73571	73584	73569	73569	he	382	" promise Susan to give up this idea of resigning the wardenship . "
73618	73642	73605	73605	he	318	" I am sure Susan will not ask me to break my word , or to do what I know to be wrong . "
73643	73646	73648	73648	she	280	" Papa , "
73650	73670	73648	73648	she	280	" it would be madness in you to throw up your preferment . What are you to live on ? "
73671	73687	73689	73690	Mr. Harding	102	" God , that feeds the young ravens , will take care of me also , "
73711	73714	73716	73717	the archdeacon	382	" Pish ! "
73723	73742	73716	73717	the archdeacon	382	" if the ravens persisted in refusing the food prepared for them , they would n't be fed . "
73795	73804	73807	73808	the warden	318	" I shall have the living of Crabtree , "
73810	73816	73818	73819	the archdeacon	382	" Eighty pounds a year ! "
73821	73826	73828	73833	the father - in - law	2253	" And the precentorship , "
73835	73842	73844	73849	the son - in - law	2254	" It goes with the wardenship , "
73851	73873	73844	73849	the son - in - law	2254	" Mr. Harding was prepared to argue this point , and began to do so , but Dr. Grantly stopped him . "
73878	73882	73844	73849	the son - in - law	2254	" said he , "
73960	73961	73965	73965	I	0	" "
73970	73975	73965	73965	I	0	" said the warden . "
73981	73986	73965	73965	I	0	" continued the other , "
73998	73999	73965	73965	I	0	" "
74005	74015	74001	74001	I	0	" said the warden , very , very meekly . "

74037	74055	74035	74035	papa	2730	" said Mrs. Grantly , getting up , and putting her arm through that of her father , "
74068	74167	74172	74172	papa	2730	" A hot tear stood in each of the warden 's eyes as he looked round upon his married daughter . Why should one sister who was so rich predict poverty for another ? some such idea as this was on his mind , but he gave no utterance to it . Then he thought of the pelican feeding its young with blood from its own breast , but he gave no utterance to that either ; and then of Eleanor waiting for him at home , waiting to congratulate him on the end of all his trouble . "
74174	74179	74172	74172	papa	2730	" said Mrs. Grantly . "
74186	74191	74184	74184	her	104	" said her father . "
74201	74213	74193	74193	you	0	" The lady was really moved beyond her usual calm composure . "
74223	74227	74228	74228	I	0	" said he . "

74250	74261	74239	74240	Mr. Harding	102	" said the archdeacon , now moved beyond all endurance . "
74282	74301	74271	74271	you	0	" Mrs. Grantly suggested that , as the action was abandoned , the costs would not be heavy . "
74309	74313	74271	74271	you	0	" continued he . "
74340	74341	74342	74342	I	0	" "

74356	74367	74370	74370	archdeacon	2734	" ejaculated the other , with a most powerful sneer . "
74372	74377	74370	74370	archdeacon	2734	" said the lady , "
74397	74398	74388	74388	you	2734	" "
74407	74420	74405	74405	Job	141	" said the archdeacon , marching quickly up and down the room . "
74488	74542	74482	74482	I	0	" and he stood still at the fireplace , and looked at himself in a dingy mirror which stood on the chimney - piece . There was a pause for about a minute , and then the warden , finding that nothing else was coming , lighted his candle , and quietly said , "
74546	74547	74482	74482	I	0	" "
74553	74592	74551	74551	papa	2730	" said the lady . And so the warden retired ; but , as he closed the door behind him , he heard the well - known ejaculation — slower , lower , more solemn , more ponderous than ever—"Good
74595	75031	75032	75032	My	0	" The party met the next morning at breakfast ; and a very sombre affair it was — very unlike the breakfasts at Plumstead Episcopi . There were three thin , small , dry bits of bacon , each an inch long , served up under a huge old plated cover ; there were four three - cornered bits of dry toast , and four square bits of buttered toast ; there was a loaf of bread , and some oily - looking butter ; and on the sideboard there were the remains of a cold shoulder of mutton . The archdeacon , however , had not come up from his rectory to St. Paul 's Churchyard to enjoy himself , and therefore nothing was said of the scanty fare . The guests were as sorry as the viands — hardly anything was said over the breakfast table . The archdeacon munched his toast in ominous silence , turning over bitter thoughts in his deep mind . The warden tried to talk to his daughter , and she tried to answer him ; but they both failed . There were no feelings at present in common between them . The warden was thinking only of getting back to Barchester , and calculating whether the archdeacon would expect him to wait for him ; and Mrs. Grantly was preparing herself far a grand attack which she was to make on her father , as agreed upon between herself and her husband during their curtain confabulation of that morning . When the waiter had creaked out of the room with the last of the teacups , the archdeacon got up and went to the window , as though to admire the view . The room looked out on a narrow passage which runs from St. Paul 's Churchyard to Paternoster Row ; and Dr. Grantly patiently perused the names of the three shopkeepers whose doors were in view . The warden still kept his seat at the table , and examined the pattern of the table - cloth ; and Mrs. Grantly , seating herself on the sofa , began to knit . After awhile the warden pulled his Bradshaw out of his pocket , and began laboriously to consult it . There was a train for Barchester at 10 A.M. That was out of the question , for it was nearly ten already . Another at 3 P.M. ; another , the night - mail train , at 9 P.M. The three o'clock train would take him home to tea , and would suit very well . "

75077	75078	75079	75080	The archdeacon	382	" "

75126	75127	75117	75117	I	0	" "
75132	75145	75146	75146	You	2730	" said the archdeacon sotto voce ; but the warden heard him . "

75171	75195	75163	75163	I	0	" The tamest animal will turn when driven too hard , and even Mr. Harding was beginning to fight for his own way . "
75206	75215	75198	75198	you	2730	" said the lady , addressing her husband . "
75223	75228	75216	75216	I	0	" said the warden . "
75235	75252	75216	75216	I	0	" said the archdeacon , answering his wife , and still reading the shopkeepers ' names ; "
75264	75279	75257	75257	I	0	" There was another long pause , during which Mr. Harding continued to study his "
75282	75283	75257	75257	I	0	" "
75292	75299	75284	75284	I	0	" said the archdeacon at last . "
75307	75486	75303	75303	Cox	132	" said the warden . It was quite a matter of indifference to him where his son - in - law went . The names of Cox and Cumming had now no interest in his ears . What had he to do with Cox and Cumming further , having already had his suit finally adjudicated upon in a court of conscience , a judgment without power of appeal fully registered , and the matter settled so that all the lawyers in London could not disturb it . The archdeacon could go to Cox and Cumming , could remain there all day in anxious discussion ; but what might be said there was no longer matter of interest to him , who was so soon to lay aside the name of warden of Barchester Hospital . The archdeacon took up his shining new clerical hat , and put on his black new clerical gloves , and looked heavy , respectable , decorous , and opulent , a decided clergyman of the Church of England , every inch of him . "
75502	75512	75489	75489	I	0	" said he . The warden supposed he would . "
75536	75553	75513	75513	I	0	" and the archdeacon looked as though he thought a great deal were due to him , "
75564	75622	75623	75623	Papa	191	" and , without waiting for a reply , Dr. Grantly wended his way to Cox and Cumming . Mrs. Grantly waited till the last fall of her husband 's foot was heard , as he turned out of the court into St. Paul 's Churchyard , and then commenced her task of talking her father over . "
75625	75629	75623	75623	Papa	191	" she began , "
75637	75638	75623	75623	Papa	191	" "
75643	75652	75623	75623	Papa	191	" said the warden , ringing the bell . "
75665	75666	75670	75670	you	2285	" "
75676	75692	75670	75670	you	2285	" and he ordered the waiter to bring him pen , ink , and paper . "
75701	75702	75694	75694	you	2285	" "
75719	75720	75708	75708	I	0	" "

75801	75821	75824	75824	you	2730	" and she stopped while the waiter creaked in with the paper , and then slowly creaked out again ; "
75840	75871	75872	75872	You	2730	" The warden spread his paper on the table , placing it on the meagre blotting - book , which the hotel afforded , and sat himself down to write . "
75882	75887	75888	75888	you	2730	" continued his daughter ; "
75907	75908	75909	75909	My	0	" "
75912	75917	75909	75909	My	0	" said he naïvely , "
75935	75936	75927	75927	I	0	" "
75948	75952	75939	75939	you	2730	" said she . "
75985	75986	75989	75989	papa	2730	" "
75991	75992	75993	75993	Susan	103	" "
75995	75999	75989	75989	papa	2730	" said he , "
76056	76057	76062	76062	papa	2730	" "
76064	76065	76062	76062	papa	2730	" "
76106	77100	76099	76099	you	2307	" and , dipping his pen into the inkstand , he fixed his eyes intently on the paper . There was something in his manner which taught his daughter to perceive that he was in earnest ; she had at one time ruled supreme in her father 's house , but she knew that there were moments when , mild and meek as he was , he would have his way , and the present was an occasion of the sort . She returned , therefore , to her knitting , and very shortly after left the room . The warden was now at liberty to compose his letter , and , as it was characteristic of the man , it shall be given at full length . The official letter , which , when written , seemed to him to be too formally cold to be sent alone to so dear a friend , was accompanied by a private note ; and both are here inserted . The letter of resignation ran as follows : — ' Chapter Hotel , St. Paul 's , ' London,—August , 18 — ' My Lord Bishop , It is with the greatest pain that I feel myself constrained to resign into your Lordship 's hands the wardenship of the hospital at Barchester which you so kindly conferred upon me , now nearly twelve years since . I need not explain the circumstances which have made this step appear necessary to me . You are aware that a question has arisen as to the right of the warden to the income which has been allotted to the wardenship ; it has seemed to me that this right is not well made out , and I hesitate to incur the risk of taking an income to which my legal claim appears doubtful . The office of precentor of the cathedral is , as your Lordship is aware , joined to that of the warden ; that is to say , the precentor has for many years been the warden of the hospital ; there is , however , nothing to make the junction of the two offices necessary , and , unless you or the dean and chapter object to such an arrangement , I would wish to keep the precentorship . The income of this office will now be necessary to me ; indeed , I do not know why I should be ashamed to say that I should have difficulty in supporting myself without it . Your Lordship , and such others as you may please to consult on the matter , will at once see that my resignation of the wardenship need offer not the slightest bar to its occupation by another person . I am thought in the wrong by all those whom I have consulted in the matter ; I have very little but an inward and an unguided conviction of my own to bring me to this step , and I shall , indeed , be hurt to find that any slur is thrown on the preferment which your kindness bestowed on me , by my resignation of it . I , at any rate for one , shall look on any successor whom you may appoint as enjoying a clerical situation of the highest respectability , and one to which your Lordship 's nomination gives an indefeasible right . I can not finish this official letter without again thanking your Lordship for all your great kindness , and I beg to subscricbe myself ' Your Lordship 's most obedient servant , ' Septimus Harding , ' Warden of Barchester Hospital , and Precentor of the cathedral . ' He then wrote the following private note : — ' My dear Bishop , I can not send you the accompanying official letter without a warmer expression of thanks for all your kindness than would befit a document which may to a certain degree be made public . You , I know , will understand the feeling , and , perhaps , pity the weakness which makes me resign the hospital . I am not made of calibre strong enough to withstand public attack . Were I convinced that I stood on ground perfectly firm , that I was certainly justified in taking eight hundred a year under Hiram 's will , I should feel bound by duty to retain the position , however unendurable might be the nature of the assault ; but , as I do not feel this conviction , I can not believe that you will think me wrong in what I am doing . I had at one time an idea of keeping only some moderate portion of the income ; perhaps three hundred a year , and of remitting the remainder to the trustees ; but it occurred to me , and I think with reason , that by so doing I should place my successors in an invidious position , and greatly damage your patronage . My dear friend , let me have a line from you to say that you do not blame me for what I am doing , and that the officiating vicar of Crabtree Parva will be the same to you as the warden of the hospital . I am very anxious about the precentorship ; the archdeacon thinks it must go with the wardenship ; I think not , and that , having it , I can not be ousted . I will , however , be guided by you and the dean . No other duty will suit me so well , or come so much within my power of adequate performance . I thank you from my heart for the preferment which I am now giving up , and for all your kindness , and am , dear bishop , now as always , ' Yours most sincerely , "
77495	77499	77501	77501	he	102	" My dear , "
77536	77556	77563	77563	she	104	" I hope you 'll be able to feel a proper degree of respect for the vicar of Crabtree . "
77557	77561	77563	77563	she	104	" Dear papa , "
77565	77571	77563	77563	she	104	" I am so glad . "
77860	77866	77868	77868	Eleanor	104	" Not all , papa , "
77872	77880	77882	77882	he	102	" Not quite all , my dear , "
77884	77933	77882	77882	he	102	" that is , if we can help it . We must have a little at Crabtree — but it can only be a little ; we must put a bold front on it , Nelly ; it is n't easy to come down from affluence to poverty . "
78567	78574	78576	78577	Mr. Cox	240	" Eight hundred a - year ! "
78579	78586	78588	78589	Mr. Cumming	237	" And nothing whatever to do ! "
78597	78605	78607	78608	Mr. Cox	240	" No private fortune , I believe , "
78610	78615	78617	78618	Mr. Cumming	237	" Not a shilling , "
78630	78643	78645	78646	Mr. Cox	240	" I never heard of such a case in all my experience , "
78648	78672	78674	78675	Mr. Cumming	237	" Eight hundred a - year , and as nice a house as any gentleman could wish to hang up his hat in , "
78677	78686	78688	78689	Mr. Cox	240	" And an unmarried daughter , I believe , "
78726	78736	78738	78739	Mr. Cumming	237	" I 'll tell you what he might do , "
78744	78759	78738	78739	Mr. Cumming	237	" I 'll tell you how you might save it — let him exchange . "
78760	78764	78766	78767	the archdeacon	382	" Exchange where ? "
78769	78834	78766	78767	the archdeacon	382	" Exchange for a living . There 's Quiverful , of Puddingdale ; he has twelve children , and would be delighted to get the hospital . To be sure Puddingdale is only four hundred , but that would be saving something out of the fire : Mr. Harding would have a curate , and still keep three hundred or three hundred and fifty . "
78851	78855	78857	78858	Mr. Cumming	237	" The newspapers , "
78860	78878	78857	78858	Mr. Cumming	237	" might hammer away at Quiverful every day for the next six months without his minding them . "
78945	78953	78955	78956	the bishop	260	" Pray come to me at once , "
78958	79004	78955	78956	the bishop	260	" that we may see what had better be done ; as to the hospital , I will not say a word to dissuade you ; but I do n't like your going to Crabtree : at any rate , come to me at once . "
79145	79161	79166	79166	himself	260	" How is a man to live , when he gives up all his income ? "
79457	79464	79466	79466	he	102	" The girls , you know , "
79468	79510	79466	79466	he	102	" will have it just the same when you 're gone — and they wo n't want it sooner — and as for the interest during my lifetime , it is n't worth talking about . I have more than enough . "
79823	79830	79840	79840	he	382	" Not do , why not ? "
79849	79857	79840	79840	he	382	" Why not do , my lord ? "
79895	79906	79878	79878	he	2863	" Oh ! of course he 'll have a curate . "
79955	79962	79964	79965	the archdeacon	382	" How is he to live ? "
81405	81415	81417	81418	the warden	318	" Come in , my friends , come in , "
81426	81434	81436	81436	he	318	" Come in , and sit down ; "
81821	81831	81833	81834	the warden	318	" Sit down , sit down , my friends , "
81836	81875	81833	81834	the warden	318	" I want to say a word to you , and to drink your healths , before I leave you . Come up here , Moody , here is a chair for you ; come , Jonathan Crumple — "
81968	81974	81976	81976	he	102	" My dear old friends , "
81978	81990	81976	81976	he	102	" you all know that I am going to leave you . "
82029	82106	82121	82121	Handy	119	" There has been lately some misunderstanding between us . You have thought , I believe , that you did not get all that you were entitled to , and that the funds of the hospital have not been properly disposed of . As for me , I can not say what should be the disposition of these moneys , or how they should be managed , and I have therefore thought it best to go . "
82107	82119	82121	82121	Handy	119	" We never wanted to drive your reverence out of it , "
82123	82131	82133	82133	Skulpit	141	" No , indeed , your reverence , "
82135	82162	82133	82133	Skulpit	141	" We never thought it would come to this . When I signed the petition — that is , I did n't sign it , because — "
82163	82173	82175	82175	Moody	143	" Let his reverence speak , ca n't you ? "
82177	82180	82182	82183	Mr. Harding	102	" No , "
82185	82260	82182	82183	Mr. Harding	102	" I am sure you did not wish to turn me out ; but I thought it best to leave you . I am not a very good hand at a lawsuit , as you may all guess ; and when it seemed necessary that our ordinary quiet mode of living should be disturbed , I thought it better to go . I am neither angry nor offended with any man in the hospital . "
82275	82289	82291	82292	Mr. Harding	102	" I am neither angry nor displeased with any man in the hospital , "
82296	82397	82291	82292	Mr. Harding	102	" If any man has been wrong — and I do n't say any man has — he has erred through wrong advice . In this country all are entitled to look for their own rights , and you have done no more . As long as your interests and my interests were at variance , I could give you no counsel on this subject ; but the connection between us has ceased ; my income can no longer depend on your doings , and therefore , as I leave you , I venture to offer to you my advice . "
82419	82506	82411	82412	Mr. Harding	102	" Some gentleman will probably take my place here very soon , and I strongly advise you to be prepared to receive him in a kindly spirit , and to raise no further question among yourselves as to the amount of his income . Were you to succeed in lessening what he has to receive , you would not increase your own allowance . The surplus would not go to you ; your wants are adequately provided for , and your position could hardly be improved . "
82507	82517	82519	82519	Spriggs	145	" God bless your reverence , we knows it , "
82521	82530	82532	82532	Skulpit	141	" It 's all true , your reverence , "
82534	82541	82532	82532	Skulpit	141	" we sees it all now . "
82542	82548	82550	82550	Bunce	136	" Yes , Mr. Harding , "
82560	82608	82550	82550	Bunce	136	" I believe they do understand it now , now that they 've driven from under the same roof with them such a master as not one of them will ever know again — now that they 're like to be in sore want of a friend . "
82609	82616	82618	82619	Mr. Harding	102	" Come , come , Bunce , "
82636	82643	82645	82645	Handy	119	" Oh , as to that , "
82647	82690	82645	82645	Handy	119	" we none of us never wanted to do Mr. Harding no harm ; if he 's going now , it 's not along of us ; and I do n't see for what Mr. Bunce speaks up agen us that way . "
82691	82709	82711	82711	Bunce	136	" You 've ruined yourselves , and you 've ruined me too , and that 's why , "
82713	82718	82720	82721	Mr. Harding	102	" Nonsense , Bunce , "
82723	82805	82720	82721	Mr. Harding	102	" there 's nobody ruined at all . I hope you 'll let me leave you all friends , I hope you 'll all drink a glass of wine in friendly feeling with me and with one another . You 'll have a good friend , I do n't doubt , in your new warden ; and if ever you want any other , why after all I 'm not going so far off but that I shall sometimes see you ; "
82841	82893	82835	82835	his	102	" God bless you all ! you have my heartfelt wishes for your welfare . I hope you may live contented , and die trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ , and thankful to Almighty God for the good things he has given you . God bless you , my friends ! "
83092	83099	83101	83102	Mr. Harding	102	" There 's poor old Bell , "
83104	83130	83101	83102	Mr. Harding	102	" I must n't go without saying a word to him ; come through with me , Bunce , and bring the wine with you ; "
83155	83169	83171	83172	Mr. Harding	102	" I 've come to say good - bye to you , Bell , "
83184	83195	83197	83197	Bell	162	" And are you going away , then , really ? "
83199	83228	83197	83197	Bell	162	" Indeed I am , and I 've brought you a glass of wine ; so that we may part friends , as we lived , you know . "
83246	83253	83255	83256	Mr. Harding	102	" God bless you , Bell ! "
83258	83267	83255	83256	Mr. Harding	102	" good - bye , my old friend . "
83268	83276	83277	83278	the man	3682	" And so you 're really going ? "
83282	83289	83277	83278	the man	3682	" Indeed I am , Bell . "
83350	83355	83357	83357	he	3683	" And your reverence , "
83392	83408	83361	83361	he	3683	" and , your reverence , shall we get the hundred a - year then ? "
83687	83698	83700	83700	he	136	" It is all over for me in this world , "
83714	83730	83700	83700	he	136	" I have now to forgive those who have injured me — and to die . "
83991	83997	83999	83999	he	102	" Now , my dear , "
84001	84024	83999	83999	he	102	" you have everything ready , and you can make tea here just as nicely as in the parlour at the hospital . "
84140	84156	84158	84159	the bishop	260	" If we can get the matter set to rights , Mr. Harding will return , "
84161	84183	84158	84159	the bishop	260	" and if we can not , it will be wrong to put any other gentleman into so cruel a position . "
84216	84220	84201	84201	he	382	" good heavens ! "
85490	85517	85487	85488	the bishop	260	" The bishop 's compliments , and his lordship is not very well to - day , and he hopes Mr. Harding will dine with him . "
85661	85666	85667	85667	he	3683	" No , no , "
85674	85682	85667	85667	he	3683	" not warden now , only precentor . "
