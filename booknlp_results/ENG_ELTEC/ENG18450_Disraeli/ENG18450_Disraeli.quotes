11132	11168	11170	11170	Egremont	264	“ Well , my dear mother , I should like very much to be in Parliament , and particularly to sit for the old borough ; but I fear the contest will be very expensive , ”

And a young candidate with the old name will tell , ”

11482	11551	11479	11480	Lady Marney	1290	“ though I can not admit it is any favour . Perhaps it would be better that you should see him first . I can not understand why he keeps so at the Abbey .

11552	11588	11445	11445	Egremont	264	“ Well I did not , my dear mother , and I can not go now . I shall trust to you . But are you quite sure that the king is going to die ? ”

11899	13249	11881	11881	me	0	” Lord Marney left several children ; his heir was five years older than the next son Charles who at the period of his father ’s death was at Christchurch and had just entered the last year of his minority . Attaining that age , he received the sum of fifteen thousand pounds , his portion , a third of which amount his expenditure had then already anticipated . Egremont had been brought up in the enjoyment of every comfort and every luxury that refinement could devise and wealth furnish . He was a favourite child . His parents emulated each other in pampering and indulging him . Every freak was pardoned , every whim was gratified . He might ride what horses he liked , and if he broke their knees , what in another would have been deemed a flagrant sin , was in him held only a proof of reckless spirit . If he were not a thoroughly selfish and altogether wilful person , but very much the reverse , it was not the fault of his parents , but rather the operation of a benignant nature that had bestowed on him a generous spirit and a tender heart , though accompanied with a dangerous susceptibility that made him the child and creature of impulse , and seemed to set at defiance even the course of time to engraft on his nature any quality of prudence . The tone of Eton during the days of Charles Egremont was not of the high character which at present distinguishes that community . It was the unforeseen eve of the great change , that , whatever was its purpose or have been its immediate results , at least gave the first shock to the pseudo - aristocracy of this country . Then all was blooming ; sunshine and odour ; not a breeze disturbing the meridian splendour . Then the world was not only made for a few , but a very few . One could almost tell upon one ’s fingers the happy families who could do anything , and might have everything . A school - boy ’s ideas of the Church then were fat - livings , and of the State , rotten - boroughs . To do nothing and get something , formed a boy ’s ideal of a manly career . There was nothing in the lot , little in the temperament , of Charles Egremont , to make him an exception to the multitude . Gaily and securely he floated on the brilliant stream . Popular at school , idolized at home , the present had no cares , and the future secured him a family seat in Parliament the moment he entered life , and the inheritance of a glittering post at court in due time , as its legitimate consequence . Enjoyment , not ambition , seemed the principle of his existence . The contingency of a mitre , the certainty of rich preferment , would not reconcile him to the self - sacrifice which , to a certain degree , was required from a priest , even in those days of rampant Erastianism . He left the colonies as the spoil of his younger brothers ; his own ideas of a profession being limited to a barrack in a London park , varied by visits to Windsor . But there was time enough to think of these things . He had to enjoy Oxford as he had enjoyed Eton . Here his allowance from his father was extravagant , though greatly increased by tithes from his mother ’s pin - money . While he was pursuing his studies , hunting and boating , driving tandems , riding matches , tempering his energies in the crapulence of boyish banquets , and anticipating life , at the risk of expulsion , in a miserable mimicry of metropolitan dissipation , Dukism , that was supposed to be eternal , suddenly crashed . The Reform Act has not placed the administration of our affairs in abler hands than conducted them previously to the passing of the measure , for the most efficient members of the present cabinet with some very few exceptions , and those attended by peculiar circumstances , were ministers before the Reform Act was contemplated . Nor has that memorable statute created a Parliament of a higher reputation for public qualities , such as politic ability , and popular eloquence , and national consideration , than was furnished by the old scheme . On the contrary ; one house of Parliament has been irremediably degraded into the decaying position of a mere court of registry , possessing great privileges , on condition that it never exercises them ; while the other chamber that , at the first blush , and to the superficial , exhibits symptoms of almost unnatural vitality , engrossing in its orbit all the business of the country , assumes on a more studious inspection somewhat of the character of a select vestry , fulfilling municipal rather than imperial offices , and beleaguered by critical and clamorous millions , who can not comprehend why a privileged and exclusive senate is required to perform functions which immediately concern all , which most personally comprehend , and which many in their civic spheres believe they could accomplish in a manner not less satisfactory , though certainly less ostentatious . But if it have not furnished us with abler administrators or a more illustrious senate , the Reform Act may have exercised on the country at large a beneficial influence . Has it ? Has it elevated the tone of the public mind ? Has it cultured the popular sensibilities to noble and ennobling ends ? Has it proposed to the people of England a higher test of national respect and confidence than the debasing qualification universally prevalent in this country since the fatal introduction of the system of Dutch finance ? Who will pretend it ? If a spirit of rapacious coveteousness , desecrating all the humanities of life , has been the besetting sin of England for the last century and a half , since the passing of the Reform Act the altar of Mammon has blazed with triple worship . To acquire , to accumulate , to plunder each other by virtue of philosophic phrases , to propose an Utopia to consist only of WEALTH and TOIL , this has been the breathless business of enfranchised England for the last twelve years , until we are startled from our voracious strife by the wail of intolerable serfage . Are we then to conclude , that the only effect of the Reform Act has been to create in this country another of those class interests , which we now so loudly accuse as the obstacles to general amelioration ? Not exactly that . The indirect influence of the Reform Act has been not inconsiderable , and may eventually lead to vast consequences . It set men a - thinking ; it enlarged the horizon of political experience ; it led the public mind to ponder somewhat on the circumstances of our national history ; to pry into the beginnings of some social anomalies which they found were not so ancient as they had been led to believe , and which had their origin in causes very different to what they had been educated to credit ; and insensibly it created and prepared a popular intelligence to which one can appeal , no longer hopelessly , in an attempt to dispel the mysteries with which for nearly three centuries it has been the labour of party writers to involve a national history , and without the dispersion of which no political position can be understood and no social evil remedied . The events of 1830 did not produce any change in the modes of thought and life of Charles Egremont . He took his political cue from his mother , who was his constant correspondent . Lady Marney was a distinguished “
13252	13344	11881	11881	me	0	” as they called Lady Carlisle in Charles the First ’s time , a great friend of Lady St Julians , and one of the most eminent and impassioned votaries of Dukism . Her first impression on the overthrow of her hero was , astonishment at the impertinence of his adversaries , mingled with some lofty pity for their silly ambition and short - lived career . She existed for a week in the delightful expectation of his grace being sent for again , and informed every one in confidence , that “
13353	13394	13350	13353	a cabinet . ”	6143	” When the tocsin of peace , reform , and retrenchment sounded , she smiled bitterly ; was sorry for poor Lord Grey of whom she had thought better , and gave them a year , adding with consoling malice , “
13403	14468	13350	13353	a cabinet . ”	6143	” At length came the Reform Bill itself , and no one laughed more heartily than Lady Marney ; not even the House of Commons to whom it was presented . The bill was thrown out , and Lady Marney gave a grand ball to celebrate the event , and to compensate the London shopkeepers for the loss of their projected franchise . Lady Marney was preparing to resume her duties at court when to her great surprise the firing of cannon announced the dissolution of Parliament . She turned pale ; she was too much in the secrets of Tadpole and Taper to be deceived as to the consequences ; she sank into her chair , and denounced Lord Grey as a traitor to his order . Lady Marney who for six months had been writing to her son at Oxford the most charming letters , full of fun , quizzing the whole Cabinet , now announced to Egremont that a revolution was inevitable , that all property would be instantly confiscated , the poor deluded king led to the block or sent over to Hanover at the best , and the whole of the nobility and principal gentry , and indeed every one who possessed anything , guillotined without remorse . Whether his friends were immediately to resume power , or whether their estates ultimately were to be confiscated , the practical conclusion to Charles Egremont appeared to be the same . Carpe diem . He therefore pursued his career at Oxford unchanged , and entered life in the year 1833 , a younger son with extravagant tastes and expensive habits , with a reputation for lively talents though uncultivated,—for his acquisitions at Eton had been quite puerile , and subsequently he had not become a student,—with many manly accomplishments , and with a mien and visage that at once took the fancy and enlisted the affections . Indeed a physiologist would hardly have inferred from the countenance and structure of Egremont the career he had pursued , or the character which attached to him . The general cast and expression of his features when in repose was pensive : an air of refinement distinguished his well - moulded brow ; his mouth breathed sympathy , and his rich brown eye gleamed with tenderness . The sweetness of his voice in speaking was in harmony with this organization . Two years passed in the most refined circles of our society exercised a beneficial influence on the general tone of Egremont , and may be said to have finished his education . He had the good sense and the good taste not to permit his predilection for sports to degenerate into slang ; he yielded himself to the delicate and profitable authority of woman , and , as ever happens , it softened his manners and brightened his wit . He was fortunate in having a clever mother , and he appreciated this inestimable possession . Lady Marney had great knowledge of society , and some acquaintance with human nature , which she fancied she had fathomed to its centre ; she piqued herself upon her tact , and indeed she was very quick , but she was so energetic that her art did not always conceal itself ; very worldly , she was nevertheless not devoid of impulse ; she was animated and would have been extremely agreeable , if she had not restlessly aspired to wit ; and would certainly have exercised much more influence in society , if she had not been so anxious to show it . Nevertheless , still with many personal charms , a frank and yet , if need be , a finished manner , a quick brain , a lively tongue , a buoyant spirit , and a great social position . Lady Marney was universally and extremely popular ; and adored by her children , for indeed she was a mother most affectionate and true . When Egremont was four - and - twenty , he fell in love — a real passion . He had fluttered like others from flower to flower , and like others had often fancied the last perfume the sweetest , and then had flown away . But now he was entirely captivated . The divinity was a new beauty ; the whole world raving of her . Egremont also advanced . The Lady Arabella was not only beautiful : she was clever , fascinating . Her presence was inspiration ; at least for Egremont . She condescended to be pleased by him : she signalized him by her notice ; their names were mentioned together . Egremont indulged in flattering dreams . He regretted he had not pursued a profession : he regretted he had impaired his slender patrimony ; thought of love in a cottage , and renting a manor ; thought of living a good deal with his mother , and a little with his brother ; thought of the law and the church ; thought once of New Zealand . The favourite of nature and of fashion , this was the first time in the life of Egremont , that he had been made conscious that there was something in his position which , with all its superficial brilliancy , might prepare for him , when youth had fled and the blaze of society grown dim , a drear and bitter lot . He was roused from his reveries by a painful change in the demeanour of his adored . The mother of the Lady Arabella was alarmed . She liked her daughter to be admired even by younger sons when they were distinguished , but only at a distance . Mr Egremont ’s name had been mentioned too often . It had appeared coupled with her daughters , even in a Sunday paper . The most decisive measures were requisite , and they were taken . Still smiling when they met , still kind when they conversed , it seemed , by some magic dexterity which even baffled Egremont , that their meetings every day grew rarer , and their opportunities for conversation less frequent . At the end of the season , the Lady Arabella selected from a crowd of admirers equally qualified , a young peer of great estate , and of the “
14472	15205	13350	13353	a cabinet . ”	6143	” a circumstance which , as her grandfather had only been an East India director , was very gratifying to the bride . This unfortunate passion of Charles Egremont , and its mortifying circumstances and consequences , was just that earliest shock in one ’s life which occurs to all of us ; which first makes us think . We have all experienced that disheartening catastrophe , when the illusions first vanish ; and our balked imagination , or our mortified vanity , first intimates to us that we are neither infallible nor irresistible . Happily ‘ tis the season of youth for which the first lessons of experience are destined ; and bitter and intolerable as is the first blight of our fresh feelings , the sanguine impulse of early life bears us along . Our first scrape generally leads to our first travel . Disappointment requires change of air ; desperation change of scene . Egremont quitted his country , never to return to it again ; and returned to it after a year and a - half ’s absence , a much wiser man . Having left England in a serious mood , and having already tasted with tolerable freedom of the pleasures and frivolities of life , he was not in an inapt humour to observe , to enquire , and to reflect . The new objects that surrounded him excited his intelligence ; he met , which indeed is the principal advantage of travel , remarkable men , whose conversation opened his mind . His mind was worth opening . Energies began to stir of which he had not been conscious ; awakened curiosity led him to investigate and to read ; he discovered that , when he imagined his education was completed , it had in fact not commenced ; and that , although he had been at a public school and a university , he in fact knew nothing . To be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge . Before an emancipated intellect and an expanding intelligence , the great system of exclusive manners and exclusive feelings in which he had been born and nurtured , began to tremble ; the native generosity of his heart recoiled at a recurrence to that arrogant and frigid life , alike devoid of sympathy and real grandeur . In the early spring of 1837 , Egremont re - entered the world , where he had once sparkled , and which he had once conceived to comprise within its circle all that could interest or occupy man . His mother , delighted at finding him again under her roof , had removed some long - standing coolness between him and his elder brother ; his former acquaintance greeted him with cordiality , and introduced him to the new heroes who had sprung up during the season of his absence . Apparently Egremont was not disinclined to pursue , though without eagerness , the same career that had originally engaged him . He frequented assemblies , and lingered in clubs ; rode in the park , and lounged at the opera . But there was this difference in his existence , before and since his travels : he was now conscious he wanted an object ; and was ever musing over action , though as yet ignorant how to act . Perhaps it was this want of being roused , that led him , it may be for distraction , again to the turf . It was a pursuit that seemed to him more real than the life of saloons , full of affectation , perverted ideas , and factitious passions . Whatever might be the impulse Egremont however was certainly not slightly interested in the Derby ; and though by no means uninstructed in the mysteries of the turf , had felt such confidence in his information that , with his usual ardour , he had backed to a considerable amount the horse that ought to have won , but which nevertheless only ran a second . Notwithstanding the confidence of Lady St Julians , and her unrivalled information , the health of the king did not improve : but still it was the hay fever , only the hay fever . An admission had been allowed to creep into the Court Circular , that “
15218	15324	15325	15326	Poor woman	6075	” but then it was soon followed by a very positive assurance , that his majesty ’s favourite and long - matured resolution to give a state banquet to the knights of the four orders , was immediately to be carried into effect . Lady St Julians had the first information of this important circumstance ; it confirmed her original conviction : she determined to go on with her quadrille . Egremont , with something interesting at stake himself , was staggered by this announcement , and by Lady St Julians ’ unshaken faith . He consulted his mother : Lady Marney shook her head . “
15328	15333	15334	15334	she	6075	” said Lady Marney , “
15342	15354	15339	15339	I	0	” continued her ladyship , placing her finger to her lip , “
15424	15432	15549	15551	a clever mother	6169	” said Lady Marney with a sigh ; “
15464	15541	15455	15458	The poor dear king	1304	” And about a week after this there appeared the first bulletin . From that instant , though the gullish multitude studied the daily reports with grave interest ; their hopes and speculations and arrangements changing with each phrase ; for the initiated there was no suspense . All knew that it was over ; and Lady St Julians , giving up her quadrille , began to look about for seats in parliament for her sons . “
15553	15694	15455	15458	The poor dear king	1304	” exclaimed Egremont , as he pondered over the returns of his election agent . Lady Marney , duly warned of the impending catastrophe , was experiencing all the advantages of prior information . It delighted her to meet Lady St Julians driving distractedly about town , calling at clubs , closeted with red tapers , making ingenious combinations that would not work , by means of which some one of her sons was to stand in coalition with some rich parvenu ; to pay none of the expenses and yet to come in first . And all this time , Lady Marney , serene and smiling , had the daily pleasure of assuring Lady St Julians what a relief it was to her that Charles had fixed on his place . It had been arranged indeed these weeks past ; “
15701	15715	15698	15698	you	1306	” concluded Lady Marney in the sweetest voice and with a blandishing glance , “
15725	16181	16182	16182	He	1307	” In the meantime the impending event changed the whole aspect of the political world . The king dying before the new registration was the greatest blow to pseudo - toryism since his majesty , calling for a hackney coach , went down and dissolved parliament in 1831 . It was calculated by the Tadpoles and Tapers that a dissolution by Sir Robert , after the registration of 1837 , would give him a clear majority , not too great a one , but large enough : a manageable majority ; some five - and - twenty or thirty men , who with a probable peerage or two dangling in the distance , half - a - dozen positive baronetcies , the Customs for their constituents , and Court balls for their wives , might be induced to save the state . 0 ! England , glorious and ancient realm , the fortunes of thy polity are indeed strange ! The wisdom of the Saxons , Norman valour , the state - craft of the Tudors , the national sympathies of the Stuarts , the spirit of the latter Guelphs struggling against their enslaved sovereignty,—these are the high qualities , that for a thousand years have secured thy national developement . And now all thy memorial dynasties end in the huckstering rule of some thirty unknown and anonymous jobbers ! The Thirty at Athens were at least tyrants . They were marked men . But the obscure majority , who under our present constitution are destined to govern England , are as secret as a Venetian conclave . Yet on their dark voices all depends . Would you promote or prevent some great measure that may affect the destinies of unborn millions , and the future character of the people,—take , for example , a system of national education,—the minister must apportion the plunder to the illiterate clan ; the scum that floats on the surface of a party ; or hold out the prospect of honours , which are only honourable when in their transmission they impart and receive lustre ; when they are the meed of public virtue and public services , and the distinction of worth and of genius . It is impossible that the system of the thirty can long endure in an age of inquiry and agitated spirit like the present . Such a system may suit the balanced interests and the periodical and alternate command of rival oligarchical connections : but it can subsist only by the subordination of the sovereign and the degradation of the multitude ; and can not accord with an age , whose genius will soon confess that Power and the People are both divine . “
16189	16211	16182	16182	He	1307	” said a whig secretary of the treasury with a triumphant glance at Mr Taper as they met in Pall Mall ; “
16219	16220	16212	16212	You	1307	” “
16230	16238	16223	16223	you	1307	” rejoined in despair the dismayed Taper . “
16254	16255	16250	16250	you	1307	” “
16261	16262	16258	16258	you	1307	” “
16275	16282	16283	16283	Pish	379	” said Mr Taper very solemnly . “
16285	16290	16291	16291	You	1307	” said the secretary . “
16295	16300	16291	16291	You	1307	” said Mr Taper , “
16361	16362	16363	16363	I	0	” “
16373	16378	16363	16363	I	0	” said the secretary . “
16387	16391	16379	16380	Lord Durham	378	” said Taper , “
16398	16399	16379	16380	Lord Durham	378	” “
16409	16414	16416	16416	he	378	” said the secretary , “
16451	16452	16432	16433	Lord Melbourne	380	” “
16458	16466	16470	16470	he	378	” said Mr Tadpole , joining them ; “
16475	16476	16470	16470	he	378	” “
16483	16488	16481	16481	yourself	1321	” said the secretary . “
16501	16507	16495	16495	they	1323	” said Tadpole looking boldly . “
16512	16517	16495	16495	they	1323	” said the secretary . “
16630	16642	16643	16643	They	1325	” and the triumphant secretary wished the worthy pair good morning . “
16651	16656	16643	16643	They	1325	” said Taper mournfully . “
16666	16670	16643	16643	They	1325	” said Tadpole , “
16680	18456	16643	16643	They	1325	” The daily bulletins became more significant ; the crisis was evidently at hand . A dissolution of parliament at any time must occasion great excitement ; combined with a new reign , it inflames the passions of every class of the community . Even the poor begin to hope ; the old , wholesome superstition still lingers , that the sovereign can exercise power ; and the suffering multitude are fain to believe that its remedial character may be about to be revealed in their instance . As for the aristocracy in a new reign , they are all in a flutter . A bewildering vision of coronets , stars , and ribbons ; smiles , and places at court ; haunts their noontide speculations and their midnight dreams . Then we must not forget the numberless instances in which the coming event is deemed to supply the long - sought opportunity of distinction , or the long - dreaded cause of utter discomfiture ; the hundreds , the thousands , who mean to get into parliament , the units who dread getting out . What a crashing change from lounging in St James ’s street to sauntering on Boulogne pier ; or , after dining at Brookes and supping at Crockford ’s , to be saved from destruction by the friendly interposition that sends you in an official capacity to the marsupial sympathies of Sydney or Swan River ! Now is the time for the men to come forward who have claims ; claims for spending their money , which nobody asked them to do , but which of course they only did for the sake of the party . They never wrote for their party , or spoke for their party , or gave their party any other vote than their own ; but they urge their claims,—to something ; a commissionership of anything , or a consulship anywhere ; if no place to be had , they are ready to take it out in dignities . They once looked to the privy council , but would now be content with an hereditary honour ; if they can have neither , they will take a clerkship in the Treasury for a younger son . Perhaps they may get that in time ; at present they go away growling with a gaugership ; or , having with desperate dexterity at length contrived to transform a tidewaiter into a landwaiter . But there is nothing like asking — except refusing . Hark ! it tolls ! All is over . The great bell of the metropolitan cathedral announces the death of the last son of George the Third who probably will ever reign in England . He was a good man : with feelings and sympathies ; deficient in culture rather than ability ; with a sense of duty ; and with something of the conception of what should be the character of an English monarch . Peace to his manes ! We are summoned to a different scene . In a palace in a garden — not in a haughty keep , proud with the fame , but dark with the violence of ages ; not in a regal pile , bright with the splendour , but soiled with the intrigues , of courts and factions — in a palace in a garden , meet scene for youth , and innocence , and beauty — came the voice that told the maiden she must ascend her throne ! The council of England is summoned for the first time within her bowers . There are assembled the prelates and captains and chief men of her realm ; the priests of the religion that consoles , the heroes of the sword that has conquered , the votaries of the craft that has decided the fate of empires ; men grey with thought , and fame , and age ; who are the stewards of divine mysteries , who have encountered in battle the hosts of Europe , who have toiled in secret cabinets , who have struggled in the less merciful strife of aspiring senates ; men too , some of them , lords of a thousand vassals and chief proprietors of provinces , yet not one of them whose heart does not at this moment tremble as he awaits the first presence of the maiden who must now ascend her throne . A hum of half - suppressed conversation which would attempt to conceal the excitement , which some of the greatest of them have since acknowledged , fills that brilliant assemblage ; that sea of plumes , and glittering stars , and gorgeous dresses . Hush ! the portals open ; She comes ! The silence is as deep as that of a noontide forest . Attended for a moment by her royal mother and the ladies of her court , who bow and then retire , VICTORIA ascends her throne ; a girl , alone , and for the first time , amid an assemblage of men . In a sweet and thrilling voice , and with a composed mien which indicates rather the absorbing sense of august duty than an absence of emotion , THE QUEEN announces her accession to the throne of her ancestors , and her humble hope that divine providence will guard over the fulfilment of her lofty trust . The prelates and captains and chief men of her realm then advance to the throne , and kneeling before her , pledge their troth , and take the sacred oaths of allegiance and supremacy . Allegiance to one who rules over the land that the great Macedonian could not conquer ; and over a continent of which even Columbus never dreamed : to the Queen of every sea , and of nations in every zone . It is not of these that I would speak ; but of a nation nearer her foot - stool , and which at this moment looks to her with anxiety , with affection , perhaps with hope . Fair and serene , she has the blood and beauty of the Saxon . Will it be her proud destiny at length to bear relief to suffering millions , and with that soft hand which might inspire troubadours and guerdon knights , break the last links in the chain of Saxon thraldom ? The building which was still called MARNEY ABBEY , though remote from the site of the ancient monastery , was an extensive structure raised at the latter end of the reign of James the First , and in the stately and picturesque style of that age . Placed on a noble elevation in the centre of an extensive and well wooded park , it presented a front with two projecting wings of equal dimensions with the centre , so that the form of the building was that of a quadrangle , less one of its sides . Its ancient lattices had been removed , and the present windows though convenient accorded little with the structure ; the old entrance door in the centre of the building however still remained , a wondrous specimen of fantastic carving : Ionic columns of black oak , with a profusion of fruits and flowers , and heads of stags and sylvans . The whole of the building was crowned with a considerable pediment of what seemed at the first glance fanciful open work , but which examined more nearly offered in gigantic letters the motto of the house of Marney . The portal opened to a hall , such as is now rarely found ; with the dais , the screen , the gallery , and the buttery - hatch all perfect , and all of carved black oak . Modern luxury , and the refined taste of the lady of the late lord , had made Marney Abbey as remarkable for its comfort and pleasantness of accommodation as for its ancient state and splendour . The apartments were in general furnished with all the cheerful ease and brilliancy of the modern mansion of a noble , but the grand gallery of the seventeenth century was still preserved , and was used on great occasions as the chief reception - room . You ascended the principal staircase to reach it through a long corridor . It occupied the whole length of one of the wings ; was one hundred feet long , and forty - five feet broad , its walls hung with a collection of choice pictures rich in history ; while the Axminster carpets , the cabinets , carved tables , and variety of easy chairs , ingeniously grouped , imparted even to this palatian chamber a lively and habitable air . Lord Marney was several years the senior of Charles Egremont , yet still a young man . He was handsome ; there was indeed a general resemblance between the brothers , though the expression of their countenances was entirely different ; of the same height and air , and throughout the features a certain family cast ; but here the likeness ceased . The countenance of Lord Marney bespoke the character of his mind ; cynical , devoid of sentiment , arrogant , literal , hard . He had no imagination , had exhausted his slight native feeling , but he was acute , disputatious , and firm even to obstinacy . Though his early education had been very imperfect , he had subsequently read a good deal , especially in French literature . He had formed his mind by Helvetius , whose system he deemed irrefutable , and in whom alone he had faith . Armed with the principles of his great master , he believed he could pass through existence in adamantine armour , and always gave you in the business of life the idea of a man who was conscious you were trying to take him in , and rather respected you for it , but the working of whose cold , unkind , eye defied you . There never had been excessive cordiality between the brothers even in their boyish days , and shortly after Egremont ’s entrance into life , they had become estranged . They were to meet now for the first time since Egremont ’s return from the continent . Their mother had arranged their reconciliation . They were to meet as if no misunderstanding had ever existed between them ; it was specially stipulated by Lord Marney , that there was to be no “
18459	18917	16643	16643	They	1325	” Apprised of Egremont ’s impending arrival , Lord Marney was careful to be detained late that day at petty sessions , and entered the room only a few minutes before dinner was announced , where he found Egremont not only with the countess and a young lady who was staying with her , but with additional bail against any ebullition of sentiment in the shape of the Vicar of Marney , and a certain Captain Grouse , who was a kind of aide - de - camp of the earl ; killed birds and carved them ; played billiards with him , and lost ; had indeed every accomplishment that could please woman or ease man ; could sing , dance , draw , make artificial flies , break horses , exercise a supervision over stewards and bailiffs , and make every body comfortable by taking everything on his own shoulders . Lady Marney had received Egremont in a manner which expressed the extreme satisfaction she experienced at finding him once more beneath his brother ’s roof . When he arrived indeed , he would have preferred to have been shown at once to his rooms , but a message immediately delivered expressed the wish of his sister - in - law at once to see him . She received him alone and with great warmth . She was beautiful , and soft as May ; a glowing yet delicate face ; rich brown hair , and large blue eyes ; not yet a mother , but with something of the dignity of the matron blending with the lingering timidity of the girl . Egremont was glad to join his sister - in - law again in the drawing - room before dinner . He seated himself by her side ; and in answer to her enquiries was giving her some narrative of his travels ; the Vicar who was very low church , was shaking his head at Lady Marney ’s young friend , who was enlarging on the excellence of Mr Paget ’s tales ; while Captain Grouse , in a very stiff white neck - cloth , very tight pantaloons , to show his very celebrated legs , transparent stockings and polished shoes , was throwing himself into attitudes in the back ground , and with a zeal amounting almost to enthusiasm , teaching Lady Marney ’s spaniel to beg ; when the door opened , and Lord Marney entered , but as if to make security doubly sure , not alone . He was accompanied by a neighbour and brother magistrate , Sir Vavasour Firebrace , a baronet of the earliest batch , and a gentleman of great family and great estate . “
18921	18922	18919	18919	Charles	264	” “
18928	19049	18925	18925	you	264	” And the brothers shook hands . ‘ Tis the English way ; and if they had been inclined to fall into each other ’s arms , they would not probably have done more . In a few minutes it was announced that dinner was served , and so , secured from a scene , having a fair appetite , and surrounded by dishes that could agreeably satisfy it , a kind of vague fraternal sentiment began to stir the breast of Lord Marney : he really was glad to see his brother again ; remembered the days when they rode their poneys and played cricket ; his voice softened , his eyes sparkled , and he at length exclaimed , “
19076	19437	19439	19439	him	1331	” The softer heart and more susceptible spirit of Egremont were well calculated to respond to this ebullition of feeling , however slight ; and truly it was for many reasons not without considerable emotion , that he found himself once more at Marney . He sate by the side of his gentle sister - in - law , who seemed pleased by the unwonted cordiality of her husband , and anxious by many kind offices to second every indication of good feeling on his part . Captain Grouse was extremely assiduous : the vicar was of the deferential breed , agreed with Lady Marney on the importance of infant schools , but recalled his opinion when Lord Marney expressed his imperious hope that no infant schools would ever be found in his neighbourhood . Sir Vavasour was more than middle aged , comely , very gentlemanlike , but with an air occasionally of absence which hardly agreed with his frank and somewhat hearty idiosyncracy ; his clear brow , florid complexion , and blue eye . But Lord Marney talked a good deal , though chiefly dogmatical or argumentative . It was rather difficult for him to find a sufficient stock of opposition , but he laid in wait and seized every opening with wonderful alacrity . Even Captain Grouse could not escape him ; if driven to extremity Lord Marney would even question his principles on fly - making . Captain Grouse gave up , but not too soon ; he was well aware that his noble friend ’s passion for controversy was equal to his love of conquest . As for Lady Marney , it was evident that with no inconsiderable talents , and with an intelligence richly cultivated , the controversial genius of her husband had completely cowed her conversational charms . She never advanced a proposition that he did not immediately bristle up , and she could only evade the encounter by a graceful submission . As for the vicar , a frequent guest , he would fain have taken refuge in silence , but the earl , especially when alone , would what he called “
19442	19501	19439	19439	him	1331	” and the game once unearthed , with so skilled a pack there was but little fear of a bad run . When all were reduced to silence , Lord Marney relinquishing controversy , assumed the positive . He eulogized the new poor law , which he declared would be the salvation of the country , provided it was “
19504	19589	19439	19439	him	1331	” in the spirit in which it was developed in the Marney Union ; but then he would add that there was no district except their union in which it was properly observed . He was tremendously fierce against allotments and analysed the system with merciless sarcasm , Indeed he had no inconsiderable acquaintance with the doctrines of the economists , and was rather inclined to carry them into practice in every instance , except that of the landed proprietary , which he clearly proved “
19594	19600	19439	19439	him	1331	” to that of any other “
19603	19761	19439	19439	him	1331	” There was nothing he hated so much as a poacher , except a lease ; though perhaps in the catalogue of his aversions , we ought to give the preference to his anti - ecclesiastical prejudice : this amounted even to acrimony . Though there was no man breathing who was possessed with such a strong repugnance to subscriptions of any kind , it delighted Lord Marney to see his name among the contributors to all sectarian institutions . The vicar of Marney , who had been presented by himself , was his model of a priest : he left every body alone . Under the influence of Lady Marney , the worthy vicar had once warmed up into some ebullition of very low church zeal ; there was some talk of an evening lecture , the schools were to be remodelled , certain tracts were actually distributed . But Lord Marney soon stopped all this . “
19767	19776	19777	19777	I	0	” said this gentle proprietor of abbey lands . “
19788	19795	19777	19777	I	0	” said Lady Marney to Egremont , “

20101	20106	20098	20099	my mother	1335	” said Lord Marney . “
20109	20113	20119	20123	a far more experienced mind	1356	” said Egremont ; “

20159	20177	20178	20178	He	375	” said Lord Marney , rather audaciously , as he reseated himself after the ladies had retired . “
20181	20205	20178	20178	He	375	” and he looked at his brother , whose return had in a great degree been secured by crying that Poor Law down . “
20210	20242	20243	20243	He	375	” said Charles , fresh from the hustings , and speaking from the card of Taper , for the condition of the people was a subject of which he knew nothing . “
20249	20254	20255	20255	you	1359	” said Lord Marney , “

20322	20326	20315	20316	The people	914	” said Egremont ; “

20348	20363	20335	20335	You	1359	” said Captain Grouse , making , as he thought , a safe observation . “

20431	20508	20421	20421	Slimsey	391	” said the vicar . Hereupon a conversation took place , principally sustained by the earl and the baronet , which developed all the resources of the great parochial mind . Dietaries , bastardy , gaol regulations , game laws , were amply discussed ; and Lord Marney wound up with a declaration of the means by which the country might be saved , and which seemed principally to consist of high prices and low church . “
20519	20535	20515	20517	her best friends	1367	” said Sir Vavasour , with a sigh . Lord Marney seemed to get uneasy . “

20586	20616	20583	20584	the ladies	6441	” said the earl , abruptly disturbing his guest . There was music as they re - entered the drawing - room . Sir Vavasour attached himself to Egremont . “

21941	21950	21937	21937	You	0	” said the baronet , colouring a little ; “
21996	23621	21959	21959	you	0	” The situation of the rural town of Marney was one of the most delightful easily to be imagined . In a spreading dale , contiguous to the margin of a clear and lively stream , surrounded by meadows and gardens , and backed by lofty hills , undulating and richly wooded , the traveller on the opposite heights of the dale would often stop to admire the merry prospect , that recalled to him the traditional epithet of his country . Beautiful illusion ! For behind that laughing landscape , penury and disease fed upon the vitals of a miserable population ! The contrast between the interior of the town and its external aspect , was as striking as it was full of pain . With the exception of the dull high street , which had the usual characteristics of a small agricultural market town , some sombre mansions , a dingy inn , and a petty bourse , Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed by cottages built of rubble , or unhewn stones without cement , and from age , or badness of the material , looking as if they could scarcely hold together . The gaping chinks admitted every blast ; the leaning chimneys had lost half their original height ; the rotten rafters were evidently misplaced ; while in many instances the thatch , yawning in some parts to admit the wind and wet , and in all utterly unfit for its original purpose of giving protection from the weather , looked more like the top of a dunghill than a cottage . Before the doors of these dwellings , and often surrounding them , ran open drains full of animal and vegetable refuse , decomposing into disease , or sometimes in their imperfect course filling foul pits or spreading into stagnant pools , while a concentrated solution of every species of dissolving filth was allowed to soak through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground adjoining . These wretched tenements seldom consisted of more than two rooms , in one of which the whole family , however numerous , were obliged to sleep , without distinction of age , or sex , or suffering . With the water streaming down the walls , the light distinguished through the roof , with no hearth even in winter , the virtuous mother in the sacred pangs of childbirth , gives forth another victim to our thoughtless civilization ; surrounded by three generations whose inevitable presence is more painful than her sufferings in that hour of travail ; while the father of her coming child , in another corner of the sordid chamber , lies stricken by that typhus which his contaminating dwelling has breathed into his veins , and for whose next prey is perhaps destined , his new - born child . These swarming walls had neither windows nor doors sufficient to keep out the weather , or admit the sun or supply the means of ventilation ; the humid and putrid roof of thatch exhaling malaria like all other decaying vegetable matter . The dwelling rooms were neither boarded nor paved ; and whether it were that some were situate in low and damp places , occasionally flooded by the river , and usually much below the level of the road ; or that the springs , as was often the case , would burst through the mud floor ; the ground was at no time better than so much clay , while sometimes you might see little channels cut from the centre under the doorways to carry off the water , the door itself removed from its hinges : a resting place for infancy in its deluged home . These hovels were in many instances not provided with the commonest conveniences of the rudest police ; contiguous to every door might be observed the dung - heap on which every kind of filth was accumulated , for the purpose of being disposed of for manure , so that , when the poor man opened his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing it with the breeze of summer , he was met with a mixture of gases from reeking dunghills . This town of Marney was a metropolis of agricultural labour , for the proprietors of the neighbourhood having for the last half century acted on the system of destroying the cottages on their estates , in order to become exempted from the maintenance of the population , the expelled people had flocked to Marney , where , during the war , a manufactory had afforded them some relief , though its wheels had long ceased to disturb the waters of the Mar. Deprived of this resource , they had again gradually spread themselves over that land which had as it were rejected them ; and obtained from its churlish breast a niggardly subsistence . Their re - entrance into the surrounding parishes was viewed with great suspicion ; their renewed settlement opposed by every ingenious contrivance ; those who availed themselves of their labour were careful that they should not become dwellers on the soil ; and though , from the excessive competition , there were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was more depressed , those who were fortunate enough to obtain the scant remuneration , had , in addition to their toil , to endure each morn and even a weary journey before they could reach the scene of their labour , or return to the squalid hovel which profaned the name of home . To that home , over which Malaria hovered , and round whose shivering hearth were clustered other guests besides the exhausted family of toil — Fever , in every form , pale Consumption , exhausting Synochus , and trembling Ague,—returned after cultivating the broad fields of merry England the bold British peasant , returned to encounter the worst of diseases with a frame the least qualified to oppose them ; a frame that subdued by toil was never sustained by animal food ; drenched by the tempest could not change its dripping rags ; and was indebted for its scanty fuel to the windfalls of the woods . The eyes of this unhappy race might have been raised to the solitary spire that sprang up in the midst of them , the bearer of present consolation , the harbinger of future equality ; but Holy Church at Marney had forgotten her sacred mission . We have introduced the reader to the vicar , an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached each week two sermons , and enforced humility on his congregation and gratitude for the blessings of this life . The high Street and some neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers . Lord and Lady Marney came , attended by Captain Grouse , every Sunday morning with commendable regularity , and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew , that occupied half of the gallery , was lined with crimson damask , and furnished with easy chairs , and , for those who chose them , well - padded stools of prayer . The people of Marney took refuge in conventicles , which abounded ; little plain buildings of pale brick with the names painted on them , of Sion , Bethel , Bethesda : names of a distant land , and the language of a persecuted and ancient race : yet , such is the mysterious power of their divine quality , breathing consolation in the nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a Saxon peasantry . But however devoted to his flock might have been the Vicar of Marney , his exertions for their well being , under any circumstances , must have been mainly limited to spiritual consolation . Married and a father he received for his labours the small tithes of the parish , which secured to him an income by no means equal to that of a superior banker ’s clerk , or the cook of a great loanmonger . The great tithes of Marney , which might be counted by thousands , swelled the vast rental which was drawn from this district by the fortunate earls that bore its name . The morning after the arrival of Egremont at the Abbey , an unusual stir might have been observed in the high Street of the town . Round the portico of the Green Dragon hotel and commercial inn , a knot of principal personages , the chief lawyer , the brewer , the vicar himself , and several of those easy quidnuncs who abound in country towns , and who rank under the designation of retired gentlemen , were in close and very earnest converse . In a short time a servant on horseback in the Abbey livery galloped up to the portico , and delivered a letter to the vicar . The excitement apparently had now greatly increased . On the opposite side of the way to the important group , a knot , larger in numbers but very deficient in quality , had formed themselves , and remained transfixed with gaping mouths and a Curious not to say alarmed air . The head constable walked up to the door of the Green Dragon , and though he did not presume to join the principal group , was evidently in attendance , if required . The clock struck eleven ; a cart had stopped to watch events , and a gentleman ’s coachman riding home with a led horse . “
23626	23631	21959	21959	you	0	” said the brewer . “
23636	23641	23634	23634	himself	402	” said the lawyer . “
23657	23701	23650	23650	I	0	” said a retired gentleman , who had been a tallow - chandler on Holborn Hill . The vicar took off his hat , and all uncovered . Lord Marney and his brother magistrate rode briskly up to the inn and rapidly dismounted . “
23706	23716	23704	23704	Snigford	394	” said his lordship , in a peremptory tone , “
23730	23777	23723	23723	I	0	” Fortunate man if he succeed in doing so ! The torch of the incendiary had for the first time been introduced into the parish of Marney ; and last night the primest stacks of the Abbey farm had blazed a beacon to the agitated neighbourhood . “
23788	23799	23786	23786	sir	1375	” said Mr Bingley of the Abbey farm to Egremont , “
23864	23865	23866	23866	You	1375	” “
23876	23877	23866	23866	You	1375	” “
23932	23933	23927	23927	I	0	” “
23969	23970	23977	23978	Mr Charles	396	” “
23983	23996	23977	23978	Mr Charles	396	” and Mr Bingley lowered his tone , and looked around him , “
24056	24057	24053	24054	Mr Charles	396	” “
24096	24097	24086	24086	I	0	” “
24105	24112	24098	24098	You	395	” said the farmer , smiling . “
24135	24136	24126	24126	you	395	” “
24141	24197	24126	24126	you	395	” But the hospitable Bingley would take no denial , and as his companion waived on the present occasion entering his house , for the sun had been some time declining , the farmer , calling one of his labourers to take Egremont ’s horse , hastened into the house to fill the brimming cup . “
24207	24214	24201	24201	you	395	” said Egremont to the hind . “
24227	24228	24215	24215	I	0	” “
24244	26078	26079	26079	You	1465	” The man made no reply , but with a dogged look led away the horse to his stable . About half a mile from Marney , the dale narrowed , and the river took a winding course . It ran through meads , soft and vivid with luxuriant vegetation , bounded on either side by rich hanging woods , save where occasionally a quarry broke the verdant bosom of the heights with its rugged and tawny form . Fair stone and plenteous timber , and the current of fresh waters , combined , with the silent and secluded scene screened from every harsh and angry wind , to form the sacred spot that in old days Holy Church loved to hallow with its beauteous and enduring structures . Even the stranger therefore when he had left the town about two miles behind him , and had heard the farm and mill which he had since passed , called the Abbey farm and the Abbey mill , might have been prepared for the grateful vision of some monastic remains . As for Egremont , he had been almost born amid the ruins of Marney Abbey ; its solemn relics were associated with his first and freshest fancies ; every footstep was as familiar to him as it could have been to one of the old monks ; yet never without emotion could he behold these unrivalled remains of one of the greatest of the great religious houses of the North . Over a space of not less than ten acres might still be observed the fragments of the great abbey : these were , towards their limit , in general moss - grown and mouldering memorials that told where once rose the offices and spread the terraced gardens of the old proprietors ; here might still be traced the dwelling of the lord abbot ; and there , still more distinctly , because built on a greater scale and of materials still more intended for perpetuity , the capacious hospital , a name that did not then denote the dwelling of disease , but a place where all the rights of hospitality were practised ; where the traveller from the proud baron to the lonely pilgrim asked the shelter and the succour that never were denied , and at whose gate , called the Portal of the Poor , the peasants on the Abbey lands , if in want , might appeal each morn and night for raiment and for food . But it was in the centre of this tract of ruins , occupying a space of not less than two acres , that , with a strength that had defied time , and with a beauty that had at last turned away the wrath of man , still rose if not in perfect , yet admirable , form and state , one of the noblest achievements of Christian art,—the Abbey church . The summer vault was now its only roof , and all that remained of its gorgeous windows was the vastness of their arched symmetry , and some wreathed relics of their fantastic frame - work , but the rest was uninjured . From the west window , looking over the transept chapel of the Virgin , still adorned with pillars of marble and alabaster , the eye wandered down the nave to the great orient light , a length of nearly three hundred feet , through a gorgeous avenue of unshaken walls and columns that clustered to the skies , On each side of the Lady ’s chapel rose a tower . One which was of great antiquity , being of that style which is commonly called Norman , short and very thick and square , did not mount much above the height of the western front ; but the other tower was of a character very different , It was tall and light , and of a Gothic style most pure and graceful ; the stone of which it was built , of a bright and even sparkling colour , and looking as if it were hewn but yesterday . At first , its turretted crest seemed injured ; but the truth is , it was unfinished ; the workmen were busied on this very tower the day that old Baldwin Greymount came as the king ’s commissioner to inquire into the conduct of this religious house . The abbots loved to memorise their reigns by some public work , which should add to the beauty of their buildings or the convenience of their subjects ; and the last of the ecclesiastical lords of Marney , a man of fine taste and a skilful architect , was raising this new belfry for his brethren when the stern decree arrived that the bells should no more sound . And the hymn was no more to be chaunted in the Lady ’s chapel ; and the candles were no more to be lit on the high altar ; and the gate of the poor was to be closed for ever ; and the wanderer was no more to find a home . The body of the church was in many parts overgrown with brambles and in all covered with a rank vegetation . It had been a very sultry day , and the blaze of the meridian heat still inflamed the air ; the kine for shelter , rather than for sustenance , had wandered through some broken arches , and were lying in the shadow of the nave . This desecration of a spot , once sacred , still beautiful and solemn , jarred on the feelings of Egremont . He sighed and turning away , followed a path that after a few paces led him into the cloister garden . This was a considerable quadrangle ; once surrounding the garden of the monks , but all that remained of that fair pleasaunce was a solitary yew in its centre , that seemed the oldest tree that could well live , and was , according to tradition , more ancient than the most venerable walls of the Abbey . Round this quadrangle was the refectory , the library and the kitchen , and above them the cells and dormitory of the brethren . An imperfect staircase , not without danger , led to these unroofed chambers ; but Egremont familiar with the way did not hesitate to pursue it , so that he soon found himself on an elevation overlooking the garden , while further on extended the vast cloisters of the monks , and adjoining was a cemetery , that had once been enclosed , and communicated with the cloister garden . It was one of those summer days that are so still , that they seem as it were a holiday of nature . The weary wind was sleeping in some grateful cavern , and the sunbeams basking on some fervent knoll ; the river floated with a drowsy unconscious course : there was no wave in the grass , no stir in the branches . A silence so profound amid these solemn ruins , offered the perfection of solitude ; and there was that stirring in the mind of Egremont which rendered him far from indisposed for this loneliness . The slight words that he had exchanged with the farmer and the hind had left him musing . Why was England not the same land as in the days of his light - hearted youth ? Why were these hard times for the poor ? He stood among the ruins that , as the farmer had well observed , had seen many changes : changes of creeds , of dynasties , of laws , of manners . New orders of men had arisen in the country , new sources of wealth had opened , new dispositions of power to which that wealth had necessarily led . His own house , his own order , had established themselves on the ruins of that great body , the emblems of whose ancient magnificence and strength surrounded him . And now his order was in turn menaced . And the People — the millions of Toil , on whose unconscious energies during these changeful centuries all rested — what changes had these centuries brought to them ? Had their advance in the national scale borne a due relation to that progress of their rulers , which had accumulated in the treasuries of a limited class the riches of the world ; and made their possessors boast that they were the first of nations ; the most powerful and the most free , the most enlightened , the most moral , and the most religious ? Were there any rick - burners in the times of the lord abbots ? And if not , why not ? And why should the stacks of the Earls of Marney be destroyed , and those of the Abbots of Marney spared ? Brooding over these suggestions , some voices disturbed him , and looking round , he observed in the cemetery two men : one was standing beside a tomb which his companion was apparently examining . The first was of lofty stature , and though dressed with simplicity , had nothing sordid in his appearance . His garments gave no clue to his position in life : they might have been worn by a squire or by his gamekeeper ; a dark velveteen dress and leathern gaiters . As Egremont caught his form , he threw his broad - brimmed country hat upon the ground and showed a frank and manly countenance . His complexion might in youth have been ruddy , but time and time ’s attendants , thought and passion , had paled it : his chesnut hair , faded , but not grey , still clustered over a noble brow ; his features were regular and handsome , a well - formed nose , the square mouth and its white teeth , and the clear grey eye which befitted such an idiosyncracy . His time of vigorous manhood , for he was much nearer forty than fifty years of age , perhaps better suited his athletic form , than the more supple and graceful season of youth . Stretching his powerful arms in the air , and delivering himself of an exclamation which denoted his weariness , and which had broken the silence , he expressed to his companion his determination to rest himself under the shade of the yew in the contiguous garden , and inviting his friend to follow him , he took up his hat and moved away . There was something in the appearance of the stranger that interested Egremont ; and waiting till he had established himself in his pleasant resting place , Egremont descended into the cloister garden and determined to address him . “
26086	26111	26079	26079	You	1465	” said Egremont , carelessly advancing to the stranger , who looked up at him without any expression of surprise , and then replied . “
26183	26184	26180	26181	poor men	1472	” “
26201	26205	26206	26206	They	6671	” said Egremont . “

26306	26310	26316	26317	active men	1480	” said Egremont ; “

26334	26339	26325	26326	A drone	1482	” said the stranger ; “
26488	26489	26492	26492	you	1495	” “
26504	26510	26492	26492	you	1495	” said Egremont , inquiringly . “
26741	26742	26743	26743	You	1521	” “
26750	26757	26743	26743	You	1521	” said Egremont , not unmoved . “
26774	26775	26776	26776	I	0	” “
26793	26797	26776	26776	I	0	” said Egremont . “
26804	26816	26776	26776	I	0	” replied his companion , smiling , but not with bitterness . “
27005	27006	27002	27003	the people	914	” “
27019	27023	27002	27003	the people	914	” said Egremont , “
27041	27042	27038	27039	great architects	1554	” “
27049	27060	27038	27039	great architects	1554	” said the stranger , in a tone of plaintiveness ; “
27317	27318	27303	27303	they	1570	” “
27338	27339	27340	27340	They	6671	” “
27389	27394	27396	27396	travellers	1586	” said the stranger ; “
27588	27589	27578	27578	you	1592	” “
27596	27606	27590	27590	You	1592	” said Egremont , in a tone of respect . “
27618	27623	27607	27607	I	0	” said the stranger . “
27712	27713	27684	27684	you	1592	” “
27718	27731	27684	27684	you	1592	” said a voice which proceeded neither from Egremont nor the stranger , “
27778	27947	27948	27948	You	1612	” It was a still voice that uttered these words , yet one of a peculiar character ; one of those voices that instantly arrest attention : gentle and yet solemn , earnest yet unimpassioned . With a step as whispering as his tone , the man who had been kneeling by the tomb , had unobserved joined his associate and Egremont . He hardly reached the middle height ; his form slender , but well proportioned ; his pale countenance , slightly marked with the small pox , was redeemed from absolute ugliness by a highly - intellectual brow , and large dark eyes that indicated deep sensibility and great quickness of apprehension . Though young , he was already a little bald ; he was dressed entirely in black ; the fairness of his linen , the neatness of his beard , his gloves much worn , yet carefully mended , intimated that his very faded garments were the result of necessity rather than of negligence . “
27957	27961	27948	27948	You	1612	” said Egremont . “
27976	27984	27948	27948	You	1612	” said the younger of the strangers , “
27995	27996	27986	27986	I	0	” “
28019	28020	28011	28011	you	1612	” “

28036	28042	28023	28023	I	0	” said Egremont , musingly . “
28053	28059	28023	28023	I	0	” continued the younger stranger ; “
28077	28078	28082	28082	their	803	” “

28188	28189	28185	28186	no neighbour	1623	” “
28198	28244	28252	28252	it	1624	” said Egremont , struck by the observation of his companion , and relieving a perplexed spirit by an ordinary exclamation , which often denotes that the mind is more stirring than it cares to acknowledge , or at the moment is capable to express . “
28262	28267	28252	28252	it	1624	” said his companion . “
28271	28275	28252	28252	it	1624	” asked Egremont . “
28291	28292	28252	28252	it	1624	” “
28299	28303	28252	28252	it	1624	” said Egremont , “
28311	28312	28313	28313	I	0	” “
28317	28323	28313	28313	I	0	” said the younger stranger . “
28328	28334	28313	28313	I	0	” said the elder one . “
28344	28350	28341	28341	its	1626	” said Egremont slightly smiling ; “
28369	28370	28358	28359	our Queen	1627	” “
28374	28380	28382	28382	she	1627	” asked the younger stranger , “
28387	28400	28382	28382	she	1627	” The stranger paused ; Egremont was silent , but looked inquiringly . “
28403	28414	28382	28382	she	1627	” resumed the younger stranger after a moment ’s interval . “
28488	28489	28490	28490	You	0	” “
28494	28500	28490	28490	You	0	” said Egremont , hesitatingly . “
28507	28882	28883	28883	I	0	” At this moment a sudden flush of rosy light , suffusing the grey ruins , indicated that the sun had just fallen ; and through a vacant arch that overlooked them , alone in the resplendent sky , glittered the twilight star . The hour , the scene , the solemn stillness and the softening beauty , repressed controversy , induced even silence . The last words of the stranger lingered in the ear of Egremont ; his musing spirit was teeming with many thoughts , many emotions ; when from the Lady Chapel there rose the evening hymn to the Virgin . A single voice ; but tones of almost supernatural sweetness ; tender and solemn , yet flexible and thrilling . Egremont started from his reverie . He would have spoken , but he perceived that the elder of the strangers had risen from his resting - place , and with downcast eyes and crossed arms , was on his knees . The other remained standing in his former posture . The divine melody ceased ; the elder stranger rose ; the words were on the lips of Egremont , that would have asked some explanation of this sweet and holy mystery , when in the vacant and star - lit arch on which his glance was fixed , he beheld a female form . She was apparently in the habit of a Religious , yet scarcely could be a nun , for her veil , if indeed it were a veil , had fallen on her shoulders , and revealed her thick tresses of long fair hair . The blush of deep emotion lingered on a countenance , which though extremely young , was impressed with a character of almost divine majesty ; while her dark eyes and long dark lashes , contrasting with the brightness of her complexion and the luxuriance of her radiant locks , combined to produce a beauty as rare as it is choice ; and so strange , that Egremont might for a moment have been pardoned for believing her a seraph , that had lighted on this sphere , or the fair phantom of some saint haunting the sacred ruins of her desecrated fane . “
28888	28917	28883	28883	I	0	” said Lord Marney to his brother , as on the evening of the same day they were seated together in the drawing - room , in close converse “
28948	28949	28950	28950	It	1637	” “
28958	28962	28950	28950	It	1637	” said Egremont ; “
28977	28978	28993	28994	my mother	1335	” “
28986	28991	28993	28994	my mother	1335	” said Lord Marney , “

29120	29121	29122	29122	You	0	” “

29237	29242	29221	29221	she	1335	” continued Lord Marney . “
29313	29324	29325	29325	I	0	” Egremont drew up a little , but said nothing . “
29342	29347	29325	29325	I	0	” said Lord Marney . “
29359	29360	29355	29355	you	0	” “

29515	29646	29513	29513	George	338	” said Egremont , not without reluctance , yet anxious , as the ice had been broken , to bring the matter to a result . Lord Marney , before the election , had written , in reply to his mother consulting him on the step a letter with which she was delighted , but which Egremont at the time could have wished to have been more explicit . However in the excitement attendant on a first contest , and influenced by the person whose judgment always swayed , and , in the present case , was peculiarly entitled to sway him , he stifled his scruples , and persuaded himself that he was a candidate not only with the sanction , but at the instance , of his brother . “
29656	29660	29654	29654	George	338	” said Egremont . “
29765	29766	29759	29763	a cool - headed friend	1649	” “
29779	29795	29759	29763	a cool - headed friend	1649	” thought Egremont , who did not fancy too much the tone of this conversation . “
29808	29813	29759	29763	a cool - headed friend	1649	” continued Lord Marney , “
29895	29896	29897	29897	He	1652	” “
29905	29909	29899	29901	a good fellow	1653	” thought Egremont . “
29921	29926	29927	29927	I	0	” said Lord Marney ; “
29946	29947	29976	29976	they	1656	” “
29958	29962	29976	29976	they	1656	” said Egremont ; “

29986	29991	29976	29976	they	1656	” said Lord Marney ; “
30034	30035	30038	30038	George	338	” “
30056	30057	30042	30042	I	0	” “

30147	30151	30142	30142	you	338	” said Egremont . “
30158	30163	30154	30156	my dear fellow	1324	” said Lord Marney , “
30284	30285	30303	30303	you	338	” “
30288	30302	30303	30303	you	338	” said Egremont , anxious to bring his brother back to the point , “
30317	30318	30308	30308	I	0	” “
30326	30331	30323	30323	your	338	” said Lord Marney . “
30515	30538	30513	30513	her	1681	” Egremont stared at his brother , who patted him on the back with an expression of unusual kindness , and adding , “
30624	30695	30620	30620	Arabella	371	” So saying , Lord Marney , followed somewhat reluctantly by his brother , advanced to the other end of the drawing - room , where his wife was employed with her embroidery - frame , and seated next to her young friend , Miss Poinsett , who was playing chess with Captain Grouse , a member of the chess club , and one of the most capital performers extant . “
30700	30705	30698	30698	Arabella	371	” said Lord Marney , “
30766	30904	30760	30760	We	1689	” Lady Marney looked embarrassed , and a little distressed . Nothing could be more unexpected by her than this proposition ; nothing more inconvenient than the arrangement . It was very true that Lady Joan Fitz - Warene had invited them to Mowbray , and she had some vague intention , some day or other , of deliberating whether they should avail themselves of this kindness ; but to decide upon going , and upon going instantly , without the least consultation , the least inquiry as to the suitableness of the arrangement , the visit of Miss Poinsett abruptly and ungraciously terminated , for example — all this was vexatious , distressing : a mode of management which out of the simplest incidents of domestic life contrived to extract some degree of perplexity and annoyance . “
30912	30917	30907	30907	you	371	” said Lady Marney , “
30928	30929	30907	30907	you	371	” “
30934	30939	30907	30907	you	371	” said Lord Marney : “
30958	30959	30907	30907	you	371	” “
30972	30981	30965	30965	Charles	396	” said Lady Marney in a hesitating tone ; “
30993	30994	30997	30997	you	371	” “
31039	31040	31028	31028	I	0	” “
31052	31068	31041	31041	I	0	” said Lady Marney , speaking in a whisper , and looking volumes of deprecation . “
31075	31080	31081	31081	you	0	” said Lord Marney ; “
31115	31116	31089	31089	I	0	” “
31125	31141	31118	31118	you	0	” said Lady Marney , slightly blushing and speaking in a tone of gentle reproach . “
31163	31168	31212	31212	George	338	” said Lord Marney ; “
31205	31206	31212	31212	George	338	” “
31214	31215	31212	31212	George	338	” “
31283	31831	31281	31281	Arabella	371	” Lady Marney did not reply . Always sacrificed , always yielding , the moment she attempted to express an opinion , she ever seemed to assume the position not of the injured but the injurer . Arabella was a woman of abilities , which she had cultivated . She had excellent sense , and possessed many admirable qualities ; she was far from being devoid of sensibility ; but her sweet temper shrank from controversy , and Nature had not endowed her with a spirit which could direct and control . She yielded without a struggle to the arbitrary will and unreasonable caprice of a husband , who was scarcely her equal in intellect , and far her inferior in all the genial qualities of our nature , but who governed her by his iron selfishness . Lady Marney absolutely had no will of her own . A hard , exact , literal , bustling , acute being environed her existence ; directed , planned , settled everything . Her life was a series of petty sacrifices and baulked enjoyments . If her carriage were at the door , she was never certain that she would not have to send it away ; if she had asked some friends to her house , the chances were she would have to put them off ; if she were reading a novel , Lord Marney asked her to copy a letter ; if she were going to the opera , she found that Lord Marney had got seats for her and some friend in the House of Lords , and seemed expecting the strongest expressions of delight and gratitude from her for his unasked and inconvenient kindness . Lady Marney had struggled against this tyranny in the earlier days of their union . Innocent , inexperienced Lady Marney ! As if it were possible for a wife to contend against a selfish husband , at once sharp - witted and blunt - hearted ! She had appealed to him , she had even reproached him ; she had wept , once she had knelt . But Lord Marney looked upon these demonstrations as the disordered sensibility of a girl unused to the marriage state , and ignorant of the wise authority of husbands , of which he deemed himself a model . And so , after a due course of initiation , Lady Marney invisible for days , plunged in remorseful reveries in the mysteries of her boudoir , and her lord dining at his club and going to the minor theatres ; the countess was broken in , and became the perfect wife of a perfect husband . Lord Marney , who was fond of chess , turned out Captain Grouse , and very gallantly proposed to finish his game with Miss Poinsett , which Miss Poinsett , who understood Lord Marney as well as he understood chess , took care speedily to lose , so that his lordship might encounter a champion worthy of him . Egremont seated by his sister - in - law , and anxious by kind words to soothe the irritation which he had observed with pain his brother create , entered into easy talk , and after some time , said , “
31844	31856	31834	31834	you	1695	” Lady Marney looked a little surprised , and then said , “
31860	31861	31862	31862	You	1695	” “
31876	31877	31862	31862	You	1695	” “
31883	31884	31879	31879	you	1695	” “
31894	31985	31885	31889	Lady Joan Fitz - Warene	403	” The countess blushed ; the name was a clue which she could follow , but Egremont nevertheless suspected that the idea had never previously occurred to her . Lady Joan she described as not beautiful ; certainly not beautiful ; nobody would consider her beautiful , many would indeed think her quite the reverse ; and yet she had a look , one particular look when according to Lady Marney , she was more than beautiful . But she was very clever , very indeed , something quite extraordinary . “
31988	31989	31879	31879	you	1695	” “
32009	32010	32000	32000	men	803	” “
32015	32016	32000	32000	men	803	” “
32077	32078	32072	32072	she	403	” “
32089	32090	32084	32084	she	1700	” “
32107	32108	32103	32103	her	404	” “
32113	32114	32118	32118	her	404	” “
32122	32123	32115	32116	Some people	1701	” “
32138	32139	32115	32116	Some people	1701	” “
32147	32152	32115	32116	Some people	1701	” said Lady Marney ; “
32215	32216	32219	32219	you	0	” “
32227	32231	32219	32219	you	0	” said Egremont : “
32241	32242	32243	32243	We	1709	” “
32247	32263	32243	32243	We	1709	” said Lady Marney , with a sort of sigh , and shaking her head . “
32270	32271	32268	32268	Marney	402	” “
32326	32525	32324	32324	Charles	396	” Soon the dear little Poinsett was singing , much gratified by being invited to the instrument by Mr Egremont , who for a few minutes hung over her , and then evidently under the influence of her tones , walked up and down the room , and only speaking to beg that she would continue her charming performances . Lady Marney was engrossed with her embroidery ; her lord and the captain with their game . And what was Egremont thinking of ? Of Mowbray be you sure . And of Lady Joan or Lady Maud ? Not exactly . Mowbray was the name of the town to which the strangers he had met with in the Abbey were bound . It was the only piece of information that he had been able to obtain of them ; and that casually . When the fair vision of the starlit arch , about to descend to her two companions , perceived that they were in conversation with a stranger , she hesitated , and in a moment withdrew . Then the elder of the travellers , exchanging a glance with his friend , bid good even to Egremont . “
32533	32537	32538	32538	I	0	” said Egremont . “
32543	32548	32538	32538	I	0	” said the stranger , “
32554	32555	32538	32538	I	0	” “
32569	32578	32579	32579	My	0	” said he who was dressed in black . “
32585	32597	32599	32599	I	0	” said Egremont , making a desperate effort to invite communication ; “
32604	32605	32607	32607	we	1711	” “
32611	32616	32607	32607	we	1711	” said the elder ; “
32626	32934	32607	32607	we	1711	” and with a slight salute , they left Egremont alone . There was something in the manner of the elder stranger which repressed the possibility of Egremont following him . Leaving then the cloister garden in another direction , he speculated on meeting them outside the abbey . He passed through the Lady ’s chapel . The beautiful Religious was not there . He gained the west front ; no one was visible . He took a rapid survey of each side of the abbey ; not a being to be recognized . He fancied they must have advanced towards the Abbey Farm ; yet they might have proceeded further on in the dale . Perplexed , he lost time . Finally he proceeded towards the farm , but did not overtake them ; reached it , but learned nothing of them ; and arrived at his brother ’s full of a strange yet sweet perplexity . In a commercial country like England , every half century developes some new and vast source of public wealth , which brings into national notice a new and powerful class . A couple of centuries ago , a Turkey merchant was the great creator of wealth ; the West Indian Planter followed him . In the middle of the last century appeared the Nabob . These characters in their zenith in turn merged in the land , and became English aristocrats ; while the Levant decaying , the West Indies exhausted , and Hindostan plundered , the breeds died away , and now exist only in our English comedies from Wycherly and Congreve to Cumberland and Morton . The expenditure of the revolutionary war produced the Loanmonger , who succeeded the Nabob ; and the application of science to industry developed the Manufacturer , who in turn aspires to be “
32939	35407	32607	32607	we	1711	” and always will , as long as we have a territorial constitution ; a better security for the preponderance of the landed interest than any corn law , fixed or fluctuating . Of all these characters , the one that on the whole made the largest fortunes in the most rapid manner,—and we do not forget the marvels of the Waterloo loan , or the miracles of Manchester during the continental blockade — was the Anglo - East Indian about the time that Hastings was first appointed to the great viceroyalty . It was not unusual for men in positions so obscure that their names had never reached the public in this country , and who yet had not been absent from their native land for a longer period than the siege of Troy , to return with their million . One of the most fortunate of this class of obscure adventurers was a certain John Warren . A very few years before the breaking out of the American war , he was a waiter at a celebrated club in St James ’s Street : a quick yet steady young fellow ; assiduous , discreet , and very civil . In this capacity , he pleased a gentleman who was just appointed to the government of Madras , and who wanted a valet . Warren , though prudent , was adventurous ; and accepted the opening which he believed fortune offered him . He was prescient . The voyage in those days was an affair of six months . During this period , Warren still more ingratiated himself with his master . He wrote a good hand , and his master a very bad one . He had a natural talent for accounts ; a kind of information which was useful to his employer . He arrived at Madras , no longer a valet , but a private secretary . His master went out to make a fortune ; but he was indolent , and had indeed none of the qualities for success , except his great position . Warren had every quality but that . The basis of the confederacy therefore was intelligible ; it was founded on mutual interests and cemented by reciprocal assistance . The governor granted monopolies to the secretary , who apportioned a due share to his sleeping partner . There appeared one of those dearths not unusual in Hindostan ; the population of the famished province cried out for rice ; the stores of which , diminished by nature , had for months mysteriously disappeared . A provident administration it seems had invested the public revenue in its benevolent purchase ; the misery was so excessive that even pestilence was anticipated , when the great forestallers came to the rescue of the people over whose destinies they presided ; and at the same time fed and pocketed millions . This was the great stroke of the financial genius of Warren . He was satisfied . He longed once more to see St James ’s Street , and to become a member of the club , where he had once been a waiter . But he was the spoiled child of fortune , who would not so easily spare him . The governor died , and had appointed his secretary his sole executor . Not that his excellency particularly trusted his agent , but he dared not confide the knowledge of his affairs to any other individual . The estate was so complicated , that Warren offered the heirs a good round sum for his quittance , and to take the settlement upon himself . India so distant , and Chancery so near — the heirs accepted the proposition . Winding up this estate , Warren avenged the cause of plundered provinces ; and the House of Commons itself , with Burke and Francis at its head , could scarcely have mulcted the late governor more severely . A Mr Warren , of whom no one had ever heard except that he was a nabob , had recently returned from India and purchased a large estate in the north of England , was returned to Parliament one of the representatives of a close borough which he had purchased : a quiet , gentlemanlike , middle - aged man , with no decided political opinions ; and , as parties were then getting very equal , of course very much courted . The throes of Lord North ’s administration were commencing . The minister asked the new member to dine with him , and found the new member singularly free from all party prejudices . Mr Warren was one of those members who announced their determination to listen to the debates and to be governed by the arguments . All complimented him , all spoke to him . Mr Fox declared that he was a most superior man ; Mr Burke said that these were the men who could alone save the country . Mrs Crewe asked him to supper ; he was caressed by the most brilliant of duchesses . At length there arrived one of those fierce trials of strength , which precede the fall of a minister , but which sometimes from peculiar circumstances , as in the instances of Walpole and Lord North , are not immediate in their results . How would Warren vote ? was the great question . He would listen to the arguments . Burke was full of confidence that he should catch Warren . The day before the debate there was a levee , which Mr Warren attended . The sovereign stopped him , spoke to him , smiled on him , asked him many questions : about himself , the House of Commons , how he liked it , how he liked England . There was a flutter in the circle ; a new favourite at court . The debate came off , the division took place . Mr Warren voted for the minister . Burke denounced him ; the king made him a baronet . Sir John Warren made a great alliance , at least for him ; he married the daughter of an Irish earl ; became one of the king ’s friends ; supported Lord Shelburne , threw over Lord Shelburne , had the tact early to discover that Mr Pitt was the man to stick to , stuck to him . Sir John Warren bought another estate , and picked up another borough . He was fast becoming a personage . Throughout the Indian debates he kept himself extremely quiet ; once indeed in vindication of Mr Hastings , whom he greatly admired , he ventured to correct Mr Francis on a point of fact with which he was personally acquainted . He thought that it was safe , but he never spoke again . He knew not the resources of vindictive genius or the powers of a malignant imagination . Burke owed the Nabob a turn for the vote which had gained him a baronetcy . The orator seized the opportunity and alarmed the secret conscience of the Indian adventurer by his dark allusions , and his fatal familiarity with the subject . Another estate however and another borough were some consolation for this little misadventure ; and in time the French Revolution , to Sir John ’s great relief , turned the public attention for ever from Indian affairs . The Nabob from the faithful adherent of Mr Pitt had become even his personal friend . The wits indeed had discovered that he had been a waiter ; and endless were the epigrams of Fitzpatrick and the jokes of Hare ; but Mr Pitt cared nothing about the origin of his supporters . On the contrary , Sir John was exactly the individual from whom the minister meant to carve out his plebeian aristocracy ; and using his friend as a feeler before he ventured on his greater operations , the Nabob one morning was transformed into an Irish baron . The new Baron figured in his patent as Lord Fitz - Warene , his Norman origin and descent from the old barons of this name having been discovered at Herald ’s college . This was a rich harvest for Fitzpatrick and Hare ; but the public gets accustomed to everything , and has an easy habit of faith . The new Baron cared nothing for ridicule , for he was working for posterity . He was compensated for every annoyance by the remembrance that the St James ’s Street waiter was ennobled , and by his determination that his children should rank still higher in the proud peerage of his country . So he obtained the royal permission to resume the surname and arms of his ancestors , as well as their title . There was an ill - natured story set afloat , that Sir John owed this promotion to having lent money to the minister ; but this was a calumny . Mr Pitt never borrowed money of his friends . Once indeed , to save his library , he took a thousand pounds from an individual on whom he had conferred high rank and immense promotion : and this individual , who had the minister ’s bond when Mr Pitt died , insisted on his right , and actually extracted the 1,000 l. from the insolvent estate of his magnificent patron . But Mr Pitt always preferred an usurer to a friend ; and to the last day of his life borrowed money at fifty per cent . The Nabob departed this life before the Minister , but he lived long enough to realize his most aspiring dream . Two years before his death the Irish baron was quietly converted into an English peer ; and without exciting any attention , all the squibs of Fitzpatrick , all the jokes of Hare , quite forgotten , the waiter of the St James ’s Street club took his seat in the most natural manner possible in the House of Lords . The great estate of the late Lord Fitz - Warene was situated at Mowbray , a village which principally belonged to him , and near which he had raised a gothic castle , worthy of his Norman name and ancestry . Mowbray was one of those places which during the long war had expanded from an almost unknown village to a large and flourishing manufacturing town ; a circumstance , which , as Lady Marney observed , might have somewhat deteriorated the atmosphere of the splendid castle , but which had nevertheless doubled the vast rental of its lord . He who had succeeded to his father was Altamont Belvidere ( named after his mother ’s family ) Fitz - Warene , Lord Fitz - Warene . He was not deficient in abilities , though he had not his father ’s talents , but he was over - educated for his intellect ; a common misfortune . The new Lord Fitz - Warene was the most aristocratic of breathing beings . He most fully , entirely , and absolutely believed in his pedigree ; his coat of arms was emblazoned on every window , embroidered on every chair , carved in every corner . Shortly after his father ’s death he was united to the daughter of a ducal house , by whom he had a son and two daughters , chrisened by names which the ancient records of the Fitz - Warenes authorised . His son , who gave promise of abilities which might have rendered the family really distinguished , was Valence ; his daughters , Joan and Maud . All that seemed wanting to the glory of the house was a great distinction of which a rich peer , with six seats in the House of Commons , could not ultimately despair . Lord Fitz - Warene aspired to rank among the earls of England . But the successors of Mr Pitt were strong ; they thought the Fitz - Warenes had already been too rapidly advanced ; it was whispered that the king did not like the new man ; that his majesty thought him pompous , full of pretence , in short , a fool . But though the successors of Mr Pitt managed to govern the country for twenty years and were generally very strong , in such an interval of time however good their management or great their luck , there were inevitably occasions when they found themselves in difficulties , when it was necessary to conciliate the lukewarm or to reward the devoted . Lord Fitz - Warene well understood how to avail himself of these occasions ; it was astonishing how conscientious and scrupulous he became during Walcheren expeditions , Manchester massacres , Queen ’s trials . Every scrape of the government was a step in the ladder to the great borough - monger . The old king too had disappeared from the stage ; and the tawdry grandeur of the great Norman peer rather suited George the Fourth . He was rather a favourite at the Cottage ; they wanted his six votes for Canning ; he made his terms ; and one of the means by which we got a man of genius for a minister , was elevating Lord Fitz - Warene in the peerage , by the style and title of Earl de Mowbray of Mowbray Castle . We must now for a while return to the strangers of the Abbey ruins . When the two men had joined the beautiful Religious , whose apparition had so startled Egremont , they all three quitted the Abbey by a way which led them by the back of the cloister garden , and so on by the bank of the river for about a hundred yards , when they turned up the winding glen of a dried - up tributary stream . At the head of the glen , at which they soon arrived , was a beer - shop , screened by some huge elms from the winds that blew over the vast moor , which , except in the direction of Mardale , now extended as far as the eye could reach . Here the companions stopped , the beautiful Religious seated herself on a stone bench beneath the trees , while the elder stranger calling out to the inmate of the house to apprise him of his return , himself proceeded to a neighbouring shed , whence he brought forth a very small rough pony with a rude saddle , but one evidently intended for a female rider . “
35412	35419	32607	32607	we	1711	” said the taller of the men “
35464	35497	35461	35462	Saxon kings	1716	” Then leading up the pony to the Religious , he placed her on its back with gentleness and much natural grace , saying at the same time in a subdued tone , “
35512	35513	35502	35502	I	0	” “
35525	35530	35502	35502	I	0	” said the Religious , “

35551	35651	35502	35502	I	0	” said the elder of the men as he gave up his glass to their host and led off the pony , Stephen walking on its other side . Though the sun had fallen , the twilight was still glowing , and even on this wide expanse the air was still . The vast and undulating surface of the brown and purple moor , varied occasionally by some fantastic rocks , gleamed in the shifting light . Hesperus was the only star that yet was visible , and seemed to move before them and lead them on their journey . “
35655	35666	35502	35502	I	0	” said the Religious , turning to the elder stranger , “

35887	35939	35870	35870	I	0	” burst forth the Religious in a voice of thrilling melody , and she pursued for some minutes the divine canticle . Her companions gazed on her with an air of affectionate reverence as she sang ; each instant the stars becoming brighter , the wide moor assuming a darker hue . “
35947	35962	35870	35870	I	0	” said the Religious , turning her head and looking round with a smile , “

36635	36660	36628	36628	Nature	428	” said Stephen in a low voice , and speaking not without emotion . Then he continued , in a louder and brisker tone , “
36672	36673	36662	36663	this Hatton	425	” “
36730	36759	36760	36760	I	0	” After this , there was silence ; each was occupied with his thoughts , while the influence of the soft night and starry hour induced to contemplation . “
36768	36773	36760	36760	I	0	” said the Religious . “
36781	36786	36760	36760	I	0	” said her father . “
36803	37029	37030	37030	I	0	” So saying , he guided the pony to where some lights indicated the station of the railway , which here crossed the moor . There was just time to return the pony to the person at the station from whom it had been borrowed , and obtain their tickets , when the bell of the down - train sounded , and in a few minutes the Religious and her companions were on their way to Mowbray , whither a course of two hours carried them . It was two hours to midnight when they arrived at Mowbray station , which was about a quarter of a mile from the town . Labour had long ceased ; a beautiful heaven , clear and serene , canopied the city of smoke and toil ; in all directions rose the columns of the factories , dark and defined in the purple sky ; a glittering star sometimes hovering by the crest of their tall and tapering forms . The travellers proceeded in the direction of a suburb and approached the very high wall of an extensive garden . The moon rose as they reached it , tipped the trees with light , and revealed a lofty and centre portal , by the side of it a wicket at which Gerard rang . The wicket was quickly opened . “
37036	37041	37030	37030	I	0	” said the Religious , “

37091	37092	37071	37072	Sister Marion	429	” “
37104	37105	37071	37072	Sister Marion	429	” “
37112	37117	37071	37072	Sister Marion	429	” said the Religious ; “

37149	37153	37130	37130	Stephen	423	” said Gerard . “
37165	37169	37160	37160	I	0	” murmured Stephen ; “
37173	37673	37160	37160	I	0	” When Gerard and his friend quitted the convent they proceeded at a brisk pace , into the heart of the town . The streets were nearly empty ; and with the exception of some occasional burst of brawl or merriment from a beer - shop , all was still . The chief street of Mowbray , called Castle Street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighbourhood , was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence . The dimensions of Castle Street were not unworthy of the metropolis : it traversed a great portion of the town , and was proportionately wide ; its broad pavements and its blazing gas - lights indicated its modern order and prosperity ; while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses , not as beautiful as the palaces of Venice , but in their way not less remarkable ; magnificent shops ; and here and there , though rarely , some ancient factory built among the fields in the infancy of Mowbray by some mill - owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future , or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow - citizens , to foresee that the scene of his labours would be the future eye - sore of a flourishing posterity . Pursuing their course along Castle Street for about a quarter of a mile , Gerard and Stephen turned down a street which intersected it , and so on , through a variety of ways and winding lanes , till they arrived at an open portion of the town , a district where streets and squares and even rows , disappeared , and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack - looking buildings that rose in all directions , clustering yet isolated , announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of Mowbray . Crossing this open ground they gained a suburb , but one of a very different description to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with Sybil . This one was populous , noisy , and lighted . It was Saturday night ; the streets were thronged ; an infinite population kept swarming to and fro the close courts and pestilential cul - de - sacs that continually communicated with the streets by narrow archways , like the entrance of hives , so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission : while ascending to these same streets , from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night , and market for the day of rest . The bright and lively shops were crowded ; and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls , that by the aid of glaring lamps and flaunting lanthorns , displayed their wares . “
37684	37717	37722	37722	widow	1785	” said a jolly looking woman , who was presiding at a stall which , though considerably thinned by previous purchasers , still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase . “
37724	37733	37722	37722	widow	1785	” said a little pale man , wistfully . “

38155	38300	38153	38153	sir	1375	” said the widow with a stern expression to a youth who now stopped at her stall . He was about sixteen , with a lithe figure , and a handsome , faded , impudent face . His long , loose , white trousers gave him height ; he had no waistcoat , but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck , and fastened with a very large pin , which , whatever were its materials , had unquestionably a very gorgeous appearance . A loose frock - coat of a coarse white cloth , and fastened by one button round his waist , completed his habiliments , with the addition of the covering to his head , a high - crowned dark - brown hat , which relieved his complexion , and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye . “
38313	38324	38310	38311	Mother Carey	437	” said the youth with an affected air of deprecation . “

38665	38696	38661	38661	you	0	” exclaimed the widow in despair , unable to wreak her vengeance on one who kept in a secure position , and whose movements were as nimble as his words . “
38710	38763	38704	38705	Dandy Mick	440	” said a good - humoured voice , it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped . They were gaily dressed , a light handkerchief tied under the chin , their hair scrupulously arranged ; they wore coral neck - laces and earrings of gold . “
38773	38786	38768	38768	you	0	” said the widow , who was a good - hearted creature . “

39298	39299	39255	39255	Julia	443	” “
39311	39315	39303	39303	you	443	” said Mick . “

39585	39586	39583	39583	widow	1785	” “
39596	39600	39587	39587	You	1872	” said Caroline . “
39609	39616	39617	39617	I	0	” murmured Mrs Carey to herself . “
39678	39696	39699	39700	the children	1883	” continued Mrs Carey , as she took a very long pinch of snuff and deeply mused . “
39705	39713	39699	39700	the children	1883	” she added after a profound pause , “
39719	39881	39699	39700	the children	1883	” In the meantime Gerard and Stephen stopped before a tall , thin , stuccoed house , ballustraded and friezed , very much lighted both within and without , and , from the sounds that issued from it , and the persons who retired and entered , evidently a locality of great resort and bustle . A sign , bearing the title of the Cat and Fiddle , indicated that it was a place of public entertainment , and kept by one who owned the legal name of John Trottman , though that was but a vulgar appellation , lost in his well - earned and far - famed title of Chaffing Jack . The companions entered the spacious premises ; and making their way to the crowded bar , Stephen , with a glance serious but which indicated intimacy , caught the eye of a comely lady , who presided over the mysteries , and said in a low voice , “
39886	39887	39883	39883	he	1884	” “
39921	40064	39915	39915	he	1884	” Stephen whispered to Gerard and after a moment ’s pause , he asked the fair president for a couple of tickets for each of which he paid threepence ; a sum however , according to the printed declaration of the voucher , convertible into potential liquid refreshments , no great compensation to a very strict member of the Temperance Society of Mowbray . A handsome staircase with bright brass bannisters led them to an ample landing - place , on which opened a door , now closed and by which sate a boy who collected the tickets of those who would enter it . The portal was of considerable dimensions and of architectural pretension ; it was painted of a bright green colour , the panels gilt . Within the pediment , described in letters of flaming gas , you read , “
40071	40497	39915	39915	he	1884	” Gerard and Morley entered an apartment very long and sufficiently lofty , though rather narrow for such proportions . The ceiling was even richly decorated ; the walls were painted , and by a brush of considerable power . Each panel represented some well - known scene from Shakespeare , Byron , or Scott : King Richard , Mazeppa , the Lady of the Lake were easily recognized : in one panel , Hubert menaced Arthur ; here Haidee rescued Juan ; and there Jeanie Deans curtsied before the Queen . The room was very full ; some three or four hundred persons were seated in different groups at different tables , eating , drinking , talking , laughing , and even smoking , for notwithstanding the pictures and the gilding it was found impossible to forbid , though there were efforts to discourage , this practice , in the Temple of the Muses . Nothing however could be more decorous than the general conduct of the company , though they consisted principally of factory people . The waiters flew about with as much agility as if they were serving nobles . In general the noise was great , though not disagreeable ; sometimes a bell rang and there was comparative silence , while a curtain drew up at the further end of the room , opposite to the entrance , and where there was a theatre , the stage raised at a due elevation , and adorned with side scenes from which issued a lady in a fancy dress who sang a favourite ballad ; or a gentleman elaborately habited in a farmer ’s costume of the old comedy , a bob - wig , silver buttons and buckles , and blue stockings , and who favoured the company with that melancholy effusion called a comic song . Some nights there was music on the stage ; a young lady in a white robe with a golden harp , and attended by a gentleman in black mustachios . This was when the principal harpiste of the King of Saxony and his first fiddler happened to be passing through Mowbray , merely by accident , or on a tour of pleasure and instruction , to witness the famous scenes of British industry . Otherwise the audience of the Cat and Fiddle , we mean the Temple of the Muses , were fain to be content with four Bohemian brothers , or an equal number of Swiss sisters . The most popular amusements however were the “
40501	40619	39915	39915	he	1884	” by amateurs , or novices who wished to become professional . They tried their metal on an audience which could be critical . A sharp waiter , with a keen eye on the entering guests , immediately saluted Gerard and his friend , with profuse offers of hospitality : insisting that they wanted much refreshment ; that they were both very hungry and very thirsty : that , if not hungry , they should order something to drink that would give them an appetite : if not inclined to quaff , something to eat that would make them athirst . In the midst of these embarrassing attentions , he was pushed aside by his master with , “
40715	40804	40805	40805	Your	447	” The speaker was a very portly man who had passed the maturity of manhood , but active as Harlequin . He had a well - favoured countenance ; fair , good - humoured , but very sly . He was dressed like the head butler of the London Tavern , and was particular as to his white waistcoats and black silk stockings , punctilious as to his knee - buckles , proud of his diamond pin ; that is to say when he officiated at the Temple . “
40815	40819	40822	40822	you	447	” said Stephen , “
40828	40834	40839	40839	his	7041	“ Plenty to tell you , ”
40845	40967	40839	40839	his	7041	“ If information is wanted in this part of the world , I flatter myself — Come , Master Gerard , here ’s a table ; what shall I call for ? glass of the Mowbray slap - bang ? No better ; the receipt has been in our family these fifty years . Mr Morley I know wo n’t join us . Did you say a cup of tea , Mr Morley ? Water , only water ; well , that ’s strange . Boy alive there , do you hear me call ? Water wanted , glass of water for the Secretary of the Mowbray Temperance and Teatotal . Sing it out . I like titled company . Brush ! ”
40968	40980	40988	40989	their host	7041	“ And so you can give us some information about this — ”
40981	40986	40988	40989	their host	7041	“ Be back directly . ”
41015	41022	41023	41023	he	7041	“ Beg pardon , Mr Morley , ”
41032	41087	41023	41023	he	7041	“ but saw one of the American gentlemen brandishing his bowie - knife against one of my waiters ; called him Colonel ; quieted him directly ; a man of his rank brawling with a help ; oh ! no ; not to be thought of ; no squabbling here ; licence in danger . ”
41088	41093	41095	41095	Morley	447	“ You were saying — ”
41097	41185	41095	41095	Morley	447	“ Ah ! yes , about that man Hatton ; remember him perfectly well ; a matter of twenty or it may be nineteen years since he bolted . Queer fellow ; lived upon nothing ; only drank water ; no temperance and teetotal then , so no excuse . Beg pardon , Mr Morley ; no offence I hope ; ca n’t bear whims ; but respectable societies , if they do n’t drink , they make speeches , hire your rooms , leads to business . ”
41186	41191	41193	41193	Gerard	424	“ And this Hatton — ”
41195	41281	41193	41193	Gerard	424	“ Ah ! a queer fellow ; lent him a one - pound note — never saw it again — always remember it — last one - pound note I had . He offered me an old book instead ; not in my way ; took a china jar for my wife . He kept a curiosity shop ; always prowling about the country , picking up old books and hunting after old monuments ; called himself an antiquarian ; queer fellow , that Hatton . ”
41282	41291	41293	41293	Gerard	424	“ And you have heard of him since ? ”
41297	41302	41304	41305	their host	7041	“ Not a word , ”
41307	41315	41304	41305	their host	7041	“ never knew any one who had . ”
41316	41328	41330	41330	Stephen	423	“ I thought you had something to tell us about him , ”
41332	41386	41388	41389	their host	7041	“ So I have ; I can put you in the way of getting hold of him and anything else . I havn’t lived in Mowbray man and boy for fifty years ; seen it a village , and now a great town full of first - rate institutions and establishments like this , ”
41400	41418	41388	41389	their host	7041	“ I say I havn’t lived here all this time and talked to the people for nothing . ”
41419	41427	41429	41429	Gerard	424	“ Well , we are all attention , ”
41434	41437	41439	41440	their host	7041	“ Hush ! ”
41451	41485	41447	41447	he	7041	“ Now ladies , now gentlemen , if you please ; silence if you please for a song from a Polish lady . The Signora sings English like a new - born babe ; ”

41600	41607	41608	41608	he	1912	“ It ’s almost too much . ”
41611	41628	41608	41608	he	1912	“ the enthusiasm of these people . I believe they look upon me as a father . ”
41629	41641	41643	41643	Stephen	423	“ And you think you have some clue to this Hatton ? ”
41645	41653	41655	41656	their host	7041	“ They say he has no relations , ”
41658	41665	41655	41656	their host	7041	“ I have heard as much . ”
41666	41741	41608	41608	he	1912	“ Another glass of the bar mixture , Master Gerard . What did we call it ? Oh ! the bricks and beans — the Mowbray bricks and beans ; known by that name in the time of my grandfather . No more ! No use asking Mr Morley I know . Water ! well , I must say — and yet , in an official capacity , drinking water is not so unnatural . ”
41742	41746	41748	41748	Gerard	424	“ And Hatton . ”
41750	41760	41608	41608	he	1912	“ they say he has no relations , eh ? ”
41761	41792	41608	41608	he	1912	“ They do , and they say wrong . He has a relation ; he has a brother ; and I can put you in the way of finding him . ”
41793	41801	41803	41803	Gerard	424	“ Well , that looks like business , ”
41805	41812	41803	41803	Gerard	424	“ and where may he be ? ”
41813	41817	41819	41820	their host	7041	“ Not here , ”
41822	41859	41819	41820	their host	7041	“ he never put his foot in the Temple to my knowledge ; and lives in a place where they have as much idea of popular institutions as any Turks or heathen you ever heard of . ”
41860	41868	41870	41870	Stephen	423	“ And where might we find him ? ”
41872	41877	41879	41880	their host	7041	“ What ’s that ? ”
41888	41975	41879	41880	their host	7041	“ Here boys , brush about . The American gentleman is a whittling his name on that new mahogany table . Take him the printed list of rules , stuck up in a public place , under a great coat , and fine him five shillings for damaging the furniture . If he resists ( he has paid for his liquor ) , call in the police ; X. Z. No . 5 is in the bar , taking tea with your mistress . Now brush . ”
41976	41982	41994	41995	their host	7041	“ And this place is — ”
41983	41992	41994	41995	their host	7041	“ In the land of mines and minerals , ”
41997	42038	41994	41995	their host	7041	“ about ten miles from — — . He works in metals on his own account . You have heard of a place called Hell - house Yard ; well , he lives there ; and his name is Simon . ”
42039	42054	42056	42056	Gerard	424	“ And does he keep up any communication with his brother , think you ? ”
42058	42071	42073	42074	their host	7041	“ Nay , I know no more ; at least at present , ”
42076	42139	42073	42074	their host	7041	“ The secretary asked me about a person absent without leave for twenty years and who was said to have no relations , I found you one and a very near one . You are at the station and you have got your ticket . The American gentleman ’s wiolent . Here ’s the police . I must take a high tone . ”
42176	42186	42188	42190	Caroline of Harriet	444	“ Well , what do you think of it ? ”
42201	42213	42215	42215	Harriet	444	“ It ’s just what I thought the Queen lived in , ”
42217	42227	42215	42215	Harriet	444	“ but indeed I ’m all of a flutter . ”

42244	42249	42251	42251	Mick	440	“ Come along gals , ”

42293	42305	42307	42307	Mick	440	“ Well , why do n’t you come when I call , ”
42313	42377	42307	42307	Mick	440	“ I have been hallooing these ten minutes . Couple of glasses of bar mixture for these ladies and go of gin for myself . And I say waiter , stop , stop , do n’t be in such a deuced hurry ; do you think folks can drink without eating;—sausages for three ; and damme , take care they are not burnt . ”
42378	42387	42215	42215	Harriet	444	“ Yes , sir , directly , directly . ”
42388	42399	42401	42401	Mick	440	“ That ’s the way to talk to these fellows , ”
42420	42427	42429	42429	Mick	440	“ It ’s pretty Miss Harriet , ”
42442	42449	42451	42451	Harriet	465	“ Oh ! it is beautiful , ”
42453	42474	42475	42475	he	440	“ You never were here before ; it ’s the only place . That ’s the Lady of the Lake , ”

42534	42541	42543	42543	Mick	440	“ Are the plates very hot ? ”
42545	42549	42543	42543	Mick	440	“ Very sir . ”
42550	42557	42559	42559	Mick	440	“ Hot plates half the battle , ”
42561	42591	42559	42559	Mick	440	“ Now , Caroline ; here , Miss Harriet ; do n’t take away your plate , wait for the mash ; they mash their taters here very elegant . ”
42615	42618	42620	42620	he	440	“ Well , ”
42639	42642	42644	42644	Mick	440	“ Well , ”

44041	44059	44039	44039	Mick	440	“ and so suppose we order a go of gin and talk this matter of temperance over . ”
44081	44097	44099	44099	Mick	440	“ I suppose you have heard this last dodge of Shuffle and Screw , Dusty , ”

44170	44243	44244	44244	he	2006	“ I really think that those Shuffle and Screws are worse even than Truck and Trett . You knew where you were with those fellows ; it was five - and - twenty per cent , off wages and very bad stuff for your money . But as for Shuffle and Screw , what with their fines and their keys , a man never knows what he has to spend . Come , ”
44250	44261	44244	44244	he	2006	“ let ’s have a toast — Confusion to Capital . ”
44262	44268	44270	44270	Mick	440	“ That ’s your sort , ”
44272	44333	44270	44270	Mick	440	“ Come , Caroline ; drink to your partner ’s toast , Miss Harriet . Money ’s the root of all evil , which nobody can deny . We ’ll have the rights of labour yet ; the ten - hour bill , no fines , and no individuals admitted to any work who have not completed their sixteenth year . ”
44334	44339	44341	44341	Caroline	444	“ No , fifteen , ”
44344	44355	44357	44357	Devilsdust	467	“ The people wo n’t bear their grievances much longer , ”
44359	44371	44373	44373	Caroline	444	“ I think one of the greatest grievances the people have , ”
44375	44393	44373	44373	Caroline	444	“ is the beaks serving notice on Chaffing Jack to shut up the Temple on Sunday nights . ”
44394	44399	44401	44401	Mick	440	“ It is infamous , ”
44403	44438	44401	44401	Mick	440	“ aynt we to have no recreation ? One might as well live in Suffolk , where the immigrants come from , and where they are obliged to burn ricks to pass the time . ”
44439	44447	44449	44449	Harriet	444	“ As for the rights of labour , ”
44451	44461	44449	44449	Harriet	444	“ the people goes for nothing with this machinery . ”
44462	44478	44480	44480	Mick	440	“ And you have opened your mouth to say a very sensible thing Miss Harriet , ”
44482	44545	44480	44480	Mick	440	“ but if I were Lord Paramount for eight - and - forty hours , I ’d soon settle that question . Would n’t I fire a broadside into their ‘ double deckers ? ’ The battle of Navarino at Mowbray fair with fourteen squibs from the admiral ’s ship going off at the same time , should be nothing to it . ”
44546	44557	44559	44559	Devilsdust	467	“ Labour may be weak , but Capital is weaker , ”
44561	44568	44559	44559	Devilsdust	467	“ Their capital is all paper . ”
44569	44575	44577	44577	Mick	440	“ I tell you what , ”
44590	44612	44577	44577	Mick	440	“ The only thing , my hearties , that can save this here nation , is — a — good strike . ”
44613	44621	44623	44627	the groom of the chambers	2007	“ Your lordship ’s dinner is served , ”
44931	44938	44940	44942	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ You came by the railroad ? ”
44949	44959	44961	44962	her ladyship	6220	“ From Marham ; about ten miles from us , ”
44964	44969	44961	44962	her ladyship	6220	“ A great revolution ! ”
44970	44975	44940	44942	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Is n’t it ? ”
44976	44988	44993	44993	his	6586	“ I fear it has a very dangerous tendency to equality , ”
44996	45010	44993	44993	his	6586	“ I suppose Lord Marney gives them all the opposition in his power . ”
45011	45022	45024	45025	Lady Marney	2030	“ There is nobody so violent against railroads as George , ”
45027	45051	45024	45025	Lady Marney	2030	“ I can not tell you what he does not do ! He organized the whole of our division against the Marham line ! ”
45052	45059	45061	45063	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ I rather counted on him , ”
45065	45086	45061	45063	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ to assist me in resisting this joint branch here ; but I was surprised to learn he had consented . ”
45087	45095	45098	45099	Lady Marney	2031	“ Not until the compensation was settled , ”
45101	45125	45098	45099	Lady Marney	2031	“ George never opposes them after that . He gave up all opposition to the Marham line when they agreed to his terms . ”
45126	45130	45132	45134	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ And yet , ”
45136	45214	45132	45134	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ I think if Lord Marney would take a different view of the case and look to the moral consequences , he would hesitate . Equality , Lady Marney , equality is not our metier . If we nobles do not make a stand against the levelling spirit of the age , I am at a loss to know who will fight the battle . You many depend upon it that these railroads are very dangerous things . ”
45215	45333	45098	45099	Lady Marney	2031	“ I have no doubt of it . I suppose you have heard of Lady Vanilla ’s trip from Birmingham ? Have you not , indeed ! She came up with Lady Laura , and two of the most gentlemanlike men sitting opposite her ; never met , she says , two more intelligent men . She begged one of them at Wolverhampton to change seats with her , and he was most politely willing to comply with her wishes , only it was necessary that his companion should move at the same time , for they were chained together ! Two of the swell mob , sent to town for picking a pocket at Shrewsbury races . ”
45334	45347	45349	45350	Lord Mowbray	402	“ A countess and a felon ! So much for public conveyances , ”
45352	45366	45349	45350	Lord Mowbray	402	“ But Lady Vanilla is one of those who will talk with everybody . ”
45367	45374	45376	45377	Lady Marney	2032	“ She is very amusing though , ”
45379	45386	45388	45390	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ I dare say she is , ”
45392	45418	45388	45390	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ but believe me , my dear Lady Marney , in these times especially , a countess has something else to do than be amusing . ”
45419	45443	45349	45350	Lord Mowbray	402	“ You think as property has its duties as well as its rights , rank has its bores as well as its pleasures . ”
45448	45457	45444	45445	Lord Mowbray	402	“ How do you do , Mr Jermyn ? ”
45480	45501	45502	45502	she	2033	“ when did you arrive in the North ? I have been fighting your battles finely since I saw you , ”
45518	45556	45558	45559	Mr Jermyn	478	“ You are always fighting one ’s battles Lady Firebrace ; it is very kind of you . If it were not for you , we should none of us know how much we are all abused , ”
45564	45574	45576	45577	Lady Firebrace	365	“ They say you gave the most radical pledges , ”
45585	45611	45576	45577	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I heard Lord Muddlebrains say that if he had had the least idea of your principles , you would not have had his influence . ”
45612	45621	45623	45624	Mr Jermyn	478	“ Muddlebrains ca n’t command a single vote , ”
45626	45661	45623	45624	Mr Jermyn	478	“ He is a political humbug , the greatest of all humbugs ; a man who swaggers about London clubs and consults solemnly about his influence , and in the country is a nonentity . ”
45662	45674	45676	45677	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Well , that ca n’t be said of Lord Clarinel , ”
45679	45692	45694	45695	Mr Jermyn	478	“ And have you been defending me against Lord Clarinel ’s attacks ? ”
45697	45719	45694	45695	Mr Jermyn	478	“ No ; but I am going to Wemsbury , and then I have no doubt I shall have the opportunity . ”
45720	45728	45730	45731	Mr Jermyn	478	“ I am going to Wemsbury myself , ”
45733	45748	45730	45731	Mr Jermyn	478	“ And what does Lord Clarinel think of your pledge about the pension list ? ”
45756	45762	45764	45765	Mr Jermyn	478	“ He never told me , ”
45767	45779	45764	45765	Mr Jermyn	478	“ I believe you did not pledge yourself to the ballot ? ”
45790	45800	45802	45803	Mr Jermyn	478	“ It is a subject that requires some reflection , ”
45805	45843	45845	45846	Mr Jermyn	478	“ I must consult some profound politician like Lady Firebrace . By the bye , you told my mother that the conservatives would have a majority of fifteen . Do you think they will have as much ? ”
45868	45880	45882	45883	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I said Mr Tadpole gave us a majority of fifteen , ”
45885	45933	45934	45934	she	365	“ I knew he was in error ; because I had happened to see Lord Melbourne ’s own list , made up to the last hour ; and which gave the government a majority of sixty . It was only shown to three members of the cabinet , ”
46282	46296	46298	46300	Sir Vavasour Firebrace	388	“ I must get you to interest Lord de Mowbray in our cause , ”
46313	46415	46310	46311	Lady Joan	403	“ I have sent him a large packet of documents . You know , he is one of us ; still one of us . Once a baronet , always a baronet . The dignity merges , but does not cease ; and happy as I am to see one covered with high honours , who is in every way so worthy of them , still I confess to you it is not so much as Earl de Mowbray that your worthy father interests me , as in his undoubted character and capacity of Sir Altamont Fitz - Warene , baronet . ”
46416	46430	46432	46433	Lady Joan	403	“ You have the data on which you move I suppose well digested , ”
46440	46479	46432	46433	Lady Joan	403	“ The case is clear ; as far as equity is concerned , irresistible ; indeed the late king pledged himself to a certain point . But if you would do me the favour of reading our memorial . ”
46480	46492	46494	46495	Lady Joan	403	“ The proposition is not one adapted to our present civilisation , ”
46497	46561	46494	46495	Lady Joan	403	“ A baronetcy has become the distinction of the middle class ; a physician , our physician for example , is a baronet ; and I dare say some of our tradesmen ; brewers , of people of that class . An attempt to elevate them into an order of nobility , however inferior , would partake in some degree of the ridiculous . ”
46562	46573	46432	46433	Lady Joan	403	“ And has the duke escaped his gout this year ? ”
46582	46610	46432	46433	Lady Joan	403	“ A very slight touch ; I never knew my father so well . I expect you will meet him here . We look for him daily . ”
46611	46636	46432	46433	Lady Joan	403	“ I shall be delighted ; I hope he will come to Marney in October . I keep the blue ribbon cover for him . ”
46637	46645	46647	46647	Egremont	290	“ What you suggest is very just , ”
46652	46755	46647	46647	Egremont	290	“ If we only in our own spheres made the exertion , the general effect would be great . Marney Abbey , for instance , I believe one of the finest of our monastic remains,—that indeed is not disputed — diminished yearly to repair barns ; the cattle browsing in the nave ; all this might be prevented . If my brother would not consent to preserve or to restore , still any member of the family , even I , without expense , only with a little zeal as you say , might prevent mischief , might stop at least demolition . ”
46756	46772	46774	46775	Lady Maud	404	“ If this movement in the church had only revived a taste for Christian architecture , ”
46777	46834	46774	46775	Lady Maud	404	“ it would not have been barren , and it has done so much more ! But I am surprised that old families can be so dead to our national art ; so full of our ancestors , their exploits , their mind . Indeed you and I have no excuse for such indifference Mr Egremont . ”
46835	46851	46853	46853	Egremont	290	“ And I do not think I shall ever again be justly accused of it , ”
46855	46901	46853	46853	Egremont	290	“ you plead its cause so effectively . But to tell you the truth , I have been thinking of late about these things ; monasteries and so on ; the influence of the old church system on the happiness and comfort of the People . ”
46902	46917	46919	46920	Lady Maud	404	“ And on the tone of the Nobles — do not you think so ? ”
46922	46982	46919	46920	Lady Maud	404	“ I know it is the fashion to deride the crusades , but do not you think they had their origin in a great impulse , and in a certain sense , led to great results ? Pardon me , if I speak with emphasis , but I never can forget I am a daughter of the first crusaders . ”
46983	46995	46997	46997	Egremont	290	“ The tone of society is certainly lower than of yore , ”
46999	47052	46997	46997	Egremont	290	“ It is easy to say we view the past through a fallacious medium . We have however ample evidence that men feel less deeply than of old and act with less devotion . But how far is this occasioned by the modern position of our church ? That is the question . ”
47053	47064	47066	47067	Lady Maud	404	“ You must speak to Mr St Lys about that , ”
47069	47075	47076	47076	she	404	“ Do you know him ? ”
47083	47090	47076	47076	she	404	“ No ; is he here ? ”
47091	47096	47076	47076	she	404	“ Next to mamma . ”
47652	47661	47666	47669	the monks of Mowbray	2077	“ because it possessed such a beautiful church . ”
47821	47824	47810	47817	The principal tradesmen of the neighbouring great houses	2106	“ aristocratic ; ”
47958	47963	47979	47981	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ the Unknown God . ”
47964	47977	47983	47983	himself	402	“ And how do you find the people about you , Marney ? ”
47991	47999	48001	48002	the earl	6382	“ All very well , my lord , ”
48113	48116	48110	48111	each other	6085	“ Infantado , ”
48117	48120	48275	48277	Mr St Lys	484	“ Sidonia , ”
48121	48124	48110	48111	each other	6085	“ Ossuna , ”
48145	48155	48157	48159	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ They begin to get a little uneasy here , ”
48161	48169	48171	48172	Lord Marney	402	“ We have nothing to complain of , ”
48174	48253	48171	48172	Lord Marney	402	“ We continue reducing the rates , and as long as we do that the country must improve . The workhouse test tells . We had the other day a case of incendiarism , which frightened some people : but I inquired into it , and am quite satisfied it originated in purely accidental circumstances ; at least nothing to do with wages . I ought to be a judge , for it was on my own property . ”
48254	48273	48275	48277	Mr St Lys	484	“ And what is the rate of wages , in your part of the world , Lord Marney ? ”
48283	48331	48275	48277	Mr St Lys	484	“ Oh ! good enough : not like your manufacturing districts ; but people who work in the open air , instead of a furnace , ca n’t expect , and do n’t require such . They get their eight shillings a week ; at least generally . ”
48332	48338	48340	48342	Mr St Lys	484	“ Eight shillings a week ! ”
48344	48365	48340	48342	Mr St Lys	484	“ Can a labouring man with a family , perhaps of eight children , live on eight shillings a week ! ”
48366	48373	48375	48376	Lord Marney	402	“ Oh ! as for that , ”
48378	48441	48375	48376	Lord Marney	402	“ they get more than that , because there is beer - money allowed , at least to a great extent among us , though I for one do not approve of the practice , and that makes nearly a shilling per week additional ; and then some of them have potatoe grounds , though I am entirely opposed to that system . “
48445	48451	48375	48376	Lord Marney	402	” said Mr St Lys , “
48462	48463	48375	48376	Lord Marney	402	” “
48470	48475	48476	48476	I	0	” said Lord Marney , “
48508	48509	48500	48500	They	2127	” “
48519	48525	48500	48500	They	2127	” said Mr St Lys ; “
48662	48693	48694	48694	They	2139	” Lord Marney looked up at Mr St Lys , with a stare of high - bred impertinence , and then carelessly observed , without directing his words to him , “
48710	48711	48712	48712	I	0	” “
48724	48730	48712	48712	I	0	” said Mr St Lys ; “
48752	48760	48762	48763	Lord Marney	402	“ It comes to the same thing , ”
48765	48839	48762	48763	Lord Marney	402	“ Nothing can put this country right but emigration on a great scale ; and as the government do not choose to undertake it , I have commenced it for my own defence on a small scale . I will take care that the population of my parishes is not increased . I build no cottages and I destroy all I can ; and I am not ashamed or afraid to say so . ”
48840	48851	48853	48855	Mr St Lys	484	“ You have declared war to the cottage , then , ”
48859	48877	48853	48855	Mr St Lys	484	“ It is not at the first sound so startling a cry as war to the castle . ”
48878	48888	48890	48891	Lord Mowbray	402	“ But you think it may lead to it ? ”
48893	48904	48906	48908	Mr St Lys	484	“ I love not to be a prophet of evil , ”
48940	48947	48948	48949	Lady Maud	404	“ the question of the day ; ”
48963	48992	48956	48958	Mr St Lys	484	“ Mr Egremont has a great feeling for Christian architecture , Mr St Lys , and wishes particularly to visit our church of which we are so proud . ”
49025	49035	49036	49036	he	484	“ Oh ! how I envy you at Marney , ”
49039	49061	49036	49036	he	484	“ No manufactures , no smoke ; living in the midst of a beautiful park and surrounded by a contented peasantry ! ”
49062	49068	49070	49071	Lady Marney	2147	“ It is very delightful , ”
49073	49088	49070	49071	Lady Marney	2147	“ but then we are so very dull ; we have really no neighbourhood . ”
49089	49098	49100	49101	Lady Mowbray	402	“ I think that such a great advantage , ”
49103	49228	49100	49101	Lady Mowbray	402	“ I must say I like my friends from London . I never know what to say to the people here . Excellent people , the very best people in the world ; the way they behaved to poor dear Fitz - Warene , when they wanted him to stand for the county , I never can forget ; but then they do not know the people we know , or do the things we do ; and when you have gone through the routine of county questions , and exhausted the weather and all the winds , I am positively , my dear Lady Marney , aux abois , and then they think you are proud , when really one is only stupid . ”
49229	49237	49239	49240	Lady Marney	2148	“ I am very fond of work , ”
49242	49252	49239	49240	Lady Marney	2148	“ and I talk to them always about it . ”
49253	49307	49100	49101	Lady Mowbray	402	“ Ah ! you are fortunate , I never could work ; and Joan and Maud , they neither of them work . Maud did embroider a banner once for her brother ; it is in the hail . I think it beautiful ; but somehow or other she never cultivated her talent . ”
49308	49318	49320	49322	Mr St Lys	484	“ For all that has occurred or may occur , ”
49326	49471	49324	49324	Egremont	290	“ I blame only the Church . The church deserted the people ; and from that moment the church has been in danger and the people degraded . Formerly religion undertook to satisfy the noble wants of human nature , and by its festivals relieved the painful weariness of toil . The day of rest was consecrated , if not always to elevated thought , at least to sweet and noble sentiments . The church convened to its solemnities under its splendid and almost celestial roofs amid the finest monuments of art that human hands have raised , the whole Christian population ; for there , in the presence of God , all were brethren . It shared equally among all its prayer , its incense , and its music ; its sacred instructions , and the highest enjoyments that the arts could afford . ”
49472	49484	49100	49101	Lady Mowbray	402	“ You believe then in the efficacy of forms and ceremonies ? ”
49485	49543	49100	49101	Lady Mowbray	402	“ What you call forms and ceremonies represent the divinest instincts of our nature . Push your aversion to forms and ceremonies to a legitimate conclusion , and you would prefer kneeling in a barn rather than in a cathedral . Your tenets would strike at the very existence of all art , which is essentially spiritual . ”
49544	49551	49553	49553	Egremont	290	“ I am not speaking abstractedly , ”
49555	49589	49553	49553	Egremont	290	“ but rather with reference to the indirect connection of these forms and ceremonies with another church . The people of this country associate them with an enthralling superstition and a foreign dominion . ”
49590	49594	49596	49598	Mr St Lys	484	“ With Rome , ”
49600	49609	49596	49598	Mr St Lys	484	“ yet forms and ceremonies existed before Rome . ”
49610	49614	49616	49616	Egremont	290	“ But practically , ”
49618	49641	49616	49616	Egremont	290	“ has not their revival in our service at the present day a tendency to restore the Romish system in this country ? ”
49642	49661	49663	49665	Mr St Lys	484	“ It is difficult to ascertain what may be the practical effect of certain circumstances among the uninformed , ”
49667	49936	49663	49665	Mr St Lys	484	“ The church of Rome is to be respected as the only Hebraeo - christian church extant ; all other churches established by the Hebrew apostles have disappeared , but Rome remains ; and we must never permit the exaggerated position which it assumed in the middle centuries to make us forget its early and apostolical character , when it was fresh from Palestine and as it were fragrant from Paradise . The church of Rome is sustained by apostolical succession ; but apostolical succession is not an institution complete in itself ; it is a part of a whole ; if it be not part of a whole it has no foundation . The apostles succeeded the prophets . Our Master announced himself as the last of the prophets . They in their turn were the heirs of the patriarchs : men who were in direct communication with the Most High . To men not less favoured than the apostles , the revelation of the priestly character was made , and those forms and ceremonies ordained , which the church of Rome has never relinquished . But Rome did not invent them : upon their practice , the duty of all congregations , we can not consent to her founding a claim to supremacy . For would you maintain then that the church did not exist in the time of the prophets ? Was Moses then not a churchman ? And Aaron , was he not a high priest ? Ay ! greater than any pope or prelate , whether he be at Rome or at Lambeth . “
50235	50565	50566	50566	Simmons	492	” It was a cloudy , glimmering dawn . A cold withering east wind blew through the silent streets of Mowbray . The sounds of the night had died away , the voices of the day had not commenced . There reigned a stillness complete and absorbing . Suddenly there is a voice , there is movement . The first footstep of the new week of toil is heard . A man muffled up in a thick coat , and bearing in his hand what would seem at the first glance to be a shepherd ’s crook , only its handle is much longer , appears upon the pavement . He touches a number of windows with great quickness as he moves rapidly along . A rattling noise sounds upon each pane . The use of the long handle of his instrument becomes apparent as he proceeds , enabling him as it does to reach the upper windows of the dwellings whose inmates he has to rouse . Those inmates are the factory girls , who subscribe in districts to engage these heralds of the dawn ; and by a strict observance of whose citation they can alone escape the dreaded fine that awaits those who have not arrived at the door of the factory before the bell ceases to sound . The sentry in question , quitting the streets , and stooping through one of the small archways that we have before noticed , entered a court . Here lodged a multitude of his employers ; and the long crook as it were by some sleight of hand seemed sounding on both sides and at many windows at the same moment . Arrived at the end of the court , he was about to touch the window of the upper story of the last tenement , when that window opened , and a man , pale and care - worn and in a melancholy voice spoke to him . “
50568	50573	50566	50566	Simmons	492	” said the man , “
50589	50590	50592	50592	she	1767	” “

50649	50662	50626	50626	she	1767	” said the watchman , in a tone not devoid of sympathy . “
50677	50683	50626	50626	she	1767	” replied the man mournfully . “

50762	50955	50742	50742	neighbour	1791	” said the man ; and leaving the window open , he retired into his room . It was a single chamber of which he was the tenant . In the centre , placed so as to gain the best light which the gloomy situation could afford , was a loom . In two corners of the room were mattresses placed on the floor , a check curtain hung upon a string if necessary concealing them . In one was his sick wife ; in the other , three young children : two girls , the eldest about eight years of age ; between them their baby brother . An iron kettle was by the hearth , and on the mantel - piece , some candles , a few lucifer matches , two tin mugs , a paper of salt , and an iron spoon . In a farther part , close to the wall , was a heavy table or dresser ; this was a fixture , as well as the form which was fastened by it . The man seated himself at his loom ; he commenced his daily task . “
50989	51030	51031	51031	I	0	” And he looked around him at his chamber without resources : no food , no fuel , no furniture , and four human beings dependent on him , and lying in their wretched beds because they had no clothes . “
51038	51042	51031	51031	I	0	” he continued , “
51179	51296	51300	51301	the Capitalist	2186	“ Then why am I here ? Why am I , and six hundred thousand subjects of the Queen , honest , loyal , and industrious , why are we , after manfully struggling for years , and each year sinking lower in the scale , why are we driven from our innocent and happy homes , our country cottages that we loved , first to bide in close towns without comforts , and gradually to crouch into cellars , or find a squalid lair like this , without even the common necessaries of existence ; first the ordinary conveniences of life , then raiment , and , at length , food , vanishing from us . “
51416	51461	51402	51402	they	2195	“ If a society that has been created by labour suddenly becomes independent of it , that society is bound to maintain the race whose only property is labour , from the proceeds of that property , which has not ceased to be productive . “

51605	51632	51603	51603	Harriet	465	” said his wife moving in her bed . The Hand - Loom weaver was recalled from his reverie to the urgent misery that surrounded him . “

Sybil untied the basket , and gave a piece of sugar to the screaming infant . Her glance was sweeter even than her remedy ; the infant stared at her with his large blue eyes ; for an instant astonished , and then he smiled . “
53500	53517	53404	53404	Harold	292	” exclaimed Sybil ; and she took the babe up from the mattress and embraced it . “

53557	53576	53547	53547	Harriet	465	” Sybil drew forth the contents of the convent basket , and called Warner ’s attention to them . “

53611	53623	53607	53607	Harold	292	” and the dog laid himself down in the remotest corner . “
53631	53638	53627	53627	Gerard	430	” said the weaver ’s wife . “

53888	53934	53872	53873	The police	7267	” Sybil and Warner re - entered ; the fire was lit , the tea made , the meal partaken . An air of comfort , even of enjoyment , was diffused over this chamber , but a few minutes back so desolate and unhappy . “
53937	53951	53872	53873	The police	7267	” said the wife , raising herself a little up in her bed , “
54024	54031	54020	54020	I	0	” she added , addressing Sybil , “

54175	54296	54305	54305	God	398	” said Warner in a voice of great emotion . There was silence ; the querulous spirit of the wife was subdued by the tone of Sybil ; she revolved in her mind the present and the past ; the children pursued their ungrudged and unusual meal ; the daughter of Gerard , that she might not interfere with their occupation , walked to the window and surveyed the chink of troubled sky , which was visible in the court . The wind blew in gusts ; the rain beat against the glass . Soon after this , there was another knock at the door . Harold started from his repose , and growled . Warner rose , and saying , “
54311	54326	54307	54307	I	0	” advanced and opened the door . Two men offered with courtesy to enter . “
54331	54339	54329	54329	strangers	2312	” said he who took the lead , “

54728	54744	54745	54745	Sister	429	” During this ebullition , Mr St Lys had surveyed the apartment and recognised Sybil . “
54747	54758	54745	54745	Sister	429	” he said when the wife of Warner had ceased , “
54774	54843	54717	54717	she	2327	” Sybil bent in silence , and moved as if she were about to retire : the wind and rain came dashing against the window . The companion of Mr St Lys , who was clad in a rough great coat , and was shaking the wet off an oilskin hat known by the name of a ‘ south - wester , ’ advanced and said to her , “
54867	54879	54880	54880	I	0	” She received this remark with courtesy but did not reply . “

55538	55651	55660	55660	Charles	396	” And that blood mantled to her cheek as she ceased to speak , and her dark eye gleamed with emotion , and an expression of pride and courage hovered on her brow . Egremont caught her glance and withdrew his own ; his heart was troubled . St Lys . who had been in conference with the weaver , left him and went to the bedside of his wife . Warner advanced to Sybil , and expressed his feelings for her father , his sense of her goodness . She , observing that the squall seemed to have ceased , bade him farewell , and calling Harold , quitted the chamber . “

56104	56224	56373	56374	The Duke	1216	“ Enjoin fiddle - stick ! How came you to be talking to such a sanctified imposter ; and , I believe , with all his fine phrases , a complete radical . I tell you what , Charles , you must really make way with Lady Joan . The grandfather has come to - day , the old Duke . Quite a family party . It looks so well . Never was such a golden opportunity . And you must be sharp too . That little Jermyn , with his brown eyes and his white hands , has not come down here , in the month of August , with no sport of any kind , for nothing . ”
56225	56234	56373	56374	The Duke	1216	“ I shall set Lady Firebrace at him . ”
56235	56372	56373	56374	The Duke	1216	“ She is quite your friend , and a very sensible woman too , Charles , and an ally not to be despised . Lady Joan has a very high opinion of her . There ’s the bell . Well , I shall tell Arabella that you mean to put up the steam , and Lady Firebrace shall keep Jermyn off . And perhaps it is as well you did not seem too eager at first . Mowbray Castle , my dear fellow , in spite of its manufactories , is not to be despised . And with a little firmness , you could keep the people out of your park . Mowbray could do it , only he has no pluck . He is afraid people would say he was the son of a footman . ”
57268	57379	57380	57385	The Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine	500	“ that all was right there ; that his grace only watched his opportunity ; that he was heartily sick of the present men ; indeed , would have gone over with Lord Stanley in 1835 , had he not had a fit of the gout , which prevented him from coming up from the north ; and though to be sure his son and brother did vote against the speaker , still that was a mistake ; if a letter had been sent , which was not written , they would have voted the other way , and perhaps Sir Robert might have been in at the present moment . ”

58015	58025	58012	58012	her	365	“ Lord Haddington will not go to Ireland again , ”
58032	58130	58012	58012	her	365	“ mark me . And Lord De Grey does not like to go ; and if he did , there are objections . And the Duke of Northumberland , he will not go . And who else is there ? We must have a nobleman of the highest rank for Ireland ; one who has not mixed himself up with Irish questions ; who has always been in old days for emancipation ; a conservative , not an orangeman . You understand . That is the person Sir Robert will send , and whom Sir Robert wants . ”
58131	58143	58145	58146	the duke	1216	“ He will have some difficulty in finding such a person , ”
58148	58227	58232	58232	his	1233	“ If , indeed , the blundering affair of 1834 had not occurred , and things had taken their legitimate course , and we had seen a man like Lord Stanley for instance at the head of affairs , or leading a great party , why then indeed your friends the conservatives,—for every sensible man must be a conservative , in the right sense of the word,—would have stood in a very different position ; but now — , ”
58235	58250	58252	58253	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Sir Robert will never consent to form a government again without Lord Stanley , ”
58255	58259	58261	58262	the duke	1216	“ Perhaps not , ”
58264	58290	58292	58293	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Do you know whose name I have heard mentioned in a certain quarter as the person Sir Robert would wish to see in Ireland ? ”
58301	58309	58311	58312	Lady Firebrace	365	“ The Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine , ”
58314	58318	58320	58321	the duke	1216	“ Quite impossible , ”
58323	58464	58320	58321	the duke	1216	“ I am no party man ; if I be anything , I am a supporter of the government . True it is I do not like the way they are going on , and I disapprove of all their measures ; but we must stand by our friends , Lady Firebrace . To be sure , if the country were in danger , and the Queen personally appealed to one , and the conservative party were really a conservative party , and not an old crazy faction vamped up and whitewashed into decency — one might pause and consider . But I am free to confess I must see things in a very different condition to what they are at present before I could be called upon to take that step . I must see men like Lord Stanley — ”
58465	58514	58292	58293	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I know what you are going to say , my dear Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine . I tell you again Lord Stanley is with us , heart and soul ; and before long I feel persuaded I shall see your grace in the Castle of Dublin . ”
58515	58529	58531	58536	the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine	2437	“ I am too old ; at least , I am afraid so , ”
59505	59516	59497	59497	Gerard	424	“ Early hours on Saturday afternoon make us all saunterers ; ”
59588	59594	59596	59596	Gerard	424	“ There is my home , ”
59725	59738	59774	59777	a hale old woman	2570	“ And you are well lodged ! Your garden does you honour . ”
59739	59755	59757	59757	Gerard	424	“ I ’ll be honest enough to own I have no claim to the credit , ”
59759	59767	59757	59757	Gerard	424	“ I am but a lazy chiel . ”
59781	59799	59801	59801	Gerard	424	“ She is too old to be my wife , and too young to be my mother , ”
59804	59826	59827	59827	he	424	“ but she is a good creature , and has looked after me many a long day . Come , dame , ”
59830	59846	59847	59847	he	424	“ thou’lt bring us a cup of tea ; ‘ tis a good evening beverage , ”
59854	59879	59847	59847	he	424	“ and what I ever take at this time . And if you care to light a pipe , you will find a companion . ”
59880	59886	59888	59888	Egremont	290	“ I have renounced tobacco , ”
59890	59898	59888	59888	Egremont	290	“ tobacco is the tomb of love , ”
60046	60076	60034	60034	he	290	“ Ah ! I see you think me as great a scholar as I am a gardener : but with as little justice ; these hooks are not mine . ”
60077	60083	60085	60085	Egremont	290	“ To whomsoever they belong , ”
60087	60104	60085	60085	Egremont	290	“ if we are to judge from his collection , he has a tolerably strong head . ”
60105	60110	60112	60112	Gerard	424	“ Ay , ay , ”
60114	60177	60112	60112	Gerard	424	“ the world will hear of him yet , though he was only a workman , and the son of a workman . He has not been at your schools and your colleges , but he can write his mother tongue , as Shakespeare and Cobbett wrote it ; and you must do that , if you wish to influence the people . ”
60178	60186	60188	60188	Egremont	290	“ And might I ask his name , ”
60190	60197	60188	60188	Egremont	290	“ Stephen Morley , my friend . ”
60198	60209	60085	60085	Egremont	290	“ The person I saw with you at Marney Abbey ? ”
60210	60214	60085	60085	Egremont	290	“ The same . ”
60215	60222	60188	60188	Egremont	290	“ And he lives with you ? ”
60223	60264	60266	60266	Gerard	424	“ Why , we kept house together , if you could call it so . Stephen does not give much trouble in that way . He only drinks water and only eats herbs and fruits . He is the gardener , ”
60270	60284	60266	60266	Gerard	424	“ I do n’t know how we shall fare when he leaves me . ”
60285	60294	60188	60188	Egremont	290	“ And is he going to leave you ? ”
60295	60410	60412	60412	Gerard	424	“ Why in a manner he has gone . He has taken a cottage about a quarter of a mile up the dale ; and only left his books here , because he is going into — shire in a day or two , on some business , that may be will take him a week or so . The books are safer here you see for the present , for Stephen lives alone , and is a good deal away , for he edits a paper at Mowbray , and that must be looked after . He is to be my gardener still . I promised him that . Well done , dame , ”
60420	60459	60412	60412	Gerard	424	“ I hope for the honour of the house a good brew . Now comrade sit down : it will do you good after your long stroll . You should eat your own trout if you would wait ? ”
60460	60475	60188	60188	Egremont	290	“ By no means . You will miss your friend , I should think ? ”
60476	60580	60412	60412	Gerard	424	“ We shall see a good deal of him , I doubt not , what with the garden and neighbourhood and so on ; besides , in a manner , he is master of his own time . His work is not like ours ; and though the pull on the brain is sometimes great , I have often wished I had a talent that way . It ’s a drear life to do the same thing every day at the same hour . But I never could express my ideas except with my tongue ; and there I feel tolerably at home . ”
60581	60595	60597	60597	Egremont	290	“ It will be a pity to see this room without these books , ”
60605	60610	60612	60612	Gerard	424	“ So it will , ”
60614	60640	60612	60612	Gerard	424	“ I have got very few of my own . But my daughter will be able to fill the shelves in time , I warrant . ”
60641	60653	60412	60412	Gerard	424	“ Your daughter — she is coming to live with you ? ”
60654	60685	60412	60412	Gerard	424	“ Yes ; that is the reason why Stephen quits us . He only remained here until Sybil could keep my house , and that happy day is at hand . ”
60686	60699	60701	60701	Egremont	290	“ That is a great compensation for the loss of your friend , ”
60703	60711	60713	60713	Gerard	430	“ And yet she talks of flitting , ”
60721	60771	60772	60772	he	2580	“ She hankers after the cloister . She has passed a still , sweet life in the convent here ; the Superior is the sister of my employer and a very saint on earth ; and Sybil knows nothing of the real world except its sufferings . No matter , ”
60777	60823	60824	60824	he	2580	“ I would not have her take the veil rashly , but if I lose her it may be for the best . For the married life of a woman of our class in the present condition of our country is a lease of woe , ”
60830	60861	60827	60827	his	2580	“ slaves , and the slaves of slaves ? Even woman ’s spirit can not stand against it ; and it can bear against more than we can , master . ”
60862	60875	60877	60877	Egremont	290	“ Your daughter is not made for the common cares of life , ”
60879	60887	60889	60889	Gerard	430	“ We ’ll not talk of them , ”
60891	60920	60889	60889	Gerard	430	“ Sybil has an English heart , and that ’s not easily broken . And you , comrade , you are a traveller in these parts , eh ? ”
60921	60941	60827	60827	his	2580	“ A kind of traveller ; something in the way of your friend Morley — connected with the press . ”
60942	60965	60827	60827	his	2580	“ Indeed ! a reporter , eh ? I thought you had something about you a little more knowing than we provincials . ”
60966	61104	60889	60889	Gerard	430	“ Yes ; a reporter ; they want information in London as to the real state of the country , and this time of the year , Parliament not sitting — Ah ; I understand , a flying commission and a summer tour . Well , I often wish I were a penman ; but I never could do it . I ’ll read any day as long as you like , but that writing , I could never manage . My friend Morley is a powerful hand at it . His journal circulates a good deal about here ; and if as I often tell him he would only sink his high - flying philosophy and stick to old English politics , he might make a property of it . You ’ll like to know him ? ”
61105	61108	60827	60827	his	2580	“ Much . ”
61109	61124	60827	60827	his	2580	“ And what first took you to the press , if I may ask ! ”
61125	61134	60889	60889	Gerard	430	“ Why — my father was a gentleman — “
61143	61151	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ and I was a younger son . ”
61152	61155	61157	61157	Gerard	430	“ Ah ! ”
61159	61169	61157	61157	Gerard	430	“ that is as bad as being a woman . ”
61170	61176	61178	61178	Egremont	290	“ I had no patrimony , ”
61180	61240	61178	61178	Egremont	290	“ and I was obliged to work ; I had no head I believe for the law ; the church was not exactly in my way ; and as for the army , how was I to advance without money or connexions ! I had had some education , and so I thought I would turn it to account . ”
61241	61329	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ Wisely done ! you are one of the working classes , and will enlist I hope in the great struggle against the drones . The natural friends of the people are younger sons , though they are generally enlisted against us . The more fools they ; to devote their energies to the maintenance of a system which is founded on selfishness and which leads to fraud ; and of which they are the first victims . But every man thinks he will be an exception . ”
61330	61334	61336	61336	Egremont	290	“ And yet , ”
61338	61358	61336	61336	Egremont	290	“ a great family rooted in the land , has been deemed to be an element of political strength . ”
61359	61366	61368	61368	Gerard	430	“ I ’ll tell you what , ”
61370	61414	61368	61368	Gerard	430	“ there is a great family in this country and rooted in it , of which we have heard much less than they deserved , but of which I suspect we shall hear very soon enough to make us all think a bit . ”
61415	61420	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ In this county ? ”
61421	61437	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ Ay ; in this county and every other one ; I mean the PEOPLE . ”
61438	61441	61443	61443	Egremont	290	“ Ah ! ”
61445	61455	61443	61443	Egremont	290	“ that family has existed for a long time . ”
61456	61476	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ But it has taken to increase rapidly of late , my friend — how may I call you ? ”
61477	61484	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ They call me , Franklin . ”
61485	61521	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ A good English name of a good English class that has disappeared . Well , Mr Franklin , be sure of this , that the Population Returns of this country are very instructive reading . ”
61522	61528	61137	61137	Egremont	290	“ I can conceive so . ”
61529	61541	61543	61543	Gerard	430	“ I became a man when the bad times were beginning , ”
61545	61903	61543	61543	Gerard	430	“ I have passed through many doleful years . I was a Franklin ’s son myself , and we had lived on this island at least no worse for a longer time than I care to recollect as little as what I am now . But that ’s nothing ; I am not thinking of myself . I am prosperous in a fashion ; it is the serfs I live among of whom I am thinking . Well , I have heard , in the course of years , of some specifics for this constant degradation of the people ; some thing or some person that was to put all right ; and for my part , I was not unready to support any proposal or follow any leader . There was reform , and there was paper money , and no machinery , and a thousand other remedies ; and there were demagogues of all kinds , some as had as myself , and some with blood in their veins almost as costly as flows in those of our great neighbour here . Earl de Mowbray , and I have always heard that was very choice : but I will frankly own to you , I never had much faith in any of these proposals or proposers ; but they were a change , and that is something . But I have been persuaded of late that there is something going on in this country of more efficacy ; a remedial power , as I believe , and irresistible ; but whether remedial or not , at any rate a power that will mar all or cure all . You apprehend me ? I speak of the annual arrival of more than three hundred thousand strangers in this island . How will you feed them ? How will you clothe them ? How will you house them ? They have given up butcher ’s meat ; must they give up bread ? And as for raiment and shelter , the rags of the kingdom are exhausted and your sinks and cellars already swarm like rabbit warrens . “
61910	61915	61543	61543	Gerard	430	” said Egremont musing . “
61918	61922	61137	61137	Egremont	290	” said Gerard ; “
62021	63129	63141	63141	You	2594	” The last rays of the sun , contending with clouds of smoke that drifted across the country , partially illumined a peculiar landscape . Far as the eye could reach , and the region was level , except where a range of limestone hills formed its distant limit , a wilderness of cottages or tenements that were hardly entitled to a higher name , were scattered for many miles over the land ; some detached , some connected in little rows , some clustering in groups , yet rarely forming continuous streets , but interspersed with blazing furnaces , heaps of burning coal , and piles of smouldering ironstone ; while forges and engine chimneys roared and puffed in all directions , and indicated the frequent presence of the mouth of the mine and the bank of the coal - pit . Notwithstanding the whole country might be compared to a vast rabbit warren , it was nevertheless intersected with canals crossing each other at various levels , and though the subterranean operations were prosecuted with so much avidity that it was not uncommon to observe whole rows of houses awry , from the shifting and hollow nature of the land , still , intermingled with heaps of mineral refuse or of metallic dross , patches of the surface might here and there be recognised , covered , as if in mockery , with grass and corn , looking very much like those gentlemen ’s sons that we used to read of in our youth , stolen by the chimneysweeps and giving some intimations of their breeding beneath their grimy livery . But a tree or a shrub — such an existence was unknown in this dingy rather than dreary region . It was the twilight hour ; the hour at which in southern climes the peasant kneels before the sunset image of the blessed Hebrew maiden ; when caravans halt in their long course over vast deserts , and the turbaned traveller bending in the sand , pays his homage to the sacred stone and the sacred city ; the hour , not less holy , that announces the cessation of English toil , and sends forth the miner and the collier to breathe the air of earth , and gaze on the light of heaven . They come forth : the mine delivers its gang and the pit its bondsmen ; the forge is silent and the engine is still . The plain is covered with the swarming multitude : bands of stalwart men , broad - chested and muscular , wet with toil , and black as the children of the tropics ; troops of youth — alas ! of both sexes,—though neither their raiment nor their language indicates the difference ; all are clad in male attire ; and oaths that men might shudder at , issue from lips born to breathe words of sweetness . Yet these are to be — some are — the mothers of England ! But can we wonder at the hideous coarseness of their language when we remember the savage rudeness of their lives ? Naked to the waist , an iron chain fastened to a belt of leather runs between their legs clad in canvas trousers , while on hands and feet an English girl , for twelve , sometimes for sixteen hours a - day , hauls and hurries tubs of coals up subterranean roads , dark , precipitous , and plashy : circumstances that seem to have escaped the notice of the Society for the Abolition of Negro Slavery . Those worthy gentlemen too appear to have been singularly unconscious of the sufferings of the little Trappers , which was remarkable , as many of them were in their own employ . See too these emerge from the bowels of the earth ! Infants of four and five years of age , many of them girls , pretty and still soft and timid ; entrusted with the fulfilment of most responsible duties , and the nature of which entails on them the necessity of being the earliest to enter the mine and the latest to leave it . Their labour indeed is not severe , for that would be impossible , but it is passed in darkness and in solitude . They endure that punishment which philosophical philanthropy has invented for the direst criminals , and which those criminals deem more terrible than the death for which it is substituted . Hour after hour elapses , and all that reminds the infant Trappers of the world they have quitted and that which they have joined , is the passage of the coal - waggons for which they open the air - doors of the galleries , and on keeping which doors constantly closed , except at this moment of passage , the safety of the mine and the lives of the persons employed in it entirely depend . Sir Joshua , a man of genius and a courtly artist , struck by the seraphic countenance of Lady Alice Gordon , when a child of very tender years , painted the celestial visage in various attitudes on the same canvass , and styled the group of heavenly faces — guardian angels ! We would say to some great master of the pencil , Mr Landseer or Mr Etty , go thou to the little trappers and do likewise ! A small party of miners approached a house of more pretension than the generality of the dwellings , and announcing its character by a very flagrant sign of the Rising Sun . They entered it as men accustomed , and were greeted with smiles and many civil words from the lady at the bar , who inquired very cheerfully what the gentlemen would have . They soon found themselves seated in the tap , and , though it was not entirely unoccupied , in their accustomed places , for there seemed a general understanding that they enjoyed a prescriptive right . With hunches of white bread in their black hands , and grinning with their sable countenances and ivory teeth , they really looked like a gang of negroes at a revel . The cups of ale circulated , the pipes were lighted , the preliminary puffs achieved . There was at length silence , when he who seemed their leader and who filled a sort of president ’s seat , took his pipe from his mouth , and then uttering the first complete sentence that had yet been expressed aloud , thus delivered himself . “

I ’ve seen the people at play for weeks together , and so clammed that I never tasted nothing but a potatoe and a little salt for more than a fortnight .

And I ’ll tell you what , sir , that I never knew the people play yet , but if a word had passed atween them and the main - masters aforehand , it might not have been settled ; but you ca n’t get at them any way .

65451	66391	65443	65443	he	2688	” Two days after the visit of Egremont to the cottage of Walter Gerard , the visit of the Marney family to Mowbray terminated , and they returned to the Abbey . There is something mournful in the breaking up of an agreeable party , and few are the roofs in which one has sojourned , which are quitted without some feeling of depression . The sudden cessation of all those sources of excitement which pervade a gay and well arranged mansion in the country , unstrings the nervous system . For a week or so , we have done nothing which was not agreeable , and heard nothing which was not pleasant . Our self - love has been respected ; there has been a total cessation of petty cares ; all the enjoyment of an establisnment without any of its solicitude . We have beheld civilization only in its favoured aspect , and tasted only the sunny side of the fruit . Sometimes there are associations with our visit of a still sweeter and softer character , but on these we need not dwell : glances that can not be forgotten , and tones that linger in the ear ; sentiment that subdues the soul , and flirtation that agitates the fancy . No matter , whatever may be the cause , one too often drives away from a country - house , rather hipped . The specific would be immediately to drive to another , and it is a favourite remedy . But sometimes it is not in our power ; sometimes for instance we must return to our household gods in the shape of a nursery ; and though this was not the form assumed by the penates of Lord Marney , his presence , the presence of an individual so important and so indefatigable , was still required . His Lordship had passed his time at Mowbray to his satisfaction . He had had his own way in everything . His selfishness had not received a single shock . He had lain down the law and it had not been questioned . He had dogmatised and impugned , and his assertions had passed current , and his doctrines been accepted as orthodox . Lord Mowbray suited him ; he liked the consideration of so great a personage . Lord Marney also really liked pomp ; a curious table and a luxurious life ; but he liked them under any roof rather than his own . Not that he was what is commonly called a Screw ; that is to say he was not a mere screw ; but he was acute and malicious ; saw everybody ’s worth and position at a glance ; could not bear to expend his choice wines and costly viands on hangers - on and toad - eaters , though at the same time no man encouraged and required hangers - on and toad - eaters more . Lord Marney had all the petty social vices , and none of those petty social weaknesses which soften their harshness or their hideousness . To receive a prince of the blood or a great peer he would spare nothing . Had he to fulfil any of the public duties of his station , his performance would baffle criticism . But he enjoyed making the Vicar of Marney or Captain Grouse drink some claret that was on the wane , or praise a bottle of Burgundy that he knew was pricked . Little things affect little minds . Lord Marney rose in no very good humour ; he was kept at the station , which aggravated his spleen . During his journey on the railroad he spoke little , and though he more than once laboured to get up a controversy he was unable , for Lady Marney , who rather dreaded her dull home , and was not yet in a tone of mind that could hail the presence of the little Poinsett as full compensation for the brilliant circle of Mowbray , replied in amiable monosyllables , and Egremont himself in austere ones , for he was musing over Sybil Gerard and a thousand things as wild and sweet . Everything went wrong this day . Even Captain Grouse was not at the Abbey to welcome them back . He was playing in a cricket match , Marney against Marham . Nothing else would have induced him to be absent . So it happened that the three fellow - travellers had to dine together , utterly weary of themselves and of each other . Captain Grouse was never more wanted ; he would have amused Lord Marney , relieved his wife and brother , reported all that had been said and done in their neighbourhood during their absence , introduced a new tone , and effected a happy diversion . Leaving Mowbray , detained at the station , Grouse away , some disagreeable letters , or letters which an ill - humoured man chooses to esteem disagreeable , seemed to announce a climax . Lord Marney ordered the dinner to be served in the small dining - room , which was contiguous to a saloon in which Lady Marney , when they were alone , generally passed the evening . The dinner was silent and sombre ; happily it was also short . Lord Marney tasted several dishes , ate of none ; found fault with his own claret , though the butler had given him a choice bottle ; praised Lord Mowbray ’s , wondered where he got it , “
66400	66609	65443	65443	he	2688	” then for the twentieth time wondered what could have induced Grouse to fix the cricket match the day he returned home , though he chose to forget that he had never communicated to Grouse even the probable day on which he might be expected . As for Egremont it must be admitted that he was scarcely in a more contented mood than his brother , though he had not such insufficient cause for his dark humours . In quitting Mowbray , he had quitted something else than merely an agreeable circle : enough had happened in that visit to stir up the deep recesses of his heart , and to prompt him to investigate in an unusual spirit the cause and attributes of his position . He had found a letter on his return to the Abbey , not calculated to dispel these somewhat morbid feelings ; a letter from his agent , urging the settlement of his election accounts , the primary cause of his visit to his brother . Lady Marney left the dining - room ; the brothers were alone . Lord Marney filled a bumper , which he drank off rapidly , pushed the bottle to his brother , and then said again , “
66622	66623	66617	66617	Grouse	385	” “
66643	66659	66640	66641	Captain Grouse	385	” said his brother . Lord Marney looked at Egremont pugnaciously , and then observed , “

A sound was heard at the other door ; there was nothing in the world that Lord Marney dreaded so much as that his servants should witness a domestic scene . He sprang forward to the door to prevent any one entering ; partially opening it , he said Lady Marney was unwell and desired her maid ; returning , he found Arabella insensible on the ground , and Egremont vanished ! It was a wet morning ; there had been a heavy rain since dawn , which impelled by a gusty south - wester came driving on a crowd of women and girls who were assembled before the door of a still unclosed shop . Some protected themselves with umbrellas ; some sought shelter beneath a row of old elms that grew alongside the canal that fronted the house . Notwithstanding the weather , the clack of tongues was incessant . “

71137	71344	71345	71345	I	0	” The doors of Mr Diggs ’ tommy - shop opened . The rush was like the advance into the pit of a theatre when the drama existed ; pushing , squeezing , fighting , tearing , shrieking . On a high seat , guarded by rails from all contact , sate Mr Diggs senior , with a bland smile on his sanctified countenance , a pen behind his ear , and recommending his constrained customers in honeyed tones to be patient and orderly . Behind the substantial counter which was an impregnable fortification , was his popular son , Master Joseph ; a short , ill - favoured cur , with a spirit of vulgar oppression and malicious mischief stamped on his visage . His black , greasy lank hair , his pug nose , his coarse red face , and his projecting tusks , contrasted with the mild and lengthened countenance of his father , who looked very much like a wolf in sheep ’s clothing . For the first five minutes Master Joseph Diggs did nothing but blaspheme and swear at his customers , occasionally leaning over the counter and cuffing the women in the van or lugging some girl by the hair . “
71352	71358	71349	71350	Master Joseph	516	” said a woman eagerly . “

71433	71445	71399	71400	my husband	2325	” and he began taking the orders of the other woman . “
71454	71460	71448	71448	Lord	2882	” said the disappointed woman ; “

Speak out , you ideot ! do you think I can hear your muttering in this Babel ? Cuss them ; I ’ll keep them quiet , ”
71911	71918	71920	71921	a woman	2225	“ Oh ! you little monster ! ”
71923	71933	71920	71921	a woman	2225	“ you have put out my babby ’s eye . ”
71943	71949	71951	71952	Master Joseph	516	“ Whose baby ’s hurt ? ”

71969	71973	71920	71921	a woman	2225	“ Mary Church . ”

71989	72041	71985	71987	the malicious imp	2899	“ then I ’ll put Mary Church down for half a pound of best arrow - root ; that ’s the finest thing in the world for babbies , and will cure you of bringing your cussed monkeys here , as if you all thought our shop was a hinfant school . “
72257	72373	72251	72251	I	0	” said the infuriated little tyrant . But the waving of the multitude , impatient , and annoyed by the weather , was not to be stilled ; the movement could not be regulated ; the shop was in commotion ; and Master Joseph Diggs , losing all patience , jumped on the counter , and amid the shrieks of the women , sprang into the crowd . Two women fainted ; others cried for their bonnets ; others bemoaned their aprons ; nothing however deterred Diggs , who kicked and cuffed and cursed in every quarter , and gave none . At last there was a general scream of horror , and a cry of “
72378	72527	72529	72529	he	6101	” The senior Diggs , who , from his eminence , had hitherto viewed the scene with unruffled complacency ; who , in fact , derived from these not unusual exhibitions the same agreeable excitement which a Roman emperor might have received from the combats of the circus ; began to think that affairs were growing serious , and rose to counsel order and enforce amiable dispositions . Even Master Joseph was quelled by that mild voice which would have become Augustus . It appeared to be quite true that a boy was dead . It was the little boy who , sent to get a loaf for his mother , had complained before the shop was opened of his fainting energies . He had fallen in the fray , and it was thought , to use the phrase of the comely dame who tried to rescue him , “
72534	72560	72561	72561	I	0	” They carried him out of the shop ; the perspiration poured off him ; he had no pulse . He had no friends there . “
72568	72574	72561	72561	I	0	” said the comely dame , “
72581	72674	72578	72578	my	0	” At this moment , Stephen Morley , for the reader has doubtless discovered that the stranger who held colloquy with the colliers was the friend of Walter Gerard , arrived at the tommy - shop , which was about half - way between the house where he had passed the night and Wodgate . He stopped , inquired , and being a man of science and some skill , decided , after examining the poor boy , that life was not extinct . Taking the elder Diggs aside , he said , “
72739	72740	72728	72728	I	0	” “
72749	72756	72728	72728	I	0	” inquired the alarmed Mr Diggs ; “
72765	72766	72728	72728	I	0	” “
72773	72777	72728	72728	I	0	” said Morley . “
72860	74601	74603	74603	you	2930	” And so saying , Morley and the elder Diggs entered the house . Wodgate , or Wogate , as it was called on the map , was a district that in old days had been consecrated to Woden , and which appeared destined through successive ages to retain its heathen character . At the beginning of the revolutionary war , Wodgate was a sort of squatting district of the great mining region to which it was contiguous , a place where adventurers in the industry which was rapidly developing , settled themselves ; for though the great veins of coal and ironstone cropped up , as they phrase it , before they reached this bare and barren land , and it was thus deficient in those mineral and metallic treasures which had enriched its neighbourhood , Wodgate had advantages of its own , and of a kind which touch the fancy of the lawless . It was land without an owner ; no one claimed any manorial right over it ; they could build cottages without paying rent . It was a district recognized by no parish ; so there were no tithes , and no meddlesome supervision . It abounded in fuel which cost nothing , for though the veins were not worth working as a source of mining profit , the soil of Wodgate was similar in its superficial character to that of the country around . So a population gathered , and rapidly increased , in the ugliest spot in England , to which neither Nature nor art had contributed a single charm ; where a tree could not be seen , a flower was unknown , where there was neither belfry nor steeple , nor a single sight or sound that could soften the heart or humanise the mind . Whatever may have been the cause , whether , as not unlikely , the original squatters brought with them some traditionary skill , or whether their isolated and unchequered existence concentrated their energies on their craft , the fact is certain , that the inhabitants of Wodgate early acquired a celebrity as skilful workmen . This reputation so much increased , and in time spread so far , that for more than a quarter of a century , both in their skill and the economy of their labour , they have been unmatched throughout the country . As manufacturers of ironmongery , they carry the palm from the whole district ; as founders of brass and workers of steel , they fear none ; while as nailers and locksmiths , their fame has spread even to the European markets , whither their most skilful workmen have frequently been invited . Invited in vain ! No wages can tempt the Wodgate man from his native home , that squatters ’ seat which soon assumed the form of a large village , and then in turn soon expanded into a town , and at the present moment numbers its population by swarming thousands , lodged in the most miserable tenements in the most hideous burgh in the ugliest country in the world . But it has its enduring spell . Notwithstanding the spread of its civic prosperity , it has lost none of the characteristics of its original society ; on the contrary it has zealously preserved them . There are no landlords , head - lessees , main - masters , or butties in Wodgate . No church there has yet raised its spire ; and as if the jealous spirit of Woden still haunted his ancient temple , even the conventicle scarcely dares show its humble front in some obscure corner . There is no municipality , no magistrate , no local acts , no vestries , no schools of any kind . The streets are never cleaned ; every man lights his own house ; nor does any one know anything except his business . More than this , at Wodgate a factory or large establishment of any kind is unknown . Here Labour reigns supreme . Its division indeed is favoured by their manners , but the interference or influence of mere capital is instantly resisted . The business of Wodgate is carried on by master workmen in their own houses , each of whom possesses an unlimited number of what they call apprentices , by whom their affairs are principally conducted , and whom they treat as the Mamlouks treated the Egyptians . These master workmen indeed form a powerful aristocracy , nor is it possible to conceive one apparently more oppressive . They are ruthless tyrants ; they habitually inflict upon their subjects punishments more grievous than the slave population of our colonies were ever visited with ; not content with beating them with sticks or flogging them with knotted ropes , they are in the habit of felling them with hammers , or cutting their heads open with a file or lock . The most usual punishment however , or rather stimulus to increase exertion , is to pull an apprentice ’s ears till they run with blood . These youths too are worked for sixteen and even twenty hours a day ; they are often sold by one master to another ; they are fed on carrion , and they sleep in lofts or cellars : yet whether it be that they are hardened by brutality , and really unconscious of their degradation and unusual sufferings , or whether they are supported by the belief that their day to be masters and oppressors will surely arrive , the aristocracy of Wodgate is by no means so unpopular as the aristocracy of most other places . In the first place it is a real aristocracy ; it is privileged , but it does something for its privileges . It is distinguished from the main body not merely by name . It is the most knowing class at Wodgate ; it possesses indeed in its way complete knowledge ; and it imparts in its manner a certain quantity of it to those whom it guides . Thus it is an aristocracy that leads , and therefore a fact . Moreover the social system of Wodgate is not an unvarying course of infinite toil . Their plan is to work hard , but not always . They seldom exceed four days of labour in the week . On Sunday the masters begin to drink ; for the apprentices there is dog - fighting without any stint . On Monday and Tuesday the whole population of Wodgate is drunk ; of all stations , ages , and sexes ; even babes , who should be at the breast ; for they are drammed with Godfrey ’s cordial . Here is relaxation , excitement ; if less vice otherwise than might be at first anticipated , we must remember that excesses are checked by poverty of blood and constant exhaustion . Scanty food and hard labour are in their way , if not exactly moralists , a tolerably good police . There are no others at Wodgate to preach or to control . It is not that the people are immoral , for immorality implies some forethought ; or ignorant , for ignorance is relative ; but they are animals ; unconscious ; their minds a blank ; and their worst actions only the impulse of a gross or savage instinct . There are many in this town who are ignorant of their very names ; very few who can spell them . It is rare that you meet with a young person who knows his own age ; rarer to find the boy who has seen a book , or the girl who has seen a flower . Ask them the name of their sovereign , and they will give you an unmeaning stare ; ask them the name of their religion , and they will laugh : who rules them on earth , or who can save them in heaven , are alike mysteries to them . Such was the population with whom Morley was about to mingle . Wodgate had the appearance of a vast squalid suburb . As you advanced , leaving behind you long lines of little dingy tenements , with infants lying about the road , you expected every moment to emerge into some streets and encounter buildings bearing some correspondence in their size and comfort to the considerable population swarming and busied around you . Nothing of the kind . There were no public buildings of any sort ; no churches , chapels , town - hall , institute , theatre ; and the principal streets in the heart of the town in which were situate the coarse and grimy shops , though formed by houses of a greater elevation than the preceding , were equally narrow and if possible more dirty . At every fourth or fifth house , alleys seldom above a yard wide and streaming with filth , opened out of the street . These were crowded with dwellings of various size , while from the principal court often branched out a number of smaller alleys or rather narrow passages , than which nothing can be conceived more close and squalid and obscure . Here during the days of business , the sound of the hammer and the file never ceased , amid gutters of abomination and piles of foulness and stagnant pools of filth ; reservoirs of leprosy and plague , whose exhalations were sufficient to taint the atmosphere of the whole kingdom and fill the country with fever and pestilence . A lank and haggard youth , ricketty and smoke - dried , and black with his craft , was sitting on the threshold of a miserable hovel and working at the file . Behind him stood a stunted and meagre girl , with a back like a grasshopper ; a deformity occasioned by the displacement of the bladebone , and prevalent among the girls of Wodgate from the cramping posture of their usual toil . Her long melancholy visage and vacant stare at Morley as he passed , attracted his notice , and it occurring to him that the opportunity was convenient to enquire something of the individual of whom he was in search , he stopped and addressed the workman : “
74617	74618	74619	74619	Hatton	425	” “
74621	74637	74619	74619	Hatton	425	” said the youth looking up with a grin , yet still continuing his labour , “
74644	74645	74641	74641	I	0	” “
74660	74661	74652	74652	you	2930	” “
74668	74698	74699	74699	he	425	” said the youth still grinning , and letting the file drop from his distorted and knotty hand , he pointed to a deep scar that crossed his forehead , “
74703	74704	74699	74699	he	425	” “
74708	74709	74699	74699	he	425	” “
74996	75019	74993	74993	I	0	” And the lank , haggard youth laughed merrily , as if he had been recounting a series of the happiest adventures . “
75030	75044	74993	74993	I	0	” said Morley , who had listened with astonishment to this complacent statement . “
75053	75054	75047	75048	no magistrate	8103	” “
75058	75069	75047	75048	no magistrate	8103	” said the filer with an air of obvious pride , “

75146	75150	75142	75142	I	0	” said Morley , “

75176	75181	75169	75174	a wery hearty sort of man	2951	” said the filer , “
75217	75223	75160	75161	this Hatton	425	“ What ! this monster ! ”
75224	75414	75165	75165	You	2950	“ Lord bless you , it ’s his way , that ’s all , we be a queer set here ; but he has his pints . Give him a lock to make , and you wo n’t have your box picked ; he ’s wery lib’ral too in the wittals . Never had horse - flesh the whole time I was with him ; they has nothin’ else at Tugsford ’s ; never had no sick cow except when meat was very dear . He always put his face agin still - born calves ; he used to say he liked his boys to have meat what was born alive and killed alive . By which token there never was any sheep what had bust in the head sold in our court . And then sometimes he would give us a treat of fish , when it had been four or five days in town and not sold . No , give the devil his due , say I. There never was no want for anything at meals with the Bishop , except time to eat them in . ”
75415	75425	75160	75161	this Hatton	425	“ And why do you call him the Bishop ? ”
75426	75618	75160	75161	this Hatton	425	“ That ’s his name and authority ; for he ’s the governor here over all of us . And it has always been so that Wodgate has been governed by a bishop ; because as we have no church , we will have as good . And by this token that this day sen’night , the day my time was up , he married me to this here young lady . She is of the Baptist school religion , and wanted us to be tied by her clergyman , but all the lads that served their time with me were married by the Bishop , and many a more , and I saw no call to do no otherwise . So he sprinkled some salt over a gridiron , read ‘ Our Father ’ backwards , and wrote our name in a book : and we were spliced ; but I did n’t do it rashly , did I , Suky , by the token that we had kept company for two years , and there is n’t a gal in all Wodgate what handles a file , like Sue . ”
75619	75630	75165	75165	You	2950	“ And what is your name , my good fellow ? ”
75631	75670	75160	75161	this Hatton	425	“ They call me Tummas , but I ayn’t got no second name ; but now I am married I mean to take my wife ’s , for she has been baptised , and so has got two . ”
75671	75675	75677	75688	the girl with the vacant face and the back like a grasshopper	2953	“ Yes sir , ”
75690	75758	75677	75688	the girl with the vacant face and the back like a grasshopper	2953	“ I be a reg’lar born Christian and my mother afore me , and that ’s what few gals in the Yard can say . Thomas will take to it himself when work is slack ; and he believes now in our Lord and Saviour Pontius Pilate who was crucified to save our sins ; and in Moses , Goliath , and the rest of the Apostles . ”
75759	75764	75766	75766	Morley	423	“ Ah ! me , ”
75768	75785	75766	75766	Morley	423	“ and could not they spare one Missionary from Tahiti for their fellow countrymen at Wodgate ! ”
76251	76259	76261	76261	Sybil	430	“ So you see , my father , ”
76277	76310	76261	76261	Sybil	430	“ even then all was not lost . The stout earl retired beyond the Trent , and years and reigns elapsed before this part of the island accepted their laws and customs . ”
76311	76315	76317	76318	her father	7055	“ I see , ”
76320	76331	76317	76318	her father	7055	“ and yet I can not help wishing that Harold — ”
76355	76387	76345	76345	Gerard	430	“ We were not talking of thee , good sir , but of thy great namesake ; but ne’er mind , a live dog they say is worth a dead king . ”
76388	76400	76402	76402	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! why have we not such a man now , ”
76404	76425	76402	76402	Sybil	430	“ to protect the people ! Were I a prince I know no career that I should deem so great . ”
76426	76432	76434	76434	Gerard	430	“ But Stephen says no , ”
76436	76472	76434	76434	Gerard	430	“ he says that these great men have never made use of us but as tools ; and that the people never can have their rights until they produce competent champions from their own order . ”
76473	76485	76487	76487	Sybil	430	“ But then Stephen does not want to recall the past , ”
76494	76502	76487	76487	Sybil	430	“ he wishes to create the future . ”
76503	76510	76512	76512	Gerard	430	“ The past is a dream , ”
76514	76521	76523	76523	Sybil	430	“ And what is the future ? ”
76525	76557	76523	76523	Sybil	430	“ Alack ! I know not ; but I often wish the battle of Hastings were to be fought over again and I was going to have a hand in it . ”
76558	76564	76566	76566	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! my father , ”
76572	76596	76566	76566	Sybil	430	“ there is ever your fatal specific of physical force . Even Stephen is against physical force , with all his odd fancies . ”
76597	76602	76604	76604	Gerard	430	“ All very true , ”
76610	76671	76604	76604	Gerard	430	“ but all the same when I was coming home a few days ago , and stopped awhile on the bridge and chanced to see myself in the stream , I could not help fancying that my Maker had fashioned these limbs rather to hold a lance or draw a bow , than to supervise a shuttle or a spindle . ”
76672	76686	76688	76688	Sybil	430	“ Yet with the shuttle and the spindle we may redeem our race , ”
76692	76729	76688	76688	Sybil	430	“ if we could only form the minds that move those peaceful weapons . Oh ! my father , I will believe that moral power is irresistible , or where are we to look for hope ? ”
76743	76746	76748	76748	he	2970	“ Ah ! ”
76750	76818	76748	76748	he	2970	“ what can we do ; they have got the land , and the land governs the people . The Norman knew that , Sybil , as you just read . If indeed we had our rights , one might do something ; but I do n’t know ; I dare say if I had our land again , I should be as bad as the rest . ”
76819	76827	76829	76829	Sybil	430	“ Oh ! no , my father , ”
76833	76858	76829	76829	Sybil	430	“ never , never ! Your thoughts would be as princely as your lot . What a leader of the people you would make ! ”
76866	76869	76871	76871	Gerard	430	“ Hush ! ”
76873	76878	76880	76880	he	292	“ some one knocks : ”
76894	76898	76829	76829	Sybil	430	“ You ’ll excuse me”—“I
76901	76906	76909	76910	her father	7055	kindly”—“So we are neighbours . ”
76920	76948	76950	76950	he	7055	“ Here is my friend Mr Franklin that I was speaking of , Sybil , who is going to be our neighbour ; down Harold , down ! ”
77102	77107	77109	77109	Egremont	290	“ I dare say , ”
77114	77128	77109	77109	Egremont	290	“ you have seen our poor friend the weaver since we met there . ”
77129	77136	77138	77138	Sybil	430	“ The day I quitted Mowbray , ”
77140	77147	77138	77138	Sybil	430	“ They are not without friends . ”
77148	77158	77109	77109	Egremont	290	“ Ah ! you have met my daughter before . ”
77159	77166	77168	77168	Egremont	290	“ On a mission of grace , ”
77170	77185	77187	77187	Gerard	430	“ And I suppose you found the town not very pleasant , Mr Franklin , ”
77189	77275	77187	77187	Gerard	430	“ No ; I could not stand it , the nights were so close . Besides I have a great accumulation of notes , and I fancied I could reduce them into a report more efficiently in comparative seclusion . So I have got a room near here , with a little garden , not so pretty as yours ; but still a garden is something ; and if I want any additional information , why , after all , Mowbray is only a walk . ”
77276	77322	77109	77109	Egremont	290	“ You say well and have done wisely . Besides you have such late hours in London , and hard work . Some country air will do you all the good in the world . That gallery must be tiresome . Do you use shorthand ? ”
77323	77332	77334	77334	Egremont	290	“ A sort of shorthand of my own , ”
77336	77346	77334	77334	Egremont	290	“ I trust a good deal to my memory . ”
77347	77379	77109	77109	Egremont	290	“ Ah ! you are young . My daughter also has a wonderful memory . For my own part , there are many things which I am not sorry to forget . ”
77380	77392	77394	77394	Egremont	290	“ You see I took you at your word , neighbour , ”
77396	77414	77394	77394	Egremont	290	“ When one has been at work the whole day one feels a little lonely towards night . ”
77415	77471	77473	77473	Gerard	430	“ Very true ; and I dare say you find desk work sometimes very dull ; I never could make anything of it myself . I can manage a book well enough , if it be well written , and on points I care for ; but I would sooner listen than read any time , ”
77475	77522	77473	77473	Gerard	430	“ Indeed I should be right glad to see the minstrel and the storyteller going their rounds again . It would be easy after a day ’s work , when one has not , as I have now , a good child to read to me . ”
77523	77527	77529	77529	Egremont	290	“ This volume ? ”
77548	77557	77559	77559	Gerard	430	“ Ah ! it ’s a fine book , ”
77561	77568	77559	77559	Gerard	430	“ though on a sad subject . ”
77569	77581	77583	77583	Egremont	290	“ The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans , ”
77594	77601	77559	77559	Gerard	430	“ Ursula Trafford to Sybil Gerard . ”
77602	77607	77609	77609	Sybil	430	“ You know it ? ”
77611	77616	77609	77609	Sybil	430	“ Only by fame . ”
77617	77632	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ Perhaps the subject may not interest you so much as it does us , ”
77636	77645	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ It must interest all and all alike , ”
77650	77662	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ for we are divided between the conquerors and the conquered . ”
77663	77670	77672	77672	Egremont	290	“ But do not you think , ”
77674	77685	77672	77672	Egremont	290	“ that such a distinction has long ceased to exist ? ”
77686	77691	77693	77693	Gerard	430	“ In what degree ? ”
77695	77812	77693	77693	Gerard	430	“ Many circumstances of oppression have doubtless gradually disappeared : but that has arisen from the change of manners , not from any political recognition of their injustice . The same course of time which has removed many enormities , more shocking however to our modern feelings than to those who devised and endured them , has simultaneously removed many alleviating circumstances . If the mere baron ’s grasp be not so ruthless , the champion we found in the church is no longer so ready . The spirit of Conquest has adapted itself to the changing circumstances of ages , and however its results vary in form , in degree they are much the same . ”
77813	77821	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ But how do they show themselves ? ”
77822	77857	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ In many circumstances , which concern many classes ; but I speak of those which touch my own order ; and therefore I say at once — in the degradation of the people . ”
77858	77866	77693	77693	Gerard	430	“ But are the people so degraded ? ”
77867	78009	77634	77634	Sybil	430	“ There is more serfdom in England now than at any time since the Conquest . I speak of what passes under my daily eyes when I say that those who labour can as little choose or change their masters now , as when they were born thralls . There are great bodies of the working classes of this country nearer the condition of brutes , than they have been at any time since the Conquest . Indeed I see nothing to distinguish them from brutes , except that their morals are inferior . Incest and infanticide are as common among them as among the lower animals . The domestic principle waxes weaker and weaker every year in England : nor can we wonder at it , when there is no comfort to cheer and no sentiment to hallow the Home . ”
78010	78020	78022	78022	Egremont	290	“ I was reading a work the other day , ”
78024	78052	78022	78022	Egremont	290	“ that statistically proved that the general condition of the people was much better at this moment than it had been at any known period of history . ”
78053	78065	78067	78067	Gerard	430	“ Ah ! yes , I know that style of speculation , ”
78069	78290	78067	78067	Gerard	430	“ your gentleman who reminds you that a working man now has a pair of cotton stockings , and that Harry the Eighth himself was not as well off . At any rate , the condition of classes must be judged of by the age , and by their relation with each other . One need not dwell on that . I deny the premises . I deny that the condition of the main body is better now than at any other period of our history ; that it is as good as it has been at several . I say , for instance , the people were better clothed , better lodged , and better fed just before the war of the Roses than they are at this moment . We know how an English peasant lived in those times : he eat flesh every day , he never drank water , was well housed , and clothed in stout woollens . Nor are the Chronicles necessary to tell us this . The acts of Parliament from the Plantagenets to the Tudors teach us alike the price of provisions and the rate of wages ; and we see in a moment that the wages of those days brought as much sustenance and comfort as a reasonable man could desire . ”
78291	78302	78304	78304	Egremont	290	“ I know how deeply you feel upon this subject , ”
78309	78322	78323	78323	she	430	“ Indeed it is the only subject that ever engages my thought , ”
78326	78330	78323	78323	she	430	“ except one . ”
78331	78336	78067	78067	Gerard	430	“ And that one ? ”
78337	78351	78353	78353	Sybil	430	“ Is to see the people once more kneel before our blessed Lady , ”
78355	78364	78366	78366	Gerard	430	“ Look at the average term of life , ”
78382	78422	78067	78067	Gerard	430	“ The average term of life in this district among the working classes is seventeen . What think you of that ? Of the infants born in Mowbray , more than a moiety die before the age of five . ”
78423	78427	78429	78429	Egremont	290	“ And yet , ”
78431	78440	78429	78429	Egremont	290	“ in old days they had terrible pestilences . ”
78441	78448	78450	78450	Gerard	430	“ But they touched all alike , ”
78452	78533	78450	78450	Gerard	430	“ We have more pestilence now in England than we ever had , but it only reaches the poor . You never hear of it . Why Typhus alone takes every year from the dwellings of the artisan and peasant a population equal to that of the whole county of Westmoreland . This goes on every year , but the representatives of the conquerors are not touched : it is the descendants of the conquered alone who are the victims . ”
78534	78541	78543	78543	Sybil	430	“ It sometimes seems to me , ”
78546	78563	78543	78543	Sybil	430	“ that nothing short of the descent of angels can save the people of this kingdom . ”
78564	78574	78576	78576	Gerard	430	“ I sometimes think I hear a little bird , ”
78578	78612	78576	78576	Gerard	430	“ who sings that the long frost may yet break up . I have a friend , him of whom I was speaking to you the other day , who has his remedies . ”
78613	78623	78625	78625	Sybil	430	“ But Stephen Morley does not believe in angels , ”
78630	78640	78655	78655	Gerard	430	“ and I have no faith in his plan . ”
78641	78653	78655	78655	Gerard	430	“ He believes that God will help those who help themselves , ”
78657	78662	78664	78664	Sybil	430	“ And I believe , ”
78666	78677	78664	78664	Sybil	430	“ that those only can help themselves whom God helps . ”
78722	78725	78720	78720	he	290	“ Sybil . ”
78726	78729	78731	78734	the daughter of Gerard	7584	“ Yes , ”
78743	78749	78751	78751	Egremont	290	“ I beg your pardon , ”
78754	78780	78751	78751	Egremont	290	“ I was reading your name . I thought I was reading it to myself . Sybil Gerard ! What a beautiful name is Sybil ! ”
78781	78787	78789	78789	Gerard	430	“ My mother ’s name , ”
78791	78824	78825	78825	he	290	“ and my grandame ’s name , and a name I believe that has been about our hearth as long as our race ; and that ’s a very long time indeed , ”
78829	78847	78825	78825	he	290	“ for we were tall men in King John ’s reign , as I have heard say . ”
78848	78856	78751	78751	Egremont	290	“ Yours is indeed an old family . ”
78857	78907	78825	78825	he	290	“ Ay , we have some English blood in our veins , though peasants and the sons of peasants . But there was one of us who drew a bow at Azincourt ; and I have heard greater things , but I believe they are old wives ’ tales . ”
78908	78916	78918	78918	Sybil	430	“ At least we have nothing left , ”
78920	78939	78918	78918	Sybil	430	“ but our old faith ; and that we have clung to through good report and evil report . ”
78940	78944	78946	78946	Gerard	430	“ And now , ”
78948	78999	78946	78946	Gerard	430	“ I rise with the lark , good neighbour Franklin ; but before you go , Sybil will sing to us a requiem that I love : it stills the spirit before we sink into the slumber which may this night be death , and which one day must be . ”
79189	79196	79197	79197	he	2997	“ Ah ! this is delicious ! ”
79200	79456	79197	79197	he	2997	“ This is existence ! Thank God I am here ; that I have quitted for ever that formal and heartless Marney . Were it not for my mother , I would remain Mr Franklin for ever . Would I were indeed a journalist ; provided I always had a mission to the vale of Mowbray . Or anything , so that I were ever here . As companions , independent of everything else , they are superior to any that I have been used to . Why do these persons interest me ? They feel and they think : two habits that have quite gone out of fashion , if ever they existed , among my friends . And that polish of manners , that studied and factitious refinement , which is to compensate for the heartlessness or the stupidity we are doomed to — is my host of last night deficient in that refinement ? If he do want our conventional discipline , he has a native breeding which far excels it . I observe no word or action which is not prompted by that fine feeling which is the sure source of good taste . This Gerard appears to me a real genuine man ; full of knowledge worked out by his own head ; with large yet wholesome sympathies ; and a deuced deal better educated than Lord de Mowbray or my brother — and they do occasionally turn over a book , which is not the habit of our set . “
79626	79799	79610	79610	I	0	” He went forth from his little garden , and strolled along the road in the direction of the cottage of Gerard , which was about three quarters of a mile distant . You might see almost as far ; the sunshiny road a little winding and rising a very slight ascent . The cottage itself was hid by its trees . While Egremont was still musing of one who lived under that roof , he beheld in the distance Sybil . She was springing along with a quick and airy step . Her black dress displayed her undulating and elastic figure . Her little foot bounded from the earth with a merry air . A long rosary hung at her side ; and her head was partly covered with a hood which descended just over her shoulders . She seemed gay , for Harold kept running before her with a frolicsome air , and then returning to his mistress , danced about her , and almost overpowered her with his gambols . “
79807	79811	79800	79800	I	0	” said Egremont . “
79821	79831	79836	79836	you	0	” she exclaimed with a bright and happy face . “

79890	79962	79846	79846	I	0	” said Sybil . They walked on together ; Sybil glad as the hour ; noticing a thousand cheerful sights , speaking to her dog in her ringing voice , as he gambolled before them , or seized her garments in his mouth , and ever and anon bounded away and then returned , looking up in his mistress ’ face to inquire whether he had been wanted in his absence . “
79980	79984	79985	79985	he	1372	” said Egremont ; “

80104	80108	80062	80062	You	0	” said Egremont ; “

It was in a most dilapidated state ; the principal part occupied as a nail - workshop , where a great number of heavy iron machines were working in every room on each floor ; the building itself in so shattered a condition that every part of it creaked and vibrated with their motion . The flooring was so broken that in many places one could look down through the gaping and rotten planks , while the upper floors from time to time had been shored up with props . This was the Palace of the Bishop of Wodgate , and here with his arms bare and black , he worked at those locks , which defied any skeleton key that was not made by himself . He was a short , thickset man , powerfully made , with brawny arms disproportionately short even for his height , and with a countenance , as far as one could judge of a face so disfigured by his grimy toil , rather brutal than savage . His choice apprentices , full of admiration and terror , worked about him ; lank and haggard youths , who never for an instant dared to raise their dingy faces and lack - lustre eyes from their ceaseless labour . On each side of their master , seated on a stool higher than the rest , was an urchin of not more than four or five years of age , serious and demure , and as if proud of his eminent position , or working incessantly at his little file;—these were two sons of the bishop . “
80838	80850	80836	80836	boys	7264	” said the bishop , in a hoarse , harsh voice , “
81041	81070	81073	81073	bishop	3049	” and he sprang forward and seized the luckless ears of the first apprentice he could get hold off , and wrung them till the blood spouted forth . “
81075	81081	81073	81073	bishop	3049	” sang out the boy , “
81095	81096	81089	81093	a man what wants you	3050	” “
81101	81123	81089	81093	a man what wants you	3050	” said the bishop , looking round , and he caught the figure of Morley who had just entered the shop . “

81139	81143	81144	81144	I	0	” said Morley ; “

81164	81169	81159	81162	a man named Hatton	3051	” said the bishop ; “

81191	81195	81196	81196	Hem	497	” said Morley . “

81294	81408	81283	81283	you	3049	” said Morley . Upon this the bishop , looking up to the ceiling of the room in which there were several large chinks , began calling out lustily to some unseen person above , and immediately was replied to in a shrill voice of objurgation , demanding in peremptory words , interlarded with many oaths , what he wanted . His reply called down his unseen correspondent , who soon entered his workshop . It was the awful presence of Mrs Hatton ; a tall , bearded virago , with a file in her hand , for that seemed the distinctive arm of the house , and eyes flashing with unbridled power . “
81414	81418	81283	81283	you	3049	” said Hatton , “

81430	81583	81428	81428	I	0	” said Mrs Hatton ; and a thrill of terror pervaded the assembly . All the files moved in regular melody ; no one dared to raise his face ; even her two young children looked still more serious and demure . Not that any being present flattered himself for an instant that the most sedulous attention on his part could prevent an outbreak ; all that each aspired to , and wildly hoped , was that he might not be the victim singled out to have his head cut open , or his eye knocked out , or his ears half pulled off by the being who was the terror not only of the workshop , but of Wodgate itself,—their bishop ’s gentle wife . In the meantime , that worthy , taking Morley into a room where there were no machines at work except those made of iron , said , “
81592	81593	81588	81588	you	3056	” “
81599	81603	81604	81604	I	0	” said Morley , “

81674	81709	81672	81672	Hem	497	” said Morley , who was by nature a diplomatist , and instantly comprehended his position , being himself pumped when he came to pump ; but he resolved not to precipitate the affair . “
81720	81724	81715	81715	you	3056	” he asked . “
81732	81736	81737	81737	I	0	” said Hatton , “

81764	81770	81756	81756	you	3056	” said Hatton , eagerly . “

81910	83059	83060	83061	the queen	6328	” said the bishop . A few days after his morning walk with Sybil , it was agreed that Egremont should visit Mr Trafford ’s factory , which he had expressed a great desire to inspect . Gerard always left his cottage at break of dawn , and as Sybil had not yet paid her accustomed visit to her friend and patron , who was the employer of her father , it was arranged that Egremont should accompany her at a later and more convenient hour in the morning , and then that they should all return together . The factory was about a mile distant from their cottage , which belonged indeed to Mr Trafford , and had been built by him . He was the younger son of a family that had for centuries been planted in the land , but who , not satisfied with the factitious consideration with which society compensates the junior members of a territorial house for their entailed poverty , had availed himself of some opportunities that offered themselves , and had devoted his energies to those new sources of wealth that were unknown to his ancestors . His operations at first had been extremely limited , like his fortunes ; but with a small capital , though his profits were not considerable , he at least gained experience . With gentle blood in his veins , and old English feelings , he imbibed , at an early period of his career , a correct conception of the relations which should subsist between the employer and the employed . He felt that between them there should be other ties than the payment and the receipt of wages . A distant and childless relative , who made him a visit , pleased with his energy and enterprise , and touched by the development of his social views , left him a considerable sum , at a moment too when a great opening was offered to manufacturing capital and skill . Trafford , schooled in rigid fortunes , and formed by struggle , if not by adversity , was ripe for the occasion , and equal to it . He became very opulent , and he lost no time in carrying into life and being the plans which he had brooded over in the years when his good thoughts were limited to dreams . On the banks of his native Mowe he had built a factory which was now one of the marvels of the district ; one might almost say , of the country : a single room , spreading over nearly two acres , and holding more than two thousand work - people . The roof of groined arches , lighted by ventilating domes at the height of eighteen feet , was supported by hollow cast - iron columns , through which the drainage of the roof was effected . The height of the ordinary rooms in which the work - people in manufactories are engaged is not more than from nine to eleven feet ; and these are built in stories , the heat and effluvia of the lower rooms communicated to those above , and the difficulty of ventilation insurmountable . At Mr Trafford ’s , by an ingenious process , not unlike that which is practised in the House of Commons , the ventilation was also carried on from below , so that the whole building was kept at a steady temperature , and little susceptible to atmospheric influence . The physical advantages of thus carrying on the whole work in one chamber are great : in the improved health of the people , the security against dangerous accidents for women and youth , and the reduced fatigue resulting from not having to ascend and descend and carry materials to the higher rooms . But the moral advantages resulting from superior inspection and general observation are not less important : the child works under the eye of the parent , the parent under that of the superior workman ; the inspector or employer at a glance can behold all . When the workpeople of Mr Trafford left his factory they were not forgotten . Deeply had he pondered on the influence of the employer on the health and content of his workpeople . He knew well that the domestic virtues are dependent on the existence of a home , and one of his first efforts had been to build a village where every family might be well lodged . Though he was the principal proprietor , and proud of that character , he nevertheless encouraged his workmen to purchase the fee : there were some who had saved sufficient money to effect this : proud of their house and their little garden , and of the horticultural society , where its produce permitted them to be annual competitors . In every street there was a well : behind the factory were the public baths ; the schools were under the direction of the perpetual curate of the church , which Mr Trafford , though a Roman Catholic , had raised and endowed . In the midst of this village , surrounded by beautiful gardens , which gave an impulse to the horticulture of the community , was the house of Trafford himself , who comprehended his position too well to withdraw himself with vulgar exclusiveness from his real dependents , but recognized the baronial principle reviving in a new form , and adapted to the softer manners and more ingenious circumstances of the times . And what was the influence of such an employer and such a system of employment on the morals and manners of the employed ? Great : infinitely beneficial . The connexion of a labourer with his place of work , whether agricultural or manufacturing , is itself a vast advantage . Proximity to the employer brings cleanliness and order , because it brings observation and encouragement . In the settlement of Trafford crime was positively unknown : and offences were very slight . There was not a single person in the village of a reprobate character . The men were well clad ; the women had a blooming cheek ; drunkenness was unknown ; while the moral condition of the softer sex was proportionately elevated . The vast form of the spreading factory , the roofs and gardens of the village , the Tudor chimneys of the house of Trafford , the spire of the gothic church , with the sparkling river and the sylvan hack - ground , came rather suddenly on the sight of Egremont . They were indeed in the pretty village - street before he was aware he was about to enter it . Some beautiful children rushed out of a cottage and flew to Sybil , crying out , “
83066	83095	83096	83096	My	0	” one clinging to her dress , another seizing her arm , and a third , too small to struggle , pouting out its lips to be embraced . “
83099	83155	83063	83064	the queen	6328	” said Sybil laughing , as she greeted them all ; and then they ran away to announce to others that their queen had arrived . Others came : beautiful and young . As Sybil and Egremont walked along , the race too tender for labour , seemed to spring out of every cottage to greet “
83159	83226	83096	83096	My	0	” Her visits had been very rare of late , but they were never forgotten ; they formed epochs in the village annals of the children , some of whom knew only by tradition the golden age when Sybil Gerard lived at the great house , and daily glanced like a spirit among their homes , smiling and met with smiles , blessing and ever blessed . “
83230	83236	83096	83096	My	0	” she said to Egremont , “
83249	83284	83245	83247	this little boy	3069	” touching gently on his head a very serious urchin who had never left her side for a moment , proud of his position , and holding tight her hand with all his strength , “
83319	83595	83316	83317	Mr Gerard	424	” And she went her way . They had not separated five minutes when the sound of whirling wheels caught the ear of Egremont , and , looking round , he saw a cavalcade of great pretension rapidly approaching ; dames and cavaliers on horseback ; a brilliant equipage , postilions and four horses ; a crowd of grooms . Egremont stood aside . The horsemen and horsewomen caracoled gaily by him ; proudly swept on the sparkling barouche ; the saucy grooms pranced in his face . Their masters and mistresses were not strangers to him : he recognized with some dismay the liveries , and then the arms of Lord de Mowbray , and caught the cold , proud countenance of Lady Joan , and the flexible visage of Lady Maud , both on horseback , and surrounded by admiring cavaliers . Egremont flattered himself that he had not been recognised , and dismissing his little guide , instead of proceeding to the factory he sauntered away in an opposite direction , and made a visit to the church . The wife of Trafford embraced Sybil , and then embraced her again . She seemed as happy as the children of the village , that the joy of her roof , as of so many others , had returned to them , though only for a few hours . Her husband she said had just quitted the house ; he was obliged to go to the factory to receive a great and distinguished party who were expected this morning , having written to him several days before for permission to view the works . “
83604	83627	83316	83317	Mr Gerard	424	” said Mrs Trafford , a very refined woman , but unused to society , and who rather trembled at the ceremony ; “
83641	84011	83635	83635	Sybil	430	” This intimation so much alarmed Sybil that she rose as soon as was practicable ; and saying that she had some visits to make in the village , she promised to return when Mrs Trafford was less engaged . An hour elapsed ; there was a loud ring at the hall - door , the great and distinguished party had arrived . Mrs Trafford prepared for the interview , and tried to look very composed as the doors opened , and her husband ushered in and presented to her Lord and Lady de Mowbray , their daughters , Lady Firebrace , Mr Jermyn , who still lingered at the castle , and Mr Alfred Mountchesney and Lord Milford , who were mere passing guests , on their way to Scotland , but reconnoitering the heiresses in their course . Lord de Mowbray was profuse of praise and compliments . His lordship was apt to be too civil . The breed would come out sometimes . To - day he was quite the coffee - house waiter . He praised everything : the machinery , the workmen , the cotton manufactured and the cotton raw , even the smoke . But Mrs Trafford would not have the smoke defended , and his lordship gave the smoke up , but only to please her . As for Lady de Mowbray , she was as usual courteous and condescending , with a kind of smouldering smile on her fair aquiline face , that seemed half pleasure and half surprise at the strange people she was among . Lady Joan was haughty and scientific , approved of much , but principally of the system of ventilation , of which she asked several questions which greatly perplexed Mrs Trafford , who slightly blushed , and looked at her husband for relief , but he was engaged with Lady Maud , who was full of enthusiasm , entered into everything with the zest of sympathy , identified herself with the factory system almost as much as she had done with the crusades , and longed to teach in singing schools , found public gardens , and bid fountains flow and sparkle for the people . “
84020	84032	84012	84012	I	0	” said Lord Milford , as he was cutting a pasty ; “
84070	84071	84064	84064	I	0	” “

84103	84108	84101	84101	Sybil	430	” asked Lady Maud . “

84134	84139	84128	84132	a child of the house	3079	” said Mrs Trafford , “

84163	84168	84159	84159	she	3077	” asked Lord Milford , “

84188	84200	84179	84179	She	3077	” said Mr Trafford , addressing his answer to Lady Maud , “
84218	84219	84207	84207	She	3077	” “
84227	84228	84225	84225	you	0	” “

84272	84277	84278	84278	Her	3077	” enquired Mr Mountchesney . “
84297	84298	84301	84303	that handsome man	3091	” “
84309	84314	84301	84303	that handsome man	3091	” said Lady Maud , “
84323	84334	84321	84321	Papa	557	” she said , addressing herself to Lord de Mowbray , “
84367	84368	84369	84369	He	3093	” “
84376	84385	84369	84369	He	3093	” said Lord de Mowbray with many smiles . “
84388	84393	84369	84369	He	3093	” said Mr Trafford ; “
84417	84434	84414	84414	I	0	” he added , with a smile and in a lower tone to Lady de Mowbray , “
84450	84451	84441	84441	he	3093	” “
84457	84466	84453	84453	he	3093	” enquired her ladyship in a sugary tone . “
84470	84475	84453	84453	he	3093	” said Mr Trafford , “
84482	84483	84453	84453	he	3093	” “

84553	84559	84537	84537	we	3099	” said Lord de Mowbray , “
84594	84595	84591	84592	Mr Trafford	427	” “
84598	84603	84591	84592	Mr Trafford	427	” said Mr Trafford , “
84762	84763	84743	84743	you	3106	” “
84782	84795	84743	84743	you	3106	” said Lady Joan to Mr Jermyn , who stared and bowed . “
84820	84833	84811	84812	your inspector	3111	” said Lady Firebrace to Mr Trafford , who smiled a negative . “
84846	84852	84853	84853	His	3114	” enquired Lord de Mowbray . “
84858	84863	84856	84856	Gerard	430	” said Mr Trafford . “
84873	84883	84864	84864	I	0	” said Lord de Mowbray looking a little confused . “
84887	84892	84864	84864	I	0	” said Mr Trafford ; “
84928	84929	84930	84930	He	3117	” “
84937	84942	84934	84934	he	3117	” said Lady Maud . “
84952	85082	84934	84934	he	3117	” said Lord de Mowbray ; and then turning to Mrs Trafford he overwhelmed her with elaborate courtesies of phrase ; praised everything again ; first generally and then in detail ; the factory , which he seemed to prefer to his castle — the house , which he seemed to prefer even to the factory — the gardens , from which he anticipated even greater gratification than from the house . And this led to an expression of a hope that he would visit them . And so in due time the luncheon was achieved . Mrs Trafford looked at her guests , there was a rustling and a stir , and everybody was to go and see the gardens that Lord de Mowbray had so much praised . “
85093	85101	85102	85102	I	0	” said Mr Mountchesney to Lord Milford . “
85116	85132	85107	85109	the respectable manufacturer	3121	” replied his lordship . In the meantime Egremont had joined Gerard at the factory . “
85139	85143	85146	85146	you	3122	” said Gerard , “
85167	85168	85156	85156	We	3124	” “
85173	85177	85156	85156	We	3124	” said Egremont , “
85181	85182	85185	85185	they	3126	” “
85194	85202	85205	85205	they	3126	” he said in a mocking smile . “
85354	85355	85349	85349	He	3132	” “
85369	85373	85364	85364	they	3134	” said Egremont . “
85378	85382	85364	85364	they	3134	” said Gerard . “
85493	85494	85490	85491	master Franklin	3153	” “
85507	85508	85497	85497	you	3153	” “
85552	85553	85535	85535	He	1218	” “
85556	85557	85535	85535	He	1218	” “
85571	85575	85577	85577	he	1218	” said Gerard , “
85632	85642	85643	85643	I	0	” repeated Gerard in a voice of bitter sarcasm . “
85672	85791	85668	85668	Sybil	430	” In the meantime , Sybil had been sent for by Mrs Trafford . She had inferred from the message that the guests had departed , and her animated cheek showed the eagerness with which she had responded to the call . Bounding along with a gladness of the heart which lent additional lustre to her transcendent brightness , she suddenly found herself surrounded in the garden by Lady Maud and her friends . The daughter of Lord de Mowbray , who could conceive nothing but humility as the cause of her alarmed look , attempted to re - assure her by condescending volubility , turning often to her friends and praising in admiring interrogatories Sybil ’s beauty . “
85800	85811	85668	85668	Sybil	430	” said Lady Maud in a tone of amiable artlessness , “
85880	85894	85896	85896	you	3164	” she added in a lower but still distinct voice to her friend . “
85910	86039	86040	86040	You	3164	” Mr Mountchesney and Lord Milford poured forth several insipid compliments , accompanied with some speaking looks which they flattered themselves could not be misconstrued . Sybil said not a word , but answered each flood of phrases with a cold reverence . Undeterred by her somewhat haughty demeanour , which Lady Maud only attributed to the novelty of her situation , her ignorance of the world , and her embarrassment under this overpowering condescension , the good - tempered and fussy daughter of Lord de Mowbray proceeded to re - assure Sybil , and to enforce on her that this perhaps unprecedented descent from superiority was not a mere transient courtliness of the moment , and that she really might rely on her patronage and favourable feeling . “
86048	86053	86040	86040	You	3164	” said Lady Maud , “
86107	86108	86102	86102	you	3164	” “
86113	86120	86102	86102	you	3164	” said Sybil , very gravely , “
86128	86129	86131	86132	a darling	3173	” “
86134	86144	86147	86147	she	3174	” exclaimed Lady Maud looking round at her friends . “
86197	86198	86199	86199	Protege	3176	” “
86201	86205	86199	86199	Protege	3176	” said Sybil . “
86212	86213	86215	86216	a dear	3178	” “
86218	86228	86215	86216	a dear	3178	” said Lady Maud looking round to Lord Milford . “
86234	86235	86231	86231	she	3174	” “
86246	86258	86238	86238	you	3164	” said Mr Mountchesney . Sybil signified a negative , and added “
86267	86268	86259	86260	Mrs Trafford	556	” “
86278	86283	86269	86269	You	3164	” said Lady Maud . “
86323	86328	86329	86329	you	260	” continued Lady Maud ; “
86352	86353	86339	86339	mama	3180	” “
86356	86360	86339	86339	mama	3180	” said Sybil , “
86404	86405	86407	86407	I	0	” “
86414	86433	86407	86407	I	0	” said Maud , covering her surprise and mortification by a jaunty air that would not confess defeat . “
86439	86444	86437	86437	I	0	” said Mr Mountchesney . “
86450	86833	86448	86448	I	0	” whispered Lord Milford lingering a little behind . The great and distinguished party had disappeared ; their glittering barouche , their prancing horses , their gay grooms , all had vanished ; the sound of their wheels was no longer heard . Time flew on ; the bell announced that the labour of the week had closed . There was a half holiday always on the last day of the week at Mr Trafford ’s settlement ; and every man , woman , and child , were paid their wages in the great room before they left the mill . Thus the expensive and evil habits which result from wages being paid in public houses were prevented . There was also in this system another great advantage for the workpeople . They received their wages early enough to repair to the neighbouring markets and make their purchases for the morrow . This added greatly to their comfort , and rendering it unnecessary for them to run in debt to the shopkeepers , added really to their wealth . Mr Trafford thought that next to the amount of wages , the most important consideration was the method in which wages are paid ; and those of our readers who may have read or can recall the sketches , neither coloured nor exagerated , which we have given in the early part of this volume of the very different manner in which the working classes may receive the remuneration for their toil , will probably agree with the sensible and virtuous master of Walter Gerard . He , accompanied by his daughter and Egremont , is now on his way home . A soft summer afternoon ; the mild beam still gilding the tranquil scene ; a river , green meads full of kine , woods vocal with the joyous song of the thrush and the blackbird ; and in the distance , the lofty breast of the purple moor , still blazing in the sun : fair sights and renovating sounds after a day of labour passed in walls and amid the ceaseless and monotonous clang of the spindle and the loom . So Gerard felt it , as he stretched his great limbs in the air and inhaled its perfumed volume . “
86844	86848	86842	86842	Sybil	430	” he exclaimed ; “
86867	86941	86942	86943	Our companion	3189	” Egremont found the walk too short ; fortunately from the undulation of the vale , they could not see the cottage until within a hundred yards of it . When they were in sight , a man came forth from the garden to greet them ; Sybil gave an exclamation of pleasure ; it was MORLEY . Morley greeted Gerard and his daughter with great warmth , and then looked at Egremont . “
86951	86955	86942	86943	Our companion	3189	” said Gerard ; “
86994	86995	86976	86976	He	2541	” “
87006	87020	86999	86999	you	3191	” enquired Morley . Egremont reddened , was confused , and then replied , “
87046	87047	87048	87048	Hem	497	” “
87050	87076	87048	87048	Hem	497	” said Morley , and then taking Gerard by the arm , he walked away with him , leaving Egremont and Sybil to follow them . “
87085	87086	87083	87083	Walter	424	” “
87091	87092	87097	87098	the brother	3199	” “

87602	87651	87574	87574	Prithee	561	” So they entered together . The evening passed in various conversation , though it led frequently to the staple subject of talk beneath the roof of Gerard — the Condition of the People . What Morley had seen in his recent excursion afforded materials for many comments . “
87666	87670	87574	87574	Prithee	561	” said Gerard ; “

87943	89387	87933	87933	I	0	” Time passes with a measured and memorable wing during the first period of a sojourn in a new place , among new characters and new manners . Every person , every incident , every feeling , touches and stirs the imagination . The restless mind creates and observes at the same time . Indeed there is scarcely any popular tenet more erroneous than that which holds that when time is slow , life is dull . It is very often and very much the reverse . If we look back on those passages of our life which dwell most upon the memory , they are brief periods full of action and novel sensation . Egremont found this so during the first days of his new residence in Mowedale . The first week , an epoch in his life , seemed an age ; at the end of the first month , he began to deplore the swiftness of time and almost to moralize over the brevity of existence . He found that he was leading a life of perfect happiness , but of remarkable simplicity ; he wished it might never end , but felt difficulty in comprehending how in the first days of his experience of it , it had seemed so strange ; almost as strange as it was sweet . The day that commenced early , was past in reading — books lent him often too by Sybil Gerard — sometimes in a ramble with her and Morley , who had time much at his command , to some memorable spot in the neighbourhood , or in the sport which the river and the rod secured Egremont . In the evening , he invariably repaired to the cottage of Gerard , beneath whose humble roof he found every female charm that can fascinate , and conversation that stimulated his intelligence . Gerard was ever the same ; hearty , simple , with a depth of feeling and native thought on the subjects on which they touched , and with a certain grandeur of sentiment and conception which contrasted with his social position , but which became his idiosyncracy . Sybil spoke little , but hung upon the accents of her father ; yet ever and anon her rich tones conveyed to the charmed ear of Egremont some deep conviction , the earnestness of her intellect as remarkable as the almost sacred repose of her mien and manner . Of Morley , at first Egremont saw a great deal : he lent our friend books , opened with unreserve and with great richness of speculative and illustrative power , on the questions which ever engaged him , and which were new and highly interesting to his companion . But as time advanced , whether it were that the occupations of Morley increased , and the calls on his hours left him fewer occasions for the indulgence of social intercourse , Egremont saw him seldom , except at Gerard ’s cottage , where generally he might be found in the course of the week , and their rambles together had entirely ceased . Alone , Egremont mused much over the daughter of Gerard , but shrinking from the precise and the definite , his dreams were delightful , but vague . All that he asked was , that his present life should go on for ever ; he wished for no change , and at length almost persuaded himself that no change could arrive ; as men who are basking in a summer sun , surrounded by bright and beautiful objects , can not comprehend how the seasons can ever alter ; that the sparkling foliage should shrivel and fall away , the foaming waters become icebound , and the blue serene , a dark and howling space . In this train of mind , the early days of October having already stolen on him , an incident occurred which startled him in his retirement , and rendered it necessary that he should instantly quit it . Egremont had entrusted the secret of his residence to a faithful servant who communicated with him when necessary , under his assumed name . Through these means he received a letter from his mother , written from London , where she had unexpectedly arrived , entreating him , in urgent terms , to repair to her without a moment ’s delay , on a matter of equal interest and importance to herself and him . Such an appeal from such a quarter , from the parent that had ever been kind , and the friend that had been ever faithful , was not for a moment to be neglected . Already a period had elapsed since its transmission , which Egremont regretted . He resolved at once to quit Mowedale , nor could he console himself with the prospect of an immediate return . Parliament was to assemble in the ensuing month , and independent of the unknown cause which summoned him immediately to town , he was well aware that much disagreeable business awaited him which could no longer be postponed . He had determined not to take his seat unless the expenses of his contest were previously discharged , and despairing of his brother ’s aid , and shrinking from trespassing any further on his mother ’s resources , the future looked gloomy enough : indeed nothing but the frequent presence and the constant influence of Sybil had driven from his mind the ignoble melancholy which , relieved by no pensive fancy , is the invariable attendant of pecuniary embarrassment . And now he was to leave her . The event , rather the catastrophe , which under any circumstances , could not be long postponed , was to be precipitated . He strolled up to the cottage to bid her farewell and to leave kind words for her father . Sybil was not there . The old dame who kept their home informed him that Sybil was at the convent , but would return in the evening . It was impossible to quit Mowedale without seeing Sybil ; equally impossible to postpone his departure . But by travelling through the night , the lost hours might be regained . And Egremont made his arrangements , and awaited with anxiety and impatience the last evening . The evening , like his heart , was not serene . The soft air that had lingered so long with them , a summer visitant in an autumnal sky and loth to part , was no more present . A cold harsh wind , gradually rising , chilled the system and grated on the nerves . There was misery in its blast and depression in its moan . Egremont felt infinitely dispirited . The landscape around him that he had so often looked upon with love and joy , was dull and hard ; the trees dingy , the leaden waters motionless , the distant hills rough and austere . Where was that translucent sky , once brilliant as his enamoured fancy ; those bowery groves of aromatic fervor wherein he had loved to roam and muse ; that river of swift and sparkling light that flowed and flashed like the current of his enchanted hours ? All vanished — as his dreams . He stood before the cottage of Gerard ; he recalled the eve that he had first gazed upon its moonlit garden . What wild and delicious thoughts were then his ! They were gone like the illumined hour . Nature and fortune had alike changed . Prescient of sorrow , almost prophetic of evil , he opened the cottage door , and the first person his eye encountered was Morley . Egremont had not met him for some time , and his cordial greeting of Egremont to - night contrasted with the coldness , not to say estrangement , which to the regret and sometimes the perplexity of Egremont had gradually grown up between them . Yet on no occasion was his presence less desired by our friend . Morley was talking as Egremont entered with great animation ; in his hand a newspaper , on a paragraph contained in which he was commenting . The name of Marney caught the ear of Egremont who turned rather pale at the sound , and hesitated on the threshold . The unembarrassed welcome of his friends however re - assured him , and in a moment he even ventured to enquire the subject of their conversation . Morley immediately referring to the newspaper said , “
89396	89575	89391	89391	I	0	“ EXTRAORDINARY SPORT AT THE EARL OF MARNEY’S. On Wednesday , in a small cover called the Horns , near Marney Abbey , his grace the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine , the Earl of Marney , Colonel Rippe and Captain Grouse , with only four hours shooting , bagged the extraordinary number of seven hundred and thirty head of game , namely hares three hundred and thirty - nine ; pheasants two hundred and twenty - one ; partridges thirty - four ; rabbits eighty - seven ; and the following day upwards of fifty hares , pheasants , & c. , ( wounded the previous day ) were picked up . Out of the four hours ’ shooting two of the party were absent an hour and a - half , namely the Earl of Marney and Captain Grouse , attending an agricultural meeting in the neighbourhood ; the noble earl with his usual considerate condescension having kindly consented personally to distribute the various prizes to the labourers whose good conduct entitled them to the distinction . ”
89576	89586	89588	89588	Morley	423	“ What do you think of that , Franklin ? ”
89590	89652	89654	89654	Morley	423	“ That is our worthy friend of Marney Abbey , where we first met . You do not know this part of the country , or you would smile at the considerate condescension of the worst landlord in England ; and who was , it seems , thus employed the day or so after his battue , as they call it . ”
89663	89684	89685	89685	Magistrates	3235	“ At a Petty Sessions holden at the Green Dragon Inn , Marney , Friday , October — , 1837 . “
89702	89807	89699	89700	Captain Grouse	385	“ Information against Robert Hind for a trespass in pursuit of game in Blackrock Wood , the property of Sir Vavasour Firebrace , Bart . The case was distinctly proved ; several wires being found in the pocket of the defendant . Defendant was fined in the full penalty of forty shillings and costs twenty - seven ; the Bench being of opinion there was no excuse for him , Hind being in regular employ as a farm labourer and gaining his seven shillings a - week . Defendant being unable to pay the penalty , was sent for two months to Marham Gaol . ”
89808	89813	89815	89815	Morley	423	“ What a pity , ”
89817	89875	89815	89815	Morley	423	“ that Robert Hind , instead of meditating the snaring of a hare , had not been fortunate enough to pick up a maimed one crawling about the fields the day after the battue . It would certainly have been better for himself ; and if he has a wife and family , better for the parish . ”
89876	89879	89881	89881	Gerard	430	“ Oh ! ”
89883	89909	89881	89881	Gerard	430	“ I doubt not they were all picked up by the poulterer who has the contract : even the Normans did not sell their game . ”
89910	89915	89917	89917	Morley	423	“ The question is , ”
89919	89989	89917	89917	Morley	423	“ would you rather be barbarous or mean ; that is the alternative presented by the real and the pseudo Norman nobility of England . Where I have been lately , there is a Bishopsgate Street merchant who has been made for no conceiveable public reason a baron bold . Bigod and Bohun could not enforce the forest laws with such severity as this dealer in cotton and indigo . ”
89990	90007	90009	90009	Egremont	290	“ It is a difficult question to deal with — this affair of the game laws , ”
90011	90040	90009	90009	Egremont	290	“ how will you reach the evil ? Would you do away with the offence of trespass ? And if so , what is your protection for property ? ”
90041	90050	90052	90052	Morley	423	“ It comes to a simple point though , ”
90054	90082	90052	90052	Morley	423	“ the Territorialists must at length understand that they can not at the same time have the profits of a farm and the pleasures of a chase . ”
90466	90476	90458	90458	he	290	“ Best of friends , I must leave Mowedale . ”
90477	90483	90485	90485	Gerard	430	“ I am very sorry , ”
90487	90491	90458	90458	he	290	“ and when ? ”
90492	90495	90497	90497	Egremont	290	“ Now , ”
90499	90502	90504	90504	Sybil	430	“ Now ! ”
90506	90534	90535	90535	he	290	“ Yes ; this instant . My summons is urgent . I ought to have left this morning . I came here then to bid you farewell , ”
90541	90577	90579	90579	his	290	“ to express to you how deeply I was indebted to you for all your goodness — how dearly I shall cherish the memory of these happy days — the happiest I have ever known ; ”
90583	90637	90579	90579	his	290	“ I came also to leave a kind message for you , my friend , a hope that we might meet again and soon — but your daughter was absent , and I could not leave Mowedale without seeing either of you . So I must contrive to get on through the night . ”
90638	90647	90649	90649	Gerard	430	“ Well we lose a very pleasant neighbour , ”
90651	90665	90649	90649	Gerard	430	“ we shall miss you , I doubt not , eh , Sybil ? ”
90782	90795	90796	90796	he	290	“ you have shewn me a thousand kindnesses , which I cherish , ”
90803	90821	90823	90823	he	290	“ above all human circumstances . Would you deign to let this volume lie upon your table , ”
90845	90853	90823	90823	he	290	“ Sybil , from a faithful friend . ”
90854	90859	90861	90861	Sybil	430	“ I accept it , ”
90870	90877	90878	90878	She	430	“ in remembrance of a friend . ”
91191	91196	91198	91198	Egremont	290	“ Who is there ? ”
91367	91370	91371	91371	he	290	“ Harold ! ”
91513	91524	91526	91527	Mr Berners	272	“ Are you going down to the house , Egerton ? ”
91549	91568	91574	91574	they	3259	“ The moment I have sealed this letter ; we will walk down together , if you like ! ”
91579	91593	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ Our fellows are in a sort of fright about this Jamaica bill , ”
91614	91629	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ Do n’t say anything about it , but there ’s a screw loose . ”
91630	91640	91603	91603	he	569	“ The deuce ! But how do you mean ? ”
91641	91653	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ They say the Rads are going to throw us over . ”
91654	91680	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ Talk , talk . They have threatened this half - a - dozen times . Smoke , sir ; it will end in smoke . ”
91681	91707	91603	91603	he	569	“ I hope it may ; but I know , in great confidence mind you , that Lord John was saying something about it yesterday . ”
91708	91752	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ That may be ; I believe our fellows are heartily sick of the business , and perhaps would be glad of an excuse to break up the government : but we must not have Peel in ; nothing could prevent a dissolution . ”
91753	91770	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ Their fellows go about and say that Peel would not dissolve if he came in . ”
91771	91775	91603	91603	he	569	“ Trust him ! ”
91776	91786	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ He has had enough of dissolutions they say . ”
91787	91807	91595	91596	Mr Egerton	569	“ Why , after all they have not done him much harm . Even — 34 was a hit . ”
91808	91812	91814	91815	Mr Egerton	569	“ Whoever dissolves , ”
91817	91835	91814	91815	Mr Egerton	569	“ I do n’t think there will be much of a majority either way in our time . ”
91836	91843	91845	91846	Mr Berners	272	“ We have seen strange things , ”
91848	91863	91865	91866	Mr Egerton	569	“ They never would think of breaking up the government without making their peers , ”
91868	91900	91865	91866	Mr Egerton	569	“ The Queen is not over partial to making more peers ; and when parties are in the present state of equality , the Sovereign is no longer a mere pageant . ”
91901	91919	91921	91922	Mr Egerton	569	“ They say her Majesty is more touched about these affairs of the Chartists than anything else , ”
91924	91943	91921	91922	Mr Egerton	569	“ They are rather queer ; but for my part I have no serious fears of a Jacquerie . ”
91944	92026	91865	91866	Mr Egerton	569	“ Not if it comes to an outbreak ; but a passive resistance Jacquerie is altogether a different thing . When we see a regular Convention assembled in London and holding its daily meetings in Palace Yard ; and a general inclination evinced throughout the country to refrain from the consumption of exciseable articles , I can not help thinking that affairs are more serious than you imagine . I know the government are all on the ‘ qui vive . ’ ”
92027	92034	92036	92039	Lord Fitz - Heron	573	“ Just the fellows we wanted ! ”
92063	92071	92073	92074	Lord Milford	260	“ We want a brace of pairs , ”
92076	92083	92073	92074	Lord Milford	260	“ Will you two fellows pair ? ”
92084	92090	92092	92093	Mr Egerton	569	“ I must go down , ”
92095	92106	92092	92093	Mr Egerton	569	“ but I will pair from halfpast seven to eleven . ”
92107	92117	92119	92119	Berners	272	“ I just paired with Ormsby at White ’s , ”
92121	92152	92119	92119	Berners	272	“ not half an hour ago . We are both going to dine at Eskdale ’s , and so it was arranged . Have you any news to - day ? ”
92153	92173	92175	92176	Lord Milford	260	“ Nothing ; except that they say that Alfred Mountchesney is going to marry Lady Joan Fitz - Warene , ”
92178	92187	92189	92190	Mr Egerton	569	“ She has been given to so many , ”
92192	92202	92189	92190	Mr Egerton	569	“ It is always so with these great heiresses , ”
92207	92237	92189	92190	Mr Egerton	569	“ They never marry . They can not bear the thought of sharing their money . I bet Lady Joan will turn out another specimen of the TABITHA CROESUS . ”
92238	92248	92250	92253	Lord Fitz - Heron	573	“ Well , put down our pair , Egerton , ”
92255	92267	92250	92253	Lord Fitz - Heron	573	“ You do not dine at Sidonia ’s by any chance ? ”
92268	92308	92189	92190	Mr Egerton	569	“ Would that I did ! You will have the best dishes and the best guests . I feed at old Malton ’s ; perhaps a tete a tete : Scotch broth , and to tell him the news ! ”
92309	92335	92337	92338	Lord Milford	260	“ There is nothing like being a dutiful nephew , particularly when one ’s uncle is a bachelor and has twenty thousand a - year , ”
92340	92355	92337	92338	Lord Milford	260	“ Au revoir ! I suppose there will be no division to - night . ”
92356	92360	92361	92361	Egerton	569	“ No chance . ”
92404	92448	92401	92402	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Ah ! Mr Berners , how d’ye do ? You were just the person I wanted to see ! How is Lady Augusta , Mr Egerton ? You have no idea , Mr Berners , how I have been fighting your battles ! ”
92449	92455	92463	92463	he	272	“ Really , Lady Firebrace , ”
92479	92485	92463	92463	he	272	“ You are too good . ”
92486	92500	92502	92503	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Oh ! I do n’t care what a person ’s politics are ! ”
92511	92561	92502	92503	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I should be very glad indeed to see you one of us . You know your father was ! But if any one is my friend I never will hear him attacked behind his back without fighting his battles ; and I certainly did fight yours last night . ”
92562	92570	92463	92463	he	272	“ Pray tell me where it was ? ”
92571	92575	92502	92503	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Lady Crumbleford — ”
92576	92581	92583	92584	Mr Berners	272	“ Confound Lady Crumbleford ! ”
92591	92603	92502	92503	Lady Firebrace	365	“ No , no ; Lady Crumbleford told Lady Alicia Severn . ”
92604	92609	92611	92611	Berners	272	“ Yes , yes , ”
92622	92629	92631	92632	Lady Firebrace	365	“ But I can not stop , ”
92634	92649	92631	92632	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I must be with Lady St Julians exactly at a quarter past four ; ”
92657	92670	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ I would sooner meet any woman in London than Lady Firebrace , ”
92675	92704	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ she makes me uneasy for the day : she contrives to convince me that the whole world are employed behind my back in abusing or ridiculing me . ”
92705	92711	92713	92713	Egerton	569	“ It is her way , ”
92715	92804	92713	92713	Egerton	569	“ she proves her zeal by showing you that you are odious . It is very successful with people of weak nerves . Scared at their general unpopularity , they seek refuge with the very person who at the same time assures them of their odium and alone believes it unjust . She rules that poor old goose , Lady Gramshawe , who feels that Lady Firebrace makes her life miserable , but is convinced that if she break with the torturer , she loses her only friend . ”
92805	92822	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ There goes a man who is as much altered as any fellow of our time . ”
92823	92844	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ Not in his looks ; I was thinking the other night that he was better - looking than ever . ”
92845	92919	92713	92713	Egerton	569	“ Oh ! no ; not in his looks ; but in his life . I was at Christchurch with him , and we entered the world about the same time . I was rather before him . He did everything ; and did it well . And now one never sees him , except at the House . He goes nowhere ; and they tell me he is a regular reading man . ”
92920	92929	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ Do you think he looks to office ? ”
92930	92938	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ He does not put himself forward . ”
92939	92956	92958	92958	Egerton	569	“ He attends ; and his brother will always be able to get anything for him , ”
92960	92974	92958	92958	Egerton	569	“ Oh ! he and Marney never speak ; they hate each other . ”
92975	93001	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ By Jove ! However there is his mother ; with this marriage of hers and Deloraine House , she will be their grandest dame . ”
93002	93068	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ She is the only good woman the tories have : I think their others do them harm , from Lady St Julians down to your friend Lady Firebrace . I wish Lady Deloraine were with us . She keeps their men together wonderfully ; makes her house agreeable ; and then her manner — it certainly is perfect ; natural , and yet refined . ”
93069	93102	92958	92958	Egerton	569	“ Lady Mina Blake has an idea that far from looking to office , Egremont ’s heart is faintly with his party ; and that if it were not for the Marchioness — ”
93103	93111	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ We might gain him , eh ? ”
93112	93131	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ Hem ; I hardly know that : he has got crotchets about the people I am told . ”
93132	93141	92958	92958	Egerton	569	“ What , the ballot and household suffrage ? ”
93142	93173	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ Gad , I believe it is quite a different sort of a thing . I do not know what it is exactly ; but I understand he is crotchetty . ”
93174	93198	92672	92673	Mr Berners	272	“ Well , that will not do for Peel . He does not like crotchetty men . Do you see that , Egerton ? ”
93277	93283	93285	93287	Lady St Julians	365	“ I give them eleven , ”
93289	93296	93298	93299	Lady Deloraine	581	“ Well , Charles tells me , ”
93301	93324	93298	93299	Lady Deloraine	581	“ that Sir Thomas says so , and he certainly is generally right ; but it is not Charles ’ own opinion . ”
93325	93336	93338	93340	Lady St Julians	365	“ Sir Thomas , I know , gives them eleven , ”
93342	93362	93364	93364	she	365	“ and that would satisfy me ; and we will say eleven . But I have a list here , ”
93381	93498	93364	93364	she	365	“ which proves that they can not have more than nine ; but this is in the greatest confidence : of course between us there can be no secrets . It is Mr Tadpole ’s list ; nobody has seen it but me ; not even Sir Robert . Lord Grubminster has had a stroke : they are concealing it , but Mr Tadpole has found it out . They wanted to pair him off with Colonel Fantomme , who they think is dying : but Mr Tadpole has got a Mesmerist who has done wonders for him , and who has guaranteed that he shall vote . Well , that makes a difference of one . ”
93499	93506	93364	93364	she	365	“ And then Sir Henry Churton — ”
93507	93514	93516	93518	Lady St Julians	365	“ Oh ! you know it , ”
93524	93532	93516	93518	Lady St Julians	365	“ Yes : he votes with us . ”
93539	93543	93544	93544	she	581	“ I think , ”
93547	93614	93544	93544	she	581	“ I know the origin of that report . Quite a mistake . He is in a bad humour , has been so the whole session , and he was at Lady Alice Fermyne ’s , and did say all sorts of things . All that is true . But he told Charles this morning on a committee , that he should vote with the Government . ”
93615	93619	93621	93623	Lady St Julians	365	“ Stupid man ! ”
93625	93678	93621	93623	Lady St Julians	365	“ I never could bear him . And I have sent his vulgar wife and great staring daughter a card for next Wednesday ! Well , I hope affairs will soon be brought to a crisis , for I do not think I can bear much longer this life of perpetual sacrifice , ”
93707	93719	93721	93722	Lady Deloraine	581	“ There is no chance of a division to - night , ”
93724	93729	93731	93733	Lady St Julians	365	“ That is settled , ”
93735	93751	93731	93733	Lady St Julians	365	“ Adieu , my dear friend . We meet , I believe , at dinner ? ”
93752	93755	93757	93758	Mr Egerton	569	“ Plotting , ”
93770	93777	93779	93779	Berners	272	“ The only consolation one has , ”
93781	93809	93779	93779	Berners	272	“ is , that if they do turn us out , Lady Deloraine and Lady St Julians must quarrel , for they both want the same thing . ”
93810	93817	93819	93819	Egerton	569	“ Lady Deloraine will have it , ”
93864	93870	93872	93872	Egerton	569	“ How will Trodgits go ? ”
93874	93882	93884	93884	Jermyn	478	“ I think Trodgits will stay away , ”
93886	93906	93908	93908	Berners	272	“ Who do you give that new man to — that north - country borough fellow;—what ’s his name ? ”
93910	93920	93922	93922	Jermyn	478	“ Blugsby ! Oh , Blugsby dined with Peel , ”
93924	93933	93935	93935	Egerton	569	“ Our fellows say dinners are no good , ”
93937	94060	93935	93935	Egerton	569	“ and they certainly are a cursed bore : but you may depend upon it they do for the burgesses . We do n’t dine our men half enough . Now Blugsby was just the sort of fellow to be caught by dining with Peel : and I dare say they made Peel remember to take wine with him . We got Melbourne to give a grand feed the other day to some of our men who want attention they say , and he did not take wine with a single guest . He forgot . I wonder what they are doing at the House ! Here ’s Spencer May , he will tell us . Well , what is going on ? ”
94061	94070	94106	94107	Mr Berners	272	“ WISHY is up , and WASHY follows . ”
94071	94078	93935	93935	Egerton	569	“ No division , of course ? ”
94079	94092	94106	94107	Mr Berners	272	“ Not a chance ; a regular covey ready on both sides . ”
94637	94647	94649	94650	Lady Marney	3323	“ A truce to politics , my dear Charles , ”
94652	94807	94649	94650	Lady Marney	3323	“ you must be wearied with my inquiries . Besides , I do not take the sanguine view of affairs in which some of our friends indulge . I am one of those who think the pear is not ripe . These men will totter on , and longer perhaps than even themselves imagine . I want to speak of something very different . To - morrow , my dear son , is your birth - day . Now I should grieve were it to pass without your receiving something which showed that its recollection was cherished by your mother . But of all silly things in the world , the silliest is a present that is not wanted . It destroys the sentiment a little perhaps but it enhances the gift , if I ask you in the most literal manner to assist me in giving you something that really would please you ? ”
94808	94818	94820	94820	Egremont	290	“ But how can I , my dear mother ? ”
94822	94838	94820	94820	Egremont	290	“ You have ever been so kind and so generous that I literally want nothing . ”
94839	94857	94859	94860	Lady Marney	3324	“ Oh ! you can not be such a fortunate man as to want nothing , Charles , ”
94865	94965	94859	94860	Lady Marney	3324	“ A dressing - case you have : your rooms are furnished enough : all this is in my way ; but there are such things as horses and guns of which I know nothing , but which men always require . You must want a horse or a gun , Charles . Well , I should like you to get either ; the finest , the most valuable that money can purchase . Or a brougham , Charles ; what do you think of a new brougham ? Would you like that Barker should build you a brougham ? ”
94966	94993	94820	94820	Egremont	290	“ You are too good , my dear mother . I have horses and guns enough ; and my present carriage is all I can desire . ”
94994	95023	94859	94860	Lady Marney	3324	“ You will not assist me , then ? You are resolved that I shall do something very stupid . For to give you something I am determined . ”
95024	95030	95032	95032	Egremont	290	“ Well my dear mother , ”
95038	95046	95032	95032	Egremont	290	“ give me something that is here . ”
95047	95051	95053	95054	Lady Marney	3325	“ Choose then , ”
95088	95098	95100	95100	Egremont	290	“ It would be plunder , my dear mother , ”
95102	95123	95125	95125	she	3325	“ No , no ; you have said it ; you shall choose something . Will you have those vases ? ”
95137	95149	95151	95151	Egremont	290	“ They are in too becoming a position to be disturbed , ”
95153	95186	95151	95151	Egremont	290	“ and would ill suit my quiet chambers , where a bronze or a marble is my greatest ornament . If you would permit me , I would rather choose a picture ? ”
95187	95194	95196	95197	Lady Marney	3327	“ Then select one at once , ”
95199	95228	95196	95197	Lady Marney	3327	“ I make no reservation , except that Watteau , for it was given me by your father before we were married . Shall it be this Cuyp ? ”
95229	95236	95238	95238	Egremont	290	“ I would rather choose this , ”
95291	95338	95241	95241	he	290	“ Ah ! you choose that ! Well , that was a great favourite of poor Sir Thomas Lawrence . But for my part I have never seen any one in the least like it , and I think I am sure that you have not . ”
95339	95344	95346	95346	Egremont	290	“ It reminds me — ”
95349	95356	95358	95359	Lady Marney	3330	“ Of what you have dreamed , ”
95361	95365	95367	95367	Egremont	290	“ Perhaps so , ”
95369	95380	95367	95367	Egremont	290	“ indeed I think it must have been a dream . ”
95381	95392	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ Well , the vision shall still hover before you , ”
95397	95414	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ and you shall find this portrait to - morrow over your chimney in the Albany . ”
95415	95420	95367	95367	Egremont	290	“ Strangers must withdraw . ”
95421	95430	95367	95367	Egremont	290	“ Division : clear the gallery . Withdraw . ”
95431	95563	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ Nonsense ; no ; it ’s quite ridiculous ; quite absurd . Some fellow must get up . Send to the Carlton ; send to the Reform ; send to Brookes ’s . Are your men ready ? No ; are your ’s ? I am sure I ca n’t say . What does it mean ? Most absurd ! Are there many fellows in the library ? The smoking - room is quite full . All our men are paired till half - past eleven . It wants five minutes to the halfhour . What do you think of Trenchard ’s speech ? I do n’t care for ourselves ; I am sorry for him . Well that is very charitable . Withdraw , withdraw ; you must withdraw . ”
95564	95572	95574	95576	a Conservative whipling	3332	“ Where are you going , Fitztheron ? ”
95578	95605	95574	95576	a Conservative whipling	3332	“ I must go ; I am paired till half - past eleven , and it wants some minutes , and my man is not here . ”
95606	95610	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ Confound it ! ”
95611	95617	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ How will it go ? ”
95618	95626	95574	95576	a Conservative whipling	3332	“ Gad , I do n’t know . ”
95627	95631	95394	95395	his mother	1279	“ Fishy eh ? ”
95632	95635	95637	95640	the under - whip	3333	“ Deuced ! ”
95934	95942	95944	95946	Lady St Julians	365	“ The rest may be accounted for , ”
95954	96004	95944	95946	Lady St Julians	365	“ it is simply vexatious ; it was a surprise and will be a lesson : but this affair of this Mr Trenchard — and they tell me that William Loraine was absolutely cheering him the whole time — what does it mean ? Do you know the man ? ”
96005	96022	96024	96025	Lady Deloraine	581	“ I have heard Charles speak of him , and I think much in his favour , ”
96027	96064	96024	96025	Lady Deloraine	581	“ if he were here , he would tell us more about it . I wonder he does not come : he never misses looking in after a great division and giving me all the news . ”
96065	96074	96076	96078	Lady St Julians	365	“ Do you know , my dear friend , ”
96086	96235	96076	96078	Lady St Julians	365	“ I am half meditating a great stroke ? This is not a time for trifling . It is all very well for these people to boast of their division of last night , but it was a surprise , and as great to them as to us . I know there is dissension in the camp ; ever since that Finality speech of Lord John , there has been a smouldering sedition . Mr Tadpole knows all about it ; he has liaisons with the frondeurs . This affair of Trenchard may do us the greatest possible injury . When it comes to a fair fight , the government have not more than twelve or so . If this Mr Trenchard and three or four others choose to make themselves of importance — you see ? The danger is imminent , it must be met with decision . ”
96236	96244	96024	96025	Lady Deloraine	581	“ And what do you propose doing ? ”
96245	96251	96076	96078	Lady St Julians	365	“ Has he a wife ? ”
96252	96271	96076	96078	Lady St Julians	365	“ I really do not know . I wish Charles would come , perhaps he could tell us . ”
96272	96280	96282	96284	Lady St Julians	365	“ I have no doubt he has , ”
96286	96332	96282	96284	Lady St Julians	365	“ One would have met him , somehow or other in the course of two years , if he had not been married . Well , married or unmarried , with his wife , or without his wife,—I shall send him a card for Wednesday . ”
96354	96365	96367	96368	Lady Deloraine	581	“ Do not you think it would be rather sudden ? ”
96370	96394	96367	96368	Lady Deloraine	581	“ What does that signify ? He will understand it ; he will have gained his object ; and all will be right . ”
96395	96412	96282	96284	Lady St Julians	365	“ But are you sure it is his object ? We do not know the man . ”
96413	96421	96423	96425	Lady St Julians	365	“ What else can be his object ? ”
96427	96687	96423	96425	Lady St Julians	365	“ People get into Parliament to get on ; their aims are indefinite . If they have indulged in hallucinations about place before they enter the House , they are soon freed from such distempered fancies ; they find they have no more talent than other people , and if they had , they learn that power , patronage and pay are reserved for us and our friends . Well then like practical men , they look to some result , and they get it . They are asked out to dinner more than they would be ; they move rigmarole resolutions at nonsensical public meetings ; and they get invited with their women to assemblies at their leader ’s where they see stars and blue ribbons , and above all , us , whom they little think in appearing on such occasions , make the greatest conceivable sacrifice . Well then , of course such people are entirely in one ’s power , if one only had time and inclination to notice them . You can do anything with them . Ask them to a ball , and they will give you their votes ; invite them to dinner and if necessary they will rescind them ; but cultivate them , remember their wives at assemblies and call their daughters , if possible , by their right names ; and they will not only change their principles or desert their party for you ; but subscribe their fortunes if necessary and lay down their lives in your service . ”
96688	96702	96704	96705	Lady Deloraine	581	“ You paint them to the life , my dear Lady St Julians , ”
96708	96725	96704	96705	Lady Deloraine	581	“ but with such knowledge and such powers , why did you not save our boroughs ? ”
96726	96739	96741	96743	Lady St Julians	365	“ We had lost our heads , then , I must confess , ”
96745	96817	96818	96819	The servant	3357	“ What with the dear King and the dear Duke , we really had brought ourselves to believe that we lived in the days of Versailles or nearly ; and I must admit I think we had become a little too exclusive . Out of the cottage circle , there was really no world , and after all we were lost not by insulting the people but by snubbing the aristocracy . ”
96824	96840	96842	96842	she	3357	“ Oh ! my dear Lady Deloraine . Oh ! my dear Lady St Julians ! ”
96847	96856	96858	96860	Lady St Julians	365	“ You have no news , I suppose , ”
96862	96878	96858	96860	Lady St Julians	365	“ Only about that dreadful Mr Trenchard ; you know the reason why he ratted ? ”
96879	96884	96886	96888	Lady St Julians	365	“ No , indeed , ”
96893	96906	96886	96888	Lady St Julians	365	“ An invitation to Lansdowne House , for himself and his wife ! ”
96907	96915	96858	96860	Lady St Julians	365	“ Oh ! he is married then ? ”
96916	96943	96858	96860	Lady St Julians	365	“ Yes ; she is at the bottom of it all . Terms regularly settled beforehand . I have a note here — all the facts . ”
96957	96966	96968	96970	Lady St Julians	365	“ Lansdowne House is destined to cross me , ”
96974	96981	96983	96984	Lady Deloraine	581	“ Well it is very provoking , ”
96986	97000	96983	96984	Lady Deloraine	581	“ when you had made up your mind to ask them for Wednesday . ”
97001	97010	97012	97014	Lady St Julians	365	“ Yes , that alone is a sacrifice , ”
97016	97024	97026	97026	Egremont	290	“ Talking over the division I suppose , ”
97031	97037	97039	97041	Lady St Julians	365	“ Ah ! Mr Egremont , ”
97043	97052	97039	97041	Lady St Julians	365	“ What a hachis you made of it . ”
97064	97067	97069	97070	Lady Deloraine	581	“ Charles , ”
97072	97094	97069	97070	Lady Deloraine	581	“ we were talking of this Mr Trenchard . Did I not once hear you say you knew something of him ? ”
97095	97106	97039	97041	Lady St Julians	365	“ Why , he is one of my intimate acquaintance . ”
97107	97117	97119	97121	Lady St Julians	365	“ Heavens ! what a man for a friend ! ”
97123	97126	97119	97121	Lady St Julians	365	“ Heavens ! ”
97134	97147	97149	97150	Lady Deloraine	581	“ And why did you not present him to me , Charles , ”
97152	97161	97149	97150	Lady Deloraine	581	“ I did ; at Lady Peel ’s . ”
97162	97172	97128	97129	Lady Firebrace	365	“ And why did you not ask him here ? ”
97173	97185	97149	97150	Lady Deloraine	581	“ I did several times ; but he would not come . ”
97186	97196	97198	97199	Lady Firebrace	365	“ He is going to Lansdowne House , though , ”
97201	97218	97220	97220	Egremont	290	“ I suppose you wrote the leading article in the Standard which I have just read , ”
97223	97238	97220	97220	Egremont	290	“ It announces in large type the secret reasons of Mr Trenchard ’s vote . ”
97239	97245	97247	97248	Lady Firebrace	365	“ It is a fact , ”
97250	97293	97247	97248	Lady Firebrace	365	“ That Trenchard is going to Lansdowne House to - night ; very likely . I have met him at Lansdowne House half - a - dozen times . He is very intimate with the family and lives in the same county . ”
97294	97299	97301	97302	Lady Firebrace	365	“ But his wife , ”
97304	97319	97301	97302	Lady Firebrace	365	“ that ’s the point : he never could get his wife there before . ”
97320	97325	97327	97327	Egremont	290	“ He has none , ”
97331	97338	97340	97342	Lady St Julians	365	“ Then we may regain him , ”
97346	97367	97340	97342	Lady St Julians	365	“ You shall make a little dinner to Greenwich , Mr Egremont , and I will sit next to him . ”
97368	97372	97374	97374	Egremont	290	“ Fortunate Trenchard ! ”
97376	97482	97374	97374	Egremont	290	“ But do you know I fear he is hardly worthy of his lot . He has a horror of fine ladies ; and there is nothing in the world he more avoids than what you call society . At home , as this morning when I breakfasted with him , or in a circle of his intimates , he is the best company in the world ; no one so well informed , fuller of rich humour , and more sincerely amiable . He is popular with all who know him — except Taper , Lady St Julians , and Tadpole , Lady Firebrace . ”
97483	97496	97498	97500	Lady St Julians	365	“ Well , I think I will ask him still for Wednesday , ”
97502	97522	97498	97500	Lady St Julians	365	“ and I will write him a little note . If society is not his object , what is ? ”
97523	97526	97528	97528	Egremont	290	“ Ay ! ”
97530	97641	97498	97500	Lady St Julians	365	“ there is a great question for you and Lady Firebrace to ponder over . This is a lesson for you fine ladies , who think you can govern the world by what you call your social influences : asking people once or twice a - year to an inconvenient crowd in your house ; now haughtily smirking , and now impertinently staring , at them ; and flattering yourselves all this time , that to have the occasional privilege of entering your saloons and the periodical experience of your insolent recognition , is to be a reward for great exertions , or if necessary an inducement to infamous tergiversation . ”
98011	98022	98024	98025	Dandy Mick	440	“ I wonder if Warner will speak to - night , ”
98029	98039	98041	98042	his companion	786	“ He ca n’t pitch it in like Gerard , ”
98044	98054	98056	98057	the Dandy	440	“ But he is a trump in the tender , ”
98059	98076	98056	98057	the Dandy	440	“ The Handlooms looks to him as their man , and that ’s a powerful section . ”
98077	98095	98097	98097	Devilsdust	467	“ If you come to the depth of a question , there ’s nothing like Stephen Morley , ”
98099	98128	98097	98097	Devilsdust	467	“ ‘ Twould take six clergymen any day to settle him . He knows the principles of society by heart . But Gerard gets hold of the passions . ”

98145	98157	98142	98143	Dandy Mick	440	“ I wish he would say march , and no mistake . ”
98158	98170	98172	98172	Devilsdust	467	“ There is a great deal to do before saying that , ”
98174	98229	98172	98172	Devilsdust	467	“ We must have discussion , because when it comes to reasoning , the oligarchs have not got a leg to stand on ; and we must stop the consumption of exciseable articles , and when they have no tin to pay the bayonets and their b — y police , they are dished . ”
98230	98239	98241	98241	Mick	440	“ You have a long head , Dusty , ”
98243	98261	98263	98264	his friend	6719	“ Why I have been thinking of it ever since I knew two and two made four , ”
98266	98321	98322	98322	he	440	“ I was not ten years old when I said to myself — It ’s a pretty go this , that I should be toiling in a shoddy - hole to pay the taxes for a gentleman what drinks his port wine and stretches his legs on a Turkey carpet . Hear , hear , ”
98334	98363	98364	98364	Gerard	424	“ Ah ! that ’s the man for the people . You will see , Mick , whatever happens , Gerard is the man who will always lead . ”
98643	98648	98650	98650	he	6719	“ Now , Mick , ”
98661	98666	98650	98650	he	6719	“ are you firm ? ”
98667	98674	98676	98677	his friend	6719	“ All right , my hearty , ”
98687	98697	98699	98699	Devilsdust	467	“ There is a good deal to go through , ”
98701	98707	98699	98699	Devilsdust	467	“ It tries a man . ”
98708	98715	98650	98650	he	6719	“ You do n’t mean that ? ”
98716	98733	98699	98699	Devilsdust	467	“ But if you are firm , all ’s right . Now I must leave you . ”
98734	98741	98743	98743	Mick	440	“ No , no , Dusty , ”
98745	98750	98752	98752	Devilsdust	467	“ I must go , ”
98754	98786	98752	98752	Devilsdust	467	“ and you must rest here till you are sent for . Now mind — whatever is bid you , obey ; and whatever you see , be quiet . There , ”
98804	98833	98837	98837	he	6719	“ give a good pull , man , I ca n’t leave it you , for though your heart must be warm , your head must be cool , ”
99185	99194	99182	99182	he	440	“ I say , what do you want ? ”
99199	99204	99206	99206	Mick	440	“ Come , come , ”
99210	99226	99206	99206	Mick	440	“ none of this sort of thing . I say , you must speak though . ”
99257	99266	99268	99268	Mick	440	“ No , no ; none of that , ”
99365	99381	99356	99359	one of the masks	3415	“ In five minutes you will be in the presence of the SEVEN — prepare . ”
99523	99529	99860	99862	a presiding one	3425	“ I denounce John Briars . ”
99530	99533	99860	99862	a presiding one	3425	“ Why ? ”
99537	99645	99860	99862	a presiding one	3425	“ He offers to take nothing but piece - work ; the man who does piece - work is guilty of less defensible conduct than a drunkard . The worst passions of our nature are enlisted in support of piece - work . Avarice , meanness , cunning , hypocrisy , all excite and feed upon the miserable votary who works by the task and not by the hour . A man who earns by piece - work forty shillings per week , the usual wages for day - work being twenty , robs his fellows of a week ’s employment ; therefore I denounce John Briars . ”
99646	99652	99654	99656	the other voice	3421	“ Let it go forth , ”
99658	99696	99654	99656	the other voice	3421	“ John Briars is denounced . If he receive another week ’s wages by the piece , he shall not have the option of working the week after for time . No.87 , see to John Briars . ”
99697	99704	99706	99707	another voice	3422	“ I denounce Claughton and Hicks , ”
99709	99712	99706	99707	another voice	3422	“ Why ? ”
99713	99731	99654	99656	the other voice	3421	“ They have removed Gregory Ray from being a superintendent , because he belonged to this lodge . ”
99732	99754	99654	99656	the other voice	3421	“ Brethren , is it your pleasure that there shall be a turn out for ten days at Claughton and Hicks ? ”
99755	99761	99763	99764	several voices	3423	“ It is our pleasure , ”
99766	99786	99763	99764	several voices	3423	“ No.34 , give orders to - morrow that the works at Claughton and Hicks stop till further orders . ”
99787	99790	99792	99793	another voice	3422	“ Brethren , ”
99795	99843	99792	99793	another voice	3422	“ I propose the expulsion from this Union , of any member who shall be known to boast of his superior ability , as to either the quantity or quality of work he can do , either in public or private company . Is it your pleasure ? ”
99844	99850	99654	99656	the other voice	3421	“ It is our pleasure . ”
99851	99854	99860	99862	a presiding one	3425	“ Brethren , ”
99864	99916	99860	99862	a presiding one	3425	“ before we proceed to the receipt of the revenue from the different districts of this lodge , there is I am informed a stranger present , who prays to be admitted into our fraternity . Are all robed in the mystic robe ? Are all masked in the secret mask ? ”
99917	99919	99763	99764	several voices	3423	“ All “
99925	100115	100116	100117	Michael Radley	445	” And thereupon after a movement which intimated that all present were kneeling , the presiding voice offered up an extemporary prayer of great power and even eloquence . This was succeeded by the Hymn of Labour , and at its conclusion the arms of the neophyte were unpinioned , and then his eyes were unbandaged . Mick found himself in a lofty and spacious room lighted with many tapers . Its walls were hung with black cloth ; at a table covered with the same material , were seated seven persons in surplices and masked , the president on a loftier seat ; above which on a pedestal was a skeleton complete . On each side of the skeleton was a man robed and masked , holding a drawn sword ; and on each of Mick was a man in the same garb holding a battle - axe . On the table was the sacred volume open , and at a distance , ranged in order on each side of the room , was a row of persons in white robes and white masks , and holding torches . “
100119	100124	100116	100117	Michael Radley	445	” said the President . “
100243	100244	100229	100229	you	445	” “
100250	100256	100245	100245	I	0	” replied a tremulous voice . “
100264	100351	100352	100352	His	398	” Mick slowly rose from his kneeling position , advanced with a trembling step , and bending , embraced with reverence the open volume . Immediately every one unmasked ; Devilsdust came forward , and taking Mick by the hand led him to the President , who received him pronouncing some mystic rhymes . He was covered with a robe and presented with a torch , and then ranged in order with his companions . Thus terminated the initiation of Dandy Mick into a TRADES UNION . “
100363	100454	100352	100353	His lordship	6586	” It was the valet of Lord Milford that spoke , addressing from the door of a house in Belgrave Square , about noon , a deputation from the National Convention , consisting of two of its delegates , who waited on the young viscount in common with other members of the legislature , in order to call his particular attention to the National Petition which the Convention had prepared , and which in the course of the session was to be presented by one of the members for Birmingham . “
100466	100474	100455	100455	I	0	” said one delegate to the other . “
100482	100483	100455	100455	I	0	” “
100530	100531	100525	100528	a widow of quality	3445	” “
100536	101003	100534	100534	knock	3446	” Mr Thorough Base was not at home ; had received the card of the delegates apprising him of the honour of their intended visit , but had made up his mind on the subject . No.18 in the same street received them more courteously . Here resided Mr KREMLIN , who after listening with patience if not with interest , to their statement , apprised them that forms of government were of no consequence , and domestic policy of no interest ; that there was only one subject which should engage the attention of public men , because everything depended on it,—that was our external system ; and that the only specific for a revival of trade and the contentment of the people , was a general settlement of the boundary questions . Finally , Mr Kremlin urged upon the National Convention to recast their petition with this view , assuring them that on foreign policy they would have the public with them . The deputation in reply might have referred as an evidence of the general interest excited by questions of foreign policy , to the impossibility even of a leader making a house on one ; and to the fact that there are not three men in the House of Commons who even pretend to have any acquaintance with the external circumstances of the country ; they might have added , that even in such an assembly Mr Kremlin himself was distinguished for ignorance , for he had only one idea,—and that was wrong . Their next visit was to WRIGGLE , a member for a metropolitan district , a disciple of Progress , who went with the times , but who took particular good care to ascertain their complexion ; and whose movements if expedient could partake of a regressive character . As the Charter might some day turn up trumps as well as so many other unexpected cards and colours , Wriggle gave his adhesion to it , but of course only provisionally ; provided that is to say , he might vote against it at present . But he saw no harm in it — not he , and should be prepared to support it when circumstances , that is to say the temper of the times , would permit him . More could hardly be expected from a gentleman in the delicate position in which Wriggle found himself at this moment , for he had solicited a baronetcy of the whigs , and had secretly pledged himself to Taper to vote against them on the impending Jamaica division . BOMBASTES RIP snubbed them , which was hard , for he had been one of themselves , had written confidential letters in 1831 to the secretary of the Treasury , and “
101010	101455	100534	100534	knock	3446	” offered to come up from the manufacturing town he now represented , at the head of a hundred thousand men , and burn down Apsley House . But now Bombastes Rip talked of the great middle class ; of public order and public credit . He would have said more to them , but had an appointment in the city , being a most active member of the committee for raising a statue to the Duke of Wellington . FLOATWELL received them in the politest manner , though he did not agree with them . What he did agree with was difficult to say . Clever , brisk , and bustling , with an university reputation and without patrimony , Floatwell shrunk from the toils of a profession , and in the hurry skurry of reform found himself to his astonishment a parliament man . There he had remained , but why , the Fates alone knew . The fun of such a thing must have evaporated with the novelty . Floatwell had entered public life in complete ignorance of every subject which could possibly engage the attention of a public man . He knew nothing of history , national or constitutional law , had indeed none but puerile acquirements , and had seen nothing of life . Assiduous at committees he gained those superficial habits of business which are competent to the conduct of ordinary affairs , and picked up in time some of the slang of economical questions . Floatwell began at once with a little success , and he kept his little success ; nobody envied him it ; he hoarded his sixpences without exciting any evil emulation . He was one of those characters who above all things shrink from isolation , and who imagine they are getting on if they are keeping company with some who stick like themselves . He was always an idolater of some great personage who was on the shelf , and who he was convinced , because the great personage assured him of it after dinner , would sooner or later turn out the man . At present , Floatwell swore by Lord Dunderhead ; and the game of this little coterie , who dined together and thought they were a party , was to be courteous to the Convention . After the endurance of an almost interminable lecture on the currency from Mr KITE , who would pledge himself to the charter if the charter would pledge itself to one - pound notes , the two delegates had arrived in Piccadilly , and the next member upon their list was Lord Valentine . “
101461	101468	101469	101469	I	0	” said one of the delegates , “
101475	101773	101469	101469	I	0	” so they knocked at the portal of the court yard , and found they were awaited . A private staircase led to the suite of rooms of Lord Valentine , who lived in the family mansion . The delegates were ushered through an ante - chamber into a saloon which opened into a very fanciful conservatory , where amid tall tropical plants played a fountain . The saloon was hung with blue satin , and adorned with brilliant mirrors : its coved ceiling was richly painted , and its furniture became the rest of its decorations . On one sofa were a number of portfolios , some open , full of drawings of costumes ; a table of pietra dura was covered with richly bound volumes that appeared to have been recently referred to ; several ancient swords of extreme beauty were lying on a couch ; in a corner of the room was a figure in complete armour , black and gold richly inlaid , and grasping in its gauntlet the ancient standard of England . The two delegates of the National Convention stared at each other , as if to express their surprise that a dweller in such an abode should ever have permitted them to enter it ; but ere either of them could venture to speak , Lord Valentine made his appearance . He was a young man , above the middle height , slender , broad - shouldered , small - waisted , of a graceful presence ; he was very fair , with dark blue eyes , bright and intelligent , and features of classic precision ; a small Greek cap crowned his long light - brown hair , and he was enveloped in a morning robe of Indian shawls . “
101778	101813	101776	101776	gentlemen	7251	” said his lordship , as he invited them to be seated , in a clear and cheerful voice , and with an unaffected tone of frankness which put his guests at their ease ; “
101829	101933	101824	101824	you	7251	” The delegates made their accustomed statement ; they wished to pledge no one ; all that the people desired was a respectful discussion of their claims ; the national petition , signed by nearly a million and a half of the flower of the working classes , was shortly to be presented to the House of Commons , praying the House to take into consideration the five points in which the working classes deemed their best interests involved ; to wit , universal suffrage , vote by ballot , annual parliaments , salaried members , and the abolition of the property qualification . “
101941	101946	101949	101949	you	7251	” said Lord Valentine , “
101954	101955	101949	101949	you	7251	” “
101965	101972	101973	101973	they	3450	” replied one of the delegates , “

103701	104561	103698	103699	Thorough Base	610	” They sat down in an antechamber : the servant opened a mahogany folding - door which he shut after him and announced to his master the arrival of the delegates . Egremont was seated in his library , at a round table covered with writing materials , books , and letters . On another table were arranged his parliamentary papers , and piles of blue books . The room was classically furnished . On the mantelpiece were some ancient vases , which he had brought with him from Italy , standing on each side of that picture of Allori of which we have spoken . The servant returned to the ante - room , and announcing to the delegates that his master was ready to receive them , ushered into the presence of Egremont — WALTER GERARD and STEPHEN MORLEY . It is much to be deplored that our sacred buildings are generally closed except at the stated periods of public resort . It is still more to be regretted that when with difficulty entered , there is so much in their arrangements to offend the taste and outrage the feelings . In the tumult of life , a few minutes occasionally passed in the solemn shadow of some lofty and ancient aisle , exercise very often a salutary influence : they purify the heart and elevate the mind ; dispel many haunting fancies , and prevent many an act which otherwise might be repented . The church would in this light still afford us a sanctuary ; not against the power of the law but against the violence of our own will ; not against the passions of man but against our own . The Abbey of Westminster rises amid the strife of factions . Around its consecrated precinct some of the boldest and some of the worst deeds have been achieved or perpetrated : sacrilege , rapine , murder , and treason . Here robbery has been practised on the greatest scale known in modern ages : here ten thousand manors belonging to the order of the Templars , without any proof , scarcely with a pretext , were forfeited in one day and divided among the monarch and his chief nobles ; here the great estate of the church , which , whatever its articles of faith , belonged and still belongs to the people , was seized at various times , under various pretences , by an assembly that continually changed the religion of their country and their own by a parliamentary majority , but which never refunded the booty . Here too was brought forth that monstrous conception which even patrician Rome in its most ruthless period never equalled — the mortgaging of the industry of the country to enrich and to protect property ; an act which is now bringing its retributive consequences in a degraded and alienated population . Here too have the innocent been impeached and hunted to death ; and a virtuous and able monarch martyred , because , among other benefits projected for his people , he was of opinion that it was more for their advantage that the economic service of the state should be supplied by direct taxation levied by an individual known to all , than by indirect taxation , raised by an irresponsible and fluctuating assembly . But thanks to parliamentary patriotism , the people of England were saved from ship - money , which money the wealthy paid , and only got in its stead the customs and excise , which the poor mainly supply . Rightly was King Charles surnamed the Martyr ; for he was the holocaust of direct taxation . Never yet did man lay down his heroic life for so great a cause : the cause of the Church and the cause of the Poor . Even now in the quiet times in which we live , when public robbery is out of fashion and takes the milder title of a commission of inquiry , and when there is no treason except voting against a Minister , who , though he may have changed all the policy which you have been elected to support , expects your vote and confidence all the same ; even in this age of mean passions and petty risks , it is something to step aside from Palace Yard and instead of listening to a dull debate , where the facts are only a repetition of the blue books you have already read , and the fancy an ingenious appeal to the recrimination of Hansard , to enter the old abbey and listen to an anthem ! This was a favourite habit of Egremont , and though the mean discipline and sordid arrangements of the ecclesiastical body to which the guardianship of the beautiful edifice is intrusted , have certainly done all that could injure and impair the holy genius of the place , it still was a habit often full of charm and consolation . There is not perhaps another metropolitan population in the world that would tolerate such conduct as is pursued to “
104568	105194	105195	105196	Mr Franklin	509	” by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster , and submit in silence to be shut out from the only building in the two cities which is worthy of the name of a cathedral . But the British public will bear anything ; they are so busy in speculating in railroad shares . When Egremont had entered on his first visit to the Abbey by the south transept , and beheld the boards and the spikes with which he seemed to be environed as if the Abbey were in a state of siege ; iron gates shutting him out from the solemn nave and the shadowy aisles ; scarcely a glimpse to be caught of a single window ; while on a dirty form , some noisy vergers sate like ticket - porters or babbled like tapsters at their ease,—the visions of abbatial perfection in which he had early and often indulged among the ruins of Marney rose on his outraged sense , and he was then about hastily to retire from the scene he had so long purposed to visit , when suddenly the organ burst forth , a celestial symphony floated in the lofty roof , and voices of plaintive melody blended with the swelling sounds . He was fixed to the spot . Perhaps it was some similar feeling that influenced another individual on the day after the visit of the deputation to Egremont . The sun , though in his summer heaven he had still a long course , had passed his meridian by many hours , the service was performing in the choir , and a few persons entering by the door into that part of the Abbey Church which is so well known by the name of Poet ’s Corner , proceeded through the unseemly stockade which the chapter have erected , and took their seats . One only , a female , declined to pass , notwithstanding the officious admonitions of the vergers that she had better move on , but approaching the iron grating that shut her out from the body of the church , looked wistfully down the long dim perspective of the beautiful southern aisle . And thus motionless she remained in contemplation , or it might be prayer , while the solemn peals of the organ and the sweet voices of the choir enjoyed that holy liberty for which she sighed , and seemed to wander at their will in every sacred recess and consecrated corner . The sounds — those mystical and thrilling sounds that at once elevate the soul and touch the heart — ceased , the chaunting of the service recommenced ; the motionless form moved ; and as she moved Egremont came forth from the choir , and his eye was at once caught by the symmetry of her shape and the picturesque position which she gracefully occupied ; still gazing through that grate , while the light pouring through the western window , suffused the body of the church with a soft radiance , just touching the head of the unknown with a kind of halo . Egremont approached the transept door with a lingering pace , so that the stranger , who he observed was preparing to leave the church , might overtake him . As he reached the door , anxious to assure himself that he was not mistaken , he turned round and his eye at once caught the face of Sybil . He started , he trembled ; she was not two yards distant , she evidently recognised him ; he held open the swinging postern of the Abbey that she might pass , which she did and then stopped on the outside , and said “
105198	105293	105195	105196	Mr Franklin	509	” It was therefore clear that her father had not thought fit , or had not yet had an opportunity , to communicate to Sybil the interview of yesterday . Egremont was still Mr Franklin . This was perplexing . Egremont would like to have been saved the pain and awkwardness of the avowal , yet it must be made , though not with unnecessary crudeness . And so at present he only expressed his delight , the unexpected delight he experienced at their meeting . And then he walked on by her side . “
105296	105300	105195	105196	Mr Franklin	509	” said Sybil , “
105401	105402	105391	105391	their	3546	” “
105413	105417	105403	105403	He	1718	” said Egremont . “
105428	105432	105435	105435	he	1718	” said Sybil . “
105440	105445	105435	105435	he	1718	” she continued earnestly ; “
105484	105488	105468	105468	he	1718	” and her voice faltered—“and
105508	105516	105521	105521	They	3546	” said Sybil , with a sigh , “
105530	105537	105521	105521	They	3546	” she continued , with emotion . “
105613	105715	105608	105608	Gerard	430	” Egremont mused : he must disclose all , yet how embarrassing to enter into such explanations in a public thoroughfare ! Should he bid her after a - while farewell , and then make his confession in writing ? Should he at once accompany her home , and there offer his perplexing explanations ? Or should he acknowledge his interview of yesterday with Gerard , and then leave the rest to the natural consequences of that acknowledgment when Sybil met her father ! Thus pondering , Egremont and Sybil , quitting the court of the Abbey , entered Abingdon Street . “
105723	105738	105608	105608	Gerard	430	” said Egremont , as Sybil seemed to intimate her intention here to separate . “
105745	105749	105739	105740	My father	1718	” said Sybil ; “
105766	105767	105769	105769	he	1718	” “
105775	105790	105769	105769	he	1718	” thought Egremont . And must he quit her in this way . Never ! “
105799	105804	105791	105791	You	3557	” he said aloud . “
105810	105814	105815	105815	We	3561	” said Sybil . “
105865	105872	105861	105861	I	0	” she added with a smile , “
105878	105889	105861	105861	I	0	” And guided by her they turned up College Street . “
105899	105900	105894	105894	you	3557	” “
105929	105930	105931	105931	You	3557	” “
105935	105939	105931	105931	You	3557	” said Egremont . “
105948	105949	105950	105951	Poor Harold	625	” “
105962	105963	105964	105964	I	0	” “
105972	105976	105964	105964	I	0	” said Egremont . “
105981	105985	105964	105964	I	0	” said Sybil , “
106053	106057	106058	106058	Your	3557	” Egremont smiled . “
106070	106074	106058	106058	Your	3557	” he said ; “
106102	106103	106100	106100	factions	1190	” “
106107	106111	106100	106100	factions	1190	” said Sybil . “
106144	106475	106100	106100	factions	1190	” While they thus conversed they passed through several clean , still streets , that had rather the appearance of streets in a very quiet country town than of abodes in the greatest city in the world , and in the vicinity of palaces and parliaments . Rarely was a shop to be remarked among the neat little tenements , many of them built of curious old brick , and all of them raised without any regard to symmetry or proportion . Not the sound of a single wheel was heard ; sometimes not a single individual was visible or stirring . Making a circuitous course through this tranquil and orderly district , they at last found themselves in an open place in the centre of which rose a church of vast proportions , and built of hewn stone in that stately , not to say ponderous , style which Vanburgh introduced . The area round it , which was sufficiently ample , was formed by buildings , generally of a very mean character : the long back premises of a carpenter , the straggling yard of a hackney - man : sometimes a small , narrow isolated private residence , like a waterspout in which a rat might reside : sometimes a group of houses of more pretension . In the extreme corner of this area , which was dignified by the name of Smith ’s Square , instead of taking a more appropriate title from the church of St John which it encircled , was a large old house , that had been masked at the beginning of the century with a modern front of pale - coloured bricks , but which still stood in its courtyard surrounded by its iron railings , withdrawn as it were from the vulgar gaze like an individual who had known higher fortunes , and blending with his humility something of the reserve which is prompted by the memory of vanished greatness . “
106481	106485	106100	106100	factions	1190	” said Sybil . “
106496	106781	106782	106783	Baptist Hatton	627	” Near the house was a narrow passage which was a thoroughfare into the most populous quarter of the neighbourhood . As Egremont was opening the gate of the courtyard , Gerard ascended the steps of this passage and approached them . When Gerard and Morley quitted the Albany after their visit to Egremont , they separated , and Stephen , whom we will accompany , proceeded in the direction of the Temple , in the vicinity of which he himself lodged , and where he was about to visit a brother journalist , who occupied chambers in that famous inn of court . As he passed under Temple Bar his eye caught a portly gentleman stepping out of a public cab with a bundle of papers in his hand , and immediately disappearing through that well - known archway which Morley was on the point of reaching . The gentleman indeed was still in sight , descending the way , when Morley entered , who observed him drop a letter . Morley hailed him , but in vain ; and fearing the stranger might disappear in one of the many inextricable courts , and so lose his letter , he ran forward , picked up the paper , and then pushed on to the person who dropped it , calling out so frequently that the stranger at length began to suspect that he himself might be the object of the salute , and stopped and looked round . Morley almost mechanically glanced at the outside of the letter , the seal of which was broken , and which was however addressed to a name that immediately fixed his interest . The direction was to “
106791	106792	106782	106783	Baptist Hatton	627	” “
106804	106860	106861	106861	Sir	1375	” said Morley , looking very intently upon the person to whom he spoke — a portly man and a comely ; florid , gentleman - like , but with as little of the expression which Morley in imagination had associated with that Hatton over whom he once pondered , as can easily be imagined . “
106870	106876	106863	106863	I	0	” said the strange gentleman ; “
106981	106982	106974	106974	I	0	” “
106990	107004	106974	106974	I	0	” and Morley bowed ; and going in different directions , they separated . “
107019	107039	107040	107044	No lawyer of that name	3596	” inquired Morley of his friend the journalist , when , having transacted their business , the occasion served . “
107053	107058	107049	107049	Hatton	627	” was the reply . “
107077	107078	107074	107075	a provincial	3598	” “
107092	107097	107079	107079	He	627	” said the journalist . “
107137	107138	107139	107139	You	1375	” “
107144	107148	107139	107139	You	1375	” said Morley ; “
107166	107167	107159	107159	yourself	1375	” “
107174	107179	107159	107159	yourself	1375	” said his friend , “
107301	107302	107283	107284	obscure pretenders	3616	” “
107320	107336	107315	107315	you	3620	” inquired Morley , evidently much interested , though he attempted to conceal his emotion . “
107354	107359	107351	107351	I	0	” replied his friend . “
107574	107580	107583	107583	your	3635	” the journalist added laughingly , “
107586	108093	108095	108095	you	3637	” A strong impression was on the mind of Morley that this was his man : he resolved to inquire of Gerard , whom he should see in the evening , as to the fact of their Hatton being a Catholic , and if so , to call on the antiquary on the morrow . In the meantime we must not forget one who is already making that visit . Sir Vavasour Firebrace is seated in a spacious library that looks upon the Thames and the gardens of the Temple . Though piles of parchments and papers cover the numerous tables , and in many parts intrude upon the Turkey carpet , an air of order , of comfort , and of taste , pervades the chamber . The hangings of crimson damask silk blend with the antique furniture of oak ; the upper panes of the windows are tinted by the brilliant pencil of feudal Germany , while the choice volumes that line the shelves are clothed in bindings which become their rare contents . The master of this apartment was a man of ordinary height , inclined to corpulency , and in the wane of middle life , though his unwrinkled cheek , his undimmed blue eye , and his brown hair , very apparent , though he wore a cap of black velvet , did not betray his age , or the midnight studies by which he had in a great degree acquired that learning for which he was celebrated . The general expression of his countenance was pleasing , though dashed with a trait of the sinister . He was seated in an easy chair , before a kidney table at which he was writing . Near at hand was a long tall oaken desk , on which were several folio volumes open , and some manuscripts which denoted that he had recently been engaged with them . At present Mr Hatton , with his pen still in his hand and himself in a chamber - robe of the same material as his cap , leant back in his chair , while he listened to his client , Sir Vavasour . Several most beautiful black and tan spaniels of the breed of King Charles the Second were reposing near him on velvet cushions , with a haughty luxuriousness which would have become the beauties of the merry monarch ; and a white Persian cat with blue eyes and a very long tail , with a visage not altogether unlike that of its master , was resting with great gravity on the writing - table , and assisting at the conference . Sir Vavasour had evidently been delivering himself of a long narrative , to which Mr Hatton had listened with that imperturbable patience which characterised him , and which was unquestionably one of the elements of his success . He never gave up anything , and he never interrupted anybody . And now in a silvery voice he replied to his visitor : “
108320	108321	108313	108314	malignant ones	3650	” “
108324	108329	108313	108314	malignant ones	3650	” said Sir Vavasour . “
108334	108339	108313	108314	malignant ones	3650	” said Mr Hatton , “
108380	108381	108364	108365	the Sovereign	892	” “
108389	108394	108383	108383	you	0	” said Sir Vavasour . “
108402	108407	108395	108395	You	0	” said Mr Hatton ; “
108519	108520	108521	108521	I	0	” “
108529	108538	108521	108521	I	0	” said Sir Vavasour , shaking his head ; “
108599	108600	108601	108601	I	0	” “
108607	108623	108601	108601	I	0	” said Mr Hatton , leaning back in his chair and playing with his seals , “
108668	108669	108670	108670	I	0	” “
108678	108686	108670	108670	I	0	” said Sir Vavasour in a whisper ; “
108715	108729	108730	108731	Sir Robert	375	” Mr Hatton shook his head with a slight smile of contemptuous incredulity . “
108733	108737	108730	108731	Sir Robert	375	” he said , “
108905	109013	109014	109014	You	3681	” It is difficult to express the astonishment , the perplexity , the agitation , that pervaded the countenance of Sir Vavasour while his companion thus coolly delivered himself . High hopes extinguished and excited at the same moment ; cherished promises vanishing , mysterious expectations rising up ; revelations of astounding state secrets ; chief ministers voluntarily renouncing their highest means of influence , and an obscure private individual distributing those distinctions which sovereigns were obliged to hoard , and to obtain which the first men in the country were ready to injure their estates and to sacrifice their honour ! At length Sir Vavasour said , “
109048	109049	109050	109054	Not a man of them	3685	” “
109056	109061	109050	109054	Not a man of them	3685	” said Hatton peremptorily . “
109081	109082	109070	109070	I	0	” “
109109	109110	109104	109104	he	628	” “
109168	109169	109157	109166	any old families among your twenty members of Brookes ’	3695	” “
109176	109181	109171	109171	I	0	” said Sir Vavasour ; “
109192	109193	109188	109190	an old baronet	3697	” “
109218	109223	109215	109215	I	0	” said Mr Hatton . “
109230	109235	109227	109228	Colonel Cockawhoop	630	” said Sir Vavasour . “
109248	109249	109239	109242	a very good family	3700	” “
109295	109296	109290	109290	I	0	” “
109306	109311	109312	109312	Yours	3707	” said Sir Vavasour . “
109314	109334	109312	109312	Yours	3707	” said Mr Hatton , and he threw a full glance on the countenance on which the light rested . “
109344	109349	109338	109342	the first batch of baronets	3709	” said Sir Vavasour . “
109357	109361	109351	109352	the baronets	1402	” said Hatton . “
109374	109375	109370	109372	James the First	383	” “
109383	109388	109376	109376	They	3712	” said Sir Vavasour . “
109412	109413	109406	109406	you	388	” “
109577	109578	109569	109569	I	0	” “
109583	109588	109569	109569	I	0	” said Sir Vavasour , “
109674	109675	109654	109655	Lady Firebrace	365	” “
109687	109692	109654	109655	Lady Firebrace	365	” said Mr Hatton . “
109698	109715	109654	109655	Lady Firebrace	365	” said Sir Vavasour , rising from his chair and speaking as it were to himself . “
109729	109733	109719	109719	you	425	” he inquired . “
109736	109741	109734	109734	Bagatelle	636	” said Mr Hatton . “
109847	109860	109866	109869	a man you know	3726	” and he rose and took up some papers from a table : “
110078	110079	110080	110080	I	0	” “
110087	110092	110084	110085	Mr Hatton	425	” said Sir Vavasour : “
110129	110130	110131	110131	You	425	” “
110136	110141	110142	110142	You	425	” said Mr Hatton . “
110209	110295	110298	110299	my father	1718	” Sir Vavasour winced , but the future was full of glory and the present of excitement ; and he wished Mr Hatton good morning , with a promise that he would himself bring the papers on the morrow . Mr Hatton was buried for a few moments in a reverie , during which he played with the tail of the Persian cat . We left Sybil and Egremont just at the moment that Gerard arrived at the very threshold which they had themselves reached . “
110301	110332	110298	110299	my father	1718	” exclaimed Sybil , and then with a faint blush of which she was perhaps unconscious , she added , as if apprehensive Gerard would not recall his old companion , “
110338	110339	110335	110336	Mr Franklin	509	” “
110351	110455	110335	110336	Mr Franklin	509	” said Gerard embarrassed , while Egremont himself changed colour and was infinitely confused . Sybil felt surprised that her father should have met Mr Franklin and not have mentioned a circumstance naturally interesting to her . Egremont was about to speak when the street - door was opened . And were they to part again , and no explanation ? And was Sybil to be left with her father , who was evidently in no haste , perhaps had no great tendency , to give that explanation ? Every feeling of an ingenuous spirit urged Egremont personally to terminate this prolonged misconception . “
110464	110478	110461	110461	I	0	” he said , appealing as much to Gerard as to his daughter , “
110488	110960	110961	110961	I	0	” It was not possible to resist such a request , yet it was conceded on the part of Gerard with no cordiality . So they entered the large gloomy hail of the house , and towards the end of a long passage Gerard opened a door , and they all went into a spacious melancholy room , situate at the back of the house , and looking upon a small square plot of dank grass , in the midst of which rose a very weather - stained Cupid , with one arm broken , and the other raised in the air with a long shell to its mouth . It seemed that in old days it might have been a fountain . At the end of the plot the blind side of a house offered a high wall which had once been painted in fresco . Though much of the coloured plaster had cracked and peeled away , and all that remained was stained and faded , still some traces of the original design might yet be detected : festive wreaths , the colonnades and perspective of a palace . The wails of the room itself were waincsotted in pannels of dark - stained wood ; the window - curtains were of coarse green worsted , and encrusted with dust so ancient and irremovable , that it presented almost a lava - like appearance ; the carpet that had once been bright and showy , was entirely threadbare , and had become grey with age . There were several heavy mahogany arm - chairs in the room , a Pembroke table , and an immense unwieldy sideboard , garnished with a few wine - glasses of a deep blue colour . Over the lofty uncouth mantel was a portrait of the Marquis of Granby , which might have been a sign , and opposite to him , over the sideboard , was a large tawdry - coloured print , by Bunbury , of Ranelagh in its most festive hour . The general appearance of the room however though dingy , was not squalid : and what with its spaciousness , its extreme repose , and the associations raised by such few images as it did suggest , the impression on the mind of the spectator was far from unpleasing , partaking indeed of that vague melancholy which springs from the contemplation of the past , and which at all times softens the spirit . Gerard walked to the window and looked at the grass - plot ; Sybil seating herself , invited their guest to follow her example ; Egremont , not without agitation , seemed suddenly to make an effort to collect himself , and then , in a voice not distinguished by its accustomed clearness , he said , “
110988	111002	111003	111003	I	0	” Sybil started a little , slightly stared , but did not speak . “
111034	111042	111045	111045	you	3750	” he added in a hesitating voice , “
111051	111087	111088	111088	I	0	” Their eyes met : astonishment was imprinted on the countenance of Sybil , but she uttered not a word ; and her father , whose back was turned to them , did not move . “
111092	111096	111088	111088	I	0	” continued Egremont , “
111364	111414	111415	111416	My father	1718	” His tones of passionate emotion ceased . Sybil , with a countenance beautiful and disturbed , gazed at him for an instant , and seemed about to speak , but her trembling lips refused the office ; then with an effort , turning to Gerard , she said , “
111435	111436	111429	111433	this gentleman who addresses me	3763	” “
111445	111453	111443	111443	Sybil	430	” said Gerard , turning to her . “
111460	111471	111454	111458	The brother of Lord Marney	2524	” repeated Sybil , with an air almost of stupor . “
111474	111478	111479	111485	a member of that family of sacrilege	3766	” said Egremont : “
111505	111573	111574	111574	I	0	” The elbow of Sybil rested on the arm of her chair , and her cheek upon her hand ; as Egremont said these words she shaded her face , which was thus entirely unseen : for some moments there was silence . Then looking up with an expression grave but serene , and as if she had just emerged from some deep thinking , Sybil said , “
111608	111609	111600	111601	my father	1718	” “
111617	111627	111600	111601	my father	1718	” said Egremont mournfully , and yet with tenderness . “
111635	111636	111600	111601	my father	1718	” “
111641	111647	111600	111601	my father	1718	” said Sybil , haughtily ; “
111662	111682	111600	111601	my father	1718	” she added , slightly but with singular grace waving her hands , and somewhat turning away her head , “
111686	111877	111880	111881	Mr Hatton	425	” There are tumults of the mind when like the great convulsions of nature all seems anarchy and returning chaos , yet often in those moments of vast disturbance , as in the material strife itself , some new principle of order , or some new impulse of conduct , develops itself , and controls and regulates and brings to an harmonious consequence , passions and elements which seemed only to threaten despair and subversion . So it was with Egremont . He looked for a moment in despair upon this maiden walled out from sympathy by prejudices and convictions more impassable than all the mere consequences of class . He looked for a moment , but only for a moment , in despair . He found in his tortured spirit energies that responded to the exigency of the occasion . Even the otherwise embarrassing presence of Gerard would not have prevented — but just at this moment the door opened , and Morley and another person entered the room . Morley paused as he recognised Egremont ; then advancing to Gerard , followed by his companion , he said , “
111901	111902	111880	111881	Mr Hatton	425	” “
111914	111931	111932	111932	He	3777	” said Hatton , scanning Gerard with his clear blue eye , and then he added , “
111953	111954	111955	111955	One	6021	” “
111959	111963	111955	111955	One	6021	” said Gerard : “
111994	112013	111991	111992	Baptist Hatton	627	” said Gerard , examining his guest with almost as complete a scrutiny as he had himself experienced . “
112030	112031	112022	112022	I	0	” “
112037	112045	112022	112022	I	0	” said Hatton in a silvery voice , “
112076	112240	112069	112069	I	0	” and as he was speaking these words , he turned and addressed them to Sybil . She beheld him with no little interest ; this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears , and was associated with so many strange and high hopes , and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts . Hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies in which Sybil had sometime indulged with regard to him . That appearance was prepossessing : a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance : his once rich brown hair , still long though very thin , was so arranged as naturally to conceal his baldness ; he was dressed with great simplicity , but with remarkable taste and care : nor did the repose and suavity of his manner and the hushed tone of his voice detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced . “
112246	112253	112069	112069	I	0	” said Sybil with a smile , “
112261	112262	112258	112259	the people	914	” “
112269	112287	112258	112259	the people	914	” said Hatton bowing , well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate . “
112296	112300	112290	112290	your	0	” said Sybil . “
112340	112341	112342	112342	I	0	” “
112357	112452	112346	112346	I	0	” said Hatton ; and then addressing himself again to Gerard , he led him to a distant part of the room where they were soon engaged in earnest converse . Morley at the same moment approached Sybil , and spoke to her in a subdued tone . Egremont feeling embarrassed advanced , and bade her farewell . She rose and returned his salute with some ceremony ; then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance , she held forth her hand , which he retained for a moment , and withdrew . “
112462	112466	112453	112453	I	0	” continued Morley . “
112715	112716	112717	112717	You	3786	” “
112729	112739	112725	112725	you	3786	” said Sybil with a musing and abstracted air ; “
112753	112777	112751	112751	you	3786	” He threw a glance at her : and immediately withdrew it . Their eyes had met : hers were kind and calm . “
112782	112796	112751	112751	you	3786	” said Morley rather hurriedly and abruptly , and looking on the ground , “
112830	112831	112833	112833	you	3786	” “
112837	112841	112833	112833	you	3786	” said Sybil . “
112931	112932	112933	112933	You	3786	” “
112937	112947	112933	112933	You	3786	” said Morley , looking at her rather keenly . “
112961	112962	112963	112963	I	0	” “
112983	112987	112988	112988	He	3802	” said Sybil . “
113037	113038	113018	113018	he	3802	” “
113050	113054	113060	113060	his	3805	” said Morley , “
113099	113111	113094	113095	the factions	3809	” Sybil turned and looked at him , and then said , “
113182	113183	113204	113208	popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits	3812	” “
113192	113196	113204	113208	popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits	3812	” said Morley , “
113294	113295	113246	113250	a man of the closet	3815	” “
113302	113314	113246	113250	a man of the closet	3815	” said Sybil . Morley shrugged his shoulders , and then said “
113420	113421	113430	113430	he	1718	” “
113438	113442	113430	113430	he	1718	” said Sybil . “
113541	113619	113526	113539	a race of forefathers who belonged to the oppressed and not to the oppressors	3824	” Morley watched the deep splendour of her eye and the mantling of her radiant cheek , as she spoke these latter words with not merely animation but fervour . Her bright hair , that hung on either side her face in long tresses of luxuriant richness , was drawn off a forehead that was the very throne of thought and majesty , while her rich lip still quivered with the sensibility which expressed its impassioned truth . “
113629	113635	113526	113539	a race of forefathers who belonged to the oppressed and not to the oppressors	3824	” at length Morley replied ; “
113677	113678	113679	113679	My	0	” “
113684	113688	113679	113679	My	0	” said Sybil . “
113719	113720	113713	113717	one and the same object	3833	” “
113724	113728	113713	113717	one and the same object	3833	” said Morley ; “
113742	113743	113744	113744	You	430	” “
113748	113752	113744	113744	You	430	” said Sybil . “
113791	113792	113793	113793	They	3837	” “
113803	113807	113793	113793	They	3837	” said Morley . “
113834	113929	113930	113930	You	3839	” At this moment Gerard and Hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward ; and this movement interrupted the conversation of Sybil and Morley . Before however her father and his new friend could reach them , Hatton as if some point on which he had not been sufficiently explicit , had occurred to him , stopped and placing his hand on Gerard ’s arm , withdrew him again , saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed . “
114141	114142	114137	114139	the Lady Sybil	430	” “
114156	114196	114150	114150	sir	1375	” said a waiter at the Athenaeum to a member of the club who seemed unmindful of the type of appropriation which in the shape of an inverted plate , ought to have warned him off the coveted premises . “
114202	114207	114150	114150	sir	1375	” grumbled the member . “
114213	114214	114215	114216	Mr Hatton	425	” “
114220	114758	114215	114216	Mr Hatton	425	” And indeed at this very moment , it being about eight o’clock of the same day on which the meeting detailed in the last chapter had occurred , a very handsome dark brougham with a beautiful horse was stopping in Waterloo Place before the portico of the Athenaeum Club - house , from which equipage immediately emerged the prosperous person of Baptist Hatton . This club was Hatton ’s only relaxation . He had never entered society ; and now his habits were so formed , the effort would have been a painful one ; though with a first - rate reputation in his calling and supposed to be rich , the openings were numerous to a familiar intercourse with those middle - aged nameless gentlemen of easy circumstances who haunt clubs , and dine a great deal at each others ’ houses and chambers ; men who travel regularly a little , and gossip regularly a great deal ; who lead a sort of facile , slipshod existence , doing nothing , yet mightily interested in what others do ; great critics of little things ; profuse in minor luxuries and inclined to the respectable practice of a decorous profligacy ; peering through the window of a clubhouse as if they were discovering a planet ; and usually much excited about things with which they have no concern , and personages who never heard of them . All this was not in Hatton ’s way , who was free from all pretension , and who had acquired , from his severe habits of historical research , a respect only for what was authentic . These nonentities flitted about him , and he shrunk from an existence that seemed to him at once dull and trifling . He had a few literary acquaintances that he had made at the Antiquarian Society , of which he was a distinguished member ; a vice - president of that body had introduced him to the Athenaeum . It was the first and only club that Hatton had ever belonged to , and he delighted in it . He liked splendour and the light and bustle of a great establishment . They saved him from that melancholy which after a day of action is the doom of energetic celibacy . A luxurious dinner without trouble , suited him after his exhaustion ; sipping his claret , he revolved his plans . Above all , he revelled in the magnificent library , and perhaps was never happier , than when after a stimulating repast he adjourned up stairs , and buried himself in an easy chair with Dugdale or Selden , or an erudite treatise on forfeiture or abeyance . To - day however Hatton was not in this mood . He came in exhausted and excited ; eat rapidly and rather ravenously ; despatched a pint of champagne ; and then called for a bottle of Lafitte . His table cleared ; a devilled biscuit placed before him , a cool bottle and a fresh glass , he indulged in that reverie , which the tumult of his feelings and the physical requirements of existence had hitherto combined to prevent . “
114763	114788	114215	114216	Mr Hatton	425	” he thought , as with an abstracted air he filled his glass , and sipping the wine , leant back in his chair . “
114815	114955	114813	114813	mine	0	“ Those infernal papers ! They made my fortune — and yet , I know not how it is , the deed has cost me many a pang . Yet it seemed innoxious ! the old man dead — insolvent ; myself starving ; his son ignorant of all , to whom too they could be of no use , for it required thousands to work them , and even with thousands they could only be worked by myself . Had I not done it , I should ere this probably have been swept from the surface of the earth , worn out with penury , disease , and heart - ache . And now I am Baptist Hatton with a fortune almost large enough to buy Mowbray itself , and with knowledge that can make the proudest tremble . “
115008	115025	115002	115002	I	0	“ Ah ! had I a child — a child like the beautiful daughter of Gerard ! ”
115041	115098	115028	115029	mechanically Hatton	425	“ And I have deprived her of a principality ! That seraphic being whose lustre even now haunts my vision ; the ring of whose silver tone even now lingers in my ear . He must be a fiend who could injure her . I am that fiend . Let me see — let me see ! ”
115140	115196	115129	115129	he	425	“ Let me see — let me see . I could make her a baroness . Gerard is as much Baron Valence as Shrewsbury is a Talbot . Her name is Sybil . Curious how , even when peasants , the good blood keeps the good old family names ! The Valences were ever Sybils . “
115238	115281	115287	115289	A chartist delegate	9213	“ Could I do more ? Could I restore her to the rank she would honour , assuage these sharp pangs of conscience , and achieve the secret ambition of my life ? What if my son were to be Lord Valence ? “
115331	115418	115329	115329	Richard	620	“ I could proffer much : I feel I could urge it plausibly . She must be very wretched . With such a form , such high imaginings , such thoughts of power and pomp as I could breathe in her,—I think she ’d melt . And to one of her own faith , too ! To build up a great Catholic house again ; of the old blood , and the old names , and the old faith,—by holy Mary it is a glorious vision ! ”
115565	115578	115580	115581	Lady Deloraine	581	“ We come to you as early as possible my dear Arabella , ”
115590	115611	115580	115581	Lady Deloraine	581	“ You are always so good ! Have you seen Charles ? I was in hopes he would have come , ”
115621	115638	115640	115641	Lady Deloraine	581	“ He is at the House : otherwise I am sure he would have been here , ”
115666	115707	115640	115641	Lady Deloraine	581	“ I fear you will be sadly in want of beaus this evening , my love . We dined at the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine ’s , and all our cavaliers vanished . They talk of an early division . ”
115708	115718	115720	115721	Lady Marney	3878	“ I really wish all these divisions were over , ”
115723	115739	115720	115721	Lady Marney	3878	“ They are very anti - social . Ah ! here is Lady de Mowbray . ”
115911	115914	115908	115908	she	365	“ dear child ”
115916	115920	115908	115908	she	365	“ sweetest love , ”
115941	115946	115948	115950	Lady St Julians	365	“ My sweet child ! ”
115955	115985	115948	115950	Lady St Julians	365	“ you have no idea how unhappy Frederick is this evening , but he can not leave the House , and I fear it will be a late affair . ”
116011	116046	116008	116008	she	403	“ I do not think the division so important as is generally imagined . A defeat upon a question of colonial government does not appear to me of sufficient weight to dissolve a cabinet . ”
116047	116055	116057	116059	Lady St Julians	365	“ Any defeat will do that now , ”
116061	116180	116057	116059	Lady St Julians	365	“ but to tell you the truth I am not very sanguine . Lady Deloraine says they will be beat : she says the radicals will desert them ; but I am not so sure . Why should the radicals desert them ? And what have we done for the radicals ? Had we indeed foreseen this Jamaica business , and asked some of them to dinner , or given a ball or two to their wives and daughters ! I am sure if I had had the least idea that we had so good a chance of coming in , I should not have cared myself to have done something ; even to have invited their women . ”
116181	116194	116199	116201	Fitz - Aquitaine	500	“ But you are such a capital partisan , Lady St Julians , ”
116239	116246	116248	116250	Lady St Julians	365	“ I have made great sacrifices , ”
116252	116363	116248	116250	Lady St Julians	365	“ I went once and stayed a week at Lady Jenny Spinner ’s to gain her looby of a son and his eighty thousand a - year , and Lord St Julians proposed him at White ’s ; and then after all the whigs made him a peer ! They certainly make more of their social influences than we do . That affair of that Mr Trenchard was a blow . Losing a vote at such a critical time , when if I had had only a remote idea of what was passing through his mind , I would have even asked him to Barrowley for a couple of days . ”
116385	116392	116394	116395	the diplomatist	3888	“ But is the pear ripe ? ”
116397	116410	116412	116413	Lord Marney	402	“ The pear is ripe if we have courage to pluck it , ”
116415	116423	116412	116413	Lord Marney	402	“ but our fellows have no pluck . ”
116424	116435	116438	116439	the diplomatist	3888	“ But do you think that the Duke of Wellington — ”
116464	116469	116471	116472	Lord Marney	402	“ Here he is , ”
116474	116482	116471	116472	Lord Marney	402	“ he will answer the question himself . ”
116496	116505	116491	116492	the diplomatist	3888	“ You have not been to the Chamber ? ”
116506	116509	116511	116512	Lord Deloraine	593	“ No , ”
116514	116528	116511	116512	Lord Deloraine	593	“ but I hear there is hot work . It will be late . ”
116529	116535	116537	116538	the diplomatist	3888	“ Do you think — , ”
116551	116565	116567	116568	Lord Deloraine	593	“ I think that in the long run everything will have an end , ”
116570	116573	116575	116576	the diplomatist	3888	“ Ah ! ”
116578	116581	116583	116584	Lord Deloraine	593	“ Bah ! ”
116593	116633	116586	116586	he	593	“ I remember that fellow — a sort of equivocal attache at Paris , when we were there with Monmouth at the peace : and now he is a quasi ambassador , and ribboned and starred to the chin . ”
116634	116642	116644	116645	Mr Ormsby	574	“ The only stars I have got , ”
116648	116656	116644	116645	Mr Ormsby	574	“ are four stars in India stock . ”
116763	116771	116759	116760	Lady Maud	404	“ it was in such good taste ! ”
116790	116795	116797	116798	Lady Marney	3901	“ Do you think , ”
116800	116810	116797	116798	Lady Marney	3901	“ that Mr Mountchesney will bear away the prize ? ”
116817	116837	116814	116814	his	593	“ These great heiresses can never make up their minds . The bitter drop rises in all their reveries . ”
116838	116842	116844	116845	Lady Marney	3902	“ And yet , ”
116847	116862	116844	116845	Lady Marney	3902	“ I would just as soon be married for my money as my face . ”
117125	117128	117117	117117	she	581	“ the Duke ”
117167	117178	117180	117182	Sir Vavasour Firebrace	388	“ They will hardly go out without making some peers , ”
117187	117194	117180	117182	Sir Vavasour Firebrace	388	“ Why they have made enough . ”
117195	117226	117180	117182	Sir Vavasour Firebrace	388	“ Hem ! I know Tubbe Swete has a promise , and so has Cockawhoop . I do n’t think Cockawhoop could show again at Boodle ’s without a coronet . ”
117227	117239	117241	117242	Mr Ormsby	574	“ I do n’t see why these fellows should go out , ”
117244	117353	117241	117242	Mr Ormsby	574	“ What does it signify whether ministers have a majority of five , or ten or twenty ? In my time , a proper majority was a third of the House . That was Lord Liverpool ’s majority . Lord Monmouth used to say that there were ten families in this country who , if they could only agree , could always share the government . Ah ! those were the good old times ! We never had adjourned debates then ; but sate it out like gentlemen who had been used all their lives to be up all night , and then supped at Watier ’s afterwards . ”
117354	117361	117363	117364	Mr Berners	272	“ Ah ! my dear Ormsby , ”
117366	117379	117363	117364	Mr Berners	272	“ do not mention Watier ’s ; you make my mouth water . ”
117380	117395	117397	117400	Lord Fitz - Heron	573	“ Shall you stand for Birmingham , Ormsby , if there be a dissolution ? ”
117402	117408	117410	117411	Mr Ormsby	574	“ I have been asked , ”
117413	117458	117410	117411	Mr Ormsby	574	“ but the House of Commons is not the House of Commons of my time , and I have no wish to re - enter it . If I had a taste for business , I might be a member of the Marylebone vestry . ”
117459	117464	117466	117467	Lord Marney	402	“ All I repeat , ”
117489	117577	117473	117473	he	3918	“ that if there be any idea that I wish Lady Marney should be a lady in waiting , it is an error , Lady Deloraine . I wish that to be understood . I am a domestic man , and I wish Lady Marney to be always with me ; and what I want I want for myself . I hope in arranging the household the domestic character of every member of it will be considered . After all that has occurred the country expects that . ”
117578	117591	117707	117708	Lady Deloraine	581	“ But my dear George , I think it is really premature — ”
117592	117678	117689	117690	Lady Deloraine	581	“ I dare say it is ; but I recommend you , my dear mother , to be alive . I heard Lady St Julians just now in the supper room asking the Duke to promise her that her Augustus should be a Lord of the Admiralty . She said the Treasury would not do , as there was no house , and that with such a fortune as his wife brought him he could not hire a house under a thousand a - year . ”
117679	117687	117689	117690	Lady Deloraine	581	“ He will not have the Admiralty , ”
117692	117700	117689	117690	Lady Deloraine	581	“ She looks herself to the Robes . ”
117701	117705	117707	117708	Lady Deloraine	581	“ Poor woman ! ”
117710	117716	117718	117721	a great whig dame	3920	“ Is it quite true ? ”
117732	117735	117736	117736	he	569	“ Quite , ”
117739	117753	117755	117757	the whig dame	3923	“ I can endure anything except Lady St Julian ’s glance of triumph , ”
117759	117783	117755	117757	the whig dame	3923	“ I really think if it were only to ease her Majesty from such an infliction , they ought to have held on . ”
117784	117792	117794	117795	Mr Egerton	569	“ And must the household be changed ? ”
117797	117804	117806	117808	the whig dame	3923	“ Do not look so serious , ”
117813	117821	117806	117808	the whig dame	3923	“ we are surrounded by the enemy . ”
117822	117833	117835	117836	Mr Egerton	569	“ Will you be at home to - morrow early ? ”
117838	117845	117835	117836	Mr Egerton	569	“ As early as you please . ”
117846	117864	117806	117808	the whig dame	3923	“ Very well , we will talk then . Lady Charlotte has heard something ; nous verrons . ”
117865	117882	117806	117808	the whig dame	3923	“ Courage ; we have the Court with us , and the Country cares for nothing . ”
117883	117889	117891	117892	Mr Tadpole	363	“ It is all right , ”
117894	117929	117891	117892	Mr Tadpole	363	“ They are out . Lord Melbourne has been with the Queen and recommended her Majesty to send for the Duke , and the Duke has recommended her Majesty to send for Sir Robert . ”
117930	117935	117937	117938	Mr Taper	370	“ Are you sure ? ”
117940	117966	117937	117938	Mr Taper	370	“ I tell you Sir Robert is on his road to the palace at this moment ; I saw him pass , full - dressed . ”
117967	117973	117975	117976	Mr Taper	370	“ It is too much , ”
117978	117986	117988	117989	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Now what are we to do ? ”
117991	117997	117999	118000	Mr Taper	370	“ We must not dissolve , ”
118002	118008	117999	118000	Mr Taper	370	“ We have no cry . ”
118009	118018	118020	118021	Mr Tadpole	363	“ As much cry as the other fellows , ”
118023	118118	118020	118021	Mr Tadpole	363	“ but no one of course would think of dissolution before the next registration . No , no ; this is a very manageable Parliament , depend upon it . The malcontent radicals who have turned them out are not going to bring them in . That makes us equal . Then we have an important section to work upon — the Sneaks , the men who are afraid of a dissolution . I will be bound we make a good working conservative majority of five - and - twenty out of the sneaks . ”
118119	118125	118127	118128	Mr Taper	370	“ With the Treasury patronage , ”
118130	118157	118127	118128	Mr Taper	370	“ fear and favour combined . An impending dissolution , and all the places we refuse our own men , we may count on the Sneaks . ”
118158	118177	118179	118180	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Then there are several religious men who have wanted an excuse for a long time to rat , ”
118182	118209	118179	118180	Mr Tadpole	363	“ We must get Sir Robert to make some kind of a religious move , and that will secure Sir Litany Lax and young Mr Salem . ”
118210	118222	118224	118225	Mr Taper	370	“ It will never do to throw over the Church Commission , ”
118227	118237	118224	118225	Mr Taper	370	“ Commissions and committees ought always to be supported . ”
118238	118246	118248	118249	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Besides it will frighten the saints , ”
118251	118274	118248	118249	Mr Tadpole	363	“ If we could get him to speak at Exeter Hall — were it only a slavery meeting — that would do . ”
118275	118280	118282	118282	Taper	370	“ It is difficult , ”
118284	118348	118282	118282	Taper	370	“ he must be pledged to nothing — not even to the right of search . Yet if we could get up something with a good deal of sentiment and no principle involved ; referring only to the past , but with his practised powers touching the present . What do you think of a monument to Wilberforce or a commemoration of Clarkson ? ”
118349	118358	118360	118361	Mr Tadpole	363	“ There is a good deal in that , ”
118363	118437	118439	118440	Mr Tadpole	363	“ At present go about and keep our fellows in good humour . Whisper nothings that sound like something . But be discreet ; do not let there be more than half a hundred fellows who believe they are going to be Under Secretaries of State . And be cautious about titles . If they push you , give a wink and press your finger to your lip . I must call here , ”
118455	118571	118448	118453	the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine	500	“ This gentleman is my particular charge . I have been cooking him these three years . I had two notes from him yesterday , and can delay a visit no longer . The worst of it is , he expects that I shall bear him the non - official announcement of his being sent to Ireland , of which he has about as much chance as I have of being Governor - General of India . It must be confessed ours is critical work sometimes , friend Taper ; but never mind — what we have to do to individuals Peel has to with a nation , and therefore we ought not to complain . ”
118691	118698	118700	118701	Lord Marney	402	“ You may depend upon it , ”
118703	118970	118700	118701	Lord Marney	402	“ that nothing is to be done by delicacy . It is not delicacy that rules the House of Lords . What has kept us silent for years ? Threats ; and threats used in the most downright manner . We were told that if we did not conform absolutely and without appeal to the will and pleasure of one individual , the cards would be thrown up . We gave in ; the game has been played , and won . I am not at all clear that it has been won by those tactics — but gained it is ; and now what shall we do ? In my opinion it is high time to get rid of the dictatorship . The new ruse now for the palace is to persuade her Majesty that Peel is the only man who can manage the House of Lords . Well , then it is exactly the time to make certain persons understand that the House of Lords are not going to be tools any longer merely for other people . Rely upon it a bold united front at this moment would be a spoke in the wheel . We three form the nucleus ; there are plenty to gather round . I have written to Marisforde ; he is quite ripe . Lord Hounslow will be here to - morrow . The thing is to be done ; and if we are not firm the grand conservative triumph will only end in securing the best posts both at home and abroad for one too powerful family . ”
118971	118985	118987	118988	the duke	1216	“ Who had never been heard of in the time of my father , ”
118990	118998	119000	119002	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Nor in the time of mine , ”
119004	119012	119014	119015	Lord Marney	402	“ Royal and Norman blood like ours , ”
119017	119028	119014	119015	Lord Marney	402	“ is not to be thrown over in that way . ”
119049	119069	119036	119037	a servant	1292	“ It is Tadpole ; shall we have him in ? I dare say he will tell us something . ”
119106	119121	119123	119124	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Lord Marney and Lord de Mowbray with the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine , ”
119149	119164	119127	119127	he	363	“ This looks like business and perhaps means mischief . Very lucky I called ! ”
119174	119183	119185	119186	the duke	1216	“ What news from the palace , Tadpole ? ”
119188	119194	119196	119196	Tadpole	363	“ Sir Robert is there , ”
119198	119204	119206	119207	his grace	1233	“ That ’s good news , ”
119360	119412	119329	119329	Tadpole	363	“ I do n’t pretend to be behind the scenes , duke ; but it was said to me to - day , ‘ Tadpole , if you do chance to see the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine you may say that positively Lord Killcroppy will not go to Ireland . ’ ”
119523	119531	119533	119533	Tadpole	363	“ You have heard of Lord Ribbonville ? ”
119539	119544	119533	119533	Tadpole	363	“ No ; what ? ”
119545	119565	119566	119566	Tadpole	363	“ Ca n’t live the day out . How fortunate Sir Robert is ! Two garters to begin with ! ”
119587	119601	119603	119605	the honest gentleman	3951	“ I do n’t pretend to be behind the scenes , my Lord , ”
119623	119662	119603	119605	the honest gentleman	3951	“ but it was said to me to - day , ‘ Tadpole , if you do chance to meet Lord Marney , you may say that positively Lord Rambrooke will not have the Buck - hounds . ’ ”
119663	119668	119670	119671	Lord Marney	402	“ All I want , ”
119673	119729	119670	119671	Lord Marney	402	“ is to see men of character about her Majesty . This is a domestic country , and the country expects that no nobleman should take household office whose private character is not inexpugnable . Now that fellow Rambrooke keeps a French woman . It is not much known , but it is a fact . ”
119730	119733	119735	119736	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Dreadful ! ”
119738	119827	119735	119736	Mr Tadpole	363	“ I have no doubt of it . But he has no chance of the Buck - hounds , you may rely on that . Private character is to be the basis of the new government . Since the Reform Act that is a qualification much more esteemed by the constituency than public services . We must go with the times , my Lord . A virtuous middle class shrink with horror from French actresses ; and the Wesleyans — the Wesleyans must be considered , Lord Marney . ”
119828	119835	119837	119838	his Lordship	6586	“ I always subscribe to them , ”
119840	119843	119845	119846	Mr Tadpole	363	“ Ah ! ”
119849	119884	119885	119885	he	363	“ I am glad to hear that . Nothing I have heard to - day has given me so much pleasure as those few words . One may hardly jest on such a subject , ”
119892	119898	119900	119900	he	3953	“ but I think I may say”—and
119905	119920	119925	119926	honest Tadpole	363	smile—“I think I may say that those subscriptions will not be without their fruit . ”
119938	119968	119931	119931	himself	363	“ If you were ready to be conspirators when I entered the room , my Lords , you were at least prepared to be traitors when I quitted it . ”
119985	120000	119972	119973	Lord Marney	402	“ You are going to White ’s are you ? If so take me . ”
120001	120036	119972	119973	Lord Marney	402	“ I am sorry , my dear Lord , but I have an appointment in the city . I have got to go to the Temple , and I am already behind my time . ”
120652	120656	120658	120659	Mr Hatton	425	“ Very remarkable ! ”
120661	120666	120658	120659	Mr Hatton	425	“ Is it not ! ”
120672	120680	120658	120659	Mr Hatton	425	“ And your Lordship received this yesterday ? ”
120681	120693	120701	120702	Mr Hatton	425	“ Yesterday . I lost no time in communicating with you . ”
120694	120699	120701	120702	Mr Hatton	425	“ Jubb and Jinks , ”
120713	120719	120701	120702	Mr Hatton	425	“ A very respectable firm . ”
120720	120727	120729	120730	his Lordship	6586	“ That makes it more strange , ”
120732	120736	120738	120739	Mr Hatton	425	“ It does , ”
120741	120758	120760	120762	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ A respectable firm would hardly embark in such a proceeding without some show of pretext , ”
120764	120767	120769	120770	Mr Hatton	425	“ Hardly , ”
120772	120779	120769	120770	Mr Hatton	425	“ But what can they have ? ”
120784	120788	120790	120791	Mr Hatton	425	“ What indeed ! ”
120793	120822	120790	120791	Mr Hatton	425	“ Mr Walter Gerard without his pedigree is a mere flash in the pan ; and I defy him to prove anything without the deed of ‘ 77 . ”
120823	120832	120834	120836	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Well , he has not got that , ”
120838	120844	120846	120847	Mr Hatton	425	“ Safe , of course ? ”
120849	120868	120846	120847	Mr Hatton	425	“ Certain . I almost wish I had burnt it as well as the whole box - full . ”
120869	120889	120891	120892	Mr Hatton	425	“ Destroy that deed and the other muniments , and the Earl de Mowbray will never be Baron Valence , ”
120894	120903	120905	120906	his lordship	6586	“ But what use are these deeds now ? ”
120908	120925	120905	120906	his lordship	6586	“ If we produce them , we may give a colour to this fellow ’s claim . ”
120926	120933	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Time will settle his claim , ”
120938	120948	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ it will mature yours . You can wait . ”
120949	120960	120846	120847	Mr Hatton	425	“ Alas ! since the death of my poor boy — ”
120961	121051	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ It has become doubly important . Substantiate the barony , it will descend to your eldest daughter , who , even if married , will retain your name . Your family will live , and ennobled . The Fitz - Warenes Lords Valence will yield to none in antiquity ; and as to rank , as long as Mowbray Castle belongs to them , the revival of the earldom is safe at the first coronation , or the first ministry that exists with a balanced state of parties . ”
121052	121062	121064	121066	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ That is the right view of the case , ”
121068	121075	121064	121066	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ and what do you advise ? ”
121076	121115	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Be calm , and you have nothing to fear . This is the mere revival of an old claim , too vast to be allowed to lapse from desuetude . Your documents you say are all secure ? ”
121116	121153	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Be sure of that . They are at this moment in the muniment room of the great tower of Mowbray Castle ; in the same iron box and in the same cabinet they were deposited — ”
121154	121164	121166	121167	Mr Hatton	425	“ When , by placing them in your hands , ”
121177	121251	121166	121167	Mr Hatton	425	“ I had the extreme satisfaction of confirming the rights and calming the anxieties of one of our ancient houses . I would recommend your lordship to instruct your lawyers to appear to this writ as a matter of course . But enter into no details , no unnecessary confidence with them . They are needless . Treat the matter lightly , especially to them . You will hear no more of it . ”
121252	121257	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ You feel confidence ? ”
121258	121319	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Perfect . Walter Gerard has no documents of any kind . Whatever his claim might be , good or bad , the only evidence that can prove his pedigree is in your possession and the only use to which it ever will be put , will be in due time to seat your grandson in the House of Lords . ”
121320	121329	121331	121332	Lord Mowbray	402	“ I am glad I called upon you , ”
121334	121378	121331	121332	Lord Mowbray	402	“ To be sure . Your lordship can speak to me without reserve , and I am used to these start - ups . It is part of the trade ; but an old soldier is not to be deceived by such feints . ”
121379	121387	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Clearly a feint , you think ? ”
121388	121395	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ A feint ! a feint . ”
121396	121415	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Good morning . I am glad I have called . How goes on my friend Sir Vavasour ? ”
121416	121426	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Oh ! I shall land him at last . ”
121427	121471	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Well , he is an excellent , neighbourly , man . I have a great respect for Sir Vavasour . Would you dine with me , Mr Hatton , on Thursday ? It would give me and Lady de Mowbray great pleasure . ”
121472	121479	121481	121482	Mr Hatton	425	“ Your lordship is extremely kind , ”
121490	121497	121481	121482	Mr Hatton	425	“ but I am an hermit . ”
121498	121507	121509	121511	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ But your friends should see you sometimes , ”
121513	121545	121509	121511	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Your lordship is too good , but I am a mere man of business and know my position . I feel I am not at home in ladies ’ society . ”
121546	121611	120935	120936	Mr Hatton	425	“ Well then come to - morrow : I am alone , and I will ask some persons to meet you whom you know and like,—Sir Vavasour and Lord Shaftesbury and a most learned Frenchman who is over here — a Vicomte de Narbonne , who is very anxious to make your acquaintance . Your name is current I can tell you at Paris . ”
121612	121632	121509	121511	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Your lordship is too good ; another day : I have a great pressure of affairs at present . ”
121633	121648	121509	121511	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Well , well ; so be it . Good morning , Mr Hatton . ”
121667	121703	121664	121664	he	425	“ In the same box and in the same cabinet : the muniment room in the great tower of Mowbray Castle ! They exist and I know their whereabouts . I ’ll have ‘ em . ”
122127	122132	122134	122135	Mr Egerton	569	“ It is true , ”
122143	122148	122150	122154	Mr Jermyn of Lord Valentine	478	“ Is it true ? ”
122159	122169	122171	122172	Mr Ormsby	574	“ I heard it last night at Crockford ’s , ”
122174	122190	122171	122172	Mr Ormsby	574	“ one always hears things there four - and - twenty hours before other places . ”
122207	122212	122150	122154	Mr Jermyn of Lord Valentine	478	“ Is it true ? ”
122262	122265	122150	122154	Mr Jermyn of Lord Valentine	478	“ hitch . ”

122918	122930	122911	122916	the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine	2437	“ He should have remembered how much he owed to Ireland . ”
122931	122939	122941	122943	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ Peel ought to have taken office , ”
122945	122956	122941	122943	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ The garter will become now a mere party badge . ”
124651	124657	124658	124658	he	264	“ I am an intruder , ”
124662	124672	124658	124658	he	264	“ but I wish much to speak to you , ”
124686	124695	124697	124697	Egremont	264	“ You seemed to treat with scorn yesterday , ”
124703	124729	124730	124730	He	264	“ the belief that sympathy was independent of the mere accidents of position . Pardon me , Sybil , but even you may be prejudiced . ”
124733	124746	124748	124748	Sybil	430	“ I should be sorry to treat anything you said with scorn , ”
124754	124760	124761	124761	she	430	“ Many things happened yesterday , ”
124764	124777	124761	124761	she	430	“ which might be offered as some excuse for an unguarded word . ”
124778	124786	124788	124788	Egremont	264	“ Would that it had been unguarded ! ”
124795	124888	124788	124788	Egremont	264	“ I could have endured it with less repining . No , Sybil , I have known you , I have had the happiness and the sorrow of knowing you too well to doubt the convictions of your mind , or to believe that they can be lightly removed , and yet I would strive to remove them . You look upon me as an enemy , as a natural foe , because I am born among the privileged . I am a man , Sybil , as well as a noble . ”
124902	125027	124893	124893	she	4119	“ And can I not feel for men , my fellows , whatever be their lot ? I know you will deny it ; but you are in error , Sybil ; you have formed your opinions upon tradition , not upon experience . The world that exists is not the world of which you have read ; the class that calls itself your superior is not the same class as ruled in the time of your fathers . There is a change in them as in all other things , and I participate that change . I shared it before I knew you , Sybil ; and if it touched me then , at least believe it does not influence me less now . ”
125028	125035	125037	125037	Sybil	430	“ If there be a change , ”
125039	125053	125037	125037	Sybil	430	“ it is because in some degree the People have learnt their strength . ”
125054	125065	125067	125067	Egremont	264	“ Ah ! dismiss from your mind those fallacious fancies , ”
125069	125275	125067	125067	Egremont	264	“ The People are not strong ; the People never can be strong . Their attempts at self - vindication will end only in their suffering and confusion . It is civilisation that has effected , that is effecting this change . It is that increased knowledge of themselves that teaches the educated their social duties . There is a dayspring in the history of this nation which those who are on the mountain tops can as yet perhaps only recognize . You deem you are in darkness , and I see a dawn . The new generation of the aristocracy of England are not tyrants , not oppressors , Sybil , as you persist in believing . Their intelligence , better than that , their hearts are open to the responsibility of their position . But the work that is before them is no holiday - work . It is not the fever of superficial impulse that can remove the deep - fixed barriers of centuries of ignorance and crime . Enough that their sympathies are awakened ; time and thought will bring the rest . They are the natural leaders of the People , Sybil ; believe me they are the only ones . ”
125276	125289	125291	125291	Sybil	430	“ The leaders of the People are those whom the People trust , ”
125295	125302	125304	125304	Egremont	264	“ And who may betray them , ”
125306	125310	125312	125312	Sybil	430	“ Betray them ! ”
125314	125323	125312	125312	Sybil	430	“ And can you believe that my father — ”
125324	125365	125067	125067	Egremont	264	“ No , no ; you can feel , Sybil , though I can not express , how much I honour your father . But he stands alone in the singleness and purity of his heart . Who surround him ? ”
125366	125453	125454	125454	Her	4120	“ Those whom the People have also chosen ; and from a like confidence in their virtues and abilities . They are a senate supported by the sympathy of millions , with only one object in view — the emancipation of their race . It is a sublime spectacle , these delegates of labour advocating the sacred cause in a manner which might shame your haughty factions . What can resist a demonstration so truly national ! What can withstand the supremacy of its moral power ! ”
125616	125625	125609	125609	he	264	“ Let me express to you my adoration ! “
125832	125833	125808	125808	I	0	” “
125841	125849	125808	125808	I	0	” said Sybil with an amazed air ; “
125858	125882	125808	125808	I	0	” And she paused for an instant , collecting as it were her mind with an expression almost of pain upon her countenance . “
125940	126026	125934	125934	you	430	“ Love of me ! Retain your hand and share your life and fortunes ! You forget what I am . But though I learnt only yesterday what you are , I will not be so remiss . Once you wrote upon a page you were my faithful friend : and I have pondered over that line with kindness often . I will be your faithful friend ; I will recall you to yourself . I will at least not bring you shame and degradation . ”
126027	126046	126084	126084	she	4129	“ O ! Sybil , beloved , beautiful Sybil — not such bitter words ; no , no ! ”
126047	126059	126061	126061	she	4129	“ No bitterness to you ! that would indeed be harsh , ”
126070	126076	126061	126061	she	4129	“ Why what is this ? ”
126087	126288	126084	126084	she	4129	“ An union between the child and brother of nobles and a daughter of the people ! Estrangement from your family , and with cause , their hopes destroyed , their pride outraged ; alienation from your order , and justly , all their prejudices insulted . You will forfeit every source of worldly content and cast off every spring of social success . Society for you will become a great confederation to deprive you of self - complacency . And rightly . Will you not be a traitor to the cause ? No , no , kind friend , for such I ’ll call you . Your opinion of me , too good and great as I feel it , touches me deeply . I am not used to such passages in life ; I have read of such . Pardon me , feel for me , if I receive them with some disorder . They sound to me for the first time — and for the last . Perhaps they ought never to have reached my ear . No matter now — I have a life of penitence before me , and I trust I shall be pardoned . ”
126293	126313	126084	126084	she	4129	“ You have indeed punished me for the fatal accident of birth , if it deprives me of you . ”
126314	126318	126319	126319	she	4130	“ Not so , ”
126323	126359	126319	126319	she	4130	“ I shall never be the bride of earth ; and but for one whose claims though earthly are to me irresistible , I should have ere this forgotten my hereditary sorrows in the cloister . ”
126506	126510	126511	126511	she	4130	“ Believe me , ”
126514	126520	126511	126511	she	4130	“ the gulf is impassable . ”
126521	126527	126529	126530	Mr Egerton	569	“ Terrible news from Birmingham , ”
126535	126556	126529	126530	Mr Egerton	569	“ They have massacred the police , beat off the military , and sacked the town . News just arrived . ”
126557	126566	126568	126572	a grey - headed gentleman	4134	“ I have known it these two hours , ”
126583	126591	126568	126572	a grey - headed gentleman	4134	“ There is a cabinet sitting now . ”
126592	126599	126601	126602	Mr Egerton	569	“ Well I always said so , ”
126604	126615	126601	126602	Mr Egerton	569	“ our fellows ought to have put down that Convention . ”
126616	126622	126624	126625	Mr Berners	272	“ It is deuced lucky , ”
126627	126657	126624	126625	Mr Berners	272	“ that the Bedchamber business is over , and we are all right . This affair in the midst of the Jamaica hitch would have been fatal to us . ”
126658	126667	126669	126670	Mr Egerton	569	“ These chartists evidently act upon a system , ”
126672	126708	126669	126670	Mr Egerton	569	“ You see they were perfectly quiet till the National Petition was presented and debated ; and now , almost simultaneously with our refusing to consider their petition , we have news of this outbreak . ”
126709	126717	126719	126723	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ I hope they will not spread , ”
126725	126771	126719	126723	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ There are not troops enough in the country if there be anything like a general movement . I hear they have sent the guards down by a special train , and a hundred more of the police . London is not over - garrisoned . ”
126772	126783	126785	126787	a Warwickshire peer	4136	“ They are always ready for a riot at Birmingham , ”
126789	126812	126785	126787	a Warwickshire peer	4136	“ Trade is very bad there and they suffer a good deal . But I should think it would not go farther . ”
126813	126818	126820	126824	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ I am told , ”
126826	126837	126820	126824	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ that business is getting slack in all the districts . ”
126838	126844	126846	126847	Mr Egerton	569	“ It might be better , ”
126849	126856	126846	126847	Mr Egerton	569	“ but they have got work . ”
126877	126882	126884	126886	one of them	4139	“ I am told , ”
126888	126896	126884	126886	one of them	4139	“ that the police were regularly smashed . ”
126897	126909	126820	126824	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ Is it true that the military were really beat off ? ”
126910	126979	126884	126886	one of them	4139	“ Quite untrue : the fact is there were no proper preparations ; the town was taken by surprise , the magistrates lost their heads ; the people were masters of the place ; and when the police did act , they were met by a triumphant populace , who two hours before would have fled before them . They say they have burnt down above forty houses . ”
126980	126992	126994	126998	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ It is a bad thing — this beating the police , ”
127000	127010	126994	126998	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ But what is the present state of affairs ? ”
127015	127022	127012	127013	Mr Berners	272	“ Are the rioters put down ? ”
127023	127029	127031	127032	Mr Egerton	569	“ Not in the least , ”
127034	127056	127031	127032	Mr Egerton	569	“ as I hear . They are encamped in the Bull Ring amid smoking ruins , and breathe nothing but havoc . ”
127057	127070	127072	127073	Mr Berners	272	“ Well , I voted for taking the National Petition into consideration , ”
127075	127090	127072	127073	Mr Berners	272	“ It could do us no harm , and would have kept things quiet . ”
127091	127100	127102	127103	Mr Egerton	569	“ So did every fellow on our side , ”
127105	127141	127102	127103	Mr Egerton	569	“ who was not in office or about to be . Well , Heaven knows what may come next . The Charter may some day be as popular in this club as the Reform Act . ”
127142	127150	127152	127153	Mr Berners	272	“ The oddest thing in that debate , ”
127155	127161	127152	127153	Mr Berners	272	“ was Egremont ’s move . ”
127162	127173	127175	127176	Mr Egerton	569	“ I saw Marney last night at Lady St Julians , ”
127178	127198	127175	127176	Mr Egerton	569	“ and congratulated him on his brother ’s speech . He looked daggers , and grinned like a ghoul . ”
127199	127211	127213	127217	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ It was a very remarkable speech — that of Egremont , ”
127219	127226	127213	127217	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ I wonder what he wants . ”
127227	127238	127240	127242	the Warwickshire peer	4142	“ I think he must be going to turn radical , ”
127244	127253	127255	127256	Mr Egerton	569	“ Why the whole speech was against radicalism , ”
127258	127272	127255	127256	Mr Egerton	569	“ Ah , then he is going to turn whig , I suppose . ”
127273	127281	127283	127283	Egerton	569	“ He is ultra anti - whig , ”
127285	127293	127295	127296	Mr Berners	272	“ Then what the deuce is he ? ”
127298	127314	127295	127296	Mr Berners	272	“ Not a conservative certainly , for Lady St Julians does nothing but abuse him . ”
127315	127322	127324	127326	the Warwickshire noble	4143	“ I suppose he is crotchetty , ”
127328	127344	127346	127350	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ That speech of Egremont was the most really democratic speech that I ever read , ”
127352	127359	127346	127350	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ How was it listened to ? ”
127360	127364	127366	127367	Mr Egerton	569	“ Oh capitally , ”
127369	127414	127366	127367	Mr Egerton	569	“ He has very seldom spoken before and always slightly though well . He was listened to with mute attention ; never was a better house . I should say made a great impression , though no one knew exactly what he was after . ”
127415	127434	127346	127350	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ What does he mean by obtaining the results of the charter without the intervention of its machinery ? ”
127519	127528	127530	127534	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ He spoke throughout in an exoteric vein , ”
127536	127592	127530	127534	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ and I apprehend was not very sure of his audience ; but I took him to mean , indeed it was the gist of the speech , that if you wished for a time to retain your political power , you could only effect your purpose by securing for the people greater social felicity . ”
127593	127601	127603	127605	the Warwickshire peer	4142	“ Well , that is sheer radicalism , ”
127607	127626	127603	127605	the Warwickshire peer	4142	“ pretending that the People can be better off than they are , is radicalism and nothing else . ”
127627	127636	127638	127639	Lord Loraine	681	“ I fear , if that be radicalism , ”
127641	127675	127638	127639	Lord Loraine	681	“ we must all take a leaf out of the same book . Sloane was saying at Boodle ’s just now that he looked forward to the winter in his country with horror . ”
127676	127684	127686	127687	Mr Egerton	569	“ And they have no manufactures there , ”
127689	127696	127698	127700	the Warwickshire peer	4142	“ Sloane was always a croaker , ”
127702	127731	127698	127700	the Warwickshire peer	4142	“ He always said the New Poor Law would not act , and there is no part of the country where it works so well as his own . ”
127732	127748	127750	127751	Lord Loraine	681	“ They say at Boodle ’s there is to be an increase to the army , ”
127753	127767	127750	127751	Lord Loraine	681	“ ten thousand men immediately ; decided on by the cabinet this afternoon . ”
127768	127779	127781	127785	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ It could hardly have leaked out by this time , ”
127787	127798	127781	127785	the grey - headed gentleman	4135	“ The cabinet were sitting less than an hour ago . ”
127799	127808	127810	127811	Lord Loraine	681	“ They have been up a good hour , ”
127813	127858	127810	127811	Lord Loraine	681	“ quite long enough for their decisions to be known in St James ’s Street . In the good old times , George Farnley used always to walk from Downing Street to this place the moment the council was up and tell us everything . ”
127859	127872	127874	127875	Mr Berners	272	“ Ah ! those were the good old gentleman - like times , ”
127877	127894	127874	127875	Mr Berners	272	“ when members of Parliament had nobody to please and ministers of State nothing to do . ”
129158	129162	129118	129118	he	7055	“ Mowbray Phalanx , ”
129932	129936	129938	129938	Gerard	430	“ She wishes , ”
129940	130015	129938	129938	Gerard	430	“ to take the veil , and I only oppose it for a time , that she may have some knowledge of life and a clear conception of what she is about to do . I wish not that she should hereafter reproach her father . But , to my mind , Sybil is right . She can not look to marriage : no man that she could marry would be worthy of her . ”
131788	131799	131800	131800	he	264	“ This is a great , an unexpected pleasure indeed . ”
131871	131879	131864	131864	she	430	“ I was reading your beautiful speech . ”
131880	131883	131885	131885	Egremont	264	“ Indeed , ”
131889	131907	131885	131885	Egremont	264	“ that is an honour,—a pleasure,—a reward , I never could have even hoped to have attained . ”
131908	131912	131914	131914	Sybil	430	“ By all , ”
131921	131943	131914	131914	Sybil	430	“ it must be read with pleasure , with advantage , but by me — oh ! with what deep interest . ”
131944	131957	131960	131960	he	264	“ If anything that I said finds an echo in your breast , ”
131963	131974	131975	131975	he	264	“ — it will give me confidence for the future , ”
131979	131990	131992	131992	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! why do not others feel like you ! ”
131994	132002	131992	131992	Sybil	430	“ all would not then be hopeless . ”
132003	132010	132015	132015	he	264	“ But you are not hopeless , ”
132034	132041	132043	132043	Egremont	264	“ But when we spoke last , ”
132045	132061	132043	132043	Egremont	264	“ you were full of confidence — in your cause , and in your means . ”
132062	132070	132072	132072	Sybil	430	“ It is not very long ago , ”
132074	132093	132072	132072	Sybil	430	“ since we thus spoke , and yet time in the interval has taught me some bitter truths . ”
132094	132100	132102	132102	Egremont	264	“ Truth is very precious , ”
132104	132128	132102	132102	Egremont	264	“ to us all ; and yet I fear I could not sufficiently appreciate the cause that deprived you of your sanguine faith . ”
132129	132132	132134	132134	Sybil	430	“ Alas ! ”
132137	132178	132180	132180	she	430	“ I was but a dreamer of dreams : I wake from my hallucination as others have done I suppose before me . Like them too I feel the glory of life has gone ; but my content at least , ”
132186	132198	132180	132180	she	430	“ has never rested I hope too much on this world . ”
132199	132207	132102	132102	Egremont	264	“ You are depressed , dear Sybil ? ”
132208	132267	132102	132102	Egremont	264	“ I am unhappy . I am anxious about my father . I fear that he is surrounded by men unworthy of his confidence . These scenes of violence alarm me . Under any circumstances I should shrink from them , but I am impressed with the conviction that they can bring us nothing but disaster and disgrace . ”
132268	132274	132276	132276	Egremont	264	“ I honor your father , ”
132278	132339	132276	132276	Egremont	264	“ I know no man whose character I esteem so truly noble ; such a just compound of intelligence and courage , and gentle and generous impulse . I should deeply grieve were he to compromise himself . But you have influence over him , the greatest , as you have over all . Counsel him to return to Mowbray . ”
132340	132346	132348	132348	Sybil	430	“ Can I give counsel ? ”
132350	132463	132348	132348	Sybil	430	“ I who have been wrong in all my judgments ? I came up to this city with him , to be his guide , his guardian . What arrogance ! What short - sighted pride ! I thought the People all felt as I feel ; that I had nothing to do but to sustain and animate him ; to encourage him when he flagged , to uphold him when he wavered . I thought that moral power must govern the world , and that moral power was embodied in an assembly whose annals will be a series of petty intrigues , or , what is worse , of violent machinations . ”
132464	132469	132471	132471	Egremont	264	“ Exert every energy , ”
132473	132572	132471	132471	Egremont	264	“ that your father should leave London , immediately ; to - morrow , to - night if possible . After this business at Birmingham , the government must act . I hear that they will immediately increase the army and the police ; and that there is a circular from the Secretary of State to the Lords Lieutenant of counties . But the government will strike at the Convention . The members who remain will be the victims . If your father return to Mowbray and be quiet , he has a chance of not being disturbed . ”
132573	132582	132584	132584	Sybil	430	“ An ignoble end of many lofty hopes , ”
132586	132593	132595	132595	Egremont	264	“ Let us retain our hopes , ”
132597	132602	132595	132595	Egremont	264	“ and cherish them . ”
132603	132608	132609	132609	she	430	“ I have none , ”
132612	132618	132620	132620	Egremont	264	“ And I am sanguine , ”
132622	132681	132620	132620	Egremont	264	“ Ah ! because you have made a beautiful speech . But they will listen to you , they will cheer you , but they will never follow you . The dove and the eagle will not mate ; the lion and the lamb will not lie down together ; and the conquerors will never rescue the conquered . ”
132687	132957	132684	132684	his	264	“ You still will cherish these phantoms , dear Sybil ! and why ? They are not visions of delight . Believe me they are as vain as they are distressing . The mind of England is the mind ever of the rising race . Trust me it is with the People . And not the less so , because this feeling is one of which even in a great degree it is unconscious . Those opinions which you have been educated to dread and mistrust are opinions that are dying away . Predominant opinions are generally the opinions of the generation that is vanishing . Let an accident , which speculation could not foresee , the balanced state at this moment of parliamentary parties cease , and in a few years , more or less , cease it must , and you will witness a development of the new mind of England , which will make up by its rapid progress for its retarded action . I live among these men ; I know their inmost souls ; I watch their instincts and their impulses ; I know the principles which they have imbibed , and I know , however hindered by circumstances for the moment , those principles must bear their fruit . It will be a produce hostile to the oligarchical system . The future principle of English politics will not be a levelling principle ; not a principle adverse to privileges , but favourable to their extension . It will seek to ensure equality , not by levelling the Few but by elevating the Many . ”
133029	133035	133018	133018	she	430	“ Here we must part , ”
133043	133050	133052	133052	Egremont	264	“ Heaven will guard over you ! ”
133054	133062	133052	133052	Egremont	264	“ for you are a celestial charge . ”
133200	133221	133185	133185	she	430	“ If you are going out , dear father , I should like to see you for one moment first . ”
133222	133228	133230	133230	Gerard	430	“ A moment , friends , ”
133232	133237	133230	133230	Gerard	430	“ with your leave ; ”
133312	133329	133309	133309	she	430	“ We are once more together , dear father ; we will never again he separated . ”
133345	133354	133309	133309	she	430	“ Something has happened to you , Sybil ! ”
133355	133358	133359	133359	she	430	“ No , ”
133367	133378	133363	133363	her	430	“ not that ; but something may happen to you . ”
133379	133386	133393	133393	his	7055	“ How so , my child ? ”
133417	133423	133425	133425	Sybil	430	“ You are in danger , ”
133427	133500	133425	133425	Sybil	430	“ great and immediate . No matter at this moment how I am persuaded of this I wish no mysteries , but there is no time for details . The government will strike at the Convention ; they are resolved . This outbreak at Birmingham has brought affairs to a crisis . They have already arrested the leaders there ; they will seize those who remain here in avowed correspondence with them . ”
133501	133514	133516	133516	Gerard	430	“ If they arrest all who are in correspondence with the Convention , ”
133518	133526	133516	133516	Gerard	430	“ they will have enough to do . ”
133527	133537	133539	133539	Sybil	430	“ Yes ; but you take a leading part , ”
133541	133550	133539	133539	Sybil	430	“ you are the individual they would select . ”
133551	133559	133561	133561	Gerard	430	“ Would you have me hide myself ? ”
133563	133573	133561	133561	Gerard	430	“ just because something is going on besides talk . ”
133574	133578	133580	133580	Sybil	430	“ Besides talk ! ”
133582	133613	133580	133580	Sybil	430	“ O ! my father , what thoughts are these ! It may be that words are vain to save us ; but feeble deeds are vainer far than words . ”
133614	133636	133638	133638	Gerard	430	“ I do not see that the deeds , though I have nothing to do with them , are so feeble , ”
133640	133676	133638	133638	Gerard	430	“ their boasted police are beaten , and by the isolated movement of an unorganized mass . What if the outbreak had not been a solitary one ? What if the people had been disciplined ? ”
133677	133693	133695	133695	Sybil	430	“ What if everything were changed , if everything were contrary to what it is ? ”
133697	133742	133743	133743	Gerard	430	“ The people are not disciplined ; their action will not be , can not be , coherent and uniform ; these are riots in which you are involved , not revolutions ; and you will be a victim , and not a sacrifice . ”
133759	133905	133907	133907	Gerard	430	“ We must not be scared at a few arrests , Sybil . These are hap - hazard pranks of a government that wants to terrify , but is itself frightened . I have not counselled , none of us have counselled , this stir at Birmingham . It is a casualty . We were none of us prepared for it . But great things spring from casualties . I say the police were beaten and the troops alarmed ; and I say this was done without organization and in a single spot . I am as much against feeble deeds as you can be , Sybil ; and to prove this to you , our conversation at the moment you arrived , was to take care for the future that there shall be none . Neither vain words nor feeble deeds for the future , ”
133977	133989	133974	133974	she	430	“ Oh ! my father , your child is most unhappy . ”
133990	133993	133995	133995	Gerard	430	“ Sybil , ”
134003	134018	133995	133995	Gerard	430	“ this is womanish weakness ; I love , but must not share it . ”
134019	134025	134027	134027	Sybil	430	“ It may be womanish , ”
134029	134053	134027	134027	Sybil	430	“ but it is wise : for what should make us unhappy if not the sense of impending , yet unknown , danger ? ”
134054	134059	134061	134061	Gerard	430	“ And why danger ? ”
134063	134067	134069	134069	Sybil	430	“ Why mystery ? ”
134071	134263	134069	134069	Sybil	430	“ Why are you ever pre - occupied and involved in dark thoughts , my father ? It is not the pressure of business , as you will perhaps tell me , that occasions this change in a disposition so frank and even careless . The pressure of affairs is not nearly as great , can not he nearly as great , as in the early period of your assembling , when the eyes of the whole country were on you , and you were in communication with all parts of it . How often have you told me that there was no degree of business which you found irksome ? Now you are all dispersed and scattered : no discussions , no committees , little correspondence — and you yourself are ever brooding and ever in conclave , with persons too who I know , for Stephen has told me so , are the preachers of violence : violence perhaps that some of them may preach , yet will not practise : both bad ; traitors it may be , or , at the best , hare - brained men . ”
134264	134269	134271	134271	Gerard	430	“ Stephen is prejudiced , ”
134273	134348	134271	134271	Gerard	430	“ He is a visionary , indulging in impossible dreams , and if possible , little desirable . He knows nothing of the feeling of the country or the character of his countrymen . Englishmen want none of his joint - stock felicity ; they want their rights,—rights consistent with the rights of other classes , but without which the rights of other classes can not , and ought not , to be secure . ”
134349	134366	134069	134069	Sybil	430	“ Stephen is at least your friend , my father ; and once you honoured him . ”
134367	134475	134069	134069	Sybil	430	“ And do so now ; and love him very dearly . I honour him for his great abilities and knowledge . Stephen is a scholar ; I have no pretensions that way ; but I can feel the pulse of a people , and can comprehend the signs of the times , Sybil . Stephen was all very well talking in our cottage and garden at Mowbray , when we had nothing to do ; but now we must act , or others will act for us . Stephen is not a practical man ; he is crotchety , Sybil , and that ’s just it . ”
134476	134482	134484	134484	Sybil	430	“ But violence and action , ”
134486	134494	134484	134484	Sybil	430	“ are they identical , my father ? ”
134495	134503	134069	134069	Sybil	430	“ I did not speak of violence . ”
134504	134653	134655	134655	Sybil	430	“ No ; but you looked it . I know the language of your countenance , even to the quiver of your lip . Action , as you and Stephen once taught me , and I think wisely , was to prove to our rulers by an agitation , orderly and intellectual , that we were sensible of our degradation ; and that it was neither Christianlike nor prudent , neither good nor wise , to let us remain so . That you did , and you did it well ; the respect of the world , even of those who differed from you in interest or opinion , was not withheld from you ; and can be withheld from none who exercise the moral power that springs from great talents and a good cause . You have let this great moral power , this pearl of price , ”
134657	134675	134655	134655	Sybil	430	emotion,—“we can not conceal it from ourselves , my father,—you have let it escape from your hands . ”
134716	134732	134713	134713	he	4334	“ The season for words is past . I must be gone , dear Sybil . ”
134740	134747	134749	134749	Sybil	430	“ You shall not leave me , ”
134759	134768	134770	134770	Gerard	430	“ What would you , what would you ? ”
134774	134785	134770	134770	Gerard	430	“ That we should quit this city to - night . ”
134786	134793	134713	134713	he	4334	“ What , quit my post ? ”
134794	134838	134770	134770	Gerard	430	“ Why yours ? Have not your colleagues dispersed ? Is not your assembly formally adjourned to another town ? Is it not known that the great majority of the delegates have returned to their homes ? And why not you to yours ? ”
134839	134845	134847	134847	Gerard	430	“ I have no home , ”
134856	134939	134941	134941	he	4335	“ I came here to do the business that was wanting , and , by the blessing of God , I will do it . I am no changeling , nor can I refine and split straws , like your philosophers and Morleys : but if the people will struggle , I will struggle with them ; and die , if need be , in the front . Nor will I be deterred from my purpose by the tears of a girl , ”
135061	135068	135041	135041	she	1068	“ I thought you had gone . ”
135069	135078	135080	135080	Gerard	430	“ Not in anger , my sweet child , ”
135087	135092	135094	135094	Sybil	430	“ But you go , ”
135096	135102	135104	135104	Gerard	430	“ These men await me , ”
135106	135176	135104	135104	Gerard	430	“ Our council is of importance . We must take some immediate steps for the aid of our brethren in distress at Birmingham , and to discountenance similar scenes of outbreak as this affair : but the moment this is over , I will come back to you ; and for the rest , it shall be as you desire ; to - morrow we will return to Mowbray . ”
135848	135853	135855	135855	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! Stephen , ”
135864	135872	135855	135855	Sybil	430	“ I thought it was my father . ”
135873	135885	135887	135887	Morley	423	“ I should have been glad to have found him here , ”
135889	135898	135887	135887	Morley	423	“ However with your permission I will enter . ”
135899	135906	135908	135908	Sybil	430	“ And he will soon arrive , ”
135910	135927	135908	135908	Sybil	430	“ I am sure he will soon arrive . I have been expecting him every minute — ”
135928	135932	135934	135934	Morley	423	“ For hours , ”
135946	135954	135955	135955	he	423	“ The business that he is on , ”
135975	135985	135955	135955	he	423	“ The business that he is on is engrossing . ”
135986	135990	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ Thank Heaven , ”
135994	136003	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ we leave this place to - morrow . ”
136004	136007	136009	136009	Morley	423	“ Hah ! ”
136012	136018	136009	136009	Morley	423	“ who told you so ? ”
136019	136036	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ My father has so settled it ; has indeed promised me that we shall depart . ”
136037	136046	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ And you were anxious to do so . ”
136047	136064	136009	136009	Morley	423	“ Most anxious ; my mind is prophetic only of mischief to him if we remain . ”
136065	136078	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ Mine too . Otherwise I should not have come up today . ”
136079	136087	136089	136089	Sybil	430	“ You have seen him I hope ? ”
136091	136102	136089	136089	Sybil	430	“ I have ; I have been hours with him . ”
136103	136115	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ I am glad . At this conference he talked of ? ”
136116	136143	135992	135992	Sybil	430	“ Yes ; at this headstrong council ; and I have seen him since ; alone . Whatever hap to him , my conscience is assoiled . ”
136144	136151	136153	136153	Sybil	430	“ You terrify me , Stephen , ”
136159	136185	136153	136153	Sybil	430	“ What can happen to him ? What would he do , what would you resist ? Tell me — tell me , dear friend . ”
136186	136191	136193	136193	Morley	423	“ Oh ! yes , ”
136204	136212	136193	136193	Morley	423	“ Oh ! yes ; dear friend ! ”
136213	136224	136226	136226	Sybil	430	“ I said dear friend for so I deemed you . ”
136228	136248	136226	136226	Sybil	430	“ and so we have ever found you . Why do you stare at me so strangely , Stephen ? ”
136249	136263	136265	136265	Morley	423	“ So you deem me , and so you have ever found me , ”
136277	136294	136295	136295	he	423	“ Well ; what more would you have ? What more should any of us want ? ”
136299	136305	136307	136307	Sybil	430	“ I want no more , ”
136310	136329	136330	136330	he	423	“ I warrant me , you do not . Well , well , nothing matters . And so , ”
136337	136345	136330	136330	he	423	“ you are waiting for your father ? ”
136346	136355	136357	136357	Sybil	430	“ Whom you have not long since seen , ”
136359	136368	136357	136357	Sybil	430	“ and whom you expected to find here ? ”
136369	136372	136374	136374	Morley	423	“ No ; ”
136385	136400	136377	136377	his	423	“ no , no . I did n’t . I came to find you . ”
136401	136409	136411	136411	Sybil	430	“ You have something to tell me , ”
136414	136434	136436	136436	she	430	“ Something has happened to my father . Do not break it to me ; tell me at once , ”
136460	136486	136446	136446	Morley	423	“ No , no , no ; nothing has happened . Much may happen , but nothing has happened . And we may prevent it . ”
136487	136502	136436	136436	she	430	“ We ! Tell me what may happen ; tell me what to do . ”
136503	136507	136509	136509	Morley	423	“ Your father , ”
136530	136551	136515	136515	his	423	“ Your father — and my friend — is in this position Sybil : he is conspiring against the State . ”
136552	136557	136559	136559	Sybil	430	“ Yes , yes , ”
136578	136583	136570	136570	her	430	“ Tell me all . ”
136584	136620	136570	136570	her	430	“ I will . He is conspiring , I say , against the State . Tonight they meet in secret to give the last finish to their plans ; and tonight they will be arrested . ”
136621	136625	136627	136627	Sybil	430	“ O God ! ”
136632	136638	136627	136627	Sybil	430	“ He told me truth . ”
136639	136645	136647	136647	Morley	423	“ Who told you truth ? ”
136665	136669	136671	136671	Sybil	430	“ A friend , ”
136683	136704	136627	136627	Sybil	430	“ a kind good friend . I met him but this morn , and he warned me of all this . ”
136705	136710	136712	136712	Morley	423	“ Hah , hah ! ”
136720	136794	136712	136712	Morley	423	“ Hah , hah ; he told you did he ; the kind good friend whom you met this morning ? Did I not warn you , Sybil , of the traitor ? Did I not tell you to beware of taking this false aristocrat to your hearth ; to worm out all the secrets of that home that he once polluted by his espionage , and now would desolate by his treason . ”
136795	136804	136806	136806	Sybil	430	“ Of whom and what do you speak ? ”
136814	136823	136806	136806	Sybil	430	“ I speak of that base spy Egremont . ”
136824	136831	136833	136833	Sybil	430	“ You slander an honourable man , ”
136837	136858	136806	136806	Sybil	430	“ Mr Egremont has never entered this house since you met him here for the first time ; save once . ”
136859	136873	136875	136875	Morley	423	“ He needed no entrance to this house to worm out its secrets , ”
136878	136900	136875	136875	Morley	423	“ That could be more adroitly done by one who had assignations at command with the most charming of its inmates . ”
136901	136905	136907	136907	Sybil	430	“ Unmannerly churl ! ”
136925	136935	136937	136937	Morley	423	“ Oh ! yes . I am a churl , ”
136939	136966	136937	136937	Morley	423	“ I know I am a churl . Were I a noble the daughter of the people would perhaps condescend to treat me with less contempt . ”
136967	137000	136875	136875	Morley	423	“ The daughter of the people loves truth and manly bearing , Stephen Morley ; and will treat with contempt all those who slander women , whether they be nobles or serfs . ”
137001	137008	136913	136913	her	430	“ And where is the slanderer ? ”
137009	137026	136937	136937	Morley	423	“ Ask him who told you I held assignations with Mr Egremont or with any one . ”
137027	137039	137041	137041	Morley	423	“ Mine eyes — mine own eyes — were my informant , ”
137043	137066	137067	137067	he	423	“ This morn , the very morn I arrived in London , I learnt how your matins were now spent . Yes ! ”
137076	137090	137067	137067	he	423	“ I passed the gate of the gardens ; I witnessed your adieus . ”
137091	137097	137099	137099	Sybil	430	“ We met by hazard , ”
137119	137147	137112	137112	she	430	“ and in all probability we shall never meet again . Talk not of these trifles . Stephen ; my father , how can we save him ? ”
137148	137153	137155	137155	Morley	423	“ Are they trifles ? ”
137174	137192	137193	137193	he	423	“ Are they indeed trifles , Sybil ? Oh ! make me credit that , and then — ”
137236	137243	137244	137244	he	423	“ Pardon me , pardon me , ”
137253	137265	137248	137248	he	423	“ Pardon the most miserable and the most devoted of men ! ”
137266	137275	137277	137277	Sybil	430	“ What need of pardon , dear Stephen ? ”
137283	137308	137277	137277	Sybil	430	“ In the agitated hour wild words escape . If I have used them , I regret ; if you , I have forgotten . ”
137327	137330	137332	137332	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! ”
137338	137352	137332	137332	Sybil	430	“ you told me how precious was time . What can we do ? ”
137383	137415	137375	137375	he	423	“ I can endure no longer the anguish of my life : I love you , and if you will not be mine , I care for no one ’s fate . ”
137416	137424	137426	137426	Sybil	430	“ I am not born for love , ”
137437	137445	137447	137447	Morley	423	“ We are all born for love , ”
137449	137469	137470	137470	he	423	“ It is the principle of existence , and its only end . And love of you , Sybil , ”
137480	137614	137470	137470	he	423	“ has been to me for years the hoarded treasure of my life . For this I have haunted your hearth and hovered round your home ; for this I have served your father like a slave , and embarked in a cause with which I have little sympathy , and which can meet with no success . It is your image that has stimulated my ambition , developed my powers , sustained me in the hour of humiliation , and secured me that material prosperity which I can now command . Oh ! deign to share it ; share it with the impassioned heart and the devoted life that now bow before you ; and do not shrink from them , because they are the feelings and the fortunes of the People . ”
137615	137623	137625	137625	Sybil	430	“ You astound , you overwhelm me , ”
137629	137659	137625	137625	Sybil	430	“ You came for another purpose , we were speaking of other feelings ; it is the hour of exigency you choose for these strange , these startling words . ”
137660	137669	137671	137671	Morley	423	“ I also have my hour of exigency , ”
137673	137686	137671	137671	Morley	423	“ and its minutes are now numbering . Upon it all depends . ”
137687	137691	137693	137693	Sybil	430	“ Another time , ”
137702	137710	137693	137693	Sybil	430	“ speak of these things another time ! ”
137711	137720	137722	137722	Morley	423	“ The caverns of my mind are open , ”
137724	137731	137722	137722	Morley	423	“ and they will not close . ”
137732	137735	137737	137737	Sybil	430	“ Stephen , ”
137739	137767	137737	137737	Sybil	430	“ dear Stephen , I am grateful for your kind feelings : but indeed this is not the time for such passages : cease , my friend ! ”
137768	137776	137778	137778	Morley	423	“ I came to know my fate , ”
137782	137790	137792	137792	Sybil	430	“ It is a sacrilege of sentiment , ”
137802	137815	137792	137792	Sybil	430	“ to obtrude its expression on a daughter at such a moment . ”
137816	137836	137838	137838	Morley	423	“ You would not deem it so if you loved , or if you could love me , Sybil , ”
137842	137880	137838	137838	Morley	423	“ Why it ’s a moment of deep feeling , and suited for the expression of deep feeling . You would not have answered thus , if he who had been kneeling here had been named Egremont . ”
137881	137890	137892	137892	Sybil	430	“ He would not have adopted a course , ”
137902	137909	137899	137899	her	430	“ so selfish , so indecent . ”
137910	137917	137919	137919	Morley	423	“ Ah ! she loves him ! ”
138073	138086	138070	138070	Sybil	430	“ Stephen , be generous ; speak to me of your friend . ”
138087	138093	138095	138095	Morley	423	“ I have no friend , ”
138105	138115	138117	138117	Sybil	430	“ The Saints in heaven have mercy on me , ”
138119	138126	138117	138117	Sybil	430	“ for I am very wretched . ”
138127	138134	138136	138136	Morley	423	“ No , no , no , ”
138151	138200	138136	138136	Morley	423	“ not wretched ; not that tone of anguish ! What can I do ? what say ? Sybil , dearest Sybil , I love you so much , so fervently , so devotedly ; none can love you as I do : say not you are wretched ! ”
138201	138206	138208	138208	Sybil	430	“ Alas ! alas ! ”
138210	138219	138221	138221	Morley	423	“ What shall I do ? what say ? ”
138223	138233	138235	138235	Sybil	430	“ You know what I would have you say , ”
138237	138273	138235	138235	Sybil	430	“ Speak of one who is my father , if no longer your friend : you know what I would have you do — save him : save him from death and me from despair . ”
138274	138279	138281	138281	Morley	423	“ I am ready , ”
138283	138552	138281	138281	Morley	423	“ I came for that . Listen . There is a meeting to - night at half - past eight o’clock ; they meet to arrange a general rising in the country : their intention is known to the government ; they will be arrested . Now it is in my power , which it was not when I saw your father this morning , to convince him of the truth of this , and were I to see him before eight o’clock , which I could easily do , I could prevent his attendance , certainly prevent his attendance , and he would be saved ; for the government depend much upon the papers , some proclamations , and things of that kind , which will be signed this evening , for their proofs . Well , I am ready to save Gerard , my friend , for so I ’ll call him as you wish it ; one I have served before and long ; one whom I came up from Mowbray this day to serve and save ; I am ready to do that which you require ; you yourself admit it is no light deed ; and coming from one you have known so long , and , as you confess , so much regarded , should be doubly cherished ; I am ready to do this great service ; to save the father from death and the daughter from despair . — if she would but only say to me , ‘ I have but one reward , and it is yours . ’ ”
138553	138563	138565	138565	Sybil	430	“ I have read of something of this sort , ”
138582	138661	138565	138565	Sybil	430	“ this bargaining of blood , and shall I call it love ? But that was ever between the oppressors and the oppressed . This is the first time that a child of the people has been so assailed by one of her own class , and who exercises his power from the confidence which the sympathy of their sorrows alone caused . It is bitter ; bitter for me and mine — but for you , pollution . ”
138662	138667	138669	138669	Morley	423	“ Am I answered ? ”
138671	138674	138676	138676	Sybil	430	“ Yes , ”
138678	138687	138676	138676	Sybil	430	“ in the name of the holy Virgin . ”
138688	138694	138696	138696	Morley	423	“ Good night , then , ”
138720	138729	138730	138730	she	430	“ Where do they meet to - night ? ”
138738	138745	138747	138747	Morley	423	“ I am bound to secrecy , ”
138749	138758	138760	138760	Sybil	430	“ There is no softness in your spirit , ”
138762	138769	138760	138760	Sybil	430	“ I am met with none . ”
138770	138778	138730	138730	she	430	“ We have ever been your friends . ”
138779	138788	138760	138760	Sybil	430	“ A blossom that has brought no fruit . ”
138789	138801	138803	138803	Sybil	430	“ This hour will be remembered at the judgment - seat , ”
138805	138815	138817	138817	Morley	423	“ The holy Virgin will perhaps interpose for me , ”
138823	138829	138831	138831	Sybil	430	“ We have merited this , ”
138833	138843	138831	138831	Sybil	430	“ who have taken an infidel to our hearts . ”
138844	138856	138858	138858	Morley	423	“ If he had only been a heretic , like Egremont ! ”
138870	138925	138865	138865	Morley	423	“ Swear by the holy Virgin , swear by all the saints , swear by your hope of heaven and by your own sweet name ; without equivocation , without reserve , with fulness and with truth , that you will never give your heart or hand to Egremont;—and I will save your father . ”
138984	138996	138981	138981	she	430	“ I swear that I will never give my hand to — ”
138997	139005	139007	139007	Morley	423	“ And your heart , your heart , ”
139010	139035	138981	138981	she	430	“ Omit not that . Swear by the holy oaths again you do not love him . She falters ! Ah ! she blushes ! ”
139047	139052	139054	139054	Morley	423	“ She loves him , ”
139458	139469	139472	139472	she	430	Sybil—“Swear by the holy Virgin and by all the saints . ”
139857	139863	139865	139866	the cabman	4402	“ What number . Ma’am ? ”
139868	139915	139865	139866	the cabman	4402	“ ‘ Tis a coffee - house ; I know not the number nor the name of him who keeps it . ‘ Tis a coffee - house . Can you see one ? Look , look , I pray you ! I am much pressed . ”
139916	139926	139928	139929	the man	6600	“ Here ’s a coffee - house , Ma’am , ”
139936	139959	139865	139866	the cabman	4402	“ How good you are ! Yes ; I will get out . You will wait for me , I am sure ? ”
139960	139964	139966	139967	the cabman	4402	“ All right , ”
139976	139988	139966	139967	the cabman	4402	“ Poor young thing ! she ’s wery anxious about summut . ”
140065	140074	140076	140077	the waiter	1928	“ Now , Ma’am , if you please , ”
140080	140086	140088	140088	Sybil	430	“ Is Mr Gerard here ? ”
140090	140107	140108	140108	he	4419	“ No . Ma’am ; Mr Gerard has not been here to - day , nor yesterday neither”—and
140115	140127	140129	140129	Sybil	430	“ I should like to see the master of the house , ”
140133	140139	140141	140142	the waiter	1928	“ Should you , Ma’am ? ”
140291	140303	140288	140288	she	430	“ Is there not one among you who will assist me ? ”
140315	140320	140322	140323	the waiter	1928	“ Hoity - toity , ”
140333	140342	140344	140347	one of the guests	4433	“ Well , what ’s the matter now ? ”
140349	140364	140366	140366	Sybil	430	“ I wish to see the master of the house on business of urgency , ”
140368	140390	140366	140366	Sybil	430	“ to himself and to one of his friends , and his servant here will not even reply to my inquiries . ”
140391	140406	140408	140409	another guest	4435	“ I say , Saul , why do n’t you answer the young lady ? ”
140411	140416	140418	140418	Saul	695	“ So I did , ”
140420	140429	140418	140418	Saul	695	“ Did you call for coffee , Ma’am ? ”
140430	140444	140446	140448	the first guest	4436	“ Here ’s Mr Tanner , if you want him , my dear . ”
140475	140485	140446	140448	the first guest	4436	“ Tanner , here ’s a lady wants you . ”
140486	140494	140418	140418	Saul	695	“ And a very pretty girl too , ”

140696	140711	140690	140690	Sybil	430	“ I come here that you may tell me where I may find him . ”
140712	140721	140723	140723	Tanner	696	“ I believe he lives somewhere in Westminster , ”
140725	140754	140723	140723	Tanner	696	“ that ’s all I know about him ; and if this be all you had to say it might have been said in the coffee - room . ”
140755	140766	140768	140768	Sybil	430	“ It is not all that I have to say , ”
140770	140817	140819	140819	she	430	“ and I beseech you , sir , listen to me . I know where Gerard lives : I am his daughter , and the same roof covers our heads . But I wish to know where they meet to - night — you understand me ; ”

Well , you go up St Martin ’s Lane to a certain point , and then you will get into Seven Dials ; and then you ’ll go on . However it is impossible to direct you ; you must find your way . Hunt Street , going out of Silver Street , No . 22 . ‘ Tis what you call a blind street , with no thoroughfare , and then you go down an alley . Can you recollect that ? ”

142769	142779	142750	142750	he	782	“ It is close at hand , I believe ? ”
142780	142785	142786	142786	he	782	“ Here it is , ”
142796	142802	142790	142790	he	782	“ What is your house ? ”
142803	142813	142815	142815	Sybil	430	“ No . 22 : a printing - office . ”
142847	142856	142858	142859	the stranger	6608	“ The very house I am going to , ”
142861	142867	142858	142859	the stranger	6608	“ I am a printer . ”

143118	143133	143102	143102	Sybil	430	“ I beseech you , by everything we hold sacred , to aid me . ”
143134	143140	143142	143143	the man	6600	“ And will I not ? ”
143145	143159	143161	143161	he	6600	“ and I should like to see the arm that would hurt you ; ”
143172	143182	143183	143183	he	6600	“ You are not a countrywoman I am thinking , ”
143186	143195	143197	143197	Sybil	430	“ No , but a sister in Christ , ”
143199	143235	143197	143197	Sybil	430	“ listen to me , good friend . I hasten to my father,—he is in great danger,—in Hunt Street,—I know not my way,—every moment is precious,—guide me , I beseech you,—honestly and truly guide me ! ”
143236	143300	143303	143303	Sybil	430	“ Will I not ? Do n’t you be afraid my dear . And her poor father is ill ! I wish I had such a daughter ! We have not far to go . You should have taken the next turning . We must walk up this again for ‘ tis a small street with no thoroughfare . Come on without fear . ”
143491	143497	143499	143503	a young genius of fourteen	4555	“ I say , Jim , ”
143510	143538	143499	143503	a young genius of fourteen	4555	“ I pity them ere jarvies a sitting on their boxes all the night and waiting for the nobs what is dancing . They as no repose . ”
143539	143545	143547	143548	his friend	6719	“ But they as porter , ”
143565	143611	143547	143548	his friend	6719	“ They takes their pot of half - and - half by turns , and if their name is called , the link what they subscribe for to pay , sings out ‘ here ; ’ and that ’s the way their guvners is done . ”

143710	143720	143722	143724	the young one	4557	“ I wonder what the nobs has for supper , ”
143727	143735	143722	143724	the young one	4557	“ Lots of kidneys I dare say . ”
143736	143765	143626	143628	the young one	4557	“ Oh ! no ; sweets is the time of day in these here blowouts : syllabubs like blazes , and snapdragon as makes the flunkys quite pale . ”

143828	143851	143812	143816	the person whom she addressed	4561	“ I have bivouacked in many lands , but never with so young a comrade : I beg you a thousand pardons . ”
143852	143886	143815	143815	she	4559	“ Sir , you are very polite . These warm nights are a great blessing , but I am sure I know not what we shall do in the fall of the leaf . ”
143887	143895	143897	143898	the foreigner	4562	“ Take no thought of the morrow , ”
143930	143936	143953	143953	he	4562	“ It brings many changes . ”
143993	144003	144004	144004	he	1218	“ I am the Lord Mayor of the night , ”
144007	144034	144004	144004	he	1218	“ and I will have no row here . ‘ Tis the like of you that makes the beaks threaten to expel us from our lodgings . ”
144068	144078	144056	144056	himself	4570	“ Where am I ? What ’s all this ? ”
144079	144086	144088	144125	the elder of the two lads we first noticed , “ only a couple of unfortinate gals who ’ve prigged a watch from a cove what was lushy and fell asleep under the trees between this and Kinsington	9833	“ Oh ! it ’s nothin’ , ”

144128	144137	144139	144140	the man	6600	“ I wish they had not waked me , ”
144142	144194	144139	144140	the man	6600	“ I walked as far as from Stokenchurch , and that ’s a matter of forty miles , this morning to see if I could get some work , and went to bed here without any supper . I ’m blessed if I worn’t dreaming of a roast leg of pork . ”
144195	144206	144208	144209	the lad	4574	“ It has not been a lucky day for me , ”
144211	144307	144208	144209	the lad	4574	“ I could not find a single gentleman ’s horse to hold , so help me , except one what was at the House of Commons , and he kept me there two mortal hours and said when he came out , that he would remember me next time . I ai n’t tasted no wittals to - day except some cat’s - meat and a cold potatoe what was given me by a cabman ; but I have got a quid here , and if you are very low I ’ll give you half . ”
144389	144394	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ Where is Arabella ? ”
144402	144442	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ I want to present young Huntingford to her . He can be of great use to me , but he bores me so , I can not talk to him . I want to present him to Arabella . ”
144443	144473	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ Arabella is in the blue drawing - room . I saw her just now with Mr Jermyn and Charles . Count Soudriaffsky is teaching them some Russian tricks . ”
144474	144532	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ What are Russian tricks to me ; she must talk to young Huntingford ; everything depends on his working with me against the Cut - and - Come - again branch - line ; they have refused me my compensation , and I am not going to have my estate cut up into ribbons without compensation . ”
144533	144539	144541	144543	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ My dear Lady Deloraine , ”
144545	144567	144541	144543	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ How beautiful your gallery looks to - night ! Certainly there is nothing in London that lights up so well . ”
144568	144587	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ Its greatest ornaments are its guests . I am charmed to see Lady Joan looking so well . ”
144588	144593	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ You think so ? ”
144594	144597	144541	144543	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ Indeed . ”
144598	144602	144396	144397	Lord Marney	402	“ I wish — ”
144613	144622	144605	144607	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ What do you think of Mr Mountchesney ? ”
144623	144629	144541	144543	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ He is universally admired . ”
144630	144639	144605	144607	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ So every one says , and yet — ”
144640	144652	144654	144655	Mr Berners	272	“ Well what do you think of the Dashville , Fitz ? ”
144660	144668	144654	144655	Mr Berners	272	“ I saw you dancing with her . ”
144669	144711	144605	144607	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ I ca n’t bear her : she sets up to be natural and is only rude ; mistakes insolence for innocence ; says everything which comes first to her lips and thinks she is gay when she is only giddy . ”
144712	144717	144719	144720	Lady Joan	403	“ ‘ Tis brilliant , ”
144725	144731	144732	144732	he	270	“ When you are here , ”
144735	144778	144732	144732	he	270	“ And yet a ball in a gallery of art is not in my opinion in good taste . The associations which are suggested by sculpture are not festive . Repose is the characteristic of sculpture . Do not you think so ? ”
144779	144782	144784	144785	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Decidedly , ”
144787	144823	144784	144785	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ We danced in the gallery at Matfield this Christmas , and I thought all the time that a gallery is not the place for a ball ; it is too long and too narrow . ”
144836	144849	144851	144852	Lord Milford	260	“ I wonder if Valentine has sold that bay cob of his , ”
144859	144863	144865	144866	Lord Eugene	274	“ I wonder , ”
144868	144878	144880	144881	Lord Milford	260	“ I wish you would ask him , Eugene , ”
144883	144898	144880	144881	Lord Milford	260	“ you understand , I do n’t want him to know I want it . ”
144899	144909	144911	144912	Lord Eugene	274	“ ‘ Tis such a bore to ask questions , ”
144914	144920	144911	144912	Lord Eugene	274	“ Shall we carry Chichester ? ”
144929	144945	144946	144946	she	365	“ Oh ! do not speak to me ever again of the House of Commons , ”
144955	144991	144946	144946	she	365	“ What use is winning our way by units ? It may take years . Lord Protocol says that ‘ one is enough . ’ That Jamaica affair has really ended by greatly strengthening them . ”
144992	144998	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ I do not despair , ”
145003	145029	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ The unequivocal adhesion of the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine is a great thing . It gives us the northern division at a dissolution . ”
145030	145052	144946	144946	she	365	“ That is to say in five years , my dear Lady Firebrace . The country will be ruined before that . ”
145053	145070	144946	144946	she	365	“ We shall see . Is it a settled thing between Lady Joan and Mr Mountchesney ? ”
145071	145141	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Not the slightest foundation . Lady Joan is a most sensible girl , as well as a most charming person and my dear friend . She is not in a hurry to marry , and quite right . If indeed Frederick were a little more steady — but nothing shall ever induce me to consent to his marrying her , unless I thought he was worthy of her . ”
145142	145150	145152	145153	Lady Firebrace	365	“ You are such a good mother , ”
145155	145175	145152	145153	Lady Firebrace	365	“ and such a good friend ! I am glad to hear it is not true about Mr Mountchesney . ”
145176	145232	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ If you could only help me , my dear Lady Firebrace , to put an end to that affair between Frederick and Lady Wallington . It is so silly , and getting talked about ; and in his heart too he really loves Lady Joan ; only he is scarcely aware of it himself . ”
145233	145239	145241	145242	Lady Firebrace	365	“ We must manage it , ”
145251	145289	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Do , my dear creature ; speak to him ; he is very much guided by your opinion . Tell him everybody is laughing at him , and any other little thing that occurs to you . ”
145290	145296	145298	145299	Lady Marney	4580	“ I will come directly , ”
145304	145311	145298	145299	Lady Marney	4580	“ only let me see this . ”
145312	145378	145000	145001	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Well , I will bring Huntingford here . Mind you speak to him a great deal ; take his arm , and go down to supper with him if you can . He is a very nice sensible young fellow , and you will like him very much I am sure ; a little shy at first , but he only wants bringing out . ”
145420	145426	145428	145429	Lady Marney	4583	“ This dreadful Lord Huntingford ! ”
145431	145438	145440	145440	Egremont	264	“ Jermyn and I will intefere , ”
145442	145447	145440	145440	Egremont	264	“ and help you . ”
145448	145453	145455	145456	Lady Marney	4584	“ No , no , ”
145461	145467	145458	145458	her	4584	“ I must do it . ”
145489	145505	145472	145476	a groom of the chambers	4585	“ Your servant , Mr Egremont , is here and wishes to see you instantly . ”
145506	145529	145531	145531	he	4585	“ My servant ! Instantly ! What the deuce can be the matter ? I hope the Albany is not on fire , ”
145556	145579	145549	145550	his valet	4590	“ A porter has brought this letter , sir , and I thought it best to come on with it at once . ”
145594	145612	145613	145613	Egremont	290	“ This letter must be instantly carried by the bearer to Mr Egremont wherever he may be . ”
145756	145762	145742	145743	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Do you see that ? ”
145763	145768	145742	145743	Lady Firebrace	365	“ No ! what ? ”
145769	145811	145742	145743	Lady Firebrace	365	“ Do not look as if you observed them : Lord John and Mr Egremont , in the furthest window , they have been there these ten minutes in the most earnest conversation . I am afraid we have lost him . ”
145812	145820	145822	145824	Lady St Julians	365	“ I have always been expecting it , ”
145826	145859	145822	145824	Lady St Julians	365	“ He breakfasts with that Mr Trenchard and does all those sorts of things . Men who breakfast out are generally liberals . Have not you observed that ? I wonder why ? ”
145860	145868	145870	145871	Lady Firebrace	365	“ It shows a restless revolutionary mind , ”
145873	145892	145870	145871	Lady Firebrace	365	“ that can settle to nothing ; but must be running after gossip the moment they are awake . ”
145893	145896	145898	145900	Lady St Julians	365	“ Yes , ”
145902	145963	145898	145900	Lady St Julians	365	“ I think those men who breakfast out or who give breakfasts are generally dangerous characters ; at least , I would not trust them . The whigs are very fond of that sort of thing . If Mr Egremont joins them , I really do not see what shadow of a claim Lady Deloraine can urge to have anything . ”
145964	145971	145973	145974	Lady Firebrace	365	“ She only wants one thing , ”
145976	145986	145973	145974	Lady Firebrace	365	“ and we know she can not have that . ”
145987	145990	145898	145900	Lady St Julians	365	“ Why ? ”
145991	146000	145898	145900	Lady St Julians	365	“ Because Lady St Julians will have it . ”
146001	146007	145973	145974	Lady Firebrace	365	“ You are too kind , ”
146012	146026	145973	145974	Lady Firebrace	365	“ No , I assure you Lord Masque told me that her Majesty — ”
146033	146036	146029	146030	Lady Firehrace	712	“ Well , ”
146045	146061	145898	145900	Lady St Julians	365	“ I do not think I am one who am likely to forget my friends . ”
146062	146071	146073	146074	Lady Firebrace	365	“ That I am sure you are not ! ”
146169	146174	146176	146176	Gerard	430	“ Depend upon it , ”
146178	146238	146176	146176	Gerard	430	“ we must stick to the National Holiday : we can do nothing effectively , unless the movement is simultaneous . They have not troops to cope with a simultaneous movement , and the Holiday is the only machinery to secure unity of action . No work for six weeks , and the rights of Labour will be acknowledged ! ”
146239	146256	146258	146271	a pale young man , very thin but with a countenance of remarkable energy	4604	“ We shall never be able to make the people unanimous in a cessation of labour , ”
146273	146299	146258	146271	a pale young man , very thin but with a countenance of remarkable energy	4604	“ The selfish instincts will come into play and will baulk our political object , while a great increase of physical suffering must be inevitable . ”
146300	146306	146308	146314	a middle - aged , thickset man	4605	“ It might be done , ”
146321	146340	146308	146314	a middle - aged , thickset man	4605	“ If the Unions were really to put their shoulder to the wheel , it might be done . ”
146341	146349	146351	146351	Gerard	430	“ And if it is not done , ”
146353	146384	146351	146351	Gerard	430	“ what do you propose ? The people ask you to guide them . Shrink at such a conjuncture , and our influence over them is forfeited and justly forfeited . ”
146385	146394	146396	146398	the young man	4545	“ I am for partial but extensive insurrections , ”
146400	146471	146396	146398	the young man	4545	“ Sufficient in extent and number to demand all the troops and yet to distract the military movements . We can count on Birmingham again , if we act at once before their new Police Act is in force ; Manchester is ripe ; and several of the cotton towns ; but above all I have letters that assure me that at this moment we can do anything in Wales . ”

146487	146513	146482	146482	Wilkins	332	“ And trade is so bad that the Holiday at all events must take place there , for the masters themselves are extinguishing their furnaces . “

146833	146837	146809	146809	You	4620	” said Gerard . “

146937	147002	146925	146925	We	4609	” The pale young man read the draft of the proclamation ; it was canvassed and criticised sentence by sentence ; altered , approved : finally put to the vote , and unanimously carried . On the morrow it was to be posted in every thoroughfare of the metropolis , and circulated in every great city of the provinces and populous district of labour . “

147145	147175	147142	147142	He	716	” said Gerard . The door of the chamber opened and a woman entered . Pale , agitated , exhausted , she advanced to them in the glimmering light . “
147180	147187	147188	147188	Sybil	430	” said several of the council . “
147190	147257	147188	147188	Sybil	430	” exclaimed the astonished Gerard , and he rose from his seat . She caught the arm of her father , and leant on him for a moment in silence . Then looking up with an expression that seemed to indicate she was rallying her last energies , she said , in a voice low yet so distinct that it reached the ear of all present , “
147268	147321	147188	147188	Sybil	430	” The men rose hastily from their seats ; they approached the messenger of danger ; Gerard waved them off , for he perceived his daughter was sinking . Gently he placed her in his chair ; she was sensible , for she grasped his arm , and she murmured — still she murmured—“fly

147411	147452	147453	147453	She	1827	” She looked up to her father ; a glance as it were of devotion and despair : her lips moved , but they refused their office and expressed no words . There was a deep silence in the room . “
147457	147462	147453	147453	She	1827	” said her father . “
147465	147479	147480	147480	I	0	” said the young man , and he hurried away to obtain some . “

147731	147738	147728	147729	the serjeant	4648	“ six foot two without shoes . ”
147739	147745	147746	147746	he	7046	“ Whoever I may he , ”

147810	147856	147803	147803	Gerard	424	“ but this maiden , my daughter , knows nothing of this meeting or its purpose . She has but just arrived , and how she traced me I know not . You will let me recover her , and then permit her to depart . ”
147857	147872	147728	147729	the serjeant	4648	“ Ca n’t let no one out of my sight found in this room . ”
147873	147933	147728	147729	the serjeant	4648	“ But she is innocent , even if we were guilty ; she could be nothing else but innocent , for she knows nothing of this meeting and its business , both of which I am prepared at the right time and place to vindicate . She entered this room a moment only before yourself , entered and swooned . ”
147934	147958	147803	147803	Gerard	424	“ Ca n’t help that ; must take her ; she can tell the magistrate anything she likes , and he must decide . ”
147959	147971	147728	147729	the serjeant	4648	“ Why you are not afraid of a young girl ? ? ”
147972	148000	147728	147729	the serjeant	4648	“ I am afraid of nothing ; but I must do my duty . Come we have no time for talk . I must take you both . ”
148001	148012	147803	147803	Gerard	424	“ By G — d you shall not take her ; ”
148030	148072	148019	148019	Gerard	424	“ You know , I find , my height : my strength does not shame my stature ! Look to yourself . Advance and touch this maiden , and I will fell you and your minions like oxen at their pasture . ”
148087	148091	148092	148092	he	8451	“ You see , ”
148095	148101	148092	148092	he	8451	“ resistance is quite vain . ”
148102	148134	148073	148074	The inspector	8451	“ For slaves and cravens , but not for us . I say you shall not touch her till I am dead at her feet . Now , do your worst . ”
148272	148280	148282	148283	the serjeant	4648	“ Well you are a queer chap , ”
148285	148318	148282	148283	the serjeant	4648	“ but I must do my duty . I shall give orders to my men to seize you , and if you resist them , I shall shoot you through the head . ”

149431	149448	149452	149452	your	4729	” said Sybil to the inspector in a tone of mournful desolation and of mild sweetness , “
149457	149469	149452	149452	your	4729	” and she extended him the letter , which he read . “
149480	149498	149452	149452	your	4729	” said the inspector with emotion , for the spirit of Sybil had already controlled his nature , “
149520	149521	149522	149522	I	0	” “
149530	149540	149522	149522	I	0	” said Sybil , and she addressed the letter to “
149547	150554	150556	150556	you	4733	” adding that superscription the sight of which had so agitated Egremont at Deloraine House . Night waned : and Sybil was at length slumbering . The cold that precedes the dawn had stolen over her senses , and calmed the excitement of her nerves . She was lying on the ground , covered with a cloak of which her kind hostess had prevailed on her to avail herself , and was partly resting on a chair , at which she had been praying when exhausted nature gave way and she slept . Her bonnet had fallen off , and her rich hair , which had broken loose , covered her shoulder like a mantle . Her slumber was brief and disturbed , but it had in a great degree soothed the irritated brain . She woke however in terror from a dream in which she had been dragged through a mob and carried before a tribunal . The coarse jeers , the brutal threats , still echoed in her ear ; and when she looked around , she could not for some moments recall or recognise the scene . In one corner of the room , which was sufficiently spacious , was a bed occupied by the still sleeping wife of the inspector ; there was a great deal of heavy furniture of dark mahogany ; a bureau , several chests of drawers : over the mantel was a piece of faded embroidery framed , that had been executed by the wife of the inspector when she was at school , and opposite to it , on the other side , were portraits of Dick Curtis and Dutch Sam , who had been the tutors of her husband , and now lived as heroes in his memory . Slowly came over Sybil the consciousness of the dreadful eve that was past . She remained for some time on her knees in silent prayer : then stepping lightly , she approached the window . It was barred . The room which she inhabited was a high story of the house ; it looked down upon one of those half tawdry , half squalid streets that one finds in the vicinities of our theatres ; some wretched courts , haunts of misery and crime , blended with gin palaces and slang taverns , burnished and brazen ; not a being was stirring . It was just that single hour of the twenty - four when crime ceases , debauchery is exhausted , and even desolation finds a shelter . It was dawn , but still grey . For the first time since she had been a prisoner , Sybil was alone . A prisoner , and in a few hours to be examined before a public tribunal ! Her heart sank . How far her father had committed himself was entirely a mystery to her ; but the language of Morley , and all that she had witnessed , impressed her with the conviction that he was deeply implicated . He had indeed spoken in their progress to the police office with confidence as to the future , but then he had every motive to encourage her in her despair , and to support her under the overwhelming circumstances in which she was so suddenly involved . What a catastrophe to all his high aspirations ! It tore her heart to think of him ! As for herself , she would still hope that ultimately she might obtain justice , but she could scarcely flatter herself that at the first any distinction would be made between her case and that of the other prisoners . She would probably be committed for trial ; and though her innocence on that occasion might be proved , she would have been a prisoner in the interval , instead of devoting all her energies in freedom to the support and assistance of her father . She shrank , too , with all the delicacy of a woman , from the impending examination in open court before the magistrate . Supported by her convictions , vindicating a sacred principle , there was no trial perhaps to which Sybil would not have been superior , and no test of her energy and faith which she would not have triumphantly encountered ; but to be hurried like a criminal to the bar of a police office , suspected of the lowest arts of sedition , ignorant even of what she was accused , without a conviction to support her or the ennobling consciousness of having failed at least in a great cause ; all these were circumstances which infinitely disheartened and depressed her . She felt sometimes that she should be unable to meet the occasion : had it not been for Gerard she could almost have wished that death might release her from its base perplexities . Was there any hope ? In the agony of her soul she had confided last night in one ; with scarcely a bewildering hope that he could save her . He might not have the power , the opportunity , the wish . He might shrink from mixing himself up with such characters and such transactions ; he might not have received her hurried appeal in time to act upon it , even if the desire of her soul were practicable . A thousand difficulties , a thousand obstacles now occurred to her ; and she felt her hopelessness . Yet notwithstanding her extreme sorrow , and the absence of all surrounding objects to soothe and to console her , the expanding dawn revived and even encouraged Sybil . In spite of the confined situation , she could still partially behold a sky dappled with rosy hues ; a sense of freshness touched her : she could not resist endeavouring to open the window and feel the air , notwithstanding all her bars . The wife of the inspector stirred , and half slumbering , murmured , “
150588	150680	150579	150579	I	0	” This woman , like her husband , was naturally kind , and at once influenced by Sybil . They both treated her as a superior being ; and if , instead of the daughter of a lowly prisoner and herself a prisoner , she had been the noble child of a captive minister of state , they could not have extended to her a more humble and even delicate solicitude . It had not yet struck seven , and the wife of the inspector suddenly stopping and listening , said , “
150686	150727	150681	150681	They	4735	” and then , after a moment ’s pause , she opened the door , at which she stood for some time endeavouring to catch the meaning of the mysterious sounds . She looked back at Sybil , and saying , “
150736	150876	150730	150730	I	0	” she withdrew , shutting the door . In little more than two hours , as Sybil had been informed , she would be summoned to her examination . It was a sickening thought . Hope vanished as the catastrophe advanced . She almost accused herself for having without authority sought out her father ; it had been as regarded him a fruitless mission , and , by its results on her , had aggravated his present sorrows and perplexities . Her mind again recurred to him whose counsel had indirectly prompted her rash step , and to whose aid in her infinite hopelessness she had appealed . The woman who had all this time been only standing on the landing - place without the door , now re - entered with a puzzled and curious air , saying , “
150889	150890	150891	150892	Some one	8258	” “
150896	150902	150891	150892	Some one	8258	” Simple yet agitating words . “
150907	150915	150891	150892	Some one	8258	” enquired Sybil in a trembling tone , “
150924	150925	150891	150892	Some one	8258	” “
150928	150936	150891	150892	Some one	8258	” said the wife of the inspector . “
150958	151105	151106	151106	You	4742	” and at this moment some one tapped at the door . The woman returned to the door and reopened it , and some words were spoken which did not reach Sybil , whose heart beat violently as a wild thought rushed over her mind . The suspense was so intolerable , her agitation so great , that she was on the point of advancing and asking if — when the door was shut and she was again left alone . She threw herself on the bed . It seemed to her that she had lost all control over her intelligence . All thought and feeling merged in that deep suspense when the order of our being seems to stop and quiver as it were upon its axis . The woman returned ; her countenance was glad . Perceiving the agitation of Sybil , she said , “
151136	151137	151128	151131	the Secretary of State	9576	” “
151142	151150	151128	151131	the Secretary of State	9576	” said Sybil springing from her chair . “
151155	151156	151152	151152	he	4746	” “
151163	151168	151158	151161	the Secretary of State	9576	” said the woman . “
151180	151181	151173	151173	I	0	” “
151229	151230	151213	151213	he	2325	” “
151239	151270	151234	151234	I	0	” The inspector at this moment tapped again at the door and then entered . He caught the last request of Sybil , and replied to it in the negative . “
151276	151280	151234	151234	I	0	” he said ; “
151379	152043	152059	152059	you	4761	” Bidding farewell to his kind wife , and leaving many weeping messages for her father , Sybil descended the stairs with the inspector . The office was not opened : a couple of policemen only were in the passage , and as she appeared one of them went forth to clear the way for Sybil to the coach that was waiting for her . A milkwoman or two , a stray chimney - sweep , a pieman with his smoking apparatus , and several of those nameless nothings that always congregate and make the nucleus of a mob — probably our young friends who had been passing the night in Hyde Park — had already gathered round the office door . They were dispersed , and returned again and took up their position at a more respectful distance , abusing with many racy execrations that ancient body that from a traditionary habit they still called the New Police . A man in a loose white great coat , his countenance concealed by a shawl which was wound round his neck and by his slouched hat , assisted Sybil into the coach , and pressed her hand at the same time with great tenderness . Then he mounted the box by the driver and ordered him to make the best of his way to Smith ’s Square . With a beating heart , Sybil leant back in the coach and clasped her hands . Her brain was too wild to think : the incidents of her life during the last four - and - twenty hours had been so strange and rapid that she seemed almost to resign any quality of intelligent control over her fortunes , and to deliver herself up to the shifting visions of the startling dream . His voice had sounded in her ear as his hand had touched hers . And on those tones her memory lingered , and that pressure had reached her heart . What tender devotion ! What earnest fidelity ! What brave and romantic faith ! Had she breathed on some talisman , and called up some obedient genie to her aid , the spirit could not have been more loyal , nor the completion of her behest more ample and precise . She passed the towers of the church of St John : of the saint who had seemed to guard over her in the exigency of her existence . She was approaching her threshold ; the blood left her cheek , her heart palpitated . The coach stopped . Trembling and timid she leant upon his arm and yet dared not look upon his face . They entered the house ; they were in the room where two months before he had knelt to her in vain , which yesterday had been the scene of so many heart - rending passions . As in some delicious dream , when the enchanted fancy has traced for a time with coherent bliss the stream of bright adventures and sweet and touching phrase , there comes at last some wild gap in the flow of fascination , and by means which we can not trace , and by an agency which we can not pursue , we find ourselves in some enrapturing situation that is as it were the ecstasy of our life ; so it happened now , that while in clear and precise order there seemed to flit over the soul of Sybil all that had passed , all that he had done , all that she felt — by some mystical process which memory could not recall , Sybil found herself pressed to the throbbing heart of Egremont , nor shrinking from the embrace which expressed the tenderness of his devoted love ! Mowbray was in a state of great excitement . It was Saturday evening : the mills were closed ; the news had arrived of the arrest of the Delegate . “

153021	153453	152980	152980	we	4776	” This evening it was settled among the principal champions of the cause of Labour , among whom Devilsdust was now included , that on the morrow there should be a monster meeting on the Moor to take into consideration the arrest of the delegate of Mowbray . Such was the complete organisation of this district that by communicating with the various lodges of the Trades Unions fifty thousand persons , or even double that number , could within four - and - twenty hours on a great occasion and on a favourable day be brought into the field . The morrow being a day of rest was favourable , and the seizure of their cherished delegate was a stimulating cause . The excitement was great , the enthusiasm earnest and deep . There was enough distress to make people discontented without depressing them . And Devilsdust after attending a council of the Union , retired to rest and dreamed of strong speeches and spicy resolutions , bands and banners , the cheers of assembled thousands , and the eventual triumph of the sacred rights . The post of the next morning brought great and stirring news to Mowbray . Gerard had undergone his examination at Bow Street . It was a long and laborious one ; he was committed for trial for a seditious conspiracy , but he was held to bail . The bail demanded was heavy ; but it was prepared and instantly proffered . His sureties were Morley and a Mr Hatton . By this post Morley wrote to his friends , apprising them that both Gerard and himself intended to leave London instantly , and that they might be expected to arrive at Mowbray by the evening train . The monster meeting of the Moor it was instantly resolved should be converted into a triumphant procession , or rather be preceded by one . Messengers on horseback were sent to all the neighbouring towns to announce the great event . Every artisan felt as a Moslemin summoned by the sacred standard . All went forth with their wives and their children to hail the return of the patriot and the martyr . The Trades of Mowbray mustered early in the morning , and in various processions took possession of all the churches . Their great pride was entirely to fill the church of Mr St Lys , who not daunted by their demonstration , and seizing the offered opportunity , suppressed the sermon with which he had supplied himself and preached to them an extemporary discourse on “
153461	154159	154160	154160	I	0	” In the dissenting chapels thanksgivings were publicly offered that bail had been accepted for Walter Gerard . After the evening service , which the Unions again attended , they formed in the High Street and lined it with their ranks and banners . Every half hour a procession arrived from some neighbouring town with its music and streaming flags . Each was received by Warner or some other member of the managing committee , who assigned to them their appointed position , which they took up without confusion , nor was the general order for a moment disturbed . Sometimes a large party arrived without music or banners , but singing psalms and headed by their minister ; sometimes the children walked together , the women following , then the men each with a ribbon of the same colour in his hat : all hurried , yet spontaneous and certain , indications how mankind under the influence of high and earnest feelings recur instantly to ceremony and form ; how when the imagination is excited it appeals to the imagination , and requires for its expression something beyond the routine of daily life . It was arranged that the moment the train arrived and the presence of Gerard was ascertained , the Trade in position nearest to the station should commence the hymn of Labour , which was instantly to be taken up by its neighbour , and so on in succession , so that by an almost electrical agency the whole population should almost simultaneously be assured of his arrival . At half past six o’clock the bell announced that the train was in sight ; a few minutes afterwards Dandy Mick hurried up to the leader of the nearest Trade , spoke a few words , and instantly the signal was given and the hymn commenced . It was taken up as the steeples of a great city in the silence of the night take up the new hour that has just arrived ; one by one the mighty voices rose till they all blended in one vast waving sea of sound . Warner and some others welcomed Gerard and Morley , and ushered them , totally unprepared for such a reception , to an open carriage drawn by four white horses that was awaiting them . Orders were given that there was to be no cheering or any irregular clamour . Alone was heard the hymn . As the carriage passed each Trade , they followed and formed in procession behind it ; thus all had the opportunity of beholding their chosen chief , and he the proud consolation of looking on the multitude who thus enthusiastically recognised the sovereignty of his services . The interminable population , the mighty melody , the incredible order , the simple yet awful solemnity , this representation of the great cause to which she was devoted under an aspect that at once satisfied the reason , captivated the imagination , and elevated the heart — her admiration of her father , thus ratified as it were by the sympathy of a nation — added to all the recent passages of her life teeming with such strange and trying interest , overcame Sybil . The tears fell down her cheek as the carriage bore away her father , while she remained under the care of one unknown to the people of Mowbray , but who had accompanied her from London,—this was Hatton . The last light of the sun was shed over the Moor when Gerard reached it , and the Druids ’ altar and its surrounding crags were burnished with its beam . It was the night following the day after the return of Gerard to Mowbray . Morley , who had lent to him and Sybil his cottage in the dale , was at the office of his newspaper , the Mowbray Phalanx , where he now resided . He was alone in his room writing , occasionally rising from his seat and pacing the chamber , when some one knocked at his door . Receiving a permission to come in , there entered Hatton . “

157484	157682	157683	157683	I	0	” Two days after this conversation in Downing Street , a special messenger arrived at Marney Abbey from the Lord Lieutenant of the county , the Duke of Fitz - Aquitaine . Immediately after reading the despatch of which he was the bearer , there was a great bustle in the house ; Lady Marney was sent for to her husband ’s library and there enjoined immediately to write various letters which were to prevent certain expected visitors from arriving ; Captain Grouse was in and out the same library every five minutes , receiving orders and counter orders , and finally mounting his horse was flying about the neighbourhood with messages and commands . All this stir signified that the Marney regiment of Yeomanry were to be called out directly . Lord Marney who had succeeded in obtaining a place in the Household and was consequently devoted to the institutions of the country , was full of determination to uphold them ; but at the same time with characteristic prudence was equally resolved that the property principally protected should be his own , and that the order of his own district should chiefly engage his solicitude . “
157698	157706	157688	157689	the Duke	1216	” said Lord Marney to Captain Grouse . “
157780	158084	158087	158087	he	4909	” Egremont , between whom and his brother a sort of bad - tempered good understanding had of late years to a certain degree flourished , in spite of Lord Marney remaining childless , which made him hate Egremont with double distilled virulence , and chiefly by the affectionate manoeuvres of their mother , but whose annual visits to Marney had generally been limited to the yeomanry week , arrived from London the same day as the letter of the Lord Lieutenant , as he had learnt that his brother ’s regiment , in which he commanded a troop , as well as the other yeomanry corps in the North of England , must immediately take the field . Five years had elapsed since the commencement of our history , and they had brought apparently much change to the character of the brother of Lord Marney . He had become , especially during the last two or three years , silent and reserved ; he rarely entered society ; even the company of those who were once his intimates had ceased to attract him ; he was really a melancholy man . The change in his demeanour was observed by all ; his mother and his sister - in - law were the only persons who endeavoured to penetrate its cause , and sighed over the failure of their sagacity . Quit the world and the world forgets you ; and Egremont would have soon been a name no longer mentioned in those brilliant saloons which he once adorned , had not occasionally a sensation , produced by an effective speech in the House of Commons , recalled his name to his old associates , who then remembered the pleasant hours passed in his society and wondered why he never went anywhere now . “

158314	158998	158306	158306	I	0	” Baffled sympathy was the cause of Egremont ’s gloom . It is the secret spring of most melancholy . He loved and loved in vain . The conviction that his passion , though hopeless , was not looked upon with disfavour , only made him the more wretched , for the disappointment is more acute in proportion as the chance is better . He had never seen Sybil since the morning he quitted her in Smith ’s Square , immediately before her departure for the North . The trial of Gerard had taken place at the assizes of that year : he had been found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment in York Castle ; the interference of Egremont both in the House of Commons and with the government saved him from the felon confinement with which he was at first threatened , and from which assuredly state prisoners should be exempt . During this effort some correspondence had taken place between Egremont and Sybil , which he would willingly have encouraged and maintained ; but it ceased nevertheless with its subject . Sybil , through the influential interference of Ursula Trafford , lived at the convent at York during the imprisonment of her father , and visited him daily . The anxiety to take the veil which had once characterised Sybil had certainly waned . Perhaps her experience of life had impressed her with the importance of fulfilling vital duties . Her father , though he had never opposed her wish , had never encouraged it ; and he had now increased and interesting claims on her devotion . He had endured great trials , and had fallen on adverse fortunes . Sybil would look at him , and though his noble frame was still erect and his countenance still displayed that mixture of frankness and decision which had distinguished it of yore , she could not conceal from herself that there were ravages which time could not have produced . A year and a half of imprisonment had shaken to its centre a frame born for action , and shrinking at all times from the resources of sedentary life . The disappointment of high hopes had jarred and tangled even the sweetness of his noble disposition . He needed solicitude and solace : and Sybil resolved that if vigilance and sympathy could soothe an existence that would otherwise be embittered , these guardian angels should at least hover over the life of her father . When the term of his imprisonment had ceased , Gerard had returned with his daughter to Mowbray . Had he deigned to accept the offers of his friends , he need not have been anxious as to his future . A public subscription for his service had been collected : Morley , who was well to do in the world , for the circulation of the Mowbray Phalanx daily increased with the increasing sufferings of the people , offered his friend to share his house and purse : Hatton was munificent ; there was no limit either to his offers or his proffered services . But all were declined ; Gerard would live by labour . The post he had occupied at Mr Trafford ’s was not vacant even if that gentleman had thought fit again to receive him ; but his reputation as a first - rate artizan soon obtained him good employment , though on this occasion in the town of Mowbray , which for the sake of his daughter he regretted . He had no pleasant home now for Sybil , but he had the prospect of one , and until he obtained possession of it , Sybil sought a refuge , which had been offered to her from the first , with her kindest and dearest friend ; so that at this period of our history , she was again an inmate of the convent at Mowbray , whither her father and Morley had attended her the eve of the day she had first visited the ruins of Marney Abbey . “

162304	162638	162296	162297	Lady Bardolf	737	” Lord and Lady Bardolf were not alone ; they were accompanied by a gentleman who had been staying on a visit at Firebrace , and who , being acquainted with Lord de Mowbray , had paid his respects to the castle in his way to London . This gentleman was the individual who had elevated them to the peerage — Mr Hatton . A considerable intimacy had sprung up between him and his successful clients . Firebrace was an old place rebuilt in the times of the Tudors , but with something of its more ancient portions remaining , and with a storehouse of muniments that had escaped the civil wars . Hatton revelled in them , and in pursuing his researches , had already made discoveries which might perhaps place the coronet of the earldom of Lovel on the brow of the former champion of the baronetage , who now however never mentioned the Order . Lord de Mowbray was well content to see Mr Hatton , a gentleman in whom he did not repose the less confidence , because his advice given him three years ago , respecting the writ of right and the claim upon his estate had proved so discreet and correct . Acting on that advice Lord de Mowbray had instructed his lawyers to appear to the action without entering into any unnecessary explanation of the merits of his case . He counted on the accuracy of Mr Hatton ’s judgment , that the claim would not be pursued ; and he was right ; after some fencing and preliminary manoeuvring , the claim had not been pursued . Lord de Mowbray therefore , always gracious , was disposed to accord a very distinguished reception to his confidential counsellor . He pressed very much his guests to remain with him some days , and though that was not practicable , Mr Hatton promised that he would not leave the neighbourhood without paying another visit to the castle . “
162645	162654	162640	162640	you	5040	” said Mr Hatton to Lord de Mowbray . “
162664	162670	162656	162656	I	0	” said Lord de Mowbray . “
162713	162723	162725	162726	Lady Bardolf	737	“ I am sorry for poor Lady St Julians , ”
162732	162774	162725	162726	Lady Bardolf	737	“ It must be such a disappointment , and she has had so many ; but I understand there is nobody to blame but herself . If she had only left the Prince alone , but she would not be quiet ! ”
162775	162782	162834	162836	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ And where are the Deloraines ? ”
162783	162821	162725	162726	Lady Bardolf	737	“ They are at Munich ; with which they are delighted . And Lady Deloraine writes me that Mr Egremont has promised to join them there . If he do , they mean to winter at Rome . ”
162822	162832	162834	162836	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ Somebody said he was going to be married , ”
162838	162846	162848	162849	Lady Bardolf	737	“ His mother wishes him to marry , ”
162851	162858	162848	162849	Lady Bardolf	737	“ but I have heard nothing . ”
162871	162891	162892	162892	he	270	“ How delightful in the country in August to meet somebody that you have seen in London in June ! ”
162895	162944	162892	162892	he	270	“ Now , dear Lady Bardolf do tell me something , for you can conceive nothing so triste as we are here . We never get a letter . Joan only corresponds with philosophers and Maud with clergymen ; and none of my friends ever write to me . ”
162945	162953	162848	162849	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Perhaps you never write to them ? ”
162954	163080	162848	162849	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Well , I never have been a letter writer ; because really I never wanted to write or to be written to . I always knew what was going on because I was on the spot ; I was doing the things that people were writing letters about — but now not being in the world any longer , doing nothing , living in the country — and the country in August — I should like to receive letters every day , but I do not know who to fix upon as a correspondent . Eugene de Vere will not write , Milford can not ; and as for Fitz - heron he is so very selfish , he always wants his letters answered . ”
163081	163087	163089	163090	Lady Bardolf	737	“ That is very unreasonable , ”
163092	163169	163089	163090	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Besides what can they tell me at this moment ? They have gone to the Moors and are enjoying themselves . They asked me to go with them , but I could not go , because you see I could not leave Joan ; though why I could not leave her , I really can not understand , because Egerton has got some moors this year , and he leaves Lady Augusta with her father . ”
163362	163365	163367	163368	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Yes , ”
163370	163387	163367	163368	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ but I thought Joan was going with you , and that you would be shopping . ”
163388	163404	163406	163407	Lord Bardolf	635	“ It was a good thing our House was adjourned before these disturbances in Lancashire , ”
163413	163430	163432	163434	Lord de Mowbray	402	“ The best thing we can all do is to be on our estates I believe , ”
163436	163448	163450	163451	Lord Bardolf	635	“ My neighbour Marney is in a great state of excitement , ”
163453	163459	163450	163451	Lord Bardolf	635	“ all his yeomanry out . ”
163460	163468	163367	163368	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ But he is quiet at Marney ? ”
163469	163550	163450	163451	Lord Bardolf	635	“ In a way ; but these fires puzzle us . Marney will not believe that the condition of the labourer has anything to do with them ; and he certainly is a very acute man . But still I do n’t know what to say to it . The poor - law is very unpopular in my parish . Marney will have it , that the incendiaries are all strangers hired by the anti - Corn - law League . ”
163551	163559	163561	163562	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Ah ! here is Lady Joan , ”
163574	163580	163568	163569	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ My dearest Lady Joan ! ”
163581	163585	163587	163588	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Why Joan , ”
163590	163610	163587	163588	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Maud has been to Mowbray , and heard the most delicious singing . Why did we not go ? ”
163611	163621	163450	163451	Lord Bardolf	635	“ I did mention it to you , Alfred . ”
163622	163735	163568	163569	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ I remember you said something about going to Mowbray , and that you wanted to go to several places . But there is nothing I hate so much as shopping . It bores me more than anything . And you are so peculiarly long when you are shopping . But singing , and beautiful singing in a Catholic chapel by a woman ; perhaps a beautiful woman , that is quite a different thing , and I should have been amused , which nobody seems ever to think of here . I do not know how you find it , Lady Bardolf , but the country to me in August is a something;”—and
163750	163759	163761	163762	Mr Hatton	425	“ And you did not see this singer ? ”
163777	163805	163761	163762	Mr Hatton	425	“ I did not , but they tell me she is most beautiful ; something extraordinary ; I tried to see her , but it was impossible . ”
163806	163813	163568	163569	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Is she a professional singer ? ”
163814	163831	163761	163762	Mr Hatton	425	“ I should imagine not ; a daughter of one of the Mowbray people I believe . ”
163832	163846	163848	163849	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Let us have her over to the Castle , Lady de Mowbray , ”
163851	163856	163848	163849	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ If you like , ”
163867	163878	163880	163881	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ Well at last I have got something to do , ”
163883	163904	163880	163881	Mr Mountchesney	270	“ I will ride over to Mowbray , find out the beautiful singer , and bring her to the Castle . ”
164149	164157	164159	164159	Sybil	430	“ Yes , I mourn over them , ”
164161	164230	164159	164159	Sybil	430	“ the deep convictions that made me look forward to the cloister as my home . Is it that the world has assoiled my soul ? Yet I have not tasted of worldly joys ; all that I have known of it has been suffering and tears . They will return , these visions of my sacred youth , dear friend , tell me that they will return ! ”
164231	164254	164334	164334	her	430	“ I too have had visions in my youth , Sybil , and not of the cloister , yet am I here . ”
164255	164262	164264	164264	Sybil	430	“ And what should I infer ? ”
164267	164298	164264	164264	Sybil	430	“ That my visions were of the world , and brought me to the cloister , and that yours were of the cloister and have brought you to the world . ”
164299	164305	164307	164307	Sybil	430	“ My heart is sad , ”
164309	164318	164307	164307	Sybil	430	“ and the sad should seek the shade . ”
164319	164331	164332	164332	Sybil	430	“ It is troubled , my child , rather than sorrowful . ”
164337	164343	164345	164345	Ursula	690	“ Yes , my child , ”
164347	164375	164345	164345	Ursula	690	“ the world has taught you that there are affections which the cloister can neither satisfy nor supply . Ah ! Sybil , I too have loved . ”
164407	164414	164402	164402	she	430	“ No , no , no . ”
164415	164518	164520	164520	Ursula	690	“ Yes , it is his spirit that hovers over your life , Sybil ; and in vain you would forget what haunts your heart . One not less gifted than him ; as good , as gentle , as gracious ; once too breathed in my ear the accents of joy . He was , like myself , the child of an old house , and Nature had invested him with every quality that can dazzle and can charm . But his heart was as pure , and his soul as lofty , as his intellect and frame were bright , — ”
164535	164539	164523	164523	Sybil	430	“ Speak on . ”
164540	164549	164551	164551	Ursula	690	“ The dreams of by - gone days , ”
164558	164618	164620	164620	Ursula	690	“ the wild sorrows than I can recall , and yet feel that I was wisely chastened . He was stricken in his virtuous pride , the day before he was to have led me to that altar where alone I found the consolation that never fails . And thus closed some years of human love , my Sybil , ”
164628	164685	164620	164620	Ursula	690	“ The world for a season crossed their fair current , and a power greater than the world forbade their banns ; but they are hallowed ; memory is my sympathy ; it is soft and free , and when he came here to enquire after you , his presence and agitated heart recalled the past . ”
164686	164694	164696	164696	Sybil	430	“ It is too wild a thought , ”
164698	164729	164696	164696	Sybil	430	“ ruin to him , ruin to all . No , we are severed by a fate as uncontrollable as severed you dear friend ; ours is a living death . ”
164730	164736	164738	164738	Ursula	690	“ The morrow is unforeseen , ”
164740	164812	164738	164738	Ursula	690	“ Happy indeed would it be for me , my Sybil , that your innocence should be enshrined within these holy walls , and that the pupil of my best years , and the friend of my serene life , should be my successor in this house . But I feel a deep persuasion that the hour has not arrived for you to take the step that never can be recalled . ”
165478	165486	165488	165488	Sybil	430	“ You are troubled , my father , ”
165498	165519	165491	165491	Gerard	430	“ Only a little restless . I am thinking what a mistake it was to have moved in ‘ 39 . ”
165523	165532	165534	165534	Gerard	430	“ Ah ! you were right , Sybil , ”
165536	165549	165534	165534	Gerard	430	“ affairs were not ripe . We should have waited three years . ”
165550	165554	165556	165556	Sybil	430	“ Three years ! ”
165560	165566	165556	165556	Sybil	430	“ are affairs riper now ? ”
165567	165576	165578	165578	Gerard	430	“ The whole of Lancashire is in revolt , ”
165580	165624	165578	165578	Gerard	430	“ There is not a sufficient force to keep them in check . If the miners and colliers rise , and I have cause to believe that it is more than probable they will move before many days are past,—the game is up . ”
165625	165630	165632	165632	Sybil	430	“ You terrify me , ”
165634	165639	165641	165641	Gerard	430	“ On the Contrary , ”
165645	165687	165641	165641	Gerard	430	“ the news is good enough ; I ’ll not say too good to be true , for I had it from one of the old delegates who is over here to see what can be done in our north countree . ”
165688	165691	165693	165693	Sybil	430	“ Yes , ”
165702	165794	165805	165805	Sybil	430	“ He came to the works ; we had some talk . There are to be no leaders this time , at least no visible ones . The people will do it themselves . All the children of Labour are to rise on the same day , and to toil no more , till they have their rights . No violence , no bloodshed , but toil halts , and then our oppressors will learn the great economical truth as well as moral lesson , that when Toil plays Wealth ceases . ”
165795	165803	165805	165805	Sybil	430	“ When Toil ceases the People suffer , ”
165807	165825	165805	165805	Sybil	430	“ That is the only truth that we have learnt , and it is a bitter one . ”
165826	165834	165836	165836	Gerard	430	“ Can we be free without suffering , ”
165838	165895	165836	165836	Gerard	430	“ Is the greatest of human blessings to be obtained as a matter of course ; to be plucked like fruit , or seized like a running stream ? No , no : we must suffer , but we are wiser than of yore,—we will not conspire . Conspiracies are for aristocrats , not for nations . ”
165896	165907	165909	165909	Sybil	430	“ Alas , alas ! I see nothing but woe , ”
165911	165962	165909	165909	Sybil	430	“ I can not believe that after all that has passed , the people here will move : I can not believe that after all that has passed , all that you , that we , have endured , that you , my father , will counsel them to move . ”
165963	165968	165970	165970	Gerard	430	“ I counsel nothing , ”
165972	166005	165970	165970	Gerard	430	“ It must be a great national instinct that does it : but if all England , if Wales , if Scotland wo n’t work , is Mowbray to have a monopoly ? ”
166006	166015	166017	166017	Sybil	430	“ Ah ! that ’s a bitter jest , ”
166019	166058	166017	166017	Sybil	430	“ England , Wales , Scotland will be forced to work as they were forced before . How can they subsist without labour ? And if they could , there is an organised power that will subdue them . ”
166059	166141	165909	165909	Sybil	430	“ The Benefit Societies , the Sick and Burial Clubs , have money in the banks that would maintain the whole working classes , with aid in kind that will come , for six weeks , and that will do the business . And as for force , why there are not five soldiers to each town in the kingdom . It ’s a glittering bugbear this fear of the military ; simultaneous strikes would baffle all the armies in Europe . ”
166142	166156	166158	166158	Sybil	430	“ I ’ll go back and pray that all this is wild talk , ”
166161	166221	166158	166158	Sybil	430	“ After all that has passed , were it only for your child , you should not speak , much less think , this , my father . What havoc to our hearts and homes has been all this madness ! It has separated us ; it has destroyed our happy home ; it has done more than this — ”
166227	166235	166237	166237	Gerard	430	“ Nay , nay , my child , ”
166245	166363	166364	166364	She	5098	“ one can not weigh one ’s words before those we love . I ca n’t hear of the people moving with coldness — that ’s out of nature ; but I promise you I ’ll not stimulate the lads here . I am told they are little inclined to stir . You found me in a moment of what I must call I suppose elation ; but I hear they beat the red - coats and police at Staley Bridge , and that pricked my blood a bit . I have been ridden down before this when I was a lad , Sybil , by Yeomanry hoofs . You must allow a little for my feelings . ”
166404	166408	166410	166410	Gerard	430	“ Come in , ”
166673	166686	166688	166688	Hatton	425	“ I was down in this part of the world on business , ”
166690	166707	166688	166688	Hatton	425	“ and thought I would come over here for a day to find you all out . ”
166716	166791	166714	166714	he	425	“ And where do you think I accidentally paid a visit a day or two back ? At Mowbray Castle . I see you are surprised . I saw all your friends . I did not ask his Lordship how the writ of right went on . I dare say he thinks ‘ tis all hushed . But he is mistaken . I have learnt something which may help us over the stile yet . ”
166792	166799	166801	166801	Gerard	430	“ Well - a - day , ”
166803	166875	166801	166801	Gerard	430	“ I once thought if I could get back the lands the people would at last have a friend ; but that ’s past . I have been a dreamer of dreams often when I was overlooking them at work . And so we all have I suppose . I would willingly give up my claim if I could be sure the Lancashire lads will not come to harm this bout . ”
166876	166884	166886	166886	Hatton	425	“ ‘ Tis a more serious business , ”
166888	166924	166886	166886	Hatton	425	“ than any thing of the kind that has yet happened . The government are much alarmed . They talk of sending the Guards down into the north , and bringing over troops from Ireland . ”
166925	166929	166931	166931	Gerard	430	“ Poor Ireland ! ”
166933	166957	166931	166931	Gerard	430	“ Well , I think the frieze - coats might give us a helping hand now , and employ the troops at least . ”
166958	166970	166886	166886	Hatton	425	“ No , my dear father , say not such things . ”
166971	166984	166986	166986	Gerard	430	“ Sybil will not let me think of these matters friend Hatton , ”
166989	167063	166986	166986	Gerard	430	“ Well , I suppose it ’s not in my way , at least I certainly did not make the best hand of it in ‘ 39 ; but it was London that got me into that scrape . I can not help fancying that were I on our Moors here a bit with some good lads it might be different , and I must say so , I must indeed , Sybil . ”
167064	167074	167076	167076	Hatton	425	“ But you are very quiet here I hope , ”
167078	167083	167085	167085	Gerard	430	“ Oh ! yes , ”
167087	167144	167085	167085	Gerard	430	“ I believe our spirit is sufficiently broken at Mowbray . Wages weekly dropping , and just work enough to hinder sheer idleness ; that sort of thing keeps the people in very humble trim . But wait a bit , and when they have reached the starvation point I fancy we shall hear a murmur . ”
167145	167175	167177	167177	Hatton	425	“ I remember our friend Morley in ‘ 39 , when we returned from London , gave me a very good character of the disposition of the people here , ”
167179	167202	167177	167177	Hatton	425	“ I hope it continues the same . He feared no outbreak then , and the distress in ‘ 39 was severe . ”
167203	167206	167208	167208	Gerard	430	“ Well , ”
167210	167350	167208	167208	Gerard	430	“ the wages have been dropping ever since . The people exist , but you can scarcely say they live . But they are cowed I fancy . An empty belly is sometimes as apt to dull the heart as inflame the courage . And then they have lost their leaders , for I was away you see , and have been quiet enough since I came out ; and Warner is broken : he has suffered more from his time than I did ; which is strange , for he had his pursuits ; whereas I was restless enough , and that ’s the truth , and had it not been for Sybil ’s daily visit I think , though I may never be allowed to live in a castle , I should certainly have died in one . ”
167351	167357	167431	167432	The reader	6526	“ And how is Morley ? ”
167358	167430	167208	167208	Gerard	430	“ Right well ; the same as you left him : I saw not a straw ’s change when I came out . His paper spreads . He still preaches moral force , and believes that we shall all end in living in communities . But as the only community of which I have personal experience is a gaol , I am not much more inclined to his theory than heretofore . ”
167525	167531	167533	167534	Master Nixon	513	“ It ca n’t last , ”
167557	167563	167564	167564	he	513	“ It comes to this , ”
167567	167590	167564	167564	he	513	“ Natur has her laws , and this is one ; a fair day ’s wage for a fair day ’s work . ”
167591	167599	167601	167601	Juggins	515	“ I wish you may get it , ”
167603	167618	167601	167601	Juggins	515	“ with a harder stint every week and a shilling a day knocked off . ”
167619	167629	167631	167631	Waghorn	518	“ And what ’s to come to - morrow ? ”
167633	167660	167631	167631	Waghorn	518	“ The butty has given notice to quit in Parker ’s field this day se’nnight . Simmons wo n’t drop wages , but works half time . ”
167661	167671	167673	167674	a collier	7840	“ The boys will be at play afore long , ”
167676	167679	167681	167682	Master Nixon	513	“ Hush ! ”
167688	167736	167681	167682	Master Nixon	513	“ play is a very serious word . The boys are not to go to play as they used to do without by your leave or with your leave . We must appoint a committee to consider the question and we must communicate with the other trades . ”
167737	167751	167753	167755	the reproved miner	5115	“ You ’re the man , Master Nixon , to choose for churchwarden , ”
167762	167768	167770	167771	Master Nixon	513	“ What is Diggs doing ? ”
167777	167790	167792	167793	Master Waghorn	518	“ A - dropping wages and a - raising tommy like fun , ”
167795	167807	167792	167793	Master Waghorn	518	“ There is a great stir in Hell - house yard , ”
167823	167885	167792	167793	Master Waghorn	518	“ They say that all the workshops will be shut to - morrow ; not an order for a month past . They have got a top - sawyer from London there who addresses them every evening , and says that we have a right to four shillings a day wages , eight hours ’ work and two pots of ale . ”
167886	167899	167901	167902	Master Nixon	513	“ A fair day ’s wage for a fair day ’s work , ”
167904	167922	167901	167902	Master Nixon	513	“ I would not stickle about hours , but the money and the drink are very just . ”
167923	167932	167934	167934	Waghorn	518	“ If Hell - house yard is astir , ”
167936	167948	167934	167934	Waghorn	518	“ there will be a good deal to be seen yet . ”
167949	167954	167956	167957	Master Nixon	513	“ It ’s grave , ”
167959	167974	167956	167957	Master Nixon	513	“ What think you of a deputation there ? It might come to good . ”

168023	168041	168020	168021	Master Nixon	513	“ but what ’s his Five Points to us ? Why he ayn’t got tommy among them . ”
168042	168047	168049	168049	Waghorn	518	“ Nor long stints , ”

168652	168693	168564	168564	he	5143	“ There is none : my missus says that not a man John of them is to be seen . The Hell - cats as they call themselves halt at every town and offer fifty pounds for a live policeman . ”

170788	170813	170784	170786	the comely dame	7985	“ Well I do declare they march like reglars ; two , four , six , twelve ; a good score at the least . ”
170926	170932	170934	170936	the comely dame	7985	“ It ’s very awful , ”
170938	170950	170952	170953	Liza Gray	302	“ It ’s what I always dreamt would come to pass , ”
170955	170973	170952	170953	Liza Gray	302	“ ever since Master Joseph cut my poor baby over the eye with his three foot rule . ”
170974	170983	170985	170986	Mrs Prance	533	“ I think there can be nobody within , ”
170988	171000	171002	171003	Mrs Page	524	“ Old Diggs would never leave the tommy without a guard , ”
171005	171009	171011	171011	Tummas	541	“ Now lads , ”

171097	171103	171094	171095	Mrs Page	524	“ ‘ Twas Master Joseph , ”
171108	171112	171114	171115	Mrs Mullins	531	“ Sure enough , ”
171117	171124	171114	171115	Mrs Mullins	531	“ I saw his ugly face . ”
171125	171133	171135	171137	old Dame Toddles	528	“ More frightful than the great gun , ”
171139	171151	171153	171154	Liza Gray	302	“ I hope the children will get out of the way , ”
171156	171166	171153	171154	Liza Gray	302	“ for he is sure to fire on them . ”
171203	171211	171186	171188	a benignant countenance	5309	“ What his good friends wanted there ? ”
171212	171224	171226	171227	their leader	7835	“ We have come to settle Sam Barlow ’s tommy book , ”
171229	171258	171226	171227	their leader	7835	“ Our shop is not open to - day my good friends : the account can stand over ; far be it from me to press the poor . ”
171259	171263	171265	171268	a Hell - cat	5312	“ Master Diggs , ”
171270	171283	171265	171268	a Hell - cat	5312	“ canst thou tell us the price of bacon to - day ? ”
171284	171290	171294	171294	Diggs	516	“ Well , good bacon , ”
171300	171308	171294	171294	Diggs	516	“ may be eightpence a - pound . ”
171309	171316	171318	171321	the Hell - cat	5313	“ Thou are wrong Master Diggs , ”
171323	171349	171318	171321	the Hell - cat	5313	“ ‘ tis fourpence and long credit . Let us see half a dozen good flitches at fourpence , Master Diggs ; and be quick . ”
171432	171442	171444	171446	the comely dame	7985	“ ‘ Tis the tenpence a - pound flitch , ”

171471	171477	171479	171479	Tummas	541	“ And now Master Diggs , ”
171481	171518	171479	171479	Tummas	541	“ what is the price of the best tea a - pound ? We be good customers , and mean to treat our wives and sweethearts here . I think we must order half a chest . ”
171631	171642	171644	171646	the comely dame	7985	“ It ’s as good as a grand tommy day , ”
172079	172087	172089	172090	Liza Gray	302	“ He has got the tommy book , ”
172141	172152	172154	172155	Widow Carey	432	“ Life ’s a tumbleabout thing of ups and downs , ”
172160	172175	172154	172155	Widow Carey	432	“ but I have been down this time longer than I can ever remember . ”
172176	172185	172187	172187	Julia	443	“ Nor ever will get up , Widow , ”
172201	172209	172154	172155	Widow Carey	432	“ unless we have the Five Points . ”
172210	172225	172227	172227	Caroline	444	“ I will never marry any man who is not for the Five Points , ”
172229	172244	172246	172246	Harriet	444	“ I should be ashamed to marry any one who had not the suffrage , ”
172248	172257	172259	172259	Julia	443	“ He is no better than a slave , ”
172267	172275	172277	172279	the good woman	4717	“ I do n’t like these politics , ”
172281	172292	172277	172279	the good woman	4717	“ they bayn’t in a manner business for our sex . ”
172293	172302	172304	172304	Julia	443	“ And I should like to know why ? ”
172306	172344	172304	172304	Julia	443	“ Ayn’t we as much concerned in the cause of good government as the men ? And do n’t we understand as much about it ? I am sure the Dandy never does anything without consulting me . ”
172345	172355	172357	172357	Caroline	444	“ It ’s fine news for a summer day , ”
172359	172374	172357	172357	Caroline	444	“ to say we ca n’t understand politics with a Queen on the throne . ”
172375	172388	172390	172391	Mrs Carey	436	“ She has got her ministers to tell her what to do , ”
172399	172418	172390	172391	Mrs Carey	436	“ Poor innocent young creature , it often makes my heart ache to think how she is beset . ”
172419	172424	172426	172426	Julia	443	“ Over the left , ”
172428	172452	172426	172426	Julia	443	“ If the ministers try to come into her bed - chamber , she knows how to turn them to the right about . ”
172453	172459	172461	172461	Harriet	444	“ And as for that , ”
172463	172481	172461	172461	Harriet	444	“ why are we not to interfere with politics as much as the swell ladies in London ? ”
172482	172496	172498	172498	Caroline	444	“ Do n’t you remember , too , at the last election here , ”
172500	172515	172498	172498	Caroline	444	“ how the fine ladies from the Castle came and canvassed for Colonel Rosemary ? ”
172516	172519	172521	172521	Julia	443	“ Ah ! ”
172523	172557	172521	172521	Julia	443	“ I must say I wish the Colonel had beat that horrid Muddlefist . If we ca n’t have our own man , I am all for the Nobs against the Middle Class . ”
172558	172570	172572	172572	Harriet	444	“ We ’ll have our own man soon , I expect , ”
172574	172591	172572	172572	Harriet	444	“ If the people do n’t work , how are the aristocracy to pay the police ? ”
172592	172596	172598	172599	Widow Carey	432	“ Only think ! ”
172604	172630	172601	172601	her	432	“ Why , at your time of life , my dears , we never even heard of these things , much less talked of them . ”
172631	172645	172647	172647	Julia	443	“ I should think you did n’t , widow , and because why ? ”
172649	172674	172647	172647	Julia	443	“ because there was no march of mind then . But we know the time of day now as well as any of them . ”
172675	172681	172683	172684	Mrs Carey	436	“ Lord , my dear , ”
172686	172737	172683	172684	Mrs Carey	436	“ what ’s the use of all that ? What we want is , good wages and plenty to do ; and as for the rest , I do n’t grudge the Queen her throne , nor the noblemen and gentlemen their good things . Live and let live say I. ”
172738	172749	172751	172751	Harriet	444	“ Why , you are a regular oligarch , widow , ”
172753	172759	172751	172751	Harriet	444	“ Well , Miss Harriet , ”
172768	172853	172761	172762	Mrs Carey	436	“ ‘ tisn’t calling your neighbours names that settles any question . I ’m quite sure that Julia will agree to that , and Caroline too . And perhaps I might call you something if I chose , Miss Harriet ; I ’ve heard things said before this , that I should blush to say , and blush to hear too . But I wo n’t demean myself , no I wo n’t . Holly - hock , indeed ! Why holly - hock ? ”
172863	172868	172870	172871	the Dandy	440	“ Well young ladies , ”
172873	172924	172870	172871	the Dandy	440	“ A - swelling the receipt of customs by the consumption of Congo ! That wo n’t do , Julia ; it wo n’t , indeed . Ask Dusty . If you want to beat the enemy , you must knock up the revenue . How d’ye do , widow ? ”
172925	172948	172960	172962	the Dandy gaily	440	“ The same to you , Dandy Mick . We is deploring the evils of the times here in a neighbourly way . ”
172949	172958	172960	172962	the Dandy gaily	440	“ Oh , the times will soon mend , ”
172964	172971	172973	172974	the widow	7141	“ Well , so I think , ”
172976	172989	172973	172974	the widow	7141	“ for when things are at the worst , they always say — ”
172990	173002	173004	173004	Julia	443	“ But you always say they can not mend , Mick , ”
173008	173036	173038	173038	Mick	440	“ Why in a sense , Julia , in a certain sense , you are right ; but there are two senses to everything , my girl , ”
173056	173061	173063	173063	Mick	440	“ ‘ Tis genteel , ”
173069	173077	173063	173063	Mick	440	“ You remember it at the Circus ? ”
173078	173089	173091	173091	Caroline	444	“ I wonder when we shall have the Circus again ? ”
173093	173102	173104	173104	Devilsdust	467	“ Not with the present rate of wages , ”
173106	173112	173114	173114	Caroline	444	“ It ’s very hard , ”
173116	173141	173114	173114	Caroline	444	“ that the Middle Class are always dropping our wages . One really has no amusements now . How I do miss the Temple ! ”
173142	173153	173155	173156	the Dandy	440	“ We ’ll have the Temple open again before long , ”
173158	173164	173166	173166	Caroline	444	“ That will be sweet , ”
173168	173190	173166	173166	Caroline	444	“ I often dream of that foreign nobleman who used to sing , ‘ Oh , no , we never ! ’ ”
173191	173208	173210	173210	Julia	443	“ Well , I can not make out what puts you in such spirits , Mick , ”
173212	173262	173210	173210	Julia	443	“ You told me only this morning that the thing was up , and that we should soon be slaves for life ; working sixteen hours a day for no wages , and living on oatmeal porridge and potatoes , served out by the millocrats like a regular Bastile . ”
173263	173278	173166	173166	Caroline	444	“ But , as Madam Carey says , when things are at the worst — ”
173279	173287	173289	173290	the widow	7141	“ Oh ! I did say it , ”
173292	173317	173289	173290	the widow	7141	“ surely , because you see , at my years , I have seen so many ups and downs , though I always say — ”
173318	173323	173325	173325	Julia	443	“ Come , Dusty , ”
173327	173360	173325	173325	Julia	443	“ you are more silent than ever . You wo n’t take a dish I know : but tell us the news , for I am sure you have something to say . ”
173361	173368	173370	173370	Dusty	470	“ I should think we had , ”
173400	173415	173417	173417	Harriet	444	“ I am sure it ’s Shuffle and Screw going to work half time , ”
173419	173425	173417	173417	Harriet	444	“ I always said so . ”
173426	173436	173438	173438	Julia	443	“ It ’s something to put down the people , ”
173440	173456	173438	173438	Julia	443	“ I suppose the Nobs have met , and are going to drop wages again . ”
173457	173467	173469	173469	Caroline	444	“ I think Dusty is going to be married , ”
173471	173482	173484	173485	Mrs Carey	436	“ Not at this rate of wages I should hope , ”
173492	173498	173500	173500	Devilsdust	467	“ I should think not , ”
173502	173525	173526	173526	he	5366	“ You are a sensible woman , Mrs Carey . And I do n’t know exactly what you mean , Miss Caroline , ”
173589	173593	173595	173595	Julia	443	“ But Dusty , ”
173597	173603	173595	173595	Julia	443	“ now what is it ? ”
173604	173613	173615	173615	Mick	440	“ Why , I thought you all knew , ”
173617	173622	173624	173624	Julia	443	“ Now , now , ”
173626	173643	173624	173624	Julia	443	“ I hate suspense . I like news to go round like a fly - wheel . ”
173644	173647	173649	173649	Devilsdust	467	“ Well , ”
173653	173672	173649	173649	Devilsdust	467	“ this is Saturday , young women , and Mrs Carey too , you will not deny that . ”
173673	173679	173681	173682	Mrs Carey	436	“ I should think not , ”
173684	173726	173681	173682	Mrs Carey	436	“ by the token I kept a stall for thirty year in our market , and never gave it up till this summer , which makes me always think that , though I have seen many ups and downs , this — ”
173727	173738	173740	173740	Caroline	753	“ Well , what has Saturday to do with us ? ”
173742	173779	173740	173740	Caroline	753	“ for neither Dandy Mick nor you can take us to the Temple , or any other genteel place , since they are all shut from the Corn Laws , or some other cause or other . ”
173780	173799	173801	173801	Harriet	444	“ I believe it ’s the machines more than the Corn Laws that have shut up the Temple , ”
173803	173829	173801	173801	Harriet	444	“ Machines , indeed ! Fancy preferring a piece of iron or wood to your own flesh and blood . And they call that Christianlike ! ”
173830	173835	173837	173837	Julia	443	“ It is Saturday , ”
173839	173872	173837	173837	Julia	443	“ sure enough ; and if I do n’t lie in bed to - morrow till sunset , may I get a bate ticket for every day for a week to come . ”
173873	173881	173883	173883	Mick	440	“ Well , go it my hearty , ”
173887	173898	173883	173883	Mick	440	“ It is Saturday , that they have all agreed . ”
173899	173907	173909	173909	Devilsdust	467	“ And to - morrow is Sunday , ”
173912	173926	173928	173928	Julia	443	“ And the next day is the blackest day in all the week , ”
173930	173974	173928	173928	Julia	443	“ When I hear the factory bell on Monday morning , I feel just the same as I did when I crossed with my uncle from Liverpool to Seaton to eat shrimps . Was n’t I sick coming home , that ’s all ! ”
173975	173986	173988	173988	Devilsdust	467	“ You wo n’t hear that bell sound next Monday , ”
173991	173998	174000	174000	Julia	443	“ You do n’t mean that ? ”
174002	174010	174012	174012	Caroline	444	“ Why , what ’s the matter ? ”
174014	174020	174012	174012	Caroline	444	“ Is the Queen dead ? ”
174021	174028	174030	174031	Mrs Carey	436	“ No bell on Monday morning , ”
174035	174055	174057	174057	Devilsdust	467	“ Not a single ring if all the Capitalists in Mowbray were to pull together at the same rope , ”
174059	174065	174067	174067	Julia	443	“ What can it be ? ”
174069	174083	174067	174067	Julia	443	“ Come , Mick ; Dusty is always so long telling us anything . ”
174084	174097	174099	174099	Mick	440	“ Why we are going to have the devil ’s own strike , ”
174111	174115	174117	174117	Julia	443	“ A strike ! ”
174119	174128	174130	174130	Harriet	444	“ I hope they will destroy the machines , ”
174132	174138	174140	174140	Caroline	444	“ And open the Temple , ”
174142	174151	174140	174140	Caroline	444	“ or else it will be very dull . ”
174152	174160	174162	174163	the widow	7141	“ I have seen a many strikes , ”
174165	174178	174162	174163	the widow	7141	“ but as Chaffing Jack was saying to me the other day — ”
174179	174185	174187	174187	Mick	440	“ Chaffing Jack be hanged , ”
174189	174244	174187	174187	Mick	440	“ Such a slow coach wo n’t do in these high - pressure times . We are going to do the trick and no mistake . There sha n’t be a capitalist in England who can get a day ’s work out of us , even if he makes the operatives his junior partners . ”
174245	174253	174255	174256	Mrs Carey	436	“ I never heard of such things , ”
174260	174268	174270	174270	Devilsdust	467	“ It ’s all booked , though , ”
174272	174328	174270	174270	Devilsdust	467	“ We ’ll clean out the Savings ’ Banks ; the Benefits and Burials will shell out . I am treasurer of the Ancient Shepherds , and we passed a resolution yesterday unanimously , that we would devote all our funds to the sustenance of Labour in this its last and triumphant struggle against Capital . ”
174329	174332	174334	174334	Caroline	444	“ Lor ! ”
174336	174345	174334	174334	Caroline	444	“ I think it will be very jolly . ”
174346	174371	174373	174373	Julia	443	“ As long as you can give us money , I do n’t care , for my part , how long we stick out , ”
174375	174378	174380	174381	Mrs Carey	436	“ Well , ”
174383	174406	174380	174381	Mrs Carey	436	“ I did n’t think there was so much spirit in the place . As Chaffing Jack was saying the other day — ”
174407	174416	174418	174418	Devilsdust	467	“ There is no spirit in the place , ”
174420	174443	174418	174418	Devilsdust	467	“ but we mean to infuse some . Some of our friends are going to pay you a visit to - morrow . ”
174444	174451	174453	174453	Caroline	444	“ And who may they be ? ”
174455	174462	174464	174464	Devilsdust	467	“ To - morrow is Sunday , ”
174466	174479	174464	174464	Devilsdust	467	“ and the miners mean to say their prayers in Mowbray Church . ”
174480	174489	174491	174491	Caroline	444	“ Well , that will be a shindy ! ”
174493	174502	174504	174504	Mick	440	“ It ’s a true bill , though , ”
174506	174546	174504	174504	Mick	440	“ This time to - morrow you will have ten thousand of them in this town , and if every mill and work in it and ten mile round is not stopped , my name is not MICK RADLEY ! ”
174649	174655	174657	174657	Hatton	743	“ It ’s very odd , ”
174663	174671	174657	174657	Hatton	743	“ you ca n’t get coffee anywhere . ”
174727	174732	174734	174734	Hatton	743	“ Now try that , ”
174747	174756	174734	174734	Hatton	743	“ you wo n’t find that so bad . ”
174757	174765	174769	174770	the servant	3357	“ Does the town continue pretty quiet ? ”
174778	174801	174767	174767	Morley	423	“ Quite quiet I believe , Sir ; but a great many people in the streets . All the mills are stopped . ”
174802	174811	174813	174813	Hatton	743	“ Well , this is a strange business , ”
174821	174835	174813	174813	Hatton	743	“ You had no idea of it when I met you on Saturday ? ”
174836	174911	174767	174767	Morley	423	“ None ; on the contrary , I felt convinced that there were no elements of general disturbance in this district . I thought from the first that the movement would be confined to Lancashire and would easily be arrested ; but the feebleness of the government , the want of decision , perhaps the want of means , have permitted a flame to spread the extinction of which will not soon be witnessed . ”
174912	174918	174767	174767	Morley	423	“ Do you mean that ? ”
174919	175109	174813	174813	Hatton	743	“ Whenever the mining population is disturbed the disorder is obstinate . On the whole they endure less physical suffering than most of the working classes , their wages being considerable ; and they are so brutalized that they are more difficult to operate on than our reading and thinking population of the factories . But when they do stir there is always violence and a determined course . When I heard of their insurrection on Saturday I was prepared for great disturbances in their district , but that they should suddenly resolve to invade another country as it were , the seat of another class of labour , and where the hardships however severe are not of their own kind , is to me amazing , and convinces me that there is some political head behind the scenes , and that this move , however unintentional on the part of the miners themselves , is part of some comprehensive scheme which , by widening the scene of action and combining several counties and classes of labour in the broil , must inevitably embarrass and perhaps paralyse the Government . ”
175110	175121	175123	175123	Hatton	743	“ There is a good deal in what you say , ”
175139	175159	175136	175136	he	743	“ You remember a conversation we once had , the eve of my departure from Mowbray in ‘ 39 ? ”
175160	175164	175166	175166	Morley	423	“ I do , ”
175169	175178	175180	175180	Hatton	743	“ The miners were not so ready then , ”
175182	175187	175189	175189	Morley	423	“ They were not , ”
175195	175202	175204	175204	Hatton	743	“ Well they are here now , ”
175206	175210	175212	175212	Morley	423	“ They are , ”
175219	175226	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ You saw them enter yesterday ? ”
175230	175274	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ I was sorry I missed it , but I was taking a walk with the Gerards up Dale to see the cottage where they once lived , and which they used to talk of so much ! Was it a strong body ? ”
175275	175296	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ I should say about two thousand men , and as far as bludgeons and iron staves go , armed . ”
175297	175308	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ A formidable force with no military to encounter them . ”
175309	175318	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ Irresistible , especially with a favourable population . ”
175319	175331	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ You think the people were not grieved to see them ? ”
175332	175405	175228	175228	Hatton	743	“ Certainly . Left alone they might have remained quiet ; but they only wanted the spark . We have a number of young men here who have for a long time been murmuring against our inaction and what they call want of spirit . The Lancashire strike set them all agog ; and had any popular leader , Gerard for example or Warner , resolved to move , they were ready . ”
175406	175412	175414	175414	Hatton	743	“ The times are critical , ”
175434	175473	175414	175414	Hatton	743	“ Lord de Mowbray had no idea of all this . I was with him on my way here , and found him quite tranquil . I suppose the invasion of yesterday has opened his eyes a little . ”
175474	175480	175482	175482	Morley	423	“ What can he do ? ”
175484	175571	175482	175482	Morley	423	“ It is useless to apply to the Government . They have no force to spare . Look at Lancashire ; a few dragoons and rifles hurried about from place to place and harassed by night service ; always arriving too late , and generally attacking the wrong point , some diversion from the main scheme . Now we had a week ago some of the 17th Lancers here . They have been marched into Lancashire . Had they remained the invasion would never have occurred . ”
175572	175581	175414	175414	Hatton	743	“ You have n’t a soldier at hand ? ”
175582	175610	175414	175414	Hatton	743	“ Not a man ; they have actually sent for a party of 73d from Ireland to guard us . Mowbray may be burnt before they land . ”
175611	175617	175619	175619	Hatton	743	“ And the castle too , ”
175622	175704	175619	175619	Hatton	743	“ These are indeed critical times Mr Morley . I was thinking when walking with our friend Gerard yesterday , and hearing him and his charming daughter dilate upon the beauties of the residence which they had forfeited , I was thinking what a strange thing life is , and that the fact of a box of papers belonging to him being in the possession of another person who only lives close by , for we were walking through Mowbray woods — ”
175726	175732	175734	175734	Hatton	743	“ Let him come up , ”
175736	175745	175734	175734	Hatton	743	“ he will give us some news perhaps . ”
175871	175876	175878	175878	Morley	447	“ Ah ! Field , ”
175880	175885	175878	175878	Morley	447	“ is it you ? ”
175886	175894	175897	175899	the young man	4545	“ You are surprised to see me ; ”
175904	175908	175910	175910	Morley	447	“ A friend , ”
175912	175918	175910	175910	Morley	447	“ speak as you like . ”
175919	175932	175934	175934	Field	757	“ Our great man , the leader and liberator of the people , ”
175939	176069	175934	175934	Field	757	“ who has carried all before him , and who I verily believe will carry all before him , for Providence has given him those superhuman energies which can alone emancipate a race , wishes to confer with you on the state of this town and neighbourhood . It has been represented to him that no one is more knowing and experienced than yourself in this respect ; besides as the head of our most influential organ in the Press , it is in every way expedient that you should see him . He is at this moment below giving instructions and receiving reports of the stoppage of all the country works , but if you like I will bring him up here , we shall be less disturbed . ”
176070	176075	176077	176077	Hatton	743	“ By all means , ”
176089	176094	176077	176077	Hatton	743	“ By all means . ”
176095	176098	176100	176100	Morley	447	“ Stop ; ”
176102	176108	176100	176100	Morley	447	“ have you seen Gerard ? ”
176109	176112	176114	176114	Field	757	“ No , ”
176116	176140	176114	176114	Field	757	“ I wrote to him some time back , but his reply was not encouraging . I thought his spirit was perhaps broken . ”
176141	176149	176077	176077	Hatton	743	“ You know that he is here ? ”
176150	176307	176077	176077	Hatton	743	“ I concluded so , but we have not seen him ; though to be sure , we have seen so many , and done so much since our arrival yesterday , it is not wonderful . By the bye , who is this blackcoat you have here , this St Lys ? We took possession of the church yesterday on our arrival , for it ’s a sort of thing that pleases the miners and colliers wonderfully , and I always humour them . This St Lys preached us such a sermon that I was almost afraid at one time the game would be spoiled . Our great man was alarmingly taken by it , was saying his prayers all day and had nearly marched back again : had it not been for the excellence of the rum and water at our quarters , the champion of the Charter would have proved a pious recreant . ”
176308	176315	176317	176317	Morley	447	“ St Lys will trouble you , ”
176319	176336	176317	176317	Morley	447	“ Alas ! for poor human nature , when violence can only be arrested by superstition . ”
176337	176344	176346	176347	the Chartist	5169	“ Come do n’t you preach , ”
176349	176395	176346	176347	the Chartist	5169	“ The Charter is a thing the people can understand , especially when they are masters of the country ; but as for moral force , I should like to know how I could have marched from Wodgate to Mowbray with that on my banner . ”
176396	176399	176401	176401	Morley	447	“ Wodgate , ”
176403	176410	176401	176401	Morley	447	“ that ’s a queer place . ”
176411	176414	176416	176416	Hatton	743	“ Wodgate , ”
176418	176424	176416	176416	Hatton	743	“ what Wodgate is that ? ”
176477	176497	176500	176516	a very thickset man , rather under the middle size , with a brutal and grimy countenance	5393	“ Do n’t tell me of your private rooms ; who is master here I should like to know ? ”
176633	176671	176672	176672	he	5393	“ I tell you I want him . He ’s my Lord Chancellor and Prime Minister , my head and principal Doggy ; I ca n’t go on without him . Well , what do you think , ”
176678	176778	176672	176672	he	5393	“ here ’s a pretty go ! They wo n’t stop the works at the big country mill you were talking of . They wo n’t , wo n’t they ? Is my word the law of the land or is it not ? Have I given my commands that all labour shall cease till the Queen sends me a message that the Charter is established , and is a man who has a mill , to shut his gates upon my forces , and pump upon my people with engines ? There shall be fire for this water ; ”
176810	176819	176821	176821	Field	757	“ We will enquire into this , Sir , ”
176823	176832	176821	176821	Field	757	“ and we will take the necessary steps . ”
176833	176847	176849	176850	the Liberator	5401	“ We will enquire into this and we will take the necessary steps , ”
176876	176886	176888	176889	Mr Hatton	425	“ Would the Liberator like to take some breakfast ? ”
176930	176935	176917	176917	he	5401	“ Glass of ale . ”
176975	176993	176995	176996	the Chartist	5169	“ This is my friend of whom I spoke and whom you wished to see , Sir , ”
176998	177019	176995	176996	the Chartist	5169	“ the most distinguished advocate of popular rights we possess , the editor of the Mowbray Phalanx , Mr Morley . ”
177046	177065	176995	176996	the Chartist	5169	“ Why this is the muff that called on me in Hell - house Yard three years ago . ”
177066	177072	177074	177074	Morley	447	“ I had that honour , ”
177077	177082	177084	177085	the Bishop	8200	“ Honour be hanged , ”
177087	177131	177084	177085	the Bishop	8200	“ you know something about somebody ; I could n’t squeeze you then , but by G — I will have it out of you now . Now , cut it short ; have you seen him , and where does he live ? ”
177132	177145	177147	177147	Morley	447	“ I came then to gain information , not to give it , ”
177149	177162	177147	177147	Morley	447	“ I had a friend who wished much to see this gentleman — ”
177163	177169	177171	177172	the Bishop	8200	“ He ayn’t no gentleman , ”
177174	177251	177171	177172	the Bishop	8200	“ he ’s my brother : but I tell you what , I ’ll do something for him now . I ’m cock of the walk you see , and that ’s a sort of thing that do n’t come twice in a man ’s life . One should feel for one ’s flesh and blood , and if I find him out I ’ll make his fortune , or my name is not Simon Hatton . ”
177304	177314	177316	177317	the Bishop	8200	“ Suppose you put an advertisement in your paper , ”
177319	177370	177316	177317	the Bishop	8200	“ I know a traveller who lost his keys at the Yard and got them back again by those same means . Go on advertising till you find him , and my prime minister and principal doggy here shall give you an order on the town council for your expenses . ”
177380	177446	177378	177379	The Bishop	8200	continued—“What ’s the name of the man who has got the big mill here , about three mile off , who wo n’t stop his works and ducked my men this morning with his engines . I ’ll have fire I say for that water — do you hear that Master Newspaper — I’ll have fire for that water before I am many hours older . ”
177447	177453	177455	177456	the Chartist	5169	“ The Liberator means Trafford , ”
177458	177464	177469	177469	he	759	“ I ’ll Trafford him , ”
177477	177496	177469	177469	he	759	“ He ducks my messenger does he ? I tell you I ’ll have fire for that water , ”
177516	177523	177525	177525	Morley	447	“ Trafford is a humane man , ”
177531	177539	177525	177525	Morley	447	“ and behaves well to his people . ”
177540	177549	177551	177552	the Bishop	8200	“ A man with a big mill humane ! ”
177554	177597	177599	177599	he	8200	“ with two or three thousand slaves working under the same roof , and he doing nothing but eating their vitals . I ’ll have no big mills where I ’m main master . Let him look to it . Here goes , ”
177605	177633	177599	177599	he	8200	“ Before an hour I ’ll pay this same Trafford a visit and I ’ll see whether he ’ll duck me . Come on my prime Doggy , ”
177663	177744	177649	177649	Hatton	761	“ To business , friend Morley . This savage can - not be quiet for a moment ; he exists only in destruction and rapine . If it were not Trafford ’s mill it would be something else . I am sorry for the Traffords ; they have old blood in their veins . Before sunset their settlement will be razed to the ground . Can we prevent it ? And why not attack the castle instead of the mill ? ”
178238	178242	178244	178244	he	759	“ Come stupid , ”
178248	178267	178244	178244	he	759	“ what are you staring about ? Get your men in order or I ’ll be among you . ”
178268	178271	178273	178273	Tummas	541	“ Stupid ! ”
178282	178337	178273	178273	Tummas	541	“ And who are you who says ‘ Stupid ? ’ A white - livered Handloom as I dare say , or a son of a gun of a factory slave . Stupid indeed ! What next , when a Hell - cat is to be called stupid by such a thing as you ? ”
178338	178350	178352	178353	Master Nixon	513	“ I ’ll give you a piece of advice young man , ”
178367	178395	178352	178353	Master Nixon	513	“ just you go down the shaft for a couple of months , and then you ’ll learn a little of life , which is wery useful . ”
178569	178575	178579	178579	Morley	423	“ carry out the thing , ”
178770	178791	178793	178794	the Liberator	5401	“ All the waters of the river shall not dout the blaze that I will light up to - day , ”
178796	178804	178806	178806	Field	757	“ He is a most inveterate Capitalist , ”
178808	178830	178806	178806	Field	757	“ and would divert the minds of the people from the Five Points by allotting them gardens and giving them baths . ”
178831	178846	178848	178849	the Liberator	5401	“ We will have no more gardens in England ; everything shall be open , ”
178851	178881	178848	178849	the Liberator	5401	“ and baths shall only be used to drown the enemies of the People . I was always against washing ; it takes the marrow out of a man . ”
178882	178887	178889	178889	Field	757	“ Here we are , ”
178911	178937	178848	178849	the Liberator	5401	“ Every door and every window closed ! The settlement is deserted . Some one has been before us and apprised them of our arrival . ”
178938	178946	178948	178949	the Bishop	8200	“ Will they pour water on me ? ”
178951	178983	178985	178986	the Liberator	5401	“ It must be a stream indeed that shall put out the blaze that I am going to light . What shall we do first ? Halt there , you men , ”
178999	179015	178985	178986	the Liberator	5401	“ Will you halt or wo n’t you ? or must I be among you ? ”
179050	179057	179059	179060	the Bishop	8200	“ What shall we burn first ? ”
179062	179073	179075	179075	Field	757	“ We may as well parley with them a little , ”
179077	179110	179075	179075	Field	757	“ perhaps we may contrive to gain admission and then we can sack the whole affair , and let the people burn the machinery . It will be a great moral lesson . ”
179111	179119	179121	179122	the Bishop	8200	“ As long as there is burning , ”
179124	179152	179121	179122	the Bishop	8200	“ I do n’t care what lessons you teach them . I leave them to you ; but I will have fire to put out that water . ”
179153	179158	179160	179160	Field	757	“ I ’ll advance , ”
179201	179205	179121	179122	the Bishop	8200	“ Who rings ? ”
179211	179242	179121	179122	the Bishop	8200	“ One who by the order of the Liberator wishes to enter and see whether his commands for a complete cessation of labour have been complied with in this establishment . ”
179243	179247	179249	179250	the Bishop	8200	“ Very good , ”
179252	179261	179263	179264	the voice	7561	“ There is no hand at work here , ”
179266	179276	179263	179264	the voice	7561	“ and you may take my word for it . ”
179277	179283	179285	179286	the Bishop	8200	“ Your word be hanged , ”
179288	179294	179263	179264	the voice	7561	“ I want to know — ”
179295	179300	179302	179302	Field	757	“ Hush , hush ! ”
179313	179337	179310	179310	he	757	“ It may be so , but as our messengers this morning were not permitted to enter and were treated with great indignity — ”
179338	179343	179345	179346	the Bishop	8200	“ That ’s it , ”
179348	179353	179355	179355	Field	757	“ With great indignity , ”
179357	179384	179355	179355	Field	757	“ we must have ocular experience of the state of affairs , and I beg and recommend you therefore at once to let the Liberator enter . ”
179385	179391	179393	179398	the unseen guardian of the gate	5497	“ None shall enter here , ”
179400	179405	179407	179408	the Bishop	8200	“ That ’s enough , ”
179410	179413	179415	179415	Field	757	“ Beware ! ”
179417	179432	179434	179435	the Bishop	8200	“ Whether you let us in or not , ‘ tis all the same , ”

179802	179854	179855	179855	We	5513	” ) , if you come hear to learn whether the Mowedale works are stopped , I give you my word there is not a machine or man that stirs here at this moment ( great cheering ) . I believe you ’ll take my word ( cheers , and cries of “
179857	179868	179764	179764	Field	757	” ) . I believe I ’m known at Mowbray ( “
179873	179893	179869	179869	Gerard	430	” ) , and on Mowbray Moor too ( tumultous cheering ) . We have met together before this ( “
179897	179973	179869	179869	Gerard	430	” ) , and shall meet again yet ( great cheering ) . The people have n’t so many friends that they should quarrel with well - wishers . The master here has done his best to soften your lots . He is not one of those who deny that Labour has rights ( loud cheers ) . I say that Mr Trafford has always acknowledged the rights of Labour ( prolonged cheers and cries of “
179977	179992	180079	180079	his	5515	” ) . Well , is he the man that we should injure ? ( “
179996	180071	180073	180073	Gerard	430	” ) . What if he did give a cold reception to some visitors this morning—(groans)—perhaps they wore faces he was not used to ( loud cheers and laughter from the Mowbray people ) . I dare say they mean as well as we do — no doubt of that — but still a neighbour ’s a neighbour ( immense cheering ) . Now , my lads , three cheers for the National Holiday , ”
180088	180119	180079	180079	his	5515	“ The master here has no wish to interfere with the National Holiday ; all he wants to secure is that all mills and works should alike stop ( cries of “

184967	184992	184963	184965	Lady de Mowbray	402	“ but make a condition that they first let us go . Try Alfred , try to manage them before they are utterly ungovernable . ”

Guard these ladies ; save them from these foreigners ! There ’s Butler , he ’ll go with us , and Godfrey Wells . Shall it be said you let your neighbours be plundered and assailed by strangers and never tried to shield them ? Now , my good friends , I entreat , I adjure you , Butler , Wells , Couchman , what would Walter Gerard say , your friend that you have so often followed , if he saw this ? ”
185486	185490	185492	185492	Couchman	767	“ Gerard forever ! ”

185736	185759	185702	185704	Mr St Lys	484	“ For no evil purpose , Mr St Lys . I came as others did , to see what was going on . ”
185760	185875	185706	185707	Charles Gardner	769	“ Then you see a deed of darkness . Struggle against it . Aid me and Philip Warner in this work ; it will support you at the judgment . Tressel , Tressel , stand by me and Warner . That ’s good , that ’s right ! And you too , Daventry , and you , and you . I knew you would wash your hands of this fell deed . It is not Mowbray men who would do this . That ’s right , that ’s right ! Form a band . Good again . There ’s not a man that joins us now who does not make a friend for life . ”

187348	187409	187307	187307	he	423	“ Off ! If you land I will throw this box after you . Now mind ; take it to the convent at Mowbray and deliver it yourself from me to Sybil Gerard . It is light ; there are only papers in it ; but they will give her her own again , and she will not forget you . ”
187410	187415	187417	187417	Mick	440	“ Never mind that , ”

188282	188341	188342	188342	he	423	“ No , no succour . It is useless and I desire none . Why I am here is a mystery ; let it remain so . The world will misjudge me ; the man of peace they will say was a hypocrite . The world will be wrong , as it always is . Death is bitter , ”
188355	188425	188342	188342	he	423	“ more bitter from you ; but just . We have struggled together before , Egremont . I thought I had scotched you then , but you escaped . Our lives have been a struggle since we first met . Your star has controlled mine ; and now I feel I have sacrificed life and fame — dying men prophecy — for your profit and honour . O Sybil ! ”

189251	189258	189260	189262	Lady St Julians	365	“ Well , I must say , ”
189264	189273	189260	189262	Lady St Julians	365	“ that I am curious to see her . ”

189302	189325	189327	189329	Lady St Julians	365	“ What a romantic history ! And what a fortunate man is Lord Marney . If one could only have foreseen events ! ”
189331	189363	189327	189329	Lady St Julians	365	“ He was always a favourite of mine though . But still I thought his brother was the very last person who ever would die . He was so very hard ! ”
189364	189375	189377	189378	Lady Bardolf	737	“ I fear Lord Marney is entirely lost to us , ”

189398	189431	189394	189396	Lady St Julians	365	“ and used to breakfast with that horrid Mr Trenchard , and do those sort of things . But still with his immense fortune , I should think he would become rational . ”
189432	189439	189441	189442	Lady Bardolf	737	“ You may well say immense , ”
189444	189477	189441	189442	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Mr Ormsby , and there is no better judge of another man ’s income , says there are not three peers in the kingdom who have so much a year clear . ”

189534	189624	189531	189532	Lady Bardolf	737	“ Ah ! what changes we have seen in that family ! They say the writ of right killed poor Lord de Mowbray , but to my mind he never recovered the burning of the Castle . We went over to them directly , and I never saw a man so cut up . We wanted them to come to us at Firebrace , but he said he should leave the county immediately . I remember Lord Bardolf mentioning to me , that he looked like a dying man . ”
189625	189631	189633	189635	Lady St Julians	365	“ Well I must say , ”
189646	189657	189633	189635	Lady St Julians	365	“ that I am most curious to see Lady Marney . ”
