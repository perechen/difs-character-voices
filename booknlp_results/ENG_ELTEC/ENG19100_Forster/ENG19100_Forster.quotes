1445	1497	1498	1498	She	613	" I can tell you nothing , Aunt Juley . I know no more than you do . We met — we only met the father and mother abroad last spring . I know so little that I did n't even know their son 's name . It 's all so — "
1507	1517	1500	1500	her	613	" In that case it is far too sudden . "
1518	1528	1500	1500	her	613	" Who knows , Aunt Juley , who knows ? "
1529	1557	1500	1500	her	613	" But , Margaret dear , I mean we must n't be unpractical now that we 've come to facts . It is too sudden , surely . "
1558	1562	1500	1500	her	613	" Who knows ! "
1563	1568	1500	1500	her	613	" But Margaret dear — "
1569	1578	1580	1580	Margaret	246	" I 'll go for her other letters , "
1582	1675	1580	1580	Margaret	246	" No , I wo n't , I 'll finish my breakfast . In fact , I have n't them . We met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer . Helen and I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer — the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors — you know—'Speyer , Maintz , and Köln . ' Those three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street . "
1676	1688	1500	1500	her	613	" I still feel quite uneasy about this business , Margaret . "
1689	2122	1580	1580	Margaret	246	" The train crossed by a bridge of boats , and at first sight it looked quite fine . But oh , in five minutes we had seen the whole thing . The cathedral had been ruined , absolutely ruined , by restoration ; not an inch left of the original structure . We wasted a whole day , and came across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens . They too , poor things , had been taken in — they were actually stopping at Speyer — and they rather liked Helen insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg . As a matter of fact , they did come on next day . We all took some drives together . They knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and see them — at least , I was asked too , but Tibby 's illness prevented me , so last Monday she went alone . That 's all . You know as much as I do now . It 's a young man out the unknown . She was to have come back Saturday , but put off till Monday , perhaps on account of — I do n't know . She broke off , and listened to the sounds of a London morning . Their house was in Wickham Place , and fairly quiet , for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare . One had the sense of a backwater , or rather of an estuary , whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea , and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating . Though the promontory consisted of flats — expensive , with cavernous entrance halls , full of concierges and palms — it fulfilled its purpose , and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace . These , too , would be swept away in time , and another promontory would rise upon their site , as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of London . Mrs. Munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces . She decided that Margaret was a little hysterical , and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk . Feeling very diplomatic , she lamented the fate of Speyer , and declared that never , never should she be so misguided as to visit it , and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in Germany . "
2126	2130	1500	1500	her	613	" she said , "
2152	2153	1580	1580	Margaret	246	" "
2156	2160	2161	2161	Germans	260	" said Margaret ; "
2166	2174	2161	2161	Germans	260	" And her eyes began to shine . "
2184	2188	2177	2177	I	0	" said Mrs. Munt hastily—"English
2193	2202	2177	2177	I	0	" Margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand . "
2212	2213	2208	2208	Helen	245	" "
2256	2257	2250	2250	I	0	" "
2264	2279	2280	2280	Margaret	246	" said Mrs. Munt , admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation . "
2391	2392	2388	2388	you	246	" "
2397	2405	2388	2388	you	246	" They began to talk at once . "
2411	2412	2388	2388	you	246	" "
2427	2428	2424	2424	you	246	" "
2433	2434	2424	2424	you	246	" "
2451	2452	2445	2445	Helen	245	" "
2465	2496	2497	2497	I	0	" Margaret was silent . If her aunt could not see why she must go down , she was not going to tell her . She was not going to say "
2515	2572	2573	2573	I	0	" The affections are more reticent than the passions , and their expression more subtle . If she herself should ever fall in love with a man , she , like Helen , would proclaim it from the house - tops , but as she only loved a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy . "
2579	2584	2586	2588	very wonderful girls	627	" continued Mrs. Munt , "
2638	2646	2647	2647	I	0	" She spread out her plump arms . "
2669	2670	2671	2672	Aunt Juley"—she	3697	" "
2672	2677	2671	2672	Aunt Juley"—she	3697	Juley"—she jumped up and kissed her—"I
2703	2704	2705	2705	I	0	" "
2709	2718	2705	2705	I	0	" retorted Mrs. Munt , with immense confidence . "
2789	2790	2791	2791	I	0	" "
2861	2909	2856	2857	Aunt Juley	255	" Away she hurried , not beautiful , not supremely brilliant , but filled with something that took the place of both qualities — something best described as a profound vivacity , a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her path through life . "
2928	2929	2911	2911	Helen	245	" "
2951	2952	2943	2945	Your good maids	637	" "
2976	3011	2969	2969	I	0	" Then , with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not mad really and convinced observers of another type that she was not a barren theorist , she added : "
3035	3036	3031	3031	I	0	" "
3042	3047	3037	3037	I	0	" said Mrs. Munt ; "
3122	3129	3131	3131	you	246	" Margaret was down on this . "
3143	3144	3131	3131	you	246	" "
3154	3155	3131	3131	you	246	" "
3164	3170	3157	3157	you	246	" Her eyes lit up . "
3225	3226	3233	3233	you	246	" "
3280	3482	3484	3484	I	0	" Margaret again thanked her , again kissed her , and then ran upstairs to see her brother . He was not so well . The hay fever had worried him a good deal all night . His head ached , his eyes were wet , his mucous membrane , he informed her , was in a most unsatisfactory condition . The only thing that made life worth living was the thought of Walter Savage Landor , from whose Imaginary Conversations she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day . It was rather difficult . Something must be done about Helen . She must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight . A telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic , a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible . Now the doctor arrived , and said that Tibby was quite bad . Might it really be best to accept Aunt Juley 's kind offer , and to send her down to Howards End with a note ? Certainly Margaret was impulsive . She did swing rapidly from one decision to another . Running downstairs into the library , she cried—"Yes
3498	3538	3539	3539	You	642	" There was a train from King 's Cross at eleven . At half - past ten Tibby , with rare self - effacement , fell asleep , and Margaret was able to drive her aunt to the station . "
3598	3602	3604	3605	Mrs. Munt	258	" So uncivilized ? "
3619	3642	3609	3609	she	258	" Oh , I used an affected word . I only meant would you please only talk the thing over with Helen . "
3643	3648	3609	3609	she	258	" Only with Helen . "
3649	3652	3609	3609	she	258	" Because — "
4199	4209	4188	4188	Margaret	246	" No , they could manage much better alone . "
4251	4260	4262	4263	Mrs. Munt	258	" I must not interfere a third time , "
4334	4343	4344	4344	Margaret	246	" Then we should be together , dear . "
4397	4424	4386	4387	Mrs. Munt	258	" I did manage that , at all events . When the smash comes poor Margaret will have a nest - egg to fall back upon . "
4993	4999	5000	5000	she	258	" I want a house , "
5007	5021	5000	5000	she	258	" Its name is Howards Lodge . Do you know where it is ? "
5022	5026	5027	5028	the boy	722	" Mr. Wilcox ! "
5041	5048	5031	5037	A young man in front of them	723	" She 's wanting Howards End . "
5090	5106	5081	5081	she	258	" Excuse me asking , but are you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder ? "
5107	5118	5081	5081	she	258	" The younger . Can I do anything for you ? "
5119	5122	5124	5124	herself	258	" Oh , well"—she
5128	5136	5137	5137	She	258	" Really . Are you ? I — "
5149	5172	5137	5137	She	258	" I am Miss Schlegels aunt . I ought to introduce myself , ought n't I ? My name is Mrs. Munt . "
5186	5205	5177	5177	he	721	" Oh , rather ; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us . Did you want to see her ? "
5206	5209	5146	5146	her	258	" Possibly — "
5210	5224	5225	5225	He	721	" I 'll call you a cab . No ; wait a mo — "
5228	5242	5225	5225	He	721	" Our motor 's here . I 'll run you up in it . "
5243	5249	5146	5146	her	258	" That is very kind — "
5250	5273	5146	5146	her	258	" Not at all , if you 'll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office . This way . "
5274	5285	5225	5225	He	721	" My niece is not with you by any chance ? "
5286	5323	5146	5146	her	258	" No ; I came over with my father . He has gone on north in your train . You 'll see Miss Schlegel at lunch . You 're coming up to lunch , I hope ? "
5324	5332	5334	5335	Mrs. Munt	258	" I should like to come up , "
5422	5440	5409	5409	He	728	" In front or behind ? Which do you prefer ? It may be windy in front . "
5441	5453	5520	5520	he	728	" In front if I may ; then we can talk . "
5454	5473	5474	5474	He	728	" But excuse me one moment — I ca n't think what they 're doing with that parcel . "
5488	5517	5518	5518	Emerging	270	" Hi ! hi , you there ! Are you going to keep me waiting all day ? Parcel for Wilcox , Howards End . Just look sharp ! "
5526	5555	5520	5520	he	728	" This station 's abominably organized ; if I had my way , the whole lot of 'em should get the sack . May I help you in ? "
5556	5564	5566	5567	Mrs. Munt	258	" This is very good of you , "
5628	5633	5634	5634	she	258	" Very good indeed , "
5639	5649	5634	5634	she	258	" It is just what I should have wished . "
5650	5659	5660	5660	he	733	" Very good of you to say so , "
5683	5697	5678	5679	Mrs. Munt	258	" I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train . "
5698	5709	5710	5711	Young Wilcox	271	" You see , we heard from Helen this morning . "
5762	5773	5774	5774	he	733	" The mater will be very glad to see you , "
5777	5794	5774	5774	he	733	" Hi ! I say . Parcel for Howards End . Bring it out . Hi ! "
5824	5873	5795	5797	A bearded porter	735	" Sign , must I ? Why the — should I sign after all this bother ? Not even got a pencil on you ? Remember next time I report you to the station - master . My time 's of value , though yours may n't be . Here"—here
5878	5885	5795	5797	A bearded porter	735	" Extremely sorry , Mrs. Munt . "
5886	5894	5945	5945	she	736	" Not at all , Mr. Wilcox . "
5895	5921	5795	5797	A bearded porter	735	" And do you object to going through the village ? It is rather a longer spin , but I have one or two commissions . "
5922	5943	5945	5945	she	736	" I should love going through the village . Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with you . "
5985	5989	5969	5969	Margaret	246	" uncivilized or wrong "
6083	6089	6090	6090	she	736	" You can well imagine , "
6093	6104	6090	6090	she	736	" that the news was a great shock to us . "
6105	6109	6079	6079	she	736	" What news ? "
6110	6114	6115	6115	she	736	" Mr. Wilcox , "
6119	6135	6115	6115	she	736	" Margaret has told me everything — everything . I have seen Helen 's letter . "
6179	6190	6168	6168	he	739	" I beg your pardon ; I did n't catch . "
6191	6247	6248	6248	They	746	" About Helen . Helen , of course . Helen is a very exceptional person — I am sure you will let me say this , feeling towards her as you do — indeed , all the Schlegels are exceptional . I come in no spirit of interference , but it was a great shock . "
6335	6348	6350	6350	his	739	" I wonder when they 'll learn wisdom and tar the roads , "
6374	6401	6354	6355	a man	3695	" Margaret could not come herself , on account of poor Tibby , so I am here to represent her and to have a good talk . "
6402	6411	6413	6415	the young man	739	" I 'm sorry to be so dense , "
6424	6433	6413	6415	the young man	739	" But I still have n't quite understood . "
6434	6445	6446	6446	He	739	" Helen , Mr. Wilcox — my niece and you . "
6492	6498	6499	6499	he	739	" Miss Schlegel and myself . "
6506	6515	6503	6503	his	739	" I trust there has been no misunderstanding , "
6520	6528	6517	6518	Mrs. Munt	258	" Her letter certainly read that way . "
6529	6533	6517	6518	Mrs. Munt	258	" What way ? "
6534	6540	6541	6541	She	757	" That you and she — "
6549	6557	6558	6558	he	739	" I think I catch your meaning , "
6562	6568	6558	6558	he	739	" What an extraordinary mistake ! "
6569	6577	6578	6578	she	757	" Then you did n't the least — "
6597	6609	6578	6578	she	757	" Scarcely , as I am already engaged to another lady . "
6627	6645	6619	6619	he	739	" Oh , good God ! Do n't tell me it 's some silliness of Paul 's . "
6646	6652	6621	6621	his	739	" But you are Paul . "
6653	6658	6621	6621	his	739	" I 'm not . "
6659	6670	6621	6621	his	739	" Then why did you say so at the station ? "
6671	6679	6621	6621	his	739	" I said nothing of the sort . "
6680	6689	6621	6621	his	739	" I beg your pardon , you did . "
6690	6705	6621	6621	his	739	" I beg your pardon , I did not . My name is Charles . "
6706	6708	6621	6621	his	739	" Younger "
6751	6761	6743	6743	they	761	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul — "
6798	6811	6793	6793	she	762	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece — "
6841	6853	6854	6854	she	258	" Yes , they care for one another very much indeed , "
6857	6878	6854	6854	she	258	" I dare say they will tell you about it by - and - by . We heard this morning . "
6887	6898	6880	6880	Charles	249	" The idiot , the idiot , the little fool ! "
6909	6924	6899	6900	Mrs. Munt	258	" If that is your attitude , Mr. Wilcox , I prefer to walk . "
6925	6960	6880	6880	Charles	249	" I beg you will do no such thing . I 'll take you up this moment to the house . Let me tell you the thing 's impossible , and must be stopped . "
6991	7041	6987	6987	she	258	" I quite agree , sir . The thing is impossible , and I will come up and stop it . My niece is a very exceptional person , and I am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her . "
7047	7070	7042	7042	Charles	249	" Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday , and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel — "
7071	7084	6987	6987	she	258	" Could you possibly lower your voice ? The shopman will overhear . "
7085	7088	7042	7042	Charles	249	" Esprit de classe"—if
7129	7133	7105	7110	a member of the lower orders	768	" Right behind ? "
7134	7139	7141	7143	the lower orders	769	" Yes , sir . "
7151	7166	7141	7143	the lower orders	769	" I warn you : Paul has n't a penny ; it 's useless . "
7167	7213	7105	7110	a member of the lower orders	768	" No need to warn us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . The warning is all the other way . My niece has been very foolish , and I shall give her a good scolding and take her back to London with me . "
7214	7284	7285	7285	She	770	" He has to make his way out in Nigeria . He could n't think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate , and is in other ways — Why has n't he told us ? Of course he 's ashamed . He knows he 's been a fool . And so he has — a damned fool . "
7289	7302	7285	7285	She	770	" Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news . "
7303	7360	7105	7110	a member of the lower orders	768	" If I were a man , Mr. Wilcox , for that last remark I 'd box your ears . You 're not fit to clean my niece 's boots , to sit in the same room with her , and you dare — you actually dare — I decline to argue with such a person . "
7361	7385	7285	7285	She	770	" All I know is , she 's spread the thing and he has n't , and my father 's away and I — "
7386	7394	7285	7285	She	770	" And all that I know is — "
7395	7404	7105	7110	a member of the lower orders	768	" Might I finish my sentence , please ? "
7405	7408	7409	7409	Charles	249	" No . "
7559	7588	7546	7546	Helen	245	" Aunt Juley , I have just had a telegram from Margaret ; I — I meant to stop your coming . It isn't — it 's over . "
7603	7634	7598	7598	She	258	" Aunt Juley dear , do n't . Do n't let them know I 've been so silly . It was n't anything . Do bear up for my sake . "
7635	7638	7640	7641	Charles Wilcox	249	" Paul , "
7648	7661	7640	7641	Charles Wilcox	249	" Do n't let them know . They are never to know . "
7662	7669	7598	7598	She	258	" Oh , my darling Helen — "
7670	7675	7676	7679	A very young man	781	" Paul ! Paul ! "
7686	7696	7676	7679	A very young man	781	" Paul , is there any truth in this ? "
7697	7705	7598	7598	She	258	" I didn't — I do n't — "
7706	7726	7598	7598	She	258	" Yes or no , man ; plain question , plain answer . Did or did n't Miss Schlegel — "
7727	7731	7676	7679	A very young man	781	" Charles dear , "
7739	7758	7676	7679	A very young man	781	" Charles , dear Charles , one does n't ask plain questions . There are n't such things . "
7901	7918	7897	7898	her ancestors	792	" Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most . The rest can wait . "
7948	7998	7945	7945	She	248	" Miss Schlegel , would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room , whichever you think best . Paul , do find Evie , and tell her lunch for six , but I 'm not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it . "
8042	8045	8046	8046	he	795	" Mother , "
8049	8062	8046	8046	he	795	" are you aware that Paul has been playing the fool again ? "
8063	8078	8046	8046	he	795	" It 's all right , dear . They have broken off the engagement . "
8079	8083	8046	8046	he	795	" Engagement — ! "
8084	8100	8102	8103	Mrs. Wilcox	248	" They do not love any longer , if you prefer it put that way , "
8185	8195	8181	8181	she	258	" Thank goodness , poor Margaret is saved this ! "
8205	8215	8181	8181	she	258	" It had to be gone through by someone , "
8226	8243	8181	8181	she	258	" The one time I really did help Emily 's girls was over the Wilcox business . "
8506	8520	8503	8503	Charles	249	" Why be so polite to servants ? they do n't understand it , "
8530	8541	8521	8521	she	245	" If they do n't understand it , I do . "
8557	8565	8566	8566	she	245	" I am swathed in ca nt , "
8569	8582	8566	8566	she	245	" and it is good for me to be stripped of it . "
8796	8814	8792	8792	him	247	" This girl would let you kiss her ; you might not have such a chance again . "
8817	8822	8792	8792	him	247	" how it happened , "
8911	8915	8895	8897	the insular moralist	822	" passing emotion , "
9078	9082	9075	9075	he	828	" I love you "
9120	9124	9075	9075	he	828	" I understand , "
9126	9151	9075	9075	he	828	Margaret—"at least , I understand as much as ever is understood of these things . Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning . "
9152	9159	9075	9075	he	828	" It was over at once . "
9160	9165	9075	9075	he	828	" How , Helen ? "
9166	9222	9075	9075	he	828	" I was still happy while I dressed , but as I came downstairs I got nervous , and when I went into the dining - room I knew it was no good . There was Evie — I ca n't explain — managing the tea - urn , and Mr. Wilcox reading the Times . "
9223	9228	9075	9075	he	828	" Was Paul there ? "
9229	9248	9075	9075	he	828	" Yes ; and Charles was talking to him about Stocks and Shares , and he looked frightened . "
9279	9388	9270	9270	Helen	245	" Somehow , when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful . It is all right for us to be frightened , or for men of another sort — father , for instance ; but for men like that ! When I saw all the others so placid , and Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing , I felt for a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud , just a wall of newspapers and motor - cars and golf - clubs , and that if it fell I should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness . "
9389	9409	9075	9075	he	828	" I do n't think that . The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people , particularly the wife . "
9410	9795	9270	9270	Helen	245	" No , I do n't really think that . But Paul was so broad - shouldered ; all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse , and I knew that it would never do — never . I said to him after breakfast , when the others were practising strokes , ' We rather lost our heads , ' and he looked better at once , though frightfully ashamed . He began a speech about having no money to marry on , but it hurt him to make it , and I — stopped him . Then he said , ' I must beg your pardon over this , Miss Schlegel ; I ca n't think what came over me last night . ' And I said , ' Nor what over me ; never mind . ' And then we parted — at least , until I remembered that I had written straight off to tell you the night before , and that frightened him again . I asked him to send a telegram for me , for he knew you would be coming or something ; and he tried to get hold of the motor , but Charles and Mr. Wilcox wanted it to go to the station ; and Charles offered to send the telegram for me , and then I had to say that the telegram was of no consequence , for Paul said Charles might read it , and though I wrote it out several times , he always said people would suspect something . He took it himself at last , pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges , and , what with one thing and the other , it was not handed in at the Post Office until too late . It was the most terrible morning . Paul disliked me more and more , and Evie talked cricket averages till I nearly screamed . I can not think how I stood her all the other days . At last Charles and his father started for the station , and then came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that train , and Paul — oh , rather horrible — said that I had muddled it . But Mrs. Wilcox knew . "
9796	9800	9270	9270	Helen	245	" Knew what ? "
9801	9823	9075	9075	he	828	" Everything ; though we neither of us told her a word , and had known all along , I think . "
9824	9833	9270	9270	Helen	245	" Oh , she must have overheard you . "
9834	9884	9885	9885	She	835	" I suppose so , but it seemed wonderful . When Charles and Aunt Juley drove up , calling each other names , Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible . Ugh ! but it has been a disgusting business . To think that — "
9888	9912	9914	9914	Margaret	246	" To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment , there must be all these telegrams and anger , "
9919	10038	9916	9916	Helen	245	" I 've often thought about it , Helen . It 's one of the most interesting things in the world . The truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never touched — a life in which telegrams and anger count . Personal relations , that we think supreme , are not supreme there . There love means marriage settlements , death , death duties . So far I 'm clear . But here my difficulty . This outer life , though obviously horrid , often seems the real one — there 's grit in it . It does breed character . Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end ? "
10039	10073	9270	9270	Helen	245	" Oh , Meg , that 's what I felt , only not so clearly , when the Wilcoxes were so competent , and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes . "
10074	10082	9270	9270	Helen	245	" Do n't you feel it now ? "
10083	10090	10092	10092	Helen	245	" I remember Paul at breakfast , "
10095	10125	10092	10092	Helen	245	" I shall never forget him . He had nothing to fall back upon . I know that personal relations are the real life , for ever and ever . "
10128	10331	9270	9270	Helen	245	" So the Wilcox episode fell into the background , leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled , and the sisters pursued the life that Helen had commended . They talked to each other and to other people , they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with those whom they liked or could befriend . They even attended public meetings . In their own fashion they cared deeply about politics , though not as politicians would have us care ; they desired that public life should mirror whatever is good in the life within . Temperance , tolerance , and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them ; whereas they did not follow our Forward Policy in Thibet with the keen attention that it merits , and would at times dismiss the whole British Empire with a puzzled , if reverent , sigh . Not out of them are the shows of history erected : the world would be a grey , bloodless place were it entirely composed of Miss Schlegels . But the world being what it is , perhaps they shine out in it like stars . A word on their origin . They were not "
10337	10355	9270	9270	Helen	245	" as their aunt had piously asserted . But , on the other band , they were not "
10362	10721	10356	10360	Germans of the dreadful sort	836	" Their father had belonged to a type that was more prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now . He was not the aggressive German , so dear to the English journalist , nor the domestic German , so dear to the English wit . If one classed him at all it would be as the countryman of Hegel and Kant , as the idealist , inclined to be dreamy , whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air . Not that his life had been inactive . He had fought like blazes against Denmark , Austria , France . But he had fought without visualizing the results of victory . A hint of the truth broke on him after Sedan , when he saw the dyed moustaches of Napoleon going grey ; another when he entered Paris , and saw the smashed windows of the Tuileries . Peace came — it was all very immense , one had turned into an Empire — but he knew that some quality had vanished for which not all Alsace - Lorraine could compensate him . Germany a commercial Power , Germany a naval Power , Germany with colonies here and a Forward Policy there , and legitimate aspirations in the other place , might appeal to others , and be fitly served by them ; for his own part , he abstained from the fruits of victory , and naturalized himself in England . The more earnest members of his family never forgave him , and knew that his children , though scarcely English of the dreadful sort , would never be German to the backbone . He had obtained work in one of our provincial Universities , and there married Poor Emily ( or Die Engländerin as the case may be ) , and as she had money , they proceeded to London , and came to know a good many people . But his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea . It was his hope that the clouds of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time , and the mild intellectual light re - emerge . "
10734	10746	10723	10723	you	837	" exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew . Uncle Ernst replied , "
10769	10781	10765	10765	I	0	" As the haughty nephew did not follow , he continued , "
10821	10825	10765	10765	I	0	No"—for the other had protested—"your
11005	11131	11132	11132	Papa	282	" To all this Margaret listened , sitting on the haughty nephew 's knee . It was a unique education for the little girls . The haughty nephew would be at Wickham Place one day , bringing with him an even haughtier wife , both convinced that Germany was appointed by God to govern the world . Aunt Juley would come the next day , convinced that Great Britain had been appointed to the same post by the same authority . Were both these loud - voiced parties right ? On one occasion they had met , and Margaret with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence . Whereat they blushed , and began to talk about the weather . "
11133	11142	11144	11144	they	849	" she cried — she was a most offensive child—"why
11152	11179	11144	11144	they	849	" Her father , surveying the parties grimly , replied that he did not know . Putting her head on one side , Margaret then remarked , "
11214	11599	11212	11212	God	281	" A hateful little girl , but at thirteen she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without perceiving . Her brain darted up and down ; it grew pliant and strong . Her conclusion was , that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organization , and from this she never varied . Helen advanced along the same lines , though with a more irresponsible tread . In character she resembled her sister , but she was pretty , and so apt to have a more amusing time . People gathered round her more readily , especially when they were new acquaintances , and she did enjoy a little homage very much . When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham Place , she often absorbed the whole of the company , while Margaret — both were tremendous talkers — fell flat . Neither sister bothered about this . Helen never apologized afterwards , Margaret did not feel the slightest rancour . But looks have their influence upon character . The sisters were alike as little girls , but at the time of the Wilcox episode their methods were beginning to diverge ; the younger was rather apt to entice people , and , in enticing them , to be herself enticed ; the elder went straight ahead , and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game . Little need be premised about Tibby . He was now an intelligent man of sixteen , but dyspeptic and difficile . It will be generally admitted that Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man . All sorts and conditions are satisfied by it . Whether you are like Mrs. Munt , and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come — of course , not so as to disturb the others — ; or like Helen , who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music 's flood ; or like Margaret , who can only see the music ; or like Tibby , who is profoundly versed in counterpoint , and holds the full score open on his knee ; or like their cousin , Fräulein Mosebach , who remembers all the time that Beethoven is "
11602	11716	11212	11212	God	281	" ; or like Fräulein Mosebach 's young man , who can remember nothing but Fräulein Mosebach : in any case , the passion of your life becomes more vivid , and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings . It is cheap , even if you hear it in the Queen 's Hall , dreariest music - room in London , though not as dreary as the Free Trade Hall , Manchester ; and even if you sit on the extreme left of that hall , so that the brass bumps at you before the rest of the orchestra arrives , it is still cheap . "
11723	11766	11719	11719	Margaret	246	" said Mrs. Munt , at the conclusion of the first movement . She was again in London on a visit to Wickham Place . Helen looked down the long line of their party , and said that she did not know . "
11782	11783	11784	11784	I	0	" "
11788	11821	11784	11784	I	0	" Helen replied . Music enwrapped her , and she could not enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows . "
11839	11957	11834	11834	one	559	" For the Andante had begun — very beautiful , but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes that Beethoven had written , and , to Helen 's mind , rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third . She heard the tune through once , and then her attention wandered , and she gazed at the audience , or the organ , or the architecture . Much did she censure the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen 's Hall , inclining each to each with vapid gesture , and clad in sallow pantaloons , on which the October sunlight struck . "
11968	12105	11834	11834	one	559	" thought Helen . Here Beethoven started decorating his tune , so she heard him through once more , and then she smiled at her cousin Frieda . But Frieda , listening to Classical Music , could not respond . Herr Liesecke , too , looked as if wild horses could not make him inattentive ; there were lines across his forehead , his lips were parted , his pince - nez at right angles to his nose , and he had laid a thick , white hand on either knee . And next to her was Aunt Juley , so British , and wanting to tap . How interesting that row of people was ! What diverse influences had gone to the making ! Here Beethoven , after humming and hawing with great sweetness , said "
12108	12123	11834	11834	one	559	" and the Andante came to an end . Applause , and a round of "
12125	12127	11834	11834	one	559	" and "
12129	12150	11834	11834	one	559	" from the German contingent . Margaret started talking to her new young man ; Helen said to her aunt : "
12171	12189	11834	11834	one	559	" and Tibby implored the company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the drum . "
12196	12197	11834	11834	one	559	" "
12205	12206	12202	12203	Aunt Juley	255	" "
12228	12834	12215	12215	you	857	" breathed Helen , as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe , from end to end . Others followed him . They were not aggressive creatures ; it was that that made them so terrible to Helen . They merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world . After the interlude of elephants dancing , they returned and made the observation for the second time . Helen could not contradict them , for , once at all events , she had felt the same , and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse . Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! The goblins were right . Her brother raised his finger : it was the transitional passage on the drum . For , as if things were going too far , Beethoven took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted . He appeared in person . He gave them a little push , and they began to walk in major key instead of in a minor , and then — he blew with his mouth and they were scattered ! Gusts of splendour , gods and demigods contending with vast swords , colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle , magnificent victory , magnificent death ! Oh , it all burst before the girl , and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible . Any fate was titanic ; any contest desirable ; conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars . And the goblins — they had not really been there at all ? They were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief ? One healthy human impulse would dispel them ? Men like the Wilcoxes , or President Roosevelt , would say yes . Beethoven knew better . The goblins really had been there . They might return — and they did . It was as if the splendour of life might boil over — and waste to steam and froth . In its dissolution one heard the terrible , ominous note , and a goblin , with increased malignity , walked quietly over the universe from end to end . Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall . Beethoven chose to make all right in the end . He built the ramparts up . He blew with his mouth for the second time , and again the goblins were scattered . He brought back the gusts of splendour , the heroism , the youth , the magnificence of life and of death , and , amid vast roarings of a superhuman joy , he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion . But the goblins were there . They could return . He had said so bravely , and that is why one can trust Beethoven when he says other things . Helen pushed her way out during the applause . She desired to be alone . The music summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career . She read it as a tangible statement , which could never be superseded . The notes meant this and that to her , and they could have no other meaning , and life could have no other meaning . She pushed right out of the building , and walked slowly down the outside staircase , breathing the autumnal air , and then she strolled home . "
12837	12842	12835	12835	Margaret	246	" called Mrs. Munt , "
12848	12849	12844	12844	Helen	245	" "
12853	12854	12844	12844	Helen	245	" "
12867	12871	12855	12855	She	245	" said Tibby . "
12880	12885	12855	12855	She	245	" said Fräulein Mosebach . "
12889	12906	12855	12855	She	245	" said Margaret 's young man , who had for some time been preparing a sentence , "
12919	12920	12908	12909	that lady	859	" "
12939	12940	12933	12933	Tibby	250	" "
12952	12953	12954	12954	Tibby	250	" "
12961	12962	12954	12954	Tibby	250	" "
12970	12985	12954	12954	Tibby	250	" said the young man , in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella . "
12996	13041	12994	12994	Tibby	250	" Tibby rose to his feet , and wilfully caught his person on the backs of the chairs . By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat , and had deposited his full score in safety , it was "
13044	13066	13067	13068	My sister	860	" to go after Helen . The Four Serious Songs had begun , and one could not move during their performance . "
13073	13077	13067	13068	My sister	860	" whispered Margaret . "
13082	13096	13067	13068	My sister	860	" replied the young man ; but his voice was dead and cold . "
13105	13106	13098	13098	you	0	" "
13117	13267	13098	13098	you	0	" and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees . Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in Margaret 's ears . Brahms , for all his grumbling and grizzling , had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an umbrella . For this fool of a young man thought that she and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him , and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walkingstick too . Most ladies would have laughed , but Margaret really minded , for it gave her a glimpse into squalor . To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge ; the poor can not afford it . As soon as Brahms had grunted himself out , she gave him her card and said , "
13304	13361	13289	13289	I	0	" His face brightened a little when he saw that Wickham Place was W. It was sad to see him corroded with suspicion , and yet not daring to be impolite , in case these well - dressed people were honest after all . She took it as a good sign that he said to her , "
13374	13392	13289	13289	I	0	" for this was the remark with which he had originally opened , before the umbrella intervened . "
13398	13412	13413	13413	I	0	" said Margaret , who was not a female of the encouraging type . "
13442	13443	13436	13440	this Elgar that 's coming	863	" "
13448	13455	13436	13440	this Elgar that 's coming	863	" called Herr Liesecke , overhearing . "
13465	13466	13436	13440	this Elgar that 's coming	863	" "
13475	13480	13469	13469	Margaret	246	" cried her aunt . "
13531	13532	13520	13520	you	246	" "
13545	13550	13537	13537	I	0	" said Fräulein Mosebach . "
13562	13563	13564	13564	Frieda	286	" "
13601	13629	13595	13595	Frieda	286	" The lovers laughed and glanced at each other . Moved by a common impulse , they rose to their feet and fled from Pomp and Circumstance . "
13644	13664	13665	13665	Margaret	246	" said Herr Liesecke , as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music started . "
13667	13674	13675	13675	Margaret	246	" loudly whispered by Aunt Juley . "
13693	13721	13679	13680	Fräulein Mosebach	284	" Sure enough , there was Frieda 's reticule , containing her address book , her pocket dictionary , her map of London , and her money . "
13738	13739	13734	13736	Fr - Frieda	286	" "
13742	13752	13734	13736	Fr - Frieda	286	" said all those who thought the music fine . "
13764	13765	13758	13758	they	868	" "
13772	13784	13770	13770	I	0	" said the suspicious young man , and got very red . "
13793	13885	13787	13787	I	0	" He took the bag — money clinking inside it — and slipped up the gangway with it . He was just in time to catch them at the swing - door , and he received a pretty smile from the German girl and a fine bow from her cavalier . He returned to his seat up - sides with the world . The trust that they had reposed in him was trivial , but he felt that it cancelled his mistrust for them , and that probably he would not be "
13887	13897	13770	13770	I	0	" over his umbrella . This young man had been "
13899	13983	13787	13787	I	0	" in the past — badly , perhaps overwhelmingly — and now most of his energies went in defending himself against the unknown . But this afternoon — perhaps on account of music — he perceived that one must slack off occasionally , or what is the good of being alive ? Wickham Place , W. , though a risk , was as safe as most things , and he would risk it . So when the concert was over and Margaret said , "
14009	14013	13996	13996	you	871	" he said , "
14017	14106	13996	13996	you	871	" peaceably , and followed her out of the Queen 's Hall . She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs , or to carry a lady 's programme for her — his class was near enough her own for its manners to vex her . But she found him interesting on the whole — every one interested the Schlegels on the whole at that time — and while her lips talked culture , her heart was planning to invite him to tea . "
14114	14118	13996	13996	you	871	" she began . "
14130	14131	14120	14120	you	873	" "
14136	14137	14120	14120	you	873	" "
14150	14151	14120	14120	you	873	" "
14158	14159	14153	14153	you	873	" "
14175	14181	14184	14184	I.	0	" Helen would have exclaimed , "
14190	14215	14184	14184	I.	0	" and thus have endeared herself to the young man . Helen could do these things . But Margaret had an almost morbid horror of "
14220	14222	14184	14184	I.	0	" of "
14227	14242	14184	14184	I.	0	" She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden , but she did not "
14244	14266	14184	14184	I.	0	" it , preferring the more expensive seats ; still less did she love it . So she made no reply . "
14282	14285	14269	14269	I	0	" Was it "
14287	14289	14184	14184	I.	0	" or "
14291	14337	14338	14338	I	0	" ? Better not risk the word . Margaret disliked Tosca and Faust . And so , for one reason and another , they walked on in silence , chaperoned by the voice of Mrs. Munt , who was getting into difficulties with her nephew . "
14407	14408	14393	14393	I	0	" "
14427	14433	14424	14425	Aunt Juley	255	" came Tibby 's voice . "
14442	14443	14424	14425	Aunt Juley	255	" "
14449	14454	14424	14425	Aunt Juley	255	" hazarded Mrs. Munt . "
14466	14474	14457	14457	I	0	" she added , the shot failing . "
14628	14629	14621	14621	I	0	" "
14634	14638	14631	14631	you	250	" asked Margaret . "
14649	14650	14651	14651	I	0	" "
14662	14666	14653	14653	I	0	" he said . "
14700	14708	14688	14688	She	860	" Getting under way , she cried : "
14835	14930	14931	14933	An unhappy family	891	" Now , this very symphony that we 've just been having — she wo n't let it alone . She labels it with meanings from start to finish ; turns it into literature . I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music . Yet I do n't know . There 's my brother — behind us . He treats music as music , and oh , my goodness ! He makes me angrier than anyone , simply furious . With him I dare n't even argue . "
14938	15069	15070	15070	Her	892	" But , of course , the real villain is Wagner . He has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of arts . I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now , though extraordinarily interesting . Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses , like Wagner , who stir up all the wells of thought at once . For a moment it 's splendid . Such a splash as never was . But afterwards — such a lot of mud ; and the wells — as it were , they communicate with each other too easily now , and not one of them will run quite clear . That 's what Wagner 's done . "
15204	15207	15189	15189	he	739	" tell , "
15243	15253	15254	15254	he	739	" I suppose my umbrella will be all right , "
15258	15283	15254	15254	he	739	" I do n't really mind about it . I will think about music instead . I suppose my umbrella will be all right . "
15311	15321	15307	15307	he	739	" Shall I try to do without a programme ? "
15374	15388	15391	15391	she	246	" Do n't you think so ? do n't you feel the same ? "
15396	15403	15391	15391	she	246	" Oh , do interrupt me ! "
15484	15498	15479	15479	she	246	" I do hope that you 'll come in and have some tea . "
15499	15530	15479	15479	she	246	" I do hope that you 'll come in and have some tea . We should be so glad . I have dragged you so far out of your way . "
15630	15637	15616	15616	she	246	" Helen ! Let us in ! "
15638	15642	15616	15616	she	246	" All right , "
15647	15657	15616	15616	she	246	" You 've been taking this gentleman 's umbrella . "
15658	15663	15665	15665	Helen	245	" Taken a what ? "
15671	15687	15665	15665	Helen	245	" Oh , what 's that ? Do come in ! How do you do ? "
15688	15721	15616	15616	she	246	" Helen , you must not be so ramshackly . You took this gentleman 's umbrella away from Queen 's Hall , and he has had the trouble of coming for it . "
15722	15730	15732	15732	Helen	245	" Oh , I am so sorry ! "
15763	15805	15739	15739	She	245	" I do nothing but steal umbrellas . I am so very sorry ! Do come in and choose one . Is yours a hooky or a nobbly ? Mine 's a nobbly — at least , I think it is . "
15837	15936	15937	15937	She	245	" Do n't you talk , Meg ! You stole an old gentleman 's silk top - hat . Yes , she did , Aunt Juley . It is a positive fact . She thought it was a muff . Oh , heavens ! I 've knocked the In and Out card down . Where 's Frieda ? Tibby , why do n't you ever — No , I ca n't remember what I was going to say . That was n't it , but do tell the maids to hurry tea up . What about this umbrella ? "
15941	15963	15937	15937	She	245	" No , it 's all gone along the seams . It 's an appalling umbrella . It must be mine . "
15994	16001	16003	16003	Margaret	246	" But if you will stop — "
16005	16016	16003	16003	Margaret	246	" Now , Helen , how stupid you 've been ! "
16017	16023	15991	15992	the clerk	909	" Whatever have I done ? "
16024	16077	16003	16003	Margaret	246	" Do n't you see that you 've frightened him away ? I meant him to stop to tea . You ought n't to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella . I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable . No , it 's not a bit of good now . "
16089	16095	16079	16079	Helen	245	" Oh , do stop ! "
16096	16107	16109	16110	Mrs. Munt	258	" I dare say it is all for the best , "
16112	16136	16109	16110	Mrs. Munt	258	" We know nothing about the young man , Margaret , and your drawing - room is full of very tempting little things . "
16141	16194	16138	16138	Helen	245	" Aunt Juley , how can you ! You make me more and more ashamed . I 'd rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that I — Well , I must shut the front - door , I suppose . One more failure for Helen . "
16195	16209	16211	16211	Margaret	246	" Yes , I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent , "
16224	16305	16221	16221	she	246	" You remember ' rent . ' It was one of father 's words — Rent to the ideal , to his own faith in human nature . You remember how he would trust strangers , and if they fooled him he would say , ' It 's better to be fooled than to be suspicious'—that the confidence trick is the work of man , but the want - of - confidence - trick is the work of the devil . "
16306	16315	16317	16318	Mrs. Munt	258	" I remember something of the sort now , "
16329	16342	16324	16324	she	258	" It was lucky that your father married a wife with money . "
16354	16368	16349	16349	she	258	" Why , he might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well . "
16369	16375	16377	16377	Helen	245	" Better that he had , "
16380	16389	16391	16391	Margaret	246	" No , I agree with Aunt Juley , "
16393	16409	16391	16391	Margaret	246	" I 'd rather mistrust people than lose my little Ricketts . There are limits . "
16483	16490	16492	16492	Helen	245	" All right , Auntie Tibby , "
16502	16535	16495	16495	Margaret	246	" In a way , I wish we had a real boy in the house — the kind of boy who cares for men . It would make entertaining so much easier . "
16536	16541	16543	16544	her sister	545	" So do I , "
16546	16556	16543	16544	her sister	545	" Tibby only cares for cultured females singing Brahms . "
16567	16614	16562	16562	she	246	" Why did n't you make that young man welcome , Tibby ? You must do the host a little , you know . You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping , instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women . "
16629	16645	16615	16615	Tibby	250	" Oh , it 's no good looking superior . I mean what I say . "
16646	16651	16653	16653	Margaret	246	" Leave Tibby alone ! "
16665	16676	16678	16678	Helen	245	" Here 's the house a regular hen - coop ! "
16680	16686	16678	16678	Helen	245	" Oh , my dear ! "
16691	16724	16688	16689	Mrs. Munt	258	" How can you say such dreadful things ! The number of men you get here has always astonished me . If there is any danger it 's the other way round . "
16725	16740	16659	16659	her	246	" Yes , but it 's the wrong sort of men , Helen means . "
16741	16748	16750	16750	Helen	245	" No , I do n't , "
16752	16795	16750	16750	Helen	245	" We get the right sort of man , but the wrong side of him , and I say that 's Tibby 's fault . There ought to be a something about the house — an — I do n't know what . "
16796	16806	16807	16807	Helen	245	" A touch of the W. 's , perhaps ? "
16813	16820	16822	16822	Tibby	250	" Who are the W. 's ? "
16824	16846	16822	16822	Tibby	250	" The W. 's are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you do n't , so there ! "
16847	16857	16859	16859	Margaret	246	" I suppose that ours is a female house , "
16861	17053	16859	16859	Margaret	246	" and one must just accept it . No , Aunt Juley , I do n't mean that this house is full of women . I am trying to say something much more clever . I mean that it was irrevocably feminine , even in father 's time . Now I 'm sure you understand ! Well , I 'll give you another example . It 'll shock you , but I do n't care . Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner - party , and that the guests had been Leighton , Millais , Swinburne , Rossetti , Meredith , Fitzgerald , etc . Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic ? Heavens no ! The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that . So with our house — it must be feminine , and all we can do is to see that it is n't effeminate . Just as another house that I can mention , but I wo n't , sounded irrevocably masculine , and all its inmates can do is to see that it is n't brutal . "
17054	17066	17068	17068	Tibby	250	" That house being the W. 's house , I presume , "
17070	17086	17068	17068	Tibby	250	" You 're not going to be told about the W. 's , my child , "
17090	17135	17087	17087	Helen	245	" so do n't you think it . And on the other hand , I do n't the least mind if you find out , so do n't you think you 've done anything clever , in either case . Give me a cigarette . "
17136	17146	17148	17148	Margaret	246	" You do what you can for the house , "
17150	17159	17148	17148	Margaret	246	" The drawing - room reeks of smoke . "
17160	17218	17087	17087	Helen	245	" If you smoked too , the house might suddenly turn masculine . Atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go . Even at Queen Victoria 's dinner - party — if something had been just a little different — perhaps if she 'd worn a clinging Liberty tea - gown instead of a magenta satin — "
17219	17228	17148	17148	Margaret	246	" With an Indian shawl over her shoulders — "
17229	17240	17148	17148	Margaret	246	" Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm - pin — "
17264	17278	17260	17260	Margaret	246	" How inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art . "
17353	17402	17409	17411	the three women	924	" That reminds me , Margaret . We might have taken that young man into the dining - room , at all events . Only the majolica plate — and that is so firmly set in the wall . I am really distressed that he had no tea . "
17721	17739	17742	17742	he	722	" All men are equal — all men , that is to say , who possess umbrellas , "
17902	17908	17899	17900	a fool	3760	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
17909	17915	17925	17926	Mr. Dealtry	310	" Evening , Mr. Dealtry . "
17916	17920	17899	17900	a fool	3760	" Nice evening . "
17921	17924	17925	17926	Mr. Dealtry	310	" Evening . "
18268	18274	18320	18321	Mr. Cunningham	311	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
18275	18281	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" Evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18282	18296	18320	18321	Mr. Cunningham	311	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester . "
18297	18303	18320	18321	Mr. Cunningham	311	" I beg your pardon ? "
18304	18318	18320	18321	Mr. Cunningham	311	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester , "
18341	18346	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" Ah , yes , "
18366	18384	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be stationary in 1960 . "
18385	18392	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" You do n't say so . "
18393	18404	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" I call it a very serious thing , eh ? "
18405	18413	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" Good - evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18414	18422	18348	18348	Leonard	308	" Good - evening , Mr. Bast . "
18469	18472	18462	18462	He	308	" Hullo ! "
18487	18490	18491	18491	he	308	" Hullo ! "
18932	18939	18940	18940	he	308	" Damn , damn , damnation ! "
18967	18974	18957	18957	he	308	" Oh , damn it all — "
19034	19043	19012	19012	he	308	" Seven miles to the north of Venice — "
19072	19129	19061	19063	The rich man	991	" Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low - water mark attain by degrees a higher level , and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass , raised here and there into shapeless mounds , and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea . "
19163	19201	19152	19152	He	308	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the shafts enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this church — its luminousness . "
19250	19290	19225	19225	he	308	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this flat — its obscurity . "
19317	19327	19225	19225	he	308	" My flat is dark as well as stuffy . "
19516	19520	19468	19468	He	308	" bit of luck "
19530	19600	19601	19601	Leonard	308	" If only I had a bit of luck , the whole thing would come straight . . . . He 's got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20 h.-p . Fiat , but then , mind you , he 's had luck . . . . I 'm sorry the wife 's so late , but she never has any luck over catching trains . "
19980	19984	19986	19986	Leonard	308	" What ho ! "
20011	20015	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" What ho ! "
20016	20020	20021	20021	he	314	" Been out ? "
20042	20045	20038	20039	the lady	1008	" No , "
20048	20056	20038	20039	the lady	1008	" Oh , I am so tired . "
20057	20061	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" You tired ? "
20062	20065	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" Eh ? "
20066	20071	20073	20073	he	314	" I 'm tired , "
20080	20090	20073	20073	he	314	" Oh , Len , I am so tired . "
20091	20104	20106	20106	Leonard	308	" I 've been to that classical concert I told you about , "
20108	20113	20106	20106	Leonard	308	" What 's that ? "
20114	20125	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" I came back as soon as it was over . "
20126	20135	20137	20137	Jacky	314	" Any one been round to our place ? "
20139	20159	20137	20137	Jacky	314	" Not that I 've seen . I met Mr. Cunningham outside , and we passed a few remarks . "
20160	20167	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" What , not Mr. Cunnginham ? "
20168	20171	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" Yes . "
20172	20180	20137	20137	Jacky	314	" Oh , you mean Mr. Cunningham . "
20181	20187	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" Yes . Mr. Cunningham . "
20188	20201	20003	20003	Jacky	314	" I 've been out to tea at a lady friend 's . "
20348	20357	20345	20345	she	1009	" Is that a book you 're reading ? "
20362	20368	20345	20345	she	1009	" That 's a book , "
20394	20397	20391	20391	he	308	" Bookmarker . "
20398	20401	20391	20391	he	308	" Len — "
20402	20407	20408	20408	he	308	" What is it ? "
20430	20436	20416	20416	she	1009	" You do love me ? "
20437	20453	20391	20391	he	308	" Jacky , you know that I do . How can you ask such questions ! "
20454	20467	20391	20391	he	308	" But you do love me , Len , do n't you ? "
20468	20474	20391	20391	he	308	" Of course I do . "
20485	20488	20391	20391	he	308	" Len — "
20489	20496	20391	20391	he	308	" Well ? What is it ? "
20497	20507	20391	20391	he	308	" Len , you will make it all right ? "
20508	20519	20521	20522	the boy	722	" I ca n't have you ask me that again , "
20531	20643	20521	20522	the boy	722	" I 've promised to marry you when I 'm of age , and that 's enough . My word 's my word . I 've promised to marry you as soon as ever I 'm twenty - one , and I ca n't keep on being worried . I 've worries enough . It is n't likely I 'd throw you over , let alone my word , when I 've spent all this money . Besides , I 'm an Englishman , and I never go back on my word . Jacky , do be reasonable . Of course I 'll marry you . Only do stop badgering me . "
20644	20652	20391	20391	he	308	" When 's your birthday , Len ? "
20653	20684	20521	20522	the boy	722	" I 've told you again and again , the eleventh of November next . Now get off my knee a bit ; someone must get supper , I suppose . "
20770	20862	20863	20863	He	308	" It really is too bad when a fellow is n't trusted . It makes one feel so wild , when I 've pretended to the people here that you 're my wife — all right , you shall be my wife — and I 've bought you the ring to wear , and I 've taken this flat furnished , and it 's far more than I can afford , and yet you are n't content , and I 've also not told the truth when I 've written home . "
20868	20874	20865	20865	his	308	" He 'd stop it . "
20890	20906	20887	20887	he	308	" My brother'd stop it . I 'm going against the whole world , Jacky . "
20981	21061	20979	20979	you	1021	" I 'll tell you another thing too . I care a good deal about improving myself by means of Literature and Art , and so getting a wider outlook . For instance , when you came in I was reading Ruskin 's Stones of Venice . I do n't say this to boast , but just to show you the kind of man I am . I can tell you , I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon . "
21088	21099	21080	21080	she	1025	" But you do love me , do n't you ? "
21234	21236	21230	21230	She	1025	" likeness "
21310	21321	21296	21305	the family in the flat on the ground - floor	1031	" Hark , my soul , it is the Lord . "
21322	21331	21333	21333	Leonard	308	" That tune fairly gives me the hump , "
21354	21373	21374	21374	He	308	" No ; I 'll play you something lovely . Get up , dear , for a minute . "
21600	21603	21648	21648	she	1043	" Len ? "
21604	21609	21610	21610	he	722	" You in bed ? "
21617	21620	21610	21610	he	722	" M'm . "
21621	21625	21627	21627	she	1043	" All right . "
21632	21643	21644	21644	he	722	" I must clean my boots ready for the morning , "
21653	21663	21648	21648	she	1043	" I rather want to get this chapter done . "
21664	21667	21668	21668	He	722	" What ? "
21675	21680	21668	21668	He	722	" What 's that ? "
21681	21695	21713	21713	she	1043	" All right , Jacky , nothing ; I 'm reading a book . "
21696	21699	21713	21713	she	1043	" What ? "
21700	21703	21704	21704	he	722	" What ? "
21777	21782	21784	21785	her aunt	613	" Oh , Margaret , "
21789	21805	21784	21785	her aunt	613	" such a most unfortunate thing has happened . I could not get you alone . "
21833	21849	21829	21831	the Wilcox family	1049	" coming up , no doubt , in the hope of getting into London society . "
21988	22005	21966	21966	She	258	" What ! a hundred and twenty for a basement ? You 'll never get it ! "
22011	22019	22007	22007	they	1055	" One can but try , madam . "
22090	22103	22104	22104	she	246	" Oh , but Helen is n't a girl with no interests , "
22107	22148	22104	22104	she	246	" She has plenty of other things and other people to think about . She made a false start with the Wilcoxes , and she 'll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them . "
22149	22199	22471	22472	Mrs. Munt	258	" For a clever girl , dear , how very oddly you do talk . Helen'll have to have something more to do with them , now that they 're all opposite . She may meet that Paul in the street . She can not very well not bow . "
22200	22335	22336	22337	Mrs. Munt	258	" Of course she must bow . But look here ; let 's do the flowers . I was going to say , the will to be interested in him has died , and what else matters ? I look on that disastrous episode ( over which you were so kind ) as the killing of a nerve in Helen . It 's dead , and she 'll never be troubled with it again . The only things that matter are the things that interest one . Bowing , even calling and leaving cards , even a dinner - party — we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes , if they find it agreeable ; but the other thing , the one important thing — never again . Do n't you see ? "
22366	22433	22344	22344	Margaret	246	" I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with us . I did n't tell you at the time — it might have made you angry , and you had enough to worry you — but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W. , and apologized for the trouble that Helen had given them . She did n't answer it . "
22434	22439	22471	22472	Mrs. Munt	258	" How very rude ! "
22440	22449	22344	22344	Margaret	246	" I wonder . Or was it sensible ? "
22450	22458	22344	22344	Margaret	246	" No , Margaret , most rude . "
22459	22470	22471	22472	Mrs. Munt	258	" In either case one can class it as reassuring . "
22569	22580	22581	22581	she	258	" But you will be careful , wo n't you ? "
22584	22592	22581	22581	she	258	" Oh , certainly . Fiendishly careful . "
22593	22602	22581	22581	she	258	" And Helen must be careful , too , "
22603	22608	22610	22610	Helen	245	" Careful over what ? "
22623	22626	22628	22628	Margaret	246	" Nothing , "
22636	22644	22628	22628	Margaret	246	" Careful over what , Aunt Juley ? "
22652	22698	22645	22646	Mrs. Munt	258	" It is only that a certain family , whom we know by name but do not mention , as you said yourself last night after the concert , have taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons — where the plants are in the balcony . "
22722	22737	22719	22719	she	258	" What , Helen , you do n't mind them coming , do you ? "
22745	22753	22755	22755	Helen	245	" Of course I do n't mind , "
22760	22786	22755	22755	Helen	245	" It is that you and Meg are both so absurdly grave about it , when there 's nothing to be grave about at all . "
22787	22793	22795	22795	Margaret	246	" I 'm not grave , "
22804	22817	22795	22795	Margaret	246	" Well , you look grave ; does n't she , Frieda ? "
22818	22841	22801	22801	her	246	" I do n't feel grave , that 's all I can say ; you 're going quite on the wrong tack . "
22842	22851	22853	22854	Mrs. Munt	258	" No , she does not feel grave , "
22856	22867	22853	22854	Mrs. Munt	258	" I can bear witness to that . She disagrees — "
22868	22871	22873	22874	Fräulein Mosebach	284	" Hark ! "
22876	22884	22873	22874	Fräulein Mosebach	284	" I hear Bruno entering the hall . "
22980	23012	22972	22972	she	245	" Did you say the Mathesons ' flat , Aunt Juley ? How wonderful you are ! I never knew that the woman who laced too tightly 's name was Matheson . "
23013	23018	23020	23021	her cousin	3896	" Come , Helen , "
23023	23028	22972	22972	she	245	" Go , Helen , "
23043	23054	22972	22972	she	245	" Helen can not deceive me , She does mind . "
23055	23060	23062	23062	Margaret	246	" Oh , hush ! "
23064	23076	23062	23062	Margaret	246	" Frieda'll hear you , and she can be so tiresome . "
23077	23081	23083	23084	Mrs. Munt	258	" She minds , "
23102	23240	23083	23084	Mrs. Munt	258	" I knew she 'd mind — and I 'm sure a girl ought to ! Such an experience ! Such awful coarse - grained people ! I know more about them than you do , which you forget , and if Charles had taken you that motor drive — well , you 'd have reached the house a perfect wreck . Oh , Margaret , you do n't know what you are in for . They 're all bottled up against the drawing - room window . There 's Mrs. Wilcox — I've seen her . There 's Paul . There 's Evie , who is a minx . There 's Charles — I saw him to start with . And who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper - coloured face be ? "
23241	23247	23329	23329	her	246	" Mr. Wilcox , possibly . "
23248	23259	23083	23084	Mrs. Munt	258	" I knew it . And there 's Mr. Wilcox . "
23260	23272	23274	23274	Margaret	246	" It 's a shame to call his face copper colour , "
23276	23290	23274	23274	Margaret	246	" He has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age . "
23331	23361	23325	23325	Margaret	246	" Helen did not take the news quite as I expected , but the Wilcox nerve is dead in her really , so there 's no need for plans . "
23362	23371	23329	23329	her	246	" It 's as well to be prepared . "
23372	23384	23329	23329	her	246	" No — it 's as well not to be prepared . "
23385	23468	23325	23325	Margaret	246	" Because — ' Her thought drew being from the obscure borderland . She could not explain in so many words , but she felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy . It is necessary to prepare for an examination , or a dinner - party , or a possible fall in the price of stock : those who attempt human relations must adopt another method , or fail . "
23476	23482	23329	23329	her	246	" was her lame conclusion . "
23488	23506	23325	23325	Margaret	246	" exclaimed her aunt , pointing to the Mansions with the spout of the watering - can . "
23608	23609	23593	23593	you	1072	" "
23619	23620	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" "
23628	23629	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" "
23634	23641	23593	23593	you	1072	" she continued with a smile , "
23655	23656	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" "
23666	23667	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" "
23675	23680	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" said Miss Schlegel . "
23688	23689	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" "
23697	23722	23623	23623	Margaret	246	" said Mrs. Munt , who collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts , and was especially attracted by those that are portable . "
23827	23828	23829	23829	I	0	" "
23835	23836	23829	23829	I	0	" "
23942	23943	23948	23948	Socialism	325	" "
23950	23956	23948	23948	Socialism	325	" said Mrs. Munt suspiciously . "
24122	24123	24125	24125	they	1099	" "
24146	24147	24138	24138	she	284	" "
24152	24153	24154	24154	Helen	245	" "
24164	24165	24154	24154	Helen	245	" "
24171	24172	24173	24173	I	0	" "
24191	24192	24185	24185	you	1102	" "
24203	24213	24193	24193	I	0	" answered Margaret in tones that were suddenly preoccupied . "
24233	24234	24224	24224	you	1102	" "
24257	24258	24224	24224	you	1102	" "
24262	24279	24224	24224	you	1102	" echoed Mrs. Munt , having , as it were , at last secured her nut . "
24289	24290	24293	24293	I	0	" "
24320	24321	24315	24315	you	1102	" "
24342	24343	24348	24348	dear	629	" "
24363	24364	24352	24352	you	1102	" "
24399	24420	24386	24387	a housemaid	1109	" On their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes ' flat . Evie was in the balcony , "
24425	24502	24386	24387	a housemaid	1109	" according to Mrs. Munt . Oh yes , it was a nuisance , there was no doubt of it . Helen was proof against a passing encounter but — Margaret began to lose confidence . Might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes ? And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight , and Frieda was sharp , abominably sharp , and quite capable of remarking , "
24514	24541	24503	24503	You	1102	" The remark would be untrue , but of the kind which , if stated often enough , may become true ; just as the remark , "
24550	24714	24503	24503	You	1102	" renders war a little more likely each time that it is made , and is therefore made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation . Have the private emotions also their gutter press ? Margaret thought so , and feared that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of it . They might , by continual chatter , lead Helen into a repetition of the desires of June . Into a repetition — they could not do more ; they could not lead her into lasting love . They were — she saw it clearly — Journalism ; her father , with all his defects and wrong - headedness , had been Literature , and had he lived , he would have persuaded his daughter rightly . The registry office was holding its morning reception . A string of carriages filled the street . Miss Schlegel waited her turn , and finally had to be content with an insidious "
24717	24775	24776	24776	Helen	245	" being rejected by genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs . Her failure depressed her , and though she forgot the failure , the depression remained . On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes ' flat , and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to Helen . "
24788	24789	24778	24778	you	245	" "
24793	24805	24776	24776	Helen	245	" said Helen , who was washing her hands for lunch . "
24811	24812	24776	24776	Helen	245	" "
24819	24820	24776	24776	Helen	245	" "
24823	24824	24776	24776	Helen	245	" "
24827	24870	24776	24776	Helen	245	" Then she admitted that she was a little worried on Mrs. Wilcox 's account ; she implied that Mrs. Wilcox might reach backward into deep feelings , and be pained by things that never touched the other members of that clan . "
24900	24901	24897	24897	she	1113	" "
24944	24945	24935	24935	We	1111	" "
25000	25001	24987	24987	Meg	246	" "
25038	25041	25046	25046	you	245	and"—she cleared her throat—"you
25066	25267	25268	25268	Helen	245	" But Helen 's laugh rang true , as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never , nowhere and nohow , would she again fall in love with any of the Wilcox family , down to its remotest collaterals . The friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox , which was to develop so — quickly and with such strange results , may perhaps have had its beginnings at Speyer , in the spring . Perhaps the elder lady , as she gazed at the vulgar , ruddy cathedral , and listened to the talk of Helen and her husband , may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy , a sounder judgment . She was capable of detecting such things . Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss Schlegels to be invited to Howards End , and Margaret whose presence she had particularly desired . All this is speculation : Mrs. Wilcox has left few clear indications behind her . It is certain that she came to call at Wickham Place a fortnight later , the very day that Helen was going with her cousin to Stettin . "
25270	25285	25361	25362	the woman	779	" cried Fräulein Mosebach in awestruck tones ( she was now in her cousin 's confidence)—"his
25291	25328	25329	25330	keine Dame	330	" And then , remembering that in England the new - comer ought not to call before she is called upon , she changed her tone from awe to disapproval , and opined that Mrs. Wilcox was "
25332	25333	25329	25330	keine Dame	330	" "
25339	25343	25344	25344	Helen	245	" snapped Margaret . "
25367	25368	25361	25362	the woman	779	" "
25380	25389	25390	25390	She	246	" Helen retorted , collapsing upon the stairs . "
25430	25431	25420	25420	Meg	246	" "
25439	25444	25450	25450	Frieda	326	" asserted Fräulein Mosebach . "
25470	25490	25465	25465	I	0	" Then Helen simulated tears , and Fräulein Mosebach , who thought her extremely amusing , did the same . "
25525	25526	25517	25517	I	0	" "
25553	25554	25559	25559	Meg	246	" "
25595	25666	25667	25668	the Wilcox	332	" A male — even such a male as Tibby — was enough to stop the foolery . The barrier of sex , though decreasing among the civilized , is still high , and higher on the side of women . Helen could tell her sister all , and her cousin much about Paul ; she told her brother nothing . It was not prudishness , for she now spoke of "
25670	25774	25780	25780	she	1127	" with laughter , and even with a growing brutality . Nor was it precaution , for Tibby seldom repeated any news that did not concern himself . It was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men , and that , however trivial it was on this side of the barrier , it would become important on that . So she stopped , or rather began to fool on other subjects , until her long - suffering relatives drove her upstairs . Fräulein Mosebach followed her , but lingered to say heavily over the banisters to Margaret , "
25796	25797	25780	25780	she	1127	" "
25807	25808	25780	25780	she	1127	" "
25818	25819	25811	25811	I	0	" "
25825	25826	25811	25811	I	0	" "
25831	26467	25811	25811	I	0	" asked Tibby . No one told him , and he proceeded into the dining - room , to eat Elvas plums . That evening Margaret took decisive action . The house was very quiet , and the fog — we are in November now — pressed against the windows like an excluded ghost . Frieda and Helen and all their luggage had gone . Tibby , who was not feeling well , lay stretched on a sofa by the fire . Margaret sat by him , thinking . Her mind darted from impulse to impulse , and finally marshalled them all in review . The practical person , who knows what he wants at once , and generally knows nothing else , will excuse her of indecision . But this was the way her mind worked . And when she did act , no one could accuse her of indecision then . She hit out as lustily as if she had not considered the matter at all . The letter that she wrote Mrs. Wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution . The pale cast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish , a breath that leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away . Dear Mrs. Wilcox , I have to write something discourteous . It would be better if we did not meet . Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family , and , in my sister 's case , the grounds for displeasure might recur . As far as I know , she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son . But it would not be fair , either to her or to you , if they met , and it is therefore right that our acquaintance which began so pleasantly , should end . I fear that you will not agree with this ; indeed , I know that you will not , since you have been good enough to call on us . It is only an instinct on my part , and no doubt the instinct is wrong . My sister would , undoubtedly , say that it is wrong . I write without her knowledge , and I hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy . Believe me , Yours truly , M. J. Schlegel Margaret sent this letter round by post . Next morning she received the following reply by hand : Dear Miss Schlegel , You should not have written me such a letter . I called to tell you that Paul has gone abroad . Ruth Wilcox Margaret 's cheeks burnt . She could not finish her breakfast . She was on fire with shame . Helen had told her that the youth was leaving England , but other things had seemed more important , and she had forgotten . All her absurd anxieties fell to the ground , and in their place arose the certainty that she had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox . Rudeness affected Margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth . It poisoned life . At times it is necessary , but woe to those who employ it without due need . She flung on a hat and shawl , just like a poor woman , and plunged into the fog , which still continued . Her lips were compressed , the letter remained in her hand , and in this state she crossed the street , entered the marble vestibule of the flats , eluded the concierges , and ran up the stairs till she reached the second - floor . She sent in her name , and to her surprise was shown straight into Mrs. Wilcox 's bedroom . "
26493	26578	26480	26480	I	0	" Mrs. Wilcox bowed gravely . She was offended , and did not pretend to the contrary . She was sitting up in bed , writing letters on an invalid table that spanned her knees . A breakfast tray was on another table beside her . The light of the fire , the light from the window , and the light of a candle - lamp , which threw a quivering halo round her hands , combined to create a strange atmosphere of dissolution . "
26593	26594	26595	26595	He	1129	" "
26606	26607	26595	26595	He	1129	" "
26628	26635	26636	26636	I	0	" Mrs. Wilcox did not answer . "
26654	26655	26649	26649	you	1130	" "
26676	26677	26668	26668	you	245	" "
26682	26686	26687	26687	I	0	" cried Margaret . "
26711	26714	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Indeed ? "
26715	26723	26732	26733	the other	3850	" She has just gone to Germany . "
26724	26730	26732	26733	the other	3850	" She gone as well , "
26735	26751	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Yes , certainly , it is quite safe — safe , absolutely , now . "
26752	26759	26761	26761	Margaret	335	" You 've been worrying too ! "
26776	26801	26761	26761	Margaret	335	" How perfectly extraordinary ! I can see that you have . You felt as I do ; Helen must n't meet him again . "
26802	26809	26732	26733	the other	3850	" I did think it best . "
26810	26814	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Now why ? "
26815	26823	26825	26826	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" That 's a most difficult question , "
26839	26860	26834	26834	her	510	" I think you put it best in your letter — it was an instinct , which may be wrong . "
26861	26870	26732	26733	the other	3850	" It was n't that your son still — "
26871	26887	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Oh no ; he often — my Paul is very young , you see . "
26888	26894	26895	26895	She	510	" Then what was it ? "
26898	26906	26895	26895	She	510	" An instinct which may be wrong . "
26907	26952	26732	26733	the other	3850	" In other words , they belong to types that can fall in love , but could n't live together . That 's dreadfully probable . I 'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another . "
26953	26962	26964	26965	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" These are indeed ' other words , ' "
26967	26992	26964	26965	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I had nothing so coherent in my head . I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister . "
26993	27033	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Ah , I have always been wanting to ask you . How did you know ? Helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up , and you stepped forward and arranged things . Did Paul tell you ? "
27034	27045	27047	27048	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" There is nothing to be gained by discussing that , "
27055	27080	27047	27048	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Mrs. Wilcox , were you very angry with us last June ? I wrote you a letter and you did n't answer it . "
27081	27100	26732	26733	the other	3850	" I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson 's flat . I knew it was opposite your house . "
27101	27109	26732	26733	the other	3850	" But it 's all right now ? "
27110	27115	27047	27048	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I think so . "
27116	27135	26732	26733	the other	3850	" You only think ? You are n't sure ? I do love these little muddles tidied up ? "
27136	27144	27146	27147	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Oh yes , I 'm sure , "
27156	27171	27146	27147	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I always sound uncertain over things . It is my way of speaking . "
27172	27184	26732	26733	the other	3850	" That 's all right , and I 'm sure too . "
27213	27228	27186	27187	the maid	1134	" I must say good - bye now — you will be getting up . "
27229	27252	26732	26733	the other	3850	" No — please stop a little longer — I am taking a day in bed . Now and then I do . "
27253	27265	27146	27147	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I thought of you as one of the early risers . "
27266	27283	26732	26733	the other	3850	" At Howards End — yes ; there is nothing to get up for in London . "
27284	27291	27293	27295	the scandalized Margaret	335	" Nothing to get up for ? "
27297	27318	27293	27295	the scandalized Margaret	335	" When there are all the autumn exhibitions , and Ysaye playing in the afternoon ! Not to mention people . "
27319	27355	26732	26733	the other	3850	" The truth is , I am a little tired . First came the wedding , and then Paul went off , and , instead of resting yesterday , I paid a round of calls . "
27356	27360	26732	26733	the other	3850	" A wedding ? "
27361	27373	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Yes ; Charles , my elder son , is married . "
27374	27377	26732	26733	the other	3850	" Indeed ! "
27378	27442	27443	27443	Margaret	335	" We took the flat chiefly on that account , and also that Paul could get his African outfit . The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband 's , and she most kindly offered it to us . So before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of Dolly 's people , which we had not yet done . "
27451	27476	27443	27443	Margaret	335	" Fussell . The father is in the Indian army — retired ; the brother is in the army . The mother is dead . "
27482	27486	27481	27495	the " chinless sunburnt men " whom Helen had espied one afternoon through the window	1137	" chinless sunburnt men "
27593	27718	27590	27591	Howards End	339	" Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time . They belong to the same club , and are both devoted to golf . Dolly plays golf too , though I believe not so well , and they first met in a mixed foursome . We all like her , and are very much pleased . They were married on the 11th , a few days before Paul sailed . Charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man , so he made a great point of having it on the 11th . The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas , but they were very nice about it . There is Dolly 's photograph — in that double frame . "
27719	27733	27769	27770	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Are you quite certain that I 'm not interrupting , Mrs. Wilcox ? "
27734	27739	27590	27591	Howards End	339	" Yes , quite . "
27740	27751	27590	27591	Howards End	339	" Then I will stay . I 'm enjoying this . "
27762	27767	27769	27770	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" For dear Mims , "
27773	27787	27769	27770	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" the name she and Charles had settled that she should call me . "
27853	27863	27842	27842	She	339	" They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon . "
27864	27868	27826	27826	She	339	" Lucky people ! "
27869	27878	27826	27826	She	339	" I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy . "
27879	27887	27842	27842	She	339	" Does n't he care for travelling ? "
27888	27955	27826	27826	She	339	" He likes travel , but he does see through foreigners so . What he enjoys most is a motor tour in England , and I think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable . His father gave him a car of his own for a wedding present , which for the present is being stored at Howards End . "
27956	27965	27826	27826	She	339	" I suppose you have a garage there ? "
27966	28005	27842	27842	She	339	" Yes . My husband built a little one only last month , to the west of the house , not far from the wych - elm , in what used to be the paddock for the pony . "
28016	28023	28025	28025	Margaret	339	" Where 's the pony gone ? "
28030	28043	28025	28025	Margaret	339	" The pony ? Oh , dead , ever so long ago . "
28044	28062	27826	27826	She	339	" The wych - elm I remember . Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree . "
28063	28083	27826	27826	She	339	" It is the finest wych - elm in Hertfordshire . Did your sister tell you about the teeth ? "
28084	28087	28025	28025	Margaret	339	" No . "
28088	28157	27826	27826	She	339	" Oh , it might interest you . There are pigs ' teeth stuck into the trunk , about four feet from the ground . The country people put them in long ago , and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark , it will cure the toothache . The teeth are almost grown over now , and no one comes to the tree . "
28158	28170	27826	27826	She	339	" I should . I love folklore and all festering superstitions . "
28171	28189	27826	27826	She	339	" Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache , if one believed in it ? "
28190	28203	27826	27826	She	339	" Of course it did . It would cure anything — once . "
28204	28231	27826	27826	She	339	" Certainly I remember cases — you see I lived at Howards End long , long before Mr. Wilcox knew it . I was born there . "
28374	28397	28440	28441	the invalid	1148	" Good - bye , Miss Schlegel , good - bye . Thank you for coming . You have cheered me up . "
28398	28404	28440	28441	the invalid	1148	" I 'm so glad ! "
28405	28418	28440	28441	the invalid	1148	" I — I wonder whether you ever think about yourself . ? "
28419	28426	28428	28428	Margaret	339	" I think of nothing else , "
28443	28452	28428	28428	Margaret	339	" I wonder . I wondered at Heidelberg . "
28453	28458	28440	28441	the invalid	1148	" I 'm sure ! "
28459	28464	28440	28441	the invalid	1148	" I almost think — "
28465	28468	28470	28470	Margaret	339	" Yes ? "
28518	28529	28530	28530	Margaret	339	" I almost think you forget you 're a girl . "
28538	28545	28546	28546	she	339	" I 'm twenty - nine , "
28549	28556	28546	28546	she	339	" That not so wildly girlish . "
28561	28579	28557	28558	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" What makes you say that ? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude ? "
28586	28621	28557	28558	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I only meant that I am fifty - one , and that to me both of you — Read it all in some book or other ; I can not put things clearly . "
28622	28650	28546	28546	she	339	" Oh , I 've got it — inexperience . I 'm no better than Helen , you mean , and yet I presume to advise her . "
28651	28664	28557	28558	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Yes . You have got it . Inexperience is the word . "
28665	28668	28670	28670	Margaret	339	" Inexperience , "
28678	28815	28670	28670	Margaret	339	" Of course , I have everything to learn — absolutely everything — just as much as Helen . Life 's very difficult and full of surprises . At all events , I 've got as far as that . To be humble and kind , to go straight ahead , to love people rather than pity them , to remember the submerged — well , one ca n't do all these things at once , worse luck , because they 're so contradictory . It 's then that proportion comes in — to live by proportion . Do n't begin with proportion . Only prigs do that . Let proportion come in as a last resource , when the better things have failed , and a deadlock — Gracious me , I 've started preaching ! "
28816	28827	28829	28830	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Indeed , you put the difficulties of life splendidly , "
28840	28855	28829	28830	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" It is just what I should have liked to say about them myself . "
28970	28976	28962	28964	The new friend	1153	" one or two delightful people "
29205	29218	29219	29219	Margaret	339	" I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now . "
29225	29236	29219	29219	Margaret	339	" Yes , thank you ; I heard on Tuesday . "
29255	29278	29250	29250	she	339	" Only on Tuesday , for they live right away at Stettin . Did you ever know any one living at Stettin ? "
29279	29282	29284	29285	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Never , "
29328	29422	29324	29324	Margaret	339	" People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses . At least , our cousins do , but are n't particularly rich . The town is n't interesting , except for a clock that rolls its eyes , and the view of the Oder , which truly is something special . Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , you would love the Oder ! The river , or rather rivers — there seem to be dozens of them — are intense blue , and the plain they run through an intensest green . "
29423	29437	29324	29324	Margaret	339	" Indeed ! That sounds like a most beautiful view , Miss Schlegel . "
29438	29543	29324	29324	Margaret	339	" So I say , but Helen , who will muddle things , says no , it 's like music . The course of the Oder is to be like music . It 's obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem . The part by the landing - stage is in B minor , if I remember rightly , but lower down things get extremely mixed . There is a slodgy theme in several keys at once , meaning mud - banks , and another for the navigable canal , and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major , pianissimo . "
29544	29554	29556	29557	the man	778	" What do the overhanging warehouses make of that ? "
29561	29570	29572	29572	Margaret	339	" They make a great deal of it , "
29582	29669	29572	29572	Margaret	339	" I think it 's affectation to compare the Oder to music , and so do you , but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously , which we do n't , and the average Englishman does n't , and despises all who do . Now do n't say ' Germans have no taste , ' or I shall scream . They have n't . But — but — such a tremendous but ! — they take poetry seriously . They do take poetry seriously . "
29676	29677	29572	29572	Margaret	339	" "
29879	29880	29881	29881	I	0	" "
29892	29904	29890	29890	you	1178	" said he , turning to Mrs. Wilcox . She replied : "
29912	29922	29907	29908	Miss Schlegel	245	" ; and a chill fell on the conversation . "
29947	29948	29949	29949	I	0	" "
29990	29991	29997	29997	you	1178	" "
30010	30011	30012	30012	I	0	" "
30019	30025	30012	30012	I	0	husband"—her voice softened , the chill increased—"has
30042	30043	30034	30035	our children	1182	" "
30059	30201	30049	30049	they	1182	" Mrs. Wilcox had no idea ; she paid little attention to grounds . She was not intellectual , nor even alert , and it was odd that , all the same , she should give the idea of greatness . Margaret , zigzagging with her friends over Thought and Art , was conscious of a personality that transcended their own and dwarfed their activities . There was no bitterness in Mrs. Wilcox ; there was not even criticism ; she was lovable , and no ungracious or uncharitable word had passed her lips . Yet she and daily life were out of focus : one or the other must show blurred . And at lunch she seemed more out of focus than usual , and nearer the line that divides life from a life that may be of greater importance . "
30335	30336	30315	30315	People	3797	" "
30345	30348	30337	30337	I	0	" said Mrs. Wilcox—"not
30378	30379	30370	30370	We	1189	" "
30385	30389	30381	30381	you	1190	" said Margaret . "
30406	30407	30413	30413	them	1187	" "
30415	30448	30449	30449	It	1192	" said Mrs. Wilcox , unexpectedly catching on to the thought , and rousing , for the first and last time , a faint hope in the breasts of the delightful people . "
30480	30481	30473	30474	my daughter	1194	" "
30491	30492	30493	30493	I	0	" "
30508	30515	30516	30516	One	559	" There was a little silence . "
30528	30541	30543	30543	they	1187	" said a girl opposite , leaning forward and crumbling her bread . "
30563	30564	30565	30565	We	1189	" "
30577	30581	30565	30565	We	1189	" supplied Margaret . "
30642	30643	30644	30644	I	0	" "
30654	30655	30649	30649	I	0	" "
30666	30671	30672	30672	They	1201	" said the man . "
30683	30730	30678	30679	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Oh , but come upstairs for a little . Miss Quested plays . Do you like MacDowell ? Do you mind him only having two noises ? If you must really go , I 'll see you out . Wo n't you even have coffee ? "
30756	30767	30753	30753	she	510	" What an interesting life you all lead in London ! "
30768	30775	30777	30777	Margaret	339	" No , we do n't , "
30784	30845	30777	30777	Margaret	339	" We lead the lives of gibbering monkeys . Mrs. Wilcox — really — We have something quiet and stable at the bottom . We really have . All my friends have . Do n't pretend you enjoyed lunch , for you loathed it , but forgive me by coming again , alone , or by asking me to you . "
30846	30854	30856	30857	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I am used to young people , "
30873	30986	30863	30863	she	510	" I hear a great deal of chatter at home , for we , like you , entertain a great deal . With us it is more sport and politics , but — I enjoyed my lunch very much , Miss Schlegel , dear , and am not pretending , and only wish I could have joined in more . For one thing , I 'm not particularly well just today . For another , you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me . Charles is the same , Dolly the same . But we are all in the same boat , old and young . I never forget that . "
31358	31363	31365	31365	Margaret	339	" First of all , "
31367	31400	31365	31365	Margaret	339	" we must make a list and tick off the people 's names . My aunt always does , and this fog may thicken up any moment . Have you any ideas ? "
31401	31415	31417	31418	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I thought we would go to Harrod 's or the Haymarket Stores , "
31422	31475	31417	31418	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Everything is sure to be there . I am not a good shopper . The din is so confusing , and your aunt is quite right — one ought to make a list . Take my notebook , then , and write your own name at the top of the page . "
31476	31481	31483	31483	Margaret	339	" Oh , hooray ! "
31488	31499	31483	31483	Margaret	339	" How very kind of you to start with me ! "
31590	31610	31587	31587	she	339	" I do n't really want a Yuletide gift , though . In fact , I 'd rather not . "
31611	31614	31587	31587	she	339	" Why ? "
31615	31643	31587	31587	she	339	" Because I 've odd ideas about Christmas . Because I have all that money can buy . I want more people , but no more things . "
31644	31697	31587	31587	she	339	" I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance , Miss Schlegel , in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight . It has so happened that I have been left alone , and you have stopped me from brooding . I am too apt to brood . "
31698	31704	31706	31706	Margaret	339	" If that is so , "
31708	31736	31706	31706	Margaret	339	" if I have happened to be of use to you , which I did n't know , you can not pay me back with anything tangible . "
31737	31759	31760	31760	Her	1224	" I suppose not , but one would like to . Perhaps I shall think of something as we go about . "
31848	31856	31821	31821	Margaret	339	" We always give the servants money . "
31857	31868	31870	31870	Margaret	339	" Yes , do you , yes , much easier , "
31918	31923	31821	31821	Margaret	339	" Join our Christmas goose club"—one
32162	32173	32174	32174	she	339	" No , I do like Christmas on the whole , "
32177	32199	32174	32174	she	339	" In its clumsy way , it does approach Peace and Goodwill . But oh , it is clumsier every year . "
32200	32212	32174	32174	she	339	" Is it ? I am only used to country Christmases . "
32213	32351	32174	32174	she	339	" We are usually in London , and play the game with vigour — carols at the Abbey , clumsy midday meal , clumsy dinner for the maids , followed by Christmas - tree and dancing of poor children , with songs from Helen . The drawing - room does very well for that . We put the tree in the powder - closet , and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted , and with the looking - glass behind it looks quite pretty . I wish we might have a powder - closet in our next house . Of course , the tree has to be very small , and the presents do n't hang on it . No ; the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper . "
32352	32372	32174	32174	she	339	" You spoke of your ' next house , ' Miss Schlegel . Then are you leaving Wickham Place ? "
32373	32390	32174	32174	she	339	" Yes , in two or three years , when the lease expires . We must . "
32391	32398	32174	32174	she	339	" Have you been there long ? "
32399	32404	32174	32174	she	339	" All our lives . "
32405	32415	32174	32174	she	339	" You will be very sorry to leave it . "
32416	32430	32431	32431	She	1243	" I suppose so . We scarcely realize it yet . My father — "
32458	32465	32466	32466	she	1243	" If possible , something distinctive , "
32493	32502	32472	32472	she	1243	" My husband and our daughter are motoring . "
32503	32515	32472	32472	she	1243	" Bertha too ? Oh , fancy , what a coincidence ! "
32593	32632	32590	32590	she	1243	" Do you know , I 'll wait . On second thoughts , I 'll wait . There 's plenty of time still , is n't there , and I shall be able to get Evie 's opinion . "
32650	32659	32647	32647	she	1243	" But could n't you get it renewed ? "
32660	32666	32590	32590	she	1243	" I beg your pardon ? "
32670	32677	32647	32647	she	1243	" The lease , I mean . "
32678	32700	32590	32590	she	1243	" Oh , the lease ! Have you been thinking of that all the time ? How very kind of you ! "
32701	32708	32746	32746	she	1243	" Surely something could be done . "
32709	32732	32746	32746	she	1243	" No ; values have risen too enormously . They mean to pull down Wickham Place , and build flats like yours . "
32733	32738	32590	32590	she	1243	" But how horrible ! "
32739	32744	32746	32746	she	1243	" Landlords are horrible . "
32750	32850	32746	32746	she	1243	" It is monstrous , Miss Schlegel ; it is n't right . I had no idea that this was hanging over you . I do pity you from the bottom of my heart . To be parted from your house , your father 's house — it ought n't to be allowed . It is worse than dying . I would rather die than — Oh , poor girls ! Can what they call civilization be right , if people may n't die in the room where they were born ? My dear , I am so sorry — "
32874	32889	32859	32860	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Howards End was nearly pulled down once . It would have killed me . "
32890	32933	32746	32746	she	1243	" Howards End must be a very different house to ours . We are fond of ours , but there is nothing distinctive about it . As you saw , it is an ordinary London house . We shall easily find another . "
32934	32939	32859	32860	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" So you think . "
32940	32950	32952	32952	Margaret	339	" Again my lack of experience , I suppose ! "
32960	33009	32952	32952	Margaret	339	" I ca n't say anything when you take up that line , Mrs. Wilcox . I wish I could see myself as you see me — foreshortened into a backfisch . Quite the ingénue . Very charming — wonderfully well read for my age , but incapable — "
33017	33027	33028	33028	she	510	" Come down with me to Howards End now , "
33036	33068	33028	33028	she	510	" I want you to see it . You have never seen it . I want to hear what you say about it , for you do put things so wonderfully . "
33085	33093	33094	33094	she	510	" Later on I should love it , "
33097	33128	33094	33094	she	510	" but it 's hardly the weather for such an expedition , and we ought to start when we 're fresh . Is n't the house shut up , too ? "
33141	33149	33134	33135	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Might I come some other day ? "
33159	33167	33169	33169	her	510	" Back to Wickham Place , please ! "
33180	33193	33175	33175	Margaret	339	" A thousand thanks , Miss Schlegel , for all your help . "
33194	33199	33237	33237	her	339	" Not at all . "
33200	33226	33229	33229	her	339	" It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind — the Christmas - cards especially . I do admire your choice . "
33243	33336	33239	33239	Margaret	339	" My husband and Evie will be back the day after tomorrow . That is why I dragged you out shopping today . I stayed in town chiefly to shop , but got through nothing , and now he writes that they must cut their tour short , the weather is so bad , and the police - traps have been so bad — nearly as bad as in Surrey . Ours is such a careful chauffeur , and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like roadhogs . "
33337	33340	33237	33237	her	339	" Why ? "
33341	33355	33237	33237	her	339	" Well , naturally he — he is n't a road - hog . "
33356	33378	33379	33380	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" He was exceeding the speed - limit , I conclude . He must expect to suffer with the lower animals . "
33582	33590	33591	33591	Her	339	" Might I come some other day ? "
33841	33844	33849	33850	a fool	3760	" another day "
33852	33855	33849	33850	a fool	3760	" Another day "
34116	34125	34127	34127	Margaret	339	" I will come if I still may , "
34132	34174	34127	34127	Margaret	339	" You are coming to sleep , dear , too . It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful . You are coming to stop . I can not show you my meadow properly except at sunrise . These fogs"—she
34179	34203	34127	34127	Margaret	339	roof—"never spread far . I dare say they are sitting in the sun in Hertfordshire , and you will never repent joining them . "
34211	34212	34204	34204	I	0	" "
34218	34255	34256	34256	Mother	3662	" They began the walk up the long platform . Far at its end stood the train , breasting the darkness without . They never reached it . Before imagination could triumph , there were cries of "
34260	34282	34283	34283	Evie	253	" and a heavy - browed girl darted out of the cloak - room and seized Mrs. Wilcox by the arm . "
34285	34289	34290	34290	Evie	253	" she gasped . "
34295	34300	34301	34301	Father	348	" The girl called , "
34311	34312	34303	34303	I	0	" "

34345	34353	34343	34343	Ruth	335	" cried Mr. Wilcox , joining them . "
34370	34377	34368	34368	Ruth	335	" Mrs. Wilcox had recovered herself . "
34403	34404	34400	34401	Miss Schlegel	245	" "
34409	34417	34400	34401	Miss Schlegel	245	" he replied , not greatly interested . "
34425	34426	34421	34421	yourself	335	" "
34432	34437	34421	34421	yourself	335	" she answered gaily . "
34469	34470	34463	34465	a fool of	1293	" "
34483	34484	34485	34485	I	0	" "
34501	34502	34489	34493	this fool of a driver	1295	" "
34512	34513	34506	34507	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
34532	34533	34506	34507	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
34544	35166	34506	34507	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" The voices of the happy family rose high . Margaret was left alone . No one wanted her . Mrs. Wilcox walked out of King 's Cross between her husband and her daughter , listening to both of them . The funeral was over . The carriages rolled away through the soft mud , and only the poor remained . They approached to the newly - dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin , now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay . It was their moment . Most of them were women from the dead woman 's district , to whom black garments had been served out by Mr. Wilcox 's orders . Pure curiosity had brought others . They thrilled with the excitement of a death , and of a rapid death , and stood in groups or moved between the graves , like drops of ink . The son of one of them , a wood - cutter , was perched high above their heads , pollarding one of the churchyard elms . From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton , strung upon the North Road , with its accreting suburbs ; the sunset beyond , scarlet and orange , winking at him beneath brows of grey ; the church ; the plantations ; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms . But he , too , was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth . He tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching : how he could not leave his work , and yet did not like to go on with it ; how he had almost slipped out of the tree , he was so upset ; the rooks had cawed , and no wonder — it was as if rooks knew too . His mother claimed the prophetic power herself — she had seen a strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time . London had done the mischief , said others . She had been a kind lady ; her grandmother had been kind , too — a plainer person , but very kind . Ah , the old sort was dying out ! Mr. Wilcox , he was a kind gentleman . They advanced to the topic again and again , dully , but with exaltation . The funeral of a rich person was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to the educated . It was Art ; though remote from life , it enhanced life 's values , and they witnessed it avidly . The grave - diggers , who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval — they disliked Charles ; it was not a moment to speak of such things , but they did not like Charles Wilcox — the grave - diggers finished their work and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it . The sun set over Hilton : the grey brows of the evening flushed a little , and were cleft with one scarlet frown . Chattering sadly to each other , the mourners passed through the lych - gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village . The young wood - cutter stayed a little longer , poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically . At last the bough fell beneath his saw . With a grunt , he descended , his thoughts dwelling no longer on death , but on love , for he was mating . He stopped as he passed the new grave ; a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye . "
35178	35321	35322	35322	They	1299	" he reflected . Trudging on a few steps , he stopped again , looked furtively at the dusk , turned back , wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf , and hid it in his pocket . After him came silence absolute . The cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty , and no other house stood near . Hour after hour the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it . Clouds drifted over it from the west ; or the church may have been a ship , high - prowed , steering with all its company towards infinity . Towards morning the air grew colder , the sky clearer , the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead . The wood - cutter , returning after a night of joy , reflected : "
35339	35548	35332	35332	I	0	" Up at Howards End they were attempting breakfast . Charles and Evie sat in the dining - room , with Mrs. Charles . Their father , who could not bear to see a face , breakfasted upstairs . He suffered acutely . Pain came over him in spasms , as if it was physical , and even while he was about to eat , his eyes would fill with tears , and he would lay down the morsel untasted . He remembered his wife 's even goodness during thirty years . Not anything in detail — not courtship or early raptures — but just the unvarying virtue , that seemed to him a woman 's noblest quality . So many women are capricious , breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity . Not so his wife . Year after year , summer and winter , as bride and mother , she had been the same , he had always trusted her . Her tenderness ! Her innocence ! The wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of God . Ruth knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden , or the grass in her field . Her idea of business—"Henry
35563	35567	35740	35740	you	1303	" Her idea of politics—"I
35587	35648	35665	35665	baby	1302	" Her idea of religion — ah , this had been a cloud , but a cloud that passed . She came of Quaker stock , and he and his family , formerly Dissenters , were now members of the Church of England . The rector 's sermons had at first repelled her , and she had expressed a desire for "
35654	35657	35665	35665	baby	1302	" adding , "
35666	35736	35740	35740	you	1303	" ( Charles ) . Inward light must have been granted , for he heard no complaints in later years . They brought up their three children without dispute . They had never disputed . She lay under the earth now . She had gone , and as if to make her going the more bitter , had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her . "
35748	35760	35740	35740	you	1303	" he had moaned , and her faint voice had answered : "
35781	36069	35740	35740	you	1303	" He had been told of the horror by a strange doctor , whom she had consulted during his absence from town . Was this altogether just ? Without fully explaining , she had died . It was a fault on her part , and — tears rushed into his eyes — what a little fault ! It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years . He rose to his feet and looked out of the window , for Evie had come in with the letters , and he could meet no one 's eye . Ah yes — she had been a good woman — she had been steady . He chose the word deliberately . To him steadiness included all praise . He himself , gazing at the wintry garden , is in appearance a steady man . His face was not as square as his son 's , and , indeed , the chin , though firm enough in outline , retreated a little , and the lips , ambiguous , were curtained by a moustache . But there was no external hint of weakness . The eyes , if capable of kindness and goodfellowship , if ruddy for the moment with tears , were the eyes of one who could not be driven . The forehead , too , was like Charles 's . High and straight , brown and polished , merging abruptly into temples and skull , it has the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world . At times it had the effect of a blank wall . He had dwelt behind it , intact and happy , for fifty years . "
36077	36082	36075	36075	Father	348	" said Evie awkwardly . "
36089	36090	35740	35740	you	1303	" "
36098	36099	35740	35740	you	1303	" "
36104	36124	35740	35740	you	1303	" The girl glanced at him and at it with constraint . She did not know what to do . "
36133	36134	36125	36125	Charles	354	" "
36143	36144	36137	36137	I	0	" "
36157	36158	36159	36159	I	0	" "
36165	36183	36159	36159	I	0	" Having sorted the letters from the circulars , she went back to the dining - room . "
36189	36225	36184	36184	Father	348	" she announced , sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the tea - urn — Charles did not answer , but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs , opened the door , and said : "
36237	36254	36235	36235	you	348	" ; and having paused for a reply that did not come , stole down again . "
36267	36272	36264	36264	I	0	" he said evasively ; "
36285	36457	36276	36276	he	348	" Then he took up the Times , and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate . Poor Mrs. Charles sat between her silent companions , terrified at the course of events , and a little bored . She was a rubbishy little creature , and she knew it . A telegram had dragged her from Naples to the death - bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known . A word from her husband had plunged her into mourning . She desired to mourn inwardly as well , but she wished that Mrs. Wilcox , since fated to die , could have died before the marriage , for then less would have been expected of her . Crumbling her toast , and too nervous to ask for the butter , she remained almost motionless , thankful only for this , that her father - in - law was having his breakfast upstairs . At last Charles spoke . "
36469	36476	36458	36458	They	1306	" he said to his sister . "
36480	36481	36482	36482	I	0	" "
36490	36494	36482	36482	I	0	" he continued . "

36601	36614	36618	36618	I	0	" Charles frowned a little , and turned again to his sister . "

36636	36655	36630	36630	you	336	" It 's no good him saying he is not responsible for those men . He is responsible . "
36656	36661	36634	36634	Chalkeley	355	" Yes , rather . "
37326	37328	37314	37314	He	249	" Morning "
37346	37356	37314	37314	He	249	" Hullo ! my new car 's been driven ! "
37357	37363	37314	37314	He	249	" Has it , sir ? "
37364	37367	37369	37369	Charles	249	" Yes , "
37375	37399	37369	37369	Charles	249	" and whoever 's driven it has n't cleaned it properly , for there 's mud on the axle . Take it off . "
37453	37456	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Charles — "
37486	37508	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" One minute , I 'm busy . Well , Crane , who 's been driving it , do you suppose ? "
37509	37551	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Do n't know , I 'm sure , sir . No one 's driven it since I 've been back , but , of course , there 's the fortnight I 've been away with the other car in Yorkshire . "
37558	37583	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Charles , your father 's down . Something 's happened . He wants you in the house at once . Oh , Charles ! "
37584	37607	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Wait , dear , wait a minute . Who had the key to the garage while you were away , Crane ? "
37608	37614	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" The gardener , sir . "
37615	37630	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor ? "
37631	37646	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" No , sir ; no one 's had the motor out , sir . "
37647	37660	37457	37458	His bride	1359	" Then how do you account for the mud on the axle ? "
37661	37686	37687	37687	Charles	249	" I ca n't , of course , say for the time I 've been in Yorkshire . No more mud now , sir . "
37760	37779	37738	37739	his wife	4328	" Now , Dolly , I can attend to you . Miss Schlegel ? What does she want ? "
37816	37822	37812	37813	his wife	4328	" She wants Howards End . "
37823	37842	37878	37878	his	249	" Howards End ? Now , Crane , just do n't forget to put on the Stepney wheel . "
37843	37848	37878	37878	his	249	" No , sir . "
37849	37866	37878	37878	his	249	" Now , mind you do n't forget , for I — Come , little woman . "
37909	37918	37900	37900	he	249	" But you have n't listened , Charles — "
37919	37924	37900	37900	he	249	" What 's wrong ? "
37925	37940	37900	37900	he	249	" I keep on telling you — Howards End . Miss Schlegels got it . "
37941	37945	37947	37947	Charles	249	" Got what ? "
37952	37961	37947	37947	Charles	249	" What the dickens are you talking about ? "
37962	37975	37900	37900	he	249	" Now , Charles , you promised not to say those naughty — "
37976	37996	37900	37900	he	249	" Look here , I 'm in no mood for foolery . It 's no morning for it either . "
37997	38033	37947	37947	Charles	249	" I tell you — I keep on telling you — Miss Schlegel — she 's got it — your mother 's left it to her — and you 've all got to move out ! "
38034	38038	37900	37900	he	249	" Howards End ? "
38039	38043	38044	38044	she	4328	" Howards End ! "
38063	38079	38081	38081	herself	4328	" Dolly , go back at once ! My father 's much annoyed with you . Charles"—she
38082	38099	38100	38100	Charles	249	wildly—"come in at once to Father . He 's had a letter that 's too awful . "
38133	38137	38130	38130	He	249	" Schlegels again ! "
38148	38164	38145	38145	Dolly	336	" Oh no , the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her . "
38165	38174	38176	38177	his father	3799	" Come in , all three of you ! "
38183	38192	38145	38145	Dolly	336	" Dolly , why have you disobeyed me ? "
38193	38199	38145	38145	Dolly	336	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox — "
38200	38231	38232	38232	He	3799	" I told you not to go out to the garage . I 've heard you all shouting in the garden . I wo n't have it . Come in . "
38245	38285	38232	38232	He	3799	" Into the dining - room , every one of you . We ca n't discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants . Here , Charles , here ; read these . See what you make . "
38342	38360	38338	38338	She	4297	" To my husband : I should like Miss Schlegel ( Margaret ) to have Howards End . "
38361	38374	38375	38375	he	249	" I suppose we 're going to have a talk about this ? "
38381	38393	38375	38375	he	249	" Certainly . I was coming out to you when Dolly — "
38394	38402	38336	38336	herself	4297	" Well , let 's sit down . "
38403	38416	38375	38375	he	249	" Come , Evie , do n't waste time , sit down . "
38479	38536	38537	38537	Dolly	336	" A note in my mother 's handwriting , in an envelope addressed to my father , sealed . Inside : ' I should like Miss Schlegel ( Margaret ) to have Howards End . ' No date , no signature . Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home . Now , the question is — "
38541	38564	38537	38537	Dolly	336	" But I say that note is n't legal . Houses ought to be done by a lawyer , Charles , surely . "
38614	38619	38602	38602	Charles	249	" Give it her . "
38629	38646	38620	38620	She	336	" Why , it 's only in pencil ! I said so . Pencil never counts . "
38647	38659	38661	38662	Mr. Wilcox	249	" We know that it is not legally binding , Dolly , "
38671	38727	38728	38728	Charles	249	" We are aware of that . Legally , I should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire . Of course , my dear , we consider you as one of the family , but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand . "
38742	38747	38748	38748	He	249	" The question is — "
38773	38793	38794	38794	He	249	" The question is whether Miss Schlegel , during the fortnight we were all away , whether she unduly — "
38797	38804	38806	38807	his father	3799	" I do n't think that , "
38817	38823	38806	38807	his father	3799	" Do n't think what ? "
38824	38859	38806	38807	his father	3799	" That she would have — that it is a case of undue influence . No , to my mind the question is the — the invalid 's condition at the time she wrote . "
38860	38884	38806	38807	his father	3799	" My dear father , consult an expert if you like , but I do n't admit it is my mother 's writing . "
38885	38894	38896	38896	Dolly	336	" Why , you just said it was ! "
38898	38905	38906	38906	he	249	" Never mind if I did , "
38910	38916	38906	38906	he	249	" and hold your tongue . "
39525	39529	39515	39519	The woman who had died	1396	" Do this , "
39534	39539	39531	39531	they	1385	" We will not . "
39565	39586	39561	39561	they	1385	" She was a dear mother , a true wife : in our absence she neglected her health and died . "
39591	39605	39588	39588	they	1385	" She was not as true , as dear , as we supposed . "
39634	39637	39630	39630	they	1385	" Treachery . "
39799	39804	39806	39807	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Ah , well ! "
39814	39823	39806	39807	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I should n't have thought it possible . "
39824	39832	39834	39834	Evie	253	" Mother could n't have meant it , "
39839	39849	39834	39834	Evie	253	" No , my girl , of course not . "
39850	39875	39806	39807	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Mother believed so in ancestors too — it is n't like her to leave anything to an outsider , who 'd never appreciate . "
39876	39884	39885	39885	he	249	" The whole thing is unlike her , "
39888	39935	39885	39885	he	249	" If Miss Schlegel had been poor , if she had wanted a house , I could understand it a little . But she has a house of her own . Why should she want another ? She would n't have any use of Howards End . "
39936	39942	39944	39944	Charles	249	" That time may prove , "
39946	39949	39944	39944	Charles	249	" How ? "
39954	39982	39944	39944	Charles	249	" Presumably she knows — mother will have told her . She got twice or three times into the nursing home . Presumably she is awaiting developments . "
39983	39989	39944	39944	Charles	249	" What a horrid woman ! "
39999	40013	39991	39991	Dolly	336	" Why , she may be coming down to turn us out now ! "
40019	40025	40026	40026	he	249	" I wish she would , "
40030	40038	40026	40026	he	249	" I could then deal with her . "
40039	40044	40046	40047	his father	3799	" So could I , "
40096	40123	40076	40077	the boy	722	" I could deal with her , if she comes , but she wo n't come . You 're all a bit hard on Miss Schlegel . "
40124	40134	40046	40046	his	249	" That Paul business was pretty scandalous , though . "
40135	40254	40255	40255	He	1407	" I want no more of the Paul business , Charles , as I said at the time , and besides , it is quite apart from this business . Margaret Schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week , and we have all suffered under her , but upon my soul she 's honest . She 's not in collusion with the matron . I 'm absolutely certain of it . Nor was she with the doctor . I 'm equally certain of that . She did not hide anything from us , for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are . She , like ourselves , was a dupe — "
40261	40334	40255	40255	He	1407	" You see , Charles , in her terrible pain your poor mother put us all in false positions . Paul would not have left England , you would not have gone to Italy , nor Evie and I into Yorkshire , if only we had known . Well , Miss Schlegel 's position has been equally false . Take all in all , she has not come out of it badly . "
40338	40343	40335	40335	Evie	253	" But those chrysanthemums — "
40344	40354	40356	40356	Dolly	336	" Or coming down to the funeral at all — "
40358	40420	40356	40356	Dolly	336	" Why should n't she come down ? She had the right to , and she stood far back among the Hilton women . The flowers — certainly we should not have sent such flowers , but they may have seemed the right thing to her , Evie , and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany . "
40421	40432	40434	40434	Evie	253	" Oh , I forget she is n't really English , "
40436	40443	40434	40434	Evie	253	" That would explain a lot . "
40444	40450	40452	40452	Charles	249	" She 's a cosmopolitan , "
40459	40540	40452	40452	Charles	249	" I admit I 'm rather down on cosmopolitans . My fault , doubtless . I can not stand them , and a German cosmopolitan is the limit . I think that 's about all , is n't it ? I want to run down and see Chalkeley . A bicycle will do . And , by the way , I wish you 'd speak to Crane some time . I 'm certain he 's had my new car out . "
40541	40549	40576	40576	his	249	" Has he done it any harm ? "
40550	40553	40452	40452	Charles	249	" No . "
40554	40573	40452	40452	Charles	249	" In that case I shall let it pass . It 's not worth while having a row . "
41079	41083	41078	41078	she	339	" loved superstition . "
41212	41216	41217	41217	they	3809	" her sort , "
41329	41334	41373	41373	Helen	245	" telegrams and anger , "
41444	41451	41452	41452	she	339	" Do n't brood too much , "
41457	41494	41452	41452	she	339	" on the superiority of the unseen to the seen . It 's true , but to brood on it is mediaeval . Our business is not to contrast the two , but to reconcile them . "
41649	41665	41669	41669	she	245	" It is n't size that counts so much as the way things are arranged . "
41910	41923	41906	41906	She	245	" Oh , how lovely ! That 's the place for me ! "
41934	41943	41949	41949	she	245	" I have a message , dear Helen , "
42008	42018	42020	42020	Helen	245	" And there will even be someone for Tibby , "
42022	42084	42020	42020	Helen	245	" There now , Tibby , think of that ; Frieda is saving up a little girl for you , in pig - tails and white worsted stockings , but the feet of the stockings are pink , as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries . I 've talked too much . My head aches . Now you talk . "
42364	42379	42361	42361	she	339	" Helen , I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox ; that sad business ? "
42380	42383	42361	42361	she	339	" Yes . "
42384	42452	42361	42361	she	339	" I have had a correspondence with her son . He was winding up the estate , and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything . I thought it good of him , considering I knew her so little . I said that she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present , but we both forgot about it afterwards . "
42453	42461	42361	42361	she	339	" I hope Charles took the hint . "
42462	42613	42361	42361	she	339	" Yes — that is to say , her husband wrote later on , and thanked me for being a little kind to her , and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette . Do n't you think that is extraordinarily generous ? It has made me like him very much . He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance , but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in the future . I like Mr. Wilcox . He is taking up his work — rubber — it is a big business . I gather he is launching out rather . Charles is in it , too . Charles is married — a pretty little creature , but she does n't seem wise . They took on the flat , but now they have gone off to a house of their own . "
43719	43735	43716	43716	she	339	" I was thinking of Mr. Vyse . He never strikes me as particularly happy . "
43736	43741	43743	43743	Tibby	250	" Ye - es , "
43841	43869	43831	43831	her	245	" But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched , weedy man , do n't you think ? Then there 's Guy . That was a pitiful business . Besides"—shifting
43874	43885	43886	43886	Groans	376	" every one is the better for some regular work . "
43888	43895	43896	43896	she	245	" I shall stick to it , "
43901	43995	43896	43896	she	245	" I am not saying it to educate you ; it is what I really think . I believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work , and they must not starve it . It 's a new desire . It goes with a great deal that 's bad , but in itself it 's good , and I hope that for women , too , ' not to work ' will soon become as shocking as ' not to be married ' was a hundred years ago . "
43996	44010	44012	44012	Tibby	250	" I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude , "
44014	44059	44012	44012	Tibby	250	" Then we 'll leave the subject till you do . I 'm not going to rattle you round . Take your time . Only do think over the lives of the men you like most , and see how they 've arranged them . "
44060	44069	44071	44071	Tibby	250	" I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most , "
44094	44136	44137	44137	She	1529	" And do n't think I 'm not serious because I do n't use the traditional arguments — making money , a sphere awaiting you , and so on — all of which are , for various reasons , ca nt . "
44141	44177	44186	44186	she	1529	" I 'm only your sister . I have n't any authority over you , and I do n't want to have any . Just to put before you what I think the truth . You see"—she
44189	44218	44186	44186	she	1529	taken—"in a few years we shall be the same age practically , and I shall want you to help me . Men are so much nicer than women . "
44219	44232	44305	44306	his sister	4364	" Labouring under such a delusion , why do you not marry ? "
44233	44247	44083	44083	he	250	" I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance . "
44248	44254	44186	44186	she	1529	" Has nobody arst you ? "
44255	44259	44305	44306	his sister	4364	" Only ninnies . "
44260	44266	44083	44083	he	250	" Do people ask Helen ? "
44267	44270	44186	44186	she	1529	" Plentifully . "
44271	44277	44305	44306	his sister	4364	" Tell me about them . "
44278	44281	44083	44083	he	250	" No . "
44282	44291	44186	44186	she	1529	" Tell me about your ninnies , then . "
44292	44303	44310	44310	she	4364	" They were men who had nothing better to do , "
44318	44409	44310	44310	she	4364	" So take warning : you must work , or else you must pretend to work , which is what I do . Work , work , work if you 'd save your soul and your body . It is honestly a necessity , dear boy . Look at the Wilcoxes , look at Mr. Pembroke . With all their defects of temper and understanding , such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and I think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly . "
44415	44419	44420	44420	I	0	" he moaned . "
44430	44431	44424	44424	They	251	" "
44439	44463	44437	44437	Meg	339	" he protested , suddenly sitting up , alert and angry . Tibby , for all his defects , had a genuine personality . "
44478	44479	44466	44466	they	251	" "
44488	44489	44466	44466	they	251	" "
44532	44533	44522	44523	Evie Wilcox	253	" "
44535	44541	44522	44523	Evie Wilcox	253	" always elicited a groan . "
44598	44599	44632	44633	the men	1459	" "
44602	44603	44604	44604	I	0	" "
44611	44619	44604	44604	I	0	" said Margaret , a little sadly . "
44670	44671	44662	44663	splendid people	1541	" "
44676	44680	44662	44663	splendid people	1541	" he sneered . "
44709	44710	44712	44712	I	0	" "
44714	44718	44712	44712	I	0	" said Tibby , "
44739	44740	44741	44741	You	0	" "
44768	44769	44761	44761	You	0	" "

44925	44947	44955	44955	you	1554	" As she spoke , the door was flung open , and Helen burst in in a state of extreme excitement . "
44977	44989	44993	44993	her	1002	" ( Helen was fond of supplying her own surprise . ) "
45002	45003	44993	44993	her	1002	" "
45011	45032	45033	45033	I	0	" cried Margaret , who had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots . "
45109	45110	45099	45099	she	1002	" "
45120	45121	45113	45113	Helen	245	" "
45230	45233	45216	45216	she	1002	" Lan ? "
45234	45249	45216	45216	she	1002	" Lan or Len . We were not nice about our vowels . Lanoline . "
45250	45256	45216	45216	she	1002	" But what an extraordinary — "
45257	45303	45216	45216	she	1002	" I said , ' My good Mrs. Lanoline , we have some grave misunderstanding here . Beautiful as I am , my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty , and never , never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine . ' "
45304	45311	45313	45313	Tibby	250	" I hope you were pleased , "
45315	45319	45313	45313	Tibby	250	" Of course , "
45323	45411	45320	45320	Helen	245	" A perfectly delightful experience . Oh , Mrs. Lanoline 's a dear — she asked for a husband as if he was an umbrella . She mislaid him Saturday afternoon — and for a long time suffered no inconvenience . But all night , and all this morning her apprehensions grew . Breakfast did n't seem the same — no , no more did lunch , and so she strolled up to 2 , Wickham Place as being the most likely place for the missing article . "
45412	45418	45216	45216	she	1002	" But how on earth — "
45419	45590	45216	45216	she	1002	" Do n't begin how on earthing . ' I know what I know , ' she kept repeating , not uncivilly , but with extreme gloom . In vain I asked her what she did know . Some knew what others knew , and others did n't , and if they did n't , then others again had better be careful . Oh dear , she was incompetent ! She had a face like a silkworm , and the dining - room reeks of orris - root . We chatted pleasantly a little about husbands , and I wondered where hers was too , and advised her to go to the police . She thanked me . We agreed that Mr. Lanoline 's a notty , notty man , and has n't no business to go on the lardy - da . But I think she suspected me up to the last . Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about this . Now , Meg , remember — bags I. "
45591	45598	45600	45600	Margaret	339	" Bag it by all means , "
45607	45632	45600	45600	Margaret	339	" I 'm not sure that this is so funny , Helen . It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere , does n't it ? "
45633	45655	45216	45216	she	1002	" I do n't think so — she does n't really mind . The admirable creature is n't capable of tragedy . "
45656	45664	45666	45666	Margaret	339	" Her husband may be , though , "
45673	45692	45666	45666	Margaret	339	" Oh , no , not likely . No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs. Lanoline . "
45693	45698	45216	45216	she	1002	" Was she pretty ? "
45699	45708	45666	45666	Margaret	339	" Her figure may have been good once . "
45772	45787	45788	45788	she	339	" Tibby and I have again been wondering where we 'll live next September , "
45793	45804	45788	45788	she	339	" Tibby had better first wonder what he 'll do , "
45941	45947	45938	45938	He	309	" about the lady yesterday . "
45963	45968	45970	45970	Helen	245	" Cheers , children ! "
45972	45978	45970	45970	Helen	245	" It 's Mrs. Lanoline . "
46243	46255	46257	46257	he	309	" You would n't remember giving me this , Miss Schlegel ? "
46262	46272	46257	46257	he	309	" No ; I ca n't say I do . "
46273	46285	46257	46257	he	309	" Well , that was how it happened , you see . "
46286	46303	46257	46257	he	309	" Where did we meet , Mr. Bast ? For the minute I do n't remember . "
46304	46321	46322	46322	he	309	" It was a concert at the Queen 's Hall . I think you will recollect , "
46326	46343	46322	46322	he	309	" when I tell you that it included a performance of the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven . "
46344	46368	46257	46257	he	309	" We hear the Fifth practically every time it 's done , so I 'm not sure — do you remember , Helen ? "
46369	46382	46383	46383	He	309	" Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade ? "
46387	46404	46383	46383	He	309	" Then I do n't remember . That 's the only Beethoven I ever remember specially . "
46405	46424	46257	46257	he	309	" And you , if I may say so , took away my umbrella , inadvertently of course . "
46425	46429	46257	46257	he	309	" Likely enough , "
46433	46451	46430	46430	Helen	245	" for I steal umbrellas even oftener than I hear Beethoven . Did you get it back ? "
46452	46461	46257	46257	he	309	" Yes , thank you , Miss Schlegel . "
46462	46474	46476	46476	Margaret	339	" The mistake arose out of my card , did it ? "
46478	46490	46476	46476	Margaret	339	" Yes , the mistake arose — it was a mistake . "
46491	46512	46513	46513	she	245	" The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too , and that she could find you ? "
46536	46547	46476	46476	Margaret	339	" That 's so , calling too — a mistake . "
46548	46553	46555	46555	Helen	245	" Then why — ? "
46566	46573	46574	46574	he	309	" I said to my wife , "
46577	46662	46574	46574	he	309	rapidly—"I said to Mrs. Bast , ' I have to pay a call on some friends , ' and Mrs. Bast said to me , ' Do go . ' While I was gone , however , she wanted me on important business , and thought I had come here , owing to the card , and so came after me , and I beg to tender my apologies , and hers as well , for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you .

46671	46679	46669	46669	Helen	245	" but I still do n't understand . "
46724	46740	46721	46721	she	245	" I still do n't understand . When did you say you paid this call ? "
46741	46747	46749	46749	he	309	" Call ? What call ? "
46772	46777	46749	46749	he	309	" This afternoon call . "
46778	46786	46787	46787	he	309	" In the afternoon , of course ! "
46814	46821	46802	46802	Tibby	250	" Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon ? "
46822	46827	46749	46749	he	309	" S - Saturday . "
46828	46831	46833	46833	Helen	245	" Really ! "
46835	46854	46833	46833	Helen	245	" and you were still calling on Sunday , when your wife came here . A long visit . "
46855	46863	46865	46866	Mr. Bast	309	" I do n't call that fair , "
46880	46893	46877	46877	his	309	" I know what you mean , and it is n't so . "
46894	46903	46905	46905	Margaret	339	" Oh , do n't let us mind , "
46915	46921	46922	46922	he	309	" It was something else , "
46931	46944	46925	46925	his	309	" I was somewhere else to what you think , so there ! "
46945	46956	46957	46957	she	339	" It was good of you to come and explain , "
46960	46970	46957	46957	she	339	" The rest is naturally no concern of ours . "
46971	46991	46992	46992	Margaret	339	" Yes , but I want — I wanted — have you ever read The Ordeal of Richard Feverel ? "
46995	47033	47034	47034	Helen	245	" It 's a beautiful book . I wanted to get back to the Earth , do n't you see , like Richard does in the end . Or have you ever read Stevenson 's Prince Otto ? "
47040	47059	47060	47060	He	1591	" That 's another beautiful book . You get back to the Earth in that . I wanted — "
47081	47089	47091	47091	Leonard	308	" I walked all the Saturday night , "
47093	47097	47091	47091	Leonard	308	" I walked . "
47130	47148	47128	47128	Helen	245	" No doubt it 's another beautiful book , but I 'd rather hear about your road . "
47149	47155	47128	47128	Helen	245	" Oh , I walked . "
47156	47160	47128	47128	Helen	245	" How far ? "
47161	47181	47128	47128	Helen	245	" I do n't know , nor for how long . It got too dark to see my watch . "
47182	47192	47128	47128	Helen	245	" Were you walking alone , may I ask ? "
47193	47196	47197	47197	he	1591	" Yes , "
47203	47261	47197	47197	he	1591	" but we 'd been talking it over at the office . There 's been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things . The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star , and I looked it up in the celestial atlas , but once out of doors everything gets so mixed — "
47262	47273	47275	47275	Helen	245	" Do n't talk to me about the Pole Star , "
47282	47302	47275	47275	Helen	245	" I know its little ways . It goes round and round , and you go round after it . "
47303	47329	47330	47330	Tibby	250	" Well , I lost it entirely . First of all the street lamps , then the trees , and towards morning it got cloudy . "
47388	47395	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" Where did you start from ? "
47399	47405	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" Do tell us more . "
47406	47465	47365	47365	Helen	245	" I took the Underground to Wimbledon . As I came out of the office I said to myself , ' I must have a walk once in a way . If I do n't take this walk now , I shall never take it . ' I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon , and then — "
47466	47476	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" But not good country there , is it ? "
47477	47512	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" It was gas - lamps for hours . Still , I had all the night , and being out was the great thing . I did get into woods , too , presently . "
47513	47519	47521	47521	Helen	245	" Yes , go on , "
47523	47538	47521	47521	Helen	245	" You 've no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it 's dark . "
47539	47548	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" Did you actually go off the roads ? "
47549	47579	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" Oh yes . I always meant to go off the roads , but the worst of it is that it 's more difficult to find one 's way . "
47580	47590	47592	47592	Margaret	339	" Mr. Bast , you 're a born adventurer , "
47594	47626	47592	47592	Margaret	339	" No professional athlete would have attempted what you 've done . It 's a wonder your walk did n't end in a broken neck . Whatever did your wife say ? "
47627	47637	47639	47639	Helen	245	" Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses , "
47641	47656	47639	47639	Helen	245	" Besides , they ca n't walk . It tires them . Go on . "
47657	47671	47397	47397	Margaret	339	" I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus — "
47672	47692	47592	47592	Margaret	339	" Yes , but the wood . This ' ere wood . How did you get out of it ? "
47693	47789	47639	47639	Helen	245	" I managed one wood , and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill . I rather fancy it was those North Downs , for the road went off into grass , and I got into another wood . That was awful , with gorse bushes . I did wish I 'd never come , but suddenly it got light — just while I seemed going under one tree . Then I found a road down to a station , and took the first train I could back to London . "
47790	47797	47799	47799	Helen	245	" But was the dawn wonderful ? "
47807	47810	47804	47804	he	1597	" No . "
47843	47848	47850	47850	his	1597	" love of the earth "
47882	47895	47867	47867	he	308	" The dawn was only grey , it was nothing to mention — "
47896	47908	48171	48172	a lady	3956	" Just a grey evening turned upside down . I know . "
47909	48147	47867	47867	he	308	" — and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it , and so cold too . I 'm glad I did it , and yet at the time it bored me more than I can say . And besides — you can believe me or not as you choose — I was very hungry . That dinner at Wimbledon — I meant it to last me all night like other dinners . I never thought that walking would make such a difference . Why , when you 're walking you want , as it were , a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well , and I 'd nothing but a packet of Woodbines . Lord , I did feel bad ! Looking back , it was n't what you may call enjoyment . It was more a case of sticking to it . I did stick . I — I was determined . Oh , hang it all ! what 's the good — I mean , the good of living in a room for ever ? There one goes on day after day , same old game , same up and down to town , until you forget there is any other game . You ought to see once in a way what 's going on outside , if it 's only nothing particular after all . "
48148	48156	48158	48158	Helen	245	" I should just think you ought , "
48184	48198	48171	48172	a lady	3956	" Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard Jefferies . "
48199	48223	48229	48229	him	1600	" Excuse me , Mr. Bast , but you 're wrong there . It did n't . It came from something far greater . "
48404	48414	48415	48415	he	308	" Then you do n't think I was foolish ? "
48434	48439	48441	48441	Margaret	339	" Heavens , no ! "
48443	48451	48453	48453	Helen	245	" Heaven help us if we do ! "
48455	48479	48453	48453	Helen	245	" I 'm very glad you say that . Now , my wife would never understand — not if I explained for days . "
48480	48488	48490	48490	Helen	245	" No , it was n't foolish ! "
48496	48511	48490	48490	Helen	245	" You 've pushed back the boundaries ; I think it splendid of you . "
48512	48524	48453	48453	Helen	245	" You 've not been content to dream as we have — "
48525	48533	48453	48453	Helen	245	" Though we have walked , too — "
48534	48543	48490	48490	Helen	245	" I must show you a picture upstairs — "
48563	48594	48551	48552	The hansom	1605	" Oh , bother , not to say dash — I had forgotten we were dining out ; but do , do , come round again and have a talk . "
48595	48603	48605	48605	Margaret	339	" Yes , you must — do , "
48615	48628	48607	48607	Leonard	308	" No , I shall not . It 's better like this . "
48629	48633	48635	48635	Margaret	339	" Why better ? "
48637	48696	48635	48635	Margaret	339	" No , it is better not to risk a second interview . I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life . Really . I mean this . We can never repeat . It has done me real good , and there we had better leave it . "
48697	48709	48752	48752	he	308	" That 's rather a sad view of life , surely . "
48710	48717	48752	48752	he	308	" Things so often get spoiled . "
48718	48722	48724	48724	Helen	245	" I know , "
48726	48732	48724	48724	Helen	245	" but people do n't . "
48823	48842	48820	48820	Helen	245	" Go , then ; perhaps you know best ; but never forget you 're better than Jefferies . "
49161	49166	49148	49149	The undergraduate	1617	" coffee after hall , "
49331	49334	49339	49339	Leonard	308	" that card "
49361	49369	49353	49353	Jacky	314	" What 's that card , eh ? "
49370	49384	49353	49353	Jacky	314	" Yes , do n't you wish you knew what that card was ? "
49385	49393	49353	49353	Jacky	314	" Len , who 's Miss Schlegel ? "
49469	49487	49465	49465	he	308	" A lady took my umbrella , another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella "
49534	49555	49528	49528	he	308	" Well , at all events , she does n't know about that card . Yah ! done her there ! "
49703	49706	49707	49707	he	308	" Well ? "
49718	49736	49707	49707	he	308	" I know where you 've been , but you do n't know where I 've been . "
49742	49752	49737	49737	Jacky	314	" Len , I do think you might explain , "
49968	49972	49974	49975	the mystic	1636	" My conviction , "
49977	49989	49974	49975	the mystic	1636	" gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it , "
50059	50401	50573	50574	Mr. Bast	309	" walking in the dark among the surburban hills ? He discovered that he was going bareheaded down Regent Street . London came back with a rush . Few were about at this hour , but all whom he passed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive because it was unconscious . He put his hat on . It was too big ; his head disappeared like a pudding into a basin , the ears bending outwards at the touch of the curly brim . He wore it a little backwards , and its effect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the moustache . Thus equipped , he escaped criticism . No one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements , the heart of a man ticking fast in his chest . The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure , and when they were both full of the same subject , there were few dinner - parties that could stand up against them . This particular one , which was all ladies , had more kick in it than most , but succumbed after a struggle . Helen at one part of the table , Margaret at the other , would talk of Mr. Bast and of no one else , and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided , fell ruining , and became common property . Nor was this all . The dinner - party was really an informal discussion club ; there was a paper after it , read amid coffee - cups and laughter in the drawing - room , but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest . After the paper came a debate , and in this debate Mr. Bast also figured , appearing now as a bright spot in civilization , now as a dark spot , according to the temperament of the speaker . The subject of the paper had been , "
50411	50469	50470	50474	the millionaire 's eldest son	1641	" the reader professing to be a millionaire on the point of death , inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries , but open to conviction from other sources . The various parts had been assigned beforehand , and some of the speeches were amusing . The hostess assumed the ungrateful role of "
50476	50528	50529	50530	Mr. Bast	309	" and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate Society by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family . Money was the fruit of self - denial , and the second generation had a right to profit by the self - denial of the first . What right had "
50531	50572	50573	50574	Mr. Bast	309	" to profit ? The National Gallery was good enough for the likes of him . After property had had its say — a saying that is necessarily ungracious — the various philanthropists stepped forward . Something must be done for "
50575	50732	50573	50574	Mr. Bast	309	" : his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence ; he must have a free library , or free tennis - courts ; his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was being paid ; it must be made worth his while to join the Territorials ; he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife , the money going to her as compensation ; he must be assigned a Twin Star , some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him ceaselessly ( groans from Helen ) ; he must be given food but no clothes , clothes but no food , a third - return ticket to Venice , without either food or clothes when he arrived there . In short , he might be given anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself . And here Margaret interrupted . "
50740	50748	50749	50749	You	245	" said the reader of the paper . "
50807	50808	50809	50809	Your	245	" "
50824	50828	50817	50817	you	245	" said Margaret . "
50848	50849	50851	50851	I	0	" "
50860	50861	50853	50853	I	0	" "
50909	50910	50891	50891	I	0	" "
50918	50938	50891	50891	I	0	" said an earnest girl , who liked the Schlegels , but thought them a little unspiritual at times . "
50987	50993	50891	50891	I	0	" There was a protest . "
50998	51007	50891	50891	I	0	" added Margaret , but the protest continued . "
51029	51030	51018	51027	the man who has learnt to wear his income properly	1649	" "
51040	51041	51034	51035	Mr. Basts	394	" "
51221	51294	51298	51298	he	309	" She leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to misconstrue her . The female mind , though cruelly practical in daily life , can not bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation , and Miss Schlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things , and what it would profit Mr. Bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul . She answered , "
51314	51319	51920	51920	I	0	" Then they said , "
51327	51529	51321	51321	they	1654	" and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense , where the effort will be taken for the deed , but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this world , will ever know the rarer joys of the body , or attain to clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows . Others had attacked the fabric of Society - Property , Interest , etc . ; she only fixed her eyes on a few human beings , to see how , under present conditions , they could be made happier . Doing good to humanity was useless : the many - coloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an universal grey . To do good to one , or , as in this case , to a few , was the utmost she dare hope for . Between the idealists , and the political economists , Margaret had a bad time . Disagreeing elsewhere , they agreed in disowning her , and in keeping the administration of the millionaire 's money in their own hands . The earnest girl brought forward a scheme of "
51536	51890	51321	51321	they	1654	" the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor . The hostess pertinently remarked that she , as eldest son , might surely rank among the millionaire 's legatees . Margaret weakly admitted the claim , and another claim was at once set up by Helen , who declared that she had been the millionaire 's housemaid for over forty years , overfed and underpaid ; was nothing to be done for her , so corpulent and poor ? The millionaire then read out her last will and testament , in which she left the whole of her fortune to the Chancellor of the Exchequer . Then she died . The serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the playful — in a men 's debate is the reverse more general ? — but the meeting broke up hilariously enough , and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes . Helen and Margaret walked the earnest girl as far as Battersea Bridge Station , arguing copiously all the way . When she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation , and of the great beauty of the evening . They turned back towards Oakley Street . The lamps and the plane - trees , following the line of the embankment , struck a note of dignity that is rare in English cities . The seats , almost deserted , were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress , who had strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide . There is something continental about Chelsea Embankment . It is an open space used rightly , a blessing more frequent in Germany than here . As Margaret and Helen sat down , the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre , an opera - house in which some endless trilogy was performing , and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers , who did not mind losing a little of the second act . "
51893	51894	51321	51321	they	1654	" "
51897	51898	51321	51321	they	1654	" "

52526	52527	52517	52517	He	247	" "
52530	52539	52517	52517	He	247	" said Helen , shuddering from complex causes . "
52545	52546	52517	52517	He	247	" "
52556	52557	52558	52558	Someone	3777	" "
52564	52569	52558	52558	Someone	3777	" he said simply . "
52607	52608	52604	52604	your	0	" "
52618	52633	52634	52634	We	1672	" cried Helen , who always woke up at the advent of a visitor . "
52694	52848	52879	52879	she	253	" The man of business smiled . Since his wife 's death he had almost doubled his income . He was an important figure at last , a reassuring name on company prospectuses , and life had treated him very well . The world seemed in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames , which still flowed inland from the sea . So wonderful to the girls , it held no mysteries for him . He had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at Teddington , and if he and other capitalists thought good , some day it could be shortened again . With a good dinner inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank , he felt that his hands were on all the ropes of life , and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing . "
52855	52866	52879	52879	she	253	" he exclaimed , and laughed in his pleasant way . "
52897	52910	52885	52885	She	253	" I expect we 'd better be doing the same , really . "
52911	52922	52924	52924	Helen	245	" We pretend we 're improving ourselves , you see , "
52964	52998	52954	52954	he	332	" We suppose it is a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate , but , as my sister says , it may be better to breed dogs . "
52999	53046	53097	53097	Margaret	339	" Not at all . I do n't agree with your sister . There 's nothing like a debate to teach one quickness . I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a youngster . It would have helped me no end . "
53047	53051	52954	52954	he	332	" Quickness — ? "
53052	53092	52954	52954	he	332	" Yes . Quickness in argument . Time after time I 've missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I have n't . Oh , I believe in these discussions . "
53176	53190	53192	53192	he	249	" Oh yes , it does n't much matter what subject you take , "
53199	53213	53194	53194	Margaret	339	" But this is going to be far better than the debate itself . "
53221	53230	53231	53231	she	245	" No , I wo n't go on , "
53234	53246	53231	53231	she	245	" I 'll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox . "
53247	53266	53194	53194	Margaret	339	" About Mr. Bast ? Yes , do . He 'll be more lenient to a special case . "
53302	53303	53306	53306	his	1682	" "
53309	53310	53311	53311	Clerk	1683	" "

53318	53319	53311	53311	Clerk	1683	" "
53326	53327	53324	53324	Margaret	339	" "
53333	53334	53338	53344	the nice people who gave Aunt Juley	1684	" "
53613	53632	53633	53633	My	0	" Mr. Wilcox , whose fortune was not so very far below the standard indicated , laughed exuberantly . "
53692	53693	53669	53669	My	0	" "
53696	53705	53669	53669	My	0	" said Margaret . He lowered his voice . "
53726	53737	53669	53669	My	0	" he added , thinking that she had not understood . "
53756	53757	53748	53748	he	1702	" "
53776	53777	53771	53771	him	1702	" "
53786	53787	53788	53788	Decidedly	395	" "
53790	53791	53788	53788	Decidedly	395	" "
53796	53807	53788	53788	Decidedly	395	" Again the Olympian laugh , and the lowered voice . "
53869	53870	53865	53865	I	0	" "
53878	53886	53871	53871	I	0	" murmured Margaret , while Helen said , "
53913	53914	53906	53908	The boot man	1714	" "
53923	53924	53918	53918	he	1714	" "
53928	53932	53918	53918	he	1714	" confessed Margaret . "
53937	53938	53934	53934	you	1710	" "
53950	53951	53941	53941	you	0	" "
53956	53975	53952	53952	I	0	" he interrupted , glancing up and down the Embankment , in case his indiscretion had been overheard . "
54022	54023	54025	54025	I	0	" "
54041	54042	54033	54033	I	0	" "
54051	54057	54033	54033	I	0	" was Helen 's contribution . "
54069	54070	54060	54061	the others	589	" "
54077	54083	54071	54071	You	1719	" said Mr. Wilcox mildly . "
54135	54136	54142	54142	I	0	" "
54145	54186	54142	54142	I	0	" quoted Helen , and he laughed and agreed that it was . When Margaret said that she supposed that clerks , like every one else , found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days , he replied , "
54191	54224	54142	54142	I	0	" and rose to rejoin his friends . He knew by his own office — seldom a vacant post , and hundreds of applicants for it ; at present no vacant post . "
54232	54262	54142	54142	I	0	" said Margaret , wishing to change the subject before they parted . Mr. Wilcox was a little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him . "
54267	54268	54142	54142	I	0	" "
54289	54290	54287	54287	Fate	397	" "
54302	54303	54298	54298	We	1724	" "
54322	54323	54317	54317	Evie	253	" "
54388	54389	54381	54381	you	1722	" "
54398	54399	54381	54381	you	1722	" "
54541	54549	54576	54576	I	0	" He glanced over the parapet cheerfully . "
54625	54626	54576	54576	I	0	" "
54631	54650	54576	54576	I	0	" said Margaret . But the change was in her own voice , which had become most sad . "
54662	54663	54576	54576	I	0	" "
54670	54674	54675	54675	Charles	249	" he replied . "
54680	54681	54675	54675	Charles	249	" "
54684	54698	54675	54675	Charles	249	" said Margaret , who had not kept up with the Charles ' . "
54738	54739	54725	54726	Mrs. Charles	354	" "
54753	54755	54749	54749	Charles	354	chap"—his voice dropped—"thought
54815	54816	54811	54813	the two grandchildren	1748	" "
54832	54840	54817	54817	I	0	" said Margaret as they shook hands . "
54871	54872	54859	54859	I	0	" "
54877	54881	54859	54859	I	0	" he replied . "
54894	54895	54882	54882	I	0	" "
54905	54906	54901	54901	you	0	" "
54981	54982	54972	54972	One	559	" "
55005	55006	55008	55008	mine	0	" "
55010	55014	55008	55008	mine	0	" said Helen . "
55039	55040	55041	55041	You	0	" "
55049	55050	55041	55041	You	0	" "
55054	55058	55041	55041	You	0	" Margaret sighed . "
55067	55132	55155	55155	he	249	" The tide had begun to ebb . Margaret leant over the parapet and watched it sadly . Mr. Wilcox had forgotten his wife , Helen her lover ; she herself was probably forgetting . Every one moving . Is it worth while attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men ? Helen roused her by saying : "
55188	55189	55155	55155	he	249	" "
55202	55203	55200	55200	us	1758	" "
55211	55233	55234	55234	Sugar	399	" Leonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday . But he was right ; the visit proved a conspicuous failure . "
55236	55240	55234	55234	Sugar	399	" said Margaret . "
55243	55247	55234	55234	Sugar	399	" said Helen . "
55293	55353	55283	55283	We	1758	" As a lady 's lap - dog Leonard did not excel . He was not an Italian , still less a Frenchman , in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious repartee . His wit was the Cockney 's ; it opened no doors into imagination , and Helen was drawn up short by "
55365	55369	55356	55357	a lady	3956	" administered waggishly . "
55374	55378	55356	55357	a lady	3956	" she said . "
55382	55383	55379	55379	Ladies	941	" "
55402	55403	55396	55396	me	0	" "
55411	55499	55406	55406	you	1760	" interposed Margaret . He , too , was drawn up short . He would not have these women prying into his work . They were Romance , and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated , with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls , and so were the very tea - cups , with their delicate borders of wild strawberries . But he would not let Romance interfere with his life . There is the devil to pay then . "
55505	55509	55406	55406	you	1760	" he answered . "
55520	55521	55513	55514	the Porphyrion	393	" "
55526	55530	55513	55514	the Porphyrion	393	so"—becoming rather offended . "
55539	55540	55513	55514	the Porphyrion	393	" "
55544	55558	55513	55514	the Porphyrion	393	" asked Helen , who did not follow the workings of his mind . "
55587	55588	55580	55580	you	1760	" "
55601	55605	55590	55590	you	0	" pursued Margaret . "
55613	55614	55609	55609	you	0	" "
55638	55639	55640	55640	I	0	" "
55655	55661	55645	55645	some	1422	" said the employe uneasily . "
55665	55668	55645	55645	some	1422	part"—he shook his head—"I
55706	55746	55699	55699	you	0	" He drank , and wiped his moustache , which was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into tea - cups — more bother than they 're worth , surely , and not fashionable either . "
55771	56013	56014	56014	We	1772	" Leonard had no idea . He understood his own corner of the machine , but nothing beyond it . He desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance , and under these circumstances , another motion of the head seemed safest . To him , as to the British public , the Porphyrion was the Porphyrion of the advertisement — a giant , in the classical style , but draped sufficiently , who held in one hand a burning torch , and pointed with the other to St. Paul 's and Windsor Castle . A large sum of money was inscribed below , and you drew your own conclusions . This giant caused Leonard to do arithmetic and write letters , to explain the regulations to new clients , and re - explain them to old ones . A giant was of an impulsive morality — one knew that much . He would pay for Mrs. Munt 's hearth - rug with ostentatious haste , a large claim he would repudiate quietly , and fight court by court . But his true fighting weight , his antecedents , his amours with other members of the commercial Pantheon — all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of Zeus . While the gods are powerful , we learn little about them . It is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven . "
56023	56027	56014	56014	We	1772	" blurted Helen . "
56040	56041	56037	56037	we	1772	" "
56054	56070	56042	56045	A friend of ours	1774	" said Margaret . Now Leonard had his clue . He must praise the Porphyrion . "
56077	56081	56071	56071	You	1773	" he said , "
56088	56089	56083	56083	he	1775	" "
56094	56138	56083	56083	he	1775	" The young man coloured a little . In his circle to be wrong was fatal . The Miss Schlegels did not mind being wrong . They were genuinely glad that they had been misinformed . To them nothing was fatal but evil . "
56145	56149	56083	56083	he	1775	" he added . "
56157	56158	56159	56159	I	0	" "
56170	56177	56161	56161	I	0	" But this was a blunder . "
56184	56209	56210	56211	Mr. Bast	309	" said the elder woman , quick as lightning . Leonard replied that every one was right partly , if it came to that . "
56245	56253	56230	56230	you	309	" Leonard sat back with a sigh . "
56273	56274	56268	56268	He	1777	" "
56284	56288	56268	56268	He	1777	" concluded Helen . "
56303	56417	56418	56420	the Miss Schlegels	261	" Leonard rubbed his hands . He was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all . But a commercial training was too strong for him . Nor could he say it was a bad thing , for this would be giving it away ; nor yet that it was good , for this would be giving it away equally . He attempted to suggest that it was something between the two , with vast possibilities in either direction , but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes . As yet he scarcely distinguished between the two sisters . One was more beautiful and more lively , but "
56421	56443	56444	56444	One	559	" still remained a composite Indian god , whose waving arms and contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind . "
56449	56455	56444	56444	One	559	" he remarked , adding , "
56465	56578	56457	56457	Ibsen	402	" He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour . Minute after minute slipped away , while the ladies , with imperfect skill , discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend . Leonard grew annoyed — perhaps rightly . He made vague remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by others , but they did not take the hint . Men might have shown more tact . Women , however tactful elsewhere , are heavy - handed here . They can not see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects in a veil . "
56596	56708	56457	56457	Ibsen	402	" And these were women with a theory , who held that reticence about money matters is absurd , and that life would be truer if each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he stands , the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is not money . How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise ? And the precious minutes slipped away , and Jacky and squalor came nearer . At last he could bear it no longer , and broke in , reciting the names of books feverishly . There was a moment of piercing joy when Margaret said , "
56714	56722	56710	56710	you	1780	" and then the door opened , and "
56728	56737	56740	56741	the dears	1781	" entered , preceded by two prancing puppies . "
56752	56763	56745	56745	Evie	253	" screamed Helen , falling on her hands and knees . "
56771	56776	56777	56777	I	0	" said Mr. Wilcox . "
56782	56783	56780	56780	myself	0	" "
56797	56798	56788	56789	Mr. Bast	309	" "
56807	56812	56788	56789	Mr. Bast	309	" said Leonard sourly . "
56821	56822	56825	56825	Ahab	405	" "
56831	56853	56825	56825	Ahab	405	" said Evie , who was one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history . "
56861	56873	56874	56875	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him . "
56889	56890	56874	56875	Mr. Wilcox	249	" "
56894	56924	56874	56875	Mr. Wilcox	249	" said Helen from the floor . Then Leonard 's gorge arose . Why should he come again ? What was the good of it ? He said roundly : "
56939	56948	56931	56931	I	0	" Most people would have let him go . "
56961	56986	56987	56987	I	0	" But the Schlegels had never played with life . They had attempted friendship , and they would take the consequences . Helen retorted , "
57007	57022	56997	56997	you	249	" and suddenly the drawing - room re - echoed to a vulgar row . "
57032	57033	57023	57023	You	249	" "
57036	57037	57023	57023	You	249	" "
57048	57049	57040	57040	you	249	" "
57058	57062	57040	57040	you	249	" cried Helen . "
57068	57069	57040	57040	you	249	" "
57098	57105	57091	57091	you	249	" He turned to Mr. Wilcox . "
57126	57145	57113	57113	I	0	" Mr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air of humorous strength that he could so well command . "
57164	57170	57171	57171	I	0	" But Margaret ignored him . "
57195	57203	57204	57204	I	0	" ( he drawled the word ) . "
57224	57225	57216	57216	I	0	" "
57229	57249	57216	57216	I	0	" said Mr. Wilcox , drawing a gasp from Evie , who knew that her father was becoming dangerous . "
57267	57269	57259	57260	the gentleman	1792	with"—pointing at Margaret—"you
57275	57292	57259	57260	the gentleman	1792	" His voice rose : he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with Jacky . "
57360	57361	57358	57358	I	0	" "
57364	57366	57368	57368	you	0	" said Margaret—"you
57370	57380	57368	57368	you	0	" Laughter from Evie , as at a repartee . "
57394	57398	57399	57399	You	0	" More laughter . "
57404	57407	57399	57399	You	0	" Laughter . "
57439	57440	57431	57431	You	0	" "
57448	57457	57431	57431	You	0	" said Leonard , hot with stupid anger . "
57461	57467	57460	57460	I.	0	" There was a pause . "
57625	57626	57618	57618	we	1795	" "
57637	57641	57618	57618	we	1795	" mumbled Leonard , "
57656	57673	57674	57674	You	0	" He paused . Ahab and Jezebel danced at his boots and made him look ridiculous . "
57698	57705	57707	57708	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Can I help you now ? "
57714	57727	57707	57708	Mr. Wilcox	249	" May I have one quiet word with him in the hall ? "
57728	57746	57747	57747	Helen	245	" Helen , go after him — do anything — anything — to make the noodle understand . "
57750	57754	57747	57747	Helen	245	" But really — "
57759	57764	57747	57747	Helen	245	" Ought she to ? "
57773	57827	57770	57770	He	0	" I would have chimed in , but I felt that you could polish him off for yourselves — I did n't interfere . You were splendid , Miss Schlegel — absolutely splendid . You can take my word for it , but there are very few women who could have managed him . "
57828	57832	57834	57834	Margaret	339	" Oh yes , "
57837	57850	57852	57852	Evie	253	" Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me , "
57854	57859	57852	57852	Evie	253	" Yes , indeed , "
57864	57875	57852	57852	Evie	253	" all that part about ' mechanical cheerfulness'—oh , fine ! "
57876	57882	57884	57884	Margaret	339	" I 'm very sorry , "
57889	57914	57884	57884	Margaret	339	" He 's a nice creature really . I can not think what set him off . It has been most unpleasant for you . "
57915	57923	57925	57925	he	3860	" Oh , I did n't mind . "
57948	57958	57930	57930	He	3860	" Ought n't you really to be more careful ? "
57970	57981	57982	57982	she	339	" Do you realize that it 's all your fault ? "
57985	57990	57982	57982	she	339	" You 're responsible . "
57991	57994	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I ? "
57995	58018	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion . We warn him , and — look ! "
58024	58033	58034	58034	he	249	" I hardly consider that a fair deduction , "
58037	58041	58043	58043	Margaret	339	" Obviously unfair , "
58045	58066	58043	58043	Margaret	339	" I was only thinking how tangled things are . It 's our fault mostly — neither yours nor his . "
58067	58071	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Not his ? "
58072	58075	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" No . "
58076	58085	58043	58043	Margaret	339	" Miss Schlegel , you are too kind . "
58086	58091	58093	58093	Evie	253	" Yes , indeed , "
58099	58175	58093	58093	Evie	253	" You behave much too well to people , and then they impose on you . I know the world and that type of man , and as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been treating him properly . You must keep that type at a distance . Otherwise they forget themselves . Sad , but true . They are n't our sort , and one must face the fact . "
58176	58181	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Ye - es . "
58182	58199	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman . "
58200	58206	58208	58208	Margaret	339	" I admit it willingly , "
58219	58230	58208	58208	Margaret	339	" A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself . "
58240	58248	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" What did he suspect you of ? "
58249	58259	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Of wanting to make money out of him . "
58260	58271	58019	58020	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Intolerable brute ! But how were you to benefit ? "
58272	58308	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Exactly . How indeed ! Just horrible , corroding suspicion . One touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away . Just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes . "
58309	58341	58342	58342	She	339	" I come back to my original point . You ought to be more careful , Miss Schlegel . Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in . "
58348	58366	58342	58342	She	339	" Let me explain exactly why we like this man , and want to see him again . "
58367	58384	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" That 's your clever way of thinking . I shall never believe you like him . "
58385	58439	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I do . Firstly , because he cares for physical adventure , just as you do . Yes , you go motoring and shooting ; he would like to go camping out . Secondly , he cares for something special in adventure . It is quickest to call that special something poetry — "
58440	58451	58342	58342	She	339	" Oh , he 's one of that writer sort . "
58452	58523	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" No — oh no ! I mean he may be , but it would be loathsome stiff . His brain is filled with the husks of books , culture — horrible ; we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing . We want to show him how he may get upsides with life . As I said , either friends or the country , some"—she
58524	58559	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	hesitated—"either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life 's daily grey , and to show that it is grey . If possible , one should have both . "
58584	58631	58576	58576	he	249	" Your mistake is this , and it is a very common mistake . This young bounder has a life of his own . What right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life , or , as you call it , ' grey ' ? "
58632	58635	58342	58342	She	339	" Because — "
58636	58668	58231	58232	Mr. Wilcox	249	" One minute . You know nothing about him . He probably has his own joys and interests — wife , children , snug little home . That 's where we practical fellows"—he
58669	58819	58820	58820	She	1808	smiled—"are more tolerant than you intellectuals . We live and let live , and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere , and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs . I quite grant — I look at the faces of the clerks in my own office , and observe them to be dull , but I do n't know what 's going on beneath . So , by the way , with London . I have heard you rail against London , Miss Schlegel , and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very angry with you . What do you know about London ? You only see civilization from the outside . I do n't say in your case , but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity , discontent , and Socialism . "
58856	58858	58853	58853	she	1808	" second line"—to
58866	58874	58875	58875	she	1808	" His wife is an old bore , "
58879	58902	58875	58875	she	1808	" He never came home last Saturday night because he wanted to be alone , and she thought he was with us . "
58903	58907	58853	58853	she	1808	" With you ? "
58908	58911	58912	58912	Evie	253	" Yes . "
58915	58932	58912	58912	Evie	253	" He has n't got the cosy home that you assumed . He needs outside interests . "
58933	58938	58940	58941	the girl	3912	" Naughty young man ! "
58943	58946	58948	58948	Margaret	339	" Naughty ? "
58957	58973	58948	58948	Margaret	339	" When you 're married , Miss Wilcox , wo n't you want outside interests ? "
58974	58981	58984	58985	Mr. Wilcox	249	" He has apparently got them , "
58988	58995	58984	58985	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Yes , indeed , Father . "
58996	59008	59010	59010	Margaret	339	" He was tramping in Surrey , if you mean that , "
59017	59024	59010	59010	Margaret	339	" Oh , I dare say ! "
59025	59032	58984	58985	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Miss Wilcox , he was ! "
59033	59042	59044	59045	Mr. Wilcox	249	" M - m - m - m ! "
59079	59094	59067	59067	he	249	" He said so , and about such a thing he would n't lie . "
59101	59127	59128	59128	He	249	" That 's where I differ from you . Men lie about their positions and prospects , but not about a thing of that sort . "
59133	59146	59130	59130	his	249	" Miss Schlegel , excuse me , but I know the type . "
59147	59218	59220	59220	she	1814	" I said before — he is n't a type . He cares about adventures rightly . He 's certain that our smug existence is n't all . He 's vulgar and hysterical and bookish , but I do n't think that sums him up . There 's manhood in him as well . Yes , that 's what I 'm trying to say . He 's a real man . "
59380	59409	59364	59364	he	249	" Miss Schlegel , you 're a pair of dear creatures , but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world . What does your brother say ? "
59410	59414	59349	59349	she	339	" I forget . "
59415	59422	59364	59364	he	249	" Surely he has some opinion ? "
59423	59432	59364	59364	he	249	" He laughs , if I remember correctly . "
59433	59443	59445	59445	Evie	253	" He 's very clever , is n't he ? "
59456	59470	59445	59445	Evie	253	" Yes , pretty well — but I wonder what Helen 's doing . "
59471	59483	59485	59486	Mr. Wilcox	249	" She is very young to undertake this sort of thing , "
59511	59514	59515	59515	she	339	" Helen ! "
59518	59521	59515	59515	she	339	" Yes ! "
59529	59534	59515	59515	she	339	" You in there ? "
59535	59544	59545	59545	Margaret	339	" Yes — he 's gone some time . "
59550	59558	59559	59559	she	339	" Why , you 're all alone , "
59562	59577	59559	59559	she	339	" Yes — it 's all right , Meg — Poor , poor creature — "
59578	59598	59545	59545	Margaret	339	" Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later — Mr. W. much concerned , and slightly titillated . "
59599	59649	59559	59559	she	339	" Oh , I 've no patience with him . I hate him . Poor dear Mr. Bast ! he wanted to talk literature , and we would talk business . Such a muddle of a man , and yet so worth pulling through . I like him extraordinarily . "
59650	59654	59656	59656	Margaret	339	" Well done , "
59661	59688	59656	59656	Margaret	339	" but come into the drawing - room now , and do n't talk about him to the Wilcoxes . Make light of the whole thing . "
59711	59719	59720	59720	she	245	" He 's gone with my blessing , "
59723	59729	59720	59720	she	245	" and now for puppies . "
59742	59829	59735	59736	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I am really concerned at the way those girls go on . They are as clever as you make 'em , but unpractical — God bless me ! One of these days they 'll go too far . Girls like that ought n't to live alone in London . Until they marry , they ought to have someone to look after them . We must look in more often — we're better than no one . You like them , do n't you , Evie ? "
59833	59859	59830	59830	Evie	253	" Helen 's right enough , but I ca n't stand the toothy one . And I should n't have called either of them girls . "
60625	60629	60611	60611	She	339	" simply must , "
60843	60856	60862	60862	she	339	" Father might be of the party — yes , Father was . "
60876	60887	60889	60889	he	1883	" I thought I 'd get round if I could , "
60891	60963	60889	60889	he	1883	" Evie told me of her little plan , so I just slipped in and secured a table . Always secure a table first . Evie , do n't pretend you want to sit by your old father , because you do n't . Miss Schlegel , come in my side , out of pity . My goodness , but you look tired ! Been worrying round after your young clerks ? "
60964	60970	60972	60972	Margaret	339	" No , after houses , "
60981	60995	60972	60972	Margaret	339	" I 'm hungry , not tired ; I want to eat heaps . "
60996	61006	60889	60889	he	1883	" That 's good . What 'll you have ? "
61007	61011	61013	61013	she	339	" Fish pie , "
61022	61047	61013	61013	she	339	" Fish pie ! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson 's . It 's not a bit the thing to go for here . "
61048	61057	61059	61059	Margaret	339	" Go for something for me , then , "
61082	61087	61089	61089	he	1883	" Saddle of mutton , "
61094	61133	61089	61089	he	1883	" and cider to drink . That 's the type of thing . I like this place , for a joke , once in a way . It is so thoroughly Old English . Do n't you agree ? "
61134	61137	61139	61139	Margaret	339	" Yes , "
61206	61217	61196	61196	He	410	" No , I did n't ; yes , you did "
61242	61259	61196	61196	He	410	" It 's a golden rule to tip the carver . Tip everywhere 's my motto . "
61260	61269	61196	61196	He	410	" Perhaps it does make life more human . "
61270	61299	61196	61196	He	410	" Then the fellows know one again . Especially in the East , if you tip , they remember you from year 's end to year 's end . "
61307	61308	61196	61196	He	410	" "
61375	61376	61379	61379	I	0	" "
61403	61404	61397	61397	you	249	" "
61410	61411	61406	61406	I	0	" "
61447	61448	61449	61449	Evie	253	" "
61466	61467	61455	61456	Miss Schlegel	245	" "
61474	61493	61455	61456	Miss Schlegel	245	" I want a new home in September , and someone must find it . I ca n't . "
61494	61503	61455	61456	Miss Schlegel	245	" Percy , do you know of anything ? "
61504	61512	61514	61515	Mr. Cahill	410	" I ca n't say I do , "
61517	61528	61514	61515	Mr. Cahill	410	" How like you ! You 're never any good . "
61529	61547	61455	61456	Miss Schlegel	245	" Never any good . Just listen to her ! Never any good . Oh , come ! "
61548	61561	61455	61456	Miss Schlegel	245	" Well , you are n't . Miss Schlegel , is he ? "
61690	61704	61732	61732	She	339	" Right you are ! I 'll cable out to Uganda this evening , "
61711	61724	61732	61732	She	339	" Their Emperor wants war ; well , let him have it , "
61738	61742	61743	61743	she	339	" Next time , "
61749	61763	61743	61743	she	339	" you shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles 's . "
61764	61768	61732	61732	She	339	" With pleasure . "
61769	61777	61778	61778	she	339	" No , you 'd hate it , "
61791	61820	61778	61778	she	339	" It 's all proteids and body - buildings , and people come up to you and beg your pardon , but you have such a beautiful aura . "
61821	61825	61732	61732	She	339	" A what ? "
61826	61853	61854	61854	He	249	" Never heard of an aura ? Oh , happy , happy man ! I scrub at mine for hours . Nor of an astral plane ? "
61865	61904	61854	61854	He	249	" Just so . Luckily it was Helen 's aura , not mine , and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses . I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went . "
61905	61937	61732	61732	She	339	" Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls . No one 's ever asked me about my — what d'ye call it ? Perhaps I 've not got one . "
61938	61961	61732	61732	She	339	" You 're bound to have one , but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it . "
61962	61982	61732	61732	She	339	" Tell me , though , Miss Schlegel , do you really believe in the supernatural and all that ? "
61983	61989	61732	61732	She	339	" Too difficult a question . "
61990	61999	61732	61732	She	339	" Why 's that ? Gruyère or Stilton ? "
62000	62005	61732	61732	She	339	" Gruyère , please . "
62006	62011	61732	61732	She	339	" Better have Stilton . "
62012	62035	61732	61732	She	339	" Stilton . Because , though I do n't believe in auras , and think Theosophy 's only a halfway - house — "
62036	62049	62050	62050	he	1903	" — Yet there may be something in it all the same , "
62057	62100	62101	62101	He	1903	" Not even that . It may be halfway in the wrong direction . I ca n't explain . I do n't believe in all these fads , and yet I do n't like saying that I do n't believe in them . "
62108	62132	62101	62101	He	1903	" So you would n't give me your word that you do n't hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it ? "
62133	62137	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" I could , "
62152	62182	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Indeed , I will . When I talked about scrubbing my aura , I was only trying to be funny . But why do you want this settled ? "
62183	62189	62101	62101	He	1903	" I do n't know . "
62190	62200	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Now , Mr. Wilcox , you do know . "
62201	62207	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Yes , I am , "
62208	62215	62101	62101	He	1903	" No , you 're not , "
62235	62241	62222	62222	Margaret	339	" How 's your house ? "
62242	62254	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Much the same as when you honoured it last week . "
62255	62269	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" I do n't mean Ducie Street . Howards End , of course . "
62270	62277	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Why ' of course ' ? "
62278	62297	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Ca n't you turn out your tenant and let it to us ? We 're nearly demented . "
62298	62378	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Let me think . I wish I could help you . But I thought you wanted to be in town . One bit of advice : fix your district , then fix your price , and then do n't budge . That 's how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton . I said to myself , ' I mean to be exactly here , ' and I was , and Oniton 's a place in a thousand . "
62379	62432	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" But I do budge . Gentlemen seem to mesmerize houses — cow them with an eye , and up they come , trembling . Ladies ca n't . It 's the houses that are mesmerizing me . I 've no control over the saucy things . Houses are alive . No ? "
62433	62441	62442	62442	he	1904	" I 'm out of my depth , "
62448	62461	62442	62442	he	1904	" Did n't you talk rather like that to your office boy ? "
62462	62489	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Did I ? — I mean I did , more or less . I talk the same way to every one — or try to . "
62490	62508	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" Yes , I know . And how much do you suppose that he understood of it ? "
62509	62628	62139	62139	Margaret	339	" That 's his lookout . I do n't believe in suiting my conversation to my company . One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough , but it 's no more like the real thing than money is like food . There 's no nourishment in it . You pass it to the lower classes , and they pass it back to you , and this you call ' social intercourse ' or ' mutual endeavour , ' when it 's mutual priggishness if it 's anything . Our friends at Chelsea do n't see this . They say one ought to be at all costs intelligible , and sacrifice — "
62629	62633	62635	62636	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Lower classes , "
62648	62665	62642	62642	his	249	" Well , you do admit that there are rich and poor . That 's something . "
62687	62733	62678	62678	he	249	" You do admit that , if wealth was divided up equally , in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same . The hard - working man would come to the top , the wastrel sink to the bottom . "
62734	62740	62672	62672	he	249	" Every one admits that . "
62741	62747	62678	62678	he	249	" Your Socialists do n't . "
62748	62794	62678	62678	he	249	" My Socialists do . Yours may n't ; but I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists , but ninepins , which you have constructed for your own amusement . I ca n't imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily . "
62831	62853	62822	62822	he	249	" I do n't care . You 've made two damaging admissions , and I 'm heartily with you in both . "

63281	63292	63262	63262	She	339	" Rubbish , you 're a self - conscious fool ! "
63367	63374	63376	63377	her hostess	1143	" You need n't go though — "
63379	63437	63376	63377	her hostess	1143	" I need n't , but had n't I better ? It 's really getting rather serious . We let chance after chance slip , and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street . We do n't know what we want , that 's the mischief with us — "
63438	63447	63449	63449	Helen	245	" No , we have no real ties , "
63456	63509	63449	63449	Helen	245	" Sha n't I go up to town today , take the house if it 's the least possible , and then come down by the afternoon train tomorrow , and start enjoying myself . I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind . "
63510	63521	63554	63555	his aunt	1926	" But you wo n't do anything rash , Margaret ? "
63522	63530	63449	63449	Helen	245	" There 's nothing rash to do . "
63531	63537	63539	63539	Tibby	250	" Who are the Wilcoxes ? "
63567	63584	63561	63561	she	1926	" I do n't manage the Wilcoxes ; I do n't see where they come in . "
63585	63591	63593	63593	Helen	245	" No more do I , "
63595	63647	63593	63593	Helen	245	" It 's funny that we just do n't lose sight of them . Out of all our hotel acquaintances , Mr. Wilcox is the only one who has stuck . It is now over three years , and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time . "
63656	63657	63658	63658	Meg	339	" "
63678	63679	63670	63670	I	0	" "

63776	63783	63784	63784	I	0	" Then Margaret spoke rather seriously . "
63787	63791	63784	63784	I	0	" she said , "
63821	63822	63784	63784	I	0	" "

63933	63940	63923	63924	Your father	3752	" said Mrs. Munt with asperity , "

63989	63993	63994	63994	I	0	" cried Helen . "

64119	64129	64133	64138	the man who beat the Austrians	1949	" Helen , with her mouth full , cried : "

64170	64174	64168	64168	yourself	623	" said Tibby . "

64198	64303	64194	64194	she	245	" said Helen . Helen might be right , but she did not go up to London . Margaret did that . An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries , and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends . She could not believe that her father had ever felt the same . Her eyes had been troubling her lately , so that she could not read in the train , and it bored her to look at the landscape , which she had seen but yesterday . At Southampton she "
64305	64418	64419	64419	I	0	" to Frieda : Frieda was on her way down to join them at Swanage , and Mrs. Munt had calculated that their trains would cross . But Frieda was looking the other way , and Margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and old - maidish . How like an old maid to fancy that Mr. Wilcox was courting her ! She had once visited a spinster — poor , silly , and unattractive — whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love . How Margaret 's heart had bled for the deluded thing ! How she had lectured , reasoned , and in despair acquiesced ! "
64454	64516	64432	64439	the young fellow who brings the midday post	1955	" It had always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age , yet she might be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity . Mr. Wilcox met her at Waterloo himself . She felt certain that he was not the same as usual ; for one thing , he took offence at everything she said . "
64524	64528	64432	64439	the young fellow who brings the midday post	1955	" she began , "
64552	64553	64548	64550	the Schlegel family	1958	" "
64565	64566	64557	64557	you	1956	" "

64583	64614	64557	64557	you	1956	" She lingered to admire the motor , which was new and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne Aunt Juley to her doom three years before . "
64621	64625	64557	64557	you	1956	" she said . "
64634	64635	64632	64632	Crane	357	" "
64643	64648	64632	64632	Crane	357	" repeated her host . "
64662	64663	64653	64653	you	1956	" "
64698	64699	64700	64700	Evie	253	" "
64702	64709	64700	64700	Evie	253	" he echoed in injured tones . "
64777	64778	64770	64770	I	0	" "
64789	64793	64784	64784	I	0	" Margaret replied . "
64825	64826	64822	64822	Helen	245	" "
64834	64835	64836	64836	Horribly	423	" "
64844	64861	64864	64864	they	1965	" Mr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament contemptuously . The more important ropes of life lay elsewhere . "
64869	64873	64864	64864	they	1965	" said he . "
64881	64882	64875	64875	you	1956	" "
64932	64933	64934	64934	Your	1956	" "
64942	64974	64938	64938	her	4148	" She says ' Yes , ' my brother says ' No , ' to Ducie Street . It 's no fun helping us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . "
64975	64991	64992	64992	Margaret	339	" You are not as unpractical as you pretend . I shall never believe it . "
65255	65256	65260	65260	you	339	" "
65267	65271	65260	65260	you	339	" he remarked . "
65285	65286	65287	65287	I	0	" "
65300	65301	65290	65290	you	249	" "

65322	65341	65315	65315	I	0	" he repeated , suddenly softening and turning to her , as if the remark had pleased him . "
65403	65404	65401	65401	you	339	" "
65411	65420	65401	65401	you	339	" said Margaret , who was keeping herself in hand—"those
65448	65449	65450	65450	I	0	" "
65467	65614	65465	65465	you	339	" He bent nearer ; the sentence died unfinished . Margaret 's head turned very stupid , and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse . He did not kiss her , for the hour was half - past twelve , and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham Palace . But the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on her account , and she was surprised that Crane did not realize this , and turn round . Idiot though she might be , surely Mr. Wilcox was more — how should one put it ? — more psychological than usual . Always a good judge of character for business purposes , he seemed this afternoon to enlarge his field , and to note qualities outside neatness , obedience , and decision . "
65624	65631	65615	65615	I	0	" she announced when they arrived . "
65670	65671	65661	65661	you	1989	" "
65679	65864	65661	65661	you	1989	" And they began their survey . The dining - room was big , but over - furnished . Chelsea would have moaned aloud . Mr. Wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince , and relent , and refrain , and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck . After so much self - colour and self - denial , Margaret viewed with relief the sumptuous dado , the frieze , the gilded wall - paper , amid whose foliage parrots sang . It would never do with her own furniture , but those heavy chairs , that immense side - board loaded with presentation plate , stood up against its pressure like men . The room suggested men , and Margaret , keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past , saw it as an ancient guest - hall , where the lord sat at meat among his thanes . Even the Bible — the Dutch Bible that Charles had brought back from the Boer War — fell into position . Such a room admitted loot . "
65871	65879	65661	65661	you	1989	" The entrance - hall was paved . "
65885	65906	65882	65882	fellows	1993	" We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather . It was as if a motor - car had spawned . "
65911	65921	65882	65882	fellows	1993	" said Margaret , sinking into one of them . "
65927	65947	65922	65922	You	1994	" he said , fixing his eyes on her upturned face , and surely betraying an almost intimate note . "
65961	65962	65922	65922	You	1994	" "
65975	65976	65977	65977	Gillrays	428	" "
65985	65986	65977	65977	Gillrays	428	" "

66033	66034	65977	65977	Gillrays	428	" "
66051	66052	65977	65977	Gillrays	428	" "
66079	66186	66062	66062	you	249	" They proceeded to the drawing - room . Chelsea managed better here . It was sallow and ineffective . One could visualize the ladies withdrawing to it , while their lords discussed life 's realities below , to the accompaniment of cigars . Had Mrs. Wilcox 's drawing - room looked thus at Howards End ? Just as this thought entered Margaret 's brain , Mr. Wilcox did ask her to be his wife , and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly fainted . But the proposal was not to rank among the world 's great love scenes . "
66188	66191	66260	66260	I	0	Schlegel"—his voice was firm—"I
66214	66219	66200	66200	I	0	" Margaret almost answered : "

66237	66238	66226	66226	you	2000	" "
66244	66256	66257	66257	I	0	" she interrupted , holding the piano and averting her eyes . "
66273	66279	66263	66263	I	0	" He began to stammer . "
66290	66291	66285	66285	you	2000	" "
66299	66303	66304	66304	I	0	" said Margaret . "
66313	66326	66327	66327	I	0	" So deep already was her sympathy , that when he said , "
66336	66431	66327	66327	I	0	" she made herself give a little start . She must show surprise if he expected it . An immense joy came over her . It was indescribable . It had nothing to do with humanity , and most resembled the all - pervading happiness of fine weather . Fine weather is due to the sun , but Margaret could think of no central radiance here . She stood in his drawing - room happy , and longing to give happiness . On leaving him she realized that the central radiance had been love . "
66440	66441	66437	66438	Miss Schlegel	246	" "
66448	66529	66444	66444	I	0	" There was a moment 's pause . He was anxious to get rid of her , and she knew it . She had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money can not buy . He desired comradeship and affection , but he feared them , and she , who had taught herself only to desire , and could have clothed the struggle with beauty , held back , and hesitated with him . "
66534	66538	66539	66539	You	0	" she continued . "
66555	66559	66547	66547	I	0	" Thank you . "

66573	66585	66539	66539	You	0	" I may order the motor round , may n't I ? "
66586	66593	66547	66547	I	0	" That would be most kind . "
66594	66608	66539	66539	You	0	" I wish I had written instead . Ought I to have written ? "
66609	66614	66539	66539	You	0	" Not at all . "
66615	66622	66623	66623	She	2004	" There 's just one question — "
66699	66700	66695	66696	those others	2008	" ninnies"—young
66720	66723	66717	66717	she	2004	" loved , "

66907	66915	66899	66899	She	2004	" Oh , sir , this is so sudden"—that
66978	66983	66969	66969	She	2004	" Ich liebe dich , "
67644	67661	67629	67630	Mrs. Munt	258	" And your English lakes — Vindermere , Grasmere — are they , then , unhealthy ? "
67662	67710	67832	67833	Mrs. Munt	258	" No , Frau Liesecke ; but that is because they are fresh water , and different . Salt water ought to have tides , and go up and down a great deal , or else it smells . Look , for instance , at an aquarium . "
67711	67749	67629	67630	Mrs. Munt	258	" An aquarium ! Oh , Meesis Munt , you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt ? Why , when Victor , my brother - in - law , collected many tadpoles — "
67750	67760	67762	67762	Helen	245	" You are not to say ' stink , ' "
67764	67786	67762	67762	Helen	245	" at least , you may say it , but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it . "
67787	67819	67629	67630	Mrs. Munt	258	" Then ' smell . ' And the mud of your Pool down there — does it not smell , or may I say ' stink , ha , ha ' ? "
67820	67830	67832	67833	Mrs. Munt	258	" There always has been mud in Poole Harbour , "
67840	67858	67832	67833	Mrs. Munt	258	" The rivers bring it down , and a most valuable oyster - fishery depends upon it . "
67859	67866	67868	67868	Frieda	326	" Yes , that is so , "
67877	67883	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" ' Bournemouth is , ' "
67899	67958	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" ' Bournemouth is , Poole was , and Swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three . ' Now , Frau Liesecke , I have shown you Bournemouth , and I have shown you Poole , so let us walk backward a little , and look down again at Swanage . "
67959	67971	67832	67833	Mrs. Munt	258	" Aunt Juley , would n't that be Meg 's train ? "
67997	68012	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" Oh , dearest Margaret , I do hope she wo n't be overtired . "
68013	68030	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" Oh , I do wonder — I do wonder whether she 's taken the house . "
68031	68040	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" I hope she has n't been hasty . "
68041	68051	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" So do I — oh , so do I. "
68052	68062	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place ? "
68066	68128	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" I should think it would . Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud . All those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way , and I ca n't think why he does n't keep on with it . But it 's really for Evie that he went there , and now that Evie 's going to be married — "
68129	68132	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" Ah ! "
68133	68149	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" You 've never seen Miss Wilcox , Frieda . How absurdly matrimonial you are ! "
68150	68157	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" But sister to that Paul ? "
68158	68161	67885	67886	their hostess	2061	" Yes . "
68162	68168	68170	68171	Mrs. Munt	258	" And to that Charles , "
68175	68188	68170	68171	Mrs. Munt	258	" Oh , Helen , Helen , what a time that was ! "
68192	68218	68189	68189	Helen	245	" Meg and I have n't got such tender hearts . If there 's a chance of a cheap house , we go for it . "
68219	68298	68299	68299	Frieda	326	" Now look , Frau Liesecke , at my niece 's train . You see , it is coming towards us — coming , coming ; and , when it gets to Corfe , it will actually go through the downs , on which we are standing , so that , if we walk over , as I suggested , and look down on Swanage , we shall see it coming on the other side . Shall we ? "
68419	68423	68425	68425	Helen	245	" You see , "
68430	68550	68425	68425	Helen	245	" the Wilcoxes collect houses as your Victor collects tadpoles . They have , one , Ducie Street ; two , Howards End , where my great rumpus was ; three , a country seat in Shropshire ; four , Charles has a house in Hilton ; and five , another near Epsom ; and six , Evie will have a house when she marries , and probably a pied - à - terre in the country — which makes seven . Oh yes , and Paul a hut in Africa makes eight . I wish we could get Howards End . That was something like a dear little house ! Did n't you think so , Aunt Juley ? "
68551	68566	68568	68569	Mrs. Munt	258	" I had too much to do , dear , to look at it , "
68576	68613	68568	68569	Mrs. Munt	258	" I had everything to settle and explain , and Charles Wilcox to keep in his place besides . It is n't likely I should remember much . I just remember having lunch in your bedroom . "
68614	68668	68425	68425	Helen	245	" Yes so do I. But , oh dear , dear , how dead it all seems ! And in the autumn there began this anti - Pauline movement — you , and Frieda , and Meg , and Mrs. Wilcox , all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry Paul . "
68669	68674	68676	68676	Frieda	326	" You yet may , "
68684	68704	68679	68679	Helen	245	" The Great Wilcox Peril will never return . If I 'm certain of anything it 's of that . "
68705	68720	68679	68679	Helen	245	" One is certain of nothing but the truth of one 's own emotions . "
68864	68867	68869	68870	Aunt Juley	255	" Look ! "
68884	68908	68869	68870	Aunt Juley	255	" Stand where I stand , and you will see the pony - cart coming . I see the pony - cart coming . "
68951	68958	68959	68959	they	2081	" Have you got the house ? "
68998	69005	69006	69006	Margaret	246	" Have you got the house ? "
69011	69025	69008	69008	her	246	" Oh , what a nuisance ! So we 're as we were ? "
69026	69030	69031	69031	She	245	" Not exactly . "
69038	69042	69044	69044	Tibby	250	" Some mystery , "

69109	69128	69106	69106	she	246	" They 've cheek enough for anything , and invariably select one of their first wife 's friends . "
69135	69139	69140	69140	She	246	" That type — "
69147	69156	69140	69140	She	246	" Meg , not anything wrong with you ? "
69157	69162	69164	69164	Margaret	246	" Wait one minute , "
69169	69179	69180	69180	She	246	" But you 've never conceivably — you've never — "
69185	69233	69180	69180	She	246	" Tibby , hurry up through ; I ca n't hold this gate indefinitely . Aunt Juley ! I say , Aunt Juley , make the tea , will you , and Frieda ; we 've got to talk houses , and I 'll come on afterwards . "
69259	69264	69256	69256	herself	246	" Oh , really — "
69275	69279	69281	69281	Helen	245	" Do n't , "
69283	69295	69296	69296	She	245	" do n't , do n't , Meg , do n't ! "
69328	69352	69308	69308	herself	246	" Do n't , do n't do such a thing ! I tell you not to — don't ! I know — don't ! "
69353	69359	69308	69308	herself	246	" What do you know ? "
69360	69365	69367	69367	Helen	245	" Panic and emptiness , "
69369	69373	69367	69367	Helen	245	" Do n't ! "
69378	69404	69375	69375	Margaret	246	" Helen is a little selfish . I have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying . She said : "
69417	69418	69308	69308	herself	246	" "
69427	69450	69308	69308	herself	246	" sobbed Helen . And she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards , stretching her hands towards the view and crying . "
69457	69476	69308	69308	herself	246	" called Margaret , following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills . "
69482	69501	69502	69502	Meg	246	" And suddenly stupidity seized her , and the immense landscape was blurred . But Helen turned back . "
69504	69505	69502	69502	Meg	246	" "
69518	69526	69506	69506	I	0	" said Margaret , wiping her eyes . "
69534	69547	69527	69527	We	2091	" Then Helen wiped hers , and they even laughed a little . "
69554	69555	69527	69527	We	2091	" "

69875	69879	69871	69871	you	0	" Margaret considered . "
69892	69896	69871	69871	you	0	" she said . "
69920	69925	69926	69926	Margaret	246	" But loved him ? "
69988	69991	69981	69981	she	246	" No . "
69992	69997	69981	69981	she	246	" But you will ? "
69998	70001	70003	70003	Margaret	246	" Yes , "
70005	70024	70003	70003	Margaret	246	" of that I 'm pretty sure . Indeed , I began the moment he spoke to me . "
70025	70033	69981	69981	she	246	" And have settled to marry him ? "
70034	70062	70003	70003	Margaret	246	" I had , but am wanting a long talk about it now . What is it against him , Helen ? You must try and say . "
70072	70079	70080	70080	she	245	" It is ever since Paul , "
70084	70095	70080	70080	she	245	" But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul ? "
70096	70164	70165	70165	She	245	" But he was there , they were all there that morning when I came down to breakfast , and saw that Paul was frightened — the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen , so that I knew it was impossible , because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever , and not this outer life of telegrams and anger . "
70191	70311	70165	70165	She	245	" That 's foolish . In the first place , I disagree about the outer life . Well , we 've often argued that . The real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love - making and yours . Yours — was romance ; mine will be prose . I 'm not running it down — a very good kind of prose , but well considered , well thought out . For instance , I know all Mr. Wilcox 's faults . He 's afraid of emotion . He cares too much about success , too little about the past . His sympathy lacks poetry , and so is n't sympathy really . I 'd even say"—she
70316	70335	70345	70345	Helen	245	lagoons—"that , spiritually , he 's not as honest as I am . Does n't that satisfy you ? "
70336	70343	70345	70345	Helen	245	" No , it does n't , "
70347	70361	70345	70345	Helen	245	" It makes me feel worse and worse . You must be mad . "
70369	70412	70362	70362	Margaret	246	" I do n't intend him , or any man or any woman , to be all my life — good heavens , no ! There are heaps of things in me that he does n't , and shall never , understand . "
70517	70522	70523	70523	she	246	" So with him , "
70526	70565	70523	70523	she	246	" There are heaps of things in him — more especially things that he does — that will always be hidden from me . He has all those public qualities which you so despise and enable all this — "
70578	70675	70566	70566	She	246	" If Wilcoxes had n't worked and died in England for thousands of years , you and I could n't sit here without having our throats cut . There would be no trains , no ships to carry us literary people about in , no fields even . Just savagery . No — perhaps not even that . Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm . More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it . There are times when it seems to me — "
70676	70691	70568	70568	her	246	" And to me , and to all women . So one kissed Paul . "
70692	70697	70699	70699	Margaret	246	" That 's brutal , "
70701	70715	70699	70699	Margaret	246	" Mine is an absolutely different case . I 've thought things out . "
70716	70731	70568	70568	her	246	" It makes no difference thinking things out . They come to the same . "
70732	70735	70699	70699	Margaret	246	" Rubbish ! "
70751	70757	70759	70759	Helen	245	" One would lose something , "
71123	71129	71130	71130	they	2126	" Men did produce this , "
71552	71569	71549	71549	she	246	" Do you remember the Embankment at Chelsea ? It ca n't be ten days ago . "
71570	71573	71574	71574	he	349	" Yes , "
71579	71598	71574	71574	he	349	" And you and your sister were head and ears deep in some Quixotic scheme . Ah well ! "
71599	71610	71549	71549	she	246	" I little thought then , certainly . Did you ? "
71611	71626	71549	71549	she	246	" I do n't know about that ; I should n't like to say . "
71627	71634	71635	71635	she	246	" Why , was it earlier ? "
71638	71657	71635	71635	she	246	" Did you think of me this way earlier ! How extraordinarily interesting , Henry ! Tell me . "
71693	71696	71688	71688	He	349	" interesting , "
71714	71722	71723	71723	she	246	" I did n't think of it , "
71726	71805	71723	71723	she	246	" No ; when you spoke to me in the drawing - room , that was practically the first . It was all so different from what it 's supposed to be . On the stage , or in books , a proposal is — how shall I put it ? — a full - blown affair , a kind of bouquet ; it loses its literal meaning . But in life a proposal really is a proposal — "
71806	71811	71688	71688	He	349	" By the way — "
71812	71820	71821	71821	she	246	" — a suggestion , a seed , "
71832	71863	71821	71821	she	246	" I was thinking , if you did n't mind , that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk ; there will be so much to settle . "
71864	71886	71688	71688	He	349	" I think so too . Tell me , in the first place , how did you get on with Tibby ? "
71887	71892	71688	71688	He	349	" With your brother ? "
71893	71899	71821	71821	she	246	" Yes , during cigarettes . "
71900	71906	71688	71688	He	349	" Oh , very well . "
71907	71913	71914	71914	she	246	" I am so glad , "
71921	71932	71914	71914	she	246	" What did you talk about ? Me , presumably . "
71933	71938	71688	71688	He	349	" About Greece too . "
71939	71970	71688	71688	He	349	" Greece was a very good card , Henry . Tibby 's only a boy still , and one has to pick and choose subjects a little . Well done . "
71971	71987	71914	71914	she	246	" I was telling him I have shares in a currant - farm near Calamata . "
72006	72007	71688	71688	He	349	" "
72012	72013	71688	71688	He	349	" "

72110	72116	72117	72117	You	2154	" She said more gravely : "
72132	72133	72129	72129	I	0	" "
72136	72137	72141	72141	you	2154	" "

72166	72171	72159	72159	I	0	" he said negligently . "

72205	72206	72196	72197	Percy Cahill	410	" "
72294	72298	72300	72300	Margaret	246	" Poor fellow ! "
72311	72343	72300	72300	Margaret	246	" Charles being the elder son , some day Charles will have Howards End ; but I am anxious , in my own happiness , not to be unjust to others . "
72344	72349	72350	72350	she	246	" Of course not , "
72360	72374	72350	72350	she	246	" You mean money . How stupid I am ! Of course not ! "
72386	72428	72378	72378	he	249	" Yes . Money , since you put it so frankly . I am determined to be just to all — just to you , just to them . I am determined that my children shall have no case against me . "
72429	72435	72436	72436	she	246	" Be generous to them , "
72440	72444	72436	72436	she	246	" Bother justice ! "
72445	72460	72378	72378	he	249	" I am determined — and have already written to Charles to that effect — "
72461	72469	72378	72378	he	249	" But how much have you got ? "
72470	72473	72436	72436	she	246	" What ? "
72474	72487	72378	72378	he	249	" How much have you a year ? I 've six hundred . "
72488	72492	72378	72378	he	249	" My income ? "
72493	72526	72436	72436	she	246	" Yes . We must begin with how much you have , before we can settle how much you can give Charles . Justice , and even generosity , depend on that . "
72527	72538	72539	72539	he	2165	" I must say you 're a downright young woman , "
72550	72560	72539	72539	he	2165	" What a question to spring on a fellow ! "
72561	72579	72436	72436	she	246	" Do n't you know your income ? Or do n't you want to tell it me ? "
72580	72583	72436	72436	she	246	" I — "
72584	72588	72589	72589	she	246	" That 's all right"—now
72591	72639	72436	72436	she	246	him—"don't tell me . I do n't want to know . I can do the sum just as well by proportion . Divide your income into ten parts . How many parts would you give to Evie , how many to Charles , how many to Paul ? "
72640	72696	72436	72436	she	246	" The fact is , my dear , I had n't any intention of bothering you with details . I only wanted to let you know that — well , that something must be done for the others , and you 've understood me perfectly , so let 's pass on to the next point . "
72697	72705	72707	72707	Margaret	246	" Yes , we 've settled that , "
72715	72748	72707	72707	Margaret	246	" Go ahead ; give away all you can , bearing in mind I 've a clear six hundred . What a mercy it is to have all this money about one ! "
72749	72767	72768	72768	Helen	245	" We 've none too much , I assure you ; you 're marrying a poor man . "
72776	72780	72768	72768	Helen	245	" she continued . "
72876	72877	72862	72862	One	559	" "

72931	72956	72925	72925	you	2173	" She raised her voice , as too often , and some youths , who were also taking the evening air , overheard her . "
72964	72978	72979	72979	I	0	" said one . Mr. Wilcox turned on them , and said sharply , "
72982	72987	72979	72979	I	0	" There was silence . "
72999	73042	72996	72997	the police	4466	" They moved away quietly enough , but were only biding their time , and the rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter . Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it , he said : "
73060	73061	73051	73051	We	2175	" "
73084	73085	73067	73067	Henry	349	" "
73093	73100	73067	73067	Henry	349	" he asked , rather dryly . "
73167	73174	73178	73178	you	2178	" He blew out his cheeks . "
73277	73461	73505	73505	my	0	" Margaret could not help laughing . It was the first she had heard of the mews behind Ducie Street . When she was a possible tenant it had suppressed itself , not consciously , but automatically . The breezy Wilcox manner , though genuine , lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative for truth . When Henry lived in Ducie Street he remembered the mews ; when he tried to let he forgot it ; and if anyone had remarked that the mews must be either there or not , he would have felt annoyed , and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatizing the speaker as academic . So does my grocer stigmatize me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas , and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas , and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price ? It is a flaw inherent in the business mind , and Margaret may do well to be tender to it , considering all that the business mind has done for England . "

73630	73663	73621	73628	the men to whom we give the vote	2192	" observed Mr. Wilcox , omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as clerks — work that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men . "
73679	73735	73741	73741	your	2193	" He turned as he spoke , and prepared to see her back to The Bays . The business was over . His hotel was in the opposite direction , and if he accompanied her his letters would be late for the post . She implored him not to come , but he was obdurate . "

73855	73953	73850	73850	Margaret	246	" A younger woman might have resented his masterly ways , but Margaret had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss . She was , in her own way , as masterly . If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak , whom all might tread , but whom the snows made nightly virginal . Disdaining the heroic outfit , excitable in her methods , garrulous , episodical , shrill , she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt . He mistook her fertility for weakness . He supposed her "
73961	74059	74060	74060	Margaret	246	" but no more , not realizing that she was penetrating to the depths of his soul , and approving of what she found there . And if insight were sufficient , if the inner life were the whole of life , their happiness has been assured . They walked ahead briskly . The parade and the road after it were well lighted , but it was darker in Aunt Juley 's garden . As they were going up by the side - paths , through some rhododendrons , Mr. Wilcox , who was in front , said "
74061	74271	74272	74272	You	2200	" rather huskily , turned , dropped his cigar , and took her in his arms . She was startled , and nearly screamed , but recovered herself at once , and kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own . It was their first kiss , and when it was over he saw her safely to the door and rang the bell for her , but disappeared into the night before the maid answered it . On looking back , the incident displeased her . It was so isolated . Nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it , and , worse still , no tenderness had ensued . If a man can not lead up to passion he can at all events lead down from it , and she had hoped , after her complaisance , for some interchange of gentle words . But he had hurried away as if ashamed , and for an instant she was reminded of Helen and Paul . Charles had just been scolding his Dolly . She deserved the scolding , and had bent before it , but her head , though bloody , was unsubdued , and her chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder . "

He and Dolly are sitting in deck - chairs , and their motor is regarding them placidly from its garage across the lawn . A short - frocked edition of Charles also regards them placidly ; a perambulator edition is squeaking ; a third edition is expected shortly . Nature is turning out Wilcoxes in this peaceful abode , so that they may inherit the earth . Margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow . Mature as he was , she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion . Without it we are meaningless fragments , half monks , half beasts , unconnected arches that have never joined into a man . With it love is born , and alights on the highest curve , glowing against the grey , sober against the fire . Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of these outspread wings . The roads of his soul lie clear , and he and his friends shall find easy - going . It was hard - going in the roads of Mr. Wilcox 's soul . From boyhood he had neglected them . "
74950	75091	74938	74938	I	0	" Outwardly he was cheerful , reliable , and brave ; but within , all had reverted to chaos , ruled , so far as it was ruled at all , by an incomplete asceticism . Whether as boy , husband , or widower , he had always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad , a belief that is desirable only when held passionately . Religion had confirmed him . The words that were read aloud on Sunday to him and to other respectable men were the words that had once kindled the souls of St. Catharine and St. Francis into a white - hot hatred of the carnal . He could - not be as the saints and love the Infinite with a seraphic ardour , but he could be a little ashamed of loving a wife . "
75097	75231	74938	74938	I	0	" And it was here that Margaret hoped to help him . It did not seem so difficult . She need trouble him with no gift of her own . She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul , and in the soul of every man . Only connect ! That was the whole of her sermon . Only connect the prose and the passion , and both will be exalted , and human love will be seen at its height . Live in fragments no longer . Only connect , and the beast and the monk , robbed of the isolation that is life to either , will die . Nor was the message difficult to give . It need not take the form of a good "
75234	75366	74938	74938	I	0	" By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty . But she failed . For there was one quality in Henry for which she was never prepared , however much she reminded herself of it : his obtuseness . He simply did not notice things , and there was no more to be said . He never noticed that Helen and Frieda were hostile , or that Tibby was not interested in currant plantations ; he never noticed the lights and shades that exist in the grayest conversation , the finger - posts , the milestones , the collisions , the illimitable views . Once — on another occasion — she scolded him about it . He was puzzled , but replied with a laugh : "
75387	75388	75372	75372	I	0	" "
75397	75401	75372	75372	I	0	" she protested . "
75414	75418	75372	75372	I	0	" He answered : "
75432	75483	75372	75372	I	0	" And this morning he concentrated with a vengeance . They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday . In the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun . She was with Helen , who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled . "
75489	75508	75372	75372	I	0	" she cried , and took him by one hand , retaining her sister 's in the other . "
75519	75523	75517	75517	Helen	245	" Helen replied , "
75531	75532	75528	75529	Mr. Wilcox	249	" "

75641	75657	75639	75639	Porphyrion	393	" he said absently , as he took his own letter out of his pocket . "
75662	75670	75639	75639	Porphyrion	393	" she exclaimed , dropping his hand . "

75804	75888	75796	75796	you	246	" Helen had dropped her hand now , and he had steered her past the whole party to the seaward side of the house . Beneath them was the bourgeois little bay , which must have yearned all through the centuries for just such a watering - place as Swanage to be built on its margin . The waves were colourless , and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further touch of insipidity , drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for excursionists . "

75924	75944	75922	75922	Henry	349	" Her manner was so serious that he stopped , and asked her a little sharply what she wanted . "

76486	76512	76515	76516	Mr. Wilcox	249	" But he left her to intercept Mrs. Munt , whose voice could be heard in the distance : to be intercepted himself by Helen . "
76522	76534	76515	76516	Mr. Wilcox	249	" she began , and went scarlet all over her face . "
76540	76548	76549	76549	Dempster	443	" called Margaret , catching them up . "

76680	76705	76673	76673	I	0	" Mr. Wilcox , intent on his business with Mrs. Munt , was going steadily on , but the last remark made him say : "

76728	76729	76730	76730	You	245	" "
76735	76742	76730	76730	You	245	" He looked at his watch . "

76897	76901	76890	76895	A man who had little money	2244	" she repeated , "
76926	76927	76954	76955	no one	693	" "
76933	76938	76954	76955	no one	693	" he protested pleasantly . "

77053	77059	77015	77017	an extravagant imbecile	2254	" He raised his finger . "
77067	77068	77015	77017	an extravagant imbecile	2254	" "

77200	77206	77165	77166	the Porphyrion	393	" Helen quivered with indignation . "

77355	77372	77326	77326	You	246	" ( his voice grew complacent ; it always did when he eliminated the personal ) , "
77387	77395	77396	77396	you	246	" ( and now it was a respectful voice)—"and
77418	77419	77396	77396	you	246	" "
77427	77436	77437	77437	You	246	" flashed Helen . He stared at her . "
77447	77488	77489	77489	She	2271	" It was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about God in that neurotic modern way . Fraternal to the last , he left her for the quieter company of Mrs. Munt . He thought , "
77496	77504	77489	77489	She	2271	" Helen looked out at the sea . "
77514	77519	77512	77512	Henry	349	" advised her sister . "
77528	77529	77512	77512	Henry	349	" "
77545	77550	77531	77531	he	349	" said Helen slowly . "
77637	77638	77639	77639	He	349	" "
77655	77656	77650	77650	Helen	245	" "

77678	77679	77670	77670	you	246	" "
77687	77695	77683	77685	an old maid	1116	" said Helen , biting her lip . "
77708	77779	77780	77780	Margaret	246	" She shook off her sister 's hand and went into the house . Margaret , distressed at the day 's beginning , followed the Bournemouth steamer with her eyes . She saw that Helen 's nerves were exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the bounds of politeness . There might at any minute be a real explosion , which even Henry would notice . Henry must be removed . "
77782	77787	77788	77788	Magsy	445	" her aunt called . "
77812	77813	77798	77799	Mr. Wilcox	249	" "
77819	77826	77798	77799	Mr. Wilcox	249	" was Margaret 's prompt reply ; "
77846	77847	77842	77843	the Charles	249	" "
77862	77870	77842	77843	the Charles	249	" said Mrs. Munt , coming nearer . "
77880	77881	77882	77882	I	0	" "
77887	77894	77882	77882	I	0	" Mr. Wilcox rejoined her with , "
77905	77998	77897	77897	I	0	" A wave of tenderness came over her . She put a hand on either shoulder , and looked deeply into the black , bright eyes . What was behind their competent stare ? She knew , but was not disquieted . Margaret had no intention of letting things slide , and the evening before she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding . She censured her , not for disapproving of the engagement , but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of mystery . Helen was equally frank . "
78001	78013	77897	77897	I	0	" she said , with the air of one looking inwards , "
78040	78119	78124	78124	him	2281	" Helen in those days was over - interested in the subconscious self . She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life , and spoke of mankind as puppets , whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war . Margaret pointed out that if she dwelt on this she , too , would eliminate the personal . Helen was silent for a minute , and then burst into a queer speech , which cleared the air . "
78143	78151	78140	78140	you	2282	" Margaret denied that there was anything to "
78155	78160	78140	78140	you	2282	" but she continued : "
78289	78290	78284	78284	you	2282	" "
78310	78311	78312	78312	You	2282	" "
78501	78514	78629	78629	I	0	" Margaret was grateful for this expression of affection , and answered , "
78517	78626	78629	78629	I	0	" All vistas close in the unseen — no one doubts it — but Helen closed them rather too quickly for her taste . At every turn of speech one was confronted with reality and the absolute . Perhaps Margaret grew too old for metaphysics , perhaps Henry was weaning her from them , but she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that so readily shreds the visible . The business man who assumes that this life is everything , and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing , fail , on this side and on that , to hit the truth . "
78640	78744	78632	78632	dear	629	" Aunt Juley had hazarded in earlier years . No ; truth , being alive , was not halfway between anything . It was only to be found by continuous excursions into either realm , and though proportion is the final secret , to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility . Helen , agreeing here , disagreeing there , would have talked till midnight , but Margaret , with her packing to do , focussed the conversation on Henry . She might abuse Henry behind his back , but please would she always , be civil to him in company ? "
78758	78762	78751	78751	I	0	" promised Helen . "
78773	78819	78751	78751	I	0	" This conversation made Margaret easier . Their inner life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been incredible to Aunt Juley , and impossible for Tibby or Charles . There are moments when the inner life actually "
78822	79088	78751	78751	I	0	" when years of self - scrutiny , conducted for no ulterior motive , are suddenly of practical use . Such moments are still rare in the West ; that they come at all promises a fairer future . Margaret , though unable to understand her sister , was assured against estrangement , and returned to London with a more peaceful mind . The following morning , at eleven o'clock , she presented herself at the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company . She was glad to go there , for Henry had implied his business rather than described it , and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth . Not that a visit to the office cleared things up . There was just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason , of electric - light globes blossoming in triplets , of little rabbit hutches faced with glass or wire , of little rabbits . And even when she penetrated to the inner depths , she found only the ordinary table and Turkey carpet , and though the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa , it was a very ordinary map . Another map hung opposite , on which the whole continent appeared , looking like a whale marked out for blubber , and by its side was a door , shut , but Henry 's voice came through it , dictating a "
79090	79149	79249	79249	She	4044	" letter . She might have been at the Porphyrion , or Dempster 's Bank , or her own wine - merchant 's . Everything seems just alike in these days . But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial side of the company rather than its West African , and Imperialism always had been one of her difficulties . "
79153	79207	79249	79249	She	4044	" called Mr. Wilcox on receiving her name . He touched a bell , the effect of which was to produce Charles . Charles had written his father an adequate letter — more adequate than Evie 's , through which a girlish indignation throbbed . And he greeted his future stepmother with propriety . "
79227	79232	79233	79233	I	0	" was his opening . "
79298	79299	79300	79300	I	0	" "
79306	79319	79300	79300	I	0	" said Margaret , feeling , for the first time , shy . "
79367	79368	79358	79358	He	398	" "
79381	79389	79369	79369	I	0	" called Henry from the inner chamber . "
79397	79398	79392	79392	he	398	" "
79406	79407	79408	79409	Poor fellow	4887	" "
79411	79412	79408	79409	Poor fellow	4887	" "
79416	79424	79425	79425	He	398	" said Mr. Wilcox , joining them . "
79453	79454	79448	79448	Charles	249	" "
79462	79467	79457	79457	I	0	" said Charles modestly . "

79520	79521	79487	79487	he	398	" "

79540	79541	79527	79527	Dolly	336	" "
79548	79608	79544	79545	Mr. Bryce	448	" asked Margaret . But nobody cared . Mr. Bryce was the tenant , who had no right to sublet ; to have defined him further was a waste of time . On his misdeeds they descanted profusely , until the girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with it . Mr. Wilcox added his signature . "
79615	79884	79544	79545	Mr. Bryce	448	" said he . A motor - drive , a form of felicity detested by Margaret , awaited her . Charles saw them in , civil to the last , and in a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away . But it was not an impressive drive . Perhaps the weather was to blame , being grey and banked high with weary clouds . Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely intended for motorists . Did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through Westmoreland that he missed it ? and if Westmoreland can be missed , it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye . Hertfordshire is England at its quietest , with little emphasis of river and hill ; it is England meditative . If Drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem , he would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature , with hair obfuscated by the London smoke . Their eyes would be sad , and averted from their fate towards the Northern flats , their leader not Isis or Sabrina , but the slowly flowing Lea . No glory of raiment would be theirs , no urgency of dance ; but they would be real nymphs . The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped , for the Great North Road was full of Easter traffic . But he went quite quick enough for Margaret , a poor - spirited creature , who had chickens and children on the brain . "
79890	79895	79885	79885	They	2306	" said Mr. Wilcox . "
79909	79910	79896	79896	They	2306	" "
79920	79921	79916	79916	they	2306	" "
79929	79933	79934	79934	One	559	" he answered . "
79970	80249	80357	80357	you	2313	" She looked at the scenery . It heaved and merged like porridge . Presently it congealed . They had arrived . Charles 's house on the left ; on the right the swelling forms of the Six Hills . Their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her . They interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards Hilton . Beyond them she saw meadows and a wood , and beneath them she settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried . She hated war and liked soldiers — it was one of her amiable inconsistencies . But here was Dolly , dressed up to the nines , standing at the door to greet them , and here were the first drops of the rain . They ran in gaily , and after a long wait in the drawing - room sat down to the rough - and - ready lunch , every dish in which concealed or exuded cream . Mr. Bryce was the chief topic of conversation . Dolly described his visit with the key , while her father - in - law gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all she said . It was evidently the custom to laugh at Dolly . He chaffed Margaret , too , and Margaret , roused from a grave meditation , was pleased , and chaffed him back . Dolly seemed surprised , and eyed her curiously . After lunch the two children came down . Margaret disliked babies , but hit it off better with the two - year - old , and sent Dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him . "
80258	80345	80357	80357	you	2313	" said Mr. Wilcox . She came , but refused to kiss them : it was such hard luck on the little things , she said , and though Dolly proffered Chorly - worly and Porgly - woggles in turn , she was obdurate . By this time it was raining steadily . The car came round with the hood up , and again she lost all sense of space . In a few minutes they stopped , and Crane opened the door of the car . "
80350	80354	80357	80357	you	2313	" asked Margaret . "
80360	80374	80357	80357	you	2313	" said Henry . A little porch was close up against her face . "
80380	80381	80382	80382	We	2314	" "
80385	80386	80382	80382	We	2314	" "
80401	80434	80382	80382	We	2314	" Smiling , but somehow disillusioned , she jumped out , and her impetus carried her to the front - door . She was about to open it , when Henry said : "
80450	80505	80506	80506	Margaret	246	" As he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm , no one replied . He also wanted to know who had left the front gate open , since a cow had strayed in from the road , and was spoiling the croquet lawn . Then he said rather crossly : "
80529	80536	80506	80506	Margaret	246	" May n't I come too ? "
80537	80549	80506	80506	Margaret	246	" No ; I shall be back before I 'm gone . "
80748	80755	80757	80757	Margaret	246	" Naughty cow ! Go away ! "
81322	81330	81302	81302	Helen	245	" You will have to lose something . "
81409	81416	81417	81417	she	245	" Is that you , Henry ? "
81431	81439	81417	81417	she	245	" Henry , have you got in ? "
81525	81537	81499	81500	A woman	1002	" Oh ! Well , I took you for Ruth Wilcox . "
81541	81549	81538	81538	Margaret	335	" I — Mrs. Wilcox — I ? "
81550	81571	81499	81500	A woman	1002	" In fancy , of course — in fancy . You had her way of walking . Good - day . "
81582	81590	81592	81593	Mr. Wilcox	249	" It gave her quite a turn , "
81606	81703	81704	81704	He	249	" None of you girls have any nerves , really . Of course , a word from me put it all right , but silly old Miss Avery — she frightened you , did n't she , Margaret ? There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds . She might have said something , instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on . I passed her as I came in . Enough to make the car shy . I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character ; some old maids do . "
81709	81736	81704	81704	He	249	" It is their last resource . Heaven knows what she was doing in the place ; but that 's Bryce 's business , not mine . "
81737	81747	81749	81749	Margaret	335	" I was n't as foolish as you suggest , "
81751	81766	81749	81749	Margaret	335	" She only startled me , for the house had been silent so long . "
81767	81776	81778	81778	Dolly	336	" Did you take her for a spook ? "
81782	81784	81749	81749	Margaret	335	" spooks "

81795	81799	81792	81793	the unseen	2374	" Not exactly . "
81800	81807	81809	81809	Henry	349	" She really did frighten you , "
81820	81834	81809	81809	Henry	349	" Poor Margaret ! And very naturally . Uneducated classes are so stupid . "
81835	81842	81843	81843	Margaret	452	" Is Miss Avery uneducated classes ? "
81861	81965	81848	81848	herself	452	" She 's just one of the crew at the farm . People like that always assume things . She assumed you 'd know who she was . She left all the Howards End keys in the front lobby , and assumed that you 'd seen them as you came in , that you 'd lock up the house when you 'd done , and would bring them on down to her . And there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm . Lack of education makes people very casual . Hilton was full of women like Miss Avery once . "
81966	81976	81998	81998	Dolly	336	" I should n't have disliked it , perhaps . "
81977	81987	81989	81989	Dolly	336	" Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present , "
82009	82027	81998	81998	Dolly	336	" But Charles said I must try not to mind , because she had known his grandmother . "
82028	82043	81998	81998	Dolly	336	" As usual , you 've got the story wrong , my good Dorothea . "
82044	82079	82080	82080	Her	336	" I mean great - grandmother — the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house . Were n't both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End , too , was a farm ? "
82139	82246	82131	82131	Dolly	336	" Then had n't Mrs. Wilcox a brother — or was it an uncle ? Anyhow , he popped the question , and Miss Avery , she said ' No . ' Just imagine , if she 'd said ' Yes , ' she would have been Charles 's aunt . ( Oh , I say,—that 's rather good ! ' Charlie 's Aunt ' ! I must chaff him about that this evening . ) And the man went out and was killed . Yes , I 'm certain I 've got it right now . Tom Howard — he was the last of them . "
82247	82252	82254	82255	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I believe so , "
82258	82269	82271	82271	Dolly	336	" I say ! Howards End — Howard 's Ended ! "
82273	82285	82271	82271	Dolly	336	" I 'm rather on the spot this evening , eh ? "
82286	82297	82131	82131	Dolly	336	" I wish you 'd ask whether Crane 's ended . "
82298	82308	82131	82131	Dolly	336	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox , how can you ? "
82309	82329	82330	82330	he	249	" Because , if he has had enough tea , we ought to go.—Dolly 's a good little woman , "
82333	82355	82330	82330	he	249	" but a little of her goes a long way . I could n't live near her if you paid me . "
82479	82483	82486	82486	Henry	349	" Curious mounds , "
82488	82498	82486	82486	Henry	349	" but in with you now ; another time . "

82802	82808	82792	82792	He	349	" It is so unlucky , "
82813	82918	82792	82792	He	349	" that money was n't put into it about fifty years ago . Then it had four — five - times the land — thirty acres at least . One could have made something out of it then — a small park , or at all events shrubberies , and rebuilt the house farther away from the road . What 's the good of taking it in hand now ? Nothing but the meadow left , and even that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things — yes , and the house too . Oh , it was no joke . "
82949	83078	82942	82942	them	2404	" Mismanagement did it — besides , the days for small farms are over . It does n't pay — except with intensive cultivation . Small holdings , back to the land — ah ! philanthropic bunkum . Take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale . Most of the land you see ( they were standing at an upper window , the only one which faced west ) belongs to the people at the Park — they made their pile over copper — good chaps . Avery 's Farm , Sishe's — what they call the Common , where you see that ruined oak — one after the other fell in , and so did this , as near as is no matter . "
83106	83218	83093	83093	he	349	" When I had more control I did what I could : sold off the two and a half animals , and the mangy pony , and the superannuated tools ; pulled down the outhouses ; drained ; thinned out I do n't know how many guelder - roses and elder - trees ; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a hall , and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was . Garage and so on came later . But one could still tell it 's been an old farm . And yet it is n't the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew . "
83496	83499	83500	83500	he	249	" Extraordinary ! "
83503	83508	83500	83500	he	249	" Who told you ? "
83509	83519	83525	83525	she	2410	" I heard of it one winter in London , "
83598	83608	83609	83609	she	253	" But I never dreamt of such a thing , "
83612	83639	83609	83609	she	253	" Dad took me to call now and then , and made me ask her to Simpson 's . Well , I 'm altogether off Dad . "
83669	83674	83657	83657	Evie	253	" as a protest . "
83973	83991	83968	83968	She	246	" Oh , So - and - so 's a good sort — a thundering good sort , "

86060	86068	86058	86058	Charles	249	" and Albert will do the talking . "
86069	86081	86083	86083	Margaret	246	" I want to go back , though , I say ! "

86152	86158	86160	86160	Charles	249	" Stopping 's no good , "
86162	86167	86169	86169	Margaret	246	" Is n't it ? "
86202	86208	86210	86210	Charles	249	" You 've hurt yourself , "
86216	86224	86225	86225	she	246	" Of course I 've hurt myself ! "
86228	86234	86225	86225	she	246	" May I ask what — "
86235	86242	86244	86244	Margaret	246	" There 's nothing to ask , "
86246	86252	86244	86244	Margaret	246	" Your hand 's bleeding . "
86253	86257	86225	86225	she	246	" I know . "
86258	86270	86225	86225	she	246	" I 'm in for a frightful row from the pater . "
86271	86282	86283	86283	Charles	249	" You should have thought of that sooner , Charles . "
86349	86355	86356	86356	he	249	" It 's all right ! "
86359	86371	86356	86356	he	249	" It was n't a dog , it was a cat . "
86372	86375	86377	86377	Charles	249	" There ! "
86380	86388	86377	86377	Charles	249	" It 's only a rotten cat . "
86419	86456	86457	86458	Miss Schlegel	245	" But Margaret walked forward steadily . Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl ? Ladies sheltering behind men , men sheltering behind servants — the whole system 's wrong , and she must challenge it . "
86471	86472	86473	86473	I	0	" "
86480	86484	86473	86473	I	0	" said Margaret . "
86493	86502	86490	86491	Mr. Fussell	468	" The second motor came round the corner . "
86510	86525	86508	86508	madam	4053	" said Crane in his turn . He had taken to calling her madam . "
86534	86535	86538	86538	madam	4053	" "
86548	86549	86550	86550	She	3912	" "
86557	86566	86550	86550	She	3912	" said Angelo from the third motor thoughtfully . "
86574	86726	86569	86569	you	245	" The Italian spread out his hands , implying that he had not thought of rudeness , but would produce it if it pleased her . The situation became absurd . The gentlemen were again buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers of assistance , and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand . She yielded , apologizing slightly , and was led back to the car , and soon the landscape resumed its motion , the lonely cottage disappeared , the castle swelled on its cushion of turf , and they had arrived . No doubt she had disgraced herself . But she felt their whole journey from London had been unreal . They had no part with the earth and its emotions . They were dust , and a stink , and cosmopolitan chatter , and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they . "
86731	86735	86729	86729	Henry	349	" she exclaimed , "
86742	86753	86754	86754	We	2548	" for she had decided to take up this line . "
86775	86783	86784	86784	Your	349	" She held out her bandaged hand . "
86792	86813	86786	86786	Meg	246	" Mr. Wilcox looked bewildered . In evening dress , he was standing to welcome his guests in the hall . "
86820	86825	86786	86786	Meg	246	" added Mrs. Warrington . "
86834	86839	86840	86841	A dog'll	2552	" said Colonel Fussell . "
86845	86846	86840	86841	A dog'll	2552	" "
86854	86855	86852	86852	Margaret	246	" "
86868	86869	86864	86864	my	0	" "
86877	86894	86864	86864	my	0	" She obeyed , as did the others . Mr. Wilcox then turned to his son . "
86903	87238	86897	86897	Charles	249	" Charles was absolutely honest . He described what he believed to have happened . Albert had flattened out a cat , and Miss Schlegel had lost her nerve , as any woman might . She had been got safely into the other car , but when it was in motion had leapt out — again , in spite of all that they could say . After walking a little on the road , she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry . His father accepted this explanation , and neither knew that Margaret had artfully prepared the way for it . It fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature . In the smoking - room , after dinner , the Colonel put forward the view that Miss Schlegel had jumped it out of devilry . Well he remembered as a young man , in the harbour of Gibraltar once , how a girl — a handsome girl , too — had jumped overboard for a bet . He could see her now , and all the lads overboard after her . But Charles and Mr. Wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in Miss Schlegel 's case . Charles was depressed . That woman had a tongue . She would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them . He strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over . The evening was exquisite . On three sides of him a little river whispered , full of messages from the west ; above his head the ruins made patterns against the sky . He carefully reviewed their dealings with this family , until he fitted Helen , and Margaret , and Aunt Juley into an orderly conspiracy . Paternity had made him suspicious . He had two children to look after , and more coming , and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men . "
87245	87249	87250	87251	the pater	2209	" he reflected , "
87321	87363	87404	87404	himself	2209	" He looked enviously at the Grange , whose windows poured light and laughter . First and last , this wedding would cost a pretty penny . Two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace , and as the syllables "
87365	87400	87404	87404	himself	2209	" were wafted to his ears , he guessed that one of them was his aunt . She might have helped him , if she too had not had a family to provide for . "
87406	87677	87404	87404	himself	2209	" he repeated — a maxim which had cheered him in the past , but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of Oniton . He lacked his father 's ability in business , and so had an ever higher regard for money ; unless he could inherit plenty , he feared to leave his children poor . As he sat thinking , one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow ; he recognized her as Margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm , and put out his cigar , lest the gleam should betray him . She climbed up the mound in zigzags , and at times stooped down , as if she was stroking the turf . It sounds absolutely incredible , but for a moment Charles thought that she was in love with him , and had come out to tempt him . Charles believed in temptresses , who are indeed the strong man 's necessary complement , and having no sense of humour , he could not purge himself of the thought by a smile . Margaret , who was engaged to his father , and his sister 's wedding - guest , kept on her way without noticing him , and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point . But what was she doing ? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs ? As she edged round the keep , she must have got to leeward and smelt his cigar - smoke , for she exclaimed , "
87684	87690	87691	87691	Saxon	471	" Charles made no answer . "
87695	87704	87691	87691	Saxon	471	" she continued , laughing in the darkness . "
87748	87755	87691	87691	Saxon	471	dear"—she was now moving back towards the house—"what
87762	87763	87764	87765	That woman	2206	" "
87769	88454	87764	87765	That woman	2206	" thought Charles , and compressed his lips . In a few minutes he followed her indoors , as the ground was getting damp . Mists were rising from the river , and presently it became invisible , though it whispered more loudly . There had been a heavy downpour in the Welsh hills . Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula . The weather promised well , and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that Margaret watched it . Presently she saw the keep , and the sun painted the rubble gold , and charged the white sky with blue . The shadow of the house gathered itself together and fell over the garden . A cat looked up at her window and mewed . Lastly the river appeared , still holding the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders , and only visible as far as a hill , which cut off its upper reaches . Margaret was fascinated by Oniton . She had said that she loved it , but it was rather its romantic tension that held her . The rounded Druids of whom she had caught glimpses in her drive , the rivers hurrying down from them to England , the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills , thrilled her with poetry . The house was insignificant , but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy , and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it , and of the conversion of Henry himself to a rural life . Society , too , promised favourably . The rector of the parish had dined with them last night , and she found that he was a friend of her father 's , and so knew what to find in her . She liked him . He would introduce her to the town . While , on her other side , Sir James Bidder sat , repeating that she only had to give the word , and he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round . Whether Sir James , who was Garden Seeds , had promised what he could perform , she doubted , but so long as Henry mistook them for the county families when they did call , she was content . Charles and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn . They were going for a morning dip , and a servant followed them with their bathing - dresses . She had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast , but saw that the day was still sacred to men , and amused herself by watching their contretemps . In the first place the key of the bathing - shed could not be found . Charles stood by the riverside with folded hands , tragical , while the servant shouted , and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden . Then came a difficulty about a spring - board , and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow , with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies . If Margaret wanted to jump from a motor - car , she jumped ; if Tibby thought paddling would benefit his ankles , he paddled ; if a clerk desired adventure , he took a walk in the dark . But these athletes seemed paralysed . They could not bathe without their appliances , though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream . Had they found the life of the body after all ? Could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat them , even on their own ground ? She thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day — no worrying of servants , no appliances , beyond good sense . Her reflections were disturbed by the quiet child , who had come out to speak to the cat , but was now watching her watch the men . She called , "
88461	88494	88459	88459	dear	629	" a little sharply . Her voice spread consternation . Charles looked round , and though completely attired in indigo blue , vanished into the shed , and was seen no more . "
88500	88510	88495	88496	Miss Wilcox	404	" the child whispered , and then became unintelligible . "
88515	88520	88495	88496	Miss Wilcox	404	" It sounded like , "
88529	88530	88531	88531	I	0	" "
88536	88537	88531	88531	I	0	" "
88547	88651	88531	88531	I	0	" Gathering that the wedding - dress was on view , and that a visit would be seemly , she went to Evie 's room . All was hilarity here . Evie , in a petticoat , was dancing with one of the Anglo - Indian ladies , while the other was adoring yards of white satin . They screamed , they laughed , they sang , and the dog barked . Margaret screamed a little too , but without conviction . She could not feel that a wedding was so funny . Perhaps something was missing in her equipment . Evie gasped : "
88669	88792	88793	88793	Burton	474	" Then Margaret went down to breakfast . Henry was already installed ; he ate slowly and spoke little , and was , in Margaret 's eyes , the only member of their party who dodged emotion successfully . She could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife . Yet he dwelt intact , only issuing orders occasionally — orders that promoted the comfort of his guests . He inquired after her hand ; he set her to pour out the coffee and Mrs. Warrington to pour out the tea . When Evie came down there was a moment 's awkwardness , and both ladies rose to vacate their places . "
88795	88799	88793	88793	Burton	474	" called Henry , "
88810	88866	88871	88871	thy	2564	" It was n't genuine tact , but it was tact , of a sort — the sort that is as useful as the genuine , and saves even more situations at Board meetings . Henry treated a marriage like a funeral , item by item , never raising his eyes to the whole , and "
88881	88933	88874	88874	Love	434	" one would exclaim at the close . After breakfast she claimed a few words with him . It was always best to approach him formally . She asked for the interview , because he was going on to shoot grouse tomorrow , and she was returning to Helen in town . "
88938	88942	88936	88936	dear	629	" said he . "
88956	88957	88953	88953	you	629	" "
88960	88961	88953	88953	you	629	" "
88970	88971	88962	88962	I	0	" "
88985	89183	88981	88981	you	0	" Glancing at his watch , he talked of the nasty curve at the lych - gate . She heard him with interest . Her surface could always respond to his without contempt , though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him . She had abandoned any plan of action . Love is the best , and the more she let herself love him , the more chance was there that he would set his soul in order . Such a moment as this , when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future home , was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to him . Each lift of his eyes , each parting of the thatched lip from the clean - shaven , must prelude the tenderness that kills the Monk and the Beast at a single blow . Disappointed a hundred times , she still hoped . She loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness . Whether he droned trivialities , as today , or sprang kisses on her in the twilight , she could pardon him , she could respond . "
89191	89195	88981	88981	you	0	" she suggested , "
89232	89233	89263	89263	she	2573	" "
89301	89302	89292	89293	the Colonel	5128	" "
89311	89316	89303	89303	You	2568	" said Margaret thoughtfully . "
89320	89495	89497	89497	your	2579	" She knew why not , but said that she did not know . He then announced that , unless she had anything special to say , he must visit the wine - cellar , and they went off together in search of Burton . Though clumsy and a little inconvenient , Oniton was a genuine country house . They clattered down flagged passages , looking into room after room , and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties . The wedding - breakfast must be in readiness when they came back from church , and tea would be served in the garden . The sight of so many agitated and serious people made Margaret smile , but she reflected that they were paid to be serious , and enjoyed being agitated . Here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing Evie up into nuptial glory . A little boy blocked their way with pig - tails . His mind could not grasp their greatness , and he said : "
89506	89655	89656	89656	We	2580	" Henry asked him where Burton was . But the servants were so new that they did not know one another 's names . In the still - room sat the band , who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee , and who were already drinking beer . Scents of Araby came from the kitchen , mingled with cries . Margaret knew what had happened there , for it happened at Wickham Place . One of the wedding dishes had boiled over , and the cook was throwing cedar - shavings to hide the smell . At last they came upon the butler . Henry gave him the keys , and handed Margaret down the cellar - stairs . Two doors were unlocked . She , who kept all her wine at the bottom of the linen - cupboard , was astonished at the sight . "
89663	90057	89656	89656	We	2580	" she cried , and the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood , and exchanged smiles . She felt as if she had again jumped out of the car while it was moving . Certainly Oniton would take some digesting . It would be no small business to remain herself , and yet to assimilate such an establishment . She must remain herself , for his sake as well as her own , since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies ; and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty , since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable . Her only ally was the power of Home . The loss of Wickham Place had taught her more than its possession . Howards End had repeated the lesson . She was determined to create new sanctities among these hills . After visiting the wine - cellar , she dressed , and then came the wedding , which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it . Everything went like one o'clock . Mr. Cahill materialized out of space , and was waiting for his bride at the church door . No one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses , or trod on Evie 's train , or cried . In a few minutes — the clergymen performed their duty , the register was signed , and they were back in their carriages , negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych - gate . Margaret was convinced that they had not been married at all , and that the Norman church had been intent all the time on other business . There were more documents to sign at the house , and the breakfast to eat , and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party . There had been a great many refusals , and after all it was not a very big affair — not as big as Margaret 's would be . She noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet , that outwardly she might give Henry what was proper . But inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of Sunday church and fox - hunting . If only someone had been upset ! But this wedding had gone off so particularly well—"quite
90061	90217	90218	90218	I	0	" in the opinion of Lady Edser , and she thoroughly agreed with her . So the wasted day lumbered forward , the bride and bridegroom drove off , yelling with laughter , and for the second time the sun retreated towards the hills of Wales . Henry , who was more tired than he owned , came up to her in the castle meadow , and , in tones of unusual softness , said that he was pleased . Everything had gone off so well . She felt that he was praising her , too , and blushed ; certainly she had done all she could with his intractable friends , and had made a special point of kowtowing to the men . They were breaking camp this evening : only the Warringtons and quiet child would stay the night , and the others were already moving towards the house to finish their packing . "
90226	90230	90218	90218	I	0	" she agreed . "
90305	90306	90294	90294	she	4127	" "
90310	90315	90294	90294	she	4127	" he said gravely . "

90417	90445	90406	90407	The Alexandrina	478	" she echoed , more occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys , and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey . "
90452	90453	90406	90407	The Alexandrina	478	" "
90466	90555	90558	90559	those people	2592	" Then she turned westward , to gaze at the swirling gold . Just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it . Fairyland must lie above the bend , and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past Charles 's bathing - shed . She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled , and when they moved back to the house , she could not recognize the faces of people who were coming out of it . A parlour - maid was preceding them . "
90561	90565	90558	90559	those people	2592	" she asked . "
90570	90574	90568	90568	callers	2593	" exclaimed Henry . "
90582	90583	90580	90580	callers	2593	" "

90627	90719	90624	90624	I	0	" He thanked her . Margaret went forward , smiling socially . She supposed that these were unpunctual guests , who would have to be content with vicarious civility , since Evie and Charles were gone , Henry tired , and the others in their rooms . She assumed the airs of a hostess ; not for long . For one of the group was Helen — Helen in her oldest clothes , and dominated by that tense , wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery days . "
90724	90728	90624	90624	I	0	" she called . "
90739	90757	90736	90736	Tibby	250	" Helen spoke to her two companions , who fell back . Then she bore forward furiously . "

91019	91028	91017	91017	you	245	" she repeated , as anger filled her , "

91120	91127	91057	91057	people	3797	" said Helen , ominously calm . "
91131	91148	91057	91057	people	3797	" conceded Margaret , who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel . "
91176	91187	91188	91188	Margaret	246	" It 's our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox . "
91204	91222	91196	91196	She	246	" He 's going to Scotland . I know he is . I insist on seeing him . "
91223	91228	91196	91196	She	246	" Yes , tomorrow . "
91229	91238	91196	91196	She	246	" I knew it was our last chance . "
91239	91248	91250	91250	Margaret	246	" How do you do , Mr. Bast ? "
91258	91273	91250	91250	Margaret	246	" This is an odd business . What view do you take of it ? "
91274	91282	91284	91284	Helen	245	" There is Mrs. Bast , too , "
91446	91451	91453	91454	the lady	1008	" You have fainted , "
91462	91471	91453	91454	the lady	1008	" Perhaps the air will do you good . "
91491	91502	91504	91504	Leonard	308	" I 'm sure I do n't want to intrude , "
91513	91541	91504	91504	Leonard	308	" But you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the Porphyrion that I wondered — why , I wondered whether — "
91542	91554	91556	91556	Helen	245	" Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again , "
91558	91579	91556	91556	Helen	245	" Meg , this has been a cheerful business . A bright evening 's work that was on Chelsea Embankment . "
91590	91613	91587	91588	Mr. Bast	309	" I do n't understand . You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern , did n't you ? "
91614	91619	91504	91504	Leonard	308	" That 's right . "
91620	91628	91587	91588	Mr. Bast	309	" And went into a bank instead ? "
91629	91636	91638	91638	Helen	245	" I told you all that , "
91640	91673	91638	91638	Helen	245	" and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month , and now he 's penniless , and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame . "
91674	91680	91681	91681	Leonard	308	" I hate all this , "
91684	91738	91681	91681	Leonard	308	" I hope you do , Mr. Bast . But it 's no good mincing matters . You have done yourself no good by coming here . If you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox , and to call him to account for a chance remark , you will make a very great mistake . "
91739	91749	91751	91751	Helen	245	" I brought them . I did it all , "
91753	91818	91751	91751	Helen	245	" I can only advise you to go at once . My sister has put you in a false position , and it is kindest to tell you so . It 's too late to get to town , but you 'll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton , where Mrs. Bast can rest , and I hope you 'll be my guests there . "
91819	91830	91832	91832	Leonard	308	" That is n't what I want , Miss Schlegel , "
91834	91862	91832	91832	Leonard	308	" You 're very kind , and no doubt it 's a false position , but you make me miserable . I seem no good at all . "
91863	91870	91872	91872	Helen	245	" It 's work he wants , "
91874	91880	91882	91882	he	308	" Ca n't you see ? "
91885	91931	91882	91882	he	308	" Jacky , let 's go . We 're more bother than we 're worth . We 're costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us , and they never will . There 's nothing we 're good enough to do . "
91932	91941	91943	91943	Margaret	246	" We would like to find you work , "
91947	91994	91943	91943	Margaret	246	" We want to — I , like my sister . You 're only down in your luck . Go to the hotel , have a good night 's rest , and some day you shall pay me back the bill , if you prefer it . "
92010	92021	92022	92022	he	308	" You do n't know what you 're talking about , "
92025	92184	92185	92185	He	2625	" I shall never get work now . If rich people fail at one profession , they can try another . Not I. I had my groove , and I 've got out of it . I could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary , but that 's all . Poetry 's nothing , Miss Schlegel . One 's thoughts about this and that are nothing . Your money , too , is nothing , if you 'll understand me . I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job , it 's all over with him . I have seen it happen to others . Their friends gave them money for a little , but in the end they fall over the edge . It 's no good . It 's the whole world pulling . There always will be rich and poor . "
92188	92197	92199	92199	Margaret	246	" Wo n't you have something to eat ? "
92201	92269	92199	92199	Margaret	246	" I do n't know what to do . It is n't my house , and though Mr. Wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time — as I say , I do n't know what to do , but I undertake to do what I can for you . Helen , offer them something . Do try a sandwich , Mrs. Bast . "
92338	92362	92335	92335	She	246	" Helen , I like Mr. Bast . I agree that he 's worth helping . I agree that we are directly responsible . "
92363	92372	92335	92335	She	246	" No , indirectly . Via Mr. Wilcox . "
92373	92431	92335	92335	She	246	" Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude , I 'll do nothing . No doubt you 're right logically , and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about Henry . Only , I wo n't have it . So choose . Helen looked at the sunset . "

92901	92924	92925	92925	She	1002	" No ; business . They wanted to see me , and later on I want to talk to you about them . "

93001	93033	92960	92960	Henry	349	" Oh , not five minutes ; but there 's a sting at the end of it , for I want you to find the man some work in your office . "

94003	94011	93983	93983	Jacky	314	" There now , I love you . "
94012	94020	93983	93983	Jacky	314	" Henry , I am awfully sorry . "
94021	94026	94027	94027	he	314	" And pray why ? "
94052	94061	94043	94043	He	314	" To have brought this down on you . "
94062	94068	93983	93983	Jacky	314	" Pray do n't apologize . "
94073	94083	94085	94085	Margaret	246	" Why does she call you ' Hen ' ? "
94088	94096	94085	94085	Margaret	246	" Has she ever seen you before ? "
94097	94102	94104	94104	Jacky	314	" Seen Hen before ! "
94106	94134	94104	94104	Jacky	314	" Who has n't seen Hen ? He 's serving you like me , my dear . These boys ! You wait — Still we love 'em . "
94135	94141	94142	94142	Henry	349	" Are you now satisfied ? "
94151	94162	94163	94163	she	246	" I do n't know what it is all about , "
94166	94172	94163	94163	she	246	" Let 's come in . "
94193	94199	94200	94200	he	349	" Do n't you indeed ? "
94204	94220	94200	94200	he	349	" I do . Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan . "
94221	94231	94163	94163	she	246	" This is Helen 's plan , not mine . "
94232	94289	94291	94291	she	2673	" I now understand your interest in the Basts . Very well thought out . I am amused at your caution , Margaret . You are quite right — it was necessary . I am a man , and have lived a man 's past . I have the honour to release you from your engagement . "
94328	94332	94335	94335	her	2673	" So that — "
94349	94353	94355	94356	Colonel Fussell	463	" So what ? "
94368	94387	94355	94356	Colonel Fussell	463	" We were saying — Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument , my point being — "
94414	94422	94424	94424	Henry	349	" No , let me do that , "
94428	94441	94424	94424	Henry	349	" Thanks so much ! You see — he has forgiven me ! "
94447	94513	94424	94424	Henry	349	" I do n't expect there 's much to forgive . He got into the car . The ladies followed him after an interval . Maids , courier , and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch — line . Still chattering , still thanking their host and patronizing their future hostess , the guests were home away . Then Margaret continued : "
94522	94523	94442	94443	The Colonel	5128	" "
94532	94536	94524	94524	You	5128	" he replied . "
94541	94542	94524	94524	You	5128	" "
94545	94546	94524	94524	You	5128	" "
94551	94552	94524	94524	You	5128	" "
94557	94681	94524	94524	You	5128	" She left him without a word . For it was not her tragedy : it was Mrs. Wilcox 's . Helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in making some people ill and others angry . Now that the wave of excitement was ebbing , and had left her , Mr. Bast , and Mrs. Bast stranded for the night in a Shropshire hotel , she asked herself what forces had made the wave flow . At all events , no harm was done . Margaret would play the game properly now , and though Helen disapproved of her sister 's methods , she knew that the Basts would benefit by them in the long run . "
94688	94714	94524	94524	You	5128	" she explained to Leonard , who had put his wife to bed , and was sitting with her in the empty coffee - room . "
94763	94764	94765	94765	I	0	" "
94775	94784	94772	94773	Miss Schlegel	245	" was all that Leonard felt equal to . "
94903	94904	94899	94899	you	2680	" "
94912	94913	94899	94899	you	2680	" "
94988	95014	94976	94977	Pierpont Morgan	484	" Leonard roused himself . If his benefactress wanted intellectual conversation , she must have it . She was more important than his ruined past . "
95022	95026	95015	95015	I	0	" he said . "
95042	95043	95040	95040	egoists	2685	" "
95052	95056	95040	95040	egoists	2685	" replied Helen . "
95153	95165	95132	95132	I	0	" Leonard was silent for a moment . Then he said : "
95188	95189	95175	95175	you	245	" "
95193	95194	95175	95175	you	245	" "
95200	95201	95175	95175	you	245	" "
95205	95226	95175	95175	you	245	" repeated Helen , a little sharply . She was annoyed with Margaret , but did not want her discussed . "
95234	95235	95232	95232	I.	0	" "
95245	95246	95240	95240	he	249	" "
95261	95262	95257	95258	Mr. Wilcox	249	" "
95269	95430	95431	95431	his	2690	" he agreed . Helen asked herself why she had snubbed him . Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticize , and then had pulled him up short . Was she afraid of him presuming ? If so , it was disgusting of her . But he was thinking the snub quite natural . Everything she did was natural , and incapable of causing offence . While the Miss Schlegels were together he had felt them scarcely human — a sort of admonitory whirligig . But a Miss Schlegel alone was different . She was in Helen 's case unmarried , in Margaret 's about to be married , in neither case an echo of her sister . A light had fallen at last into this rich upper world , and he saw that it was full of men and women , some of whom were more friendly to him than others . Helen had become "
95432	95643	95644	95645	Mrs. Bast	384	" Miss Schlegel , who scolded him and corresponded with him , and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence . Margaret , though not unkind , was severe and remote . He would not presume to help her , for instance . He had never liked her , and began to think that his original impression was true , and that her sister did not like her either . Helen was certainly lonely . She , who gave away so much , was receiving too little . Leonard was pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about Mr. Wilcox . Jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn . After the first shock , he did not mind for himself . By now he had no illusions about his wife , and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure . To keep perfection perfect , that should be his ideal , if the future gave him time to have ideals . Helen , and Margaret for Helen 's sake , must not know . Helen disconcerted him by fuming the conversation to his wife . "
95655	95665	95648	95648	she	2691	" she asked , half mischievously , and then , "
95671	95672	95667	95667	she	2691	" "
95682	95686	95676	95676	she	2691	" said Leonard . "
95694	95695	95688	95688	I	0	" "
95707	95708	95688	95688	I	0	" "
95720	95728	95709	95710	Mr. Bast	309	" Leonard blushed up to his eyes . "
95744	95745	95742	95742	you	0	" "
95756	95757	95751	95752	Miss Schlegel	245	" "
95783	95794	95795	95795	I	0	" He did not deny it , but said shyly : "

95870	95871	95866	95866	you	0	" "

95916	95927	95904	95904	they	2696	" Helen began to pace up and down the room . "
95936	95941	95904	95904	they	2696	" she said gently . "
95947	95980	95904	95904	they	2696	" He could answer this . His parents , who were dead , had been in trade ; his sisters had married commercial travellers ; his brother was a lay - reader . "
95985	96000	95904	95904	they	2696	" Leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now . "
96008	96012	95904	95904	they	2696	" he said , "
96020	96021	96001	96001	They	2701	" "
96028	96029	96030	96030	Lincolnshire	488	" "

96093	96094	96081	96082	Mrs. Bast	384	" "
96137	96142	96131	96131	they	2710	" He was silent . "
96150	96156	96145	96145	I	0	" said Helen very gravely . "
96170	96171	96163	96164	Miss Schlegel	245	" "
96228	96281	96215	96215	I	0	" Leonard left it at that — so long as she did not guess the man . She stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds . The hotel looked over a dark square . The mists had begun . When she turned back to him her eyes were shining . "
96287	96291	96284	96284	you	2712	" he pleaded . "
96357	96358	96395	96395	you	0	" "
96364	96365	96395	96395	you	0	" "
96372	96373	96395	96395	you	0	" "
96381	96392	96395	96395	you	0	" said Helen , with a catch in her throat . "
96415	96416	96395	96395	you	0	" "
96428	96432	96395	96395	you	0	" he answered . "
96522	96523	96509	96509	I	0	" "
96527	96536	96509	96509	I	0	" asked Helen , throwing up the window . "
96545	96546	96549	96549	you	0	" "
96553	96554	96549	96549	you	0	" "
96633	96634	96617	96618	Miss Schlegel	245	" "
96645	96651	96640	96640	You	0	" Leonard could not understand . "
96782	96783	96784	96784	I	0	" "
96787	96788	96784	96784	I	0	" "
96863	96864	96855	96855	He	491	" "
96875	96876	96870	96870	Death	491	" "
96885	96886	96883	96883	Death	491	" "
96893	96894	96883	96883	Death	491	" "
96898	97016	96883	96883	Death	491	" said Helen , more gravely than before . Leonard looked at her wondering , and had the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night . But he could not receive them , because his heart was still full of little things . As the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at Queen 's Hall , so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner harmonies now . Death , Life and Materialism were fine words , but would Mr. Wilcox take him on as a clerk ? Talk as one would , Mr. Wilcox was king of this world , the superman , with his own morality , whose head remained in the clouds . "
97022	97037	97038	97038	Death	491	" he said apologetically . While to Helen the paradox became clearer and clearer . "
97050	97140	97046	97046	Death	491	" Behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it . Men of the world may recoil from the charnel - house that they will one day enter , but Love knows better . Death is his foe , but his peer , and in their age - long struggle the thews of Love have been strengthened , and his vision cleared , until there is no one who can stand against him . "
97146	97319	97320	97322	My dearest boy	2738	" continued the girl , and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible . Her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard to the earth . Woven of bitter experience , it resisted her . Presently the waitress entered and gave her a letter from Margaret . Another note , addressed to Leonard , was inside . They read them , listening to the murmurings of the river . For many hours Margaret did nothing ; then she controlled herself , and wrote some letters . She was too bruised to speak to Henry ; she could pity him , and even determine to marry him , but as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech . On the surface the sense of his degradation was too strong . She could not command voice or look , and the gentle words that she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other person . "
97324	97328	97320	97322	My dearest boy	2738	" she began , "
97380	97385	97376	97376	I	0	" But she crossed out "
97389	97410	97386	97386	I	0	" ; it struck a false note . Henry could not bear to be understood . She also crossed out , "
97417	97438	97439	97439	I	0	" Henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation . She must not comment ; comment is unfeminine . "
97446	97684	97439	97439	I	0	" she thought . Then the sense of his degradation choked her . Was he worth all this bother ? To have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything , yes , it was , and she could not be his wife . She tried to translate his temptation into her own language , and her brain reeled . Men must be different , even to want to yield to such a temptation . Her belief in comradeship was stifled , and she saw life as from that glass saloon on the Great Western , which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh air . Are the sexes really races , each with its own code of morality , and their mutual love a mere device of Nature to keep things going ? Strip human intercourse of the proprieties , and is it reduced to this ? Her judgment told her no . She knew that out of Nature 's device we have built a magic that will win us immortality . Far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call ; far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farm - yard and the garbage that nourishes it . We are evolving , in ways that Science can not measure , to ends that Theology dares not contemplate . "
97691	98101	97685	97685	Men	597	" the gods will say , and , saying , will give us immortality . Margaret knew all this , but for the moment she could not feel it , and transformed the marriage of Evie and Mr. Cahill into a carnival of fools , and her own marriage — too miserable to think of that , she tore up the letter , and then wrote another : Dear Mr. Bast , I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you , as I promised , and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for you . Yours truly , M. J. Schlegel She enclosed this in a note to Helen , over which she took less trouble than she might have done ; but her head was aching , and she could not stop to pick her words : Dear Helen , Give him this . The Basts are no good . Henry found the woman drunk on the lawn . I am having a room got ready for you here , and will you please come round at once on getting this ? The Basts are not at all the type we should trouble about . I may go round to them myself in the morning , and do anything that is fair . M In writing this , Margaret felt that she was being practical . Something might be arranged for the Basts later on , but they must be silenced for the moment . She hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and Helen . She rang the bell for a servant , but no one answered it ; Mr. Wilcox and the Warringtons were gone to bed , and the kitchen was abandoned to Saturnalia . Consequently she went over to the George herself . She did not enter the hotel , for discussion would have been perilous , and , saying that the letter was important , she gave it to the waitress . As she recrossed the square she saw Helen and Mr. Bast looking out of the window of the coffee - room , and feared she was already too late . Her task was not yet over ; she ought to tell Henry what she had done . This came easily , for she saw him in the hall . The night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall , and the noise had disturbed him . "
98106	98121	98122	98122	I	0	" he called , quite the householder . Margaret walked in and past him . "
98129	98133	98122	98122	I	0	" she said . "
98148	98149	98150	98150	I	0	" "
98157	98161	98152	98152	someone	3777	" said Henry . "
98193	98194	98187	98188	the Basts	394	" "
98208	98209	98196	98196	you	0	" "
98212	98213	98196	98196	you	0	" "
98224	98225	98215	98215	she	4148	" "
98257	98273	98250	98250	someone	3777	" He tapped a little gong , which had been bought to summon the servants . "
98288	98303	98250	98250	someone	3777	" Henry opened a door , and down the corridor came shouts of laughter . "
98310	98767	98768	98768	Henry	349	" he said , and strode towards it . Margaret went upstairs , uncertain whether to be glad that they had met , or sorry . They had behaved as if nothing had happened , and her deepest instincts told her that this was wrong . For his own sake , some explanation was due . And yet — what could an explanation tell her ? A date , a place , a few details , which she could imagine all too clearly . Now that the first shock was over , she saw that there was every reason to premise a Mrs. Bast . Henry 's inner life had long laid open to her — his intellectual confusion , his obtuseness to personal influence , his strong but furtive passions . Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded ? Perhaps . Perhaps , if the dishonour had been done to her , but it was done long before her day . She struggled against the feeling . She told herself that Mrs. Wilcox 's wrong was her own . But she was not a bargain theorist . As she undressed , her anger , her regard for the dead , her desire for a scene , all grew weak . Henry must have it as he liked , for she loved him , and some day she would use her love to make him a better man . Pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis . Pity , if one may generalize , is at the bottom of woman . When men like us , it is for our better qualities , and however tender their liking , we dare not be unworthy of it , or they will quietly let us go . But unworthiness stimulates woman . It brings out her deeper nature , for good or for evil . Here was the core of the question . Henry must be forgiven , and made better by love ; nothing else mattered . Mrs. Wilcox , that unquiet yet kindly ghost , must be left to her own wrong . To her everything was in proportion now , and she , too , would pity the man who was blundering up and down their lives . Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his trespass ? An interesting question , but Margaret fell asleep , tethered by affection , and lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from Wales . She felt herself at one with her future home , colouring it and coloured by it , and awoke to see , for the second time , Oniton Castle conquering the morning mists . "
98771	98834	98768	98769	Henry dear	2581	" was her greeting . He had finished his breakfast , and was beginning the Times . His sister - in - law was packing . She knelt by him and took the paper from him , feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick . Then , putting her face where it had been , she looked up in his eyes . "
98861	98862	98863	98863	You	0	" "
98870	98875	98863	98863	You	0	" he said huskily . "
98918	98958	98905	98905	I	0	" Expelled from his old fortress , Mr. Wilcox was building a new one . He could no longer appear respectable to her , so he defended himself instead in a lurid past . It was not true repentance . "
98990	98991	98978	98978	I	0	" "
98995	98999	98978	98978	I	0	" he inquired . "
99015	99104	99105	99105	I	0	" He was annoyed with Miss Schlegel here . He would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow , or even to rage . Against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not altogether womanly . Her eyes gazed too straight ; they had read books that are suitable for men only . And though he had dreaded a scene , and though she had determined against one , there was a scene , all the same . It was somehow imperative . "
99111	99115	99105	99105	I	0	" he began . "
99155	99177	99178	99178	You	0	" She kissed his hand . He jerked it from her , and , rising to his feet , went on : "
99220	99221	99210	99210	you	0	" "
99228	99232	99205	99205	I	0	" said Margaret ; "
99244	99245	99257	99257	you	0	" "
99290	99291	99281	99281	you	0	" "
99296	99378	99281	99281	you	0	" He laughed bitterly . Margaret went to the side - board and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes . Being the last down , she turned out the spirit - lamp that kept them warm . She was tender , but grave . She knew that Henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between the male soul and the female , and she did not desire to hear him on this point . "
99383	99392	99380	99380	Helen	245	" she asked . He shook his head . "
99414	99415	99411	99412	Mrs. Bast	384	" "
99421	99434	99416	99417	Good God	281	" he exclaimed , suddenly natural . Then he caught himself up . "
99459	99460	99447	99447	you	2766	" "
99471	99472	99463	99463	she	245	" "
99478	99479	99463	99463	she	245	" "
99488	99489	99481	99481	you	2766	" "
99494	99495	99481	99481	you	2766	" "

99559	99567	99557	99557	you	2766	" said Margaret , and dismissed him . "
99573	99577	99557	99557	you	2766	" said Henry . "
99624	99645	99622	99622	Margaret	246	" He came and sat down near her , improvising emotion . She could not bear to listen to him . "

99765	99787	99729	99729	I	0	" Gravely she considered this claim . Had he ? Had he suffered tortures of remorse , or had it been , "
99799	99960	99961	99961	I	0	" ? The latter , if she read him rightly . A man who has been through hell does not boast of his virility . He is humble and hides it , if , indeed , it still exists . Only in legend does the sinner come forth penitent , but terrible , to conquer pure woman by his resistless power . Henry was anxious to be terrible , but had not got it in him . He was a good average Englishman , who had slipped . The really culpable point — his faithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox — never seemed to strike him . She longed to mention Mrs. Wilcox . And bit by bit the story was told her . It was a very simple story . Ten years ago was the time , a garrison town in Cyprus the place . Now and then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him , and she answered , "
99969	100216	99967	99967	Henry	349	" She chose her words carefully , and so saved him from panic . She played the girl , until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world . When the butler came to clear away , Henry was in a very different mood — asked the fellow what he was in such a hurry for , complained of the noise last night in the servants ' hall . Margaret looked intently at the butler . He , as a handsome young man , was faintly attractive to her as a woman — an attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible , yet the skies would have fallen if she had mentioned it to Henry . On her return from the George the building operations were complete , and the old Henry fronted her , competent , cynical , and kind . He had made a clean breast , had been forgiven , and the great thing now was to forget his failure , and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments . Jacky rejoined Howards End and Ducie Street , and the vermilion motor - car , and the Argentine Hard Dollars , and all the things and people for whom he had never had much use and had less now . Their memory hampered him . He could scarcely attend to Margaret who brought back disquieting news from the George . Helen and her clients had gone . "

100324	100410	100313	100313	Dear	629	" Margaret took his arm . The beautiful weather soothed her . But the wheels of Evie 's wedding were still at work , tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had drawn them in , and she could not be with him long . It had been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury , whence he would go north , and she back to London with the Warringtons . For a fraction of time she was happy . Then her brain recommenced . "

100529	100538	100461	100461	he	0	" Except for some practical reason — never . "

101587	101598	101584	101584	she	4364	" There has been a great deal of trouble there . "
101599	101605	101607	101607	Tibby	250	" Who 's for lunch ? "
101629	101636	101637	101637	he	250	" Why such an early start ? "
101640	101651	101621	101621	Helen	245	" Sunrise or something — when I could get away . "
101652	101659	101584	101584	she	4364	" So I surmise . Why ? "
101660	101713	101714	101715	The landlady	2831	" I do n't know what 's to be done , Tibby . I am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns Meg , and do not want to face her , and I am not going back to Wickham Place . I stopped here to tell you this . "
101771	101795	101765	101765	Helen	245	" Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone . I mean to go to Munich or else Bonn . "
101796	101804	101806	101807	her brother	3702	" Such a message is easily given , "
101809	101886	101887	101887	She	245	" As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture , you and she are to do exactly as you like . My own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold . What does one want with dusty economic , books , which have made the world no better , or with mother 's hideous chiffoniers ? I have also another commission for you . I want you to deliver a letter . "
101891	101908	101909	101909	She	245	" I have n't written it yet . Why should n't I post it , though ? "
101914	101934	101909	101909	She	245	" My head is rather wretched . I hope that none of your friends are likely to come in . "
101962	101966	101968	101968	Helen	245	" Not there , "
102069	102078	102079	102079	he	250	" Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in ? "
102082	102094	102079	102079	he	250	" or shall I take it from her at the door ? "
102095	102104	102105	102105	He	250	" Could I bathe my eyes , Tibby ? "
102188	102194	102195	102195	she	245	" Now for the explanation , "
102198	102258	102195	102195	she	245	" Why did n't I begin with it ? I have found out something about Mr. Wilcox . He has behaved very wrongly indeed , and ruined two people 's lives . It all came on me very suddenly last night ; I am very much upset , and I do not know what to do . Mrs. Bast — "
102259	102265	102266	102266	Helen	245	" Oh , those people ! "
102270	102278	102266	102266	Helen	245	" Shall I lock the door again ? "
102279	102413	102195	102195	she	245	" No , thanks , Tibbikins . You 're being very good to me . I want to tell you the story before I go abroad . You must do exactly what you like — treat it as part of the furniture . Meg can not have heard it yet , I think . But I can not face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself . I do n't even know whether she ought to be told . Knowing as she does that I dislike him , she will suspect me , and think that I want to ruin her match . I simply do n't know what to make of such a thing . I trust your judgment . What would you do ? "
102414	102423	102425	102425	Tibby	250	" I gather he has had a mistress , "
102434	102527	102528	102528	He	250	" And ruined two people 's lives . And goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing , and there always will be rich and poor . He met her when he was trying to get rich out in Cyprus — I do n't wish to make him worse than he is , and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him . But there it is . They met . He goes his way and she goes hers . What do you suppose is the end of such women ? "
102537	102597	102528	102528	He	250	" They end in two ways : Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them , and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy , or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late . She — I ca n't blame her . "
102604	102621	102622	102622	I	0	" she continued after a long pause , during which the landlady served them with coffee . "
102819	102828	102830	102830	Tibby	250	" It is certainly a very bad business , "
102840	102889	102890	102890	She	4364	" I was afraid that I saw it out of proportion . But you are right outside it , and you must know . In a day or two — or perhaps a week — take whatever steps you think fit . I leave it in your hands . "
102895	102907	102908	102908	she	4364	" The facts as they touch Meg are all before you , "
102984	102987	102993	102993	Margaret	246	" personal relations "
103064	103084	103048	103048	he	250	" You see , Helen — have a cigarette — I do n't see what I 'm to do . "
103085	103112	103014	103014	Oxford	88	" Then there 's nothing to be done . I dare say you are right . Let them marry . There remains the question of compensation . "
103113	103131	103048	103048	he	250	" Do you want me to adjudicate that too ? Had you not better consult an expert ? "
103132	103139	103141	103141	Helen	245	" This part is in confidence , "
103143	103227	103141	103141	Helen	245	" It has nothing to do with Meg , and do not mention it to her . The compensation — I do not see who is to pay it if I do n't , and I have already decided on the minimum sum . As soon as possible I am placing it to your account , and when I am in Germany you will pay it over for me . I shall never forget your kindness , Tibbikins , if you do this . "
103228	103234	103014	103014	Oxford	88	" What is the sum ? "
103235	103239	103048	103048	he	250	" Five thousand . "
103240	103245	103247	103247	Tibby	250	" Good God alive ! "
103253	103304	103247	103247	Tibby	250	" Now , what is the good of driblets ? To go through life having done one thing — to have raised one person from the abyss : not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets — making the grey more grey . No doubt people will think me extraordinary . "
103305	103316	103318	103318	he	250	" I do n't care a damn what people think ! "
103327	103336	103318	103318	he	250	" But it 's half what you have . "
103337	103342	103343	103343	She	2853	" Not nearly half . "
103353	103400	103343	103343	She	2853	" I have far too much , and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet . What I give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two . It is n't enough . "
103471	103481	103450	103450	he	250	" I did n't expect you to understand me . "
103482	103489	103559	103559	her	2855	" I ? I understand nobody . "
103490	103497	103450	103450	he	250	" But you 'll do it ? "
103498	103501	103450	103450	he	250	" Apparently . "
103502	103555	103556	103556	He	250	" I leave you two commissions , then . The first concerns Mr. Wilcox , and you are to use your discretion . The second concerns the money , and is to be mentioned to no one , and carried out literally . You will send a hundred pounds on account tomorrow . "
103683	103692	103674	103674	She	245	" Does that seem to you so odd ? "
103777	103788	103774	103774	she	246	" Did she seem worried at any rumour about Henry ? "
103792	103795	103774	103774	she	246	" Yes . "
103796	103803	103804	103804	she	246	" I knew it was that ! "
103807	103814	103804	103804	she	246	" I 'll write to her . "
104760	104792	104793	104793	Helen	245	" I do n't say there is no standard , for that would destroy morality ; only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood . "
105216	105225	105226	105226	he	249	" I did n't want to bother you , "
105229	105241	105226	105226	he	249	" Besides , I have only heard for certain this morning . "
105242	105249	105251	105251	Margaret	335	" Where are we to live ? "
105257	105276	105251	105251	Margaret	335	" I loved the place extraordinarily . Do n't you believe in having a permanent home , Henry ? "
105306	105322	105297	105297	he	249	" This is news . I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp . "
105323	105326	105329	105329	his	249	" My dear girl!"—he
105330	105446	105297	105297	he	249	hand—"have you eyes ? have you a skin ? How could it be anything but damp in such a situation ? In the first place , the Grange is on clay , and built where the castle moat must have been ; then there 's that destestable little river , steaming all night like a kettle . Feel the cellar walls ; look up under the eaves . Ask Sir James or anyone . Those Shropshire valleys are notorious . The only possible place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill ; but , for my part , I think the country is too far from London , and the scenery nothing special . "
105453	105462	105447	105447	Margaret	335	" Why did you go there , then ? "
105463	105468	105469	105469	He	249	" I — because — "
105479	105503	105471	105471	his	249	" Why have we come to the Tyrol , if it comes to that ? One might go on asking such questions indefinitely . "
105533	105554	105523	105523	he	249	" The truth is , I took Oniton on account of Evie . Do n't let this go any further . "
105555	105559	105297	105297	he	249	" Certainly not . "
105560	105663	105523	105523	he	249	" I should n't like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain . No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged . Poor little girl ! She was so keen on it all , and would n't even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting . Afraid it would get snapped up — just like all of your sex . Well , no harm 's done . She has had her country wedding , and I 've got rid of my house to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school . "
105664	105680	105523	105523	he	249	" Where shall we live , then , Henry ? I should enjoy living somewhere . "
105681	105692	105693	105693	Margaret	335	" I have not yet decided . What about Norfolk ? "
105792	105798	105800	105800	Henry	349	" It is now what ? "
105802	105825	105800	105800	Henry	349	" Nearly October . Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street , and look out for something in the spring . "
105850	105851	105832	105832	I	0	" "
105867	105868	105869	105869	I	0	" "

105973	105974	105966	105966	Theo	508	" "
105977	106172	105966	105966	Theo	508	" So Ducie Street was her first fate — a pleasant enough fate . The house , being only a little larger than Wickham Place , trained her for the immense establishment that was promised in the spring . They were frequently away , but at home life ran fairly regularly . In the morning Henry went to the business , and his sandwich — a relic this of some prehistoric craving — was always cut by her own hand . He did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch , but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven . When he had gone , there was the house to look after , and the servants to humanize , and several kettles of Helen 's to keep on the boil . Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts ; she was not sorry to have lost sight of them . No doubt Leonard was worth helping , but being Henry 's wife , she preferred to help someone else . As for theatres and discussion societies , they attracted her less and less . She began to "
106174	106314	106341	106341	he	2936	" new movements , and to spend her spare time re - reading or thinking , rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends . They attributed the change to her marriage , and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable . Yet the main cause lay deeper still ; she had outgrown stimulants , and was passing from words to things . It was doubtless a pity not to keep up with Wedekind or John , but some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty , if the mind itself is to become a creative power . She was looking at plans one day in the following spring — they had finally decided to go down into Sussex and build — when Mrs. Charles Wilcox was announced . "
106321	106333	106334	106334	Charles	510	" Dolly cried , as soon as she entered the room . "
106358	106359	106341	106341	he	2936	" "
106364	106372	106362	106362	Dolly	336	" said Margaret , placidly kissing her . "
106386	106459	106462	106462	you	2935	" Boys and the baby were well , and in describing a great row that there had been at Hilton Tennis Club , Dolly forgot her news . The wrong people had tried to get in . The rector , as representing the older inhabitants , had said — Charles had said — the tax - collector had said — Charles had regretted not saying — and she closed the description with , "
106473	106474	106462	106462	you	2935	" "

106676	106695	106666	106666	she	245	" said Margaret , trying to conceal her vexation . She was getting rather sore on this point . "
106710	106718	106702	106702	She	245	" But has n't she any address ? "
106719	106744	106666	106666	she	245	" A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address . Do write her a line . I will look it up for you . "
106745	106763	106702	106702	She	245	" No , do n't bother . That 's eight months she has been away , surely ? "
106764	106781	106702	106702	She	245	" Exactly . She left just after Evie 's wedding . It would be eight months . "
106782	106791	106666	106666	she	245	" Just when baby was born , then ? "
106792	106796	106702	106702	She	245	" Just so . "
106922	106926	106927	106927	she	336	" Oh yes , "
106930	106945	106927	106927	she	336	" that is it : Miss Avery has been unpacking your packing - cases . "
106946	106956	106909	106909	She	336	" Why has she done that ? How unnecessary ! "
106957	106968	106909	106909	She	336	" Ask another . I suppose you ordered her to . "
106969	106992	106909	106909	She	336	" I gave no such orders . Perhaps she was airing the things . She did undertake to light an occasional fire . "
106993	107002	107004	107004	Dolly	336	" It was far more than an air , "
107007	107035	107004	107004	Dolly	336	" The floor sounds covered with books . Charles sent me to know what is to be done , for he feels certain you do n't know . "
107036	107039	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" Books ! "
107049	107063	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" Dolly , are you serious ? Has she been touching our books ? "
107064	107091	106909	106909	She	336	" Has n't she , though ! What used to be the hall 's full of them . Charles thought for certain you knew of it . "
107092	107145	106909	106909	She	336	" I am very much obliged to you , Dolly . What can have come over Miss Avery ? I must go down about it at once . Some of the books are my brother 's , and are quite valuable . She had no right to open any of the cases . "
107146	107207	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" I say she 's dotty . She was the one that never got married , you know . Oh , I say , perhaps she thinks your books are wedding - presents to herself . Old maids are taken that way sometimes . Miss Avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust - up with Evie . "
107208	107216	107218	107218	Margaret	335	" I had n't heard of that , "
107228	107264	107223	107223	Dolly	336	" Did n't you know she gave Evie a present last August , and Evie returned it , and then — oh , goloshes ! You never read such a letter as Miss Avery wrote . "
107265	107288	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" But it was wrong of Evie to return it . It was n't like her to do such a heartless thing . "
107289	107297	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" But the present was so expensive . "
107298	107308	107223	107223	Dolly	336	" Why does that make any difference , Dolly ? "
107309	107358	107041	107041	Margaret	335	" Still , when it costs over five pounds — I did n't see it , but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop . You ca n't very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman . Now , can you ? "
107359	107372	107223	107223	Dolly	336	" You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married . "
107470	107471	107466	107467	Miss Avery	451	" "
107477	107484	107473	107474	Miss Avery	451	" Dolly 's eyes grew round . "
107521	107528	107505	107505	she	451	" Did she give any reasons ? "
107529	107546	107466	107467	Miss Avery	451	" We think she meant to be invited to Oniton , and so climb into society . "
107547	107555	107557	107557	Margaret	335	" She 's rather old for that , "
107560	107576	107557	107557	Margaret	335	" May not she have given the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother ? "
107577	107628	107466	107467	Miss Avery	451	" That 's a notion . Give every one their due , eh ? Well , I suppose I ought to be toddling . Come along , Mr. Muff — you want a new coat , but I do n't know who 'll give it you , I 'm sure ; "
107657	107661	107643	107643	Margaret	335	" Oh yes . "
107662	107680	107695	107695	her	336	" I wonder , then , why he let me ask her to look after the house . "
107681	107690	107692	107692	Dolly	336	" But she 's only a farm woman , "
107730	107742	107743	107743	he	349	" I have patience with a man who knows his job , "
108405	108410	108412	108412	Margaret	335	" Left to itself , "
108416	108423	108412	108412	Margaret	335	" this county would vote Liberal . "
108474	108520	108466	108470	A most finished young person	3000	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox ; no , Mrs. Wilcox ; oh yes , Mrs. Wilcox , auntie received your letter quite duly . Auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment . Shall I send the servant to direct you ? "
108524	108622	108466	108470	A most finished young person	3000	" Of course , auntie does not generally look after your place ; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional . It gives her something to do . She spends quite a lot of her time there . My husband says to me sometimes , ' Where 's auntie ? ' I say , ' Need you ask ? She 's at Howards End . ' Yes , Mrs. Wilcox . Mrs. Wilcox , could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake ? Not if I cut it for you ? "
108643	108679	108638	108639	Miss Avery	451	" I can not let you go on alone . Now do n't . You really must n't . I will direct you myself if it comes to that . I must get my hat . Now"—roguishly—"Mrs
108692	109038	108681	108681	Wilcox	335	" Stunned , Margaret did not move from the best parlour , over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen . But the other rooms looked in keeping , though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior . Here had lived an elder race , to which we look back with disquietude . The country which we visit at week - ends was really a home to it , and the graver sides of life , the deaths , the partings , the yearnings for love , have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields . All was not sadness . The sun was shining without . The thrush sang his two syllables on the budding guelder - rose . Some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden straw . It was the presence of sadness at all that surprised Margaret , and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness . In these English farms , if anywhere , one might see life steadily and see it whole , group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth , connect — connect without bitterness until all men are brothers . But her thoughts were interrupted by the return of Miss Avery 's niece , and were so tranquillizing that she suffered the interruption gladly . It was quicker to go out by the back door , and , after due explanations , they went out by it . The niece was now mortified by unnumerable chickens , who rushed up to her feet for food , and by a shameless and maternal sow . She did not know what animals were coming to . But her gentility withered at the touch of the sweet air . The wind was rising , scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over Evie 's pendant . One of those delicious gales of spring , in which leaves stiff in bud seem to rustle , swept over the land and then fell silent . "
109041	109046	108681	108681	Wilcox	335	" sang the thrush . "
109049	109060	109063	109064	pretty Georgia	230	" came furtively from the cliff of pine - trees . "
109066	109214	109215	109215	Auntie	5541	" and the other birds joined in with nonsense . The hedge was a half - painted picture which would be finished in a few days . Celandines grew on its banks , lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows ; the wild rose - bushes , still bearing their withered hips , showed also the promise of blossom . Spring had come , clad in no classical garb , yet fairer than all springs ; fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of Tuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind . The two women walked up the lane full of outward civility . But Margaret was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such a day , and the niece was thinking about hats . Thus engaged , they reached Howards End . Petulant cries of "
109217	109234	109215	109215	Auntie	5541	" severed the air . There was no reply , and the front door was locked . "
109245	109249	109236	109236	you	3003	" asked Margaret . "
109264	109400	109259	109259	She	451	" Margaret tried to look in through the dining - room window , but the curtain inside was drawn tightly . So with the drawing - room and the hall . The appearance of these curtains was familiar , yet she did not remember them being there on her other visit : her impression was that Mr. Bryce had taken everything away . They tried the back . Here again they received no answer , and could see nothing ; the kitchen - window was fitted with a blind , while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them , which looked ominously like the lids of packing - cases . Margaret thought of her books , and she lifted up her voice also . At the first cry she succeeded . "
109405	109412	109259	109259	She	451	" replied someone inside the house . "
109423	109424	109417	109418	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
109433	109434	109435	109435	Madge	246	" "
109440	109448	109449	109449	Auntie	250	" said Miss Avery , still invisible . "
109456	109461	109453	109454	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Margaret supported her . "
109470	109471	109472	109472	Madge	246	" "
109485	109492	109493	109493	Auntie	250	" The poor woman went red . "
109499	109504	109505	109506	Miss Avery	451	" she said nervously . "
109508	109512	109505	109506	Miss Avery	451	" called Margaret . "
109527	109528	109521	109521	you	451	" "
109534	109539	109531	109532	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" said the voice , "
109543	109563	109531	109532	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" But after that came silence . They called again without response . They walked round the house disconsolately . "
109572	109576	109564	109564	I	0	" hazarded Margaret . "
109585	109589	109580	109580	you	0	" said Madge , "
109615	109647	109608	109608	Auntie	250	" Gathering up her elegancies , she retired defeated , and , as if her departure had loosed a spring , the front door opened at once . Miss Avery said , "
109657	109663	109654	109655	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" quite pleasantly and calmly . "
109669	109690	109665	109665	you	0	" began Margaret , but broke off at the sight of an umbrella - stand . It was her own . "
109698	109799	109800	109800	I	0	" said Miss Avery . She drew the curtain , and Margaret uttered a cry of despair . For an appalling thing had happened . The hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from Wickham Place . The carpet had been laid , the big work - table drawn up near the window ; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace , and her father 's sword — this is what bewildered her particularly — had been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes . Miss Avery must have worked for days . "
109810	109814	109815	109816	Mr. Wilcox	249	" she began . "
109870	109871	109864	109864	you	3013	" "
109880	109891	109864	109864	you	3013	" said the old woman . Margaret refused to argue . "
109900	109905	109895	109895	we	3010	" she said civilly . "
109918	109919	109920	109921	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
109952	109963	109941	109941	she	510	" To help the poor decaying brain , Margaret said : "
109977	109978	109966	109967	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
109983	109988	109966	109967	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" said Miss Avery . "
109993	109994	109966	109967	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
110002	110015	109997	109997	I	0	" said Margaret , sitting down in one of her own chairs . "
110027	110038	110016	110016	I	0	" She could not help laughing . The other said : "
110049	110050	110016	110016	I	0	" "
110079	110080	109997	109997	I	0	" "
110087	110115	109997	109997	I	0	" She went through the door opposite and drew a curtain . Light flooded the drawing - room and the drawing - room furniture from Wickham Place . "
110122	110137	109997	109997	I	0	" More curtains were drawn , more windows were flung open to the spring . "
110142	110168	110169	110169	I	0	" Miss Avery continued passing and repassing through the hall . Her voice was lost , but Margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind . "
110176	110182	110169	110169	I	0	" she announced , returning . "
110213	110214	110191	110193	The farm lads	3022	" "
110221	110234	110191	110193	The farm lads	3022	" repeated Margaret , feeling that she must put her foot down . "
110251	110252	110241	110241	I	0	" "
110264	110265	110241	110241	I	0	" "
110294	110339	110340	110340	You	0	" She looked at Miss Avery intently , trying to understand the kink in her brain . Here was no maundering old woman . Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous . She looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious nobility . "
110359	110360	110352	110353	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
110367	110373	110352	110353	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" said Margaret , smiling . "
110415	110420	110408	110408	one	559	" Miss Avery retorted : "
110441	110442	110444	110444	I	0	" "
110446	110447	110444	110444	I	0	" "
110467	110564	110463	110463	you	0	" It was a senseless remark , but with a queer feeling of disloyalty Margaret rose from her chair . She felt that Henry had been obscurely censured . They went into the dining - room , where the sunlight poured in upon her mother 's chiffonier , and upstairs , where many an old god peeped from a new niche . The furniture fitted extraordinarily well . In the central room — over the hall , the room that Helen had slept in four years ago — Miss Avery had placed Tibby 's old bassinette . "
110568	110699	110463	110463	you	0	" she said . Margaret turned away without speaking . At last everything was seen . The kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw , but , as far as she could make out , nothing had been broken or scratched . A pathetic display of ingenuity ! Then they took a friendly stroll in the garden . It had gone wild since her last visit . The gravel sweep was weedy , and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage . And Evie 's rockery was only bumps . Perhaps Evie was responsible for Miss Avery 's oddness . But Margaret suspected that the cause lay deeper , and that the girl 's silly letter had but loosed the irritation of years . "
110706	110770	110463	110463	you	0	" she remarked . It was one of those open - air drawing - rooms that have been formed , hundreds of years ago , out of the smaller fields . So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles , and at the bottom there was a little green annex — a sort of powder - closet for the cows . "
110779	110784	110773	110774	the maidy	3034	" said Miss Avery , "
110797	110803	110804	110804	I	0	" And she cackled maliciously . "
110884	110885	110873	110873	I	0	" "
110893	110897	110873	110873	I	0	" said Margaret . "
110935	110939	110940	110940	They	3035	" Margaret laughed . "
110957	110958	110959	110959	They	3035	" "
110969	110978	110959	110959	They	3035	" But Miss Avery upset her by replying : "
111027	111028	111012	111013	Mrs. Charlie	510	" "
111036	111062	111032	111032	they	3035	" said Margaret , conscious of some invitation to disloyalty , which was echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds . "
111098	111099	111084	111084	I	0	" "
111105	111158	111084	111084	I	0	" said Miss Avery , and turned to the wych - elm . On their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more clearly than before . In the house Margaret had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife from the second . Now she said : "
111231	111232	111221	111222	Mrs. Howard	517	" "
111241	111249	111221	111222	Mrs. Howard	517	" Margaret asked . Miss Avery replied : "
111259	111260	111221	111222	Mrs. Howard	517	" "
111267	111280	111262	111263	Mr. Wilcox	249	" corrected Margaret , anxious that her husband should receive his dues . "
111321	111322	111304	111304	you	0	" "
111329	111330	111331	111332	A soldier	3060	" "
111334	111340	111341	111343	Some real soldier	3061	" exclaimed the old woman . "
111345	111371	111341	111343	Some real soldier	3061	" Margaret was silent . It was a criticism of Henry 's character far more trenchant than any of her own . She felt dissatisfied . "
111378	111383	111341	111343	Some real soldier	3061	" she went on . "
111424	111425	111419	111419	you	0	" "
111431	111446	111419	111419	you	0	" said Margaret firmly . She respected Miss Avery too much to humour her . "
111492	111493	111496	111497	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
111499	111657	111496	111497	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" said Miss Avery , and resigned her duties with a smile . Relieved at this conclusion , and having sent her compliments to Madge , Margaret walked back to the station . She had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal , but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected , so she decided to consult Henry . It was as well that she did this . He was strongly against employing the local man whom he had previously recommended , and advised her to store in London after all . But before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her . It was not unexpected entirely . Aunt Juley 's health had been bad all the winter . She had had a long series of colds and coughs , and had been too busy to get rid of them . She had scarcely promised her niece "
111667	111992	111496	111497	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia . Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage . Helen was telegraphed for , and that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories . On a perfect day , when the sky seemed blue porcelain , and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand , Margaret hurried up through the rhododendrons , confronted again by the senselessness of Death . One death may explain itself , but it throws no light upon another : the groping inquiry must begin anew . Preachers or scientists may generalize , but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love ; not one heaven awaits them , not even one oblivion . Aunt Juley , incapable of tragedy , slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so long . She was very weak ; she could not rise to the occasion , or realize the great mystery which all agree must await her ; it only seemed to her that she was quite done up — more done up than ever before ; that she saw and heard and felt less every moment ; and that , unless something changed , she would soon feel nothing . Her spare strength she devoted to plans : could not Margaret take some steamer expeditions ? were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them ? She worried herself about Helen 's absence , and also that she could be the cause of Helen 's return . The nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural , and perhaps hers was an average approach to the Great Gate . But Margaret saw Death stripped of any false romance ; whatever the idea of Death may contain , the process can be trivial and hideous . "
112005	112006	111995	111995	Margaret	246	" "
112045	112046	112032	112032	She	245	" "
112056	112057	112053	112054	Mr. Wilcox	249	" "
112062	112063	112065	112065	he	249	" "
112069	112136	112065	112065	he	249	" Henry wished her to come , and had been very kind . Yet again Margaret said so . Mrs. Munt did not die . Quite outside her will , a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope . She returned , without emotion , as fidgety as ever . On the fourth day she was out of danger . "
112141	112146	112137	112137	Margaret	246	" it went on : "
112165	112166	112162	112163	Miss Conder	294	" "
112177	112178	112174	112175	Miss Conder	294	" "
112192	112193	112190	112190	Helen	245	" "
112201	112202	112198	112199	Aunt Juley	255	" "
112227	112228	112229	112229	Helen	245	" "
112235	112239	112229	112229	Helen	245	" agreed Margaret . "
112257	112258	112248	112248	she	245	" "
112278	112671	112271	112271	She	245	" That was the stock criticism about Helen , but Margaret 's voice trembled as she made it . By now she was deeply pained at her sister 's behaviour . It may be unbalanced to fly out of England , but to stop away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head . A sick - bed could recall Helen , but she was deaf to more human calls ; after a glimpse at her aunt , she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante . She scarcely existed ; her letters had become dull and infrequent ; she had no wants and no curiosity . And it was all put down to poor Henry 's account ! Henry , long pardoned by his wife , was still too infamous to be greeted by his sister - in - law . It was morbid , and , to her alarm , Margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in Helen 's life for nearly four years . The flight from Oniton ; the unbalanced patronage of the Basts ; the explosion of grief up on the Downs — all connected with Paul , an insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time . Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox had feared that they might kiss again . Foolishly : the real danger was reaction . Reaction against the Wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane . At twenty - five she had an idée fixe . What hope was there for her as an old woman ? The more Margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became . For many months she had put the subject away , but it was too big to be slighted now . There was almost a taint of madness . Were all Helen 's actions to be governed by a tiny mishap , such as may happen to any young man or woman ? Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant ? The blundering little encounter at Howards End was vital . It propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren ; it was stronger than sisterly intimacy , stronger than reason or books . In one of her moods Helen had confessed that she still "
112673	113131	112271	112271	She	245	" it in a certain sense . Paul had faded , but the magic of his caress endured . And where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction — propagation at both ends . Well , it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed - beds , and we without power to choose the seed . But man is an odd , sad creature as yet , intent on pilfering the earth , and heedless of the growths within himself . He can not be bored about psychology . He leaves it to the specialist , which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam - engine . He can not be bothered to digest his own soul . Margaret and Helen have been more patient , and it is suggested that Margaret has succeeded — so far as success is yet possible . She does understand herself , she has some rudimentary control over her own growth . Whether Helen has succeeded one can not say . The day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen 's letter arrived . She had posted it at Munich , and would be in London herself on the morrow . It was a disquieting letter , though the opening was affectionate and sane . Dearest Meg , Give Helen 's love to Aunt Juley . Tell her that I love , and have loved , her ever since I can remember . I shall be in London Thursday . My address will be care of the bankers . I have not yet settled on a hotel , so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news . If Aunt Juley is much better , or if , for a terrible reason , it would be no good my coming down to Swanage , you must not think it odd if I do not come . I have all sorts of plans in my head . I am living abroad at present , and want to get back as quickly as possible . Will you please tell me where our furniture is . I should like to take out one or two books ; the rest are for you . Forgive me , dearest Meg . This must read like rather a tiresome letter , but all letters are from your loving Helen It was a tiresome letter , for it tempted Margaret to tell a lie . If she wrote that Aunt Juley was still in danger her sister would come . Unhealthiness is contagious . We can not be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating . To "
113136	113331	112271	112271	She	245	" might do Helen good , but would do herself harm , and , at the risk of disaster , she kept her colours flying a little longer . She replied that their aunt was much better , and awaited developments . Tibby approved of her reply . Mellowing rapidly , he was a pleasanter companion than before . Oxford had done much for him . He had lost his peevishness , and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food . But he had not grown more human . The years between eighteen and twenty - two , so magical for most , were leading him gently from boyhood to middle age . He had never known young - manliness , that quality which warms the heart till death , and gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm . He was frigid , through no fault of his own , and without cruelty . He thought Helen wrong and Margaret right , but the family trouble was for him what a scene behind footlights is for most people . He had only one suggestion to make , and that was characteristic . "
113340	113341	113335	113335	you	3067	" "
113345	113346	113343	113343	Helen	245	" "
113357	113358	113348	113348	he	249	" "
113368	113369	113359	113359	He	249	" "
113381	113427	113377	113377	he	249	" It was the student 's belief in experts . Margaret demurred for one or two reasons . Presently Helen 's answer came . She sent a telegram requesting the address of the furniture , as she would now return at once . Margaret replied , "
113439	113492	113493	113493	Tibby	250	" She and Tibby went up to London . Helen was not at the bankers , and they were refused her address . Helen had passed into chaos . Margaret put her arm round her brother . He was all that she had left , and never had he seemed more unsubstantial . "
113499	113503	113493	113493	Tibby	250	" He replied : "
113508	113509	113493	113493	Tibby	250	" "
113530	113531	113521	113521	you	629	" "
113540	113541	113521	113521	you	629	" "
113546	113550	113521	113521	you	629	" said Margaret . "
113554	113920	113923	113923	Helen	245	" But the suggestion had been uttered , and in a few minutes she took it up herself . Nothing else explained . And London agreed with Tibby . The mask fell off the city , and she saw it for what it really is — a caricature of infinity . The familiar barriers , the streets along which she moved , the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years , became negligible suddenly . Helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly - flowing slabs of mud . She had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the One . Margaret 's own faith held firm . She knew the human soul will be merged , if it be merged at all , with the stars and the sea . Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years . It was symbolic the catastrophe should come now , on a London afternoon , while rain fell slowly . Henry was the only hope . Henry was definite . He might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them , and she determined to take Tibby 's advice and lay the whole matter in his hands . They must call at his office . He could not well make it worse . She went for a few moments into St. Paul 's , whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely , as if preaching the gospel of form . But within , St. Paul 's is as its surroundings — echoes and whispers , inaudible songs , invisible mosaics , wet footmarks crossing and recrossing the floor . Si monumentum requiris , circumspice : it points us back to London . There was no hope of Helen here . Henry was unsatisfactory at first . That she had expected . He was overjoyed to see her back from Swanage , and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble . When they told him of their search , he only chaffed Tibby and the Schlegels generally , and declared that it was "
113924	113932	113952	113952	Helen	245	" to lead her relatives a dance . "
113940	113944	113952	113952	Helen	245	" replied Margaret . "
113969	113970	113952	113952	Helen	245	" "

114093	114108	114085	114085	you	3072	" said Tibby . Mr. Wilcox , who was in good spirits , retorted , "
114117	114156	114157	114157	Margaret	246	" He leant back , laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family , while the fire flickered over the map of Africa . Margaret motioned to her brother to go on . Rather diffident , he obeyed her . "
114163	114167	114157	114157	Margaret	246	" he said . "
114174	114188	114168	114169	Our sister	3077	" Charles , who was working in the inner room , looked round . "
114194	114199	114192	114192	Charles	249	" said Margaret kindly . "

114316	114317	114318	114318	She	3077	" "
114328	114332	114318	114318	She	3077	" asked Henry . "
114337	114346	114318	114318	She	3077	" said his wife , with a frown . "
114358	114368	114318	114318	She	3077	" A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her . "
114380	114384	114369	114369	You	249	" she said . "
114396	114397	114392	114392	her	245	" "

114428	114451	114422	114422	I	0	" She recovered herself , but not before Charles had observed her . Stupid and attentive , he was watching the scene . "
114564	114680	114681	114681	You	3085	" Henry began to grow serious . Ill - health was to him something perfectly definite . Generally well himself , he could not realize that we sink to it by slow gradations . The sick had no rights ; they were outside the pale ; one could lie to them remorselessly . When his first wife was seized , he had promised to take her down into Hertfordshire , but meanwhile arranged with a nursing - home instead . Helen , too , was ill . And the plan that he sketched out for her capture , clever and well - meaning as it was , drew its ethics from the wolf - pack . "
114689	114693	114681	114681	You	3085	" he said . "

114733	114779	114708	114709	a doctor	3087	" He rose to his feet and thought intently . The genial , tentative host disappeared , and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of Greece and Africa , and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin . "
114785	114791	114780	114780	I	0	" he said at last . "

114984	114992	114931	114932	a specialist	3091	" She looked at her husband sadly . "

115209	115213	115207	115207	Margaret	246	" he groaned . "
115242	115243	115233	115233	you	623	" "

115284	115288	115271	115271	Pater	520	" he said . "
115293	115317	115291	115291	Charles	249	" Charles could give no reason ; but Margaret felt as if , over tremendous distance , a salutation had passed between them . "
115327	115332	115291	115291	Charles	249	" he said crossly . "
115341	115342	115333	115333	We	3098	" "
115349	115354	115355	115355	My	0	" asked his father . "

115388	115561	115381	115381	I	0	" By now Margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her husband . Retreat was impossible . He was determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion , and Helen faded as he talked . Her fair , flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing , for she was ill , without rights , and any of her friends might hunt her . Sick at heart , Margaret joined in the chase . She wrote her sister a lying letter , at her husband 's dictation ; she said the furniture was all at Howards End , but could be seen on Monday next at 3 p.m. , when a charwoman would be in attendance . It was a cold letter , and the more plausible for that . Helen would think she was offended . And on Monday next she and Henry were to lunch with Dolly , and then ambush themselves in the garden . After they had gone , Mr. Wilcox said to his son : "
115589	115595	115587	115587	her	246	" Charles made no answer . "
115607	115608	115587	115587	her	246	" "
115626	115627	115623	115623	you	0	" "

115637	115941	115942	115942	She	3103	" One speaks of the moods of spring , but the days that are her true children have only one mood ; they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds , and the whistling of birds . New flowers may come out , the green embroidery of the hedges increase , but the same heaven broods overhead , soft , thick , and blue , the same figures , seen and unseen , are wandering by coppice and meadow . The morning that Margaret had spent with Miss Avery , and the afternoon she set out to entrap Helen , were the scales of a single balance . Time might never have moved , rain never have fallen , and man alone , with his schemes and ailments , was troubling Nature until he saw her through a veil of tears . She protested no more . Whether Henry was right or wrong , he was most kind , and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him . She must trust him absolutely . As soon as he had taken up a business , his obtuseness vanished . He profited by the slightest indications , and the capture of Helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of Evie . They went down in the morning as arranged , and he discovered that their victim was actually in Hilton . On his arrival he called at all the livery - stables in the village , and had a few minutes ' serious conversation with the proprietors . What he said , Margaret did not know — perhaps not the truth ; but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the London train , and had taken a fly to Howards End . "
115948	115952	115942	115942	She	3103	" said Henry . "
115959	115967	115969	115969	Margaret	246	" I can not make it out , "
115975	115987	115969	115969	Margaret	246	" Finish your coffee , dear . We must be off . "
115988	116000	116002	116002	Dolly	336	" Yes , Margaret , you know you must take plenty , "
116043	116051	116052	116052	he	4362	" You 're not fit for it , "
116056	116069	116052	116052	he	4362	" Let me go alone . I know exactly what to do . "
116070	116078	116080	116080	Margaret	246	" Oh yes , I am fit , "
116086	116154	116155	116155	She	246	" Only most frightfully worried . I can not feel that Helen is really alive . Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from someone else . Her voice is n't in them . I do n't believe your driver really saw her at the station . I wish I 'd never mentioned it . I know that Charles is vexed . Yes , he is — "
116164	116180	116155	116155	She	246	" There , Dolly will forgive me . There . Now we 'll be off . "
116196	116205	116206	116206	he	349	" Do n't you want to tidy yourself ? "
116209	116214	116206	116206	he	349	" Have I time ? "
116215	116220	116221	116221	She	246	" Yes , plenty . "
116244	116253	116239	116240	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Dolly , I 'm going without her . "
116275	116283	116263	116263	She	246	" Tell her I thought it best . "
116284	116293	116263	116263	She	246	" Yes , Mr. Wilcox , I see . "
116294	116303	116263	116263	She	246	" Say anything you like . All right . "
116421	116434	116418	116418	She	246	" I deserve it : I am punished for lowering my colours . "
116447	116458	116459	116459	he	249	" I still consider you are not fit for it , "
116463	116482	116459	116459	he	249	" Perhaps I was not at lunch . But the whole thing is spread clearly before me now . "
116483	116493	116418	116418	She	246	" I was meaning to act for the best . "
116494	116512	116418	116418	She	246	" Just lend me your scarf , will you ? This wind takes one 's hair so . "
116513	116525	116459	116459	he	249	" Certainly , dear girl . Are you all right now ? "
116526	116535	116418	116418	She	246	" Look ! My hands have stopped trembling . "
116536	116599	116418	116418	She	246	" And have quite forgiven me ? Then listen . Her cab should already have arrived at Howards End . ( We 're a little late , but no matter . ) Our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm , as , if possible , one does n't want a scene before servants . A certain gentleman"—he
116604	116632	116418	116418	She	246	back—"won't drive in , but will wait a little short of the front gate , behind the laurels . Have you still the keys of the house ? "
116633	116636	116418	116418	She	246	" Yes . "
116637	116653	116418	116418	She	246	" Well , they are n't wanted . Do you remember how the house stands ? "
116654	116657	116418	116418	She	246	" Yes . "
116658	116680	116418	116418	She	246	" If we do n't find her in the porch , we can stroll round into the garden . Our object — "
116690	116748	116749	116750	The doctor	3703	" I was just saying to my wife , Mansbridge , that our main object is not to frighten Miss Schlegel . The house , as you know , is my property , so it should seem quite natural for us to be there . The trouble is evidently nervous — wouldn't you say so , Margaret ? "
116788	116791	116793	116793	Margaret	246	" Nothing , "
116805	116815	116801	116801	she	246	" Though she did resent my husband 's immorality . "
116816	116823	116825	116825	Henry	349	" She always was highly strung , "
116839	116869	116825	116825	Henry	349	" A tendency to spiritualism and those things , though nothing serious . Musical , literary , artistic , but I should say normal — a very charming girl . "
116928	116933	116922	116922	Schlegels	261	" Were they normal ? "
117208	117215	117217	117217	Henry	349	" Is the truant all right ? "
117225	117231	117219	117219	She	246	" Oh , my darling — "
117252	117258	117259	117259	she	246	" Yes , all right , "
117271	117278	117280	117280	Henry	349	" Margaret , you look upset ! "

117393	117397	117385	117385	She	246	" Go away . "
117405	117428	117402	117402	He	349	" Margaret , you look upset again . My dear , give me the keys . What are you doing with Helen ? "
117429	117445	117385	117385	She	246	" Oh , dearest , do go away , and I will manage it all . "
117446	117450	117451	117451	He	349	" Manage what ? "
117473	117479	117480	117480	she	246	" Stop that at least , "
117537	117546	117548	117549	her husband	4099	" Come , this is an odd beginning , "
117580	117587	117589	117589	Margaret	246	" I can not help it , "
117591	117611	117589	117589	Margaret	246	" Do wait . It 's not my fault . Please all four of you to go away now . "

117639	117652	117635	117637	the young doctor	3153	" Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out ? "
117653	117658	117660	117660	Margaret	246	" On what grounds ? "
117684	117722	117676	117676	he	249	" I beg your pardon , but it is nothing of the sort . You are not qualified to attend my sister , Mr. Mansbridge . If we require your services , we will let you know . "
117723	117735	117736	117736	he	249	" I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish , "
117739	117760	117736	117736	he	249	" You could , but you have not . You are , therefore , not qualified to attend my sister . "
117761	117768	117770	117770	Henry	349	" Come , come , Margaret ! "
117777	117798	117770	117770	Henry	349	" This is a terrible business , an appalling business . It 's doctor 's orders . Open the door . "
117799	117808	117736	117736	he	249	" Forgive me , but I will not . "
117809	117815	117816	117816	Margaret	246	" I do n't agree . "
117820	117831	117833	117834	the doctor	3703	" This business is as broad as it 's long , "
117836	117856	117833	117834	the doctor	3703	" We had better all work together . You need us , Mrs. Wilcox , and we need you . "
117857	117861	117863	117863	Henry	349	" Quite so , "
117865	117875	117877	117877	Margaret	246	" I do not need you in the least , "
117888	117904	117879	117881	The two men	1385	" No more does my sister , who is still many weeks from her confinement . "
117905	117910	117950	117951	the doctor	3703	" Margaret , Margaret ! "
117911	117928	117929	117930	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Well , Henry , send your doctor away . What possible use is he now ? "
117965	117973	117975	117975	Margaret	246	" It all turns on affection now , "
117977	117985	117975	117975	Margaret	246	" Affection . Do n't you see ? "
118002	118054	117991	117991	she	246	" Surely you see . I like Helen very much , you not so much . Mr. Mansbridge does n't know her . That 's all . And affection , when reciprocated , gives rights . Put that down in your notebook , Mr. Mansbridge . It 's a useful formula . "
118062	118072	118074	118074	Margaret	246	" You do n't know what you want yourselves , "
118080	118122	118074	118074	Margaret	246	" For one sensible remark I will let you in . But you can not make it . You would trouble my sister for no reason . I will not permit it . I 'll stand here all the day sooner . "
118123	118126	118128	118128	Henry	349	" Mansbridge , "
118134	118139	118128	118128	Henry	349	" perhaps not now . "
118161	118168	118169	118169	she	246	" Now , Henry , you , "
118183	118216	118169	118169	she	246	" Go away now , dear . I shall want your advice later , no doubt . Forgive me if I have been cross . But , seriously , you must go . "
118239	118250	118251	118251	she	246	" I shall soon find you down at Dolly 's , "
118327	118333	118334	118334	she	246	" Oh , my darling ! "
118337	118344	118334	118334	she	246	" My darling , forgive me . "
118384	118407	118369	118369	Helen	245	" Convenient ! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked . I have found nearly everything that I want . "
118416	118417	118369	118369	Helen	245	" "
118433	118434	118435	118435	Helen	245	" "
118446	118447	118437	118437	you	246	" "
118452	118465	118448	118448	I	0	" said Helen , turning away , and crying a very little . "
118475	118476	118477	118477	We	3171	" "
118493	118499	118487	118487	I	0	" Helen selected another book . "
118517	118569	118510	118511	our father	3173	" She did not think of questioning her sister , nor of rebuking her . Both might be necessary in the future , but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that Helen could have committed — that want of confidence that is the work of the devil . "
118576	118580	118572	118572	I	0	" replied Helen . "
118622	118623	118616	118616	I	0	" "
118630	118634	118635	118635	Helen	245	" called Margaret . "

118785	118790	118775	118775	you	245	" replied Helen judicially . "
118800	118801	118775	118775	you	245	" "
118811	118812	118804	118804	you	245	" "
118827	118834	118819	118819	We	3178	" Margaret glanced out of window . "
118861	118862	118863	118863	I	0	" "
118870	118871	118868	118868	Monica	525	" "

118923	118924	118914	118914	You	0	" "
118933	118939	118925	118925	She	525	" Margaret guessed at Monica 's type—"Italiano
118941	118970	118971	118971	You	0	" they had named it : the crude feminist of the South , whom one respects but avoids . And Helen had turned to it in her need ! "
118981	118990	118971	118971	You	0	" said Helen , with a measured kindness . "
119081	119082	119083	119083	Helen	245	" "
119106	119107	119103	119103	you	245	" "
119120	119137	119103	119103	you	245	" She dropped a book and sighed wearily . Then , recovering herself , she said : "
119152	119153	119103	119103	you	245	" "
119158	119159	119103	119103	you	245	" "
119171	119172	119103	119103	you	245	" "
119175	119176	119103	119103	you	245	" "
119183	119184	119185	119186	No one	693	" "
119188	119189	119185	119186	No one	693	" "
119198	119199	119192	119192	you	245	" "
119205	119212	119192	119192	you	245	" said Margaret with a frown . "
119219	119220	119192	119192	you	245	" "
119279	119280	119284	119284	you	245	" "
119322	119326	119316	119317	Miss Avery	451	" She stopped . "
119363	119364	119349	119349	you	245	" "
119372	119376	119365	119365	I	0	" said Helen . "
119431	119506	119545	119545	Meg	246	" Margaret could not contradict her . It was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans , not bitter or excitable , neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt , merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her . She had been through — how much ? Margaret did not know . But it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends . "
119512	119529	119545	119545	Meg	246	" said Helen , who had chosen her books , and was lingering over the furniture . "
119536	119537	119545	119545	Meg	246	" "
119547	119548	119545	119545	Meg	246	" "
119560	119561	119562	119562	You	245	" "
119568	119569	119574	119574	I	0	" "
119578	119579	119574	119574	I	0	" "
119594	119648	119574	119574	I	0	" Something had come between them . Perhaps it was Society , which henceforward would exclude Helen . Perhaps it was a third life , already potent as a spirit . They could find no meeting - place . Both suffered acutely , and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived . "
119659	119660	119661	119661	You	245	" "
119672	119673	119664	119664	you	245	" "
119725	119726	119729	119729	dearest	3177	" "
119731	119732	119729	119729	dearest	3177	" "
119741	119764	119729	119729	dearest	3177	" It seemed so . Most ghastly of all was Helen 's common sense : Monica had been extraordinarily good for her . "
119776	119802	119765	119765	I	0	" She looked at the bookcase lovingly , as if she was saying farewell to the past . Margaret unbolted the door . She remarked : "
119814	119851	119765	119765	I	0	" She led the way to it , glancing at the leaves and the sky . The spring had never seemed more beautiful . The driver , who was leaning on the gate , called out , "
119859	119872	119854	119854	lady	3200	" and handed her Henry 's visiting - card through the bars . "
119878	119926	119854	119854	lady	3200	" she asked . Crane had returned with it almost at once . She read the card with annoyance . It was covered with instructions in domestic French . When she and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to Dolly 's . "
119934	119941	119854	119854	lady	3200	" While Helen was to be found "
119948	119977	119978	119978	Henry	349	" The final sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the Charles ' had only one spare room , and so could not invite a third guest . "
119986	120035	119983	119983	he	349	" she interpreted . Helen had not followed her into the garden . The door once open , she lost her inclination to fly . She remained in the hall , going from bookcase to table . She grew more like the old Helen , irresponsible and charming . "
120043	120047	120038	120039	Mr. Wilcox	249	" she inquired . "
120054	120055	120049	120049	you	249	" "
120071	120072	120068	120068	ours	3202	" "
120078	120112	120073	120074	Miss Avery	451	" said Margaret , her own spirits lightening a little . Again she was invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty . But it brought her relief , and she yielded to it . "
120142	120143	120113	120113	She	451	" "
120175	120176	120149	120149	She	451	" "
120184	120185	120149	120149	She	451	" "
120188	120189	120149	120149	She	451	" "

120230	120231	120221	120221	Curious	526	" "
120238	120242	120243	120243	I	0	" announced Helen . "
120266	120267	120268	120268	You	0	" "
120311	120322	120324	120324	Helen	245	" Oh , what a place for mother 's chiffonier ! "
120326	120334	120324	120324	Helen	245	" Look at the chairs , though . "
120335	120351	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Oh , look at them ! Wickham Place faced north , did n't it ? "
120352	120357	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" North - west . "
120358	120384	120324	120324	Helen	245	" Anyhow , it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun . Feel . Their little backs are quite warm . "
120385	120401	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners ? I shall just — "
120402	120420	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Over here , Meg . Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn . "
120432	120443	120426	120426	Helen	245	" Ye - es . The window 's too high . "
120444	120452	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Try a drawing - room chair . "
120453	120483	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" No , I do n't like the drawing - room so much . The beam has been match - boarded . It would have been so beautiful otherwise . "
120484	120526	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Helen , what a memory you have for some things ! You 're perfectly right . It 's a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women . Men do n't know what we want — "
120527	120532	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" And never will . "
120533	120547	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" I do n't agree . In two thousand years they 'll know . "
120548	120563	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" But the chairs show up wonderfully . Look where Tibby spilt the soup . "
120564	120572	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Coffee . It was coffee surely . "
120578	120594	120573	120573	Helen	245	" Impossible . Tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time . "
120595	120600	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Was Father alive ? "
120601	120604	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Yes . "
120605	120690	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" Then you 're right and it must have been soup . I was thinking of much later — that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley 's , when she did n't realize that Tibby had grown up . It was coffee then , for he threw it down on purpose . There was some rhyme , ' Tea , coffee — coffee , tea , ' that she said to him every morning at breakfast . Wait a minute — how did it go ? "
120691	120708	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" I know — no , I do n't . What a detestable boy Tibby was ! "
120709	120727	120421	120421	Margaret	246	" But the rhyme was simply awful . No decent person could have put up with it . "
120728	120735	120737	120737	Helen	245	" Ah , that greengage tree , "
120750	120776	120777	120777	Margaret	246	" Why do I connect it with dumbbells ? And there come the chickens . The grass wants cutting . I love yellow - hammers — "
120781	120787	120788	120788	she	246	" I have got it , "
120791	120805	120788	120788	she	246	" That every morning for three weeks . No wonder Tibby was wild . "
120806	120814	120816	120816	Helen	245	" Tibby is moderately a dear now , "
120818	120838	120816	120816	Helen	245	" There ! I knew you 'd say that in the end . Of course he 's a dear . "
120843	120850	120851	120851	Helen	245	" Listen ! what 's that ? "
120854	120863	120851	120851	Helen	245	" Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege . "
120864	120870	120851	120851	Helen	245	" What nonsense — listen ! "
120984	120990	120981	120981	She	245	" It is always Meg . "
121049	121058	121037	121043	a little boy with a tin can	3216	" Little boy , what do you want ? "
121059	121067	121102	121102	she	246	" Please , I am the milk . "
121068	121075	121077	121077	Margaret	246	" Did Miss Avery send you ? "
121082	121087	121077	121077	Margaret	246	" Yes , please . "
121088	121100	121102	121102	she	246	" Then take it back and say we require no milk . "
121107	121126	121102	121102	she	246	" No , it 's not the siege , but possibly an attempt to provision us against one . "
121127	121133	121135	121135	Helen	245	" But I like milk , "
121137	121143	121135	121135	Helen	245	" Why send it away ? "
121144	121168	121102	121102	she	246	" Do you ? Oh , very well . But we 've nothing to put it in , and he wants the can . "
121169	121183	121185	121186	the boy	722	" Please , I 'm to call in the morning for the can , "
121188	121197	121185	121186	the boy	722	" The house will be locked up then . "
121198	121209	121102	121102	she	246	" In the morning would I bring eggs , too ? "
121210	121225	121226	121227	The child	4924	" Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week ? "
121232	121242	121226	121227	The child	4924	" Well , run away and do it again . "
121243	121248	121250	121250	Helen	245	" Nice little boy , "
121252	121265	121250	121250	Helen	245	" I say , what 's your name ? Mine 's Helen . "
121266	121269	121226	121227	The child	4924	" Tom . "
121297	121315	121289	121289	they	251	" Tom , this one here is Margaret . And at home we 've another called Tibby . "
121316	121323	121325	121325	Tom	453	" Mine are lop - eared , "
121334	121354	121289	121289	they	251	" You 're a very good and rather a clever little boy . Mind you come again.—Isn't he charming ? "
121355	121358	121360	121360	Margaret	246	" Undoubtedly , "
121362	121383	121360	121360	Margaret	246	" He is probably the son of Madge , and Madge is dreadful . But this place has wonderful powers . "
121384	121390	121289	121289	they	251	" What do you mean ? "
121391	121397	121289	121289	they	251	" I do n't know . "
121398	121406	121360	121360	Margaret	246	" Because I probably agree with you . "
121407	121420	121289	121289	they	251	" It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live . "
121421	121426	121428	121428	Helen	245	" I do agree , "
121436	121451	121428	121428	Helen	245	" But you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago . "
121452	121463	121360	121360	Margaret	246	" Meaning that I was dead . I felt it . "
121464	121524	121289	121289	they	251	" Yes , the house has a surer life than we , even if it was empty , and , as it is , I ca n't get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture . After all , Wickham Place was a grave . Meg , I 've a startling idea . "
121525	121530	121428	121428	Helen	245	" What is it ? "
121531	121539	121360	121360	Margaret	246	" Drink some milk to steady you . "
121543	121553	121555	121555	Helen	245	" No , I wo n't tell you yet , "
121557	121578	121555	121555	Helen	245	" because you may laugh or be angry . Let 's go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing . "
121642	121649	121650	121650	She	245	" Then one would see really . "
121680	121699	121677	121677	she	245	" About my idea . Could n't you and I camp out in this house for the night ? "
121700	121711	121713	121713	Margaret	246	" I do n't think we could well do that , "
121715	121724	121677	121677	she	245	" Here are beds , tables , towels — "
121725	121746	121677	121677	she	245	" I know ; but the house is n't supposed to be slept in , and Henry 's suggestion was — "
121747	121796	121677	121677	she	245	" I require no suggestions . I shall not alter anything in my plans . But it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you . It will be something to look back on . Oh , Meg lovey , do let 's ! "
121797	121805	121807	121807	Margaret	246	" But , Helen , my pet , "
121809	121847	121807	121807	Margaret	246	" we ca n't without getting Henry 's leave . Of course , he would give it , but you said yourself that you could n't visit at Ducie Street now , and this is equally intimate . "
121848	121899	121900	121900	Margaret	246	" Ducie Street is his house . This is ours . Our furniture , our sort of people coming to the door . Do let us camp out , just one night , and Tom shall feed us on eggs and milk . Why not ? It 's a moon . "
121903	121912	121913	121913	she	246	" I feel Charles would n't like it , "
121918	121973	121913	121913	she	246	" Even our furniture annoyed him , and I was going to clear it out when Aunt Juley 's illness prevented me . I sympathize with Charles . He feels it 's his mother 's house . He loves it in rather an untaking way . Henry I could answer for — not Charles . "
121974	121983	121985	121985	Helen	245	" I know he wo n't like it , "
121987	122024	121985	121985	Helen	245	" But I am going to pass out of their lives . What difference will it make in the long run if they say , ' And she even spent the night at Howards End ' ? "
122025	122045	121913	121913	she	246	" How do you know you 'll pass out of their lives ? We have thought that twice before . "
122046	122051	121913	121913	she	246	" Because my plans — "
122052	122061	121985	121985	Helen	245	" — which you change in a moment . "
122062	122074	122076	122076	Helen	245	" Then because my life is great and theirs are little , "
122081	122154	122076	122076	Helen	245	" I know of things they ca n't know of , and so do you . We know that there 's poetry . We know that there 's death . They can only take them on hearsay . We know this is our house , because it feels ours . Oh , they may take the title - deeds and the doorkeys , but for this one night we are at home . "
122155	122167	122169	122169	Margaret	246	" It would be lovely to have you once more alone , "
122171	122181	122169	122169	Margaret	246	" It may be a chance in a thousand . "
122182	122190	122191	122191	She	246	" Yes , and we could talk . "
122196	122231	122191	122191	She	246	" It wo n't be a very glorious story . But under that wych - elm — honestly , I see little happiness ahead . Can not I have this one night with you ? "
122232	122245	122169	122169	Margaret	246	" I need n't say how much it would mean to me . "
122246	122251	122191	122191	She	246	" Then let us . "
122252	122270	122191	122191	She	246	" It is no good hesitating . Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get leave ? "
122271	122280	122169	122169	Margaret	246	" Oh , we do n't want leave . "
122343	122349	122351	122351	Helen	245	" Charles may say no , "
122353	122360	122351	122351	Helen	245	" We sha n't consult him . "
122361	122374	122351	122351	Helen	245	" Go if you like ; I should have stopped without leave . "
122418	122447	122414	122414	Margaret	246	" Expect me back before dark . I am looking forward to it so much . It is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing . "
122448	122457	122459	122459	Helen	245	" Not a thing , only an ending , "
122587	122590	122581	122590	Dolly , who had not been " told , "	5799	" told , "
122619	122634	122635	122635	she	246	" But the diddums ca n't listen ; he is n't nine months old , "
122638	122647	122649	122654	her father - in - law	4362	" That 's not what I was saying , "
122682	122689	122690	122690	he	4362	" Is it what we feared ? "
122693	122697	122690	122690	he	4362	" It is . "
122698	122702	122703	122703	he	4362	" Dear girl , "
122706	122731	122703	122703	he	4362	" there is a troublesome business ahead of us , and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through . "
122737	122810	122734	122734	her	246	" I am obliged to question you on subjects we 'd both prefer to leave untouched . As you know , I am not one of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred . To speak as I must will pain me , but there are occasions — We are husband and wife , not children . I am a man of the world , and you are a most exceptional woman . "
122845	122888	122839	122839	he	3235	" I see that you feel as I felt when — My poor little wife ! Oh , be brave ! Just one or two questions , and I have done with you . Was your sister wearing a wedding - ring ? "
122892	122895	122889	122889	Margaret	246	" No . "
122902	122916	122889	122889	Margaret	246	" Henry , I really came to ask a favour about Howards End . "
122917	122937	122938	122938	She	246	" One point at a time . I am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer . "
122973	122978	122979	122979	he	3238	" Take your time , "
122983	122996	122979	122979	he	3238	" Remember that this is far worse for me than for you . "
123017	123031	123013	123013	she	246	" Seducer ? No ; I do not know her seducer 's name . "
123032	123039	122979	122979	he	3238	" Would she not tell you ? "
123040	123050	123052	123052	Margaret	246	" I never even asked her who seduced her , "
123061	123066	123052	123052	Margaret	246	" That is singular . "
123073	123128	123068	123068	he	3238	" Natural perhaps , dear girl , that you should n't ask . But until his name is known , nothing can be done . Sit down . How terrible it is to see you so upset ! I knew you were n't fit for it . I wish I had n't taken you . "
123132	123156	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" I like to stand , if you do n't mind , for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six Hills . "
123157	123162	122979	122979	he	3238	" As you like . "
123163	123174	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" Have you anything else to ask me , Henry ? "
123175	123225	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything . I have often noticed your insight , dear . I only wish my own was as good . You may have guessed something , even though your sister said nothing . The slightest hint would help us . "
123226	123233	122979	122979	he	3238	" Who is ' we ' ? "
123234	123244	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" I thought it best to ring up Charles . "
123245	123250	123252	123252	Margaret	246	" That was unnecessary , "
123257	123266	123252	123252	Margaret	246	" This news will give Charles disproportionate pain . "
123267	123279	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" He has at once gone to call on your brother . "
123280	123286	123129	123129	Margaret	246	" That too was unnecessary . "
123287	123335	123252	123252	Margaret	246	" Let me explain , dear , how the matter stands . You do n't think that I and my son are other than gentlemen ? It is in Helen 's interests that we are acting . It is still not too late to save her name . "
123345	123355	123356	123356	she	246	" Are we to make her seducer marry her ? "
123359	123365	123356	123356	she	246	" If possible . Yes . "
123366	123387	123252	123252	Margaret	246	" But , Henry , suppose he turned out to be married already ? One has heard of such cases . "
123388	123410	123356	123356	she	246	" In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct , and be thrashed within an inch of his life . "
123473	123482	123470	123470	she	246	" May I ask you my question now ? "
123483	123489	123470	123470	she	246	" Certainly , my dear . "
123490	123497	123470	123470	she	246	" Tomorrow Helen goes to Munich — "
123498	123506	123470	123470	she	246	" Well , possibly she is right . "
123507	123534	123470	123470	she	246	" Henry , let a lady finish . Tomorrow she goes ; tonight , with your permission , she would like to sleep at Howards End . "
123597	123602	123603	123603	he	349	" Why Howards End ? "
123608	123624	123603	123603	he	349	" Would she not be more comfortable , as I suggested , at the hotel ? "
123632	123653	123625	123625	Margaret	246	" It is an odd request , but you know what Helen is and what women in her state are . "
123661	123731	123654	123654	He	349	" She has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good . I think she 's right . Being one of those imaginative girls , the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her . This is a fact . It is the end of her girlhood . Her last words to me were , ' A beautiful ending . ' "
123732	123745	123603	123603	he	349	" She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons , in fact . "
123746	123764	123654	123654	He	349	" Exactly . You have quite understood . It is her last hope of being with it . "
123765	123840	123847	123847	he	3240	" I do n't agree there , my dear ! Helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes — possibly more than her share , for you are so fond of her that you 'd give her anything of yours that she fancies , would n't you ? and I 'd raise no objection . I could understand it if it was her old home , because a home , or a house"—he
123853	123917	123654	123654	He	349	point—"because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred , I do n't know why . Associations and so on . Now Helen has no associations with Howards End , though I and Charles and Evie have . I do not see why she wants to stay the night there . She will only catch cold . "
123918	123927	123929	123929	Margaret	246	" Leave it that you do n't see , "
123931	123953	123929	123929	Margaret	246	" Call it fancy . But realize that fancy is a scientific fact . Helen is fanciful , and wants to . "
123969	123997	123963	123963	He	3240	" If she wants to sleep one night , she may want to sleep two . We shall never get her out of the house , perhaps . "
123998	124001	124003	124003	Margaret	246	" Well ? "
124011	124036	124003	124003	Margaret	246	" And suppose we do n't get her out of the house ? Would it matter ? She would do no one any harm . "
124042	124047	124048	124048	she	246	" No , Henry , "
124053	124078	124048	124048	she	246	" I did n't mean that . We will only trouble Howards End for this one night . I take her to London tomorrow — "
124079	124092	123963	123963	He	3240	" Do you intend to sleep in a damp house , too ? "
124093	124101	123963	123963	He	3240	" She can not be left alone . "
124102	124118	124048	124048	she	246	" That 's quite impossible ! Madness . You must be here to meet Charles . "
124119	124142	123963	123963	He	3240	" I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary , and I have no desire to meet him . "
124143	124149	123963	123963	He	3240	" Margaret — my Margaret — "
124150	124177	124048	124048	she	246	" What has this business to do with Charles ? If it concerns me little , it concerns you less , and Charles not at all . "
124178	124187	124189	124190	Mr. Wilcox	249	" As the future owner of Howards End , "
124196	124206	124189	124190	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I should say that it did concern Charles . "
124207	124220	124048	124048	she	246	" In what way ? Will Helen 's condition depreciate the property ? "
124221	124230	124048	124048	she	246	" My dear , you are forgetting yourself . "
124231	124240	124241	124241	They	3241	" I think you yourself recommended plain speaking . "
124257	124263	124265	124265	Henry	349	" Helen commands my sympathy , "
124267	124322	124265	124265	Henry	349	" As your husband , I shall do all for her that I can , and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning . But I can not treat her as if nothing has happened . I should be false to my position in society if I did . "
124331	124343	124344	124344	she	3243	" No , let us go back to Helen 's request , "
124347	124445	124344	124344	she	3243	" It is unreasonable , but the request of an unhappy girl . Tomorrow she will go to Germany , and trouble society no longer . Tonight she asks to sleep in your empty house — a house which you do not care about , and which you have not occupied for over a year . May she ? Will you give my sister leave ? Will you forgive her — as you hope to be forgiven , and as you have actually been forgiven ? Forgive her for one night only . That will be enough . "
124446	124455	124482	124482	her	246	" As I have actually been forgiven — ? "
124456	124468	124470	124470	Margaret	246	" Never mind for the moment what I mean by that , "
124472	124477	124470	124470	Margaret	246	" Answer my question . "
124504	124568	124501	124501	he	3244	" I seem rather unaccommodating , but I have some experience of life , and know how one thing leads to another . I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel . I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider . I am sorry , but see that she leaves my house at once . "
124569	124575	124620	124620	Margaret	246	" You mentioned Mrs. Wilcox . "
124576	124582	124501	124501	he	3244	" I beg your pardon ? "
124583	124597	124620	124620	Margaret	246	" A rare occurrence . In reply , may I mention Mrs. Bast ? "
124598	124607	124609	124609	Henry	349	" You have not been yourself all day , "
124634	124641	124642	124642	she	246	" Not any more of this ! "
124645	124843	124642	124642	she	246	" You shall see the connection if it kills you , Henry ! You have had a mistress — I forgave you . My sister has a lover — you drive her from the house . Do you see the connection ? Stupid , hypocritical , cruel — oh , contemptible ! — a man who insults his wife when she 's alive and cants with her memory when she 's dead . A man who ruins a woman for his pleasure , and casts her off to ruin other men . And gives bad financial advice , and then says he is not responsible . These , man , are you . You ca n't recognize them , because you can not connect . I 've had enough of your unweeded kindness . I 've spoilt you long enough . All your life you have been spoiled . Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you . No one has ever told what you are — muddled , criminally muddled . Men like you use repentance as a blind , so do n't repent . Only say to yourself , ' What Helen has done , I 've done . ' "
124844	124851	124852	124852	Henry	349	" The two cases are different , "
124878	124926	124872	124872	he	349	" In what way different ? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox , Helen only herself . You remain in society , Helen ca n't . You have had only pleasure , she may die . You have the insolence to talk to me of differences , Henry ? "
124939	125002	124934	124934	Henry	349	" I perceive you are attempting blackmail . It is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband . My rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats , and I can only repeat what I said before : I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at Howards End . "
125571	125584	125567	125567	he	250	" I suppose you realize that you are your sister 's protector ? "
125585	125590	125567	125567	he	250	" In what sense ? "
125591	125616	125567	125567	he	250	" If a man played about with my sister , I 'd send a bullet through him , but perhaps you do n't mind . "
125617	125623	125625	125625	Tibby	250	" I mind very much , "
125627	125644	125625	125625	Tibby	250	" Who d'ye suspect , then ? Speak out , man . One always suspects someone . "
125645	125655	125567	125567	he	250	" No one . I do n't think so . "
125670	125676	125678	125678	Charles	510	" You are hiding something , "
125692	125711	125712	125712	he	250	" When you saw her last , did she mention anyone 's name ? Yes , or no ! "
125720	125733	125712	125712	he	250	" In my rooms she mentioned some friends , called the Basts — "
125734	125740	125678	125678	Charles	510	" Who are the Basts ? "
125741	125752	125678	125678	Charles	510	" People — friends of hers at Evie 's wedding . "
125753	125813	125712	125712	he	250	" I do n't remember . But , by great Scott ! I do . My aunt told me about some tag - rag . Was she full of them when you saw her ? Is there a man ? Did she speak of the man ? Or — look here — have you had any dealings with him ? "
125896	125928	125888	125888	he	250	" I see — you are in his confidence . They met at your rooms . Oh , what a family , what a family ! God help the poor pater — "
126309	126313	126315	126315	Helen	245	" One isolates , "
126318	126363	126315	126315	Helen	245	" I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other forces that were pulling Leonard downhill . Consequently , I was full of pity , and almost of revenge . For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only , and so , when your letters came — "
126364	126372	126374	126374	Margaret	246	" I need never have written them , "
126376	126396	126374	126374	Margaret	246	" They never shielded Henry . How hopeless it is to tidy away the past , even for others ! "
126397	126413	126315	126315	Helen	245	" I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts . "
126414	126424	126315	126315	Helen	245	" Looking back , that was wrong of me . "
126425	126699	126700	126700	She	3295	" Looking back , darling , I know that it was right . It is right to save the man whom one loves . I am less enthusiastic about justice now . But we both thought you wrote at his dictation . It seemed the last touch of his callousness . Being very much wrought up by this time — and Mrs. Bast was upstairs . I had not seen her , and had talked for a long time to Leonard — I had snubbed him for no reason , and that should have warned me I was in danger . So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation . He said that he guessed the explanation — he knew of it , and you must n't know . I pressed him to tell me . He said no one must know ; it was something to do with his wife . Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast and Miss Schlegel . I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when I saw his eyes , and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two ways , not one . I drew him to me . I made him tell me . I felt very lonely myself . He is not to blame . He would have gone on worshipping me . I want never to see him again , though it sounds appalling . I wanted to give him money and feel finished . Oh , Meg , the little that is known about these things ! "
126708	126741	126700	126700	She	3295	" The little , too , that is known about growth ! Both times it was loneliness , and the night , and panic afterwards . Did Leonard grow out of Paul ? "
126797	126806	126807	126807	she	246	" Leonard is a better growth than madness , "
126810	126827	126807	126807	she	246	" I was afraid that you would react against Paul until you went over the verge . "
126828	126893	126894	126894	Margaret	246	" I did react until I found poor Leonard . I am steady now . I sha n't ever like your Henry , dearest Meg , or even speak kindly about him , but all that blinding hate is over . I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any more . I understand how you married him , and you will now be very happy . "
126899	126902	126904	126904	Helen	245	" Yes , "
126912	126919	126906	126906	her	245	" I do at last understand . "
126920	126934	126906	126906	her	245	" Except Mrs. Wilcox , dearest , no one understands our little movements . "
126935	126943	126906	126906	her	245	" Because in death — I agree . "
126944	127064	126906	126906	her	245	" Not quite . I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that woman 's mind . She knows everything . She is everything . She is the house , and the tree that leans over it . People have their own deaths as well as their own lives , and even if there is nothing beyond death , we shall differ in our nothingness . I can not believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine . She knew about realities . She knew when people were in love , though she was not in the room . I do n't doubt that she knew when Henry deceived her . "
127065	127073	126906	126906	her	245	" Good - night , Mrs. Wilcox , "
127078	127088	126906	126906	her	245	" Oh , good - night , Miss Avery . "
127089	127098	127099	127099	Helen	245	" Why should Miss Avery work for us ? "
127102	127107	127099	127099	Helen	245	" Why , indeed ? "
127166	127175	127177	127177	Helen	245	" This is not quite our house yet , "
127179	127195	127177	127177	Helen	245	" When Miss Avery called , I felt we are only a couple of tourists . "
127196	127207	127236	127236	Helen	245	" We shall be that everywhere , and for ever . "
127208	127213	127177	127177	Helen	245	" But affectionate tourists — "
127214	127225	127177	127177	Helen	245	" But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home . "
127226	127234	127236	127236	Helen	245	" I ca n't pretend very long , "
127238	127280	127236	127236	Helen	245	" Sitting under this tree one forgets , but I know that tomorrow I shall see the moon rise out of Germany . Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case . Unless you will come with me . "
127348	127366	127338	127338	She	246	" Are you serious in asking me , Helen ? Should I get on with your Monica ? "
127367	127380	127338	127338	She	246	" You would not , but I am serious in asking you . "
127381	127394	127395	127395	They	3299	" Still , no more plans now . And no more reminiscences . "
127475	127479	127481	127481	Margaret	246	" Sleep now , "
127535	127538	127493	127493	It	3301	" now , "
127540	127542	127493	127493	It	3301	" now "
127552	127555	127493	127493	It	3301	" now , "
127714	127725	127708	127708	he	3661	" Brute — you brute , I could n't have — "
127823	127835	127807	127807	He	308	" Oh what shall I do , whatever shall I do ? "
128327	128339	128312	128312	he	3323	" There is nothing to choose between us , after all . "
128469	128475	128477	128477	Blanche	535	" A letter from Leonard , "
128482	128489	128477	128477	Blanche	535	" and after all this time . "
128529	128535	128537	128539	the other sister	3339	" A letter from Leonard ! "
128657	128672	128647	128647	Laura	536	" She minds that ! What would she say if she knew the truth ? "
129557	129569	129551	129552	the clerks	3380	" Excuse me , sir , but is your boss married ? "
129578	129585	129575	129575	some	1422	" What 's that to you ? "
129740	129747	129748	129748	he	308	" Does Mrs. Wilcox live here ? "
129751	129756	129748	129748	he	308	" She 's out , "
129761	129768	129748	129748	he	308	" When will she be back ? "
129769	129774	129776	129777	the parlourmaid	3386	" I 'll ask , "
129852	129867	129848	129848	He	250	" I do n't know . Hilton . Howards End . Who is it ? "
129868	129875	129835	129836	Charles Wilcox	510	" I 'll ask , sir . "
129876	129883	129848	129848	He	250	" No , do n't bother . "
129884	129894	129899	129899	Leonard	308	" They have taken the car to Howards End , "
129912	129923	129924	129924	she	246	" You appear to want to know a good deal , "
129950	129958	129936	129936	She	246	" Is it a village , please ? "
129959	129991	129936	129936	She	246	" Village ! It 's Mr. Wilcox 's private house — at least , it 's one of them . Mrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there . Hilton is the village . "
129992	130002	129936	129936	She	246	" Yes . And when will they be back ? "
130003	130019	130020	130020	She	246	" Mr. Schlegel does n't know . We ca n't know everything , can we ? "
130118	130130	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Why horrible ? It 's ordinary light from the room . "
130131	130136	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" But it moves . "
130137	130143	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" So does the moon . "
130144	130152	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" But it is a clenched fist . "
130153	130157	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Why not ? "
130158	130167	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" But it is going to touch me . "
130168	130172	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Let it . "
130200	130208	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Is there life in the moon ? "
130209	130213	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Of course . "
130214	130222	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" But I thought it was uninhabited . "
130223	130237	130113	130115	Part of him	3395	" Not by Time , Death , Judgment , and the smaller snakes . "
130238	130242	130244	130244	Leonard	308	" Smaller snakes ! "
130249	130254	130244	130244	Leonard	308	" What a notion ! "
130305	130319	130320	130320	She	3397	" I say , Jacky , I 'm going out for a bit . "
130482	130492	130479	130479	her	3397	" Hullo , Len ! What ho , Len ! "
130493	130504	130505	130505	She	3397	" What ho , Jacky ! see you again later . "
130861	130864	130858	130858	her	3418	" now . "
131317	131326	131312	131312	He	308	" Mrs. Wilcox , I have done wrong , "
131410	131433	131401	131407	a man whom he had never seen	3459	" Oh , is he there ? I am not surprised . I now thrash him within an inch of his life . "
131434	131438	131440	131440	Leonard	308	" Mrs. Wilcox , "
131442	131448	131440	131440	Leonard	308	" I have done wrong . "
131459	131465	131449	131450	The man	778	" Bring me a stick . "
131504	131509	131511	131511	Charles	510	" Get some water , "
131521	131543	131511	131511	Charles	510	" He 's shamming . Of course I only used the blade . Here , carry him out into the air . "
131573	131578	131580	131580	Charles	510	" That 's enough , "
131582	131589	131591	131592	Miss Avery	451	" Yes , murder 's enough , "
131651	131662	131664	131664	Charles	510	" I do n't know where she is , pater , "
131666	131677	131664	131664	Charles	510	" Dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her . "
131678	131685	131699	131699	his	308	" Tell me when she comes in—. "
131715	131746	131708	131709	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" I 'll sit up for her as late as you like , but she can hardly be coming . Is n't she stopping with her sister at the hotel ? "
131747	131750	131752	131753	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Perhaps , "
131754	131756	131708	131709	Mrs. Wilcox	510	thoughtfully—"perhaps . "
131757	131767	131708	131709	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Can I do anything for you , sir ? "
131768	131775	131708	131709	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" Not tonight , my boy . "
131836	131842	131843	131843	he	249	" I ca n't sleep , "
131846	131860	131861	131861	He	249	" I had better have a talk with you and get it over . "
131910	131919	131921	131922	Mr. Wilcox	249	" She will feel differently in the morning , "
131934	132004	132005	132005	He	249	" But I can not let this kind of thing continue without comment . I am morally certain that she is with her sister at Howards End . The house is mine — and , Charles , it will be yours — and when I say that no one is to live there , I mean that no one is to live there . I wo n't have it . "
132012	132031	132005	132005	He	249	" To my mind this question is connected with something far greater , the rights of property itself . "
132032	132035	132037	132037	Charles	249	" Undoubtedly , "
132060	132129	132055	132055	he	249	" I do n't want you to conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a quarrel . She was only over - wrought , as who would not be ? I shall do what I can for Helen , but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once . Do you see ? That is a sine qua non . "
132130	132143	132192	132192	he	249	" Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the car ? "
132144	132169	132055	132055	he	249	" Eight or earlier . Say that you are acting as my representative , and , of course , use no violence , Charles . "
132264	132271	132273	132273	Charles	249	" It has been pretty horrible , "
132276	132292	132273	132273	Charles	249	" They were there , and they had the man up there with them too . "
132293	132299	132235	132236	the police	4466	" What — what man ? "
132300	132312	132273	132273	Charles	249	" I told you last night . His name was Bast . "
132313	132321	132323	132324	Mr. Wilcox	249	" My God , is it possible ? "
132326	132341	132323	132324	Mr. Wilcox	249	" In your mother 's house ! Charles , in your mother 's house ! "
132342	132406	132235	132236	the police	4466	" I know , pater . That was what I felt . As a matter of fact , there is no need to trouble about the man . He was in the last stages of heart disease , and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went off . The police are seeing about it at this moment . "
132412	132496	132407	132408	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I got up there — oh , it could n't have been more than half - past seven . The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them . They were still upstairs . I waited in the drawing - room . We were all moderately civil and collected , though I had my suspicions . I gave them your message , and Mrs. Wilcox said , ' Oh yes , I see ; yes , ' in that way of hers . "
132497	132501	132273	132273	Charles	249	" Nothing else ? "
132502	132535	132536	132537	Mr. Wilcox	249	" I promised to tell you , ' with her love , ' that she was going to Germany with her sister this evening . That was all we had time for . "
132541	132592	132536	132537	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding , for suddenly Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his name . I recognized it , and I went for him in the hall . Was I right , pater ? I thought things were going a little too far . "
132593	132632	132633	132633	He	3484	" Right , my dear boy ? I do n't know . But you would have been no son of mine if you had n't . Then did he just — just — crumple up as you said ? "
132640	132686	132633	132633	He	3484	" He caught hold of the bookcase , which came down over him . So I merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden . We all thought he was shamming . However , he 's dead right enough . Awful business ! "
132687	132690	132698	132698	his	3799	" Sword ? "
132701	132708	132698	132698	his	3799	" What sword ? Whose sword ? "
132709	132715	132633	132633	He	3484	" A sword of theirs . "
132716	132724	132633	132633	He	3484	" What were you doing with it ? "
132725	132772	132698	132698	his	3799	" Well , did n't you see , pater , I had to snatch up the first thing handy I had n't a riding - whip or stick . I caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old German sword . "
132773	132777	132633	132633	He	3484	" Then what ? "
132778	132792	132794	132794	Charles	510	" He pulled over the bookcase , as I said , and fell , "
132816	132831	132807	132808	his father	3799	" But the real cause was heart disease ? Of that you 're sure ? "
132832	132854	132855	132855	They	3487	" That or a fit . However , we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics . "
132975	132988	132990	132991	his father	3799	" I think I 'll go round to the police - station , "
132997	133001	133003	133003	Dolly	336	" What for ? "
133010	133013	133003	133003	Dolly	336	" told . "
133014	133026	133003	133003	Dolly	336	" Very well , sir . Which car will you have ? "
133027	133034	132990	132991	his father	3799	" I think I 'll walk . "
133035	133044	133046	133046	Charles	510	" It 's a good half - mile , "
133053	133081	133046	133046	Charles	510	" The sun 's very hot for April . Sha n't I take you up , and then , perhaps , a little spin round by Tewin ? "
133082	133096	133098	133099	Mr. Wilcox	249	" You go on as if I did n't know my own mind , "
133107	133137	133102	133102	Charles	249	" You young fellows ' one idea is to get into a motor . I tell you , I want to walk : I 'm very fond of walking . "
133138	133173	133185	133186	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Oh , all right ; I 'm about the house if you want me for anything . I thought of not going up to the office today , if that is your wish . "
133174	133183	133185	133186	Mr. Wilcox	249	" It is , indeed , my boy , "
133329	133331	133323	133323	he	249	" I "
133409	133414	133416	133416	Charles	249	" I expected that , "
133418	133429	133416	133416	Charles	249	" I shall naturally be the most important witness there . "
133744	133755	133735	133736	Miss Avery	451	" No one ever told the lad he 'll have a child"—they
134065	134075	134076	134076	she	245	" No doubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death , "
134079	134098	134076	134076	she	245	" but if it was n't one thing it would have been another , as you yourselves know . "
134211	134215	134216	134217	the Schlegels	261	" Nothing matters , "

134870	134880	134881	134881	she	246	" Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants ? "
134884	134892	134881	134881	she	246	" He did n't say , madam . "
134893	134902	134941	134941	She	245	" You have n't any note for me ? "
134903	134911	134917	134917	she	245	" He did n't say , madam . "
135035	135045	135031	135031	he	349	" I prefer to discuss things with you outside . "
135046	135060	135062	135062	Margaret	246	" It will be more appropriate in the road , I am afraid , "
135064	135071	135031	135031	he	349	" Did you get my message ? "
135072	135076	135031	135031	he	349	" What about ? "
135077	135124	135031	135031	he	349	" I am going to Germany with my sister . I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent home . Our talk last night was more important than you have realized . I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you . "
135125	135131	135133	135133	Henry	349	" I am extremely tired , "
135139	135155	135133	135133	Henry	349	" I have been walking about all the morning , and wish to sit down . "
135156	135169	135031	135031	he	349	" Certainly , if you will consent to sit on the grass . "
135226	135232	135234	135234	Margaret	246	" Here are your keys , "
135259	135267	135268	135268	he	349	" I have something to tell you , "
135295	135304	135305	135305	she	3564	" I do n't want to hear it , "
135308	135342	135305	135305	she	3564	" My sister is going to be ill . My life is going to be with her now . We must manage to build up something , she and I and her child . "
135343	135349	135268	135268	he	349	" Where are you going ? "
135350	135366	135305	135305	she	3564	" Munich . We start after the inquest , if she is not too ill . "
135367	135372	135305	135305	she	3564	" After the inquest ? "
135373	135376	135268	135268	he	349	" Yes . "
135377	135390	135268	135268	he	349	" Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be ? "
135391	135397	135305	135305	she	3564	" Yes , heart disease . "
135398	135406	135407	135407	Margaret	246	" No , my dear ; manslaughter . "
135426	135429	135431	135432	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Manslaughter , "
135434	135466	135431	135432	Mr. Wilcox	249	" Charles may go to prison . I dare not tell him . I do n't know what to do — what to do . I 'm broken — I'm ended . "
135642	135649	135650	135650	she	245	" I have n't any idea , "
135653	135662	135650	135650	she	245	" Do you suppose baby may , Meg ? "
135673	135678	135679	135679	she	246	" What was that ? "
135682	135697	135679	135679	she	246	" Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay ? "
135698	135706	135708	135708	Margaret	246	" I have n't the least notion , "
135717	135782	135783	135783	Tom	453	" Now , Tom , baby is not to stand ; he is not to lie on his face ; he is not to lie so that his head wags ; he is not to be teased or tickled ; and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter . Will you be as careful as all that ? "
135789	135797	135799	135799	Margaret	246	" That child is a wonderful nursemaid , "
135801	135815	135817	135817	Helen	245	" He is fond of baby . That 's why he does it ! "
135829	135830	135826	135827	lifelong friends	3579	" "

135865	136014	135863	135863	baby	1302	" Fourteen months had passed , but Margaret still stopped at Howards End . No better plan had occurred to her . The meadow was being recut , the great red poppies were reopening in the garden . July would follow with the little red poppies among the wheat , August with the cutting of the wheat . These little events would become part of her year after year . Every summer she would fear lest the well should give out , every winter lest the pipes should freeze ; every westerly gale might blow the wych - elm down and bring the end of all things , and so she could not read or talk during a westerly gale . The air was tranquil now . She and her sister were sitting on the remains of Evie 's mockery , where the lawn merged into the field . "
136022	136026	135863	135863	baby	1302	" said Helen . "
136034	136078	135863	135863	baby	1302	" Margaret , who was growing less talkative , made no answer . The noise of the cutter came intermittently , like the breaking of waves . Close by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell - holes . "
136088	136092	136081	136081	Henry	349	" said Helen . "
136110	136111	136143	136143	Meg	246	" "
136117	136121	136143	136143	Meg	246	" said Margaret . "
136141	136142	136143	136143	Meg	246	" "
136158	136159	136152	136152	I	0	" "

136246	136252	136226	136226	he	349	" Margaret did not answer . "
136265	136266	136261	136261	I	0	" "
136276	136280	136272	136272	you	0	" said Margaret . "
136285	136286	136281	136281	I	0	" "
136289	136357	136281	136281	I	0	" She lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past . They had crossed it , always excepting Leonard and Charles . They were building up a new life , obscure , yet gilded with tranquillity . Leonard was dead ; Charles had two years more in prison . One usen't always to see clearly before that time . It was different now . "
136366	136367	136362	136362	he	349	" "
136377	136399	136369	136369	he	349	" Helen sighed . She seemed humiliated , and buried her face in her hands . After a time she said : "
136403	136417	136418	136418	I	0	" a transition less abrupt than it appeared . Margaret never stopped working . "
136560	136561	136562	136562	I	0	" "
136571	136572	136567	136567	I	0	" "
136582	136592	136577	136577	Leonard	308	" said Helen , stepping down into the field . "
136644	136651	136639	136639	I	0	" Her eyes filled with tears . "
136666	136671	136672	136672	Tommy	453	" She broke off . "
136674	136675	136672	136672	Tommy	453	" "
136680	136681	136682	136682	Baby	1302	" "
136732	136740	136721	136721	I	0	" Margaret silenced her . She said : "
136952	136953	136903	136903	God	281	" "
136967	136968	136961	136961	Leonard	308	" "
136973	136974	136961	136961	Leonard	308	" "
136979	136980	136961	136961	Leonard	308	" "
136989	137036	136987	136987	him	308	" Helen took up a bunch of grass . She looked at the sorrel , and the red and white and yellow clover , and the quaker grass , and the daisies , and the bents that composed it . She raised it to her face . "
137042	137046	136987	136987	him	308	" asked Margaret . "
137052	137053	136987	136987	him	308	" "
137059	137063	136987	136987	him	308	" Helen smiled . "
137073	137077	137068	137068	you	246	" she said . "
137109	137110	137107	137107	you	246	" "
137138	137139	137118	137118	You	246	" "
137148	137171	137172	137172	You	246	" Margaret did not reply . The scything had begun , and she took off her pince - nez to watch it . "
137174	137178	137172	137172	You	246	" cried Helen . "
137301	137302	137303	137303	You	246	" "
137311	137315	137303	137303	You	246	" said Margaret . "
137379	137380	137381	137381	I	0	" "
137388	137398	137399	137399	I	0	" said Helen , drifting away to other thoughts . "
137415	137416	137407	137407	I	0	" "
137425	137449	137407	137407	I	0	" She pointed over the meadow — over eight or nine meadows , but at the end of them was a red rust . "
137460	137464	137450	137450	You	3619	" she continued . "
137500	137564	137483	137483	I	0	" Margaret knew that her sister spoke truly . Howards End , Oniton , the Purbeck Downs , the Oderberge , were all survivals , and the melting - pot was being prepared for them . Logically , they had no right to be alive . One 's hope was in the weakness of logic . Were they possibly the earth beating time ? "
137581	137585	137483	137483	I	0	" she said . "
137660	137694	137646	137646	I	0	" They turned and looked at it . Their own memories coloured it now , for Helen 's child had been born in the central room of the nine . Then Margaret said , "
137701	137717	137718	137719	The conclave	3625	" for something moved behind the window of the hall , and the door opened . "
137729	137762	137725	137725	I	0	" It was Paul . Helen retreated with the children far into the field . Friendly voices greeted her . Margaret rose , to encounter a man with a heavy black moustache . "
137770	137784	137763	137764	My father	3721	" he said with hostility . She took her work and followed him . "
137791	137795	137785	137785	We	3627	" he continued , "
137807	137808	137800	137800	you	0	" "
137814	137984	137800	137800	you	0	" Clumsy of movement — for he had spent all his life in the saddle — Paul drove his foot against the paint of the front door . Mrs. Wilcox gave a little cry of annoyance . She did not like anything scratched ; she stopped in the hall to take Dolly 's boa and gloves out of a vase . Her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining - room , and by his side , holding his hand rather ostentatiously , was Evie . Dolly , dressed in purple , sat near the window . The room was a little dark and airless ; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay . Margaret joined the family without speaking ; the five of them had met already at tea , and she knew quite well what was going to be said . Averse to wasting her time , she went on sewing . The clock struck six . "
137993	138015	137800	137800	you	0	" said Henry in a weary voice . He used the old phrases , but their effect was unexpected and shadowy . "
138035	138036	138030	138030	I	0	" "
138045	138049	138030	138030	I	0	" said Paul . "
138074	138088	138065	138065	I	0	" Paul frowned ill - temperedly , and began scratching at his arm . "
138121	138127	138065	138065	I	0	" he said at last . "
138142	138143	138065	138065	I	0	" "
138155	138156	138160	138160	Father	348	" "
138162	138163	138160	138160	Father	348	" "
138169	138185	138165	138165	you	0	" Dolly raised her faded little face , which sorrow could wither but not steady . "
138189	138193	138165	138165	you	0	" she said . "
138261	138287	138252	138252	I	0	" There was a general silence . Dolly looked nervously round , fearing that she had been inappropriate . Paul continued to scratch his arm . "
138298	138302	138289	138289	I	0	" said Henry . "
138324	138360	138364	138364	I	0	" Margaret did not answer . There was something uncanny in her triumph . She , who had never expected to conquer anyone , had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives . "
138371	138375	138364	138364	I	0	" said Henry . "
138478	138510	138474	138475	every one	1304	" Paul rose to his feet . He was accustomed to natives , and a very little shook him out of the Englishman . Feeling manly and cynical , he said : "
138533	138538	138520	138520	I	0	" Mrs. Cahill whispered : "
138551	138573	138544	138544	You	247	" Feeling a woman of the world , she rose and prepared to take her leave . Her father kissed her . "
138581	138585	138578	138579	old girl	3653	" he said ; "
138593	138594	138588	138588	you	3653	" "
138601	138620	138599	138599	Dad	454	" Then it was Dolly 's turn . Anxious to contribute , she laughed nervously , and said : "
138651	138661	138644	138644	she	510	" From Evie came a sharply - drawn breath . "
138666	138692	138644	138644	she	510	" she said to Margaret , and kissed her . And again and again fell the word , like the ebb of a dying sea . "
138697	138698	138644	138644	she	510	" "
138705	138706	138703	138703	Dolly	336	" "
138712	138713	138710	138710	Father	348	" "
138727	138728	138733	138734	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
138736	138737	138733	138734	Mrs. Wilcox	510	" "
138782	138802	138779	138779	she	339	" Could you tell me , Henry , what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End ? "
138807	138892	138804	138804	he	4099	" Yes , she did . But that is a very old story . When she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return , and , not being herself at the time , scribbled ' Howards End ' on a piece of paper . I went into it thoroughly , and , as it was clearly fanciful , I set it aside , little knowing what my Margaret would be to me in the future . "
138910	138920	138921	138921	he	4099	" I did n't do wrong , did I ? "
138927	138940	138921	138921	he	4099	" You did n't , darling . Nothing has been done wrong . "
138947	138954	138956	138956	Henry	349	" Here they are at last ! "
138990	138996	138997	138997	Helen	245	" The field 's cut ! "
138999	139023	138997	138997	Helen	245	excitedly—"the big meadow ! We 've seen to the very end , and it 'll be such a crop of hay as never ! "
