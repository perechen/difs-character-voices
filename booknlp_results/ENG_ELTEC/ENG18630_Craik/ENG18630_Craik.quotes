2291	2333	2287	2287	Hilary	91	" I am sure we can well afford both to keep and to feed a servant , and to have a fire in the parlor every day . Why not take our meals there , and sit there regularly of evenings ? "
2334	2338	2340	2340	Selina	92	" We must , "
2344	2402	2340	2340	Selina	92	" For my part , I could n't eat , or sew , or do any thing with that great hulking girl sitting starting opposite , or standing ; for how could we ask her to sit with us ? Already , what must she have thought of us — people who take tea in the kitchen ? "

2425	2491	2413	2415	the eldest sister	326	" Every body in the town knows who and what we are , or might , if they chose to inquire . We can not conceal our poverty if we tried ; and I do n't think any body looks down upon us for it . Not even since we began to keep school , which you thought was such a terrible thing , Selina . "
2492	2541	2340	2340	Selina	92	" And it was . I have never reconciled myself to teaching the baker 's two boys and the grocer 's little girl . You were wrong , Johanna , you ought to have drawn the line somewhere , and it ought to have excluded trades - people . "

2592	2632	2573	2574	Miss Leaf	92	" You know well we have never begged or borrowed from any body , and hardly ever been indebted to any body , except for the extra lessons that Mr. Lyon would insist upon giving to Ascott at home . "
2652	2708	2639	2639	Hilary	91	" I think , sisters , we are forgetting that the staircase is quite open , and though I am sure she has an honest look and not that of a listener , still Elizabeth might hear . Shall I call her down stairs , and tell her to light a fire in the parlor ? "

8598	8632	8584	8584	Hilary	91	" Yes , love , you are right ; she must remain her month out , unless she does something very wrong . Do you think that really was a lie she told ? "
8633	8681	8682	8683	Other people	560	" About the cat ? I do n't quite know what to think . Let us call her , and put the question once more . Do you put it , Johanna . I do n't think she could look at you and tell you a story . "
8729	8766	8725	8725	Hilary	91	" Sit down ; I 'll call her . Dear me , Johanna , we shall have to set up a bell as well as a servant , unless we had managed to combine the two . "
8893	8932	8888	8889	Her mistress	431	" Elizabeth I want you to tell me the truth about that unfortunate breakage . Do n't be afraid . I had rather you broke every thing in the house than have told me what was not true . "
8933	8943	9035	9035	Hilary	91	" It was true ; it was the cat . "
8944	8963	8888	8889	Her mistress	431	" How could that be possible ? You were coming down stairs with the ewer in your hand . "
8964	8989	8990	8992	The Misses Leaf	89	" Her got under my feet , and throwed me down , and so I tumbled , and smashed the thing agin the floor . "
9023	9033	9035	9035	Hilary	91	" I am sure she is telling the truth . "
9037	9051	9035	9035	Hilary	91	" And remember what her mother said about her word being always reliable . "
9075	9092	9060	9060	She	94	" If you donnot believe me , missus , I 'd rather go home to mother . "
9093	9099	9101	9102	Miss Leaf	91	" I do believe you , "
9125	9178	9060	9060	She	94	" I can quite well understand the accident now ; and I am sure if you had put it as plainly at first , my sister would have understood it too . She was very much annoyed , and no wonder . She will be equally glad to find she was mistaken . "
9223	9279	9217	9217	Hilary	91	" Miss Selina is sometimes hasty ; but she means kindly always . You must take care not to vex her , Elizabeth ; and you must never answer her back again , however sharply she speaks . It is not your business ; you are only a child , and she is your mistress . "
9280	9292	9302	9302	her	94	" Is her ? I thought it was this ' un . "
9309	9314	9302	9302	her	94	" this ' un . "
9340	9360	9362	9362	Johanna	93	" Yes , I am the eldest , and I suppose you may consider me specially as your mistress , "
9366	9367	9362	9362	Johanna	93	" "
9444	9566	9432	9432	she	91	" Elizabeth obeyed silently ; she had apparently a great gift for silence . And she was certainly both obedient and willing ; not stupid , either , though a nervousness of temperament which Hilary was surprised to find in so big and coarse - looking a girl , made her rather awkward at first . However , she succeeded in pouring out and carrying into the parlor , without accident , three platefuls of that excellent condiment which formed the frugal supper of the family ; but which they ate , I grieve to say , in an orthodox southern fashion , with sugar or treacle , until Mr. Lyon — greatly horrified thereby — had instituted his national custom of "
9568	9632	9633	9633	them	572	" porridge with milk . It may be a very unsentimental thing to confess , but Hilary , who even at twenty was rather practical than poetical , never made the porridge without thinking of Robert Lyon , and the day when he first staid to supper , and ate it , or as he said and was very much laughed at , ate "
9634	9699	9704	9704	You	573	" with such infinite relish Since then , whenever he came , he always asked for his porridge , saying it carried him back to his childish days . And Hilary , with that curious pleasure that women take in waiting upon any one unto whom the heart is ignorantly beginning to own the allegiance , humble yet proud , of Miranda to Ferdinand : "
9721	9788	9710	9710	I	0	" Hilary always contrived to make his supper herself . Those pleasant days were now over . Mr. Lyon was gone . As she stool alone over the kitchen fire , she thought — as now and then she let herself think for a minute or two in her busy prosaic life — of that August night , standing at the front door , of his last "
9793	10172	9710	9710	I	0	" and last hand - clasp , tight , warm , and firm ; and somehow she , like Johanna , trusted in him . Not exactly in his love ; it seemed almost impossible that he should love her , at least till she grew much more worthy of him than now ; but in himself , that he would never be less himself , less thoroughly good and true than now . That , some time , he would be sure to come back again , and take up his old relations with them , brightening their dull life with his cheerfulness ; infusing in their feminine household the new element of a clear , strong , energetic , manly will , which sometimes made Johanna say that instead of twenty - five the young man might be forty ; and , above all , bringing into their poverty the silent sympathy of one who had fought his own battle with the world — a hard one , too , as his face sometimes showed — though he never said much about it . Of the results of this pleasant relation — whether she being the only truly marriageable person in the house . Robert Lyon intended to marry her , or was expected to do so , or that society would think it a very odd thing if he did not do so — this unsophisticated Hilary never thought at all . If he had said to her that the present state of things was to go on forever ; she to remain always Hilary Leaf , and he Robert Lyon , the faithful friend of the family , she would have smiled in his face and been perfectly satisfied . True , she had never had any thing to drive away the smile from that innocent face ; no vague jealousies aroused ; no maddening rumors afloat in the small world that was his and theirs . Mr. Lyon was grave and sedate in all his ways ; he never paid the slightest attention to , or expressed the slightest interest in , any woman whatsoever . And so this hapless girl loved , him — just himself ; without the slightest reference to his "
10175	10183	9710	9710	I	0	" for he had none ; or his "
10186	10305	9710	9710	I	0	" which , if he had any , she did not know of . Alas ! to practical and prudent people I can offer no excuse for her ; except , perhaps what Shakspeare gives in the creation of the poor Miranda . When the small servant re - entered the kitchen , Hilary , with a half sigh , shook off her dreams , called Ascott out of the school - room , and returned to the work - a - day world and the family supper . This being ended , seasoned with a few quiet words administered to Ascott , and which on the whole he took pretty well , it was nearly ten o'clock . "
10326	10414	10319	10319	we	577	" said Miss Leaf , taking down the large Bible with which she was accustomed to conclude the day — Ascott 's early hours at school and their own house - work making it difficult of mornings . Very brief the reading was , sometimes not more than half a dozen verses , with no comment thereon ; she thought the Word of God might safely be left to expound itself Being a very humble - minded woman , she did not feel qualified to lead long devotional "
10417	10478	10319	10319	we	577	" and she disliked formal written prayers . So she merely read the Bible to the family , and said after it the Lord 's Prayer . But , constitutionally shy as Miss Leaf was to do even this in presence of a stranger cost her some effort ; and it was only a sense of duty that made her say "
10480	10486	10487	10487	I	0	" to Hilary 's suggestion , "
10496	10500	10494	10494	Elizabeth	94	" Elizabeth came . "
10504	10578	10494	10494	Elizabeth	94	" said her mistress : and she sat down , staring uneasily round about her , as if wondering what was going to befall her next . Very silent was the little parlor ; so small , that it was almost filled up by its large square piano , its six cane - bottomed chairs , and one easy chair , in which sat Miss Leaf with the great Book in her lap . "
10585	10586	10583	10583	Elizabeth	94	" "
10591	10592	10583	10583	Elizabeth	94	" "
10600	10646	10593	10593	Hilary	91	" And so Elizabeth followed , guided by her not too clean finger , the words , read in that soft , low voice , somewhere out of the New Testament ; words simple enough for the comprehension of a child or a heathen . The "
10651	10744	10593	10593	Hilary	91	" as Ascott persisted in calling her , then , doing as the family did , turned round to kneel down ; but in her confusion she knocked over a chair , causing Miss Leaf to wait a minute till reverent silence was restored . Elizabeth knelt , with her eyes fixed on the wall : it was a green paper , patterned with bunches of nuts . How far she listened , or how much she understood , it was impossible to say ; but her manner was decent and decorous . "
10758	10795	10593	10593	Hilary	91	" Unconsciously Miss Leaf 's gentle voice rested on these words , so needed in the daily life of every human being , and especially of every family . Was she the only one who thought of "
10799	10817	10797	10797	Selina	92	" They all rose from their knees , and Hilary out the Bible away . The little servant "
10821	10845	10797	10797	Selina	92	" apparently uncertain what was next to be done , or what was expected of her to do . Hilary touched her sister . "
10848	10862	10797	10797	Selina	92	" said Miss Leaf . recollecting herself , and assuming the due authority , "
10892	10912	10915	10915	ma'am	3015	" This was addressed to the new maiden , who dropped a courtesy , and said , almost cheerfully , "
10917	10918	10915	10915	ma'am	3015	" "
10927	10947	10925	10925	Elizabeth	94	" And following Miss Leaf 's example , the other two , even Ascott , said civilly and kindly , "
10953	11244	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	" The Christmas holidays ended , and Ascott left for London . It was the greatest household change the Misses Leaf had known for years , and they missed him sorely . Ascott was not exactly a lovable boy , and yet , after the fashion of womankind , his aunts were both fond and proud of him ; fond , in their childless old maidenhood , of any sort of nephew , and proud , unconsciously , that the said nephew was a big fellow , who could look over all their heads , besides being handsome and pleasant mannered , and though not clever enough to set the Thames on fire , still sufficiently bright to make them hope that in his future the family star might again rise . There was something pathetic in these three women 's idealization of him — even Selina 's who though quarrelling with him to his face always praised him behind his back,—that great , good - looking , lazy lad ; who , every body else saw clearly enough , thought more of his own noble self than of all his aunts put together . The only person he stood in awe of was Mr. Lyon — for whom he always protested unbounded respect and admiration . How far Robert Lyon liked Ascott even Hilary could never quite find out ; but he was always very kind to him . There was one person in the house who , strange to say , did not succumb to the all - dominating youth . From the very first there was a smouldering feud between him and Elizabeth . Whether she overheard , and slowly began to comprehend his mocking gibes about the "
11249	11265	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	" or whether her sullen and dogged spirit resisted the first attempts the lad made to "
11268	11306	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	her"—as he did upon his aunts , in small daily tyrannies — was never found out ; but certainly Ascott , the general favorite , found little favor with the new servant . She never answered when he "
11308	11334	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	" for her ; she resisted blacking his boots more than once a day ; and she obstinately cleared the kitchen fire - place of his "
11337	11352	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	" as she ignominiously termed various pots and pans belonging to what he called his "
11356	11447	10951	10951	Elizabeth	94	" Although the war was passive rather than aggressive , and sometimes a source of private amusement to the aunts , still , on the whole , it was a relief when the exciting cause of it departed ; his new and most gentlemanly port manteau being carried down stairs by Elizabeth herself , of her own accord , with an air of cheerful alacrity , foreign to her mien for some weeks past , and which , even in the midst of the dolorous parting , amused Hilary extremely . "
11456	11463	11453	11454	a character	583	" she said afterward to Johanna . "
11474	11475	11466	11466	she	582	" "
11494	11495	11497	11497	she	582	" "
11548	11549	11529	11529	one	585	" "
11559	11590	11529	11529	one	585	" sighed Johanna , looking fondly at the bright face and light little figure that was flitting about putting the school - room to rights before the pupils came in . "
11613	11693	11606	11611	a whit less charming and lovely	588	" She often applied these adjectives to herself , with the most perfect conviction that she was uttering a fiction patent to every body . I must be very juvenile also , for I 'm certain the fellow - passenger at the station to - day took me for Ascott 's sweetheart . When we were saying good by an old gentleman who sat next him was particularly sympathetic , and you should have seen how indignantly Ascott replied , "
11700	11727	11606	11611	a whit less charming and lovely	588	" Miss Leaf laughed , and the shadow vanished from her face , as Hilary had meant it should . She only said , caressing her , "
11747	11748	11736	11736	I	0	" "
11760	12286	11758	11758	Johanna	93	" But now was heard the knock after knock of the little boys and girls , and there began that monotonous daily round of school labor , rising from the simplicities of c , a , t , cat , and d , o , g , dog — to the sublime heights of Pinnock and Lennie , Telemaque and Latin Delectus . No loftier ; Stowbury being well supplied with first class schools , and having a vague impression that the Misses Leaf , born ladies and not brought up as governesses , were not competent educators except of very small children . Which was true enough until lately . So Miss Leaf kept contentedly to the c , a , t , cat , and d , o , g , dog , of the little butchers and bakers , as Miss Selina , who taught only sewing , and came into the school - room but little during the day , scornfully termed them . The higher branches such as they were , she left gradually to Hilary , who , of late , possibly out of sympathy with a friend of hers , had begun to show an actual gift for teaching school . It is a gift — all will allow ; and chiefly those who have it not , among which was poor Johanna Leaf . The admiring envy with which she watched Hilary , moving briskly about from class to class , with a word of praise to one and rebuke to another , keeping every one 's attention alive , spurring on the dull , controlling the unruly , and exercising over every member in this little world that influence , at once the strongest and most intangible and inexplicable — personal influence — was only equaled by the way in which , at pauses in the day 's work , when it grew dull and monotonous or when the stupidity of the children ruffled her own quick temper beyond endurance , Hilary watched Johanna . The time I am telling of now is long ago . The Stowbury children , who were then little boys and girls , are now fathers and mothers — doubtless a large proportion being decent tradesfolk in Stowbury still ; though , in this locomotive quarter , many must have drifted elsewhere — where , Heaven knows . But not a few of them may still call to mind Miss Leaf , who first taught them their letters — sitting in her corner between the fire and the window , while the blind was drawn down to keep out , first the light from her own fading eyes , and , secondly , the distracting view of green fields and trees from the youthful eyes by her side . They may remember still her dark plain dress and her white apron , on which the primers , torn and dirty , looked half ashamed to lie ; and above all , her sweet face and sweeter voice , never heard in any thing sharper than that grieved tone which signified their being "
12290	12369	11758	11758	Johanna	93	" They may recall her unwearied patience with the very dullest and most wayward of them ; her unfailing sympathy with every infantile pleasure and pain . And I think they will acknowledge that whether she taught them much or little — in this advancing age it might be thought little — Miss Leaf taught them one thing — to love her . Which , as Ben Johnson said of the Countess of Pembroke , was in itself a "
12373	12623	12624	12624	I	0	" Hilary , too . Often when Hilary 's younger and more restless spirit chafed against the monotony of her life ; when , instead of wasting her days in teaching small children , she would have liked to be learning , learning — every day growing wiser and cleverer , and stretching out into that busy , bright , active world of which Robert Lyon had told her — then the sight of Johanna 's meek face bent over those dirty spelling books would at once rebuke and comfort her . She felt , after all , that she would not mind working on forever , so long as Johanna still sat there . Nevertheless , that winter seemed to her very long — especially after Ascott was gone . For Johanna , partly for money , and partly for kindness , had added to her day 's work four evenings a week when a half educated mother of one of her little pupils came to be taught to write a decent hand , and to keep the accounts of her shop . Upon which Selina , highly indignant , had taken to spending her evenings in the school room , interrupting Hilary 's solitary studies there by many a lamentation over the peaceful days when they all sat in the kitchen together and kept no servant . For Selina was one of those who never saw the bright side of any thing till it had gone by . "
12642	12643	12652	12652	I	0	" "
12647	12651	12652	12652	I	0	" suggested Hilary . "
12681	12682	12683	12683	She	594	" "
12694	12695	12696	12696	Hilary	91	" "
12712	12713	12704	12704	I	0	" "
12730	12731	12732	12732	You	91	" "

12803	12891	12892	12893	Black Janira	122	" Selina was too vexed to reply and for five quiet minutes Hilary bent over her Homer which Mr. Lyon had taken such pleasure in teaching her , because he said , she learned it faster than any of his grammar school boys . She had forgotten all domestic grievances in a vision of Thetis and the water nymphs ; and was repeating to herself , first in the sonorous Greek and then in Pope 's small but sweet English , that catalogue of oceanic beauties ending with "
12905	12906	12907	12907	Black	122	" "
12932	12933	12934	12934	Her	124	" "
12944	12945	12939	12939	Elizabeth	94	" "
12987	12988	12973	12973	she	124	" "
12996	12997	12973	12973	she	124	" "

13129	13130	13120	13120	You	0	" "
13151	13163	13165	13165	you	0	" Another pause — and then Selina returned to the charge . "
13208	13209	13189	13189	She	124	" "
13259	13296	13223	13223	Selina	92	" And Hilary , in despair , rose to carry her candle and books into the chilly but quiet bedroom , biting her lips the while lest she should be tempted to say something which Selina called "
13299	13401	13223	13223	Selina	92	" which perhaps it was , from a younger sister to an elder . I do not set Hilary up as a perfect character . Through sorrow only do people go on to perfection ; and sorrow , in its true meaning , the cherished girl had never known . But that night , talking to Johanna before they went to sleep — they had always slept together since the time when the elder sister used to walk the room of nights with that pulling , motherless infant in her arms — Hilary anxiously started the question of the little servant . "
13517	13518	13511	13511	she	307	" "
13528	13542	13525	13525	you	0	" asked Johanna , in unconscious appeal to her pet 's stronger judgment . "
13580	13581	13572	13572	She	307	" "
13592	13604	13610	13616	any one whom you took pain with	618	" added the conscientious elder sister , still afraid of making the "
13606	13609	13620	13620	you	0	" vain , "
13645	13646	13640	13640	we	619	" "
13705	13706	13693	13694	a thief	622	" "
13713	13721	13693	13694	a thief	622	" said Johanna , with a shiver . "
13805	13831	13803	13803	we	619	" The number was few . Nothing in the Leaf family was ever cast off till its very last extremity of decay ; the talent that "
13842	13866	13915	13915	Hilary	91	" being specially possessed by Hilary . She counted over her own wardrobe and Johanna 's but found nothing that could be spared . "
13933	14112	13925	13925	you	630	" Hilary laughed , and replied not . Now it might be a pathetic indication of a girl who had very few clothes , but Hilary had a superstitious weakness concerning hers.—Every dress had its own peculiar chronicle of the scenes where it had been , the enjoyments she had shared in it . Particular dresses were special memorials of her loves , her pleasures , her little passing pains ; as long as a bit remained of the poor old fabric the sight of it recalled them all . This brown merino — in which she had sat two whole winters over her Greek and Latin by Robert Lyon 's side , which he had once stopped to touch and notice , saying what a pretty color it was , and how he liked soft - feeling dresses for women — to cut up this old brown merino seemed to hurt her so she could almost have cried . Yet what would Johanna think if the refused ? And there was Elizabeth absolutely in want of clothes . "
14120	14218	14113	14113	I	0	" thought poor Hilary . She lay a good while silent in the dark , while Johanna planned and replanned — calculating how , even with the addition of an old cape of her own , which was out of the same piece , this hapless gown could be made to fit the gaunt frame of Elizabeth Hand.—Her poor kindly brain was in the last extremity of muddle , when Hilary , with a desperate effort , dashed in to the rescue , and soon made all clear , contriving body , skirt , sleeves and all . "
14242	14243	14236	14236	I	0	" "
14265	14474	14263	14263	Johanna	93	" I misdoubt many will say I am writing about small , ridiculously small , things . Yet is not the whole of life made up of infinitesimally small things ? And in its strange and solemn mosaic , the full pattern of which we never see clearly till looking back on it from far away , dare we say of any thing which the hand of Eternal Wisdom has put together , that it is too common or too small ? While her anxious mistresses were thus talking her over the servant lay on her humble bed and slept . They knew she did , for they heard her heavy breathing through the thin partition wall . Whether , as Hilary suggested , she was too ignorant to notice the days of the week , or month , or , as Selina thought , too stupid to care for any thing beyond eating , drinking , and sleeping . Elizabeth manifested no anxiety about herself or her destiny . She went about her work just as usual ; a little quicker and readier , now she was becoming familiarized to it ; but she said nothing . She was undoubtedly a girl of silent and undemonstrative nature . "
14481	14486	14263	14263	Johanna	93	" said Miss Hilary . "
14496	14500	14503	14503	you	633	" replied Johanna . "
14513	14628	14503	14503	you	633	" Hilary did not know . She was sitting , rather more tired than usual , by the school - room fire , the little people having just departed for their Saturday half - holiday . Before clearing off the debris which they always left behind , she stood a minute at the window , refreshing her eyes with the green field opposite , and the far - away wood , crowned by a dim white monument , visible in fair weather , on which those bright brown eyes had a trick of lingering , even in the middle of school hours . For the wood and the hill beyond belonged to a nobleman 's "
14630	14759	14763	14763	Johanna	93	" estate , five miles off — the only bit of real landscape beauty that Hilary had ever beheld . There , during the last holidays but one , she , her sisters , her nephew , and , by his own special request , Mr. Lyon , had spent a whole long , merry , midsummer day . She wondered whether such a day would ever come again ! But spring was coming again , any how ; the field looked smiling and green , specked here and there with white dots which , she opined . might possibly be daisies . She half wished she was not too old and dignified to dart across the road , leap the sunk fence , and run to see . "
14772	14802	14763	14763	Johanna	93	" For at this instant somebody came tearing down the stairs , opened the front door , and did — exactly what Hilary had just been wishing to do . "
14837	14889	14891	14891	her	94	" But loud screams from Selina 's room , the front , one , where she had been lying in bed all morning , quite obliterated the little servant from their minds . The two sisters ran hastily up stairs . Selina was sitting up , in undisguised terror and agitation . "
14918	14919	14909	14909	she	94	" "
14934	14976	14977	14977	She	94	" But it was some time before they could make out any thing . At last they gathered that Elizabeth had been waiting upon Miss Selina , putting vinegar cloths on her head , and doing various things about the room . "
14986	14991	14977	14977	She	94	" even Selina allowed . "
15088	15089	15083	15083	my	0	" "
15102	15103	15105	15105	she	94	" "
15182	15247	15173	15173	she	94	" And Selina broke out into piteous complainings . Her elder sister soothed her as well as she could , while Hilary ran down to the front door and looked , and enquired every where for Elizabeth . She was not to be seen on field or road ; and along that quiet terrace not a soul had even perceived her quit the house . "
15255	15261	15173	15173	she	94	" said Hilary , returning . "
15282	15283	15277	15277	you	641	" "
15339	15403	15334	15334	I	0	" When Selina took this tack , of course her sisters were silenced . They quited her a little , and then went down and searched the house all over . All was in order ; at least in as much order as was to be expected the hour before dinner . The bowl of half - peeled potatoes stood on the back kitchen "
15406	15430	15334	15334	I	0	" the roast was down before the fire ; the knives were ready for cleaning . Evidently Elizabeth flight had not been premeditated . "
15450	15463	15440	15440	She	644	" said Hilary to Johanna , who began to look seriously uneasy . "
15518	15519	15498	15498	she	644	" "
15522	15528	15498	15498	she	644	" said Johanna , mournfully , "
15538	15539	15534	15534	she	644	" "
15551	15555	15556	15556	She	644	" pleaded Hilary . "
15567	15638	15556	15556	She	644	" But she was not , nor even in two or three hours . Her mistresses ' annoyance became displeasure , and that again subsided into serious apprehension . Even Selina ceased talking over and over the incident which gave the sole information to be arrived at ; rose , dressed , and came down to the kitchen . There , after long and anxious consultation , Hilary , observing that "
15645	15686	15639	15639	Somebody	3240	" began to prepare the dinner as in pre - Elizabethan days ; but the three ladies ' appetites were small . About three in the afternoon , Hilary , giving utterance to the hidden alarm of all , said — "
15707	15810	15703	15704	Mrs. Hand	90	" This agreed , she stood consulting with Johanna as to what could possibly be said to the mother in case that unfortunate child had not gone home , when the kitchen door opened , and the culprit appeared . Not , however , with the least look of a culprit . Hot she was , and breathless ; and with her hair down about her ears , and her apron rolled up round her waist , presented a most forlorn and untidy aspect ; but her eyes were bright , and her countenance glowing . She took a towel from under her arm.—"There
15830	15848	15849	15849	Elizabeth	94	" Having blurted out this , she leaned against the wall , trying to recover her breath . "
15883	15905	15877	15877	you	94	" ( When , for remissness in reproving others , the elder sister herself fell under reproof , it was always emphatically "
15907	15908	15869	15869	I	0	sister—"your nephew"—"your
15911	15955	15956	15956	I	0	" ) But , for once , Miss Selina 's sharp voice failed to bring the customary sullen look to Elizabeth 's face , and when Miss Leaf , in her milder tones , asked where she had been , she answered unhesitatingly — "
15963	15964	15956	15956	I	0	" "
15969	15981	15956	15956	I	0	" the three ladies cried , in one chorus of astonishment . "
16022	16023	16024	16024	He	653	" "
16032	16033	16030	16030	he	653	" "
16097	16144	16082	16082	he	653	" While Elizabeth spoke so incoherently , and with such unwonted energy and excitement , Johanna looked as if she thought her sister 's fears were true , and the girl had really gone mad ; but Hilary 's quicker perceptions jumped at a different conclusion . "
16150	16239	16146	16146	yourself	92	" said she , taking a firm hold of her shoulder , and making her sit down , when the rolled - up apron dropped , and showed itself all covered with blood spots . Selina screamed outright . Then Elizabeth seemed to become half conscious that she had done something blamable , or was at least a suspected character . Her warmth of manner faded ; the sullen cloud of dogged resistance to authority was rising in her poor dirty face , when Hilary , beginning with , "
16259	16516	16251	16251	we	658	" contrived by adroit questions , and not a few of them , to elicit the whole story . It appeared that , while standing at Miss Selina 's window , Elizabeth had watched three little boys , apparently engaged in a very favorite amusement of little boys in that field , going quickly behind a horse , and pulling out the longest and handsomest hairs in his tail to make fishing lines of . She saw the animal give a kick , and two of the boys ran away ; the other did not stir . For a minute or so she noticed a black lump lying in the grass ; then , with the quick instinct for which nobody had ever given her credit , she guessed what had happened , and did immediately the wisest and only thing possible under the circumstances , namely , to snatch up a towel , run across the field , bind up the child 's head as well as she could , and carry it , bleeding and insensible , to the nearest doctor , who lived nearly a mile off . She did not tell — and they only found it out afterward — how she had held the boy while under the doctor 's hands , the skull being so badly fractured that the frightened mother fainted at the sight ; how she had finally carried him home , and left him comfortably settled in bed , his senses returned , and his life saved . "
16527	16539	16251	16251	we	658	" she said , in answer to Miss Leaf 's questions . "
16579	16630	16575	16575	he	659	" Here , just for a second or two , the color left the big girl 's lips , and she trembled a little . Miss Leaf went to the kitchen cupboard , and took out their only bottle of wine — administered in rare doses , exclusively as medicine . "
16659	16677	16648	16648	We	661	" Elizabeth looked up with a long , wistfull stare of intense surprise , and then added , "
16687	16688	16689	16689	I	0	" "
16706	16751	16704	16704	child	3052	" She was obeyed . By - and - by Elizabeth disappeared into the back kitchen , emerged thence with a clean face , hands , and apron ; and went about her afternoon business as if nothing had happened . Her mistresses ' threatened "
16753	16849	16704	16704	child	3052	" with her never came about . What , indeed , could they say ? No doubt the little servant had broken the strict letter of domestic law by running off in that highly eccentric and inconvenient way ; but , as Hilary tried to explain by a series of most ingenious ratiocinations , she had fulfilled , in the spirit of it , the very highest law — that of charity . She had also shown prompt courage , decision , practical and prudent forethought , and above all , entire self - forgetfulness . "
16857	16867	16704	16704	child	3052	" said Miss Hilary , warming with her subject , "
16882	16883	16704	16704	child	3052	" "
16903	16904	16905	16905	I	0	" "
17003	17017	16996	16996	My	0	" This settled the matter , since it was a curious fact that the "
17019	17100	16996	16996	My	0	" of the youngest Miss Leaf was , whether they knew it or not , almost equivalent to a family ukase . When Elizabeth had brought in the tea - things , which she did with especial care , apparently wishing to blot out the memory of the morning 's escapade by astonishingly good behavior for the rest of the day , Miss Leaf called her , and asked if she knew that her month of trial ended this day ? "
17105	17142	16996	16996	My	0	" with the strict normal courtesy , something between that of the old - world family domestic — as her mother might have been to the Miss Elizabeth Something she was named after — and the abrupt "
17144	17162	16996	16996	My	0	" of the modern National school girl ; which constituted Elizabeth Hand 's sole experience of manners . "
17220	17221	17352	17352	she	3017	" "
17224	17324	17352	17352	she	3017	" said Elizabeth , inquiringly . Miss Leaf hesitated , and looked uneasily at her two sisters . It was always a trial to her shy nature to find herself the mouth - piece of the family ; and this same shyness made it still more difficult to break through the stiff barriers which seemed to rise up between her , a gentlewoman well on in years , and this coarse working girl . She felt , as she often complained , that with the - kindest intentions , she did not quite know how to talk to Elizabeth . "
17329	17333	17352	17352	she	3017	" said Hilary , "
17405	17406	17401	17401	You	680	" "
17412	17413	17409	17410	Miss Hilary	91	" "
17423	17438	17415	17415	we	676	Nay"—feeling in spite of Selina 's warning nudge , that she had hardly been kind enough—"we
17473	17474	17476	17476	you	680	" "
17491	17508	17487	17487	I	0	" She said no more — but sighed a great sigh , as if her mind were relieved—("So
17510	17514	17515	17515	she	683	" thought Hilary , "
17524	17531	17515	17515	she	683	imagined")—and bustled back into her kitchen . "
17539	17554	17515	17515	she	683	" observed Miss Leaf , also looking much relieved that the decision was over . "
17585	17715	17716	17716	Dear	685	" Hilary went without a word . People who inhabit the same house , eat , sit , and sleep together — loving one another and sympathizing with one another , ever so deeply and dearly — nevertheless inevitably have momentary seasons when the intense solitude in which we all live , and must expect ever to live , at the depth of our being , forces itself painfully upon the heart . Johanna must have had many such seasons when Hilary was a child ; Hilary had one now . She unfolded the old frock , and took out of its pocket , a hiding place at once little likely to be searched , and harmless if discovered , a poor little memento of that happy midsummer day . "
17736	17814	17733	17734	Robert Lyon	98	" The only scrap of note she had ever received ; he always wrote to Johanna ; as regularly as ever , or more so , now Ascott was gone ; but only to Johanna . She read over the two lines , wondered where she should keep them now that Johanna might not notice them ; and then recoiled , as if the secret were a wrong to that dear sister who loved her so well . "
17850	17910	17827	17827	She	91	" And the aching , aching want which sometimes came over began again . Let us not blame her . God made all our human needs . God made love . Not merely affection but actual love — the necessity to seek and find out some other being , not another but the complement of one 's self — the "
17914	18083	17827	17827	She	91	" who brings rest and strength for weakness , sympathy in aspiration , and tenderness for tenderness , as no other person ever can . Perhaps , even in marriage , this love is seldom found , and it is possible in all lives to do without it . Johanna had done so . But then she had been young , and was now growing old ; and Hilary was only twenty , with a long life before her . Poor child , let us not blame her ! She was not in the least sentimental , her natural disposition inclining her to be more than cheerful , actually gay . She soon recovered herself , and when , a short time after , she stood , scissors in hand , demonstrating how very easy it was to make something out of nothing , her sisters never suspected how very near tears had lately been to those bright eyes , which were always the sunshine of the house . "
18093	18097	18084	18084	You	686	" said Selina . "
18123	18124	18125	18125	My	0	" "
18190	18191	18179	18179	I	0	" "
18194	18208	18179	18179	I	0	" put in the eldest sister , afraid of a collision of words , "
18229	18230	18226	18226	she	94	" "
18297	18431	18432	18432	I	0	" But Fate stood in the way of Miss Hilary 's good intentions . She found Elizabeth not as was her wo nt , always busy , over the perpetual toil of those who have not yet learned the mysterious art of arrangement and order , nor , as sometimes , hanging sleepily over the kitchen fire , waiting for bedtime ; but actually sitting , sitting down at the table . Her candle was flaring on one side of her ; on the other was the school room inkstand , a scrap of waste paper , and a pen But she was not writing ; she sat with her head on her hands , in an attitude of disconsolate idleness , so absorbed that she seemed not to hear Hilary 's approach . "
18442	18443	18440	18440	Elizabeth	94	" "
18449	18461	18440	18440	Elizabeth	94	" was the answer , in the most doleful of voices . "
18480	18481	18440	18440	Elizabeth	94	" "
18488	18528	18440	18440	Elizabeth	94	" And Hilary tried to contemplate gravely the scrawled and blotted page , which looked very much as if a large spider had walked into the ink bottle , and then walked out again on a tour of investigation . "
18536	18546	18531	18531	you	0	" asked she , suddenly . Elizabeth blushed violently . "
18613	18614	18604	18605	Miss Selina	92	" "
18622	18636	18604	18605	Miss Selina	92	" for there was a sort of choke in the girl 's voice . "
18665	18690	18661	18661	I	0	" Utter amazement , beaming gratitude , succeeded one another , plain as light , in Elizabeth 's eyes , but she only said , "
18697	18698	18694	18695	Miss Hilary	91	" "
18746	18834	18840	18840	you	91	" In a state of nervous trepidation , pitiful to behold , Elizabeth took the pen . Terrible scratches resulted ; blots innumerable ; and one fatal deluge of ink , which startled from their seats both mistress and maid , and made Hilary thankful that she had taken off her better gown for a common one , as , with sad thriftiness , the Misses Leaf always did of evenings . When Elizabeth saw the mischief she had done , her contrition and humility were unbounded . "
18859	18860	18853	18853	I	0	" "
18863	19005	18853	18853	I	0	" And the bright active little lady looked steadily into the heavy face of this undeveloped girl , half child , half woman , until some of her own spirit seemed to be reflected there . Whether the excitement of the morning had roused her , or her mistresses ' kindness had touched Elizabeth 's heart , and — as in most women — the heart was the key to the intellect ; or whether the gradual daily influence of her changed life during the last month had been taking effect , now for the first time to appear — certain it is that Hilary had never perceived before what an extremely intelligent face it was ; what good sense was indicated in the well shaped head and forehead ; what tenderness and feeling in the deep - set grey eyes . "
19008	19012	18853	18853	I	0	" repeated she . "
19058	19072	19047	19047	I	0	" She highly amused her sisters with a description of what she called her "
19078	19221	19047	19047	I	0	" returned , and set to work to guide the rough , coarse hand through the mysteries of calligraphy . To say this was an easy task would not be true . Nature 's own laws and limits make the using of faculties which have been unused for generations very difficult at first . To suppose that a working man , the son of working men , who applies himself to study , does it with as little trouble as your upper - class children , who have been unconsciously undergoing education ever since the cradle , is a great mistake . All honor , therefore , to those who do attempt , and to ever so small a degree succeed in , the best and wisest culture of all , self - culture . Of this honor Elizabeth deserved her share . "
19227	19237	19222	19222	She	702	" Hilary confessed , after the lesson was over ; "
19318	19319	19320	19320	I	0	" "
19331	19342	19343	19343	I	0	" said Selina , breaking into the conversation rather crossly . "
19386	19387	19343	19343	I	0	" "
19394	19400	19343	19343	I	0	" answered Hilary , meditatively . "
19449	19461	19463	19463	her	94	" Ay , in those days when , trying so hard to "
19466	19538	19463	19463	her	94	" and make herself a little more equal and companionable to another mind she knew , she had , after her daily house cares and her six hours of school teaching , attempted at nine P. M. to begin close study on her own account . And though with her strong will she succeeded tolerably , still , as she told Johanna , she could well understand how slow was the , "
19542	19598	19463	19463	her	94	" ( a phrase which had just then come up ) among day laborers and the like ; and how difficult it was for these Mechanics Institutions , which were now talked so much of , to put any new ideas into the poor tired heads , rendered sluggish and stupid with hard bodily labor , "
19611	19653	19600	19600	I	0	" and she looked inquiringly at her sisters , especially Johanna . Now the Misses Leaf were old fashioned country folk , who lived before the words Sabbatarian and un - Sabbatarian had ever got into the English language . They simply "
19663	19840	19600	19600	I	0	" they arranged so as to make it for all the household a day of rest : and they went regularly to church once — sometimes Selina and Hilary went twice . For the intervening hours , their usual custom was to take an afternoon walk in the fields ; begun chiefly for Ascott 's sake , to keep the lad out of mischief , and put into his mind better thoughts than he was likely to get from his favorite Sunday recreation of sitting on the wall throwing stones . After he left for London there was Elizabeth to be thought of ; and they decided that the best Sabbath duty for the little servant was to go and see her mother . So they gave her every Sunday afternoon free ; only requiring that she should be at home punctually after church time , at eight o'clock . But from thence till bedtime was a blank two hours , which , Hilary had noticed , Elizabeth not infrequently spent in dozing over the fire . "
19845	19859	19600	19600	I	0	" said she , giving the end of her long meditation out loud , "
19882	20033	19877	19877	you	0	" Johanna , simple , God - fearing woman as she was , to whom faith and love came as natural as the breath she drew , had never perplexed herself with the question . She only smiled acquiescence . But Selina was greatly shocked . Teaching to write on a Sunday ! Bringing the week day work into the day of rest ! Doing one 's own pleasure on the holy day ! She thought it exceedingly wrong . Such a thing had never been heard of in their house . Whatever else might be said of them , the Leafs were always a respectable family as to keeping Sunday . Nobody could say that even poor Henry — But here Selina 's torrent of words stopped . When conversation revived , Hilary , who had been at first half annoyed and half amused , resumed her point seriously . "
20141	20142	20143	20143	She	94	" "
20155	20156	20159	20159	she	94	" "
20244	20245	20248	20248	child	3052	" "
20250	20304	20305	20305	I	0	" said Johanna , reprovingly ; for Hilary 's cheeks were red , and her voice angry . She was taking the hot , youthful part which in its hatred of forms and shams , sometimes leads — and not seldom led poor Hilary — a little too far on the other side . "
20308	20313	20305	20305	I	0	" Miss Leaf added , "
20381	20402	20360	20360	Paul	130	" Hilary looked in her sister 's sweet , calm face , and the anger died out of her own . "
20410	20416	20419	20420	my love	630	" she said , softly . "
20462	20463	20464	20464	You	630	" "
20471	20477	20464	20464	You	630	" said Selina , sullenly . "
20484	20485	20478	20478	She	719	" "
20491	20620	20487	20487	I	0	" Hilary could not tell how far she succeeded in simplifying to the young servant 's comprehension this great question , involving so many points — such as the following of the spirit and the letter , the law of duty and the compulsion of love , which , as she spoke , seemed opening out so widely and awfully that she herself involuntarily shrank from it , and wondered that poor finite creatures should , ever presume to squabble about it at all . But one thing the girl did understand — her young mistress 's kindness . She stood watching the delicate little hand that had so patiently guided hers , and now wrote copy after copy for her future benefit . At last she said — "
20646	20660	20668	20669	a lady	723	" Miss Hilary was puzzled what answer to make . True enough it was "
20663	20667	20668	20669	a lady	723	" and she was "
20671	20777	20668	20669	a lady	723	" and between her and Mrs. Hand 's rough daughter was an unmistakable difference and distinction . That Elizabeth perceived it was proved by her growing respectfulness of manner — the more respectful , it seemed , the more she herself improved . Yet Hilary could not bear to make her feel more sharply than was unavoidable the great gulf that lies and ever must lie — not so much between mistress and servant , in their abstract relation—(and yet that is right , for the relation and authority are ordained of God)—but between the educated and the ignorant , the coarse and the refined . "
20780	20790	20791	20791	you	630	" she said , after a pause of consideration , "
20836	20857	20831	20831	I	0	" Elizabeth smiled — that wonderfully bright , sudden smile which seemed to cover over all her plainness of feature . "
20863	20872	20831	20831	I	0	" Hilary resumed by - and - by , "
20988	21031	20983	20983	we	729	" Here Hilary stopped , recollecting she must be discoursing miles above the head of her little bower - maiden , and that , perhaps , after all , her theory would be best kept to herself , and only demonstrated practically . "
21060	21061	21062	21062	I	0	" "
21079	21096	21069	21070	Miss Hilary	91	" was the answer , given with a smothered intensity that quite startled the young mistress . "
21108	21120	21100	21101	the girl	307	" said she , half touched , half laughing to Johanna . "
21174	21313	21170	21170	she	94	" Johanna smiled ; but she would not for the world have said — never encouraging the smallest vanity in her child — that she did not think this circumstance so very remarkable . A household exclusively composed of women has its advantages and its disadvantages . It is apt to become somewhat narrow in judgment , morbid in feeling , absorbed in petty interests , and bounding its vision of outside things to the small horizon which it sees from its own fireside . But , on the other hand , by this fireside often abides a settled peace and purity , a long - suffering , generous forbearance , and an enduring affectionateness which the other sex can hardly comprehend or credit . Men will not believe , what is nevertheless the truth , that we can "
21316	21523	21170	21170	she	94	" better than they can ; that we can do without them far easier , and with less deterioration of character , than they can do without us ; that we are better able to provide for ourselves interests , duties , and pleasures ; in short , strange as it may appear , that we have more real self - sustaining independence than they . Of course , that the true life , the highest life , is that of man and woman united , no one will be insane enough to deny ; I am speaking of the substitute for it , which poor humanity has so often to fall back upon and make the best of — a better best very frequently than what appears best in the eyes of the world . In truth , many a troubled , care ridden , wealthy family , torn with dissensions , or frozen up in splendid formalities , might have envied that quiet , humble , maiden household of the Misses Leaf , where their only trial was poverty , and their only grief the one which they knew the worst of , and had met patiently for many a year — poor Selina 's "
21526	21615	21618	21619	the family	258	" I doubt not it was good for Elizabeth Hand that her first place — the home in which she received her first impressions — was this feminine establishment , simple and regular , in which was neither waste nor disorder allowed . Good , too , that while her mistresses ' narrow means restricted her in many things enjoyed by servants in richer families , their interests , equally narrow , caused to be concentrated upon herself a double measure of thought and care . She became absolutely "
21621	21670	21618	21619	the family	258	" sharing in all its concerns . From its small and few carnal luxuries — such as the cake , fruit , or pot of preserve , votive offerings from pupils ' parents — up to the newspaper and the borrowed book , nothing was either literally or metaphorically "
21672	21724	21618	21619	the family	258	" up from Elizabeth . This grand question of locking up had been discussed in full conclave the day after her month of preparation ended , the sisters taking opposite sides , as might have been expected . Selina was for the immediate introduction of a locksmith and a key basket . "
21784	21785	21773	21773	she	737	" "
21800	21801	21803	21804	a servant	246	" "
21813	21814	21808	21808	you	743	" "
21841	21842	21825	21825	I	0	" "
21857	21863	21855	21855	Miss	747	" said Selina , crossly . "
21909	21910	21911	21914	A girl of fifteen	749	" "
21979	21980	21988	21988	you	743	" "
22005	22006	22007	22007	I	0	" "
22010	22025	22007	22007	I	0	" replied the elder sister , taking no notice of the long familiar innuendo , "
22100	22128	22066	22067	the girl	307	" But Elizabeth did not go . A year passed ; two years ; her wages were raised , and with them her domestic position . From a "
22130	22244	22066	22067	the girl	307	" she was converted into a regular servant ; her pinafores gave place to grown - up gowns and aprons ; and her rough head , at Miss Selina 's incessant instance , was concealed by a cap — caps being considered by that lady as the proper and indispensable badge of servant - hood . To say that during her transition state , or even now that she had reached the cap era , Elizabeth gave her mistresses no trouble , would be stating a self - evident improbability . What young lass under seventeen , of any rank , does not cause plenty of trouble to her natural guardians ? Who can "
22253	22367	22066	22067	the girl	307	" or expect from girls at the most unformed and unsatisfactory period of life that complete moral and mental discipline , that unfailing self - control , that perfection of temper , and every thing else which , of course , all mistresses always have ? I am obliged to confess that Elizabeth had a few — nay , not a few — most obstinate faults ; that no child tries its parents , no pupil its school teachers , more than she tried her three mistresses at intervals . She was often thoughtless and careless , brusque in her manner , slovenly , in her dress ; sometimes she was down - right "
22370	22434	22066	22067	the girl	307	" filled full — as some of her elders and betters are , at all ages — with absolute naughtiness ; when she would sulk for hours and days together , and make the whole family uncomfortable , as many a servant can make many a family small as that of the Misses Leaf . But still they never lost what Hilary termed their "
22436	22831	22066	22067	the girl	307	" for Elizabeth ; they never found her out in a lie , a meanness , or an act of deception or dishonesty . They took her faults as we must take the surface faults of all connected with us — patiently rather than resentfully , seeking to correct rather than to punish . And though there were difficult elements in the household , such as their being three mistresses to be obeyed the youngest mistress a thought too lax and the second one undoubtedly too severe , still no girl could live with these high - principled , much - enduring women without being impressed with two things which the serving class are slowest to understand — the dignity of poverty , and the beauty of that which is the only effectual law to bring out good and restrain evil — the law of loving - kindness . Two fracas , however , must be chronicled , for after both , the girl 's dismissal hung on a thread . The first was when Mrs. Cliffe , mother of Tommy Cliffe , who was nearly killed in the field , being discovered to be an ill sort of woman , and in the habit of borrowing from Elizabeth stray shillings , which were never returned , was forbidden the house , Elizabeth resented it so fiercely that she sulked for a whole week afterward . The other and still more dangerous crisis in Elizabeth 's destiny was when a volume of Scott 's novels , having been missing for some days , was found hidden in her bed , and she lying awake reading it was thus ignominiously discovered at eleven P. M. by Miss Selina , in consequence of the gleam of candle light from under her door . It was true neither of these errors were actual moral crimes . Hilary even roused a volley of sharp words upon herself by declaring they had their source in actual virtues ; that a girl who would stint herself of shillings , and hold resolutely to any liking she had , even if unworthy , had a creditable amount of both self - denial and fidelity in her disposition . Also that a tired out maid - of all - work , who was kept awake of nights by her ardent appreciation of the "
22838	22991	22066	22067	the girl	307	" must possess a degree of both intellectual and moral capacity which deserved cultivation rather than blame . And though this surreptitious pursuit of literature under difficulties could not of course be allowed , I grieve to say that Miss Hilary took every opportunity of not only giving the young servant books to read , but of talking to her about them . And also that a large proportion of these books were — to Miss Selina 's unmitigated horror — absolutely fiction ! stories , novels , even poetry — books that Hilary liked herself — books that had built up in her own passionate dream of life ; wherein all the women were faithful , tender , heroic , self - devoted ; and all the men were — something not unlike Robert Lyon . Did she do harm ? Was it ; as Selina and even Johanna said sometimes , "
22993	23133	23177	23177	She	757	" thus to put before Elizabeth a standard of ideal perfection , a Quixotic notion of life — life in its full purpose power , and beauty — such as otherwise never could have crossed the mind of this working girl , born of parents who , though respectable and worthy , were in no respect higher than the common working class ? I will not argue the point : I am not making Elizabeth a text for a sermon ; I am simply writing her story . One thing was certain , that by degrees the young woman 's faults lessened ; even that worst of them , the unmistakable bad temper , not aggressive , but obstinately sullen , which made her and Miss Selina sometimes not on speaking terms for a week together . But she simply "
23136	23176	23177	23177	She	757	" she never grumbled or was pert ; and she did her work just as usual — with a kind of dogged struggle not only against the superior powers but against something within herself much harder to fight with . "
23190	23220	23177	23177	She	757	" Miss Leaf would sometimes say , coming out of the kitchen with that grieved face , which was the chief sign of displeasure her sweet nature ever betrayed . "
23245	23611	23613	23613	she	760	" But gradually Elizabeth , too , copying involuntarily the rest of the family , learned to put up with Miss Selina ; who , on her part , kept a sort of armed neutrality . And once , when a short but sharp illness of Johanna 's shook the house from its even tenor , startled every body out of their little tempers , and made them cling together and work together in a sort of fear - stricken union against one common grief , Selina allowed that they might have gone farther and fared worse on the day they engaged Elizabeth . After this illness of his Aunt . Ascott came home . It was his first visit since he had gone to London : Mr. Ascott , he said , objected to holidays . But now , from some unexplained feeling , Johanna in her convalescence longed after the boy — no longer a boy , however , but nearly twenty , and looking fully his age . How proud his aunts were to march him up the town , and hear every body 's congratulations on his good looks and polished manners ! It was the old story — old as the hills ! I do not pretend to invent any thing new . Women , especially maiden aunts , will repeat the tale till the end of time , so long as they have youths belonging to them on whom to expend their natural tendency to clinging fondness , and ignorant , innocent hero worship . The Misses Leaf — ay , even Selina , whose irritation against the provoking boy was quite mollified by the elegant young man — were no wiser than their neighbors . But there was one person in the household who still obstinately refused to bow the knee to Ascott . Whether it was , as psychologists might explain , some instinctive polarity in their natures ; or whether , having once conceived a prejudice , Elizabeth held on to it like grim death ; still there was the same unspoken antagonism between them . The young fellow took little notice of her except to observe "
23682	23689	23697	23698	her mistress	431	" I canna bear to see him "
23691	23695	23697	23698	her mistress	431	" can not , "
23733	23795	23697	23698	her mistress	431	" I can not bear to see him , Miss Hilary , lolling on the arm - chair , when Missis looks so tired and pale , and sitting up o ' nights , burning double fires , and going up stairs at last with his boots on , and waking every body . I dunnot like it , I say . "
23796	23814	23697	23698	her mistress	431	" You forget ; Mr. Ascott has his studies . He must work for the next examination . "
23815	23867	23868	23868	Hilary	91	" Why does n't he get up of a morning then instead of lying in bed , and keeping the break - fast about till ten ? Why ca n't he do his learning by daylight ? Daylight 's cheaper than mould candles , and a deal better for the eyes . "
24002	24005	24059	24059	his	97	" slow , "
24051	24057	24059	24059	his	97	" a dear little prig , "
24122	24141	24115	24115	Ascott	97	" Now stop that , Aunt Hilary : I 'll not have you coming Mr. Lyon over me . "
24142	24148	24115	24115	Ascott	97	" What do you mean ? "
24185	24271	24166	24167	Mr. Lyon	98	" I mean that I 'll not be preached to like that by a woman . It 's bad enough to stand it from a man ; but then Lyon 's a real sharp fellow , who knows the world , which women do n't , Aunt Hilary . Besides , he coaches me in my Latin and Greek ; so I let him pitch into me now and then . But I wo n't let you ; so just stop it ; will you . "
24392	24401	24402	24402	she	779	" Do you go to see him often ? "
24408	24414	24402	24402	she	779	" Who ? Mr. Lyon ? "
24433	24568	24570	24572	the young fellow	3447	" Oh , bless you ! He would n't care for my going to him . He lives in a two - pair back , only one room , ' which serves him for kitchen and parlor and all : ' dines at a cook shop for nine - pence a day , and makes his own porridge night and morning . He told me so once , for he is n't a bit ashamed of it . But he must be precious hard up sometimes . However , as he contrives to keep a decent coat on his back , and pay his classes at the University , and carry off the very first honors going there , nobody asks any questions . That 's the good of London life , Aunt Hilary , "
24581	24599	24570	24572	the young fellow	3447	" Only look like a gentleman , behave yourself as such , and nobody asks any questions . "
24600	24603	24606	24607	Aunt Hilary	101	" Yes , "
24645	24652	24616	24624	the solitary student in the two - pair back	782	" nobody would ask any questions . "
24708	24712	24689	24689	he	782	" done pretty well "
24722	24728	24689	24689	he	782	" go in for more work "
24790	24804	24806	24806	her	101	" And I can not help him — I can not help him ! "
24971	24978	24945	24945	herself	101	" be it ever so humble , "
25112	25119	25103	25103	Elizabeth	94	" Is Miss Leaf at home ? "
25120	25125	25103	25103	Elizabeth	94	" No , Sir . "
25126	25137	25139	25139	he	98	" Is she well ? Are all the family well ? "
25155	25167	25139	25139	he	98	" I should ha ' slammed the door in his face , "

25200	25209	25211	25211	he	98	" I think I have heard of you , "
25215	25226	25211	25211	he	98	" You are Miss Leaf 's servant — Elizabeth Hand . "
25227	25232	25139	25139	he	98	" Yes , Sir , "
25246	25279	25211	25211	he	98	" If your mistresses are likely to be home soon , will you allow me to wait for them ? I am an old friend of theirs . My name is Lyon . "
25712	25724	25725	25725	she	94	" Do n't you be troubling yourself with waiting about here , "
25739	25758	25759	25759	Hilary	91	" I 'll get the tea all right , Miss Hilary . Please go back into the parlor . "
25996	26015	26017	26017	she	91	" The girl has feelings and notions on the matter , like all other girls , I suppose , "
26021	26053	26017	26017	she	91	" so it is important that her notions should be kept clear , and her feelings right . It may do her some good , and save her from much harm . "

26609	26638	26593	26593	Elizabeth	94	" So , even if Miss Hilary axes me to come , I 'll stop , I reckon . Ay , I 'll stop wi ' Miss Leaf . "
26713	26730	26701	26702	Mr. Lyon	98	" It would do you no harm , Miss Hilary ; will you walk with us ? "
26731	26736	26737	26737	Hilary	91	" If you like . "
26787	26794	26795	26795	she	91	" Thank you , thank you ! "
26837	26857	26860	26862	the young servant	3351	" Some'at 's wrong . I 'd like to know who 's been a - vexin ' of her , "

27226	27234	27221	27221	his	97	" So you think I was right ? "
27235	27238	27239	27239	she	428	" Right ? "
27243	27273	27239	27239	she	428	" I mean in accepting that sudden chance , and changing my whole plan of life . I did not do it — believe me — without a motive . "
27274	27278	27279	27279	she	428	" What motive ? "
27323	27396	27397	27397	He	98	" The change is , you perceive , from the life of a student to that of a man of business . I do not deny that I preferred the first . Once upon a time to be a fellow in a college , or a professor , or the like , was my utmost aim and I would have half killed myself to attain it . Now , I think differently . "
27415	27460	27397	27397	He	98	" I want , not to be rich but to get a decent competence , and to get it as soon as I can . I want not to ruin my health with incessant study . I have already injured it a good deal . "
27461	27472	27626	27626	she	91	" Have you been ill ? You never said so . "
27473	27517	27518	27519	Mr. Lyon	98	" Oh no , it was hardly worth while . And I knew an active life would soon set me right again . No fear ! there 's life in the old dog yet . He does not wish to die . But , "
27522	27589	27518	27519	Mr. Lyon	98	" I have had a ' sair fecht ' the last year or two . I would not go through it again , nor see any one dear to me go through it . It is over , but it has left its scars . Strange ! I have been poor all my life , yet I never till now felt an actual terror of poverty . "
27620	27625	27626	27626	she	91	" It is strange , "
27629	27649	27626	27626	she	91	" such a terror is not like you . I feel none ; I can not even understand it . "
27650	27659	27660	27660	he	98	" No , I knew you could not , "
27805	27870	27785	27785	she	91	" I do believe that this going abroad to make a fortune , which young men so delight in , is often a most fatal mistake . They give up far more than they gain — country , home , health . I think a man has no right to sell his life any more than his soul for so many thousands a year . "
27873	27959	27785	27785	she	91	smiled—"No , and I am not selling mine . With my temperate habits I have as good a chance of health at Bombay as in London — perhaps better . And the years I must be absent I would have been absent almost as much from you — I mean they would have been spent in work as engrossing and as hard . They will soon pass , and then I shall come home rich — rich . Do you think I am growing mercenary ? "
27960	27963	27785	27785	she	91	" No . "
27964	27974	27785	27785	she	91	" Tell me what you do think about me ? "
27975	27983	27785	27785	she	91	" I — can not quite understand . "
27984	28015	27785	27785	she	91	" And I can not make you understand . Perhaps I will , some day when I come back again . Till then , you must trust me , Hilary . "
28110	28118	28119	28119	She	888	" You must trust me . Hilary . "
28376	28382	28357	28357	he	98	" Like a still embrace , "
28383	28395	28357	28357	he	98	" Now tell me as much as you can about yourself . "
28705	28742	28743	28743	She	91	" To me , and to no one else , remember . No one but myself must help you . And I will , so , long as I am alive . Do you believe this ? "
28756	28760	28743	28743	She	91	" I do . "
28761	28766	28743	28743	She	91	" And you promise ? "
28767	28770	28743	28743	She	91	" Yes . "
28896	28904	28906	28906	Johanna	93	" Shall we not see you again ? "
28908	28924	28906	28906	Johanna	93	" No . This will be my last Sunday in England . Good - by ! "
29076	29091	29056	29056	she	91	" It is the will of God ; it is the will of God . "
29175	29183	29173	29173	herself	93	" This is the will of God . "
29308	29355	29304	29305	Miss Selina	92	" What a fine day Mr. Lyon was having for his journey ; what a lucky fellow he was ; how he would be sure to make a fortune , and if so , she wondered whether they should ever see or hear any thing of him again"—Elizabeth
29380	29385	29375	29376	Miss Leaf	91	" Time will show ; "

And you do n't know London ; you do n't know , with a lot of young fellows about one , how very hard it is to say no . "
30254	30268	30246	30246	Ascott	97	" What 's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh . "
30269	30275	30314	30314	He	948	" Like father like son . "

30933	30954	30988	30988	Johanna	93	" We must not let the boy remain in debt ; it would be such a disgrace to the family . "
30955	30981	30988	30988	Johanna	93	" It is not the remaining in debt , but the incurring of it , which is the real disgrace to Ascott and the family . "
30982	30986	30988	30988	Johanna	93	" Hush Hilary , "
31056	31059	31053	31054	Miss Leaf	92	" Hush ! "
31091	31109	31085	31085	she	94	" If you please , missis , I did n't mean to — but I 've heard — "
31110	31122	31085	31085	she	94	" What have you heard ; that is , how much ? "
31123	31152	31085	31085	she	94	" Just what Miss Hilary said . Do n't be afeared . I sha n't tell . I never chatter about the family . Mother told me not . "
31153	31171	31085	31085	she	94	" You owe a great deal , Elizabeth , to your good mother . Now go away . "
31172	31177	31179	31180	Miss Selina	92	" And another time . "

31887	31924	31871	31871	Selina	92	" Yes ; the work house ! It would be less shame to be honorably indebted to the laws of the land than to be meanly indebted , under false pretences , to any individual in it "
32015	32019	32067	32068	Mr. Lyon	98	" foreign parts ; "
32580	32628	32551	32551	Hilary	101	" The Stowbury people will never believe how clever I am . Only , it is a useless sort of cleverness , I fear . Greek , Latin , and mathematics are no good to infants under seven , such as Stowbury persists in sending to us . "
32629	32647	32649	32650	Miss Leaf	92	" They think I am only fit to teach little children — and perhaps it is true , "
32652	32689	32649	32650	Miss Leaf	92	" I wish you had not to teach at all . I wish I was a daily governess — I might be , and earn enough to keep the whole family ; only , not here . "
32690	32694	32696	32696	Johanna	93	" I wonder , "
32700	32710	32696	32696	Johanna	93	" if we shall have to make a change . "
32711	32715	32649	32650	Miss Leaf	92	" A change ! "
32733	32763	32725	32726	the younger	1029	" Where to — London ? Oh , I have so longed to go and live in London ! But I thought you would not like it , Johanna . "

33110	33227	33104	33105	Mr. Ascott	97	" MISS LEAF . MADAM,—I shall be obliged by your informing me if it is your wish , as it seems to be your nephew 's , that instead of returning to Stowbury , he should settle in London as a surgeon and general practitioner ? His education complete , I consider that I have done my duty by him ; but I may assist him occasionally still , unless he turns out — as his father did before him — a young man who prefers being helped to helping himself , in which case I shall have nothing more to do with him . I remain , Madam , your obedient servant , PETER ASCOTT . "
33259	33271	33256	33256	Hilary	101	" I think that reference to poor Henry is perfectly brutal . "
33272	33323	33325	33325	Johanna	93	" And yet he was very kind to Henry . And if it had not been for his common sense in sending poor little Ascott and the nurse down to Stowbury the baby might have died . But you do n't remember any thing of that time , my dear , "
33329	33347	33349	33349	Selina	92	" He has been kind enough , though he has done it in such a patronizing way , "
33351	33403	33349	33349	Selina	92	" I suppose that 's the real reason of his doing it . He thinks it fine to patronize us , and show kindness to our family ; he , the stout , bullet - headed grocer 's boy , who used to sit and stare at us all church time . "
33404	33418	33420	33420	Hilary	101	" At you — you mean . Was n't he called your beau ? "
33500	33509	33511	33511	Hilary	101	" Suppose we were to go to him , "
33600	33617	33618	33618	Elizabeth	94	" Eh ! what 's wrong ? Has Miss Selina been a - grumbling at me ? "
33688	33738	33683	33683	She	101	" I have not heard that either of my sisters is displeased with you . What they want to talk to you about is for your own good . We are thinking of making a great change . We intend to leave Stowbury and going to live in London . "
33739	33746	33751	33751	her	101	" Going to live in London ! "
33826	33837	33839	33839	she	101	" Well , what do you say to the plan ? "
33845	33853	33860	33861	Elizabeth Hand	94	" I dunnot like it at all , "

34126	34151	34107	34107	they	1065	" Miss Hilary has told you our future plans , Elizabeth ; now we wish to have a little talk with you about yours . "
34152	34155	34327	34327	she	91	" Eh ? "
34156	34219	34107	34107	they	1065	" We conclude you will not wish to go with us to London ; and it would be hardly advisable you should . You can get higher wages now than any we can afford to give you ; indeed , we have more than once thought of telling you so , and offering you your choice of trying for a better place . "
34220	34226	34107	34107	they	1065	" You 're very kind , "
34236	34291	34293	34294	Miss Leaf	91	" No ; I think we are merely honest . We should never think of keeping a girl upon lower wages than she was worth . Hitherto , however , the arrangement has been quite fair you know , Elizabeth , you have given us a deal of trouble in the teaching of you . "
34320	34326	34327	34327	she	91	" Come , my girl , "
34330	34370	34327	34327	she	91	" you need n't look so serious . We are not in the least vexed with you ; we shall be very sorry to lose you , and we will give you the best of characters when you leave . "
34371	34380	34381	34381	Elizabeth	94	" I dunnot — mean — to leave . "
34401	34408	34410	34410	Selina	92	" Who would have thought it ! "
34412	34420	34410	34410	Selina	92	" I declare the girl was crying . "
34491	34506	34486	34486	she	431	" And so , Elizabeth , you would really like to go to London ? "
34507	34545	34486	34486	she	431	" No ! I should n't like it at all ; never said I should . But if you go , I shall go too ; though Missis is so ready to get shut o ' me . "
34546	34557	34486	34486	she	431	" It was for your own good , you know . "
34558	34592	34486	34486	she	431	" You always said it was for a girl 's good to stop in one place ; and if you think I 'm going to another . I are n't that 's all . "
34745	34774	34696	34696	she	94	" Only at first , though , for I hope to find plenty of pupils , and by - and - by our nephew will get into practice . "
34775	34789	34696	34696	she	94	" Is it on account of him you 're going , Miss Hilary ? "
34790	34793	34794	34794	Elizabeth	94	" Chiefly . "
34807	34812	34817	34817	she	94	" I thought so ; "

35076	35116	35117	35118	Miss Hilary	91	" I wish the little ' uns may take pattern by our Elizabeth . You 'll send her home , may be , in two or three years ' time , to let us have a look at her ? "

35578	35599	35600	35600	Elizabeth	94	still—"I wonder , Elizabeth , what sort of place London is , and what our life will be in it ? "
35669	35673	35675	35676	Miss Leaf	91	" I remember , "
35695	35764	35675	35676	Miss Leaf	91	" I remember my grandmother telling me that when my grandfather was courting her , and she out of coquetry refused him , he set off on horseback to London , and she was so wretched to think of all the dangers he ran on the journey , and in London itself , that she never rested till she got him back , and then immediately married him . "
35765	35785	35787	35788	Miss Hilary	91	" No such catastrophe is likely to happen to any of us , except , perhaps , to Elizabeth , "
35822	35839	35787	35788	Miss Hilary	91	" What do you say ? Do you mean to get married in London , Elizabeth ? "

36596	36617	36577	36577	Elizabeth	94	" There ; I 'll do that for my sister . Go and look out of the window at London . "

37082	37110	37074	37074	Ascott	97	" you would n't be comfortable with me . A young fellow 's lodgings are not like a house of one 's own , and , besides — "
37111	37131	37179	37179	Ascott	97	" Besides , when a young fellow is ashamed of his old aunts , he can easily find reasons . "
37132	37137	37139	37140	Miss Leaf	92	" Hush , Selina ! "
37142	37178	37179	37179	Ascott	97	" My dear boy , your old aunts would never let you inconvenience yourself for them . Take us to an inn for the night , and to morrow we will find lodgings for ourselves . "
37184	37196	37198	37198	he	97	" And you are not vexed with me , Aunt Johanna ? "
37231	37264	37265	37265	Ascott	97	" No , my dear , not vexed . Only I wish we had known this a little sooner that we might have made arrangements . Now , where shall we go ? "

Not that I shall do that — at least not immediately : he is a fine young fellow , whom I 'm rather proud to have helped a step up the ladder , and I 've a great respect"—here

48284	48298	48242	48242	he	3100	sigh—"so I ought , if I were as good as my Aunt Hilary . "
48956	48974	48949	48949	Johanna	93	" Never mind , my child , all will come right in time All happens for good . "
48993	49000	48949	48949	Johanna	93	" peace which passeth all understanding , "
49161	49170	49172	49172	Hilary	101	" Clothes seem to wear out frightfully fast , "
49205	49219	49172	49172	Hilary	101	" I saw such beautiful merino dresses in a shop in Southampton Row , "
49230	49291	49227	49227	her	431	" No , no ; my old black silk will do capitally , and I can easily put on two shawls . Nobody knows me ; and people may wear what they like in London . Do n't look so grave , Elizabeth . What does it signify if I can but keep myself warm ? Now , run away . "
49310	49352	49365	49365	them	1534	" Mother gave it me ; her mistress gave it her ; but we 've never worn it , and never shall . If only you did n't mind putting it on , just this once — this terrible soaking day ! "
49419	49425	49426	49426	she	101	" Thank you , Elizabeth , "
49459	49468	49454	49454	her	101	" people might wear any thing in London . "

49627	49646	49607	49607	She	101	" It will do no harm to inquire the price . I might stop it out in omnibuses . "

50483	50515	50473	50473	she	101	" I beg your pardon , but if your way lies up Southampton Row , would you object to give an old woman a share of that capital umbrella of yours ? "
50516	50520	50521	50521	Hilary	101	" With pleasure , "

50568	50614	50542	50544	the old lady	1551	" May be you think an old woman ought to take a cab , and not be intruding upon strangers ; but I am hale and hearty , and being only a streets length from my own door , I dislike to waste unnecessary shillings . "
50615	50618	50620	50620	Hilary	101	" Certainly , "
50635	50676	50620	50620	Hilary	101	" I saw you in the boot shop , and you seemed the sort of young lady who would do a kindness to an old body like me ; so I said to myself , ' Ill ask her . ' "
50677	50684	50620	50620	Hilary	101	" I am glad you did . "
50785	50789	50738	50738	she	101	" Miss Balquidder . "
50790	50814	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" That is my name , and very much obliged to you , my dear . How it rains ! Ye're just drenched . "
50823	50840	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" I shall take no harm . I am used to go out in all weathers . "
50841	50847	50738	50738	she	101	" Are you a governess ? "
50863	50881	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" Yes ; but I have no pupils , and I fear I shall never get any . "
50882	50886	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" Why not ? "
50887	50914	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" I suppose , because I know nobody here . It seems so very hard to get teaching in London . But I beg your pardon . "
50915	50920	50922	50923	Miss Balquidder	168	" I beg yours , "

But I was once a stranger here myself , and had a ' sair fecht , ' as we say in Scotland , before I could earn even my daily bread . Though I was n't a governess , still I know pretty well what the sort of life is , and if I had daughters who must work for their bread , the one thing I would urge upon them should be—'Never become a governess . ' "
51015	51022	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" Indeed . For what reason ? "
51023	51057	50815	50815	Hilary	101	" I 'll not tell you now , my dear , standing with all your wet clothes on ; but as I said , if you will do me the favor to call . "
51058	51062	51064	51064	Hilary	101	" Thank you ! "
51165	51175	51177	51177	Hilary	101	" She has much more reason to question ours , "
51384	51399	51401	51401	Hilary	101	" Thank God , we do n't owe any thing : not a penny ! "
51403	51412	51414	51414	Johanna	93	" No ; there is comfort in that , "
51459	51476	51434	51436	the poor widow	1581	" I am sure we have wasted nothing , and cheated nobody;—surely God will help us . "

51775	51785	51735	51735	she	101	" Oh , presently . There 's no hurry . "
51786	51801	51802	51802	she	101	" I am not so sure of that . Do you know , my dear boy"—and

51823	51826	51828	51828	Ascott	145	" Nonsense , "

51851	51880	51839	51839	he	369	" but I am so accustomed to be hard up that I do n't seem to care . It always comes right somehow — at least with me . "
51881	51884	51839	51839	he	369	" How ? "
51885	51914	51915	51915	She	101	" Oh , I do n't exactly know ; but it does . Do n't fret , Aunt Hilary . I 'll lend you a pound or two . "
52010	52014	52015	52015	she	101	" I wish , Ascott"—and
52026	52047	52021	52021	somebody	3240	him—"I would you would not lend but pay us the pound a week you said you could so easily spare . "
52048	52120	52015	52015	she	101	" To be sure I will . What a thoughtless fellow I have been ! But — but — I fancied you would have asked me if you wanted it . Never mind , you 'll get it all in a lump . Let me see — how much will it come to ? You are the best head going for arithmetic , Aunt Hilary . Do reckon it all up ? "
52136	52194	52195	52195	He	145	" Upon my soul I had no idea it was so much . I 'm very sorry , but I seem fairly cleaned out this quarter — only a few sovereigns left to keep the mill going . You shall have them , or half of them , and I 'll owe you the rest . Here ! "
52216	52235	52209	52209	Hilary	101	" If he was sure he could spare so much ? She did not wish to inconvenience him . "
52236	52260	52261	52261	He	145	" Oh , not at all ; and I would n't mind if it did ; you have been good aunts to me . "

52843	52867	52810	52810	she	101	" I think , as I have nothing else to do , I will go and see Miss Balquidder to - morrow morning . "

53228	53243	53270	53271	a woman	669	" Welcome , my dear ! I was afraid you had forgotten your promise . "
53244	53248	53250	53250	Hilary	101	" Oh no , "
53274	53282	53270	53271	a woman	669	" Why did you not come sooner ? "
53338	53371	53312	53312	she	101	" May I tell you why I came to - day?—Because I want advice and help , and I think you can give it , from something I heard about you yesterday . "
53372	53378	53513	53513	her	101	" Indeed ! From whom ? "
53379	53397	53513	53513	her	101	" In rather a roundabout way ; from Mrs. Jones , who told our maid - servant . "
53398	53436	53312	53312	she	101	" The same girl I met on the staircase at your bones ? I beg your pardon , but I know where you live , Miss Leaf ; your landlady happens to be an acquaintance of mine . "
53437	53468	53513	53513	her	101	" So she said : and she told our Elizabeth that you were a rich and benevolent woman , who took a great interest in helping other women ; not in money"—blushing
53472	53498	53312	53312	she	101	idea—"I do n't mean that , but in procuring them work . I want work — oh ! so terribly . If you only knew — "
53499	53506	53312	53312	she	101	" Sit down , my dear ; "
53579	53680	53556	53556	she	168	" It is nearly my luncheon - time , and I am a great friend to regular eating and drinking . I never let any thing interfere with my own meals , or other folks ' either , if I can help it . I would as soon expect that fire to keep itself up without coals , as my mind to go on working if I do n't look after my body . You understand ? You seem to have good health , Miss Leaf . I hope you are a prudent girl , and take care of it . "
53681	53687	53689	53689	Hilary	101	" I think I do ; "
53692	53706	53689	53689	Hilary	101	" At any rate my sister does for me , and also Elizabeth . "
53707	53752	53556	53556	she	168	" Ah , I liked the look of that girl . If families did but know that the most useful patent of respectability they can carry about with them is their maid - servant ! That is how I always judge my new acquaintances . "
53753	53762	53764	53764	Hilary	101	" There 's reason in it , too , "
53825	53827	53814	53815	Miss Balquidder	168	" wit "
53830	53833	53814	53815	Miss Balquidder	168	" fun , "
54009	54013	53993	53993	They	907	women!—"I want work ! "
54177	54199	54149	54150	The latter	479	" My dear , before going further , I ought to tell you one thing — I am not a lady . "
54209	54213	54215	54216	Miss Balquidder	168	" That is , "
54220	54244	54215	54216	Miss Balquidder	168	" not an educated gentlewoman like you . I made my money myself — in trade . I kept an outfitter 's shop . "
54245	54254	54215	54216	Miss Balquidder	168	" You must have kept it uncommonly well , "
54280	54287	54289	54290	Miss Balquidder	168	" Well , perhaps I did , "
54324	54410	54292	54292	her	168	" Therefore , you see . I can not help you as a governess . Perhaps I would not if I could , for , so far as I see , a good clearance of one half the governesses into honest trades would be for their own benefit , and greatly to the benefit of the other half . But that 's not my affair . I only meddle with things I understand . Miss Leaf , would you be ashamed of keeping a shop ? "
54455	54460	54292	54292	her	168	" keeps a shop , "
54553	54568	54547	54547	he	98	" Well , I suppose I had one , but I really never heard . "
54614	54638	54609	54610	Miss Balquidder	168	" Take time to answer , and speak out , my dear . Do n't be afraid . You 'll not offend me . "
54650	54709	54609	54610	Miss Balquidder	168	" I never thought of it before ; the possibility of such a thing did not occur to me ; but I hope I should not be ashamed of any honest work for which I was competent . Only — to serve in a shop — to want upon strangers — I am so horribly shy of strangers . "
54736	54933	54725	54726	Miss Balquidder	168	" No , my dear , you would not make a good shop - woman , at least there are many who are better fitted for it than you ; and it is my maxim that people should try to find out , and to do , only that which they are best fitted for . If they did we might not have so many cases of proud despair and ambitious failure in the world . It looks very grand and interesting sometimes to try and do what you ca n't de , and then tear your hair , and think the world has ill - used you — very grand , but very silly : when all the while , perhaps , there is something else you can do thoroughly well ; and the world will be exceedingly obliged to you for doing it , and not doing the other thing.—As doubtless the world was to me , when , instead of being a mediocre musician , as I once wished to be — it 's true , my dear — I took to keeping one of the best ladies ' outfitting warehouses in London . "
55053	55101	55035	55035	She	1663	" I might have bought a landed estate to be inherited by — nobody ; or a house in Belgravia , and an opera - box , to be shared by — nobody . We all have our pet luxuries ; none of these were exactly mine . "
55102	55105	55107	55107	Hilary	101	" No , "
55190	55215	55172	55176	a proud , poor man	1668	" I love you , and I will marry you ; I am not such a coward as to be afraid of your gold . "
55321	55324	55318	55318	her	101	" good , "
55330	55337	55339	55340	Miss Balquidder	168	" You see , my dear , "
55342	55374	55339	55340	Miss Balquidder	168	" when one has no duties , one must just make them ; when we have nobody to care for us , we must take to caring for every body . I suppose"—here
55398	55422	55423	55423	her	168	told—"I suppose I was not meant to be a wife ; but I am quite certain I was meant to be a mother . And"—with
55429	55454	55423	55423	her	168	look—"you'd be astonished , Miss Leaf , if you knew what lots of ' children ' I have in all parts of the world . "
55659	55714	55715	55715	she	168	" Fair work , fair pay ; not one penny more or less ; I never do it ; it would not be honest . I overlook each business myself , and it is carried on in my name . Sometimes it brings me in a little profit ; sometimes not . Of course , "
55720	55794	55715	55715	she	168	" I would rather have profits than losses ; still , I balance one against the other , and it leaves me generally a small interest for my money — two or three per cent . , which is all I care about . Thus , you see . I and my young people make a fair bargain on both sides ; it 's no charity . I do n't believe in charity . "
55795	55798	55800	55800	Hilary	101	" No , "
55832	55840	55841	55841	she	101	" I think I could do it , "
55844	55860	55841	55841	she	101	" I think , with a little practice , I really could keep a shop . "
55861	55966	55971	55974	the woman of business	1685	" At all events , perhaps you could do what I find more difficult to get done , and well done , for it requires a far higher class of women than generally apply : you could keep the accounts of a shop ; you should be the head , and it would be easy to find the hands , Let me see ; there is a young lady , she has managed my stationer 's business at Kensington these two years , and now she is going to be married . Are you good at figures ; do you understand book - keeping ? "
56010	56031	55989	55990	Miss Balquidder	168	" I only wish there were more like you . I wish there were more young ladies brought up like — "
56032	56036	56038	56038	Hilary	101	" Like boys ! "
56042	56054	56038	56038	Hilary	101	" for I always used to say that was my case . "
56055	56069	56071	56072	Miss Balquidder	168	" No , I never desire to see young women made into men . "
56078	56129	56071	56072	Miss Balquidder	168	" But I do wish girls were taught fewer accomplishments , and more reading , writing , and arithmetic ; were made as accurate , orderly , and able to help themselves as boys are . But to business . Will you take the management of my stationer 's shop ? "
56181	56195	56196	56197	Miss Balquidder	168	" How much should I be able to earn , do you think ? "
56229	56239	56220	56220	she	168	" I will give you a hundred a year . "
56264	56282	56283	56283	She	101	" Will you give me a day or two to think about it and consult my sisters ? "
56318	56359	56312	56315	The good old lady	1690	" Take your own time , my dear ; I will keep the situation open for you for one week from this date . And now I must send you away , for I have a great deal to do . "
56482	56489	56490	56490	He	1696	" What would Robert Lyon say ? "
56695	56700	56688	56688	change!—which	170	" keepers at home ; "
56723	56747	56753	56753	her	101	" What if he should look down upon me ? What if he should return and find me different from what he expected ? "
56772	56865	56866	56866	Her	101	" No ; love is worth nothing that is not worth every thing , and to be trusted through every thing . If he could forget me — could love any one better than me — me myself , no matter what I was — ugly or pretty , old or young , rich or poor — I would not care for his love . It would not be worth my having ; I 'd let it go . Robert , though it broke my heart , I 'd let you go . "
56907	56914	56919	56923	a man to be trusted	1709	pain—"You must trust me , Hilary . "
57062	57067	57069	57071	this forlorn girl	1716	" Robert , Robert ! "
57108	57123	57125	57126	Miss Hilary	91	" O Robert , be faithful ! faithful to yourself — faithful to me ! "
57166	57172	57173	57173	Hilary	101	" With Mr. Peter Ascott ! "
57212	57223	57242	57242	she	101	" She will be back to dinner , I suppose ? "
57224	57230	57232	57232	Elizabeth	94	" I do n't know , "
57267	57275	57242	57242	she	101	" What is the matter , Elizabeth ? "
57349	57353	57335	57335	she	3072	" a poor servant "
57406	57413	57378	57379	The girl	307	" told Miss Hilary every thing . "
57643	57685	57640	57640	Ascott	97	" So he is — a very particular friend ; but my aunts would not fancy him , and I do n't want him to come here . Say , if he calls , that I 'm gone out of town . "
57686	57698	57700	57700	Elizabeth	94	" Very well , sir . Shall you start before dinner ? "
57735	57763	57730	57730	He	97	" Bless you , you are the greatest innocent ! Just say what I tell you , and never mind — hush ! here 's Aunt Hilary . "
58132	58151	58125	58125	she	101	" I wonder whether Miss Hilary knows of this ? I wonder what she would say to it ? "
58247	58255	58257	58257	Elizabeth	94	" Miss Selina is n't my enemy , "
58259	58300	58257	58257	Elizabeth	94	" but I 'm not overfond of her , and so I 'd rather not tell of her , or vex her if I can help it . Any how , I 'll keep it to myself for a bit . "
58395	58411	58412	58412	He	1765	" Neither carriage nor horses , nor nothing , will ever make him a gentleman ? "
58453	58458	58426	58426	Ascott	97	" out of town . "

58572	58591	58554	58554	she	101	" Selina , I wanted to have a little family consultation . I have just received an offer . "
58592	58596	58598	58599	Miss Selina	92	" An offer ! "
58606	58644	58598	58599	Miss Selina	92	" Oh , I forgot ; you went to see your friend , Miss Balquidder , this morning . Did you get any thing out of her ? Has she any nephews and nieces wanting a governess ? "
58645	58665	58675	58675	Ascott	97	" She has no relations at all . But I will just tell you the story of my visit . "
58666	58673	58675	58675	Ascott	97	" I hope it 's interesting , "
58731	58758	58725	58725	he	97	" Well , that is a rich idea . I 'll come and buy of you . You 'll look so pretty standing behind a counter . "
58765	58785	58760	58760	Selina	92	" You can not even think of such a thing . It would be a disgrace to the family . "
58786	58789	58791	58791	Hilary	101	" No , "
58810	58857	58801	58801	they	1775	" I can not see any disgrace . If our family is so poor that the women must earn their living as well as the men , all we have to see is that it should be honestly earned . What do you say , Ascott ? "
58889	58958	58959	58959	He	97	" I do n't see why Aunt Selina should make such a fuss . Why need you do anything , Aunt Hilary ? Ca n't we hold out a little longer , and live upon tick till I get into practice ? Of course , I shall then take care of you all ; I 'm the head of the family . How horribly dark this room is ! "
59021	59067	59017	59017	herself	93	" Ascott says right ; he is the head of the family , and , by - and - by . I trust will take care of us all . But he is not able to do it now , and meantime we must live . "
59068	59077	59099	59099	her	92	" To be sure , we must Auntie . "
59078	59097	59099	59099	her	92	" I mean , my boy , we must live honestly ; we must not run into debt : "
59129	59142	59144	59144	her	92	" No , Ascott , out of debt out of danger . For myself"—she
59164	59200	59144	59144	her	92	hopelessness—"I would rather see you breaking stones in the road than living like a gentleman , as you call it , and a swindler , as I call it , upon other people 's money . "
59208	59246	59201	59201	Ascott	97	" You use strong language , Aunt Johanna . Never mind . I dare say you are right . However , it 's no business of mine . Good - night , for I have an engagement . "
59264	59289	59247	59247	Hilary	101	" Oh no ; I bate talking over things . Settle it among yourselves . As I said , it is n't my business . "
59290	59311	59201	59201	Ascott	97	" You do n't care , then , what becomes of us all ? I sometimes begin to think so . "
59330	59357	59317	59317	Ascott	97	" What have I done ? I may be a very bad fellow , but I 'm not quite so bad as that . Aunt Hilary . "
59358	59368	59370	59371	Aunt Johanna	93	" She did n't mean it , my boy , "
59419	59501	59502	59502	He	97	" I know I 'm not half good enough to you , Auntie , but I mean to be . I mean to work hard , and be a rich man some day ; and then you may be sure I shall not let my Aunt Hilary keep a shop . Now , good - night , for I must meet a fellow on business — really business — that may turn out good for us all , I assure you . "
59530	59535	59524	59524	them	1781	" only a boy , "
59637	59645	59647	59647	Selina	110	" It is a thing quite impossible , "
59652	59717	59647	59647	Selina	110	" Why impossible ? I can certainly do the work ; and it can not make me less of a lady . Besides , we had better not be ladies if we can not be honest ones . And , Selina , where is the money to come from ? We have none in the house ; we can not get any till Christmas . "
59718	59727	59611	59611	She	101	" Opportunities might occur . We have friends . "
59728	59790	59611	59611	She	101	" Not one in London ; except , perhaps , Mr. Ascott , and I would not ask him for a farthing . You do n't see , Selina , how horrible it would be to be helped , unless by some one dearly loved . I could n't bear it ! I 'd rather beg , starve : almost steal ! "
59791	59799	59647	59647	Selina	110	" Do n't be violent , child . "
59800	59808	59611	59611	She	101	" Oh , but it 's hard ! "
59820	59903	59611	59611	She	101	" Hard enough to have to earn one 's bread in a way one does n't like ; harder still to have to be parted from Johanna from Monday morning till Saturday night . But it must be , I 'll go . It 's a case between hunger , debt , and work : the first is unpleasant , the second impossible , the third is my only alternative . You must consent , Selina , for I will do it . "
59904	59908	59909	59909	Selina	110	" Do n't ! "
59921	59964	59909	59909	Selina	110	" Do n't disgrace me , child ; for I may as well tell you — I meant to do so to - night — Mr. Ascott has made me an offer of marriage , and I — I have accepted it . "
60054	60058	60013	60014	Many women	1790	" dear Selina , "
60161	60173	60192	60192	she	110	" Oh , Selina ! you can not be in earnest ? "
60174	60190	60192	60192	she	110	" Why not ? Why should I not be married as well as my neighbors ? "
60216	60270	60211	60211	she	110	" I assure you , sisters , there could not be a more unexceptionable offer . It is true , Mr. Ascott 's origin was rather humble ; but I can overlook that . In his present wealth , and with his position and character , he will make the best of husbands . "
60385	60404	60380	60380	she	110	" Quite . He wrote to me last night , and I gave him his answer this morning . "
60414	60418	60380	60380	she	110	" love affairs . "
60464	60506	60456	60456	she	110	" He had behaved handsomely — very much so . He makes a good settlement on me , and says how happy he will be to help my family , so as to enable you always to make a respectable appearance . "
60507	60515	60456	60456	she	110	" We are exceedingly obliged to him . "
60516	60558	60456	60456	she	110	" Do n't be sharp , Hilary . He means well . And he must feel that this marriage is a sort of — ahem ! condescension on my part , which I never should have dreamed of twenty years ago . "
60650	60656	60657	60657	she	110	" And therefore you see , "
60676	60705	60657	60657	she	110	" it 's quite impossible that my sister should keep a shop . I shall tell Mr. Ascott , and you will see what he says to it . "
60821	60831	60833	60833	he	145	" Do n't vex yourself , my dear Selina , "
60847	60872	60833	60833	he	145	name—"but I ca n't see that it 's my business to interfere . I marry you , I do n't marry your whole family . "
60873	60886	60888	60888	Johanna	93	" Mr. Ascott is quite right ; we will end the subject , "
61003	61009	61010	61010	he	98	" My only consolation is , "
61020	61036	61016	61016	himself	98	" that however hard my life out here may be , I bear it alone . "

63788	63798	63781	63786	some one coming stealthily up stairs	1934	" Hollo!—Oh , it 's only you , Elizabeth . "
63799	63808	63811	63811	she	94	" Shall I light your candle , sir ? "
63879	63887	63889	63889	Elizabeth	94	" Do you want anything , Sir ? "
63895	63912	63889	63889	Elizabeth	94	" No — yes — stay a minute . Elizabeth , are you to be trusted ? "
63913	63921	63965	63965	him	3698	" I hope I am , Sir . "
63922	63954	63957	63957	she	94	" The bailiffs are after me . I 've just dodged them . If they know I 'm here the game 's all up — and it will kill my aunt . "
63996	64009	64011	64011	she	94	" Come , Sir , ' tis no use taking on so , "
64066	64074	64039	64039	she	94	" What do you mean to do ? "
64075	64093	64094	64094	He	3698	" Nothing . I 'm cleaned out . And I have n't a friend in the world . "

64154	64209	64283	64283	he	3698	" Come , it 's no use making things worse than they are . If no body knows that you are here , lock your door and keep quiet . I 'll bring you some dinner when I bring up Missis ' tea , and not even Mrs. Jones will be any the wiser . "
64210	64222	64224	64226	the young fellow	3447	" You 're a brick , Elizabeth — a regular brick ! "
64235	64267	64224	64226	the young fellow	3447	" That will be capital.—Get me a good slice of beef , or ham , or something . And mind you , do n't forget!—a regular stunning bottle of pale ale . "
64268	64274	64283	64283	he	3698	" Very well , Sir . "
64364	64371	64358	64359	her mistress	431	" Is my nephew come home ? "
64474	64532	64467	64467	He	97	" Do n't look so glum , Elizabeth . I shall soon weather through . Old Ascott will fork out ; he could n't help it . I 'm to be his nephew you know . Oh , that was a clever catch of Aunt Selina 's . If only Aunt Hilary would try another like it . "
64533	64546	64584	64584	he	97	" If you please , Sir , I 'm going to bed . "
64547	64579	64584	64584	he	97	" Off with you , then , and I 'll not forget the gown at Christmas . You 're a sharp young woman , and I 'm much obliged to you . "
64644	64647	64685	64686	the sheriff	1951	" Fire ! "
64743	64763	64764	64764	He	97	" No ; she 'll know it quite soon enough.—Let her sleep till morning . Elizabeth , look here . "
64781	64819	64820	64820	He	97	" Give Aunt Hilary this . Say if she can think of a way to get me out of this horrid mess ; but I do n't deserve — Never mind . Come on , you fellows . "
64951	65014	64948	64949	Miss Hilary	91	" HONORED MADAM,—Mr . Leaf has got himself into trouble , and is taken away somewhere ; and I dare not tell missis ; and I wish you was at home , as she is not well , but better than she has been , and she shall know nothing about it till you come.—Your obedient and affectionate servant , ELIZABETH HAND . "
65199	65228	65175	65175	she	94	" Please , ma'am , I 'm Miss Leaf 's servant . My missis is ill , and I want a letter sent at once to Miss Hilary . "
65229	65246	65154	65154	herself	168	" Oh ! come in , then . Elizabeth , I think , your name is ? "
65247	65252	65171	65171	Elizabeth	94	" Yes , ma'am . "
65253	65272	65175	65175	she	94	" What made you leave home at this hour of the night ? Did your mistress send you ? "
65273	65276	65154	65154	herself	168	" No . "
65277	65305	65306	65306	Elizabeth	94	" Is she so very ill ? It seems sudden . I saw Miss Hilary to - day , and she knew nothing at all about it . "
65321	65353	65306	65306	Elizabeth	94	" There 's more amiss than you have told me , young woman . Is it because your mistress is in serious danger that you want to send for her sister ? "
65354	65357	65154	65154	herself	168	" No . "
65358	65376	65306	65306	Elizabeth	94	" What is it then ? You had better tell me at once . I hate concealment . "
65388	65418	65383	65383	Elizabeth	94	" I beg your pardon , ma'am ; but I do n't think missis would like any body to know , and therefore I 'd rather not tell you . "
65470	65504	65464	65464	she	1969	" Very well , child , keep your mistress 's secrets by all means . Only tell me what you want . Shall I take a cab and fetch Miss Hilary at once ? "
65561	65570	65572	65573	Miss Balquidder	168	" You are a good , mindful girl , "
65575	65585	65572	65573	Miss Balquidder	168	" How did you learn to be so sensible ? "
65663	65675	65657	65657	her	168	" David , is your wife away to her bed yet ? "
65676	65681	65657	65657	her	168	" No , ma'am . "
65682	65721	65657	65657	her	168	" Then tell her to fetch this young woman to the kitchen and give her some supper . And afterward , will you see her safe home , poor lassie ? She 's awfully tired , you see . "
65722	65727	65657	65657	her	168	" Yes , ma'am . "
65915	65922	65924	65924	Elizabeth	94	" Go away , Mrs. Jones , "
65928	65938	65924	65924	Elizabeth	94	" Miss Hilary will call when she wants you . "
66028	66049	65991	65992	a servant	246	" Mrs. Jones has told me every thing , Elizabeth . How is my sister ? She does not know ? "
66050	66096	65991	65992	a servant	246	" No ; and I think she is a good deal better this morning . She has been very bad all week ; only she would not let me send for you . She is really getting well now ; I 'm sure of that ! "
66097	66101	65991	65992	a servant	246	" Thank God ! "
66195	66201	66160	66160	Ascott	175	" beginning of the end . "
66383	66401	66377	66377	Tennyson	178	" If I am dear to some one else , Then I should be to myself more dear "
66729	66745	66723	66725	the poor girl	1994	" Oh , Johanna ! I can bear any thing as long as I have you "
66817	66853	66854	66854	Elizabeth	94	" Still you need not have minded telling me ; though it was very good and thoughtful of you Elizabeth . You have gone through a great deal for our sakes , my poor girl . "
66866	66869	66871	66872	Miss Leaf	91	" Nay , "
66888	66909	66871	66872	Miss Leaf	91	" You shall tell me the rest another time . Go down now , and get Miss Hilary some breakfast . "
66947	66955	66956	66956	Johanna	93	" What must be done . Johanna ? "
66965	66977	66956	66956	Johanna	93	" I see but one thing — to get him home . "
66991	67090	66978	66978	Hilary	91	" No , not that . I will never agree to it.—We can not help him . He does not deserve helping . If the debts were for food now , or any necessaries ; but for mere luxuries , mere fine clothes ; it is his tailor who has arrested him , you know . I would rather have gone in rags ! I would rather see us all in rags!—It 's mean , selfish , cowardly , and I despise him for it . Though he is my own flesh and blood , I despise him . "
67091	67094	66956	66956	Johanna	93	" Hilary ! "
67095	67098	67104	67104	her	91	" No . "
67108	67175	66956	66956	Johanna	93	" I do n't mean that I despise him . I 'm sorry for him : there is good in him , poor dear lad ; but I despise his weakness ; I feel fierce to think how much it will cost us all , and especially you , Johanna . Only think what comforts of all sorts that thirty pounds would have brought to you ! "
67176	67181	67183	67183	Johanna	93	" God will provide , "
67187	67214	67183	67183	Johanna	93	" But I know , my dear , this is sharper to you than to me . Besides , I have been more used to it . "
67333	67340	67410	67410	she	91	" Pay me what thou owest ! "
67341	67401	67410	67410	she	91	" But things can not again be so bad as those days , Hilary . Ascott is young ; he may mend . People can mend , my child ; and he had such a different bringing up from what his father had , and his grandfather , too . We must not be hopeless yet . You see , "
67454	67525	67526	67526	Hilary	91	scorns—"you see , the boy is our boy ; our own flesh and blood . We were very foolish to let him away from us for so long . We might have made him better if we had kept him at Stowbury . But he is young ; that is my hope of him ; and he was always fond of his aunts , and is still , I think . "
67530	67542	67526	67526	Hilary	91	" Deeds , not words I do n't believe in words . "
67543	67563	67564	67564	Hilary	91	" Well , let us put aside believing , and only act . Let us give him another chance . "
67569	67686	67566	67566	her	91	" Another , and another , and another — it will be always the same . I know it will . I ca n't tell how it is , Johanna ; but whenever I look at you , I feel so stern and hard to Ascott . It seems as if there were circumstances when pity to some , to one , was wicked injustice to others : as if there were times when it is right and needful to lop off , at once and forever , a rotten branch rather than let the whole tree go to rack and ruin . I would do it ! I should think myself justified in doing it . "
67687	67703	67526	67526	Hilary	91	" But not just yet . He is only a boy — our own boy . "
67752	67759	67761	67761	Hilary	91	" But what can we do ? "
67765	67782	67761	67761	Hilary	91	" Thirty pounds , and not a halfpenny to pay it with ; must we borrow ? "
67783	67789	67761	67761	Hilary	91	" Oh no — no , "
67799	67809	67761	67761	Hilary	91	" no borrowing . There is the diamond ring . "
67882	67890	67892	67892	Johanna	93	" Who must do without it now , "
67900	67916	67892	67892	Johanna	93	" that is , if he ever takes to himself a wife , poor boy . "
67924	67936	67917	67917	Hilary	91	" Unless he alters , I earnestly hope he never may . "
68002	68099	68100	68100	She	2021	" Do n't mind it , Johanna ; for indeed I do not . I shall go to a first rate , respectable jeweler , and he will not cheat me ; and then I shall find my way to the sponging - house — isn't that what they call it ? I dare say many a poor woman has been there before me . I am not the first , and shall not be the last , and no body will harm me . I think I look honest , though my name is Leaf . "
68230	68245	68222	68223	Her mistress	431	" Never mind about me ; I shall come to no harm , Elizabeth . "
68246	68262	68222	68223	Her mistress	431	" It 's a bad place ; such a dreadful place , Mrs. Jones says . "
68263	68267	68268	68268	Elizabeth	94	" Is it ? "
68314	68328	68329	68329	She	91	" No matter , I must go . Take care of my sister . "

69339	69363	69364	69364	she	91	" Monday will be too late . I shall be away . And you know you ca n't do without my excellent arithmetic , "
69371	69394	69364	69364	she	91	" Now , Ascott , be a good boy — fetch down all those bills and let us go over them together . "
69395	69407	69411	69411	Johanna	93	" His debts came to more than the thirty pounds then ? "
69418	69428	69411	69411	Johanna	93	" Yes . But the ring sold for fifty . "
69512	69525	69527	69527	Hilary	101	" Is that all ! You are quite sure it is all ? "
69559	69580	69545	69545	He	369	" Not that , but you might easily have made a mistake ; you are so careless about money matters . "
69581	69644	69646	69646	he	369	" Ah , that 's it . I 'm just careless , and so I come to grief . But I never mean to be careless any more . I 'll be as precise as you . I 'll balance my books every week — every day if you like — exactly as you do at that horrid shop , Aunt Hilary . "
69661	69690	69652	69652	Hilary	101	" You see , this sum is more than we expected . How is it to be met ? Think for yourself . You are a man now . "
69691	69696	69698	69698	Ascott	99	" I know that , "
69702	69783	69698	69698	Ascott	99	" but what 's the use of it?—money only makes the man , and I have none . If the ancient Peter would but die now and leave me his heir , though to be sure Aunt Selina might be putting her oar in . Perhaps — considering I 'm Aunt Selina 's nephew — if I were to walk into the old chap now he might be induced to fork out ! Hurrah ! that 's a splendid idea . "
69784	69788	69652	69652	Hilary	101	" What idea ? "
69789	69799	69652	69652	Hilary	101	" I 'll borrow the money from old Ascott . "
69800	69835	69698	69698	Ascott	99	" That means , because he has already given , you would have him keep on giving — and you would take and take and take — Ascott , I 'm ashamed of you . "
69843	69860	69837	69837	Ascott	99	" Nonsence!—he has money and I have none ; why should n't he give it me ? "
69861	69862	69865	69865	her	99	" Why?"—she
69879	69975	69878	69878	she	99	spoke—"I'll tell you , since you do n't seem yourself to understand it . Because a young man , with health and strength in him , should blush to eat any bread but what he himself earns . Because he should work at any thing and every thing , stint himself of every luxury and pleasure , rather than ask or borrow , or , except under rare circumstances , rather than be indebted to any living soul for a single half - penny . I would not , if I were a young man . "
69976	69989	69878	69878	she	99	" What a nice young man you would make , Aunt Hilary ! "
70067	70161	70162	70162	She	2061	" Come now , my pretty aunt must go with me . She will manage the old ogre much better than I. And he must be managed somehow . It 's all very fine talking of independence , but is n't it hard that a poor fellow should be living in constant dread of being carried off to that horrid , uncleanly , beastly den — bah ! I do n't like thinking of it — and all for the want of twenty pounds ? You must go to him , Aunt Hilary . "
70510	70511	70505	70505	he	97	" tipsy"—that
70545	70548	70505	70505	he	97	" merry , "
70550	70553	70541	70541	He	97	" comfortable , "
70704	70720	70723	70723	hers	101	" a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of things that he possesses ; "
70994	71005	70985	70985	Hilary	101	" Mr. Ascott , I want to speak to you . "
71006	71038	71058	71058	she	101	" With pleasure , my dear young lady . Will you come to my study?—I have a most elegantly furnished study , I assure you . And any affair of yours — "
71039	71055	71058	71058	she	101	" Thank you , but it is not mine ; it concerns my nephew here . "
71286	71298	71300	71300	he	145	" A very pretty story , but I almost expected it , "
71338	71348	71349	71349	he	145	" It all comes to this , young man , "
71382	71456	71349	71349	he	145	way—"you want money , and you think I 'm sure to give it , because it would n't be pleasant just now to have discreditable stories going about concerning the future Mrs. Ascott 's relatives . You 're quite right , it would n't . But I 'm too old a bird to be caught with chaff for all that . You must rise very early in the morning to take me in . "
71466	71543	71457	71457	Hilary	101	" That 's not fair , Mr. Ascott . We do not take you in . Have we not told you the whole truth ? I was determined you should know it before we asked you for one farthing of your money . If there were the smallest shadow of a chance for Ascott in any other way , we never would have come to you at all . It is a horrible , horrible humiliation ! "
71614	71679	71680	71680	He	145	" Do n't vex yourself , my dear . I shall give the young fellow what he wants : nobody ever called Peter Ascott stingy . But he has cost me enough already : he must shift for himself now . Hand me over that check - book , Ascott ; but remember this is the last you 'll ever see of my money . "
71704	71708	71723	71723	he	145	" Twenty pounds , "
71732	71736	71723	71723	he	145	" Peter Ascott , "
71750	71789	71791	71791	his	145	" There , Miss Halary , I flatter myself that 's not a bad signature , nor would be easily forged . One can not be too careful over — What 's that ? a letter , John ? "
71843	71860	71862	71862	he	145	" Here 's yours Ascott ; take it , and let me have done with it , "
71872	71908	71862	71862	he	145	" Ca n't waste time on such small transactions . Ma'am , excuse me , but five thousand pounds depends on my getting these letters written and sent off within a quarter of an hour . "
72109	72119	72120	72120	she	101	" Do n't be down - hearted , Ascott , "
72123	72162	72120	72120	she	101	" we will manage to get on somehow till you bear of a practice , and then you must work — work like a ' brick , ' as you call it . You will , I know . "
72167	72179	72180	72180	she	101	" I wo n't let you give in , my boy , "
72186	72299	72180	72180	she	101	" Who would ever dream of giving in at your age , with health and strength , a good education , and no encumbrances whatever — not even aunts ! for we will not stand in your way , be sure of that . If you can not settle here , you shall try to get out abroad , as you have sometimes wished , as an army surgeon or a ship 's doctor ; you say these appointments are easy enough to be had . Why not try ? Any thing ; we will consent to any thing , if only we can see your life busy and useful and happy . "
72372	72403	72355	72356	Aunt Johanna	93	" Oh yes , aunt , we 've done it ; we 've got the money , and now I may go to the dogs as soon as I like . "
72404	72407	72409	72410	Aunt Hilary	101	" No , "
72412	72440	72441	72441	she	101	" it is nothing of the sort : it is only that Ascott must now depend upon himself , and not upon his godfather . Take courage , "
72456	72510	72441	72441	she	101	" we 'll never let our boy go to the dogs ! and as for this disappointment , or any disappointment , why it 's just like a cold bath , it takes away your breath for the time , and then you rise up out of it brisker and fresher than ever . "
72521	72576	72514	72514	his	145	" Why should that old fellow be as rich as Croesus and I as poor as a rat ? Why should I be put into the world to enjoy myself , and ca n't ? Why was I made like what I am , and then punished for it ? Whose fault is it ? "
72620	72633	72577	72577	Ay	184	" Binding nature fate to fate , Leaves free the human will , "
72881	72885	72889	72889	they	2113	" second death ? "
73014	73103	73104	73104	Ascott	145	" I can not explain , Ascott , why it is that any of us are what we are , and why things happen to us as they do ; it is a question we none of us understand , and in this world never shall . But if we know what we ought to be , and how we may make the best of every thing , good or bad , that happens to us , surely that is enough without perplexing ourselves about any thing more . "
73132	73187	73113	73113	he	145	" Any how , I 've got Ł20 in my pocket , so I ca n't starve for a day or two . Let 's see ; where is it to be cashed ? Hillo ! who would have thought the old fellow would have been so stupid ? Look there , Aunt Hilary ! "
73213	73215	73202	73202	she	2118	" Ł20 "
73229	73234	73236	73236	Ascott	145	" Ho , ho ! "
73251	73322	73236	73236	Ascott	145	" It must have been the Ł5000 pending that muddled the ' cute old fellow 's brains . I wonder whether he will remember it afterward , and come posting up to see that I 've taken no ill - advantage of his blunder ; changed this ' Twenty ' into ' Seventy . ' I easily could , and put the figures Ł70 here . What a good joke ! "
73323	73341	73381	73381	Hilary	101	" Had ye not better go to him at once , and have the matter put right ? "
73342	73378	73381	73381	Hilary	101	" Rubbish ! I can put it right myself . It makes no difference who fills up a check , so that it is signed all correct . A deal you women know of business ! "
73408	73428	73429	73429	He	145	" Very well ; just as you like . I do believe you are afraid of my turning forger . "
73489	73499	73500	73500	he	145	" Oh , Ascott , where have you been ? "
73515	73559	73500	73500	he	145	" Where have I been ? taking a walk round the Park ; that 's all . Ca n't I come and go as I like , without being pestered by women ? I 'm horribly tired . Let me alone — do ! "
73626	73632	73633	73633	she	101	" Is he come in ? "
73636	73655	73633	73633	she	101	" because there are more bailiffs after him . I 'm sure of it ; I saw them . "
73727	73751	73752	73752	Elizabeth	94	" Go to bed now — there 's a good girl ; it is hard that you should be troubled with our troubles . "
73980	74070	73954	73954	Hilary	101	" What are you meddling with my things for ? Do you want to get at the check , and be peering at it to see if it 's all right ? But you ca n't ; I 've paid it away . Perhaps you 'd like to know who to ? Then you sha n't . I 'll not be accountable to you for all my proceedings . I 'll not be treated like a baby . You 'd better mind what you are about , Aunt Hilary . "
74206	74266	74197	74197	She	2130	herself—"You mistake , Ascott ; I have no wish to interfere with you whatever ; you are your own master , and must take your own course . I only expect from you the ordinary respect that a gentleman shows to a lady . You must be very tired and ill , or you would not have forgotten that . "
74267	74283	74285	74285	he	2134	" I did n't ; or , if I did , I beg your pardon , "
74290	74298	74285	74285	he	2134	" When are you going to bed ? "
74299	74309	74197	74197	She	2130	" Directly . Shall I light your candle also ? "
74310	74347	74348	74348	His	2134	" Oh no ; not for the world ; I could n't sleep a wink . I 'd go mad if I went to bed . I think I 'll turn out and have a cigar . "
74383	74415	74355	74381	his Aunt Johanna , who had sat aloof , terribly grieved , but afraid to interfere , was moved to rise up and go over to him	93	" Ascott , my dear , you are looking quite ill . Be advised by your old auntie . Go to bed at once , and forget every thing till morning . "
74416	74433	74434	74434	He	2134	" I wish I could ; I wish I could . Oh , Auntie , Auntie ! "
74673	74698	74700	74700	Hilary	101	" He will come to himself by - and by ; his moods , good or bad , never last long , you know , "
74705	74728	74700	74700	Hilary	101	" But , in the mean time , I think we had better just do as he says — let him alone . "
74911	74917	74928	74928	she	101	" Good night , Ascott ! "
75114	75117	75073	75073	she	101	" fretting . "

76416	76420	76409	76409	She	101	" My sister — "
76421	76443	76409	76409	She	101	" Do n't be frightened ; your sisters are quite well . I called at No . 15 an hour ago . "
76444	76449	76409	76409	She	101	" You saw them ? "
76450	76462	76409	76409	She	101	" No ; I thought it unadvisable , under the circumstances . "
76463	76467	76409	76409	She	101	" What circumstances ? "
76468	76530	76531	76531	He	2178	" I will explain , if you will allow me to sit down ; bah ! I 've brought in sticking to me a straw out of that confounded shaky old cab . One ought never to be so stupid as to go any where except in one 's own carriage . This is rather a small room , Miss Hilary . "
76616	76629	76736	76736	his	145	" So you have really no idea what I 'm come about ! "
76630	76635	76733	76733	He	145	" Not the slightest . "
76636	76639	76641	76642	Peter Ascott	145	" Well ! "
76644	76673	76641	76642	Peter Ascott	145	" I hardly thought it ; but when one has been taken in as I have been , and this is n't the first time by your family — "
76674	76683	76736	76736	his	145	" Mr. Ascott ! will you explain yourself ? "
76684	76732	76733	76733	He	145	" I will , ma'am . It 's a very unpleasant business I come about ; any other gentleman but me would have come with a police officer at his back . Look here , Miss Hilary Leaf — did you ever set eyes on this before ? "
76768	76799	76752	76752	he	145	" My banker sent in to - day my canceled checks , which I do n't usually go over oftener than three months ; he knew that , the scamp . "
76804	76814	76815	76815	He	145	" Your nephew , to be sure . See ! "
76837	76844	76815	76815	He	145	" Ascott Leaf , or bearer , "
76854	76858	76828	76828	him	145	" Peter Ascott . "

77036	77111	77113	77114	Mr. Ascott	145	" Well , is n't this a nice return for all my kindness ? So cleverly done , too . But for the merest chance I might not have found it out for three months . Oh , he 's a precious young rascal , this nephew of yours . His father was only a fool , but he — Do you know that this is a matter of forgery — forgery , ma'am , "
77226	77239	77219	77219	she	91	" What do you mean to do ? Shall you prosecute him ? "
77287	77366	77368	77368	he	145	" Well , I have n't exactly determined . The money , you see , is of no moment to me , and I could n't get it back any how . He 'll never be worth a half - penny , that rascal . I might prosecute , and nobody would blame me ; indeed , if I were to decline marrying your sister , and cut the whole set of you , I do n't see , "
77373	77385	77368	77368	he	145	" that any thing could be said against me . But — "
77411	77434	77408	77408	he	145	" Come , come , I wo n't disgrace your family ; I wo n't do any thing to harm the fellow . "
77435	77439	77441	77441	Hilary	91	" Thank you ! "
77450	77520	77441	77441	Hilary	91	" As for my money , he 's welcome to it , and much good may it do him . ' Set a beggar on horseback , and he 'll ride to the devil , ' and in double quick time too . I wo n't hinder him . I wash my hands of the young scape - grace . But he 'd better not come near me again . "
77521	77524	77526	77526	Hilary	91	" No , "
77530	77534	77536	77537	Mr. Ascott	145	" In fact , "
77547	77622	77624	77624	he	145	" I have already taken measures to frighten him away , so that he may make himself scarce , and give neither you nor me any farther trouble . I drove up to your door with a policeman , asked to see Mr. Leaf , and when I heard that he was out — a lie , of course I left word I 'd be back in half an hour . Depend upon it , "
77628	77653	77624	77624	he	145	" he will smell a rat , and make a moonlight flitting of it , and we shall never hear of him any more . "
77654	77662	77664	77664	Hilary	91	" Never hear of Ascott any more ? "
77734	77749	77750	77752	Mr. Peter Ascott	145	" Oh , I must go home . This will break Johanna 's heart ! "
77786	77790	77782	77782	his	145	" young person , "
77887	77897	77899	77899	he	145	" You 're not a bad woman of business , "
77906	77924	77899	77899	he	145	" This seems a tidy little shop ; I dare say you 'll get on in it . "
77946	77989	77925	77925	She	91	" How much might your weekly receipts be in a place like this ? And what salary does Miss — Miss What's - her - name give to each of you ? You 're the head shop - woman , I suppose ? "
78009	78016	78000	78000	her	91	" Never see Ascott any more ! "
78143	78151	78153	78154	the girl	307	" Oh no , nothing has happened , "
78156	78190	78153	78154	the girl	307	" Only Miss Leaf sent me to see if you could come home to night instead of tomorrow . She is quite well , that is , pretty well ; but Mr. Leaf — "
78290	78320	78281	78281	He	145	" Young woman — I believe you are the young woman who this afternoon told me that Mr. Leaf was out . It was a fib , of course . "
78326	78341	78281	78281	He	145	" No , Sir ; I do n't tell fibs . He was out . "
78342	78354	78281	78281	He	145	" Did you give him my message when he came in ? "
78355	78360	78281	78281	He	145	" Yes , Sir . "
78361	78370	78281	78281	He	145	" And what did he say , oh ? "
78371	78374	78281	78281	He	145	" Nothing . "
78624	78633	78634	78634	she	94	" I 'll take the tea in myself , "
78637	78693	78634	78634	she	94	" for I want you to start at once for Kensington to fetch Miss Hilary . Do n't frighten her — mind that Elizabeth . Say I am much as usual myself ; but that Mr. Leaf is not quite well , and I think she might do him good . Remember the exact words . "
78806	78849	78792	78792	he	97	" Come , my wench , you 'd better tell ; it 'll be none the worse for you , and it sha n't harm the young fellow , though I dare say he has paid you well for holding your tongue . "
78850	78856	78784	78784	He	97	" About what , sir ? "
78857	78885	78792	78792	he	97	" Oh ! you know what happened when you told him I had called , eh ? Servants get to know all about their master 's affairs . "
78886	78909	78911	78911	Elizabeth	94	" Mr. Leaf is n't my master , and his affairs are nothing to me ; I do n't pry into 'em , "
78913	78950	78911	78911	Elizabeth	94	" If you want to know any thing , Sir , had n't you better ask himself ! He 's at home to - night . I left him and my missus going to their tea . "
78951	78961	78911	78911	Elizabeth	94	" Left them at home , and at tea ? "
78962	78968	78911	78911	Elizabeth	94	" Yes , Miss Hilary . "
79081	79089	79072	79072	Hilary	91	" clothed and in his right mind , "
79110	79125	79134	79134	women	3061	" was dead and is alive again , was lost , and is found ; "

79524	79646	79520	79520	Hilary	91	" Well , I wo n't , though it 's his right name — a fellow who could — Look you , Miss Hilary , when his father sent to me to beg ten pounds to bury his mother with . I did bury her , and him also , a month after , very respectably too , though he had no claim upon me , except that he came from Stowbury . And I stood godfather to the child , and I 've done my duty by him . But mark my words , what 's bred in the bone will come in the flesh . He was born in a prison , and he 'll die in a prison . "
79647	79651	79653	79653	Hilary	91	" God forbid ! "

79805	79836	79794	79794	Hilary	91	" I 'll take you to town with me if you like . It 'll save you the expense of the omnibus . I suppose you always travel by omnibus ? "

79910	79951	79873	79873	her	91	" Then I do n't want you to know . And you must never try to find it out ; for it is a secret that ought to be kept strictly within the family . Are you to be trusted ? "

Not as regards your marriage , Selina — the man must be a coward who would refuse to marry a woman he cared for , even though her nearest kinsman had been hanged at the Old Bailey — but Ascott himself . The boy is not a bad boy , though he has done wickedly ; but there is a difference between a wicked act and a wicked nature . I mean to save him if I can . "

86750	86780	86746	86746	Hilary	91	" I said that in two days the matter should be arranged , and so it must be , or the man will think we too break our promises . "

87978	87990	87957	87957	she	91	" How much you must have suffered , my poor bairn ! "

88323	88333	88309	88309	Hilary	91	" Now , may I tell you my business ? "
88334	88382	88282	88282	she	91	" Certainly , my dear . When one 's friends are in trouble , the last thing one ought to do is to sit down beside them and moan . Did you come to ask my advice , or had you any definite plan of your own ? "
88383	88387	88309	88309	Hilary	91	" I had . "
88393	88431	88389	88389	Hilary	91	" A very good plan , and very generous in you to think of it . But I see two strong objections : first , whether it can be carried out ; secondly , whether it ought . "
88437	88509	88432	88432	Hilary	91	" Not on my account , my dear , but your own . I often see people making martyrs of themselves for some worthless character on whom the sacrifice is utterly wasted . I object to this , as I would object to throwing myself or my friend into a blazing house , unless I were morally certain there was a life to be saved . Is there in this case ? "
88510	88523	88525	88525	Hilary	91	" I think there is ! I trust in Heaven there is ! "
88545	88600	88542	88542	she	168	" Be it so : that is a matter on which no one can judge except yourself . But on the other matter you ask my advice , and I must give it . To maintain two ladies and pay a debt of eighty pounds out of one hundred a year is simply impossible . "
88601	88623	88432	88432	Hilary	91	" With Johanna 's income and mine it will be a hundred and twenty pounds and some odd shillings a year . "
88624	88705	88706	88706	They	2473	" You accurate girl ! But even with this it can not be done , unless you were to live in a manner so restricted in the commonest comforts that at your sister 's age she would be sure to suffer . You must look on the question from all sides , my dear . You must be just to others as well as to that young man , who seems never to — But I will leave him unjudged . "
88720	88760	88716	88717	Miss Balquidder	168	" I feel certain there is but one rational way of accomplishing the thing if you are bent upon doing it , if your own judgment and conscience tell you it ought to be done . Is it so ? "
88761	88764	88766	88766	Hilary	91	" Yes , "
88781	88841	88770	88772	The old Scotswoman	2474	" Very well . I do n't blame you . I might have done the same myself . Now to my plan . Miss Leaf , have you known me long enough to confer on me the benediction — one of the few that we rich folk possess ' It is more blessed to give than to receive ? ' "
88842	88849	88716	88717	Miss Balquidder	168	" I do n't quite understand . "
88850	88980	88716	88717	Miss Balquidder	168	" Then allow me to explain . I happen to know this creditor of your nephew 's . He being a tailor and outfitter , we have had dealings together in former times , and I know him to be a hard man , an unprincipled man , such a one as no young woman should have to do with , even in business relations . To be in his power , as you would be for some years if your scheme of gradual payment were carried out , is the last thing I should desire for you . Let me suggest another way . Take me for your creditor instead of him . Pay him at once , and I will write you a check for the amount . "
89108	89136	89094	89094	she	91	" You are very good , and I am exceedingly obliged to you ; but I never borrowed money in my life . It is quite impossible . "
89137	89152	89154	89155	Miss Balquidder	168	" Very well ; I can understand your feelings . I beg your pardon , "
89186	89277	89169	89171	the elderly lady	2480	" I am reckoning what is the largest sum per month that you could reasonably be expected to spare , and how you may make the most of what remains . Are you aware that London lodgings are very expensive ? I am thinking that if you were to exchange out of the Kensington shop into another I have at Richmond , I could offer you the first floor above it for much less rent than you pay Mrs. Jones ; and you could have your sister living with you . "
89278	89295	89169	89171	the elderly lady	2480	" Ah ! that would make us both so much happier ! How good you are ! "
89296	89359	89154	89155	Miss Balquidder	168	" You will see I only wish to help you to help yourself ; not to put you under any obligation . Though I can not see any thing so very terrible in your being slightly indebted to an old woman , who has neither chick nor child , and is at perfect liberty to do what she likes with her own . "
89374	89407	89169	89171	the elderly lady	2480	" Forgive me ! But I have such a horror of borrowing money — you must know why after what I have told you of our family . You must surely understand — "
89408	89521	89169	89171	the elderly lady	2480	" I do fully ; but there are limits even to independence . A person who , for his own pleasure , is ready to take money from any body and every body , without the slightest prospect or intention of returning it , is quite different from a friend who in a case of emergency accepts help from another friend , being ready and willing to take every means of repayment , as I knew you were , and meant you to be . I meant , as you suggested , to stop out of your salary so much per month , till I had my eighty pounds sate back again . "
89522	89553	89562	89563	Miss Balquidder	168	" But suppose you never had it back ? I am young and strong ; still I might fall ill — I might die , and you never be repaid . "
89554	89560	89562	89563	Miss Balquidder	168	" Yes , I should , "
89570	89634	89562	89563	Miss Balquidder	168	" You forget , my dear bairn , ' Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of these little ones , ye have done it unto ME . ' ' He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the LORD . ' I have lent Him a good deal at different times , and He has always paid me back with usury . "
89668	89706	89655	89655	her	91	" But do you not think , Miss Balquidder , that one ought to work on , struggle on , to the last extremity , before one accepts an obligation , most of all a money obligation ? "
89707	89780	89781	89781	Hilary	91	" I do , as a general principle . Yet money is not the greatest thing in this world , that a pecuniary debt should be the worst to bear . And sometimes one of the kindest acts you can do to a fellow - creature — one that touches and softens his heart , nay , perhaps wins it to you for life , is to accept a favor from him . "
89786	89929	89781	89781	Hilary	91	" I speak a little from experience . I have not had a very happy life myself ; at least most people would say so if they knew it ; but the Lord has made it up to me by giving me the means of bringing happiness , in money as well as other ways , to other people . Most of us have our favorite luxuries ; this is mine . I like to do people good ; I like , also — though maybe that is a mean weakness — to feel that I do it . If all whom I have been made instrumental in helping had said to me , as you have done , ' I will not be helped , I will not be made happy , ' it would have been rather hard for me . "
90078	90090	90102	90102	Hilary	91	" Well , my bairn , what is to be done ? "
90091	90100	90102	90102	Hilary	91	" I will do whatever you think right , "

91544	91612	91526	91526	he	2529	" of old ; as , a little excited by the event of the morning , she stood by the mantle - piece and contemplated a letter which had come after the ladies departed ; one of these regular monthly Indian letters , after which , Elizabeth was sharp enough to notice , Miss Hilary 's step always grew lighter and her eye brighter for many days . "
91633	91638	91627	91631	somebody to be fond of	2532	" meditated she . And "
91644	91715	91526	91526	he	2529	" as she was — according to Mrs. Jones ( who now , from the use she was in the Jones 's menage , patronized and confided in her extremely ) some little bit of womanly craving after the woman 's one hope and crown of bliss crept into the poor maid - servant 's heart . But it was not for the maid - servant 's usual necessity — a "

91724	91845	91541	91546	bower - maiden " of old	4224	" it was rather for somebody to love , and perhaps take care of a little . People love according to their natures ; and Elizabeth 's was a strong nature ; its principal element being a capacity for passionate devotedness , almost unlimited in extent . Such women , who love most , are not always , indeed very rarely , loved best . And so it was perhaps as well that poor Elizabeth should make up her mind , as she did very composedly , that she herself should never be married ; but after that glorious wedding of Miss Hilary 's to Mr. Lyon , should settle down to take care of Miss Leaf all her days . "
91877	91965	91966	91966	Sir	3469	" stoically said Elizabeth Hand . The words were scarcely out of her mouth when her attention was caught by some one in the passage inquiring for her ; yes , actually for her . She could hardly believe her eyes when she perceived it was her new - found old acquaintance , Tom Cliffe . He was dressed very well , out of livery ; indeed , he looked so extremely like a gentleman that Mrs. Jones 's little girl took him for one , called him "
91968	91976	91966	91966	Sir	3469	" and showed him into the parlor . "
92001	92060	91999	91999	Elizabeth	94	" But Elizabeth was a little stiff , flurried , and perplexed . Her mistresses were out ; she did not know whether she ought to ask Tom in , especially as it must be into the parlor ; there was no other place to take him to . However , Tom settled the matter with a conclusive , "
92063	92137	91999	91999	Elizabeth	94	gammon!"—sat himself down , and made himself quite comfortable . And Elizabeth was so glad to see him — glad to have another chance of talking about dear old Stowbury . It could not be wrong ; she would not say a word about , the family , not even tell him she lived with the Misses Leaf if she could help it . And Tom did not seem in the least curious . "
92273	92274	92265	92265	I	0	" "
92280	92338	92278	92278	Tom	132	" said Elizabeth , pleased , even grateful for the trouble he had taken about her : she had so few friends ; in truth , actually none . They began to talk , and Tom Cliffe talked exceedingly well . He had added to his natural cleverness a degree of London sharpness , the result of much "
92341	92531	92532	92532	I	0	" ever since childhood . Besides , his master , the literary gentleman , who had picked him out of the printing office , had taken a deal of pains with him . Tom was , for his station , a very intelligent and superior young man . Not a boy , though he was still under twenty , but a young man : that precocity of development which often accompanies a delicate constitution , making him appear , as he was indeed , in mind and character , fully six or seven years older than his real age . He was a handsome fellow , too , though small ; dark haired , dark eyed , with regular and yet sensitive and mobile features . Altogether Tom Cliffe was decidedly interesting , and Elizabeth took great pleasure in looking at him , and in thinking , with a certain half motherly , half romantic satisfaction , that but for her , and her carrying him home from under the horse 's heels , he might , humanly speaking , have been long ago buried in Stowbury church yard . "
92544	92558	92559	92559	I	0	" said he , when speaking of this little episode of early life . "
92575	93371	92569	92573	a middle - aged man	2542	" And he shook his head , and looked melancholy and poetical ; nay , even showed Elizabeth some poetry that he himself had written on the subject , which was clever enough in its way . Elizabeth 's interest grew . An ordinary baker or butcher boy would not have attracted her in the least ; but here was something in the shape of a hero , somebody who at once touched her sympathies and roused her admiration . For Tom was quite as well informed as she was herself ; more so , indeed . He was one of the many shrewd and clever working men who were then beginning to rise up and think for themselves , and educate themselves . He attended classes at mechanics ' institutions , and young men 's debating societies ; where every topic of the day , religion , politics , political economy , was handled freely , as the young do handle these serious things . He threw himself , heart and soul , into the new movement , which , like all revolutions , had at first its great and fatal dangers , but yet resulted in much good ; clearing the political sky , and bringing all sorts of hidden abuses under the sharp eyes of that great scourge of evil - doers — public opinion . Yet Elizabeth , reared under the wing of the conservative Misses Leaf , was a little startled when Tom Cliffe , who apparently liked talking and being listened to , gave her a long dissertation on the true principles of the Charter , and how Frost , Williams , and Jones — names all but forgotten now — were very ill - used men , actual martyrs . She was more than startled — shocked indeed — until there came a reaction of the deepest pity — when he confessed that he never went to church . He saw no use in going , he said ; the parsons were all shams , paid largely to chatter about what they did not understand ; the only real religion was that which a man thought out for himself , and acted out for himself . Which was true enough , though only a half truth ; and innocent Elizabeth did not see the other half . But she was touched and carried away by the earnestness and enthusiasm of the lad , wild , fierce iconoclast as he was , ready to cast down the whole fabric of Church and State ; though without any personal hankering after lawless rights and low pleasures . His sole idol was , as he said , intellect , and that was his preservation . Also , the fragile health which was betrayed in every flash of his eye , every flush of his sallow cheek , made Tom Cliffe , even in the two hours he staid with her , come very close to Elizabeth 's heart . It was such a warm heart , such a liberal heart , thinking so little of itself or of its own value . So here began to be told the old story , familiar in kitchens as parlors ; but , from the higher bringing up of the two parties concerned , conducted in this case more after the fashion of the latter than the former . Elizabeth Hand was an exceptional person , and Tom had the sense to see that at once . He paid her no coarse attentions , did not attempt to make love to her ; but he liked her , and he let her see that he did . True , she was not pretty , and she was older than he ; but that to a boy of nineteen is rather flattering than otherwise . Also , for there is a law even under the blind mystery of likings and fallings in love — a certain weakness in him , that weakness which generally accompanies the poetical nature , clung to the quiet , solid , practical strength of hers . He liked to talk and be listened to by those silent , admiring , gentle gray eyes ; and he thought it very pleasant when , with a motherly prudence , she warned him to be careful over his cough , and gave him a flannel breast - plate to protect his chest against the cold . When he went away Tom was so far in love that , following the free and easy ways of his class , he attempted to give Elizabeth a kiss ; but she drew back so hotly that he begged her pardon , and slipped away rather confounded . "
93387	93393	93385	93385	her	3928	" said he to himself . "
93408	93785	93394	93394	I	0	" Meanwhile Elizabeth , having forgotten all about her dinner , sat thinking , actually doing nothing but thinking , until within half an hour of the time when her mistresses might be expected back . They were to go direct to the hotel , breakfast , wait till the newly - married couple had departed , and then come home . They would be sure to be weary , and want their tea . So Elizabeth made every thing ready for them , steadily putting Tom Cliffe out of her mind . One thing she was glad of , that talking so much about his own affairs , he had forgotten to inquire concerning hers , and was still quite ignorant even of her mistresses ' name . He therefore could tell no tales of the Leaf family at Stowbury . Still she determined at once to inform Miss Hilary that he had been here , but that , if she wished it , he should never come again . And it spoke well for her resolve , that while resolving she was startled to find how very sorry she should feel if Tom Cliffe never came again . I know I am painting this young woman with a strangely tender conscience , a refinement of feeling , and a general moral sensitiveness which people say is seldom or never to be found in her rank of life . And why not ? Because mistresses treat servants as servants , and not as women ; because in the sharp , hard line they draw , at the outset , between themselves and their domestics , they give no chance for any womanliness to be developed . And therefore since human nature is weak , and without help from without , a long degraded class can never rise , sweet - hearts will still come crawling through back entries and down at area doors ; mistresses will still have to dismiss helpless and fallen , or brazen in iniquity , many a wretched girl who once was innocent ; or , if nothing actually vicious results , may have many a good , respectable servant , who left to get married , return , complaining that her "
93789	93815	93394	93394	I	0	" whom she knew so little about , has turned out a drunken scoundrel of a husband , who drives her back to her old comfortable "
93817	93883	93944	93944	he	422	" to beg for herself and her starving babies a morsel of bread . When , with a vivid blush that she could not repress , Elizabeth told her mistress that Tom Cliffe had been to see her , the latter replied at first carelessly , for her mind was preoccupied . Then , her attention caught by the aforesaid blush , Miss Hilary asked . "
93890	93891	93887	93888	the lad	422	" "
93894	93895	93887	93888	the lad	422	" "
93919	93920	93921	93921	I	0	" "
93929	93942	93921	93921	I	0	" said Elizabeth , warmly — and honestly , at the time . "
93953	93954	93955	93955	He	422	" "
93959	93960	93955	93955	He	422	" "
93989	94019	94020	94020	Elizabeth	94	" And then a sudden sharp recollection that there would likely be no next time , in their service at least , made Miss Hilary feel quite a hypocrite . "
94022	94026	94020	94020	Elizabeth	94	" said she , "
94072	94222	94223	94223	Johanna	93	" She spoke in an especially gentle tone , so that by no possibility could Elizabeth fancy they were displeased with her . Now , knowing the circumstances of the family , Elizabeth 's conscience had often smitten her that she must eat a great deal , that her wages , paid regularly month by month , must make a great hole in her mistress 's income . She was , alack ! a sad expense , and she tried to lighten her cost in every possible way . But it never struck her that they could do without her , or that any need would arise for their doing so . So she went into the parlor quite unsuspiciously , and found Miss Leaf lying on the sofa , and Miss Hilary reading aloud the letter from India . But it was laid quietly aside as she said , "
94229	94317	94225	94225	Elizabeth	94	" Then Johanna , rousing herself to say what must be said , but putting it as gently and kindly as she could , told Elizabeth , what mistresses often think it below their dignity to tell to servants , the plain truth — namely , that circumstances obliged herself and Miss Hilary to retrench their expenses as much as they possibly could . That they were going to live in two little rooms at Richmond , where they would board with the inmates of the house . "
94324	94350	94225	94225	Elizabeth	94	" Miss Leaf faltered . It was very hard to say it with those eager eyes fixed upon her . Hilary took up the word — "
94382	94386	94379	94380	a servant	246	" No answer . "
94440	94449	94407	94407	We	2552	" And Miss Hilary 's voice too failed . "
94463	94621	94407	94407	We	2552	" Elizabeth , recovered from her first bewildered grief , was on the point of bursting out into entreaties that she might do like many another faithful servant , live without wages , put up with any hardships , rather than be sent away . But something in Miss Hilary 's manner told her it would be useless — worse than useless , painful : and she would do any thing rather than give her mistress pain . When , utterly unable to control it , she gave vent to one loud sob , the expression of acute suffering on Miss Hilary 's countenance was such that she determined to sob no more . She felt that , for some reason or other , the thing was inevitable ; that she must take up her burden , as her mistress had done , even though it were the last grief of all — leaving that beloved mistress . "
94628	94635	94626	94626	Elizabeth	94	" said Miss Hilary , softly . "
94674	94743	94745	94745	you	2559	" She sighed . Possibly there had been sad tidings in the letter which she still held in her hand , clinging to it as we do to something which , however sorely it hurts us , we would not part with for the whole world . But there was no hopelessness or despair in her tone , and Elizabeth caught the influence of that true courageous heart . "
94758	94767	94745	94745	you	2559	" said she , looking toward Miss Leaf . "
94784	94804	94776	94777	Mrs. Jones	153	" and she stopped , afraid lest it might be found out how often Mrs. Jones had urged her to "
94808	94815	94806	94806	herself	0	" and she had indignantly refused . "
94818	94825	94826	94826	I	0	" ( a bright idea occurred ) "
94846	94853	94829	94830	Miss Selina	92	" Hilary looked hard at her . "
94860	94861	94855	94855	you	0	" "
94894	95490	94888	94889	Mrs. Ascott	99	" And Hilary , much surprised — for she was well acquainted with Elizabeth 's sentiments toward both Mr. Ascott and the late Miss Selina—-promised . And now I leave Miss Hilary for a time ; leave her in , if not happiness , great peace . Peace which , after these stormy months , was an actual paradise of calm to both herself and Johanna . Their grief for Ascott had softened down . Its very hopelessness gave it resignation . There was nothing more to be done ; they had done all they could , both to find him out and to save him from the public disgrace which might blight any hope of reformation . Now the result must be left in higher hands . Only at times fits of restless trouble would come ; times when a sudden knock at the door would make Johanna shake nervously for minutes afterward ; when Hilary walked about every where with her mind preoccupied , and her eyes open to notice every chance passerby ; nay , she had sometimes secretly followed down a whole street some figure which , in its light jaunty step and long fashionably - cut hair , reminded her of Ascott . Otherwise they were not unhappy , she and her dearest sister . Poor as they were , they were together , and their poverty had no sting . They knew exactly how much they would receive monthly , and how much they ought to spend . Though obliged to calculate every penny , still their income and expenses were alike certain ; there was no anxiety about money matters , which of itself was an indescribable relief . Also there was that best blessing — peace at home . Never in all her days had Johanna known such an easy life ; sitting quietly in her parlor while Hilary was engaged in the shop below ; descending to dinner , where she took the head of the table , and the young people soon learned to treat her with great respect and even affection ; then waiting for the happy tea in their own room , and the walk afterward , in Richmond Park or along the Thames banks toward Twickenham . Perhaps it was partly from the contrast to that weary year in London , but never , in any spring , had the air seemed so balmy , or the trees so green . They brought back to Hilary 's face the youthful bloom which she had begun to lose ; and , in degree , her youthful brightness , which had also become slightly overclouded . Again she laughed and made her little domestic jokes , and regained her pretty ways of putting things , so that every thing always appeared to have a cheerful , and comical , side . Also — for while we are made as we are , with capacity for happiness , and especially the happiness of love , it is sure to be thus — she had a little private sunbeam in her own heart , which brightened outside things . After that sad letter from India which came on Selina 's wedding day , every succeeding one grew more cheerful , more demonstrative , nay , even affectionate ; though still with that queer Scotch pride of his , that would ask for nothing till it could ask and have every thing , and give every thing in return — the letters were all addressed to Johanna . "
95502	95745	95498	95500	an old woman	3726	" Miss Leaf would sometimes say , mischievously , when she received them . But more often she said nothing , waiting in peace for events to develop themselves . She did not think much about herself , and had no mean jealousy over her child ; she knew that a righteous and holy love only makes all natural affections more sacred and more dear . And Hilary ? She held her head higher and prouder ; and the spring trees looked greener , and the river ran brighter in the sunshine . Ah , Heaven pity us all ! it is a good thing to have love in one 's life ; it is a good thing , if only for a time , to be actually happy . Not merely contented , but happy ! And so I will leave her , this little woman ; and nobody need mourn over her because she is working too hard , or pity her because she is obliged to work ; has to wear common clothes , and live in narrow rooms , and pass on her poor weary feet the grand carriages of the Richmond gentry , who are not a bit more well - born or well - educated than she ; who never take the least notice of her , except sometimes to peer curious at the desk where she sits in the shop - corner , and wonder who "
95754	95795	95746	95753	that young person with the rather pretty curls	2561	" can be . No matter , she is happy . How much happiness was there in the large house at Russell Square ? The Misses Leaf could not tell ; their sister never gave them an opportunity of judging . "
95818	95826	95815	95815	her	3014	" And so , most frequently , is "
95830	96117	95815	95815	her	3014	" But not in this case . It could not be ; they never expected it would . When on here rare visits to town Hilary called at Russell Square she always found Mrs. Ascott handsomely dressed , dignified , and gracious . Not in the slightest degree uncivil or unsisterly , but gracious — perhaps a thought too gracious . Most condescendingly anxious that she should stay to luncheon , and eat and drink the best the house afforded , but never by any chance inviting her to stay to dinner . Consequently , as Mr. Ascott was always absent in the city until dinner , Hilary did not see him for months together , and her brother - in - law was , she declared , no more to her than any other man upon ' Change , or the man in the moon , or the Great Mogul . His wife spoke little about him . After a few faint , formal questions concerning Richmond affairs , somehow her conversation always recurred to her own : the dinners she had been at , those she was going to give ; her carriages , clothes , jewelry , and so on . She was altogether a very great lady , and Hilary , as she avouched laughingly — it was , in this case , better to laugh than to grieve — felt an exceedingly small person beside her . Nevertheless Mrs. Ascott showed no unkindness — nay , among the various changes that matrimony had produced in her , her temper appeared rather to have improved than otherwise ; there was now seldom any trace of that touchy sharpness which used to be called "
96123	96144	96145	96146	Poor Selina	92	" And yet Hilary never quitted the house without saying to herself , with a sigh , the old phrase , "
96148	96491	96145	96146	Poor Selina	92	" Thus , in the inevitable consequences of things , her visits to Russell Square became fewer and fewer ; she kept them up as a duty , not exacting any return , for she felt that was impossible , though still keeping up the ghostly shadow of sisterly intimacy . Nevertheless she knew well it was but a shadow ; that the only face that looked honest , glad welcome , or that she was honestly glad to see in her brother - in - law 's house was the under house - maid , Elizabeth Hand . Contrary to all expectations , Mrs. Ascott had consented to take Elizabeth into her service . With many stipulations and warnings never to presume on past relations , never even to mention Stowbury , on pain of instant dismissal — still , she did take her , and Elizabeth staid . At every one of Miss Hilary 's visits , lying in wait in the bed chamber , or on the staircase , or creeping up at the last minute to open the hall door , was sure to appear the familiar face , beaming all over . Little conversation passed between them — Mrs. Ascott evidently disliked it ; still Elizabeth looked well and happy , and when Miss Hilary told her so she always silently smiled . But this story must tell the whole truth which lay beneath that fond acquiescing smile . Elizabeth was certainly in good health , being well fed , well housed , and leading on the whole an easy life ; happy , too , when she looked at Miss Hilary . But her migration from Mrs. Jones 's lodgings to this grand mansion had not been altogether the translation from Purgatory to Paradise that some would have supposed . The author of this simple story having — unfortunately for it — never been in domestic service , especially in the great houses of London , does not pretend to describe the ins and outs of their "
96497	96702	96703	96703	master	4127	" to repeat kitchen conversations , to paint the humors of the servants ' hall — the butler and housekeeper getting tipsy together , the cook courting the policeman , and the footman making love successively to every house - maid and ladys'-maid . Some writers have depicted all this , whether faithfully or not they know best ; but the present writer declines to attempt any thing of the kind . Her business is solely with one domestic , the country girl who came unexpectedly into this new world of London servant - life — a world essentially its own , and a life of which the upper classes are as ignorant as they are of what goes on in Madagascar and Otabeite . This fact was the first which struck the unsophisticated Elizabeth . She , who had been brought up in a sort of feudal relationship to her dear mistresses , was astonished to find the domestics of Russell Square banded together into a community which , in spite of their personal bickerings and jealousies , ended in alliance offensive and defensive against the superior powers , whom they looked upon as their natural enemies . Invisible enemies , certainly ; for "
96704	96723	96145	96146	Poor Selina	92	" they hardly ever saw ; and , excepting the ladys ' maid , were mostly as ignorant of "
96726	96872	96145	96146	Poor Selina	92	" The housekeeper was the middle link between the two estates — the person with whom all business was transacted , and to whom all complaints had to be made . Beyond being sometimes talked over , generally in a quizzical , depreciatory , or condemnatory way , the heads of the establishment were no more to their domestics than the people who paid wages , and exacted in return certain duties , which most of them made as small as possible , and escaped whenever they could . If this be an exaggerated picture of a state of things perhaps in degree inevitable — and yet it should not be , for it is the source of incalculable evil , this dividing of a house against itself — if I have in any way said what is not true , I would that some intelligent "
96877	96917	96703	96703	master	4127	" would rise up and tell us what is true , and whether it be possible on either side to find means of amending what so sorely needs reformation . Elizabeth sometimes wanted Tom Cliffe to do this — to "
96922	97026	96703	96703	master	4127	" which he , eager young malcontent , was always threatening to do , upon the evils of society , and especially the tyranny of the upper classes . Tom Cliffe was the only person to whom she imparted her troubles and perplexities : how different her life was from that she had been used to ; how among her fellow - servants there was not one who did not seem to think and act in a manner totally opposed to every thing she had learned from Miss Hilary . How consequently she herself was teased , bullied , threatened , or at best "
97031	97037	96703	96703	master	4127	" from morning till night . "
97050	97111	96145	96146	Poor Selina	92	" said she , almost crying , the first Sunday night when she met him accidentally in going to church , and , in her dreary state of mind , was exceedingly glad to see him . He consoled her , and even went to church with her , half promising to do the same next Sunday , and calling her "
97127	97178	97112	97115	a good little Christian	2569	" And so , with the vague feeling that she was doing him good and keeping him out of harm — that lad who had so much that was kindly and nice about him — Elizabeth consented , not exactly to an appointment , but she told him what were her "
97182	97338	97112	97115	a good little Christian	2569	" and the church she usually attended , if he liked to take the chance of her being there . Alack ! she had so few pleasures ; she so seldom got even a breath of outside air — it was not thought necessary for servants . The only hour she was allowed out was the church - going on alternate Sunday evenings . How pleasant it was to creep out then , and see Tom waiting for her under the opposite trees , dressed so smart and gentlemanlike , looking so handsome and so glad to see her — her , the poor countrified Elizabeth , who was quizzed incessantly by her fellow - servants on her oddness , plainness , and stupidity . Tom did not seem to think her stupid , for he talked to her of all his doings and plannings , vague and wild as those of the young tailor in "
97342	97373	97339	97340	Alton Locke	196	" yet with a romantic energy about them that strongly interested his companion ; and he read her his poetry , and addressed a few lines to herself , beginning , "
97383	97908	97339	97340	Alton Locke	196	" which was rather a poetical exaggeration , since he had altogether forgotten her in the interval of their separation . But she never guessed this ; and so they both clung to the early tie , making it out to be ten times stronger than it really was , as people do who are glad of any excuse for being fond of one another . Tom really was getting fond of Elizabeth . She touched the higher half of his nature — the spiritual and imaginative half . That he had it , though only a working - man , and she too , though only a domestic servant , was most true : probably many more of their class have it than we are at all aware of . Therefore , these two being special individuals , were attracted by each other ; she by him , because he was clever , and he by her , because she was so good . For he had an ideal , poor Tom Cliffe ! and though it had been smothered and laid to sleep by a not too regular life , it woke up again under the kind , sincere eyes of this plain , simple - minded , honest Elizabeth Hand . He knew she was plain , and so old - fashioned in her dress , that Tom , who was particular about such things , did not always like walking with her : but she was so interesting and true ; she sympathized with him so warmly ; he found her so unfailingly and unvaryingly good to him through all the little humors and pettishnesses that almost always accompany a large brain , a nervous temperament , and delicate health . Her quietness soothed him , her strength of character supported him ; he at once leaned on her , and ruled over her . As to Elizabeth 's feelings toward Tom , they will hardly bear analyzing ; probably hardly any strong emotion will , especially one that is not sudden but progressive . She admired him extremely , and yet she was half sorry for him . Some things in him she did not at all like , and tried heartily to amend . His nervous fancies , irritations , and vagaries she was exceedingly tender over ; she looked up to him , and yet took care of him ; this thought of him , and anxiety over him , became by degrees the habit of her life . People love in so many different ways ; and perhaps that was the natural way in which a woman like Elizabeth would love , or creep into love without knowing it , which is either the safest or the saddest form which the passion can assume . Thus things went on , till one dark , rainy Sunday night , walking round and round the inner circle of the square , Tom expressed his feelings . At first , in somewhat high flown and poetical phrases , then melting into the one , eternally old and eternally new , "
97914	97952	97910	97910	you	2573	" followed by a long , long kiss , given under shelter of the umbrella , and in mortal fear of the approaching policeman ; who , however , never saw them , or saw them only as "
97957	98039	98040	98041	No followers	4131	hearts"—too common an occurrence on his beat to excite any attention . But to Elizabeth the whole thing was new , wonderful ; a bliss so far beyond any thing that had ever befallen her simple life , and so utterly unexpected therein , that when she went to her bed that night she cried like a child over the happiness of Tom 's loving her , and her exceeding unworthiness of the same . Then difficulties arose in her mind . "
98044	98186	98187	98188	young man	3998	" was one of the strict laws of the Russell Square dynasty . Like many another law of that and of much higher dynasties it was only made to be broken ; for stray sweet - hearts were continually climbing down area railings , or over garden walls , or hiding themselves behind kitchen doors . Nay , to such an extent was the system carried out , each servant being , from self - interest , a safe co - conspirator , that very often when Mr. and Mrs. Ascott went out to dinner , and the old housekeeper retired to bed , there were regular symposia held below stairs — nice little supper - parties , where all the viands in the pantry and the wines in the cellar were freely used ; where every domestic had his or her "
98189	98191	98192	98193	young woman	3928	" or "
98195	98240	98192	98193	young woman	3928	" and the goings - on , though not actually discreditable , were of the most lively kind . To be cognizant of these , and yet to feel that , as there was no actual wickedness going on , she was not justified in "
98243	98264	98192	98193	young woman	3928	" was a severe and perpetual trial to Elizabeth . To join them , or bring Tom among them as her "
98268	98272	98192	98193	young woman	3928	" was impossible . "
98277	98304	98275	98275	Tom	132	" she said , when he begged hard to come in one evening — for it was raining fast , and he had a bad cough — "
98341	98449	98332	98332	I	0	" And yet to do this surreptitiously , just as if she were ashamed of him , or as if there were something wrong in their being fond of one another , jarred upon Elizabeth 's honest nature . She did not want to make a show of him , especially to her fellow - servants : she had the true woman 's instinct of liking to keep her treasures all to herself ; but she had also her sex 's natural yearning for sympathy in the great event of a woman 's life . She would have liked to have somebody unto whom she could say , "
98458	98466	98450	98450	Tom	132	" and who would have answered cordially , "
98485	98568	98472	98472	he	132	" Not that she doubted this : but it would have been an additional comfort to have a mother 's blessing , or a sister 's , or even a friend 's , upon this strange and sweet emotion which had come into her life . So long as it was thus kept secret there seemed a certain incompleteness and unsanctity about even their happy love . Tom did not comprehend this at all . He only laughed at her for feeling so "
98570	98636	98717	98717	you	2581	" ( that means tender , sensitive — but the word is almost unexplainable to other than Stowbury ears ) on the subject . He liked the romance and excitement of secret courtship — men often do ; rarely women , unless there is something in them not quite right , not entirely womanly . But Tom was very considerate , and though he called it "
98639	98713	98717	98717	you	2581	" and took a little fit of crossness on the occasion , he allowed Elizabeth to write to mother about him , and consented that on her next holiday she should go to Richmond , in order to speak to Miss Hilary on the same subject , and ask her also to write to Mrs. Hand , stating how good and clever Tom was , and how exceedingly happy was Tom 's Elizabeth . "
98725	98731	98732	98732	I	0	" asked she , shyly . "
98746	98823	98742	98743	Miss Leaf	91	" Tom , protested he did not care two straws whether they objected or not ; he was a man of twenty , in a good trade — he had lately gone back to the printing , and being a clever workman , earned capital wages . He had a right to choose whom he liked , and marry when he pleased . If Elizabeth did n't care for him , she might leave him alone . "
98828	98962	98826	98826	Tom	132	" was all she answered , with a strange gentleness that no one could have believed would ever have come into the manner of South Sea Islander . And quitting the subject then , she afterward persuaded him , and not for the first time , into consenting to what she thought right . There is something rather touching in a servant 's holiday . It comes so seldom . She must count on it for so long beforehand , and remember it for so long afterward . This present writer owns to a strong sympathy with the holiday - makers on the grand gala - days of the English calendar . It is a pleasure to watch the innumerable groups of family folk , little , children , and prentice lands . — "
98975	98979	98973	98973	Sally	197	" And the various "
98981	99111	99115	99116	a Queen	2583	" and their corresponding swains can hardly feel more regret than she when it happens to be wet weather on Easter week or at Whitsuntide . Whit - Monday , the day when Tom escaped from the printing - office , and Elizabeth got leave of absence for six hours , was as glorious a June day as well could be . As the two young people perched themselves on the top of the Richmond omnibus and drove through Kensington , Hammersmith , Turnham Green , and over Kew Bridge — Tom pointing out all the places , and giving much curious information about them — Elizabeth thought there never was a more beautiful country , or a more lovely summer day : she was , she truly said , "
99118	99339	99115	99116	a Queen	2583	" Neverthless , when the omnibus stopped , she , with great self - denial , insisted on getting rid of Tom for anytime . She thought Miss Hilary might not quite like Tom 's knowing where she lived , or what her occupation was , lest he might gossip about it to Stowbury people ; so she determined to pay her visit by herself , and appointed to meet him at a certain hour on Richmond Bridge , over which bridge she watched him march sulkily , not without a natural pleasure that he should be so much vexed at losing her company for an hour or two . But she knew he would soon come to himself — as he did , before he had been half a mile on the road to Hampton Court , meeting a young fellow he knew , and going with him over that grand old palace , which furnished them with a subject at their next debating society , where they both came out very strong on the question of hypocritical priests and obnoxious kings , with especial reference to Henry VIII , and Cardinal Wolsey . Meanwhile Elizabeth went in search of the little shop — which nobody need expect to find at Richmond now — bearing the well - known name "
99343	99382	99340	99341	Janet Balquidder	200	" Entering it , for there was no private door , she saw , in the far corner above the curtained desk , the pretty curls of her dear Miss Hilary . Elizabeth had long known that her mistress "
99387	99485	99340	99341	Janet Balquidder	200	" and with the notions of gentility which are just as rife in her class as in any other , had mourned bitterly over this fact . But when she saw how fresh and well the young lady looked , how busily and cheerfully she seemed to work with her great books before her , and with what a composed grace and dignity she came forward when asked for , Elizabeth secretly confessed that not even keeping a shop had made or could make the smallest difference in Miss Hilary . She herself was much more changed . "
99497	99539	99495	99495	you	94	" was the involuntary exclamation of her late mistress . She certainly did look very nice ; not smart — for her sober taste preferred quiet colors — but excessively neat and well - dressed . In her new gown of gray "
99542	99586	99588	99590	a lady"—a servant	4484	" her one handsome shawl , which had been honored several times by Miss Hilary 's wearing , her white straw bonnet and white ribbons , underneath which the smooth black hair and soft eyes showed to great advantage , she appeared , not "
99589	99728	99588	99590	a lady"—a servant	4484	lady"—a servant can seldom do that let her dress be ever so fine — but like a thoroughly respectable , intelligent , and pleasant - faced young woman . And her blushes came and went so fast , she was so nervous and yet so beamingly happy , that Miss Hilary soon suspected there was more in this visit than at first appeared . Knowing that with Elizabeth 's great shyness the mystery would never come out in public , she took an opportunity of asking her to help her in the bedroom , and there , with the folding - doors safely shut , discovered the whole secret . Miss Hilary was a good deal surprised at first . She had never thought of Elizabeth as likely to get married at all — and to Tom Cliffe . "
99746	99747	99734	99736	a mere boy	2586	" "
99751	99752	99734	99736	a mere boy	2586	" "
99771	99772	99773	99773	I	0	" "
99777	99784	99773	99773	I	0	" said Elizabeth , somewhat sorrowfully . "
99799	99800	99788	99788	you	2587	" "
99844	99876	99843	99843	you	2587	think"—and the intense humility which true love always has , struck into Miss Hilary 's own conscious heart a conviction of how very true this poor girl 's love must be . "
99901	99902	99843	99843	you	2587	" "
99917	99923	99908	99908	I	0	" was the earnest reply . "
99940	99968	99937	99937	you	2587	" . Miss Hilary stopped ; it seemed so cruel to say such things , and yet she felt bound to say them . She knew her former "
99972	99998	99999	99999	He	2585	" well enough to be convinced that if Elizabeth were not happy in marriage she would be worse than unhappy — might grow actually bad . "
100033	100034	100035	100035	I	0	" "
100047	100200	100043	100043	I	0	" said poor Elizabeth . And , looking at the downcast eyes , at the thorough womanly sweetness and tenderness which suffused the whole face , Hilary 's doubts began to melt away . She thought how sometimes men , captivated by inward rather than outward graces , have fallen in love with plain women , or women older than themselves , and actually kept to their attachment through life , with a fidelity rare as beautiful . Perhaps this young fellow , who seemed by all accounts superior to his class — having had the sense to choose that pearl in an oyster - shell , Elizabeth Hand — might also have the sense so appreciate her , and go on loving her to the end of his days , Anyhow , he loved her now , and she loved him ; and it was useless reasoning any more about it . "
100205	100212	100203	100203	Elizabeth	94	" cried her mistress , cheerfully , "
100253	100254	100256	100256	you	94	" "
100261	100290	100256	100256	you	94	" and with a visible brightening up Elizabeth betrayed Tom 's whereabouts , and her little conspiracy to bring him here , and her hesitation lest it might be "
100293	100294	100256	100256	you	94	" "
100364	100365	100366	100366	I	0	" "
100386	100397	100382	100382	he	132	" said Elizabeth , so energetically that Miss Hilary smiled . "
100425	100492	100494	100496	a real angel	2600	" At that interview , which of course was rather trying , Tom acquitted himself to every body 's satisfaction . He was manly , modest , self - possessed ; did not say much — his usual talkativeness being restrained by the circumstances of the case , and the great impression made upon him by Miss Hilary , who , he afterward admitted to Elizabeth , "
100507	100834	100499	100499	he	132	" But the little he did say gave the ladies a very good impression of the intelligence and even refinement of Elizabeth 's sweet - heart . And though they were sorry to see him look so delicate , still there was a something better than handsomeness in his handsome face , which made them not altogether surprised at Elizabeth 's being so fond of him . As she watched the young couple down Richmond Street , in the soft summer twilight — Elizabeth taking Tom 's arm , and Tom drawing up his stooping figure to its utmost extent , both a little ill - matched in height as they were in some other things , but walking with that air of perfect confidence and perfect contentedness in each other which always betrays , to a quick eye , those who have agreed to walk through the world together — Miss Hilary turned from the window and sighed . Following Miss Hilary 's earnest advice that every thing should be fair and open , Elizabeth , on the very next day after that happy Whit - Monday , mustered up her courage , asked permission to speak to her mistress , and told her she was going to be married to Tom Cliffe : not immediately , but in a year 's time or so , if all went well . Mrs. Ascott replied sharply that it was no affair of hers , and she could not be troubled about it . For her part she thought , if servants knew their own advantages , they would keep a good place when they had it , and never get married at all . And then , saying she had heard a good character of her from the housekeeper , she offered Elizabeth the place of upper house - maid , a young girl , a protegee of the housekeeper 's , being substituted in hers . "
100877	101000	101277	101277	Master	4127	" But Elizabeth had her own private opinion on that matter . She was but a woman , poor thing ! and two tiny rooms of her own , with Tom to care for and look after , seemed a far happier home than that great house , where she had not only her own work to do , but the responsibility of teaching and taking charge of that careless , stupid , pretty Esther , who had all the forwardness , untidiness , and unconscientiousness of a regular London maid - servant , and was a sore trial to the staid , steady Elizabeth . Tom consoled her , in his careless but affectionate way ; and another silent consolation was the "
101006	101276	101277	101277	Master	4127	" bought out of her additional wages , which she began to put by in her box — sticks and straws for the new sweet nest that was a - building : a metal teapot , two neat glass salt - cellars , and , awful extravagance!—two real second - hand silver spoons — Tom did so like having things nice about him ! These purchases , picked up at stray times , were solid , substantial and useful ; domestic rather than personal ; and all with a view to Tom rather than herself . She hid them with a magpie - like closeness , for Esther and she shared the same room ; but sometimes when Esther was asleep she would peep at them with an anxious , lingering tenderness , as if they made more of an assured reality what even now seemed so very like a dream . — Except , indeed , on those Sunday nights when Tom and she went to church together and afterward took a walk , but always parted at the corner of the square . She never brought him in to the house , nor spoke of him to her fellow servants . How much they guessed of her engagement she neither knew nor cared . Mrs. Ascott , too , had apparently quite forgotten it . She seemed to take as little interest in her servants ' affairs as they in hers . Nevertheless , ignorant as the lower regions were in general of what was passing in the upper , occasionally rumors began to reach the kitchen that "
101288	101327	101284	101284	Missis	134	" And once , after the solemn dinner , with three footmen to wait on two people , was over , Elizabeth , passing through the hall , caught the said domestics laughing together , and saying it was "
101342	101345	101284	101284	Missis	134	" After which "
101350	101390	101277	101277	Master	4127	" became a favorite joke in the servants ' hall . But still Mr. Ascott went out daily after breakfast , and came home to dinner ; and Mrs. Ascott spent the morning in her private sitting room , or "
101393	101626	101277	101277	Master	4127	" as she called it ; lunched , and drove out in her handsome carriage , with her footman behind ; dressed elegantly for dinner , and presided at her own table with an air of magnificent satisfaction in all things . She had perfectly accommodated herself to her new position ; and if under her satins and laces beat a solitary , dissatisfied , or aching heart , it was nobody 's business but her own . At least , she kept up the splendid sham with a most creditable persistency . But all shams are dangerous things . Be the surface ever so smooth and green , it will crack sometimes , and a faint wreath of smoke betray the inward volcano . The like had happened once or twice , as on the day when the men - servants were so intensely amused . Also Elizabeth , when putting in order her mistress 's bedroom , which was about the hour Mr. Ascott left for the city , had several times seen Mrs. Ascott come in there suddenly , white and trembling . Once , so agitated was she , that Elizabeth had brought her a glass of water ; and instead of being angry or treating her with the distant dignity which she had always kept up her mistress had said , almost in the old Stowbury tone , "
101632	101670	101630	101630	Elizabeth	94	" However , Elizabeth had the wisdom to take no notice , but to slip from the room , and keep her own counsel . At last one day the smouldering domestic earthquake broke out . There was "
101676	101736	101630	101630	Elizabeth	94	" the footman suspected , at the breakfast - table ; and after breakfast , Master , without waiting for the usual attendance of that functionary , with his hat and gloves and a Hansom cab had flung himself out at the hall door , slamming it after him with a noise that startled the whole house . Shortly afterward "
101739	101888	101630	101630	Elizabeth	94	" bell had rung violently , and she had been found lying on the floor of her bedroom in a dead faint , her maid , a foolish little Frenchwoman , screaming over her . The frightened servants gathered round in a cluster , but nobody attempted to touch the poor lady , who lay rigid and helpless , hearing none of the comments that were freely made upon her , or the conjectures as to what Master had done or said that produced this state of things . Mistress she was , and these four or five woman , her servants , had lived in her house for months , but nobody loved her ; nobody knew any thing about her ; nobody thought of doing aught for her , till a kitchen - maid , probably out of former experience in some domestic emergency , suggested , "
101892	101956	101630	101630	Elizabeth	94	" The advice was eagerly caught at , every body being so thankful to have the responsibility shifted to some other body 's shoulders ; so in five minutes Elizabeth had the room cleared , and her mistress laid upon the bed , with nobody near except herself and the French maid . By - and - by Mrs. Ascott opened her eyes . "
101968	101969	101963	101963	you	94	" "
101981	102015	101979	101979	Elizabeth	94	" At the familiar soothing voice the poor woman — a poor , wretched , forlorn woman she looked , lying there , in spite of all her grandeur — turned feebly round . "
102030	102069	102070	102071	The doctor	656	" And she fainted away once more . It was some time before she came quite to herself , and then the first thing she said was to bid Elizabeth bolt the door and keep every body out . "
102078	102079	102070	102071	The doctor	656	" "
102100	102182	102098	102098	I	0	" She pulled Elizabeth closer to her , whispered something in her ear , and then burst into a violent fit of hysterical weeping . Amazed , shocked , Elizabeth at first did not know what to do ; then she took her mistress 's head on her shoulder , and quieted her by degrees almost as she would a child . The sobbing ceased , and Mrs. Ascott lay still a minute , till suddenly she clutched Elizabeth 's arm . "
102225	102264	102215	102215	I	0	" She spoke with a fierceness that was hardly credible either in the dignified Mrs. Peter Ascott or the languid Miss Selina . To think of Miss Selina expecting a baby ! The idea perfectly confounded poor Elizabeth . "
102275	102281	102265	102265	I	0	" said she , deprecatingly ; "
102328	102367	102382	102382	your	3015	" Mrs. Ascott lifted her heavy eyes to the kindly , sympathetic , womanly face — thorough woman , for , as Elizabeth went on , her heart warmed with the strong instinct which comes almost of itself . "
102405	102419	102422	102422	ma'am	3015	" Here Elizabeth 's voice quite faltered over the picture she had drawn . "
102435	102537	102427	102427	you	3015	" Human nature is strong . This cold , selfish woman , living her forty years without any strong emotion , marrying without love , and reaping , not in contrition , but angry bitterness , the certain punishment of such a marriage , even this woman was not proof against the glorious mystery of maternity , which should make every daughter of Eve feel the first sure hope of her first born child to be a sort of Divine annunciation . Mrs. Ascott lay listening to Elizabeth . Gradually through her shut eyelids a few quiet tears began to flow . "
102550	102551	102539	102539	you	3015	" "
102581	102604	102576	102579	a very miserable woman	2613	" Strange that Selina Ascott should come to betray , and to Elizabeth Hand , of all people , that she was a "
102608	102661	102576	102579	a very miserable woman	2613	" But circumstances bring about unforeseen confidences ; and the confidence once given is not easily recalled . Apparently the lady did not wish to recall it . In the solitude of her splendid house , in her total want of all female companionship — for she refused to have her sisters sent for—"he
102674	102803	102576	102579	a very miserable woman	2613	insulted"—poor Selina clung to her old servant as the only comfort she had . During the dreary months that followed , when , during the long , close summer days , the sick lady scarcely stirred from her bedroom , and , fretful , peevish , made the very most of what to women in general are such patiently borne and sacred sufferings , Elizabeth was her constant attendant . She humored all her whims , endured all her ill - tempers , cheered her in her low spirits , and was , in fact , her mistress 's sole companion and friend . This position no one disputed with her . It is not every woman who has , as Miss Leaf used to say of Elizabeth , "
102809	103301	102576	102579	a very miserable woman	2613	" and very few patients make nursing a labor of love . The whole household were considerably relieved by her taking a responsibility for which she was so well fitted and so little envied . Even Mr. Ascott , who , when his approaching honors could no longer be concealed from him , became for the nonce a most attentive husband , and succumbed dutifully to every fancy his wife entertained , openly expressed his satisfaction in Elizabeth , and gave her one or two bright golden guineas in earnest of his gratitude . How far she herself appreciated her new and important position ; whether her duties were done from duty , or pity , or that determined self - devotedness which some women are always ready to carry out toward any helpless thing that needs them , I can not say , for she never told . Not even to Miss Hilary , who at last was permitted to come and pay a formal visit ; nor to Tom Cliffe , whom she now saw very rarely , for her mistress , with characteristic selfishness , would hardly let her out of her sight for half an hour . Tom at first was exceedingly savage at this : by degrees he got more reconciled , and met his sweet - heart now and then for a few minutes at the area gate or wrote her long poetical letters , which he confided to some of her fellow - servants , who thereby got acquainted with their secret . But it mattered little , as Elizabeth had faithfully promised that , when her mistress 's trial was over , and every thing smooth and happy , she would marry Tom at once . So she took the jokes below stairs with great composure ; feeling , indeed , too proud and content to perplex herself much about any thing . Nevertheless , her life was not easy , for Mrs. Ascott was very difficult to manage . She resisted angrily all the personal sacrifices entailed by impending motherhood , and its terrors and forebodings used to come over her — poor weak woman that she was!—in a way that required all Elizabeth 's reasonings to counteract , and all her self - control to hide the presentiment of evil , not unnatural under the circumstances . Yet sometimes poor Mrs. Ascott would take fits of pathetic happiness ; when she busied herself eagerly over the preparations for the new - comer ; would make Elizabeth take out , over and over again , the little clothes , and examine them with childish delight . Sometimes she would gossip for hours over the blessing that was sent to her so late in life — half - regretting that it had come so late ; that she should be almost an old woman before her little son or daughter was grown up . "
103386	103409	103384	103384	she	3542	" For more and more , in the strange softening of her nature , did Selina go back to the old ties . "
103484	103610	103478	103478	you	0	" And Elizabeth answered as she best could . She too , out of sympathy or instinct , was becoming wondrous wise . But I am aware all this will be thought very uninteresting , except by women and mothers . Let me hasten on . By degrees , as Mrs. Ascott 's hour approached , a curious tranquility and even gentleness came over her . Her fretful dislike of seeing any face about her but Elizabeth 's became less . She even endured her husband 's company for an hour of an evening ; and at last humbled her pride enough to beg him to invite her sisters to Russell Square from Saturday to Monday , the only time when Hilary could be spared . "
103620	103634	103478	103478	you	0	" said she to him , rather seriously . And though he answered , "
103639	103798	103478	103478	you	0	" and desired her to get such ridiculous fancies out , of her head , still he consented , and himself wrote to Miss Leaf , giving the formal invitation . The three sisters spent a happy time together , and Hilary made some highly appreciated family jokes about the handsome Christmas box that Selina was going to be so kind as to give them , and the small probability that she would have much enjoyment of the Christmas dinner to which Mr. Ascott , in the superabundance of his good feeling , had invited his sisters - in - law . The baby , blessed innocent ! seemed to have softened down all things — as babies often do . Altogether , it was with great cheerfulness , affectionateness , and hope that they took leave of Selina : she , with unwonted consideration , insisting that the carriage should convey them all the way to Richmond . "
103801	103805	103478	103478	you	0	" she said , "
103855	104183	104184	104185	Poor Tom	132	" When the ladies were away , and Mrs. Ascott had retired to bed , it was still only nine o'clock , and a bright moonlight night . Elizabeth thought she could steal down stairs and try to get a breath of fresh air round the square . Her long confinement made her almost sick sometimes for a sight of the outer world , a sight of — let me tell the entire truth — her own faithful Tom . She had not seen him now for fourteen days , and though his letters were very nice and exceedingly clever , still she craved for a look at his face , a grasp of his hand , perhaps even a kiss , long and close and tender , such as he would sometimes insist upon giving her , in spite of all policemen . His love for her , demonstrative as was his nature , had become to this still , quiet girl inexpressibly sweet , far sweeter than she knew . It was a clear winter night , and the moon went climbing over the fleecy white clouds in a way that made beauty even in Russell Square . Elizabeth looked up at the sky , and thought how Tom would have enjoyed it , and wished he were beside her , and was so glad to think he would soon be beside her always , with all his humors and weaknesses , all his little cross - selfishness , and complainings ; she could put up with all , and be happy through all , if only she had him with her and loving her . His love for her , though fitful and fanciful , was yet so warm and real that it had become a necessity of her life . As he always told her — especially after he had had one of his little quarrels with her — hers was to him . "
104205	104392	103836	103837	Henry Leaf	97	" And she wished she could have let him know she was out here , that they might have had a chat for just ten minutes . Unconsciously she walked toward their usual trysting place , a large overhanging plane - tree on the Keppel Street corner of the square . Surely , surely , that could not be Tom ! Quite impossible , for he was not alone . Two people , a young man and a young woman , stood at the tryst , absorbed in conversation : evidently sweethearts , for he had one arm round her , and he kissed her unresisted several times . Elizabeth gazed , fascinated , almost doubting the evidence of her own senses . For the young men 's figure was so excessively like Tom 's . At length , with the sort of feeling that makes one go steadily up to a shadow by the roadside , some ugly spectre that we feel sure , if we stare it out , will prove to be a mere imagination , she walked deliberately up to and past these "
104395	104654	103836	103837	Henry Leaf	97	" They did not see her ; they were far too much occupied with one another ; but she saw them , and saw at once that it was Tom , Tom 's own self , and with him her fellow - servant , Esther . People may write volumes on jealousy , and volumes will still remain to be written . It is next to remorse for guilt , the sharpest , sorest , most maddening torment that human nature can endure . We may sit and gaze from the boxes at our Othellos and Biancas ; we may laugh at the silly heart - burnings between Cousin Kate and Cousin Lucy in the ball - room , or the squabbles of Mary and Sally in the kitchen over the gardener 's lad ; but there the thing remains . A man can not make love to two women , a woman can not coquet with two men , without causing in degree that horrible agony , cruel as death , which is at the root of half the tragedies , and the cause of half the crimes of this world . The complaint comes in different forms : sometimes it is a case of slow poisoning or of ordeal by red - hot irons , which though not fatal , undermines the whole character , and burns ineffaceable scars into the soul . And people take it in various ways — some fiercely , stung by a sense of wounded self - love ; others haughtily : "
104670	104986	103836	103837	Henry Leaf	97	" Others , again , humble , self - distrustful natures , whose only pride came through love , have nothing left them except rags . In a moment all their thin robes of happiness are torn off ; they stand shivering , naked and helpless before the blasts of the bitter world . This was Elizabeth 's case . After the first instant of stunned bewilderment and despair she took it all quite naturally , as if it were a thing which she ought all along to have known was sure to happen , and which was no more than she expected and deserved . She passed the couple , still unobserved by them , and then walked round the other side of the square , deliberately home . I am not going to make a tragic heroine of this poor servant girl . Perhaps , people may say , there is nothing tragic about the incident . Merely a plain , quiet , old - fashioned woman , who is so foolish as to like a handsome young swain , and to believe in him , and to be surprised when he deserts her for a pretty girl of eighteen . All quite after the way things go on in the world , especially in the servant - world ; and the best she can do is to get over it , or take another sweetheart as quickly as possible . A very common story after all , and more of a farce than a tragedy . But there are some farces which , if you look underneath the surface , have a good many of the elements of tragedy . I shall neither paint Elizabeth tearing her own hair nor Esther 's , nor going raging about the square in moonlight in an insane fit of jealousy . She was not given to "
104988	105349	105350	105354	The Lady of Peter Ascott	207	" under any circumstances , or about any thing . All she felt went deep down into her heart , rooted itself , and either blossomed or cankered there . On this night she , as I said , walked round the square to her home : then quietly went up stairs to her garret , locked the door , and sat down upon her bed . She might have sat there for an hour or more , her bonnet and shawl still on , without stirring , without crying , altogether cold and hard like a stone , when she fancied she heard her mistress 's bell ring , and mechanically rose up and went down stairs to listen . Nothing was wanted , so she returned to her garret and crept to bed in the dark . When soon afterward Esther likewise came up to bed , Elizabeth pretended to be asleep . Only once , taking a stealthy glance at the pretty girl who stood combing her hair at the looking - glass , she was conscious of a sick sense of repulsion , a pain like a knife running thro ' her , at sight of the red young lips which Tom had just been kissing , of the light figure which he had clasped as he used to clasp her . But she never spoke , not one word . Half an hour after she was roused by the nurse coming to her bedside . Mrs. Ascott was very ill , and was calling for Elizabeth . Soon the whole establishment was in confusion , and in the sharp struggle between birth and death Elizabeth had no time to think of any thing but her mistress . Contrary to every expectation , all ended speedily and happily ; and before he went off to the City next day the master of the house , who , in the midst of his anxiety and felicity , had managed to secure a good night 's sleep and a good breakfast , had the pleasure of sending off a special messenger to the Times office with the notification , "
105365	105437	105356	105357	Esq .	319	" A fortnight 's time rather increased than diminished the excitement incident on the event at Russell Square . Never was there such a wonderful baby , and never was there such a fuss made over it . Unprejudiced persons might have called it an ugly , weakly little thing ; indeed , at first there were such apprehensions of its dying that it had been baptized in a great hurry , "
105442	105468	105438	105440	Henry Leaf Ascott	97	" according to the mother 's desire , which in her critical position nobody dared to thwart . Even at the end of fourteen days the "
105472	105576	105356	105357	Esq .	319	" was still a puling , sickly , yellow - faced baby . But to the mother it was every thing . From the moment she heard its first cry Mrs. Ascott 's whole nature seemed to undergo a change . Her very eyes — those cold blue eyes of Miss Selina's — took a depth and tenderness whenever she turned to look at the little bundle that lay beside her . She never wearied of touching the tiny hands and feet , and wondering at them , and showing — to every one of the household who was favored with a sight of it—"my
105579	105720	105356	105357	Esq .	319	" as if it had been a miracle of the universe . She was so unutterably happy and proud . Elizabeth , too , seemed not a little proud of the baby . To her arms it had first been committed ; she had stood by at its first washing and dressing , and had scarcely left it or her mistress since . Nurse , a very grand personage , had been a little jealous of her at first , but soon grew condescending , and made great use of her in the sick room , alleging that such an exceedingly sensible young person , so quiet and steady , was almost as good as a middle - aged married woman . Indeed , she once asked Elizabeth if she was a widow , since she looked as if she had "
105724	105770	105771	105771	Elizabeth	94	" and was very much surprised to learn she was single and only twenty - three years old . Nobody else took any notice of her . Even Miss Hilary was so engrossed by her excitement and delight over the baby that she only observed , "
105789	105796	105771	105771	Elizabeth	94	" And Elizabeth had just answered , "
105797	105854	105863	105863	he	2638	Yes"-no more . During the fortnight she had seen nothing of Tom . He had written her a short note or two , and the cook told her he had been to the kitchen door several times asking for her , but being answered that she was with her mistress up stairs , had gone away . "
105887	105968	105880	105880	I	0	" said Cookie , who , like all the other servants , was now exceedingly civil to Elizabeth . Her star had risen ; she was considered in the household a most fortunate woman . It was shortly understood that nurse — majestic nurse , had spoken so highly of her , that at the month 's end the baby was to be given entirely into her charge , with , of course , an almost fabulous amount of wages . "
105971	105996	105997	105997	you	94	" said Mrs. Ascott , when this proposition was made , suddenly recurring to the fact which seemed hitherto to have quite slipped from her mind—"unless
106038	106039	106030	106030	me	0	" "
106045	106202	106041	106041	you	0	" answered Elizabeth , softly , and busied herself with walking baby up and down the room , hushing it on her shoulder . If in the dim light tears fell on its puny face , God help her , poor Elizabeth ! Mrs. Ascott made such an excellent recovery that in three weeks ' time nobody was the least anxious about her , and Mr. Ascott arranged to start on a business journey to Edinburgh ; promising , however , to be back in three days for the Christmas dinner , which was to be a grand celebration . Miss Leaf and Miss Hilary were to appear thereat in their wedding dresses ; and Mrs. Ascott herself took the most vital interest in Johanna 's having a new cap for the occasion . Nay , she insisted upon ordering it from her own milliner , and having it made of the most beautiful lace — the "
106204	106358	106359	106359	Papa	211	" old lady 's cap that could possibly be invented . Evidently this wonderful baby had opened all hearts , and drawn every natural tie closer . Selina , lying on the sofa , in her graceful white wrapper , and her neat close cap , looked so young , so pretty , and , above all , so exceedingly gentle and motherly , that her sisters ' hearts were full to overflowing . They acknowledged that happiness , like misery , was often brought about in a fashion totally unforeseen and incredible . Who would have thought , for instance , on that wretched night when Mr. Ascott came to Hilary at Kensington , or on that dreary heartless wedding - day , that they should ever have been sitting in Selina 's room so merry and comfortable , admiring the baby , and on the friendliest terms with baby 's papa ? "
106360	106380	106041	106041	you	0	" is a magical word , and let married people have fallen ever so wide asunder , the thought , "
106386	106387	106388	106391	my baby 's father	2643	" "
106393	106517	106518	106518	Peter	202	" must in some degree bridge the gulf between them . When Peter Ascott was seen stooping , awkwardly enough , over his son 's cradle , poking his dumpy fingers into each tiny cheek in a half - alarmed , half - investigating manner , as if he wondered how it had all come about , but , on the whole , was rather pleased than otherwise — the good angel of the household might have stood by and smiled , trusting that the ghastly skeleton therein might in time crumble away into harmless dust , under the sacred touch of infant fingers . The husband and wife took a kindly , even affectionate leave of one another . Mrs. Ascott called him "
106520	106632	106518	106518	Peter	202	" and begged him to take care of himself , and wrap up well that cold night . And when he was gone , and her sisters also , she lay on her sofa with her eyes open , thinking . What sort of thoughts they were , whether repentant or hopeful , solemn or tender , whether they might have passed away and been forgotten , or how far they might have influenced her life to come , none knew , and none ever did know . When there came a knock at the door , and a message for Elizabeth , Mrs. Ascott suddenly overheard it and turned round . "
106707	106708	106699	106699	I	0	" "
106714	106848	106710	106710	you	0	" said Elizabeth once more , and obeyed . She must speak to Tom some time , it might as well be done to - night as not . Without pausing to think , she went down with dull heavy steps to the housekeeper 's room . Tom stood there alone . He looked so exactly his own old self , he came forward to meet her so completely in his old familiar way , that for the instant she thought she must be under some dreadful delusion ; that the moonlight night in the square must have been all a dream ; Esther , still the silly little Esther , whom Tom had often heard of and laughed at ; and Tom , her own Tom , who loved nobody but her . "
106865	106875	106877	106877	his	2651	" But though the manner was warm as ever , "
106900	106913	106886	106886	Duty	212	" and quiet as she stood , Elizabeth shivered in his arms . "
106939	106954	106955	106955	Tom	132	" He took it ; and she crept away from him and sat down . "
106975	106976	106967	106967	I	0	" "
106992	106995	107002	107002	I	0	Or"—looking uneasily at her—"I
107004	107005	107002	107002	I	0	" "
107009	107034	107002	107002	I	0	" she repeated , thinking what a small foolish word it was to express what had happened , and what she had been suffering . "
107081	107102	107057	107057	you	132	" Though there was no anger in the voice it was so serious and deliberate that it made Tom start . "
107113	107114	107117	107117	you	132	" "
107136	107137	107129	107129	you	132	" "

107174	107178	107171	107171	you	132	" muttered Tom . "
107207	107227	107205	107205	she	201	" For a moment Tom looked altogether confounded . Then he tried to recover himself , and said crossly , "
107260	107284	107285	107285	Tom	132	" Elizabeth made no answer , at least not immediately . At last she said , in a very gentle , subdued voice , "
107319	107354	107313	107313	you	132	" And she looked right up into his eyes . Hers had no reproach in them , only a piteous entreaty , the last clinging to a hope which she knew to be false . "
107378	107379	107363	107363	She	201	" "
107426	107434	107435	107435	I	0	" Tom laughed in a confused manner . "
107450	107542	107543	107543	Tom	132	" Was she jealous ? was it all fancy , folly ? Did Tom stand there , true as steel , without a feeling in his heart that she did not share , without a hope in which she was not united , holding her , and preferring her , with that individuality and unity of love which true love ever gives and exacts , as it has a right to exact ? Not that poor Elizabeth reasoned in this way , but she felt the thing by instinct without reasoning . "
107545	107549	107551	107551	me	0	" she said , "
107577	107614	107574	107575	Esther Martin	201	" Truthful people enforce truth . Tom might be fickle , but he was not deceitful ; he could not look into Elizabeth 's eyes and tell her a deliberate lie ; somehow he dared not . "
107633	107637	107628	107628	I	0	" So Elizabeth 's "
107642	107779	107628	107628	I	0	" It might have been a very frail vessel , that nobody in their right senses would have trusted any treasure with , still she did ; and it was all she had , and it went down to the bottom like a stone . It is astonishing how soon the sea closes over this sort of wreck ; and how quietly people take — when they must take , and there is no more disbelieving it — the truth which they would have given their lives to prove was an impossible lie . For some minutes Tom stood facing the fire , and Elizabeth sat on her chair opposite without speaking . Then she took off her brooch , the only love - token he had given her , and put it into his hand . "
107785	107791	107792	107792	You	2669	" asked he , suddenly . "
107815	107859	107860	107860	I	0	" And the thought of Esther , giddy , flirting , useless Esther , as Tom 's wife , was almost more than she could bear . The sting of it put even into her crushed humility a certain honest self - assertion . "
107917	107927	107909	107909	You	0	" Tom said , the usual excuse , that he "
107933	107959	107909	107909	You	0	" And suddenly turning round , he begged her to forgive him , and not forsake him . She forsake Tom ! Elizabeth almost smiled . "
107984	107985	107978	107978	I	0	" "
108008	108009	108000	108000	I	0	" "
108013	108019	108000	108000	I	0	" she said , sadly , "
108051	108052	108045	108045	I	0	" "
108059	108060	108061	108061	Your	0	" "
108143	108211	108212	108212	I	0	" She spoke strongly , unhesitatingly , and for an instant there flowed out of her soft eyes that wild fierce spark , latent even in these quiet humble natures , which is dangerous to meddle with . Tom did not attempt it . He felt all was over . Whether he had lost or gained : whether he was glad or sorry , he hardly knew . "
108224	108228	108212	108212	I	0	" he said , "
108230	108317	108319	108319	me	0	" with the brooch ; and then going up to her , he attempted , with trembling hands , to refasten it in her collar . The familiar action , his contrite look , were too much . People who have once loved one another , though the love is dead ( for love can die ) , are not able to bury it all at once , or if they do , its pale ghost will still come knocking at the door of their hearts , "
108326	108383	108319	108319	me	0	" Elizabeth ought , I know , in proper feminine dignity , to have bade Tom farewell without a glance or a touch . But she did not . When he had fastened her brooch she looked up in his familiar face a sorrowful , wistful , hungering look , and then clung about his neck : "
108396	108479	108389	108389	I	0	" And Tom mingled his tears with hers , and kissed her many times , and even felt his old affection returning , making him half oblivious of Esther ; but mercifully — for love rebuilt upon lost faith is like a house founded upon sands — the door opened , and Esther herself came in . Laughing , smirking , pretty Esther , who , thoughtless as she was , had yet the sense to draw back when she saw them . "
108485	108495	108496	108496	Esther	201	" Elizabeth called , imperatively ; and she came . "
108528	108650	108520	108520	I	0	" She could not say another word . She shut the door upon them , and crept up stairs , conscious only of one thought — if she only could get away from them , and never see either of their faces any more ! And in this fate was kind to her , though in that awful way in which fate — say rather Providence — often works ; cutting , with one sharp blow , some knot that our poor , feeble , mortal fingers have been long laboring at in vain , or making that which seemed impossible to do the most natural , easy , and only thing to be done . How strangely often in human life "
108661	108720	108520	108520	I	0	" How continually , while one of those small private tragedies that I have spoken of is being enacted within , the actors are called upon to meet some other tragedy from without , so that external energy counteracts inward emotion , and holy sympathy with another 's sufferings stifles all personal pain . That truth about sorrows coming "
108723	108770	108520	108520	I	0	" may have a divine meaning in it — may be one of those mysterious laws which guide the universe — laws that we can only trace in fragments , and guess at the rest , believing , in deep humility , that one day we shall "
108778	108949	108520	108520	I	0	" Therefore I ask no pity for Elizabeth , because ere she had time to collect herself , and realize in her poor confused mind that she had indeed said good by to Tom , given him up and parted from him forever , she was summoned to her mistress 's room , there to hold a colloquy outside the door with the seriously - perplexed nurse . One of those sudden changes had come which sometimes , after all seems safe , strike terror into a rejoicing household , and end by carrying away , remorseless , the young wife from her scarcely tasted bliss , the mother of many children from her close circle of happy duties and yearning loves . Mrs. Ascott was ill . Either she had taken cold or been too much excited , or , in the overconfidence of her recovery , some slight neglect had occurred — some trifle which nobody thinks of till afterward , and which yet proves the fatal cause , "
108953	108955	108520	108520	I	0	" that "
108961	109087	109088	109088	I	0	" of mortal hope , and King Death enters in all his awful state . Nobody knew it or dreaded it ; for though Mrs. Ascott was certainly ill , she was not at first very ill ; and there being no telegraphs in those days no one thought of sending for either her husband or her sisters . But that very hour , when Elizabeth went up to her mistress , and saw the flush on her cheek and the rest - less expression of her eye , King Death had secretly crept in at the door of the mansion in Russell Square . The patient was carefully removed back into her bed . She said little , except once , looking up uneasily — "
109097	109192	109088	109088	I	0	" And when her servant soothed her in the long - familiar way , telling her she would be better in the morning , she smiled contentedly , and turned to go to sleep . Nevertheless , Elizabeth did not go to her bed , but sat behind the curtain , motionless , for an hour or more . Toward the middle of the night , when her baby was brought to her , and the child instinctively refused its natural food , and began screaming violently , Mrs. Ascott 's troubled look returned . "
109221	109255	109218	109218	I	0	" And when , to sooth her , the little thing was again put into her arms , and again turned from her , a frightened expression came into the mother 's face . "
109264	109563	109564	109565	Poor Missis	134	" She stopped ; and as nurse determinately carried it away , she attempted no resistance , only followed it across the room with eager eyes . It was the last glimmer of reason there . From that time her , mind began to wander , and before morning she was slightly delirious . Still nobody apprehended danger . Nobody really knew any thing about the matter except nurse , and she , with a selfish fear of being blamed for carelessness , resisted sending for the doctor till his usual hour of calling . In that large house , as in many other large houses , every body 's business was nobody 's business , and a member of the family , even the mistress , might easily be sick or dying in some room therein , while all things else went on just as usual , and no one was any the wiser . About noon even Elizabeth 's ignorance was roused up to the conviction that something was very wrong with Mrs. Ascott , and that nurse 's skill could not counteract it . On her own responsibility she sent , or rather she went to fetch the doctor . He came ; and his fiat threw the whole household into consternation . Now they knew that the poor lady whose happiness had touched the very stoniest hearts in the establishment hovered upon the brink of the grave . Now all the women - servants , down to the little kitchen - maid with her dirty apron at her eyes , crept up stairs , one after the other , to the door of what had been such a silent , mysterious room , and listened , unhindered , to the ravings that issued thence . "
109567	109570	109564	109565	Poor Missis	134	" and the "
109575	109627	109564	109565	Poor Missis	134	" were spoken of softly at the kitchen dinner table , and confidentially sympathized over with inquiring tradespeople at the area gate . A sense of awe and suspense stole over the whole house , gathering thicker hour by hour of that dark December day . When her mistress was first pronounced "
109631	109797	109564	109565	Poor Missis	134	" Elizabeth , aware that there was no one to act but herself , had taken a brief opportunity to slip from the room and write two letters , one to her master in Edinburgh , and the other to Miss Hilary . The first she gave to the footman to post ; the second she charged him to send by special messenger to Richmond . But he , being lazily inclined , or else thinking that , as the order was only given by Elizabeth , it was of comparatively little moment , posted them both . So vainly did the poor girl watch and wait ; neither Miss Leaf nor Miss Hilary came . By night Mrs. Ascott 's delirium began to subside , but her strength was ebbing fast . Two physicians — three — stood by the unconscious woman , and pronounced that all hope was gone , if , indeed , the case had not been hopeless from the beginning . "
109813	109846	109805	109806	no relations	1440	" asked the fashionable physician , Sir — — — — , touched by the slight or this poor lady dying alone , with only a nurse and a servant about her . "
109859	109907	109908	109908	I	0	" Elizabeth ran down stairs , and rousing the old butler from his bed , prevailed on him to start immediately in the carriage to bring back Miss Leaf and Miss Hilary . It would be midnight before he reached Richmond ; still it must be done . "
109916	109922	109908	109908	I	0	" said he , kindly ; "
109937	110233	109924	109924	I	0	" When Elizabeth returned to her mistress 's room the doctors were all gone , and nurse , standing at the foot of Mrs. Ascott 's bed , was watching her with the serious look which even a hireling or a stranger wears in the presence of that sight which , however familiar , never grows less awful — a fellow creature slowly passing from this life into the life unknown . Elizabeth crept up to the other side . The change , indescribable yet unmistakable , which comes over a human face when the warrant for its dissolution has gone forth , struck her at once . Never yet had Elizabeth seen death . Her father 's she did not remember , and among her few friends and connections none other had occurred . At twenty - three years of age she was still ignorant of that solemn experience which every woman must go through some time , often many times during her life . For it is to women that all look in their extreme hour . Very few men , even the tenderest hearted , are able to watch by the last struggle and close the eyes of the dying . For the moment , as she glanced round the darkened room , and then at the still figure on the bed , Elizabeth 's courage failed . Strong love might have overcome this fear — the natural recoil of youth and life from coming into contact with death and mortality ; but love was not exactly the bond between her and Mrs. Ascott . It was rather duty , pity , the tenderness that would have sprung up in her heart toward any body she had watched and tended so long . "
110249	110285	110245	110246	Miss Hilary	91	" thought the poor girl , and glanced once more around the shadowy room , where she was now left quite alone . For nurse , thinking with true worldly wisdom of the preservation of the "
110290	110426	110427	110427	Elizabeth	94	" which was decidedly the most important question now , had stolen away , and was busy in the next room , seeing various young women whom the doctors had sent , one of whom was to supply to the infant the place of the poor mother whom it would never know . There was nobody left but herself to watch this dying mother , so Elizabeth took her lot upon her , smothered down her fears , and sat by the bedside waiting for the least expression of returning reason in the sunken face , which was very quiet now . Consciousness did return at last , as the doctors had said it would . Mrs. Ascott opened her eyes ; they wandered from side to side , and then she said , feebly , "
110434	110458	110427	110427	Elizabeth	94	" What Elizabeth answered she never could remember ; perhaps nothing , or her agitation betrayed her , for Mrs. Ascott said again , "
110471	110551	110561	110561	God	105	" Some people might have considered it best to reply with a lie — the frightened , cowardly lie that is so often told at death - beds to the soul passing direct to its God . But this girl could not and dared not . Leaning over her mistress , she whispered as softly as she could , choking down the tears that might have disturbed the peace which , mercifully , seemed to have come with dying , "
110581	110582	110563	110563	He	105	" "
110586	110666	110584	110584	He	105	" The tone was submissive , half - inquiring ; like that of a child learning something it had never learned before — as Selina was now learning . Perhaps even those three short weeks of motherhood had power so to raise her whole nature that she now gained the composure with which even the weakest soul can sometimes meet death , and had grown not unworthy of the dignity of a Christian 's dying . Suddenly she shivered . "
110686	110858	110679	110679	nobody	357	" Oh , how Elizabeth longed for Miss Hilary , for any body , who would have known what to say to the dying woman ; who perhaps , as her look and words implied , till this hour had never thought of dying . Once it crossed the servant 's mind to send for some clergyman ; but she knew none , and was aware that Mrs. Ascott did not either . She had no superstitious feeling that any clergyman would do ; just to give a sort of spiritual extreme unction to the departing soul . Her own religious faith was of such an intensely personal silent kind , that she did not believe in any good to be derived from a strange gentleman coming and praying by the bedside of a stranger , repeating set sayings with a set countenance , and going away again . And yet with that instinct which comes to almost every human soul , fast departing , Mrs. Ascott 's white lips whispered , "
110861	110899	110900	110900	Father	215	" Elizabeth had no words , except those which Miss Leaf used to say night after night in the little parlor at Stowbury . She knelt down , and in a trembling voice repeated in her mistress 's ear—"Our
110904	110921	110900	110900	Father	215	heaven"—to the end . After it Mrs. Ascott lay very quiet . At length she said , "
110930	110944	110945	110945	my	0	" It had been from the first , and was to the last , "
110946	110963	110964	110964	He	2692	" baby . The small face was laid close to hers that she might kiss it . "
110980	110999	110964	110964	He	2692	" And the strong natural agony came upon her , conquering even the weakness of her last hour . "
111017	111032	110964	110964	He	2692	" And then lifting herself up on her elbow she caught hold of nurse . "
111066	111067	111068	111068	I	0	" "
111077	111105	111068	111068	I	0	" said Elizabeth Hand . She took the child in her arms , and for almost another hour stood beside the bed thus , until nurse whispered , "
111118	111220	111110	111111	its mother	2700	" But she did ; for she feebly moved her fingers as if in search of something . Baby was still asleep , but Elizabeth contrived , by kneeling down close to the bed , to put the tiny hand under those cold fingers ; they closed immediately upon it , and so remained till the last . When Miss Leaf and Miss Hilary came in , Elizabeth was still kneeling there , trying softly to take the little hand away ; for the baby had wakened and began its piteous wail . But it did not disturb the mother now . "
111223	111676	111110	111111	its mother	2700	" was no more . Nothing of her was left to her child except the name of a mother . It may have been better so . Such was the inscription which now , for six months , had met the eyes of the inhabitants of Stowbury , on a large , dazzlingly white marble monument , the first that was placed in the Church - yard of the New Church . What motive induced Mr. Ascott to inter his wife here — whether it was a natural wish to lay her , and some day lay beside her , in their native earth ; or the less creditable desire of showing how rich he had become , and of joining his once humble name , even on a tombstone , with one of the oldest names in the annals of Stowbury — nobody could find out . Probably nobody cared . The Misses Leaf were content that he should do as he pleased in the matter : he had shown strong but not exaggerated grief at his loss ; if any remorse mingled therewith , Selina 's sisters happily did not know it . Nobody ever did know the full history of things except Elizabeth , and she kept it to herself . So the family skeleton was buried quietly in Mrs. Ascott 's grave . Peter Ascott showed , in his coarse fashion , much sympathy and consideration for his wife 's sisters . He had them staying in the house till a week after the funeral was over , and provided them with the deepest and handsomest mourning . He even , in a formal way took counsel with them as to the carrying out of Mrs. Ascott 's wishes , and the retaining of Elizabeth in charge of the son and heir , which was accordingly settled . And then they went back to their old life at Richmond , and the widower returned to his solitary bachelor ways . He looked as usual ; went to and from the City as usual ; and his brief married life seemed to have passed away from him like a dream . Not altogether a dream . Gradually he began to awake to the consciousness of an occasional child 's cry in the house — that large , silent , dreary house , where he was once more the sole , solitary master . Sometimes , when he came in from church of Sundays , he would mount another flight of stairs , walk into the nursery at the top of the house , and stare with distant curiosity at the little creature in Elizabeth 's arms , pronounce it a "
111686	112133	111110	111111	its mother	2700	" and then walk down again . He never seemed to consider it as his child , this poor old bachelor of so many years ' standing ; he had outgrown apparently all sense of the affections or the duties of a father . Whether they ever would come into him ; whether , after babyhood was passed , he would begin to take an interest in the little creature who throve and blossomed into beauty — which , as if watched by guardian angles , dead mothers ' children often seem to do — was a source of earnest speculation to Elizabeth . In the mean time he treated both her and the baby with extreme consideration , allowed her to do just as she liked , and gave her indefinite sums of money to expend upon the nursery . When summer came , and the doctor ordered change of air , Mr. Ascott consented to her suggestion of taking a lodging for herself and baby near baby 's aunts at Richmond ; only desiring that the lodging should be as handsome as could be secured , and that every other Sunday she should bring up his son to spend the day at Russell Square . And so , during the long summer months , the motherless child , in its deep mourning — which looks so pathetic on a very young baby — might be seen carried about in Elizabeth 's arms every where . When , after the first six weeks , the wet nurse left — in fact , two or three nurses successively were abolished — she took little Henry solely under her own charge . She had comparatively small experience , but she had common sense , and the strong motherly instinct which comes by nature to some women . Besides , her whole soul was wrapped up in this little child . From the hour when , even with her mistress dying before her eyes , Elizabeth had felt a strange thrill of comfort in the new duty which had come into her blank life , she took to this duty as women only can whose life has become a blank . She received the child as a blessing sent direct from God ; by unconscious hands — for Mrs. Ascott knew nothing of what happened ; something that would heal her wounded heart , and make her forget Tom . And so it did . Women and mothers well know how engrossing is the care of an infant ; how each minute of the day is filled up with something to be done or thought of ; so that "
112135	112420	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" about extraneous things becomes quite impossible . How gradually the fresh life growing up and expanding puts the worn out or blighted life into the back ground , and all the hopes and fancies cling around the small , beautiful present , the ever developing , the ever marvelous mystery of a young child 's existence ! Why it should be so , we can only guess ; but that it is so , many a wretched wife , many a widowed mother , many a broken hearted , forlorn aunt , has thankfully proved . Elizabeth proved it likewise . She did not exactly lose all memory of her trouble , but it seemed lighter ; it was swallowed up in this second passion of adopted motherhood . And so she sank , quietly and at once , into the condition of a middle aged woman , whose life 's story — and her sort of women have but one — was a mere episode , told and ended . For Esther had left and been married to Tom Cliffe within a few week 's of Mrs. Ascott 's funeral . Of course , the household knew every thing ; but nobody condoled with Elizabeth . There was a certain stand - off - ishness about her which made them hold their tongues . They treated her with much respect , as her new position demanded . She took this , as she took every thing , with the grave quietness which was her fashion from her youth up ; assumed her place as a confidential upper servant ; dressed well but soberly , like a woman of forty , and was called "
112424	112429	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" The only trace her "
112431	112644	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" left upon her was a slightly bitter way of speaking about men in general , and a dislike to any chatter about love affairs and matrimony . Her own story she was never known to refer to in the most distant way , except once . Miss Hilary — who , of course , had heard all , but delicately kept silence — one night , when little Henry was not well , remained in the lodgings on Richmond Hill , and slept in the nursery , Elizabeth making up for herself a bed on the floor close beside baby and cradle . In the dead of night , the two women , mistress and maid , by some chance , said a few things to one another which never might have been said in the daylight , and which , by tacit consent , were never afterward referred to by either , any more than if they had been spoken in a dream . Elizabeth told briefly , though not without emotion , all that had happened between herself and Tom , and how he was married to Esther Martin . And then both women went back , in a moralizing way , to the days when they had both been "
112646	112669	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" at Stowbury , and how different life was from what they then thought and looked forward to — Miss Hilary and her "
112673	112674	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" "
112677	112685	112421	112422	Mrs. Hand	90	" answered the former with a sigh , "
112729	112737	112720	112720	I	0	" Elizabeth said , after a pause , "
112766	112767	112768	112768	I	0	" "
112773	112774	112768	112768	I	0	" "
112793	112794	112786	112786	he	2706	" "
112804	113740	112795	112795	He	2706	" This was all Miss Hilary said , and she said it softly and mournfully . She might never have said it at all ; but it dropped from her unawares in the deep feeling of the moment , when her heart was tender over Elizabeth 's own sad , simply told story . Also because of a sudden and great darkness which had come over her own . Literally , she did not now know whether Robert Lyon were alive or dead . Two months ago his letters had suddenly ceased , without any explanation , his last being exactly the same as the others — as frank , as warmly affectionate , as cheerful and brave . One solution to this was his possible coming home . But she did not , after careful reasoning on the subject , believe that likely . She knew exactly his business relations with his employers ; that there was a fixed time for his return to England , which nothing except the very strongest necessity could alter . Even in the chance of his health breaking , so as to incapacitate him for work , he should , he always said , have to go to the hills , rather than take the voyage home prematurely . And in that case he certainly would have informed his friends of his movements . There was nothing erratic , or careless , or eccentric about Robert Lyon ; he was a practical , business - like Scotchman — far too cautious and too regular in all his habits to be guilty of those accidental negligences by which wanderers abroad sometimes cause such cruel anxieties to friends at home . For the same reason , the other terrible possibility — his death — was not likely to have happened without their hearing of it . Hilary felt sure , with the strong confidence of love , that he would have taken every means to leave her some last word — some farewell token — which would reach hereafter he was gone , and comfort her with the assurance of what , living , he had never plainly told . Sometimes , when a wild terror of his death seized her , this settled conviction drove it back again . He must be living , or she would have heard . There was another interpretation of the silence , which many would have considered the most probable of all — he might be married . Not deliberately , but suddenly ; drawn into it by some of those impelling trains of circumstance which are the cause of so many marriages , especially with men ; or , impelled by one of those violent passions which occasionally seize on an exceedingly good man , fascinating him against his conscience , reason , and will , until he wakes up to find himself fettered and ruined for life . Such things do happen , strangely , pitifully often . The like might have happened to Robert Lyon . Hilary did not actually believe it , but still her common sense told her that it was possible . She was not an inexperienced girl now ; she looked on the world with the eyes of a woman of thirty ; and though , thank Heaven ! the romance had never gone out of her — the faith , and trust , and tender love — still it had sobered down a little . She knew it was quite within the bounds of possibility that a young man , separated from her for seven years , thrown into all kinds of circumstances and among all sorts of people , should have changed very much in himself , and , consequently , toward her . That , without absolute faithlessness , he might suddenly have seen some other woman he liked better , and have married at once . Or , if he came back unmarried — she had taught herself to look this probability also steadily in the face — he might find the reality of her — Hilary Leaf — different from his remembrance of her ; and so , without actual falseness to the old true love , might not love her any more . These fears made her resolutely oppose Johanna 's wish to write to the house of business at Liverpool , and ask what had become of Mr. Lyon . It seemed like seeking after him , trying to hold him by the slender chain which he had never attempted to make any stronger , and which , already , he might have broken , or desired to break . She could not do it . Something forbade her ; that something in the inmost depths of a woman 's nature which makes her feel her own value , and exact that she shall be sought ; that , if her love be worth having , it is worth seeking ; that , however dear a man may be to her , she refuses to drop into his mouth like an overripe peach from a garden wall . In her sharpest agony of anxiety concerning him , Hilary felt that she could not , on her part , take any step that seemed to compel love — or even friendship — from Robert Lyon . It was not pride , she could hardly be called a proud woman ; it was an innate sense of the dignity of that love which , as a free gift , is precious as "
113745	114309	112795	112795	He	2706	" yet becomes the merest dross , utterly and insulting poor — when paid as a debt of honor , or offered as a benevolent largess . And so , though oftentimes her heart felt breaking , Hilary labored on ; sat the long day patiently at her desk ; interested herself in the young people over whom she ruled ; became Miss Balquidder 's right hand in all sorts of schemes which that good woman was forever carrying out for the benefit of her fellow - creatures ; and at leisure times occupied herself with Johanna , or with Elizabeth and the baby , trying to think it was a very beautiful and happy world , with love still in it , and a God of love ruling over it — only , only — Women are very humble in their cruelest pride . Many a day she felt as if she could have crawled a hundred miles in the dust — like some Catholic pilgrim — just to get one sight of Robert Lyon . Autumn came — lovely and lingering late . It was November , and yet the air felt mild as May , and the sunshine had that peculiar genial brightness which autumnal sunshine alone possesses ; even as , perhaps , late happiness has in it a holy calm and sweetness which no youthful ecstasy can ever boast . The day happened to be Hilary 's birthday . She had taken a holiday , which she , Johanna , Elizabeth , and the baby , had spent in Richmond Park , watching the rabbits darting about under the brown fern , and the deer grazing contentedly hard by . They had sat a long time under one of the oak trees with which the Park abounds , listening for the sudden drop , drop of an occasional acorn among the fallen leaves ; or making merry with the child , as a healthy , innocent , playful child always can make good women merry . Still , Master Henry was not a remarkable specimen of infanthood , and had never occupied more than his proper nepotal corner in Hilary 's heart . She left him chiefly to Elizabeth , and to his aunt Johanna , in whom the grandmotherly character had blossomed out in full perfection . And when these two became engrossed in his infant majesty . Hilary sat a little apart , unconsciously folding her hands and fixing her eyes on vacancy ; becoming fearfully alive to the sharp truth , that of all griefs , a strong love unreturned or unfulfilled is the grief which most blights a woman 's life . Say , rather , any human life ; but it is worst to a woman , because she must necessarily endure passively . So enduring , it is very difficult to recognize the good hand of God therein . Why should He ordain longings , neither selfish nor unholy , which yet are never granted ; tenderness which expends itself in vain ; sacrifices which are wholly unheeded ; and sufferings which seem quite thrown away ? That is , if we dared allege of any thing in the moral or in the material world , where so much loveliness , so much love , appear continually wasted , that it is really "
114313	114342	112795	112795	He	2706	" We never know through what divine mysteries of compensation the Great Father of the universe may be carrying out his sublime plan ; and those three words , "
114347	114553	112795	112795	He	2706	" ought to contain , to every doubting soul , the solution of all things . As Hilary rose from under the tree there was a shadow on her sweet face , a listless weariness in her movements , which caught Johanna 's attention . Johanna had been very good to her child . When , do what she would , Hilary could not keep down fits of occasional dullness or impatience , it was touching to see how this woman of over sixty years slipped from her due pedestal of honor and dignity , to be patient with her younger sister 's unspoken bitterness and incommunicable care . She now , seeing how restless Hilary was , rose when she rose , put her arm in hers , and accompanied her , speaking or silent , with quick steps or slow , as she chose , across the beautiful park , than which , perhaps , all England can not furnish a scene more thoroughly sylvan , thoroughly English . They rested on that high ground near the gate of Pembroke Lodge , where the valley of the Thames lies spread out like a map , stretching miles and miles away in luxuriant greenery . "
114590	114728	114729	114730	Miss Leaf	91	" Hilary turned sharply away , and Johanna saw at once what her words had implied . She felt so sorry , so vexed with herself ; but it was best to leave it alone . So they made their way homeward , speaking of something else ; and then that happened which Johanna had been almost daily expecting would happen , though she dared not communicate her hopes to Hilary , lest they might prove fallacious . The two figures , both in deep mourning , might have attracted any one 's attention : they caught that of a gentleman , who was walking quickly and looking about him , as if in search of something . He passed them at a little distance , then repassed , then turned , holding out both his hands . "
114739	114875	114737	114737	you	91	" Only the voice ; every thing else about him was so changed that Hilary herself would certainly have passed him in the street , that brown , foreign looking , middle aged man , nor recognized him as Robert Lyon . But for all that it was himself ; it was Robert Lyon . Nobody screamed , nobody fainted . People seldom do that in real life , even when a friend turns up suddenly from the other end of the world . They only hold out a warm hand , and look silently in one another 's faces , and try to believe that all is real , as these did . Robert Lyon shook hands with both ladies , one after the other , Hilary last , then placed himself between them . "
114885	115136	114876	114877	Miss Leaf	91	" The tone , the manner , were so exactly like himself , that in a moment all these intervening years seemed crushed into an atom of time . Hilary felt certain , morally and absolutely certain , that , in spite of all outward change , he was the same Robert Lyon who had bade them all good - by that Sunday night in the parlor at Stowbury . The same , even in his love for herself , though he had simply drawn her little hand under his arm , and never spoken a single word . Hilary Leaf , down , secretly , on your heart 's lowest knees , and thank God ! Repent of all your bitterness , doubts , and pains ; be joyful , be joyful ! But , oh , remember to be so humble withal . She was . As she walked silently along by Robert Lyon 's side , she pulled down her veil to hide the sweetest , most contrite , most child - like tears . What did she deserve , more than her neighbors , that she should be so very , very happy ? And when , a good distance across the park , she saw the dark , solitary figure of Elizabeth carrying baby , she quietly guided her companions into a different path , so as to avoid meeting , lest the sight of her happiness might in any way , hurt poor Elizabeth . "
115145	115173	115174	115174	I	0	" Mr. Lyon explained to Miss Leaf , after the fashion people have , at such meetings , of falling upon the most practical and uninteresting details . "
115211	115252	115260	115260	she	0	" Under any other circumstances Hilary might have smiled ; maybe she did smile , and tease him many a time afterward , because the first thing he could find to talk about , after seven years ' absence , was "
115287	115334	115260	115260	she	0	" Were you going home , Miss Leaf ? They told me at your house you were expected to dinner . May I come with you ? for I have only a few hours to stay . To - night I must go on to Liverpool . "
115335	115346	115260	115260	she	0	" But we shall hope soon to see you again ? "
115347	115368	115369	115369	He	2717	" I hope so . And I trust , Miss Leaf , that I do not intrude to - day . "
115443	115452	115453	115453	he	2717	" This is something worth coming home to , "
115470	115514	115453	115453	he	2717	" I am by no means disinterested in the matter of dinner , Miss Leaf ; for I have no doubt of finding good English roast beef and plum pudding on your sister 's birth day.—Happy returns of the day , Miss Hilary . "
115552	115567	115530	115530	she	2722	" Yes ; you are thirty ; I have known you for fifteen years . "
115568	115575	115577	115577	Johanna	93	" It is a long time , "
115705	115707	115710	115710	his	98	" old "
115807	115815	115817	115817	he	98	" You think me very much changed ? "
115833	115841	115842	115842	she	91	" Yes , a good deal changed , "
115959	115963	115965	115965	his	98	" growing old . "
116043	116047	116004	116005	Robert Lyon	98	" young together . "
116169	116175	116176	116176	He	98	" We were young together . "
116374	116384	116386	116386	he	98	" Things are rather different from what I thought ; "
116401	116407	116386	116386	he	98	" And about the shop ? "
116408	116413	116386	116386	he	98	" Johanna told you . "
116414	116449	116450	116450	Hilary	91	" Yes ; but her letters have been so few , so short — not that I could expect more . Still — now , if you will trust me — tell me all . "
116503	116587	116483	116483	She	91	" But after all it is hardly worth the telling , because , you see , we are very comfortable now . Poor Ascott , we suppose , must be in Australia . I earn enough to keep Johanna and myself , and Miss Balquidder is a good friend to us . We have repaid her , and owe nobody any thing . Still , we have suffered a great deal . Two years ago ; oh ! it was a dreadful time . "
116617	116627	116611	116612	Robert Lyon	98	" You suffered , and I never knew it . "
116628	116636	116596	116596	her	91	" I never meant you to know . "
116637	116641	116642	116642	He	98	" Why not ? "
116650	116712	116642	116642	He	98	" I ought to have been told ; it was cruel not to tell me . Suppose you had sunk under it ; suppose you had died , or been driven to do what many a woman does for the sake of mere bread and a home — what your poor sister did — married . But I beg your pardon . "
116724	116727	116728	116728	she	91	" No , "
116731	116755	116728	116728	she	91	" no poverty would have sunk me as low as that . I might have starved , but I should never have married . "
116773	116794	116795	116795	Hilary	91	" I beg your pardon once more . I had no right to allude to any thing of the kind . "
116882	116969	116879	116879	he	98	" Yes , I believe I have a right , the right that every man has when his whole happiness depends upon it , to ask you one question . You know every thing concerning me ; you always have known ; I meant that you should — I have taken the utmost care that you should . There is not a bit of my life that has not been as open to you as if — as if—. But I know nothing whatever concerning you . "
116970	116978	116979	116979	she	91	" What do you wish to know ? "
116982	117004	116879	116879	he	98	" Seven years is a long time . Are you free ? I mean , are you engaged to be married ? "
117005	117008	116879	116879	he	98	" No . "

117454	117463	117465	117465	Hilary	91	" I have loved you all my life , "

117683	117705	117681	117681	himself	98	" If I did marry , I think I should like such a wife as that brown - eyed bit lassie . "
117829	118240	118243	118243	his	2774	" Unruffled by those cataracts and breaks , That humor interposed too often makes . ' : There were no lovers ' quarrels ; Robert Lyon had chosen that best blessing next to a good woman , a sweet tempered woman ; and there was no reason why they should quarrel more as lovers than they had done as friends . And , let it be said to the eternal honor of both , now , no more than in their friendship days , was there any of that hungry engrossment of each other 's society , which is only another form of selfishness , and by which lovers so often make their own happy courting time a season of never - to - be - forgotten bitterness to every body connected with them . Johanna suffered a little : all people do when the new rights clash with the old ones ; but she rarely betrayed it . She was exceedingly good : she saw her child happy , and she loved Robert Lyon dearly . He was very mindful of her , very tender ; and as Hilary still persisted in doing her daily duty in the shop , he spent more of his time with the elder sister than he did with the younger , and sometimes declared solemnly that if Hilary did not treat him well he intended to make an offer to Johanna ! Oh , the innumerable little jokes of those happy days ! Oh , the long , quiet walks by the river side , through the park , across Ham Common — any where — it did not matter ; the whole world looked lovely , even on the dullest winter day ! Oh , the endless talks ; the renewed mingling of two lives , which , though divided , had never been really apart , for neither had any thing to conceal ; neither had ever loved any but the other . Robert Lyon was , as I have said , a good deal changed , outwardly and inwardly . He had mixed much in society , taken an excellent position therein , and this had given him not only a more polished manner , but an air of decision and command , as of one used to be obeyed . There could not be the slightest doubt , as Johanna once laughingly told him , that he would always be "
118247	118255	118243	118243	his	2774	" But he was very gentle with his "
118258	118271	118497	118497	Hilary	91	" as he called her . He would sit for hours at the "
118274	118388	118497	118497	Hilary	91	neuk"—how he did luxuriate in the English fires!—with Hilary on a footstool beside him , her arm resting on his knee , or her hand fast clasped in his . And sometimes , when Johanna went out of the room , he would stoop and gather her close to his heart . But I shall tell no tales ; the world has no business with these sort of things . Hilary was very shy of parading her happiness ; she disliked any demonstrations thereof , even before Johanna . And when Miss Balquidder , who had , of course , been told of the engagement , came down one day expressly to see her "
118393	118417	118497	118497	Hilary	91	" this Machiavellian little woman actually persuaded her lover to have an important engagement in London ! She could not bear him to be "
118421	118422	118497	118497	Hilary	91	" "
118442	118480	118497	118497	Hilary	91	" said the old Scotch woman . But it 's an ill wind that blows nobody good , and I have another young lady quite ready to step into your shoes . When shall you be married ? "
118481	118495	118497	118497	Hilary	91	" I do n't know — hush : we 'll talk another time , "
118878	118890	118900	118900	he	98	" Robert , I want to talk to you about Johanna . "
118891	118898	118900	118900	he	98	" I guess what it is , "
118904	118933	118900	118900	he	98	" you would like her to go out to India with us . Certainly , if she chooses . I hope you did not suppose I should object . "
118934	118960	118900	118900	he	98	" No ; but it is not that . She would not live six months in a hot climate ; the doctor tells me so . "
118961	118966	118900	118900	he	98	" You consulted him ? "
118967	118996	119000	119000	her	2782	" Yes , confidentially , without her knowing it . But I thought it right . I wanted to make quite sure before — before — Oh , Robert—. "
119013	119043	119010	119010	He	98	" You do n't mean that ? Oh no , you can not ! My little woman , my own little woman — she could not be so unkind . "
119081	119116	119067	119067	Venus	220	" Robert , let me sit down on the bench , and sit you beside me . It is too dark for people to notice us , and we shall not be very cold . "
119117	119123	119125	119125	he	2783	" No , my darling ; "
119144	119192	119139	119139	She	91	" Do n't be vexed with me , Robert , dear ; I have thought it all over ; weighed it on every side ; nights and nights I have been awake pondering what was right to do . And it always comes to the same thing . "
119193	119196	119067	119067	Venus	220	" What ? "
119197	119204	119205	119205	she	91	" It 's the old story , "
119212	119269	119205	119205	she	91	" ' I canna leave my minnie . ' There is nobody in the world to take care of Johanna but me , not even Elizabeth , who is engrossed in little Henry . If I left her , I am sure it would kill her . And she can not come with me . Dear ! "
119280	119305	119205	119205	she	91	" for these three years — you say it need only be three years — you will have to go back to India alone . "
119369	119374	119375	119375	he	98	" all to itself , "
119442	119449	119437	119437	He	98	" As you please , Hilary ; "

119815	119817	119820	119820	her	694	" to obey"—she

119997	120021	119985	119985	Johanna	93	" That will do , love . Do n't stay with me . I would not keep you from Robert on any account . "
120119	120126	120112	120112	him	98	" Perhaps he had better leave ; "
120135	120142	120112	120112	him	98	" Not unless you are obliged ; "
120443	120455	120419	120419	she	91	" Robert , what makes you so angry with me still ? "
120456	120467	120419	120419	she	91	" Not angry ; I have no right to be . "
120468	120484	120419	120419	she	91	" Yes , you would have if I had really done wrong . Have I ? "
120485	120517	120419	120419	she	91	" You must judge for yourself . For me — I thought you loved me better than I find you do , and I made a mistake ; that is all . "
120635	120659	120664	120664	he	98	" Look to her , Moor ! have a good eye to see ; She has deceived her father , and may thee . "
120711	120723	120778	120778	His	98	" Robert , will you listen to me for two minutes ? "
120724	120759	120778	120778	His	98	" For as long as you like , only you must not expect me to agree with you . You can not suppose I shall say it is right for you to forsake me . "
120760	120769	120778	120778	His	98	" I forsake you ? Oh , Robert ! "
120779	120782	120778	120778	His	98	" little woman "
120798	120810	120788	120788	her	2824	" Oh , Hilary , how could you wound me so ? "
120832	120843	120778	120778	His	98	" Now , Robert , may I talk to you ? "
120844	120854	120778	120778	His	98	" Yes . Preach away , my little conscience . "
120855	120870	120872	120872	she	2824	" It shall not be preaching , and it is not altogether for conscience , "
120875	120890	120872	120872	she	2824	" You would not like me to tell you I did not love Johanna ? "
120891	120924	120778	120778	His	98	" Certainly not . I love her very much myself , only I prefer you , as is natural . Apparently you do not prefer me , which may also be natural . "
120925	120928	120778	120778	His	98	" Robert ! "
120970	120973	120969	120969	her	91	" say . "
120974	121045	120778	120778	His	98	" Now , Robert put yourself in my place , and try to think for me . I have been Johanna 's child for thirty years ; she is entirely dependent upon me . Her health is feeble ; every year of her life is at least doubtful . If she lost me I think she would never live out the next three years . You would not like that ? "
121046	121049	120778	120778	His	98	" No . "
121050	121128	120778	120778	His	98	" In all divided duties like this somebody must suffer ; the question is , which can suffer best ? She is old and frail , we are young ; she is alone , we are two ; she never had any happiness in her life , except , perhaps me ; and we — oh how happy we are ! I think , Robert , it would be better for us to suffer than poor Johanna . "
121129	121134	121135	121135	he	2825	" You little Jesuit , "
121154	121169	121148	121148	he	2825	" It is only for a short time , remember — only three years . "
121170	121182	120778	120778	His	98	" And how can I do without you for three years ? "
121183	121191	121148	121148	he	2825	" Yes , Robert , you can . "
121210	121269	121193	121193	she	2827	" You know I am your very own , a piece of yourself , as it were ; that when I let you go it is like tearing myself from myself ; yet I can bear it , rather than do , or let you do , in the smallest degree , a thing which is not right . "
121307	121373	121281	121281	he	98	" It seems to me , Hilary , that this is hardly a matter of abstract right or wrong , or a good deal might be argued on my side of the subject . It is more a case of personal conscience . The two are not always identical , though they look so at first ; but they both come to the same result . "
121374	121379	121281	121281	he	98	" And that is — "
121380	121420	121422	121422	he	98	" If my little woman thinks it right to act as she does , I also think it right to let her . And let this be the law of our married life , if we ever are married , "
121425	121455	121422	121422	he	98	" that when we differ each should respect the other 's conscience , and do right in the truest sense , by allowing the other to do the same . "
121456	121466	121422	121422	he	98	" Oh , Robert ! how good you are . "
121727	121731	121734	121734	he	98	" our firm , "
121801	121803	121827	121827	he	98	" coached "
121822	121826	121827	121827	he	98	" Of course , "
121838	121870	121827	121827	he	98	" accidental circumstances might occur to cause my return home before the three years were out , but the act must be none of mine ; I must do my duty . "
121871	121877	121879	121879	Hilary	91	" Yes , you must , "
121956	121963	121947	121947	Hilary	91	" No , that was impossible . "
122075	122083	122084	122084	she	91	" Are you ashamed of my working ? "
122096	122126	122084	122084	she	91	" Sometimes I used to be afraid you would think the less of me because circumstances made me an independent woman , earning my own bread . Do you ? "
122127	122170	122172	122172	he	2844	" My darling , no . I am proud of her . But she must never work any more . Johanna says right ; it is a man 's place , and not a woman 's . I will not allow it . "
122266	122290	122291	122291	His	2844	" This will exists still ; so that in any case you are safe . No further poverty can ever befall my Hilary . "
122428	122431	122421	122421	Johanna	93	" My child "
122753	122777	122778	122779	Blind unbelief	227	" Deep in unfathomable mines Of never - failing skill . He treasures up His vast designs , And works His sovereign will . "
122805	122953	122799	122799	He	227	" The night after Robert Lyon left , Hilary and Johanna were sitting together in their parlor . Hilary had been writing a long letter to Miss Balquidder , explaining that she would now give up in favor of the other young lady , or any other of the many to whom it would be a blessing , her position in the shop ; but that she hoped still to help her — Miss Balquidder — in any way she could point out that would be useful to others . She wished , in her humble way , as a sort of thank offering from one who had passed through the waves and been landed safe ashore , to help those who were still struggling , as she herself had struggled once . She desired , as far as in her lay , to be Miss Balquidder 's "
122956	123005	123006	123006	We	2856	" till Mr. Lyon came home . This letter she read aloud to Johanna , whose failing eye sight refused all candle light occupation , and then came and sat beside her in silence . She felt terribly worn and weary , but she was very quiet now . "
123013	123019	123006	123006	We	2856	" was all she said . "
123025	123128	123022	123023	my child	3717	" And Johanna smoothed her hair in the old , fond way , making no attempt to console her , but only to love her — always the safest consolation . And Hilary was thankful that never , even in her sharpest agonies of grief , had she betrayed that secret which would have made her sister 's life miserable , have blotted out the thirty years of motherly love , and caused the other love to rise up like a cloud between her and it , never to be lifted until Johanna sank into the possibly not far - off grave . "
123133	123167	123022	123023	my child	3717	" she thought to herself , as she looked on that frail , old face , which even the secondary , grief of this last week seemed to have made frailer and older . "
123188	123242	123245	123247	the young people	4323	" The end was nearer than she thought . So , sometimes — not often , lest self - sacrifice should become a less holy thing than it is — Providence accepts the will for the act , and makes the latter needless . There was a sudden knock at the hall door . "
123253	123254	123245	123247	the young people	4323	" "
123259	123264	123267	123267	their	4323	" said Hilary , starting up—"it
123273	123290	123022	123023	my child	3717	" She never finished the sentence , for she was sobbing in Robert Lyon 's arms . "
123297	123534	123536	123536	she	2859	" cried the bewildered Johanna , of whom , I must confess , for once nobody took the least notice . It meant that , by one of these strange accidents , as we call them , which in a moment alter the whole current of things , the senior partner had suddenly died , and his son , not being qualified to take his place in the Liverpool house , had to go out to India instead of Robert Lyon , who would now remain permanently , as the third senior partner , in England . This news had met him at Southampton . He had gone thence direct to Liverpool , arranged affairs so far as was possible , and returned , traveling without an hour 's intermission , to tell his own tidings , as was best — or as he thought it was . Perhaps at the core of his heart lurked the desire to come suddenly back , as , it is said , if the absent or the dead should come , they would find all things changed ; the place filled up in home and hearth — no face of welcome — no heart leaping to heart in the ecstasy of reunion . Well , if Robert Lyon had any misgivings — and being a man , and in love , perhaps he had — they were ended now . "
123542	123695	123696	123697	little woman	2860	" was all he could find to say when , Johanna having considerately vanished , he might have talked as much as he pleased . Hilary 's only answer was a little , low laugh of inexpressible content . He lifted up between his bands the sweet face , neither so young nor so pretty as it had been , but oh ! so sweet , with the sweetness that long outlives beauty — a face that a man might look on all his life time and never tire of — so infinitely loving , so infinitely true ! And he knew it was his wife 's face , to shine upon him day by day , and year by year , till it faded into old age — beautiful and beloved even then . All the strong nature of the man gave way ; he wept almost like a child in his "
123699	123861	123696	123697	little woman	2860	" arms . Let us leave them there , by that peaceful fireside — these two , who are to sit by one fire - side as long as they live . Of their further fortune we know nothing — nor do they themselves — except the one fact , in itself joy enough for any mortal cup to hold , that it will be shared together . Two at the hearth , two abroad ; two to labor , two to rejoice ; or , if so it must be , two to weep , and two to comfort one another ; the man to be the head of the woman , and the woman the heart of the man . This is the ordination of God ; this is the perfect life ; none the less perfect that so many fall short of it . So let us bid them good - by : Robert Lyon and Hilary Leaf , "
123871	123961	123962	123964	a country child	2862	" for we shall see them no more . Elizabeth stood at the nursery window , pointing out to little Henry how the lilacs and laburnums were coming into flower in the square below , and speculating with him whether the tribe of sparrows which they had fed all the winter from the mignonette boxes on the window sill would be building nests in the tall trees of Russell Square ; for she wished , with her great aversion to London , to make her nursling as far as possible "
123966	123993	123962	123964	a country child	2862	" Master Henry Leaf Ascott was by no means little now . He would run about on his tottering fat legs , and he could say , "
123997	124000	124001	124003	Pa - pa	229	" also , "
124005	124071	124001	124003	Pa - pa	229	" as had been carefully taught him by his conscientious nurse . At which papa had been at first excessively surprised , then gratified , and had at last taken kindly to the appellation as a matter of course . It inaugurated a new era in Peter Ascott 's life . At first twice a week , and then every day , he sent up for "
124074	124475	124072	124073	Master Ascott	97	" to keep him company at dessert ; he then changed his dinner hour from half past six to five , because Elizabeth , with her stern sacrifice of every thing to the child 's good , had suggested to him , humbly but firmly , that late hours kept little Henry too long out of his bed . He gave up his bottle of port and his after - dinner sleep , and took to making water - lilies and caterpillars out of oranges and boats out of walnut shells , for his boy 's special edification . Sometimes when , at half past six , Elizabeth , punctual as clock - work , knocked at the dining room door , she heard father and son laughing together in a most jovial manner , though the decanters were in their places and the wine glasses untouched . And even after the child disappeared , the butler declared that master usually took quietly to his newspaper , or rang for his tea , or perhaps dozed harmlessly in his chair till bedtime . I do not allege that Peter Ascott was miraculously changed ; people do not change , especially at his age ; externally he was still the same pompous , overbearing , coarse man , with whom , no doubt , his son would have a tolerably sore bargain in years to come . But still the child had touched a soft corner in his heart , the one soft corner which in his youth had yielded to the beauty of Miss Selina Leaf ; and the old fellow was a better fellow than he had once been . Probably , with care , he might be for the rest of his life at least manageable . Elizabeth hoped so for his boy 's sake , and little as she liked him , she tried to conquer her antipathy as much as she could . She always ways took care to treat him with extreme respect , and to bring up little Henry to do the same . And , as often happens , Mr. Ascott began gradually to comport himself in a manner deserving of respect . He ceased his oaths and his coarse language ; seldom flew into a passion ; and last , not least , the butler avouched that master hardly ever went to bed "
124477	124602	124851	124851	I	0	" now . Toward all his domestics , and especially his son 's nurse , he behaved himself more like a master and less like a tyrant ; so that the establishment at Russell Square went on in a way more peaceful than had ever been known before . There was no talk of his giving it a new mistress ; he seemed to have had enough of matrimony . Of his late wife he never spoke ; whether he loved her or not , whether he had regretted her or not , the love and regret were now alike ended . Poor Selina ! It was Elizabeth only , who , with a sacred sense of duty , occasionally talked to little Henry about "
124605	124640	124072	124073	Master Ascott	97	there"—pointing to the blank bit of blue sky over the trees of Russell Square , and hoped in time to make him understand something about her , and how she had loved him , her "
124643	124850	124072	124073	Master Ascott	97	" This love , the only beautiful emotion her life had known , was the one fragment that remained of it after her death ; the one remembrance she left to her child . Little Henry was not in the least like her , nor yet like his father . He took after some forgotten type , some past generation of either family , which reappeared in this as something new . To Elizabeth he was a perfect revelation of beauty and infantile fascination . He filled up every corner of her heart . She grew fat and flourishing , even cheerful ; so cheerful that she bore with equanimity the parting with her dear Miss Hilary , who went away in glory and happiness as Mrs. Robert Lyon , to live in Liverpool , and Miss Leaf with her . Thus both Elizabeth 's youthful dreams ended in nothing , and it was more than probable that for the future their lives and hers being so widely apart , she would see very little of her beloved mistresses any more . But they had done their work in her and for her ; and it had borne fruit a hundred fold , and would still . "
124869	124885	124853	124853	you	2863	" said Miss Leaf , when she was giving her last kiss to little Henry . "
124903	125222	125223	125224	Mammy Lizzie	228	" And Elizabeth had taken her charge proudly in her arms , knowing she was trusted , and in vowing to be worthy of that trust . Another dream was likewise ended ; so completely that she sometimes wondered if it was ever real , whether she had ever been a happy girl , looking forward as girls do to wifehood and motherhood ; or whether she had not been always the staid middle aged person she was now , whom nobody ever suspected of any such things . She had been once back to her old home , to settle her mother comfortably upon a weekly allowance , to ' prentice her little brother , to see one sister married , and the other sent off to Liverpool , to be servant to Mrs. Lyon . While at Stowbury , she had heard by chance of Tom Cliffe 's passing through the town as a Chartist lecturer , or something of the sort , with his pretty , showy London wife , who , when he brought her there , had looked down rather contemptuously upon the street where Tom was born . This was all Elizabeth knew about them . They , too , had passed from her life as phases of keen joy and keener sorrow do pass , like a dream and the shadows of a dream . It may be , life itself will seem at the end to be nothing more . But Elizabeth Hand 's love story was not so to end . One morning , the same morning when she had been pointing out the lilacs to little Henry , and now came in from the square with a branch of them in her hand , the postman gave her a letter ; the handwriting of which made her start as if it had been a visitation from the dead . "
125229	125340	125223	125224	Mammy Lizzie	228	" cried little Henry , plucking at her gown , but for once his nurse did not notice him . She stood on the door - step , trembling violently ; at length she put the letter into her pocket , lifted the child , and got up stairs somehow . When she had settled her charge to his mid - day sleep , then , and not till then , did she take out and read the few lines , which , though written on shabby paper , and with more than one blot , were so like — yet so terribly unlike — Tom 's calligraphy of old : "
125462	125469	125459	125459	you	232	" Yours affectionately , T. CLIFFE . "
125475	125646	125459	125459	you	232	" It was in one of those wretched nooks in Westminster , now swept away by Victoria Street and other improvements . Elizabeth happened to have read about it in one of the many charitable pamphlets , reports , etc . , which were sent continually to the wealthy Mr. Ascott , and which he sent down stairs to light fires with . What must not poor Tom have sunk to before he had come to live there ? His letter was like a cry out of the depths , and the voice was that of her youth , her first love . Is any woman ever deaf to that ? The love may have died a natural death ; many first loves do : a riper , completer , happier love may have come in its place ; but there must be something unnatural about the woman and man likewise , who can ever quite forget it — the dew of their youth — the beauty of their dawn . "
125653	125657	125661	125661	Tom	132	" sighed Elizabeth , "
125663	125773	125459	125459	you	232	" She forgot Esther ; either from Tom 's not mentioning her , or in the strong return to old times which his letter produced ; forgot her for the time being as completely as if she had never existed . Even when the recollection came it made little difference . The sharp jealousy , the dislike and contempt had all calmed down : she thought she could now see Tom 's wife as any other woman . Especially if , as the letter indicated , they were so very poor and miserable . Possibly Esther had suggested writing it ? Perhaps , though Tom did not , Esther did "
125780	125949	126000	126000	Mammy	2870	her"—Elizabeth Hand , who was known to have large wages , and to be altogether a thriving person ? Well , it mattered little . The one fact remained : Tom was in distress ; Tom needed her ; she must go . Her only leisure time was of an evening , after Henry was in bed . The intervening hours , especially the last one , when the child was down stairs with his father , calmed her ; subdued the tumult of old remembrances that came surging up and beating at the long shut door of her heart . When her boy returned , leaping and laughing , and playing all sorts of tricks as she put him to bed , she could smile too . And when kneeling beside her in his pretty white night gown , he stammered through the prayer she had thought it right to begin to teach him , though of course he was too young to understand it — the words "
125955	125956	125950	125950	Thy	2867	" "
125971	125975	125950	125950	Thy	2867	" and lastly , "
125988	125999	126000	126000	Mammy	2870	" struck home to his nurse 's in most soul . "
126008	126210	126003	126003	Lizzie	94	" Yes , she was crying , but it did her good . She was able to kiss her little boy , who slept like a top in five minutes : then she took off her good silk gown , and dressed herself ; soberly and decently , but so that people should not suspect , in that low and dangerous neighborhood , the sovereigns that she carried in an under pocket , ready to use as occasion required . Thus equipped , without a minute 's delay , she started for Tom 's lodging . It was poorer than even she expected . One attic room , bate almost as when it was built . No chimney or grate , no furniture except a box which served as both table and chair ; and a heap of straw , with a blanket thrown over it . The only comfort about it was that it was clean ; Tom 's innate sense of refinement had abided with him to the last . Elizabeth had time to make all these observations , for Tom was out — gone , the landlady said , to the druggist 's shop , round the corner . "
126218	126252	126211	126211	He	2871	" added the woman , civilly , probably led thereto by Elizabeth 's respectable appearance , and the cab in which she had come — lest she should lose a minute 's time . "
126267	126408	126259	126259	Lord	2873	" With that sentence knelling in her ears , Elizabeth waited till she heard the short cough and the hard breathing of some one toiling heavily up the stair . Tom , Tom himself . But oh , so altered ! with every bit of youth gone out of him ; with death written on every line of his haggard face , the death he had once prognosticated with a sentimental pleasure , but which now had come upon him in all its ghastly reality . He was in the last stage of consumption . The disease was latent in his family , Elizabeth knew : she had known it when she belonged to him , and fondly thought that , as his wife , her incessant care might save him from it ; but nothing could save him now . "
126413	126425	126426	126426	Me	0	" said he , in his own sharp , fretful voice . "
126443	126518	126519	126519	I	0	" Tom grasped her hand as she stood by him , but he made no further demonstration , nor used any expression of gratitude . He seemed far too ill . Sick people are always absorbed in the sad present ; they seldom trouble themselves much about the past . Only there was something in the way Tom clung to her hand , helplessly , imploringly , that moved the inmost heart of Elizabeth . "
126541	126542	126563	126563	He	2878	" "
126548	126549	126550	126553	The druggist close by	2876	" "
126624	126625	126616	126622	a'most clemmed to death in the winter	2883	" "
126645	126646	126640	126640	you	132	" "
126662	126663	126653	126653	I	0	" "
126667	126668	126665	126665	Esther	201	" "
126671	126675	126665	126665	Esther	201	" screamed Tom . "
126679	126680	126665	126665	Esther	201	" "
126712	126792	126710	126710	her	2885	" The fury with which he spoke shook him all over , and sent him into another violent fit of coughing , out of which he revived by degrees , but in a state of such complete exhaustion that Elizabeth hazarded no more questions . He must evidently be dealt with exactly like a child . She made up her mind in her own silent way , as indeed she had done ever since she came into the room . "
126829	126830	126824	126824	You	132	" "
126849	127104	126845	126845	You	132	" Elizabeth groped her way down stairs strangely calm and self - possessed . There was need . Tom , dying , had come to her as his sole support and consolation — throwing himself helplessly upon her , never doubting either her will or her power to help him . Neither must fail . The inexplicable woman 's strength , sometimes found in the very gentlest , quietest , and apparently the weakest character , nerved her now . She went up and down , street after street , looking for lodgings , till the evening darkened , and the Abbey towers rose grimly against the summer sky . Then she crossed over Westminster Bridge , and in a little street on the Surrey side she found what she wanted — a decent room , half sitting , half bedroom , with what looked like a decent landlady . There was no time to make many inquiries ; any thing was better than to leave Tom an other night where he was . She paid a week 's rent in advance ; bought firing and provisions ; every thing she could think of to make him comfortable ; and then she went to fetch him in a cab . The sick man offered no resistance ; indeed , he hardly seemed to know what she was doing with him . She discovered the cause of this half insensibility when , in making a bundle of his few clothes , she found a package labeled "
127107	127108	126845	126845	You	132	" "
127116	127121	126845	126845	You	132	" he said pitifully , "
127130	127163	126845	126845	You	132	" But when he found himself in the cheerful room , with the fire blazing and the tea laid out , he woke up like a person out of a bad dream . "
127173	127241	127166	127166	Elizabeth	94	" Elizabeth could have wept . Whether the wholesome food and drink revived him , or whether it was one of the sudden flashes of life that often occur in consumptive patients , but he seemed really better , and began to talk , telling Elizabeth about his long illness , and saying over again how very kind the druggist 's young man had been to him . "
127346	127347	127344	127344	Elizabeth	94	" "
127352	127353	127344	127344	Elizabeth	94	" "
127419	127457	127407	127407	You	94	" Elizabeth smiled , a faint rather sad smile . For , as she was washing up the tea things , she had noticed Tom 's voice grow feebler , and his features sharper and more wan . "
127463	127467	127458	127458	I	0	" he said . "
127500	127525	127526	127526	You	2896	" Elizabeth helped him to the small pallet , shook his pillow , and covered him up as if he had been a child . "
127533	127574	127526	127526	You	2896	" he said , and looked up at her — Tom 's bright , fond look of years ago . But it passed away in a moment , and he closed his eyes , saying he was so terribly tired . "
127638	127639	127640	127640	I	0	" "
127643	127647	127640	127640	I	0	" said Tom . "
127661	127662	127686	127686	you	2896	" "
127665	127684	127686	127686	you	2896	" And they were both silent . After a minute , Tom asked , in a troubled voice . "
127690	127691	127686	127686	you	2896	" "
127698	127699	127694	127694	Tom	132	" "
127710	127733	127702	127702	you	2896	" She turned away . She did not mean to be hard , but somehow she could not kiss Esther 's husband . "
127748	127749	127754	127754	Tom	132	" "
127756	127864	127865	127865	Tom	132	" But as she stood at the door , and looked back at him lying with his eyes shut , and as white as if he were dead , Elizabeth 's heart melted . He was her Tom , her own Tom , of whom she had been so fond , so proud ; whose future she had joyfully anticipated long before she thought of herself as mixed up with it ; and he was dying , dying at four - and - twenty ; passing away to the other world , where , perhaps , she might meet him yet , with no cruel Esther between . "
127867	127876	127877	127877	Tom	132	" she said , and knelt beside him , "
127911	127912	127900	127900	I	0	" "
127919	127920	127900	127900	I	0	" "
127931	128149	127900	127900	I	0	" And she did kiss him , mouth to mouth , quietly and tenderly . She was so glad of it afterward . It was late enough when she reached Russell Square ; but nobody ever questioned the proceedings of Mrs. Hand , who was a privileged person . She crept in beside her little Henry , and as the child turned in his sleep and put his arms about her neck , she clasped him tight , and thought there was still something to live for in this weary world . All night she thought over what best could be done for Tom . Though she never deceived herself for a moment as to his state , still she thought , with care and proper nursing , he might live a few months . Especially if she could get him into the Consumption Hospital , newly started in Chelsea , of which she was aware Mr. Ascott — who dearly loved to see his name in a charity list — was one of the governors . There was no time to be lost ; she determined to speak to her master at once . The time she chose was when she brought down little Henry , who was now always expected to appear , and say , "
128155	128257	128153	128153	papa	2900	" before Mr. Ascott went into the city . As they stood , the boy laughing in his father 's face , and the father beaming all over with delight , the bitter , almost fierce thought , smote Elizabeth , Why should Peter Ascott be standing there fat and flourishing , and poor Tom dying ? It made her bold to ask the only favor she ever had asked of the master whom she did not care for , and to whom she had done her duty simply as duty , without , until lately , one fragment of respect . "
128276	128277	128280	128281	Mrs. Hand	90	" "
128326	128327	128320	128320	you	3469	" "
128333	128339	128320	128320	you	3469	" said Elizabeth , curtseying . "
128346	128399	128320	128320	you	3469	" And in the briefest language she could find she explained what it was . Mr. Ascott knitted his brows and looked important . He never scattered his benefits with a silent hand , and he dearly liked to create difficulties , if only to show how he could smooth them down . "
128464	128465	128459	128459	you	3469	" "
128479	128480	128477	128477	Esther	201	" "
128511	128542	128504	128505	his wife	4348	" The careless question seemed hardly to expect an answer , and Elizabeth gave none . She could not bear to make public Tom 's misery and Esther 's shame . "
128597	128662	128589	128590	Mrs. Hand	90	" And he was going away ; but time being of such great moment , Elizabeth ventured to detain him till he had written the letter of recommendation , and found out what days the application for admission could be received . He did it very patiently , and even took out his purse and laid a sovereign on the top of the letter . "
128678	128679	128589	128590	Mrs. Hand	90	" "
128690	129004	128686	128686	you	777	" said Elizabeth , putting it gently aside . She could not bear that Tom should accept any body 's money but her own . At her first spare moment she wrote him a long letter explaining what she had done , and appointing the next day but one , the earliest possible , for taking him out to Chelsea herself . If he objected to the plan , he was to write and say so ; but she urged him as strongly as she could not to let slip this opportunity of obtaining good nursing and first rate medical care . Many times during the day the thought of Tom alone in his one room — comfortable though it was , and though she had begged the landlady to see that he wanted nothing — came across her with a sudden pang . His face , feebly lifted up from the pillow , with its last affectionate smile , the sound of his cough as she stood listening outside on the stair head , haunted her all through that sunshiny June day ; and , mingled with it , came ghostly visions of that other day in June — her happy Whitsun holiday — her first and her last . No letter coming from Tom on the appointed morning , she left Master Henry in the charge of the house - maid , who was very fond of him — as indeed he bade fair to be spoiled by the whole establishment at Russell Square — and went down to Westminster . There was a long day before her , so she took a minute 's breathing space on Westminster Bridge , and watched the great current of London life ebbing and flowing — life on the river and life on the shore ; every body so busy and active and bright . "
129011	129107	129009	129009	Tom	132	" she sighed , and wondered whether his ruined life would ever come to any happy ending , except death . She hurried on , and soon found the street where she had taken his lodging . At the corner of it was , as is too usual in London streets , a public house , about which more than the usual number of disreputable idlers were hanging . There were also one or two policemen , who were ordering the little crowd to give way to a group of twelve men , coming out . "
129112	129116	129117	129117	Coroner	2920	" asked Elizabeth . "
129128	129203	129117	129117	Coroner	2920	" Elizabeth , who had never come into contact with any thing of the sort , stood aside with a sense of awe , to let the little procession pass , and then followed up the street . It stopped ; oh no ! not at that door ! But it was ; there was no mistaking the number , nor the drawn - down blind in the upper room — Tom 's room . "
129208	129221	129224	129224	nobody	357	" she asked , in a whisper that made the policeman stare . "
129259	129283	129256	129256	God	105	" Ay , that familiar phrase , our English law 's solemn recognition of our national religious feeling , was true . God had "
129285	129350	129354	129354	she	2923	" poor Tom ; he suffered no more . Elizabeth leaned against the door - way , and saw the twelve jurymen go up stairs with a clatter of feet , and come down again , one after the other , less noisily , and some of them looking grave . Nobody took any notice of her , until the lodging house mistress appeared . "
129388	129470	129376	129376	She	2923	" And pulling Elizabeth after her , the landlady burst into a torrent of explanation ; how she had done her very best for the poor fellow ; how she listened at his door several times during the first day , and heard him cough , that is , she thought she had , but toward night all was so very quiet ; and there having come a letter by post , she thought she would take it up to him . "
129503	129504	129479	129479	I	0	" "
129514	129548	129509	129509	I	0	" said somebody behind ; a young man , very shabbily dressed , with a large beard . He pushed aside the landlady and Elizabeth , till he saw the latter 's face . "
129564	129704	129509	129509	I	0	" he called out ; and his authoritative manner impressed the jurymen , who gathered around him , ready and eager to hear any thing he could say . He gave his name as John Smith , druggist 's assistant ; said that the young man who lodged up stairs , whose death he had only just heard of , had been his patient for some months , and was in the last stage of consumption . He had no doubt the death had ensued from perfectly natural causes , as he explained in such technical language as completely to overpower the jury , and satisfy them accordingly . They quitted the parlor , and proceeded to the public house , where , after a brief consultation , they delivered their verdict , as the astute policeman had foretold , "
129712	129824	129710	129710	God	105	" took pipes and brandy all round at the bar , and then adjourned to their several homes , gratified at having done their duty to their country . Meantime , Elizabeth crept up stairs . Nobody hindered or followed her ; nobody cared any thing for the solitary dead . There he lay — poor Tom ! almost as she had left him ; the counterpane was hardly disturbed , the candle she had placed on the chair had burned down to a bit of wick , which still lay in the socket . Nobody had touched him , or any thing about him , as , in all cases of "
129828	129948	129710	129710	God	105	" English law exacts . Whether he had died soon after she quitted him that night , or whether he had lingered through the long hours of darkness , or of day - light following , alive and conscious perhaps , yet too weak to call any one , even had there been any one he cared to call — when , or how , the spirit had passed away unto Him who gave it , were mysteries that could never be known . But it was all over now ; he lay at rest with the death smile on his face . Elizabeth , as she stood and looked at him , could not , dared not weep . "
129958	130270	129956	129956	Tom	132	" was all she thought , and knew that he was all her own now ; that she had loved him through every thing , and loved him to the end . Elizabeth spent the greatest part of her holiday in that house , in that room . Nobody interfered with her ; nobody asked in what relation she stood to the deceased , or what right she had to take upon herself the arrangements for his funeral . Every body was only too glad to let her assume a responsibility which would otherwise have fallen on the parish . The only person who appeared to remember either her or the dead man was the druggist 's assistant , who sent in the necessary medical certificate as to the cause of death . Elizabeth took it to the Registrar , and thence proceeded to an undertaker hard by , with whom she arranged all about the funeral , and that it should took place in the new cemetery at Kensal Green . She thought she should like that better than a close , noisy London church yard . Before she left the house she saw poor Tom laid in his coffin , and covered up forever from mortal eyes . Then , and not till then , she sat herself down beside him and wept . Nobody contested with her the possession of the few things that had belonged to him , which were scarcely more than the clothes he had on when he died ; so she made them up into a parcel and took them away with her . In his waistcoat pocket she found one book , a little Testament , which she had given him herself . It looked as if it had been a good deal read . If all his studies , all his worship of "
130274	130507	129956	129956	Tom	132	" as the one supreme good , had ended in that , it was a blessed ending . When she reached home Elizabeth went at once to her master , returned him his letter of recommendation , and explained to him that his kindness was not needed now . Mr. Ascott seemed a good deal shocked , inquired from her a few particulars , and again took out his purse , his one panacea for all mortal woes . But Elizabeth declined ; she said she would only ask him for an advance of her next half - year 's wages . She preferred burying her old friend herself . She buried him , herself the only mourner , on a bright summer 's day , with the sun shining dazzlingly on the white grave stones in Kensal Green . The clergyman appeared , read the service , and went away again . A few minutes ended it all . When the undertaker and his men had also departed , she sat down on a bench near to watch the sexton filling up the grave — Tom 's grave . She was very quiet , and none but a closely observant person watching her face could have penetrated into the truth of what your impulsive characters , always in the extremes of mirth or misery , never understand about quiet people , that "
130513	130593	130594	130594	I	0	" While she sat there some one came past her , and turned round . It was the shabby - looking chemist 's assistant , who had a appeared at the inquest , and given the satisfactory evidence which had prevented the necessity of her giving - hers . Elizabeth rose and acknowledged him with a respectable courtesy ; for under his threadbare clothes was the bearing of a gentleman , and he had been so kind to Tom . "
130599	130603	130594	130594	I	0	" he said ; "
130625	130626	130609	130609	I	0	" "
130632	130668	130630	130630	Sir	3469	" replied Elizabeth , gratefully . The young man stood before her , looking at her earnestly for a minute or two , and then exclaimed , with a complete change of voice and manner . "
130685	130736	130683	130683	Johanna	93	" It was Ascott Leaf . But no wonder Elizabeth had not recognized him . His close cropped hair , his large beard hiding half his face , and a pair of spectacles which he had assumed , were a sufficient disguise . Besides , the great change from his former "
130738	130786	130787	130788	John Smith	125	" appearance to the extreme of shabbiness ; his clothes being evidently worn as long as they could possibly hold together , and his generally depressed air , giving the effect of one who had gone down in the world , made him , even without the misleading "
130790	130803	130787	130788	John Smith	125	" most unlikely to be identified with the Ascott Leaf of old . "
130813	130826	130811	130811	Sir	3469	" said Elizabeth truthfully , when her astonishment had a little subsided ; "
130844	130845	130847	130847	you	0	" "
130901	130902	130884	130884	You	0	" "
130907	130908	130884	130884	You	0	" "
130923	130985	130921	130921	Johanna	93	" And sitting down in the sunshine , with his arms upon the back of the bench , and his hand hiding his eyes , the poor prodigal listened in silence to every thing Elizabeth told him ; of his Aunt Selina 's marriage and death , and of Mr. Lyon 's return , and of the happy home at Liverpool . "
130994	131001	130986	130986	They	3640	" said he , at length ; "
131074	131115	131072	131072	Elizabeth	94	" With a humility and friendliness , strange enough in Ascott Leaf , he held out his hand — empty , for he had nothing to give now — to his aunt 's old servant . But Elizabeth detained him . "
131131	131152	131153	131153	I	0	" And then she added , with an earnest respectfulness that touched the heart of the poor , shabby man , "
131214	131215	131206	131206	you	3469	" "
131267	131295	131296	131296	Elizabeth	94	" Ascott sighed , drew his rusty coat sleeves across his eyes , and sat contemplating his boots , which were any thing but dandy boots now . "
131366	131385	131359	131359	he	132	" Elizabeth considered a moment , and then told the simple fact ; it could not matter now . "
131408	131409	131406	131406	her	3240	" "
131416	131471	131406	131406	her	3240	" Perhaps nothing could have shown the great change in Ascott more than the tone in which he uttered these words ; a tone of entire respect and kindly pity , from which he never once departed during that conversation , and many , many others , so long as their confidential relations lasted . "
131506	131671	131489	131489	I	0	" Ascott yielded . He had been so long , so utterly forlorn . He sat down beside Elizabeth , and then , with eyes often averted , and with many breaks between , which she had to fill up as best as she could , he told her all his story , even to the sad secret of all , which had caused him to run away from home , and hide himself in the last place where they would have thought he was , the safe wilderness of London . There , carefully disguised , he had lived decently while his money lasted , and then , driven step by step to the brink of destitution , he had offered himself for employment in the lowest grade of his own profession , and been taken as assistant by the not over scrupulous chemist and druggist in that not too respectable neighborhood of Westminster , with a salary of twenty pounds a year . "
131679	131688	131689	131689	I	0	" added he , with a bitter smile . "
131755	131756	131757	131757	They	3640	" "
131778	131800	131769	131769	they	3640	" Ascott drew himself up a little , and his chest heaved visibly under the close buttoned , thread bare coat . "
131816	131825	131769	131769	they	3640	" Ay , that wonderful teacher , Adversity , "
131845	131975	131769	131769	they	3640	" had left behind this jewel in the young man 's heart . A disguised , beggared outcast , he had found out the value of an honest name ; forsaken , unfriended , he had learned the preciousness of home and love ; made a servant of , tyrannized over , and held in low esteem , he had been taught by hard experience the secret of true humility and charity — the esteeming of others better than himself . Not with all natures does misfortune so work , but it did with his . He had sinned ; he had paid the cost of his sin in bitter suffering ; but the result was cheaply bought , and he already began to feel that it was so . "
131978	131991	131769	131769	they	3640	" said he , in answer to a question of Elizabeth 's , "
132072	132073	132066	132066	I	0	" "
132078	132083	132076	132076	Sir	3469	" asked Elizabeth earnestly , "
132095	132096	132097	132097	I	0	" "
132111	132115	132108	132108	I	0	" he added , "
132202	132203	132182	132182	he	132	" "
132209	132210	132182	132182	he	132	" "
132257	132258	132241	132241	I	0	" "
132261	132269	132241	132241	I	0	" said Elizabeth , after a pause , "
132295	132296	132297	132297	Elizabeth	94	" "
132299	132308	132297	132297	Elizabeth	94	" said he , in a humbled tone , "
132338	132392	132329	132329	you	3469	" She thought the question over in her clear head ; clear still , even at this hour , when she had to think for others , though all personal feeling and interest were buried in that grave over which the sexton was now laying the turf that would soon grow smoothly green . "
132442	132443	132447	132447	you	3469	" "
132452	132459	132445	132445	Jove	235	" cried Ascott , starting up . "
132500	132799	132800	132801	John Smith	125	" She smiled — a very sad smile — but still she felt glad . Any thing that she could possibly do for any creature belonging to her dear mistresses seemed to this faithful servant the natural and bounden duty of her life . Long after the young man , whose mercurial temperament no trouble could repress , had gone away in excellent spirits , leaving her an address where she could always find him , and give him regular news of his aunts , though he made her promise to give them , as yet , no tidings in return , Elizabeth sat still , watching the sun decline and the shadows lengthen over the field of graves . In the calmness and beauty of this solitary place an equal calm seemed to come over her ; a sense of how wonderfully events had linked themselves together and worked themselves out ; how even poor Tom 's mournful death had brought about this meeting , which might end in restoring to her beloved mistresses their lost sheep , their outcast , miserable boy . She did not reason the matter out , but she felt it , and felt that in making her in some degree His instrument God had been very good to her in the midst of her desolation . It seemed Elizabeth 's lot always to have to put aside her own troubles for the trouble of somebody else . Almost immediately after Tom Cliffe 's death her little Henry fell ill with scarlatina and remained for many months in a state of health so fragile as to engross all her thought and care . It was with difficulty that she contrived a few times to go for Henry 's medicines to the shop where "
132802	132841	132842	132846	the gentleman " in him	5359	" served . She noticed that every time he looked healthier , brighter , freer from that aspect of broken - down respectability which had touched her so much . He did not dress any better , but still "
132844	132861	132863	132864	a gentleman	3465	" in him could never be hidden or lost , and he said his master treated him "
132866	132874	132863	132864	a gentleman	3465	" which was apparently a pleasant novelty . "
132954	132962	132935	132935	you	94	" ( naming two popular magazines ) , "
132985	133025	132981	132981	I	0	" He slapped his chest with Ascott 's merry laugh of old . It cheered Elizabeth for a long while afterward . By - and - by she had to take little Henry to Brighton , and lost sight of "
133028	133086	132981	132981	I	0	" for some time longer . It was on a snowy February day , when , having brought the child home quite strong , and received unlimited gratitude and guineas from the delighted father , Master Henry 's faithful nurse stood in her usual place at the dining - room door , waiting for the interminable grace of "
133091	133113	133114	133116	A young man	1903	" to be over , and her boy carried ignominiously but contentedly to bed . The footman knocked at the door . "
133126	133134	133114	133116	A young man	1903	" Let him send in his name . "
133135	133146	133177	133184	the shabby young man with the long beard	2985	" He says you would n't know it , Sir . "
133147	133165	133114	133116	A young man	1903	" Show him in , then . Probably a case of charity , as usual . Oh ! "
133246	133326	133241	133241	He	97	" Come a - begging , young man , I suppose ? Wants a situation , as hundreds do , and think that I have half the clerkships in the city at my disposal , and that I am made of money besides . But it 's no good , I tell you , Sir ; I never give nothing to strangers , except — Here , Henry , my son , take that person there this half crown . "
133387	133394	133357	133357	He	2986	" Young man , young fellow — "
133395	133422	133423	133423	he	97	" I see you do n't know me , Mr. Ascott , and it 's not surprising . But I have come to repay you this — "
133434	133450	133423	133423	he	97	" Also , to thank you earnestly for not prosecuting me , and to say — "
133451	133453	133357	133357	He	2986	" Good God!"—the
133466	133487	133456	133457	Peter Ascott	202	" Ascott Leaf , is that you ? I thought you were in Australia , or dead , or something . "
133488	133549	133423	133423	he	97	" No , I 'm alive and here , more 's the pity perhaps . Except that I have lived to pay you back what I cheated you out of . What you generously gave me I ca n't pay , though I may sometime . Meantime , I have brought you this . It 's honestly earned . Yes . "
133556	133575	133423	133423	he	97	" though I have hardly a coat to my back , I assure you it 's honestly earned . "
133618	133631	133615	133615	his	97	" Mrs. Hand , you had better take Master Henry up stairs . "
133663	133667	133676	133677	Mr. Ascott	97	" shabby young man "
133844	133881	133837	133837	He	97	" I wanted to ask you if you have any message for Liverpool . I go there to - morrow on business for Mr. Ascott , and afterward I shall probably go and see my aunts . "
133894	133914	133837	133837	He	97	" Of course , I shall tell them all about you , Elizabeth . Any special message , eh ? "
133915	133930	133932	133932	Elizabeth	94	" Only my duty , Sir , and Master Henry is quite well again , "
134080	134084	134086	134086	she	94	" Poor Tom , "
134113	134127	134105	134106	his aunts	3135	" Well , Tom would be glad too , if he knew all . "
134232	134236	134231	134231	her	94	" Mammy Lizzie . "
