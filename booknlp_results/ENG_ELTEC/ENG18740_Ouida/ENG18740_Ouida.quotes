161	180	155	155	they	226	" How good it is to be so old as that — how good , how very good ! "
1341	1377	1379	1381	the old man	285	" Live in it , little one , and take nobody in it to worry you , and be good to the bird and the goat , and be sure to keep the flowers blowing , "
1727	1738	1740	1743	the first of them	308	" You are too young to live alone , Bébée , "
1745	1757	1740	1743	the first of them	308	" My old mother shall come and keep house for you . "
1758	1770	1772	1773	the second	309	" Nay , better come and live with me , Bébée , "
1775	1798	1772	1773	the second	309	" I will give you bit and drop , and clothing , too , for the right to your plot of ground . "
1799	1806	1808	1809	the third	310	" That is to cheat her , "
1811	1867	1808	1809	the third	310	" Hark , here , Bébée : my sister , who is a lone woman , as you know well , shall come and bide with you , and ask you nothing — nothing at all — only you shall just give her a crust , perhaps , and a few flowers to sell sometimes . "
1868	1873	1875	1876	the fourth	311	" No , no , "
1878	1938	1875	1876	the fourth	311	" that will not do . You let me have the garden and the hut , Bébée , and my sons shall till the place for you ; and I will live with you myself , and leave the boys the cabin , so you will have all the gain , do you not see , dear little one ? "
1939	1942	1944	1945	the fifth	312	" Pooh ! "
1955	2097	1944	1945	the fifth	312	" You are all eager for your own good , not for hers . Now I — Father Francis says we should all do as we would be done by — I will take Bébée to live with me , all for nothing ; and we will root the flowers up and plant it with good cabbages and potatoes and salad plants . And I will stable my cows in the hut to sweeten it after a dead man , and I will take my chance of making money out of it , and no one can speak more fair than that when one sees what weather is , and thinks what insects do ; and all the year round , winter and summer , Bébée here will want for nothing , and have to take no care for herself whatever . "
2724	2737	2738	2738	she	101	" You are very good , no doubt , all of you , "
2743	2871	2738	2738	she	101	" But I can not tell you that I am thankful , for my heart is like a stone , and I think it is not so very much for me as it is for the hut that you are speaking . Perhaps it is wrong in me to say so ; yes , I am wrong , I am sure,—you are all kind , and I am only Bébée . But you see he told me to live here and take care of the flowers , and I must do it , that is certain . I will ask Father Francis , if you wish : but if he tells me I am wrong , as you do . I shall stay here all the same . "
2967	2977	2979	2979	Bébée	101	" But there is nobody that has the right , "
3001	3131	2979	2979	Bébée	101	" He told me to stay here , and he would not have said so if it had been wrong ; and I am old enough to do for myself , and I am not afraid , and who is there that would hurt me ? Oh , yes ; go and tell Father Francis , if you like ! I do not believe he will blame me , but if he do , I must bear it . Even if he shut the church door on me , I will obey Antoine , and the flowers will know I am right , and they will let no evil spirits touch me , for the flowers are strong for that ; they talk to the angels in the night . "
3628	3635	3647	3647	they	365	" My mother was a flower . "
3636	3646	3647	3647	they	365	" You are a flower , at any rate , "
4007	4019	4021	4022	the child	377	" Each of them wants to get something out of me , "
4024	4082	4021	4022	the child	377	" Well , I will live alone , then , and do my duty , just as he said . The flowers will never let any real harm come , though they do look so indifferent and smiling sometimes , and though not one of them hung their heads when his coffin was carried through them yesterday . "
4141	4153	4155	4155	Bébée	101	" I suppose God cares ; but I wish they did . "
4167	4174	4175	4175	she	101	" Why do you not care ? "
4202	4224	4189	4190	The pinks	381	" Why should we care for anything , unless a slug be eating us?—that is real woe , if you like . "
4258	4266	4267	4267	she	101	" He was so good to you ! "
4282	4343	4267	4267	she	101	" He never let you know heat or cold , he never let the worm gnaw or the snail harm you ; he would get up in the dark to see after your wants ; and when the ice froze over you , he was there to loosen your chains . Why do you not care , anyone of you ? "
4344	4350	4267	4267	she	101	" How silly you are ! "
4355	4415	4267	4267	she	101	" You must be a butterfly or a poet , Bébée , to be as foolish as that . Some one will do all he did . We are of market value , you know . Care , indeed ! when the sun is so warm , and there is not an earwig in the place to trouble us . "
4693	4715	4717	4717	Bébée	101	" When one cuts the best blossoms for her , and tries to be good , and never tells a lie , "
4719	4739	4717	4717	Bébée	101	" I am quite sure , as she loves the lilies , that she will never altogether forget me . "
4850	4865	4867	4868	Father Francis	105	" You are a little wilful one , and too young to live alone , "
5675	5684	5693	5693	It	426	" Bébée , Bébée — bonjour , bonjour . "
5746	5758	5731	5731	she	101	" How good it is to live when one is young ! "
5794	5807	5778	5779	Mère Krebs	106	" What a fine thing to be sixteen!—a merry year , Bébée . "
5825	5843	5808	5808	Marthe	111	" The Holy Saints keep you , Bébée ; why , you are quite a woman now ! "
5911	5922	5923	5923	they	432	" Only see , Bébée ! Such a grand cake ! "
5931	5973	5923	5923	they	432	" Jules picked the plums , and Jeanne washed the almonds , and Christine took the ribbon off her own communion cap , all for you — all for you ; but you will let us come and eat it too ? "
6005	6026	6027	6027	Bébée	101	" I have nothing to give you , little one , except my blessing , if you care for that . "
6081	6150	6151	6151	Bébée	101	" A merry year , and the blessing of Heaven , Bébée ! Come up , and here is my first dish of cherries for you ; not tasted one myself ; they will make you a feast with Varnhart 's cake , though she should have known better , so poor as she is . Charity begins at home , and these children 's stomachs are empty . "
6195	6203	6204	6204	she	101	" What a supper we will have ! "
6383	6395	6396	6396	he	450	" Come in , my pretty one , for a second , "
6413	6548	6549	6549	Bébée	101	" Come in ; I have something for you . They were my dead daughter's — you have heard me talk of her — Lisette , who died forty year or more ago , they say ; for me I think it was yesterday . Mère Krebs — she is a hard woman — heard me talking of my girl . She burst out laughing , ' Lord 's sake , fool , why , your girl would be sixty now an she had lived . ' Well , so it may be ; you see , the new mill was put up the week she died , and you call the new mill old ; but , my girl , she is young to me . Always young . Come here , Bébée . "
6671	6677	6678	6678	he	285	" They are all hers , "
6679	6737	6813	6813	he	285	whispered,—"all hers . And sometimes in the evening time I see her coming along the lane for them — do you not know ? There is nothing changed ; nothing changed ; the grass , and the trees , and the huts , and the pond are all here ; why should she only be gone away ? "
6738	6743	6678	6678	he	285	" Antoine is gone . "
6744	6757	6758	6758	He	285	" Yes . But he was old ; my girl is young . "
6804	6812	6813	6813	he	285	" They say she would be sixty , "
6822	6966	6813	6813	he	285	" But that is absurd , you know . Why , she had cheeks like yours , and she would run — no lapwing could fly faster over corn . These are her things , you see ; yes — all of them . That is the sprig of sweetbrier she wore in her belt the day before the wagon knocked her down and killed her . I have never touched the things . But look here , Bébée , you are a good child and true , and like her just a little . I mean to give you her silver clasps . They were her great - great - great - grandmother 's before her . God knows how old they are not . And a girl should have some little wealth of that sort ; and for Antoine 's sake — "
7132	7171	7173	7173	Bébée	101	" Oh , Bébée ! how you glitter ! Did the Virgin send you that off her own altar ? Let me see — let me touch ! Is it made of the stars or of the sun ? "
7243	7271	7273	7274	Trine Krebs	118	" There is not such another set of clasps in Brabant ; old work you could make a fortune of in the curiosity shops in the Montagne , "
7285	7306	7273	7274	Trine Krebs	118	" But , all the same , you know , Bébée , things off a dead body bring mischance sometimes . "
7589	7609	7610	7610	people	337	" Go to the Madeleine ; you will make money there , with your pretty blue eyes , Bébée , "
8278	8291	8272	8272	she	101	" If only I knew a little — just a very little ! "
9227	9243	9216	9216	Bébée	101	" Perhaps some one will come some day who will tell me all those things . "
9572	9584	9560	9560	her	101	" What does she see there?—the dead people or the angels ? "
9684	9702	9704	9708	one of the hen wives	639	" I remembered it was your name - day , child Here are half a dozen eggs , "
9874	9877	9826	9826	Bébée	101	" Laus Deo "
10181	10232	10171	10171	his	662	" Bébée , as it is your feast day , come and stroll in St. Hubert 's gallery , and I will buy you a little gilt heart , or a sugar - apple stick , or a ribbon , and we can see the puppet show afterwards , eh ? "
11053	11063	11049	11050	the people	504	" What does she see?—the angels or the dead ? "
11231	11242	11243	11244	a man	710	" Have you a rosebud left to sell to me ? "
11308	11324	11325	11325	she	101	" I do not sell flowers here , but I will give them to you , "
11335	11341	11343	11344	the stranger	711	" I often want flowers , "
11352	11361	11343	11344	the stranger	711	" Where do you sell yours?—in the market ? "
11362	11368	11329	11329	her	101	" In the Grande Place . "
11369	11380	11329	11329	her	101	" Will you tell me your name , pretty one ? "
11381	11386	11389	11389	people	337	" I am Bébée . "
11449	11474	11441	11441	She	101	" Good night ; I can not stay . I have a cake at home to - night , and the children are waiting . "
11475	11499	11500	11500	He	710	" Ah ! that is important , no doubt , indeed . Will you buy some more cakes for the children from me ? "
11535	11557	11529	11529	she	101	" I will not take money in church , nor anywhere , except what the flowers are worth . Good night . "
11648	11660	11667	11667	he	710	" You are in such a hurry because of the cake ? "
11684	11701	11671	11671	Bébée	101	" Yes , they will be waiting , you know , and there are cherries too . "
11702	11713	11680	11680	her	101	" It is a grand day with you , then ? "
11714	11725	11726	11726	She	101	" It is my fête day : I am sixteen . "
11743	11754	11732	11732	She	101	" Ah , you feel old , I dare say ? "
11755	11771	11680	11680	her	101	" Oh , quite old ! They can not call me a child any more . "
11772	11789	11680	11680	her	101	" Of course not , it would be ridiculous . Are those presents in your basket ? "
11790	11798	11799	11799	She	101	" Yes , every one of them . "
11820	11849	11799	11799	She	101	" Look ! old Gringoire gave me these . I shall wear them at mass next Sunday . I never had a pair of shoes in my life . "
11850	11860	11680	11680	her	101	" But how will you wear shoes without stockings ? "
11877	11887	11888	11888	she	101	" Perhaps I can save money and buy some , "
11896	11916	11888	11888	she	101	" But that I could not do till next year . They would cost several francs , I suppose . "
11917	11927	11928	11928	Bébée	101	" Unless a good fairy gives them to you ? "
11951	11961	11962	11962	she	101	" Sometimes I pray very much and things come , "
11966	12026	11962	11962	she	101	" When the Gloire de Dijon was cut back too soon one summer , and never blossomed , and we all thought it was dead , I prayed all day long for it , and never thought of anything else ; and by autumn it was all in new leaf , and now its flowers are finer than ever . "
12027	12039	12043	12043	her	101	" But you watered it whilst you prayed , I suppose ? "
12177	12207	12209	12209	she	101	" Sir,—I do not know you,—why should you come with me ? Do not do it , please . You make me talk , and that makes me late . "
12241	12249	12250	12250	he	711	" To - morrow , little one , "
12295	12302	12303	12303	they	738	" A new model,—that pretty peasant ? "
12520	12549	12504	12505	the children	373	" Oh , dear little Jesus , come and sup with us , and bring your beautiful Mother , too ; we will not forget you are God . "
12711	12716	12696	12697	the children	373	" Ave Maria Stella Virginis "
12964	12991	12993	12993	Bébée	101	" Oh , dear swans , how good it is to be sixteen!—how good it is to live at all!—do you not tell the willows so ? "
13076	13080	13081	13081	she	101	" Good night ! "
13111	13133	13135	13135	Bébée	101	" If I could save a centime a day , I could buy a pair of stockings this time next year , "
13295	13314	13316	13316	Bébée	101	" And besides , if I can save a centime , the Varnhart children ought to have it , "
13422	13433	13434	13434	she	101	" One could not move half so easily in stockings , "
13578	13592	13556	13576	the tinker , who was busy quarrelling with his wife and letting his smelting fire burn a hole in his breeches	779	" The box was certainly for her , since it was set upon her chair?"—Bébée
13813	13823	13824	13824	Bébée	101	" Have you more moss - roses for me ? "
13866	13879	13880	13880	he	792	" You are not too proud to be paid to - day ? "
13921	13930	13931	13931	he	792	" You do not seem to remember me ? "
13939	13946	13948	13948	Bébée	101	" Oh , I remember you , "
13955	13974	13948	13948	Bébée	101	" But you know I speak to so many people , and they are all nothing to me . "
13975	13982	14004	14004	him	792	" Who is anything to you ? "
13996	14001	14002	14002	she	101	" Varnhart 's children , "
14008	14039	14002	14002	she	101	" And old Annémie by the wharfside — and Tambour — and Antoine 's grave — and the starling — and , of course , above all , the flowers . "
14040	14053	14054	14054	She	101	" And the fairies , I suppose?—though they do nothing for you . "
14061	14093	14054	14054	She	101	" They have done something to - day . I have found a box , and some stockings — such beautiful stockings ! Silk ones ! Is it not very odd ? "
14094	14112	14002	14002	she	101	" It is more odd they should have forgotten you so long . May I see them ? "
14113	14141	14054	14054	She	101	" I can not show them to you now . Those ladies are going to buy . But you can see them later — if you wait . "
14142	14151	14054	14054	She	101	" I will wait and paint the Broodhuis . "
14152	14165	14002	14002	she	101	" So many people do that ; you are a painter then ? "
14166	14173	14174	14174	He	792	" Yes — in a way . "
14504	14506	14503	14506	the " Gueux "	2034	" Gueux "
14599	14611	14612	14612	she	101	" Oh , men of Brussels ; fie then for shame ! "
14623	14724	14612	14612	she	101	" Did never you see a drawing before ? and are there not saints and martyrs enough to look at in the galleries ? and have you never some better thing to do than to gape wide - mouthed at a stranger ? What laziness — ah ! Just worthy of a people who sleep and smoke while their dogs work for them ! Go away , all of you ; look , there comes the gendarme — it will be the worse for you . Sir , sit under my stall ; they will not dare trouble you then . "
14942	14952	14953	14953	she	101	" Do you think it could be the fairies ? "
14992	14998	14999	14999	he	818	" Impossible to doubt it ! "
15004	15037	14999	14999	he	818	" Given a belief in fairies at all , why should there be any limit to what they can do ? It is the same with the saints , is it not ? "
15038	15041	15043	15043	Bébée	101	" Yes , "
15072	15100	15101	15101	Bébée	101	" Well , then , you will wear the stockings , will you not ? Only , believe me , your feet are far prettier without them . "
15132	15140	15127	15127	she	101	" Did not you put them there ? "
15141	15144	15165	15165	Bébée	101	" I?—never ! "
15145	15151	15127	15127	she	101	" Are you quite sure ? "
15152	15159	15127	15127	she	101	" Quite ; but why ask ? "
15160	15163	15165	15165	Bébée	101	" Because , "
15176	15203	15127	15127	she	101	away,—"because I would not take it if you did . You are a stranger , and a present is a debt , so Antoine always said . "
15204	15225	15127	15127	she	101	" Why take a present then from the Varnhart children , or your old friend who gave you the clasps ? "
15226	15303	15127	15127	she	101	" Ah , that is very different . When people are very , very poor , equally poor , the one with the other , little presents that they save for and make with such a difficulty are just things that are a pleasure ; sacrifices ; like your sitting up with a sick person at night , and then she sits up with you another year when you want it . Do you not know ? "
15304	15331	15127	15127	she	101	" I know you talk very prettily . But why should you not take any one else 's present , though he may not be poor ? "
15332	15340	15127	15127	she	101	" Because I could not return it . "
15341	15346	15127	15127	she	101	" Could you not ? "
15380	15387	15388	15388	she	832	" No ; how could I ? "
15392	15440	15388	15388	she	832	" If I were to save for two years , I could not get francs enough to buy anything worth giving back ; and I should be so unhappy , thinking of the debt of it always . Do tell me if you put those stockings there ? "
15441	15443	15445	15445	he	831	" No "
15471	15478	15479	15479	he	831	" Well , if I did ? "
15484	15507	15479	15479	he	831	" you wished for them ; what harm was there ? Will you be so cruel as to refuse them from me ? "
15534	15542	15543	15543	she	832	" It was very kind and good , "
15548	15642	15643	15643	She	832	" But I can not think why you should have done it , as you had never known me at all . And , indeed , I could not take them , because Antoine would not let me if he were alive ; and if I gave you a flower every day all the year round I should not pay you the worth of them , it would be quite impossible ; and why should you tell me falsehoods about such a thing ? A falsehood is never a thing for a man . "
15942	15971	15972	15972	He	831	" Was I rude ? I did not mean to be . But I can not take the stockings ; and why did you tell me that falsehood ? "
15991	16025	15984	15984	he	831	" Let us forget the whole matter ; it is not worth a sou . If you do not take the box , leave it ; it is of no use to me . "
16026	16033	16034	16034	She	832	" I can not take it . "
16057	16121	16045	16045	he	831	" Leave it then , I say . You are not the first woman , my dear , who has quarrelled with a wish fulfilled . It is a way your sex has of rewarding gods and men.—Here , you old witch , here is a treasure - trove for you . You can sell it for ten francs in the town anywhere . "
16299	16305	16306	16306	he	831	" Good night , Bébée , "
16317	16344	16306	16306	he	831	" Good night , my dear . To - morrow I will finish my painting ; but I will not offend you by any more gifts . "
16372	16384	16385	16385	she	101	" Sir , see , you speak to me quite wrongly , "
16402	16622	16385	16385	she	101	" Say it was kind to bring me what I wished for ; yes , it was kind I know ; but you never saw me till last night , and I can not tell even your name ; and it is very wrong to lie to any one , even to a little thing like me ; and I am only Bébée , and can not give you anything back , because I have only just enough to feed myself and the starling , and not always that in winter . I thank you very much for what you wished to do ; but if I had taken those things , I think you would have thought me very mean and full of greed ; and Antoine always said , ' Do not take what you can not pay — not ever what you can not pay — that is the way to walk with pure feet . ' Perhaps I spoke ill , because they spoil me , and they say I am too swift to say my mind . But I am not thankless — not thankless , indeed — it is only I could not take what I can not pay . That is all . You are angry still — not now — no ? "
17063	17075	17076	17078	one or two	855	" How late you are working to - night , Bébée ! "
17141	17150	17151	17151	she	101	" Little ugly , shameful , naked feet ! "
18615	18696	18606	18606	Bébée	101	" Oh , mother Annémie , look here ! Beautiful red and white currants , and a roll ; I saved them for you . They are the first currants we have seen this year . Me ? oh , for me , I have eaten more than are good ! You know I pick fruit like a sparrow , always . Dear mother Annémie , are you better ? Are you quite sure you are better to - day ? "
18742	18757	18758	18758	she	929	" Why had you not a grandmother of your own , my little one ? "
18761	18773	18758	18758	she	929	" How good you would have been to her , Bébée ! "
18774	18777	18779	18779	Bébée	101	" Yes , "
18807	18845	18803	18803	Antoine	103	" How much work have you done , Annémie ? Oh , all that ? all that ? But there is enough for a week . You work too early and too late , you dear Annémie . "
18846	18882	18758	18758	she	929	" Nay , Bébée , when one has to get one 's bread that can not be . But I am afraid my eyes are failing . That rose now , is it well done ? "
18883	18910	18758	18758	she	929	" Beautifully done . Would the Baës take them if they were not ? You know he is one that cuts every centime in four pieces . "
18911	18949	18803	18803	Antoine	103	" Ah ! sharp enough , sharp enough , that is true . But I am always afraid of my eyes . I do not see the flags out there so well as I used to do . "
18950	19000	19001	19003	The old woman	627	" Because the sun is so bright , Annémie ; that is all . I myself , when I have been sitting all day in the place in the light , the flowers look pale to me . And you know it is not age with me , Annémie ? "
19015	19026	19028	19029	old Annémie	142	" You have a merry heart , dear little one , "
19031	19040	19028	19029	old Annémie	142	" The saints keep it to you always . "
19041	19050	19001	19003	The old woman	627	" May I tidy the room a little ? "
19051	19082	19102	19102	she	101	" To be sure , dear , and thank you too . I have not much time , you see ; and somehow my back aches badly when I stoop . "
19083	19098	19100	19100	Bébée	101	" And it is so damp here for you , over all that water ! "
19135	19296	19102	19102	she	101	" It is so damp here . You should have come and lived in my hut with me , Annémie , and sat out under the vine all day , and looked after the chickens for me when I was in the town . They are such mischievous little souls ; as soon as my back is turned one or other is sure to push through the roof , and get out among the flower - beds . Will you never change your mind , and live with me , Annémie ? I am sure you would be happy , and the starling says your name quite plain , and he is such a funny bird to talk to ; you never would tire of him . Will you never come ? It is so bright there , and green and sweet smelling ; and to think you never even have seen it!—and the swans and all,—it is a shame . "
19297	19302	19304	19305	old Annémie	142	" No , dear , "
19314	19990	19991	19991	Bébée	101	" You have said so so often , and you are good and mean it , that I know . But I could not leave the water . It would kill me . Out of this window you know I saw my Jeannot 's brig go away — away — away — till the masts were lost in the mists . Going with iron to Norway ; the ' Fleur d'Epine ' of this town , a good ship , and a sure , and her mate ; and as proud as might be , and with a little blest Mary in lead round his throat . She was to be back in port in eight months , bringing timber . Eight months — that brought Easter time . But she never came . Never , never , never , you know . I sat here watching them come and go , and my child sickened and died , and the summer passed , and the autumn , and all the while I looked — looked — looked ; for the brigs are all much alike ; and only her I always saw as soon as she hove in sight ( because he tied a hank of flax to her mizzen - mast ) ; and when he was home safe and sound I spun the hank into hose for him ; that was a fancy of his , and for eleven voyages , one on another , he had never missed to tie the flax nor I to spin the hose . But the hank of flax I never saw this time ; nor the brave brig ; nor my good man with his sunny blue eyes . Only one day in winter , when the great blocks of ice were smashing hither and thither , a coaster came in and brought tidings of how off in the Danish waters they had come on a water - logged brig , and had boarded her , and had found her empty , and her hull riven in two , and her crew all drowned and dead beyond any manner of doubt . And on her stern there was her name painted white , the ' Fleur d'Epine , ' of Brussels , as plain as name could be ; and that was all we ever knew : what evil had struck her , or how they had perished , nobody ever told . Only the coaster brought that bit of beam away , with the ' Fleur d'Epine ' writ clear upon it . But you see I never know my man is dead . Any day — who can say?—any one of those ships may bring him aboard of her , and he may leap out on the wharf there , and come running up the stairs as he used to do , and cry , in his merry voice , ' Annémie , Annémie , here is more flax to spin , here is more hose to weave ! ' For that was always his homeward word ; no matter whether he had had fair weather or foul , he always knotted the flax to his masthead . So you see , dear , I could not leave here . For what if he came and found me away ? He would say it was an odd fashion of mourning for him . And I could not do without the window , you know . I can watch all the brigs come in ; and I can smell the shipping smell that I have loved all the days of my life ; and I can see the lads heaving , and climbing , and furling , and mending their bits of canvas , and hauling their flags up and down . And then who can say?—the sea never took him , I think — I think I shall hear his voice before I die . For they do say that God is good . "
20150	20184	20134	20134	Bébée	101	" What can it be to care for another creature like that ? It must be so terrible , and yet it must be beautiful too . Does every one suffer like that ? "
20317	20336	20337	20337	Annémie	142	" Eleven voyages one and another , and he never forgot to tie the flax to the mast , "
20352	20433	20434	20434	Bébée	101	" It used to fly there,—one could see it coming up half a mile off,—just a pale yellow flake on the wind , like a tress of my hair , he would say . No , no , I could not go away ; he may come to - night , to - morrow , any time ; he is not drowned , not my man ; he was all I had , and God is good , they say . "
20516	20520	20521	20521	Bébée	101	" Fleur d'Epine . "
20702	20715	20716	20716	she	101	" What it must be to care for any one like that ! "
20774	20785	20816	20816	she	101	" Have you had a good day , little one ? "
20801	20806	20807	20807	she	101	" It is you ! "
20840	20847	20848	20848	he	960	" Yes , it is I , "
20856	20864	20848	20848	he	960	" Have you forgiven me , Bébée ? "
20883	20893	20894	20894	she	101	" Oh , I did not sleep all night ! "
20899	20931	20932	20932	He	960	" I thought I had been rude and ungrateful , and I could not be sure I had done right , though to have done otherwise would certainly have been wrong . "
20935	20972	20932	20932	He	960	" Well , that is a clearer deduction than is to be drawn from most moral uncertainties . Do not think twice about the matter , my dear . I have not , I assure you . "
20973	20976	20977	20977	She	101	" No ! "
21023	21048	20932	20932	He	960	" No , indeed . And where are you going so fast , as if those wooden shoes of yours were sandals of Mercury ? "
21049	21057	20932	20932	He	960	" Mercury — is that a shoemaker ? "
21058	21115	21116	21116	Bébée	101	" No , my dear . He did a terrible bit of cobbling once , when he made Woman . But he did not shoe her feet with swiftness that I know of ; she only runs away to be run after , and if you do not pursue her , she comes back — always . "
21123	21130	21131	21131	she	101	" I thought God made women , "
21140	21180	21131	21131	she	101	" You call it God . People three thousand years ago called it Mercury or Hermes . Both mean the same thing,—mere words to designate an unknown quality . Where are you going ? Does your home lie here ? "
21181	21190	21192	21192	Bébée	101	" Yes , onward , quite far onward , "
21218	21248	21200	21200	she	101	" You did not come and finish your picture to - day : why was that ? I had a rosebud for you , but it is dead now . "
21249	21264	21192	21192	Bébée	101	" I went to Anvers . You looked for me a little , then ? "
21265	21282	21200	21200	she	101	" Oh , all day long . For I was so afraid I had been ungrateful . "
21283	21328	21192	21192	Bébée	101	" That is very pretty of you . Women are never grateful , my dear , except when they are very ill - treated . Mercury , whom we were talking of , gave them , among other gifts , a dog 's heart . "
21366	21375	21376	21376	he	968	" Why are you in such a hurry ? "
21379	21402	21376	21376	he	968	" The night is cool , and it is only seven o'clock . I will walk part of the way with you . "
21403	21418	21420	21420	Bébée	101	" I am in a hurry because I have Annémie 's patterns to do , "
21436	21564	21565	21565	He	969	" You see , Annémie 's hand shakes and her eyes are dim , and she pricks the pattern all awry and never perceives it ; it would break her heart if one showed her so , but the Baës would not take them as they are ; they are of no use at all . So I prick them out myself on fresh paper , and the Baës thinks it is all her doing , and pays her the same money , and she is quite content . And as I carry the patterns to and fro for her , because she can not walk , it is easy to cheat her like that ; and it is no harm to cheat so , you know . "
21569	21583	21584	21584	he	969	" You are a good little girl , Bébée , I can see . "
21597	21617	21584	21584	he	969	" And who is this Annémie for whom you do so much ? an old woman , I suppose . "
21618	21651	21594	21594	his	969	" Oh , yes , quite old ; incredibly old . Her man was drowned at sea sixty years ago , and she watches for his brig still , night and morning . "
21652	21673	21594	21594	his	969	" The dog 's heart . No doubt he beat her , and had a wife in fifty other ports . "
21674	21679	21681	21681	Bébée	101	" Oh , no ! "
21699	21758	21759	21759	He	954	" She has told me so much of him . He was as good as good could be , and loved her so , and between the voyages they were so happy . Surely that must have been sixty years now , and she is so sorry still , and still will not believe that he was drowned . "
21775	21818	21759	21759	He	954	" Well , yes ; there are women like that , I believe . But be very sure , my dear , he beat her . Of the two , one always holds the whip and uses it , the other crouches . "
21819	21825	21827	21827	Bébée	101	" I do not understand , "
21829	21836	21827	21827	Bébée	101	" No ; but you will . "
21837	21841	21842	21842	He	954	" I will?—when ? "
21846	21864	21842	21842	He	954	" Oh — to - morrow , perhaps , or next year — or when Fate fancies . "
21865	21873	21877	21877	himself	954	" Or rather , when I choose , "
22041	22056	22057	22057	she	101	" You are of the people of Rubes ' country , are you not ? "
22061	22069	22057	22057	she	101	" Of what country , my dear ? "
22070	22081	22083	22083	Bébée	101	" Of the people that live in the gold frames , "
22088	22229	22083	22083	Bébée	101	" In the galleries , you know . I know a charwoman that scrubs the floors of the Arenberg Palace , and she lets me in sometimes to look ; and you are just like those great gentlemen in the gold frames , only you have not a hawk and a sword , and they always have . I used to wonder where they came from , for they are not like any of us one bit , and the charwoman — she is Lisa Dredel , and lives in the street of the Pot d'Etain — always said . ' Dear heart , they all belong to Rubes ' land : we never see their like nowadays . ' But you must come out of Rubes ' land ; at least , I think so , do you not ? "
22266	22271	22272	22272	he	975	" Perhaps I do , "
22299	22364	22274	22274	her	976	" Do you not want to see Rubes ' world , little one ? To see the gold and the grandeur , and the glitter of it all?—never to toil or get tired?—always to move in a pageant?—always to live like the hawks in the paintings you talk of , with silver bells hung round you , and a hood all sewn with pearls ? "
22365	22368	22370	22370	Bébée	101	" No , "
22374	22465	22370	22370	Bébée	101	" I should like to see it , just to see it , as one looks through a grating into the king 's grape - houses here . But I should not like to live in it . I love my hut , and the starling , and the chickens , and what would the garden do without me ? and the children , and the old Annémie ? I could not anyhow , anywhere , be any happier than I am . There is only one thing I wish . "
22466	22472	22274	22274	her	976	" And what is that ? "
22473	22806	22274	22274	her	976	" To know something ; not to be so ignorant . Just look — I can read a Little , it is true : my Hours , and the letters , and when Krebs brings in a newspaper I can read a little of it , not much . I know French well , because Antoine was French himself , and never did talk Flemish to me ; and they being Netherlanders , can not , of course , read the newspapers at all , and so think it very wonderful indeed in me . But what I want is to know things , to know all about what was before ever I was living . St. Gudule now — they say it was built hundreds of years before ; and Rubes again — they say he was a painter king in Antwerpen before the oldest , oldest woman like Annémie ever began to count time . I am sure books tell you all those things , because I see the students coming and going with them ; and when I saw once the millions of books in the Rue du Musée , I asked the keeper what use they were for , and he said , ' To make men wise , my dear . ' But Gringoire Bac , the cobbler , who was with me,—it was a fête day,—Bac , he said , ' Do not you believe that , Bébée ; they only muddle folks ' brains ; for one book tells them one thing , and another book another , and so on , till they are dazed with all the contrary lying ; and if you see a bookish man , be sure you see a very poor creature who could not hoe a patch , or kill a pig , or stitch an upper - leather , were it ever so . ' But I do not believe that Bac said right . Did he ? "
22807	22842	22853	22853	Bébée	101	" I am not sure . On the whole , I think it is the truest remark on literature I have ever heard , and one that shows great judgment in Bac . Well ? "
22843	22851	22853	22853	Bébée	101	" Well , sometimes , you know , "
22864	23104	23105	23105	He	979	confidentially,—"sometimes I talk like this to the neighbors , and they laugh at me . Because Mère Krebs says that when one knows how to spin and sweep and make bread and say one 's prayers and milk a goat or a cow , it is all a woman wants to know this side of heaven . But for me , I can not help it , when I look at those windows in the cathedral , or at those beautiful twisted little spires that are all over our Hôtel de Ville , I want to know who the men were that made them,—what they did and thought,—how they looked and spoke,—how they learned to shape stone into leaves and grasses like that,—how they could imagine all those angel faces on the glass . When I go alone in the quite early morning or at night when it is still — sometimes in winter I have to stay till it is dark over the lace — I hear their feet come after me , and they whisper to me close , ' Look what beautiful things we have done , Bébée , and you all forget us quite . We did what never will die , but our names are as dead as the stones . ' And then I am so sorry for them and ashamed . And I want to know more . Can you tell me ? "
23129	23141	23142	23142	he	979	" Did any one ever speak to you in that way ? "
23146	23149	23150	23150	she	980	" No , "
23154	23308	23309	23309	He	981	" It comes into my head of itself . Sometimes I think the cathedral angels put it there . For the angels must be tired , you know ; always pointing to God and always seeing men turn away , I used to tell Antoine sometimes . But he used to shake his head and say that it was no use thinking ; most likely St. Gudule and St. Michael had set the church down in the night all ready made , why not ? God made the trees , and they were more wonderful , he thought , for his part . And so perhaps they are , but that is no answer . And I do want to know . I want some one who will tell me ; and if you come out of Rubes ' country as I think , no doubt you know everything , or remember it ? "
23312	23358	23309	23309	He	981	" The free pass to Rubes ' country lies in books , pretty one . Shall I give you some?—nay , lend them , I mean , since giving you are too wilful to hear of without offence . You can read , you said ? "
23370	23459	23364	23364	they	982	" I can read — not very fast , but that would come with doing it more and more , I think , just as spinning does ; one knots the thread and breaks it a million times before one learns to spin as fine as cobwebs . I have read the stories of St. Anne , and of St. Catherine , and of St. Luven fifty times , but they are all the books that Father Francis has ; and no one else has any among us . "
23460	23503	23504	23504	Bébée	101	" Very well . You shall have books of mine . Easy ones first , and then those that are more serious . But what time will you have ? You do so much ; you are like a little golden bee . "
23508	23595	23504	23504	Bébée	101	" Oh ! give me the books and I will find the time . It is light so early now . That gives one so many hours . In winter one has so few one must lie in bed , because to buy a candle you know one can not afford except , of course , a taper now and then , as one 's duty is , for our Lady or for the dead . And will you really , really , lend me books ? "
23596	23636	23364	23364	they	982	" Really , I will . Yes . I will bring you one to the Grande Place to - morrow , or meet you on your road there with it . Do you know what poetry is , Bébée ? "
23637	23640	23504	23504	Bébée	101	" No . "
23641	23649	23504	23504	Bébée	101	" But your flowers talk to you ? "
23650	23674	23364	23364	they	982	" Ah ! always . But then no one else hears them ever but me ; and so no one else ever believes . "
23675	23774	23504	23504	Bébée	101	" Well , poets are folks who hear the flowers talk as you do , and the trees , and the seas , and the beasts , and even the stones ; but no one else ever hears these things , and so , when the poets write them out , the rest of the world say , ' That is very fine , no doubt , but only good for dreamers ; it will bake no bread . ' I will give you some poetry ; for I think you care more about dreams than about bread . "
23775	23781	23783	23783	Bébée	101	" I do not know , "
23867	23875	23877	23877	he	984	" No . you do not know , "
24494	24532	24483	24483	Bébée	101	" I took a flower for you to - day , but it is dead . Look ; to - morrow , if you will be there , you shall have the best in all the garden . "
24533	24542	24543	24543	he	1000	" You wish to see me again then ? "
24568	24613	24547	24547	Bébée	101	" Yes ! you are not like anything I ever knew , and if you will only help me to learn a little . Sometimes I think I am not stupid , only ignorant ; but I can not be sure unless I try . "
24716	24726	24727	24727	he	1000	" I will go away and let her alone , "
24730	24849	24727	24727	he	1000	" Poor little soul ! it would give itself lavishly , it would never be bought . I will let it alone ; the mind will go to sleep and the body will keep healthy , and strong , and pure , as people call it . It would be a pity to play with both a day , and then throw them away as the boy threw the pear - blossom . She is a little clod of earth that has field flowers growing in it . I will let her alone , the flowers under the plough in due course will die , and she will be content among the other clods,—if I let her alone . "
24885	24892	24893	24893	he	1000	" You are late , Bébée , "
24909	24920	24893	24893	he	1000	" A good - looking lad ; who is it ? "
24925	24936	24937	24937	she	1007	" That is Jeannot , the son of old Sophie , "
24941	24999	24937	24937	she	1007	" He is so good — oh , so good , you can not think ; he keeps his mother and three little sisters , and works so very , very hard in the forest , and yet he often finds time to dig my garden for me , and he chops all my wood in winter . "
25125	25142	25118	25118	He	2154	" I must bid you good night , Bébée ; you are near your home now . "
25151	25161	25143	25143	She	1019	" But I shall see you to - morrow ? "
25430	25439	25440	25440	she	1019	" Shall I see you to - morrow ? "
25677	25683	25684	25684	he	2154	" Good night , Bébée , "
25689	25725	25684	25684	he	2154	" Tomorrow I will finish the Broodhuis and bring you your first book . Do not dream too much , or you will prick your lace patterns all awry . Good night , pretty one . "
25887	25907	25878	25878	they	1039	" Dear heart!—this is the eve of the Ascension , and the angels are so near we hear them . "
25963	25974	25975	25975	she	101	" He did not think when he struck them down , "
25982	25993	25995	25996	black Jeannot	144	" Can I do any work for you , Bébée ? "
26010	26033	26035	26035	she	101	" There is none to do , Jeannot . They want so little in this time of the year — the flowers , "
26134	26146	26147	26147	he	1031	" Who was that seigneur with you last night , Bébée ? "
26174	26212	26169	26169	they	1046	" I am not sure — I think he is a painter — a great painter prince , I mean — as Rubes was in Antwerpen ; he wanted roses the night before last in the cathedral . "
26213	26221	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" But he was walking with you ? "
26222	26237	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" He was in the lane as I came home last night — yes . "
26238	26248	26169	26169	they	1046	" What does he give you for your roses ? "
26249	26266	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" Oh ! he pays me well . How is your mother this day , Jeannot ? "
26267	26277	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" You do not like to talk of him ? "
26278	26294	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" Why should you want to talk of him ? He is nothing to you . "
26295	26308	26161	26161	Bébée	101	" Did you really see him only two days ago , Bébée ? "
26309	26333	26334	26335	The forester	1047	" Oh , Jeannot ! did I ever tell a falsehood ? You would not say that to one of your little sisters . "
26449	26460	26461	26461	she	101	" You will be late in the forest , Jeannot , "
26466	26495	26461	26461	she	101	" It is such a long , long way in and out . Why do you look so sulky ? and you are kicking the wicket to pieces . "
26496	26507	26509	26509	Jeannot	144	" I do not like you to talk with strangers , "
26564	26610	26515	26515	Bébée	101	" Oh , Jeannot , what nonsense ! As if I do not talk to a million strangers every summer ! as if I could ever sell a flower if I did not ! You are cross this morning ; that is what it is . "
26611	26620	26622	26622	Jeannot	144	" Do you know the man 's name ? "
26652	26683	26640	26640	She	101	" No ! and what would his name be to us , if I did know it ? I can not ask people 's names because they buy my roses . "
26684	26692	26640	26640	She	101	" As if it were only roses ! "
26758	26771	26772	26772	she	101	" You are cross , Jeannot , that is what it is , "
26779	26834	26772	26772	she	101	" You should not be cross ; you are too big and strong and good . Go in and get my bowl of bread and milk for me , and hand it to me up here . It is so pleasant . It is as nice as being perched on an apple - tree . "
26904	26913	26914	26914	he	144	" You will be seeing that stranger again ? "
26918	26921	26922	26922	she	101	" Yes ! "
26942	27021	27022	27022	Bébée	101	" You ought to go , Jeannot , now ; you are so late . I will come and see your mother to - morrow . And do not be cross , you dear big Jeannot . Days are too short to snip them up into little bits by bad temper ; it is only a stupid sheep - shearer that spoils the fleece by snapping at it sharp and hard ; that is what Father Francis says . "
27110	27130	27131	27131	he	144	" You will only think of that stranger , Bébée , never of any of us — never again , "
27354	27360	27361	27361	she	101	" Ah , dear Sun ! "
27366	27435	27361	27361	she	101	" I am going to be wise . I am going into great Rubes ' country . I am going to hear of the Past and the Future . I am going to listen to what the Poets say . The swallows never would tell me anything ; but now I shall know as much as they know . Are you not glad for me , O Sun ? "
27461	27527	27455	27455	he	157	" The only time when a human soul is either wise or happy is in that one single moment when the hour of my own shining or of the moon 's beaming seems to that single soul to be past and present and future , to be at once the creation and the end of all things . Faust knew that ; so will you . "
27883	27888	27880	27880	they	504	" God keep you . "
27892	27902	27903	27903	she	1073	" He told me I was like a flower , "
27991	28014	28015	28015	she	1073	" Dear and holy Mother of Jesus , I do thank you that you made me a little good to look at , "
28020	28090	28015	28015	she	1073	" Keep me as you keep the flowers , and let my face be always fair , because it is a pleasure to be a pleasure . Ah , dear Mother , I say it so badly , and it sounds so vain , I know . But I do not think you will be angry , will you ? And I am going to try to be wise . "
28172	28184	28185	28185	she	1073	" I wonder what he meant by a dog 's heart ? "
28257	28265	28267	28267	Bébée	101	" What is the dog 's heart ? "
28349	28361	28362	28362	she	1073	" Was her sailor , indeed , so good to her ? "
28406	28417	28418	28418	she	1073	" Eh , no ; not that I ever saw , "
28423	28496	28418	28418	she	1073	" He was fond of her — very fond ; but he was a wilful one , and he beat her sometimes when he got tired of being on land . But women must not mind that , you know , my dear , if only a man 's heart is right . Things fret them , and then they belabor what they love best ; it is a way they have . "
28497	28509	28511	28511	Bébée	101	" But she speaks of him as of an angel nearly ! "
28532	28577	28515	28517	The old woman	627	" Ay , dear ; when the frost kills your brave rose - bush , root and bud , do you think of the thorns that pricked you , or only of the fair , sweet - smelling things that flowered all your summer ? "
29152	29165	29166	29166	he	1098	" She is only a peasant ; she is not a poem , "
29171	29184	29166	29166	he	1098	" I will paint a Gretchen for the Salon of next year . "
29563	29569	29570	29570	he	1119	" There is my Gretchen , "
29617	29643	29614	29614	he	1119	" It is the face of Gretchen , but not the soul — the Red Mouse has never passed this child 's lips . Nevertheless — "
29644	29647	29648	29648	he	1119	" Nevertheless — "
29748	29751	29742	29742	he	1119	" Nevertheless . "
29752	29753	29754	29754	he	1119	" Nevertheless,"—for
29928	29935	29936	29936	she	598	" Might I know your name ? "
29959	29965	29936	29936	she	598	" They call me Flamen . "
29966	29972	30037	30037	her	101	" It is your name ? "
29973	29998	30037	30037	her	101	" Yes , for the world . You must call me Victor , as other women do . Why do you want my name ? "
29999	30006	30037	30037	her	101	" Jeannot asked it of me . "
30007	30017	30037	30037	her	101	" Oh , Jeannot asked it , did he ? "
30018	30023	30025	30025	Bébée	101	" Yes ; besides , "
30040	30106	30037	30037	her	101	hushed,—"besides , I want to pray for you of course , every day ; and if I do not know your name , how can I make Our Lady rightly understand ? The flowers know you without a name , but she might not , because so very many are always beseeching her , and you see she has all the world to look after . "
30186	30199	30200	30200	she	101	" I am going to learn to be very wise , dear , "
30204	30216	30200	30200	she	101	" I shall not have time to dance or to play . "
30217	30230	30232	30232	Franz	178	" But people are not merry when they are wise , Bébée , "
30238	30242	30244	30244	Bébée	101	" Perhaps not , "
30246	30259	30244	30244	Bébée	101	" but one can not be everything , you know , Franz . "
30260	30273	30200	30200	she	101	" But surely , you would rather be merry than anything else ? "
30274	30303	30244	30244	Bébée	101	" I think there is something better , Franz . I am not sure ; I want to find out ; I will tell you when I know . "
30304	30315	30244	30244	Bébée	101	" Who has put that into your head , Bébée ? "
30316	30323	30324	30324	she	101	" The angels in the cathedral , "
30359	30370	30372	30372	Franz	178	" But for all that the angels have said it , "
30377	30408	30372	30372	Franz	178	" I can not see what good it will be to her to be wise , if she will not care any longer afterwards for almond gingerbread and currant cake . "
30415	30419	30421	30421	he	1151	" Paul and Virginia "
30722	30746	30751	30751	she	101	" What are you doing , Bébée , there , this time of the night ? It is on the strike of twelve . "
30784	30793	30797	30797	he	144	" What are you doing up so late ? "
30866	30890	30849	30849	Bébée	101	" I was reading — and , Jeannot , his name is Flamen for the world , but I may call him Victor . "
30891	30900	30959	30959	he	1164	" What do I care for his name ? "
30901	30908	30959	30959	he	1164	" You asked it this morning . "
30909	30929	30930	30930	Bébée	101	" More fool I. Why do you read ? Reading is not for poor folk like you and me . "
30962	30969	30971	30971	Jeannot	144	" You are a little peasant , "
30981	31061	30975	30975	he	144	" It is all you can do to get your bread . You have no one to stand between you and hunger . How will it be with you when the slug gets your roses , and the snail your carnations , and your hens die of damp , and your lace is all wove awry , because your head runs on reading and folly , and you are spoilt for all simple pleasures and for all honest work ? "
31080	31091	31062	31062	She	101	" You are cross , dear Jeannot . Good night . "
31163	31199	31200	31200	She	101	" Bébée — Bébée — just listen . I spoke roughly , dear — I know I have no right . I am sorry . Will you be friends with me again?—do be friends again . "
31218	31241	31213	31213	her	101	" we are friends — we will always be friends , of course — only you do not know . Good night . "
31342	31452	31330	31330	she	101	" Oh , dear Holy Mother , you have so much to think of — yes . I know — all the poor , and all the little children . But take care of him ; he is called Flamen , and he lives in the street of Mary of Burgundy ; you can not miss him ; and if you will look for him always , and have a heed that the angels never leave him , I will give you my great cactus glower — my only one — on your Feast of Roses this very year . Oh , dear Mother , you will not forget ! "
31593	31603	31620	31620	she	181	" What do you want with books , Bébée ? "
31627	31652	31620	31620	she	181	" Franz told me you were reading last night . It is the silver buckles have done that : one mischief always begets another . "
31653	31662	31664	31664	Bébée	101	" Where is the mischief , good Reine ? "
31688	31696	31698	31703	the sabot - maker 's wife	1173	" The mischief will be in discontent , "
31705	31815	31698	31703	the sabot - maker 's wife	1173	" People live on their own little patch , and think it is the world ; that is as it should be — everybody within his own , like a nut in its shell . But when you get reading , you hear of a swarm of things you never saw , and you fret because you can not see them , and you dream , and dream , and a hole is burnt in your soup - pot , and your dough is as heavy as lead . You are like bees that leave their own clover fields to buzz themselves dead against the glass of a hothouse . "
31831	31840	31841	31841	she	101	" What good is it talking to them ? "
31844	31850	31841	31841	she	101	" they do not know . "
31889	31899	31901	31901	Reine	181	" Antoine should never have taught you your letters , "
31918	32011	31901	31901	Reine	181	" I told him so at the time . I said , ' The child is a good child , and spins , and sews , and sweeps , rare and fine for her age ; why go and spoil her ? ' But he was always headstrong . Not a child of mine knows a letter , the saints be praised ! nor a word of any tongue but our own good Flemish . You should have been brought up the same . You would have come to no trouble then . "
32012	32022	32024	32024	Bébée	101	" I am in no trouble , dear Reine , "
32056	32060	32062	32062	Reine	181	" Not yet , "
32187	32195	32196	32196	she	181	" He is sure to be there , "
32329	32339	32340	32340	she	101	" Perhaps he is gore out of the city , "
32519	32554	32555	32555	she	101	" It is natural , of course — he has his world — he does not think often of me — there is no reason why he should be as good as he is , "
33044	33077	33037	33037	she	101	" I saw beautiful rich women , and I envied them ; and I could not pray to Mary last night for thinking of them , for I hated them so much . "
33085	33095	33079	33079	she	101	" I hated them because they were with him . "
33109	33120	33122	33125	the good old man	1215	" That is not like you at all , Bébée , "
33160	33207	33122	33125	the good old man	1215	" My dear , you never were covetous at all , nor did you ever seem to care for the things of the world . I wish Jehan had not given you those silver buckles ; I think they have set your little soul on vanities . "
33208	33220	33222	33222	Bébée	101	" It is not the buckles ; I am not covetous , "
34285	34295	34297	34299	the fruit girl	1256	" She is such a little close sly thing ! "
34317	34329	34330	34330	Bébée	101	" We dance almost every evening , the children and I , "
34352	34395	34330	34330	Bébée	101	" That does just as well . And I have seen Kermesse once at Malines — it was beautiful . I went with Mère Dax , but it cost a great deal I know , though she did not let me pay . "
34396	34401	34402	34404	the fruit girl	1256	" You little fool ! "
34448	34458	34460	34460	they	1260	" Leave the child alone , you mischievous one , "
34462	34553	34460	34460	they	1260	" Be content with being base yourself . Look you , Lisette ; she is not one like you to make eyes at the law students , and pester the painter lads for a day 's outing . Let her be , or we will tell your mother how you leave the fruit for the gutter children to pick and thieve , while you are stealing up the stairs into that young French fellow 's chamber . Oh , oh ! a fine beating you will get when she knows ! "
34616	34628	34629	34629	she	1269	" What should I want her to come with us for ? "
34634	34654	34632	34632	herself	1269	" She is twice as pretty as I am ; Jules might take to her instead — who knows ? "
34682	34691	34692	34692	she	1269	" Oh , oh , you dainty one ! "
34699	34822	34692	34692	she	1269	" So you would not take the nuts and mulberries that do for us common folk , because you had a mind for a fine pine out of the hothouses ! That was all , was it ? Eh , well ; I do not begrudge you . Only take care ; remember , the nuts and mulberries last through summer and autumn , and there are heaps of them on every fair - stall and street corner ; but the pine , that is eaten in a day , one springtime , and its like does not grow in the hedges . You will have your mouth full of sugar an hour,—and then , eh!—you will go famished all the year . "
34823	34829	34831	34831	Bébée	101	" I do not understand , "
34851	34863	34865	34865	Lisette	120	" Oh , pretty little fool ! you understand well enough , "
34876	34890	34870	34870	she	120	" Does he give you fine things ? You might let me see . "
34891	34898	34692	34692	she	1269	" No one gives me anything . "
34899	34984	34870	34870	she	120	" Chut ! you want me to believe that . Why Jules is only a lad , and his father is a silk mercer , and only gives him a hundred francs a month , but Jules buys me all I want — somehow — or do you think I would take the trouble to set my cap straight when he goes by ? He gave me these ear - rings , look . I wish you would let me see what you get . "
35442	35451	35452	35452	they	504	" What does he pay you , Bébée ? "
35467	35470	35452	35452	they	504	" Nothing , "
35491	35555	35484	35484	they	504	" Careless little fool ; you should make enough to buy you wood all winter . When the man from Ghent painted Trine and her cow , he gave her a whole gold bit for standing still so long in the clover . The Krebs would be sure to lend you her cow , if it be the cow that makes the difference . "
35975	35994	35996	35997	her enemy	1300	" Hoot , toot , pretty innocent , so you are no better than the rest of us , "
36020	36100	36101	36101	Bébée	101	" Prut ! so it was no such purity after all that made you never look at the student lads and the soldiers , eh ? You were so dainty of taste , you must needs pick and choose , and , Lord 's sake , after all your coyness , to drop at a beckoning finger as one may say — pong!—in a minute , like an apple over - ripe ! Oh hé , you sly one ! "
36147	36174	36128	36128	Bébée	101	" What did she mean ? I do not understand . I must have done some wrong — or she thinks so . Do you know ? "
36184	36228	36175	36175	Flamen	176	" You have done her the wrong of a fair skin when hers is brown , and a little foot while hers is as big as a trooper 's ; there is no greater sin , Bébée , possible in woman to woman . "
36229	36238	36239	36239	he	176	" Hold your peace , you shrill jade , "
36269	36292	36239	36239	he	176	" Do not heed her , Bébée . She is a coarse - tongued brute , and is jealous , no doubt . "
36293	36297	36336	36336	he	176	" Jealous?—of what ? "
36306	36322	36304	36304	Bébée	101	" That I am not a student or a soldier , as her lovers are . "
36566	36601	36602	36602	Bébée	101	stillness,—"Good day , pretty one ! you are as early as the lark , Bébée . I go to Mayence , so I thought I would look at you one moment as I pass . "
36730	36740	36741	36741	he	176	" Will you give me a draught of water ? "
36750	36757	36759	36759	Bébée	101	" I will give you breakfast , "
36972	36980	36982	36982	Bébée	101	" I will give you your breakfast , "
37000	37009	37010	37010	she	101	" I have very little , you know , "
37015	37049	37010	37010	she	101	" Only goat 's milk and bread ; but if that will do — and there is some honey — and if you would eat a salad , I would cut one fresh . "
37311	37316	37331	37331	she	101	" Bonjour ! Bonjour ! "
37317	37330	37331	37331	she	101	" You are tired , I am sure you must be tired , "
37501	37520	37528	37528	her	101	" I can not do much , but what I do , I do with all my heart . "
37807	37817	37818	37818	she	101	" All the people are gone on a pilgrimage , "
37836	38023	37818	37818	she	101	" They are gone to pray for a fine harvest , and that she wants herself as well — it costs seven francs apiece . They take their food with them ; they go and laugh and eat in the fields . I think it is nonsense . One can say one 's prayers just as well here . Mère Krebs thinks so too , but then she says , ' If I do not go , it will look ill ; people will say I am irreligious ; and as we make so much by flour , God would think it odd for me to be absent ; and , besides , it is only seven francs there and back ; and if it does please Heaven , that is cheap , you know . One will get it over and over again in Paradise . ' That is what Mere Krebs says . But , for me , I think it is nonsense . It can not please God to go by train and eat galette and waste a whole day in getting dusty . "
38107	38108	38103	38103	you	1360	" "
38127	38128	38118	38119	the Virgin	386	" "
38249	38250	38240	38240	Antoine	103	" "
38261	38275	38251	38251	You	1369	" said Flamen , who was more moved than he cared to feel . "
38292	38293	38294	38295	No one	1950	" "
38316	38317	38311	38311	you	1369	" "
38336	38337	38329	38329	they	1372	" "
38483	38484	38467	38467	she	386	" "
38504	38607	38497	38497	you	1369	" He rose as he spoke , and went across the floor and drew away her hand that was parting the flax , and took it in his own and stroked it , indulgently and carelessly , as a man may stroke the soft fur of a young cat . Leaning against the little lattice and looking down on her with musing eyes , half smiling , half serious , half amorous , half sad , Bébée looked up with a sudden and delicious terror that ran through her as the charm of the snake 's gaze runs through the bewildered bird . "
38620	38923	38924	38924	You	1378	" he asked again . Bébée 's face grew pale and troubled . She left her hand in his because she did not think any shame of his taking it . But the question suddenly flung the perplexity and darkness of doubt into the clearness of her pure child 's conscience . All her ways had been straight and sunlit before her . She had never had a divided duty . The religion and the pleasure of her simple little life had always gone hand - in - hand , greeting one another , and never for an instant in conflict . In any hesitation of her own she had always gone to Father Francis , and he had disentangled the web for her and made all plain . But here was a difficulty in which she could never go to Father Francis . Right and wrong , duty and desire , were for the first time arrayed before her in their ghastly and unending warfare . It frightened her with a certain breathless sense of peril — the peril of a time when in lieu of that gentle Mother of Roses whom she kneeled to among the flowers , she would only see a dusky shadow looming between her and the beauty of life and the light of the sun . What he said was quite vague to her . She attached no definite danger to his words . She only thought — to see him was so great a joy — if Mary forbade it , would she not take it if she could notwithstanding , always , always , always ? He kept her hand in his , and watched with contentment the changing play of the shade and sorrow , the fear and fascination , on her face . "
38931	38949	38929	38929	Bébée	101	" he said at length , knowing well himself ; so much better than ever she knew . "
39012	39084	38999	38999	You	2076	" The child was cut to the heart by the sadness and humility of words of whose studied artifice she had no suspicion . She thought that she seemed to him ungrateful and selfish , and yet all the mooring - ropes that held her little boat of life to the harbor of its simple religion seemed cut away , and she seemed drifting helpless and rudderless upon an unknown sea . "
39095	39114	39092	39092	I	0	" she said , timidly , and lifted her eyes to his with an unconscious appeal in them . "
39168	39169	39170	39171	Our Lady?—oh	1386	" "
39191	39203	39177	39177	her	275	" he thought to himself : but he only answered , — "
39238	39295	39296	39296	I	0	" He knew quite well , but it amused him to see the perplexed trouble that this , the first divided duty of her short years , brought with it . Bébée looked at him , and loosened her hand from his , and sat quite still . Her lips had a little quiver in them . "
39299	39305	39306	39306	I	0	" she said at last , "
39407	39608	39609	39609	I	0	" He had driven her into the subtleties of doubt , but the honest little soul in her found a way out , as a flower in a cellar finds its way through the stones to light . He plucked the ivy leaves and threw them at the chickens on the bricks without , with a certain impatience in the action . The simplicity and the directness of the answer disarmed him ; he was almost ashamed to use against her the weapons of his habitual warfare . It was like a maître d'armes fencing with bare steel against a little naked child armed with a blest palm - sheaf . When she had thus brought him all she had , and he to please her had sat down to the simple food , she gathered a spray of roses and set it in a pot beside him , then left him and went and stood at a little distance , waiting , with her hands lightly crossed on her chest , to see if there were anything that he might want . He ate and drank well to please her , looking at her often as he did so . "
39616	39627	39609	39609	I	0	" he said , with a tone that seemed strange to her,—"I
39640	39641	39632	39632	I	0	" "
39646	39647	39648	39648	I	0	" "

39688	39701	39682	39682	you	0	" He was silent , and looked at the spray of roses . "
39707	39712	39713	39713	I	0	" he said impatiently . "
39759	39760	39754	39754	you	1392	" "
39771	39864	39766	39766	I	0	" she said , ashamed lest she should have seemed rude to him ; and she drew out her wheel under the light of the lattice , and sat down to it , and began to disentangle the threads . It was a pretty picture — the low , square casement ; the frame of ivy , the pink and white of the climbing sweet - peas : the girl 's head ; the cool , wet leaves : the old wooden spinning - wheel , that purred like a sleepy cat . "
39880	39884	39871	39871	Gretchen	161	" he said . "
39889	39890	39887	39887	Gretchen	161	" "

40088	40123	40081	40081	Bébée	101	" Bébée looked across the hut and smiled , and broke her thread . She did not know what he meant , but if she were anything that pleased him , it was well . "
40130	40142	40143	40144	What women	1401	" she said suddenly , the color mounting into her cheeks . "
40149	40150	40143	40144	What women	1401	" "
40168	40169	40164	40164	they	1400	" "
40203	40204	40205	40205	You	1392	" "

40238	40276	40219	40219	they	1400	" She stopped her spinning and gazed at him with wistful , wondering eyes . Could it be that they were not beautiful to him ? those deep red , glowing , sun - basked dahlia flowers ? "
40281	40297	40219	40219	they	1400	" she said very softly , with a flush of penitence that came and went , "
40362	40363	40359	40359	you	1392	" "
40369	40370	40371	40371	They	1400	" "
40382	40399	40371	40371	They	1400	" said Bébée , thoughtfully , looking across at him in deprecation of his possible anger . "
40432	40433	40434	40434	You	1392	" "
40442	40443	40440	40440	Bébée	101	" "

40685	40693	40706	40706	you	1392	" Bébée watched him with wistful eyes . "
40855	40966	40842	40842	she	131	" She spoke quite quietly and simply , spinning as she spoke , and looking across at him with earnest eyes , that begged him to believe her . She was saying the pure truth , but she did not know the force or the meaning of that truth . He listened with a smile ; it was not new to him ; he knew her heart much better than she knew it herself , but there was an unconsciousness , and yet a strength , in the words that touched him though . He threw the leaves away , irritably , and told her to leave off her spinning . "
40989	40990	40983	40983	you	1415	" "
40993	41022	40983	40983	you	1415	" She answered him as she would have answered if he had told her to go on pilgrimage from one end of the Low Countries to the other . "

41429	41477	41411	41411	she	161	" Her face was scarlet as she glanced at her feet ; he who had wanted to give her the silk stockings — how would he like to be seen walking abroad with those two clumsy , clattering , work - a - day , little sabots ? "
41587	41588	41584	41584	I.	0	" "

41740	41741	41746	41746	my	0	" "
41750	41887	41746	41746	my	0	" Was it possible ? Bébée thought , as she ran out into the garden and locked the door behind her , and pushed the key under the waterbutt as usual , being quite content with that prudent precaution against robbers which had served Antoine all his days . Was it possible , this wonderful joy?—her cheeks were like her roses , her eyes had a brilliance like the sun ; the natural grace and mirth of the child blossomed in a thousand ways and gestures . As she went by the shrine in the wall , she bent her knee a moment and made the sign of the cross ; then she gathered a little moss - rose that nodded close under the border of the palisade , and turned and gave it to him . "
41919	41930	41910	41910	she	1440	" He shrank a little as her fingers touched him . "
41941	42235	41939	41939	Bébée	101	" he said , on an impulse of emotion , of which in Paris he would have been more ashamed than of any guilt . In the deserted lane by the swans ' water , under the willows , the horses waited to take him to Mechlin ; little , quick , rough horses , with round brass bells , in the Flemish fashion , and gay harness , and a low char - à - banc , in which a wolf - skin and red rugs , and all a painter 's many necessities , were tossed together . He lifted her in , and the little horses flew fast through the green country , ringing chimes at each step , till they plunged into the deep glades of the woods of Cambre and Soignies . Bébée sat breathless with delight . She had never gone behind horses in all her life , except once or twice in a wagon when the tired teamsters had dragged a load of corn across the plains , or when the miller 's old gray mare had hobbled wearily before a cart - load of noisy , happy , mischievous children going home from the masses and fairs , and flags , and flowers , and church banners , and puppet - shows , and lighted altars , and whirling merry - go - rounds of the Fête Dieu . She had never known what it was to sail as on the wings of the wind along broad roads , with yellow wheat - lands , and green hedges , and wayside trees , and little villages , and reedy canal water , all flying by her to the sing - song of the joyous bells . "
42245	42278	41939	41939	Bébée	101	" she cried , clapping her hands in a very ecstasy , as the clear morning broadened into gold and the west wind rose and blew from the sands by the sea . "
42293	43355	41939	41939	Bébée	101	" said he , watching her with a listless pleasure . But she did not hear ; she was beyond the reach of any power to sadden her ; she was watching the white oxen that stood on the purple brow of the just reapen lands , and the rosy clouds that blew like a shower of apple - blossoms across the sky to the south . There was a sad darkling Calvary on the edge of the harvest - field that looked black against the blue sky ; its shadow fell across the road , but she did not see it : she was looking at the sun . There is not much change in the great Soignies woods . They are aisles on aisles of beautiful green trees , crossing and recrossing ; tunnels of dark foliage that look endless ; long avenues of beech , of oak , of elm , or of fir , with the bracken and the brushwood growing dense between ; a delicious forest growth everywhere , shady even at noon , and by a little past midday dusky as evening ; with the forest fragrance , sweet and dewy , all about , and under the fern the stirring of wild game , and the white gleam of little rabbits , and the sound of the wings of birds . Soignies is not legend - haunted like the Black Forest , nor king - haunted like Fontainebleau , nor sovereign of two historic streams like the brave woods of Heidelberg ; nor wild and romantic , arid broken with black rocks , and poetized by the shade of Jaques , and swept through by a perfect river , like its neighbors of Ardennes ; nor throned aloft on mighty mountains like the majestic oak glades of the Swabian hills of the ivory carvers . Soignies is only a Flemish forest in a plain , throwing its shadows over corn - fields and cattle pastures , with no panorama beyond it and no wonders in its depth . But it is a fresh , bold , beautiful forest for all that . It has only green leaves to give,—green leaves always , league after league ; but there is about it that vague mystery which all forests have , and this universe of leaves seems boundless , and Pan might dwell in it , and St. Hubert , and John Keats . Bébée , in her rare holidays with the Bac children or with Jeannot 's sisters , had never penetrated farther than the glades of the Cambre , and had never entered the heart of the true forest , which is much still what it must have been in the old days when the burghers of Brabant cut their yew bows and their pike staves from it to use against the hosts of Spain . To Bébée it was as an enchanted land , and every play of light and shade , every hare speeding across the paths , every thrush singing in the leaves , every little dog - rose or harebell that blossomed in the thickets , was to her a treasure , a picture , a poem , a delight . He had seen girls thus in the woods of Vincennes and of Versailles in the student days of his youth : little work - girls fresh from châlets of the Jura or from vine - hung huts of the Loire , who had brought their poor little charms to perish in Paris ; and who dwelt under the hot tiles and amidst the gilded shop signs till they were as pale and thin as their own starved balsams ; and who , when they saw the green woods , laughed and cried a little , and thought of the broad sun - swept fields , and wished that they were back again behind their drove of cows , or weeding among the green grapes . But those little work - girls had been mere homely daisies , and daisies already with the dust of the pavement and of the dancing - gardens upon them . Bébée was as pure and fresh as these dew - wet dog - roses that she found in the thickets of thorn . He had meant to treat her as he had used to do those work - girls — a little wine , a little wooing , a little folly and passion , idle as a butterfly and brief as a rainbow — one midsummer day and night — then a handful of gold , a caress , a good - morrow , and forgetfulness ever afterwards — that was what he had meant when he had brought her out to the forest of Soignies . But — she was different , this child . He made the great sketch of her for his Gretchen , sitting on a moss - grown trunk , with marguerites in her hand ; he sent for their breakfast far into the woods , and saw her set her pearly teeth into early peaches and costly sweetmeats ; he wandered with her hither and thither , and told her tales out of the poets and talked to her in the dreamy , cynical , poetical manner that was characteristic of him , being half artificial and half sorrowful , as his temper was . But Bébée , all unconscious , intoxicated with happiness , and yet touched by it into that vague sadness which the summer sun brings with it even to young things , if they have soul in them,—Bébée said to him what the work - girls of Paris never had done . Beautiful things : things fantastic , ignorant , absurd , very simple , very unreasonable oftentimes , but things beautiful always , and sometimes even very wise by a wisdom not of the world ; by a certain light divine that does shine now and then as through an alabaster lamp , through minds that have no grossness to obscure them . Her words were not equal to the burden of her thoughts at times , but he knew how to take the pearl of the thought from the broken shell and tangled sea - weed of her simple , untutored speech . "
43363	43369	41939	41939	Bébée	101	" he thought to himself , "
43378	43419	43370	43372	this little Fleming	1444	" She was so near that , although he had no belief in any God , he could not deal with her as he had used to do with the work - girls in the primrose paths of old Vincennes . "
43433	43661	43424	43424	you	161	" he said to her , as he painted,—painted her just as she was , with her two little white feet in the wooden shoes , and the thick green leaves behind ; the simplest picture possible , the dress of gray — only cool dark gray — with white linen bodice , and no color anywhere except in the green of the foliage ; but where he meant the wonder and the charm of it to lie was in the upraised , serious , child - like face , and the gaze of the grave , smiling eyes . It was Gretchen , spinning , out in the open air among the flowers . Gretchen , with the tall dog - daisies growing up about her feet , among the thyme and the roses , before she had had need to gather , one to ask her future of its parted leaves . The Gretchen of Scheffer tells no tale ; she is a fair - haired , hard - working , simple - minded peasant , with whom neither angels nor devils have anything to do , and whose eyes never can open to either hell or heaven . But the Gretchen of Flamen said much more than this : looking at it , men would sigh from shame , and women weep from sorrow . "
43666	43670	43424	43424	you	161	" echoed Bébée . "
43712	43728	43694	43695	the girls	1445	" She looked at him without any consciousness , except as she loved the flowers . "
43736	43750	43730	43730	you	0	" she went on , seriously , parting their petals with her fingers . "
43761	43762	43751	43751	Flowers	141	" "
43768	43769	43751	43751	Flowers	141	" "
43774	43775	43771	43771	them	141	" "
43785	43786	43771	43771	them	141	" "

43861	43862	43878	43878	they	1453	" "

43910	43911	43906	43906	You	0	" "
43923	44043	44044	44044	They	1453	" She said it softly , musingly , with no embarrassment ; it was an unreal , remote thing to her , and yet it stirred her heart a little with a vague trouble that was infinitely sweet . There is little talk of love in the lives of the poor ; they have no space for it ; love to them means more mouths to feed , more wooden shoes to buy , more hands to dive into the meagre bag of coppers . Now and then a girl of the commune had been married , and had ploughing in the fields or to her lace - weaving in the city . Bébée had thought little of it . "
44059	44067	44068	44068	Bébée	101	" said Flamen , with a smile . "
44111	44112	44101	44101	Gretchen	161	" "
44122	44123	44116	44117	the daisies	1456	" "
44182	44183	44145	44146	The daisies	1456	" "
44194	44195	44198	44199	the devil	1464	" "
44215	44292	44205	44205	He	1464	" But Bébée did not smile ; she had a look of horror in her blue eyes ; she belonged to a peasantry who believed in exorcising the fiend by the aid of the cross , and who not so very many generations before had driven him out of human bodies by rack and flame . She looked with a little wistful fear on the white , golden - eyed marguerites that lay on her lap . "
44302	44315	44294	44294	you	0	" she whispered , with awe in her voice . Flamen smiled . "
44328	44339	44320	44320	he	2448	" Bébée threw them with a shudder on the grass . "
44348	44383	44341	44341	I	0	" he said , with a certain self - reproach . She was silent a minute , then she gathered up the daisies again , and stroked them and put them to her lips . "
44455	44456	44447	44448	the fiend	2448	" "
44465	44466	44461	44463	Poor little Bébée	101	" "
44475	44476	44469	44469	you	1269	" "
44525	44526	44521	44523	poor little Bébée	1474	" "
44539	44590	44533	44533	you	1269	" He rose and left his easel and threw himself at her feet on the grass ; he took the little wooden shoes in his hands as reverently as he would have taken the broidered shoes of a duchess ; he looked up at her with tender , smiling eyes . "
44595	44600	44591	44593	Poor little Bébée	101	" he said again . "
44673	44687	44654	44654	Bébée	101	" She smiled , and the happy laughter came again over her face . "
44700	44706	44693	44693	you	0	" she said , softly , "
44745	44746	44739	44739	yourself	0	" "
44750	45121	44739	44739	yourself	0	" he answered her dreamily , and lay there in the grass , holding the little wooden shoes in his hands . He was not in love with her . He was in no haste . He preferred to play with her softly , slowly , as one separates the leaves of a rose , to see the deep rose of its heart . Her own ignorance of what she felt had a charm for him . He liked to lift the veil from her eyes by gentle degrees , watching each new pulse - beat , each fresh instinct tremble into life . It was an old , old story to him ; he knew each chapter and verse to weariness , though there still was no other story that he still read as often . But to her it was so new . To him it was a long beaten track ; he knew every turn of it ; he recognized every wayside blossom ; he had passed over a thousand times each tremulous bridge ; he knew so well beforehand where each shadow would fall , and where each fresh bud would blossom , and where each harvest would be reaped . But to her it was so new . She followed him as a blind child a man that guides her through a garden and reads her a wonder tale . He was good to her , that was all she knew . When he touched her ever so lightly she felt a happiness so perfect , and yet so unintelligible , that she could have wished to die in it . And in her humility and her ignorance she wondered always how he — so great , so wise , so beautiful — could have thought it ever worth his while to leave the paradise of Rubes ' land to wait with her under her little rush - thatched roof , and bring her here to see the green leaves and the living things of the forest . As they went , a man was going under the trees with a load of wood upon his back . Bébée gave a little cry of recognition . "
45139	45157	45131	45131	he	1479	" Flamen drew her a little downward , so that the forester passed onward without perceiving them . "
45164	45168	45131	45131	he	1479	" said Bébée . "
45176	45177	45170	45170	I	0	" "
45199	45200	45131	45131	he	1479	" "
45210	45235	45204	45204	I	0	" said Bébée . whose imagination had been already busy with the wonders that she would unfold to Mère Krebs and the Varnhart children . "
45267	45268	45264	45264	her	217	" "
45272	45326	45264	45264	her	217	" She did not speak for some time . She could not imagine a state of things in which she would not narrate the little daily miracles of her life to the good old garrulous women and the little open - mouthed romps . And yet — she lifted her eyes to his . "
45336	45340	45330	45330	you	0	" she said . "
45445	45446	45449	45449	I	0	" "
45470	45502	45503	45503	I	0	" Bébée 's eyes glanced down through the green aisle of the forests , with the musing seriousness in them that was like the child - angels of Botticelli 's dreams . "
45574	45575	45560	45560	I	0	" "
45579	45580	45560	45560	I	0	" "
45631	45843	45862	45864	the Varnhart children	2025	" He looked at her , and took , her hands and kissed them — but reverently — as a believer may kiss a shrine . In that moment to Flamen she was sacred ; in that moment he could no more have hurt her with passion than he could have hurt her with a blow . It was an emotion with him , and did not endure . But whilst it lasted , it was true . Then he took her to dine at one of the wooden cafés under the trees . There was a little sheet of water in front of it and a gay garden around . There was a balcony and a wooden stairway ; there were long trellised arbors , and little white tables , and great rosebushes like her own at home . They had an arbor all to themselves ; a cool sweet - smelling bower of green , with a glimpse of scarlet from the flowers of some twisting beans . They had a meal , the like of which she had never seen ; such a huge melon in the centre of it , and curious wines , and coffee or cream in silver pots , or what looked like silver to her—"just
45853	45859	45862	45864	the Varnhart children	2025	" she said to herself . "
45868	46056	45862	45864	the Varnhart children	2025	" she cried ; but he did not echo the wish . It was just sunset . There was a golden glow on the little bit of water . On the other side of the garden some one was playing a guitar . Under a lime - tree some girls were swinging , crying , Higher ! higher ! at each toss . In a longer avenue of trellised green , at a long table , there was a noisy party of students and girls of the city ; their laughter was mellowed by distance as it came over the breadth of the garden , and they sang , with fresh shrill Flemish voices , songs from an opera bouffe of La Monnaie . It was all pretty , and gay , and pleasant . There was everywhere about an air of light - hearted enjoyment . Bébée sat with a wondering look in her wide - opened eyes , and all the natural instincts of her youth , that were like curled - up fruit buds in her , unclosed softly to the light of joy . "
46068	46099	45862	45864	the Varnhart children	2025	" she asked him ; that vague far - away country of which she never asked him anything more definite , and which yet was so clear before her fancy . "
46102	46109	45862	45864	the Varnhart children	2025	" he made answer to her . "
46235	46357	46358	46358	I	0	" Bébée listened , leaning her round elbows on the table , and her warm cheeks on her hands , as a child gravely listens to a fairy story . But the sumptuous picture , and the sensuous phrase he had chosen , passed by her . It is of no use to tempt the little chaffinch of the woods with a ruby instead of a cherry . The bird is made to feed on the brown berries , on the morning dews , on the scarlet hips of roses , and the blossoms of the wind - tossed pear boughs ; the gem , though it be a monarch 's , will only strike hard and tasteless on its beak . "
46366	46378	46358	46358	I	0	" said Bébée , musingly trying to follow out her thoughts . "
46571	46572	46573	46573	You	1506	" "
46591	46622	46585	46585	you	1506	" he answered her , and felt a tinge of shame that he had tempted her with the gold and purple of a baser world than any that she knew . "
46632	46636	46625	46625	you	1506	" he pursued . "
46646	46647	46625	46625	you	1506	" "
46656	46668	46625	46625	you	1506	" cried Bébée , still leaning her cheeks on her hands . "
46933	46970	46931	46931	I	0	" Her voice faltered a little and stopped : she had never before thought out into words her own loneliness ; from the long green arbor the voices of the girls and the students sang , — "
46980	47102	46931	46931	I	0	" Flamen was silent . The poet in him — and in an artist there is always more or less of the poet — kept him back from ridicule , nay , moved him to pity and respect . They were absurdly simple words no doubt , had little wisdom in them , and were quite childish in their utterance , and yet they moved him curiously as a man very base and callous may at times be moved by the look in a dying deer 's eyes , or by the sound of a song that some lost love once sang . He rose and drew her hands away , and took her small face between his own hands instead . "
47107	47125	47103	47105	Poor little Bébée	101	" he said gently , looking down on her with a breath that was almost a sigh . "
47136	47344	47345	47345	You	1530	" She was a little startled ; her cheeks grew very warm under his touch , but her eyes looked still into his without fear . He stooped and touched her forehead with his lips , gently and without passion , almost reverently ; she grew rose - hued as the bright bean - flowers , up to the light gold ripples of her hair ; she trembled a little and drew back , but she was not alarmed nor yet ashamed ; she was too simple of heart to feel the fear that is born of passion and of consciousness . It was as Jeannot kissed his sister Marie , who was fifteen years old and sold milk for the Krebs people in the villages with a little green cart and a yellow dog — no more . And yet the sunny arbor leaves and the glimpse of the blue sky swam round her indistinctly , and the sounds of the guitar grew dull upon her ear and were lost as in a rushing hiss of water , because of the great sudden unintelligible happiness that seemed to bear her little life away on it as a sea wave bears a young child off its feet . "
47354	47360	47352	47352	Bébée	101	" he whispered to her . "
47363	47481	47352	47352	Bébée	101	" she answered him softly under her breath , and sat still , while all her body quivered like a leaf . No ; how could she ever be alone now that this sweet , soft , unutterable touch would always be in memory upon her ; how could she wish ever again now to be the corn - crake in the summer corn or the gray mouse in the hedge of hawthorn ? At that moment a student went by past the entrance of the arbor ; he had a sash round his loins and a paper feather in his cap ; he was playing a fife and dancing ; he glanced in as he went . "
47491	47599	47489	47489	Bébée	101	" said Flamen . So it came to pass that Bébée 's day in the big forest came and went as simply almost as any day that she had played away with the Varnhart children under the beech shadows of Cambre woods . And when he took her to her hut at sunset before the pilgrims had returned there was a great bewildered tumult of happiness in her heart , but there was no memory with her that prevented her from looking at the shrine in the wall as she passed it , and saying with a quick gesture of the cross on brow and bosom , — "
47639	47666	47669	47669	she	1533	" And she took another moss - rose and changed it for that of the morning , which was faded , and said to Flamen . — "
47691	47714	47722	47722	Bébée	101	" He did not answer , but he held her hands against him a moment as they fastened in the rose bud . "
47727	47728	47722	47722	Bébée	101	" "
47763	48290	47739	47739	them	2503	" But there was a touch of anxiety in the words ; she was not quite certain ; she wanted to be reassured . Instinct moved her not to speak of him ; but habit made it seem wrong to her to have any secret from the people who had been about her from her birth . He did not reassure her ; her anxiety was pretty to watch , and he left the trouble in her heart like a bee in the chalice of a lily . Besides , the little wicket gate was between them ; he was musing whether he would push it open once more . Her fate was in the balance , though she did not dream it : he had dealt with her tenderly , honestly , sacredly all that day — almost as much so as stupid Jeannot could have done . He had been touched by her trust in him , and by the unconscious beauty of her fancies , into a mood that was unlike all his life and habits . But after all , he said to himself — After all ! — Where he stood in the golden evening he saw the rosy curled mouth , the soft troubled eves , the little brown hands that still tried to fasten the rosebud , the young peach - like skin where the wind stirred the bodice;—she was only a little Flemish peasant , this poor little Bébée , a little thing of the fields and the streets , for all the dreams of God that abode with her . After all — soon or late — the end would be always the same . What matter ! She would weep a little to - morrow , and she would not kneel any more at the shrine in the garden wall ; and then — and then — she would stay here and marry the good boor Jeannot , just the same after a while ; or drift away after him to Paris , and leave her two little wooden shoes , and her visions of Christ in the fields at evening , behind her forevermore , and do as all the others did , and take not only silken stockings but the Cinderella slipper that is called Gold , which brings all other good things in its train;—what matter ! He had meant this from the first , because she was so pretty , and those little wooden sabots ran so lithely over the stones ; though he was not in love with her , but only idly stretched his hand for her as a child by instinct stretches to a fruit that hangs in the sun a little rosier and a little nearer than the rest . What matter — he said to himself — she loved him , poor little soul , though she did not know it ; and there would always be Jeannot glad enough of a handful of bright French gold . He pushed the gate gently against her ; her hands fastened the rosebud and drew open the latch themselves . "
48298	48310	48311	48311	You	1536	" she said , with the happy light in her face . "
48435	48493	48433	48433	you	1536	" She spoke with the pretty outspoken frankness of her habitual speech , just tempered and broken with the happy , timid hesitation , the curious sense at once of closer nearness and of greater distance , that had come on her since he had kissed her among the bright beanflowers . He turned from her quickly . "
48516	48638	48644	48644	he	1542	" Then , with a hurriedly backward glance down the dusky lane to see that none were looking , he bent his head and kissed her again quickly and with a sort of shame , and swung the gate behind him and went away through the boughs and the shadows . Bébée looked after him wistfully till his figure was lost in the gloom . The village was very quiet ; a dog barking afar off and a cow lowing in the meadow were the only living things that made their presence heard ; the pilgrims had not returned . She leaned on the gate a few minutes in that indistinct , dreamy happiness which is the prerogative of innocent love . "
48652	48714	48644	48644	he	1542	" she said again and again to herself . It was as if a king had stooped for a little knot of daisied grass to set it in his crown where the great diamonds should be . She did not reason . She did not question . She did not look beyond that hour — such is the privilege of youth . "
48741	48870	48873	48874	dear roses	1543	" she thought , swaying the little gate lightly under her weight , and looking with glad eyes at the goats as they frisked with their young in the pasture on the other side of the big trees , whilst one by one the stars came out , and an owl hooted from the palace woods , and the frogs croaked good - nights in the rushes . Then , like a little day laborer as she was , with the habit of toil and the need of the poor upon her from her birth up , she shut down the latch of the gate , kissed it where his hand had rested , and went to the well to draw its nightly draught for the dry garden . "
48876	48892	48873	48874	dear roses	1543	" she said to them as she rained the silvery showers over their nodding heads . "
48931	48955	48958	48959	no one	1950	" But the roses shook the water off them in the wind , and said , as she wished them to say , — "
48971	49053	48964	48964	Bébée	101	" For roses , like everything else upon earth , only speak what our own heart puts into them . An old man went past up the lane ; old Jehan , who was too ailing and aged to make one of the pilgrimage . He looked at the little quick - moving form , grayish white in the starlight , with the dark copper vessel balanced on her head , going to and fro betwixt the well and the garden . "
49066	49074	49054	49054	You	101	" he said across the sweetbrier hedge . "
49149	49223	49224	49224	I	0	" Bébée colored behind the hedge , and ran in and brought three new - laid eggs that she had left in the flour - bin in the early morning , and thrust them on him through a break in the brier . It was the first time she had ever done anything of which she might not speak : she was ashamed , and yet the secret was so sweet to her . "
49234	49262	49265	49265	she	0	" she murmured , with a tremulous breath and a shine in her eyes that the old man 's ears and sight were too dull to discern . "
49266	49280	49282	49282	she	0	" muttered Jehan , as he thrust the eggs into his old patched blue blouse,—"so
49318	49710	49712	49712	you	1551	" On a sudden impulse Flamen , going through the woodland shadows to the city , paused and turned back ; all his impulses were quick and swayed him now hither , now thither , in many contrary ways . He knew that the hour was come — that he must leave her and spare her , as to himself he phrased it , or teach her the love words that the daisies whisper to women . And why not?—anyway she would marry Jeannot . He , half - way to the town , walked back again and paused a moment at the gate ; an emotion half pitiful , half cynical , stirred in him . Anyway he would leave her in a few days : Paris had again opened her arms to him ; his old life awaited him ; women who claimed him by imperious , amorous demands reproached him ; and after all this day he had got the Gretchen of his ideal , a great picture for the future of his fame . As he would leave her anyway so soon , he would leave her unscathed — poor little field flower — he could never take it with him to blossom or wither in Paris . His world would laugh too utterly if he made for himself a mistress out of a little Fleming in two wooden shoes . Besides — Besides , something that was half weak and half noble moved him not to lead this child , in her trust and her ignorance , into ways that when she awakened from her trance would seem to her shameful and full of sorrow . For he knew that Bébée was not as others are . He turned back and knocked at the hut door and opened it . Bébée was just beginning to undress herself ; she had taken off her white kerchief and her wooden shoes ; her pretty shoulders and her little neck shone white in the moon ; her feet were bare on the mud floor . She started with a cry and threw the handkerchief again on her shoulders , but there was no fear of him ; only the unconscious instinct of her girlhood . He thought for a moment that he would not go away until the morrow — "
49716	49747	49712	49712	you	1551	" said Bébée softly , with happy eyes of surprise and yet a little startled , fearing some evil might have happened to him that he should have returned thus . "
49758	49803	49750	49750	I	0	" he said gently ; no — he did not want her , poor little soul ; she wanted him , but he — there were so many of these things in his life , and he liked her too well to love her . "
49814	49851	49808	49808	I	0	" said Flamen , drawing her arms about him , and feeling her flutter like a little bird , while the moonlight came in through the green leaves and fell in fanciful patterns on the floor . "
49876	49877	49872	49874	poor little Bébée	101	" "
49882	49920	49872	49874	poor little Bébée	101	" she sighed rather than said the answer in her wondrous gladness ; drawn there close to him , with the softness of his lips upon her . Could he have come back only to ask that ? "
49935	49943	49927	49927	You	1551	" he murmured in his unconscious cruelty . "
49988	49989	49977	49977	I	0	" "
49993	50046	50047	50047	You	101	" She trembled in his arms and turned cold as ice ; a great terror and darkness fell upon her ; she had never thought that he would ever go away . He caressed her , and played with her as a boy may with a bird before he wrings its neck . "
50052	50057	50047	50047	You	101	" He kissed her : "
50060	50061	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50066	50067	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50074	50075	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50080	50081	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50084	50085	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50092	50093	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50096	50097	50047	50047	You	101	" "
50103	50127	50130	50130	dear	2076	" He looked aside from the beseeching , tearful , candid eyes , and kissed her hair and her throat , and said , "
50136	50153	50130	50130	dear	2076	" She clung to him , crying silently ; he wished that women would not weep . "
50160	50173	50156	50156	Bébée	101	" he said coaxingly , thinking to break the bitterness to her . "
50284	50293	50277	50277	you	101	" For an answer she kissed his hand . "
50302	50320	50294	50294	You	101	" he said , with his lips caressing her soft brown arms that were round his neck . "
50460	50470	50471	50471	You	101	" She clung to him , sobbing without sound . "
50481	50504	50505	50505	I	0	" she moaned , clasping him closer and closer . Flamen 's own eyes grew dim . But he lied to her : "
50511	50672	50508	50508	I	0	" It was so much easier to say so , and it would break her sorrow . So he thought . For the moment again he was tempted to take her with him — but , he resisted it — he would tire , and she would cling to him forever . There was a long silence . The bleating of the little kid in the shed without was the only sound ; the gray lavender blew to and fro . Her arms were close about his throat ; he kissed them again , and kissed her eyes , her cheek , her mouth ; then put her from him quickly and went out . She ran to him , and threw herself on the damp ground and held him there , and leaned her forehead on his feet . But though he looked at her with wet eyes , he did not yield , and he still said , — "
50691	50759	50760	50760	I	0	" Then he kissed her once more many times , and put her gently within the door and closed it . A low , sharp , sudden cry reached him , went to his heart , but he did not turn ; he went on through the wet , green little garden , and the curling leaves , where he had found peace and had left desolation . "
50772	51089	51090	51090	She	1570	" thought Flamen ; and he believed himself a good man for once in his life , and pitied himself for having become a sentimentalist . She would marry Jeannot , and bear many children , as those people always did ; and ruddy little peasants would cling about these pretty , soft , little breasts of hers ; and she would love them after the manner of such women , and be very content clattering over the stones in her wooden shoes ; and growing brown and stout , and more careful after money , and ceasing to dream of unknown things , and not seeing God at all in the fields , but looking low and beholding only the ears of the gleaning wheat and the feet of the tottering children ; and so gaining her bread , and losing her soul , and stooping nearer and nearer to earth till she dropped into it like one of her own wind - blown wall - flowers when the bee has sucked out all its sweetness and the heats have scorched up all its bloom:—yes , of course , she would marry Jeannot and end so ! Meanwhile he had his Gretchen , and that was the one great matter . So he left the street of Mary of Burgundy , and went on his way out of the chiming city as its matin bells were rung , and took with him a certain regret , and the only innocent affection that had ever awakened in him ; and thought of his self - negation with half admiration and half derision ; and so drifted away into the whirlpool of his amorous , cynical , changeful , passionate , callous , many - colored life , and said to himself as he saw the last line of the low green plains shine against the sun , "
51112	51216	51105	51105	Gretchen	161	" What else mattered very much , after all , except what they would say in Paris of Gretchen ? People saw that Bébée had grown very quiet . But that was all they saw . Her little face was pale as she sat among her glowing autumn blossoms , by the side of the cobbler 's stall ; and when the Varnhart children cried at the gate to her to come and play , she would answer gently that she was too busy to have play - time now . The fruit girl of the Montagne de la Cour hooted after her , "
51268	51311	51261	51261	Jeannot	144	" And old Jehan , who was the tenderest soul of them all in the lane by the swans ' water , would come and look at her wistfully as she worked among the flowers , and would say to her , — "
51394	51532	51388	51388	one	1951	" But to the mocking of the fruit girl , as to the tenderness of old Jehan , Bébée answered nothing ; the lines of her pretty curled mouth grew grave and sad , and in her eyes there was a wistful , bewildered , pathetic appeal like the look in the eyes of a beaten dog , which , while it aches with pain , does not cease to love its master . One resolve upheld and made her feet firm on the stones of the streets and her lips mute under all they said to her . She would learn all she could , and be good , and patient , and wise , if trying could make her wise , and so do his will in all things — until he should come back . "
51540	51574	51538	51538	Bébée	101	" said Annémie , who grew so blind that she could scarce see the flags at the mastheads , and who still thought that she pricked the lace patterns and earned her bread . "
51769	51882	51883	51883	He	1592	" And Bébée would shudder as she swept the cobwebs from the garret walls,—patient as she was , she who had sat here fifty years watching for a dead man and for a wrecked ship . The wheat was reapen in the fields , and the brown earth turned afresh . The white and purple chrysanthemums bloomed against the flowerless rose - bushes , and the little gray Michaelmas daisy flourished where the dead carnations had spread their glories . Leaves began to fall and chilly winds to sigh among the willows ; the squirrels began to store away their nuts , and the poor to pick up the broken bare boughs . "
51891	52431	51883	51883	He	1592	" thought Bébée , every day when she rose and felt each morning cooler and grayer than the one before it ; winter was near . Her little feet already were cold in their wooden shoes ; and the robin already sang in the twigs of the sear sweetbrier ; but she had the brave sweet faith which nothing kills , and she did not doubt — oh ! no , she did not doubt , she was only tired . Tired of the strange , sleepless , feverish nights ; tired of the long , dull , empty days : tired of watching down the barren , leafless lane : tired of hearkening breathless to each step on the rustling dead leaves ; tired of looking always , always , always , into the ruddy autumn evenings and the cold autumn starlight , and never hearing what she listened for , never seeing what she sought ; tired as a child may be lost in a wood , and wearily wearing its small strength and breaking its young heart in search of the track forever missed , of the home forever beyond the horizon . Still she did her work and kept her courage . She took her way into the town with her basket full of the ruby and amber of the dusky autumn blossoms , and when those failed , and the garden was quite desolate , except for a promise of haws and of holly , she went , as she had always done , to the lace - room , and gained her bread and the chickens ' corn each day by winding the thread round the bobbins ; and at nightfall when she had plodded home through the darksome roads and over the sodden turf , and had lit her rushlight and sat down to her books , with her hand buried in her hair , and her eyes smarting from the strain of the lace - work and her heart aching with that new and deadly pain which never left her now , she would read — read — read — read , and try and store her brain with knowledge , and try and grasp these vast new meanings of life that the books opened to her , and try and grow less ignorant against he should return . There was much she could not understand , bait there was also much she could . Her mind was delicate and quick , her intelligence swift and strong ; she bought old books at bookstalls with pence that she saved by going without her dinner . The keeper of the stall , a shrewd old soul , explained some hard points to her , and chose good volumes for her , and lent others to this solitary little student in her wooden shoes and with her pale child 's face . So she toiled hard and learned much , and grew taller and very thin , and got a look in her eyes like a lost dog 's , and yet never lost heart or wandered in the task that he had set her , or in her faith in his return . "
52438	52451	52436	52436	Bébée	101	" whispered the children again and again , clinging to her skirts . "
52483	52668	52669	52669	You	1594	" Bébée kissed them , but kept to her books . Jeannot going by from the forest night after night saw the light twinkling in the hut window , and sometimes crept softly up and looked through the chinks of the wooden shutter , and saw her leaning over some big old volume with her pretty brows drawn together , and her mouth shut close in earnest effort , and he would curse the man who had changed her so and go away with rage in his breast and tears in his eyes , not daring to say anything , but knowing that never would Bébée 's little brown hand lie in love within his own . Nor even in friendship , for he had rashly spoken rough words against the stranger from Rubes ' land , and Bébée ever since then had passed him by with a grave , simple greeting , and when he had brought her in timid gifts a barrow - load of fagots , had thanked him , but had bidden him take the wood home to his mother . "
52678	52698	52669	52669	You	1594	" good Jeannot had pleaded , with a sob in his voice ; and she had answered gently , — "
52712	53108	53109	53109	You	1595	" Then he had cursed her absent lover , and Bébée gone within and closed her door . She had no idea that the people thought ill of her . They were cold to her , and such coldness made her heart ache a little more . But the one great love in her possessed her so strongly that all other things were half unreal . She did her daily housework from sheer habit , and she studied because he had told her to do it , and because with the sweet , stubborn , credulous faith of her youth , she never doubted that he would return . Otherwise there was no perception of real life in her ; she dreamed and prayed , and prayed and dreamed , and never ceased to do either one or the other , even when she was scattering potato - peels to the fowls , or shaking carrots loose of the soil , or sweeping the snow from her hut door , or going out in the raw dark dawn as the single little sad bell of St. Guido tolled through the stillness for the first mass . For though even Father Francis looked angered at her because he thought she was stubborn , and hid some truth and some shame from him at confession , yet she went resolutely and oftener than ever to kneel in the dusty , dusky , crumbling old church , for it was all she could do for him who was absent — so she thought — and she did not feel quite so far away from him when she was beseeching Christ to have care of his soul and of his body . All her pretty dreams were dead . She never heard any story in the robin 's song , or saw any promise in the sunset clouds , or fancied that angels came about her in the night — never now . The fields were gray and sad ; the birds were little brown things ; the stars were cold and far off ; the people she had used to care for were like mere shadows that went by her meaningless and without interest , and all she thought of was the one step that never came : all she wanted was the one touch she never felt . "
53123	53144	53114	53114	Bébée	101	" said the few neighbors who ever spoke to her . Bébée looked at them with wistful , uncomprehending eyes . "
53151	53931	53145	53145	I	0	" she said gently , but no one believed her . A girl did not shut herself up and wane pale and thin for nothing , so they reasoned . She might have sinned as she had liked if she had been sensible after it , and married Jeannot . But to fret mutely , and shut her lips , and seem as though she had done nothing,—that was guilt indeed . For her village , in its small way , thought as the big world thinks . Full winter came . The snow was deep , and the winds drove the people with whips of ice along the dreary country roads and the steep streets of the city . The bells of the dogs and the mules sounded sadly through the white misty silence of the Flemish plains , and the weary horses slipped and fell on the frozen ruts and on the jagged stones in the little frost - shut Flemish towns . Still the Flemish folk were gay enough in many places . There were fairs and kermesses ; there were puppet plays and church feasts ; there were sledges on the plains and skates on the canals ; there were warm woollen hoods and ruddy wood fires ; there were tales of demons and saints , and bowls of hot onion soup ; sugar images for the little children , and blessed beads for the maidens clasped on rosy throats with lovers ' kisses ; and in the city itself there was the high tide of the winter pomp and mirth , with festal scenes in the churches , and balls at the palaces , and all manner of gay things in toys and jewels , and music playing cheerily under the leafless trees , and flashes of scarlet cloth , and shining furs , and happy faces , and golden curls , in the carriages that climbed the Montagne de la Cour , and filled the big place around the statue of stout Godfrey . In the little village above St. Guido , Bébée 's neighbors were merry too , in their simple way . The women worked away wearily at their lace in the dim winter light , and made a wretched living by it , but all the same they got penny playthings for their babies , and a bit of cake for their Sunday - hearth . They drew together in homely and cordial friendship , and of an afternoon when dusk fell wove their lace in company in Mère Krebs 's mill - house kitchen with the children and the dogs at their feet on the bricks , so that one big fire might serve for all , and all be lighted with one big rush candle , and all be beguiled by chit - chat and songs , stories of spirits , and whispers of ghosts , and now and then when the wind howled at its worst , a paternoster or two said in common for the men toiling in the barges or drifting up the Scheldt . In these gatherings Bébée 's face was missed , and the blithe soft sound of her voice , like a young thrush singing , was never heard . The people looked in , and saw her sitting over a great open book ; often her hearth had no fire . Then the children grew tired of asking her to play ; and their elders began to shake their heads ; she was so pale and so quiet , there must be some evil in it — so they began to think . Little by little people dropped away from her . Who knew , the gossips said , what shame or sin the child might not have on her sick little soul ? True , Bébée worked hard just the same , and just the same was seen trudging to and fro in the dusk of dawns and afternoons in her two little wooden shoes . She was gentle and laborious , and gave the children her goat 's milk , and the old women the brambles of her garden . But they grew afraid of her — afraid of that sad , changeless , far - away look in her eves , and of the mute weariness that was on her — and , being perplexed , were sure , like all ignorant creatures , that what was secret must be also vile . So they hung aloof , and let her alone , and by and by scarcely nodded as they passed her but said to Jeannot , — "
54031	54137	54027	54029	Katto 's Lisa	211	" But Jeannot would never listen to the slanderers , and would never look at Lisa , even though the door of the little hut was always closed against him ; and whenever he met Bébée on the highway she never seemed to see him more than she saw the snow that her sabots were treading . One night in the midwinter - time old Annémie died . Bébée found her in the twilight with her head against the garret window , and her left side all shrivelled and useless . She had a little sense left , and a few fleeting breaths to draw . "
54143	54147	54148	54148	You	1604	" she muttered . "
54190	54451	54457	54457	him	1607	" But her dead sailor never came into port ; she went to him . The poor , weakened , faithful old body of her was laid in the graveyard of the poor , and the ships came and went under the empty garret window , and Bébée was all alone . She had no more anything to work for , or any bond with the lives of others . She could live on the roots of her garden and the sale of her hens ' eggs , and she could change the turnips and carrots that grew in a little strip of her ground for the quantity of bread that she needed . So she gave herself up to the books , and drew herself more and more within from the outer world . She did not know that the neighbors thought very evil of her ; she had only one idea in her mind — to be more worthy of him against he should return . The winter passed away somehow , she did not know how . It was a long , cold , white blank of frozen silence : that was all . She studied hard , and had got a quaint , strange , deep , scattered knowledge out of her old books ; her face had lost all its roundness and color , but , instead , the forehead had gained breadth and the eyes had the dim fire of a student 's . Every night when she shut her volumes she thought , — "
54465	54486	54487	54487	I	0	" Just so every morning , when she bathed her hands in the chilly water , she thought to herself , "
54512	54652	54505	54510	the ladies ' he has loved	1608	" Love to be perfect must be a religion , as well as a passion . Bébée 's was so . Like George Herbert 's serving - maiden , she swept no specks of dirt away from a floor without doing it to the service of her lord . Only Bébée 's lord was a king of earth , made of earth 's dust and vanities . But what did she know of that ? The winter went by , and the snow - drops and crocus and pale hepatica smiled at her from the black clods . Every other springtime Bébée had run with fleet feet under the budding trees down into the city , and had sold sweet little wet bunches of violets and brier before all the snow was melted from the eaves of the Broodhuis . "
54658	54665	54505	54510	the ladies ' he has loved	1608	" the townspeople used to say ; "
54675	55079	54670	54670	Bébée	101	" But this year they did not see the little figure itself like a rosy crocus standing against the brown timbers of the Maison de Roi . Bébée had not heart to pluck a single blossom of them all . She let them all live , and tended them so that the little garden should look its best and brightest to him when his hand should lift its latch . Only he was so long coming — so very long ; the violets died away , and the first rosebuds came in their stead , and still Bébée looked every dawn and every nightfall vainly down the empty road . Nothing kills young creatures like the bitterness of waiting . Pain they will bear , and privation they will pass through , fire and water and storm will not appall them , nor wrath of heaven and earth , but waiting — the long , tedious , sickly , friendless days , that drop one by one in their eternal sameness into the weary past , these kill slowly but surely , as the slow dropping of water frets away rock . The summer came . Nearly a year had gone by . Bébée worked early and late . The garden bloomed like one big rose , and the neighbors shook their heads to see the flowers blossom and fall without bringing in a single coin . She herself spoke less seldom than ever ; and now when old Jehan , who never had understood the evil thoughts of his neighbors , asked her what ailed her that she looked so pale and never stirred down to the city , now her courage failed her , and the tears brimmed over her eyes , and she could not call up a brave brief word to answer him . For the time was so long , and she was so tired . Still she never doubted that her lover would comeback : he had said he would come : she was as sure that he would come as she was sure that God came in the midst of the people when the silver bell rang and the Host was borne by on high . Bébée did not heed much , but she vaguely - felt the isolation she was left in : as a child too young to reason feels cold and feels hunger . "
55091	55151	55087	55087	Annémie	142	" she thought to herself , as the sweet green spring days unfolded themselves one by one like the buds of the brier - rose hedges . And now and then even the loyal little soul of her gave way , and sobbing on her lonely bed in the long dark nights , she would cry out against him , "
55169	55375	55161	55161	I	0	" And then she would reproach herself with treason to him and ingratitude , and hate herself and feel guilty in her own sight to have thus sinned against him in thought for one single instant . For there are natures in which the generosity of love is so strong that it feels its own just pain to be disloyalty ; and Bébée 's was one of them . And if he had killed her she would have died hoping only that no moan had escaped her under the blow that ever could accuse him . These natures , utterly innocent by force of self - accusation and self - abasement , suffer at once the torment of the victim and the criminal . One day in the May weather she sat within doors with a great book upon her table , but no sight for it in her aching eyes . The starling hopped to and fro on the sunny floor ; the bees boomed in the porch ; the tinkle of sheep 's bells came in on the stillness . All was peaceful and happy except the little weary , breaking , desolate heart that beat in her like a caged bird 's . "
55387	55443	55383	55383	he	1610	" she said to herself ; but she was so tired , and it was so long — oh , dear God!—so very long . A hand tapped at the lattice . The shrill voice of Reine , the sabot - maker 's wife , broken with anguish , called through the hanging ivy , — "
55551	55579	55581	55581	I	0	" Bébée rose up , startled by the now unfamiliar sound of a human voice , and looked at the breathless mother with eyes of pitying wonder . "
55585	55591	55581	55581	I	0	" she said , gently ; "
55611	55841	55601	55601	I	0	" Then she went out quickly and ran through the lanes and into the city for the sick child , and found the wise man , and sent him , and did the errand rather in a sort of sorrowful sympathetic instinct than in any reasoning consciousness of doing good . When she was moving through the once familiar and happy ways as the sun was setting on the golden fronts of the old houses , and the chimes were ringing from the many towers , a strange sense of unreality , of non - existence , fell upon her . Could it be she?—she indeed — who had gone there the year before the gladdest thing that the earth bore , with no care except to shelter her flowers from the wind , and keep the freshest blossoms for the burgomaster 's housewife ? She did not think thus to herself ; but a vague doubt that she could ever have been the little gay , laborious , happy Bébée , with troops of friends and endless joys for every day that dawned , came over her as she went by the black front of the Broodhuis . The strong voice of Lisa , the fruit girl , jarred on her as she passed the stall under its yellow awning that was flapping sullenly in the evening wind . "
55848	55854	55845	55846	little fool	1623	" the mocking voice cried , "
55965	56101	55960	55961	a painter	2033	" Lisa tossed her as she spoke a torn sheet , in which she was wrapping gentians : it was a piece of newspaper some three weeks old , and in it there was a single line or so which said that the artist Flamen , whose Gretchen was the wonder of the Salon of the year , lay sick unto death in his rooms in Paris . Bébée stood and read ; the strong ruddy western light upon the type , the taunting laughter of the fruit girl on her ear . A bitter shriek rang from her that made even the cruelty of Lisa 's mirth stop in a sudden terror . She stood staring like a thing changed to stone down on the one name that to her rilled all the universe . "
56112	56121	56123	56123	you	1628	" she echoed piteously , looking at Lisa ; "
56129	56130	56123	56123	you	1628	" "
56142	56180	56181	56181	You	1624	" said the fruit girl , roughly . She judged by her own penniless student lads ; and she was angered with herself for feeling sorrow for this little silly thing that she had loved to torture . "
56207	56326	56201	56201	I	0	" said Bébée , in a swift broken breath , and with a look upon her face that startled into pain her callous enemy . Then without another word , she thrust the paper in her bosom , and ran out of the square breathless with haste and with a great resolve . He was ill — and he was poor ! The brave little soul of her leaped at once to action . He was sick , and far away ; and poor they said . All danger and all difficulty faded to nothing before the vision of his need . Bébée was only a little foundling who ran about in wooden shoes ; but she had the "
56330	56445	56446	56446	I	0	" in her — the soul that will follow faithfully though to receive a curse , that will defend loyally though to meet a blow , and that will die mutely loving to the last . She went home , how she never knew ; and without the delay of a moment packed up a change of linen , and fed the fowls and took the key of the hut down to old Jehan 's cabin . The old man was only half - witted by reason of his affliction for his dead daughter , but he was shrewd enough to understand what she wanted of him , and honest enough to do it . "
56453	56459	56446	56446	I	0	" she said to him : "
56486	56511	56471	56471	you	1631	" Old Jehan put his head out of his lattice : it was seven in the evening , and he was going to bed . "
56520	56546	56514	56514	you	0	" he asked : going to show the fine buckles at a students ' ball ? Nay , fie ; that is not like you . "
56547	56558	56559	56559	she	0	" I am going to — pray — dear Jehan , "
56577	56612	56613	56613	He	1633	" Do what I ask you — do for your dead daughter 's sake — or the birds and the flowers will die of hunger and thirst . Take the key and promise me . "
56621	56636	56637	56637	he	1633	" Do not let them see those buckles shine ; they will rob you , "
57107	57111	57112	57112	she	101	" To Paris ? "
57133	57141	57142	57142	they	1653	" Twenty - seven francs — quick ! "
57217	57229	57206	57206	She	101	" Would you take these ? They are worth much more . "
57258	57285	57251	57251	She	101	" Take me — oh , pray take me ! I will go with the sheep , with the cattle — only , only take me ! "
57397	57405	57406	57406	she	101	" Can I never go without money ? "
57431	57444	57445	57445	he	1659	" The least is twenty francs — surely you must know that ? "
57490	57507	57508	57508	she	101	" There is no way at all to go without money to Paris , I suppose ? "
57548	57583	57545	57545	her	627	" Eh?—no , dear . There is nothing to be done anywhere in the world without money . Look , I can not get a litre of nuts to sell unless I pay beforehand . "
57584	57592	57545	57545	her	627	" Would it be far to walk ? "
57593	57667	57545	57545	her	627	" Far ! Holy Jesus ! It is right away in the heart of France — over two hundred miles , they say ; straight out through the forest . Not but what my son did walk it once;—and he a shoemaker , who knows what walking costs ; and he is well - to - do there now — not that he ever writes . When they want nothing people never write . "
57668	57675	57545	57545	her	627	" And he walked into Paris ? "
57676	57741	57545	57545	her	627	" Yes , ten years ago . He had nothing but a few sous and an ash stick , and he had a fancy to try his luck there . And after all our feet were given us to travel with . If you go there and you see him , tell him to send me something — I am tired of selling nuts . "
57994	58017	58018	58018	she	101	" What a blessing it is to have been born poor ; and to have lived hardly — one wants so little ! "
59058	59069	59071	59072	the woman	1713	" It is a long way to walk to Paris , "
59088	59098	59100	59102	the Rixensart people	1714	" She has the look of the little Gesù , "
60139	60145	60146	60146	she	101	" Oh , help me ! "
60151	60272	60146	60146	she	101	" Oh , pray , help me ! I have walked all the way from Brussels — that is my country — and now they will not let me pass that house where the soldiers are . They say I have no papers . What papers should I have ? I do not know . When one has done no harm , and does not owe a sou anywhere , and has walked all the way — Is it money that they want ? I have none ; and they stole my silver clasps in Brussels ; and if I do not get to Paris I must die — die without seeing him again — ever again , dear God ! "
60347	60491	60338	60338	He	1767	" Get up quick , and I will pass you . It is against the law , and I may go to prison for it . Never mind ; one must risk something in this world , or else be a cur . My daughter has stayed behind in Marbais sweethearting ; her name is on my passport , and her age and face will do for yours . Get up and follow me close , and I will get you through . Poor little soul ! Whatever your woe is it is real enough , and you are such a young and pretty thing . Get up , the guards are in their house , they have not seen ; follow me , and you must not speak a word ; they must take you for a German , dumb as wood . "
60604	60624	60626	60627	the pedler	1780	" I have done wrong in the law , but not before God , I think , little one , "
60629	60698	60626	60627	the pedler	1780	" Nay , do not thank me , or go on like that ; we are in sight of the customs men still , and if they suspected , it would be the four walls of a cell only that you and I should see to - night . And now tell me your story , poor maiden : why are you on foot through a strange country ? "
61099	61106	61107	61107	she	101	" But what if I do ? "
61112	61119	61107	61107	she	101	" Annémie never will hurt me . "
61743	61752	61753	61754	a woman	217	" Are you ill , you little thing ? "
61777	61787	61770	61770	Bébée	101	" I do not know — I am happy . "
62467	62474	62475	62475	she	101	" He must be very poor ! "
62478	62483	62475	62475	she	101	" to live so high "
62551	62567	62568	62568	she	101	" He will be glad ; oh , I am sure he will be glad ! "
62640	62656	62657	62657	she	101	" But he will be glad — oh , I know he will be glad ! "
62668	62687	62657	62657	she	101	" And if God will only let me save his life , what else do I want more ? "
62823	62830	62831	62831	she	101	" It is I — Bébée . "
63171	63180	63181	63181	she	101	" Let me die ! let me die ! "
63316	63326	63330	63330	she	101	" Do not touch me — take me home . "
63499	63504	63493	63494	her starling	1878	" Bonjour , Bonjour ! "
63895	63902	63903	63904	the women	346	" If she would only speak ! "
63943	63948	63949	63949	they	346	" Give her rest , "
64089	64104	64078	64078	his	185	" Another dead — another dead!—the red mill and I see them all dead ! "
64171	64184	64185	64185	she	101	" Get me a rosebud — one with the moss round it , "
64225	64231	64232	64232	she	101	" Send them to him , "
64236	64245	64232	64232	she	101	" tell him I walked all the way . "
64948	64955	64956	64956	she	101	" He does not want me ! "
64961	64972	64956	64956	she	101	" he does not want me!—other women kiss him there ! "
65012	65019	65020	65020	she	101	" He does not want me ! "
65023	65039	65020	65020	she	101	" he does not want me — and I am so tired . Dear God ! "
65159	65166	65167	65167	he	176	" One creature loved me once , "
