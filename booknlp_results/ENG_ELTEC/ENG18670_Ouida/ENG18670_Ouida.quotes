0	16	18	19	Mr. Rake	399	" I do n't say but what he 's difficult to please with his Tops , "
69	455	47	47	he	399	" he is uncommon particular about 'em ; and if his leathers ai n't as white as snow he 'll never touch 'em , tho ' as soon as the pack come nigh him at Royallieu , the leathers might just as well never have been cleaned , them hounds jump about him so ; old Champion 's at his saddle before you can say Davy Jones . Tops are trials , I ai n't denying that , specially when you 've jacks , and moccasins , and moor boots , and Russia - leather crickets , and turf hacks , and Hythe boots , and waterproofs , and all manner of varnish things for dress , that none of the boys will do right unless you look after 'em yourself . But is it likely that he should know what a worry a Top 's complexion is , and how hard it is to come right with all the Fast Brown polishing in the world ? How should he guess what a piece of work it is to get 'em all of a colour , and how like they are to come mottled , and how a'most sure they 'll ten to one go off dark just as they 're growing yellow , and put you to shame , let you do what you will to make 'em cut a shine over the country ? How should he know ? I do n't complain of that ; bless you , he never thinks . It 's ' do this , Rake , ' ' do that , ' and he never remember ' t is n't done by magic . But he 's a true gentleman , Mr. Cecil ; never grudge a guinea , or a fiver to you ; never out of temper neither ; always have a kind word for you if you want ; thoro'-bred every inch of him ; see him bring down a rocketer , or lift his horse over the Broad Water ! He 's a gentleman — not like your snobs that have nothing sound about 'em but their cash , and swept out their shops before they bought their fine feathers!—and I 'll be d — d if I care what I do for him .

Bid Willon get some Banbury bits — I prefer the revolving mouths — and some of Wood 's double mouths and Nelson gags ; we want new ones . Mind that lever - snap breech - loader comes home in time . Look in at the Commission stables , and , if you see a likely black charger as good as Black Douglas , tell me . Write about the stud fox - terrier , and buy the blue Dandy Dinmont ; Lady Guenevere wants him . I 'll take him down with me . But first put me into harness , Rake ; it 's getting late . "
1716	1946	1948	1948	Cecil	628	" As if Parliament could n't meet without dragging us through the dust ! The idiots write about ' the swells in the Guards , ' as if we had all fun and no work , and knew nothing of the rough of the Service . I should like to learn what they call sitting motionless in your saddle through half a day , while a London mob goes mad round you , and lost dogs snap at your charger 's nose , and dirty little beggars squeeze against your legs , and the sun broils you , or the fog soaks you , and you sit sentinel over a gingerbread coach till you 're deaf with the noise , and blind with the dust , and sick with the crowd , and half dead for want of sodas and brandies , and , from going a whole morning without one cigarette!—not to mention the inevitable apple - woman who invariably entangles herself between your horse 's legs , and the certainty of your riding down somebody and having a summons about it the next day ! If all that is n't the rough of the Service , I should like to know what is ? Why , the hottest day in the batteries , or the sharpest rush into Ghoorkahs or Bhoteahs , would be light work compared !

' Ca n't play in that row , ' said Charlie , for the women were shrieking like mad , and the engine was roaring like my mare Philippa — I'm afraid she 'll never be cured , poor thing!—so I put my head out and asked what was up ? We 'd run into a cattle train . Anybody hurt ? No , nobody hurt ; but we were to get out . ' I 'll be shot if I get out , ' I told 'em , ' till I 've finished the rubber .

Even the week you 've been in the Shires you have n't trained a bit ; you 've been waltzing or playing baccarât till five in the morning , and taking no end of sodas after to bring you right for the meet at nine . If a man will drink champagnes and burgundies as you do , and spend his time after women , I should like to know how he 's to be in hard riding condition , unless he expects a miracle . "

If he 's born to the pigskin he 'll be in at the distance safe enough , whether he smoke or do n't smoke , drink or do n't drink . As for training on raw chops , giving up wine , living like the very deuce and all , as if you were in a monastery , and changing yourself into a mere bag of bones — it 's utter bosh ! You might as well be in purgatory ; besides , it 's no more credit to win then than if you were a professional . "
10812	10828	10833	10835	Sir Vere Bellingham	472	" But you must have trained at Christ Church , Rock , for the Eight ? "

10858	10922	10924	10925	the Seraph	6132	" Did I ! Men came to me ; wanted me to join the Eight ; coxswain came , awful strict little fellow , docked his men of all their fun — took plenty himself , though ! Coxswain said I must begin to train , do as all his crew did . I threw up my sleeve and showed him my arm ; "
10938	11094	11125	11125	Cecil	628	" I said , ' There , sir , I 'll help you thrash Cambridge if you like , but train I wo n't , for you or for all the University . I 've been Captain of the Eton Eight , but I did n't keep my crew on tea and toast . I fattened 'em regularly three times a week on venison and champagne at Christopher 's . Very happy to feed yours , too , if you like ; game comes down to me every Friday from the Duke 's moors ; they look uncommonly as if they wanted it ! ' You should have seen his face!—Fatten the Eight ! He did n't let me do that , of course , but he was very glad of my oar in his rowlocks , and I helped him beat Cambridge without training an hour myself except so far as rowing hard went . "
11117	11123	11125	11125	Cecil	628	" Quite right , Seraph ! "
11127	11208	11224	11225	Sir Vere	472	" When a man comes up to the weights , looking like a homonunculus after he 's been getting every atom of flesh off him like a jockey , he ought to be struck out for the stakes , to my mind . ' Tisn't a question of riding , then , nor yet of pluck , or of management ; it 's nothing but a question of pounds , and of who can stand the tamest life the longest . "
11209	11222	11234	11234	Bertie	628	" Well , beneficial for one 's morals , at any rate , "
11227	11232	11234	11234	Bertie	628	" Morals be hanged ! "

11315	11380	11496	11496	Cecil	628	" Knew him at Aldershot . Fine rider ; give you a good bit of trouble , Beauty . Has n't been in England for years ; troop been such a while at Calcutta .

As the shout rose , Cecil 's left stirrup - leather snapped and gave way ; at the pace they were going most men , ay , and good riders too , would have been hurled out of their saddle by the shock ; he scarcely swerved ; a moment to ease the King and to recover his equilibrium , then he took the pace up again as though nothing had chanced . And his comrades of the Household when they saw this through their race - glasses , broke through their serenity and burst into a cheer that echoed over the grasslands and the coppices like a clarion , the grand rich voice of the Seraph leading foremost and loudest — a cheer that rolled mellow and triumphant down the cold bright air like the blast of trumpets , and thrilled on Bertie 's ear where he came down the course a mile away . It made his heart beat quicker with a victorious head - long delight , as his knees pressed closer into Forest King 's flanks , and , half stirrupless like the Arabs , he thundered forward to the greatest riding feat of his life . His face was very calm still , but his blood was in tumult , the delirium of pace had got on him , a minute of life like this was worth a year , and he knew that he would win , or die for it , as the land seemed to fly like a black sheet under him , and , in that killing speed , fence and hedge and double and water all went by him like a dream , whirling underneath him as the grey stretched stomach to earth over the level , and rose to leap after leap . For that instant 's pause , when the stirrup broke , threatened to lose him the race . He was more than a length behind the Regent , whose hoofs as they dashed the ground up sounded like thunder , and for whose herculean strength the ploughed lands had no terrors ; it was more than the lead to keep now , there was ground to cover , and the King was losing like Wild Geranium . Cecil felt drunk with that strong keen west wind that blew so strongly in his teeth , a passionate excitation was in him , every breath of winter air that rushed in its bracing currents round him seemed to lash him like a stripe:—the Household to look on and see him beaten ! Certain wild blood that lay latent in him under the tranquil gentleness of temper and of custom woke and had the mastery ; he set his teeth hard , and his hands clenched like steel on the bridle . "
19858	19877	19328	19328	Violet	513	" he cried , all unconsciously , half aloud , as they cleared the thirty - sixth fence . "
19890	20122	19328	19328	Violet	513	" As though Forest King heard the prayer and answered it with all his heart , the splendid form launched faster out , the stretching stride stretched farther yet with lightning spontaneity , every fibre strained , every nerve struggled , with a magnificent bound like an antelope the grey recovered the ground he had lost , and passed Bay Regent by a quarter - length . It was a neck to neck race once more , across the three meadows with the last and lower fences that were between them and the final leap of all ; that ditch of artificial water with the towering double hedge of oak rails and of blackthorn which was reared black and grim and well - nigh hopeless just in front of the Grand Stand . A roar like the roar of the sea broke up from the thronged course as the crowd hung breathless on the even race ; ten thousand shouts rang as thrice ten thousand eyes watched the closing contest , as superb a sight as the Shires ever saw while the two ran together , the gigantic chesnut , with every massive sinew swelled and strained to tension , side by side with the marvellous grace , the shining flanks , and the Arab - like head of the Guards ' horse . Louder and wilder the shrieked tumult rose : "

20249	20494	20671	20672	The Guards	1130	" Sent along at a pace that Epsom flat never eclipsed , sweeping by the Grand Stand like the flash of electric flame , they ran side to side one moment more , their foam flung on each other 's withers , their breath hot in each other 's nostrils , while the dark earth flew beneath their stride . The blackthorn was in front behind five bars of solid oak , the water yawning on its farther side , black and deep , and fenced , twelve feet wide if it were an inch , with the same thorn wall beyond it ; a leap no horse should have been given , no Steward should have set . Cecil pressed his knees closer and closer , and worked the gallant hero for the test ; the surging roar of the throng , though so close , was dull on his ear ; he heard nothing , knew nothing , saw nothing but that lean chesnut head beside him , the dull thud on the turf of the flying gallop , and the black wall that reared in his face . Forest King had done so much , could he have stay and strength for this ? Cecil 's hands clenched unconsciously on the bridle , and his face was very pale — pale with excitation — as his foot where the stirrup was broken crushed closer and harder against the grey 's flank . "
20505	20670	20675	20676	the Guards	1130	" One touch of the spur — the first — and Forest King rose at the leap , all the life and power there were in him gathered for one superhuman and crowning effort ; a flash of time , not half a second in duration , and he was lifted in the air higher , and higher , and higher in the cold , fresh , wild winter wind ; stakes and rails and thorn and water lay beneath him black and gaunt and shapeless , yawning like a grave ; one bound , even in mid - air , one last convulsive impulse of the gathered limbs , and Forest King was over ! And as he galloped up the straight run - in he was alone . Bay Regent had refused the leap . As the grey swept to the Judge 's chair , the air was rent with deafening cheers that seemed to reel like drunken shouts from the multitude . "
20677	20704	20675	20676	the Guards	1130	win;"—and when his rider pulled up at the distance with the full sun shining on the scarlet and white , with the gold glisten of the embroidered "
20711	20809	20825	20825	I	0	" Forest King stood in all his glory , winner of the Soldiers ' Blue Riband , by a feat without its parallel in all the annals of the Gold Vase . But as the crowd surged about him , and the mad cheering crowned his victory , and the Household in the splendour of their triumph and the fulness of their gratitude rushed from the drags and the stands to cluster to his saddle , Bertie looked as serenely and listlessly nonchalant as of old , while he nodded to the Seraph with a gentle smile . "
20831	21084	20825	20825	I	0	" Outsiders would much sooner have thought him defeated than triumphant ; no one , who had not known him , could possibly have imagined that he had been successful ; an ordinary spectator would have concluded that , judging by the resigned weariness of his features , he had won the race greatly against his own will to his now infinite ennui . No one could have dreamt that he was thinking in his heart of hearts how passionately he loved the gallant beast that had been victor with him , and that , if he had followed out the momentary impulse in him , he could have put his arms round the noble bowed neck and kissed the horse like a woman ! The Moselle Cup was brought to refresh the tired champion , and before he drank it Bertie glanced at a certain place in the Grand Stand and bent his head as the cup touched his lips : it was a dedication of his victory to his Queen of Beauty . Then he threw himself lightly out of saddle , and , as Forest King was led away for the after ceremony of bottling , rubbing , and clothing , his rider , regardless of the roar and hubbub of the course , and of the tumultuous cheers that welcomed both him and his horse from the men who pressed round him , into whose pockets he had put thousands on thousands , and whose ringing hurrahs greeted the "
21089	21102	21252	21253	the Guards	1130	" passed straight up towards Jimmy Delmar and held out his hand . "
21148	21227	21230	21230	I	0	" The browned Indian - sunned face of the Lancer broke up into a cordial smile , and he shook the hand held out to him warmly ; defeat and disappointment had cut him to the core , for Jimmy was the first riding man of the Light Cavalry , but he would not have been the frank campaigner that he was if he had not responded to the graceful and generous overture of his rival and conqueror . "
21236	21243	21277	21277	I	0	" he said , good humouredly ; "
21286	21339	21277	21277	I	0	" And he meant it , too . Jimmy never canted , nor did he ever throw the blame , with paltry savage vindictiveness , on the horse he had ridden . Some men there are — their name is legion — who never allow that it is their fault when they are "
21340	21346	21277	21277	I	0	nowhere;"—oh no ! it is the "
21349	21465	21277	21277	I	0	" always , according to them . But a very good rider will not tell you that . Cecil , while he talked , was glancing up at the Grand Stand , and when the others dispersed to look over the horses , and he had put himself out of his shell into his sealskin in the dressing - shed , he went up thither without a moment 's loss of time . He knew them all ; those dainty beauties with their delicate cheeks just brightened by the western winterly wind , and their rich furs and laces glowing among the colours of their respective heroes ; he was the pet of them all ; "
21467	21656	21277	21277	I	0	" had the suffrages of the sex without exception ; he was received with bright smiles and graceful congratulations , even from those who had espoused Eyre Montacute 's cause , and still fluttered their losing azure , though the poor hunter lay dead , with his back broken , and a pistolball mercifully sent through his brains — the martyr to a man 's hot haste , as the dumb things have ever been since creation began . Cecil passed them as rapidly as he could for one so well received by them , and made his way to the centre of the Stand , to the same spot at which he had glanced when he had drunk the Moselle . A lady turned to him ; she looked like a rose camellia in her floating scarlet and white , just toned down and made perfect by a shower of Spanish lace ; a beautiful brunette , dashing yet delicate , a little fast yet intensely thorough - bred , a coquette who would smoke a cigarette , yet a peeress who would never lose her dignity . "
21663	21695	21705	21705	you	1593	" she said , with an envoi of her lorgnon , and a smile that should have intoxicated him — a smile that might have rewarded a Richepanse for a Hohenlinden . "
21718	21820	21983	21985	a preux chevalier	1595	" It was terrible ; and a woman , to say nothing of a woman who was in love with him , might well have felt a heart - sick fear at sight of that yawning water and those towering walls of blackthorn , where one touch of the hoofs on the topmost bough , one spring too short of the gathered limbs , must have been death to both horse and rider . But as she said it , she was smiling , radiant , full of easy calm and racing interest , as became her ladyship , who had had "
21824	21903	21925	21925	you	1593	" before now on Goodwood , and could lead the first flight over the Belvoir and the Quorn countries . It was possible that her ladyship was too thoroughbred not to see a man killed over the oak - rails without deviating into unseemly emotion , or being capable of such bad style as to be agitated . Bertie , however , in answer , threw the tenderest eloquence into his eyes ; very learned in such eloquence . "
21928	21981	21983	21985	a preux chevalier	1595	" She laughed a little , so did he ; they were used to exchange these passages in an admirably artistic masquerade , but it was always a little droll to each of them to see the other wear the domino of sentiment , and neither had much credence in the other . "
21987	21994	22113	22113	you	409	" cried his Queen of Beauty . "
22056	22057	22078	22078	You	409	" "
22071	22077	22247	22247	somebody	6164	" replied Cecil , musingly . "
22167	22168	22199	22199	Beauty	409	" "
22180	22198	22247	22247	somebody	6164	" said her ladyship , with the lowest , most languid laugh in the world , very like "
22201	22231	22256	22256	I	0	" own , save that it had a considerable inflection of studied affectation , of which he , however much of a dandy he was , was wholly guiltless . "
22268	22269	22524	22524	he	1605	" "
22307	22396	22488	22496	the Welsher , " who had watched the finish	6427	" murmured Cecil with the softest tenderness , but just enough laziness in the tone and laughter in the eye to make it highly doubtful whether he was not laughing both at her and at himself , and was not wondering why the deuce a fellow had to talk such nonsense . Yet she was Lady Guenevere , with whom he had been in love ever since they had stayed together at Belvoir for the Croxton Park week last autumn ; and who was beautiful enough to make their "
22398	22407	22488	22496	the Welsher , " who had watched the finish	6427	" as enchanting as a page out of the "
22410	22487	22488	22496	the Welsher , " who had watched the finish	6427	" And while he bent over her , flirting in the fashion that made him the darling of the drawing - rooms , and looking down into her superb Velasquez eyes , he did not know , and , if he had known , would have been careless of it , that afar off , white with rage , and with his gaze straining on to the course through his race - glass , Ben Davis , "
22491	22500	22520	22520	He	1605	" who had watched the finish — watched the "
22504	22519	22582	22583	little ladies	1606	" landed at the distance — muttered , with a mastiff 's savage growl : "
22541	22581	22582	22583	little ladies	1606	" Life was very pleasant at Royallieu . It lay in the Melton country , and was almost equally well placed for Pytchley , Quorn , and - Belvoir , besides possessing its own small but very perfect pack of "
22585	22588	22582	22583	little ladies	1606	" or the "
22591	23173	22582	22583	little ladies	1606	" as they were severally nicknamed ; the game was closely preserved , pheasants were fed on Indian corn till they were the finest birds in the country , and in the little winding paths of the elder and bilberry coverts thirty first - rate shots , with two loading - men to each , could find flock and feather to amuse them till dinner , with rocketers and warm corners enough to content the most insatiate of knickerbockered gunners . The stud was superb ; the cook a French artist of consummate genius , who had a brougham to his own use , and wore diamonds of the first water ; on the broad beech - studded grassy lands no lesser thing than doe and deer ever swept through the thick ferns in the sunlight and the shadow ; a retinue of powdered servants filled the old halls , and guests of highest degree dined in its stately banqueting - room , with its scarlet and gold , its Vandykes and its Vernets , and yet — there was terribly little money at Royallieu with it all . Its present luxury was purchased at the cost of the future , and the parasite of extravagance was constantly sapping , unseen , the gallant old Norman - planted oak of the family - tree . But then who thought of that ? Nobody . It was the way of the House never to take count of the morrow . True , any one of them would have died a hundred deaths rather than have had one acre of the beautiful green diadem of woods felled by the axe of the timber contractor , or passed to the hands of a stranger ; but no one among them ever thought that this was the inevitable end to which they surely drifted with blind and unthinking improvidence . The old Viscount , haughtiest of haughty nobles , would never abate one jot of his accustomed magnificence ; and his sons had but imbibed the teaching of all that surrounded them ; they did but do in manhood what they had been unconsciously moulded to do in boyhood , when they were sent to Eton at ten , with gold dressing - boxes to grace their Dame 's tables , embryo - Dukes for their co - fags , and tastes that already knew to a nicety the worth of the champagnes at the Christopher . The old , old story — how it repeats itself ! Boys grow up amidst profuse prodigality , and are launched into a world where they can no more arrest themselves , than the feather - weight can pull in the lightning - stride of the two - year old , who defies all check , and takes the flat as he chooses . They are brought up like young Dauphins and tossed into the costly whirl to float as best they can — on nothing . Then , on the lives and deaths that follow ; on the graves where a dishonoured alien lies forgotten by the dark Austrian lake - side , or under the monastic shadow of some crumbling Spanish crypt ; where a red cross chills the lonely traveller in the virgin solitudes of Amazonian forest aisles , or the wild scarlet creepers of Australia trail over a nameless mound above the trackless stretch of sun - warmed waters — then at them the world "
23181	23259	23261	23261	Berke	500	" Not on them lies the blame . A wintry , watery sun was shining on the terraces as Lord Royallieu paced up and down the morning after the Grand Military ; his step and limbs excessively enfeebled , but the carriage of his head and the flash of his dark hawk 's eyes as proud and untameable as in his earliest years . He never left his own apartments ; and no one , save his favourite "
23263	23346	23261	23261	Berke	500	" ever went to him without his desire ; he was too sensitive a man to thrust his age and ailing health in amongst the young leaders of fashion , the wild men of pleasure , the good wits and the good shots of his son 's set ; he knew very well that his own day was past , that they would have listened to him out of the patience of courtesy , but that they would have wished him away as "
23353	23398	23749	23749	Bertie	518	" He was too shrewd not to know this ; but he was too quickly galled ever to bear to have it recalled to him . He looked up suddenly and sharply ; coming towards him he saw the figure of the Guardsman . For "
23400	23748	24174	24174	Royal	1608	" the Viscount had no love ; indeed , well - nigh a hatred , for a reason never guessed by others , and never betrayed by him . Bertie was not like the Royallieu race ; he resembled his mother 's family . She , a beautiful and fragile creature whom her second son had loved , for the first years of his life , as he would have thought it now impossible that he could love any one , had married the Viscount with no affection towards him , while he had adored her with a fierce and jealous passion that her indifference only inflamed . Throughout her married life , however , she had striven to render loyalty and tenderness towards a lord into whose arms she had been thrown , trembling and reluctant ; of his wife 's fidelity he could not entertain a doubt , though that he had never won her heart he could not choose but know . He knew more , too ; for she had told it him with a noble candour before he wedded her ; knew that the man she did love was a penniless cousin , a cavalry officer , who had made a famous name among the wild mountain tribes of Northern India . This cousin , Alan Bertie — a fearless and chivalrous soldier , fitter for the days of knighthood than for these — had seen Lady Royallieu at Nice , some three years after her marriage ; accident had thrown them across each other 's path ; the old love , stronger , perhaps , now than it had ever been , had made him linger in her presence , had made her shrink from sending him to exile . Evil tongues at last had united their names together ; Alan Bertie had left the woman he idolised lest slander should touch her through him , and fallen two years later under the dark dank forests on the desolate moorside of the hills of Hindostan , where long before he had rendered "
23752	24173	24229	24229	You	1609	" the most famous of all the wild Irregulars of the East . After her death , Lord Royallieu found Alan 's miniature among her papers , and recalled those winter months by the Mediterranean till he cherished , with the fierce , eager , self - torture of a jealous nature , doubts and suspicions that , during her life , one glance from her eyes would have disarmed and abashed . Her second and favourite child bore her family name , her late lover 's name ; and , in resembling her race , resembled the dead soldier . Moreover , Bertie had been born in the spring following that Nice winter , and it sufficed to make the Viscount hate him with a cruel and savage detestation which he strove indeed to temper,—for he was by nature a just man , and , in his better moments , knew that his doubts wronged both the living and the dead,—but which coloured , too strongly to be dissembled , all his feelings and his actions towards his son , and might both have soured and wounded any temperament less nonchalantly gentle and supremely careless than Cecil 's . As it was , Cecil was sometimes surprised at his father 's dislike to him ; but never thought much about it , and attributed it , when he did think of it , to the caprices of a tyrannous old man . To be envious of the favour shown to his boyish brother could never for a moment have come into his imagination . Lady Royallieu , with her last words , had left the little fellow , a child of three years old , to the affection and the care of Bertie — himself then a boy of twelve or fourteen — and little as he thought of such things now , the trust of his dying mother had never been wholly forgotten . A heavy gloom came now over the Viscount 's still handsome saturnine aquiline face as his second son approached up the terrace ; Bertie was too like the cavalry soldier whose form he had last seen standing against the rose light of a Mediterranean sunset . The soldier had been dead eight - and - twenty years ; but the jealous hate was not dead yet . Cecil took off his hunting - cap with a certain courtesy that sat very well on his habitual languid nonchalance ; he never called his father anything but "
24176	24228	24229	24229	You	1609	" rarely saw , still less rarely consulted him , and cared not a straw for his censure or opinion , but he was too thorough - bred by nature to be able to follow the under - bred indecorum of the day which makes disrespect to old age the fashion . "
24234	24246	24260	24260	I	0	" he asked , taking the cigarette out of his mouth . "
24251	24259	24266	24267	The fools	1612	" answered the old Lord , curtly , "
24280	24281	24266	24267	The fools	1612	" "
24297	24298	24310	24310	you	6134	" "
24312	24324	24345	24345	We	1613	" answered his father , sharply ; the subject irritated him . "
24332	24344	24380	24380	sir	6134	" murmured Cecil , with an expostulatory wave of his cigar . "
24382	24420	24422	24422	you	0	" He turned to move away to the house ; but his father stopped him ; he knew that he had been discourteous , a far worse crime in Lord Royallieu 's eyes than to be heartless . "
24428	24451	24454	24454	King	1618	" he asked , pausing in his walk with his back bowed , but his stern , silver - haired head erect . "
24457	24458	24454	24454	King	1618	" "
24465	24478	24422	24422	you	0	" said the Viscount , in his resonant and yet melodious voice . "
24517	24518	24543	24543	I	0	" "
24536	24542	24610	24610	You	0	" Lord Royallieu smiled grimly . "
24554	24609	24610	24610	You	0	" he said , with a flash of his falcon eyes over the landscape , where , in the days of his youth , he had led the first flight so often , George Rex , and Waterford , and the Berkeleys , and the rest following the rally of his hunting - horn . "
24616	24617	24610	24610	You	0	" "
24623	24624	24675	24675	You	0	" "
24639	24674	24692	24692	I	0	" retorted the Viscount , with a rasping , grating irony ; he could not help darting savage thrusts at this man who looked at him with eyes so cruelly like Alan Bertie 's . "
24710	24711	24731	24731	We	1625	" "
24738	24762	24801	24801	they	1630	" said Cecil , with gentle weariness ; the sweetness of his temper was proof against his father 's attacks upon his patience . "
24785	24786	24846	24846	You	0	" "
24827	24845	24846	24846	You	0	" murmured Bertie , whose impenetrable serenity was never to be ruffled by his father 's bitterness . "
24855	24884	25041	25042	a Guardsman	1349	" retorted the Viscount , with the unprovoked and reasonless passion which he vented on every one , but on none so much as the son he hated . "
25044	25132	25041	25042	a Guardsman	1349	" The coarse and cruel irony flashed out with wicked scorching malignity , lashing and upbraiding the man who was the victim of his own unwisdom and extravagance . A slight tinge of colour came on his son 's face as he heard ; but he gave no sign that he was moved , no sign of impatience or anger . He lifted his cap again , not in irony , but with a grave respect in his action that was totally contrary to his whole temperament . "
25145	25155	25199	25199	Royal	450	" he said , with his accustomed gentle murmur . "
25166	25198	25379	25379	Royal	450	" And he went without another word . Crossing the length of the old - fashioned Elizabethan terrace , little Berk passed him ; he motioned the lad towards the Viscount . "
25208	25378	25391	25392	the deuce	6422	" The boy nodded and went onward ; and as Bertie turned to enter the low door that led out to the stables he saw his father meet the lad — meet him with a smile that changed the whole character of his face , and pleasant kindly words of affectionate welcome , drawing his arm about Berkeley 's shoulder , and looking with pride upon his bright and gracious youth . More than an old man 's preference would be thus won by the young one ; a considerable portion of their mother 's fortune , so left that it could not be dissipated , yet could be willed to which son the Viscount chose , would go to his brother by this passionate partiality ; but there was not a tinge of jealousy in Cecil ; whatever else his faults he had no mean ones , and the boy was dear to him , by a quite unconscious yet unvarying obedience to his dead mother 's wish . "
25397	25420	25457	25457	Beauty	409	" he thought , with a certain slight touch of pain despite his idle philosophies and devil - may - care indifference . "
25448	25456	25457	25457	Beauty	409	" With which summary of his merits , "
25459	25517	25518	25518	Royal	1608	" who felt himself to be a master in those two arts , but thought himself a bad fellow out of them , sauntered away to join the Seraph and the rest of his guests . His father 's words pursuing him a little despite his carelessness , for they had borne an unwelcome measure of truth . "
25523	25528	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" his thoughts continued . "
25610	25697	25592	25592	they	1655	" And Bertie , whom his gains the day before had not much benefited , since his play - debts , his young brother 's needs , and the Zu - Zu 's insatiate little hands were all stretched ready to devour them without leaving a sovereign for more serious liabilities , went , for it was quite early morning , to act the M. F. H. in his father 's stead , at the meet on the great lawns before the house , for the Royallieu "
25701	25754	25592	25592	they	1655	" were very famous in the Shires , and hunted over the same country alternate days with the Quorn . They moved off ere long to draw the Holt Wood , in as open a morning , and as strong a scenting wind , as ever favoured Melton Pink . A whimper and "
25758	25922	25592	25592	they	1655	" soon echoed from Beeby - side , and the pack , not letting the fox hang a second , dashed after him , making straight for Scraptoft . One of the fastest things up wind that hounds ever ran took them straight through the Spinnies , past Hamilton Farm , away beyond Burkby village , and down into the valley of the Wreake without a check , where he broke away , was headed , tried earths , and was pulled down scarce forty minutes from the find . The pack then drew Hungerton foxholes blank , drew Carver 's spinnies without a whimper ; and lastly , drawing the old familiar Billesden Coplow , had a short quick burst with a brace of cubs , and returning , settled themselves to a fine dog fox that was raced an hour and half , hunted slowly for fifty minutes , raced again another hour and quarter , sending all the field to their "
25926	25960	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" and , after a clipping chase through the cream of the grass country , nearly saved his brush in the twilight when scent was lost in a rushing hailstorm , but had the "
25963	25975	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" laid on again like wildfire , and was killed with the "
25980	26042	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" ringing far and away over Glenn Gorse , after a glorious run — thirty miles in and out — with pace that tried the best of them . A better day 's sport even the Quorn had never had in all its brilliant annals , and faster things the Melton men themselves had never wanted : both those who love the "
26059	26067	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" and care little whether the finale be "
26069	26071	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" or "
26075	26084	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" and those of older fashion , who prefer "
26132	26138	25603	25605	the deuce else	1659	" but must have the fatal "
26142	26151	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" as conclusion — both of these , the "
26158	26640	26785	26786	a Guardsman	1349	" could not but be content with the doings of the Demoiselles from start to finish . Was it likely that Bertie remembered the caustic lash of his father 's ironies while he was lifting Mother of Pearl over the posts and rails , and sweeping on , with the halloo ringing down the wintry wind as the grasslands flew beneath him ? Was it likely that he recollected the difficulties that hung above him while he was dashing down the Gorse happy as a king , with the wild hail driving in his face , and a break of stormy sunshine just welcoming the gallant few who were landed at the death as twilight fell ? Was it likely that he could unlearn all the lessons of his life , and realise in how near a neighbourhood he stood to ruin , when he was drinking Regency sherry out of his gold flask as he crossed the saddle of his second horse , or , smoking , rode slowly homeward , chatting with the Seraph through the leafless muddy lanes in the gloaming . Scarcely;—it is very easy to remember our difficulties when we are eating and drinking them , so to speak , in bad soups and worse wines in continental impecuniosity , sleeping on them as rough Australian shake - downs , or wearing them perpetually in Californian rags and tatters , it were impossible very well to escape from them then ; but it is very hard to remember them when every touch and shape of life is pleasant to us — when everything about us is symbolical and redolent of wealth and ease — when the art of enjoyment is the only one we are called on to study , and the science of pleasure all we are asked to explore . It is well - nigh impossible to believe yourself a beggar while you never want sovereigns for whist ; and it would be beyond the powers of human nature to conceive your ruin irrevocable , while you still eat turbot and terrapin with a powdered giant behind your chair daily . Up in his garret a poor wretch knows very well what he is , and realises in stern fact the extremities of the last sou , the last shirt , and the last hope ; but in these devil - may - care pleasures — in this pleasant , reckless , velvet - soft rush down - hill — in this club - palace , with every luxury that the heart of man can devise and desire , yours to command at your will — it is hard work , then , to grasp the truth that the crossing - sweeper yonder , in the dust of Pall Mall , is really not more utterly in the toils of poverty than you are ! "
26642	26782	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" was never , in the whole course of his days , virtually or physically , or even metaphorically , reminded that he was not a millionaire ; much less still was he ever reminded so painfully . Life petted him , pampered him , caressed him , gifted him , though of half his gifts he never made use ; lodged him like a prince , dined him like a king , and never recalled to him by a single privation or a single sensation that he was not as rich a man as his brother - in - arms , the Seraph , future Duke of Lyonnesse . How could he then bring himself to understand , as nothing less than truth , the grim and cruel insult his father had flung at him in that brutally bitter phrase—"A
26787	26969	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" ? If he had ever been near a comprehension of it , which he never was , he must have ceased to realise it when — pressed to dine with Lord Guenevere , near whose house the last fox had been killed , while grooms dashed over to Royallieu for their changes of clothes — he caught a glimpse , as they passed through the hall , of the ladies taking their pre - prandial cups of tea in the library , an enchanting group of lace and silks , of delicate hue and scented hair , of blonde cheeks and brunette tresses , of dark velvets and gossamer tissue ; and when he had changed the scarlet for dinner - dress , went down amongst them to be the darling of that charmed circle , to be smiled on and coquetted with by those soft , languid aristocrats , to be challenged by the lustrous eyes of his châtelaine , and to be spoiled as women will spoil the privileged pet of their drawing - rooms whom they have made "
26975	26987	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" and endowed with a flirting commission , and acquitted of anything "
26990	27409	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" He was the recognised darling , and permitted property , of the young married beauties ; the unwedded knew he was hopeless for them , and tacitly left him to the more attractive conquerors ; who hardly prized the Seraph so much as they did Bertie , to sit in their barouches and opera boxes , ride and drive and yacht with them , conduct a Boccaccio intrigue through the height of the season , and make them really believe themselves actually in love while they were at the Moors or down the Nile , and would have given their diamonds to get a new distraction . Lady Guenevere was the last of these , his titled and wedded captors ; and perhaps the most resistless of all of them . Neither of them believed very much in their attachment , but both of them wore the masquerade dress to perfection . He had fallen in love with her as much as he ever fell in love , which was just sufficient to amuse him , and never enough to disturb him . He let himself be fascinated , not exerting himself either to resist or to advance the affair , till he was , perhaps , a little more entangled with her than it was according to his canons expedient to be ; and they had the most enchanting — friendship . Nobody was ever so indiscreet as to call it anything else ; and my Lord was too deeply absorbed in the Alderney beauties that stood knee - deep in the yellow straw of his farm - yard , and the triumphant conquests that he gained over his brother Peers ' Short - horns and Suffolks , to trouble his head about Cecil 's attendance on his beautiful Countess . They corresponded in Spanish ; they had a thousand charming cyphers ; they made the columns of the Times and the Post play the unconscious rôle of medium to appointments ; they eclipsed all the pages of Calderon 's or Congreve 's comedies in the ingenuities with which they met , wrote , got invitations together to the same country - houses , and arranged signals for mute communication : but there was not the slightest occasion for it all . It passed the time , however , and went far to persuade them that they really were in love , and had a mountain of difficulties and dangers to contend with ; it added the "
27415	27420	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" and gave them the "
27426	27463	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" Besides , an open scandal would have been very shocking to her brilliant ladyship , and there was nothing on earth , perhaps , of which he would have had a more lively dread than a "
27466	27469	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" his present "
27472	27487	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" however , was delightful , and presented no such dangers , while his fair "
27489	28160	26641	26641	Beauty	409	" was one of the greatest beauties and the greatest coquettes of her time . Her smile was honour ; her fan was a sceptre ; her face was perfect ; and her heart never troubled herself or her lovers : if she had a fault , she was a trifle exacting , but that was not to be wondered at in one so omnipotent , and her chains , after all , were made of roses . As she sat in the deep ruddy glow of the library fire , with the light flickering on her white brow and her violet velvets ; as she floated to the head of her table , with opals shining amongst her priceless point laces , and some tropical flower with leaves of glistening gold crowning her bronze hair ; as she glided down in a waltz along the polished floor , or bent her proud head over écarté in a musing grace that made her opponent utterly forget to mark the king or even play his cards at all ; as she talked in the low music of her voice of European imbrogli , and consols and coupons , for she was a politician and a speculator ; when she lapsed into a beautifully - tinted study of la femme incomprise , when time and scene suited , when the stars were very clear above the terraces without , and the conservatory very solitary , and a touch of Musset or Owen Meredith chimed in well with the light and shade of the oleanders and the brown lustre of her own eloquent glance;—in all these various moments how superb she was ! And if in truth her bosom only fell with the falling of Shares and rose with the rising of Bonds , if her soft shadows were only taken up like the purple tinting under her lashes to embellish her beauty ; if in her heart of hearts she thought Musset a fool , and wondered why Lucille was not written in prose , in her soul far preferring Le Follet ; why — it did not matter , that I can see ; all great ladies gamble in stock now - a - days under the rose ; and women are for the most part as cold , clear , hard , and practical as their adorers believe them the contrary ; and a femme incomprise is so charming when she avows herself comprehended by you , that you would never risk spoiling the confidence by hinting a doubt of its truth . If she and Bertie only played at love , if neither believed much in the other , if each trifled with a pretty gossamer soufflet of passion much as they trifled with their soufflets at dinner , if both tried it to trifle away ennui much as they tried staking a Friedrich d'Or at Baden , this light , surface , fashionable , philosophic form of a passion they both laughed at in its hot and serious follies , suited them admirably . Had it ever mingled a grain of bitterness in her ladyship 's Souchong before dinner , or given an aroma of bitterness to her lover 's Naples punch in the smoking - room , it would have been out of all keeping with themselves and their world . Nothing on earth is so pleasant as being a little in love ; nothing on earth so destructive as being too much so ; and as Cecil , in the idle enjoyment of the former gentle luxury , flirted with his liege lady that night , lying back in the softest of lounging - chairs , with his dark dreamy handsome eyes looking all the eloquence in the world , and his head drooped till his moustaches were almost touching her laces , his Queen of Beauty listened with charmed interest , and to judge by his attitude he might have been praying after the poet — "
28174	28183	28485	28485	purlers	1667	" In real truth he was gently murmuring , "
28301	28484	28485	28485	purlers	1667	" Cecil could , when needed , do the Musset and Meredith style of thing to perfection , but on the whole he preferred love à la mode ; it is so much easier and less exhausting to tell your mistress of a ringing run , or a close finish , than to turn perpetual periods on the lustre of her eyes , and the eternity of your devotion . Nor did it at all interfere with the sincerity of his worship , that the Zu - Zu was at the prettiest little box in the world , in the neighbourhood of Market Harborough , which he had taken for her , and had been at the meet that day in her little toy trap ( with its pair of snowy ponies and its bright blue liveries , that drove so desperately through his finances ) , and had ridden his hunter Maraschino with immense dash and spirit for a young lady , who had never done anything but pirouette till the last six months , and a total and headlong disregard of "
28487	28692	28702	28703	a team	1669	" very reckless in a white - skinned bright - eyed illiterate avaricious little beauty , whose face was her fortune , and who most assuredly would have been adored no single moment longer had she scarred her fair tinted cheek with the blackthorn , or started as a heroine with a broken nose like Fielding 's cherished Amelia . The Zu - Zu might rage , might sulk , might pout , might even swear all sorts of naughty Mabille oaths , most villanously pronounced , at the ascendancy of her haughty unapproachable patrician rival ; she did do all these things ; but Bertie would not have been the consummate tactician , the perfect flirt , the skilled and steeled campaigner in the boudoirs that he was , if he had not been equal to the delicate task of managing both the Peeress and the Ballet - dancer with inimitable ability , even when they placed him in the seemingly difficult dilemma of meeting them both with twenty yards between them on the neutral ground of the gathering to see the Pytchley or the Tailby throw off — a task he had achieved with victorious brilliance more than once already this season . "
28705	28715	28702	28703	a team	1669	" the Seraph had said on occasion over a confidential "
28719	28749	28861	28861	you	1668	" in the mornings , meaning by the metaphor of a team , Lady Guenevere , the Zu - Zu , and various other contemporaries in Bertie 's affections . "
28866	28884	29019	29019	You	1668	" To which salutary advice Cecil only gave a laugh , going on his own ways with the "
28886	29018	29019	29019	You	1668	" as before , to the despair of his fidus Achates ; the Seraph , being a quarry so incessantly pursued by dowager - beaters , chaperone - keepers , and the whole hunt of the Matrimonial Pack , with those clever hounds Belle and Fashion ever leading in full cry after him , that he dreaded the sight of a ball - room meet ; and , shunning the rich preserves of the Salons , ran to earth persistently in the shady woods of St. John 's , and got — at some little cost and some risk of trapping , it is true , but still efficiently — preserved from all other hunters or poachers by the lawless Robin Hoods aux yeux noirs of those welcome and familiar coverts . "
29030	29074	29304	29304	nobody	6207	" cried Mr. Rake , enthusiastically , surveying the hero of the Grand Military with adoring eyes as that celebrity , without a hair turned or a muscle swollen from his exploit , was having a dressing - down after a gentle exercise . "
29151	29166	29304	29304	nobody	6207	" And Rake gazed with worship at the symmetrical limbs of the champion of the "
29170	29256	29304	29304	nobody	6207	" and plunged into speculation on the democratic tendencies of the age as clearly contradicted by all the evidences of the flat and furrow , while Forest King drank a dozen go - downs of water , and was rewarded for the patience with which he had subdued his inclination to kick , fret , spring , and break away throughout the dressing by a full feed thrown into his crib , which Rake watched him with adoring gaze eat to the very last grain . "
29261	29282	29381	29381	they	1692	" soliloquised that philosopher , who loved the horse with a sort of passion since his victory over the Shires . "
29387	29401	29381	29381	they	1692	" And Rake , rendered almost melancholy by his thoughts ( he liked the "
29403	29689	29381	29381	they	1692	" himself ) , went out of the box to get into saddle and ride off on an errand of his master 's to the Zu - Zu at her tiny hunting - lodge , where the snow - white ponies made her stud , and where she gave enchanting little hunting - dinners , at which she sang equally enchanting little hunting - songs , and arrayed herself in the Fontainebleau hunting - costume , gold - hilted knife and all , and spent Cecil 's winnings for him with a rapidity that threatened to leave very few of them for the London season . She was very pretty ; sweetly pretty ; with fair hair that wanted no gold powder , the clearest , sauciest eyes , and the handsomest mouth in the world ; but of grammar she had not a notion , of her aspirates she had never a recollection , of conversation she had not an idea , of slang she had , to be sure , a répertoire , but to this was her command of language limited . She dressed perfectly , but she was a vulgar little soul ; drank everything , from Bass 's ale to rum - punch , and from cherry - brandy to absinthe ; thought it the height of wit to stifle you with cayenne slid into your vanille ice , and the climax of repartee to cram your hat full of peach - stones and lobster - shells ; was thoroughly avaricious , thoroughly insatiate , thoroughly heartless , pillaged with both hands and then never had enough ; had a coarse good nature when it cost her nothing , and was "
29696	29755	29381	29381	they	1692	" according to her phraseology , so long as she could stew her pigeons in champagne , drink wines and liqueurs that were beyond price , take the most dashing trap in the Park up to Flirtation Corner , and laugh and sing and eat Richmond dinners , and show herself at the Opera with Bertie or some other "
29757	29856	29381	29381	they	1692	" attached to her , in the very box next to a Duchess . The Zu - Zu was perfectly happy ; and as for the pathetic pictures that novelists and moralists draw , of vice sighing amidst turtle and truffles for childish innocence in the cottage at home where honeysuckles blossomed and brown brooks made melody , and passionately grieving on the purple cushions of a barouche for the time of straw pallets and untroubled sleep , why,—the Zu - Zu would have vaulted herself on the box - seat of a drag , and told you to "
29862	30013	29381	29381	they	1692	" her childish recollections were of a stifling lean - to with the odour of pigsty and straw - yard , pork for a feast once a week , starvation all the other six days , kicks , slaps , wrangling , and a general atmosphere of beer and wash - tubs : she hated her past , and loved her cigar on the drag . The Zu - Zu is fact ; the moralists ' pictures are moonshine . The Zu - Zu is an openly acknowledged fact , moreover , daily becoming more prominent in the world , more brilliant , more frankly recognised , and more omnipotent . Whether this will ultimately prove for the better or the worse , it would be a bold man who should dare say ; there is at least one thing left to desire in it — i.e. that the synonyme of "
30016	30306	29381	29381	they	1692	" which serves so often to designate in journalistic literature these Free Lances of life , were more suitable in artistic and intellectual similarity , and that when the Zu - Zu and her co - brigands plunge their white arms elbow - deep into so many fortunes , and rule the world right and left as they do , they could also sound their H 's properly , and know a little orthography , if they could not be changed into such queens of grace , of intellect , of sovereign mind and splendid wit as were their prototypes when she whose name they debase held her rule in the City of the Violet Crown , and gathered about her Phidias the divine , haughty and eloquent Antipho , the gay Crates , the subtle Protagorus , Cratinus so acrid and yet so jovial , Damon of the silver lyre , and the great who are poets for all time . Author and artist , noble and soldier , court the Zu - Zu order now as the Athenians courted their brilliant έταιραι ; but it must be confessed that the Hellenic idols were of a more exalted type than are the Hyde Park goddesses ! However , the Zu - Zu was the rage , and spent Bertie 's money when he got any just as her wilful sovereignty fancied , and Rake rode on now with his master 's note , bearing no very good will to her ; for Rake had very strong prejudices , and none stronger than against these pillagers who went about seeking whom they should devour , and laughing at the wholesale ruin that they wrought , while the sentimentalists babbled in "
30309	30311	29381	29381	they	1692	" of "
30314	30316	30322	30337	A girl that used to eat tripe and red herring in a six - pair back	1695	" and "
30320	30321	30392	30392	she	1695	" "
30398	30502	30392	30392	she	1695	" averred Rake , in his eloquence ; and he was undoubtedly right for that matter , but then — the Zu - Zu was the rage , and if ever she should be sold up , great ladies would crowd to her sale , as they have done ere now to that of celebrities of her sisterhood , and buy with eager curiosity , at high prices , her most trumpery pots of pomatum , her most flimsy gewgaws of marqueterie ! Rake had seen a good deal of men and manners , and , in his own opinion at least , was "
30510	30971	30392	30392	she	1695	" that this iniquitous world could unfold . A bright , lithe , animated , vigorous , yellow - haired , and sturdy fellow , seemingly with a dash of the Celt in him that made him vivacious and peppery , Mr. Rake polished his wits quite as much as he polished the tops , and considered himself a philosopher . Of whose son he was he had not the remotest idea ; his earliest recollections were of the tender mercies of the workhouse ; but even that chill foster - mother , the parish , had not damped the liveliness of his temper or the independence of his opinions , and as soon as he was fifteen , Rake had run away and joined a circus , distinguishing himself there by his genius for standing on his head , and tying his limbs into a porter 's knot . From the circus he migrated successively into the shape of a comic singer , a tapster , a navvy , a bill - sticker , a guacho in Mexico ( working his passage out ) , a fireman in New York , a ventriloquist in Maryland , a vaquero in Spanish California , a lemonade - seller in San Francisco , a revolutionist in the Argentine ( without the most distant idea what he fought for ) , a boatman on the Bay of Mapiri , a blacksmith in Santarem , a trapper in the Wilderness , and finally , working his passage home again , took the Queen 's shilling in Dublin , and was drafted into a light cavalry regiment . With the — th he served half a dozen years in India , a rough - rider , a splendid fellow in a charge or a pursuit , with an astonishing power over horses , and the clearest backhanded sweep of a sabre that ever cut down a knot of natives ; but — insubordinate . Do his duty whenever fighting was in question , he did most zealously , but to kick over the traces at other times was a temptation that at last became too strong for that lawless lover of liberty . From the moment that he joined the regiment , a certain Corporal Warne and he had conceived an antipathy to one another , which Rake had to control as he might , and which the Corporal was not above indulging in every petty piece of tyranny that his rank allowed him to exercise . On active service Rake was , by instinct , too good a soldier not to manage to keep the curb on himself tolerably well , though he was always regarded in his troop rather as a hound that will "
30973	31010	30392	30392	she	1695	" is regarded in the pack ; but when the — th came back to Brighton and to barracks , the evil spirit of rebellion began to get a little hotter in him under the Corporal 's "
31013	31048	31070	31071	a fellow	6423	" of justifiable persecution . Warne indisputably provoked his man in a cold , iron , strictly lawful sort of manner , moreover , all the more irritating to a temper like Rake 's . "
31073	31104	31178	31178	I	0	" would Rake say in confidential moments over purl and a penn'orth of bird's - eye , his experience in the Argentine Republic having left him with strongly aristocratic prejudices ; "
31198	31236	31469	31470	the brute	1701	" With which Rake would blow the froth off his pewter with a puff of concentrated wrath , and an oath against his non - commissioned officers that might have let some light in upon the advocates for "
31241	31467	31481	31481	I	0	" had they been there to take the lesson . At last , in the leisure of Brighton , the storm broke . Rake had a Scotch hound that was the pride of his life , his beer - money often going instead to buy dainties for the dog , who became one of the channels through which Warne could annoy and thwart him . The dog did no harm , being a fine , well - bred deerhound ; but it pleased the Corporal to consider that it did , simply because it belonged to Rake , whose popularity in the corps , owing to his good nature , his good spirits , and his innumerable tales of American experiences and amorous adventures , increased the jealous dislike which his knack with an unbroken colt and his abundant stable science had first raised in his superior . One day in the chargers ' stables the hound ran out of a loose box with a rush to get at Rake , and upset a pailful of warm mash . The Corporal , who was standing by in harness , hit him over the head with a heavy whip he had in his hand ; infuriated by the pain , the dog flew at him , tearing his overalls with a fierce crunch of his teeth . "
31490	31545	31560	31560	I	0	" cried Warne to a couple of privates working near in their stable dress . Before the words were out of his mouth , Rake threw himself on him with a bound like lightning , and wrenching the whip out of his hand , struck him a slashing , stinging blow across the face . "
31573	31853	31932	31933	Poor devil	1705	" And assuredly he would have kept his word had he not been made a prisoner , and marched off to the guard - room . Rake learnt the stern necessity of the law , which , for the sake of morale , must make the soldiers , whose blood is wanted to be like fire on the field , patient , pulseless , and enduring of every provocation , cruelty , and insolence in the camp and the barrack , as though they were statues of stones,—a needful law , a wise law , an indispensable law , doubtless , but a very hard law to be obeyed by a man full of life and all life 's passions . At the court - martial on his mutinous conduct which followed , many witnesses brought evidence , on being pressed , to the unpopularity of Warne in the regiment , and to his harshness and his tyranny to Rake . Many men spoke out what had been chained down in their thoughts for years ; and , in consideration of the provocation received , the prisoner , who was much liked by the officers , was condemned to six months ' imprisonment for his insubordination and blow to his noncommissioned officer , without being tied up to the triangles . At the court - martial , Cecil , who chanced to be in Brighton after Goodwood , was present one day with some other Guardsmen , and the look of Rake , with his cheerfulness under difficulties , his love for the hound , and his bright , sunburnt , shrewd , humorous countenance , took his fancy . "
31855	31931	31963	31963	I	0	" was the essence of good nature . Indolent himself , he hated to see anything or anybody worried ; lazy , gentle , wayward , and spoilt by his own world , he was still never so selfish and philosophic as he pretended , but what he would do a kindness if one came in his way ; it is not a very great virtue , perhaps , but it is a rare one . "
31975	32006	32456	32456	My	0	" murmured Cecil to his cheroot , careless of the demoralising tendency of his remarks for the Army in general . Had it occurred in the Guards , and he had "
32008	32455	32456	32456	My	0	" on the case , Rake would have had one very lenient judge . As it was , Bertie actually went the lengths of thinking seriously about the matter ; he liked Rake 's devotion to his dumb friend , and he heard of his intense popularity in his troop ; he wished to save , if he could , so fine a fellow from the risks of his turbulent passion , and from the stern fetters of a trying discipline ; hence , when Rake found himself condemned to his cell , he had a message sent him by Bertie 's groom that when his term of punishment should be over Mr. Cecil would buy his discharge from the Service and engage him as extra body - servant , having had a good account of his capabilities : he had taken the hound to his own kennels . Now the fellow had been thoroughly devil - me - care throughout the whole course of the proceedings , had heard his sentence with sublime impudence , and had chaffed his sentinels with an utterly reckless nonchalance ; but somehow or other , when that message reached him , a vivid sense that he was a condemned and disgraced man suddenly flooded in on him ; a passionate gratitude seized him to the young aristocrat who had thought of him in his destitution and condemnation , who had even thought of his dog ; and Rake , the philosophic and the undauntable , could have found it in his heart to kneel down in the dust and kiss the stirrup - leather when he held it for his new master , so strong was the loyalty he bore from that moment to Bertie . Martinets were scandalised at a Life - Guardsman taking as his private valet a man who had been guilty of such conduct in the Light Cavalry ; but Cecil never troubled his head about what people said ; and so invaluable did Rake speedily become to him , that he had kept him about his person wherever he went from then until now , two years after . Rake loved his master with a fidelity very rare in these days ; he loved his horses , his dogs , everything that was his , down to his very rifle and boots , slaved for him cheerfully , and was as proud of the deer he stalked , of the brace he bagged , of his innings when the Household played the Zingari , or his victory when his yacht won the Cherbourg Cup , as though those successes had been Rake 's own . "
32460	32472	32529	32529	he	1707	" said Cecil himself once on this point to the Marquis , "
32542	32565	32753	32753	he	1707	" And Rake , who assuredly had been an out - and - out scamp , made good Bertie 's creed ; he "
32569	32750	32753	32753	he	1707	" devoutly , and no terrier was ever more alive to an otter than he was to the Guardsman 's interests . It was that very vigilance which made him , as he rode back from the Zu - Zu 's in the twilight , notice what would have escaped any save one who had been practised as a trapper in the red Canadian woods , namely , the head of a man almost hidden among the heavy though leafless brushwood and the yellow gorse of a spinney which lay on his left in Royallieu Park . Rake 's eyes were telescopic and microscopic ; moreover , they had been trained to know such little signs as a marsh from a hen harrier in full flight , by the length of wing and tail , and a widgeon or a coot from a mallard or a teal , by the depth each swam out of the water . Grey and foggy as it was , and high as was the gorse , Rake recognised his born - foe , Willon . "
32758	32786	32849	32849	he	1712	" thought Rake , surveying the place , which was wild , solitary , and an unlikely place enough for a head groom to be found in . "
32856	32963	32851	32851	his	1712	" It was certainly possible that Willon might be passing an idle hour in potting rabbits , or be otherwise innocently engaged enough ; but the sight of him there among the gorse was a sight of suspicion to Rake . Instantaneous thoughts darted through his mind of tethering his horse , and making a reconnaissance safely and unseen with the science at stalking brute or man that he had learnt of his friends the Sioux . But second thoughts showed him this was impossible . The horse he was on was a mere colt just breaking in , who had barely had so much as a "
32966	32981	33100	33100	You	0	" on his back , and stand for a second the colt would not . "
32991	33099	33130	33130	I	0	" mused Rake , with his latent animosity to the head groom , and his vigilant loyalty to Cecil overruling any scruple as to his right to overlook his foe 's movements ; and with a gallop that was muffled on the heather'd turf he dashed straight at the covert unperceived till he was within ten paces . Willon started and looked up hastily ; he was talking to a square - built man very quietly dressed in shepherds ' plaid , chiefly remarkable by a red - hued beard and whiskers . The groom turned pale and laughed nervously as Rake pulled up with a jerk . "
33128	33129	33130	33130	I	0	" "
33143	33158	33130	33130	I	0	" retorted Rake , scornfully ; boldness was not his enemy 's strong point . "
33167	33168	33130	33130	I	0	" "
33180	33200	33205	33207	a Yorkshire tyke	1719	" vouchsafed Mr. Willon , looking anything but easy , while the cousin aforesaid nodded sulkily on the introduction . "
33209	33224	33259	33259	his	1720	" muttered Rake , with a volume of meaning condensed in these innocent words . "
33269	33280	33259	33259	his	1720	" continued the ruthless inquisitor , with a glance at the "
33284	33368	33259	33259	his	1720	" by which they stood , in the middle of dank undergrowth , whose branches were adorned with dead cats , curs , owls , kestrels , stoats , weasels , and martens . To what issue the passage of arms might have come it is impossible to say , for at that moment the colt took matters into his own hands , and bolted with a rush , that even Rake could not pull in till he had had a mile - long "
33372	33373	33259	33259	his	1720	" "
33378	33386	33475	33476	Old Harry	553	" thought that sagacious rough - rider ; "
33479	33545	33475	33476	Old Harry	553	" And Rake rode into the stable - yard , thoughtful and intensely suspicious of the rendezvous under the keeper 's tree in the outlying coverts . He would have been more so had he guessed that Ben Davis 's red beard and demure attire , with other as efficient disguises , had prevented even his own keen eyes from penetrating the identity of Willon 's "
33547	33587	33475	33476	Old Harry	553	" with the Welsher he had seen thrust off the course the day before by his master . Is hardly to be denied by anybody in this land of fast bursts and gallant M. F. H. s , whether they "
33592	33594	33475	33476	Old Harry	553	" or "
33599	33775	33475	33476	Old Harry	553	" in the immortal distinction of Assheton Smith 's old whip : the latter class , by - the - by , becoming far and away the larger , in these days of rattling gallops and desperate breathers . Who cares to patter after a sly old dog - fox , that , fat and wary , leads the pack a tedious interminable wind in and out through gorse and spinney , bricks himself up in a drain , and takes an hour to be dug out , dodges about till twilight , and makes the hounds pick the scent slowly and wretchedly , over marsh and through water ? Who would not give fifty guineas a second for the glorious thirty minutes of racing that shows steam and steel over fence and fallow in a clipping rush without a check from find to finish ? So be it ever ! The riding that graces the Shires , that makes Tedworth and Pytchley , the Duke 's , and the Fitzwilliam 's , household words and "
33779	34045	34094	34095	Mr. Cecil	403	" that fills Melton and Market Harborough , and makes the best flirts of the ball - room gallop fifteen miles to covert , careless of hail or rain , mire or slush , mist or cold , so long as it is a fine scenting wind , is the same riding that sent the Six Hundred down into the blaze of the Muscovite guns , that in their fathers ' days gave to Grant 's Hussars their swoop , like eagles , on to the rear - guard at Morales , and that in the grand old East and the rich trackless West makes exiled campaigners with high English names seek and win an aristeia of their own at the head of their wild Irregular Horse , who would charge hell itself at their bidding . Now in all the Service there was not a man who loved hunting better than Bertie . Though he was incorrigibly lazy , and inconceivably effeminate in every one of his habits , though he suggested a portable lounging - chair as an improvement at battues so that you might shoot sitting , drove to every breakfast and garden party in the season in his brougham with the blinds down lest a grain of dust should touch him , thought a waltz too exhaustive , and a saunter down Pall Mall too tiring , and asked to have the end of a novel told him in the clubs because it was too much trouble to read on a warm day,—though he was more indolent than any spoiled Creole , "
34047	34093	34135	34135	I	0	" never failed to head the first flight , and adored a hard day cross country , with an east wind in his eyes , and the sleet in his teeth . The only trouble was to make him get up in time for it . "
34112	34134	34135	34135	I	0	" said Rake , with a dash of desperation for the seventh time into his chamber , one fine scenting morning . "
34140	34161	34162	34164	The other gentlemen	1732	" answered Cecil , sleepily , finishing his cup of coffee , and reading a novel of La Demirep 's . "
34178	34179	34218	34218	Beauty	409	" "
34190	34217	34220	34220	Beauty	409	" yawned Bertie . Crash came the Seraph 's thunder on the panels of the door , and a strong volume of Turkish through the keyhole : "
34226	34227	34220	34220	Beauty	409	" "
34235	34243	34263	34263	Seraph	454	" expostulated Cecil , with appealing rebuke . "
34265	34266	34263	34263	Seraph	454	" "
34270	34291	34333	34333	I	0	" cried the Seraph with a deafening rataplan , and a final dash of his colossal stature into the chamber . "
34315	34332	34345	34346	a marquis	1736	" Bertie lifted his eyes with plaintive resignation from the Demirep 's yellow - papered romance . "
34390	34398	34345	34346	a marquis	1736	" murmured Beauty , whom nothing could ever "
34401	34410	34345	34346	a marquis	1736	" not even plunging down the Matterhorn , losing "
34415	34451	34345	34346	a marquis	1736	" ' over the Oaks , or being sunned in the eyes of the fairest women of Europe . The Seraph laughed , and tossed the volume straight to the other end of the chamber . "
34460	34461	34465	34465	Seraph	454	" "
34472	34476	34512	34512	you	0	" yawned Cecil ; "
34521	34522	34523	34523	You	0	" "
34536	34541	34523	34523	You	0	" laughed the Seraph . "
34546	34547	34523	34523	You	0	" "
34550	34630	34523	34523	You	0	" sighed the victim , raising himself with reluctance , while the Seraph disappeared in a cloud of turkish . Neither Bertie 's indolence nor his insouciance were assumed ; utter carelessness was his nature , utter impassability was his habit , and he was truly for the moment loth to leave his bed , his coffee , and his novel ; he must have his leg over the saddle , and feel the strain on his arms of that "
34632	34905	34921	34923	a good fellow	1746	" pace with which the King always went when once he settled into his stride , before he would really think about winning . The hunting breakfasts of our forefathers and of our present squires found no favour with Bertie ; a slice of game and a glass of curacoa were all he kept the drag waiting to swallow , and the four bays going at a pelting pace , he and the rest of the Household who were gathered at Royallieu were by good luck in time for the throw - off of the Quorn , where the hero of the Blue Riband was dancing impatiently under Willon 's hand , scenting the fresh , keen , sunny air , and knowing as well what all those bits of scarlet straying in through field and lane , gate and gap , meant , as well as though the merry notes of the master 's horn were winding over the gorse . The meet was brilliant and very large ; showing such a gathering as only the Melton country can ; and foremost among the crowd of carriages , hacks , and hunters , were the beautiful roan mare Vivandière of the Lady Guenevere , mounted by that exquisite Peeress in her violet habit , and her tiny velvet hat ; and the pony equipage of the Zu - Zu , all glittering with azure and silver , leopard rugs , and snowy reins : the breadth of half an acre of grassland was between them , but the groups of men about them were tolerably equal for number and for rank . "
34925	34974	34921	34923	a good fellow	1746	" murmured Cecil , as he swung himself into saddle . The Seraph gave a leonine growl , sighed , and acquiesced . He detested women in the hunting - field , but that sweetest tempered giant of the Brigades never refused anything to anybody — much less to "
34977	35117	35138	35138	she	1747	" To an uninitiated mind it would have seemed marvellous and beautiful in its combination of simplicity and intricacy , to have noted the delicate tactics with which Bertie conducted himself between his two claimants;—bending to his Countess with a reverent devotion that assuaged whatever of incensed perception of her unacknowledged rival might be silently lurking in her proud heart ; wheeling up to the pony - trap under cover of speaking to the men from Egerton Lodge , and restoring the Zu - Zu from sulkiness , by a propitiatory offer of a little gold sherry - flask , studded with turquoises , just ordered for her from Regent - street , which , however , she ungraciously contemned , because she thought it had only cost twenty guineas ; anchoring the victimised Seraph beside her by an adroit "
35146	35177	35138	35138	she	1747	" and leaving the Zu - Zu content at securing a future Duke , was free to canter back and flirt on the off - side of Vivandière , till the "
35180	35182	35138	35138	she	1747	" the "
35185	35220	35138	35138	she	1747	" made with consummate craft , the waving of the white sterns among the brushwood , the tightening of girths , the throwing away of cigars , the challenge , the whimper , and the "
35224	35438	35538	35544	that person " in the azure habit	6895	" sent the field headlong down the course after as fine a long - legged greyhound fox as ever carried a brush . Away he went in a rattling spin , breaking straight at once for the open , the hounds on the scent like mad : with a tally - ho that thundered through the cloudless , crisp , cold , glittering noon , the field dashed off pell - mell , the violet habit of her ladyship , and the azure skirts of the Zu - Zu foremost of all in the rush through the spinneys ; while Cecil on the King , and the Seraph on a magnificent white weight - carrier , as thorough - bred and colossal as himself , led the way with them . The scent was hot as death in the spinneys , and the pack raced till nothing but a good one could live with them ; few but good ones , however , were to be found with the Quorn , and the field held together superbly over the first fence , and on across the grassland , the game old fox giving no sign of going to covert , but running straight as a crow flies , while the pace grew terrific . "
35444	35537	35124	35124	Rock	484	" cried the Zu - Zu , while her blue skirts fluttered in the wind , as she lifted Cecil 's brown mare , very cleverly , over a bilberry hedge , and set her little white teeth with a will on the Seraph 's otto - of - rose cigarette . Lady Guenevere heard the words as Vivandière rose in the air with the light bound of a roe , and a slight superb dash of scorn came into her haughty eyes for the moment ; she never seemed to know that "
35540	35660	35124	35124	Rock	484	" in the azure habit even existed , but the contempt awoke in her , and shone in her glance , while she rode on as that fair leader of the Belvoir and Pytchley alone could ride over the fallows . The steam was on at full pressure , the hounds held close to his brush , heads up , sterns down , running still straight as an arrow over the open , past coppice and covert , through gorse and spinney , without a sign of the fox making for shelter . Fence , and double , hedge and brook , soon scattered the field ; straying off far and wide , and coming to grief with lots of "
35663	35681	35138	35138	she	1747	" it grew select , and few but the crack men could keep the hounds in view . "
35687	35869	35138	35138	she	1747	" was the one mot d'ordre , for they were literally racing , the line - hunters never losing the scent a second , as the fox , taking to dodging , made all the trouble he could for them through the rides of the woods . Their working was magnificent , and , heading him , they ran him round and round in a ring , viewed him for a second , and drove him out of covert once more into the pastures , while they laid on at a hotter scent and flew after him like staghounds . Only half a dozen were up with them now ; the pace was tremendous , though all over grass ; here a flight of posts and rails tried the muscle of the boldest ; there a bullfinch yawned behind the blackthorn ; here a big fence towered ; there a brook rushed angrily among its rushes ; while the keen , easterly wind blew over the meadows , and the pack streamed along like the white trail of a plume . Cecil "
35873	36069	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" with the self - same stride and the self - same fencing as had won him the Vase . Lady Guenevere and the Seraph were running almost even with him ; three of the Household farther down ; the Zu - Zu and some Melton men two meadows off ; the rest of the field , nowhere . Fifty - two minutes had gone by in that splendid running , without a single check , while the fox raced as gamely and as fast as at the find ; the speed was like lightning past the brown woods , the dark - green pine plantations , the hedges , bright with scarlet berries ; through the green low - lying grasslands , and the winding drives of coverts , and the boles of ash - hued beech trunks , whose roots the violets were just purpling with their blossom ; while far away stretched the blue haze of the distance , and above - head a flight of rooks cawed merrily in the bright air , soon left far off as the pack swept onward in the most brilliant thing of the hunting year . "
36075	36403	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" cried Cecil , with a warning wave of his hand as the hounds with a splash like a torrent dashed up to their necks in a broad brawling brook that Reynard had swam in first - rate style , and struggled as best they could after him . It was an awkward bit , with bad taking - off and a villanous mud - bank for landing ; and the water , thickened and swollen with recent rains , had made all the land that sloped to it miry and soft as sponge . It was the risk of life and limb to try it ; but all who still viewed the hounds catching Bertie 's shout of warning worked their horses up for it , and charged towards it as hotly as troops charge a square . Forest King was over like a bird ; the winner of the Grand Military was not to be daunted by all the puny streams of the Shires ; the artistic riding of the Countess landed Vivandière , with a beautiful clear spring , after him by a couple of lengths : the Seraph 's handsome white hunter , brought up at a headlong gallop with characteristic careless dash and fine science mingled , cleared it ; but , falling with a mighty crash , gave him a purler on the opposite side , and was within an ace of striking him dead with his hoof in frantic struggles to recover . The Seraph , however , was on his legs with a rapidity marvellous in a six - foot - three son of Anak , picked up the horse , threw himself into saddle , and dashed off again quick as lightning , with his scarlet stained all over , and his long fair moustaches floating in the wind . The Zu - Zu turned Mother of Pearl back with a fiery French oath ; she hated to be "
36407	36427	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" but she liked still less to risk her neck ; and two of the Household were already treated to "
36429	36599	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" that disabled them for the day , while one Melton man was pitched head - foremost into the brook , and another was sitting dolorously on the bank with his horse 's head in his lap , and the poor brute 's spine broken . There were only three of the first riders in England now alone with the hounds , who , with a cold scent as the fox led them through the angular corner of a thick pheasant covert , stuck like wax to the line , and working him out , viewed him once more , for one wild , breathless , tantalising second , and , on a scent breast - high , raced him with the rush of an express through the straggling street of a little hamlet , and got him out again on the level pastures and across a fine line of hunting country , with the leafless woods and the low gates of a park far away to their westward . "
36610	36719	36733	36733	he	1750	" cried the flute - voice of her brilliant ladyship , as she ran a moment side by side with Forest King , and flashed her rich eyes on his rider ; she had scorned the Zu - Zu , but on occasion she would use betting slang and racing slang with the daintiest grace in the world herself without their polluting her lips . As though the old fox heard the wager , he swept in a bend round towards the woods on the right , making with all the craft and the speed there were in him for the deep shelter of the boxwood and laurel . "
36743	36851	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" thundered the Seraph , as though he were hunting his own hounds at Lyonnesse , who knew every tone of his rich clarion notes as well as they knew every wind of his horn . But the young ones of the pack saw Reynard 's move and his meaning as quickly as he did ; having run fast before , they flew now : the pace was terrific . Two fences were crossed as though they were paper ; the meadows raced with lightning speed , a ha - ha leaped , a gate cleared with a crashing jump , and in all the furious excitement of "
36853	36935	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" they tore down the mile - long length of an avenue , dashed into a flower - garden , and smashing through a gay trellis - work of scarlet creeper , plunged into the home - paddock and killed with as loud a shout ringing over the country in the bright sunny day as ever was echoed by the ringing cheers of the Shire ; Cecil , the Seraph , and her victorious ladyship alone coming in for the glories of "
36938	36939	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" "
36950	37199	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" said Lady Guenevere , looking at the tiny jewelled watch , the size of a sixpence , that was set in the handle of her whip , as the brush , with all the compliments customary , was handed to her . She had won twenty before . The park , so unceremoniously entered , belonged to a baronet who , though he hunted little himself , honoured the sport and scorned a vulpecide ; he came out naturally and begged them to lunch . Lady Guenevere refused to dismount , but consented to take a biscuit and a little Lafitte , while clarets , liqueurs , and ales , with anything they wanted to eat , were brought to her companions . The stragglers strayed in ; the M. F. H. came up just too late ; the men getting down gathered about the Countess or lounged on the grey stone steps of the Elizabethan house . The sun shone brightly on the oriel casements , the antique gables , the twisted chimneys , all covered with crimson parasites and trailing ivy ; the horses , the scarlet , the pack in the paddock adjacent , the shrubberies of laurel and auraucaria , the sun - tinted terraces , made a bright and picturesque grouping . Bertie , with his hand on Vivandière 's pommel , after taking a deep draught of sparkling Rhenish , looked on at it all with a pleasant sigh of amusement . "
37203	37216	36723	36724	my beauties	1751	" he murmured softly , with a contented smile about his lips ; "
37223	37395	37401	37401	I	0	" At that very moment , as the words were spoken , a groom approached him hastily ; his young brother , whom he had scarcely seen since the find , had been thrown and taken home on a hurdle ; the injuries , were rumoured to be serious . Bertie 's smile faded ; he looked very grave : world - spoiled as he was , reckless in everything , and egotist though he had long been by profession , he loved the lad . When he entered the darkened room , with its faint chloroform odour , the boy lay like one dead , his bright hair scattered on the pillow , his chest bare , and his right arm broken and splintered . The death - like coma was but the result of the chloroform ; but Cecil never stayed to ask or remember that , he was by the couch in a single stride , and dropped down by it , his head bent on his arms . "
37408	37476	37401	37401	I	0	" The words were very low ; he hated that any should see he could still be such a fool as to feel . A minute , and he conquered himself ; he rose , and with his hand on the boy 's fair tumbled curls , turned calmly to the medical men who , attached to the household , had been on the spot at once . "
37482	37483	37513	37513	he	1753	" "
37500	37505	37520	37521	Mr. Cecil	403	" replied the surgeon ; "
37523	37524	37525	37525	You	0	" "
37527	37564	37525	37525	You	0	certain?"—do what he would his voice shook a little ; his hand had not shaken , two days before , when nothing less than ruin or ransom had hung on his losing or winning the race . "
37568	37575	37607	37607	he	1753	" answered the surgeon , cheerfully . "
37603	37604	37607	37607	he	1753	" "
37610	37674	37686	37686	Bertie	409	" But while they told him he scarcely heard ; he was looking at the handsome Antinous - like form of the lad stretched helpless and stricken before him ; and he was remembering the death - bed of their mother , when the only voice he had ever reverenced had whispered , as she pointed to the little child of three summers : "
37688	37726	37800	37800	you	6134	" How had he fulfilled the injunction ? Into how much brilliantly - tinted evil had he not led him — by example at least ? The surgeon touched his arm apologetically , after a lengthened silence : "
37806	37911	37800	37800	you	6134	" Cecil went , mechanically almost , and with a grave , weary depression on him ; he was so unaccustomed to think at all , so utterly unaccustomed to think painfully , that he scarcely knew what ailed him . Had he had his old tact about him , he would have known how worse than useless it would be for him to seek his father in such a moment . Lord Royallieu was lying back exhausted as Cecil opened the door of his private apartments , heavily darkened and heavily perfumed ; at the turn of the lock he started up eagerly . "
37917	37918	37922	37922	I	0	" "
37925	37936	38031	38031	sir	6134	" said Cecil , gently , as he came forward . "
37961	38025	38031	38031	sir	6134	" The old man had not recognised him till he heard his voice , and he waved him off with a fierce contemptuous gesture ; the grief for his favourite 's danger , the wild terrors that his fears had conjured up , his almost frantic agony at the sight of the accident , had lashed him into passion well - nigh delirious . "
38033	38046	38134	38134	sir	6134	" he said , fiercely , his mellow tones quivering with rage . "
38078	38128	38134	38134	sir	6134	" Cecil bowed in silence ; the brutality of the words wounded , but they did not offend him , for he knew his father was in that moment scarce better than a maniac , and he was touched with the haggard misery upon the old Peer 's face . "
38136	38174	38275	38275	I	0	" re - echoed Lord Royallieu , as he strode forward , passion lending vigour to his emaciated frame , while the dignity of his grand car riage blent with the furious force of his infuriated blindness . "
38281	38366	38395	38395	You	6134	" No words can give the force , the malignity , the concentrated meaning with which the words were hurled out , as the majestic form of the old Lord towered in the shadow , with his hands outstretched as if in imprecation . Cecil heard him in silence , doubting if he could hear aright , while the bitter phrases scathed and cut like scourges , but he bowed once more with the manner that was as inseparable from him as his nature . "
38393	38394	38395	38395	You	6134	" "
38398	38413	38583	38583	You	6134	" thundered his father , while his hawk 's eyes flashed their glittering fire . "
38465	38582	38682	38682	he	1772	" The secret doubt , treasured so long , was told at last . The blood flushed Bertie 's face a deep and burning scarlet ; he started with an irrepressible tremor , like a man struck with a shot ; he felt like one suddenly stabbed in the dark by a sure and a cruel hand . The insult and the amazement of the words seemed to paralyse him for the moment , the next he recovered himself , and lifted his head with as haughty a gesture as his father 's , his features were perfectly composed again , and sterner than in all his careless , easy life they ever yet had looked . "
38623	38676	38682	38682	he	1772	" And without another word he turned and went out of the chamber . Yet , as the door closed , old habit was so strong on him , that , even in his hot and bitter pain , and his bewildered sense of sudden outrage , he almost smiled at himself . "
38690	38694	39149	39150	a fellow	6423	" he thought . "
38721	39148	38687	38687	he	1772	" But the cruel stroke had not struck the less closely home , and gentle though his nature was , beyond all forgiveness from him was the dishonour of his mother 's memory . It was the height of the season , and the duties of the Household were proportionately and insupportably heavy . The Brigades were fairly worked to death , and the Indian service , in the heat of the Affghan war , was never more onerous than the campaigns that claimed the Guards from Derby to Ducal . Escorts to Levees , guards of honour to Drawing - rooms , or field - days in the Park and the Scrubs , were but the least portion of it . Far more severe , and still less to be shirked , were the morning exercise in the Ride ; the daily parade in the Lady 's Mile ; the reconnaissances from club windows , the videttes at Flirtation Corner ; the long campaigns at mess - breakfasts , with the study of dice and baccarat tactics , and the fortifications of Strasburg pâté against the invasions of Chartreuse and Chambertin ; the breathless , steady charges up Belgravian staircases when a fashionable drum beat the rataplan ; the skirmishes with sharpshooters of the bright - armed Irregular Lances ; the foraging - duty when fair commanders wanted ices or strawberries at garden parties ; the ball - practice at Hornsey Handicaps ; the terrible risk of crossing into the enemy 's lines , and being made to surrender as prisoners of war at the jails of St. George 's , or of St. Paul 's Knightsbridge ; the constant inspections of the Flying Battalions of the Ballet , and the pickets afterwards in the Wood of St. John ; the anxieties of the Club commissariats , and the close vigilance over the mess wines ; the fatigue duty of ball - rooms , and the continual unharnessing consequent on the clause in the Regulations never to wear the same gloves twice ; all these , without counting the close battles of the Corner and the unremitting requirements of the Turf , worked the First Life and the rest of the Brigades , Horse and Foot , so hard and incessantly , that some almost thought of changing into the dreary depôt of St. Stephen 's ; and one mutinous Coldstreamer was even rash enough and false enough to his colours to meditate deserting to the enemy 's camp , and giving himself up at St. George's—"because
39160	39224	39564	39564	his	1778	" The Household were very hard pressed through the season — a crowded and brilliant one ; and Cecil was in request most of all . Bertie , somehow or other , was the fashion — marvellous and indefinable word , that gives a more powerful crown than thrones , blood , beauty , or intellect can ever bestow . And no list was "
39227	39561	39564	39564	his	1778	" without his name , no reception , no garden party , no opera - box , or private concert , or rose - shadowed boudoir , fashionably affiché without being visited by him . How he , in especial , had got his reputation it would have been hard to say , unless it were that he dressed a shade more perfectly than any one , and with such inimitable carelessness in the perfection , too , and had an almost unattainable matchlessness in the sang froid of his soft languid insolence , and incredible though ever gentle effrontery . However gained , he had it : and his beautiful hack Sahara , his mail - phaeton with two blood greys dancing in impatience over the stones , or his little dark - green brougham for night - work , were , one or another of them , always seen from two in the day till four or five in the dawn about the Park or the town . And yet this season , while he made a prima donna by a bravissima , introduced a new tie by an evening 's wear , gave a cook the cordon with his praise , and rendered a fresh - invented liqueur the rage by his recommendation , Bertie knew very well that he was ruined . The breach between his father and himself was irrevocable . He had left Royallieu as soon as his guests had quitted it , and young Berkeley was out of all danger . He had long known he could look for no help from the old Lord , or from his elder brother , the heir ; and now every chance of it was hopelessly closed ; nothing but the whim or the will of those who held his floating paper , and the tradesmen who had his name on their books at compound interest of the heaviest , stood between him and the fatal hour when he must "
39568	39571	39564	39564	his	1778	" and be "
39573	39818	39564	39564	his	1778	" in the great race of life . He knew that a season , a month , a day , might be the only respite left him , the only pause for him betwixt his glittering luxurious world and the fiat of outlawry and exile . He knew that the Jews might be down on him any night that he sat at the Guards ' mess , flirted with foreign Princesses , or laughed at the gossamer gossip of the town over iced drinks in the clubs . His liabilities were tremendous , his resources totally exhausted ; but such was the latent recklessness of the careless Royallieu blood , and such the languid devil - may - care of his training and his temper , that the knowledge scarcely ever seriously disturbed his enjoyment of the moment . Somehow , he never realised it . If any weatherwise had told the Lisbon people of the coming of the great earthquake , do you think they could have brought themselves to realise that midnight darkness , that yawning desolation which were nigh , while the sun was still so bright and the sea so tranquil , and the bloom so sweet on purple pomegranate and amber grape , and the scarlet of odorous flowers , and the blush of a girl 's kiss - warmed cheek ? A sentimental metaphor with which to compare the difficulties of a dandy of the Household , because his "
39820	39919	39564	39564	his	1778	" was floating about in too many directions at too many high figures , and he had hardly enough till next pay - day came round to purchase the bouquets he sent , and meet the club - fees that were due ! But , after all , may it not well be doubted if a sharp shock and a second 's blindness , and a sudden sweep down under the walls of the Cathedral or the waters of the Tagus , were not , on the whole , a quicker and pleasanter mode of extinction than that social earthquake—"gone
39927	40021	40023	40023	you	1779	" And the Lisbonites did not more disbelieve in , and dream less of their coming ruin , than Cecil did his , while he was doing the season , with engagements enough in a night to spread over a month , the best horses in the town , a dozen rose - notes sent to his clubs or his lodgings in a day , and the newest thing in soups , colts , beauties , neckties , perfumes , tobaccos , or square dances , waiting his dictum to become the fashion . "
40033	40118	40023	40023	you	1779	" growled the Seraph , one day after a morning of fearful hard work consequent on having played the Foot Guards at Lord 's , and , in an unwary moment , having allowed himself to be decoyed afterwards to a private concert , and very nearly proposed to in consequence , during a Symphony in A ; an impending terror from which he could hardly restore himself by puffing turkish like a steam - engine , to assure himself of his jeopardised safety . "
40124	40125	40023	40023	you	1779	" "
40132	40138	40163	40163	she	1780	" rejoined Beauty , serenely . "
40160	40161	40163	40163	she	1780	" "
40171	40220	40232	40232	they	1782	" mused the Seraph , who had gloomy personal recollection of having been twice through that phase of law and life , and of having been enormously mulcted in damages because he was a Duke in futuro , and because , as he piteously observed on the occasion , "
40240	40241	40244	40244	everybody	6171	" "
40253	40260	40244	40244	everybody	6171	" answered Cecil , with philosophy . "
40283	40284	40372	40372	I	0	" "
40303	40371	40399	40399	they	1790	" laughed the Seraph , consoling himself that he had escaped the future chance of showing in the latter class of marital defrauded , by shying that proposal during the Symphony in A , on which his thoughts ran as the thoughts of one who has just escaped from an Alpine crevasse run on the past abyss in which he has been so nearly lost for ever . "
40409	40427	40428	40428	I	0	" and the poor hunted Seraph stretched his magnificent limbs with the sigh of a martyred innocent . "
40435	40436	40471	40471	I	0	" "
40447	40468	40471	40471	I	0	" The Seraph lifted himself a little , with a sort of pitying sympathising curiosity towards a fellow - sufferer . "
40476	40503	40714	40714	I	0	" said Bertie , with a sigh as of a man who hated long sentences , and who was about to plunge into a painful past . "
40727	40728	40714	40714	I	0	" "
40731	40782	40790	40790	I	0	" asked the Seraph , pausing to listen till he let the ice in his sherry - cobbler melt away : when you have been so near breaking your neck down the Matrimonial Matterhorn , it is painfully interesting to hear how your friend escaped the same risks of descent . "
40785	40789	40980	40980	I	0	" resumed Bertie , "
40989	41008	41073	41073	She	1794	" The Seraph , with the clarion roll of his gay laughter , flung a hautboy at him . "
41071	41072	41089	41089	her	1794	" "
41092	41098	41142	41142	I	0	" murmured Cecil , sententiously . "
41150	41390	41142	41142	I	0	" With which masterly description in one phrase of all he could have done for the ill - starred débutante who had been hungry in the wrong place , Cecil lunged out of the club to drive with half a dozen of his set to a water - party — a Bacchanalian water - party , with the Zu - Zu and her sisters for the Naiads , and the Household for their Tritons . A water - party whose water element apparently consisted in driving down to Richmond , dining at nine , being three hours over the courses , contributing seven guineas apiece for the repast , listening to the songs of the Café Alcazar , reproduced with matchless élan by a pretty French actress , being pelted with brandy cherries by the Zu - Zu , seeing their best cigars thrown away half - smoked by pretty pillagers , and driving back again to town in the soft starry night , with the gay rhythms ringing out from the box - seat as the leaders dashed along in a stretching gallop down the Kew road . It certainly had no other more aquatic feature in it save a little drifting about for twenty minutes before dining , in toy boats and punts , as the sun was setting , while Laura Lelas , the brunette actress , sang a barcarolle that would have been worthy of mediæval "
41404	41419	41448	41448	I	0	" It did not set Cecil thinking , however , after Browning 's fashion , "
41455	41825	41877	41877	I	0	" because , in the first place , it was a canon with him never to think at all ; in the second , if put to it he would have averred that he knew nothing of Venice , except that it was a musty old bore of a place , where they worried you about visas and luggage and all that , chloride of lime'd you if you came from the East , and could n't give you a mount if it were ever so ; and in the third , instead of longing for the dear dead women , he was entirely contented with the lovely living ones who were at that moment puffing the smoke of his scented cigarettes into his eyes , making him eat lobster drowned in Chablis , or pelting him with bonbons . As they left the Star and Garter , Laura Lelas , mounted on Cecil 's box - seat , remembered she had dropped her cashmere in the dining - room . A cash - mere is a Parisian 's soul , idol , and fetish ; servants could not find it ; Cecil , who , to do him this justice , was always as courteous to a Comédienne as to a Countess , went himself . Passing the open windows of another room , he recognised the face of his little brother among a set of young Civil Service fellows , attachés , and cornets . They had no women with them ; but they had brought what was perhaps worse — dice for hazard — and were turning the unconscious Star and Garter into an impromptu Crockford 's over their wine . Little Berke 's pretty face was very flushed ; his lips were set tight , his eyes were glittering ; the boy had the gambler 's passion of the Royallieu blood in its hottest intensity . He was playing with a terrible eagerness that went to Bertie 's heart with the same sort of pang of remorse with which he had looked on him when he had been thrown like dead on his bed at home . Cecil stopped and leaned over the open window . "
41848	41874	41877	41877	I	0	" he asked , with a careless nod to the rest of the young fellows . Berkeley looked up with a wayward , irritated annoyance . "
41881	41887	41900	41900	I	0	" he said , irritably ; "
41898	41899	41900	41900	I	0	" "
41903	41935	41900	41900	I	0	" answered Cecil , with a dash of gravity , almost of sadness in him , as he leaned further over the window - sill with his cigar in his teeth . "
41939	41961	42018	42018	you	6168	" he whispered , kindly , as he almost touched the boy , who chanced to be close to the casement . "
42032	42051	42018	42018	you	6168	" The lad shook himself peevishly ; a sullen cloud over his fair , picturesque , boyish face . "
42059	42065	42071	42071	I	0	" he muttered , impatiently . "
42075	42076	42149	42151	A pretty fellow	1814	" "
42079	42148	42484	42484	he	409	" Cecil shrugged his shoulders , left the window , found the Lelas ' cashmere , and sauntered back to the drags without any more expostulation . The sweetness of his temper could never be annoyed , but also he never troubled himself to utter useless words . Moreover , he had never been in his life much in earnest about anything ; it was not worth while . "
42476	42483	42484	42484	he	409	" If it be very severe , "
42488	42528	42701	42701	he	409	" it may give him a pang once a twelvemonth — say the morning after a whitebait dinner . Repentance is generally the fruit of indigestion , and contrition may generally be traced to too many truffles or olives . "
42672	42700	42708	42710	a fair lady	1827	" If I were a professional diner - out , you know , I 'd use such wits as I have : but why should I now ? "
42717	42759	42779	42780	his interrogator	1828	" The best style is only just to say yes and no — and be bored even in saying that — and a very comfortable style it is , too . You get amused without the trouble of opening your lips . "
42760	42777	42796	42796	Bertie	409	" But if everybody were equally monosyllabic , how then ? you would not get amused , "
42786	42794	42796	42796	Bertie	409	" Well — everybody is pretty nearly , "
42798	42870	43093	43093	he	409	" but there are always a lot of fellows who give their wits to get their dinners — social rockets , you know — who will always fire themselves off to sparkle instead of you if you give them a white ball at the clubs , or get them a card for good houses . It saves you so much trouble ; it is such a bore to have to talk . "
43077	43092	43170	43170	his	403	" Here — get me to perch as quick as you can , Rake , "
43175	43181	43185	43185	he	403	" Be a fearful bore ! "
43195	43200	43217	43217	his	403	" Queer old cad ! "
43235	43240	43325	43325	he	430	" Amber - Amulet ? "
43313	43324	43325	43325	he	430	" You are never thinking but of horses or women , "
43330	43342	43366	43366	Cecil	403	" there may be other things in the world , surely . "
43343	43364	43366	43366	Cecil	403	" Indisputably there are other things in the world , dear boy , but none so much to my taste , "
43376	43413	43434	43434	Cecil	403	" With every regard to hospitality , and the charms of your society , might I hint that five o'clock in the morning is not precisely the most suitable hour for social visits and ethical questions ? "
43414	43433	43477	43477	he	403	" For God 's sake be serious , Bertie ! I am the most miserable wretch in creation . "
43464	43476	43499	43499	he	403	" Ah , you would stay and play that chicken hazard , "
43515	43571	43575	43575	his	1043	" Dear boy , why did n't you sleep upon it ? I never think of disagreeable things till they wake me with my coffee ; then I take them up with the cup and put them down with it . You do n't know how well it answers ; it disposes of them wonderfully . "
43599	43638	43791	43791	Berkeley	430	" How brutal you are , Bertie ! I tell you I am ruined , and you care no more than if you were a stone . You only think of yourself ; you only live for yourself ! "
43753	43790	43859	43859	he	430	" ' Brutal ! ' What a word , little one . Nobody 's brutal now ; you never see that form now - a - days . Come , what is the worst this time ? "
43851	43858	43859	43859	he	430	" The worst is soon told , "
43878	43931	43961	43961	he	430	" I lost two hundred to - night ; I must pay it , or be disgraced for ever ; I have not a farthing ; I can not get the money for my life ; no Jews will lend to me , I am under age ; and — and — — "
43967	44019	44150	44150	he	409	" and — I borrowed three ponies of Granville Lee yesterday , as he came from the Corner with a lot of bank - notes after settling - day . I told him I would pay them to - morrow ; I made sure I should have won to - night . "
44135	44149	44150	44150	he	409	" You will bring some disgrace on us before you die , Berkeley , "
44169	44178	44232	44232	he	409	" Have you no common knowledge of honour ? "
44225	44231	44232	44232	he	409	" You are severe enough , "
44241	44266	44385	44385	he	409	" Are you such a mirror of honour yourself ? I suppose my debts at the worst are about one - fifth of yours . "
44375	44384	44385	44385	he	409	" Très cher , you are not courteous , "
44390	44523	44563	44563	he	430	" but it may be that you are right . I am not a good one for you to copy from in anything , except the fit of my coats ; I do n't think I ever told you I was . I am not altogether so satisfied with myself as to suggest myself as a model for anything , unless it were to stand in a tailor 's window in Bond - street to show the muffs how to dress . That is n't the point , though ; you say you want near 300 l . by to - morrow — to - day rather . I can suggest nothing except to take the morning mail to the Shires , and ask Royal straight out ; he never refuses you . "
44554	44562	44563	44563	he	430	" I would rather cut my throat , "
44582	44621	44563	44563	he	430	" as I live I would ! I have had so much from him lately — you do n't know how much — and now of all times when they threaten to foreclose the mortgage on Royallieu — — "
44622	44628	44635	44635	Berkeley	430	" What ? Foreclose what ? "
44629	44633	44732	44732	Cecil	403	" The mortgage ! "
44658	44731	44809	44809	he	403	" You know the lands are mortgaged as deeply as Monti and the entail would allow them . They threatened to foreclose — I think that 's the word — and Royal has had God knows what work to stave them off ; I no more dare face him , and ask him for a sovereign now , than I dare ask him to give me the gold plate off the sideboard . "
44798	44808	44809	44809	he	403	" Your intelligence is not cheerful , little one , "
44830	44849	44867	44867	Bertie	409	" And — I really am sleepy ! You think there is no hope Royal would help you ? "
44850	44866	45087	45087	he	409	" I tell you I will shoot myself through the brain rather than ask him . "
45072	45086	45087	45087	he	409	" It is no use to give you false hopes , young one , "
45092	45264	45349	45349	he	430	" I can do nothing ! You ought to know me by this time ; and , if you do , you know , too , that if the money were mine it should be yours at a word;—if you do n't , no matter ! Frankly , Berke , I am all down - hill . My bills may be called in any moment ; when they are , I must send in my papers to sell , and cut the country , if my duns do n't catch me before — which they probably will — in which event I shall be to all intents and purposes — dead . This is not lively conversation , but you will do me the justice to say that it was not I who introduced it . Only — one word for all , my boy , understand this : if I could help you I would , cost what it might ; but , as matters stand — I can not . "
45340	45348	45349	45349	he	430	" No — yes — I know , "
45354	45405	45421	45421	Cecil	403	" I have no right to expect it , and have been behaving like a cur , and — and — all that I know . But —— there is one way you could save me , Bertie , if it is n't too much for a fellow to ask . "
45406	45419	45421	45421	Cecil	403	" I ca n't say I see the way , little one , "
45427	45432	45592	45592	his	1870	" What is it ? "
45433	45590	45685	45685	he	1870	" Why — look here . You see , I 'm not of age ; my signature is of no use ; they wo n't take it ; else I could get money in no time on what must come to me when Royal dies ; though ' tisn't enough to make the Jews ' melt ' at a risk . Now — now — look here . I ca n't see that there could be any harm in it . You are such chums with Lord Rockingham , and he 's as rich as all the Jews put together . What could there be in it if you just asked him to lend you a monkey for me ? He 'd do it in a minute , because he 'd give his head away to you — they all say so — and he 'd never miss it . Now , Bertie —— will you ? "
45677	45684	45685	45685	he	1870	" What you ask is impossible , "
45690	45714	45759	45759	he	1870	" If I did such a thing as that , I should deserve to be hounded out of the Guards to - morrow . "
45747	45758	45807	45807	Cecil	403	" You speak as if it would be a crime , "
45785	45805	45807	45807	Cecil	403	" It would be the trick of a swindler , and it would be the shame of a gentleman , "
45813	45819	45849	45849	he	1870	" That is answer enough . "
45820	45828	45849	45849	he	1870	" Then you will not do it ? "
45829	45835	45949	45949	he	1870	" I have replied already . "
45915	45948	45949	45949	he	1870	" You said that you would aid me at any cost , and now that I ask you so wretched a trifle , you treat me as if I were a scoundrel , "
45954	45986	46072	46073	the lad	1067	" The Seraph would give you the money at a word . It is your pride — nothing but pride . Much pride is worth to us who are penniless beggars ! "
45987	46004	46016	46016	Cecil	403	" If we are penniless beggars , by what right should we borrow of other men ? "
46005	46015	46075	46075	his	1067	" You are wonderfully scrupulous all of a sudden ! "
46061	46069	46075	46075	his	1067	" You are a brute to me ! "
46089	46225	46235	46235	Bertie	409	" You pretend you can refuse me nothing ; and the moment I ask you the smallest thing , you turn round on me , and speak as if I were the greatest blackguard on earth . You 'll let me go to the bad to - morrow , rather than bend your pride to save me ; you live like a Duke , and do n't care if I should die in a debtors ' prison ! You only brag about ' honour ' when you want to get out of helping a fellow , and if I were to cut my throat to - night you would only shrug your shoulders , and sneer at my death in the club - room , with a jest picked out of your cursed French novels ! "
46226	46233	46363	46363	he	409	" Melodramatic , and scarcely correct , "
46346	46362	46375	46375	he	409	" Little one , you are heated , and do n't know what you say , "
46387	46493	46520	46520	Cecil	403	" do n't be down about this ; you will pull through , never fear . Listen to me ; go down to Royal , and tell him all frankly . I know him better than you ; he will be savage for a second , but he would sell every stick and stone on the land for your sake ; he will see you safe through this . Only bear one thing in mind — tell him all . No half measures , no half confidences ; tell him the worst , and ask his help . You will not come back without it . "
46512	46518	46520	46520	Cecil	403	" Do as I say , "
46526	46557	46583	46583	he	403	" Tell him , if you like , that it is through following my follies that you have come to grief ; he will be sure to pity you then . "
46586	46596	46583	46583	he	403	" Do you hear me ? Will you go ? "
46597	46605	46583	46583	he	403	" If you want me — yes . "
46606	46613	46583	46583	he	403	" On your word , now ? "
46614	46619	46794	46794	he	403	" On my word . "
46781	46793	46794	46794	he	403	" I beg your pardon for keeping you up , Bertie , "
46799	46803	46804	46804	Cecil	403	" Good night . "
46810	46848	46927	46927	he	403	" Dear boy , it would have been better if you could have come in with the coffee . Never be impulsive ; do n't do a bit of good , and is such a bad form ! "
46931	46974	47013	47014	the boy	1043	" You must know I could not do what you asked ; I could not meet any man in the Guards face to face if I sunk myself and sunk them so low . Ca n't you see that , little one ? "
47001	47011	47013	47014	the boy	1043	" You say so , and that is enough , "
47018	47049	47673	47673	he	403	" I can not understand that I asked anything so dreadful , but I suppose you have too many needs of your own to have any resources left for mine . "
47664	47672	47673	47673	he	403	" It may n't come to that , "
47676	47759	47782	47782	Terrail	579	" something may happen . If I could get my troop now , that would stave off the Jews ; or if I should win some heavy pots on the Prix de Dames , things would swim on again . I must win ; the King will be as fit as in the Shires , and there will only be the French horses between us and an absolute ' walk over . ' Things may n't come to the worst after all . "

48232	48294	48327	48327	his	1932	" It 's a'most a pity — he 's in such perfect condition . Tiptop . Cool as a cucumber after the longest pipe - opener ; licks his oats up to the last grain ; leads the whole string such a rattling spin as never was spun but by a Derby cracker before him . It 's a'most a pity , "

48337	48383	48389	48391	the head groom	6821	" It 'll only knock him over for the race ; he 'll be right as a trivet after it . What 's your little game , coming it soft like that all of a sudden ? You hate that ere young swell like pison . "
48384	48387	48514	48516	the head groom	6821	" Ay , "

48925	48933	49093	49093	Cecil	403	" Yes — I'll — paint him . "
49086	49092	49156	49156	Cecil	403	" Seraph — I 've been thinking"—said
49134	49155	49199	49199	he	403	" You do n't mean it . Never let it ooze out , Beauty ; you 'll ruin your reputation ! "
49192	49198	49199	49199	he	403	" I 've been thinking , "
49212	49224	49199	49199	he	403	" What 's a fellow to do when he 's smashed ? "
49225	49228	49284	49284	Bertie	409	" Eh ? "
49276	49282	49295	49296	the Seraph	454	" What do they do ? "
49286	49292	49325	49325	Cecil	403	" Go to the bad , "
49330	49369	49380	49381	the Seraph	6132	" Ca n't go where they are already . I 've been thinking what a fellow might do that was up a tree ; and on my honour there are lots of things one might turn to — — "
49370	49378	49325	49325	Cecil	403	" Well , I suppose there are , "
49406	49421	49496	49497	The Seraph	6132	" I should try the P. R. , only they will have you train . "
49422	49489	49496	49497	The Seraph	6132	" One might do better than the P. R. Getting yourself into prime condition , only to be pounded out of condition and into a jelly , seems hardly logical or satisfactory — specially to your looking - glass ; though , of course , it 's a matter of taste . But now , if I had a cropper , and got sold up — — "
49490	49495	49521	49521	Bertie	409	" You , Beauty ? "
49516	49519	49521	49521	Bertie	409	" Possible ! "
49533	49552	49559	49560	the Seraph	6132	" Anything 's possible . If I do now , it strikes me there are vast fields open . "
49553	49557	49559	49560	the Seraph	6132	" Gold fields ? "
49566	49667	49680	49681	the Seraph	6132	" Gold fields ? No ! I mean a field for — what d'ye call it — genius . Now , look here ; nine - tenths of creatures in this world do n't know how to put on a glove . It 's an art , and an art that requires long study . If a few of us were to turn glove - fitters when we are fairly crashed , we might civilise the whole world , and prevent the deformity of an ill - fitting glove ever blotting creation and prostituting Houbigant . What do you say ? "
49668	49678	49708	49708	Beauty	409	" Do n't be such a donkey , Beauty , "
49695	49706	49708	49708	Beauty	409	" You do n't appreciate the majesty of great plans , "
49712	50047	50059	50060	the Seraph	6132	" There 's an immense deal in what I 'm saying . Think what we might do for society,—think how we might extinguish snobbery , if we just dedicated our smash to Mankind . We might open a College , where the traders might go through a course of polite training before they blossomed out as millionaires ; the world would be spared an agony of dropped H 's and bad bows . We might have a Bureau where we registered all our social experiences , and gave the Plutocracy a map of Belgravia , with all the pitfalls marked , all the inaccessible heights coloured red , and all the hard - up great people dotted with gold to show the amount they 'd be bought for , with directions to the ignoramuses whom to know , court , and avoid . We might form a Courier Company , and take Brummagem abroad under our guidance , so that the Continent should n't think Englishwomen always wear blue veils and grey shawls , and hear every Englishman shout for porter and beefsteak in Tortoni 's . We might teach them to take their hats off to women , and not to prod pictures with sticks , and to look at statues without poking them with an umbrella , and to be persuaded that all foreigners do n't want to be bawled at , and wo n't understand bad French any the better for its being shouted . Or we might have a Joint - Stock Toilette Association , for the purposes of national art , and receive Brummagem to show it how to dress ; we might even succeed in making the feminine British Public drape itself properly , and the B. P. masculine wear boots that wo n't creak , and coats that do n't wrinkle , and take off its hat without a jerk as though it were a wooden puppet hung on very stiff strings . Or one might — — "
50048	50057	50059	50060	the Seraph	6132	" Talk the greatest nonsense under the sun ! "
50062	50074	50084	50084	Cecil	403	" For mercy 's sake , are you mad , Bertie ? "
50075	50082	50084	50084	Cecil	403	" Inevitable question addressed to Genius ! "
50086	50170	50059	50060	the Seraph	6132	" I 'm showing you plans that might teach a whole nation good style if we just threw ourselves into it a little . I do n't mean you , because you 'll never smash , and one do n't turn bear - leader , even to the B. P. , without the primary impulse of being hard - up . And I do n't talk for myself , because , when I go to the dogs , I have my own project . "
50171	50177	50194	50194	Bertie	409	" And what 's that ? "
50178	50192	50194	50194	Bertie	409	" To be groom of the chambers at Meurice 's or Claridge 's , "
50198	50319	50366	50366	his	6132	" Those sublime creatures with their silver chains round their necks , and their ineffable supremacy over every other mortal!—one would feel in a superior region still . And when a snob came to poison the air , how exquisitely one could annihilate him with showing him his ignorance of claret ; and when an epicure dined , how delightfully , as one carried in a turbot , one could test him with the éprouvette positive , or crush him by the éprouvette negative . We have been Equerries at the Palace , both of us , but I do n't think we know what true dignity is till we shall have risen to head waiters at a Grand Hotel . "
50383	50413	50366	50366	his	6132	" Well , if I went to the dogs , I would n't go to Grand Hotels , but I 'll tell you where I would go , Beauty . "
50414	50419	50494	50494	his	6132	" Where 's that ? "
50420	50485	50612	50612	he	403	" Into hot service , somewhere . By Jove , I 'd see some good fighting under another flag — out in Algeria , there , or with the Poles , or after Garibaldi . I would , in a day — I'm not sure I wo n't now , and I bet you ten to one the life would be better than this . "
50600	50611	50664	50664	he	6132	" The deuce — that 's not a bad idea , "

51834	51931	51940	51940	Bertie	409	" A Werter in the Guards ! I do n't think the rôle will suit either you or your corps , Bertie ; but if you do it , pray do it artistically . I remember , last year , driving through Asnières , when they had found a young man in the Seine ; he was very handsome , beautifully dressed , and he held fast in his clenched hand a gold lock of hair . Now , there was a man who knew how to die gracefully , and make his death an idyl ! "
51932	51938	51947	51947	his	409	" Died for a woman?—ah ! "
51950	51977	52120	52120	Cecil	403	" I do n't think I should do that , even for you , — not , at least , while I had a cigar left . "
52112	52118	52974	52974	She	2058	" Would she really care ? "
52938	52973	53045	53046	her ladyship	6411	" The beauties ! give them to me , Bertie . Dangerous ? How absurd you are ; as if I could not drive anything ! Do you remember my four roans at Longchamps ? "

57603	57785	57846	57847	that censor	2197	" I do n't think I am ; I 've had things to try me , you see . There was that Verschoyle 's proposal . I did absolutely think at one time she 'd marry me before I could protest against it ! Then there was that shock to one 's whole nervous system , when that indigo man , who took Lady Laura 's house , asked us to dinner , and actually thought we should go!—and there was a scene , you know , of all earthly horrors , when Mrs. Gervase was so near eloping with me , and Gervase cut up rough , instead of pitying me ; and then the field - days were so many , and so late into the season ; and I exhausted myself so at the Belvoir theatricals at Easter ; and I toiled so atrociously playing Almaviva at your place , Seraph — a private opera 's galley - slave 's work!—and , altogether , I 've had a good many things to pull me down since the winter , "

58033	58195	58246	58248	the outraged Coldstreamer	2199	" My dear fellow , no ! I ask you in reason , how can I be sure of what is n't proved ? I like that country fellow the old story tells of , he believed in fifteen shillings because he 'd once had it in his hand ; others , he 'd heard , believed in a pound ; but , for his part , he did n't , because he 'd never seen it . Now that was a man who 'd never commit himself ; he might have had the Exchequer ! I 'm the same ; I believe , the King can win at a good many things because I 've seen him do 'em ; but I ca n't possibly tell whether he can get this , because I 've never ridden him for it . I shall be able to tell you at three o'clock — but that you do n't care for — — "

62590	62623	62800	62800	he	403	" Better be one of them ten thousand times than be trained for the Great Race , and started with the cracks , dead weighted with the penalty - shot of Poverty ! "
62793	62799	62800	62800	he	403	" Well , Petite Reine , "
62819	62828	62800	62800	he	403	" all alone ; where are your playmates ? "
62829	62833	62851	62851	her	2356	" Petite Reine , "
62871	62882	62939	62939	her	2356	" Ah ! you know I never care for children ! "
62943	62969	63040	63040	her	2356	" I want to know — — ; you are so vexed , are you not ? They say you have lost all your money ! "
62970	62991	62939	62939	her	2356	" Do they ? They are not far wrong , then . Who are ' they , ' Petite Reine ? "
62992	63014	62939	62939	her	2356	" Oh , Prince Alexis , and the Due de Lorance , and mamma , and everybody . Is it true ? "
63015	63023	63028	63028	She	2356	" Very true , my little lady . "
63024	63027	63040	63040	her	2356	" Ah ! "
63051	63069	63076	63076	he	403	" I heard the Russian gentlemen saying that you were ruined . Is that true , too ? "
63070	63075	63210	63210	She	2356	" Yes , dear , "
63187	63209	63236	63236	her	2356	" Why , little one , what do you know of these things ? How did you find me out here ? "
63249	63320	63402	63402	She	2356	" I came — I came — please do n't be angry,—because I heard them say you had no money , and I want you to take mine . Do take it ! Look , it is all bright gold , and it is my own , my very own . Papa gives it to me to do just what I like with . Do take it ; pray do ! "
63424	63515	63609	63609	he	403	" Do n't be angry ; pray take it ; it is all my own , and you know I have bonbons , and books , and playthings , and ponies , and dogs , till I am tired of them . I never want the money , indeed I do n't . Take it , please take it ; and if you will only let me ask papa or Rock , they will give you thousands and thousands of pounds if that is n't enough . Do let me ? "
63604	63608	63642	63642	Her	2359	" Petite Reine , "
63618	63641	63648	63648	she	2359	lightness—"Petite Reine , how some man will love you one day ! Thank you from my heart , my little innocent friend . "
63658	63689	63702	63702	he	403	" Ah ! then you will take it ? And if you want more , only let me ask them for it ; papa and Philip never refuse me anything ! "
63717	63774	63817	63817	she	612	" Petite Reine , you are a little angel ; but I can not take your money , my child , and you must ask for none for my sake from your father or from Rock . Do not look so grieved , little one ; I love you none the less because I refuse it . "
63813	63816	63817	63817	she	612	" Ah , "
63827	63848	63933	63933	She	612	" it is no good to you because it is such a little . Do let me ask for more ? "
63859	63932	63953	63953	she	612	" No , dear , you must not ask for more ; I have been very foolish , my little friend , and I must take the fruits of my folly ; all men must . I can accept no one 's money , not even yours ; when you are older and remember this , you will know why ; but I do not thank you the less from my heart . "
63942	63952	63965	63965	He	2367	" You will not take anything , Mr. Cecil ? "
63972	64279	64323	64323	You	2368	" I will take that , if you will give it me , Petite Reine , and keep it in memory of you . As he spoke , he stooped and kissed her very gently ; the act had moved him more deeply than he thought he had it in him to be moved by anything , and the child 's face turned upwards to him was of a very perfect and aristocratic loveliness far beyond her years . She coloured as his lips touched hers , and swayed slightly from him . She was an extremely proud young sovereign , and never allowed caresses ; yet she lingered by him troubled , grave , with something intensely tender and pitiful in the musing look of her eyes . She had a perception that this calamity which smote him was one far beyond the ministering of her knowledge . He took the pretty Palais Royal gold - rimmed sweetmeat - box , and slipped it into his waistcoat - pocket . It was only a child 's gift , a tiny Paris toy , but it had been brought to him in a tender compassion , and he did keep it — kept it through dark days and wild nights , through the scorch of the desert and the shadows of death , till the young eyes that questioned him now with such innocent wonder had gained the grander lustre of their womanhood , and had brought him a grief wider than he knew now . At that moment , as the child stood beside him under the drooping acacia boughs , with the green sloping lower valley seen at glimpses through the wall of leaves , one of the men of the Stephanien approached him with an English letter , which , as it was marked "
64282	64322	64323	64323	You	2368	" they had laid apart from the rest of the visitors ' pile of correspondence ; Cecil took it wearily — nothing but fresh embarrassments could come to him from England — and looked at the little Lady Venetia . "
64328	64613	64934	64934	me	0	" She bowed her graceful head : with all the naïf unconsciousness of a child she had all the manner of the vielle cour ; — — together they made her enchanting . He broke the envelope and read;—a blurred , scrawled , miserable letter , the words erased with passionate strokes , and blotted with hot tears , and scored out in impulsive misery . It was long , yet at a glance he scanned its message and its meaning ; at the first few words he knew its whole as well as though he had studied every line . A strong tremor shook him from head to foot , a tremor at once of passionate rage and of as passionate pain ; his face blanched to a deadly whiteness ; his teeth clenched as though he were restraining some bodily suffering , and he tore the letter in two and stamped it down into the turf under his heel , with a gesture as unlike his common serenity of manner as the fiery passion that darkened in his eyes was unlike the habitual softness of his too pliant and too unresentful temper . He crushed the senseless paper again and again down into the grass beneath his heel , his lips shook under the silky abundance of his beard ; the natural habit of long usage kept him from all utterance , and even in the violence of its shock he remembered the young Venetia 's presence ; but , in that one fierce unrestrained gesture , the shame and suffering upon him broke out despite himself . The child watched him , startled and awed . She touched his hand softly . "
64623	64653	64934	64934	me	0	" He turned his eyes on her with a dry , hot , weary anguish in them ; he was scarcely conscious what he said or what he answered . "
64658	64679	64934	64934	me	0	" he repeated , mechanically , while his heel still ground down in loathing the shattered paper into the grass . "
64695	64898	64912	64912	You	2369	" He spoke to his thoughts , not to her . The words died in his throat ; a bitter agony was on him ; all the golden summer evening , all the fair green world about him , were indistinct and unreal to his senses ; he felt as if the whole earth were of a sudden changed . He could not realise that this thing could come to him and his;—that this foul dishonour could creep up and stain them;—that this infamy could ever be of them and upon them . All the ruin that before had fallen on him to - day was dwarfed and banished ; it looked nothing beside the unendurable horror that reached him now . The gay laughter of children sounded down the air at that moment ; they were the children of a French Princess seeking their playmate , Venetia , who had escaped from them and from their games to find her way to Cecil . He motioned her to them ; he could not bear even the clear and pitying eyes of the Petite Reine to be upon him now . She lingered wistfully ; she did not like to leave him . "
64905	64911	64934	64934	me	0	" she pleaded , caressingly . "
64938	64959	64989	64990	Petite Reine	612	" He laid his hand on her shoulder ; his voice , as he answered , was hoarse and unsteady . "
64992	65001	64989	64990	Petite Reine	612	" She gave him a long earnest look . "
65004	65248	64989	64990	Petite Reine	612	" she answered , simply and gravely , as one who accepts , and not lightly , a trust . Then she went slowly and lingeringly , with the sun on the gold fillet binding her hair , but the tears heavy on the shadow of her silken lashes . When next they met , the lustre of a warmer sun that once burned on the white walls of the palaces of Phoenicia and the leaping flames of the Temple of the God of Healing , shone upon them , and through the veil of those sweeping lashes there gazed the resistless sovereignty of a proud and patrician womanhood . Alone , his head sank down upon his hands , he gave reins to the fiery scorn , the acute suffering , which turn by turn seized him with every moment that seared the words of the letter deeper and deeper down into his brain . Until this , he had never known what it was to suffer ; until this , his languid creeds had held that no wise man feels strongly , and that to glide through life untroubled and unmoved is as possible as it is politic . Now he suffered — he suffered dumbly as a dog , passionately as a barbarian ; now he was met by that which , in the moment of its dealing , pierced his panoplies of indifference , and escaped his light philosophies . "
65252	65256	65250	65250	God	565	" he thought , "
65267	65366	65250	65250	God	565	" In a miserable den , an hour or so before — there are miserable dens even in Baden , that gold - decked rendezvous of Princes where crowned heads are numberless as couriers , and great ministers must sometimes be content with a shakedown — two men sat in consultation . Though the chamber was poor and dark , their table was loaded with various expensive wines and liqueurs ; of a truth they were flush of money , and selected this poor place from motives of concealment rather than of necessity . One of them was the "
65369	65413	65250	65250	God	565	" Ben Davis ; the other , a smaller , quieter man , with a keen vivacious Hebrew eye and an olive - tinted skin , a Jew , Ezra Baroni . The Jew was cool , sharp , and generally silent ; the "
65416	65521	65540	65540	I	0	" heated , eager , flushed with triumph and glowing with a gloating malignity . Excitement and the fire of very strong wines of whose vintage brandy formed a large part , had made him voluble in exultation ; the monosyllabic sententiousness that had characterised him in the loose - box at Royallien had been dissipated under the ardour of success ; and Ben Davis , with his legs on the table , a pipe between his teeth , and his bloated face purple with a brutal contentment , might have furnished to a Teniers the personification of culminated cunning and of delighted tyranny . "
65528	65539	65614	65614	You	2376	" he muttered , gloatingly , for the hundredth time . "
65636	65637	65614	65614	You	2376	" "
65649	65656	65715	65715	One	6278	" expostulated the more philosophic Jew . "
65667	65678	65904	65904	you	2382	" retorted the Welsher , savagely even amidst his successes . "
65811	65897	65905	65906	Big Ben	620	" he growled afresh , draining down a great draught of brandy - heated Roussillon to drown the impatient conviction which possessed him that let him triumph as he would there would ever remain , in that fine intangible sense which his coarse nature could feel , though he could not have further defined it , a superiority in his adversary he could not conquer , a difference between him and his and prey he could not bridge over . The Jew laughed a little . "
65925	65945	66040	66041	the Club	621	" Big Ben gave a long growl like a mastiff tearing to reach a bone just held above him . "
66055	66056	66040	66041	the Club	621	" "
66060	66067	66131	66131	dey	413	" said the Jew , serenely . "
66138	66152	66328	66328	yer	2392	" The Welsher gave a loud horse - guffaw of relish and enjoyment . "
66330	66345	66378	66378	I	0	" Ezra Baroni smiled where he leant against the table looking over some papers . "
66369	66375	66531	66531	I	0	" Ben Davis growled afresh : "
66478	66530	66570	66570	dey	2394	" The Jew laughed softly , the Welsher grimly , at the compliment they paid the Church . Baroni put up his papers into a neat Russia letter - book . Excellently dressed , without a touch of flashiness , he did look eminently respectable,—and he lingered a moment , — — "
66573	66602	66786	66788	Dat big shild	2402	" Ben Davis took his legs off the table with a crash , and stood up , flushed , thirstily eager , almost aggressive in his peremptory excitement . "
66728	66785	66790	66791	a fool	6630	" The intense malignity , the brutal hungry lust for vengeance that inspired the words , lent their coarse vulgarity something that was for the moment almost tragical in its strength , almost horrible in its passion . Ezra Baroni looked at him quietly , then without another word went out — to a congenial task . "
66793	66801	67407	67407	I	0	" mused the subtler and gentler Jew . "
66832	66994	67399	67405	the Most Noble the Marquis of Rockingham	2406	" The Seraph had ridden back from Iffesheim to the Bad in company with some Austrian officers , and one or two of his own comrades . He had left the course late , staying to exhaust every possible means of inquiry as to the failure of Forest King , and to discuss with other members of the Newmarket and foreign jockey clubs the best methods — if method there were — of discovering what foul play had been on foot with the horse . That there was some , and very foul too , the testimony of men and angels would not have dissuaded the Seraph , and the event had left him most unusually grave and regretful . The amount he had lost himself , in consequence , was of not the slightest moment to him , although he was extravagant enough to run almost to the end even of his own princely tether in money matters ; but that "
66996	67398	67452	67452	Rock	484	" should be cut down was more vexatious to him than any evil accident that could have befallen himself , and he guessed pretty nearly the fatal influence the dead failure would have on his friend 's position . True , he had never heard Cecil breathe a syllable that hinted at embarrassment ; but these things get known with tolerable accuracy about the town , and those who were acquainted , as most people in their set were , with the impoverished condition of the Royallieu Exchequer , however hidden it might be under an unabated magnificence of living , were well aware also that none of the old Viscount 's sons could have any safe resources to guarantee them from as rapid a ruin as they liked to consummate . Indeed , it had of late been whispered that it was probable , despite the provisions of the entail , that all the green wealth and Norman beauty of Royallieu itself would come into the market . Hence the Seraph , the best - hearted and most generous - natured of men , was worried by an anxiety and a despondency which he would never have indulged most assuredly on his own account , as he rode away from Iffesheim after the defeat of his Corps ' champion . He was expected to dinner with one of the most lovely of foreign Ambassadresses , and was to go with her afterwards to the Vaudeville , at the pretty golden theatre , where a troupe from the Bouffes were playing ; but he felt anything but in the mood for even her bewitching and — in a marriageable sense — safe society , as he stopped his horse at his own hotel , the Badischer Hof . As he swung himself out of saddle , a well - dressed , quiet , rather handsome little man drew near respectfully , lifting his hat,—it was M. Baroni . The Seraph had never seen the man in his life that he knew of , but he was himself naturally frank , affable , courteous , and never given to hedging himself behind the pale of his high rank ; provided you did not bore him , you might always get access to him easily enough — the Duke used to tell him , too easily . Therefore , when Ezra Baroni deferentially approached "
67410	67451	67452	67452	Rock	484	" the Seraph , instead of leaving the stranger there discomfited , nodded and paused with his inconsequent good nature , thinking how much less bosh it would be if everybody could call him like his family and his comrades , "
67454	67455	67452	67452	Rock	484	" "
67461	67465	67473	67473	you	0	" he answered . "
67479	67489	67491	67491	him	2408	" The Seraph had a vivid terror of people who "
67493	67516	67584	67584	your	0	" in the subscription , not the police , sense of the word ; and had been the victim of frauds innumerable . "
67520	67546	67553	67554	your Lordship	2409	" returned Baroni , respectfully , but with sufficient independence to conciliate his auditor , whom he saw at a glance cringing subservience would disgust , "
67560	67572	67584	67584	your	0	" The Seraph looked a little bored , a little amused . "
67587	67598	67601	67601	you	0	" he said , impatiently , yet good humoured still . "
67606	67619	67601	67601	you	0	" continued the Jew , with his strong Hebrew - German accent , "
67636	67687	67720	67721	my Lord	1649	" The Jew held before him a folded paper , so folded that one line only was visible , across which was dashed in bold characters , Rockingham . The Seraph put up his eye - glass , stooped , and took a steadfast look , then shook his head . "
67715	67716	67720	67721	my Lord	1649	" "
67723	67729	67741	67742	your Lordship	2409	" said Baroni , quietly . "
67753	67764	67767	67767	I	0	" The Seraph looked surprised , and reflected a moment . "
67771	67779	67810	67810	you	1649	" he said , after a pause ; "
67813	67814	67824	67824	you	1649	" "
67831	67837	67824	67824	you	1649	" The Seraph moved away . "
67842	67848	67863	67863	women	1003	" he said , briefly . "
67852	67861	67888	67889	my Lord	1649	" thought he , acting on past experience , "
67875	67884	67915	67915	I	0	" Baroni made a quick movement towards him . "
67913	67914	67915	67915	I	0	" "
67923	67938	68019	68019	My	0	" replied Rock , putting him aside ; while he thought to himself regretfully , "
67985	68018	68019	68019	My	0	" The Seraph 's good nature was apt to overlook such trifles as the Law . Baroni kept pace with him as he approached the hotel door , and spoke very low . "
68041	68068	68019	68019	My	0	" The Seraph swung round , his careless handsome face set stern in an instant , his blue eyes grave , and gathering an ominous fire . "
68072	68085	68093	68093	Alexis	613	" said , curtly , signing the Hebrew towards the grand staircase . "
68095	68223	68299	68299	I	0	" But for the publicity of the entrance of the Badischer Hof the mighty right arm of the Guardsman might have terminated the interview then and there in different fashion . Baroni had gained his point , and was ushered into the fine chambers set apart for the future Duke of Lyonnesse ; the Seraph strode after him , and as the attendant closed the door and left them alone in the first of the great lofty suite , all glittering with gilding , and ormolu , and malachite , and rose velvet , and Parisian taste , stood like a tower above the Jew 's small , slight form ; while his words came curtly , and only by a fierce effort , through his lips . "
68242	68298	68299	68299	I	0	" Baroni looked up unmoved . The calm , steady , undisturbed glance sent a chill over the Seraph ; he thought if this man came but for purposes of extortion , and were not fully sure that he could make good what he had said , this was not the look he would give . "
68307	68313	68499	68499	I	0	" said Baroni , quietly , "
68514	68588	68499	68499	I	0	" He spoke quite tranquilly still , with a perfectly respectful regret , but with the air of a man who has his title to be heard , and is acting simply in his own clear right . The Seraph listened , restless , impatient , sorely tried to keep the passion in which had been awakened by the hint that this wretched matter could concern or attaint the honour of his corps . "
68594	68600	68635	68636	my Lord	1649	" he said , impatiently . "
68626	68627	68686	68686	me	0	" "
68704	68705	68686	68686	me	0	" "
68710	68711	68686	68686	me	0	" "
68718	68724	68726	68726	yourself	1649	" added Baroni , impressively . "
68730	68755	68817	68817	I	0	" Rock dashed his hand down on the marble table with a force that made the lustres and statuettes on it ring and tremble . "
68765	68816	68941	68941	You	1649	" Baroni bowed and smoothed out upon the console the crumpled document , holding it with one hand , yet leaving visible with the counterfeited signature one other — the name of the forger in whose favour the bill was drawn . That other signature was — — Bertie Cecil . "
68834	68940	69001	69002	My Lord	1649	" said the Jew , softly . The Seraph stooped and gazed — one instant of horrified amazement kept him dumb there , staring at the written paper as at some ghastly thing ; then all the hot blood rushed over his fair , bold face , he flung himself on the Hebrew , and ere the other could have breath or warning tossed him upward to the painted ceiling and hurled him down again upon the velvet carpet , as lightly as a retriever will catch up and let fall a wild duck or a grouse , and stood over Baroni where he lay . "
68944	69000	69001	69002	My Lord	1649	" Baroni , lying passive and breathless with the violence of the shock and the surprise , yet keeping , even amidst the hurricane of wrath that had tossed him upward and downward as the winds toss leaves , his hold upon the document , and his clear , cool , ready self - possession . "
69004	69010	69033	69033	I	0	" he said , faintly , "
69041	69042	69051	69051	I	0	" "
69072	69073	69438	69438	My	0	" "
69193	69437	69527	69527	I	0	" Faint and hoarse the words were , but they were spoken with quiet confidence , with admirable acumen ; they were the very words to lash the passions of his listener into unendurable fire , yet to chain them powerless down ; the Guardsman stood above him , his features flushed and dark with rage , his eyes literally blazing with fury , his lips working under his tawny leonine beard . At every syllable he could have thrown himself afresh upon the Jew and flung him out of his presence as so much carrion ; yet the impotence that truth so often feels caught and meshed in the coils of subtlety , the desperate disadvantage at which Right is so often placed when met by the cunning science and sophistry of Wrong , held the Seraph in their net now . He saw his own rashness , he saw how his actions could be construed till they cast a slur even on the man he defended , he saw how legally he was in error , how legally the gallant vengeance of an indignant friendship might be construed into consciousness of guilt in the accused for whose sake the vengeance fell . He stood silent , overwhelmed with the intensity of his own passion , baffled by the ingenuity of a serpent - wisdom he could not refute . Ezra Baroni saw his advantage : he ventured to raise himself slightly . "
69473	69526	69527	69527	I	0	" The tone was perfectly impassive , but the words expressed a world . For a moment the Seraph 's eyes flashed on him with a look that made him feel nearer his death than he had been near to it in all his days ; but Rockingham restrained himself from force . "
69533	69597	69850	69850	Cecil	403	" he said , briefly ; in that answer there was more of menace and of meaning than in any physical action . He moved , and let Baroni rise , shaken and bruised , but otherwise little seriously hurt , and still holding , in a tenacious grasp , the crumpled paper . He rang ; his own servant answered the summons . "
69632	69849	70004	70004	You	403	" The servant bowed and withdrew ; a perfect silence followed between these two so strangely assorted companions ; the Seraph stood with his back against the mantelpiece , with every sense on the watch to catch every movement of the Jew 's , and to hear the first sound of Cecil 's approach . The minutes dragged on , the Seraph was in an agony of probation and impatience . Once the attendants entered to light the chandeliers and candelabra ; the full light fell on the dark , slight form of the Hebrew , and on the superb attitude , and the fair , frank , proud face of the standing Guardsman ; neither moved . Once more they were left alone . The moments ticked slowly away one by one , audible in the silence . Now and then the quarters chimed from the clock ; it was the only sound in the chamber . The door opened.—Cecil entered . The Seraph crossed the room , with his hand held out ; not for his life in that moment would he have omitted that gesture of friendship . Involuntarily he started and stood still one instant in amaze ; the next he flung thought away , and dashed into swift , inconsequent words . "
70016	70190	70292	70292	you	403	" The incoherent address poured out from his lips in a breathless torrent ; he had never been so excited in his life ; and he pleaded with as imploring an earnestness as though he had been the suspected criminal , not to be accused with having one shadow of shameful doubt against his friend . His words would have told nothing except bewilderment to one who should have been a stranger to the subject on which he spoke ; yet Cecil never asked even what he meant . There was no surprise upon his face , no flush of anger , no expression of amaze or indignation , only the look which had paralysed Rock on his entrance ; he stood still and mute . The Seraph looked at him , a great dread seizing him lest he should have seemed himself to cast this foul thing on his brother - in - arms ; and in that dread all the fierce fire of his freshly - loosened passion broke its bounds . "
70299	70328	70353	70353	You	403	" He swung round at the last words , and signed to Baroni to rise from the couch where he sat . The Jew advanced slowly , softly . "
70368	70391	70425	70425	Cecil	403	" The Seraph 's eyes flashed on him with a light like a lion 's , and his right hand clenched hard . "
70433	70601	70612	70613	Mr. Cecil	403	" Bertie had not moved ; not a breath escaped his lips . He stood like a statue , deadly pale in the gaslight ; when the figure of Baroni rose up and came before him , a great darkness stole on his face — it was a terrible bitterness , a great horror , a loathing disgust ; but it was scarcely criminality , and it was not fear . Still he stood perfectly silent — a guilty man , any other than his loyal friend would have said ; guilty , and confronted with a just accuser . The Seraph saw that look , and a deadly chill passed over him , as it had done at the Jew 's first charge — not doubt ; such heresy to his creeds , such shame to his comrade and his corps could not be in him , but a vague dread hushed his impetuous vehemence . The dignity of the old Lyonnesse blood asserted its ascendancy . "
70618	70657	70740	70740	I	0	" Cecil never moved ; once his eyes went to Rockingham with a look of yearning , grateful , unendurable pain , but it was repressed instantly ; a perfect passiveness was on him . The Jew smiled . "
70745	70746	70930	70930	Bertie	628	" "
70750	70929	70954	70954	you	628	" The echo of those words alone escaped the dry white lips of Cecil ; he showed no amaze , no indignation ; once only , as the charge was made , he gave a sudden gesture , with a sudden gleam , so dark , so dangerous , in his eyes , that his comrade thought and hoped that with one moment more the Jew would be dashed down at his feet with the lie branded on his mouth by the fiery blow of a slandered and outraged honour . The action was repressed ; the extraordinary quiescence , more hopeless , because more resigned than any sign of pain or of passion , returned either by force of self - control or by the stupor of despair . The Seraph gazed at him with a fixed , astounded horror ; he could not believe his senses ; he could not realise what he saw . His dearest friend stood mute beneath the charge of lowest villany — stood powerless before the falsehoods of a Jew extortioner ! "
70935	70945	71182	71182	I	0	" he cried , well - nigh beside himself , "
70999	71181	71215	71215	Beauty	409	" He had looked for the rise of the same passion that rang in his own imperious words , for the fearless wrath of an insulted gentleman , the instantaneous outburst of a contemptuous denial , the fire of scorn , the lightning flash of fury — all that he gave himself , all that must be so naturally given by a slandered man under a libel that brands him with disgrace . He had looked for these as surely as he looked for the setting of one sun and the rise of another ; he would have staked his life on the course of his friend 's conduct as he would upon his own , and a ghastly terror sent a pang to his heart . Still — Cecil stood silent ; there was a strange , set , repressed anguish on his face that made it chill as stone ; there was an unnatural calm upon him ; yet he lifted his head with a gesture haughty for the moment as any action that his defender could have wished . "
71187	71214	71226	71226	you	0	" he said , simply . The Seraph 's hands were on his own in a close , eager grasp almost ere the words were spoken . "
71234	71265	71226	71226	you	0	" For a moment Cecil 's head sank , the dignity with which he had spoken remained on him , but the scorn of his defiance and his denial faded . "
71276	71312	71332	71332	Your	0	" The words were spoken almost mechanically , like a man in a dream . Ezra Baroni , standing calmly there with the tranquillity that an assured power alone confers , smiled slightly once more . "
71335	71336	71339	71339	I	0	" "
71345	71358	71451	71451	you	0	" Baroni bowed , with a sneer at once insolent but subdued . "
71456	71469	71483	71483	I	0	" The Seraph turned on him with the fierceness of a bloodhound . "
71495	71518	71523	71523	I	0	" Baroni laughed a little ; he felt secure now , and could not resist the pleasure of braving and of torturing the "
71521	71522	71578	71578	We	2483	" "
71567	71577	71578	71578	We	2483	" The Seraph ground his heel into the carpet . "
71585	71592	71614	71614	I	0	" he said abruptly to Cecil . "
71610	71611	71614	71614	I	0	" "
71620	71624	71614	71614	I	0	" murmured Baroni . "
71632	71674	71698	71699	my partner	2486	" Into Bertie 's eyes came a hunted , driven desperation . He turned them on Rockingham with a look that cut him to the heart ; yet the abhorrent thought crossed him — was it thus that men guiltless looked ? "
71707	71721	71698	71699	my partner	2486	" pursued the soft , bland , malicious voice of the German Jew . "
71739	71740	71698	71699	my partner	2486	" "
71746	71755	71774	71774	you	7440	" said the Seraph , with impetuous certainty . "
71782	71783	71774	71774	you	7440	" "
71787	71788	71791	71791	you	7440	" "
71793	71798	71826	71834	thousands of people who 'll prove it for you	2492	" pursued his friend . "
71836	71862	71826	71834	thousands of people who 'll prove it for you	2492	" Cecil stood mute still ; his teeth clenched on his under lip ; he could not speak;—a woman 's reputation lay in his silence . "
71868	71873	71826	71834	thousands of people who 'll prove it for you	2492	" implored the Seraph . "
71882	71969	71992	71992	I	0	" There was a feverish entreaty in his voice . That hunted helplessness with which a question so slight yet so momentous was received , was forcing in on him a thought that he flung away like an asp . Cecil looked both of them full in the eyes — both his accuser and his friend . He was held as speechless as though his tongue were paralysed ; he was bound by his word of honour ; he was weighted with a woman 's secret . "
71990	71991	71999	71999	I	0	" "
72004	72046	72064	72064	I	0	" The words were calm ; there was a great resolve in them , moreover ; but his voice was hoarse and his lips shook . He paid a bitter price for the butterfly pleasure of a summer - day love . "
72062	72063	72064	72064	I	0	" "
72074	72155	72196	72197	Mr. Cecil	403	" There was an almost fierce and sullen desperation in the answer ; its firmness was not shaken , but the ordeal was severe . A woman 's reputation,—a thing so lightly thrown away with an idler 's word , a Lovelace 's smile!—that was all he had to sacrifice to clear himself from the toils gathering around him . That was all ! And his word of honour . Baroni bent his head with an ironic mockery of sympathy . "
72214	72215	72196	72197	Mr. Cecil	403	" "
72221	72252	72352	72352	You	2499	" The request was peremptory to imperiousness , yet Cecil would have faced his death far sooner than he would have looked upon that piece of paper . Baroni smiled . "
72314	72351	72352	72352	You	2499	" He could not deny himself the pleasure and the rarity of insolence to the men before him , so far above him in social rank , yet at that juncture so utterly at his mercy . "
72365	72375	72406	72406	I	0	" thundered Rockingham in the magnificence of his wrath . "
72414	72437	72438	72438	I	0	" The Jew quailed under the fierce flashing of those leonine eyes . He bowed with that tact which never forsook him . "
72449	72540	72438	72438	I	0	" he said , as he spread out the bill on the console . He was an able diplomatist . Cecil leaned forward and looked at the signatures dashed across the paper ; both who saw him saw also the shiver , like a shiver of intense cold , that ran through him as he did so , and saw his teeth clench tight , in the extremity of rage , in the excess of pain , or — to hold in all utterance that might be on his lips . "
72543	72675	72708	72708	I	0	" asked the Seraph , in a breathless anxiety . He knew not what to believe , what to do , whom to accuse , or how to unravel this mystery of villany and darkness ; but he felt , with a sickening reluctance which drove him wild , that his friend did not act in this thing as he should have acted ; not as men of assured innocence and secure honour act beneath such a charge . Cecil was unlike himself , unlike every deed and word of his life , unlike every thought of the Seraph 's fearless expectance , when he had looked for the coming of the accused as the signal for the sure and instant unmasking , condemnation , and chastisement of the false accuser . "
72694	72707	72719	72719	I	0	" asked the bland , sneering , courteous voice of Ezra Baroni . "
72729	72822	72848	72848	I	0	" The answer was firmly given , the old blaze of scorn came again in his weary eyes , and his regard met calmly and unflinchingly the looks fastened on him ; but the nerves of his lips twitched , his face was haggard as by a night 's deep gambling ; there was a heavy dew on his forehead;—it was not the face of a wholly guiltless , of a wholly unconscious man ; often even as innocence may be unwittingly betrayed into what wears the semblance of self - condemnation . "
72846	72847	72857	72857	you	2503	" "
72860	72943	72857	72857	you	2503	" There was a sternness inflexible as steel in the brief sentence . Under it for an instant , though not visibly , Baroni flinched ; and a fear of the man he accused smote him , more deep , more keen than that with which the sweeping might of the Seraph 's fury had moved him . He knew now why Ben Davis had hated with so deadly a hatred the latent strength that slept under the Quietist languor and nonchalance of "
72952	72968	72975	72975	you	2503	" What he felt , however , did not escape him by the slightest sign . "
72979	72991	73006	73006	we	2505	" he said , with a polite wave of his hand . "
73014	73041	73043	73043	Baroni	619	" The Seraph 's grand rolling voice broke in ; he had stood chafing , chained , panting , in agonies of passion and of misery . "
73045	73071	73259	73259	They	2509	" he said , hotly , the furious vehemence of his anger and his bewilderment obscuring in him all memory of either law or fact , "
73206	73258	73259	73259	They	2509	" He scarcely knew what he was saying , yet what he did say , utterly as it defied all checks of law or circumstance , had so gallant a ring , had so kingly a wrath , that it awed and impressed even Baroni in the instant of its utterance . "
73276	73280	73288	73288	My	0	" he thought . "
73286	73287	73298	73298	you	1649	" "
73291	73297	73430	73430	we	2515	" he said , softly , "
73438	73439	73430	73430	we	2515	" "
73442	73552	73430	73430	we	2515	" The echo rang in an absolute agony from his hearer ; he had thought of it as , at its worst , only a question between himself and Cecil . The accused gave no sign , the rigidity and composure he had sustained throughout did not change ; but at the Seraph 's accent the hunted and pathetic misery which had once before gleamed in his eyes came there again ; he held his comrade in a loyal and exceeding love . He would have let all the world stone him , but he could not have borne that his friend should cast even a look of contempt . "
73555	73561	73713	73713	I	0	" replied Baroni , quietly . "
73728	74000	74034	74035	no one	6373	" A dead silence followed his words , the silence that follows on an insult that can not be averted or avenged , on a thing too hideously shameful for the thoughts to grasp it as reality . In the first moment of Baroni 's words , Cecil 's eyes had gleamed again with that dark and desperate flash of a passion that would have been worse to face even than his comrade 's wrath ; it died , however , well - nigh instantly , repressed by a marvellous strength of control , whatever its motive . He was simply , as he had been throughout , passive ; so passive that even Ezra Baroni , who knew what the Seraph never dreamt , looked at him in wonder , and felt a faint sickly fear of that singular unbroken calm . It perplexed him ; the first thing which had ever done so in his own peculiar paths of finesse and of intrigue . The one placed in ignorance between them , at once as it were the judge and champion of his brother - at - arms , felt wild and blind under this unutterable shame , which seemed to net them both in such close and hopeless meshes . He , heir to one of the greatest coronets in the world , must see his friend branded as a common felon , and could do no more to aid or to avenge him than if he were a charcoal - burner toiling yonder in the pine woods ! His words were hoarse and broken as he spoke : "
74030	74031	74034	74035	no one	6373	" "
74037	74121	74123	74123	me	0	" Bertie 's voice was slightly weaker , like that of a man exhausted by a long struggle , but it was firm and very quiet . Its composure fell on Rockingham 's tempestuous grief and rage with a sickly , silencing awe , with a sense of some evil here beyond his knowledge and ministering , and of an impotence alike to act and to serve , to defend and to avenge — the deadliest thing his fearless life had ever known . "
74128	74132	74159	74159	I	0	" interposed Baroni , "
74157	74158	74188	74188	I	0	" "
74161	74187	74263	74263	your	1649	" The Seraph 's majesty of haughtiest amaze and scorn blazed from his azure eyes on the man who dared say this thing to him . "
74259	74260	74293	74293	Unable	630	" "
74291	74292	74416	74416	I	0	" "
74333	74415	74416	74416	I	0	" Cecil would more willingly have stood a line of levelled rifle - tubes aimed at his heart than that passionate entreaty from the man he loved best on earth . He staggered slightly , as if he were about to fall , and a faint white foam came on his lips ; but he recovered himself almost instantly . It was so natural to him to repress every emotion , that it was simply old habit to do so now . "
74420	74429	74416	74416	I	0	" he said very low , each word a pang—"I
74433	74448	74477	74477	I	0	" Baroni waved his hand again , with the same polite , significant gesture . "
74475	74476	74477	74477	I	0	" "
74483	74526	74477	74477	I	0	" The reply was very tranquil , but in the look that met his own as it was given , Baroni saw that some other motive than that of any fear was its spring ; that some cause beyond the mere abhorrence of "
74529	74538	74477	74477	I	0	" was at the root of the quiescence . "
74544	74552	74603	74603	God	565	" said Cecil huskily to his friend . "
74598	74599	74648	74648	You	409	" "
74652	74653	74654	74654	I	0	" "
74660	74696	74848	74848	you	409	" The Seraph gave him a rapid , shuddering glance ; for once the suspicion crept in on him — was this guilt ? Yet even now the doubt would not be harboured by him . "
74800	74841	74968	74968	he	403	here!"—he went to a writing - cabinet at the end of the room , flung the lid back , swept out a herd of papers , and wrenching a blank cheque from its book , threw it down before Baroni ; "
74922	74930	74968	74968	he	403	" wring the fine - feathered bird , "
74960	74967	74968	74968	he	403	" God bless you , Rock , "
74982	74990	75000	75001	the Marquis	6804	" but you must not do that . "
74991	74998	75000	75001	the Marquis	6804	" Beauty , are you mad ? "
75005	75131	75171	75171	he	625	" If this villanous thing be a forgery , you are its victim as much as I — tenfold more than I. If this Jew choose to sell the paper to me , naming his own compensation , whose affair is it except his and mine ? They have been losers , we indemnify them . It rests with us to find out the criminal . M. Baroni , there are a hundred more cheques in that book , name your price , and you shall have it ; or , if you prefer my father 's , I will send to him for it . His Grace will sign one without a question of its errand , if I ask him , Come!—your price ? "
75155	75170	75171	75171	he	625	" You behave most nobly , most generously by your friend , my Lord , "
75176	75291	75321	75321	Cecil	403	" I am glad such friendship exists on earth . But you really ask me what is not in my power . In the first place , I am but one of a firm , and have no authority to act alone ; in the second , I most certainly , were I alone , should decline totally any pecuniary compromise . A great criminal action is not to be hushed up by any monetary arrangement . You , my Lord Marquis , may be ignorant , in the Guards , of a very coarse term used in law called ' compounding with felony . ' That is to what you tempt me now . "
75348	75395	75427	75427	He	6132	" Make no opposition . The man is acting but in his own justification . I will wait for mine . To resist would be to degrade us with a bully 's brawl ; they have the law with them . Let it take its course . "
75417	75426	75501	75501	he	6132	" Oh , God ! that you — — "
75507	75515	75546	75546	His	6132	" Will you take it — still ? "
75534	75545	75667	75667	he	403	" Take it?—Before all the world — always,—come what will . "
75677	75685	75691	75691	Rockingham	462	" M. Baroni , I am ready . "
75686	75689	75702	75703	The Hebrew	7428	" Wait ! "
75693	75701	75702	75703	The Hebrew	7428	" Where you go , I come . "
75707	75816	75890	75890	his	625	" Forgive me , my Lord — not now . You can take what steps you will as regards your friend later on ; and you may rest assured he will be treated with all delicacy compatible with the case , but you can not accompany him now . I rely on his word to go with me quietly , but I now regard him , and you must remember this , as not the son of Viscount Royallieu — not the Honourable Bertie Cecil , of the Life Guards — not the friend of one so distinguished as yourself , — but as simply an arrested forger . "
75885	75888	75894	75894	he	625	" Gentlemen , "
75897	75910	75926	75926	His	628	" one sign of violence , and I shall summon legal force . "
75951	75993	77710	77710	he	628	" We degrade ourselves by resistance . Let me go — they must do what they will . My reckoning must wait , and my justification . One word only : take the King , and keep him for my sake . "
77699	77709	79292	79292	they	2683	" It is for her sake — and his , "
79305	79311	79292	79292	they	2683	" Is he up there ? "
79319	79332	79292	79292	they	2683	" Not likely . A cat could n't scramble up that woodwork , "
79337	79345	79515	79516	the chief	2694	" Send a shot , and try , "
79499	79509	79515	79516	the chief	2694	" He 's not there , at any rate , "
79518	79552	80549	80549	he	628	" he could n't have kept as still as that with a shot so near him . He 's made for the open country and the forest , I 'll take my oath . "
80539	80548	80823	80823	he	628	" Tell Count Carl I have borrowed these , "
80815	80822	80823	80823	he	628	" You promised me this waltz , "
80831	80840	80884	80884	She	2726	" I have come in time for it . "
80868	80883	80912	80912	she	2726	" Forgive me , and let me have this one waltz — please do ! "
80898	80911	80934	80934	he	628	" No one has my step as you have it , Bertie , "
80937	80945	81475	81475	he	628	" No?—but others will soon learn it . "
81480	81485	81580	81581	the man	6254	" money - down , "
81593	81606	81754	81754	Rake	399	" Sir!—no words . Follow me , and I 'll save you . "
81741	81752	81754	81754	Rake	399	" Into saddle , sir ! quick as your life ! "
81756	81771	81772	81772	Cecil	628	" We 'll be far away from this d — d den by morning . "
81791	81809	81884	81885	The King	6139	" He can have no stay in him ? He was dead - beat on the course . "
81810	81883	81906	81906	he	6139	" I know he was , sir ; but he ai n't now ; he was pisoned ; but I 've a trick with a ' oss that 'll set that sort o ' thing — if it ai n't gone too far , that is to say — right in a brace of shakes . I doctored him ; he 's hisself agen ; he 'll take you till he drops . "
81909	81913	81922	81922	Cecil	628	" Try me ! "
81914	81921	81922	81922	Cecil	628	" God bless you , Rake ! "
81927	81950	81983	81983	Rake	399	" But I can not take him ; he will starve with me . And — how did you know of this ? "
81951	81981	81983	81983	Rake	399	" Beggin ' your pardon , your honour , he 'll eat chopped furze with you better than he 'll eat oats and hay along of a new master , "
81991	82153	82155	82155	yourself	2760	" I do n't know nothin' , sir , save that I heard you was in a strait ; I do n't want to know nothin' ; but I sees them cursed cads a runnin ' of you to earth , and thinks I to myself , ' Come what will , the King will be the ticket for him . ' So I ran to your room unbeknown , packed a little valise , and got out the passports , then back again to the stables , and saddled him like lightnin ' , and got 'em off , nobody knowing but Bill there . I seed you go by into the Kursaal , and laid in wait for you , sir . I made bold to bring Mother o ' Pearl for myself . ' And Rake stopped , breathless and hoarse with passion and grief that he would not utter . He had heard more than he said . "
82157	82161	82198	82199	Lord Rockingham	462	" echoed Cecil . "
82208	82225	82311	82311	Rake	399	" The ci - devant soldier struck his heel into the earth with a fiery oath . "
82291	82310	82347	82347	I	0	" Cecil 's voice shook as he answered . The fidelity touched him as adversity could not do . "

82369	82370	82347	82347	I	0	" "
82378	82431	82347	82347	I	0	" answered Cecil . As things have turned — life is over with me , Rake . What my own fate may be I have not the faintest notion — but let it be what it will , it must be a bitter one . I will not drag another into it . "
82432	82453	82347	82347	I	0	" If you send me away , I 'll shoot myself through the head , sir , that 's all . "
82454	82488	82503	82503	Rake	399	" You will do nothing of the kind . Go to Lord Rockingham , and ask him from me to take you into his service . You can not have a kinder master . "
82489	82501	82503	82503	Rake	399	" I do n't say nothing agen the Marquis , sir , "
82507	82626	82700	82700	he	399	" he 's a right - on generous gentleman , but he are n't you . Let me go with you , if it 's just to rub the King down . Lord , sir ! you do n't know what straits I 've lived in — what a lot of things I can turn my hand to — what a one I am to fit myself into any rat - hole , and make it spicy . Why , sir , I 'm that born scamp I am — I'm a deal happier on the cross and getting my bread just anyhow , than I am when I 'm in clover like you 've kep ' me . "
82689	82699	82700	82700	he	399	" I thank you from my heart , Rake , "
82705	82723	82735	82735	Rake	399	" but it must not be . I tell you my future life will be beggary — — "
82724	82733	82700	82700	he	399	" You 'll want me anyways , sir , "
82745	82896	82912	82912	himself	399	" I ask your pardon for interruptin ' , but every second 's that precious like . Besides , sir , I 've got to cut and run for my own sake . I 've laid Willon 's head open down there in the loose box ; and when he 's come to himself a pretty hue and cry he 'll raise after me . He painted the King , that 's what he did ; and I told him so , and I gev ' it to him — one — two — amazin ' ! Get into saddle , sir , for the Lord 's sake ! and here , Bill — you run back , shut the door , and do n't let nobody know the ' osses are out till the mornin ' . Then look like a muff as you are , and say nothin' ! "
82918	82982	83015	83015	Rake	399	" Now , sir ! a steeple - chase for our lives ! We 'll be leagues away by the day - dawn , and I 've got their feed in the saddle - bags , so that they 'll bait in the forests . Off , sir , for God 's sake , or the blackguards will be down on you again ! "
83026	83092	83638	83639	Forest King	414	" There they come — the d — d beaks ! For the love of mercy , sir , do n't check now . Ten seconds more and they 'll be on you ; off , off!—or by the Lord Harry , sir , you 'll make a murderer of me , and I 'll kill the first man that lays his hand on you ! "
83624	83637	83643	83643	he	414	" I failed him to - day through my foes and his , "
83653	83668	83892	83893	the King	6139	" But I love him well ; I will save him to - night . "
83873	83890	84086	84086	Cecil	628	" If I were what I was yesterday , she would n't run even with me , "
84128	84131	84292	84292	he	628	" harking back "
84283	84291	84571	84571	he	628	" He is not quite himself yet , "
84597	84655	84571	84571	he	628	" Rake , listen , and do precisely what I bid you , neither more nor less . The horses can not accompany me , nor you either ; I must go henceforth where they would starve , and you would do worse . I do not take the King into suffering , nor you into temptation . "
84669	84672	84691	84691	Cecil	628	" attention , "
84697	84808	84814	84814	his	2830	" I have decided ; nothing you can say will alter me . We are near a by - station now ; if I find none there to prevent me , I shall get away by the first train ; to hide in these woods is out of the question . You will return by easy stages to Baden , and take the horses at once to Lord Rockingham . They are his now . Tell him my last wish was that he should take you into his service ; and he will be a better master to you than I have ever been ; as for the King — — "
84822	84931	84966	84966	Cecil	628	" he will be safe with him . I shall go into some foreign service — Austrian , Russian , Mexican , whichever be open to me . I would not risk such a horse as mine to be sold , ill - treated , tossed from owner to owner , sent in his old age to a knacker 's yard , or killed in a skirmish by a cannon - shot . Take both him and the mare back , and go back yourself . Believe me , I thank you from my heart for your noble offer of fidelity , but accept it I never shall . "
84978	85115	85243	85243	he	399	" My good fellow , do not regret it , or fancy I have no gratitude to you . I feel your loyalty deeply , and I know all you would willingly suffer for me ; but it must not be . The mere offer of what you would do , has been quite testimony enough of your truth and your worth . It is impossible for me to tell you what has so suddenly changed my fortunes ; it is sufficient that for the future I shall be , if I live , what you were , — a private soldier in any army that needs a sword . But let my fate be what it will , I go to it alone . Spare me more speech , and simply obey my last command . "
85231	85237	85780	85780	Rake	399	" Very well , sir ; "
85766	85778	85793	85794	the hunter	2066	" He 's forgot me right and away in the King , "
85806	85841	86477	86477	he	462	" Well , it 's only natural like . I 've cause to care for him , and plenty on it ; but he ai n't no sort of reason to think about me . "
86470	86476	86477	86477	he	462	" It do n't matter , "
86508	86573	86770	86774	the man in south German	2886	" I was going to the bad of my own accord ; I must have cut and run for the debts , if not for this ; it would have been the same thing , anyway , so it 's just as well to do it for them . Life 's over , and I 'm a fool that I do n't shoot myself . "
86751	86768	86896	86896	Bertie	628	" I 'll give you one if you 'll bring me down that hen - harrier , "
86879	86894	86932	86932	He	628	" You might have let me buy my breakfast without making me do murder , "
86957	86981	87126	87126	he	6835	" That is worth fifty double - Fredericks ; will you take it in exchange for your rifle and some powder and ball ? "
87120	87125	87126	87126	he	6835	" Hein ! hein ! "
87142	87196	87528	87528	he	628	" I never saw such a with - lavishness - wasteful - and - with - courteous - speech - laconic gentleman ! I wish I had not let him have the gun ; he will take his own life , belike . Ach , Gott ! he will take his own life ! "
87519	87522	87846	87846	he	628	" Milor , "
87853	87861	88000	88000	he	628	" To the farthest place it goes , "
88010	88013	88014	88014	Rake	399	" Rake ! "
88023	88032	88014	88014	Rake	399	" It 's I , sir!—yes , sir . "
88039	88047	88060	88061	the exsoldier	2922	" You ! You had my orders ? "
88048	88058	88066	88066	he	2922	" Yes , sir , I had your orders , "
88079	88161	88541	88541	Rake	399	" and they was the first I ever disobeyed — they was . You see , sir , they was just what I could n't swallow nohow — that 's the real right down fact ! Send me to the devil , Mr. Cecil , for you , and I 'll go at the first biddin ' , but leave you just when things are on the cross for you , damn me if I will!—beggin ' your pardon , sir ! "
88210	88540	88597	88597	Rake	399	" Damn me if I will , Mr. Cecil ! You wo n't keep me — very well ; but you ca n't prevent me follerin ' of you , and foller you I will ; and so there 's no more to be said about it , sir , but just to let me have my own lark , as one may say . You said you 'd go to the station , I went there ; you took your ticket , I took my ticket . I 've been travelling behind you till about two hours ago , then I looked at you , you was asleep , sir . ' I do n't think my master 's quite well , ' says I to Guard , ' I 'd like to get in there along of him . ' ' Get in with you , then , ' says he ( only we was jabbering that willainous tongue o ' theirs ) , for he sees the name on my traps is the same as that on your traps — and in I get . Now , Mr. Cecil , let me say one word for all , and do n't think I 'm a insolent ne'er - do - weel for having been and gone and disobeyed you ; but you was good to me when I was sore in want of it ; you was even good to my dog — rest his soul , the poor beast ! there never were a braver!—and stick to you I will , till you kick me away like a cur . The truth is , it 's only being near of you , sir , that keeps me straight ; if I was to leave you , I should become a bad ' un again , right and away . Do n't send me from you , sir , as you took mercy on me once ! "
88602	88649	88662	88662	His	399	" No , sir ; you 're a gentleman , and I 've been an awful scamp ! It 's enough honour for me that you would do it . When I 'm more worth it , ' phraps — but that wo n't never be . "
88650	88661	88668	88669	the man	6254	" You are worth it now , my gallant fellow . "
88676	88694	88704	88704	Rake	399	" It was only for yourself , Rake , that I ever wished you to leave me . "
88695	88702	88704	88704	Rake	399	" God bless you , sir , "
88708	88817	88838	88838	he	399	" them words are better nor ten tosses of brandy ! You see , sir , I 'm so spry and happy in a wild life , I am , and if so be as you go to them American parts as you spoke on , why I know 'em just as well as I know Newmarket Heath , every bit ! They 're terrible rips in them parts , kill you as soon as look at you ; it makes things uncommon larky out there , uncommon spicy . You are n't never sure but what there 's a bowie - knife a - waiting for you . "
88830	88836	88896	88896	he	403	" feeling like a fool , "
88900	88908	88909	88909	Rake	399	" The King ? Where is he ? "
88917	88928	88896	88896	he	403	" Beggin ' your pardon , sir , behind you . "
88929	88933	88909	88909	Rake	399	" Behind me ? "
88934	89130	89165	89165	Cecil	403	" Yes , sir ; him and the brown mare . I could n't do not nothin' else with 'em , you see , sir , so I shipped him along with us ; they do n't care for the train a bit , bless their hearts , and I 've got a sharp boy a minding of 'em . You can easily send 'em on to England from Paris if you 're determined to part with 'em , but you know the King always was fond of drums and trumpets and that like . You remember , sir , when he was a colt we broke him into it and taught him a bit of manoeuvring , 'cause till you found what pace he had in him , you 'd thought of makin ' a charger of him . He loves the noise of soldiering — he do ; and if he thought you was goin' away without him , he 'd break his heart , Mr. Cecil , sir . It was all I could do to keep him from follerin ' of you this morning , he sawed my arms off a'most . "
89172	89191	89273	89273	he	399	" Rake , you will do for no service , I am afraid ; you are terribly insubordinate ! "
89262	89272	89506	89506	her	649	" These things will keep him a few days , "
89511	89517	89506	89506	her	649	" To refute the charge , "
89531	89730	90725	90727	sous - officiers	2984	" I must have broken my promise to you , and have compromised your name . Keeping silence myself , but letting the trial take place , law - inquiries , so execrable and so minute , would soon have traced through others that I was with you that evening . To clear myself , I must have attainted your name with public slander , and drawn this horrible ordeal on you before the world . Let me be thought guilty . It matters little . Henceforth I shall be dead to all who know me , and my ruin would have exiled me without this . Do not let an hour of grief for me mar your peace , my dearest ; think of me with no pain , Beatrice , only with some memory of our past love . I have not strength yet to say — forget me ; and yet , — if it be for your happiness,—blot out from your remembrance all thought of what we have been to one another ; all thought of me and of my life , save to remember now and then that I was dear to you .

91089	91103	91105	91106	a third	3003	" And I think that did her spirits good , shooting that Kabyl , "
91108	91117	91124	91125	the third	2601	" By the way , did he die ? "
91118	91122	91131	91131	her	2601	" N'sais pas , "

91144	91159	91105	91106	a third	3003	" Sac à papier , yes ! Rire - pour - tout taught her . "
91160	91232	91244	91248	a sousofficier of the line	3005	" Ah ! There never was a shot like Rire - pour - tout . When he went out , he always asked his adversary , ' Where will you like it ? your lungs , your heart , your brain ? It is quite a matter of choice;'—and whichever they chose , he shot there . Le pauvre Rire - pour - tout ! he was always good - natured . "
91233	91242	91250	91251	The speaker	1408	" And did he never meet his match ? "
91268	91281	91298	91302	the irreverent piou - piou	3008	" Mon sieur ! how could he ? He was a Chasseur . "
91282	91296	91380	91380	He	663	" But if he never met his match , how did he die ? "
91337	91379	91448	91448	he	663	" A piou - piou never killed him , that I promise you . He spitted half a dozen of you before breakfast , to give him a relish . How did Rire - pourtout die ? I will tell you . "
91408	91445	91781	91781	He	3012	" He died this way , did Rire - pour - tout ! Dieu de Dieu ! a very good way to . Send us all the like when our time comes ! We were out yonder "
91467	91780	91781	91781	He	3012	" We were hunting Arabs , of course,—pot - shooting rather , as we never got nigh enough to their main body to have a clear charge at them . Rire - pour - tout grew sick of it . ' This wo n't do , ' he said ; ' here 's two weeks gone by , and I have n't shot anything but kites and jackals . I shall get my hand out . ' For Rire - pour - tout , as the army knows , somehow or other , generally potted his man every day , and he missed it terribly . Well , what did he do ? he rode off one morning and found out the Arab camp , and he waved a white flag for a parley . He did n't dismount , but he just faced the Arabs and spoke to their Sheik . ' Things are slow , ' he said to them . ' I have come for a little amusement . Set aside six of your best warriors , and I 'll fight them one after another for the honour of France , and a drink of brandy to the conqueror . ' They demurred ; they thought it unfair to him to have six to one . ' Ah ! ' he laughs , ' you have heard of Rire - pour - tout , and you are afraid ! ' That put their blood up : they said they would fight him before all his Chasseurs . ' Come , and welcome , ' said Rire - pour - tout ; ' and not a hair of your beards shall be touched except by me . ' So the bargain was made for an hour before sunset that night . Mort de Dieu ! that was a grand duel ! "
91826	92417	92782	92782	I	0	" The General was ill - pleased when he heard it , and half for arresting Rire - pour - tout ; but — sacré ! — the thing was done ; our honour was involved ; he had engaged to fight these men , and engaged for us to let them go in peace afterwards ; there was no more to be said , unless we had looked like cowards , or traitors , or both . There was a wide , level plateau in front of our camp , and the hills were at our backs — a fine field for the duello;—and , true to time , the Arabs filed on to the plain , and fronted us in a long line , with their standards , and their crescents , and their cymbals , and reed - pipes , and kettle - drums , all glittering and sounding . Sac à papier ! there was a show , and we could not fight one of them ! We were drawn up in line — Rire - pour - tout all alone , some way in advance , mounted , of course . The General and the Sheik had a conference ; then the play began . There were six Arabs picked out — the flower of the army — all white and scarlet , and in their handsomest bravery , as if they came to an aouda . They were fine men — diable ! — they were fine men . Now the duel was to be with swords ; these had been selected ; and each Arab was to come against Rire - pour - tout singly , in succession . Our trumpets sounded the pas de charge , and their cymbals clashed ; they shouted ' Fantasia ! ' and the first Arab rode at him . Rire - pour - tout sat like a rock , and lunge went his steel through the Bedouin 's lung , before you could cry holà!—a death - stroke , of course ; Rire - pour - tout always killed : that was his perfect science . Another , and another , and another came , just as fast as the blood flowed . You know what the Arabs are — vous autres ? how they wheel , and swerve , and flight flying , and pick up their sabre from the ground , while their horse is galloping ventre à terre , and pierce you here , and pierce you there , and circle round you like so many hawks ? You know how they fought Rire - pour - tout then , one after another , more like devils than men . Mort de Dieu ! it was a magnificent sight ! He was gashed here , and gashed there ; but they they could never unseat him , try how they would ; and one after another he caught them sooner or later , and sent them reeling out of their saddles , till there was a great red lake of blood all round him , and five of them lay dead or dying down in the sand . He had mounted afresh twice , three horses had been killed underneath him , and his jacket all hung in strips where the steel had slashed it . It was grand to see , and did one 's heart good ; but — ventre - bleu ! — how one longed to go in too . "
92791	92823	92782	92782	I	0	" And Claude de Chanrellon drank down his third beaker , for overmuch speech made him thirsty . The men around him emptied their glasses in honour of the dead hero . "
92835	92855	92865	92865	I	0	" they said solemnly , with almost a sigh , so tendering by their words the highest funeral oration . "
92868	92924	92931	92931	monsieur	3031	" asked a voice in very pure French . The speaker was leaning against the open door of the café ; a tall , lightly built man , dressed in a velvet shooting tunic , much the worse for wind and weather , a loose shirt , and jack - boots splashed and worn out . "
92933	92938	92939	92939	I	0	" returned the Chasseur . "
92946	92947	92960	92960	They	3032	" "

92972	92996	93007	93007	you	3028	" smiled Chanrellon , surveying the figure of the one who addressed him with a keen sense of its symmetry and its sinew . "
93013	93116	93007	93007	you	3028	" The bearded Arabs smoking their long pipes , the little piou - piou drowning his mortification in some curaçoa , the idlers reading the Akbah or the Pressc , the Chasseurs lounging over their drink , the écarté players lost in their game , all looked up at the new comer . They thought he looked a likely wearer of the dead honours of Rire - pour - tout . He did not answer the questions literally , but came over from the doorway , and seated himself at the little marble table opposite Claude , leaning his elbows on it . "

93198	93209	93210	93210	He	3037	" Chanrellon bent his bright brown eyes curiously on him . "

93236	93262	93314	93314	Monsieur	3031	" went on the other , quite quietly , quite listlessly , as though the glittering , gaslit café were not full of French soldiers . "

93316	93358	93384	93384	I	0	" cried the Chasseurs , laying their hands on their swords , fiery as lions . He looked indolently and wearily up from under the long lashes of his lids , and went on , as though they had not spoken . "
93393	93407	93459	93459	you	3043	" he said , carelessly , where he leaned over the marble table . "

93571	93578	93630	93630	Pardieu	671	" said the other , quietly . "
93613	93629	93634	93634	You	671	" A murmur of ratification ran through his listeners . Chanrellon swore a mighty oath . "

93671	93780	93784	93784	monsieur	3031	" He leant back with an apathetic indolence and indifference , oddly at contrast with the injudicious daring of his war - provoking words , and the rough campaigning that he sought . The assembled Chasseurs eyed him curiously ; they liked his manner , and they resented his first speeches ; they noted every particular about him , his delicate white hands , his weather - worn and travel - stained dress , his fair aristocratic features , his sweeping abundant beard , his careless , cool , tired , reckless way ; and they were uncertain what to make of him . The dice were brought . "
93786	93790	93840	93840	You	3055	" asked Chanrellon . "
93801	93839	93840	93840	You	3055	" He set ten Napoléons down on the table ; they were the only coins he had in the world ; it was very characteristic that he risked them . They threw the main — two sixes . "
93843	93852	93840	93840	You	3055	" he murmured , with a half smile , "
93867	93868	93840	93840	You	3055	" "
93877	93898	93916	93916	they	514	" muttered Chanrellon ; and they threw again . The Chasseur cast a five ; his was a five again . "
93908	93915	93922	93923	the Arabs	514	" said the other , listlessly ; "
93927	93979	93922	93923	the Arabs	514	" The Frenchmen laughed ; they could take a jest good - humouredly , and alone amidst so many of them he was made sacred at once by the very length of odds against him . They rattled the boxes and threw again — Chanrellon 's was three ; his two . "
93982	93986	93998	93999	poor devil	1705	" he murmured . "
94001	94021	94056	94056	You	3031	" The Chasseur leaned across the table , with his brown , fearless , sunny eyes full of pleasure . "
94043	94055	94083	94083	you	0	" He bowed more gravely than he had borne himself hitherto . "
94074	94079	94083	94083	you	0	" Chanrellon assented courteously . "
94086	94087	94090	94097	a companion who must be brigaded with me	3059	" "
94109	94110	94177	94177	I	0	" "
94167	94176	94186	94186	You	3031	" But he rose , and bowed again . "
94197	94198	94186	94186	You	3031	" "
94205	94217	94240	94241	the Arabs	514	" cried the Chasseur , eagerly , and a little annoyed . "
94243	94266	94270	94270	My	0	" He turned back and looked full in Chanrellon 's face , his own eyes a little surprised , and infinitely weary . "
94273	94350	94270	94270	My	0	" Then , without another syllable , he lounged slowly out through the soldiers and the idlers , and disappeared in the confused , din and chiar'oscuro of the gas - lit street without , through the press of troopers , grisettes , merchants , beggars , sweetmeat - sellers , lemonade - sellers , curaçoa - sellers , gaunt Bedouins , negro boys , shrieking muleteers , laughing lorettes , and glittering staff - officers . "
94355	94363	94270	94270	My	0	" he murmured to his own thoughts . "
94371	94407	94416	94417	that man	3064	" Claude de Chanrellon sat mute and amazed awhile , gazing at the open door ; then he drank a fourth beaker of champagne , and flung the emptied glass down with a mighty crash . "
94425	94468	94270	94270	My	0	" Three months later , it was guest - night in the mess - room of a certain famous light cavalry regiment , who bear the reputation of being the fastest corps in the English service . Of a truth , they do "
94470	94628	94270	94270	My	0	" a little too wildly ; and stories are told of bets over écarté in their ante - room that have been prompt extinction for ever and aye to the losers , for they rarely play money down , their stakes are too high , and moderate fortunes may go in a night with the other convenient but fatal system . But , this one indiscretion apart , they are a model corps for blood , for dash , for perfect social accord , for the finest horseflesh in the kingdom , and the best president at a mess - table that ever drilled the cook to matchlessness , and made the iced dry , and the old burgundies the admired of all new comers . Just now they had pleasant quarters enough in York , had a couple of hundred hunters , all in all , in their stalls , were showing the Ridings that they could "
94633	94759	94797	94798	the boys	6118	" and were using up their second horses with every day out , in the first of the season . A cracker over the best of the ground with the York and Ainsty , that had given two first - rate things quick as lightning , and both closed with a kill , had filled the day ; and they were dining with a fair quantity of county guests , and all the splendour of plate , and ceremony , and magnificent hospitalities which characterise those beaux sabreurs wheresoever they go . At one part of the table a discussion was going on as the claret passed around ; wines were perfection at the mess , but they drank singularly little ; it was not their "
94761	94796	94797	94798	the boys	6118	" ever to indulge in that way ; and the Chief , though lenient to looseness in all other matters , and very young for his command , would have been down like steel on "
94800	94816	94817	94817	I	0	" had any of them taken to the pastime of overmuch drinking in any shape . "
94827	94842	94817	94817	I	0	" said one of the guests , a hunting Baronet , and M. F. H. "
94853	94854	94817	94817	I	0	" "
94858	94940	94956	94957	The Dauphin	676	" assented a tall handsome man , with an habitual air of the most utterly exhausted apathy ever attained by the human features , but who , nevertheless , had been christened by the fiercest of the warrior nations of the Punjaub 3 as the Shumsheer - i - Shaitan , or Sword of the Evil One , so terrible , when he was but a boy , had the circling sweep of one back stroke of his become to them . "
94947	94955	94956	94957	The Dauphin	676	" murmured one near him , known as "
94959	94960	94978	94978	Seraph	454	" "
94984	94985	94990	94990	he	454	" "
94998	95003	95017	95017	he	454	" added a third . "

95055	95060	95086	95086	he	409	" muttered a fourth . "
95082	95083	95095	95095	Beauty?—Yes	678	" "
95089	95094	95095	95095	Beauty?—Yes	678	" pursued their guest . "

95113	95118	95124	95124	you	3072	" suggested the Baronet . "
95128	95133	95220	95220	man	6172	" murmured the Dauphin . "
95232	95251	95220	95220	man	6172	" And having given the desired evidence in lazy little intervals of speech , he took some Rhenish . "
95264	95272	95294	95294	He	517	" assented the Baronet , resignedly convinced . "
95314	95315	95294	95294	He	517	" "
95319	95324	95417	95417	Duke	455	" reflected Leo Charteris . "

95732	95741	95742	95743	Poor Beauty	682	" Laughter loud and long greeted the story . "
95745	95750	96002	96002	he	680	" said the Dauphin , "
95998	95999	96008	96008	Seraph	454	" "
96023	96024	96032	96032	he	680	" "

96150	96151	96275	96276	The deuce	6422	" "
96273	96274	96319	96319	him	680	" "
96313	96314	96334	96334	he	680	" "
96330	96331	96334	96334	he	680	" "
96338	96339	96353	96353	he	680	" "
96359	96360	96353	96353	he	680	" "
96375	96420	96423	96423	he	680	" He whom the Punjaub knew as the Sword of the Evil One , but who held in polite society the title of Lord Kergenven , drank some hock slowly , and murmured as his sole quota to the conversation very lazily and languidly : "
96430	96431	96423	96423	he	680	" "
96440	96445	96462	96462	I	0	" chorused the table ; "
96460	96461	96462	96462	I	0	" "
96470	96479	96484	96484	you	680	" murmured Kergenven , with closed slumberous eyes . "
96488	96489	96484	96484	you	680	" "
96494	96495	96498	96498	you	680	" "
96506	96516	96498	96498	you	680	" My Lord lifted his brows ever so little . "
96525	96526	96565	96565	It	3124	" "
96536	96564	96730	96730	Ker	687	" Badgered into speech , Kergenven drank a little more hock , and dropped out slowly , in the mellowest voice in the world , the following : "
96697	96726	96730	96730	Ker	687	" Exhausted with so lengthened an exposition of the charms of the vénérie and the hallali , he stopped , and dropped a walnut into some Regency sherry . "
96732	96737	96744	96744	Beauty	409	" cried the Dauphin . "
96746	96769	96744	96744	Beauty	409	" My Lord let fall a sleepy glance of surprise and of rebuke from under his black lashes , that said mutely , "
96784	96785	96744	96744	Beauty	409	" "
96789	96793	97102	97103	that fool	3140	" he murmured . "
97107	97205	97102	97103	that fool	3140	" He dropped more walnuts into his wine , wistfully recalling a mighty hero of Leicestershire fame , that had given him many a magnificent day out , and had been the idol of his stables , till in his twelfth year the noble old sorrel had been killed by a groom 's recklessness ; recklessness that met with such chastisement , as told how and why the Hill - tribes ' sobriquet had been given to the hand that would lie so long in indolent rest , to strike with such fearful force when once raised . "
97208	97215	97805	97805	Beauty	409	" he went on once more . "
97816	97865	97913	97914	Horse Guards	3160	" With which declaration of his views Kergenven lapsed into immutable silence and slumberous apathy , from whose shelter nothing could tempt him afresh ; and the Colonel , with all the rest , lounged into the ante - room , where the tables were set , and began "
97867	97912	97955	97955	'em	3162	" in earnest at sums that might sound fabulous were they written here . The players staked heavily ; but it was the galérie who watched around , making their bets , and backing their favourites , that lost on the whole the most . "
97928	97953	97998	98001	Beauty of the Brigades	3163	" murmured the Chief to Kergenven , his Major , who lifted his brows , and murmured back with the demureness of a maiden : "
97968	97997	98000	98001	the Brigades	3164	" Which possibly would not have been received with the belief desirable by the sceptics in authority . So the De Profundis was said over Bertie Cecil ; and "
98002	98043	98000	98001	the Brigades	3164	" ceased to be named in the Service , and soon ceased to be even remembered . In the steeple - chase of life there is no time to look back at the failures , who have broken down over a "
98048	98056	98068	98068	Pardieu	671	" and fallen out of the pace . "
98066	98067	98078	98079	an Arab	2101	" "
98074	98075	98078	98079	an Arab	2101	" "

98108	98109	98118	98120	a tipsy Spahis	3168	" "
98122	98553	98118	98120	a tipsy Spahis	3168	" The last crown to the chorus of applause , and insult to the circle of applauders , was launched with all the piquance of inimitable canteen - slang and camp - assurance , from a speaker who had perched astride on a broken fragment of wall , with her barrel of wine set up on end on the stones in front of her , and her six soldiers , her gros bébées as she was given maternally to calling them , lounging at their ease on the arid dusty turf below . She was very pretty , audaciously pretty , though her skin was burnt to a bright sunny brown , and her hair was cut as short as a boy 's , and her face had not one regular feature in it . But then — regularity ! who wanted it , who would have thought the most pure classic type a change for the better , with those dark , dancing , challenging eyes , with that arch , brilliant , kitten - like face , so sunny , so mignon , and those scarlet lips like a bud of camellia that were never so handsome as when a cigarette was between them , or , sooth to say , not seldom a brûle gueule itself ? She was pretty , she was insolent , she was intolerably coquettish , she was mischievous as a marmoset , she would swear if need be like a Zouave , she could fire galloping , she could toss off her brandy or her vermout like a trooper , she would on occasion clench her little brown hand and deal a blow that the recipient would not covet twice , she was an enfant de Paris , and had all its wickedness at her fingers , she would sing you guinguette songs till you were suffocated with laughter , and she would dance the cancan at the Salle de Mars with the biggest giant of a Cuirassier there . And yet , with all that , she was not wholly unsexed , with all that she had the delicious fragrance of youth , and had not left a certain feminine grace behind her , though she wore a vivandière 's uniform , and had been born in a barrack , and meant to die in a battle ; it was the blending of the two that made her piquante , made her a notoriety in her own way ; known at pleasure , and equally , in the Army of Africa as "
98556	98558	98569	98571	a tipsy Spahis	3168	" and "
98565	98566	98569	98571	a tipsy Spahis	3168	" "
98573	98619	98622	98622	Cigarette	689	" it was a cruel cut to her gros bébées , most Spahis , lying there at her feet , or rather at the foot of the wall , singing their praises — with magnanimity beyond praise — of a certain Chasseur d ' Afrique . "
98624	98635	98640	98640	thou	3171	" growled a little Zouave , known as Tata Leroux . "
98650	98651	98694	98694	He	690	" "
98671	98693	98711	98712	A woman	1012	" responded Cigarette , with a puff of her namesake ; the repartee of the camp is apt to be rough . "
98709	98710	98711	98712	A woman	1012	" "
98716	98746	98711	98712	A woman	1012	" growled the injured Tata ; whose own countenance was of the colour and well - nigh of the flatness of one of the red bricks of the wall . "
98749	98771	98808	98808	Superb	691	" said the Friend of the Flag with more expression in that single ejaculation than could be put in a volume . "
98810	98811	98872	98872	he	690	" "
98868	98869	98897	98897	he	690	" "
98904	98908	98953	98953	Arabs	514	" laughed Cigarette . "
98933	98934	98953	98953	Arabs	514	" "
98945	98946	98953	98953	Arabs	514	" "
98960	98980	99014	99014	Diable	694	" said the Amie du Drapeau , turning the tap of her barrel to replenish the wine - cup ; "
99001	99013	99450	99450	his	690	" Tata laughed , considering that he had received a compliment . "
99460	99466	99531	99532	the Englishman	3191	" Cigarette nodded and laughed . "
99497	99498	99531	99532	the Englishman	3191	" "
99503	99524	99531	99532	the Englishman	3191	" grumbled Tata , who was himself of opinion that his exploit had been worthy of the feats of Harlequin ; "
99534	99582	99629	99629	Catin	698	" Cigarette laughed saucily and heartily , tickled at the joke . Sentiment has an exquisitely ludicrous side when one is a vivandière aux yeux noirs , perched astride on a wall , and dispensing brandy - dashed wine to half a dozen sun - baked Spahis . "
99631	99653	99677	99677	thou	3195	" she sang with the richest , freshest , mellowest voice that ever chanted the deathless refrains of the French Lucilius . "
99682	99683	99687	99688	a giant	3196	" "
99690	99699	99721	99721	he	3194	" said Tata . Cigarette snapped her fingers : "
99718	99719	99735	99735	he	3194	" "
99732	99733	99735	99735	he	3194	" "
99739	99740	99751	99751	he	3194	" "

99764	99765	99767	99767	he	3194	" "
99779	99795	99871	99871	They	3203	" Under which mass of overwhelming proofs of nationality the Amie du Drapeau gave in . "
99869	99870	99871	99871	They	3203	" "
99876	99906	99907	99907	Paf!—they	700	" Cigarette tossed her nonchalant head , with a pout of her cherry lips , and a slang oath , light as a bird , wicked as a rigolbochade . "
99914	99915	99949	99949	thou	3204	" "
99964	99987	100102	100102	he	3216	" Cigarette launched a choice missile of barrack slang at an array of metaphors which their propounder thought stupendous in their brilliancy . "
100086	100099	100160	100160	he	3216	" and she checked the Noes off on her lithe brown fingers : "
100167	100168	100160	100160	he	3216	" "
100176	100198	100232	100233	the two	6357	" said the philosophic Tata , who piqued himself on being serenely cosmopolitan . Cigarette blew a contemptuous puff of smoke . "
100239	100571	100232	100233	the two	6357	" Which view of Anglo - rabies she had derived from a profound study of various vaudevilles , in which the traditional God - damn was pre - eminent in his usual hues ; and having delivered it , she sprang down from her wall , strapped on her little barillet , nodded to her gros bébées , where they lounged full length in the shadow of the stone wall , and left them to resume their game at Boc , while she started on her way , as swift and as light as a chamois , singing , with gay ringing emphasis , that echoed all down the hot and silent air , the second verse of Béranger : The song was not altogether her song , however , for she had wept for none — wept not at all : she had never shed tears in her life . A dashing , dauntless , vivacious life , just in its youth , loving plunder , and mischief , and mirth ; caring for nothing ; and always ready with a laugh , a song , a slang repartee , or a shot from the dainty pistols thrust in her sash , that a general of division had given her , whichever best suited the moment . Her mother a camp - follower , her father nobody knew who , a spoilt child of the Army from her birth , with a heart as bronzed as her cheek , and her respect for the laws of meum and tuum nil , yet with odd stray nature - sown instincts here and there , of a devil - may - care nobility , and of a wild grace that nothing could kill — Cigarette was the pet of the Army of Africa , and was as lawless as most of her patrons . She would eat a succulent duck , thinking it all the spicier because it had been a soldier 's "
100574	100789	100232	100233	the two	6357	" she would wear the gold plunder off dead Arabs ' dress , and never have a pang of conscience with it ; she would dance all night long , when she had a chance , like a little Bacchante ; she would shoot a man , if need be , with all the nonchalance in the world . She had had a thousand lovers , from handsome Marquises of the Guides to tawny black - browed scoundrels in the Zouaves , and she had never loved anything , except the roll of the pas de charge , and the sight of her own arch defiant face , with its scarlet lips and its short jetty hair , when she saw it by chance in some burnished cuirass , that served her for a mirror . She was more like a handsome saucy boy than anything else under the sun , and yet there was that in the pretty , impudent little Friend of the Flag that was feminine with it all — generous and graceful amidst all her boldness , and her licence , her revelries , and the unsettled life she led in the barracks and the camps , under the shadow of the eagles . Away she went , now singing — "
100808	100950	100232	100233	the two	6357	" down the crooked windings , and over the ruined gardens of the old Moorish quarter of the Cashbah , the hilts of the tiny pistols glancing in the sun , and the fierce fire of the burning sunlight pouring down unheeded on the brave bright hawk eyes that had never , since they first opened to the world , drooped or dimmed for the rays of the sun , or the gaze of a lover , for the menace of death , or the presence of war . Of course , she was a little Amazon ; of course , she was a little Guerilla ; of course , she did not know what a blush meant ; of course , her thoughts were as slang and as riotous as her mutinous mischief was in its act : but she was "
100954	101096	100232	100233	the two	6357	" as she was given to say , with a toss of her curly head , and she had some of the virtues of soldiers . Soldiers had been about her ever since she first remembered having a wooden casserole for a cradle , and sucking down red wine through a pipe - stem . Soldiers had been her books , her teachers , her models , her guardians , and , later on , her lovers , all the days of her life . She had had no guiding - star except the eagles on the standards : she had had no cradle - song except the rataplan and the réveillé ; she had had no sense of duty taught her , except to face fire boldly , never to betray a comrade , and to worship but two deities , "
101099	101101	100232	100233	the two	6357	" and "
101105	101311	100232	100233	the two	6357	" Yet there were tales told in the barrack - yards and under canvas of the little Amie du Drapeau , that had a gentler side . Of how softly she would touch the wounded ; of how deftly she would cure them . Of how carelessly she would dash through under a raking fire , to take a draught of water to a dying man . Of how she had sat by an old Grenadier 's death - couch , to sing to him , refusing to stir , though it was a fête at Châlons , and she loved fêets as only a French girl can . Of how she had ridden twenty leagues on a saddleless Arab horse , to fetch the surgeon of the Spahis to a Bedouin perishing in the desert of shot wounds . Of how she had sent every sou of her money to her mother , so long as that mother lived — a brutal , drunk , vile - tongued old woman , who had beaten her oftentimes , as the sole maternal attention , when she was but an infant . These things were told of Cigarette , and with a perfect truth . She was "
101319	101459	101664	101665	a woman	1012	" as she classified herself . Her own sex would have seen no good in her ; but her comrades - at - arms could , and did . Of a surety , she missed virtues that women prize ; but , not less of a surety , had she caught some that they miss . Singing her refrain , on she dashed now , swift as a greyhound , light as a hare , glancing here and glancing there as she bounded over the picturesque desolation of the Cashbah . It was just noon , and there were few could brave the noon - heat as she did . It was very still ; there was only from a little distance the roll of the French kettle - drums where the drummers of the African regiments were practising . "
101465	101663	101916	101917	Tata Leroux	690	" cried Cigarette to herself , as her falcon - eyes darted right and left ; and , like a chamois , she leaped down over the great masses of Turkish ruins , cleared the channel of a dry water - course , and alighted just in front of a Chasseur d ' Afrique , who was sitting alone on a broken fragment of white marble , relic of some Moorish mosque , whose delicate columns , crowned with wind - sown grasses , rose behind him , against the deep intense blue of the cloudless sky . He was sitting thoughtfully enough , almost wearily , tracing figures in the dry sand of the soil with the point of his scabbard ; yet he had all the look about him of a brilliant French soldier , of one who , moreover , had seen hot and stern service . He was bronzed , but scarcely looked so after the red , brown , and black of the Zouaves and the Turco , for his skin was naturally very fair , the features delicate , the eyes very soft — for which Monsieur Tata had growled contemptuously , "
101667	101787	101800	101800	he	3220	face"—a long , silken chesnut beard swept over his chest ; and his figure , as he leaned there in the blue and scarlet and gold of the Chasseurs ' uniform , with his spurred heel thrust into the sand , and his arm resting on his knee , was , as Cigarette 's critical eye told her , the figure of a superb cavalry rider , light , supple , long of limb , wide of chest , with every sinew and nerve firm - knit as links of steel . She glanced at his hands , which were very white , despite the sun of Algiers , and the labours that fall to a private of Chasseurs . "
101791	101795	101800	101800	he	3220	" she thought , "
101803	101907	101962	101962	I!—I	0	" But the best of blood was not new to her in the ranks of the Algerian regiments ; she had known so many of them — those gilded butterflies of the Chaussée d ' Antin , those lordly spendthrifts of the vieille roche , who had served in the battalions of the demie - cavalerie , or the squadrons of the French Horse , to be thrust nameless and unhonoured into a sand - hole hastily dug with the bayonets in the hot hush of an African night . She woke him unceremoniously from his reverie , with a challenge to wine . "
101971	102017	101962	101962	I!—I	0	" He started and rose ; and , before he took the bidon , 7 bowed to her , raising his cap with a grave courteous obeisance ; a bow that had used to be noted in throne - rooms for its perfection of grace . "
102027	102033	102034	102034	You	3221	" he said , wearily . "
102040	102118	102119	102119	Morbleu	705	" Cigarette gave a little petulant twist to the tap of her wine - barrel . She was not used to that style of salutation . She half liked it , half resented it . It made her wish , with an impatient scorn for the wish , that she knew how to read , and had not her hair cut short like a boy's — a weakness the little vivandière had never been visited with before . "
102121	102127	102159	102159	one	6278	" she said , pettishly . "
102155	102156	102159	102159	one	6278	" "
102167	102242	102357	102357	They	3227	" he answered , wearily . He had danced with this girl - soldier the night before at a guinguette ball , seeing her for the first time , for it was almost the first time he had been in the city since the night when he had thrown the dice , and lost two Napoléons and the Bedouins to Claude de Chanrellon ; but his thoughts were far from her in this moment . "
102255	102356	102384	102385	A Spaniard	3228	" cried Cigarette , provoked to receive no more compliment than that . From generals and staff - officers as from drummers and trumpeters she was accustomed to flattery and wooing , luscious as sugared chocolate , and ardent as flirtation , with a barrack flavour about it , commonly is ; she would , as often as not , to be sure , finish it with the butt - end of her pistol , or the butt - end of some bit of stinging sarcasm , but still for all that she liked it , and resented its omission . "
102389	102390	102409	102410	A Greek	3230	" "
102404	102408	102409	102410	A Greek	3230	" She laughed . "
102414	102415	102420	102420	you	705	" "
102427	102428	102432	102432	You	705	" "
102440	102481	102486	102486	you	705	" He shook his head . She stamped her little foot into the ground — a foot fit for a model , with its shapely military boot ; spurred , too , for Cigarette rode like a circus - rider . "
102494	102495	102502	102502	you	705	" "
102507	102525	102502	102502	you	705	" For the first time her eyes flashed and softened — her one love was the tricolour . "
102528	102534	102557	102557	you	705	" she said , simply . "
102561	102609	102621	102622	a fool	6630	" She here cast herself down in front of him , and , with her elbows on the sand , and her chin on her hands , watched him with all the frank curiosity and unmoved nonchalance imaginable , as she launched the question point - blank . "
102612	102618	102621	102622	a fool	6630	" he said , slowly . "
102624	102625	102626	102626	You	705	" "
102634	102655	102732	102732	Pardieu	671	" said Cigarette , with a piquance made a thousand times more piquant by the camp slang she spoke in . "
102682	102695	102705	102705	You	705	" He looked at her more closely , though she wearied him . "
102710	102716	102759	102760	a bohemian	3243	" She shrugged her shoulders . "
102762	102809	102812	102812	you	705	" Yet — with all that — and it was the truth , the brow was so open under the close rings of the curls , the skin so clear under the sun - tan , the mouth so rich and so arch in its youth ! "
102818	102832	102985	102985	Aristocrat	3251	" she went on , before he had a chance to answer her . "
102983	102984	102991	102991	I	0	" "
102999	103000	103013	103013	you	705	" "

103033	103069	103110	103110	one	6278	" retorted Cigarette , with scornful acquiescence . She had no patience with him . He danced so deliciously , he looked so superb , and he would give her nothing but these absent answers . "
103100	103106	103117	103117	you	705	" He laughed a little . "
103126	103127	103117	103117	you	705	" "
103131	103139	103153	103153	women	1003	" she did not know the word . "
103160	103161	103153	103153	women	1003	" "
103169	103170	103153	103153	women	1003	" "

103237	103238	103243	103244	A woman	1012	" "

103253	103274	103196	103196	I	0	" He stooped his head a little as he said it , and traced more figures slowly in the sand . "
103277	103317	103320	103326	a man in the Guides I knew	3266	" She drew a short , quick breath . She understood that ; she would only have laughed at him had it been a woman : Cigarette was more veracious than complimentary in her estimate of her own sex . "
103328	103334	103430	103430	himself	3266	" she went on softly , "
103435	103436	103467	103467	he	3266	" "
103440	103466	103467	103467	he	3266	" murmured the Chasseur d ' Afrique , in his chesnut beard . Cigarette was watching him with all the keenness of her falcon eyes ; "
103476	103480	103493	103493	Your	3270	" she thought . "
103491	103492	103493	103493	Your	3270	" "
103501	103551	103579	103579	I	0	" she said , impatiently , as she sprang up , her lithe elastic figure in the bright vivandière uniform standing out in full relief against the pearly grey of the ruined pillars , the vivid green of the rank vegetation , and the intense light of the noon . "
103593	103647	103579	103579	I	0	" And with a bound to which indignation lent wings like a swallow 's , the Friend of the Flag , insulted and amazed at the apathy with which her advances to friendship had been received , dashed off at her top - most speed , singing all the louder out of bravado . "
103663	103771	103579	103579	I	0	" thought Cigarette , with fierce wrath at such contumely , the first neglect the pet of the Spahis had ever experienced . She was incensed , too , that she had been degraded into that momentary wish that she knew how to read , and looked less like a boy — just because a Chasseur with white hands and silent ways had made her a grave bow ! She was more incensed still because she could not get at his history , and felt , despite herself , a reluctance to bribe him for it with those cajoleries whose potency she had boasted to Tata Leroux . "
103776	103815	103849	103849	Cigarette	689	" muttered the soldier - coquette passionately , in her little white teeth , so small and so pearly , though they had gripped a bridle tight before then , when each hand was filled with a pistol . "
103851	103983	103849	103849	Cigarette	689	" En route through the town her wayward way took the pretty brunette Friend of the Flag as many devious meanderings as a bird takes in a summer's - day flight when it stops here for a berry , there for a grass - seed , here to dip its beak into cherries , there to dart after a dragon - fly , here to shake its wings in a brook , there to poise on a lily - bell . She loitered in a thousand places , for Cigarette knew everybody ; she chattered with a group of Turcos , she emptied her barrel for some Zouaves , she ate sweet - meats with a lot of negro boys , she boxed a little drummer 's ear for slurring over the "
103986	104046	103849	103849	Cigarette	689	" at his practice , she drank a demi - tasse with some officers at a café , she had ten minutes ' pistol - shooting , where she beat hollow a young dandy of the Guides who had come to look at Algiers for a week , and made even points with one of the first shots of the "
104051	104151	104183	104183	I	0	" as the Algerian antithesis runs . Finally she paused before the open French window of a snow - white villa , half - buried in tamarisk and orange and pomegranate , with the deep - hued flowers glaring in the sun , and a hedge of wild cactus fencing it in ; through the cactus she made her way as easily as a rabbit burrows ; it would have been an impossibility to Cigarette to enter by any ordinary means ; and balancing herself lightly on the sill for a second , stood looking in at the chamber . "
104194	104312	104325	104325	thou	709	" The chamber was very handsome , hung and furnished in the very best Paris fashion , and all glittering with amber and ormolu and velvets ; in it half a dozen men — officers of the cavalry — were sitting over their noon breakfast , and playing a lansquenet at the same time . The table was crowded with dishes of every sort , and wines of every vintage , and the fragrance of their bouquet , the clouds of smoke , and the heavy scent of the orange - blossoms without , mingled together in an intense perfume . He whom she addressed , M. le Marquis de Châteauroy , laughed , and looked up . "
104334	104335	104354	104354	Comet	710	" "
104339	104353	104354	104354	Comet	710	" asked Cigarette , with the dubious air and caution of a connoisseur . "
104356	104378	104354	104354	Comet	710	" said M. le Marquis , amused with the precautions taken with his cellar , one of the finest in Algiers . "
104394	104519	104354	104354	Comet	710	" Where he sat between the window and the table he caught her in his arms and drew her pretty face down ; Cigarette , with the laugh of a saucy child , whisked her cigar out of her mouth , and blew a great cloud of smoke in his eyes . She had no particular fancy for him , though she had for his wines . Shouts of mirth from the other men completed the Marquis 's discomfiture , as she swayed away from him , and went over to the other side of the table , emptying some bottles unceremoniously into her wine - keg ; iced , ruby , perfumy claret that she could not have bought anywhere for the barracks . "
104522	104527	104538	104538	petite	3278	" cried the Marquis . "
104540	104546	104581	104583	M. le Colonel	711	" Cigarette tossed her head . "
104585	104686	104705	104705	him	3279	" Châteauroy 's face darkened . He was a colossal - limbed man , whose bone was iron , and whose muscles were like oak - fibres ; he had a dark keen head like an eagle 's , the brow narrow but very high , looking higher because the close - cut hair was worn off the temples ; thin lips hidden by heavy curling moustaches , and a skin burnt black by long African service . Still he was fairly handsome enough not to have muttered so heavy an oath as he did at the vivandière 's jest . "
104707	104716	104720	104720	jealous	3282	" Cigarette darted a quick glance at him . "
104725	104731	104735	104735	I	0	" thought her quick wits . "
104738	104739	104788	104788	Pardieu	671	" "
104765	104787	104841	104841	Diable	694	" said the Viscount de Chanrellon , who had now a command of his own in the Light Cavalry of Algiers . "
104829	104840	104876	104876	he	3288	" Châteauroy tossed off his burgundy with a contemptuous impatience . "
104886	104887	104897	104897	He	3288	" "
104892	104896	104929	104929	he	3288	" laughed Cigarette . "
104937	104938	104958	104958	I	0	" "
104941	104957	105083	105084	The fellow	6311	" laughed Claude de Chanrellon , as magnificent a soldier himself as ever crossed swords . "
105056	105082	105083	105084	The fellow	6311	" The Marquis heard the praise of his Corporal , knitting his heavy brows . It was evident the private was no favourite with him . "
105089	105099	105114	105114	I	0	" he said , with an affectation of carelessness ; "
105127	105128	105114	105114	I	0	" "
105133	105145	105249	105249	you	3296	" cried Chanrellon , wiping the Rhenish off his tawny moustaches , "
105223	105224	105241	105241	He	6311	" "
105229	105240	105280	105280	he	6311	" said the Colonel of Chasseurs , with a snarl . "
105291	105292	105306	105306	Monsieur	3031	" "
105304	105305	105335	105335	Pardieu	671	" "
105333	105334	105376	105376	I	0	" "
105367	105375	105376	105376	I	0	" The Colonel gave a grim laugh . "
105385	105457	105376	105376	I	0	" Cigarette , flirting with the other officers , drinking champagne by great glassfuls , eating bonbons from one , sipping another 's soup , pulling the limbs of a succulent ortolan to pieces with a relish , and devouring truffles with all the zest of a bon - vivant , did not lose a word , and catching the inflection of Châteauroy 's voice , settled with her own thoughts that "
105465	105485	105510	105512	Dieu de Dieu	3316	" had not a fair field or a smooth course with his Colonel . The weathercock heart of the little "
105490	105509	105510	105512	Dieu de Dieu	3316	" veered round , with her sex 's common custom , to the side that was the weakest . "
105518	105559	105587	105588	the aristocrats	3321	" she cried , while she ate M. le Colonel 's foie gras with as little ceremony and as much enjoyment as would be expected from a young plunderer accustomed to think a meal all the better spiced by being stolen "
105566	105568	105793	105794	my brunette	3325	" — "
105677	105790	105793	105794	my brunette	3325	" The Colonel laughed , but restlessly ; the little ingrate had aimed at a sore point in him . He was of the First Empire Nobility , and he was weak enough , though a fierce , dauntless , iron - nerved soldier , to be discontented with the great fact that his father had been a hero of the Army of Italy and scarce inferior in genius to Massena , because impatient of the minor one that , before strapping on a knapsack to have his first taste of war under Custine , the Marshal had been but a postilion at a posting inn in the heart of the Nivernais . "
105796	105837	105889	105889	she	693	" he answered , with a rough laugh , have you taken my popular Corporal for your lover ? You should give your old friends warning first , or he may chance to get an ugly spit on a sabre . "
105884	105888	105889	105889	she	693	" Ma foi ! "
105894	106026	106076	106077	the Emperor	3329	" He would be more likely to spit than be spitted if it came to a duel . I should like to see him in a duel ; there is not a prettier sight in the world when both men have science . As for fighting for me ! Morbleu ! I will thank nobody to have the impudence to do it , unless I order them out . Coqueline got shot for me , you remember ; — he was a pretty fellow , Coqueline , and they killed him so clumsily , that they disfigured him terribly — it was quite a pity . I said then I would have no more handsome men fight about me . You may , if you like , M. le Faucon Noir . "
106073	106075	106129	106129	she	3326	" slanged "
106123	106128	106129	106129	she	3326	" By the way ! "
106147	106163	106198	106198	her	689	" One thing ! — Your Corporal will demoralise the Army of Africa , m'sieu ? "
106164	106182	106191	106191	Cigarette	689	" Eh ? He shall have an ounce of cold lead before he does . What in ? "
106183	106189	106198	106198	her	689	" He will demoralise it , "
106201	106231	106198	106198	her	689	" If they follow his example , we sha n't have a Chasseur , or a Spahis , or a Piou - piou , or a Sapeur worth anything — "
106232	106240	106314	106314	Cigarette	689	" Sacré ! What does he do ? "
106294	106298	106314	106314	Cigarette	689	" fire - eaters "
106303	106312	106314	106314	Cigarette	689	" He wo n't only demoralise the Army , "
106320	106375	106383	106384	her hearers	3335	" but if his example is followed , he 'll ruin the Préfets , close the Bureaux , destroy the Exchequer , beggar all the officials , make African life as tame as milk - and - water , and rob you , M. le Colonel , of your very highest and dearest privilege ! "
106376	106381	106401	106401	Cigarette	689	" Sacre - bleu ! "
106394	106400	106401	106401	Cigarette	689	" what does he do ? "
106412	106438	106668	106668	she	689	" Why , he never thieves from the Arabs ! If the fashion come in , adieu to our occupation . Courtmartial him , Colonel ! "
106664	106667	106668	106668	she	689	" Bah ! "
106680	106721	106770	106770	his	3349	" money is like a mill , no good standing still . Let it turn , turn , turn , as fast as ever it can , and the more bread will come from it for the people to eat . "

107084	107362	107076	107076	Denzil	717	" Vanitas vanitatum ! The dust of death lies over the fallen altars of Bubastis , where once all Egypt came down the flood of glowing Nile , and Herodotus mused under the shadowy foliage , looking on the lake - like rings of water . The Temple of the Sun , where the beauty of Asenath beguiled the Israelite to forget his sale into bondage and banishment , lies in shapeless hillocks , over which canter the mules of dragomen , and chatter the tongues of tourists . Where the Lutetian Palace of Julian saw the Legions rush , with torches and with wine - bowls , to salute their darling as Augustus , the sledge - hammer and the stucco of the Haussmann fiat bear desolation in their wake . Levantine dice are rattled , where Hypatia 's voice was heard . Bills of exchange are trafficked in , where Cleopatra wandered under the palm aisles of her rose gardens . Drummers roll their caserne - calls , where Drusus fell and Sulla laid down dominion . And here — in the land of Hannibal , in the conquest of Scipio , in the Phoenicia , whose loveliness used to flash in the burning , sea - mirrored sun , while her fleets went eastward and westward for the honey of Athens and the gold of Spain — here Cigarette danced the Cancan ! An auberge of the barrière swung its sign of the As de Pique , where feathery palms once had waved above mosques of snowy gleam , with marble domes and jewelled arabesques , and the hush of prayer under columned aisles . "
107372	108276	111497	111498	a rider	3362	" was written , where once verses of the Koran had been blazoned by reverent hands along porphyry cornices and capitals of jasper . A Café Chantant reared its impudent little roof , where once , far back in the dead cycles , Phoenician warriors had watched the galleys of the gold - haired favourite of the gods bear down to smite her against whom the one unpardonable sin of rivalry to Rome was quoted . The riot of a Paris guinguette was heard , where once the tent of Belisarius might have been spread above the majestic head that towered in youth above the tempestuous seas of Gothic armies , as when , silvered with age , it rose as a rock against the on - sweeping flood of Bulgarian hordes . The grisette charms of little tobacconists , milliners , flower - girls , lemonade - sellers , bonbon sellers , and filles de joie flaunted themselves in the gas - light , where the lustrous sorceress eyes of Antonina might have glanced over the Afric Sea , while her wanton 's heart , so strangely filled with leonine courage and shameless licence , heroism and brutality , cruelty and self - devotion , swelled under the purples of her delicate vest , at the glory of the man she at once dishonoured and adored . Vanitas vanitatum ! Under the thirsty soil , under the ill - paved streets , under the arid turf , the Legions lay dead , with the Carthaginians they had borne down under the mighty pressure of their phalanx ; and the Byzantine ranks were dust side by side with the soldiers of Gelimer . And here , above the graves of two thousand centuries , the little light feet of Cigarette danced joyously in that triumph of the Living , who never remember that they also are dancing onward to the tomb ! It was a low - roofed , white - plastered , gaudily - decked , smoke - dried mimicry of the guinguettes beyond Paris . The long room , that was an imitation of the Salle de Mars on a Lilliputian scale , had some bunches of lights flaring here and there , and had its walls adorned with laurel - wreaths , stripes of tricoloured paint , vividly coloured medallions of the Second Empire , and a little pink gauze flourished about it , that flashed into brightness under the jets of flame — trumpery , yet trumpery , which , thanks to the instinct of the French esprit , harmonised , and did not vulgarise ; a gift French instinct alone possesses . The floor was bare and well polished ; the air full of tobacco - smoke , wine fumes , brandy odours , and an overpowering scent of oil , garlic , and pot au feu . Riotous music pealed through it , that even in its clamour kept a certain silvery ring , a certain rhythmical cadence . Pipes were smoked , barrack slang , camp slang , barrière slang , temple slang , were chattered volubly . Theresa 's songs were sung by bright - eyed , sallow - cheeked Parisiennes , and chorused by the lusty lungs of Zouaves and Turcos . Good humour prevailed , though of a wild sort ; the mad gallop of the Rigolboche had just flown round the room , like lightning , to the crash and the tumult of the most headlong music that ever set spurred heels stamping and grisettes ' heels flying : and now , where the crowds of soldiers and women stood back to leave her a clear place , Cigarette was dancing alone . She had danced the cancan ; she had danced since sunset ; she had danced till she had tired out cavalrymen , who could go days and nights in the saddle without a sense of fatigue , and made Spahis cry quarter , who never gave it by any chance in the battle - field ; and she was dancing now like a little Bacchante , as fresh as if she had just sprung up from a long summer day 's rest . Dancing as she would dance only now and then , when caprice took her , and her wayward vivacity was at its height , on the green space before a tent full of general officers , on the bare floor of a barrack - room , under the canvas of a fête - day 's booth , or as here , in the salle of a café . Marshals had more than once essayed to bribe the famous little Friend of the Flag to dance for them , and had failed : but , for a set of soldiers , warworn , dust - covered , weary with toil and stiff with wounds , she would do it , till they forgot their ills , and got as intoxicated with it as with champagne . For her gros bébées , if they were really in want of it , she would do anything . She would flout a star - covered General , box the ears of a brilliant Aide , send killing missiles of slang at a dandy of a regiment de famille , and refuse point - blank a Russian Grand Duke ; but to "
108280	109567	111497	111498	a rider	3362	" as she was given to calling the rough tigers and grisly veterans of the Army of Africa , Cigarette was never capricious , however mischievously she would rally , or contemptuously would rate them , when they deserved it . And she was dancing for them now . Her soft short curls all fluttering , her cheeks all bright with a scarlet flush , her eyes as black as night and full of fire , her gay little uniform , with its scarlet and purple , making her look like a fuchsia bell tossed by the wind to and fro , ever so lightly , on its delicate swaying stem , Cigarette danced with the wild grace of an Almeh , of a Bayadère , of a Nautch girl , as untutored and instinctive in her as its song to a bird , as its swiftness to a chamois . To see Cigarette was like drinking light fiery wines , whose intoxication was gay as mischief , and sparkling as themselves . All the warmth of Africa , all the wit of France , all the bohemianism of the Flag , all the caprices of her sex , were in that bewitching dancing . Flashing , fluttering , circling , whirling , glancing like a sabre 's gleam , tossing like a flower 's head , bounding like an ante - lope , launching like an arrow , darting like a falcon , skimming like a swallow ; then for an instant resting as indolently , as languidly , as voluptuously , as a water - lily rests on the water 's breast;—Cigarette en Bacchante no man could resist . When once she abandoned herself to the afflatus of that dance - delirium , she did with her beholders what she would . The famous Cachucha , that made the reverend Cardinals of Spain fling off their pontifical vestments , and surrender themselves to the witchery of the castanets and the gleam of the white twinkling feet , was never more irresistible , more enchanting , more full of wild , soft , bizarre , delicious grace . It was a poem of motion and colour , an ode to Venus and Bacchus . All her heart was in it — that heart of a girl and a soldier , of a hawk and a kitten , of a bohemian and an epicurean , of a lascar and a child , which beat so brightly and so boldly under the dainty gold aiglettes with which she laced her dashing little uniform . In the Chambrée of Zéphyrs , among the Douars of Spahis , on sandy soil under African stars , above the heaped plunder brought in from a razzia , in the yellow light of candles fastened to bayonets stuck in the earth at a bivouac , on the broad deal table of a barrack - room full of black - browed conscrits indigènes , amidst the thundering echoes of the Marseillaise des Bataillons , shouted from the brawny chests of Zouaves , Cigarette had danced , danced , danced , till her whole vivacious life seemed pressed into one hour , and all the mirth and mischief of her little brigand 's soul seemed to have found their utterance in those tiny , slender , spurred , and restless feet , that never looked to touch the earth which they lit on lightly as a bird alights , only to leave it afresh , with wider swifter bound , with ceaseless airy flight . So she danced now , in the cabaret of the As de Pique . She had a famous group of spectators , not one of whom knew how to hold himself back from springing in to seize her in his arms , and whirl with her down the floor . But it had been often told them by experience , that , unless she beckoned one out , a blow of her clenched hand and a cessation of her impromptu pas de seul , would be the immediate result . Her spectators were renowned croque - mitaines ; men whose names rang like trumpets in the ear of Kabyle and Marabout ; men who had fought under the noble colours of the day of Mazagran , or had cherished or emulated its traditions ; men who had the salient features of all the varied species that make up the soldiers of Africa . There was Ben Arslan , with his crimson burnous wrapped round his towering stature , from whom Moor and Jew fled as before a pestilence , the fiercest , deadliest , most voluptuous of all the Spahis ; brutalised in his drink , merciless in his loves ; all an Arab when once back in the desert , with a blow of a scabbard his only payment for forage , and a thrust of his sabre his only apology to husbands , but to the Service a slave , and in the combat a lion . There was Beau - Bruno , a dandy of Turcos , whose snowy turban and olive beauty bewitched half the women of Algeria , who himself affected to neglect his conquests , with a supreme contempt for those indulgences , but who would have been led out and shot rather than forego the personal adornings , for which his adjutant and his capitaine du bureau growled unceasing wrath at him with every day that shone . There was Pouffer - de - Rire , a little Tringlo , 8 the wittiest , gayest , happiest , sunniest - tempered droll in all the army , who would sing the camp - songs so joyously through a burning march , that the whole of the battalions would break into one refrain as with one throat , and press on laughing , shouting , running , heedless of thirst , or heat , or famine , and as full of monkey - like jests as any gamins . There was En - ta - maboull , so nicknamed from his love for that unceremonious slang phrase — a Zouave who had the history of a Gil Blas , and the talent of a Crichton , the morals of an Abruzzi brigand , and the wit of a Falstaff ; aquiline - nosed , eagle - eyed , black - skinned as an African , with adventures enough in his life to outvie Munchausen , with a purse always pleine de vide , 10 as the camp sentence runs ; who thrust his men through the body as coolly as others kill wasps ; who roasted a shepherd over the campfire for contumacy in concealing Bedouin where - abouts ; yet who would pawn his last shirt at the bazaar to help a comrade in debt , and had once substituted himself for , and received fifty blows on the loins in the stead of , his sworn friend , whom he loved with that love of David for Jonathan , which , in Caserne life , is readier found than in Club life . There was Pattes - du - Tigre , a small wiry supplelimbed fire - eater , with a skin like a coal and eyes that sparkled like the live coal 's flame , a veteran of the Joyeux , who could discipline his roughs as a sheep - dog his lambs , and who had one curt martial law for his detachment , brief as Draco 's , and trimmed to suit either an attack on the enemy or the chastisement of an indiscipliné , lying in one simple word—"Fusillez
109569	110671	111497	111498	a rider	3362	" There was Barbe - Grise , a grisly ancien of Zéphyrs , who held the highest repute of any in his battalion for rushing on to a foe with a foot speed that could equal the canter of an Arab 's horse ; for having stood alone once the brunt of thirty Bedouins ' attack , and ended by beating them back , though a dozen spear - heads were launched into his body , and his pantalons garances were filled with his own blood ; and for framing a matchless system of night plunder that swept the country bare as a table - rock in an hour , and made the colons surrender every hidden treasure , from a pot of gold to a hen 's eggs , from a caldron of couscoussou to a tom - cat . There was Alcide Echaufourées , also a Zéphyr , who had his nickname from the marvellous changes of costume with which he would pursue his erratic expedition , and deceive the very Arabs themselves into believing him a born Mussulman ; a very handsome fellow , the Lauzun of his battalion , the Brummel of his caserne ; coquette with his képi on one side of his graceful head , and his moustaches soft as a lady 's hair , whose paradise was a score of dangerous intrigues , and whose seventh heaven was a duel with an infuriated husband ; incorrigibly lazy , but with the Italian laziness , as of the panther who sleeps in the sun , and with such episodes of romance , mischief , love , and devilry in his twenty - five years of existence as would leave behind them all the invention of Dumas , père ou fils . All these and many more like them were the spectators of Cigarette 's ballet , applauding with the wild hurrah of the desert , with the clashing of spurs , with the thunder of feet , with the demoniac shrieks of irrepressible adoration and delight . And every now and then her bright eyes would flash over the ring of familiar faces , and glance from them with an impatient disappointment as she danced ; her gros bébées were not enough for her . She wanted a Chasseur with white hands and a grave smile to be amongst them ; and she shook back her curls , and flushed angrily as she noted his absence , and went on with the pirouettes , the circling flights , the wild resistless abandonment of her inspirations , till she was like a little desert - hawk that is intoxicated with the scent of prey borne down upon the wind , and wheeling like a mad thing in the transparent æther and the hot sun - glow . L ' As de Pique was the especial estaminet of the chasses - marais . He was in the house ; she knew it ; had she not seen him drinking with some others , or rather paying for all but taking little himself , just as she entered ? He was in the house , this mysterious Bel - à - faire - peur — and was not here to see her dance ! Not here to see the darling of the Douars ; the pride of every Chacal , Zéphyr , and Chasseur in Africa ; the Amie du Drapeau who was adored by every one , from Chefs de Bataillons to fantassins , and toasted by every drinker , from Algiers to Oran , in the Champagne of Messieurs les Généraux as in the Cric of the Loustics round a camp - fire ! He was not there ; he was leaning over the little wooden ledge of a narrow window in an inner room , from which , one by one , some Spahis and some troopers of his own tribu , with whom he had just been drinking such burgundies and brandies as the place could give , had sloped away one by one under the irresistible attraction of the vivandière . An attraction , however , that had not seduced them till all the bottles were emptied , bottles more in number and higher in cost than were prudent in a Corporal who had but his pay , and that scant enough , to keep himself , and who had known what it was to find a roll of white bread and a cup of coffee a luxury beyond all reach , and to have to faire la lessive 12 up to the last thing in his haversack to buy a toss of thin wine when he was dying of thirst , or a slice of melon when he was parching with African fever . But prudence had at no time been his speciality , and the reckless life of Algeria was not one to teach it , with its frank brotherly fellowship that bound the soldiers of each battalion , or each squadron , so closely in a fraternity of which every member took as freely as he gave ; its gay , careless carpe diem camp - philosophy , the unconscious philosophy of men who enjoyed heart and soul if they had a chance , because they knew they might be shot dead before another day broke ; and its swift and vivid changes that made tirailleurs and troopers one hour rich as a king in loot , in wine , in dark - eyed captives at the sacking of a tribe , to be the next day famished , scorched , dragging their weary limbs , or urging their sinking horses through endless sand and burning heat , glad to sell a cartouche , if they dared so break regimental orders , or to rifle a henroost , if they came near one , to get a mouthful of food , changing everything in their haversack for a sup of dirty water , and driven to pay with the thrust of a sabre for a lock of wretched grass to keep their beasts alive through the sickliness of a sirocco . All these taught no caution to any nature normally without it ; and the chief thing that his regiment had loved , in him whom they named Bel - à - faire - peur , from the first day that he had bound his red waist - sash about his loins , and the officiers of the bureau had looked over the new volunteer , murmuring admiringly in their teeth "
110677	111089	111497	111498	a rider	3362	" had been that all he had was given , free as the winds , to any who asked or needed . The all was slender enough . Unless he live by the ingenuity of his own manufactures , or by thieving or intimidating the people of the country , a French soldier has but barren fare and a hard struggle with hunger and poverty ; and it was the one murmur against him , when he was lowest in the ranks , that he would never follow the fashion , in wringing out by force or threat the possessions of the native population . The one reproach , that made his fellow- lascars 13 impatient and suspicious of him , was that he refused any share in those rough arguments of blows and lunges with which they were accustomed to persuade every victim they came nigh to yield them up all such treasures of food , or drink , or riches , from sheep 's liver and couscoussou , to Morocco carpets and skins of brandy and coins hid in the sand , that the Arabs might be so unhappy as to own in their reach . That the fattest pullet of the poorest Bedouin was as sacred to him as the banquet of his own Chef d'Escadron , let him be ever so famished after the longest day 's march , was an eccentricity , and an insult to the usages of the corps , for which not even his daring and his popularity could wholly procure him pardon . But this defect in him was counterbalanced by the lavishness with which his décompte was lent , given , or spent in the very moment of its receipt . If a man of his tribu wanted anything , he knew that Bel - à - faire - peur would offer his last sou to aid him , or , if money were all gone , would sell the last trifle he possessed to the Riz - pain - sels , to get enough to assist his comrade . It was a virtue which went far to vouch for all others in the view of his lawless , open - handed brethren of the Chambrée and the Camp , and made them forgive him many moments , when the mood of silence and the habit of solitude , not uncommon with him , would otherwise have incensed a fraternity with whom "
111095	111482	111512	111512	He	3362	" is the deadliest charge , and the sentence of excommunication against any who dare to provoke it . One of those moods was on him now . He had had a drinking - bout with the men who had left him , and had laughed as gaily and as carelessly , if not as riotously , as any of them at the wild mirth , the unbridled licence , the amatory recitations , and the Bacchic odes in their lawless sapir , that had ushered the night in while his wines unlocked the tongues and flowed down the throats of the fierce Arab - Spahis and the French cavalry - men . But now he leant out of the pent - up casement , with his arms folded on the sill , and a short pipe in his teeth , thoughtful and solitary after the orgie , whose heavy fumes and clouds of smoke still hung heavily on the air within . The window looked on a little , dull , close court - yard , where the yellow leaves of a withered gourd trailed drearily over the grey uneven stones . The clamour of the applause and the ring of the music from the dancing - hall echoed with a whirling din in his ear , and made , in sharper stranger contrast , the quiet of the narrow court with its strip of starry sky above its four high walls . He leaned there musing and grave , hearing little of the noise about him;—there was always noise of some sort in the clangour and tumult of barrack or bivouac life , and he had grown to heed it no more than he heeded the roar of desert beasts about him , when he slept in the desert or the hills;—but , looking dreamily out at the little shadowy square , with the sear gourd leaves and the rough misshapen stones . His present and his future were neither much brighter than the gloomy walled - in den on which he gazed . Twelve years before , when he had been ordered into the champ de manoeuvre for the first time , to see of what mettle he was made , the instructor had watched him with amazed eyes , muttering to himself , "
111526	111823	111512	111512	He	3362	" And when he had passed from the exercising - ground to the campaign , the Army had found in him one of the most splendid of its many splendid soldiers ; and in the folios matricules 19 there was no page of achievements , of exploits , of services , of dangers , that showed a more brilliant array of military deserts than his . Yet , for many years , he had been passed by unnoticed : he had now not even the cross on his chest , and he had only slowly and with infinite difficulty been promoted so far as he stood now — a Corporal in the Chasseurs d'Afrique — a step only just accorded him because wounds innumerable , and distinctions without number in countless skirmishes , had made it impossible to cast him wholly aside any longer . The cause lay in the implacable enmity of one man — his Chief . Far - sundered as they were by position , and rarely as they could come in actual contact , that merciless weight of animosity from the great man to his soldier had laid on the other like iron , and clogged him from all advancement . His thoughts were of it now . Only to - day , at an inspection , the accidentally - broken saddle - girth of a boy - conscript had furnished pretext for a furious reprimand , a volley of insolent opprobrium hurled at himself , under which he had had to sit mute in his saddle , with no other sign that he was human beneath the outrage than the blood that would , despite himself , flush the pale bronze of his forehead . His thoughts were on it now . "
111833	111837	111887	111887	They	3367	" he mused , "
111854	111886	111906	111906	they	3367	" A whirlwind of laughter , so loud that it drowned the music of the shrill violins and thundering drums , echoed through the rooms and shook him from his reverie . "
111892	111905	111906	111906	they	3367	" he thought , with a half smile , as he listened ; "
111929	111990	111906	111906	they	3367	" Amidst the shouts , the crash , the tumult , the gay ringing voice of Cigarette rose distinct . She had apparently paused in her dancing to exchange one of those passes of arms which were her speciality , in the Sabir that she , a child of the regiments of Africa , had known as her mother tongue . "
111995	112002	112026	112026	Ingrat	748	" 20 she cried , disdainfully . "
112015	112025	112040	112040	you	748	" The grumbled assent of the accused was inaudible . "
112028	112039	112125	112126	Ma cantche	3376	" pursued the scornful , triumphant voice of the vivandière ; "
112080	112124	112162	112162	He	6748	" The screams of mirth redoubled ; Cigarette 's style of withering eloquence was suited to all her auditors ' tastes , and under the chorus of laughs at his cost , her infuriated adversary plucked up courage and roared forth a defiance . "
112160	112161	112197	112199	Barbe - Grise	739	" "
112201	112213	112305	112305	Dam!—his	749	" retorted the contemptuous tones of the champion of the absent . "
112237	112304	112305	112305	Dam!—his	749	" This forcible tu quoque recrimination is in high relish in the Caserne ; the screams of mirth redoubled ; Barbe - Grise was a redoubtable authority whom the wildest dare - devil in his brigade dared not contradict , and he was getting the worst of it under the lash of Cigarette 's tongue , to the infinite glee of the whole ball - room . "
112314	112319	112305	112305	Dam!—his	749	" growled her opponent . "
112324	112334	112368	112368	they	3387	" cried the little lady , with supreme disdain ; "
112374	112375	112368	112368	they	3387	" "
112378	112386	112391	112391	you	739	" thundered the insulted Barbe - Grise . "
112397	112398	112401	112401	you	739	" "
112408	112417	112401	112401	you	739	" screamed Cigarette , in fits of laughter ; "
112442	112496	112511	112513	au grand galop	3393	" 26 A growl like a lion from the badgered Barbe - Grise shook the walls ; she had cast her mischievous stroke at him on a very sore point , the unhappy young conscript 's rifle having been first dexterously thieved from him , and then as dexterously sold to an Arab . "
112501	112505	112511	112513	au grand galop	3393	" he roared ; "
112525	112609	112809	112809	he	3398	" The only answer to this unbearable insult was a louder tumult of laughter ; a crash , a splash , and a volley of oaths from Barbe - Grise . Cigarette had launched a bottle of vin ordinaire at him , blinded his eyes , and drenched his beard with the red torrent and the shower of glass shivers , and was back again dancing like a little Bacchante , and singing at the top of her sweet lark - like voice — "
112680	112807	112809	112809	he	3398	" With which doggrel declaration of her own mercenary and cosmopolitan sentiments chanted in Sabir slang , the little Friend of the Flag resumed her wildest bounds and her most airy fantasias . At the sound of the animated altercation , not knowing but what one of his own troopers might be the delinquent , he who leaned out of the little casement moved forward to the doorway of the dancing - room ; he did not guess that it was himself whom she had defended against the onslaught of the Zéphyr , Barbe - Grise . His height rose far above the French soldiers , and above most even of the lofty - statured Spahis , and her rapid glance flashed over him at once . "
112812	112913	112939	112939	You	3399	" she wondered ; the scarlet flush of exercise and excitement deepened on her clear brown cheek that had never blushed at the coarsest jests or the broadest love - words of the barrack - life that had been about her ever since her eyes first opened in their infancy to laugh at the sun - gleam on a Cuirassier 's corslet among the baggage - waggons that her mother followed . She thought he had not heard ; his face was grave , a little weary , and his gaze , as it fell on her , was abstracted . "
112920	112938	112939	112939	You	3399	" thought Cigarette , with a flush of hot wrath superseding her momentary and most rare embarrassment . "
112956	113050	113340	113340	Roumis	750	" Such an insult she had never been subjected to , from the first day when she had danced for sweetmeats on the top of a great drum when she was three years old , in the middle of a circular camp of Tirailleurs . It sent fresh nerve into her lithe limbs , it made her eyes flash like so much fire , it gave her a million - fold more grace , more abandon , more heedlessness , more piqued and reckless désinvolture . She stamped her tiny spurred foot petulantly . "
113057	113336	113340	113340	Roumis	750	" she cried , and as the musician obeyed her , she whirled , she spun , she bounded , she seemed to live in air , while her soft curls blew off her brow , and her white teeth glanced , and her cheeks glowed with a carmine glow , and the little gold aiglettes broke across her chest with the beating of her heart , that throbbed like a bird 's heart when it is wild with the first breath of Spring . She had pitted herself against him ; and she won — so far . The vivacity , the impetuosity , the antelope elegance , the voluptuous repose that now and then broke the ceaseless , sparkling movement of her dancing , caught his eyes and fixed them on her : it was bewitching , and it bewitched him for the moment ; he watched her as in other days he had watched the fantastic witcheries of eastern almè , and the ballet charms of opera - dancers . This young bohemian of the barrack danced in the dusky glare and the tavern fumes of the As de Pique to a set of soldiers in their shirt - sleeves with their short black pipes in their mouths , with as matchless a grace as ever the first ballerina of Europe danced before sovereigns and dukes on the boards of Paris , Vienna , or London . It was the eastern bamboula of the Harems , to which was added all the elastic joyaunce , all the gay brilliancy , of the blood of France . Suddenly she lifted both her hands above her head . "
113342	113459	113490	113490	I	0	" It was the signal well known , the signal of permission to join in that wild vertigo for which every one of her spectators was panting ; their pipes were flung away , their képis tossed off their heads , the music clashed louder and faster , and more fiery with every sound , the chorus of the Marseillaise des Bataillons thundered from a hundred voices — they danced as only men can dance who serve under the French flag , and live under the African sun . Two , only , still looked on ; the Chasseur d ' Afrique , and a veteran of the 10th company , lamed for life at Mazagran . "
113471	113489	113505	113505	Bravo	751	" muttered the veteran Zéphyr to his silent companion . The Chasseur turned and smiled a little . "
113503	113504	113508	113508	she	3401	" "
113516	113517	113508	113508	she	3401	" "
113530	113604	113508	113508	she	3401	" His thoughts went to a woman he had loved well , a young Arab , with eyes like the softness of dark waters , who had fallen to him once in a razzia as his share of spoil , and for whom he had denied himself cards , or wine , or tobacco , or an hour at the Café , or anything that alleviated the privation and severity of his lot as "
113608	113710	113718	113719	the Djied	752	" which he had been then , that she might have such few and slender comforts as he could give her from his miserable pay . She was dead . Her death had been the darkest passage in his life in Africa — but the flute - like music of her voice seemed to come on his ear now . This girl - soldier had little charm for him after the sweet silent tender grace of his lost Zelme . He turned and touched on the shoulder a Chasseur who had paused a moment to get breath in the headlong whirl : "
113723	113879	114163	114163	he	3407	" The trooper obeyed instantly ; they were ordered to visit and remain with a Bedouin camp some thirty miles away on the naked plateau ; a camp professedly submissive , but not so much so but that the Bureau deemed it well to profit themselves by the services of the Corporal , whose knowledge of Arabic , whose friendship with the tribes , and whose superior intelligence in all such missions rendered him peculiarly fitted for errands that required diplomacy and address as well as daring and fire . He went thoughtfully out of the noisy reeking ball - room into the warm lustre of the Algerian night ; as he went , Cigarette , who had been nearer than he knew , flashed full in his eyes the fury of her own sparkling ones , while with a contemptuous laugh she struck him across the lips with the cigar she hurled at him . "
113921	114156	114163	114163	he	3407	" The words were spoken with the fierceness of Africa ; she had too much in her of the spirit of the Zéphyrs and the Chacals with whom her youth had been spent from her cradle up , not to be dangerous when roused ; she was off at a bound , and in the midst of the mad whirl again , before he could attempt to soften or efface the words she had overheard , and the last thing he saw of her was in a cloud of Zouaves and Spahis with the wild tintamarre of the music shaking riotous echoes from the rafters . But when he had passed out of sight , Cigarette shook herself free from the dancers with petulant impatience . She was not to be allured by flattery or drawn by entreaty back amongst them ; she set her delicate pearly teeth tight , and vowed with a reckless contemptuous impetuous oath that she was tired , that she was sick of them , that she was no strolling player to caper for them with a tambourine ; and with that declaration made her way out alone into the little open court under the stars , so cool , so still after the heat , and riot , and turbulence within . There she dropped on a broad stone step , and leant her head on her hand . "
114166	114270	116525	116525	he	760	" she thought , while for the first time , with a vague sense of his meaning , tears welled hot and bitter into her sunny eyes while the pained colour burned in her face . Those tears were the first that she had ever known , and they were cruel ones , though they lasted but a little time ; there was too much fire in the young bohemian of the Army not to scorch them as they rose . She stamped her foot on the stones passionately , and her teeth were set like a little terrier 's as she muttered : "
116491	116498	116525	116525	he	760	" sondant le terrain aux environs . "
116531	116539	116863	116864	The Chasseur	663	" Mort de Dieu!—they have the woman ! "
116838	116862	116886	116886	He	663	" So ! you heed the heat so little , you give up your turn of water to a drummer , they say ? "
116898	116909	116927	116929	M. le Marquis	709	" The drummer was but a child , mon Commandant . "
116910	116925	116927	116929	M. le Marquis	709	" Be so good as to give us no more of those melodramatic acts ! "
116933	116967	116886	116886	He	663	" You are too fond of trafficking in those showy fooleries . You bribe your comrades for their favouritism too openly . Ventre - bleu ! I forbid it — do you hear ? "
116968	116975	117017	117017	Châteauroy	709	" I hear , mon Colonel . "
117010	117015	117017	117017	Châteauroy	709	" Obey , then ! "
117021	117059	116927	116929	M. le Marquis	709	" Well , since you love heat so well , you shall take a flag of truce and my scroll to the Sidi Ilderim . But tell me first — what do you think of this capture ? "
117060	117074	117017	117017	Châteauroy	709	" It is not my place to give opinions , M. le Colonel . "
117075	117102	117017	117017	Châteauroy	709	" Pardieu ! it is your place when I bid you . Speak , or I will have the matraque cut the words out of you ! "
117103	117109	116927	116929	M. le Marquis	709	" I may speak frankly ? "
117110	117117	117017	117017	Châteauroy	709	" Ten thousand curses — yes ! "
117118	117137	117214	117215	The Chasseur	663	" Then,—I think that those who make war on women are no longer fit to fight with men . "
117197	117213	117214	117215	The Chasseur	663	" By God ! I have a mind to have you shot like a dog ! "
117239	117267	117352	117353	The Chasseur	663	" You have threatened it before , M. le Colonel . It may be as well to do it , or the army may think you capricious . "
117300	117351	117454	117454	he	663	" No ; I will send you instead to the Khalifa . He often saves me the trouble of killing my own curs . Take a flag of truce and this paper , and never draw rein till you reach him , if your beast drop dead at the end . "
117446	117453	117454	117454	he	663	" If the Arabs kill him , "
117457	117467	117787	117787	he	663	" I will forgive Ilderim five seasons of rebellion . "
117796	117801	118240	118240	his	7706	" Read it me . "
118253	118391	118441	118441	he	663	" But that you trust yourself to my honour , I would rend you limb from limb . Go back to the tiger who rules you , and tell him that — as Allah liveth — I will fall on him and smite him , as he hath never been smitten . Dead or living , I will have back my own . If he take her life , I will have ten thousand lives to answer it : if he deal her dishonour , I will light such a holy war through the length and breadth of the land , that his nation shall be driven backward , like choked dogs into the sea , and perish from the face of the earth for evermore . And this I swear by the Law and the Prophet ! "
118432	118440	118441	118441	he	663	" Emir , listen to one word , "
118446	118562	118624	118625	the Emir	767	" Shame has been done to me as to you . Had I been told what words I bore , they had never been brought by my hand . You know me . You have had the marks of my steel , as I have had the marks of yours . Trust me in this , Sidi . I pledge you my honour , that , before the sun sets , she shall be given back to you unharmed ; or I will return here myself , and your tribe shall slay me in what fashion they will . So alone can she be saved uninjured . Answer — will you have faith in me ? "
118638	118717	118959	118967	the most daring soldier of all his fiery Horse	3596	" You are a great warrior : such men do not lie . Go , and , if she be borne to me before the sun is half - way sunk towards the west , all the branches of the tribes of Ilderim shall be as your brethren , and bend as steel to your bidding . If not — as God is mighty — not one man in all your host shall live to tell the tale ! "

But the locust - swarms that devour the land are the money - eaters , the petty despots , the bribe - takers , the men who wring gold out of infamy , who traffic in tyrannies , who plunder under official seals , who curse Algiers with avarice , with fraud , with routine , with the hell - spawn of civilisation .

121993	122004	122005	122006	The Chasseur	7724	" Beg pardon , sir ! I was half asleep ! "
122011	122024	122038	122039	the other	6416	" Do n't talk English ; somebody will hear you one day . "
122025	122036	122179	122180	The Corporal	6747	" What 's the odds if they do , sir ? "
122041	122178	122187	122187	he	6747	" It relieves one 's feelins a little . All of 'em know I 'm English , but never a one of 'em knew what you are . The name you was enrolled by wo n't really tell 'em nothing . They guess it ai n't yours . That cute little chap , Tata , he says to me yesterday , ' you 're always a treatin ' of your galonné like as if he was a Prince . ' ' Dammee ! ' says I , ' I 'd like to see the Prince as would hold a candle to him . ' ' You 're right there , ' says the little ' un . ' There ai n't his equal for takin ' off a beggar 's head with a back sweep . ' "
122195	122218	122443	122444	The Corporal	6747	" Well , it 's something to have one virtue ! But have a care what those chatterboxes get out of you . "
122219	122442	122479	122483	the latter born of circumstance	3703	" Lord , sir . Ai n't I been a takin ' care these ten years ? It comes quite natural now . I could n't keep my tongue still ; that would n't be in anyways possible . So I 've let it run on oiled wheels on a thousand rum tracks and doublins . I 've told 'em such a lot of amazin ' stories about where we kem from , that they 've got half a million different styles to choose out of . Some thinks as how you 're a Polish nob , what got into hot water with the Russians ; some as how you 're a Italian Prince what was cleaned out like Parma and them was ; some as how you 're a Austrian Archduke that have cut your country because you was in love with the Empress , and had a duel about her that scandalised the whole empire ; some as how you 're a exiled Spanish grandee a - come to learn tactics and that like , that you may go back , and pitch O'Donnell into the middle of next week , whenever you see a chance to cut in and try conclusions with him . Bless you , sir ! you may let me alone for bamboozling ' of anybody ! "
122485	122537	122547	122548	the Chasseur	7724	" If you can outwit our friends the Zéphyrs , and the Loustics , and the Indigènes , you have reached a height of diplomacy indeed ! I would not engage to do it myself . Take my word for it , ingenuity is always dangerous — silence is always safe . "
122538	122545	122547	122548	the Chasseur	7724	" That may be , sir , "
122565	122651	122731	122732	The other	6416	" No doubt it 's uncommon good for them as can bring their minds to it — just like water instead o ' wine — but it 's very tryin ' , like the teetotalism . You might as well tell a Newfoundland not to love a splash as me not to love a chatter . I 'd cut my tongue out sooner than say never a word that you do n't wish — but say somethin ' I must , or die for it . "
122738	122757	122790	122791	the soldier	6518	" No , no . I have told you a thousand times we are comrades and equals now . "
122758	122788	122790	122791	the soldier	6518	" And I 've told you a thousand times , sir , that we are n't , and never will be , and do n't ought n't to be , "
122805	122820	122731	122732	The other	6416	" A gentleman 's a gentleman , let alone what straits he fall into . "
122821	122858	122731	122732	The other	6416	" But ceases to be one as soon as he takes a service he can not requite , or claims a superiority he does not possess . We have been fellow - soldiers for twelve years — "
122859	123019	122790	122791	the soldier	6518	" So we have , sir ; but we are what we always was , and always will be — one a gentleman , t ' other a scamp . If you think so be as I 've done a good thing side by side with you now and then in the fightin ' , give me my own way and let me wait on you when I can . I ca n't do much on it when those other fellows ' eyes is on us ; but here I can and I will — beggin ' your pardon — so there 's an end of it . One may speak plain in this place with nothing but them Arabs about ; and all the Army know well enough , sir , that if it were n't for that black devil , Châteauroy , you 'd have had your officer 's commission and your troop too long before now — "
123020	123057	123091	123091	his	3710	" Oh no . There are scores of men in the ranks merit promotion better far than I do . And,—leave the Colonel 's name alone . He is our chief , whatever else he be . "

123126	123136	123188	123188	he	3710	" You are happy enough in Algeria — eh ? "

123222	123330	123380	123380	he	3717	" I , sir ? Never was so happy in my life , sir . I 'd be discontented indeed if I was n't . Always some spicy bit of fighting . If there are n't a fantasia , as they call it , in the field , there 's always somebody to pot in a small way ; and if you 're lying by in barracks there 's always a scrimmage hot as pepper to be got up with fellows that love the row just as well as you do . It 's life , that 's where it is ; it ai n't rustin ' . "
123331	123339	123380	123380	he	3717	" Then you prefer the French service ? "
123340	123355	123380	123380	he	3717	" Right and away , sir . You see this is how it is , "
123362	123372	123412	123412	his	3717	" Crache - au - nez - d'la - Mort "
123415	124164	124213	124213	he	3719	" Over there in England , you know , sir , pipeclay is the deuce - and - all , you 've always got to have the stock on , and look as stiff as a stake , or it 's all up with you ; you 're that tormented about little things that you get riled and kick the traces before the great ' uns come to try you . There 's a lot of lads would be game as game could be in battle , ay , and good lads to boot , doing their duty right as a trivet when it came to anything like war , that are clean druv ' out of the service in time o ' peace , along with all them petty persecutions that worry a man 's skin like mosquito - bites . Now here they know that , and Lord ! what soldiers they do make thro ' knowing of it ! It 's tight enough and stern enough in big things ; martial law sharp enough , and obedience to the letter all through the campaigning ; but that do n't grate on a fellow ; if he 's worth his salt he 's sure to understand that he must move like clockwork in a fight , and that he 's to go to hell at double - quick - march , and mute as a mouse , if his officers see fit to send him . That 's all right , but they do n't fidget you here about the little fal - lals ; you may stick your pipe in your mouth , you may have your lark , you may do as you like , you may spend your décompte how you choose , you may settle your little duel as you will , you may shout and sing and jump and riot on the march , so long as you march on ; you may lounge about half - dressed in any style as suits you best , so long as you 're up to time when the trumpets sound for you ; and that 's what a man likes . He 's ready to be a machine when the machine 's wanted in working trim , but when it 's run off the line and the steam all let off , he do like to oil his own wheels , and lie a bit in the sun at his fancy . There are n't better stuff to make soldiers out of nowhere than Englishmen , God bless 'em ! but they 're badgered , they 're horribly badgered , and that 's why the Service do n't take over there , let alone the way the country grudge 'em every bit of pay . In England you go in the ranks — well , they all just tell you you 're a blackguard , and there 's the lash , and you 'd better behave yourself or you 'll get it hot and hot ; they take for granted you 're a bad lot or you would n't be there , and in course you 're riled and go to the bad according , seeing that it 's what 's expected of you . Here , contrariwise , you come in the ranks and get a welcome , and feel that it just rests with yourself whether you wo n't be a fine fellow or not ; and just along of feelin ' that you 're pricked to show the best metal you 're made on , and not to let nobody else beat you out of the race like . Ah ! it makes a wonderful difference to a fellow — a wonderful difference — whether the service he 's come into look at him as a scamp that never will be nothin' but a scamp , or as a rascal that 's maybe got in him , all rascal though he is , the pluck to turn into a hero . It makes a wonderful difference , this ' ere , whether you 're looked at as stuff that 's only fit to be shovelled into the sand after a battle , or as stuff that 'll belike churn into a great man . And it 's just that difference , sir , that France has found out , and England has n't — God bless her all the same ! "
124199	124212	124213	124213	he	3719	" A army 's just a machine , sir , in course , "
124224	124276	124277	124283	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" But then it 's a live machine for all that ; and each little bit of it feels for itself like the joints in an eel 's body . Now , if only one of them little bits smarts , the whole crittur goes wrong — there 's the mischief . "
124299	124352	124462	124463	the other	6416	" I dare say you are right enough . I knew nothing of my men when — when I was in England ; we none of us did ; but I can very well believe what you say . Yet — fine fellows though they are here , they are terrible blackguards ! "
124353	124421	124462	124463	the other	6416	" In course they are , sir ; they would n't be such larky company unless they was . But what I say is that they 're scamps who 're told they may be great men if they like ; not scamps who 're told that because they 're once gone to the devil they must always keep there . It makes all the difference in life . "
124422	124443	124514	124514	he	6416	" Yes — it makes all the difference in life , whether hope is left , or — left out ! "
124502	124513	124518	124518	his	6416	" Wo n't there never be no hope , sir ? "

Unhappily , harems are too expensive for Roumis ! Yet I am not sure that I am not better amused in the Chasseurs than I was in the Household — specially when we are at war . I suppose we must be wild animals at the core , or we should never find such an infinite zest in the death - grapple . Good night ! "

125497	125537	125565	125569	a Colonel of Tirailleurs Indigènes	3752	" but you are true . We are a furnace in which Blackguardism is burnt into Dare - devilry , and turned out as Heroism . A fine manufacture that , and one at which France has no equal . "
125538	125563	125571	125571	Chanrellon	664	" But our manufactures keep the original hall - mark , and show that the devil made them if the drill have moulded them ! "
125582	125632	125640	125641	the General	7695	" Pardieu ! We do our original maker credit , then ; nothing good in this world without a dash of diablerie . Scruples are the wet blankets , proprieties are the blank walls , principles are the quickset - hedges of life , but devilry is its champagne ! "
125633	125638	125640	125641	the General	7695	" Ventre - bleu ! "
125643	125686	125773	125773	he	3754	" We have a right to praise the blackguards ; without them our conscripts would be very poor trash . The conscript fights because he has to fight , the blackguard fights because he loves to fight . A great difference that . "
125755	125772	125773	125773	he	3754	" In proportion as one loves powder , one has been a scoundrel , mon Général , "
125776	125786	125794	125794	he	3759	" what the catalogue of your crimes must be ! "
125802	125899	126046	126046	Chanrellon	664	" Sapristi ! The cardinal virtues do n't send anybody , I guess , into African service . And yet , pardieu , I do n't know . What fellows I have known ! I have had men among my Zéphyrs — and they were the wildest pratiques too — that would have ruled the world ! I have had more wit , more address , more genius , more devotion , in some headlong scamp of a loustic than all the courts and cabinets would furnish . Such lives , such lives too , morbleu ! "
126041	126044	126046	126046	Chanrellon	664	" Faith ! "

Look at that little Cora ; the Minister of War should give her the Cross . She sends us ten times more fire - eaters than the Conscription does . Five fine fellows — of the vieille roche too — joined to - day , because she has stripped them of everything , and they have nothing for it but the service . She is invaluable , Cora . "
126293	126306	126191	126191	Chanrellon	664	" And there is not much to look at in her either , "
126315	126362	126383	126383	he	3754	" I saw her when our detachment went to show in Paris . A baby face , innocent as a cherub — a soft voice — a shape that looks as slight and as breakable as the stem of my glass — there is the end ! "

The end of her is — ' l ' Enfer ! ' My good Alcide — that ' baby face ' has ruined more of us than would make up a battalion . She is so quiet , so tender ; smiles like an angel , glides like a fawn ; is a little sad too , the innocent dove ; looks at you with eyes as clear as water , and paf ! before you know where you are , she has pillaged with both hands , and you wake one fine morning bankrupt ! "
126493	126502	126542	126543	the Colonel	7799	" Why do you let her do it ? "
126535	126540	126542	126543	the Colonel	7799	" Ah - bah ! "
126552	126624	126630	126632	Claude de Chanrellon	664	" it is the thing to be ruined by Cora . There is Bébée - je - m'enfous ; there is Blonde - Miou - Miou ; there is the Cerisette ; there is Neroli ; there is Loto — any one of them is equally good style with Cora ; but to be at all in the fashion , one must have been talked of with one of the six . "
126625	126628	126542	126543	the Colonel	7799	" Diantre ! "
126672	126761	126542	126543	the Colonel	7799	" It was Coeur d'Acier who was the rage in my time . She ate me up — that woman — in three months . I had not a hundred francs left : she stripped me as bare as a pigeon . Her passion was emeralds en cabochon just then . Well , emeralds en cabochon made an end of me , and sent me out here . Coeur d'Acier was a wonderful woman!—and the chief wonder of her was , that she was as ugly as sin . "
126762	126765	126542	126543	the Colonel	7799	" Ugly ? "
126766	126817	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Ugly as sin ! But she had the knack of making herself more charming than Venus . How she did it nobody knew ; but men left the prettiest creatures for her : and she ruined us , I think , at the rate of a score a month . "
126818	126822	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Like Loto , "
126828	126912	126925	126925	Chanrellon	664	" Loto has not a shred of beauty . She is a big , angular , raw - boned Normande , with a rough voice , and a villanous patois ; but to be well with Loto - is to have achieved distinction at once . She will have nothing under the third order of nobility ; and Prince Paul shot the Duc de Var about her the other day . She is a great creature , Loto : nobody knows her secret . "

127003	127022	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Coeurs d'Acier are to be found in all ranks of the sex , monsieur , I fancy ? "
127023	127042	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Bah ! you beg the question . Did not a woman send you out here — eh ? "
127043	127049	127000	127000	he	3780	" No , monsieur,—only chance . "
127050	127068	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" A fig for your chance ! Women are the mischief that casts us adrift to chance . "
127069	127077	127100	127101	The Chasseur	663	" Monsieur , we cast ourselves sometimes . "
127078	127099	127100	127101	The Chasseur	663	" Dieu de Dieu ! I doubt that . We should go straight enough if it were not for them . "
127105	127137	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" M. le Viscomte thinks we are sure to be right then , if , for the key to every black story , we ask , ' Who was she ? ' "
127138	127168	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Of course I do . Well ! who was she ? We are all quoting our tempters to - night . Give us your story , mon brave ! "
127169	127189	127197	127199	the listening General	3781	" Monsieur , you have it in the folios matricules , as well as my sword could write it . "
127190	127195	127219	127219	Chanrellon	664	" Good , good ! "
127228	127268	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" And your sword writes in a brave man 's fashion — writes what France loves to read . But before you wore your sword here ? Tell us of that . It was a romance — wasn't it ? "
127269	127283	127219	127219	Chanrellon	664	" If it were , I have folded down the page , monsieur . "
127284	127314	126825	126826	the Tirailleur	3779	" Open it , then ! Come — what brought you out amongst us ? You had gamed au roi dépouillé — that was it ? Out with it ! "
127315	127339	127473	127473	he	664	" Monsieur , direct obedience is a soldier 's duty ; but I never heard that inquisitive annoyance was an officer 's privilege ? "
127496	127513	127680	127680	he	663	" A right rebuke!—fairly given , and well deserved . I thank you for the lesson . "
127669	127679	127729	127729	he	664	" I beg your pardon , Monsieur le Vicomte , "
127721	127724	127729	127729	he	664	" Dieu ! "
127749	127775	127798	127798	his	3799	" I would give a year 's pay to know that fine fellow 's history . He is a gentleman — every inch of him . "
127776	127786	127822	127823	the Tirailleur	3779	" And a good soldier , which is better , "
127812	127820	127846	127846	Chanrellon	664	" A private of Châteauroy's — eh ? "

127863	128151	128157	128158	the General	7695	" The Black Hawk hates him — God knows why — and he is kept down in consequence , as if he were the idlest lout or the most incorrigible rebel in the service . Look at what he has done . All the Bureaux will tell you there is not a finer Roumi in Africa — not even among our Schaouacks ! Since he joined , there has not been a hot and heavy thing with the Arabs that he has not had his share in . There has not been a campaign in Oran or Kabaila that he has not gone out with . His limbs are slashed all over with Bedouin steel . He rode once twenty leagues to deliver despatches with a spear - head in his side , and fell , in a dead faint , out of his saddle just as he gave them up to the commandant 's own hands . He saved the day , two years ago , at Granaila . We should have been cut to pieces , as sure as destiny , if he had not collected a handful of broken Chasseurs together , and rallied them , and rated them , and lashed them with their shame , till they dashed with him to a man into the thickest of the fight , and pierced the Arabs ' centre , and gave us breathing room , till we all charged together , and beat the Arbicos back like a herd of jackals . There are a hundred more like stories of him — every one of them true as my sabre ; — and , in reward , he has just been made a galonné ! "
128152	128155	128195	128196	the veteran	3155	" Superb ! "
128164	128194	128195	128196	the veteran	3155	" Ce n'est pas à la France — ça ! Twelve years ! In five under Napoléon , he would have been at the head of a brigade ; but then"—and
128205	128229	128241	128241	Chanrellon	664	" but then , Napoléon read his men himself and never read them wrong . It is a divine gift that for commanders . "
128230	128239	128241	128241	Chanrellon	664	" The Black Hawk can read , too , "

128271	128314	128322	128324	the old General	3805	" No eyes are keener than his , to trace a lascar kébir . But , where he hates , he strikes beak and talons — pong!—till the thing drops dead — even where he strikes a bird of his own brood . "
128315	128320	128322	128324	the old General	3805	" That is bad , "
128328	128362	128484	128484	he	663	" There are four people who should have no personal likes or dislikes : they are an innkeeper , a school - master , a ship 's skipper , and a military chief . "

129094	129099	129117	129118	The skipper	3832	" Wait a second , "
129103	129116	129117	129118	The skipper	3832	" Did you ever chance to hear of a schooner called Regina ? "
129126	129240	129276	129277	The skipper	3832	" Her as was in the Biscay , July come two years ? — her as druv ' through the storm like a mad thing , and flew like a swallow , when everything was splittin ' and founderin ' , and shipping seas around her?—her as was the first to bear down to the great Wrestler , a - lyin ' there hull over in water , and took aboard all as ever she could hold o ' the passengers , a - pitchin ' out her own beautiful cabin fittins to have as much room for the poor wretches as ever she could ? Be you a - meanin ' her ? "
129245	129275	129283	129283	he	3832	" She was my yacht , that 's all ; and I was without a captain through that storm . Will you think me a good enough sailor now ? "
129289	129470	129501	129501	you	3846	" Good enough ! Blast my timbers ! there are n't one will beat you in any waters . Come on , sir , if so be as you wished it ; but never a stroke of work shall you do atween my decks . I never did think as how one of your yachting - nobs could ever be fit to lay hold of a tiller ; but , hang me , if the Club make such sailors as you it 's a rare ' un ! Lord a mercy ! why my wife was in the Wrestler . I 've heard her tell scores of times as how she was a'most dead when that little yacht came through a swaling sea , that was all heavin ' and roarin ' round the wreck , and as how the swell what owned it gev ' his cabin up to the womenkind , and had his swivel - guns and his handsome furniture pitched overboard , that he might be able to carry more passengers , and fed 'em , and gev"em
129504	129505	129501	129501	you	3846	" "
129511	129841	129501	129501	you	3846	" said Bertie , quietly . And so he crossed unnoticed to Algeria , while through Europe the tidings went , that the mutilated form , crushed between iron and wood , on the Marseilles line , was his , and that he had perished in that awful , ink - black , sultry southern night , when the rushing trains had met , as meet the thunder - clouds . The world thought him dead ; as such , the journals recorded him , with the shameful outlines of imputed crime , to make the death the darker ; as such , his name was forbidden to be uttered at Royallieu ; as such , the Seraph mourned him with passionate loving force , refusing to the last to accredit his guilt : — and he , leaving them in their error , was drafted into the French Army under two of his christian names , which happily had a foreign sound — Louis Victor — and laid aside for ever his identity as Bertie Cecil . He went at once on service in the interior , and had scarcely come in any of the larger towns since he had joined . His only danger of recognition had once been when a Marshal of France , whom he had used to know well in Paris and at the Court of St. James , held an inspection of the African troops . Filing past the brilliant staff , he had ridden at only a few yards ' distance from his old acquaintance , and , as he saluted , had glanced involuntarily at the face that he had seen oftentimes in the Salles des Maréchaux , and even under the roof of Royallieu . The great chief 's keen blue eyes were scrutinising the regiment , ready to note a chain loose , a belt awry , a sword specked with rust , if such a sin there were against "
129844	129872	129501	129501	you	3846	" in all the glittering squadrons ; and swept over him , seeing in him but one among thousands — a unit in the mighty aggregate of the "
129875	129889	129900	129900	He	3064	" of war . The Marshal only muttered to a General beside him , "
129909	130177	129900	129900	He	3064	" But that it was in truth an officer of the English Guards , and a friend of his own , who paced past him as a private of Algerian Horse , the French leader never dreamed . From the extremes of luxury , indolence , indulgence , pleasure , and extravagance , Cecil came to the extremes of hardship , poverty , discipline , suffering , and toil . From a life where every sense was gratified , he came to a life where every privation was endured . He had led the fashion;—he came where he had to bear without a word the curses , oaths , and insults of a corporal or a sous - lieutenant . He had been used to every delicacy and delight ; — he came where he had to take the coarse black bread of the army as a rich repast . He had thought it too much trouble to murmur flatteries in great ladies ' ears;—he came where morning , noon , and night the inexorable demands of rigid rules compelled his incessant obedience , vigilance , activity , and selfdenial . He had known nothing from his childhood up except an atmosphere of amusement , refinement , brilliancy , and idleness;—he came where gnawing hunger , brutalised jest , ceaseless toil , coarse obscenity , agonised pain , and pandemoniac mirth , alternately filled the measure of the days . A sharper contrast , a darker ordeal , rarely tried the steel of any man 's endurance ; yet , under it , he verified the truth , "
130184	130201	130716	130716	you	3850	" No Spartan could have borne the change more mutely , more staunchly , than did the "
130207	130712	130716	130716	you	3850	" The first years were , it is true , years of intense misery to him . Misery , when all the blood glowed in him under some petty tyrant 's jibe , and he had to stand immovable , holding his peace . Misery , when the hunger and thirst of long marches tortured him , and his soul sickened at the half - raw offal , and the water thick with dust , and stained with blood , which the men round him seized so ravenously . Misery , when the dreary dawn broke , only to usher in a day of mechanical manoeuvres , of petty tyrannies , of barren burdensome hours in the exercise - ground , of convoy duty in the burning sun - glare , and under the heat of harness ; and the weary night fell with the din and uproar , and the villanous blasphemy , and befouled merriment of the riotous Chambrée , that denied even the peace and oblivion of sleep . They were years of infinite wretchedness oftentimes , only relieved by the loyalty and devotion of the man who had followed him into his exile . But , however wretched , they never wrung a single regret or lament from Cecil . He had come out to this life ; he took it as it was . As , having lost the title to command , the high breeding in him made him render implicitly the mute obedience which was the first duty of his present position , so it made him accept , from first to last , without a sign of complaint or of impatience , the altered fortunes of his career . The hardest - trained , lowest - born , longest - inured soldier in the Zephyr ranks did not bear himself with more apparent content and more absolute fortitude than did the man who had used to think it a cruelty to ride with his troop from Windsor to Wormwood Scrubs , and had never taken the trouble to load his own gun any shooting season , or to draw off his own coat any evening . He suffered acutely many times ; suffered till he was heart - sick of his life ; but he never sought to escape the slightest penalty or hardship , and not even Rake ever heard from him a single syllable of irritation or of self - pity . Moreover , the war - fire woke in him . In one shape or another , active service was almost always his lot , and hot , severe campaigning was his first introduction to military life in Algeria . The latent instinct in him — the instinct that had flashed out during his lazy fashionable calm in all moments of danger , in all days of keen sport ; the instinct that had made him fling himself into the duello with the French boar , and made him mutter to Forest King , "
130723	131069	130716	130716	you	3850	me!"—was the instinct of the born soldier . In peril , in battle , in reckless bravery , in the rush of the charge , and the excitement of the surprise , in the near presence of death , and in the chase of a foe through a hot African night when both were armed to the teeth , and one or both must fall when the grapple came — in all these that old instinct , aroused and unloosed , made him content ; made him think that the life which brought them was worth the living . There had always been in him a reckless daredevilry , which had slept under the serene effeminate insouciance of his careless temper and his pampered habits . It had full rein now , and made him , as the army affirmed , one of the most intrepid , victorious , and chivalrous lascars of its fiery ranks . Fate had flung him off his couch of down into the tempest of war , into the sternness of life spent ever on the border of the grave , ruled ever by an iron code , requiring at every step self - negation , fortitude , submission , courage , patience , the self - control which should take the uttermost provocation from those in command without even a look of reprisal , and the courageous recklessness which should meet death , and deal death , which should be as the eagle to swoop , as the lion to rend . And he was not found wanting in it . He was too thorough - bred to attempt to claim a superiority that fortune no longer conferred on him , to seek to obtain a deference that he had no longer the position to demand . He obeyed far more implicitly than many a ruffian filibuster , who had been amongst the dregs of society from his birth . And though his quick - eyed comrades knew , before he had been amongst them five minutes , that an "
131071	131522	130716	130716	you	3850	" had taken refuge under the Flag of Mazagran , they never experienced from him one touch of the insolence that their own sous - officiers beat them with , as with the flat of the sword ; and they never found in him one shadow of the arrogance that some fellow - soldier , who had swelled into a sergeant - major , or bristled into an adjutant , would strut with , like any turkey - cock . He was too quiet , too courteous , too calmly listless ; he had too easy a grace , too soft a voice , and too many gentleman - habits , for them . But when they found that he could fight like a Zouave , ride like an Arab , and bear shot - wounds or desert - thirst as though he were of bronze , it grew a delight to them to see of what granite and steel this dainty patrician was made ; and they loved him with a rough , ardent , dog - like love , when they found that his last crust , in a long march , would always be divided ; that the most desperate service of danger was always volunteered for by him ; that no severity of personal chastisement ever made him clear himself of a false charge at a comrade 's expense ; and that all his décompte went in giving a veteran a stoup of wine , or a sick conscript a tempting meal , or a prisoner of Beylick some food through the grating , scaled too at risk of life and limb . Cecil had all a soldier 's temper in him ; and the shock which had hurled him out of ease , and levity , and ultra - luxury , to stand alone before as dark and rugged a fortune as ever fronted any man , had awakened the war - fire which had only slumbered because lulled by habit , and unaroused by circumstance . He had never before been called on to exert either thought or action : the necessity for both called many latent qualities in him into play . The same nature , which had made him wish to be killed over the Grand Military course , rather than live to lose the race , made him now bear privation as calmly , and risk death as recklessly , as the hardiest and most fiery loustic of the African cantonments . Bitter as the life often was , severe the suffering , and acute the deprivation , the sternest veteran scarcely took them more patiently , more silently , than the "
131525	131563	130716	130716	you	3850	" to whom a corked claret or a dusty race - day had been calamities . Cast among these wild , iron - muscled bohemians , who fought like tigers , and were as impenetrable as rhinoceri , "
131565	131592	130716	130716	you	3850	" was too strong in Cecil not to hold its own with them , whether in the quality of endurance , or the quality of daring . "
131602	131619	130716	130716	you	3850	" the Roumis were wo nt to say of their comrade , with his delicate habits , "
131626	132427	130716	130716	you	3850	" as they would growl impatiently ; and his tenacious patience , which would never give way either in the toil of the camp or the grip of the struggle . On the surface it seemed as though never was there a life more utterly thrown away than the life of a Guardsman and a gentleman , a man of good blood , high rank , and talented gifts had he ever chosen to make anything of them , buried in the ranks of the Franco - African army , risking a nameless grave in the sand with almost every hour , associated with the roughest riffraff of Europe , liable any day to be slain by the slash of an Arab flissa , and rewarded for twelve years ' splendid service by the distinctive badge of a corporal . Any one of the friends of his former years , seeing him thus , would have said that he might as well be thrown at once into a pit in the sand , where the dead were piled twenty deep after a skirmish , to lie and rot , or be dug up by the talons of famished beasts , whichever might chance , as live thus in the obscurity , poverty , and semi - barbarism of an Algerian private 's existence . Yet it might be doubted if any life would have done for him what this had done : it might be questioned , if , judging a career not by its social position , but by its effect on character , any other would have been so well for him , or would equally have given steel and strength to the indolence and languor of his nature as this did . In his old world he would have lounged listlessly through fashionable seasons , and , in an atmosphere that encouraged his profound negligence of everything and his natural nil - admirari listlessness , would have glided from refinement to effeminacy , and from lazy grace to blasé inertia . The severity and the dangers of the campaigns with the French army had roused the sleeping lion in him , and made him as fine a soldier as ever ranged under any flag . He had suffered , braved , resented , fought , loved , hated , endured , and even enjoyed , here in Africa , with a force and a vividness that he had never dreamed possible in his calm , passionless , insouciant world of other days . He had known what the hunger of famine , what the torment of fever , what the agony of forbidden pride , what the wild delight of combat , were . He had known what it was to long madly for a stoup of water ; to lie raving , yet conscious , under the throes of gun - shot wounds ; to be forced to bear impassively words , for a tithe of which he could have struck across the mouth the chief who spoke them ; to find in a draught of wretched wine , after days of marching , a relish that he had never found in the champagnes and burgundies of the Guards ' mess ; to love the dark Arab eyes , that smiled on him in his exile , as he had never loved those of any woman , and to suffer when the death - film gathered over them , as he had never thought it in him to suffer for any death or any life ; to feel every nerve thrill , and every vein glow , as with fierce , exultant joy , as the musketry pealed above the plains , and his horse pressed down on to the very mouths of the rifles , and the naked sabres flashed like the play of lightnings , and over the dead body of his charger , he fought ankle deep in blood , with the Arabs circling like hawks , and their great blades whirling round him , catching the spears aimed at him with one hand , while he beat back their swords , blow for blow , with the other ; — he had known all these , the desert passions ; and , while outwardly they left him much the same in character , they changed him vitally . They developed him into a magnificent soldier — too true a soldier not to make thoroughly his the service he had adopted , not to , oftentimes , almost forget that he had ever lived under any other flag than that tricolour , which he followed and defended now . The quaint heroic Norman motto of his ancestors carved over the gates of Royallieu — "
132433	132597	132605	132606	Corporal Victor	804	" — verified itself in his case . Out - lawed , beggared , robbed at a stroke of every hope and prospect , he had taken his adversity boldly by the beard , and had made himself at once a country and a kingdom among the brave , fierce , reckless , loyal hearts of the men , who came from north , south , east , and west , driven by every accident , and scourged by every fate , to fill up the battalions of North Africa . As he went now , in the warmth of the after - glow , he turned up into the Rue Babazoum , and paused before the entrance of a narrow , dark , tumble - down , picturesque shop , half like a stall of a Cairo bazaar , half like a Jew 's den in a Florentine alley . A cunning , wizen head peered out at him from the gloom . "
132608	132621	132623	132623	you	804	" Cecil , at the words , crossed the sill and entered . "
132627	132691	132737	132739	M. le Caporal	806	" he asked . There was a slight constraint and hesitation in the words , as of one who can never fairly bend his spirit to the yoke of barter . The little , hideous , wrinkled , dwarf - like creature , a trader in curiosities , grinned with a certain gratification , in disappointing this lithe - limbed , handsome Chasseur . "
132741	132742	132737	132739	M. le Caporal	806	" "
132749	133055	133162	133162	Myself	0	" said Cecil , simply , as he paused a moment before some delicate little statuettes and carvings — miniature things , carved out of a piece of ivory , or a block of marble , the size of a horse 's hoof , such as could be picked up in dry river channels , or broken off stray boulders ; slender crucifixes , wreaths of foliage , branches of wild fig , figures of Arabs and Moors , dainty heads of dancing - girls , and tiny chargers fretting like Bucephalus . They were perfectly conceived and executed . He had always had a D'Orsay - like gift that way , though , in common with all his gifts , he had utterly neglected all culture of it , until , cast adrift on the world , and forced to do something to maintain himself , he had watched the skill of the French soldiers at all such expedients to gain a few coins , and had solaced many a dreary hour in barracks and under canvas with the toy - sculpture , till he had attained a singular art at it . He had commonly given Rake the office of selling them , and as commonly spent all the proceeds on all other needs save his own . He lingered a moment , with regret in his eyes ; he had scarcely a sou in his pocket , and he had wanted some money sorely that night for a comrade dying of a lung - wound — a noble fellow , a French artist who , in an evil hour of desperation , had joined the army , with a poet 's temper that made its hard colourless routine unendurable , and had been shot in the chest in a night - skirmish . "
133063	133161	133162	133162	Myself	0	" he asked , at length , the colour flushing his face ; he would not have pressed the question to save his own life from starving , but Léon Ramon would have no chance of a fruit or a lump of ice to cool his parched lips and still his agonised retching , unless he himself could get money to buy those luxuries that are too splendid and too merciful to be provided for a dying soldier , who knows so little of his duty to his country as to venture to die in his bed . "
133164	133174	133162	133162	Myself	0	" screeched the dealer , with a derisive laugh . "
133199	133224	133238	133238	God	565	" Cecil went out of the place without a word ; his thoughts were with Léon Ramon , and the insolence scarce touched him . "
133233	133237	133238	133238	God	565	" he wondered . "
133258	133375	133238	133238	God	565	" As he left the den , a military fairy , all gay with blue and crimson , like the fuchsia bell she most resembled , with a meerschaum in her scarlet lips and a world of wrath in her bright black eyes , dashed past him into the darkness within , and before the dealer knew or dreamt of her , tossed up the old man 's little shrivelled frame like a shuttlecock , shook him till he shook like custards , flung him upward and caught him as if he were the hoop in a game of La Grace , and set him down bruised , breathless , and terrified out of his wits . "
133380	133393	133437	133437	He	3857	" cried Cigarette , with a volley of slang , utterly untranslatable , "
133420	133436	133646	133646	I	0	" ( She knew Harpagon because some of her Roumis chattered bits of Molière . ) "
133573	133638	133664	133664	Cigarette	689	" With which exordium the little Amie du Drapeau shook her culprit at every epithet , emptied out a shower of gold and silver , just won at play , from the bosom of her uniform , forced it into the dealer 's hands , hurled him out of his own door , and drew her pretty weapon with a clash from her sash . "
133666	133838	133840	133840	you	3863	" The little old Jew flew as fast as his limbs would carry him , clutching the coins in his horny hands . He was terrified to a mortal anguish , and had not a thought of resisting or disobeying her ; he knew the fame of Cigarette — as who did not ? Knew that she would fire at a man as carelessly as at a cat , more carelessly in truth , for she favoured cats , saving many from going into the Zouaves ' soup - caldrons , and favoured civilians not at all ; and knew that at her rallying - cry all the sabres about the town would be drawn without a second 's deliberation , and sheathed in anything or in anybody that had offended her , for Cigarette was , in her fashion , Generalissima of all the Regiments of Africa . The dealer ran with all the speed of terror , and overtook Cecil , who was going slowly onward to the barracks . "
133843	133905	133913	133915	M. le Caporal	806	" he asked , in surprise at the large amount , as the little Jew panted out apologies , entreaties , and protestations of his only having been in jest , and of his fervently desiring to buy the carvings at his own price , as he knew of a great collector in Paris to whom he needed to send them . "
133917	133941	133991	133991	I	0	" pleaded the curriosity - trader , turning his head in agonised fear to see if the vivandière 's pistol was behind him . "
133999	134038	134044	134044	you	806	" Cecil looked at him a moment ; he saw the man was in earnest , and thought but little of his repentance and trepidation , for the citizens were all afraid of slighting or annoying a soldier . "
134046	134213	134254	134254	Cigarette	689	" he said , as he stretched out his hand and took the coins , not without a keen pang of the old pride that would not wholly be stilled , yet gladly for sake of the Chasseur dying yonder , growing delirious and wrenching the blood off his lungs , in want of one touch of the ice that was spoiled by the ton weight to keep cool the wines and the fish of M. le Marquis de Châteauroy . And he went onward to spend the gold his sculptures had brought on some mellow figs and some cool golden grapes , and some ice - chilled wines that should soothe a little of the pangs of dissolution , to his comrade , and bear him back a moment , if only in some fleeting dream , to the vine shadows , and the tossing seas of corn , and the laughing sunlit sweetness , of his own fair country by the blue Biscayan waves . "
134256	134313	134254	134254	Cigarette	689	" said the little Friend of the Flag , with a sententious sternness , that crushed each word deliberately through her tight - set pearly teeth . The unhappy Jew shuddered and shut his eyes as she held a bullet close to his sight , then dropped it with an omnious thud in her pistol barrel . "
134322	134326	134339	134340	ma belle	3221	" he stammered ; "
134343	134356	134362	134362	I	0	" A box on the ears sent him across his own counter . "
134367	134380	134435	134435	You	806	" said Cigarette , with fiery scorn and as hot an oath . "
134388	134434	134501	134501	They	3874	" began the bruised and stammering Israelite . Cigarette tossed back her pretty head , that was curly and spirited and shapely as any thorough - bred spaniel 's ; a superb glance flashed from her eyes , a superb disdain sat on her lips . "
134480	134500	134501	134501	They	3874	" With which magnificent peroration she swept all the carvings — they were rightfully hers — off the table . "
134508	134722	134742	134742	he	3875	" she said , contemptuously , as she vaulted lightly over the counter into the street , and pirouetted like a bit of fantoccini , that is wound up to waltz for ever , along the slope of the crowded Babazoum . All made way for her , even the mighty Spahis and the trudging Bedouin mules , for all knew that if they did not she would make it for herself , over their heads or above their prostrated bodies . She whirled her way , like a gay - coloured top set humming down a road , through the divers motley groups , singing at the top of her sweet mirthful voice , for she was angry with herself ; and , for that , sang the more loudly the most wicked and risqué of her slang songs , that gave the morals of a Messalina in the language of a fish - wife , and yet had an inalienable , mischievous , contagious , dauntless French grace in it withal . Finally , she whirled herself into a dark deserted Moresco archway , a little out of the town , and dropped on a stone block , as a swallow , tired of flight , drops on to a bough . "
134749	134880	134742	134742	he	3875	unsexed!"—and with each repetition of the infamous word , so bitter because vaguely admitted to be true , with her cheeks scarlet and her eyes aflame , and her hands clenched , she flung one of the ivory wreaths on to the pavement and stamped on it with her spurred heel until the carvings were ground into powdered fragments — stamped , as though it were a living foe , and her steel - bound foot were treading out all its life with burning hate and pitiless venom . In the act her passion exhausted itself , as the evil of such warm , impetuous , tender natures will ; she was very still , and looked at the ruin she had done with regret and a touch of contrition . "
134895	135274	135325	135326	Léon Ramon	807	" she thought . Then she took all the rest up , one by one , and gazed at them . Things of beauty had had but little place in her lawless young life ; what she thought beautiful was a regiment sweeping out in full sunlight , with its eagles , and its colours , and its kettle - drums ; what she held as music was the beat of the réveillé and the mighty roll of the great artillery ; what made her pulse throb and her heart leap was to see two fine opposing forces draw near for the onslaught and thunder of battle . Of things of grace she had no heed , though she had so much grace herself ; and her life , though full of colour , pleasure , and mischief , was as rough a one in most respects as any of her comrades ' . These delicate artistic carvings were a revelation to her . Here was the slender pliant spear of the river - reed ; here the rich foliage of the wild fig - tree ; here the beautiful blossom of the oleander ; here fruit and flower , and vine - leaf , and the pendulous ears of millet , twined together in their ivory semblance till they seemed to grow beneath her hands — and those little hands looked so brown and so powder - stained beside the pure snow - whiteness of the wreaths ! She touched them reverently one by one ; all the carvings had their beauty for her , but those of the flowers had far the most . She had never noted any flowers in her life before , save those she strung together for the Zéphyrs on the Jour de Mazagran . Her youth was a military ballad , rhymed vivaciously to the rhythm of the Pas de Charge ; but other or softer poetry had never by any chance touched her until now . Now that in her tiny , bronzed , war - hardened palms lay the white foliage , the delicate art - trifles of this Chasseur , who bartered his talent to get a touch of ice for the burning lips of his doomed comrade . "
135328	136095	135325	135326	Léon Ramon	807	" she thought , while the silvery moon strayed in through a broken arch , and fell on an ivory coil of twisted lentiscus leaves and river grasses . And , lost in a musing pity , Cigarette forgot her vow of vengeance . The Chambrée of the Chasseurs was bright and clean in the morning light ; but in common with all Algerian barrack - rooms as unlike the barrack - rooms of the ordinary army as Cigarette , with her débonnaire devilry , smoking on a gun - waggon , was unlike a trim Normandy soubrette , sewing on a bench in the Tuileries gardens . Disorder reigned supreme ; but Disorder , although a dishevelled goddess , is very often a picturesque one , and more of an artist than her better - trained sisters ; and the disorder was brightened with a thousand vivid colours and careless touches that blent in confusion to enchant a painter 's eyes . The room was crammed with every sort of spoil that the adventurous pillaging temper of the troopers could forage from Arab tents , or mountain caves , or river depths , or desert beasts and birds . All things , from tiger - skins to birds'-nests , from Bedouin weapons to ostrich - eggs , from a lion 's mighty coat to a tobacco - stopper chipped out of a morsel of deal , were piled together , pell - mell , or hung against the whitewashed walls , or suspended by cords from bed to bed . Everything that ingenuity and hardihood , prompted by the sharp spur of hunger , could wrest from the foe , from the country , from earth or water , from wild beasts or riven rock , were here in the midst of the soldiers ' regimental pallets and regimental arms , making the Chambrée at once atelier , storehouse , workshop , and bazaar ; while the men , cross - legged on their little hard couches , worked away with the zest of those who work for the few coins that alone will get them the food , the draught of wine , the hour 's mirth and indulgence at the estaminet , to which they look across the long stern probation of discipline and manoeuvre . Skill , grace , talent , invention whose mother was necessity , and invention that was the unforced offshoot of natural genius , were all at work ; and the hands that could send the naked steel down at a blow through turban and through brain could shape , with a woman 's ingenuity , with a craftsman skill , every quaint device and dainty bijou from stone and wood , and many - coloured feathers , and mountain berries , and all odds and ends that chance might bring to hand , and that the women of Bedouin tribes or the tourists of North Africa might hereafter buy with a wondrous tale appended to them , racy and marvellous as the Sapir slang and the military imagination could weave , to enhance the toy 's value , and get a few coins more on them for their manufacture . Ignorance jostled art , and bizarrerie ran hand in hand with talent , in all the products of the Chasseurs ' extemporised studio ; but nowhere was there ever clumsiness , and everywhere was there an industry , gay , untiring , accustomed to make the best of the worst ; the workers laughing , chattering , singing , in all good - fellowship , while the fingers that gave the death - thrust held the carver 's chisel , and the eyes that glared blood - red in the heat of battle twinkled mischievously over the meerschaum bowl , in whose grinning form some great chief of the Bureaucratie had just been sculptured in audacious parody . In the midst sat Rake , tattooing with an eastern skill the skin of a great lion , that a year before he had killed in single combat in the heart of Oran , having watched for the beast twelve nights in vain , high perched on a leafy crest of rock , above a watercourse . While he worked , his tongue flew far and fast over the camp slang — the slangs of all nations came easy to him — in voluble conversation with the Chasseur next him , who was making a fan out of feathers that any Peeress might have signalled with at the Opera . "
136105	136142	135325	135326	Léon Ramon	807	" was in high popularity with his comrades ; and had said but the truth when he averred that he had never been so happy as under the tricolour . The officers pronounced him an incurably audacious "
136145	136926	136930	136930	You	3880	" he was always in mischief , and the regimental rules he broke through like a terrier through a gauze net ; but they knew that when once the trumpets sounded Boot and Saddle , this yellow - haired dare - devil of an English fellow would be worth a score of more orderly soldiers , and that wherever his adopted flag was carried , there would he be , first and foremost , in everything save retreat . The English service had failed to turn Rake to account ; the French service made no such mistake , but knew that though this British bull - dog might set his teeth at the leash and the lash , he would hold on like grim death in a fight , and live game to the last , if well handled . Apart , at the head of the Chambrée , sat Cecil . The banter , the songs , the laughter , the chorus of tongues , went on unslackened by his presence . He had cordial sympathies with the soldiers : with those men who had been his fellows in adversity and danger ; and in whom he had found , despite all their occasional ferocity and habitual recklessness , traits and touches of the noblest instincts of humanity . His heart was with them always , as his purse , and his wine , and his bread were alike shared ever among them . He had learned to love them well — these wild wolf - dogs , whose fangs were so terrible to their foes , but whose eyes would still glisten at a kind word , and who would give a staunch fidelity unknown to tamer animals . Living with them , one of them in all their vicissitudes , knowing all their vices , but knowing also all their virtues , owing to them many an action of generous nobility , and watching them in many an hour when their gallant self - devotion and their loyal friendships went far to redeem their lawless robberies and their ruthless crimes , he understood them thoroughly , and he could rule them more surely in their tempestuous evil , because he comprehended them so well in their mirth and in their better moods . When the grade of sous - officier gave him authority over them , they obeyed him implicitly because they knew that his sympathies were with them at all times , and that he would be the last to check their gaiety , or to punish their harmless indiscretions . The warlike Roumis had always had a proud tenderness for their Bel - à - faire - peur , and a certain wondering respect for him ; but they would not have adored him to a man , as they did , unless they had known that they might laugh without restraint before him , and confide any dilemma to him sure of aid , if aid were in his power . The laughter , the work , and the clatter of conflicting tongues were at their height ; Cecil sat , now listening , now losing himself in thought , while he gave the last touch to the carvings before him . They were a set of chessmen which it had taken him years to find materials for and to perfect ; the white men were in ivory , the black in walnut , and were two opposing squadrons of French troops and of mounted Arabs . Beautifully carved , with every detail of costume rigid to truth , they were his masterpiece , though they had only been taken up at any odd ten minutes that had happened to be unoccupied during the last three or four years . The chessmen had been about with him in so many places and under canvas so long , from the time that he chipped out their first Zouave pawn , as he lay in the broiling heat of Oran prostrate by a dry brook 's stony channel , that he scarcely cared to part with them , and had refused to let Rake offer them for sale , with all the rest of the carvings . Stooping over them , he did not notice the doors open at the end of the Chambrée until a sudden silence that fell on the babble and uproar round him made him look up ; then he rose and gave the salute with the rest of his discomfited and awe - stricken troopers . Châteauroy with a brilliant party had entered . The Colonel flashed an eagle glance round . "
136941	136990	136996	136997	mon Commandant	8258	" The soldiers stood like hounds that see the lash ; they knew that he was like enough to carry out his threat ; though they were doing no more than they had always tacit if not open permission to do . Cecil advanced , and fronted him . "
136999	137049	137192	137192	he	3884	" He spoke simply , gently , boldly ; standing with the ceremony that he never forgot to show to their chief , where the glow of African sunlight through the casement of the Chambrée fell full across his face , and his eyes met the dark glance of the "
137052	137109	137192	137192	he	3884	" unflinchingly . He never heeded that there was a gay , varied , numerous group behind Châteauroy ; visitors who were looking over the barrack ; he only heeded that his soldiers were unjustly attacked and menaced . The Marquis gave a grim significant smile , that cut like so much cord of the scourge . "
137115	137166	137302	137302	he	3884	" Wherever there is insubordination in the regiment the blame is very certain to be yours ! Corporal Gaston , if you allow your Chambrée to be turned into the riot of a public fair you will soon find yourself degraded from the rank you so signally contrive to disgrace . "
137293	137301	137335	137335	Cecil	628	" Back to your place , sir ! "
137321	137334	137732	137732	He	628	" Teach your men the first formula of obedience at any rate ! "
137724	137731	137809	137809	He	628	" Are those beautiful carvings yours ? "
137829	137838	137845	137845	She	1012	" Yes , Madame , they are mine . "
137839	137844	138064	138064	she	1012	" Ah?—what wonderful skill ! "
138051	138063	138120	138120	She	1012	" You have an exquisite art . They are for sale ? "
138104	138113	138120	138120	She	1012	" They are at your service , Madame . "
138114	138119	138227	138227	He	628	" And their price ? "
138209	138226	138350	138350	She	3919	" Is — the honour of your acceptance , if you will deign to give that . "
138357	138375	138569	138569	he	628	" I thank you . Your very clever work can of course only be mine by purchase . "
138560	138568	138569	138569	he	628	" What a fool I am still ! "
138584	138603	138684	138684	he	628	" I might have fairly forgotten by this time that I ever had the rights of a gentleman . "

Out yonder there , with no cares to think of but my horse and my troop , I am a soldier — and nothing else : so best . I shall be nothing else as long as I live . Pardieu , though ! I do n't know what one wants better : it is a good life , as life goes . One must not turn compliments to great ladies , that is all;—not much of a deprivation there .

142810	142825	142838	142838	she	824	" Mon Dieu ! why , I was never a child in my life , "
142861	143010	143351	143351	Cigarette	689	" When I was two , I used to be beaten , like a Turco that pawns his musket ; when I was three , I used to scrape up the cigar - ends the officers dropped about , to sell them again for a bit of black bread ; when I was four , I knew all about Philippe Durron 's escape from Beylick , and bit my tongue through , to say nothing , when my mother flogged me with a tringlo 's mule - whip because I would not tell , that she might tell again at the Bureau , and get the reward . A child?—diantre ! before I was two feet high I had winged my first Arbi . He stole a rabbit I was roasting . Presto ! how quick he dropped it when my ball broke his wrist like a twig . "
143037	143350	143448	143448	she	689	" But you asked about Marquise ? Well , he was what you are , a hawk among carrion crows , a gentleman in the ranks . Dieu ! how handsome he was ! Nobody ever knew his real name , but they thought he was of Austrian breed , and we called him Marquise because he was so womanish white in his skin and so dainty in all his ways . Just like you ! Marquise could fight , fight like a hundred devils ; and — pouf!—how proud he was;—very much like you altogether ! Now , one day something went wrong in the exercise - ground . Marquise was not to blame , but they thought he was ; and an adjutant struck him — flick , flack , like that — across the face with a riding - switch . Marquise had his bayonet fixed — he belonged to the Zouaves — and before we knew what was up , crash the blade went through — through the breast - bone , and out at the spine — and the adjutant fell as dead as a cat , with the blood spouting out like a fountain . ' I come of a great race , that never took insult without giving back death , ' was all that Marquise said when they seized him , and brought him to judgment : and he would never say of what race that was . They shot him — ah , bah ! discipline must be kept — and I saw him with five great wounds in his chest , and his beautiful golden hair all soiled with the sand and the powder , lying there by the open grave , that they threw him into as if he were offal : and we never knew more of him than that . "
143444	143447	143448	143448	she	689	" Now , "
143453	143477	143482	143482	he	4043	" if you mutiny once they will shoot you just like Marquise , and you will die just as silent , like him . "
143478	143481	143482	143482	he	4043	" Well , "
143487	143529	143548	143548	Cigarette	689	" why not ? Death is no great terror ; I risk it every day for the sake of a common soldier 's rations , why should I not chance it for the sake and in the defence of my honour ? "
143530	143546	143548	143548	Cigarette	689	" Bah ! men sell their honour for their daily bread all the world over ! "
143566	143632	143482	143482	he	4043	" But it is not you alone . See here — one example set on your part , and half your regiment will mutiny too . It is bitter work to obey the Black Hawk , and if you give the signal of revolt , three parts of your comrades will join you . Now what will that end in , beau lion — eh ? "
143633	143646	143657	143657	Cigarette	689	" Tell me ; you are a soldier yourself , you say . "

143707	143929	143987	143987	she	4045	" and I have seen war , not holiday war — but war in earnest — war when men fall like hailstones , and tear like tigers , and choke like mad dogs with their throats full of blood and sand ; when the gun - carriage wheels go crash over the writhing limbs , and the horses charge full gallop over the living faces , and the hoofs beat out the brains before death has stunned them senseless . Oh yes ! I am a soldier , and I will tell you one thing I have seen . I have seen soldiers mutiny , a squadron of them , because they hated their chief and loved two of their sous - officiers ; and I have seen the end of it all — a few hundred men , blind and drunk with despair , at bay against as many thousands , and walled in with four lines of steel and artillery , and fired on from a score of cannon - mouths — volley on volley like the thunder — till not one living man was left , and there was only a shapeless heaving moaning mass , with the black smoke over all . That is what I have seen ; you will not make me see it again ? "

144788	144806	144784	144786	a Turco Indigène	4071	" Ah - ah ! the devil , for a certainty , must have been her father ! "
144811	144824	144872	144872	he	4072	" cried the Friend of the Flag , looking from her elevation ; "
144880	145007	144872	144872	he	4072	" The discomfited Indigène hustled his way with many an oath through the laughing crowd as best he might , and Cigarette , with an airy pirouette on the wine - shop 's roof that would have done honour to any opera boards , and was executed as carelessly , twenty feet above earth , as if she had been a pantomime - dancer all her days , let herself down by the awning , hand over hand like a little mousse from the harbour , jumped on to a forage - waggon that was just passing full trot down the street , and disappeared , standing on the piles of hay , and singing to the driving tringlos ' unutterable delight the stanzas of Béranger 's "
145012	145083	145085	145087	a gallant boy	4077	" her lithe slender miniature form , with its flash of gold on the breast , and its strip of rich scarlet in the fluttering sash , rising out against the blue and burning sky , the glare of the white walls , and the dusky glow and movement of the ebbing and flowing crowd . Cecil looked after her with a certain touch of pity for her in him . "
145095	145769	145085	145087	a gallant boy	4077	" he thought ; the quick flush of her face , the quick withdrawal of her hand he had not noticed ; she had not much interest for him — scarcely any , indeed — save that he saw she was pretty , with a mignonne mischievous face , that all the sun - tan of Africa and all the wild life of the Caserne could not harden or debase . But he was sorry a child so bright and so brave should be turned into three parts a trooper as she was , should have been tossed up on the scum and filth of the lowest barrack - life , and should be doomed in a few years ' time to become the yellow , battered , foul - mouthed , vulture - eyed camp - follower that premature old age would surely render the darling of the tricolour , the pythoness of the As de Pique . Cigarette was making scorn of her doom of Sex , dancing it down , drinking it down , laughing it down , burning it out in tobacco fumes , drowning it in tumbling cascades of wine , trampling it to dust under the cancan by her little brass - bound boots , mocking it away with her slang jests and her Theresa songs , and her devil - may - care audacities , till there was scarce a trace of it left in this prettiest and wildest little scamp of all the Army of Africa . But strive to kill it how she would , her sex would have its revenge one day and play Nemesis to her . She was bewitching now ; bewitching , though she had no witchery for him , in her youth . But when the bloom should leave her brown cheeks , and the laughter die out of her lightning glance , the womanhood she had defied would assert itself , and avenge itself , and be hideous in the sight of the men who now loved the tinkling of those little spurred feet , and shouted with applause to hear the reckless barrack - blasphemies ring their mirth from that fresh mouth which was now like a bud from a damask rose - branch , though even now it steeped itself in wine , and sullied itself with oaths and seared itself with smoke , and had never been touched from its infancy with any kiss that was innocent , not even with its mother 's . And there was a deep tinge of pity for her in Cecil 's thoughts as he watched her out of sight , and then strolled across to the café opposite to finish his cigar beneath its orange - striped awning . The child had been flung upward , a little straw floating in the gutter of Paris iniquities ; a little foam - bell bubbling on the sewer waters of barrack - vice ; the stick had been her teacher , the baggage - waggon her cradle , the camp - dogs her playfellows , the caserne oaths her lullaby , the guidons her sole guiding - stars , the razzia her sole fête - day : it was little marvel that the bright , bold , insolent little Friend of the Flag had nothing left of her sex save a kitten 's mischief and a coquette 's archness . It said much rather for the straight fair sunlit instincts of the untaught nature , that Cigarette had gleaned , even out of such a life , two virtues that she would have held by to the death , if tried ; a truthfulness that would have scorned a lie as only fit for cowards , and a loyalty that cleaved to France as a religion . Cecil thought that a gallant boy was spoiled in this eighteen - year - old brunette of a campaigner ; he might have gone further , and said that a hero was lost . "
145772	146159	145085	145087	a gallant boy	4077	" said Cigarette between her little teeth . She stood in the glittering Algerine night , brilliant with a million stars , and balmy with a million flowers , before the bronze trellised gate of the villa on the Sahel , where Châteauroy when he was not on active service — which chanced rarely , for he was one of the finest soldiers and most daring chiefs in Africa — indemnified himself with the magnificence that his private fortune enabled him to enjoy , for the unsparing exertions and the rugged privations that he always shared willingly with the lowest of his soldiers . It was the grandest trait in the man 's character that he utterly scorned the effeminacy which many commanders provided for their table , their comfort , and their gratification whilst campaigning , and would commonly neither take himself nor allow to his officers any more indulgence on the march than his troopers themselves enjoyed . But his villa on the Sahel was a miniature palace ; it had formerly been the harem of a great Rais , and the gardens were as enchanting as the interior was , if something florid , still as elegant as Paris art and Paris luxury could make it ; for ferocious as the Black Hawk was in war , and well as he loved the chase and the slaughter , he did not disdain , when he had whetted beak and talons to satiety , to smoothe his ruffled plumage in downy nests and under caressing hands . To - night the windows of the pretty , low , snow - white , far - stretching building were lighted and open , and through the wilderness of cactus , myrtle , orange , citron , fuchsia , and a thousand flowers that almost buried it under their weight of leaf and blossom , a myriad of lamps were gleaming like so many glow - worms beneath the foliage , while from a cedar grove some slight way farther out , the melodies and overtures of the best military bands in Algiers came mellowed , though not broken , by the distance , and the fall of the bubbling fountains . Cigarette looked and listened , and her gay brown face grew duskily warm with wrath . "
146164	146180	147414	147414	he	4089	" she muttered , as she pressed her pretty lips to the lattice - work . "
146317	146435	146291	146293	M. le Colonel	711	" Cigarette was a resolute little democrat ; she had loaded the carbines behind the barricade in an émeute in Paris before she was ten years old , and was not seldom in the perplexity of conflicting creeds when her loyalty to the tricolour and the guidons smote with a violent clash on her love for the populace and their liberty . She was given , however , usually to reconciling the dilemma with all her sex 's illogical ingenuity , and so far thoroughly carried out her republicanism that she boxed a Prince 's ear without ceremony when one tried to subjugate her , and never by any chance veiled the sun of her smiles to her "
146437	146806	146291	146293	M. le Colonel	711	" the troopers — not even when she was tired to death after a burning march across leagues on leagues of locust - wasted country , or had spent half the night , after a skirmish , dressing wounds , soothing fever , seeking out the dying men who lay scattered on the outskirts of the field of carnage , with a magic and a sweetness , and a patience that seemed rather fitting for the gentle Soeurs Grises than for the wayward , mischievous , insolent young reveller of the As de Pique . She looked a moment longer through the gilded scroll - work ; then , as she had done once before , thrust her pistols well within her sash that they should not catch upon the boughs , and pushing herself through the prickly cactus hedge , impervious to anything save herself or a Barbary marmoset , twisted with marvellous ingenuity through the sharp - pointed leaves and the close barriers of spines , and launched herself with inimitable dexterity on to the other side of the cacti . Cigarette had too often played a game at spying and reconnoitring for her regiments , and played it with a cleverness that distanced even the most rusé of the Zéphyrs , not to be able to do just whatever she chose , in taking the way she liked , and lurking unseen at discretion . She crossed the breadth of the grounds under the heavy shade of arbutus - trees with a hare 's fleetness , and stood a second looking at the open windows and the terraces that lay before them , brightly lighted by the summer moon and by the lamps that sparkled among the shrubs . Then down she dropped , as quickly , as lightly , as a young setter down charging among the ferns , into a shower of rhododendrons , whose rose and lilac blossoms shut her wholly within them like a fairy enclosed in bloom . The good fairy of one life there she was assuredly , though she might be but a devil - may - care , audacious , careless little feminine Belphégor and military Asmodeus . "
146809	146978	147018	147020	A true soldier	4087	" she said , quickly and sharply , with a deep - drawn breath . The single ejaculation was at once a menace , a tenderness , a whirlwind of rage , a volume of disdain , a world of pity . It was intensely French , and the whole nature of Cigarette was in it . Yet all she saw was a small and brilliant group sauntering to and fro before the open windows , after dinner , listening to the bands , which , through dinner , had played to them , and laughing low and softly ; and , at some distance from them , beneath the shade of a cedar , the figure of a Corporal of Chasseurs , calm , erect , motionless , as though he were the figure of a soldier cast in bronze . The scene was simple enough , though very picturesque ; but it told , by its vivid force of contrast , a whole history to Cigarette . "
146983	147017	147414	147414	he	4089	" she muttered , where she lay among the rhododendrons , while her eyes grew very soft , as she gave the highest word of praise that her whole range of language held . "
147034	147411	147414	147414	he	4089	" She looked awhile , very wistfully , at the Chasseur , where he stood under the Lebanon boughs ; then her glance swept bright as a hawk 's over the terrace , and lighted with a prescient hatred on the central form of all — a woman 's . There were two other great ladies there ; but she passed them , and darted with unerring instinct on that proud , fair , patrician head , with its haughty stag - like carriage and the crown of its golden hair . Cigarette had seen grandes dames by the thousand , though never very close ; seen them in Paris , when they came to look on at a grand review ; seen them in their court attire , when the Guides had filled the Carrousel on some palace ball night , and lined the Cour des Princes , and she had bewitched the officers of the guard into letting her pass in to see the pageantry . But she had never felt for those grandes dames anything save a considerably contemptuous indifference . She had looked on them pretty much as a war - worn powder - tried veteran looks on the curled dandy of some fashionable home - staying corps . She had never realised the difference betwixt them and herself , save in so far as she thought them useless butterflies , worth nothing at all , and laughed as she triumphantly remembered how she could shoot a man like any Tirailleur , and break in a colt like any rough - rider . Now , for the first time , the sight of one of those aristocrats smote her with a keen hot sting of heart - burning jealousy . Now , for the first time , the little Friend of the Flag looked at all the nameless graces of rank with an envy that her sunny , gladsome , generous nature had never before been touched with — with a sudden perception , quick as thought , bitter as gall , wounding , and swift , and poignant , of what this womanhood , that he had said she herself had lost , might be in its highest and purest shape . "
147420	147518	147537	147537	he	4089	" she mused , while her teeth clenched on the ruby fulness of her lips , and her heart swelled , half with impotent rage , half with unconfessed pain . For the first time , looking on this imperial foreign beauty , sweeping so slowly and so idly along there in the Algerian star - light , she understood all that he had missed , all that he had meant , when he had used that single word , for which she had vowed on him her vengeance and the vengeance of the Army of Africa . "
147546	147724	147727	147727	she	4092	" was the latent , unacknowledged thought that was so cruel to her : the consciousness — which forced itself in on her , while her eyes jealously followed the perfect grace of the one in whom instinct had found her rival — that , while she had been so proud of her recklessness , and her devilry , and her trooper 's slang , and her deadly skill as a shot , she had only been something very worthless , something very lightly held by those who liked her for a ribald jest , and a guinguette dance , and a Spahis ' supper of headlong riot and drunken mirth . The mood did not last . She was too brave , too fiery , too dauntless , too untamed . The dusky angry flush upon her face grew deeper , and the passion gathered more stormily in her eyes , while she felt the pistol - butts in her sash , and laughed low to herself , where she lay stretched under her flowery nest . "
147742	147751	147937	147937	You	4094	" she thought , with her old disdain , "
147806	147936	147950	147950	Madame	815	" Like many another , Cigarette underrated what she had no knowledge of , and depreciated an antagonist the measure of whose fence she had no power to gauge . Crouched there among the rhododendrons , she lay as still as a mouse , moving nearer and nearer , though none would have told that so much as a lizard even stirred under the blossoms , until her ear , quick and unerring as an Indian 's , could detect the sense of the words spoken by that group , which so aroused all the hot ire of her warrior 's soul and her democrat 's impatience . Châteauroy himself was bending his fine dark head towards the patrician on whom her instinct of sex had fastened her hatred . "
147952	147975	147984	147984	He	3280	" he was murmuring now , as Cigarette got close enough under her flower shadows to catch the sense of the words . "
147990	147991	147997	147997	you	4094	" "
148006	148026	147997	147997	you	4094	" muttered the Friend of the Flag to herself , with the passion in her burning more hotly against that "
148030	148048	148223	148223	Victor	819	" whose delicate train was sweeping the white marbles of Châteauroy 's terraces , and whose reply , "
148059	148222	148225	148227	Madame la Princesse	815	" she lost , though she could guess what it had been , when a lacquey crossed the lawn , and summoned the Chasseur from his waiting - place beneath the cedars . Cecil obeyed , passed up the terrace stairs , and stood before his Colonel , giving the salute ; the shade of some acacias still fell across him , whilst the party he fronted were in all the glow of a full Algerian moon , and of the thousand lamps among the belt of flowers and trees . Cigarette gave another sharp deep - drawn breath , and lay as mute and motionless as she had done before then among the rushes of some dried brook 's bed , scanning a hostile Kabyl camp , when the fate of a handful of French troops had rested on her surety and her caution . Châteauroy spoke with a carelessness of a man to a dog , turning to his Corporal . "
148243	148277	148225	148227	Madame la Princesse	815	" The savage authority of his general speech was softened for sake of his guest 's presence , but there was a covert tone in the words that made Cigarette murmur to herself : "
148289	148578	148582	148583	a sculptor	4099	" Cecil had not forgotten it ; neither had he forgotten the lesson that this fair aristocrate had read him in the morning . He saluted his chief again , set the chess - box down upon the ledge of the marble balus - trade and stood silent , without once glancing at the fair and haughty face that was more brilliant still in the African starlight than it had been in the noon sun of the Chasseurs ' Chambrée . Courtesy was forbidden him as insult from a Corporal to a nobly born beauty ; he no more quarrelled with the decree than with other inevitable consequences , inevitable degradations , that followed on his entrance as a private under the French flag . He had been used to the impassable demarcations of Caste , he did not dispute them more now that he was without , than he had done when within , their magic pale . The carvings were passed from hand to hand as the Marquis 's six or eight guests , listlessly willing to be amused in the warmth of the evening after their dinner , occupied themselves with the ivory chess armies , cut with a skill and a finish worthy a Roman studio . Praise enough was awarded to the art , but none of them remembered the artist who stood apart , grave , calm , with a certain serene dignity that could not be degraded because others chose to treat him as the station he filled gave them fit right to do . Only one glanced at him with a touch of wondering pity , softening her pride ; she who had rejected the gift of those mimic squadrons . "
148587	148606	148609	148609	Madame	8858	" she asked him , with that graceful distant kindness which she might have shown some Arab outcast . "
148611	148612	148609	148609	Madame	8858	" "
148623	148624	148634	148634	Madame	8858	" "
148636	148669	148689	148691	A common teacher	4103	" She looked at him with an increased interest : the accent of his voice told her that this man , whatever he might be now , had once been a gentleman . "
148687	148688	148693	148693	Madame	8858	" "
148697	148715	148693	148693	Madame	8858	" There was a very sweet gleam of compassion in the lustre of her dark dreaming eyes . "
148723	148724	148800	148800	Victor	819	" "
148742	148799	148804	148804	he	819	" Châteauroy had stood by and heard , with as much impatience as he cared to show before guests whose rank was precious to the man who had still weakness enough to be ashamed that his father 's brave and famous life had first been cradled under the thatch roof of a little posting - house . "
148819	148825	148878	148879	That man	3064	" he said , carelessly ; "
148852	148877	148878	148879	That man	3064	" She whom he had called Madame la Princesse looked with a doubting surprise at the sculptor of the white Arab King she held . "
148886	148890	148922	148922	you	3064	" she thought . "
148915	148920	148932	148932	I	0	" she said aloud . "
148929	148930	148932	148932	I	0	" "
148934	148951	148972	148972	You	3064	" said Châteauroy , with a dash of his camp tone that he could not withhold . "
148970	148971	148980	148982	M. de Châteauroy	709	" "
148984	149008	149022	149022	men	6265	" said the lady , with a smile , that , slight as it was , made the Marquis 's eyes flash fire . "
149016	149021	149047	149047	he	4121	" he answered her ; "
149044	149045	149047	149047	he	4121	" "
149052	149066	149047	149047	he	4121	" thought Miladi , while she laid aside the White King once more . "
149069	149080	149047	149047	he	4121	" interposed Châteauroy , recovering his momentary self - abandonment , "
149095	149096	149113	149113	he	4125	" "
149117	149122	149127	149127	you	4123	" Châteauroy swung round . "
149144	149201	149248	149249	The man	6254	" Cecil stood silent ; his eyes met his chief 's steadily ; Châteauroy had seen that look when his Chasseur had bearded him in the solitude of his tent , and demanded back the Pearl of the Desert . The Princess glanced at both ; then she stooped her elegant head slightly to the Marquis . "
149246	149247	149248	149249	The man	6254	" "
149259	149273	149336	149336	He	6254	" muttered her host , as he motioned Cecil back off the terrace . "
149297	149335	149336	149336	He	6254	" The words were low , that they should not offend the ears of the great ladies who were his listeners , but they were coarsely savage in their whispered command , and the Princess heard them . "
149347	149546	149583	149583	You	4134	" thought Miladi with the same thought that flashed through the mind of the little Friend of the Flag where she hid among her rhododendrons . Now the dainty aristocrat was very proud , but she was not so proud but that justice was stronger in her than pride , and a noble generous temper mellowed the somewhat too cold and languid negligence of one of the fairest and haughtiest women that ever adorned a court . She was too generous not to rescue any one who suffered through her the slightest injustice , not to interfere when through her any misconception lighted on another ; she told with her sex 's rapid perception and sympathy that the man , whom Châteauroy addressed with the brutal insolence of a bully to his disobedient dog , had once been a gentleman , though he now held but the rank of a sous - officier in the Algerian Cavalry , and she saw that he suffered all the more keenly under an outrage he had no power to resist because of that enforced serenity , that dignity of silence and of patience , with which he stood before his tyrant . "
149549	149582	149767	149767	I	0	" she said , moving a little towards them , while she let her eyes rest on the carver of the sculptures with a grave compassion , though she addressed his chief . "
149664	149766	149822	149822	Madame	8858	" The words were spoken with a gracious courtesy , the clear cold tone of her habitual manner just marking in them still the difference of caste between her and the man for whom she interceded , as she would equally have interceded for a dog who should have been threatened with the lash because he had displeased her . That very tone struck a sharper blow to Cecil than the insolence of his commander had power to deal him . His face flushed a little ; he lifted his cap to her with a grave reverence , and moved away : "
149784	149811	149822	149822	Madame	8858	" The words reached only her ear ; in another instant he had passed away down the terrace steps , obedient to his chief 's dismissal . "
149824	149848	149957	149957	they	4147	" Châteauroy laughed to her , as she still held in her hand , doubtfully , the White Sheik of the chess Arabs ; "
149963	149964	149957	149957	they	4147	" "
149968	149977	149992	149992	he	3064	" she said , with an indolent indifference ; "
149998	149999	149992	149992	he	3064	" "
150003	150008	150067	150067	his	4158	" answered the Marquis . "
150076	150077	150089	150089	I	0	" "
150087	150088	150199	150199	he	3279	" "
150175	150196	150205	150205	you	0	" She let her glance dwell on him with a contemplation that was half contemptuous amusement , half unexpressed dissent . "
150213	150231	150234	150234	I.	0	" she said , with a slight smile lingering about the proud rich softness of her lips . "
150235	150264	150267	150267	he	3279	" There was a gaunt , grim stern significance in the three monosyllables that escaped him unconsciously ; it made her turn and look at him more closely . "
150271	150281	150377	150377	I	0	" she asked . Châteauroy laughed off the question . "
150352	150376	150377	150377	I	0	" She listened with something of distaste upon her face where she still leaned against the marble balustrade toying with the ivory Bedouins . "
150386	150392	150460	150460	you	4171	" she said , coldly , "
150482	150505	150565	150565	you	4171	" Châteauroy , more incensed than he chose or dared to show , bowed courteously , but with a grim ironic smile . "
150586	150788	150565	150565	you	4171	" She bent her superb head silently , whether in acquiescence or rejection he could not well resolve with himself , and turned to the staff - officers , among them the heir of a princely semi - royal French House , who surrounded her , and sorely begrudged the moments she had given to those miniature carvings and the private soldier who had wrought them . She was no coquette ; she was of too imperial a nature , had too lofty a pride , and was too difficult to charm or to enchain ; but those meditative , brilliant , serene eyes had a terrible gift of wakening without ever seeking love , and of drawing without ever recompensing homage . Couched down among her rose - hued covert , Cigarette had watched and heard , her teeth set tightly , her breath coming and going swiftly , her hand clenched close on the butts of her pistols , fiery curses , with all the infinite variety in cursing of a barrack répertoire , chasing one another in hot fast mutterings off those bright lips , that should have known nothing except a child 's careless and innocent song . "
150799	150959	151088	151088	he	4177	" she whispered every now and then to herself , with a new , bitter , ferocious meaning in the whisper that had , with all its hate , something pathetic too . She had never looked at a beautiful high - bred woman before , holding them in gay satirical disdain as mere papillons rouants who could not prime a revolver and fire it off to save their own lives , if ever such need arose ; a depth of ignorance that was , to the vivandière 's view , the ne plus ultra of crassitude and impotence . But now she studied one through all the fine , quickened , unerring instincts of jealousy ; and there is no instinct in the world that gives such thorough appreciation of the very rival it reviles . She saw the courtly negligence , the regal grace , the fair brilliant loveliness , the delicious serene languor , of a pure "
150961	151084	151085	151085	I	0	" for the very first time to note them , and they made her heart sick with a new and deadly sense ; they moved her much as the white delicate carvings of the lotus - lilies and the lentiscus - leaves had done ; they , like the carvings , showed her all she had missed . She dropped her head suddenly like a wounded bird , and the racy vindictive camp - oaths died off her lips . She thought of herself as she had danced that mad bacchic bamboula amidst the crowd of shouting , stamping , drunken , half - infuriated soldiery , and for the moment she hated herself more even than she hated that patrician yonder . "
151092	151299	151302	151302	she	4178	" she pondered , and her spirited , sparkling , brunette face was dark and weary , like a brown sun - lightened brook over whose radiance the heavy shadow of some broad - spread eagle 's wings hovers , hiding the sun . She looked once , twice , thrice , more inquiringly , envyingly , thirstily ; then , as the band under the cedars rolled out their music afresh , and light laughter echoed to her from the terrace , she turned and wound herself back under the cover of the shrubs , not joyously and mischievously as she had come , but almost as slowly , almost as sadly , as a hare that the greyhounds have coursed drags itself through the grasses and ferns . Once through the cactus hedge her old spirit returned ; she shook herself angrily with petulant self - scorn ; she she swore a little , and felt that the fierce familiar words did her good like brandy pured down her throat ; she tossed her head like a colt that rebels against the gall of the curb ; then , fleet as a fawn , she dashed down the moonlit road at top most speed . "
151310	151608	152365	152366	ami Victor	819	" she thought . And she ran the faster , and sang a drinking - song of the Spahis all the louder , because still at her heart a dull pain was aching . Cigarette always went fast . She had a bird - like way of skimming her ground that took her over it with wonderful swiftness , all the tassels , and ribbon - knots , and sashes with which her uniform was rendered so gay and so distinctive fluttering behind her , and her little military boots , with the bright spurs twinkling , flying over the earth too lightly for a speck of dust , though it lay thick as August suns could parch it , to rest upon her . Thus she went now , along the lovely moonlight , singing her drinking - song so fast and so loud that had it been any other than this young fire - eater of the African squadrons it might have been supposed she sang out of fear and bravado — two things , however , that never touched Cigarette ; for she exulted in danger as friskily as a young salmon exults in the first fresh , crisp , tumbling crest of a sea - wave , and would have backed up the most vain - glorious word she could have spoken with the cost of her life , had need been . Suddenly , as she went , she heard a shout on the still night air — very still now , that the lights , and the melodies , and the laughter of Châteauroy 's villa lay far behind , and the town of Algiers was yet distant , with its lamps glittering down by the sea . The shout was , "
151618	151639	152365	152366	ami Victor	819	" And Cigarette knew the voice , ringing melodiously and calmly still , though it gave the sound of alarm . "
151644	152341	152365	152366	ami Victor	819	" she cried in answer ; she had cried it many a time over the heat of battle - fields , and when the wounded men in the dead of the sickly night writhed under the knife of the camp - thieves . If she had gone like the wind before , she went like the lightning now . A few yards onward she saw a confused knot of horses and of riders struggling one with another in a cloud of white dust , silvery and hazy in the radiance of the moon . The centre figure was Cecil 's ; the four others were Arabs , armed to the teeth and mad with drink , who had spent the whole day in drunken debauchery , pouring in raki down their throats until they were wild with its poisonous fire , and had darted head - long all abreast down out of the town overriding all that came in their way , and lashing their poor beasts with their sabres till the horses ' flanks ran blood . Just as they neared Cecil , they had knocked aside and trampled over a worn - out old colon , of age too feeble for him to totter in time from their path . Cecil had reined up and shouted to them to pause ; they , inflamed with the perilous drink , and senseless with the fury which seems to posses every Arab once started in a race neck to neck , were too blind to see , and too furious to care , that they were faced by a soldier of France , but rode down on him at once , with their curled sabres flashing round their heads . His horse stood the shock gallantly , and he sought at first only to parry their thrusts and to cut through their stallions ' reins ; but the latter were chain bridles , and only notched his sword as the blade struck them , and the former became too numerous and too savagely dealt to be easily played with in carte and tierce . The Arabs were dead - drunk , he saw at a glance , and had got the blood - thirst upon them ; roused and burning with brandy and raki , these men were like tigers to deal with ; the words he had spoken they never heard , and their horses hemmed him in powerless , whilst their steel flashed on every side;—they were not of the tribe of the Khalifa . If he struck not , and struck not surely , he saw that a few moments more of that moonlight night were all that he would live . He wished to avoid bloodshed , both because his sympathies were always with the conquered tribes , and because he knew that every one of these quarrels and combats between the vanquisher and the vanquished served further to widen the breach , already broad enough , between them . But it was no longer a matter of choice with him , as his shoulder was grazed by a thrust which , but for a swerve of his horse , would have pierced to his lungs ; and the four riders , yelling like madmen , forced the animal back on its haunches and assaulted him with breathless violence . He swept his own arm back , and brought his sabre down straight through the sword - arm of the foremost ; the limb was cleft through as if the stroke of an axe had servered it , and , thrice infuriated , the Arabs closed in on him . The points of their weapons were piercing his harness when , sharp and swift , one on another , three shots hissed past him ; the nearest of his assailants fell stone dead , and the others , wounded and startled , loosed their hold , and tore off down the lonely road , while the dead man 's horse , shaking his burden from him out of the stirrups , followed them at a headlong gallop through a cloud of dust . "
152368	152459	152460	152460	I	0	" said Cigarette , carelessly , as she thrust her pistols back into her sash , and looked , with the tranquil appreciation of a connoisseur , on the brown , brawny , naked limb , where it lay severed on the sand , with the hilt of the weapon still hanging in the sinewy fingers . Cecil threw himself from his saddle and gazed at her in bewildered amazement ; he had thought those sure , cool , death - dealing shots had come from some Spahis or Chasseur . "
152466	152472	152479	152481	the fellow dead	4180	" he said , rapidly . "
152483	152498	152506	152507	a bungler	4181	" Cigarette shrugged her shoulders with a contemptuous glance at the Bedouin 's corpse . "
152509	152510	152528	152528	me	0	" "
152539	152561	152562	152564	Pas si béte	504	" Cigarette laughed , offended and scornful , as with the offence and scorn of one whose first science was impeached . "
152593	152702	152704	152704	you	4179	" She was at her fiercest . A thousand new emotions had been roused in her that night , bringing pain with them , that she bitterly resented ; and , moreover , this child of the Army of Africa caught fire at the flame of battle with instant contagion , and had seen slaughter around her from her first infancy . Cecil , disregarding her protest , stooped and raised the fallen Bedouin . He saw at a glance that she was right ; the lean , dark , lustful face was set in the rigidity of death ; the bullet had passed straight through the temples . "
152712	152767	152796	152796	Pardieu	671	" demanded Cigarette , impatiently , as he lingered;—even in this moment he had more thought of this Arbico than he had of her ! He laid the Arab 's body gently down , and looked at her with a glance that , rightly or wrongly , she thought had a rebuke in it . "
152794	152795	152825	152825	I	0	" "
152835	152853	152825	152825	I	0	" Her eyes were flashing , her lips very scornful and wrathful . This was his gratitude ! "
152858	152877	152911	152911	I	0	" said Cecil , rapidly , laying his hand on her shoulder , as she flung herself away . "
152918	152919	152931	152931	I	0	" "
152937	152979	152931	152931	I	0	" The word had rankled in her ; she could launch it now with telling reprisal . He smiled ; but he saw that this phrase , which she had overheard , had not alone incensed , but had wounded her . "
152987	152993	153066	153066	they	4187	" he said , gently . "
153075	153110	153116	153116	I	0	" The answer failed to conciliate her ; there was an accent of compassion in it that ill suited her pride , and a lack of admiration that was not less new and unwelcome . "
153133	153141	153202	153202	you	0	" she pursued , with immeasurable disdain . "
153198	153199	153202	153202	you	0	" "
153207	153215	153218	153218	I	0	" he asked , in some surprise . "
153222	153239	153240	153240	I	0	" answered Cigarette , with a toss of her head southward to where the villa lay . "
153251	153252	153257	153257	I	0	" "
153261	153277	153295	153295	you	0	" She gave her little teeth a sharp click like the click of a trigger . "
153292	153293	153297	153297	I	0	" "
153304	153305	153319	153319	him	828	" "
153321	153322	153319	153319	him	828	" "
153326	153427	153430	153430	you	0	" She knitted her pretty brows , standing there in his path , with the pistols thrust in her sash , and her hands resting lightly on her hips as a good workman rests after a neatly finished job , and her dainty fez set half on one side on her brown tangled curls , while upon them the intense lustre of the moonlight streamed , and in the dust , well - nigh at their feet , lay the gaunt white - robed form of the dead Arab , with the olive saturnine face turned upward to the stars . "
153439	153446	153456	153456	she	4192	" she asked him , abruptly . "
153450	153451	153481	153481	She	4192	" "
153479	153480	153494	153494	Diantre	841	" "
153492	153493	153496	153496	You	0	" "
153509	153510	153496	153496	You	0	" "
153514	153515	153578	153578	her	4192	" "
153583	153584	153578	153578	her	4192	" "
153588	153794	153578	153578	her	4192	" He said it with his habitual gentle temper , but there was a shadow of pain in the words . The chessmen had become in some sort like living things to him , through long association ; he had parted from them not without regret , though , for the moment , courtesy and generosity of instinct had overcome it ; and he knew that it was but too true how , in all likelihood these trifles of his art , that had brought him many a solace and been his companion through many a lonely hour , would be forgotten by the morrow , where he had bestowed them , and at best put aside in a cabinet to lie unnoticed among bronzes or porcelain , or be set on some boudoir - table to be idled with in the mimic warfare that would serve to cover some listless flirtation . Cigarette , quick to sting , but as quick to repent using her sting , saw the regret in him ; with the rapid uncalculating liberality of an utterly unselfish and intensely impulsive nature , she hastened to make amends by saying what was like gall on her tongue in the utterance . "
153797	153803	153875	153875	She	4192	" she said , quickly . "
153873	153874	153875	153875	She	4192	" "
153878	153894	154006	154007	Corporal Victor	804	" She saw his glance brighten as it turned on her in a surprised gratification . "
153903	154005	154186	154186	I	0	" Cigarette asked it with a certain petulance and doggedness , taking a namesake out of her breast - pocket , biting its end off , and striking a fusee . A word from this aristocrat was more welcome to him than a bullet that had saved his life ! Her generosity had gone very far , and , like most generosity , got nothing for its pains . He was silent a few moments , tracing lines in the dust with the point of his scabbard . Cigarette , with the cigar in her mouth , stamped her foot impatiently . "
154030	154185	154186	154186	I	0	" She was angered by him ; she was in the mood to make herself seem all the rougher , fiercer , naughtier , and more callous . She had shot the man — pouf ! what of that ? She had shot men before , as all Africa knew . She would defend a half - fledged bird , a terrified sheep , a worn - out old cur ; but a man ! Men were the normal and natural food for pistols and rifles , she considered . A state of society in which fire - arms had been unknown was a thing Cigarette had never heard of , and in which she would have contumeliously disbelieved if she had been told of it . Cecil looked up from his musing ; he thought what a pity it was this pretty graceful French kitten was such a bloodthirsty young panther at heart . "
154193	154200	154186	154186	I	0	" he answered her , doubtfully . "
154219	154220	154239	154239	I	0	" "
154226	154238	154282	154283	The crows	4205	" said Cigarette , decidedly and with a certain haughty patronage . "
154289	154338	154282	154283	The crows	4205	" The coolness with which this handsome child disposed of the fate of what , a moment or two before , had been a sentient , breathing , vigorous frame , sent a chill through her hearer , though he had been seasoned by a decade of slaughter . "
154341	154347	154383	154383	Parbleu	810	" he said , briefly . "
154366	154367	154383	154383	Parbleu	810	" "
154375	154382	154439	154441	an eccentric fellow	4212	" cried Cigarette , in derision . "
154445	154451	154473	154473	I	0	" He laughed a little . "
154481	154482	154492	154492	you	0	" "
154483	154489	154784	154784	I	0	Eh?"—she did not understand him . "
154599	154780	154800	154800	you	4217	" A momentary pathos softened her voice ( which could melt and change into a wonderful music ) , where she stood in the glistening moonlight . That the time would ever come when her glad laughter would be hushed , when her young heart would beat no more , when the bright , abundant , passionate blood would bound no longer through her veins , when all the vivacious , vivid , sensuous charms of living would be ended for her for ever , was a thing that she could no better bring home to her than a bird that sings in the light of the sun could be made to know that the time would come when its little melodious throat would be frozen in death , and give song never more . The tone touched him ; made him think less of her as a dare - devil boy , as a reckless child - soldier , and more of her as what she was , than he had done before : he touched her almost caressingly . "
154808	154833	154836	154836	I	0	" Cigarette , though accustomed to the lawless loves of the camp , flushed ever so slightly at the mere caress of his hand . "
154840	154846	154885	154885	Pardi	844	" she said , rapidly . "
154897	154898	154901	154901	you	844	" "
154909	154910	155042	155042	you	844	" "
155022	155023	155033	155033	Cigarette	689	" "
155035	155036	155058	155058	I	0	" "
155068	155092	155110	155110	I	0	" She vaulted , as she spoke , into the saddle ; he laid his hand on the bridle , and stopped her . "
155117	155380	155421	155421	I	0	" For a moment the bright , brown , changeful face , that could look so fiercely scornful , so sunnily radiant , so tempestuously passionate , and so tenderly childlike , in almost the same moment , grew warm as the warm suns that had given their fire to her veins ; she glanced at him almost shyly , while the moonlight slept lustrously in the dark softness of her eyes ; there was an intense allurement in her in that moment — the allurement of a woman 's loveliness , bitterly as she disdained a woman 's charms . It might have told him , more plainly than words , how best he could reward her for the shot that had saved him ; yet , though a man on whom such beguilement usually worked only too easily and too often , it did not now touch him . He was grateful to her ; but , despite himself , he was cold to her ; despite himself , the life which that little hand that he held had taken so lightly made it the hand of a comrade to be grasped in alliance , but never the hand of a mistress to steal to his lips and to lie in his breast . Her rapid and unerring instinct made her feel that keenly and instantly ; she had seen too much passion not to know when it was absent . The warmth passed off her face , her teeth clenched , she shook the bridle out of his hold . "
155429	155461	155468	155468	her	839	" In another instant she was away like a sirocco , a whirlwind of dust that rose in the moonlight marking her flight as she rode full gallop down to Algiers . "
155470	155780	155789	155789	she	4231	" thought Cecil , as he seated himself on a broken pile of stone to keep his vigil over the dead Arab . It was not that he was callous to the generous nature of the little Friend of the Flag , or that he was insensible either of the courage that beat so dauntlessly in her pulses , or of the piquant picturesque grace that accompanied even her wildest actions ; but she had nothing of her sex 's charm for him . He thought of her rather as a young soldier than as a young girl . She amused him as a wayward , bright , mischievous , audacious boy might have done ; but she had no other interest for him . He had given her little attention ; a waltz , a cigar , a passing jest , were all he had bestowed on the little lionne of the Spahis corps ; and the deepest sentiment she had ever awakened in him was an involuntary pity — pity for this flower which blossomed on the polluted field of war , and under the poison - dropping branches of lawless crime . A flower bright - hued , sun - fed , glancing with the dews of youth now , when it had just unclosed , in all its earliest beauty but already soiled and tainted by the bed from which it sprang , and doomed to be swept away with time , scentless and loveless , down the rapid noxious current of that broad black stream of vice on which it now floated so heedlessly . Even now , his thoughts drifted fram her almost before the sound of the horse 's hoofs had died where he sat on a loose pile of stones , with the lifeless limbs of the Arab at his feet . "
155793	155810	155468	155468	her	839	" he was musing . It was the deep - blue , dreaming , haughty eyes of "
155812	156001	156039	156040	Adjutant Vireflau	846	" that he was bringing back to memory , not the brown mignon face that had been so late close to his in the light of the moon . Meanwhile , on his good grey Cigarette rode like a true Chasseur herself . She was used to the saddle , and would ride a wild desert colt without stirrup or bridle , balancing her supple form now on one foot now on the other on the animal 's naked back , while they flew at full speed , with a skill and address that would have distanced the best heroines of manège and hippodrome . Not so fantastically , but full as speedily , she dashed down into the city , scattering all she met with right and left , till she rode straight up to the barracks of the Chasseurs d ' Afrique . At the entrance , as she reined up , she saw the very person she wanted , and signed him to her as carelessly as if he were a conscript , instead of that powerful officer , François Vireflau , captain and adjutant . "
156004	156038	156257	156258	a corporal	3255	" she cried , as she signalled him ; Cigarette was privileged all through the army , and would have given the langue verte to the Emperor himself , had she met him . "
156260	156317	156257	156258	a corporal	3255	" Vireflau listened attentively — a short , lean , black - visaged campaigner , who yet relaxed into a grim half - smile as the vivandière addressed him with that air as of a generalissimo addressing a subordinate , which always characterised Cigarette the more strongly the higher the grade of her companion or opponent . "
156324	156328	156330	156330	you	4242	" he growled . "
156339	156340	156589	156595	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" "
156450	156588	156589	156595	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" With which command , given as with the air of a commander - in - chief , in its hauteur and its nonchalance , Cigarette vaulted off the charger , flung the bridle to a soldier , and was away and out of sight before François Vireflau had time to consider whether he should laugh at her caprices , as all the army did , or resent her insolence to his dignity . But he was a good - natured man , and , what was better , a just one ; and Cigarette had judged rightly that the tale she had told would weigh well with him to the credit side of his Corporal ; and would not reach his Colonel in any warped version that could give pretext for any fresh exercise of tyranny over "
156596	156601	156589	156595	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" under the title of "
156604	156605	156628	156628	I	0	" "
156610	156627	156813	156814	ma belle	3221	" thought his champion , as she made her way through the gay - lit streets . "
156703	156775	156813	156814	ma belle	3221	" A grand and misty generality which consoled Cigarette for an abandonment of her sworn revenge , which she felt was a weakness utterly unworthy of her , and too much like that inconsequent weather - cock , that useless insignificant part of creation , those objects of her supreme derision and contempt , those frivolous trifles which she wondered the good God had ever troubled himself to make — namely , "
156779	156780	156783	156783	Cigarette	689	" "
156785	156807	156821	156822	the devil	3300	" cried the Zouave Tata , leaning out of a little casement of the As de Pique as she passed it . "
156828	156829	156821	156822	the devil	3300	" "
156833	156841	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" retorted the Friend of the Flag . "
156858	156967	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" Through the window , and over the sturdy shoulders in their canvas shirt of the hero Tata , the room was visible , full of smoke , through which the lights glimmered like the sun in a fog , reeking with bad wines , crowded with laughing bearded faces , and the battered beauty of women revellers , while on the table , singing with a voice Mario himself could not have rivalled for exquisite sweetness , was a slender Zouave , gesticulating with the most marvellous pantomime , while his melodious tones rolled out the obscenest and wittiest ballad that ever was carolled in a guinguette . "
156975	156985	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" entreated Tata , stretching out his brawny arms . "
157005	157006	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" "
157017	157169	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" said Cigarette , with a glance into the chamber , as she shook his hand off her , and went on down the street . A night or two before a new song from Gris - Gris , the best tenor in the whole army , would have been paradise to her , and she would have vaulted through the window at a single bound into the pandemonium . Now , she did not know why , she found no charm in it . And she went quietly home to her little straw - bed in her garret , and curled herself up like a kitten to sleep ; but for the first time in her young life sleep did not come readily to her , and when it did come , for the first time found a restless sigh upon her laughing mouth , as she murmured , dreaming : "
157180	157181	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" "
157195	157594	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" thought Cecil as , earlier awake than those of his Chambrée , he stood looking down the lengthy narrow room where the men lay asleep along the bare floor . Tired as over - worked cattle , and crouched or stretched like worn - out homeless dogs , they had never wakened as he had noiselessly harnessed himself , and he looked at them with that interest in other lives that had come to him through adversity ; for if misfortune had given him strength , it had also given him sympathy . They were of marvellously various types — those sleepers brought under one roof by fates the most diverse . Close beside a huge and sinewy brute of an Auvergnat , whose coarse bestial features and massive bull 's head were fitter for a galley - slave than a soldier , were the symmetrical limbs and the oval delicate face of a man from the Valley of the Rhône . Beneath a canopy of flapping tawny wild - beast skins , the spoils of his own hand , was flung the naked torso of one of the splendid peasants of the Sables d ' Olonne ; one steeped so long in blood and wine and alcohol , that he had forgotten the blue bright waves that broke on the western shores of his boyhood 's home , save when he muttered thirstily in his dreams of the cool sea , as he was muttering now . Next him , curled , dog - like , with its round black head meeting its feet , was a wiry frame on which every muscle was traced like network , and the skin burnt black as jet under twenty years of African sun . The midnight streets of Paris had seen its birth , the thieves ' quarter had been its nest ; it had no history , it had almost no humanity ; it was a perfect machine for slaughter , no more — who had ever tried to make it more ? Farther on lay , sleeping fitfully , a boy of scarcely more than seventeen , with rounded cheek and fair white limbs like a child 's , whose uncovered chest was delicate as a girl 's , and through whose long brown lashes tears in his slumber were stealing as his rosy mouth murmured , "
157602	158216	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" He was a young conscript taken from the glad vine - country of the Loire , and from the little dwelling up in the rock beside the sunny brimming river , and half - buried under its grape - leaves and coils , that was dearer to him than is the palace to its heir . There were many others beside these ; and Cecil looked at them with those weary speculative meditative fancies which , very alien to his temperament , stole on him occasionally in the privations and loneliness of his existence here — loneliness in the midst of numbers , the most painful of all solitude . Life was bearable enough to him in the activity of campaigning , in the excitement of warfare ; there were times even when it yielded him absolute enjoyment , and brought him interests more genuine and vivid than any he had known in his former world . But , in the monotony and the confinement of the barrack routine , his days were often intolerable to him . Morning after morning he rose to the same weary round of duty , the same series of petty irritations , of physical privations , of irksome repetitions , to take a toss of black rough coffee , and begin the day knowing it would bring with it endless annoyances without one gleam of hope . Rose to spend hours on the exercise - ground in the glare of a burning sun , railed at if a trooper 's accoutrement were awry , or an insubordinate scoundrel had pawned his regulation - shirt ; to be incessantly witness of tyrannies and cruelties he was powerless to prevent , and which he continually saw undo all he had done , and render men desperate whom he had spent months in endeavouring to make contented ; to have as the only diversions for his few instants of leisure loathsome pleasures that disgusted the senses they were meant to indulge , and that brought him to scenes of low debauchery from which all the old fastidious instincts of his delicate luxurious taste recoiled : with such a life as this he often wondered regretfully why , out of the many Arab swords that had crossed his own , none had gone straight to his heart ; why out of the many wounds that had kept him hovering on the confines of the grave , none had ever brought him the end and the oblivion of death . Had he been subject to all the miseries and personal hardships of his present career , but had only owned the power to command , to pardon , to lead , and to direct , as Alan Bertie before him had done with his Irregular Cavalry in the Indian plains , such a thought would never have crossed him ; he was far too thorough a soldier not then to have been not only satisfied , but happy . What made his life in the barracks of Algiers so bitter were the impotency , the subjection , the compelled obedience to a bidding that he knew often capricious and unjust as it was cruel , which were so unendurable to his natural pride , yet to which he had hitherto rendered undeviating adhesion and submission , less for his own sake than for that of the men around him , who , he knew , would back him in revolt to the death , and be dealt with , for such loyalty to him , in the fashion that the vivandière 's words had pictured with such terrible force and truth . "
158243	158366	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" he thought , as the brutalised companionship in which his life was spent struck on him all the more darkly because , the night before , a woman 's voice and a woman 's face had recalled memories buried for twelve long years . But , after so long a stand - up fight with fate , so long a victory over the temptation to let himself drift out in an opium - sleep from the world that had grown so dark to him , it was not in him to give under now . In his own way he had found a duty to do here , though he would have laughed at any one who should have used the word "
158368	158403	156847	156850	the master - fiddler	4254	" in connexion with him . In his own way , amidst these wild spirits , who would have been blown from the guns ' mouths to serve him , he had made good the "
158409	158776	158778	158778	you	4256	" of his House . And he was , moreover , by this time , a French soldier at heart and in habit , in almost all things , though the English gentleman was not dead in him under the harness of a Chasseur d ' Afrique . This morning he roused the men of his Chambrée with that kindly gentleness which had gone so far in its novelty to attach their liking ; went through the customary routine of his post with that exactitude and punctuality of which he was always careful to set the example ; made his breakfast off some wretched onion - soup and a roll of black bread ; rode fifty miles in the blazing heat of the African day at the head of a score of his chasses - marais on convoy duty , bringing in escort a long string of maize - waggons from the region of the Kabaila , which , without such guard , might have been swooped down on and borne off by some predatory tribe ; and returned , jaded , weary , parched with thirst , scorched through with heat , and covered with white dust , to be kept waiting in his saddle , by his Colonel 's orders , outside the barrack for three - quarters of an hour , whether to receive a command or a censure he was left in ignorance . When the three - quarters had passed , he was told M. le Commandant had gone long ago , and did not require him ! Cecil said nothing . Yet he reeled slightly as he threw himself out of saddle ; a nausea and a giddiness had come on him . To have passed nigh an hour motionless in his stirrups , with the skies like brass above him , whilst he was already worn with riding from sunrise well - nigh to sunset , with little to appease hunger and less to slake thirst , made him , despite himself , stagger dizzily under a certain sense of blindness and exhaustion as he dismounted . The Chasseur who had brought him the message caught his arm eagerly . "
158784	158940	158960	158960	I	0	" Cecil shook his head . The speaker was one known in the regiment as Petit Picpon , who had begun life as a gamin of Paris , and now bade fair to make one of the most brilliant of the soldiers of Africa . Petit Picpon had but one drawback to his military career — he was always in insubordination ; the old gamin dare - devilry was not dead in him , and never would die ; and Petit Picpon accordingly was perpetually a hero in the field and a ragamuffin in the times of peace . Of course he was always arrayed against authority , and now , being fond of his galonné with that curious dog - like deathless attachment that these natures , all reckless , wanton , destructive , and mischievous though they be , so commonly bestow , he muttered a terrible curse under his fiercely curled moustaches . "
158969	158976	158993	158993	you	6134	" Cecil turned rapidly on him . "
159001	159152	159161	159161	Corporal	4259	" It went to his heart to rebuke the poor fellow for an outburst of indignation which had its root in regard for himself , but he knew that to encourage it by so much even as by an expression of gratitude for the affection borne him would be to sow further and deeper the poison - seeds of that inclination to mutiny , and that rebellious hatred against their chief , already only planted too strongly in the squadrons under Châteauroy 's command . Petit Picpon looked as crestfallen as one of his fraternity could ; he knew well enough that what he had said could get him twenty blows of the matraque , if his Corporal chose to give him up to judgment ; but he had too much of the Parisian in him still not to have his say , though he should be shot for it . "
159163	159169	159181	159181	Diantre	841	" he said , sturdily ; "
159183	159236	159237	159237	I	0	" Cecil was infinitely more touched than he dared , for sake of discipline , for sake of the speaker himself , to show ; but his glance dwelt on Petit Picpon with a look that the quick , black , monkey - like eyes of the rebel were swift to read . "
159240	159246	160211	160211	Ma	853	" he said , gravely . "
159302	159365	159473	159473	Dam	852	" He led his horse away , and Petit Picpon went on on an errand he had been sent to do in the streets for one of the officers . Picpon was unusually thoughtful and sober in deportment for him , since he was usually given to making his progress along a road , taken unobserved by those in command over him , "
159369	159472	159475	159475	I	0	" with hands and heels in the dexterous somersaults of his early days . Now he went along without any unprofessional antics , biting the tip of a smoked - out cigar which he had picked up off the pavement in sheer instinct , retained from the old times when he had used to rush in , the foremost of la queue , into the forsaken theatres of Bouffes or of Variétés in search for those odds and ends which the departed audience might have left behind them;—one of the favourite modes of seeking a livelihood with the Parisian night - birds . "
159483	160078	160211	160211	Ma	853	" resolved Picpon , half aloud , valorously . Now Picpon had come forth on evil thoughts intent . His officer — a careless and extravagant man , the richest man in the regiment — had given him a rather small velvet bag , sealed , with directions to take it to a certain notorious beauty of Algiers , whose handsome Moresco eyes smiled — or at least he believed so — exclusively for the time on the sender . Picpon was very quick , intelligent , and much liked by his superiors , so that he was often employed on errands ; and the tricks he played in the execution thereof were so adroitly done that they were never detected . Picpon had chuckled to himself over this mission . It was but the work of an instant for the lithe nimble fingers of the ex - gamin to undo the bag without touching the seal , to see that it contained a hundred Napoléons with a note , to slip the gold into the folds of his ceinturon , to fill up the sack with date - stones to make it assume its original form so that none could have imagined it had been touched , and to proceed with it thus to the Moorish lionne 's dwelling . The negro who always opened her door would take it in ; Picpon would hint to him to be careful , as it contained some rare and rich sweetmeats ; negro nature , he well knew , would impel him to search for the bonbons ; and the bag , under his clumsy treatment , would bear plain marks of having been tampered with , and , as the African had a most thievish reputation , he would never be believed if he swore himself guiltless . Voilà ! here was a neat trick ! If it had a drawback , it was that it was too simple , too little risqué . A child might do it . Still — a hundred Naps . ! What fat geese , what flagons of brandy , what dozens of wine , what rich soups , what handsome moukieras , what tavern banquets they would bring ! Picpon had chuckled again as he arranged the little bag so carefully , with its date - stones , and pictured the rage of the beautiful Moor when she should discover the contents , and order the stick to her negro . Ah ! that was what Picpon called fun ! To appreciate the full force of such fun , it is necessary to have also appreciated the gamin . To understand the legitimate aspect such a theft bore , it is necessary to have also understood the unrecordable codes that govern the genus pratique , into which the genus gamin , when at maturity , develops . Picpon was quite in love with his joke ; it was only a good joke in his sight ; and , indeed , men need to live as hardly as an African soldier lives , to estimate the full temptation that gold can have when you have come to look on a cat as very good eating , and to have nothing to gnaw but a bit of old shoe - leather through the whole of the long hours of a burning day of fatigue - duty ; and to estimate , as well , the full width and depth of the renunciation that made him mutter now so valorously , "
160089	160210	160211	160211	Ma	853	" Picpon did not know himself as he said it . Yet he turned down into a lonely narrow lane , under marble walls , overtopped with fig and palm from some fine gardens , undid the bag for the second time , whisked out the date - stones and threw them over the wall , so that they should be out of his reach if he repented , put back the Napoléons , closed the little sack , ran as hard as he could scamper to his destination , delivered his charge into the fair lady 's own hands , and relieved his feelings by a score of somersaults alone the pavement as fast as ever he could go . "
160214	160256	160287	160290	that ci - devant	4262	" he thought , as he stood on his head , with his legs at an acute angle in the air , a position very favoured by him for moments of reflection — he said his brain worked better upside down . "
160299	160320	160287	160290	that ci - devant	4262	" Picpon ( then in his gamin stage ) had been enrolled in the Chasseurs at the same time with the "
160327	160357	160287	160290	that ci - devant	4262	" as they called Bertie , and , following his gamin nature , had exhausted all his resources of impudence , maliciousness , and power of tormenting , on the "
160360	160382	160287	160290	that ci - devant	4262	" somewhat disappointed , however , that the utmost ingenuities of his insolence and even his malignity never succeeded in breaking the "
160385	160657	160771	160771	Picpon	851	" silence and contemptuous forbearance from all reprisal . For the first two years the hell - on - earth which life with a Franco - Arab regiment seemed to Cecil , was a hundred - fold embittered by the brutalised jests and mosquito - like torments of this little odious chimpanzee of Paris . One day , however , it chanced that a detachment of Chasseurs , of which Cecil was one , was cut to pieces by such an overwhelming mass of Arabs , that scarce a dozen of them could force their way through the Bedouins with life ; he was amongst those few , and a flight at full speed was the sole chance of regaining their encampment . Just as he had shaken his bridle free of the Arabs ' clutch , and had mowed himself a clear path through their ranks , he caught sight of his young enemy , Picpon , on the ground , with a lance broken off in his ribs , guarding his head , with bleeding hands , as the horses trampled over him . To make a dash at the boy , though to linger a moment was to risk certain death , to send his steel through an Arab who came in his way , to lean down and catch hold of the lad 's sash , to swing him up into his saddle and throw him across it in front of him , and to charge afresh through the storm of musket - balls , and ride on thus burdened , was the work of ten seconds with "
160666	160770	160771	160771	Picpon	851	" And he brought the boy safe over a stretch of six leagues in a flight for life , though the imp no more deserved the compassion than a scorpion that has spent all its noxious day stinging at every point of uncovered flesh would merit tenderness from the hand it had poisoned . When he was swung down from the saddle and laid in front of a vidette fire , sheltered from the bitter north wind that was then blowing cruelly , the bright , black , ape - like eyes of the Parisian diablotin opened with a strange gleam in them : "
160775	161233	161242	161243	good father	4264	" he murmured . And Picpon had kept his word ; he had remembered often ; he remembered now , standing on his head and thinking of his hundred Napoléons surrendered because thieving and stealing in the regiment gave pain to that oddly prejudiced ci - devant . This was the sort of loyalty that the Franco - Arabs rendered ; this was the sort of influence that the English Guardsman exercised amongst his Roumis . Meantime , while Picpon made a human cone of himself , to the admiration of the polyglot crowd of the Algerine street , Cecil , having watered , fed , and littered down his tired horse , made his way to a little café he commonly frequented , and spent the few sous he could afford on an iced draught of lemon - flavoured drink . Eat he could not ; over - fatigue had given him a nausea for food , and the last hour , motionless in the intense glow of the afternoon sun , had brought that racking pain through his temples which assailed him rarely now , but which in his first years in Africa had given him many hours of agony . He could not stay in the café ; it was the hour of dinner for many , and the odours joined with the noise were insupportable to him . A few doors farther in the street , which was chiefly of Jewish and Moslem shops , there was a quaint place , kept by an old Moor , who had some of the rarest and most beautiful treasures of Algerian workmanship in his long , dark , silent chambers . With this old man Cecil had something of a friendship ; he had protected him one day from the mockery and outrage of some drunken Indigènes , and the Moor , warmly grateful , was ever ready to give him a cup of coffee and a hubble - bubble in the stillness of his dwelling . Its resort was sometimes welcome to him as the one spot , quiet and noiseless , to which he could escape out of the continuous turmoil of street and of barrack , and he went thither now . He found the old man sitting cross - legged behind his counter ; a noble - looking aged Mussulman , with a long beard like white silk , with cashmeres and broidered stuffs of peerless texture hanging above his head , and all around him things of silver , of gold , of ivory , of amber , of feathers , of bronze , of emeralds , of ruby , of beryl , whose rich colours glowed through the darkness . "
161245	161258	161270	161270	I	0	" said Cecil , in answer to the Moor 's hospitable entreaties . "
161275	161276	161282	161283	my son	4265	" "
161285	161290	161303	161303	Musjid	854	" said Ben Arsli . "
161311	161816	161303	161303	Musjid	854	" The supreme solace was a narghilé , and its great bowl of rose - water was soon set down by the little Moorish lad at Cecil 's side . Whether fatigue really weighted his eyes with slumber , or whether the soothing sedative of the pipe had its influence , he had not sat long in the perfect stillness of the Moor 's shop before the narrow view of the street under the awning without was lost to him , the lustre and confusion of shadowy hues swam awhile before his eyes , the throbbing pain in his temples grew duller , and he slept — the heavy , dreamless sleep of intense exhaustion . Ben Arsli glanced at him , and bade Musjid be very quiet . Half an hour or more passed ; none had entered the place . The grave old Moslem was half slumbering himself , when there came a delicate odour of perfumed laces , a delicate rustle of silk swept the floor ; a lady 's voice asked the price of an ostrich - egg , superbly mounted in gold . Ben Arsli opened his eyes — the Chasseur slept on : the new - comer was one of those great ladies who now and then winter in Algeria . Her carriage waited without : she was alone , making purchase of those innumerable splendid trifles with which Algiers is rife , while she drove through the town in the cooler hour before the sun sank into the western sea . The Moor rose instantly , with profound salaams , before her , and began to spread before her the richest treasures of his stock . Under plea of the light , he remained near the entrance with her ; money was dear too him , and must not be lost , but he would make it if he could without awakening the tired soldier . Marvellous caskets of mother - of - pearl ; carpets soft as down , with every brilliant hue melting one within another ; coffee equipages , of inimitable metal work ; silver statuettes , exquisitely chased and wrought ; feather - fans , and screens of every beauty of device , were spread before her , and many of them were bought by her with that unerring grace of taste and lavishness of expenditure which were her characteristics , but which are far from always found in unison ; and throughout her survey , Ben Arsli had kept her near the entrance , and Cecil had slept on unaroused by the low tones of their voices . A roll of notes had passed from her hand to the Moslem 's , and she was about to pass out to her carriage , when a lamp which hung at the farther end caught her fancy . It was very singular , a mingling of coloured glass , silver , gold , and ivory being wrought in with much beauty in its formation . "
161822	161871	161879	161879	He	4266	" she inquired . As he answered in the affirmative , she moved up the shop , and , her eyes being lifted to the lamp , had drawn close to Cecil before she saw him . When she did so , she paused near , in astonishment : "
161877	161878	161882	161882	Madame	815	" "
161884	161898	161924	161924	he	4266	" softly answered the old man , in his slow , studied French . "
161929	161930	162059	162059	He	4266	" "
161933	162058	162074	162074	Madame	815	" Her eyes fell on him with compassion ; he had fallen into an attitude of much grace , and of utter exhaustion ; his head was uncovered and rested on one arm , so that the face was turned upward . With a woman 's rapid comprehensive glance she saw the dark shadow like a bruise under his closed aching eyes , she saw the weary pain upon his forehead , she saw the whiteness of his hands , the slenderness of his wrists , the softness of his hair ; she saw , as she had seen before , that whatever he might be now , in some past time he had been a man of gentle blood , of courtly bearing . "
162065	162071	162079	162079	he	4266	" she asked the Moslem . "
162089	162109	162110	162110	He	4266	" She did not answer ; she stood with her thoughtful eyes gazing on the worn - out soldier . "
162130	162137	162200	162200	him	4266	" the old man went on . "
162193	162194	162211	162211	he	4266	" "
162222	162230	162237	162237	he	4266	" The Moor looked up in amazement . "
162255	162256	162261	162261	you	815	" "
162272	162273	162400	162400	Madame	8858	" "
162293	162399	162406	162406	I	0	" At that moment little Musjid let fall a valuable coffee - tray , inlaid with amber ; his master , with muttered apology , hastened to the scene of accident ; the noise startled Cecil , and his eyes unclosed to all the dreamy fantastic colours of the place , and met those bent on him in musing pity — saw that lustrous , haughty , delicate head bending slightly down through the many - coloured shadows . He thought he was dreaming , yet on instinct he rose , staggering slightly , for sharp pain was still darting through his head and temples . "
162409	162410	162418	162418	You	0	" "
162422	162472	162477	162477	I	0	" she said , gently ; and there was , for a moment , less of that accent in her voice which , the night before , had marked so distinctly , so pointedly , the line of demarcation between a Princess of Spain and a soldier of Africa . "
162481	162520	162534	162534	You	0	" He had no sense that he did , in the presence of that face which had the beauty of his old life ; under the charm of that voice which had the music of his buried years . "
162528	162533	162563	162563	Madame	8858	" she answered him . "
162552	162553	162563	162563	Madame	8858	" "
162565	162581	162588	162588	Your	0	" He was careful not again to forget the social gulf which yawned between them . "
162594	162607	162650	162650	he	0	" ' In Africa , Miladi , one can not expect indulgence . "
162608	162618	162650	162650	he	0	" I suppose not . You have served long ? "
162619	162625	162588	162588	Your	0	" Twelve years , Madame . "
162626	162631	162637	162637	She	8858	" And your name ? "
162632	162636	162690	162690	she	8858	" Louis Victor . "
162680	162689	162690	162690	she	8858	" I may be able to serve you , "
162697	162754	162769	162769	he	4277	" I will speak of you to the Marshal ; and when I return to Paris , I may have an opportunity to bring your name before the Emperor . He is as rapid as his uucle to reward military merit ; but he has not his uncle 's opportunities for personal observation of his soldiers . "
162761	162768	162769	162769	he	4277	" You do me much honour , "
162774	162794	162871	162871	she	4278	" but if you would gratify me , Madame , do not seek to do anything of the kind . "
162795	162807	162871	162871	she	4278	" And why ? Do you not even desire the cross ? "
162808	162818	162871	162871	she	4278	" I desire nothing , except to be forgotten . "
162819	162828	162857	162857	She	4278	" You seek what others dread , then ! "
162829	162856	162904	162905	the Moor	2628	" It may be so . At any rate , if you would serve me , Madame , never say what can bring me into notice . "
162909	162942	162954	162954	Cecil	628	" Miladi has told me , Monsieur Victor , that you are a first - rate carver of ivories . How is it you have never let me benefit by your art ? "
162943	162952	162971	162973	the grande dame	4283	" My things are not worth a sou , "
162958	162969	162971	162973	the grande dame	4283	" You do them great injustice , and yourself also , "
162982	162996	163011	163012	Ben Arsli—"why	857	" Your carvings are singularly perfect , and should bring you considerable returns . "
162997	163009	163029	163029	he	628	" Why have you never shown them to me at least ? "
163012	163020	163029	163029	he	628	Arsli—"why not have given me my option ? "
163034	163065	163113	163113	he	628	" I withheld them , Madame , not because he would have underpriced , but overpriced them . He rates a trifling act of mine of long ago so unduly . "
163108	163112	163113	163113	he	628	" Always so ! "
163116	163135	163147	163147	Cecil	628	" always so ! My son , in some life before this , was not generosity your ruin ? "
163136	163145	163147	163147	Cecil	628	" Miladi was about to purchase that lamp ? "
163153	163166	163192	163192	he	628	" Her Highness will not find anything like it in all Algiers . "
163180	163191	163278	163278	she	9066	" May I bear it to your carriage , Madame ? "
163271	163277	163278	163278	she	9066	" Wait , Monsieur Victor ! "
163290	163315	163278	163278	she	9066	" I accepted your chessmen last night , but you are very certain that it is impossible I can retain then on such terms . "
163322	163341	163319	163319	his	628	" Let your dogs break them , then , Madame . They shall not come back to me . "
163342	163388	163278	163278	she	9066	" You mistake , I did not mean that I would send them back . I simply desire to offer you some equivalent for them . There must be something that you wish for?—something which would be acceptable to you in the life you lead ? "
163389	163400	163319	163319	his	628	" I have already named the only thing I desire . "
163446	163478	163553	163553	his	628	" To be forgotten ? A sad wish ! Nay , surely life in a regiment of Africa can not be so cloudless that it can create in you no other ? "
163479	163488	163553	163553	his	628	" It is not . I have another . "
163489	163501	163319	163319	his	628	" Then tell it to me ; it shall be gratified . "
163502	163538	163588	163588	she	4292	" It is to enjoy a luxury long ago lost for ever . It is — to be allowed to give the slight courtesy of a gentleman without being tendered the wage of a servant . "
163572	163587	163588	163588	she	4292	" I had passed my word to grant it ; I can not retract , "
163596	163629	163553	163553	his	628	" I will press nothing more on you . But — as an obligation to me — can you find no way in which a rouleau of gold would benefit your men ? "
163630	163698	163705	163705	she	4292	" No way that I can take it for them . But , if you care indeed to do them a charity , a little wine , a little fruit , a few flowers ( for there are those among them who love flowers ) , sent to the hospital , will bring many benedictions on your name , Madame . They lie in infinite misery there ! "
163699	163704	163705	163705	she	4292	" I will remember , "
163720	163764	163791	163791	his	4296	" Adieu ! M. le Caporal ; and , if you should think better of your choice , and will allow your name to be mentioned by me to His Majesty , send me word through my people . There is my card . "
163799	163809	163791	163791	his	4296	" Mme . la Princesse Corona d ' Amägué . "
163815	163822	163826	163826	Algiers	245	" In the corner was written , "
163828	163843	163845	163845	you	4298	" He thrust it in the folds of his sash , and turned within . "
163849	163862	163947	163947	I	0	" he asked Ben Arsli . The old man shook his head . "
163936	163946	163933	163933	her	4299	" Cecil smiled and pressed the Moslem 's hand . "
163989	164304	164385	164386	That man	3064	" Yet they were stars of which he thought more , as he wended his way back to the barracks , than of the splendid constellations of the Algerian evening that shone with all the lustre of the day , but with a soft enchanted light which transfigured sea and earth and sky as never did the day 's full glow , as he returned to the mechanical duties , to the thankless services , to the distasteful meal , to the riotous mirth , to the coarse comradeship , which seemed to him to - night more bitter than they had ever done since his very identity , his very existence , had been killed and buried past recall , past rescurrection , under the képi d ' ordonnance of a Chasseur d ' Afrique . Meantime the Princesse Corona drove homeward — homeward to where a temporary home had been made by her in the most elegant of the many snow - white villas that stud the sides of the Sahel and face the bright bow of the sunlit bay ; a villa with balconies , and awnings , and cool silent chambers , and rich glowing gardens , and a broad low roof half hidden in bay and orange and myrtle and basilica , and the liquid sound of waters bubbling beneath a riotous luxuriance of blossom . Madame la Princesse passed from her carriage to her own morning - room , and sank down on a couch a little listless and weary with her search among the treasures of the Algerine bazaars . It was purposeless work , after all . Had she not bronzes , and porcelains , and bric - à - brac , and objets d ' art in profusion in her Roman villa , her Parisian hôtel , her great grim palace in the far Asturias ? "
164334	164384	164385	164386	That man	3064	" she thought , while her eyes dwelt on a chess - table near her — a table on which the mimic hosts of Chasseurs and Arabs were ranged in opposed squadrons . She took the White King in her hand and gazed at it with a certain interest . "
164392	164396	164385	164386	That man	3064	" she thought . "
164404	164472	164385	164386	That man	3064	" It touched her to great pity ; although proud with too intense a pride , her nature was exceedingly generous , and , when once moved , deeply compassionate . The unerring glance of a woman habituated to the first society of Europe had told her that the accent , the bearing , the tone , the features of this soldier , who only asked of life "
164475	164539	164385	164386	That man	3064	" were those of one originally of gentle blood ; and the dignity and patience of his acceptance of the indignities which his present rank entailed on him had not escaped her , any more than the delicate beauty of his face as she had seen it , weary , pale , and shadowed with pain , in the unconscious revelation of sleep . "
164547	164551	164738	164738	they	4311	" she mused . "
164582	164702	164738	164738	they	4311	" Then , with a certain impatient sense of some absurd discrepancy , of some unseemly occupation , in her thus dwelling on the wishes and the burdens of a sous - officier of Light Cavalry , she laughed a little and put the White Chief back once more in his place . Yet even as she set king amongst his mimic forces , the very carvings themselves seemed to retain their artist in her memory . There was about them an indescribable elegance , an exceeding grace and beauty , which spoke of a knowledge of art and of a refinement of taste far beyond those of a mere military amateur in the one who had produced them . "
164720	164724	164886	164886	they	4311	" she mused . "
164897	165021	164886	164886	they	4311	" She left the chess - table and went onward to the dressing and bath and bed - chambers , which opened in one suite from her boudoir , and resigned herself to the hands of her attendants for the dinner - toilette . The Moslem had said aright of her beauty ; and now , as her splendid hair was unloosened and gathered up afresh with a crescent - shaped comb of gold that was not brighter than the tresses themselves , the brilliant , haughty , thoughtful face was of a truth , as he had said , the fairest that had ever come from the Frankish shores to the hot African seaboard . Many beside the old Moslem had thought it "
165031	165346	164886	164886	they	4311	" and held one grave lustrous glance of the blue imperial eyes above aught else on earth . Many had loved her — all without return . Yet , although only twenty years had passed over her proud head , the Princess Corona d ' Amägué had been wedded and been widowed . Wedded , with no other sentiment than that of a certain pity and a certain honour for the man whose noble Spanish name she took . Widowed , by a death that was the seal of her marriage - sacrament , and left her his wife only in name and law . The marriage had left no chain upon her ; it had only made her mistress of wide wealth , of that villa on the Sicilian Sea , of that light spacious palace - dwelling in Paris that bore her name , of that vast majestic old castle throned on brown Estremaduran crage , and looking down on mighty woods of cork and chesnut , and flashing streams of falling water hurling through the gorges . The death had left no regret upon her ; it had only given her for a while a graver shadow over the brilliancy of her youth and of her beauty , and given her for always — or for so long , at least , as she so chose to use it — a plea for that indifference d to men 's worship of her which their sex called heartlessness , which her own sex thought an ultra - refined coquetry , and which was in real truth neither the one nor the other , but simply the negligence of a woman very difficult to touch , and , as it had seemed , impossible to charm . None knew quite aright the history of that marriage . Some were wo nt to whisper it "
165349	165371	165373	165373	they	4317	" and , when that whisper came round to her , her splendid lips would curl with as splendid a scorn . "
165385	165951	166023	166023	You	4322	" she would ask ; for she came of a great Line that thought few royal branches on equality with it ; and she cherished as things of strictest creed and fact the legends that gave to her race , with its amber hair and its eyes of sapphire blue , the blood of King Arthur in their veins . Of a surety it was not ambition that had allied her , on his death - bed , with Beltran Corona d ' Amägué ; but what it was the world could never tell precisely . The world would not have believed if it had heard the truth — the truth that it had been , in a different fashion , a gleam of something of that same compassion which now made her merciful to a private trooper of Africa which had wedded her to the dead Spanish Prince : compassion which , with many another rich and generous thing , lay beneath her coldness and her pride as the golden stamen lies folded within the white virginal chill cup of the lily . She had never felt a touch of even passing preference to any one out of the many who had sought her high - born beauty ; she was too proud to be easily moved to such selection , and she was far too habituated to homage to be wrought upon by it ever so slightly . She was of a noble , sun - lit , gracious nature ; she had been always happy , always obeyed , always caressed , always adored ; it had rendered her immeasurably contemptuous of flattery ; it had rendered her a little contemptuous of pain . She had never had aught to regret ; it was not possible that she could realise what regret was . Hence men called and found her very cold ; yet those of her own kin whom she loved knew that the heart of a summer rose was not warmer , nor sweeter , nor richer than hers . And first amongst these was her half - brother , twenty years her senior — at once her guardian and her slave — who thought her perfect , and would no more have crossed her will than he would have set his foot on her beautiful imperial head . Corona d ' Amägué had been his friend ; the only one for whom he had ever sought to break her unvarying indifference to her lovers , but for whom even he had pleaded vainly until one autumn season , when they had stayed together at a great archducal castle in South Austria . In one of the forest - glades , awaiting the fanfare of the hunt , she rejected , for the third time , the passionate supplication of the superb noble who ranked with the D'Ossuna and the Medina - Sidonia . He rode from her in great bitterness , in grief that no way moved her — she was importuned with these entreaties to weariness . An hour after , he was brought past her , wounded and senseless ; he had saved her brother from imminent death at his own cost , and the tusks of the mighty Styrian boar had plunged through and through his frame as they had met in the narrow woodland glade . "
165965	166022	166023	166023	You	4322	" said the one whose life had been rescued by this devotion to her ; and his lips shook a little under his golden beard as he spoke . She looked at him ; she loved him well , and no homage to herself could have moved her as this sacrifice for her brother had done . "
166029	166033	166101	166101	Philip	476	" she asked . "
166070	166100	166123	166124	His wife	6487	" She was silent several moments ; then she raised her face , a little paler than it had been , but with a passionless resolve set on it . "
166121	166122	166123	166124	His wife	6487	" "
166131	166132	166143	166143	him	4319	" "
166135	166141	166145	166145	I	0	" she said , briefly . "
166148	166149	166165	166165	He	4319	" "
166163	166164	166179	166179	him	4319	" "
166181	166590	166731	166731	You	4328	" He was told ; and was repaid . Such a light of unutterable joy burnt through the misty agony of his eyes as never , it seemed to those who saw , had beamed before in mortal eyes . He did not once hesitate at the acceptance of her self - surrender ; he only pleaded that the marriage ceremony should pass between them that night . There were notaries and many priests in the great ducal household ; all was done as he desired . She consented without wavering ; she had passed her word , she would not have withdrawn it if its redemption had been a thousand times more bitter . The honour of her house was dearer to her than any individual happiness . This man , for them , had lost peace , health , joy , strength , every hope of life ; to dedicate her own life to him , as he had vainly prayed her when in the full glow and vigour of his manhood , was the only means by which their vast debt to him could be paid . To thus pay it was the instant choice of her high code of honour , and of a generosity that would not be outrun . Moreover , she pitied him unspeakably , though her heart had no tenderness for him ; she had dismissed him with cold disdain , and he had gone from her to save the only creature that she loved , and was stretched a stricken , broken , helpless wreck , with endless years of pain and weariness before him ! So — at midnight , in the great dim magnificence of the state chamber where he lay , and with the low , soft chanting of the chapel choir from afar echoing through the incensed air , she bent her haughty head down over his couch , and the marriage benediction was spoken over them . His voice was faint and broken , but it had the thrill of a passionate triumph in it . When the last words were uttered , he lay awhile , exhausted , silent , only looking ever upward at her with his dark , dreamy eyes , in which the old love glanced so strangely through the blindness of pain . Then he smiled as the last echo of the choral melodies died softly on the silence . "
166740	166876	166731	166731	You	4328	" And before sunrise he died . Some shadow from that fatal and tragic midnight marriage rested on her still . Though she was blameless , some vague remorse ever haunted her ; though she had been so wholly guiltless of it , this death for her sake ever seemed in some sort of her bringing . Men thought her only colder , only prouder ; but they erred . She was one of those women who , beneath the courtly negligence of a chill manner , are capable of infinite tenderness , infinite nobility , and infinite self - reproach . A great French painter once , in Rome , looking on her from a distance , shaded his eyes with his hand as if her beauty , like the sun , dazzled him . "
166881	166906	166914	166914	Corona	858	" he muttered ; and he was a man whose own ideals were so matchless that living women rarely could ring out his praise . "
166916	166917	166914	166914	Corona	858	" "
166920	166926	166935	166935	she	4331	" cried a Roman sculptor . "
166938	166939	166935	166935	she	4331	" "
166944	166945	166935	166935	she	4331	" "
166951	166952	166935	166935	she	4331	" "
166957	167256	167258	167260	the Little One	4334	" Wherewith he turned into the Greco . He had found the one flaw — and it was still there . What he had missed in her , still was wanting . V'la ce que c'est la gloire — au grabat ! The contemptuous sentence was crushed through Cigarette 's tight - pressed bright - red lips with an irony sadder than tears . She was sitting on the edge of a grabat , hard as wood , comfortless as a truss of straw , and looking down the long hospital - room with its endless rows of beds and its hot sun shining blindingly on its glaring whitewashed walls . She was well known and well loved there . When her little brilliant - hued figure fluttered , like some scarlet bird of Africa , down the dreary length of those chambers of misery , bloodless lips close - clenched in torture would stir with a smile , would move with a word of welcome . No tender - voiced dove - eyed Sister of Orders of Mercy , gliding grey and soft , and like a living psalm of consolation , beside those couches of misery , bore with them the infinite inexpressible charm that the Friend of the Flag brought to the sufferers . The Sisters were good , were gentle , were valued as they merited by the greatest blackguard prostrate there ; but they never smiled , they never took the dying heart of a man back with one glance to the days of his childhood , they never gave a wild snatch of song , like a bird 's on a spring - blossoming bough , that thrilled through half - dead senses with a thousand voices from a thousand buried hours . "
167262	167288	167347	167347	you	4335	" as said a gaunt grey - bearded Zéphyr once , where he lay with the death - chill stealing slowly up his jagged , torn frame—"the
167350	167713	167347	167347	you	4335	" It was all the differnce — a wide difference ; she loved them all , with the warmth and fire of her young heart , for sake of France and of their common Flag . And though she was but a wild wayward mischievous gamin , a gamin all over though in a girl 's form , men would tell in camp and hospital , with great tears coursing down their brown scarred cheeks , how her touch would fall as softly as a snow - flake on their heated foreheads , how her watch would be kept by them through long nights of torment , how her gifts of golden trinkets would be sold or pawned as soon as received to buy them ice or wine , and how in their delirium the sweet fresh voice of the Child of the Regiment would soothe them , singing above their wretched beds some carol or chant of their own native province , which it always seemed that she must know by magic . For , were it Basque or Breton , were it a sea - lay of Vendée or a mountain - song of the Orientales , were it a mere ringing rhyme for the mules of Alsace , or a wild bold romanesque from the country of Berri , Cigarette knew each and all , and never erred by any chance , but ever sung to every soldier the rhythm familiar from his infancy , the melody of his mother 's cradle - song and of his first love 's lips . And there had been times when those songs suddenly breaking through the darkness of night , suddenly lulling the fiery anguish of wounds , had made the men who one hour before had been like mad dogs , like goaded tigers , men full of the lusts of slaughter and the lusts of the senses , and chained powerless and blaspheming to a bed of agony , tremble and shudder at themselves , and turn their faces to the wall and weep like children , and fall asleep , at lenght , with wondering dreams of God . "
167724	167858	167935	167935	My	0	" said Cigarette , now grinding her pretty teeth . She was in her most revolutionary and reckless mood , drumming the rataplan with her spurred heels , and sitting smoking on the corner of old Miou - Matou 's mattress . Miou - Matou , who had acquired that title among the joyeux for his scientific powers of making a tom - cat into a stew so divine that you could not tell it from rabbit , being laid up with a ball in his hip , a spear - head between his shoulders , a rib or so broken , and one or two other little trifling casualties . Miou - Matou , who looked very like an old grizzly bear , laughed in the depths of his great hairy chest . "
167894	167932	167935	167936	My God	4324	" And he described a circle with his lean brawny arm with as infinite a relish as a dilettante grown blind would listen thirstily to the description of an exquisite bit of Faïence or Della Quercia work . "
167943	168004	168017	168017	We	4342	" murmured a man on her right hand . He was not thirty years of age , with a delicate , dark , beautiful head that might have passed as model to a painter for a St. John . He was dying fast of the most terrible form of pulmonary maladies . Cigarette flashed her bright falcon glance over him . "
168015	168016	168027	168027	God	565	" "
168031	168043	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" murmured the man who lay dying of lung - disease . "
168346	168582	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" Her voice rang clear as a clarion ; the warm blood burnt in her bright cheeks ; the swift , fiery , pathetic eloquence of her nation moved her , and moved strangely the hearts of her hearers ; for though she could neither read nor write , there was in Cigarette the germ of that power which the world mistily calls Genius . There were men lying in that sick - chamber brutalised , crime - stained , ignorant as the bullocks of the plains , and , like them , reared and driven for the slaughter ; yet there was not one among them to whom some ray of light failed to come from those words , through whom some thrill failed to pass as they heard them . Out yonder in the free air , in the barrack - court , or on the plains , the Little One would rate them furiously , mock them mercilessly , rally them with the flat of a sabre if they were mutinous , and lash them with the most pitiless ironies if they were grumbling ; but here , in the hospital , the Little One loved them , and they knew it , and that love gave a flute - like music to the passion of her voice . Then she laughed , and drummed the rataplan again with her brass heel . "
168600	168625	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" she said , curtly . She was half impatient of her own momentary lapse into enthusiasm , and she knew the temper of her "
168627	168675	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" as accurately as a bugler knows the notes of the réveillé — knew that they loved to laugh even with the death - rattle in their throats , and , with their hearts half breaking over a comrade 's corpse , would cry in burlesque mirth , "
168689	168690	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" "
168693	168698	168597	168598	Père Matou	865	" growled Pèe Matou . "
168716	168717	168753	168755	The Silver Pheasants	867	" "
168736	168752	168821	168821	thou	4358	" cried Cigarette , with an immeasurable satire curling on her rosy , piquante lips . "
168815	168816	168821	168821	thou	4358	" "
168824	168838	168884	168885	The rich	4362	" growled Miou - Matou , peering up under his grey shaggy brows . "
168902	169110	169111	169114	An aristocrat in adversity	4363	" With which withering satire Cigarette left Père Matou in the conviction that he must be already dead and amongst the angels if people began to talk of champagne to him , and flitting down between the long rows of beds with the old disabled veterans who tended them , skimmed her way , like a bird as she was , into another great chamber , filled , like the first , with suffering in all stages and at all years , from the boy - conscript , tossing in African fever , to the white - haired campaigner of a hundred wounds . Cigarette was as caustic as a Voltaire this morning . Coming through the entrance of the hospital , she had casually heard that Madame la Princesse Corona d ' Amägué had made a gift of singular munificence and mercy to the invalid soldiers — a gift of wine , of fruit , of flowers , that would brighten their long dreary hours for many weeks . Who Madame la Princesse might be she knew nothing ; but the title was enough , she was a silver pheasant — bah ! And Cigarette hated the aristocrats — when they were of the sex feminine . "
169119	169124	169157	169157	Marquise	828	" she would say ; "
169134	169156	169157	169157	Marquise	828	" Which was the reason why she flouted glittering young nobles with all the insolence imaginable , but took the part of "
169159	169161	169157	169157	Marquise	828	" of "
169170	169362	169368	169368	I	0	" and of such wanderers like them , who had buried their sixteen quarterings under the black shield of the Enfans Perdus of Africa . 33 With a word here and a touch there — tender , soft , and bright , since , however ironic her mood , she never brought anything except sunshine to those who lay in such sore need of it , beholding the sun in the heavens only through the narrow chink of a hospital window ; — at last she reached the bed she came most specially to visit : a bed on which ws strectched the emaciated form of a man once beautiful as a Greek dream of a God . The dews of a great agony stood on his forehead ; his teeth were tight clenched on lips white and parched ; and his immense eyes , with the heavy circles round them , were fastened on vacancy with the yearning misery that gleams in the eyes of a Spanish bull when it is struck again and again by the matador , and yet can not die . She bent over him softly . "
169375	169666	169368	169368	I	0	" His weary eyes turned on her gratefully ; he sought to speak , but the effort brought the spasm on his lungs afresh ; it shook him with horrible violence from head to foot , and the foam on his auburn beard was red with blood . There was no one by to watch him ; he was sure to die ; a week sooner or later — what mattered it ? He was useless as a soldier ; good only to be thrown into a pit , with some quick - lime to hasten destruction and do the work of the slower earthworms . Cigarette said not a word , but she took out of some vine - leaves a cold hard lump of ice , and held it to him ; the delicious coolness and freshness in that parching noontide heat stilled the convulsion ; his eyes thanked her , though his lips could not ; he lay panting , exhausted , but relieved ; and she — thoughtfully for her — slid herself down on the floor and began singing , low and sweetly , as a fairy might sing on the raft of a water - lily leaf . She sang gaudrioles , to be sure , Béranger 's songs and odes of the camp ; for she knew of no hymn but the Marseillaise , and her chants were all chants like the Laus Veneris . But the voice that gave them was pure as the voice of a thrush in the spring , and the cadence of its music was so silvery - sweet that it soothed like a spell all the fever - racked brains , all the pain - tortured spirits . "
169673	169679	169368	169368	I	0	" murmured the dying man . "
169697	169874	169368	169368	I	0	" He was but half conscious ; but the lulling of that gliding voice brought him peace . And Cigarette sang on , only moving to reach him some fresh touch of ice , while time travelled fast , and the first afternoon shadows crept across the bare floor . Every now and then , dimly through the openings of the windows , came a distant roll of drums , a burst of military music , and echo of the laughter of a crowd : and then her head went up eagerly , an impatient shade swept across her expressive face . It was a fête - day in Algiers ; there were flags and banners fluttering from the houses , there were Arab races and Arab manoeuvres , there was a review of troops for some foreign general , there were all the mirth and the mischief that she loved , and that never went on without her , and she knew well enough that from mouth to mouth there was sure to be asking , "
169881	170083	169368	169368	I	0	" — Cigarette , who was the Generalissima of Africa ! But still she never moved ; though all her vivacious life was longing to be out and in their midst , on the back of a desert horse , on the head of a huge drum , perched on the iron support of a high - hung lantern , standing on a cannon while the Horse Artillery swept full gallop , firing down a volley of argot on the hot homage of a hundred lovers , drinking creamy liqueurs and filling her pockets with bonbons from handsome subalterns and aides - de - camp , doing as she had done ever since she could remember her first rataplan . But she never moved . She knew that in the general gala these sick - beds would be left more deserted and less soothed than ever . She knew , too , that it was for the sake of this man , lying dying here from the lunge of a Bedouin lance through his lungs , that the ivory wreaths and crosses and statuettes had been sold . And Cigarette had done more than this ere now many a time for her "
170086	170359	169368	169368	I	0	" The day stole on ; Léon Ramon lay very quiet ; the ice for his chest and the song for his ear gave him that semi - oblivion , dreamy and comparatively painless , which was the only mercy which could come to him . All the chamber was unusually still ; on three of the beds the sheet had been drawn over the face of the sleepers , who had sunk to a last sleep since the morning rose . The shadows lengthened , the hours followed one another ; Cigarette sang on to herself with few pauses : whenever she did so pause to lay soaked linen on the soldier 's hot forehead , or to tend him gently in those paroxysms that wrenched the clotted blood from off his lungs , there was a light on her face that did not come from the golden heat of the African sun . Such a light those who know well the Children of France may have seen , in battle or in insurrection , grow beautiful upon the young face of conscript or of boy - insurgent as he lifted a dying comrade , or pushed to the front to be slain in another 's stead ; the face that a moment before had been keen for the slaughter as the eyes of a kite , and recklessly gay as the saucy refrain the lips carolled . A step sounded on the bare boards ; she looked up , and the wounded man raised his weary lids with a gleam of gladness under them ; Cecil bent above his couch . "
170369	170464	170471	170471	I	0	" His voice was softened to infinite tenderness ; Léon Ramon had been for many a year his comrade and his friend ; an artist of Paris , a man of marvellous genius , of high idealic creeds , who , in a fatal moment of rash despair , had flung his talents , his broken fortunes , his pure and noble spirit , into the fiery furnace of the hell of military Africa ; and now lay dying here , a common soldier , forgotten as though he were already in his grave . "
170487	170491	170611	170611	God	565	" pursued Cecil . "
170519	170608	170611	170611	God	565	" He spoke with a hopefulness he could never feel , for he knew that the life of Léon Ramon was doomed ; and as the other strove to gain breath enough to answer him , he gently motioned him to silence , and placed on his bed some peaches bedded deep in moss and circled round with stephanotis , with magnolia , with roses , with other rarer flowers still . The face of the artist - soldier lightened with a longing joy ; his lips quivered . "
170621	170687	170702	170702	They	4366	" Cecil said nothing , but moved them nearer in to the clasp of his eager hands . Cigarette he did not see . There were some moments of silence , while the dark eyes of the dying man thirstily dwelt on the beauty of the flowers , and his dry ashen lips seemed to drink in their perfumes as those athirst drink in water . "
170692	170701	170711	170711	you	0	" he said , faintly , at length . "
170718	170719	170711	170711	you	0	" "
170727	170733	171022	171023	Ma belle	3221	" answered Cecil , hurriedly . "
170797	170798	171022	171023	Ma belle	3221	" "
170804	170825	170906	170912	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" murmured Léon Ramon , languidly ; life was too feeble in him to leave him vivid pleasure in aught . "
170854	170905	171022	171023	Ma belle	3221	" Cigarette , thus alluded to , sprang to her feet with her head tossed back , and all her cynicism back again ; a hot petulant colour was on her cheeks , the light had passed from her face , she struck her white teeth together . She had thought "
170913	171021	171063	171064	Good angel	4376	" chained to his regiment in the field of manoeuvre , or she would never have come thither to tend his friend . She had felt happy in her self - sacrifice ; she had grown into a gentle , pensive , merciful mood , singing here by the side of the dying soldier,—and now the first thing she heard was of the charities of Madame la Princesse ! That was all her reward ! Cigarette received the recompense that usually comes to generous natures which have strung themselves to some self - surrender that costs them dear ! Cecil looked at her surprised , and smiled . "
171060	171061	171102	171102	you	3221	" "
171126	171253	171254	171254	I	0	" She spoke with all her brusque petulance in arms again ; she hated that he should imagine she had sacrificed her fête - day to Léon Ramon , because the artist - trooper was dear to him ; she hated him to suppose that she had waited there all the hours through on the chance that he would find her at her post , and admire her for her charity . Cigarette was far too proud and disdainful a young soldier to seek either his presence or his praise . He smiled again ; he did not understand the caprices of her changeful moods , and he did not feel that interest in her which would have made him divine the threads of their vagaries . "
171266	171272	171280	171280	your	4384	" he said , gently . "
171288	171294	171312	171312	I	0	" Cigarette shrugged her shoulders . "
171320	171321	171330	171330	you	4384	" "
171341	171342	171345	171345	I	0	" "
171353	171361	171419	171419	she	4385	" said the Little One , contemptuously . "
171415	171416	171419	171419	she	4385	" "
171425	171430	171489	171489	Rosebuds	871	" murmured Léon Ramon . "
171487	171488	171489	171489	Rosebuds	871	" "
171491	171499	171563	171563	she	4387	" echoed Cigarette , with supreme scorn . "
171571	171577	171563	171563	she	4387	" Cecil looked up quickly : "
171581	171597	171563	171563	she	4387	" Cigarette flashed on him her brilliant brown eyes with a fire that amazed him . "
171606	171607	171563	171563	she	4387	" "
171612	171613	171772	171774	Madame la Princesse	815	" "
171702	171758	171841	171841	mine	0	" It was a superb peroration ! If the hapless flowers lying there had been a cartel of outrage to the concrete majesty of the French Army , the Army 's champion could not have spoken with more impassioned force and scorn . Cecil laughed slightly ; but he answered , with a certain annoyance : "
171843	171904	171949	171949	She	815	" In defending the generosity of what he knew to be a genuine and sincere wish to gratify his comrades , he betrayed what he did not intend to have revealed , namely , the conversation that had passed between himself and the Spanish Princess . Cigarette caught at the inference with the quickness of her lightning - like thought . "
171914	171948	171841	171841	mine	0	" There was a whole world of emphasis , scorn , meaning , wrath , comprehension , and irony in the four monosyllables ; the dying man looked at her with languid wonder . "
171960	171961	171841	171841	mine	0	" "
171964	172011	172081	172081	Miladi	839	" said Cecil , with the same inflection of annoyance in his voice ; to have his passing encounter with this beautiful patrician pass into a barrack canard , through the unsparing jests of the soldiery around him , was a prospect very unwelcome to him . "
172025	172026	172081	172081	Miladi	839	" "
172029	172042	172468	172468	Diantre	841	" interrupted Cigarette , before his phrase was one - third finished . "
172241	172467	172492	172492	Echaffaurées	873	" With which fiery and bitter enunciation of her views on the gifts of the Princess Corona d ' Amägué Cigarette struck light to her brâle - gueule , and thrusting it between her lips , with her hands in the folds of her scarlet waist - sash , went off with the light swift step natural to her , exaggerated into the carriage she had learned of the Zouaves , laughing her good - morrows noisily to this and that trooper as she passed their couches , and not dropping her voice even as she passed the place where the dead lay , but singing , as loud as she could , the most impudent drinking - song out of the taverns of the Spahis that ever celebrated wine , women , and war in the lawlessness of the lingua Sabir . Her wrath was hot , and her heart heavy within her . She had given up her whole fête - day to wait on the anguish and to soothe the solitude of his friend lying dying there ; and her reward had been to hear him speak of this aristocrat 's donations , that cost her nothing but the trouble of a few words of command to her household , as though they were the saintly charities of some angel from heaven ! "
172470	172491	172536	172536	I	0	" she muttered , as her hand wandered to the ever - beloved forms of the pistols within her sash . "
172541	172677	172678	172678	You	4413	" In that moment she could have shot him dead herself without a second 's thought . Storm and sunlight swept , one after another , with electrical rapidity at all times through her vivid changeful temper ; and here she had been wounded and been stung in the very hour in which she had subdued her national love of mirth , and her child - like passion for show , and her impatience of all confinement , and her hatred of all things mournful , to the attainment of this self - negation ! Moreover , there mingled with it the fierce and intolerant heat of the passionate and scarce - conscious jealousy of an utterly untamed nature , and of Gallic blood , quick and hot as the steaming springs of the Geyser . "
172685	172705	172710	172710	I	0	" said Léon Ramon , as she was lost to sight through the doors of the great desolate chamber , "
172716	172720	172773	172773	you	4413	" answered Cecil . "
172765	172770	173031	173031	you	0	" The other smiled . "
173037	173038	173031	173031	you	0	" "
173054	173055	173031	173031	you	0	" "
173062	173075	173177	173177	Her	4432	" said the artist - trooper , half wearily , half laughingly . "
173159	173160	173177	173177	Her	4432	" "
173175	173176	173274	173282	One little lioness here and there in a generation	4437	" "
173289	173587	173274	173282	One little lioness here and there in a generation	4437	" Cecil was silent . He would not cross the words of the wounded man by saying what might bring a train of less pleasant thoughts — saying what , in truth , was in his mind , that the future which he had meant for the little Friend of the Flag was not that of any glorious death by combat , but that of a life ( unless no bullet early cut its silver cord in twain ) when youth should have fled , and have carried for ever with it her numberless graces , and left in its stead that ribaldry - stained , drink - defiled , hardened , battered , joyless , cruel , terrible thing which is unsightly and repugnant to even the lowest amongst men , which is as the lees of the drunk wine , as the ashes of the burnt - out fires , as the discord of the broken and earth - clogged lyre . Cigarette was charming now — a fairy - story set into living motion — a fantastic little firework out of an extravaganza , with the impudence of a boy - harlequin and the witching kittenhood of a girl 's beauty . But when this youth that made it all fair should have passed ( and youth passes soon when thus adrift on the world ) , when there should be left in its stead only shamelessness , hardihood , vice , weariness — those who found the prettiest jest in her now would be the first to cast aside , with an oath , the charred wrecked rocket - stick of a life from which no golden careless stream of many - coloured fires of coquette capríces would rise and enchant them then . "
173595	173636	173656	173656	she	689	" asked Léon Ramon , later on , as his hands still wandered among the flowers : for the moment he was at peace ; the ice and the hours of quietude had calmed him . Cecil told him again . "
173644	173648	173659	173660	Madame Corona	815	" he pursued . "
173667	173668	173659	173660	Madame Corona	815	" "
173671	173679	173688	173688	Victor	804	" he said , with a smile , "
173690	173691	173694	173694	Pshaw	875	" "
173699	173700	173709	173711	this grande dame	4387	" "
173713	173714	173728	173728	Cigarette	689	" "
173717	173727	173933	173933	Cigarette	689	" said Cecil , with a sense of annoyance . "
173812	173932	173933	173933	Cigarette	689	" The keen ear of the sick man caught the inflection of an impatience , of a mortification , in the tone that the speaker himself was unconscious of . He guessed the truth — that Cecil had never felt more restless under the shadow of the Eagles than he had done when he had carried his lance up in the salute as he passed with his regiment the flagstaff where the aristocracy of Algiers had been gathered about the Marshal and his staff , and the azure eyes of Madame la Princesse had glanced carelessly and critically over the long line of grey horses of those Chasseurs d ' Afrique amongst whom he rode a bas - officier . "
173937	173947	173956	173956	You	4445	" said Ramon , with a slight smile again . "
173966	173967	173978	173980	a mere trooper	4447	" "
173982	173983	174038	174038	God!—they	876	" "
174043	174044	174038	174038	God!—they	876	" "
174053	174054	174123	174123	one	6278	" "
174131	174178	174375	174375	One	6278	" His great eyes gleamed like fire , his hollow chest panted for breath , the sweat stood out on his temples . Cecil sought to soothe him , but his words rushed on with the impetuous course of the passionate memories that arose in him . "
174385	174444	174448	174448	she	4466	" His eyes were still fastened on the blank white wall before him while he spoke , as though the things that his words sketched so faintly were painted in all their vivid colours on the dull blank surface . And so in truth they were , as remembrance pictured all the thousand perished hours of his youth . "
174453	174468	174852	174852	She	4466	" he pursued , while his voice flew in feverish haste over the words . "
174796	174851	175183	175183	she	4466	" His chest heaved with the spasms that with each throe seemed to tear his frame asunder ; still he conquered them , and his words went , on his eyes fastened on the burning white glare of the wall as though all the beauty of this woman glowed afresh there to his sight . "
175189	175318	175319	175319	You	4499	" Then , as the words ended , a great wave of blood beat back his breath and burst from the pent - up torture of his striving lungs , and stained red the dark and silken masses of his beard . His comrade had seen the hemorrhage many times , yet now he knew , as he had never known before , that this was death . As he held him upward in his arms , and shouted loud for help , the great luminous eyes of the French soldier looked up at him through their mist with the deep , fond gratitude that beams in the eyes of a dog as it drops down to die , knowing one touch and one voice to the last . "
175324	175348	176216	176216	She	4500	" he murmured , brokenly , while his voice ebbed faintly away as the stream of his life flowed faster and faster out . "
175367	176187	176216	176216	She	4500	" He stretched his arms outward as he spoke with the vain longing of a hopeless love . Then a deep sigh quivered through his lips ; his hand strove to close on the hand of his comrade , and his head fell , resting on the flushed blossoms of the rosebuds of Provence . He was dead . An hour later Cecil left the hospital , seeing and hearing nothing of the gay riot of the town about him , though the folds of many - coloured silk and bunting fluttered across the narrow Moorish streets , and the whole of the populace was swarming through them with the vivacious enjoyment of Paris mingling with the stately picturesque life of Arab habit and custom . He was well used to pain of every sort ; his bread had long been the bread of bitterness , and the waters of his draught been of gall . Yet this stroke , though looked for , fell heavily and cut far . Yonder , in the dead - room , there lay a broken , useless mass of flesh and bone that in the sight of the Bureau Arabe was only a worn - out machine that had paid its due toll to the wars of the Second Empire , and was now valueless ; only fit to be cast in to rot , unmourned , in the devouring African soil . But to him that lifeless , useless mass was dear still ; was the wreck of the bravest , tenderest , and best - beloved friend that he had found in his adversity . In Léon Ramon he had found a man whom he had loved , and who had loved him . They had suffered much , and much endured together ; their very dissimilarities had seemed to draw them nearer to each other . The gentle impassiveness of the Englishman had been like rest to the ardent impetuosity of the French soldier ; the passionate and poetic temperament of the artist - trooper had revealed to Cecil a thousand views of thought and of feeling which had never before then dawned on him . And now that the one lay dead , a heavy , weary sense of loneliness rested on the other . They died around him every day ; the fearless , fiery blood of France watered in ceaseless streams the arid , harvestless fields of northern Africa ; death was so common , that the fall of a comrade was no more noted by them than the fall of a loose stone that their horse 's foot shook down a precipice . Yet this death was very bitter to him ; he wondered with a dull sense of aching impatience why no Bedouin bullet , no Arab sabre , had ever found his own life out , and cut his thralls asunder . The evening had just followed on the glow of the day — evening , more lustrous even than ever , for the houses were all a - glitter with endless lines of coloured lamps and strings of sparkling illuminations , a very sea of bright - hued fire . The noise , the mirth , the sudden swell of music , the pleasure - seeking crowds , all that were about him , served only to make more desolate and more oppressive by their contrast his memories of that life , once gracious , and gifted , and content with the dower of its youth , ruined by a woman , and now slaughtered here , for no avail and with no honour , by a lance - thrust in a midnight skirmish , which had been unrecorded even in the few lines of the gazette that chronicled the war - news of Algeria . Passing one of the cafés , a favourite resort of the officers of his own regiment , he saw Cigarette . A sheaf of blue , and white , and scarlet lights flashed with tongues of golden flame over her head , and a great tricolour flag with the brass eagle above it was hanging in the still , hot air from the balcony from which she leaned . Her tunic - skirt was full of bonbons and of crackers that she was flinging down among the crowd whilst she sang , stopping every now and then to exchange some passage of gaulois wit with them that made her hearers scream with laughter , whilst behind her was a throng of young officers drinking champagne , eating ices , and smoking , echoing her songs and her satires with enthusiastic voices and stamps of their spurred boot - heels . As he glanced upward , she looked literally in a blaze of luminance , and the wild , mellow tones of her voice ringing out in the "
176195	176215	176216	176216	She	4500	" sounded like a mockery of that dying - bed beside which they had both so late stood together . "
176229	176325	176216	176216	She	4500	" he thought ; with a sense of disgust , forgetting that she did not know what he knew , and that if Cigarette had waited to laugh until death had passed by she would have never laughed all her life through in the battalions of Africa . She saw him , as he went beneath her balcony ; and she sung all the louder , she flung her sweetmeat missiles with the reckless force of a Roman Carnivalist , she launched bolts of tenfold more audacious raillery at the delighted mob below . Cigarette was "
176329	176554	176216	176216	She	4500	" when she was wounded , she wound her scarf round the nerve that ached , and only laughed the gayer . And he did her that injustice which the best amongst us are apt to do to those whom we do not feel interest enough in to study with that closeness which can alone give comprehension of the intricate and complex rebus , so faintly sketched , so marvellously involved , of human nature . He thought her a little leopard , in her vivacious play and her inborn bloodthirstiness . Well , the little leopard of France played recklessly enough that evening . Algiers was en fête , and Cigarette was sparkling over the whole of the town like a humming - bird or a firefly — here , and there , and everywhere , in a thousand places at once , as it seemed ; staying long with none , making music and mirth with all . Waltzing like a thing possessed , pelting her lovers with a tempest storm of dragées , standing on the head of a gigantic Spahis en tableau amidst a shower of fireworks , improvising slang songs worthy of Jean Vadé and his Poissardes , and chorused by a hundred lusty lungs that yelled the burden in riotous glee as furiously as they were accustomed to shout "
176558	176867	177248	177248	Bouffarick	879	" in assault and in charge , Cigarette made amends to herself at night for her vain self - sacrifice of the fête - day . She had her wound ; yes , it throbbed still now and then , and stung like a bee in the warm core of a rose . But she was young , she was gay , she was a little philosopher , above all she was French , and in the real French blood happiness runs so richly that it will hardly be utterly chilled until the veins freeze in the coldness of death . She enjoyed — enjoyed all the more fiercely , perhaps , because a certain desperate bitterness mingled with the abandonment of her Queen Mab - like revelries . Until now Cigarette had been as absolutely heedless and without a care as any young bird taking its first summer circles downward through the intoxication of the sunny air . It was not without fiery resistance and scornful revolt that the madcap Figlia del Reggimento would be prevailed on to admit that any shadow could have power to rest on her . She played through more than half the night , the agile bounding graceful play of the young leopard to which he had likened her , and with a quick punishment from her velvet - sheathed talons if any durst offend her . Then when the dawn was nigh , leopard - like , the Little One sought her den . She was most commonly under canvas ; but when she was in the town it was at one with the proud independence of her nature that she rejected all offers made her , and would have her own nook to live in , even though she were not there one hour out of the twenty - four . "
176872	176963	177091	177091	I	0	" was a standing jest of the Army ; for none was ever allowed to follow her thither , or to behold the interior of her fortress , and one over - venturous Spahi scaling the ramparts had been rewarded with so hot a deluge of lentiles - soup from a boiling casserole poured on his head from above , that he had beaten a hasty and ignominious retreat , which was more than a whole tribe of the most warlike of his countrymen could ever have made him do . "
176968	177090	177091	177091	I	0	" was neither more nor less than a couple of garrets , high in the air , in an old Moorish house , in an old Moorish court , decayed , silent , poverty - struck , with the wild pumpkin thrusting its leaves through the broken fretwork , and the green lizard shooting over the broad pavements , once brilliant in mosaic , that the robes of the princes of Islam had swept , now carpeted deep with the dry white drifted dust , and only crossed by the tottering feet of aged Jews or the laden steps of Algerine women . Up a long winding rickety stair Cigarette approached her castle , which was very near the sky indeed . "
177096	177103	177091	177091	I	0	" said the châtelaine , laconically , "
177113	177244	177248	177248	Bouffarick	879	" And through it , too , she might have added , for though no human thing might invade her Château , the pigeons circling in the sunrise light always knew well there were rice and crumbs spread for them in that eyelet - hole of a casement . Cigarette threaded her agile way up the dark ladder - like shaft , and opened her door . There was a dim oil - wick burning ; the garret was large , and as clean as a palace could be ; its occupants were various , and all sound asleep except one , who , rough , and hard , and small , and three - legged , limped up to her and rubbed a little bullet head against her lovingly . "
177250	177398	177091	177091	I	0	" returned Cigarette , caressingly , in a whisper ; and Bouffarick , content , limped back to a nest of hay , being a little wiry dog that had lost a leg in one of the most famous battles of Oran , and lain in its dead master 's breast through three days and nights on the field . Cigarette , shading the lamp with one hand , glanced round on her family . They had all histories — histories in the French Army , which was the only history she considered of any import to the universe . There was a raven perched high , by name Vole - qui - Veut : he was a noted character amongst the Zouaves , and had made many a campaign riding on his owner 's bayonet ; he loved a combat , and was specially famed for screaming "
177405	177630	177640	177641	my friend	4375	" all over a battle - field ; he was very grey now , and the Zouave 's bones had long bleached on the edge of the desert . There was a tame rat who was a vieille moustache , and who had lived many years in a Lignard 's pocket , and munched waifs and strays of the military rations , until the enormous crime being discovered that it was taught to sit up and dress its whiskers to the heinous air of the Marseillaise , the Lignard got the matraque , and the rat was condemned to be killed , had not Cigarette dashed in to the rescue and carried the long - tailed revolutionist off in safety . There was a big white cat curled in a ball , who had been the darling of a Tringlo , and had travelled all over North Africa on the top of his mule 's back , seven seasons through ; in the eighth the Tringlo was picked off by a flying shot , and an Indigène was about to skin the shrieking Boule Blanche for the soup - pot , when a bullet broke his wrist , making him drop the cat with a yell of pain , and the Friend of the Flag , catching it up , laughed in his face : "
177643	177970	177971	177971	I	0	" There was little Bouffarick and three other brother - dogs of equal celebrity , one , in especial , who had been brought from Châlons , in defiance of the regulations , inside the drum of his regiment , and had been wounded a dozen times , always seeking the hottest heat of the skirmish . And there was , besides these , sleeping serenely on a straw palliasse , a very old man with a snowy beard and a head fit for Gerome to give to an Abraham . A very old man — one who had been a conscript in the bands of Young France , and marched from his Pyrennean village to the battle tramp of the Marseillaise , and charged with the Enfans de Paris across the plains of Gemappes ; who had known the passage of the Alps , and lifted the long curls from the dead brow of Désaix at Marengo , and seen in the sultry noonday dust of a glorious summer the Guard march into Paris , while the people laughed and wept with joy , surging like the mighty sea around one pale frail form , so young by years , so absolute by genius . A very old man ; long broken with poverty , with pain , with bereavement , with extreme old age ; and , by a long course of cruel accidents , alone , here in Africa , without one left of the friends of his youth , or of the children of his name , and deprived even of the charities due from his country to his services — alone save for the little Friend of the Flag , who , for four years , had kept him on the proceeds of her wine trade in this Moorish attic , tending him herself when in the town , taking heed that he should want for nothing when she was campaigning . "
177979	178114	178952	178952	Victor	804	" she had said , curtly , when she had found him in great misery and learned his history from others ; and she had had the care accordingly , maintaining him at her own cost in the Moorish building , and paying a good Jewess of the quarter to tend him when she was not herself in Algiers . The old man was almost dead , mentally , though in bodily strength still well able to know the physical comforts of food , and rest , and attendance ; he was in his second childhood , in his ninetieth year , and was unconscious of the debt he owed her ; even , with a curious caprice of decrepitude , he disliked her , and noticed nothing except the raven when it shrieked its "
178121	178951	178956	178957	Mon Commandant	886	" But to Cigarette he was as sacred as a god ; had he not fought beneath the glance , and gazed upon the face , of the First Consul ? She bent over him now , saw that he slept , busied herself noiselessly in brewing a little tin pot full of coffee and hot milk , set it over the lamp to keep it warm , and placed it beside him ready for his morning meal , with a roll of white wheat bread ; then , with a glance round to see that her other dependents wanted for nothing , went to her own garret adjoining , and with the lattice fastened back , that the first rays of sunrise and the first white flash of her friends the pigeons ' gleaming wings might awaken her , threw herself on her straw and slept with all the graceful careless rest of the childhood which though in one sense she had never known , yet in another had never forsaken her . She hid as her lawless courage would not have stooped to hide a sin , had she chosen to commit one , this compassion which she , the young condottiera of Algeria , showed with so tender a charity to the soldier of Bonaparte . To him , moreover , her fiery imperious voice was gentle as the dove , her wayward dominant will was pliant as the reed , her contemptuous sceptic spirit was reverent as a child 's before an altar . In her sight the survivor of the Army of Italy was sacred ; sacred the eyes which , when full of light , had seen the sun glitter on the squadrons of the Hussars of Murat , the Dragoons of Kellerman , the Cuirassiers of Milhaud ; sacred the hands which when nervous with youth , had borne the standard of the Republic victorious against the gathered Teuton host in the Thermopylæ of Champagne ; sacred the ears which , when quick to hear , had heard the thunder of Arcola , of Lodi , of Rivoli , and above even the tempest of war , the clear still voice of Napoléon ; sacred the lips which , when their beard was dark in the fulness of manhood , had quivered , as with a woman 's weeping , at the farewell , in the spring night , in the moonlit Cour des Adieux . Cigarette had a religion of her own ; and followed it more closely than most disciples follow other creeds . Early that morning , when the snowy cloud of pigeons were circling down to take their daily alms from Cigarette , where her bright brown face looked out from the lattice - hole , Cecil , with some of the roughriders of his regiment , was sent far into the interior to bring in a string of colts , bought of a friendly desert tribe , and destined to be shipped to France for the Imperial Haras . The mission took two days ; early on the third they returned with the string of wild young horses , whom it had taken not a little exertion and address to conduct successfully through the country into Algiers . He was usually kept in incessant activity , because those in command over him had quickly discovered the immeasurable value of a bas - officier who was certain to enforce and obtain implicit obedience , and certain to execute any command given him with perfect address and surety , yet who , at the same time , was adored by his men , and had acquired a most singularly advantageous influence over them . But of this he was always glad : throughout his twelve years ' service under the Emperor 's flag , he had only found those moments in which he was unemployed intolerable ; he would willingly have been in saddle from dawn till midnight . Châteauroy was himself present when the colts were taken into the stable - yard ; and himself inquired , without the medium of any third person , the whole details of the sale and of the transit . It was impossible , with all his inclination , to find any fault either with the execution of the errand or with the brief respectful answers by which his Corporal replied to his rapid and imperious cross - questionings . There were a great number of men within hearing , many of them the most daring and rebellious pratiques of the regiment ; and Cecil would have let the coarsest up - braidings scourge him , rather than put the temptation to mutiny in their way which one insubordinate or even not strictly deferential word from him would have given . Hence the inspection passed off peaceably ; as the Marquis turned on his heel , however , he paused a moment . "
178954	178955	178956	178957	Mon Commandant	886	" "
178959	178960	179047	179047	sir	6134	" "
179049	179292	179469	179475	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" Cecil put out his hand ; he expected to receive a heavy blow from his commander 's sabre , that possibly might break the wrist . These little trifles were common in Africa . Instead , a rouleau of Napoléons was laid on his open palm . Châteauroy knew the gold would sting more than the blow . For the moment Cecil had but one impulse — to dash the pieces in the giver 's face . In time to restrain the impulse , he caught sight of the wild eager hatred gleaming in the eyes of Rake , of Petit Picpon , of a score of others who loved him and cursed their Colonel , and would at one signal from him have sheathed their sword in the mighty frame of the Marquis , though they should have been fired down the next moment themselves for the murder . The warning of Cigarette came to his memory ; his hand clasped on the gold ; he gave the salute calmly as Châteauroy swung himself away . The troopers looked at him with longing questioning eyes ; they knew enough of him by now to know the bitterness such gold , so given , had for him . Any other , even a corporal , would have been challenged with a storm of raillery , a volley of congratulation , and would have had shouted or hissed after him opprobrious accusations of "
179295	179468	179469	179475	Bel - à - faire - peur	544	" if he had not forthwith treated his comrades royally from such largesse . With Bel - à - faire - peur they held their peace ; they kept the silence which they saw that he wished to keep , as , his hour of liberty being come , he went slowly out of the great court with the handful of Napoléons thrust in the folds of his sash . Rather unconsciously than by premeditation his steps turned through the streets that led to his old familiar haunt , the As de Pique , and dropping down on a bench under the awning , he asked for a draught of water . It was brought him at once , the hostess , a quick brown little woman from Paris , whom the lovers of Eugène Sue called Rigolette , adding of her own accord a lump of ice and a slice or two of lemon , for which she vivaciously refused payment , though generosity was by no means her cardinal virtue . "
179476	180109	180926	180927	mon brave	3223	" awakened general interest through Algiers ; he brought so fiery and so daring a reputation with him from the wars and raids of the interior , yet he was so calm , so grave , so gentle , so listless ; it was known that he had made himself the terror of Kabyle and Bedouin , yet here in the city he thanked the negro boy who took him a glass of lemonade at an estaminet , and sharply rebuked one of his men for knocking down an old colon with a burden of gourds and of melons ; such a Roumi as this the good people of the Franco - African capital held as a perfect gift of the gods , and not understanding one whit , nevertheless fully appreciated . He did not look at the newspapers she offered him ; but sat gazing out from the tawny awning , like the sail of a Neapolitan felucca , down the chequered shadows and the many - coloured masses of the little crooked , rembling , semi - barbaric alley . He was thinking of the Napoléons in his sash and of the promise he had pledged to Cigarette . That he would keep it he was resolved . The few impressive vivid words of the young vivandière had painted before him like a picture the horrors of mutiny and its hopelessness ; rather than that , through him , these should befall the men who had become his brethren - in - arms , he felt ready to let the Black Hawk do his worst on his own life . Yet a weariness , a bitterness , he had never known in the excitement of active service came on him , brought by this sting of insult from the fair hand of an aristocrate . There was absolutely no hope possible in his future . The uttermost that could ever come to him would be a grade something higher in the army that now enrolled him ; the gift of the cross , or a post in the bureau . Algerine warfare was not like the campaigns of the armies of Italy or the Rhine , and there was no Napoléon here to discern with unerring omniscience a leader 's genius under the képi of a common trooper . Though he should show the qualities of a Massena or a Kléber , the chances were a million to one that he would never get even so much as a lieutenancy ; and the raids on the decimated tribes , the obscure skirmishes of the interior , though terrible in slaughter and venturesome enough , were not the fields on which great military successes were won and great military honours acquired . The French fought for a barren strip of brown plateau that , gained , would be of little use or profit to them ; he thought that he did much the same , that his future was much like those arid sand - plains , those thirsty verdureless stretches of burnt earth — very little worth the reaching . The heavy folds of a Bedouin 's haick brushing the papers off the bench , broke the thread of his musings . As he stooped for them , he saw that one was an English journal some weeks old . His own name caught his eye — the named buried so utterly , whose utterance in the Sheik 's tent had struck him like a dagger 's thrust . The flickering light and darkness , as the awning waved to and fro , made the lines move dizzily upwards and downwards as he read — read the short paragraph touching the fortunes of the race that had disowned him : "
180245	180918	180929	180931	Bois de m'avoine	126	" Cecil sat quite still , as he had looking down on the record of his father 's death , when Cigarette had rellied him with her gay challenge among the Moresco ruins . His face flushed hotly under the warm golden hue of the desert bronze , then lost all its colour as suddenly , till it was as pale as any of the ivory he carved . The letteres of the paper reeled and wavered and grew misty before his eyes ; he lost all sense of the noisy changing polyglot crowd thronging past him ; he , a common soldier in the Algerian Cavalry , knew that , by every law of birthright , he was now a Peer of England . His first thought was for the dead man . True , there had been little amity , little intimacy , between them ; a negligent friendliness whenever they had met had been all that they had ever reached . But in their childhood they had been carelessly kind to one another , and the memory of the boy who had once played beside him down the old galleries and under the old forests , of the man who had now died yonder where the southern seaboard lay across the warm blue Mediterranean , was alone on him for the moment . His thoughts had gone back , with a pang , almost ere he had read the opening lines , to autumn mornings in his youngest years when the leaves had been flushed with their earliest red , and the brown still pools had been alive with water - birds , and the dogs had dropped down charging among the flags and rushes , and his brother 's boyish face had laughed on him from the wilderness of willows , and his brother 's boyish hands had taught him to handle his first cartridge , and to fire his first shot . The many years of indifference and estrangement were forgotten , the few years of childhood 's confidence and comradeship alone remembered , as he saw the words that brought him in his exile the story of his brethren 's fate and of his race 's fortunes . His head sank , his face was still colourless , he sat motionless with the printed sheet in his hand . Once his eyes flashed , his breath came fast and uneven ; he rose with a sudden impulse , with a proud bold instinct of birth and freedom . Let him stand here in what grade he would , with the badge of a Corporal of the Army of Africa on his arm , this inheritance that had come to him was his ; he bore the name and the title of his house as surely as any had ever borne it since the first of the Norman owners of Royallieu had followed the Bastard 's banner . The vagabond throngs , Moorish , Frank , negro , colon , paused as they pushed their way over the uneven road , and stared at him vacantly where he stood . There was something in his attitude , in his look , which swept over them seeing none of them , in the eager lifting of his head , in the excited fire in his eyes , that arrested all , from the dullest muleteer plodding on with his string of patient beasts , to the most volatile French girl laughing on her way with a group of fantassins . He did not note them , hear them , think of them ; the whole of the Algerine scene had faded out as if it had no place before him ; he had forgot that he was a cavalry soldier of the Empire ; he saw nothing but the green wealth of the old home woods far away in England ; he remembered nothing save that he , and he alone , was the rightful Lord of Royallieu . "
180942	181685	180929	180931	Bois de m'avoine	126	" The coarse good - humoured challenge , as the hand of a broad - chested black - visaged veteran of Chasseurs fell on his shoulder , and the wooden rim of a little wine - cup was thrust towards him with the proffered drink , startled him and recalled him to the consciousness of where he was . He stared one moment absently in the trooper 's amazed face , then shook him off with a suddenness that tossed back the cup to the ground , and , holding the journal clenched close in his grasp , went swiftly through the masses of the people out and away , he little noted where , till he had forced his road beyond the gates , beyond the town , beyond all reach of its dust and its babble and its discord , and was alone in the further outskirts , where to the north the calm sunlit bay slept peacefully with a few scattered ships riding at anchor , and southward the luxuriance of the Sahel stretched to meet the wide and cheerless plateaux , dotted with the conical houses of hair , and desolate as though the locust - swarm had just alighted there to lay them waste . Reaching the heights he stood still involuntarily , and looked down once more on the words that told him of his birthright ; in the blinding intense light of the African day they seemed to stand out as though carved in stone , and as he read them once more a great darkness passed over his face;—this heritage was his , and he could never take it up ; this thing had come to him , and he must never claim it . He was Viscount Royallieu as surely as any of his fathers had been so before him , and he was dead for ever in the world 's belief ; he must live , and grow old , and perish by shot or steel , by sickness or by age , with his name and his rights buried , and his years passed as a private soldier of France . The momentary glow which had come to him with the sudden resurrection of hope and of pride faded utterly as he slowly read and re - read the lines of the journal on the broken terraces of the hill - side , where the great fig - trees spread their fantastic shadows , and through a rocky channel a russet stream of shallow waters threaded its downward path under the reeds , and no living thing was near him save some quiet browsing herds far off , and their Arab shepherd - lad that an artist might have sketched as Ishmael . What his future might have been rose before his thoughts ; what it must be rose also , bitterly , blackly , drearily in contrast . A noble without even a name ; a chief of his race without even the power to claim kinship with that race ; owner by law of three thousand broad English acres , yet an exile without freedom to set foot on his native land ; by heritage one amongst the aristocracy of England , by circumstance , now and for ever , till an Arab bullet should cut in twain his thread of life , a soldier of the African legions , bound to obey the commonest and coarsest boor that had risen to a rank above him : this was what he knew himself to be , and knew that he must continue to be without one appeal against it , without once stretching out his hand towards his right of birth and station . There was a passionate revolt , a bitter heart - sickness on him ; all the old freedom and peace and luxury and pleasure of the life he had left so long allured him with a terrible temptation ; the honours of the rank that he should now have filled were not what he remembered ; what he longed for with an agonised desire was to stand once more stainless among his equals , to reach once more the liberty of unchallenged unfettered life , to return once more to those who held him but as a dishonoured memory , as one whom violent death had well snatched from the shame of a criminal career . "
181693	181697	181747	181747	I	0	" he thought . "
181754	182198	181747	181747	I	0	" Yet though it was true to the very core that no envy and no evil lay in his heart against the younger brother to whose lot had fallen all good gifts of men and fate , there was almost unbearable anguish on him in this hour in which he learned the inheritance that had come to him , and remembered that he could never take again even so much of it as lay in the name of his fathers . When he had given his memory up to slander and oblivion and the shadow of a great shame , when he had let his life die out from the world that had known him , and buried it beneath the rough , weather - stained , blood - soaked cloth of a private soldier 's uniform , he had not counted the cost then nor foreseen the cost hereafter . It had fallen on him very heavily now . Where he stood under some sheltered columns of a long - ruined mosque whose shafts were bound together by a thousand withes and wreaths of the rich fantastic Sahel foliage , an exceeding weariness of longing was upon him — longing for all that he had forfeited , for all that was his own , yet never could be claimed as his . The day was intensely still ; there was not a sound except when here and there the movement of a lizard under the dry grasses gave a low crackling rustle . He wondered almost which was the dream and which the truth ; that old life that he had once led , and that looked now so far away and so unreal , or this which had been about him for so many years in the camps and the bivouacs , the barracks and the battlefields . He wondered almost which he himself was — an English Peer on whom the title of his line had fallen , or a Corporal of Chasseurs who must take his chief 's insults as patiently as a cur takes the blows of its master ; that he was both , seemed to him , as he stood there with the glisten of the sea before and the swelling slopes of the hill - side above , a vague distorted nightmare . Hours might have passed , or only moments , he could not have told ; his eyes looked blankly out at the sun - glow , his hand instinctively clenched on the journal whose stray lines had told him in an Algerine trattoria that he had inherited what he never could enjoy . "
182206	182219	181747	181747	I	0	" he thought , gazing down that fiery blaze of shadowless light ; "
182225	182263	181747	181747	I	0	" He thought of those for whose sakes he had become what he was . The distant mellow ringing notes of a trumpetcall floated to his ear from the town at his feet ; it was sounding the "
182268	182506	182532	182532	He	4520	" Old instinct , long habit , made him start and shake his harness together and listen . The trumpet - blast winding cheerily from afar off recalled him to the truth , summoned him sharply back from vain regrets to the facts of daily life . It woke him as it wakes a sleeping charger ; it roused him as it rouses a wounded trooper . He stood hearkening to the familiar music till it had died away , spirited , yet still lingering ; full of fire , yet fading softly down the wind . He listened till the last echo ceased ; then he tore the paper that he held in strips , and let it float away , drifting down the yellow current of the reedy river - channel ; and he half drew from its scabbard the sabre whose blade had been notched and dinted and stained in many midnight skirmishes and many headlong charges under the desert suns , and looked at it as though a friend 's eye gazed at him in the gleam of the trusty steel . And his soldier - like philosophy , his campaigner 's carelessness , his habitual easy negligence that had sometimes been weak as water and sometimes heroic as martyrdom , came back to him with a deeper shadow on it , that was grave with a calm , resolute , silent courage . "
182514	182531	182787	182787	You	4525	" he said , half aloud , in the solitude of the ruined and abandoned mosque . "
182621	182786	182787	182787	You	4525	" And he let his sword drop back again into the scabbard , and quarrelled no more with fate . His hand touched the thirty gold pieces in his sash . He started , as the recollection of the forgotten insult came back on him . He stood awhile in thought ; then he took his resolve . A half - hour of quick movement , for he had become used to the heat as an Arab , and heeded it as little , brought him before the entrance - gates of the Villa Aïoussa . A native of Soudan , in a rich dress , who had the office of porter , asked him politely his errand . Every indigène learns by hard experience to be courteous to a French soldier . Cecil simply asked , in answer , if Madame la Princesse were visible . The negro returned , cautiously , that she was at home , but doubted her being accessible . "
182794	182798	182858	182858	he	709	" he inquired . "
182799	182807	182858	182858	he	709	" No ; on my own errand . "
182808	182811	182858	182858	he	709	" You ! "
182830	182857	182927	182927	He	709	" I. Ask if Corporal Victor , of the Chasseurs , can be permitted a moment 's interview with your mistress . I come by permission , "
182910	182926	182903	182907	a servant of higher authority	4532	" Madame permitted Corporal Victor to be taken to her presence . Would he follow ? "
182952	182954	183271	183273	Gerard de Nerval	895	" campagne "
183261	183268	183285	183285	She	4544	" vieil air languissant et funèbre , "
183278	183284	183554	183554	they	4551	" all Rossini and Weber . "
183497	183533	183637	183637	she	4544	" You have come , I trust , to withdraw your prohibition ? Nothing will give me greater pleasure than to bring his Majesty 's notice to one of the best soldiers his Army holds . "
183653	183662	183682	183682	he	709	" That man has once lived in courts ! "
183663	183681	183686	183686	he	709	" Pardon me , Madame , I do not come to trespass so far upon your benignity , "
183691	183710	183717	183717	her	4544	" I come to express , rather , my regret that you should have made one signal error . "
183711	183712	183717	183717	her	4544	" Error!"—a
183749	183788	183797	183797	She	4544	" One common enough , Madame , in your Order . The error to suppose that under the rough cloth of a private trooper 's uniform there can not possibly be such aristocratic monopolies as nerves to wound . "
183789	183796	183963	183963	he	4556	" I do not comprehend you . "
183818	183961	184104	184104	she	4557	" Possibly not . Mine was the folly to dream that you would ever do so . I should not have intruded on you now , but for this reason : the humiliation you were pleased to pass on me I could neither refuse nor resent to the dealer of it . Had I done so , men who are only too loyal to me would have resented with me , and been thrashed or been shot , as payment . I was compelled to accept it , and to wait until I could return your gift to you . I have no right to complain that you pained me with it , since one who occupies my position ought , I presume , to consider remembrance , even by an outrage , an honour done to him by the Princess Corona . "
184080	184103	184104	184104	she	4557	" I know nothing of what you complain of ; I sent you no money . What is it you would imply ? "
184130	184146	184182	184182	His	4556	" You did not send me these ? Not as payment for the chess service ? "
184147	184181	184275	184275	her	4557	" Assuredly not . After what you said the other day , I should have scarcely been so ill - bred and so heedless of inflicting pain . Who used my name thus ? "
184212	184249	184265	184270	a courtly woman of the world	4559	" You give me infinite happiness , Madame . You little dream how bitter such slights are where one has lost the power to resent them ! It was M. de Châteauroy , who this morning — "
184250	184261	184321	184321	He	4562	" Dared to tell you I sent you those coins ? "
184290	184320	184540	184540	He	4563	" Perhaps I can scarcely say so much . He gave them , and he implied that he gave them from you . The words he spoke were these . "
184399	184539	184540	184540	He	4563	" Believe me , I regret deeply that you should have been wounded by this most coarse indignity ; I grieve sincerely that through myself in any way it should have been brought upon you . As for the perpetrator of it , M. de Châteauroy will be received here no more ; and it shall be my care that he learns not only how I resent his unpardonable use of my name , but how I esteem his cruel outrage to a defender of his own Flag . You did exceedingly well and wisely to acquaint me ; in your treatment of it as an affront that I was without warrant to offer you , you showed the just indignation of a soldier , and — of what I am very sure that you are — a gentleman . "
184546	184573	184594	184594	He	4563	" Madame , you have made me the debtor of my enemy 's outrage . Those words from you are more than sufficient compensation for it . "
184574	184593	184594	184594	He	4563	" A poor one , I fear ! Your Colonel is your enemy , then ? And wherefore ? "
184599	184614	184540	184540	He	4563	" Why at first I scarcely know . We are antagonistic , I suppose . "
184615	184634	184540	184540	He	4563	" But is it usual for officers of his high grade to show such malice to their soldiers ? "
184635	184708	184540	184540	He	4563	" Most unusual . In this service especially so ; although officers rising from the ranks themselves are more apt to contract prejudices and ill - feeling against , as they are to feel favouritism to , their men , than where they enter the regiment in a superior grade at once . At least , that is the opinion I myself have formed , studying the working of the different systems . "
184709	184718	184540	184540	He	4563	" You know the English service , then ? "
184719	184726	184540	184540	He	4563	" I know something of it . "
184727	184740	184540	184540	He	4563	" And still , though thinking this , you prefer the French ? "
184741	184794	184810	184810	Miladi	839	" I distinctly prefer it , as one that knows how to make fine soldiers , and how to reward them ; as one in which a brave man will be valued , and a worn - out veteran will not be left to die like a horse at a knacker 's . "
184795	184808	184810	184810	Miladi	839	" A brave man valued , and yet you are a corporal ! "
184816	184859	184903	184903	She	4566	" Since I am here , Madame , let me thank you , in the Army 's name , for your infinite goodness in acting so munificently on my slight hint . Your generosity has made many happy hearts in the hospital . "
184860	184902	185374	185374	she	4566	" Generosity ! Oh , do not call it by any such name ! What did it cost me ? We are terribly selfish here . I am indebted to you that for once you made me remember those who suffered . "
185358	185373	185374	185374	she	4566	" You seem to be aware of some motive for your commandant 's dislike ? "
185378	185387	185435	185435	her	4566	" Tell me to what you attribute it ? "
185388	185397	185435	185435	her	4566	" It is a long tale , Madame . "
185398	185407	185374	185374	she	4566	" No matter , I would hear it . "
185408	185417	185435	185435	her	4566	" I fear it will only weary you ? "
185418	185428	185541	185541	she	899	" Do not fear that . Tell it me ? "
185533	185540	185541	185541	she	899	" This barbarian is your chief ? "
185549	185574	185681	185681	his	4586	" His enmity is your honour ! I can well credit that he will never pardon your having stood between him and his crime . "
185575	185587	185601	185601	she	899	" He has never pardoned it yet , of a surety . "
185588	185600	185601	185601	she	899	" I will not tell you it was a noble action , "
185621	185666	185676	185676	he	4586	" It came too naturally to a man of honour for you to care for the epithet . Yet it was a great one a most generous one . But I have not heard one thing:—what argument did you use to obtain her release ? "
185667	185675	185681	185681	his	4586	" No one has ever heard it , "
185686	185806	185807	185807	She	4587	" I will trust you with it ; it will not pass elsewhere . I told him enough of — of my own past life to show him that I knew what his had been , and that I knew moreover , though they were dead to me now , men in that greater world of Europe who would believe my statement if I wrote them his outrage on the Emir , and would avenge it for the reputation of the Empire . And unless he released the Emir 's wife , I swore to him that I would so write , though he had me shot on the morrow ; and he knew I should keep my word . "
185833	185847	185601	185601	she	899	" You told him your past . Will you confess it to me ? "
185848	185855	185681	185681	his	4586	" I can not , Madame . "
185856	185860	185807	185807	She	4587	" And why ? "
185861	185886	185601	185601	she	899	" Because I am dead ! Because , in your presence , it becomes more bitter to me to remember that I ever lived . "
185887	185900	185681	185681	his	4586	" You speak strangely . Can not your life have a resurrection ? "
185901	185925	185807	185807	She	4587	" Never , Madame . For a brief hour you have given it one — in dreams . It will have no other . "
185926	185957	185807	185807	She	4587	" But surely there may be ways,—such a story as you have told me brought to the Emperor 's knowledge , you would see your enemy disgraced , yourself honoured ? "
185958	185991	185601	185601	she	899	" Possibly , Madame . But it is out of the question that it should ever be so brought . As I am now , so I desire to live and die . "
185992	186000	185681	185681	his	4586	" You voluntarily condemn yourself to this ? "
186001	186023	185807	185807	She	4587	" I have voluntarily chosen it . I am well sure that the silence I entreat will be kept by you ? "
186024	186089	186147	186147	He	4589	" Assuredly ; unless by your wish it be broken . Yet,—I await my brother 's arrival here ; he is a soldier himself ; I shall hope that he will persuade you to think differently of your future . At any rate , both his and my own influence will always be exerted for you , if you will avail yourself of it . "
186090	186146	186591	186591	she	4591	" You do me much honour , Madame . All I will ever ask of you is to return those coins to my Colonel , and to forget that your gentleness has made me forget , for one merciful half - hour , the sufferance on which alone a private trooper can present himself here . "
186544	186590	186695	186695	she	4591	" One would imagine I was just out of a convent , and weaving a marvellous romance from a mystery and a tristesse , because the first soldier I notice in Algeria has a gentleman 's voice and is ill - treated by his officers ! "
186679	186694	186695	186695	she	4591	" Such a man as that buried in the ranks of this brutalised army ! "
186698	186725	186760	186761	Madame Corona	815	" What fatal chance could bring him here ? Misfortune , not misconduct , surely . I wonder if Lyon could learn ! He shall try . "
186726	186739	186760	186761	Madame Corona	815	" Your Chasseur has the air of a Prince , my love , "
186746	186758	186780	186783	the Marquise de Rénardière	828	" Equivocal compliment ! A much better air than most Princes , "
186787	186815	186816	186817	Venetia Corona	899	" Indeed ! I saw him as he passed out ; and he saluted me as if he had been a Marshal . Why did he come ? "
186833	186938	187081	187081	She	4612	" Ah ! The man has been a gentleman , I dare say . So many of them come to our army . I remember General Villefleur 's telling me — he commanded here awhile — that the ranks of the Zéphyrs and Zouaves were full of well - born men , utterly good - for - nothing , the handsomest scoundrels possible , who had every gift and every grace , and yet come to no better end than a pistol - shot in a ditch or a mortal thrust from Bedouin steel . I dare say your Corporal is one of them . "
186939	186945	187081	187081	She	4612	" It may be so . "
186946	186955	186816	186817	Venetia Corona	899	" But you doubt it , I imagine . "
186956	186980	187081	187081	She	4612	" I am not sure that I do . But this person is certainly unlike a man to whom disgrace has ever attached . "
186981	187003	187081	187081	She	4612	" You think your protégé , then , has become what he is through adversity , I suppose ? Very interesting ! "
187004	187080	187181	187181	he	4614	" I really can tell you nothing of his antecedents . Through his skill at sculpture , and my notice of it , considerable indignity has been brought upon him ; and a soldier can feel , it seems , though it is very absurd that he should ! That is all my concern with the matter , except that I have to teach his commander not to play with my name in his barrackyard . "
187174	187177	187298	187298	He	430	" discipline , "
187294	187297	187849	187866	the man who was " one of them " entirely , whilst yet simply and thoroughly a gentleman	4636	" pleasure . "
187853	187857	188039	188040	his father	6507	" one of them "
188060	188067	188469	188469	he	430	" Il r'viendra ! il r'viendra ! "
188461	188468	188530	188530	he	430	" If I had my heritage ? "
188521	188529	188530	188530	he	430	" I will see her no more , "
188535	188565	188646	188646	his	851	" If I do not take care , I shall end by thinking myself a martyr — the last refuge and consolation of emasculate vanity , of impotent egotism ! "
188676	188680	188646	188646	his	851	" Mon Caporal ! "
188681	188690	188646	188646	his	851	" You , Picpon ? What is it ? "
188691	188707	188646	188646	his	851	" Mon Caporal , there is great news . La danse commence là - bas . "
188709	188716	188646	188646	his	851	" Ah ! Are you sure ? "
188717	188779	188797	188797	He	851	" Sure , mon Caporal . The Arbicos want a fantasia à la clarinette . 36 We are not to know just yet : we are to have the ordre de route to - morrow . I overheard our officers say so . They think we shall have brisk work . And for that they will not punish the vieille lame . "
188780	188796	188822	188822	Picpon	851	" Punish ! Is there fresh disobedience ? In my squadron ; in my absence ? "
188811	188820	188822	188822	Picpon	851	" Not in your tribu , mon Caporal , "
188826	188841	188859	188859	his	851	" It is not much , either . Only the bon - zig Rac . "
188842	188851	188914	188916	an incorrigible pratique	4662	" Rake ! What has he been doing ? "
188957	188960	188996	188996	Picpon	851	" Zéphyrs , "
188987	188994	188996	188996	Picpon	851	" Very little , mon Caporal ! "
189000	189033	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" A mere nothing — a bagatelle ! Run a Spahi through the stomach , that is all . I do n't think the man is so much as dead , even ! "
189034	189070	188996	188996	Picpon	851	" I hope not , indeed . When will you cease this brawling amongst yourselves ? A soldier 's blade should never be turned upon men of his own army . How did it happen ? "
189071	189226	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" Pour si peu de chose , mon Caporal . A woman ! They quarrelled about a little fruit - seller . The homard 37 was in fault . Crache - au - nez - d'la - Mort was there before him ; and was preferred by the girl ; and women should be allowed something to do with choosing their lovers , that I think , though it is true they often take the worst man . They quarrelled ; the homard drew first ; and then , pouf et passe ! quick as thought , Rac lunged through him . He has always a most beautiful stroke . Le Capitaine Argentier was passing , and made a fuss ; else nothing would have been done . They have put him under arrest , but I heard them say they would let him free to - night because we should march at dawn . "
189227	189237	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" I will go and see him at once . "
189238	189251	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" Wait , mon Caporal ; I have something to tell you , "
189257	189289	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" The zig has a motive in what he does . Rac wanted to get the trou . 38 He has done more than one bit of mischief only for that . "
189290	189305	189314	189314	Picpon	851	" Only for what ? He can not be in love with the trou ? "
189306	189312	189314	189314	Picpon	851	" It serves his turn , "
189318	189381	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" Did you never guess why , mon Caporal ? Well , I have . Crache - au - nez - d'la - Mort is a risquetout . 39 officers know it ; the bureaux know it . He would have mounted , mounted , mounted , and been a Captain long before now , if he had not been a pratique . "
189382	189393	189253	189253	Picpon	851	" I know that ; so would many of you . "
189394	189562	189580	189581	Petit Picpon	851	" Ah , mon Caporal ; but that is just what Rac does not choose . In the books his page beats every man 's , except yours . They have talked of him many times for the cross and for promotion ; but whenever they do — cric - crac ! he goes off to a bit a mischief , and gets himself punished . Any rabiat , long or short , serves his purpose . They think him too wild to take out of the ranks . You remember , mon Caporal , that splendid thing that he did five years ago at Sabasasta ? Well , you know they spoke of promoting him for it , and he would have run up all the grades like a squirrel , and died a Kébir , 41 I dare say . What did he do to prevent it ? Why , went that escapade into Oran disguised as a Dervish , and got the trou instead . "
189563	189571	189580	189581	Petit Picpon	851	" To prevent it ? Not purposely ? "
189572	189578	189580	189581	Petit Picpon	851	" Purposely , mon Caporal , "
189591	189664	189725	189725	He	4665	" He always does something when he thinks promotion is coming — something to get himself out of its way , do you see ? And the reason is this : ' tis a good zig , and loves you , and will not be put over your head . ' Me rise afore him ? ' said the zig to me once . ' I 'll have the As de pique 42 "
189734	189735	189743	189743	nobility	4671	" "
189745	189784	189794	189794	he	908	" Picpon glanced at him ; then , with the tact of his nation , glided away and busied himself teaching Flick - Flack to shoulder and present arms , the weapon being a long chibouque - stick . "
189805	189826	189988	189988	Rake	399	" mused Cecil , as he crossed the barrack - yard a few minutes later to visit the incarcerated pratique . "
189947	189983	189988	189988	Rake	399	" A question which perplexes , very wearily , thinkers who have more time , more subtlety , and more logic to bring to its unravelment than Bertie had either leisure or inclination to do . "
190002	190025	190061	190061	I	0	" he asked of the man when he stood alone with him in his place of confinement . Rake flushed a little . "
190066	190067	190152	190152	Sir	6134	" "
190123	190151	190538	190538	You	4698	" Rake fidgeted restlessly , and , to avoid the awkwardness of the question , replied , like a Parliamentary orator , by a flow of rhetoric . "
190512	190537	190543	190543	you	4698	" Rake stopped breathless in his rhetoric , which contained more truth in it , as also more roughness , than most rhetoric does . "
190549	190555	190565	190565	sir	6134	" said Cecil , gently . "
190561	190562	190567	190567	I	0	" "
190570	190584	190591	190591	I	0	" said Rake , something sulkily ; for he felt he was being driven "
190589	190590	190727	190727	Rake	399	" "
190707	190726	190765	190765	you	399	" 43 Cecil 's eyes rested on him with a look that said far more than his answer . "
190780	190781	190793	190793	sir	6134	" "
190795	190802	190828	190828	my	0	" retorted Rake , with ferocity . "
190847	190848	190828	190828	my	0	" "
190854	190860	190948	190949	the Marshal	7967	" cried Rake , vehemently . "
190958	190959	191033	191041	Crache - au - nez - d'la - Mort	784	" "
191021	191032	191033	191041	Crache - au - nez - d'la - Mort	784	" The tears rushed into the hardy eyes of the redoubtable "
191043	191055	191319	191319	I	0	" though he dashed them away in a fury of eloquence . "
191331	191425	191440	191440	you	4737	" And Cecil saw that it would also be kept . The natural lawlessness and fiery passion inborn in Rake had of course not been cooled by the teachings of African warfare ; and his hate was intense against the all - potent Chief of his regiment , as intense as the love he bore to the man whom he had followed out into exile . Cecil tried vainly to argue with him ; all his reasonings fell like hailstones on a cuirass , and made no more impression ; he was resolute . "
191432	191438	191508	191508	you	4737	" he urged at last . "
191505	191506	191508	191508	you	4737	" "
191523	191529	191833	191833	I	0	" returned Rake , sturdily . "
191774	191832	191854	191854	I	0	" And Cecil knew that it was hopeless either to persuade him to his own advantage or to convince him of his disobedience in speaking thus of his supreme , before his non - commissioned , officer . He was himself , moreover , deeply moved by the man 's fidelity . He stretched his hand out : "
191859	191869	191945	191945	sir	6134	" Rake put his own hands behind his back . "
191947	192389	192515	192516	Those men	4755	" And Rake was too sturdily obstinate not to always carry his point . The love that he bore to Cecil was very much such a wild , chivalric , romantic fidelity as the Cavaliers or the Gentlemen of the North bore to their Stuart idols . That his benefactor had become a soldier of Africa in no way lessened the reverent love of his loyalty , any more than theirs was lessened by the adversities of their royal masters . Like theirs , also , it had beauty in its blindness — the beauty that lies in every pure unselfishness . Meanwhile , Picpon 's news was correct . The regiment was ordered out à la danse . 44 There was fresh war in the interior ; and wherever there was the hottest slaughter , there the Black Hawk always flew down with his falcon - flock . When Cecil left his incorrigible zig , the trumpets were sounding an assembly ; there were noise , tumult , eagerness , excitement , delighted zest on every side ; a general order was read to the enraptured squadrons ; they were to leave the town at the first streak of dawn . There were before them death , deprivation , long days of famine , long days of drought and thirst ; parching sun - baked roads ; bitter chilly nights ; fiery furnace - blasts of sirocco ; killing , pitiless , northern winds ; hunger , only sharpened by a snatch of raw meat or a handful of maize ; and the probabilities , ten to one , of being thrust under the sand to rot , or left to have their skeletons picked clean by the vultures . But what of that ? There were also the wild delight of combat , the freedom of lawless warfare , the joy of deep strokes thrust home , the chance of plunder , of wine - skins , of cattle , of women ; above all , that lust for slaughter which burns so deep down in the hidden souls of men , and gives them such brotherhood with wolf , and vulture , and tiger , when once its flame bursts forth . That evening , at the Villa Aïoussa there gathered a courtly assembly , of much higher rank than Algiers can commonly afford , because many of station as lofty as her own had been drawn thither to follow her to what the Princess Corona called her banishment — an endurable banishment enough under those azure skies , in that clear elastic air , and with that charming "
192391	192514	192640	192640	Châteauroy	709	" in which to dwell , yet still a banishment to the reigning beauty of Paris , to one who had the habits and the commands of a wholly undisputed sovereignty in the royal splendour of her womanhood . There was a variety of distractions to prevent ennui ; there were half a dozen clever Paris actors playing the airiest of vaudevilles in the Bijou theatre , beyond the drawing - rooms ; there were some celebrated Italian singers whom an Imperial Prince had brought over in his yacht ; there was the best music ; there was wit as well as homage whispered in her ear . Yet she was not altogether amused ; she was a little touched with ennui . "
192531	192639	192640	192640	Châteauroy	709	" she thought once , turning from a Peer of France , an Austrian Archduke , and a Russian diplomatist . And she smiled a little , furling her fan and musing on the horror that the triad of fashionable conquerors near her would feel if they knew that she thought them duller than an African lascar ! But they only told her things of which she had been long weary , specially of her own beauty ; he had told her of things totally unknown to her , things real , terrible , vivid , strong , sorrowful — strong as life , sorrowful as death . "
192650	192663	192671	192673	The Black Hawk	800	" a voice was saying , that moment , behind her chair . "
192666	192670	192671	192673	The Black Hawk	800	" said another . "
192687	192688	192671	192673	The Black Hawk	800	" "
192696	192697	192704	192704	I	0	" "
192707	192708	192745	192745	She	911	" "
192754	192952	192745	192745	She	911	" The Princess Corona listened ; and her attention wandered further from the Archduke , the Peer , and the diplomatist , as from the vaudeville . She did not find Madame Doche very charming ; and she was absorbed for a time looking at the miniatures on her fan . At the same moment , through the lighted streets of Algiers , Cigarette , like a union of fairy and of fury , was flying with the news . Cigarette had seen the flame of war at its height , and had danced in the midst of its whitest heat , as young children dance to see the fires leap red in the black winter 's night . Cigarette loved the battle , the charge , the wild music of bugles , the thunder - tramp of battalions , the sirocco - sweep of light squadrons , the mad tarantala of triumph when the slaughter was done , the grand swoop of the Eagles down unto the carnage , the wild hurrah of France . She loved them with all her heart and soul ; and she flew now through the starlit sultry night , crying , "
192962	196439	196787	196787	Mazagran	271	" and chanting to the enraptured soldiery a Marseillaise of her own improvisation , all slang , and doggrel , and barrack - grammar ; but fire - giving as a torch , and rousing as a bugle in the way she sang it , waving the tricolour high above her head : The African day was at its noon . From the first break of dawn the battle had raged ; now , at mid - day , it was at its height . Far in the interior , almost on the edge of the great desert , in that terrible season when air that is flame by day is ice by night , and when the scorch of a blazing sun may be followed in an hour by the blinding fury of a snow - storm , the slaughter had gone on hour through hour under a shadowless sky , blue as steel , hard as a sheet of brass . The Arabs had surprised the French encampment where it lay in the centre of an arid plain that was called Zarâila . Hovering like a cloud of hawks on the entrance of the Sahara , massed together for one mighty if futile effort , with all their ancient war - lust , and with a new despair , the tribes who refused the yoke of the alien empire were once again in arms , were once again combined in defence of those limitless kingdoms of drifting sand , of that beloved belt of bare and desolate land so useless to the conqueror , so dear to the nomad . When they had been , as it had been thought , beaten back into the desert wilderness , when , without water and without cattle , it had been calculated that they would , of sheer necessity , bow themselves in submission , or perish of famine and of thirst , they had recovered their ardour , their strength , their resistance , their power to harass without ceasing , if they could never arrest , the enemy . They had cast the torch of war afresh into the land , and here , southward , the flame burned bitterly , and with a merciless tongue devoured the lives of men , licking them up as a forest fire the dry leaves and the touchwood . Circling , sweeping , silently , swiftly , with that rapid spring , that marvellous whirlwind of force , that is of Africa , and of Africa alone , the tribes had rushed down in the darkness of night , lightly as a kite rushes through the gloom of the dawn . For once the vigilance of the invader served him nought ; for once the Frankish camp was surprised off its guard . Whilst the air was still chilly with the breath of the night , whilst the first gleam of morning had barely broken through the mists of the east , whilst the picket - fires burned through the dusky gloom , and the sentinels paced slowly to and fro , hearing nothing worse than the stealthy tread of the jackal or the muffled flight of a night - bird , afar in the south a great dark cloud had risen , darker than the brooding shadows of the earth and sky . The cloud swept onward , like a mass of cirri , in those shadows shrouded . Fleet as though wind - driven , dense as though thunder - charged , it moved over the plains . As it grew nearer and nearer , it grew greyer , a changing mass of white and black that fused , in the obscurity , into a shadow - colour ; a dense array of men and horses flitting noiselessly like spirits , and as though guided alone by one rein and moved alone by one breath and one will ; not a bit champed , not a linen - fold loosened , not a shiver of steel was heard ; as silently as the winds of the desert sweep up northward over the plains , so they rode now , host upon host of the warriors of the soil . The outlying videttes , the advanced sentinels , had scrutinised so long through the night every wavering shade of cloud and moving form of buffalo in the dim distance , that their sleepless eyes , strained and aching , failed to distinguish this moving mass that was so like the brown plains and starless sky that it could scarce be told from them . The night , too , was bitter ; northern cold cut hardly chillier than this that parted the blaze of one hot day from the blaze of another . The sea - winds were blowing cruelly keen , and men who at noon gladly stripped to their shirts shivered now where they lay under canvas . Awake while his comrades slept around him , Cecil was stretched half unharnessed . The foraging duty of the past twenty - four hours had been work harassing and heavy , inglorious and full of fatigue . The country round was bare as a table - rock ; the water - courses poor , choked with dust and stones , unfed as yet by the rains or snows of the approaching winter . The horses suffered sorely , the men scarce less . The hay for the former was scant and bad ; the rations for the latter often cut off by flying skirmishers of the foe . The campaign , so far as it had gone , had been fruitless , yet had cost largely in human life . The men died rapidly of dysentery , disease , and the chills of the nights , and had severe losses in countless obscure skirmishes that served no end except to water the African soil with blood . True , France would fill the gaps up as fast as they occurred , and the Moniteur would only allude to the present operations when it could give a flourishing line descriptive of the Arabs being driven back decimated to the borders of the Sahara . But as the flourish of the Moniteur would never reach a thousand little wayside huts , and seaside cabins , and vine - dressers ' sunny nests , where the memory of some lad who had gone forth never to return would leave a deadly shadow athwart the humble threshold , so the knowledge that they were only so many automata in the hands of government , whose loss would merely be noted that it might be efficiently supplied , was not that wine - draught of La Gloire which poured the strength and the daring of gods into the limbs of the men of Jena and of Austerlitz . Still , there was the war - lust in them , and there was the fire of France ; they fought not less superbly here , where to be food for jackal and kite was their likeliest doom , than their sires had done under the eagles of the First Empire , when the Conscript hero of to - day was the glittering Marshal of to - morrow . Cecil had awakened while the camp still slept . Do what he would , force himself into the fulness of this fierce and hard existence as he might , he could not burn out or banish a thing that had many a time haunted him , but never as it did now — the remembrance of a woman . He almost laughed as he lay there on a pile of rotting straw , and wrung the truth out of his own heart that he — a soldier of these exiled squadrons — was mad enough to love that woman whose deep proud eyes had dwelt with such serene pity upon him . Yet his hand clenched on the straw as it had clenched once when the operator 's knife had cut down through the bones of his breast to reach a bullet that , left in his chest , would have been death . If in the sight of men he had only stood in the rank that was his by birthright , he could have strived for — it might be that he could have roused — some answering passion in her . But that chance was lost to him for ever . Well , it was but one thing more that was added to all that he had of his own will given up . He was dead ; he must be content , as the dead must be , to leave the warmth of kisses , the glow of delight , the possession of a woman 's loveliness , the homage of men 's honour , the gladness of successful desires , to those who still lived in the light he had quitted . He had never allowed himself the emasculating indulgence of regret ; he flung it off him now . Flick - Flack , coiled asleep in his bosom , thrilled , stirred , and growled . He rose , and , with the little dog under his arm , looked out from the canvas . He knew that the most vigilant sentry in the service had not the instinct for a foe afar off that Flick - Flack possessed . He gazed keenly southward , the poodle growling on ; that cloud so dim , so distant , caught his sight . Was it a moving herd , a shifting mist , a shadow - play between the night and dawn ? For a moment longer he watched it ; then what it was he knew , or felt by such strong instinct as makes knowledge ; and like the blast of a clarion his alarm rang over the unarmed and slumbering camp . An instant , and the hive of men , so still , so motionless , broke into violent movement ; and from the tents the half - clothed sleepers poured , wakened , and fresh in wakening as hounds . Perfect discipline did the rest . With marvellous , with matchless swiftness and precision they harnessed and got under arms . They were but fifteen hundred or so in all — a single squadron of Chasseurs , two battalions of Zouaves , half a corps of Tirailleurs , and some Turcos ; only a branch of the main body , and without artillery . But they were some of the flower of the Army of Algiers , and they roused in a second with the vivacious ferocity of the bounding tiger , with the glad eager impatience for the slaughter of the unloosed hawk . Yet , rapid in its wondrous celerity as their united action was , it was not so rapid as the downward sweep of that war - cloud that came so near , with the tossing of white draperies and the shine of countless sabres , now growing clearer and clearer out of the darkness , till , with a whirr like the noise of an eagle 's wings , and a swoop like an eagle 's seizure , the Arabs whirled down upon them , met a few yards in advance by the answering charge of the Light Cavalry . There was a crash as if rock were hurled upon rock , as the Chasseurs , scarce seated in saddle , rushed forward to save the pickets , to encounter the first blind force of the attack , and to give the infantry , further in , more time for harness and defence . Out of the caverns of the night an armed multitude seemed to have suddenly poured . A moment ago , they had slept in security ; now , thousands on thousands whom they could not number , whom they could but dimly even perceive , were thrown on them in immeasurable hosts , which the encircling cloud of dust served but to render vaster , ghastlier , and more majestic . The Arab line stretched out with wings that seemed to extend on and on without end ; the line of the Chasseurs was not one - half its length ; they were but a single squadron flung in their stirrups , scarcely clothed , knowing only that the foe was upon them , caring only that their sword - hands were hard on their weapons . With all the élan of France they launched themselves forward to break the rush of the desert horses ; they met with a terrible sound , like falling trees , like clashing metal . The hoofs of the rearing chargers struck each other 's breasts , and these bit and tore at each other 's manes , while their riders reeled down dead . Frank and Arab were blended in one inextricable mass as the charging squadrons encountered . The outer wings of the tribes were spared the shock , and swept on to meet the bayonets of Zouaves and Turcos as at their swift foot - gallop the Enfans Perdus of France threw themselves forward from the darkness . The cavalry was enveloped in the overwhelming numbers of the centre ; and the flanks seemed to cover the Zouaves and Tirailleurs as some great settling mist may cover the cattle who move beneath it . It was not a battle ; it was a frightful tangling of men and brutes . No contest of modern warfare such as commences and conquers by a duel of artillery , and gives the victory to whosoever has the superiority of ordnance ; but a conflict , hand to hand , breast to breast , life for life , a Homeric combat of spear and of sword even whilst the first volleys of the answering musketry pealed over the plain . For once the Desert avenged in like that terrible inexhaustibility of supply wherewith the Empire so long had crushed them beneath the overwhelming difference of numbers . It was the Day of Mazagran once more , as the light of the morning broke , grey , silvered , beautiful , in the far , dim distance , beyond the tawny seas of reeds . Smoke and sand soon densely rose above the struggle , white , hot , blinding ; but out from it the lean dark Bedouin faces , the snowy haïcks , the red burnous , the gleam of the Tunisian muskets , the flash of the silver - hilted yataghans , were seen fused in a mass with the brawny naked necks of the Zouaves , with the shine of the French bayonets , with the tossing manes and glowing nostrils of the Chasseurs ' horses , with the torn , stained silk of the raised Tricolour , through which the storm of balls flew thick and fast as hail , yet whose folds were never suffered to fall , though again and again the hand that held its staff was cut away or was unloosed in death , yet ever found another to take its charge before the Flag could once have trembled in the enemy 's sight . The Chasseurs could not charge ; they were hemmed in , packed between bodies of horsemen that pressed them together as between iron plates ; now and then they could cut their way through , clear enough to reach their comrades of the demie cavalerie , but as often as they did so , so often the overwhelming numbers of the Arabs surged in on them afresh like a flood , and closed upon them , and drove them back . Every soldier in the squadron that lived kept his life by sheer , breathless , ceaseless , hand - to - hand sword - play , hewing right and left , front and rear , without pause , as in the great tangled forests of the west men hew aside branch and brushwood ere they can force one forward step . The gleam of the dawn spread in one golden glow of morning , and the day rose radiant over the world ; they stayed not for its beauty or its peace ; the carnage went on hour upon hour ; men began to grow drunk with slaughter as with raki . It was sublimely grand ; it was hideously hateful — this wild - beast struggle , this heaving tumult of striving lives that ever and anon stirred the vast war - cloud of smoke and broke from it as the lightning from the night . The sun laughed in its warmth over a thousand hills and streams , over the blue seas lying northward , and over the yellow sands of the south ; but the touch of its heat only made the flame in their blood burn fiercer ; the fulness of its light only served to show them clearer where to strike and how to slay . It was bitter , stifling , cruel work ; with their mouths choked with sand , with their throats caked with thirst , with their eyes blind with smoke ; cramped as in a vice , scorched with the blaze of powder , covered with blood and with dust ; while the steel was thrust through nerve and sinew , or the shot ploughed through bone and flesh . The answering fire of the Zouaves and Tirailleurs kept the Arabs further at bay , and mowed them faster down ; but in the Chasseurs ' quarter of the field — parted from the rest of their comrades as they had been by the rush of that broken charge with which they had sought to save the camp and arrest the foe — the worst pressure of the attack was felt , and the fiercest of the slaughter fell . The Chef d'Escadron had been shot dead as they had first swept out to encounter the advance of the desert horsemen ; one by one the officers had been cut down , singled out by the keen eyes of their enemies , and throwing themselves into the deadliest of the carnage with the impetuous self - devotion characteristic of their service . At the last there remained but a mere handful out of all the brilliant squadron that had galloped down in the grey of the dawn to meet the whirlwind of Arab fury . At their head was Cecil . Two horses had been killed under him , and he had thrown himself afresh across unwounded chargers , whose riders had fallen in the mêlée , and at whose bridles he had caught as he shook himself free of the dead animals ' stirrups . His head was uncovered ; his uniform , hurriedly thrown on , had been torn aside , and his chest was bare to the red folds of his sash : he was drenched with blood , not his own , that had rained on him as he fought ; and his face and his hands were black with smoke and with powder . He could not see a yard in front of him ; he could not tell how the day went anywhere , save in that corner where his own troop was hemmed in . As fast as they beat the Arabs back , and forced themselves some clearer space , so fast the tribes closed in afresh . No orders reached him from the General of Brigade in command ; except for the well - known war - shouts of the Zouaves that ever and again rang above the din , he could not tell whether the French battalions were not cut utterly to pieces under the immense numerical superiority of their foes . All he could see was that every officer of Chasseurs was down , and that unless he took the vacant place , and rallied them together , the few score troopers that were still left would scatter , confused and demoralised , as the best soldiers will at times when they can see no chief to follow . He spurred the horse he had just mounted against the dense crowd opposing him , against the hard black wall of dust , and smoke , and steel , and savage faces , and lean swarthy arms , which were all that his eyes could see , and that seemed impenetrable as granite , moving and changing though it was . He thrust the grey against it , whilst he waved his sword above his head : "
196452	196786	196789	196789	Mazagran	271	" His voice , well known , well loved , thrilled the hearts of his comrades , and brought them together like a trumpet - call . They had gone with him many a time into the hell of battle , into the jaws of death . They surged about him now , striking , thrusting , forcing with blows of their sabres or their lances and blows of their beasts ' fore - feet a passage one to another , until they were reunited once more as one troop , whilst their shrill shouts , like an oath of vengeance , echoed after him in the butchery , that has pealed victorious over so many fields from the soldiery of France . They loved him ; he had called them his brethren . They were like lambs for him to lead , like tigers for him to incite . They could scarcely see his face in that great red mist of combat , in that horrible stifling pressure on every side that jammed them as if they were in a press of iron , and gave them no power to pause , though their animals ' hoofs struck the lingering life out of some half - dead comrade , or trampled over the writhing limbs of the brother - in - arms they loved dearest and best . But his voice reached them , clear and ringing in its appeal for sake of the country they never once forgot or once reviled , though in her name they were starved and beaten like rebellious hounds , though in her cause they were exiled all their manhood through under the sun of this cruel , ravenous , burning Africa . They could see him lift aloft the Eagle he had caught from the last hand that had borne it , the golden gleam of the young morning flashing like flame upon the brazen wings ; and they shouted , as with one throat , "
196791	196902	196789	196789	Mazagran	271	" As the battalion of Mazagran had died keeping the ground through the whole of the scorching day , while the fresh hordes poured down on them like ceaseless torrents snow - fed and exhaustless , so they were ready to hold the ground here , until of all their numbers there should be left not one living man . He glanced back on them , guarding his head the while from the lances that were rained on him ; and he lifted the Guidon higher and higher , till , out of the ruck and the throng , the brazen bird caught afresh the rays of the rising sun . "
196907	197191	196789	196789	Mazagran	271	" he shouted . Then , like arrows launched at once from twice a hundred bows , they charged , he still slightly in advance of them , the bridle flung upon his horse 's neck , his head and breast bare , one hand striking aside with his blade the steel shafts as they poured on him , the other holding high above the press the Eagle of the Bonapartes . The effort was superb . Dense bodies of Arabs parted them in the front from the camp where the battle raged , harassed them in the rear with flying shots and hurled lances , and forced down on them on either side , like the closing jaws of a trap . The impetuosity of their onward movement was , for the moment , irresistible ; it bore headlong all before it ; the desert horses recoiled , and the desert riders themselves yielded , crushed , staggered , trodden aside , struck aside , by the tremendous impetus with which the Chasseurs were thrown upon them . For the moment , the Bedouins gave way , shaken and confused , as at the head of the French they saw this man , with his hair blowing in the wind , and the sun on the fairness of his face , ride down on them thus unharmed , though a dozen spears were aimed at his naked breast , dealing strokes sure as death right and left as he went , with the light from the hot blue skies on the ensign of France that he bore . They knew him ; they had met him in many conflicts ; and wherever the "
197195	197346	196789	196789	Mazagran	271	" as they called him , came , there they knew of old the battle was hard to win ; bitter to the bitterest end , whether that end were defeat , or victory costly as defeat in its achievement . And for the moment they recoiled under the shock of that fiery onslaught ; for the moment they parted , and wavered , and oscillated beneath the impetus with which he hurled his hundred Chasseurs on them , with that light , swift , indescribable rapidity and resistlessness of attack characteristic of the African Cavalry . Though a score or more , one on another , had singled him out with special and violent attack , he had gone , as yet , unwounded , save for a lance - thrust in his shoulder , of which , in the heat of the conflict , he was unconscious . The "
197349	197389	196789	196789	Mazagran	271	" was upon him ; and when once this had been lit in him , the Arabs knew of old that the fiercest vulture in the Frankish ranks never struck so surely home as this hand that his comrades called "
197399	197495	198069	198069	You	4763	" As he spurred his horse down on them now , twenty blades glittered against him ; the foremost would have cut straight down through the bone of his bared chest and killed him at a single lunge , but as its steel flashed in the sun , one of his troopers threw himself against it , and parried the stroke from him by sheathing it in his own breast . The blow was mortal ; and the one who had saved him reeled down off his saddle under the hoofs of the trampling chargers . "
197500	198068	198079	198079	them	4765	" he murmured with a smile ; and as the charge swept onward , Cecil , with a great cry of horror , saw the feet of the maddened horses strike to pulp the writhing body , and saw the black wistful eyes of the Enfant de Paris look upwards to him once , with love , and fealty , and unspeakable sweetness gleaming through their darkened sight . But to pause was impossible . Though the French horses were forced with marvellous dexterity through a bristling forest of steel , though the remnant of the once - glittering squadron was cast against them in as headlong a daring as if it had half the regiments of the Empire at its back , the charge availed little against the hosts of the desert that had rallied and swooped down afresh almost as soon as they had been , for the instant of the shock , panic - stricken . The hatred of the opposed races was aroused in all its blind ravening passion ; the conquered had the conquering nation for once at their mercy , for once at tremendous disadvantage ; on neither side was there aught except that one instinct for slaughter , which , once awakened , kills every other in the breast in which it burns . The Arabs had cruel years to avenge — years of a loathed tyranny , years of starvation and oppression , years of constant flight southward , with no choice but submission or death . They had deadly memories to wash out — memories of brethren who had been killed like carrion by the invaders ' shot and steel ; of nomadic freedom begrudged and crushed by civilisation ; of young children murdered in the darkness of the caverns with the sulphurous smoke choking the innocent throats that had only breathed the golden air of a few summers ; of women , well - beloved , torn from them in the hot flames of burning tents and outraged before their eyes with insult , whose end was a bayonet - thrust into their breasts , whose sin was fidelity to the vanquished . They had vengeance to do that made every stroke seem righteous and holy in their sight ; that nerved each of their bare and sinewy arms as with the strength of a thousand limbs . Right — so barren , so hopeless , so unavailing — had long been with them . Now with it was added at last the power of might ; and they exercised the power with the savage ruthlessness of the desert . They closed in on every side ; wheeling their swift coursers hither and thither ; striking with lance and blade ; hemming in , beyond escape , the doomed fragment of the Frankish squadron till there remained of them but one small nucleus , driven close together , rather as infantry will form than as cavalry usually does — a ring of horsemen , of which every one had his face to the foe ; a solid circle curiously wedged one against the other , with the bodies of chargers and of men deep around them , and with the ground soaked with blood till the sand was one red morass . Cecil held the Eagle still , and looked round on the few left to him . "
198081	198177	198079	198079	them	4765	" They answered with a pealing cry , terrible as the cry of the lion in the hush of night , but a shout that had in it assent , triumph , fealty , victory , even as they obeyed him and drew up to die , whilst in their front was the young brow of Petit Picpon turned upwards to the glare of the skies . There was nothing for them but to draw up thus , and await their butchery , defending the Eagle to the last ; looking till the last towards that "
198185	198329	198079	198079	them	4765	" as they had often termed it , that was to them now as the face of Napoléon was to the soldiers who loved him . There was a pause , brief as is the pause of the lungs to take a fuller breath . The Arabs honoured these men who , alone in the midst of the hostile force , held their ground and prepared thus to be slaughtered one by one , till of all the squadron that had ridden out in the darkness of the dawn there should be only a black , huddled , stiffened heap of dead men and of dead beasts . The chief who led them pressed them back , withholding them from the end that was so near to their hands when they should stretch that single ring of horsemen all lifeless in the dust . "
198335	198344	198079	198079	them	4765	" he cried , in the Sabir tongue ; "
198351	198443	198079	198079	them	4765	" Cecil looked back once more on the fragment of his troop , and raised the Eagle higher aloft where the wings should glisten in the fuller day . Half - naked . scorched , blinded , with an open gash in his shoulder where the lance had struck , and with his brow wet with the great dews of the noon - heat and the breathless toil , his eyes were clear as they flashed with the light of the sun in them ; his mouth smiled as he answered : "
198457	198474	198079	198079	them	4765	" A hourrah of wild delight from the Chasseurs he led greeted and ratified the choice : "
198484	198594	198079	198079	them	4765	" they shouted in the words , which , even if they be but legendary , are too true to the spirit of the soldiers of France not to be as truth in their sight . Then , with their swords above their heads , they waited for the collision of the terrible attack which would fall on them upon every side , and strike all the sentient life out of them before the sun should be one point higher in the heavens . It came : with a yell as of wild beasts in their famine , the Arabs threw themselves forward , the chief himself singling out the "
198597	198658	198079	198079	them	4765	" with the violence of a lion flinging himself on a leopard . One instant longer , one flash of time , and the tribes pressing on them would have massacred them like cattle driven into the pens of slaughter . Ere it could be done , a voice like the ring of a silver trumpet echoed over the field : "
198671	198910	198079	198079	them	4765	" Above the din , the shouts , the tumult , the echoing of the distant musketry , that silvery cadence rung ; down into the midst , with the Tricolour waving above her head , the bridle of her fiery mare between her teeth the raven of the dead Zouave flying above her head , and her pistol levelled in deadly aim , rode Cigarette . The lightning fire of the crossing swords played round her , the glitter of the lances dazzled her eyes , the reek of smoke and of carnage was round her ; but she dashed down into the heart of the conflict as gaily as though she rode at a review , laughing , shouting , waving the torn colours that she grasped , with her curls blowing back in the breeze , and her bright young face set in the warrior 's lust . Behind her , by scarcely a length , galloped three squadrons of Chasseurs and Spahis ; trampling headlong over the corpse - strewn field , and breaking through the masses of the Arabs as though they were seas of corn . She wheeled her mare round by Cecil 's side at the moment when , with six swift passes of his blade he had warded off the Chief 's blows and sent his own sword down through the chest - bones of the Bedouin 's mighty form . "
198921	199188	198079	198079	them	4765	" She gave the order as though she were a Marshal of the Empire , the sun - blaze full on her where she sat on the rearing , fretting , half - bred grey , with the Tricolour folds above her head , and her teeth tight gripped on the chain - bridle , and her face all glowing and warm and full of the fierce fire of war — a little Amazon in scarlet , and blue , and gold ; a young Jeanne d'Arc , with the crimson fez in lieu of the silvered casque , and the gay broderies of her fantastic dress instead of the breastplate of steel . And with the Flag of her idolatry , the Flag that was as her religion , floating back as she went , she spurred her mare straight against the Arabs , straight over the lifeless forms of the hundreds slain ; and after her poured the fresh squadrons of cavalry , the ruby burnous of the Spahis streaming on the wind as their darling led them on to retrieve the day for France . Not a bullet struck , not a sabre grazed her ; but there , in the heat and the press of the worst of the slaughter , Cigarette rode hither and thither , to and fro , her voice ringing like a bird 's song over the field , in command , in applause , in encouragement , in delight ; bearing her standard alóft and untouched ; dashing heedless through a storm of blows ; cheering on her "
199190	199225	198079	198079	them	4765	" to the charge again and again ; and all the while with the sunlight full on her radiant spirited head , and with the grim grey raven flying above her , shrieking shrilly its "
199232	199850	199868	199868	you	917	" The Army believed with superstitious faith in the potent spell of that veteran bird , and the story ran that whenever he flew above a combat France was victor before the sun set . The echo of the raven 's cry , and the presence of the child who , they knew , would have a thousand musket - balls fired in her fair young breast rather than live to see them defeated , made the fresh squadrons sweep in like a whirlwind , bearing down all before them . Cigarette saved the day . Before the sun had declined from his zenith the French were masters of the field , and pursued the retreat of the Arabs till for miles along the plain the line of their flight was marked with horses that had dropped dead in the strain , and with the motionless forms of their desert - riders ; their cold hands clenched in the loose hot sands , and their stern faces turned upwards to the cloudless scorch of their native skies , under whose freedom they would never again ride forth to the joyous clash of the cymbals and the fierce embrace of the death - grapple . When at length she returned , coming in with her ruthless Spahis , whose terrible passions she feared no more that Virgil 's Volscian huntress feared the beasts of forest and plain , the raven still hovered above her exhausted mare , the torn flag was still in her left hand ; and the bright laughter , the flash of ecstatic triumph , was still in her face as she sang the last lines of her own war - chant . The leopard nature was roused in her . She was a soldier ; death had been about her from her birth ; she neither feared to give nor to receive it ; she was proud as ever was young Pompeius flushed with the glories of his first eastern conquests ; she was happy as such elastic , sunlit , dauntless youth as hers alone can be , returning in the reddening after - glow at the head of her comrades to the camp that she had saved . She could be cruel — women are , when roused , as many a revolution has shown ; she could be heroic — she would have died a hundred deaths for France ; she was vain with a vivacious child - like vanity ; she was brave with a bravery beside which many a man 's high courage palled . Cruelty , heroism , vanity , and bravery were all on fire , and all fed to their uttermost , most eager , most ardent flame now that she came back at the head of her Spahis ; while all who remained of the soldiers who , but for her , would have been massacred long ere then , without one spared amongst them , threw themselves forward , crowded round her , caressed , and laughed , and wept , and shouted with all the changes of their intense mercurial temperaments , kissed her boots , her sash , her mare 's drooping neck , and , lifting her , with wild vivas that rent the sky , on to the shoulders of the four tallest men amongst them , bore her to the presence of the only officer of high rank who had survived the terrors of the day , a Chef de Bataillon of the Zouaves . And he , a grave and noble - looking veteran , uncovered his head and bowed before her as courtiers bow before their queens . "
199870	199920	199934	199934	I	0	" The tears rushed swift and hot into Cigarette 's bright eyes — tears of joy , tears of pride . She was but a child still in much , and she could be moved by the name of France as other children by the name of their mothers . "
199927	199933	199934	199934	I	0	" she said , rapidly . "
199939	199975	200029	200030	mon Commandant	886	" The frenzied hurrahs of the men who heard her drowned her words . They loved her for what she had done ; they loved her better still because she set no count on it . "
199982	199990	200000	200000	you	4771	" said the Major of the Zouaves . "
200005	200026	200189	200189	I	0	" Cigarette , balancing herself with a foot on either shoulder of her supporters , gave the salute and answered : "
200167	200188	200339	200339	you	853	" And Cigarette pointed to a far - off slope crowned with the remains of a once - mighty forest . "
200341	200342	200339	200339	you	853	" "
200346	200354	200380	200380	I	0	" muttered the Zouave in his beard . "
200374	200378	200487	200487	Mademoiselle	917	" Cigarette laughed . "
200473	200486	200490	200491	all soldiers	4790	" And Cigarette laughed again . Men were such bunglers — ouf ! "
200496	200505	200516	200517	All soldiers	4790	" answered the Major of Zouaves , curtly , "
200514	200515	200516	200517	All soldiers	4790	" "
200525	200539	200544	200544	They	4790	" retorted Cigarette , who never took a compliment at the expense of her "
200542	200543	200643	200643	Napoléon	802	" "
200644	200659	200670	200670	you	917	" — and Cigarette uncovered her curly head reverentially as at the name of a deity—"Napoléon
200678	200679	200890	200890	you	4801	" "
200716	200887	200917	200918	the fool	2385	" And the Chef de Bataillon saluted her once more , and turned away to view the carnage - strewn plain , and number the few who remained out of all those who had been wakened by the clash of the Arab arms in the grey of the earliest dawn . Cigarette 's eyes flashed like sun playing on water and her flushed cheeks grew scarlet . Since her infancy it had been her dream to have the Cross , to have the Grande Croix to lie above her little lion 's heart ; it had been the one longing , the one ambition , the one undying desire of her soul ; and lo ! she touched its realisation ! The wild , frantic , tumultuous cheers and caresses of her soldiery , who could not triumph in her and triumph with her enough to satiate them , recalled her to the actual moment . She sprang down from her elevation , and turned on them with a rebuke . "
200921	201419	201425	201425	he	4806	" And , though she had ridden fifty miles that day , if she had ridden one — though she had eaten nothing since sunrise , and had only had one draught of bad water — though she was tired , and stiff , and bruised , and parched with thirst , Cigarette dashed off as lightly as a young goat to look for the wounded and the dying men who strewed the plain far and near . She remembered one whom she had not seen after that first moment in which she had given the word to the squadrons to charge . It was a terrible sight — the arid plain , lying in the scarlet glow of sunset , covered with dead bodies , with mutilated limbs , with horses gasping and writhing , with men raving like mad creatures in the torture of their wounds . It was a sight which always went to her heart . She was a true soldier , and , though she could deal death pitilessly , could , when the delirium of war was over , tend and yield infinite compassion to those who were in suffering . But such scenes had been familiar to her from the earliest years when , on an infant 's limbs , she had toddled over such battle - fields , and wound tiny hands in the hair of some dead trooper who had given her sweetmeats the hour before , vainly trying to awaken him . And she went through all the intense misery and desolation of the scene now without shrinking , and with that fearless tender devotion to the wounded which Cigarette showed in common with other soldiers of her nation , being , like them , a young lion in the combat , but a creature unspeakably gentle and full of sympathy when the fury of the fight was over . She had seen great slaughter often enough , but even she had not seen any struggle more close , more murderous , than this had been . The dead lay by hundreds ; French and Arab locked in one another 's limbs as they had fallen when the ordinary mode of warfare had failed to satiate their violence , and they had wrestled together like wolves fighting and rending each other over a disputed carcase . The bitterness and the hatred of the contest were shown in the fact that there were very few merely wounded or disabled ; almost all of the numbers that strewed the plain were dead . It had been a battle - royal , and , but for her arrival with the fresh squadrons , not one among her countrymen would have lived to tell the story of this terrible duello , which had been as magnificent in heroism as any Austerlitz or Gemappes , but which would pass unhonoured , almost unnamed , amongst the futile fruitless heroisms of Algerian warfare . "
201428	201492	201425	201425	he	4806	" she thought , as she bent over each knot of motionless bodies where here and there some faint stifled breath or some moan of agony told that life still lingered beneath the huddled stiffening heap . And a tightness came at her heart an aching fear made her shrink , as she raised each hidden face that she had never known before . "
201498	201505	201528	201528	him	4806	" she said fiercely to herself . "
201532	201579	201967	201969	Flick - Flack	902	" But , despite her hatred for him , she could not banish that hot feverish hope , that cold suffocating fear , which , turn by turn , quickened and slackened the bright flow of her warm young blood as she searched amongst the slain . "
201586	201966	202394	202394	He	4808	" she said , softly , as she reached at last the place where the young Chasseur lay , and lifted the black curls off his forehead . The hoofs of the charging cavalry had cruelly struck and trampled his frame ; the back had been broken , and the body had been mashed as in a mortar under the thundering gallop of the Horse ; but the face was still uninjured , and had a strange pathetic beauty , a calm and smiling courage , on it . It was ashen pale ; but the great black eyes that had glistened in such malicious mirth , and sparkled in such malignant mischief during life , were open , and had a mournful pitiful serenity in their look as if from their depths the soul still gazed — that soul which had been neglected and cursed , and left to wander amongst evil ways , yet which , through all its darkness , all its ignorance , had reached , unguided , to love and to nobility . Cigarette closed their long black lashes down on the white cheeks with soft and reverent touch ; she had seen that look ere now on the upturned faces of the dead who had strewn the barricades of Paris , with the words of the Marseillaise the last upon their lips . To her there could be no fate fairer , no glory more glorious , than this of his — to die for France . And she laid him gently down , and left him , and went on with her quest . It was here that she had lost sight of Cecil as they had charged together , and her mare , enraged and intoxicated with noise and terror , had torn away at a full speed that had outstripped even the swiftest of her Spahis . A little farther on a dog 's moan caught her ear ; she turned and looked across . Upright , amongst a ghastly pile of men and chargers , sat the small snowy poodle of the Chasseurs , beating the air with its little paws as it had been taught to do when it needed anything , and howling piteously as it begged . "
201979	202393	202411	202411	you	902	" she cried to him , while , with a bound , she reached the spot . The dog leaped on her , rejoicing . The dead were thick there — ten or twelve deep — French trooper and Bedouin rider flung across each other , horribly entangled with the limbs , the manes , the shattered bodies of their own horses . Among them she saw the face she sought as the dog eagerly ran back , caressing the hair of a soldier who lay underneath the weight of his grey charger , that had been killed by a musket - ball . Cigarette grew very pale , as she had never grown when the hail - storm of shots had been pouring on her in the midst of a battle ; but , with the rapid skill and strength she had acquired long before , she reached the place , lifted aside first one , then another , of the lifeless Arabs that had fallen above him , and drew out from beneath the suffocating pressure of his horse 's weight the head and the frame of the Chasseur whom Flick - Flack had sought out and guarded . For the moment she thought him dead ; then , as she drew him out where the cooler breeze of the declining day could reach him , a slow breath , painfully drawn , moved his chest ; she saw that he was unconscious from the stifling oppression under which he had been buried since the noon ; an hour more without the touch of fresher air , and life would have been extinct . Cigarette had with her the flask of brandy that she always brought on such errands as these ; she forced the end between his lips , and poured some down his throat ; her hand shook slightly as she did so , a weakness the gallant little campaigner never before then had known . It revived him in a degree ; he breathed more freely , though heavily , and with difficulty still ; but gradually the deadly leaden colour of his face was replaced by the hue of life , and his heart began to beat more loudly . Consciousness did not return to him ; he lay motionless and senseless , with his head resting on her lap , and with Flick - Flack , in eager affection , licking his hands and his hair . "
202415	202428	202448	202448	Miladi	839	" said Cigarette , while she wetted his lips with more brandy . "
202450	202496	202448	202448	Miladi	839	" Still , though she thought this , she let his head lie on her lap , and , as she looked down on him , there was the glisten as of tears in the brave sunny eyes of the little Friend of the Flag . "
202508	203210	202448	202448	Miladi	839	" she muttered in her teeth , drawing the silk - like lock of his hair through her hands , and looking at the stricken strength , the powerless limbs , the bare chest , cut and bruised , and heaved painfully by each uneasy breath . She was of a vivid , voluptuous , artistic nature ; she was thoroughly woman - like in her passions and her instincts , though she so fiercely contemned womanhood . If he had not been beautiful , she would never have looked twice at him , never once have pitied his fate . And he was beautiful still , though his hair was heavy with dew and dust , though his face was scorched with powder , though his eyes were closed as with the leaden weight of death , and his beard was covered with the red stain of blood that had flowed from the lance - wound on his shoulder . He was not dead ; he was not even in peril of death . She knew enough of medical lore to know that it was but the insensibility of exhaustion and suffocation : and she did not care that he should waken . She drooped her head over him , moving her hand softly among the masses of his curls , and watching the quickening beatings of his heart under the bare strong nerves . Her face grew tender , and warm , and eager , and melting with a marvellous change of passionate hues . She had all the ardour of southern blood ; without a wish he had wakened in her a love that grew daily and hourly , though she would not acknowledge it . She loved to see him lie there as though he were asleep , to cheat herself into the fancy that she watched his rest to wake it with a kiss on his lips . In that unconsciousness , in that abandonment , he seemed wholly her own ; passion which she could not have analysed made her bend above him with a half - fierce half - dreamy delight in that solitary possession of his beauty , of his life . The restless movements of little Flick - Flack detached a piece of twine passed round his favourite 's throat ; the glitter of gold arrested Cigarette 's eyes . She caught what the poodle 's impatient caress had broken from the string ; it was a small blue enamel medallion bonbon - box , with a hole through it by which it had been slung — a tiny toy once costly , now tarnished , for it had been carried through many rough scenes and many years of hardship , had been bent by blows struck at the breast against which it rested , and was clotted now with blood . Inside it was a woman 's ring , of sapphires and opals . She looked at both close in the glow of the setting sun ; then passed the string through and fastened the box afresh . It was a mere trifle , but it sufficed to banish her dream , to arouse her to contemptuous impatient bitterness with that new weakness that had for the hour broken her down to the level of this feverish folly . He was beautiful — yes ! She could not bring herself to hate him ; she could not help the brimming tears blinding her eyes when she looked at him stretched senseless thus . But he was wedded to his past ; that toy in his breast , whatever it might be , whatever tale might cling to it , was sweeter to him than her lips would ever be . Bah ! there were better men than he ; why had she not let him lie and die as he might under the pile of dead ? Bah ! she could have killed herself for her folly ! She , who had scores of lovers , from princes to piou - pious , and never had a heart - ache for one of them , to go and care for a silent "
203215	203234	203241	203241	you	4809	" who had never even noticed that her eyes had any brightness or her face had any charm ! "
203243	203277	203281	203283	Chasse - Marais	923	" said Cigarette , fiercely abusing herself as she put his head off her lap , and rose abruptly and shouted to a Tringlo who was at some distance searching for the wounded . "
203290	203323	203357	203357	He	4810	" she said , curtly , as the man with his mule - cart and its sad burden of half - dead , moaning , writhing frames drew near at her summons . "
203355	203356	203357	203357	He	4810	" "
203362	203372	203434	203434	they	7862	" said the Tringlo . She shrugged her shoulders . "
203437	203610	203615	203615	I	0	" Cigarette glanced over the field with the satisfied appreciation of a connoisseur glancing over a Soltykoff or Blacas collection unimpeachable for accuracy and arrangement ; and drank a toss of her brandy , and lighted her little amber pipe , and sang loudly as she did so the gayest ballad of the Langue Verte . She was not going to have him imagine she cared for that Chasseur whom he lifted up on his little waggon with so kindly a care — not she ! Cigarette was as proud in her way as was ever the Princess Venetia Corona . Nevertheless , she kept pace with the mules , carrying little Flick - Flack , and never paused on her way , though she passed scores of dead Arabs , whose silver ornaments and silk broideries commonly after such a fantasia replenished the knapsack and adorned in profusion the uniform of the young filibuster , being gleaned by her , right and left , as her lawful harvest after the fray . "
203623	203808	203615	203615	I	0	" she said , at the first empty tent they reached : the camp had been the scene of as fierce a struggle as the part of the plain which the cavalry had held , and it was strewn with the slaughter of Zouaves and Tirailleurs . The Tringlo obeyed her , and went about his errand of mercy . Cigarette , left alone with the wounded man , lying insensible still on a heap of forage , ceased her song , and grew very quiet . She had a certain surgical skill , learnt as her untutored genius learned most things , with marvellous rapidity , by observation and intuition ; and she had saved many a life by her knowledge and her patient attendance on the sufferers — patience that she had been famed for when she had been only six years old , and a surgeon of the Algerian regiments had affirmed that he could trust her to be as wakeful , as watchful , and as sure to obey his directions as though she were a Soeur de Charité . Now "
203815	204014	204498	204498	He	4819	" as Cecil had called her , put this skill into active use . The tent had been a scullion 's tent ; the poor marmiton had been killed , and lay outside , with his head clean - severed by an Arab flissa ; his fire had gone out , but his brass pots and pans , his jar of fresh water , and his various preparations for the General 's dinner , were still there . The General was dead also ; far yonder , where he had fallen in the van of his Zouaves , exposing himself with all the splendid reckless gallantry of France ; and the soup stood unserved , the wild plovers were taken by Flick - Flack , the empty dishes waited for the viands which there were no hands to prepare and no mouths to eat . Cigarette glanced round , and saw all with one flash of her eyes ; then she knelt down beside the heap of forage , and , for the first thing , dressed his wounds with the cold , clear water , and washed away the dust and the blood that covered his chest . "
204031	204497	204503	204503	he	4819	" she said to herself , in a kind of self - apology . And as she did it , and bound the lance - gash close , and bathed his breast , his forehead , his hair , his beard , free from the sand , and the powder , and the gore , a thousand changes swept over her mobile face . It was one moment soft , and flushed , and tender as passion ; it was the next jealous , fiery , scornful , pale , and full of impatient self - disdain . He was nothing to her — morbleu ! He was an aristocrat , and she was a child of the people . She had been besieged by Dukes , and had flouted Princes ; she had borne herself in such gay liberty , such vivacious freedom , such proud and careless sovereignty — bah ! what was it to her whether this man lived or died ? If she saved him , he would give her a low bow as he thanked her , thinking all the while of Miladi ! And yet she went on with her work . Cecil had been stunned by a stroke from his horse 's hoof as the poor beast fell beneath and rolled over him . His wounds were slight — marvellously so for the thousand strokes that had been aimed at him ; but it was difficult to rouse him from unconsciousness , and his face was white as death where he lay on the heap of dry reeds and grasses . She began to feel fear of that lengthened syncope ; a chill , tight , despairing fear that she had never known in her life before . She knelt silent a moment , drawing through her hand the wet locks of his hair with the bright threads of gold gleaming in it . Then she started up , and , leaving him , found a match , and lighted the died - out wood afresh ; the fire soon blazed up , and she warmed above it the soup that had grown cold , poured into it some red wine that was near , and forced some , little by little , down his throat . It was with difficulty at first that she could pass any through his tightly - locked teeth ; but by degrees she succeeded , and , only half conscious still , he drank it faster , the heat and the strength reviving him as its stimulant warmed his veins . His eyes did not unclose , but he stirred , moved his limbs , and , with some muttered words she could not hear , drew a deeper breath and turned . "
204507	204653	205435	205435	they	4822	" she thought to herself while she stood watching him with a curious conflict of pity , impatience , anger , and relief at war within her . Bah ! Why was she always doing good service to this man , who only cared for the blue serene eyes of a woman who would never give him aught except pain ? Why should she take such care to keep the fire of vitality alight in him , when it had been crushed out in thousands as good as he , who would have no notice save a hasty thrust into the earth , no funeral chant except the screech of the carrion - birds ? Cigarette had been too successful in her rebellion against all weakness , and was far too fiery a young warrior to find refuge or consolation in the poet 's plea , "
204667	205125	205435	205435	they	4822	" To allow anything to gain ascendancy over her that she resisted , to succumb to any conqueror that was unbidden and unwelcome , was a submission beyond words degrading to the fearless soldier - code of the Friend of the Flag . And yet — there she stayed and watched him . She took some food , for she had been fasting all day ; then she dropped down before the fire she had lighted , and , in one of those soft , curled , kitten - like attitudes that were characteristic of her , kept her vigil over him . She was bruised , stiff , tired , longing like a tired child to fall asleep ; her eyes felt hot as flame , her rounded supple limbs were aching , her throat was sore with long thirst and the sand that she seemed to have swallowed till no draught of water or wine would take the scorched , dry pain out of it . But , as she had given up her fête - day in the hospital , so she sat now — as patient in the self - sacrifice as she was impatient when the vivacious agility of her young frame was longing for the frenzied delights of the dance or the battle . Yonder she knew , where her Spahis bivouacked on the hard - won field , there were riotous homage , wild applause , intoxicated triumph waiting for the Little One who had saved the day , if she chose to go out for it ; and she loved to be the centre of such adoration and rejoicing with all the exultant vanity of a child and a hero in one . Here there were warmth of flames , quietness of rest , long hours for slumber , all that her burning eyes and throbbing nerves were longing for , as the sleep she would not yield to stole on her , and the racking pain of fatigue cramped her bones . But she would not go to the pleasure without , and she would not give way to the weariness that tortured her . Cigarette could crucify self with a generous courage , all the purer because it never occurred to her that there was anything of virtue or of sacrifice in it . She was acting en bon soldat — that was all . Pouf ! that wanted no thanks . Silence settled over the camp ; half the slain could not be buried , and the clear luminous stars rose on the ghastly plateau . All that were heard were the challenge of sentinels , the tramp of patrols . The guard visited her once : "
205129	205412	205413	205413	I	0	" she said , briefly , and she was left undisturbed . She kept herself awake in the little dark tent , only lit by the glow of the fire . Dead men were just without , and in the moonlight without , as the night came on , she could see the severed throat of the scullion , and the head farther off , like a round grey stone . But that was nothing to Cigarette ; dead men were no more to her than dead trees are to others . Every now and then , four or five times in an hour , she gave him whom she tended the soup or the wine that she kept warmed for him over the embers . He took it without knowledge , sunk half in lethargy , half in sleep ; but it kept the life glowing in him which , without it , might have perished of cold and exhaustion as the chills and northerly wind of the evening succeeded to the heat of the day , and pierced through the canvas walls of the tent . It was very bitter ; more keenly felt because of the previous burning of the sun . There was no cloak or covering to fling over him ; she took off her blue cloth tunic and threw it across his chest , and , shivering despite herself , curled closer to the little fire . She did not know why she did it — he was nothing to her — and yet she kept herself wide awake through the dark autumn night , lest he should sigh or stir and she not hear him . "
205420	205428	205435	205435	they	4822	" she thought , looking at him ; "
205438	205492	205511	205511	you	4821	" He moved restlessly , and she went to him . His face was flushed now ; his breath came rapidly and shortly ; there was some fever on him . The linen was displaced from his wounds ; she dipped it again in water , and laid the cooled bands on them . "
205514	205538	205598	205598	Tiens	823	" she said in her teeth . He tossed wearily to and fro ; detached words caught her ear as he muttered them : "
205575	205597	205598	205598	Tiens	823	" She listened with intense anxiety to hear the other whispers ending the sentence , but they were stifled and broken . "
205600	205607	205613	205613	he	4821	" she murmured below her breath . "
205618	205747	205749	205749	I	0	" She could not catch the words that followed . They were in an unknown language to her , for she knew nothing of English , and they poured fast and obscure from his lips as he moved in feverish unrest ; the wine that had saved him from exhaustion inflaming his brain in his sleep . Now and then French phrases crossed the English ones ; she leaned down to seize their meaning till her cheek was against his forehead , till her lips touched his hair ; and at that half caress her heart beat , her face flushed , her mouth trembled with a too vivid joy , with an impulse , half fear and half longing , that had never so moved her before . "
205754	205762	205825	205825	She	4823	" he muttered in her own tongue . "
205804	205824	205830	205830	she	4823	" Cigarette started as if a knife had stabbed her , and sprang up from her rest beside him . "
205832	206156	206163	206163	He	4825	" she muttered fiercely , while her face grew duskily scarlet in the fire - glow of the tent ; and she went slowly away , back to the low wood fire . This was to be ever her reward ! Her eyes glistened and flashed with the fiery vengeful passions of her hot and jealous instincts . Cigarette had in her the violence as she had the nobility of a grand nature that has gone wholly untutored and unguided ; and she had the power of southern vengeance in her , though she had also the scant and rapid impulse to forgiveness of a generous and sunlit temper . It was bitter , beyond any other bitterness that could have wounded her , for the spoilt , victorious , imperious , little empress of the Army of Algeria to feel that , though she had given his life twice back to this man , she was less to him than the tiny white dog that nestled in his breast ; that she who never before had endured a slight , or known what neglect could mean , gave care , and pity , and aid , and even tenderness , to one whose only thought was for a woman who had accorded him nothing but a few chill syllables of haughty condescension ! He lay there unconscious of her presence , tossing wearily to and fro in fevered unrefreshing sleep , murmuring incoherent words of French and English strangely mingled ; and Cigarette crouched on the ground , with the fire - light playing all over her picturesque , child - like beauty , and her large eyes strained and savage , yet with a strange mistful pain in them , looking out at the moonlight where the headless body lay in a cold grey sea of shadow . Yet she did not leave him . She was too generous for that . "
206170	206802	206803	206803	He	4827	" she muttered , while she kept her vigil . She felt no want of sleep ; a hard hateful wakefulness seemed to have banished all rest from her ; she stayed there all the night through . Whenever she could ease or aid him she rose and did so , with the touch of water on his forehead , or of cooled wine to his lips , by the alteration of the linen on his wounds , or the shifting of the rough forage that made his bed . But she did it without anything of that loving lingering attendance she had given before ; she never once drew out the task longer than it needed , or let her hands wander among his hair , or over his lips , as she had done before . And he never once was conscious of it ; he never once knew that she was near . He did not waken from the painful , delirious , stupified slumber that had fallen on him ; he only vaguely felt that he was suffering pain ; he only vaguely dreamed of what he murmured of — his past , and the beauty of the woman who had brought all the memories of that past back on him . And this was Cigarette 's reward — to hear him mutter wearily of the proud eyes and of the lost smile of another ! The dawn came at last ; her constant care and the skill with which she had cooled and dressed his wounds had done him infinite service ; the fever had subsided , and towards morning his incoherent words ceased , his breathing grew calmer and more tranquil ; he fell asleep — sleep that was profound , dreamless , and refreshing . She looked at him with a tempestuous shadow darkening her face that yet was soft with a tenderness that she could not banish . She hated him ; she ought to have stabbed or shot him rather than have tended him thus ; he neglected her , and only thought of that woman of his old Order . As a daughter of the People , as a child of the Army , as a soldier of France , she ought to have killed him rather than have caressed his hair and soothed his pain ! Pshaw ! She ground one in another her tiny white teeth , that were like a spaniel 's . Then gently , very gently , lest she should waken him , she took her tunic skirt with which she had covered him from the chills of the night , put more broken wood on the fading fire , and with a last lingering look at him where he slept , passed out from the tent as the sun rose in a flushed and beautiful dawn . He would never know that she had saved him thus : he never should know it , she vowed in her heart . Cigarette was very haughty in her own wayward , careless fashion . At a word of love from him , at a kiss from his lips , at a prayer from his voice , she would have given herself to him in all the abandonment of a first passion , and have gloried in being known as his mistress . But she would have perished by a thousand deaths rather than have sought him through his pity or through his gratitude ; rather than have accepted the compassion of a heart that gave its warmth to another ; rather than have ever let him learn that he was any more to her than all their other countless comrades who filled up the hosts of Africa . "
206808	206937	206941	206941	you	4828	" she said to herself , as she passed through the disordered camp , and in a distant quarter coiled herself amongst the hay of a forage - waggon , and covered up in dry grass , like a bird in a nest , let her tired limbs lie and her aching eyes close in repose . She was very tired ; and every now and then as she slept a quick sobbing breath shook her as she slumbered , like a worn - out fawn who has been wounded whilst it played . With the réveillé and the full daybreak Cigarette woke , herself again ; she gave a little petulant shake to her fairy form when she thought of what folly she had been guilty of . "
206947	206954	206967	206969	a little fool	4831	" she said to herself afresh . "
206971	207007	206967	206969	a little fool	4831	" Love was all very well , so Cigarette 's philosophy had always reckoned ; a chocolate bonbon , a firework , a bagatelle , a draught of champagne , to flavour an idle moment . "
207011	207062	207344	207344	Georges	924	" she had always been accustomed to see worshipped together , as became their alliterative ; it was a bit of fun — that was all . A passion that had pain in it had never touched the Little One ; she had disdained it with lightest , airiest contumely . "
207119	207343	207344	207344	Georges	924	" she had said once , when arguing with an officer on the absurdity of a melancholy love that possessed him , and whose sadness she rallied most unmercifully . Now , for once in her young life , the Child of France found that it was remotely possible to meet with almonds so bitter that the taste will remain and taint all things , do what philosophy may to throw its acridity aside . With the réveillé she awoke , herself again , though she had not had more than an hour 's slumber — awoke , it is true , with a dull ache at her heart that was very new and bitterly unwelcome to her , but with the buoyant vivacity and the proud carelessness of her nature in arms against it , and with that gaiety of childhood inherent to her repelling , and very nearly successfully , the foreign depression that weighed on it . Her first thought was to take care that he should never learn what she had done for him . The Princess Corona would not have more utterly disdained to solicit regard through making a claim upon gratitude than the fiery little warrior of France would have done . She went straight to the Tringlo who had known her at her mission of mercy . "
207349	207369	207375	207375	Chasseur	663	" said the Little One , with that accent of authority which was as haughty as any General 's , "
207384	207385	207389	207390	ma belle	3221	" "
207392	207418	207435	207436	Ma belle	3221	" said the cheery little Tringlo , who was hard pressed ; for there was much to be done , and he was very busy . "
207428	207434	207468	207468	Spahis	659	" Georges lifted his eyebrows : "
207474	207475	207503	207503	I	0	" "
207509	207510	207503	207503	I	0	" "
207518	207519	207536	207536	They	4840	" "
207525	207535	207557	207557	I	0	" said Cigarette , with her most imperious emphasis . "
207570	207587	207557	207557	I	0	" The Tringlo chuckled ; he was an Anglophobist . In the Chinese expedition his share of "
207589	207626	207641	207641	I	0	" had been robbed from him by a trick of which two English soldiers had been the concocters , and a vehement animosity against the whole British race had been the fruit of it in him . "
207633	207640	207703	207703	they	285	" he answered her , heartily . "
207706	207721	207731	207732	that man	3064	" he added , dubiously , but with an impressive air of strictest impartiality , "
207742	207774	207731	207732	that man	3064	" and M. Georges hurried away to his mules and his duties , thinking with loving regret of the delicious Chinese plunder of which the dogs of Albion had deprived him . "
207779	207940	207975	207975	We	4849	" thought Cigarette ; of the patrol who had seen her she was not afraid — he had never noticed with whom she was when he had put his head into the scullion 's tent ; and she made her way towards the place where she had left him , to see how it went with this man whom she was so careful should never know that which he had owed to her . It went well with him , thanks to her ; care , and strengthening nourishment , and the skill of her tendance , had warded off all danger from his wound . The bruise and pressure from the weight of the horse had been more ominous , and he could not raise himself or even breathe without severe pain ; but his fever had left him , and he had just been lifted into a mule - drawn ambulance - waggon as Cigarette reached the spot . "
207979	208001	207975	207975	We	4849	" she cried gaily to him ; then her voice dropped suddenly , with an indescribable sweetness and change of tone . "
208006	208055	208119	208119	They	4851	" she asked , softly . Coming close up to where he lay on the straw , she saw the exhausted languor of his regard , the heavy darkness under his eyelids , the effort with which his lips moved as the faint words came broken through them . "
208097	208118	208119	208119	They	4851	" Cigarette swayed herself upon the wheel and leaned towards him , touching and changing his bandages with clever hands : "
208131	208132	208167	208167	I	0	" "
208158	208159	208171	208171	they	4851	" "
208180	208181	208189	208189	We	4853	" "
208192	208461	208462	208462	Your	4854	" She did not stay for the conclusion of his sentence ; she had darted off , quick as a swallow . She knew what she had left in her dead scullion 's tent . Everything was in confusion , as he had said . Of the few hundreds that had been left after the terrific onslaught of the past day , some were employed far out , thrusting their own dead into the soil ; others were removing the tents and all the equipage of the camp ; others were busied with the wounded , of whom the greatest sufferers were to be borne to the nearest hospital ( that nearest many leagues away over the wild and barren country ) ; while those who were likely to be again soon ready for service were to be escorted to the head - quarters of the main army . Among the latter Cecil had passionately entreated to be numbered ; his prayer was granted to the man who had kept at the head of his Chasseurs and borne aloft the Tricolour through the whole of the war - tempest on which the dawn had risen , and which had barely lulled and sunk by the setting of the sun . Châteauroy was away with the other five of his squadrons ; and the Zouave chef de bataillon , the only officer of any rank who had come alive through the conflict , had himself visited Bertie , and given him warm words of eulogy , and even of gratitude , that had soldierly sincerity and cordiality in them . "
208467	208478	208189	208189	We	4853	" he had said , as he had turned away . "
208492	208529	208534	208534	I	0	" Cigarette was but a few seconds absent ; she soon bounded back like the swift little chamois she was , bringing with her a huge bowl full of red wine with bread broken in it . "
208538	208542	208562	208562	petite	3278	" she said ; "
208554	208555	208562	208562	petite	3278	" "
208564	208565	208575	208575	I	0	" "
208581	208603	208609	208609	I	0	" she answered him . ( She had only eaten a biscuit well - nigh as hard as a flint . ) "
208616	208703	208714	208714	I	0	" She perched herself on the wheel like a bird on a twig ; she had a bird 's power of alighting and sustaining herself on the most difficult and most airy elevation ; but Cecil turned his eyes on the only soldier in the cart beside himself , one of the worst men in his regiment — a murderous , sullen , black - browed , evil wretch , fitter for the bench of the convict - galley than for the ranks of the cavalry . "
208709	208713	208729	208729	Zackrist	926	" he said . "
208727	208728	208733	208754	the man who stole your lance and accoutrements , and got you into trouble by taking them to pawn in your name	4857	" "
208762	208763	208770	208770	He	926	" "
208777	208778	208811	208811	Vireflou	927	" "
208824	208825	208811	208811	Vireflou	927	" "
208834	208835	208811	208811	Vireflou	927	" "
208847	208848	208860	208860	Zackrist	926	" "
208864	208944	208966	208966	you	0	" He took the bowl from her hands , and emptying a little of it into the wooden bidon that hung to her belt , kept that for himself , and stretching his arm across the straw , gave the bowl to Zackrist , who had watched it with the longing ravenous eyes of a starving wolf , and seized it with rabid avidity . A smile passed over Cecil 's face , amused despite the pain he suffered . "
208971	208972	208966	208966	you	0	" "
208980	209015	209025	209025	He	926	" said Cigarette , who , between her admiration for the action and her impatience at the waste of her good bread and wine , hardly knew whether to applaud or to deride him . "
209035	209036	209048	209048	he	926	" "
209065	209257	209048	209048	he	926	" he answered her , as he drank and ate his portion , with a need of it that could willingly have made him take thrice as much , though for the sake of Zackrist he had denied his want of it . The Zackrist himself , who could hear perfectly what was said , uttered no word ; but when he had finished the contents of the bowl , lay looking at his corporal with an odd gleam in the dark sullen savage depths of his hollow eyes . He was not going to say a word of thanks ; no!—none had ever heard a grateful or a decent word from him in his life ; he was proud of that . He was the most foul - mouthed brute in the army , and , like Snake in the School for Scandal , thought a good action would have ruined his character for ever . Nevertheless , there came into his cunning and ferocious eyes a glisten of the same light which had been in the little gamin 's when first by the bivouac - fire he had murmured , "
209262	209263	209275	209275	I	0	" "
209270	209274	209275	209275	I	0	" muttered Cigarette , "
209279	209280	209298	209298	you	0	" "
209307	209308	209319	209319	I	0	" "
209317	209318	209411	209411	I	0	" "
209338	209410	209418	209419	my Spahis	3246	" Cigarette shrugged her shoulders in silence ; then poising herself on the wheel , she sprang from thence on to the back of her little mare which she had brought up , having the reins in one of her hands and the wine - bowl in the other ; the animal had not had a scratch in the battle , and was fresh and bright after the night 's repose . "
209421	210143	210256	210256	Dame	930	" she said , as a young queen might have promised protection from her escort . He thanked her , and sank back among the straw , exhausted and worn out with pain and with languor ; the weight that seemed to oppress his chest was almost as hard to bear as when the actual pressure of his dead charger 's body had been on him . Yet , as he had said , it was but a bagatelle beside the all but mortal wounds , the agonising neuralgia , the prostrating fever , the torture of bullet - torn nerves , and the scorching fire of inflamed sword - wounds , that had in their turn been borne by him in his twelve years of African service — things which , to men who have never suffered them , sound like the romanced horrors of an exaggerated imagination ; yet things which are daily and quietly borne , by such soldiers as the soldiers of the Algerian Army , as the natural accompaniments of a military life — borne , too , in brave simple unconscious heroism by men who know well that the only reward for it will be their own self - contentment at having been true to the traditions of their regiment . Four other troopers were placed on the straw beside him , and the mule - carts with their mournful loads rolled slowly out of camp eastward towards the quarters of the main army ; the Spahis , glowing red against the sun , escorting them , with their darling in their midst , while from their deep chests they shouted war - songs in Sabir with all the wild and riotous delight that the triumph of victory and the glow of bloodshed roused in those who combined in them the fire of France and the fanaticism of Islamism — an irresistible union . Though the nights were now cold , and before long even the advent of snow might be looked for , the days were hot and even scorching still . Cigarette and her Spahis took no heed of it ; they were desert born and bred ; and she was well - nigh invulnerable to heat as any little salamander . But , although they were screened as well as they could be under an improvised awning , the wounded men suffered terribly . Gnats and mosquitoes and all the winged things of the African air tormented them , and tossing on the dry hot straw they grew delirious , some falling asleep and murmuring incoherently , others lying with wide open eyes of half - senseless straining misery . Cigarette had known well how it would be with them ; she had accompanied such escorts many a time ; and ever and again when they halted she dismounted and came to them , and mixed wine with some water that she had slung a barrel of to her saddle , and gave it to them , and moved their bandages , and spoke to them with a soft caressing consolation that pacified them as if by some magic . She had led them like a young lion on to the slaughter in the past day ; she soothed them now with a gentleness that the gentlest daughter of the Church could not have surpassed . The way was long ; the road ill formed , leading for the most part across a sear and desolate country , with nothing to relieve its barrenness except long stretches of the great spear - headed reeds . At noon the heat was intense ; the little cavalcade halted for half an hour under the shade of some black towering rocks which broke the monotony of the district , and commenced a more hilly and more picturesque portion of the country . Cigarette came to the side of the temporary ambulance in which Cecil was placed . He was asleep — sleeping for once peacefully with little trace of pain upon his features , as he had slept the previous night . She saw that his face and chest had not been touched by the stinging insect - swarm ; he was doubly screened by a shirt hung above him dexterously on some bent sticks . "
210149	210255	210265	210265	he	4866	" thought Cigarette . As she glanced round she saw:—without any linen to cover him , Zackrist had reared himself up and leaned slightly forward over against his comrade . The shirt that protected Cecil was his ; and on his own bare shoulders and mighty chest the tiny armies of the flies and gnats were fastened , doing their will uninterrupted . As he caught her glance , a sullen ruddy glow of shame shone through the black hard skin of his sunburnt visage — shame to which he had been never touched when discovered in any one of his guilty and barbarous actions . "
210258	210264	210324	210324	I	0	" he growled , savagely ; "
210322	210323	210451	210451	Tiens	823	" "
210360	210450	210455	210455	I	0	" She knew too well the strange nature with which she had to deal to say a syllable of praise to him for his self - devotion , or to appear to see that , despite his boast of his leather skin , the stings of the cruel winged tribes were drawing his blood and causing him alike pain and irritation which , under that sun , and added to the torment of his gunshot - wound , were a martyrdom as great as the noblest saint ever endured . "
210460	210464	210612	210612	You	4876	" murmured Cigarette . "
210502	210611	210612	210612	You	4876	" And all through the march she gave Zackrist a double portion of her water dashed with red wine , that was so welcome and so precious to the parched and aching throats ; and all through the march Cecil lay asleep , and the man who had thieved from him , the man whose soul was stained with murder and pillage and rapine , sat erect beside him , letting the insects suck his veins and pierce his flesh . It was only when they drew near the camp of the main army that Zackrist beat off the swarm and drew his old shirt over his head . "
210622	210628	210677	210677	Dieu	829	" he muttered to Cigarette . "
210643	210676	210677	210677	Dieu	829	" She nodded ; she understood him . Yet his shoulders and his chest were well - nigh flayed , despite the tough and horny skin of which he made his boast . "
210683	210687	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" mused Cigarette . "
210766	210826	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" And she dashed the spurs into her mare and galloped off at the height of her speed into camp — a very city of canvas , buzzing with the hum of life , regulated with the marvellous skill and precision of French warfare , yet with the carelessness and the picturesqueness of the desert - life pervading it . "
210831	211432	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" ran from mouth to mouth as the bay mare with her little Amazon rider , followed by the scarlet cloud of the Spahis , all a - blaze like poppies in the sun , rose in sight , thrown out against the azure of the skies . What she had done had been told long before by an orderly , riding hard in the early night to take the news of the battle ; and the whole host was on watch for its darling — the saviour of the honour of France . Like wave rushing on wave of some tempestuous ocean , the men swept out to meet her in one great surging tide of life , impetuous , passionate , idolatrous , exultant , with all the vivid ardour , all the uncontrolled emotion , of natures south - born , sun - nurtured . They broke away from their mid - day rest as from their military toil , moved as by one swift breath of fire , and flung themselves out to meet her , the chorus of a thousand voices ringing in deafening vivas to the skies . She was enveloped in that vast sea of eager furious lives , in that dizzy tumult of vociferous cries , and stretching hands , and upturned faces . As her soldiers had done the night before , so these did now — kissing her hands , her dress , her feet , sending her name in thunder through the sunlit air , lifting her from off her horse , and bearing her , in a score of stalwart arms , triumphant in their midst . She was theirs — their own — the Child of the Army , the Little One whose voice above their dying brethren had the sweetness of an angel 's song , and whose feet , in their hours of revelry , flew like the swift and dazzling flight of gold - winged orioles . And she had saved the honour of their Eagles ; she had given to them and to France their god of Victory . They loved her — O God , how they loved her!—with that intense , breathless , intoxicating love of a multitude which , though it may stone to - morrow what it adores to - day , has yet for those on whom it has once been given thus a power no other love can know — a passion unutterably sad , deliriously strong . That passion moved her strangely . As she looked down upon them , she knew that not one man breathed amongst that vast tumultuous mass but would have died that moment at her word ; not one mouth moved amongst that countless host but breathed her name in pride , and love , and honour . She might be a careless young coquette , a awless little brigand , a child of sunny caprices , an elf of dauntless mischief ; but she was more than these . The divine fire of genius had touched her , and Cigarette would have perished for her country not less surely than Jeanne d'Arc . The holiness of an impersonal love , the glow of an imperishable patriotism , the melancholy of a passionate pity for the concrete and unnumbered sufferings of the people were in her , instinctive and inborn , as fragrance in the heart of flowers . And all these together moved her now , and made her young face beautiful as she looked down upon the crowding soldiery . "
211437	211440	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" she answered them—"it
211449	211538	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" For France ! They shouted back the beloved word with tenfold joy ; and the great sea of life beneath her tossed to and fro in stormy triumph , in frantic paradise of victory , ringing her name with that of France upon the air , in thunder - shouts like spears of steel smiting on shields of bronze . But she stretched her hand out , and swept it backward to the desert - border of the south with a gesture that had awe for them . "
211541	211571	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" she said , softly , with an accent in her voice that hushed the riot of their rejoicing homage till it lulled like the lull in a storm . "
211588	211589	210760	210760	Dieu	829	" "
211595	211801	211850	211850	you	7311	" cried Cigarette , interrupting herself in her chant in honour of the attributes of war , as the Tringlo 's mules which she was driving some three weeks after the fray of Zarâila , stopped , by sheer force of old habit , in the middle of a green plateau on the outskirts of a camp pitched in its centre , and overlooked by brown rugged scarps of rock , stunted bushes on their summits , and here and there a maritime pine clinging to their naked slopes . At sight of the food - laden little beasts , and the well - known form behind them , the Tirailleurs , the Indigènes , and the Zouaves , on whose side of the encampment she had approached , rushed towards her with frantic shouts , and wild delight , and vehement hurrahs in a tempest of vociferous welcome that might have stunned any ears less used , and startled any nerves less steeled , to military life than the Friend of the Flag 's . She signed back the shouting disorderly crowd with her mule - whip as superbly as though she were a Marshal of France signing back a whole army 's mutiny . "
211853	211953	211850	211850	you	7311	" It was amusing to see how they minded her contemptuous orders ; how these black - bearded fire - eaters , the terror of the country , each one of whom could have crushed her in his grasp as a wolf crushes a lamb , slunk back , silenced and obedient , before the imperious bidding of the little vivandière . They had heeded her and let her rule over them almost as much when she had been seven years old , and her curls , now so dark , had been yellow as corn in the sun . "
211956	211962	212008	212008	I	0	" growled only one insubordinate , "
211988	212007	212077	212081	l '' épée mange vîte	4892	" The humiliated supplication of the reply appeased their autocratic sovereign . She nodded her head in ássent . "
212083	212188	212198	212198	Biribi	931	" Which was one of the impromptu proverbs that Cigarette was wo nt to manufacture and bring into her discourse with an air of authority as of one who quotes from profound scholastic lore . It was received with a howl of applause and of ratification . The entrails often gnaw with bitter pangs of famine in the Army of Algiers , and they knew well how sharp an edge hunger gives to the steel . Nevertheless , the sullen angry roar of famished men , that is so closely , so terribly , like the roar of wild beasts , did not cease . "
212193	212197	212206	212206	Biribi	931	" they growled . "
212210	212211	212206	212206	Biribi	931	" "
212214	212252	212321	212321	Biribi	931	" said Cigarette , laconically , with a crack of her mule - whip on to the arm of a Zouave who was attempting to make free with her convoy and purloin a loaf off the load . "
212259	212320	212321	212321	Biribi	931	" they roared in concert , a crowd of eager , wolfish , ravenous , impatient men , hungry as camp - fasting could make them , and half inclined even to tear their darling in pieces , since she kept them thus from the stores . Cigarette uncovered her head with a certain serious grace very rare in her . "
212328	212335	212405	212405	I	0	" Her assailants grew very quiet . "
212338	212404	212654	212654	Biribi	931	" they asked , briefly . Biribi was a Tringlo well beloved in all the battalions . Cigarette nodded , with a gesture outward to the solitary country . She was accustomed to these incidents of war ; she thought of them no more than a girl of civilised life thinks of the grouse or the partridges that are killed by her lovers and brothers . "
212652	212653	212654	212654	Biribi	931	" "
212660	212674	212930	212930	you	4912	" muttered the listening throng ; they forgot their hunger as they heard . "
212935	213004	212930	212930	you	4912	" There broke once more from the hearkening throng a roar that shook the echoes from the rocks ; but it was not now the rage of famished longing , but the rage of the lust for vengeance , and the grief of passionate hearts blent together . Quick as the lightning flashes , their swords leaped from their scabbards and shook in the sun - lightened air . "
213010	213138	213146	213147	some soldier	4917	" they shouted as with one throat , the hoarse cry rolling down the valley like a swell of thunder . If the bonds of discipline had loosed them , they would have rushed forth on the search and to the slaughter , forgetful of hunger , of heat , of sun - stroke , of self - pity , of all things save the dead Tringlo , whose only fear in death had been lest they should want and suffer through him . Their adjutants , alarmed by the tumult , hurried to the spot , fearing a bread - riot ; for the camp was far from supplies , and had been ill victualled for several days . They asked rapidly what was the matter . "
213139	213145	213146	213147	some soldier	4917	" Biribi has been killed , "
213150	213159	213146	213147	some soldier	4917	" Ah ! and the bread not come ? "
213160	213175	213188	213191	the Adjutant of Zouaves	4918	" Yes , mon adjutant ; the bread is there , and Cigarette too . "
213176	213186	213188	213191	the Adjutant of Zouaves	4918	" There is no need for me , then , "
213193	213201	213251	213251	She	861	" the Little One will keep order . "
213257	213362	213409	213410	a Zouave	8610	" We will avenge him . That is of course . The Flag of France never hangs idly when there is a brave life 's loss to be reckoned for ; I shall know again the cur that fled . Trust to me , and now be silent . You bawl out your oath of vengeance , oh yes ! But you bawled as loud a minute ago for bread . Biribi loved you better than you deserved . You deserve nothing ; you are hounds as ready to tear for offal to eat to rend the foe of your dead friend . Bah ! "
213401	213406	213409	213410	a Zouave	8610	" Sang de Dieu ? "
213412	213461	213467	213468	the orator	4924	" Hounds , indeed ! If it were any one but you ! When one has had nothing but a snatch of raw bullock 's meat , and a taste of coffee black with mud , for a week through , is one a hound because one hungers ? "
213462	213465	213493	213493	she	861	" No , "
213496	213756	214204	214228	a gentleman - painter who , travelling through the interior to get military sketches , had obtained permission to take up quarters in the camp	4951	" no , one is not a hound because one hungers ; but one is not a soldier if one complains . Well ! Biribi loved you ; and I am here to do his will , to do his work . He came laden ; his back was loaded heavier than the mules ' . To the front , all of you , as I name you ! Petit - Pot - de - Terre , there is your old mother 's letter . If she knew as much as I do about you , scapegrace , she would never trouble herself whether you were dead or alive ! Fagotin ! here is a bundle of Paris newspapers for you ; they are quite new — only nine months old ! Potélé ! some woman has sent you a love - scrawl and some tobacco ; I suppose she knew your passions all ended in smoke ! Rafle ! here is a little money come for you from France ; it has not been stolen , so it will have no spice for you ! Racoleur ! here is a poulet 46 from some simpleton , with a knife as a souvenir ; sharpen it on the Arbicos . Poupard , Loup - terrible , Jean Pagnote , Pince - Maille , Louis Magot , Jules Goupil — here ! There are your letters , your papers , your commissions . Biribi forgot nothing . As if you deserved to be worked for or thought of , sacripans ! "
214191	214202	214333	214334	The tourist	4953	" What heartless brutes ! Are they always like that ? "
214230	214245	214333	214334	The tourist	4953	" If they were not like that , they could not live a day , "
214255	214332	214424	214424	she	689	" Do you know what this service is , that you venture to judge them ? Men who meet death in the face every five minutes they breathe can not afford the space for sentimentalism which those who saunter at ease and in safety can do . They laugh when we are dead , perhaps , but they are true as steel to us while we live;—it is the reverse of the practice of the world ! "
214420	214423	214424	214424	she	689	" Dame ! "
214427	214444	215293	215296	a voice behind him	4984	" I could not have answered better myself ! He is a true soldier , that . "
215281	215291	215337	215337	He	430	" Beau Victor ! you took their parts well , "
215344	215363	215388	215391	the vivandière - Demosthenes	4985	" Not so well as your own clever tongue would have done . Words are not my weapons . "
215364	215386	215388	215391	the vivandière - Demosthenes	4985	" No ! You are as silent as the grave commonly ; but when you do speak , you speak well , "
215395	215445	215496	215496	Cecil	430	" I hate silence myself ! Thoughts are very good grain , but if they are not whirled round , round , round , and winnowed and ground in the millstones of talk , they keep little , hard , useless kernels , that not a soul can digest . "
215485	215494	215496	215496	Cecil	430	" Will your allegory hold good , petite ? "
215519	215555	215594	215594	she	4987	" I fancy speech is the chaff most generally , little better . So , they talk of you for the Cross ? No soldier ever , of a surety , more greatly deserved it . "
215588	215593	215594	215594	she	4987	" I did nothing , "
215599	215611	215684	215684	Cigarette	689	" Any man on the field would have done the same . "
215612	215683	215759	215759	she	4987	" That is easy to say ; not so easy to prove . In all great events there may be the same strength , courage , and desire to act greatly in those who follow as in the one that leads ; but it is only in that one that there is also the daring to originate , the genius to seize aright the moment of action and of success . "
215753	215758	215759	215759	she	4987	" It was nothing , "
215768	215777	215835	215835	he	4993	" I would die twenty deaths for France . "
215825	215834	215835	215835	he	4993	" You have a noble nature , Cigarette , "
215845	215854	216174	216174	Cigarette	689	" My poor child , if only — — "
215965	216172	216299	216299	Cecil	430	" Oh - hé ! Child , indeed ! Was I a child the other day , my good fellow , when I saved your squadron from being cut to pieces like grass with a scythe ? As for nobility ? Pouf ! Not much of that in me . I love France — yes . A soldier always loves his country . She is so brave , too , and so fair , and so riante , and so gay . Not like your Albion — if it is yours — who is a great gobemouche stuffed full of cotton , steaming with fog , clutching gold with one hand and the Bible with the other , that she may swell her money - bags , and seem a saint all the same ; never laughing , never learning , always growling , always shuffling , who is like this spider — look!—a tiny body and huge hairy legs — pull her legs , the Colonies , off , and leave her little English body , all shrivelled and shrunk alone , and I should like to know what size she would be then , and how she would manage to swell and to strut ? "
216303	216316	216322	216322	Cigarette	689	" You little Anglophobist ! You have the tongue of a Voltaire . "
216317	216320	216322	216322	Cigarette	689	" Voltaire ? "
216324	216373	216418	216418	Cigarette	689	" Voltaire . Let me see . I know that name . He was the man who championed Calas ? who had a fowl in the pot for every poor wretch that passed his house ? who was taken to the Panthéon by the people in the Revolution ? "
216374	216395	216418	216418	Cigarette	689	" Yes . And the man whom the wise world pretends still to call without a heart or a God ! "
216396	216416	216468	216468	she	689	" Chut ! He fed the poor , and freed the wronged . Better than pattering Paters , that ! "
216458	216467	216574	216574	she	689	" Go to the grandams and the children ! "
216570	216573	216574	216574	she	689	" Holà ! "
216585	216617	216753	216753	He	430	" We talk of Albion — there is one of her sons . I detest your country , but , ma foi ! I must confess she breeds uncommonly handsome men . "
216760	216778	216919	216919	his	5014	" He must not see me ! Keep him away — away , for God 's sake ! "
216931	216970	217085	217086	Cigarette mentally	689	" Your intendance is perfect ; your ambulance is perfect ; your camp - cookery is perfect , messieurs ; and here you have even perfect beauty too ! Truly , campaigning must be pleasant work in Algeria ! "
217074	217083	217340	217340	he	5014	" Parcequ ' j ' suis bien bête , "
217330	217339	217340	217340	he	5014	" O God , if I were dead ! "
217343	217350	217546	217550	those whom we love dead	5035	" they might know then — — "
217535	217540	217616	217616	they	5040	" I was guiltless . "
217611	217615	217709	217709	she	689	" A bientôt ! "
217714	217726	217762	217762	she	689	" Dieu ! how cold you are . He is gone . "
217755	217761	217762	217762	she	689	" Is he your enemy ? "
217765	217768	217788	217788	She	689	" No . "
217769	217773	217788	217788	She	689	" What then ? "
217774	217783	217788	217788	She	689	" The man I love best on earth . "
217784	217787	217793	217793	she	689	" Ah ! "
217806	217814	217788	217788	She	689	" He thinks you dead , then ? "
217815	217818	217788	217788	She	689	" Yes . "
217819	217826	217831	217831	He	5014	" And must always think so ? "
217827	217830	217838	217838	his	5014	" Yes . "
217857	217888	217974	217974	Cigarette	689	" Child , you are bold , generous , pitiful ; for God 's sake , get me sent out of this camp to - night . I am powerless . "
217967	217972	217974	217974	Cigarette	689	" I will try , "
217991	218002	217974	217974	Cigarette	689	" Go you to the fire ; you are cold . "
218003	218012	217974	217974	Cigarette	689	" Are you sure he will not return ? "
218013	218036	218043	218043	She	689	" Not he . They are gone to eat and drink ; I go with them . What is it you fear ? "
218037	218042	218199	218199	Cigarette	689	" My own weakness . "
218190	218197	218199	218199	Cigarette	689	" You are a fine soldier , "
218203	218210	218255	218255	He	5014	" such men are not weak . "
218211	218254	218357	218357	He	5014	" Why ? We are only strong as tigers are strong — just the strength of the talon and fang . I do not know . I was weak as water once ; I may be again , if — if — — "
218367	218409	218418	218418	her	689	" You have surprised my folly from me ; you know my secret so far ; but you are too brave to betray me , you are too generous to tell of this ? I can trust you to be silent ? "
218432	218452	218501	218501	he	5057	" Monsieur , that question from one soldier of France to another is insult . We are not dastards ! "
218511	218546	218566	218566	Cigarette	689	" Forgive me , my child ; I should not have wronged you with the question . It is needless , I know . Men can trust you to the death , they say . "
218547	218554	218586	218586	he	5057	" To the death — yes . "
218591	218643	218655	218655	she	689	" You have ingenuity , compassion , tact ; you have power here , too , in your way ; for the love of Heaven get me sent out on some duty before dawn ! There is Biribi 's murder to be avenged — would they give the errand to me ? "
218649	218654	218655	218655	she	689	" We will see , "
218660	218685	218717	218717	Cigarette	689	" I think I can do it . But go back , or you will be missed . I will come to you soon . "
218704	218715	218852	218852	she	689	" Que je suis bête ! Que je suis bête ! "
218840	218851	219158	219158	he	430	" Que je suis bête ! Que je suis bête ! "
219137	219157	219158	219158	he	430	" He said once that he would take my hand before all the world always , come what would , "
219161	219179	219259	219259	he	430	" Would he take it now , I wonder ? Yes ; he never believed against me . "
219252	219258	219259	219259	he	430	" How weak I am ! "
219264	219365	219623	219623	she	2338	" What does it matter ? Life is so short , one is coward indeed to fret over it . I can not undo what I did . I can not , if I would . To betray him now ! God ! not for a kingdom , if I had the chance ! Besides , she may live still ; and , even were she dead , to tarnish her name to clear my own would be a scoundrel 's baseness — baseness that would fail as it merited ; for who could be brought to believe me now ? "
219614	219622	219623	219623	she	2338	" Hark ! I have done it , "
219628	219647	219623	219623	she	2338	" But it will be an errand very close to death , that you must go on — — "
219655	219669	219681	219681	Cigarette	689	" No matter that ! Ah , Mademoiselle , how I thank you ! "
219670	219679	219681	219681	Cigarette	689	" Chut ! I am no Paris demoiselle ! "
219691	220074	219681	219681	Cigarette	689	" Ceremony in a camp — pouf ! You must have been a Court Chamberlain once , were n't you ? Well , I have done it . Your officers were talking yonder of a delicate business ; they were uncertain who best to employ . I put in my speech — it was dead against military etiquette , but I did it — I said to M. le Général : ' You want the best rider , the most silent tongue , and the surest steel in the squadrons ? Take Bel - àfaire - peur , then ? ' ' Who is that ? ' asked the General ; he would have sent out of camp anybody but Cigarette for the interruption . ' Mon Général , ' said I , ' the Arabs asked that , too , the other day at Zarâila . ' ' What ! ' he cried , ' the man Victor — who held the ground with his Chasseurs ? I know — a fine soldier . M. le Colonel , shall we send him ? ' The Black Hawk had scowled thunder on you ; he hates you more still since that affair of Zarâila , specially , because the General has reported your conduct with such praise that they can not help but promote you . Well , he had looked thunder , but now he laughed . ' Yes , mon Général , ' he answered him , ' take him , if you like . It is fifty to one whoever goes on that business will not come back alive , and you will rid me of the most insolent fine gentleman in my squadrons . ' The General hardly heard him ; he was deep in thought ; but he asked a good deal about you from the Hawk , and Châteauroy spoke for your fitness for the errand they are going to send you on , very truthfully , for a wonder . I do n't know why ; but he wants you to be sent , I think ; most likely that you may be cut to pieces . And so they will send for you in a minute . I have done it as you wished , "
220081	220171	220187	220187	You	5073	" There was something of her old brusquerie and recklessness in the closing sentences ; but it had not her customary débonnair lightness . She knew too well that the chances were as a hundred to one that he would never return alive from this service on which he had entreated to be despatched . Cecil grasped both her hands in his with warm gratitude , that was still , like the touch of his hands , the gratitude of comrade to comrade , not of man to woman . "
220195	220196	220201	220201	I	0	" "
220207	220223	220321	220322	a man	1118	" said the Little One , something pettishly . She would have preferred another epithet . "
220324	220325	220327	220328	a woman	1012	" "
220335	220341	220389	220390	my child	7326	" Cigarette shrugged her shoulders . "
220381	220382	220419	220419	Heaven	952	" "
220426	220435	220481	220481	your	5073	" She drew her hands away from him . "
220484	220559	220615	220615	Rake	399	" The orderly so nicknamed approached , and brought the bidding of the General in command of the Cavalry for Cecil to render himself at once to his presence . These things brook no second 's delay in obedience ; he went with a quick adieu to Cigarette , and the little Friend of the Flag was left in his vacant place beside the fire . And there was a pang at her heart . "
220569	220614	220615	220615	Rake	399	" she thought . But Cigarette , volage little mischief though she was , could reach very high in one thing ; she could reach a love that was unselfish , and one that was heroic . A few moments , and Cecil returned . "
220617	220629	220692	220692	My	0	" he said rapidly , in the French he habitually used , "
220649	220691	220724	220724	its	5088	" Rake , in paradise , and the envied of every man in the squadrons , turned to his work — with him a task of scarce more than a second ; and Cecil approached his little Friend of the Flag . "
220721	220722	220724	220724	its	5088	" "
220733	220751	220765	220765	you	399	" said Cigarette brusquely — the more brusquely because that new and bitter pang was on her . "
220761	220762	220809	220809	I	0	" "
220812	220889	220906	220906	you	0	" He put into her hand the ring she had seen in the little bonbonnière ; a ring of his mother 's that he had saved when he had parted with all else , and that he had put off his hand and into the box of Petite Reine 's gift the day he had entered the Algerian army . Cigarette flushed scarlet with passions he could not understand , and she could not have disentangled . "
220914	220915	220906	220906	you	0	" "
220923	220929	220931	220931	I	0	" he answered her simply . "
220938	220986	221022	221022	You	0	" She lost all her hot colour , and all her fiery wrath ; his grave and gentle courtesy always strangely stilled and rebuked her ; but she raised the ring off the ground where she had flung it , and placed it back in his hand . "
221020	221021	221403	221403	We	5094	" "
221044	221402	221403	221403	We	5094	" He stooped and kissed her ; a kiss that the lips of a man will always give to the bright youthful lips of a woman , but a kiss , as she knew well , without passion , even without tenderness in it . With a sudden impetuous movement , with a shyness and a refusal that had never been in her before , she wrested herself from him , her face burning , her heart panting , and plunged away from him into the depth of the shadow ; and he never sought to follow her , but threw himself into saddle as his grey was brought up : another instant , and , armed to the teeth , he rode out of the camp into the darkness of the silent , melancholy , lonely Arab night . The errand on which he went was one , as he was well aware , from which it were a thousand chances to one that he ever issued alive . It was to reach a distant branch of the Army of Occupation with despatches for the chef in command there , and to do this he had to pass through a fiercely hostile region , occupied by Arabs with whom no sort of peace had ever been made , the most savage as well as the most predatory of the wandering tribes . His knowledge of their tongue , and his friendship with some men of their nation , would avail him nothing here ; for their fury against the Franks was intense , and it was said that all prisoners who had fallen into their hands had been put to death with merciless barbarities . This might be true or untrue ; wild tales were common among Algerian campaigners ; whichever it were , he thought little of it as he rode out on to the lonely plains . Every kind of hazardous adventure and every variety of peril had been familiar with him in this African life ; and now there were thoughts and memories on him which deadened every recollection of merely physical risk . "
221419	221440	221444	221444	sir	6134	" were the only words he exchanged with Rake , as he loosened his grey to a hand - gallop . "
221446	221555	221444	221444	sir	6134	" answered the trooper , whose warm blood was dancing , and whose blue eyes were alive like fire with delight . That he had been absent on a far - away foraging raid on the day of Zarâila had been nothing short of agony to Rake , and the choice made of him for this duty was to him a gift of paradise . He loved fighting for fighting 's sake ; and to be beside Cecil was the greatest happiness life held for him . They had two hundred miles to traverse , and had received only the command he had passed on Rake , to ride "
221563	222171	222173	222173	you	5096	" To the hero of Zarâila the General had felt too much soldierly sympathy to add the superfluous injunction to do his uttermost to carry safely and successfully to their destination the papers that were placed in his sabretasche . They knew well that the errand would be done , or the Chasseur 's main de femme , mais main de fer , would be stiffened and nerveless in death . It was just nightfall ; the after - glow had faded only a few moments before . Giving their horses , which they were to change once ten hours for the distance , and two for bait and for rest , he reckoned that they would reach the camp before the noon of the coming day , as the beasts , fresh and fast in the camp , flew like greyhounds beneath them . Another night - ride that they had ridden together came to the minds of both ; but they spoke not a word as they swept on , their sabres shaken loose in their sheaths , their lances well gripped , and the pistols with which they had been supplied sprung in their belts ready for instant action if a call should come for it . Every rood of the way was as full of unseen danger as if laid over mines . They might pass in safety ; they might any moment be cut down by ten score against two . From every hanging scarp of rugged rock a storm of musket - balls might pour ; from every screen of wild - fig foliage a shower of lances might whistle through the air ; from every darkling grove of fir - trees an Arab band might spring and swoop on them;—but the knowledge scarcely recurred to the one save to make him shake his sword more at loose for quick disengagement , and only made the sunny blue eyes of the other sparkle with a vivid and longing zest . The night grew very chill as it wore on ; the north wind rose , rushing against them with a force and icy touch that seemed to freeze their bones to the marrow after the heat of the day and the sun that had scorched them so long . There was no regular road ; they went across the country , their way sometimes leading over level land , over which they swept like lightning , great plains succeeding one another with wearisome monotony ; sometimes , on the contrary , lying through ravines , and defiles , and gloomy woods , and broken hilly spaces , where rent bare rocks were thrown on one another in gigantic confusion , and the fantastic shapes of the wild fig and the dwarf palm gathered a hideous grotesqueness in the darkness . For there was no moon , and the stars were often hidden by the storm - rack of leaden clouds that drifted over the sky ; and the only sound they heard was the cry of the jackal , or the shriek of the night - bird , and now and then the sound of shallow watercourses , where the parched beds of hidden brooks had been filled by the autumnal rain . The first five - and - twenty miles passed without interruption , and the horses laid well and warmly to their work . They halted to rest and bait the beasts in a rocky hollow , sheltered from the blasts of the bise , and green with short sweet grass , sprung up afresh after the summer drought . "
222181	222204	222173	222173	you	5096	" said Rake , softly , with a lingering love in his voice , as he stroked the greys and tethered them . "
222208	222209	222235	222235	him	5097	" "
222231	222232	222243	222243	Rake	399	" "
222245	222246	222243	222243	Rake	399	" "
222258	222259	222265	222265	You	5096	" "
222269	222270	222275	222275	I	0	" "
222278	222284	222313	222314	Mr. Berk	955	" said Rake , slowly . "
222320	222391	222313	222314	Mr. Berk	955	" Rake had longed and pined for an opportunity to dare say this thing which he had learned , and which he could not tell whether or no Cecil knew likewise . His eyes looked with straining eagerness through the gloom into his master 's ; he was uncertain how his words would be taken . To his bitter disappointment , Cecil 's face showed no change , no wonder . "
222397	222423	222443	222443	He	955	" he said , calmly — as calmly as though the news had no bearing on his fortunes , but was some stranger 's history . "
222436	222442	222459	222459	he	955	" pleaded Rake , passionately . "
222455	222456	222462	222462	I	0	" "
222469	222470	222472	222472	he	955	" "
222478	222482	222505	222505	You	6134	" reiterated Rake . "
222503	222504	222508	222509	An outlaw	5111	" "
222520	222542	222579	222579	You	6134	" The man looked very wistfully at him ; all these years through he had never learned why his master was thus "
222544	222578	222579	222579	You	6134	" in Africa , and he had too loyal a love and faith ever to ask , or ever to doubt but that Cecil was the wronged and not the wrong - doer . "
222587	222591	222598	222598	you	6134	" he muttered . "
222601	222602	222638	222638	You	6134	" "
222625	222637	222638	222638	You	6134	" Rake crushed bitter oaths into muttered words as he heard . "
222656	222657	222772	222773	the king	6139	" "
222714	222771	222775	222775	his	6139	" Rake asked him no more : he had never had a harsh word from Cecil in their lives ; but he knew him too well for all that to venture to press on him a question thus firmly put aside . But his heart ached sorely for his master ; he would so gladly have seen "
222779	222947	222953	222953	Arabs	514	" and would have striven for the restoration as strenuously as ever a Cavalier strove for the White Rose ; and he sat in silence , perplexed and ill - satisfied , under the shelter of the rock , with the great , dim , desolate African landscape stretching before him , with here and there a gleam of light upon it when the wind swept the clouds apart . His volatile speech was chilled , and his buoyant spirits were checked . That Cecil was justly outlawed he would have thought it the foulest treason to believe for one instant ; yet he felt that he might as soon seek to wrench up the great stones above him from their base as seek to change the resolution of this man , whom he had once known pliant as a reed and careless as a child . They were before long in saddle again and off , the country growing wilder at each stride the horses took . "
222960	222972	223001	223001	they	514	" said Cecil , as he settled himself in his saddle . "
223021	223022	223001	223001	they	514	" "
223028	223040	223051	223051	I	0	" said Rake , obediently ; but he thought to himself , "
223054	223683	223051	223051	I	0	" And away they went once more , in speed and in silence , the darkness of full night closing in on them , the skies being black with the heavy drift of rising storm - clouds . Meantime Cigarette was feasting with the officers of his regiment . The dinner was the best that the camp - scullions could furnish in honour of the two or three illustrious tourists who were on a visit to the head - quarters of the Algerian Army ; and the Little One , the heroine of Zarâila , and the toast of every mess throughout Algeria , was as indispensable as the champagnes . Not that she was altogether herself to - night ; she was feverish , she was bitter , she was full of stinging ironies ; but that delicious gaiety , like a kitten 's play , was gone from her , and its place , for the first time in her life , was supplied by unreal and hectic excitation . In truth , whilst she laughed , and coquetted , and fenced with the bright two - edged blade of her wit , and tossed down the wines into her little throat like a trooper , she was thinking nothing at all of what was around her , and very little of what she said or she did . She was thinking of the starless night out yonder , of the bleak arid country , of the great , dim , measureless plains ; of one who was passing through them all , and one who might never return . It was the first time that the absent had ever troubled her present ; it was the first time that ever this foolish , senseless , haunting , unconquerable fear for another had approached her : fear!—she had never known it for herself , why should she feel it now for him?—a man whose lips had touched her own as lightly , as indifferently , as they might have touched the leaves of a rose or the curls of a dog ! She felt her face burn with the flush of a keen , unbearable , passionate shame . Men by the score had wooed her love , to be flouted with the insouciant mischief of her coquetry , and forgotten to - morrow if they were shot to - day ; and now he — he whose careless , calm caress would make her heart vibrate and her limbs tremble with an emotion she had never known — he valued her love so little that he never even knew that he had roused it ! To the proud young warrior of France a greater degradation , a deadlier humiliation , than this could not have come to her . Yet she was true as steel to him ; true with the strong and loyal fealty that is inborn with such natures as hers . To have betrayed what he had trusted to her , because she was neglected and wounded by him , would have been a feminine baseness of which the soldier - like soul of Cigarette would have been totally incapable . Her revenge might be fierce , and rapid , and sure , like the revenge of a soldier ; but it could never be stealing and traitorous , and never like the revenge of a woman . Not a word escaped her that could have given a clue to the secret with which he had involuntarily weighted her ; she only studied with interest and keenness the face and the words of this man whom he had loved , and from whom he had fled as criminals flee from their accusers . "
223689	223722	223728	223728	Seraph	454	" she asked him , curtly , in one of the pauses of the amorous and witty nonsense that circulated in the tent in which the officers of Chasseurs were entertaining him . "
223730	223731	223760	223760	Lyonnesse	455	" "
223758	223759	223760	223760	Lyonnesse	455	" "
223762	223763	223775	223776	A soldier	6748	" "
223773	223774	223775	223776	A soldier	6748	" "
223778	223779	223787	223790	A Colonel of Guards	5127	" "

223792	223816	223817	223817	He	5128	" Cigarette gave a little whistle to herself ; she remembered that a Marshal of France had once said of a certain Chasseur , "
223826	223827	223832	223834	M. le Duc	832	" "
223842	223859	223931	223931	you	0	" cried one of the officers . Cigarette interrupted him with a toss of her head . "
223939	223940	223966	223966	aristocrats	4355	" "
223956	223961	224032	224034	A fine fellow	8402	" laughed her interlocutor . "
223987	224031	224032	224034	A fine fellow	8402	" He had turned as he spoke to one of the officers , who answered him in the affirmative ; while Cigarette listened with all her curiosity and all her interest , that needed a deeper name , heightened and tight - strung . "
224036	224047	224094	224094	you	5144	" continued the Chef d'Escadron to whom he had appealed . "
224099	224100	224137	224137	monsieur	3031	" "
224132	224133	224171	224171	she	689	" "

224192	224212	224236	224236	him	8402	" cried Cigarette , stung into instant irony because pained and irritated by being appealed to on the subject . "
224246	224286	224300	224300	He	5153	" Which effectually chastised the Chef d'Escadron , who was one of those who had a ton de garnison of the roughest , and piqued himself on his powers of fence much more than on his habits of delicacy . "
224293	224299	224305	224305	his	5153	" asked the English Duke . "
224312	224318	224336	224336	I	0	" said Cigarette , curtly . "
224331	224332	224362	224362	Ho	958	" "
224360	224361	224366	224366	Miladi	839	" "
224371	224384	224387	224387	she	5154	" Cigarette 's eyes flashed fire instantly , in wrath and suspicion . "
224399	224400	224423	224423	you	0	" "
224409	224421	224423	224423	you	0	" he answered , with something of surprise and of annoyance . "
224425	224432	224501	224501	he	5153	" said Cigarette , in derision . "
224516	224552	224619	224622	Madame la Princesse Corona	815	" The jealous , fiery impatience in her vanquished every other thought ; she was a child in much , she was untutored in all ; she had no thought that by her scornful vituperation of "
224554	224618	224630	224630	you	0	" she could either harm Cecil or betray herself . But she was amazed to see the English guest change colour with a haughty anger that he strove to subdue as he half rose and answered her with an accent in his voice that reminded her — she knew not why — of Bel - à - faire - peur and of Marquise . "
224642	224667	224815	224815	I	0	" Cigarette sprang to her feet , vivacious , imperious , reckless , dared to anything by the mere fact of being publicly arraigned . "
224760	224814	224815	224815	I	0	" The Englishman looked at her with astonishment that was mingled with a vivid sense of intense annoyance and irritated pride , that the name he cherished closest should be thus brought in , at a camp dinner , on the lips of a vivandière and in connexion with a trooper of Chasseurs . "
224824	224836	224844	224846	Madame Corona d'Amägué	815	" he said , with an impatient stroke to his beard . "
224851	224860	224888	224888	She	815	" he continued , to the officers present , "
224902	224903	224888	224888	She	815	" "
224908	224951	225205	225205	Cigarette	689	" cried the ringing voice of Cigarette , loud and startling as a bugle - note , while she stood like a little lioness , flushed with the draughts of champagne and with the warmth of wrath at once jealous and generous , "
225144	225203	225238	225241	A strange little Amazon	5181	" And Cigarette , having pronounced her defence and her eulogy with the vibrating eloquence of some orator from a tribune , threw her champagne goblet down with a crash , and , breaking through the arms outstretched to detain her , forced her way out despite them , and left her hosts alone in their lighted tent . "
225207	225237	225238	225241	A strange little Amazon	5181	" said the Chef d'Escadron , with a shrug of his shoulders , as of one who explained , by that sentence , a whole world of irreclaimable eccentricities . "
225243	225248	225276	225276	I	0	" said their guest . "
225268	225275	225289	225289	She	5181	" The Major shrugged his shoulders . "
225284	225288	225333	225333	she	5181	" answered one . "
225341	225440	227476	227476	Massena	712	" Their guest said little more on the subject ; in his own thoughts he was bitterly resentful that , by the mention of this Chasseur 's fortunes , he should have brought in the name he loved so well — the purest , fairest , haughtiest name in Europe — into a discussion with a vivandière at a camp dinner . Châteauroy , throughout , had said nothing ; he had listened in silence , the darkness lowering still more heavily upon his swarthy features ; only now he opened his lips for a few brief words : "
225486	227475	227476	227476	Massena	712	" His guest nodded , and changed the subject ; his impatience and aversion at the introduction of his sister 's name into the discussion made him drop the theme unpursued , and let it die out forgotten . Venetia Corona associated with an Algerian trooper ! If Cigarette had been of his own sex , he could have dashed the white teeth down her throat for having spoken of the two in one breath . And as , later on , he stretched his gallant limbs out on his narrow camp palliasse , tired with a long day in saddle under the hot African sun , the Seraph fell asleep with his right arm under his handsome golden head , and thought no more of this unknown French sabreur . But Cigarette remained wakeful . She lay curled up in the straw against her pet horse , Etoile - Filante , with her head on the beast 's glossy flank and her hand amongst his mane . She often slept thus in camp , and the horse would lie still and cramped for hours rather than awaken her , or , if he rose , would take the most watchful heed to leave unharmed the slender limbs , the flushed cheeks , the frank fair brow of the sleeper beneath him , that one stroke of his hoof could have stamped out into a bruised and shapeless mass . To - night Etoile - Filante slept , and his mistress was awake — wide awake , with her eyes looking out into the darkness beyond , with a passionate mist of unshed tears in them , and her mouth quivering with pain and with wrath . The vehement excitation had not died away in her , but there had come with it a dull , spiritless , aching depression . It had roused her to fury to hear the reference to her rival spoken — of that aristocrat whose name had been on Cecil 's lips when he had been delirious . She had kept his secret loyally , she had defended him vehemently ; there was something that touched her to the core in the thought of the love with which he had recognised this friend who , in ignorance , spoke of him as of some unknown French soldier . She could not tell what the history was , but she could divine nearly enough to feel its pathos and its pain . She had known , in her short life , more of men and of their passions and of their fortunes than many lives of half a century in length can ever do ; she could guess , nearly enough to be wounded with its sorrow , the past which had exiled the man who had kept by him his lost mother 's ring as the sole relic of years to which he was dead as utterly as though he were lying in his coffin . No matter what the precise reason was — women , or debt , or accident , or ruin — these two , who had been familiar comrades , were now as strangers to each other ; the one slumbered in ignorance near her , the other had gone out to the close peril of death , lest the eyes of his friend should recognise his face and read his secret . It troubled her , it weighed on her , it smote her with a pang . It might be that now , even now — this very moment , whilst her gaze watched the dusky shadows of the night chase one another along the dreary plains — a shot might have struck down this life that had been stripped of name and fame and country ; even now all might be over ! And Cigarette felt a cold sickly shudder seize her that never before , at death or danger , had chilled the warm swift current of her bright French blood . In bitter scorn at herself , she muttered hot oaths between her pretty teeth . Mère de Dieu ! he had touched her lips as carelessly as her own kiss would have touched the rose - hued waxen petals of a cluster of oleander - blossoms ; and she cared for him still ! Whilst the Seraph slept dreamlessly , with the tents of the French camp around him , and the sleepless eyes of Cigarette watched afar off the dim distant forms of the videttes as they circled slowly round at their outpost duty , eight leagues off , through a vast desert of shadow and silence the two horsemen swept swiftly on . Not a word had passed between them ; they rode close together in unbroken stillness ; they were scarcely visible to each other , for there was no moon , and storm - clouds obscured the skies . Now and then their horses ' hoofs struck fire from a flint stone , and the flash sparkled through the darkness ; often not even the sound of their gallop was audible on the grey , dry , loose soil . Every rood of the road was sown thick with peril ; no frowning ledge of rock , with pine - roots in its clefts , but might serve as the barricade behind which some foe lurked ; no knot of cypress - shrubs , black even on that black sheet of shadow , but might be pierced with the steel tubes of levelled waiting muskets . Pillaging , burning , devastating wherever they could , in what was to them a holy war of resistance to the infidel and the invader , the predatory tribes had broken out into a revolt which the rout of Zarâila , heavy blow though it had been to them , had by no means ended . They were still in arms , infesting the country everywhere southward , defying regular pursuit , impervious to regular attacks , carrying on the harassing guerilla warfare at which they were such adepts , and causing thus to their Frankish foe more irritation and more loss than decisive engagements would have produced . They feared nothing , had nothing to lose , and could subsist almost upon nothing . They might be driven into the desert , they might even be exterminated after long pursuit ; but they would never be vanquished . And they were scattered now far and wide over the country ; every cave might shelter , every ravine might enclose them ; they appeared here , they appeared there ; they swooped down on a convoy , they carried sword and flame into a settlement , they darted like a flight of hawks upon a foraging - party , they picked off any vidette as he wheeled his horse round in the moonlight ; and every yard of the miles which the two grey chargers of the Chasseurs d'Afrique must cover ere their service was done was as rife with death as though its course lay over the volcanic line of an earthquake . They had reached the centre of the plain when the sound they had long looked for rang on their ears , piercing the heavy breathless stillness of the night . It was the Allah - il - Allah of their foes , the war - cry of the Moslem . Out of the gloom — whether from long pursuit or some near hiding - place they could not tell — there broke suddenly upon them the fury of an Arab onslaught . In the darkness all they could see were the flash of steel , the flame of fierce eyes against their own , the white steam of smoking horses , the spray of froth flung off the snorting nostrils , the rapid glitter of the curved flissas — whether two , or twenty , or twice a hundred were upon them they could not know — they never did know . All of which they were conscious was that in an instant , from the tranquil melancholy around them of the great , dim , naked space , they were plunged into the din , the fury , the heat , the close , crushing , horrible entanglement of conflict , without the power to perceive or to number their foes , and only able to follow the sheer simple instincts of attack and of defence . All they were sensible of was one of those confused moments , deafening , blinding , filled with violence and rage and din — an eternity in semblance , a second in duration — that can never be traced , never be recalled , yet in whose feverish excitement men do that which , in their calmer hours , would look to them a fable of some Amadis of Gaul . How they were attacked , how they resisted , how they struck , how they were encompassed , how they thrust back those who were hurled on them in the black night , with the north sea - wind like ice upon their faces , and the loose African soil drifting up in clouds of sand around them , they could never have told . Nor how they strained free from the armed ring that circled them , and beat aside the shafts of lances and the blades of swords , and forced their chargers breast to breast against the fence of steel , and through the tempest of rage , and blows , and shouts , and wind , and driven sand , cut their way through the foe whose very face they scarce could see , and plunged away into the shadows across the desolation of the plain , pursued , whether by one or by a thousand they could not guess , for the gallop was noiseless on the powdered soil , and the Arab yell of baffled passion and slaughterous lust was half drowned in the rising of the wind - storm . Had it been day , they would have seen their passage across the level table - land traced by a crimson stream upon the sand , in which the blood of Frank and Arab blended equally . As it was , they dashed headlong down through the darkness that grew yet denser and blacker as the storm rose . For miles the ground was level before them , and they had only to let the half - maddened horses , that had as by a miracle escaped all injury , rush on at their own will through the whirl of the wind that drove the dust upward in spiral columns and brought icy breaths of the north over the sear , sunburnt , southern wastes . For a long space they had no sense but that of rapid ceaseless motion through the thick gloom and against the pressure of the violent blasts . The speed of their gallop and the strength of the currents of air were like some narcotic that drowned and that dizzied perception . In the intense darkness neither could see , neither hear , the other ; the instinct of the beasts kept them together , but no word could be heard above the roar of the storm , and no light broke the sombre veil of shadow through which they passed as fast as leopards course through the night . The first faint streak of dawn grew grey in the east when Cecil felt his charger stagger and sway beneath him , and halt , worn out and quivering in every sinew with fatigue . He threw himself off the animal in time to save himself from falling with it is it reeled and sank to the ground . "
227483	227487	227489	227489	you	5191	" he said . "
227496	228048	228053	228053	you	5195	" There was no reply . He strained his sight to pierce the darkness , but he could distinguish nothing ; the gloom was still too deep . He spoke more loudly ; still there was no reply . Then he raised his voice in a shout ; it rang through the silence , and , when it ceased , the silence reigned again . A deadly chill came on him . How had he missed his comrade ? They must be far apart , he knew , since no response was given to his summons ; or — the alternative rose before him with a terrible foreboding . That intense quiet had a repose as of death in it , a ghastly loneliness that seemed filled with desolation . His horse was stretched before him on the sand , powerless to rise and drag itself a rood onward , and fast expiring . From the plains around him not a sound came , either of friend or foe . The consciousness that he was alone , that he had lost for ever the only friend left to him , struck on him with that conviction which so often foreruns the assurance of calamity . Without a moment 's pause , he plunged back in the direction he had come , leaving the charger on the ground to pant its life out as it must , and sought to feel his way along , so as to seek as best he could the companion he had deserted . He still could not see a rood before him , but he went on slowly , with some vague hope that he should ere long reach the man whom he knew death or the fatality of accident alone would keep from his side . He could not feel or hear anything that gave him the slightest sign or clue to aid his search ; he only wandered farther from his horse , and risked falling afresh into the hands of his pursuers ; he shouted again with all his strength , but his own voice alone echoed over the plains , while his heart stood still with the same frozen dread that a man feels when , wrecked on some barren shore , his cry for rescue rings back on his own ear over the waste of waters . The flicker of the dawn was growing lighter in the sky , and he could see dimly now , as in some winter day 's dark twilight , though all around him hung the leaden mist , with the wild winds driving furiously . It was with difficulty almost that he kept his feet against their force ; but he was blown onward by their current , though beaten from side to side , and he still made his way forward . He had repassed the ground already traversed by some hundred yards or more , which seemed the length of many miles in the hurricane that was driving over the earth and sky , when some outline still duskier than the dusky shadow caught his sight ; it was the body of a horse , standing on guard over the fallen body of a man . Another moment and he was beside them . "
228056	228111	228153	228153	I	0	" He could see nothing but an indistinct and shapeless mass , without form or colour , to mark it out from the brooding gloom and from the leaden earth . But the voice he knew so well answered him with the old love and fealty in it ; eager with fear for him . "
228164	228165	228180	228180	sir	6134	" "
228175	228176	228206	228206	me	0	" "
228208	228209	228222	228222	I	0	" "
228227	228259	228406	228406	you	5195	" Cecil hung over him , striving in vain through the shadows to read the truth from the face on which he felt by instinct the seal of death was set . "
228419	228545	228553	228553	sir	6134	" His voice was checked in a quick gasping breath ; his only thought had been to lie down and die in solitude so that his master might be saved . A great sob shook Cecil as he heard ; no false hope came to him ; he felt that this man was lost to him for ever , that this was the sole recompense which the cruelty of Africa would give to a fidelity passing the fidelity of woman ; these throes of dissolution the only payment with which fate would ever requite a loyalty that had held no travail weary , no exile drear , and no danger worthy counting , so long as they were encountered and endured in his own service . "
228555	228581	228624	228624	you	6134	" whispered Rake , striving to raise his head that he might strain his eyes better through the gloom to see his master 's face . "
228621	228622	228624	228624	you	6134	" "
228628	228655	228660	228660	sir	6134	" The answer was very low , and his voice shook as he uttered it ; but through the roar of the hurricane Rake heard it . "
228662	228668	228660	228660	sir	6134	" he said , simply . "
228693	228694	228660	228660	sir	6134	" "
228703	228704	228774	228774	you	6134	" "
228787	228788	228794	228794	you	6134	" "
228805	229312	229406	229406	sir	6134	" The words broke in an agony from him . The time had been when he had been himself stretched in what he had thought was death , in just such silence , in just such solitude , upon the bare baked earth , far from men 's aid , and near only to the hungry eyes of watching beasts of prey . Then he had been very calm , and waited with indifference for the end ; now his eyes swept over the remorseless wastes , that were growing faintly visible under the coming dawn , with all the impatience , the terror , of despair . Death had smitten down many beside him ; buoyant youth and dauntless manhood he had seen a thousand times swept under the great waves of war and lost for ever ; but it had an anguish for him here that he would never have known had he felt his own life - blood well out over the sand . The whole existence of this man had been sacrificed for him , and its only reward was a thrust of a lance in a midnight fray — a grave in an alien soil . His grief fell dully on ears half deafened already to the sounds of the living world . The exhaustion that follows on great loss of blood was upon the soldier who for the last half - hour had lain there in the darkness and the stillness , quietly waiting death , and not once seeking even to raise his voice for succour lest the cry should reach and should imperil his master . The morning had broken now , but the storm had not lulled . The northern winds were sweeping over the plains in tenfold violence , and the rains burst and poured , with the fury of waterspouts , on the crust of the parched , cracked earth . Around them there was nothing heard or seen except the leaden angry mists , tossed to and fro under the hurricane , and the white light of the coming day breaking lividly through the clouds . The world held no place of more utter desolation , more unspeakable loneliness ; and in its misery , Cecil , flung down upon the sands beside him , could do nothing except — helpless to aid , and powerless to save — watch the last breath grow feebler and feebler , until it faded out from the only life that had been faithful to him . By the fitful gleams of day he could see the blood slowly ebbing from the great gap where the lance - head was still bedded with its wooden shaft snapped in two ; he could see the drooped head that he had raised upon his knee , with the yellow northern curls that no desert suns had darkened ; and Rake 's eyes , smiling so brightly and so bravely still , looked up from under their weary lids to his . "
229339	229402	229406	229406	sir	6134	" Their hands met as he asked it , and held each other close and long ; all the loyal service of the one life , and all the speechless gratitude of the other , told better than by all words in that one farewell . A light that was not from the stormy dusky morning shone over the soldier 's face . "
229408	229416	229561	229561	you	6134	" he said , with a smile , "
229570	229571	229591	229591	you	6134	" "
229588	229589	229673	229673	I	0	" "
229680	229954	229990	229990	you	5227	" His voice grew faint as the last sentence stole from his lips ; he lay quite still , his head leant back against his master ; and the day came , with the north winds driving over the plains , and the grey mists tossed by them to and fro like smoke . There was a long silence , a pause in which the wind - storm ceased and the clouds of the loosed sands sunk . Alone , with the wastes stretching around them , were the living and the dying man , with the horse standing motionless beside them , and , above , the gloom of the sullen sky . No aid was possible : they could but wait , in the stupefaction of despair , for the end of all to come . In that awful stillness , in that sudden lull in the madness of the hurricane , death had a horror which it never wore in the riot of the battle - field , in the intoxication of the slaughter . There was no pity in earth or heaven ; the hard hot ground sucked down its fill of blood ; the icy air enwrapped them like a shroud . The faithfulness of love , the strength of gratitude , were of no avil ; the one perished , the other was powerless to save . In that momentary hush , as the winds sank low , the heavy eyes , half sightless now , sought with their old wistful dog - like loyalty the face to which so soon they would be blind for ever . "
229996	229997	230025	230025	I	0	" "
230005	230024	230028	230028	I	0	" The light , that was like sunlight , shone once more in the aching , wandering eyes . "
230035	230047	230057	230057	I	0	" Cecil bowed his head over him , lower and lower . "
230060	230097	230129	230129	God	565	" With a sudden and swift motion , as though new life were thrilling in him , Rake raised himself erect , his arms stretched outward to the east , where the young day was breaking . "
230131	231414	230129	230129	God	565	" Then , with that light still on his face , his head fell backward ; and with one quick , brief sigh his life fled out for ever . The time passed on ; the storm had risen afresh ; the violence of the gusts blew yellow sheets of sand whirling over the plains . Alone , with the corpse across his knees , Cecil sat motionless as though turned to stone . His eyes were dry and fixed ; but ever and again a great tearless sob shook him from head to foot . The only life that linked him with the past , the only love that had suffered all things for his sake , were gone , crushed out as though they never had been , like some insect trodden in the soil . He had lost all consciousness , all memory , save of that lifeless thing which lay across his knees , like a felled tree , like a broken log , with the glimmer of the tempestuous day so chill and white upon the upturned face . He was alone on earth ; and the solitudes around him were not more desolate than his own fate . He was like a man numbed and stupified by intense cold ; his veins seemed stagnant , and his sight could only see those features that became so terribly serene , so fearfully unmoved with the dread calm of death . Yet the old mechanical instincts of a soldier guided him still ; he vaguely knew that his errand had to be done , must be done , let his heart ache as it would , let him long as he might to lie down by the side of his only friend , and leave the torture of life to grow still in him also for evermore . Instinctively , he moved to carry out the duty trusted to him . He looked east and west , north and south ; there was nothing in sight that could bring him aid ; there were only the dust - clouds hurled in billows hither and thither by the bitter winds still blowing from the sea . All that could be done had to be done by himself alone . His own safety hung on the swiftness of his flight : for aught he knew , at every moment , out of the mist and the driven sheets of sand there might rush the desert - horses of his foes . But this memory was not with him : all he thought of was that burden stretched across his limbs , which , laid down one hour here unwatched , would be the prey of the jackal and the vulture . He raised it reverently in his arms , and with long laborious effort drew its weight up across the saddle of the charger which stood patiently waiting by , turning its docile eyes with a plaintive wondering sadness on the body of the rider it had loved . Then he mounted , himself ; and with the head of his lost comrade borne up upon his arm , and rested gently on his breast , he rode westward over the great plain to where his mission lay . The horse paced slowly beneath the double load of dead and living ; he would not urge the creature faster on ; every movement that shook the drooping limbs , or jarred the repose of that last sleep , seemed desecration . He passed the place where his own horse was stretched : the vultures were already there . He shuddered ; and then pressed faster on , as though the beasts and birds of prey would rob him of his burden ere he could give it sanctuary . And so he rode , mile after mile , over the barren land , with no companion save the dead . The winds blew fiercely in his teeth ; the sand was in his eyes and hair ; the way was long , and weary , and sown thick with danger ; but he knew of nothing , felt and saw nothing , save that one familiar face so strangely changed and transfigured by that glory with which death had touched it . Thus burdened , he made his way for over two leagues . The hurricane never abated , and the blinding dust rose around him in great waves . The horse fell lame ; he had to dismount , and move slowly and painfully over the loose heavy soil on foot , raising the drooping head of the lifeless rider . It was bitter , weary , cruel travail , of an intolerable Labour , of an intolerable pain . Once or twice he grew sick and giddy , and lost for a moment all consciousness ; but he pressed onwards , resolute not to yield and leave the vultures , hovering aloft , their prey . He was still somewhat weakened by the wounds of Zarâila ; he had been bruised and exhausted by the skirmish of the past night ; he was weary and heart - broken ; but he did not yield to his longing to sink down on the sands , and let his life ebb out : he held patiently onward through the infinite misery of the passage . At last he drew near the caravanserai where he had been directed to obtain a change of horses . It stood midway in the distance that he had to traverse , and almost alone where the face of the country changed , and was more full of colour , and more broken into rocky and irregular surface . As a man walks in a dream , he led the sinking beast towards its shelter , as its irregular corner towers became dimly perceptible to him through the dizzy mists that had obscured his sight . By sheer instinct he found his route straight towards the open arch of its entrance - way , and into the square courtyard thronged with mules , and camels , and horses ; for the caravanserai stood on the only road that led through that district to the south , and was the only house of call for drovers , or shelter for traveller and artists of Europe who might pass that way . The groups in the court paused in their converse and in their occupations , and looked in awe at the grey charger with its strange burden , and the French Chasseur who came so blindly forward like a man feeling his passage through the dark . There was something in the sight that had a vague terror for them before they clearly saw what this thing was which was thus brought into their presence . Cecil moved slowly on into their midst , his hand on the horse 's rein ; then a great darkness covered his sight ; he swayed to and fro , and fell senseless on the grey stone of the paved court , while the muleteers and the camel - drivers , the Kabyls and the French , who were mingled there , crowded around him in fear and in wonder . When consciousness returned to him , he was lying on a stone bench in the shadow of the wall , with the coolness of the fountain water bubbling near , and a throng of lean , bronzed , eager faces about him in the mid - day sunlight which had broken through the wind - storm . Instantly he remembered all . "
231419	231476	230129	230129	God	565	" he asked . They knew that he meant the dead man , and answered him in a hushed murmur of many voices . They had placed the body gently down within , in a darkened chamber . A shiver passed over him ; he stretched his hand out for water that they held to him : "
231490	231553	230129	230129	God	565	" He knew that for no friendship , or grief , or suffering , or self - pity might a soldier pause by the wayside whilst his errand was still undone , his duty unfulfilled . He drank the water thirstily ; then reeling slightly still from the weakness that was still upon him , he rose rejecting their offers of aid . "
231559	231972	231990	231990	Madame	815	" he said , simply . They understood him ; there were French soldiers amongst them , and they took him , without question or comment , across the court to the little square stone cell within one of the towers , where they had laid the corpse , with nothing to break the quiet and the solitude except the low soft cooing of some doves that had their home in its dark corners , and flew in and out at pleasure through the oval aperture that served as window . He motioned them all back with his hand , and went into the gloom of the chamber alone . Not one amongst them followed . When he came forth again the reckless and riotous fantassins of France turned silently and reverentially away , so that they should not look upon his face . For it was well known throughout the Army that no common tie had bound together the exiles of England ; and the fealty of comrade to comrade was sacred in their sight . The fresh animal , saddled , was held ready outside the gates . He crossed the court , moving still like a man without sense of what he did ; he had the instinct to carry out the mission trusted to him , instantly and accurately , but he had no distinct perception or memory of aught else , save of those long - familiar features of which , ere he could return , the cruel sun of Africa would not have spared one trace . He passed under the shadow of the gateway arch ; a shadow black and intense against the golden light which , with the ceasing of the storm , flooded the land in the full morning . There were movement , noise , change , haste in the entrance . Besides the arrival of the detachment of the line and of a string of north - ward - bound camels , the retinue of some travellers of rank was preparing for departure , and the resources of the humble caravanserai were taxed beyond their powers . The name that some of the hurrying grooms shouted loudly in their impatience broke through his stupor and reached him . It was that of the woman whom , however madly , he loved with all the strength of a passion born out of utter hopelessness . He turned to the outrider nearest him : "
231988	231989	231990	231990	Madame	815	" "
232000	232001	232025	232025	Miladi	839	" "
232023	232024	232035	232035	Miladi	839	" "
232043	232044	232035	232035	Miladi	839	" "
232048	233022	233024	233024	you	5241	" The remonstrance died on his lips ; he stood gazing out from the gloom of the arch at a face close to him , on which the sun shone full , a face unseen for twelve long years , and which , a moment before laughing and careless in the light , changed , and grew set , and rigid , and pale with the pallor of an unutterable horror . His own flushed , and moved , and altered with a wholly different emotion — emotion that was above all of an intense and yearning tenderness . For a moment both stood motionless and speechless ; then , with a marvellous self - command and self - restraint , Cecil brought his hand to his brow in military salute , passed with the impassiveness of a soldier who passed a gentleman , reached his charger , and rode away upon his errand over the brown and level ground . He had known his brother in that fleeting glance ; but he hoped that his brother would see no more in him than a French trooper who bore resemblance by a strange hazard to one long believed to be dead and gone . The instinct of generosity , the instinct of self - sacrifice , moved him now as , long ago one fatal night , they had moved him to bear the sin of his mother 's darling as his own . Full remembrance , full consideration of what he had done , never came to him as he dashed on across the many leagues that still lay between him and his goal . His one impulse had been to spare the other from the knowledge that he lived ; his one longing was to have the hardness and the bitterness of his own life buried in the oblivion of a soldier 's grave . Within six - and - thirty hours the instructions he bore were in the tent of the Chef du Bataillon whom they were to direct , and he himself returned to the caravanserai to fulfil with his own hand to the dead those last offices which he would delegate to none . It was night when he arrived ; all was still and deserted . He inquired if the party of tourists was gone ; they answered him in the affirmative ; there only remained the detachment of the French Infantry , which were billeted there for a while . It was in the coolness and the hush of the night , with the great stars shining clearly over the darkness of the plains , that they made the single grave , under a leaning shelf of rock , with the sombre fans of a pine spread above it , and nothing near but the sleeping herds of goats . The sullen echo of the soldiers ' muskets gave its only funeral requiem ; and the young lambs and kids in many a future spring - time would come and play , and browse , and stretch their little tired limbs upon its sod , its sole watchers in the desolation of the plains . When all was over , and the startled flocks had settled once again to rest and slumber , Cecil still remained there alone . Thrown down upon the grave , he never moved as hour after hour went by . To others that lonely and unnoticed tomb would be as nothing ; only one amongst the thousand marks left on the bosom of the violated earth by the ravenous and savage lusts of war . But to him it held all that had bound him to his lost youth , his lost country , his lost peace ; all that had remained of the years that were gone , and were now as a dream of the night . This man had followed him , cleaved to him , endured misery and rejected honour for his sake ; and all the recompense such a life received was to be stilled for ever by a spear - thrust of an unknown foe , unthanked , undistinguished , unavenged ! It seemed to him like murder — murder with which his own hand was stained . The slow night hours passed ; in the stillness that had succeeded to the storm of the past day , there was not a sound except the bleating of the young goats straying from the herd . He lay prostrate under the black boughs of the pine ; exhaustion of great fatigue was on him , a grief , acute as remorse , consumed him for the man who , following his fate , had only found at the end a nameless and lonely grave in the land of his exile . He started with a thrill of almost superstitious fear as through the silence he heard a name whispered — the name of his childhood , of his past . He sprang to his feet , and as he turned in the moonlight he saw once more his brother 's face , pale as the face of the dead , and strained with an agonising dread . Concealment was no longer possible : the younger man knew that the elder lived ; knew it by a strange and irresistible certainty that needed no proof , that left no place for hope or fear in its chill , leaden , merciless conviction . For some moments neither spoke . A flood of innumerable memories choked thought or word in both . They knew each other;—all was said in that . Cecil was the first to break the silence . He moved nearer with a rapid movement , and his hand fell heavily on the other 's shoulder . "
233029	233056	233069	233069	they	5243	" The question was stern as the demand of a judge . His brother shuddered beneath this touch , and covered his face with his hands . "
233076	233112	233113	233113	I	0	" ... Cecil 's hand fell from his shoulder . There was that in the words which smote him more cruelly than any Arab steel could have done ; there was the accent of regret . "
233117	233122	233069	233069	they	5243	" he said simply , "
233130	233142	233145	233145	you	5241	" He who bore the title of Royallieu covered his face . "
233148	233153	233161	233161	you	5241	" he whispered hoarsely . "
233163	233205	233556	233556	We	5245	" The other looked up at him with a piteous appeal — the old timorous terrified appeal that had been so often seen on the boy 's face , strangely returning on the gracious and mature beauty of the man 's . "
233246	233555	233569	233569	They	5245	" He would have said enough , more than enough , to satisfy the one who had lost all for his sake , had there but been once in his voice no fear , but only love . As it was , that which he still thought of was himself alone . Whilst crushed with the weight of his brother 's surpassing generosity , he still was filled with only one thought that burned through the darkness of his bewildered horror , and that thought was his own jeopardy . Even in the very first hours of his knowledge that the man whom he had believed dead was living , living and bearing the burden of the guilt he should have borne , what he was filled with was the imminence of his own peril . Cecil stood in silence looking at him . He saw the boyish loveliness he remembered so well altered into the stronger and fuller beauty of the man . He saw that life had gone softly , smoothly , joyously , with this weak and feminine nature ; and that , in the absence of temptation to evil , its career had been fair and straight in the sight of the world . He saw that his brother had been , in one word , happy . He saw that happiness had done for this character what adversity had done for his own . He saw that by it had been saved a temperament that calamity would have wrecked . He stood and looked at him , but he spoke not one word ; whatever he felt , he restrained from all expression . The younger man still hid his face upon his hands , as if , even in those pale grey moonbeams , he shunned the light that was about him . "
233562	233568	234227	234227	Bertie	409	" he murmured , wildly . "
233624	234226	234229	234229	Bertie	409	" Cecil was silent still ; he knew that this agony had been the dread lest he should be living . There were many emotions at war in him — scorn , and pity , and wounded love , and pride too proud to sue for a gratitude denied , or quote a sacrifice that was almost without parallel in generosity , all held him speechless . To overwhelm the sinner before him with reproaches , to count and claim the immeasurable debts due to him , to upbraid and to revile the wretched weakness that had left the soil of a guilt not his own to rest upon him — to do aught of this was not in him . Long ago he had accepted the weight of an alien crime , and borne it as his own ; to undo now all that he had done in the past , to fling out to ruin now the one whom he had saved at such a cost , to turn , after twelve years , and forsake the man , all coward though he was , whom he had shielded for so long — this was not possible to him . Though it would be but his own birthright that he would demand , his own justification that he would establish , it would have seemed to him like a treacherous and craven thing . No matter that the one for whom the sacrifice had been made was unworthy of it , he held that every law of honour and of justice forbade him now to abandon his brother , and yield him up to the retribution of his early fault . It might have been a folly in the first instance , it might even have been a madness , that choice of standing in his brother 's place to receive the shame of his brother 's action ; but it had been done so long before — done on the spur of generous affection , and actuated by the strange hazard that made the keeping of a woman 's secret demand the same reticence which also saved the young lad 's name ; to draw back from it now would have been a cowardice impossible to his nature . All seemed uttered , without words , by their gaze at one another . He could not speak with tenderness to this craven who had been false to the fair repute of their name:—and he would not speak with harshness . He felt too sick at heart , too weary , too filled with pain , to ask aught of his brother 's life ; it had been saved from temptation , and therefore saved from evil ; that knowledge sufficed to him . The younger man stood half stupified , half maddened . In the many years that had passed by , although his character had not changed , his position had altered greatly ; and in the last few months he had enjoyed all the power that wealth and independence and the accession to his title could bestow . He felt some dull , hot , angered sense of wrong done to him by the fact that the rightful heir of them still lived ; some chafing , ingrate , and unreasoning impatience with the saviour of his whole existence ; some bitter pangs of conscience that he would be baser yet , base beyond all baseness , to remain in his elder 's place , and accept this sacrifice still , whilst knowing now the truth . "
234231	234272	234382	234383	a coward	2633	" he stammered , in hurried appeal — and the name of his youth touched the hearer of it strangely , making him for the moment forget all save that he looked once more upon one of his own race — "
234385	234623	234624	234624	I	0	" He spoke the truth ; he was a coward ; he had ever been one . Herein lay the whole story of his fall , his weakness , his sin , and his ingratitude . Cecil knew that never will gratitude exist where craven selfishness holds reign ; yet there was an infinite pity mingled with the scorn that moved him . After the years of bitter endurance he had passed , the heroic endurance he had witnessed , the hard and unending miseries that he had learned to take as his daily portion , this feebleness and fear roused his wondering compassion almost as a woman 's weakness would have done . Still he never answered ; the hatred of the stain that had been brought upon their name by his brother 's deed ( stain none the less dark , in his sight , because hidden from the world ) , his revulsion from this man , who was the only creature of their race who ever had turned poltroon , the thousand remembrances of childhood that uprose before him , the irresistible yearning for some word from the other 's lips that should tell of some lingering trace in him of the old love strong enough to kill , for the moment at least , the selfish horror of personal peril — all these kept him silent . His brother misinterpreted that silence . "
234635	234642	234679	234679	you	5255	" he moaned in his fear . "
234685	234686	234679	234679	you	5255	" "
234691	234692	234694	234694	you	5255	" "
234704	234705	234717	234717	I	0	" "
234729	234805	234717	234717	I	0	" The meaning of his answer drifted beyond the ear on which his words fell ; it was too high to be comprehended by the lower nature . The man who lived in prosperity and peace , and in the smile of the world , and the purple of power , looked bewildered at the man who led the simple , necessitous , perilous , semi - barbaric existence of an Arab - Franco soldier . "
234819	234820	234717	234717	I	0	" "
234832	234858	234717	234717	I	0	" The reply had the only sternness of contempt that he had suffered himself to show . It stung down to his listener 's soul . "
234863	234867	234896	234896	You	5255	" he murmured . "
234894	234895	234947	234947	You	5255	" "
234906	234946	234947	234947	You	5255	" He spoke quite quietly , quite patiently . Yet he well knew , and had well weighed , all he surrendered in that promise — the promise to condemn himself to a barren and hopeless fate for ever . "
234951	235681	234947	234947	You	5255	" The question died almost inaudible on his dry , parched tongue . The one passion of fear upon him was for himself ; even in that moment of supplication his disordered thoughts hovered wildly over the chances of whether , if his elder brother even now asserted his innocence and claimed his birthright , the world and its judges would ever believe him . Cecil for a while again was silent , standing there by the newly made grave of the soldier who had been faithful as those of his own race and of his own order never had been . His heart was full . The ingratitude and the self - absorption of this life for which his own had been destroyed smote him with a fearful suffering . And only a few hours before he had looked once more on the face of the beloved friend of his youth;—a deadlier sacrifice than to lay down wealth , and name , and heritage , and the world 's love , was to live on leaving that one comrade of his early days to believe him dead after a deed of shame . His brother sank down on the mound of freshly flung earth , sinking his head upon his arms with a low moan . Time had not changed him greatly ; it had merely made him more intensely desirous of the pleasures and the powers of life , more intensely abhorrent of pain , of censure , of the contempt of the world . As , to escape these in his boyhood , he had stooped to any degradation , so , to escape them in his manhood , he was capable of descending to any falsehood or any weakness . His was one of those natures which , having no love of evil for evil 's sake , still embrace any form of evil which may save them from the penalty of their own weakness . Now , thus meeting one whom for twelve years he had believed must rise from the tomb itself to reproach or to accuse him , unstrung his every nerve , and left him with only one consciousness — the desire at all costs to be saved . Cecil 's eyes rested on him with a strange melancholy pity : he had loved his brother as a youth — loved him well enough to take and bear a heavy burden of disgrace in his stead . The old love was not dead ; but stronger than itself was his hatred of the shame that had touched their race by the wretched crime that had driven him into exile , and his wondering scorn for the feeble and self - engrossed character that had lived contentedly under false colours , and with a hidden blot screened by a fictitious semblance of honour . He could not linger with him ; he did not know how to support the intolerable pain that oppressed him in the presence of the only living creature of his race ; he could not answer for himself what passionate and withering words might not escape him ; every instant of their interview was a horrible temptation to him — the temptation to demand from this coward his own justification before the world — the temptation to seize out of these unworthy hands his birthright and his due . But the temptation , sweet , insidious , intense , strengthened by the strength of right , and well - nigh overwhelming with all its fair delicious promise for the future , did not conquer him . What resisted it was his own simple instinct of justice ; an instinct too straight and true either to yield to self - pity or to passionate desire — justice which made him feel that , since he had chosen to save this weakling once for their lost mother 's sake , he was bound for ever not to repent nor to retract . He gazed awhile longer , silently , at the younger man , who sat still rocking himself wearily to and fro on the loose earth of the freshly filled grave . Then he went and laid his hand on his brother 's shoulder : the other started and trembled ; he remembered that touch in days of old . "
235687	235696	235722	235722	I	0	" he said , gently and very gravely . "
235742	235752	235826	235827	My God	4324	" The words of the saint to the thief , "
235759	235825	235836	235836	you	0	" were not more merciful , not more noble , than the words with which he purchased , at the sacrifice of his own life , the redemption of his brother 's . The other looked at him with a look that was half of terror — terror at the magnitude of this ransom that was given to save him from the bondage of evil . "
235840	235841	235826	235827	My God	4324	" "
235861	235886	235826	235827	My God	4324	" The answer was very calm , but it choked him in its utterance . Before his memory rose one fair , proud face . "
235889	235929	235947	235947	I	0	" Ah , Heaven!—it was the only lie that had ever passed his lips . His hand lay still upon his brother 's shoulder , leaning more heavily there , in the silence that brooded over the hushed plains . "
235950	237729	238902	238903	your mistress	6649	" Then , without another word that could add reproach or seek for gratitude , he turned and went away over the great dim level of the African waste , whilst the man whom he had saved sat as in stupor , gazing at the brown shadows , and the sleeping herds , and the falling stars that ran across the sky , and doubting whether the voice he had heard and the face upon which he had looked were not the visions of a waking dream . How that night was spent Cecil could never recall in full . Vague memories remained with him of wandering over the shadowy country , of seeking by bodily fatigue to kill the thoughts rising in him , of drinking at a little water - channel in the rocks as thirstily as some driven deer , of flinging himself down at length , worn out , to sleep under the hanging brow of a mighty wall of rock ; of waking when the dawn was reddening the east with the brown plains around him , and far away under a knot of palms was a goatherd with his flock like an idyl from the old pastoral life of Syria . He stood looking at the light which heralded the sun , with some indefinite sense of heavy loss , of fresh calamity , upon him . It was only slowly that he remembered all . Years seemed to have been pressed into the three nights and days since he had sat by the bivouac - fire , listening to the fiery words of the little Friend of the Flag . The full consciousness of all that he had surrendered in yielding up afresh his heritage rolled in on his memory like the wave of some heavy sea that sweeps down all before it . When that tear - blotted and miserable letter had reached him in the green alleys of the Stephanien , and confessed to him that his brother had relied on the personal likeness between them and the similarity of their handwriting to pass off as his the bill in which his own name and that of his friend was forged , no thought had crossed him to take upon himself the lad 's sin . It had only been when , brought under the charge , he must , to clear himself , have at once accused the boy , and have betrayed the woman whose reputation was in his keeping , that rather by generous impulse than by studied intention he had taken up the burden that he had now carried for so long . Whether or no the money - lenders had been themselves in reality deceived he could never tell ; but it had been certain that , having avowed themselves confident of his guilt , they could never shift the charge on to his brother in the face of his own acceptance of it . So he had saved the youth without premeditation or reckoning of the cost . And now that the full cost was known to him , he had not shrunk back from its payment . Yet that payment was one that gave him a greater anguish than if he had laid down his life in physical martyrdom . To go back to the old luxury , and ease , and careless peace , to go back to the old fresh fair English woodlands , to go back to the power of command and the delight of free gifts , to go back to men 's honour , and reverence , and high esteem — these would have been sweet enough — sweet as food after long famine . But far more than these would it have been to go back and take the hand of his friend once more in the old unclouded trust of their youth ; to go back , and stand free and blameless amongst his peers , and know that all that man could do to win the heart and the soul of a woman he could at his will do to win hers whose mere glance of careless pity had sufficed to light his life to passion . And he had renounced all this . This was the cost : and he had paid it — paid it because the simple , natural , inflexible law of justice had demanded it . One whom he had once chosen to save he could not now have deserted , except by what would have been , in his sight , dishonour . Therefore , when the day broke , and the memories of the night came with his awakening , he knew that his future was without hope — without it as utterly as was ever that of any captive shut in darkness , and silence , and loneliness , in a prison , whose only issue was the oubliettes . There is infinite misery in the world , but this one misery is rare ; or men would perish from the face of the earth as though the sun withdrew its light . Alone in that dreary scene , beautiful from its vastness and its solemnity , but unutterably melancholy , unutterably oppressive , he also wondered whether he lived or dreamed . From amongst the reeds the plovers were rising ; over the barren rocks the dazzling lizards glided ; afar off strayed the goats : that was the only sign of animal existence . He had wandered a long way from the caravanserai , and he began to retrace his steps , for his horse was there , and although he had received license to take leisure in returning , he had no home but the camp , no friends but those wildeyed , leopard - like , ferocious sons of the razzia and the slaughter , who would throng around him like a pack of dogs , each eager for the first glance , the first word ; these companions of his adversity and of his perils , whom he had learned to love , with all their vices and all their crimes , for sake of the rough , courageous love that they could give in answer . He moved slowly back over the desolate tracks of land stretched between him and the Algerian halting - place . He had no fear that he would find his brother there . He knew too well the nature with which he had to deal to hope that old affection would so have outweighed present fear that his debtor would have stayed to meet him yet once more . On the impulse of the ungovernable pain which the other 's presence had been , he had bidden him leave Africa at once ; now he almost wished that he had bid him stay . There was a weary unsatisfied longing for some touch of love or of gratitude from this usurper , whom he had raised in his place . He would have been rewarded enough if one sign of gladness that he lived had broken through the egotism and the stricken fear of the man whom he remembered as a little golden - headed child , with the hand of their dying mother lying in benediction on the fair silken curls . He had asked no questions . He had gone back to no recriminations . He guessed all it needed him to know ; and he recoiled from the recital of the existence whose happiness was purchased by his own misery , and whose dignity was built on sand . His sacrifice had not been in vain . Placed out of the reach of temptation , the plastic , feminine , unstable character had been without a stain in the sight of men ; but it was little better at the core ; and he wondered , in his suffering , as he went onward through the beauty of the young day , whether it had been worth the bitter price he had paid to raise this bending reed from out the waters which would have broken and swamped it at the outset . It grew fair , and free , and flower - crowned now , in the midst of a tranquil and sunlit lake ; but was it of more value than a drifted weed bearing the snake - egg hidden at its root ? He had come so far out of the ordinary route across the plains that it was two hours or more before he saw the dark grey square of the caravanserai walls , and to its felt that single leaning pine growing out of a cleft within the rock that overhung the spot where the keenest anguish of all his life had known had been encountered and endured — the spot which yet , for sake of the one laid to rest there , beneath the sombre branches , would be for ever dearer to him than any other place in the soil of Africa . Whilst yet the caravanserai was distant , the piteous cries of a mother - goat caught his ear ; she was bleating beside a watercourse , into which her kid of that spring had fallen , and whose rapid swell , filled by the recent storm , was too strong for the young creature . Absorbed as he was in his own thoughts , the cry reached him and drew him to the spot ; it was not in him willingly to let any living thing suffer , and he was always gentle to all animals . He stooped and , with some little difficulty , rescued the little goat for its delighted dam . As he bent over the water , he saw something glitter beneath it ; he caught it in his hand and brought it up ; it was the broken half of a chain of gold , with a jewel in each link . He changed colour as he saw it ; he remembered it as one that Venetia Corona had worn on the morning that he had been admitted to her . It was of peculiar workmanship , and he recognised it at once . He stood with the toy in his hand , looking long at the shining links , with their flashes of precious stones . They seemed to have voices that spoke to him of her about whose beautiful white throat they had been woven — voices that whispered incessantly in his ear , "
237753	238900	238920	238920	her	6649	" No golden and jewelled plaything ever tempted a starving man to theft as this tempted him now to break the pledge he had just given . His birthright ! He longed for it for this woman 's sake — for the sake , at least , of the right to stand before her as an equal , and to risk his chance with others who sought her smile,—as he had never done for any other thing which , with that heritage , would have become his . Yet he knew that , even were he to be false to his word , and go forward and claim his right , he would never be able to prove his innocence ; he could never hope to make the world believe him unless the real criminal made that confession which he held himself forbidden , by his own past action , ever to extort . He gazed long at the broken costly toy , while his heart ached with a cruel pang ; then he placed it in safety in the little blue enamel box , beside the ring which Cigarette had flung back to him , and went onward to the caravanserai . She was no longer there , in all probability ; but the lost bagatelle would give him , some time or another , a plea on which to enter her presence . It was a pleasure to him to know that;—though he knew also that every added moment spent under the sweet sovereignty of her glance was so much added pain , so much added folly , to the dream - like and baseless passion with which she had inspired him . The trifling incident of the goat 's rescue and the chain 's trouvaille , slight as they were , still were of service to him . They called him back from the past to the present ; they broke the stupor of suffering that had fastened on him ; they recalled him to the actual world about him in which he had to fulfil his duties as a trooper of France . It was almost noon when , under the sun - scorched branches of the pine that stretched its sombre fans up against the glittering azure of the morning skies , he approached the gates of the Algerine house - of - call — a study for the colour of Gérôme , with the pearly grey of its stone tints , and the pigeons wheeling above its corner towers , while under the arch of its entrance a string of mules , maize - laden , were guided ; and on its bench sat a French fantassin , singing gaily songs of Paris whilst he cut open a yellow gourd . Cecil went within , and bathed , and dressed , and drank some of the thin cool wine that found its way hither in the wake of the French army . Then he sat down for a while at one of the square cabin - like holes which served for casements in the tower he occupied , and , looking out into the court , tried to shape his thoughts and plan his course . As a soldier he had no freedom , no will of his own , save for this extra twelve or twenty - four hours which they had allowed him for leisure in his return journey . He was obliged to go back to his camp , and there , he knew , he might again encounter one whose tender memories would be as quick to recognise him as the craven dread of his brother had been . He had always feared this ordeal , although the arduous service in which his chief years in Africa had been spent , and the remote expeditions on which he had always been employed , had partially removed him from the ever - present danger of such recognition until now . And now he felt that if once the brave kind eyes of his old friend should meet his own , concealment would be no longer possible , yet , for sake of that promise he had sworn in the past night , it must be maintained at every hazard , every cost . Vacantly he sat and watched the play of the sunshine in the prismatic water of the court - yard fountain , and the splashing , and the pluming , and the murmuring of the doves and pigeons on its edge . He felt meshed in a net from which there was no escape — none — unless , on his homeward passage , a thrust of Arab steel should give him liberty . The trampling of horses on the pavement below roused his attention . A thrill of hope went through him that his brother might have lingering conscience , latent love enough , to have made him refuse to obey the bidding to leave Africa . He rose and leaned out . Amidst the little throng of riding - horses , grooms , and attendants who made an open way through the polyglot crowd of an Algerian caravansarai at noon , he saw the one dazzling face of which he had so lately dreamed by the water - freshet in the plains . It was but a moment 's glance , for she had already dismounted from her mare , and was passing within with two other ladies of her party ; but in that one glance he knew her . His discovery of the chain gave him a plea to seek her;—should he avail himself of it ? He hesitated awhile ; it would be safest , wisest , best , to deliver up the trinket to her courier , and pass on his way without another look at that beauty which could never be his , which could never lighten for him even with the smile that a woman may give her equal or her friend . She could never be aught to him save one more memory of pain , save one remembrance the more to embitter the career which not even hope would ever illumine . He knew that it was only madness to go into her presence , and feed , with the cadence of her voice , the gold light of her hair , the grace and graciousness of her every movement , the love which she would deem such intolerable insult , that , did he ever speak it , she would order her people to drive him from her like a chidden hound . He knew that ; but he longed to indulge the madness despite it , and he did so . He went down into the court below , and found her suite . "
238929	238938	238942	238942	me	0	" he said to one of her equerries . "
238951	238970	239543	239543	He	5267	" said the man , putting out his hand for them . Cecil closed his own upon them : "
238979	239542	239547	239548	a gentleman	6127	" The equerry paused , doubtful whether or no to resist the tone and the words . A Frenchman 's respect for the military uniform prevailed ; he went within . In the best chamber of the caravanserai , Venetia Corona was sitting , listless in the heat , when her attendant entered . The grandes dames who were her companions in their tour through the seat of war , were gone to their siesta . She was alone , with a scarlet burnous thrown about her , and upon her all the languor and idleness common to the noontide , which was still very warm , though , in the autumn , the nights were so icily cold on the exposed level of the plains . She was lost in thought , moreover . She had heard , the day before , a story that had touched her — of a soldier who had been slain crossing the plains , and had been brought , through the hurricane and the sand - storm , at every risk , by his comrade , who had chosen to endure all peril and wretchedness rather than leave the dead body to the vultures and the kites . It was a nameless story to her — the story of two obscure troopers , who , for aught she knew , might have been two of the riotous and savage brigands that were common in the Army of Africa . But the loyalty and the love shown in it had moved her ; and to the woman whose life had been cloudless and cradled in ease from her birth , there was that in the suffering and the sacrifice which the anecdote suggested , that had at once the fascination of the unknown , and the pathos of a life so far removed from her , so little dreamed of by her , that all its coarser cruelty was hidden , whilst only its unutterable sadness and courage remained before her sight . Had she , could she , ever have seen it in its realities , watched and read and understood it , she would have been too intensely revolted to have perceived the actual latent nobility possible in such an existence ; as it was , she heard but of it in such words as alone could meet the ear of a great lady , she gazed at it only in pity from a far distant height , and its terrible tragedy had solemnity and beauty for her . When her servant approached her now with Cecil 's message , she hesitated some few moments in surprise . She had not known that he was in her vicinity ; the story she had heard had been simply of two unnamed Chasseurs d ' Afrique , and he himself might have fallen on the field weeks before , for aught that she had heard of him . Some stray rumours of his defence of the encampment of Zarâila , and of the fine prowess shown in his last charge , alone had drifted to her . He was but a trooper ; and he fought in Africa . The world had no concern with him , save the miniature world of his own regiment . She hesitated some moments ; then gave the required permission . "
239558	239895	239912	239912	I	0	" thought the imperial beauty , who would have refused a Prince or neglected a Duke with chill indifference , but who was too generous to risk the semblance of humiliation to the man who could never approach her save upon such sufferance as was in itself mortification to one whose pride survived his fallen fortunes . Moreover , the interest he had succeeded in awakening in her , the mingling of pity and of respect that his words and his bearing had aroused , was not extinct ; had , indeed , only been strengthened by the vague stories that had of late floated to her of the day of Zarâila ; of the day of smoke and steel and carnage , of war in its grandest yet its most frightful shape , of the darkness of death which the courage of human souls had power to illumine as the rays of the sun the tempest - cloud . Something more like quickened and pleasured expectation than any one amongst her many lovers had ever had power to rouse , moved her as she heard of the presence of the man who , in that day , had saved the honour of his Flag . She came of an heroic race ; she had heroic blood in her ; and heroism , physical and moral , won her regard as no other quality could ever do . A man capable of daring greatly , and of suffering silently , was the only man who could ever hope to hold her thoughts . The room was darkened from the piercing light without ; and in its gloom , as he was ushered in , the scarlet of her cashmere and the gleam of her fair hair was all that , for the moment , he could see . He bowed very low that he might get his calmness back before he looked at her ; and her voice in its lingering music came on his ear . "
239924	239969	239974	239974	Madame	8858	" She felt that she could only thank , as she would have thanked an equal who should have done her this sort of slight service , the man who had brought to her the gold pieces with which his Colonel had insulted him . "
239986	240104	240110	240110	Madame	815	" His words were very low , and his voice shook a little over them ; he was thinking not of the jewelled toy that he came here to restore , but of the inheritance that had passed away from him for ever , and which , possessed , would have given him the title to seek what his own efforts could do to wake a look of tenderness in those proud eyes which men ever called so cold , but which he felt might still soften , and change , and grow dark with the thoughts and the passions of love , if the soul that gazed through them were but once stirred from its repose . "
240120	240172	240180	240180	I	0	" he continued , as he took the little box from his coat and handed it to her . She took it , and thanked him , without , for the moment , opening the enamel case as she motioned him to a seat at a little distance from her own . "
240185	240189	240198	240198	they	5273	" she continued . "
240210	240211	240218	240218	Madame	8858	" "
240226	240227	240218	240218	Madame	8858	" "
240235	240236	240218	240218	Madame	8858	" "
240258	240302	240328	240328	I	0	" He paused ; he dreaded lest the words should escape him which should reveal to her that which she would regard as such intolerable offence , such insolent indignity , when felt for her by a soldier in the grade he held . "
240317	240327	240396	240396	I	0	" A very weary smile passed over his face . "
240353	240395	240436	240436	We	5279	" She understood him ; she comprehended the bitter mockery that the tawdry , meretricious rewards of regimental decoration seemed to the man who had waited to die at Zarâila as patiently and as grandly as the Old Guard at Waterloo . "
240434	240435	240436	240436	We	5279	" "
240444	240445	240463	240463	Madame	8858	" "
240457	240458	240463	240463	Madame	8858	" "

240491	240492	240826	240837	these men , who live without hope — live only to die	5292	" "
240610	240798	240826	240837	these men , who live without hope — live only to die	5292	" She looked at him with that old look which he had seen once or twice before in her , of pity , respect , sympathy , and wonder , all in one . He spoke to her as he had never spoken to any living being . The grave , quiet , listless impassiveness that still was habitual with him — relic of the old habits of his former life — was very rarely broken , for his real nature or his real thoughts to be seen beneath it . But she , so far removed from him by position and by circumstance , and distant with him as a great lady could not but be with a soldier of whose antecedents and whose character she knew nothing , gave him sympathy , a sympathy that was sweet and rather felt than uttered ; and it was like balm to a wound , like sweet melodies on a weary ear , to the man who had carried his secret so silently and so long , without one to know his burden or to soothe his pain . "
240801	240819	240906	240906	They	5297	" she said , thoughtfully , while over the brilliancy of her face there passed a shadow . "
240893	240894	240906	240906	They	5297	" "
240902	240903	240952	240952	You	0	" "
240950	240951	240978	240978	You	0	" "

241017	241551	241554	241554	you	5301	" she said , simply ; but he saw that the lustrous eyes bent on him had a grave sweet sadness in them , that was more precious and more pitiful than a million utterances of regret could ever have been . Those belied her much , who said that she was heartless ; though grief had never touched her , she could feel keenly the grief of other lives . He obeyed her bidding now , and told her , in brief words , the story , which had a profound pathos spoken there , where without through the oval unglazed casement in the distance there was seen the tall dark leaning pine that overhung the grave of yesternight;—the story , over which his voice oftentimes fell with the hush of a cruel pain in it , and which he could have related to no other save herself . It had an intense melancholy and a strange beauty in its brevity and its simplicity , told in that gaunt , still , darkened chamber of the caravanserai , with the grey gloom of its stone walls around , and the rays of the golden sunlight from without straying in to touch the glistening hair of the proud head that bent forward to listen to the recital . Her face grew paler as she heard ; and a mist was over the radiance of her azure eyes : that death in the loneliness of the plains moved her deeply with the grand simplicity of its unconscious heroism . And , though he spoke little of himself , she felt , with all the divination of a woman 's sympathies , how he who told her this thing had suffered by it — suffered far more than the comrade whom he had laid down in the grave where , far off in the noonday warmth , the young goats were at rest on the sod . When he ceased , there was a long silence ; he had lost even the memory of her in the memory of the death that he had painted to her ; and she was moved with that wondering pain , that emotion , half dread and half regret , with which the contemplation of calamities that have never touched and that can never touch them will move women far more callous , far more world - chilled , than herself . In the silence her hands toyed listlessly with the enamel bonbonnière , whose silver had lost all its bright enamelling , and was dinted and dulled till it looked no more than lead . The lid came off at her touch as she musingly moved it round and round ; the chain and the ring fell into her lap ; the lid remained in her hand , its interior unspoiled and studded in its centre with one name in turquoise letters — Venetia . She started as the word caught her eye and broke her reverie ; the colour came warmer into her cheek ; she looked closer and closer at the box , then with a rapid movement turned her head and gazed at her companion . "
241558	241559	241554	241554	you	5301	" "
241572	241573	241594	241594	me	0	" "
241582	241590	241594	241594	me	0	" He looked at her in surprise . "
241599	241600	241594	241594	me	0	" "
241605	241606	241612	241612	Madame	815	" "
241614	241658	241669	241669	you	815	" Her lips parted slightly , the flush on her cheeks deepened ; the beautiful face , which the Roman sculptor had said only wanted tenderness to make it perfect , changed , moved , was quickened with a thousand shadows of thought . "
241671	241687	241750	241750	you	5301	" He rose to his feet and stood entranced before her , breathless and mute . "
241691	241748	241750	241750	you	5301	" she repeated . He was silent still ; gazing at her . He knew her now — how had he been so blind as never to guess the truth before , as never to know that those imperial eyes and that diadem of golden hair could belong alone but to the women of one race ? "
241752	241767	241779	241780	Bertie Cecil	628	" she cried once more , while she stretched her hand out to him . "
241782	241837	241838	241839	Petite Reine	612	" Silently he bowed his head : not even for his brother 's sake , or for sake of his pledged word , could he have lied to her . But her outstretched hands he would not see ; he would not take . The shadow of an imputed crime was stretched between them . "
241841	241845	242069	242070	Petite Reine	612	" he murmured ! "
241857	242068	242096	242096	They	5305	" She grew very pale as she sank back again upon the couch from which she had risen . It seemed to her as though a thousand years had drifted by since she had stood beside this man under the summer leaves of the Stephanien , and he had kissed her childish lips , and thanked her for her loving gift . And now — they had met thus ! He said nothing . He stood paralysed , gazing at her . There had been no added bitterness needed in the cup which he drank for his brother 's sake , yet this bitterness surpassed all other : it seemed beyond his strength to leave her in the belief that he was guilty . She in whom all fair and gracious things were met , she who was linked by her race to his past and his youth ; she whose clear eyes in her childhood had looked upon him in that first hour of the agony that he had suffered then , and still suffered on , in the cause of a coward and an ingrate . She was pale still ; and her eyes were fixed on him with a gaze that recalled to him the look with which "
242071	242095	242096	242096	They	5305	" had promised that summer day to keep his secret , and tell none of that misery of which she had been witness . "
242103	242116	242096	242096	They	5305	" she said at length , whilst her voice sank very low . "
242124	242130	242149	242149	Child	10690	" He made no answer . "
242137	242148	242304	242305	Mr. Cecil	403	" she went on , whilst her voice still shook . "
242239	242303	242616	242616	You	5316	" Still he answered her nothing . The truth he could not tell ; the lie he would not . She paused , waiting reply . Receiving none , she spoke once more , her words full of that exquisite softness which was far more beautiful in her than in women less tranquil , less chill , and less negligent in ordinary moments . "
242422	242607	242659	242663	The wife of an hour	5319	" He sank down beside her on a low seat , and bowed his head on his hands for some moments . He knew that he must leave this woman whom he loved , and who knew him now as one whom in her childhood she had seen caressed and welcomed by all her race , to hold him guilty of this wretched , mean , and fraudulent thing , under whose charge he had quited her country . Great dews of intense pain gathered on his forehead ; his whole mind , and heart , and soul revolted against this brand of a guilt not his own that was stamped on him ; he could have cried out to her the truth in all the eloquence of a breaking heart . But he knew that his lips had been sealed by his own choice for ever ; and the old habits of his early life were strong upon him still . He lifted his head and spoke gently , and very quietly , though she caught the tremour that shook through the words : "
242657	242658	242716	242717	my people	9417	" "
242721	242824	242716	242717	my people	9417	" Had she been kept in ignorance of the accusation beneath which his flight had been made ? He began to think so . It was possible . She had been so young a child when he had left for Africa ; then the story was probably withheld from reaching her , and now , what memory had the world to give a man whose requiem it had said twelve long years before ? In all likelihood she had never heard his name , save from her brother 's lips , that had been silent on the shame of his old comrade . "
242835	242841	242886	242886	He	5323	" he said , passionately . "
242884	242885	242886	242886	He	5323	" "
242891	242897	242949	242949	he	5323	" she answered , eagerly ; "
242955	243364	243371	243371	Philip	476	" He rose hastily , and moved thrice to and fro the narrow floor whose rugged earth had been covered with furs and rugs lest it should strike a chill to her as she passed over it : the torture grew unsupportable to him . And yet , it had so much of sweetness that he was powerless to end it — sweetness in the knowledge that she knew him now her equal , at least by birth ; in the change that it had made in her voice and her glance , whilst the first grew tender with olden memories , and the last had the smile of friendship ; in the closeness of the remembrances that seemed to draw and bind them together ; in the swift sense that in an instant , by the utterance of a name , the exbarrier of caste which had been between them had fallen now and for ever . She watched him with grave musing eyes . She was moved , startled , softened to a profound pity for him , and filled with a wondering of regret ; yet a strong emotion of relief , of pleasure , rose above these . She had never forgotten the man to whom , in her childish innocence , she had brought the gifts of her golden store ; she was glad that he lived , though he lived thus ; glad with a quicker , warmer , more vivid emotion than any that had ever occupied her for any man living or dead except her brother . The interest she had vaguely felt in a stranger 's fortunes , and which she had driven contemptuously away as unworthy of her harbouring , was justified for one whom her people had known and valued whilst she had been in her infancy , and of whom she had never heard from her brother 's lips aught except constant regret and imperishable attachment . For it was true , as Cecil divined , that the dark cloud under which his memory had passed to all in England had never been seen by her eyes , from which , in childhood , it had been screened , and , in womanhood , withheld , because his name had been absolutely forgotten by all save the Seraph , to whom it had been fraught with too much pain for its utterance to be ever voluntary . "
243373	243393	243422	243422	You	5327	" she asked him , at last , when she had waited vainly for him to break the silence . "
243434	243441	243528	243528	You	5327	" He paused before her abruptly . "
243486	243527	243933	243933	you	5337	" She gazed at him in troubled amaze ; there was that in the passionate agitation of this man who had been serene through so much danger , and unmoved beneath so much disaster , that startled and bewildered her . "
243683	243930	243933	243933	you	5337	" Her beauty had never struck him so intensely as at this moment , when , in urging him to the demand of his rights , she so unconsciously tempted him to betray his brother and to forsake his word . The indifference and the careless coldness that had to so many seemed impenetrable and unalterable in her were broken and had changed to the warmth of sympathy , of interest , of excitation . There was a world of feeling in her face , of eloquence in her eyes , as she stooped slightly forward with the rich glow of the cashmeres about her , and the sun - gleam falling across her brow . Pure , and proud , and noble in every thought , and pressing on him only what was the due of his birth and his heritage , she yet unwittingly tempted him with as deadly a power as though she were the vilest of her sex , seducing him downward to some infamous dishonour . To do what she said would be but his actual right , and would open to him a future so fair that his heart grew sick with longing for it ; and yet to yield , and to claim justice for himself , was forbidden him as utterly as though it were some murderous guilt . He had promised never to sacrifice his brother ; the promise held him like the fetters of a galley . "
243938	243976	244031	244031	Philip	476	" she pursued , whilst she leaned nearer with wonder , and doubt , and a certain awakening dread shadowing the blue lustre of her eyes that were bent so thoughtfully , so searchingly , upon him . "
244047	244048	244062	244062	none	1997	" "
244068	244069	244062	244062	none	1997	" "
244072	244126	244130	244130	I	0	" Her face grew paler with a vague sense of fear ; she knew that he had been equable and resolute under the severest tests that could try the strength and the patience of man , and she knew , therefore , that no slender thing could agitate and could unman him thus . "
244135	244159	244170	244170	I	0	" she asked him , as he kept his silence . He turned from her so that she could not see his face . "
244180	244181	244170	244170	I	0	" "
244185	244228	244271	244271	I	0	" An intense horror thrilled through the echo of the word ; but she rose , and moved , and faced him with the fearless resolve of a woman whom no half - truth would blind , and no shadowy terror appal . "
244235	244270	244271	244271	I	0	" Then , and then only , he looked at her , a strange , fixed , hopeless , yet serence look , that she knew no criminal ever would or could have given . "
244282	244301	244319	244319	I	0	" A faint cry escaped her ; her lips grew white , and her eyes darkened and dilated . "
244307	244318	244319	244319	I	0	" His breath came and went in quick sharp spasms . "
244325	244326	244335	244335	I	0	" "
244333	244334	244335	244335	I	0	" "
244339	244340	244342	244342	he	1611	" "
244351	244352	244361	244361	he	1611	" "
244364	244365	244367	244367	you	0	" "
244371	244464	244479	244479	you	0	" It was not an interrogation , but an affirmation that rang out in the silver clearness of her voice . There was not a single intonation of doubt in it ; there was rather a haughty authority that forbade even himself to say that one of his race and that one of his order could have been capable of such ignoble and craven sin . His mouth quivered , a bitter sigh broke from him ; he turned his eyes on her with a look that pierced her to the heart . "
244481	244609	244787	244787	I	0	" His last words were suffocated with the supreme anguish of their utterance . As she heard it , the generosity , the faith , the inherent justice , and the intrinsic sweetness that were latent in her beneath the negligence and the chillness of external semblance rose at once to reject the baser , to accept the nobler , belief offered to her choice . She had lived much in the world , but it had not corroded her ; she had acquired keen discernment from it , but she had preserved all the courageous and the chivalrous instincts of her superb nature . She looked at him now , and stretched her hands out towards him with a royal and gracious gesture of infinite eloquence . "
244638	244786	244850	244850	I	0	" He bowed his head low over her hands as he took them . In that moment half the bitterness of his doom passed from him ; he had at least her faith . But his face was bloodless as that of a corpse , and the loud beatings of his heart were audible on the stillness . This faith must live on without one thing to show that he deserved it ; if , in time to come , it should waver and fall , and leave him in the darkness of the foul suspicion under which he dwelt , what wonder would there be ? He lifted his head and looked her full in the eyes ; her own closed involuntarily , and filled with tears . She felt that the despair and the patience of that look would haunt her until her dying day . "
244856	244992	244850	244850	I	0	" The great tears stood in her eyes , and blinded her as she heard . Even in the amaze and the vagueness of this first knowledge of the cause of his exile she felt instinctively , as the Little One also had done , that some great sacrifice , some great fortitude and generosity , lay within this sealed secret of his súfferance of wrong . She knew , too , that it would be useless to seek to learn that which he had chosen to conceal ; that for no slender cause could he have come out to lead this life of whose sufferings she could gauge the measure ; that nothing save some absolute and imperative reason could have driven him to accept such living death as was his doom in Africa . "
244997	245001	245026	245026	his	5349	" she echoed . "
245035	245036	245108	245108	God	565	" "
245121	245122	245108	245108	God	565	" "
245126	245128	245210	245210	you	5346	" she pursued—"why
245197	245198	245511	245511	I	0	" "
245287	245510	245513	245513	you	5355	" The words broke out in a torrent from him , bearing down with them all his self - control , as the rush of waters bears away all barriers that have long dammed their course . They were wild , passionate , incoherent ; unlike any that had ever passed his lips , or been poured out in her presence . He felt mad with the struggle that tore him asunder , the longing to tell the truth to her , though he should never after look upon her face again , and the honour which bound silence on him for sake of the man whom he had sworn under no temptation to dispossess and to betray . She heard him silently , with her grand meditative eyes , in which the slow tears still floated , fixed upon him . Most women would have thought that conscious guilt spoke in the violence of his self - accusation : she did not . Her intuition was too fine , her sympathies too true . She felt that he feared , not that she should unjustly think him guilty , but that she should justly think him guiltless . She knew that this , whatever its root might be , was the fear of the stainless , not of the criminal life . "
245515	245522	245534	245549	The man whom Philip loved and honoured never sank to the base fraud of a thief	5356	" she answered him , gently ; "
245551	245658	245857	245857	You	0	" Her glorious eyes were still on him as she spoke , seeming to read his very soul . Under that glance all the manhood , all the race , all the pride , and the love , and the courage within him refused to bear in her sight the shame of an alien crime , and rose in revolt to fling off the bondage that forced him to stand as a criminal before the noble gaze of this woman . His eyes met hers full , and rested on them without wavering ; his head was raised , and his carriage had a fearless dignity . "
245750	245856	245857	245857	You	0	" His voice fell before the last words , and faltered over them . It was bitter to ask only for oblivion from the woman whom he loved with all the strength of a sudden passion born in utter hopelessness;—the woman whose smile , whose beauty , whose love might even possibly have been won as his own in the future , if he could have claimed his birthright . So bitter , that rather than have spoken those words of resignation he would have been led out by a platoon of his own soldiery and shot in the autumn sunlight beside Rake 's grave . "
245867	245906	245966	245966	I	0	" she answered him , while a great weariness stole through her own words , for she was bewildered , and pained , and oppressed with a new strange sense of helplessness before this man 's nameless suffering . "
245964	245965	246006	246006	you	0	" "

246080	246452	246020	246020	I	0	" The baffled sense of impotence against the granite wall of some immovable calamity which she had felt before came on her . She had been always used to be obeyed , followed , and caressed ; to see obstacles crumble , difficulties disappear , before her wish ; she had not been tried by any sorrow , save when , a mere child still , she felt the pain of her father 's death ; she had been lapped in softest luxury , crowned with easiest victory . The sense that here there was a tragedy whose meaning she could not reach , that there was here a fate that she could not change or soften , brought a strange unfamiliar feeling of weakness before a hopeless and cruel doom that was no more to be altered by her will than the huge bare rocks of Africa out yonder in the glare of noon were to be lifted by her hand . For she knew that this man , who made so light of perils that would have chilled many to the soul in terror , and who bore so quiet and serene a habit beneath the sharpest stings and hardest blows of his adversities , would not speak thus without full warrant , would not consign himself to this renunciation of every hope , unless he were compelled to it by a destiny from which there was no escape . She was silent some moments , her eyes resting on him with that grave and luminous regard which no man had ever charged to one more tender or less calmly contemplative . He had risen again , and paced to and fro the narrow chamber , his head bent down , his chest rising and falling with the laboured , quickened breath . He had thought that the hour in which his brother 's ingratitude had pierced his heart had been the greatest suffering he had ever known , or ever could know ; but a greater had waited on him here , in the fate to which the jewelled toy that he had lifted from the water had accidentally led him , not dreaming to what he came . "
246456	246528	246020	246020	I	0	" she said , softly , at length , while she rose and moved towards him , the scarlet of the trailing cashmeres gathering dark ruby lights in them as they caught sun and shadow ; and at the old name , uttered in her voice , he started , and turned , and looked at her as though he saw some ghost of his past life rise from its grave . "
246535	246543	246597	246600	a Peer of England	9866	" she pursued ere he could speak . "

246746	246833	246933	246933	God	565	" He spoke the words out to the end — calmly , and with unfaltering resolve . But she saw the great dews gather on his temples , where silver threads were just glistening among the bright richness of his hair , and she heard the short , low , convulsive breathing with which his chest heaved as he spoke . She stood close beside him , and gazed once more full in his eyes , while the sweet imperious cadence of her voice answered him : "
246910	246922	246938	246938	you	0	" His lips shook under his beard as he answered her : "
246942	246971	246973	246973	me	0	" A quick deep sigh escaped her as she heard , her face grew very pale as it had done before , and she moved slightly from him . "
246975	246984	247377	247377	Philip	476	" she said , after a long pause . "
246993	247374	247379	247379	He	476	" She could honour honour too well , and too well divine all that he suffered for its sake , ever to become his temptress in bidding him forsake it ; yet , with a certain weariness , a certain dread , wholly unfamiliar to him , she realised that what he had chosen was the choice not of his present or of his future . It could have no concern for her,—save that long years ago he had been the best - beloved friend of her best - beloved relative — whether or no he remained lost to all the world under the unknown name of a French Chasseur . And yet it smote her with a certain dull unanalysed pain ; it gave her a certain emotion of powerlessness and of hopelessness to realise that he would remain all his years through , until an Arab 's shot should set him free , under this bondage of renunciation , beneath this yoke of service . She stood silent long , leaning against the oval of the casement , with the sun shed over the glowing cashmeres that swept round her . He stood apart in silence also . What could he say to her ? His whole heart longed with an unutterable longing to tell her the truth , and bid her be his judge between him and his duty ; but his promise hung on him like a leaden weight . He must remain speechless ; — and leave her , for doubt to assail her , and for scorn to follow it in her thoughts of him , if so they would . Heavy as had been the curse to him of that one hour in which honour had forbade him to compromise a woman 's reputation , and old tenderness had forbade him to betray a brother 's sin , he had never paid so heavy a price for his act as that which he paid now . Through the yellow sunlight without , over the barren dust - strewn plains , in the distance there approached three riders , accompanied by a small escort of Spahis , with their crimson burnous floating in the autumnal wind . She started , and turned to him : "
247391	247401	247417	247417	You	565	" His eyes strained through the sun - glare : "
247423	247424	247429	247429	he	476	" "

247503	247513	247518	247518	I	0	" She stretched her hands to him once more : "
247525	247542	247588	247588	I	0	" Great burning tears fell from his eyes upon her hands as he bent over them : "
247595	247646	247649	247649	I	0	" She paused in hesitation and in thought awhile , while for the first time in all her years a tremulous tenderness passed over her face ; she felt an unutterable pity for this man , and for his doom . Then she drew her hands gently away from him : "
247655	247802	247816	247816	he	0	" So much concession to such a prayer Venetia Corona had never before given . He could not command his voice to answer , but he bowed low before her as before an empress:—another moment , and she was alone . She stood looking out at the wide level country beyond , with the glare of the white strong light and the red burnous of the Franco - Arabs glowing against the blue but cloudless sky ; she thought that she must be dreaming some fantastic story born of these desert solitudes . Yet her eyes were dim with tears , and her heart ached with another 's woe . Doubt of him never came to her ; but there was a vague , terrible pathos in the mystery of his fate that oppressed her with a weight of future evil , unknown , and unmeasured . "
247808	247812	247906	247906	My	0	" she mused . "
247831	247905	247906	247906	My	0	" In the coolness of the late evening in the court of the caravanserai her brother and his friends lounged with her and the two ladies of their touring and sketching party , while they drank their sherbet , and talked of the Gérôme colours of the place , and watched the flame of the after - glow burn out , and threw millet to the doves and pigeons straying at their feet .

247998	248029	248064	248065	a trooper	1104	" She gave a bend of her head to show she heard him , stroking the soft throat of a little dove that had settled on the bench beside her . "
248069	248079	248085	248085	Berkeley	430	" continued he who was now Duke of Lyonnesse . "

248229	249682	248170	248170	you	0	" One of the most brilliant of Algerian autumnal days shone over the great camp in the south . The war was almost at an end for a time ; the Arabs were defeated and driven desert - wards ; hostilities irksome , harassing , and annoying , like all guerilla warfare , would long continue , but peace was virtually established , and Zarâila had been the chief glory that had been added by the campaign to the flag of Imperial France . The kites and the vultures had left the bare bones by thousands to bleach upon the sands , and the hillocks of brown earth rose in crowds where those , more cared for in death , had been hastily thrust beneath the brown crust of the earth . The dead had received their portion of reward — in the jackal 's teeth , in the crow 's beak , in the worm 's caress . And the living received theirs in this glorious rose - flecked glittering autumn morning , when the breath of winter made the air crisp and cool , but the ardent noon still lighted with its furnace - glow the hill - side and the plain . The whole of the Army of the South was drawn up on the immense level of the plateau to witness the presentation of the Cross of the Legion of Honour . It was full noon . The sun shone without a single cloud on the deep sparkling azure of the skies . The troops stretched east and west , north and south , formed up in three sides of one vast massive square . The battalions of Zouaves and of Zéphyrs ; the brigade of Chasseurs d'Afrique ; the squadrons of Spahis ; the regiments of Tirailleurs and Turcos ; the batteries of Flying Artillery , were all massed there , reassembled from the various camps and stations of the southern provinces to do honour to the day:—to do honour in especial to one by whom the glory of the Tricolour had been saved unstained . The red white and blue of the standards , the brass of the eagle guidons , the grey tossed manes of the chargers , the fierce swarthy faces of the soldiery , the scarlet of the Spahis ' cloaks , and the snowy folds of the Demi - Cavalerie turbans , the shine of the sloped lances , and the glisten of the carbine barrels , fused together in one sea of blended colour , flashed into a million of prismatic hues against the sombre bistre shadow of the sunburnt plains and the clear blue of the skies . It had been a sanguinary , fruitless , cruel campaign ; it had availed nothing except to drive the Arabs away from some hundred leagues of useless and profitless soil ; hundreds of French soldiers had fallen by disease , and drought , and dysentery , as well as by shot and sabre , and were unrecorded save on the books of the bureaux , unlamented save , perhaps , in some little nestling hamlet amongst the great green woods of Normandy , or some wooden hut amongst the olives and the vines of Provence , where some woman toiling till sunset among the fields , or praying before some wayside saint 's stone niche , would give a thought to the far - off and devouring desert that had drawn down beneath its sands the head that used to lie upon her bosom , cradled as a child 's , or caressed as a lover . But the drums rolled out their long deep thunder over the wastes ; and the shot - torn standards fluttered gaily in the breeze blowing from the west ; and the clear full music of the French bands echoed away to the dim distant terrible south , where the desert - scorch and the desert - thirst had murdered their bravest and best — and the Army was en fête . En fête , for it did honour to its darling . Cigarette received the Cross . Mounted on her own little bright bay , Etoile - Filante , with tricolour ribbons flying from his bridle and amongst the glossy fringes of his mane , the Little One rode among her Spahis . A scarlet képi was set on her thick silken curls , a tricolour sash was knotted round her waist , her wine - barrel was slung on her left hip , her pistols thrust in her ceinturon , and a light carbine held in her hand with the butt - end resting on her foot . With the sun on her child - like brunette face , her eyes flashing like brown diamonds in the light , and her marvellous horsemanship , showing its skill in a hundred désinvoltures and daring tricks , the little Friend of the Flag had come hither amongst her half - savage warriors , whose red robes surrounded her like a sea of blood . And on a sea of blood she , the Child of War , had floated , never sinking in that awful flood , but buoyant ever above its darkest waves , catching ever some ray of sunlight upon her fair young head , and being oftentimes like a star of hope to those over whom its dreaded waters closed . Therefore they loved her , these grim , slaughterous , and lustful warriors , to whom no other thing of womanhood was sacred , by whom in their wrath or their crime no friend and no brother was spared , whose law was licence , and whose mercy was murder . They loved her , these brutes whose greed was like the tiger 's , whose hate was like the devouring flame ; and any who should have harmed a single lock of her curling hair would have had the spears of the African Mussulmans buried by the score in his body . They loved her , with the one fond proud triumphant love these vultures of the army ever knew ; and to - day they gloried in her with fierce passionate delight . To - day she was to her wild wolves of Africa what Jeanne of Vaucouleurs was to her brethren of France . And to - day was the crown of her young life . It is given to most , if the desire of their soul ever become theirs , to possess it only when long and weary and fainting toil has brought them to its goal ; when beholding the golden fruit so far off , through so dreary a pilgrimage , dulls its bloom as they approach ; when having so long centred all their thoughts and hopes in the denied possession of that one fair thing , they find but little beauty in it when that possession is granted to satiate their love . But thrice happy , and few as happy , are they to whom the dream of their youth is fulfilled in their youth , to whom their ambition comes in full sweet fruitage , whilst yet the colours of glory have not faded to the young , eager , longing eyes that watch its advent . And of these was Cigarette . In the fair , slight , girlish body of the child - soldier there lived a courage as daring as Danton 's , a patriotism as pure as Vergniaud 's , a soul as aspiring as Napoléon 's . Untaught , untutored , uninspired by poet 's words or patriot 's bidding , spontaneous as the rising and the blossoming of some wind - sown , sun - fed flower , there was , in this child of the battle and the razzia , the spirit of genius , the desire to live and to die greatly . It was unreasoned on , it was felt not thought , it was often drowned in the gaiety of young laughter and the ribaldry of military jest , it was often obscured by noxious influence and stifled beneath the fumes of lawless pleasure ; but there , ever , in the soul and the heart of Cigarette , dwelt the germ of a pure ambition — the ambition to do some noble thing for France , and leave her name upon her soldiers ' lips , a watchword and a rallying - cry for evermore . To be for ever a beloved tradition in the army of her country , to have her name remembered in the roll - call as "
249689	249871	250150	250150	He	5394	" to be once shrined in the love and honour of France , Cigarette — full of the boundless joys of life that knew no weakness and no pain , strong as the young goat , happy as the young lamb , careless as the young flower tossing on the summer breeze — Cigarette would have died contentedly . And now , living , some measure of this desire had been fulfilled to her , some breath of this imperishable glory had passed over her . France had heard the story of Zarâila ; from the Throne a message had been passed to her ; what was far beyond all else to her , her own Army of Africa had crowned her , and thanked her , and adored her as with one voice , and wheresoever she passed the wild cheers rang through the roar of musketry , as through the silence of sunny air , and throughout the regiments every sword would have sprung from its scabbard in her defence if she had but lifted her hand and said one word—"Zarâila
249873	250149	250154	250156	the dead man	9143	" The Army looked on her with delight now . In all that mute , still , immovable mass that stretched out so far , in such gorgeous array , there was not one man whose eyes did not turn on her , whose pride did not centre in her — their Little One , who was so wholly theirs , and who had been under the shadow of their Flag ever since the curls , so dark now , had been yellow as wheat in her infancy . The Flag had been her shelter , her guardian , her plaything , her idol ; the flutter of the striped folds had been the first thing at which her childish eyes had laughed ; the preservation of its colours from the sacrilege of an enemy 's touch had been her religion , a religion whose true following was , in her sight , salvation of the worst and the most worthless life ; and that Flag she had saved , and borne aloft in victory at Zarâila . There was not one in all those hosts whose eyes did not turn on her with gratitude , and reverence , and delight in her as their own . Not one : except where her own keen , rapid glance , far - seeing as the hawk 's , lighted on the squadrons of the Chasseurs d'Afrique , and found amongst their ranks one face , grave , weary , meditative , with a gaze that seemed looking far away from the glittering scene to a grave that lay unseen leagues beyond , behind the rocky ridge . "
250162	250750	250751	250752	Allied sovereigns	5396	" thought Cigarette ; and the first taint of bitterness entered into her cup of joy and triumph , as such bitterness enters into most cups that are drunk by human lips . A whole Army was thinking of her , and of her alone ; and there was a void in her heart , a thorn in her crown , because one among that mighty mass — one only — gave her presence little heed , but thought rather of a lonely tomb amongst the desolation of the plains . But she had scarce time even for that flash of pain to quiver in impotent impatience through her . The trumpets sounded , the salvoes of artillery pealed out , the lances and the swords were carried up in salute ; on to the ground rode the Marshal of France , who represented the imperial will and presence , surrounded by his staff , by generals of division and brigade , by officers of rank , and by some few civilian riders . An aide galloped up to her where she stood with the corps of her Spahis , and gave her his orders . The Little One nodded carelessly , and touched Etoile - Filante with the prick of the spur . Like lightning the animal bounded forth from the ranks , rearing and plunging , and swerving from side to side , while his rider , with exquisite grace and address , kept her seat like the little semi - Arab that she was , and with a thousand curves and bounds cantered down the line of the gathered troops , with the west wind blowing from the far - distant sea , and fanning her bright cheeks till they wore the soft scarlet flush of the glowing japonica flower . And all down the ranks a low , hoarse , strange , longing murmur went — the buzz of the voices which , but that discipline suppressed them , would have broken out in worshipping acclamations . As carelessly as though she reined up before the Café door of the As de Pique , she arrested her horse before the great Marshal who was the impersonation of Authority , and put her hand up in the salute , with her saucy wayward laugh . He was the impersonation of that vast , silent , awful , irresponsible power which , under the name of the Second Empire , stretched its hand of iron across the sea , and forced the soldiers of France down into nameless graves , with the desert sand choking their mouths ; but he was no more to Cigarette than any drummer - boy that might be present . She had all the contempt for the laws of rank of your thorough inborn democrat , all the gay insouciant indifference to station of the really free and untrammelled nature ; and , in her sight , a dying soldier , lying quietly in a ditch to perish of shot - wounds without a word or a moan , was greater than all Messieurs les Maréchaux glittering in their stars and orders . As for impressing her , or hoping to impress her , with rank — pooh ! You might as well have bid the sailing clouds pause in their floating passage because they came between royalty and the sun . All the sovereigns of Europe would have awed Cigarette not one whit more than a gathering of muleteers . "
250756	250762	250844	250845	The Generalissimo	5397	" she would have said , "
250781	250843	251253	251254	the Emperor	3329	" So she reined up before the Marshal and his staff , and the few great personages whom Algeria could bring around them , as indifferently as she had many a time reined up before a knot of grim Turcos , smoking under a barrack - gate . He was nothing to her : it was her Army that crowned her . "
250882	251047	251253	251254	the Emperor	3329	" Cigarette would say with metaphorical unction , forgetful , like most allegorists , that her fable was one - sided and unjust in figure and deduction . Nevertheless , despite her gay contempt for rank , her heart beat fast under its gold - laced jacket as she reined up Etoile and saluted . In that hot clear sun all the eyes of that immense host were fastened on her , and the hour of her longing desire was come at last . France had recognised that she had done greatly , and France , through the voice of this , its chief , spoke to her — France , her beloved , and her guiding - star , for whose sake the young brave soul within her would have dared and have endured all things . There was a group before her , large and brilliant , but at them Cigarette never looked ; what she saw were the sunburnt faces of her "
251050	251200	251201	251201	Mademoiselle	917	" of men who , in the majority , were old enough to be her grandsires , who had been with her through so many darksome hours , and whose black and rugged features lightened and grew tender whenever they looked upon their Little One . For the moment she felt giddy with sweet fiery joy ; they were here to behold her thanked in the name of France . The Marshal , in advance of all his staff , doffed his plumed hat and bowed to his saddle - bow as he faced her . He knew her well by sight , this pretty child of his Army of Africa , who had , before then , suppressed mutiny like a veteran , and led the charge like a Murat — this kitten with a lion 's heart , this humming - bird with an eagle 's swoop . "
251203	251229	251335	251335	I	0	" he commenced , while his voice , well skilled to such work , echoed to the farthest end of the long lines of troops , "
251347	251614	251335	251335	I	0	" As the brief and soldierly words rolled down the ranks of the listening regiments , he stooped forward from his saddle and fastened the red ribbon on her breast ; while from the whole gathered mass , watching , hearing , waiting breathlessly to give their tribute of applause to their darling also , a great shout rose as with one voice , strong , full , echoing over and over again across the plains in thunder that joined her name with the name of France and of Napoléon , and hurled it upward in fierce tumultuous idolatrous love to those cruel cloudless skies that shone above the dead . She was their child , their treasure , their idol , their young leader in war , their young angel in suffering ; she was all their own , knowing with them one common mother — France . Honour to her was honour to them ; they gloried with heart and soul in this bright young fearless life that had been amongst them ever since her infant feet had waded through the blood of slaughter - fields , and her infant lips had laughed to see the tricolour float in the sun above the smoke of battle . And as she heard , her face became very pale , her large eyes grew dim and very soft , her mirthful mouth trembled with the pain of a too intense joy . She lifted her head , and all the unutterable love she bore her country and her people thrilled through the music of her voice : "
251619	251653	251335	251335	I	0	" That was all she said ; in that one first word of their common nationality , she spoke alike to the Marshal of the Empire and to the conscript of the ranks . "
251656	251719	252031	252033	Monsieur le Maréchal	966	" that one title made them all equal in her sight ; whoever claimed it was honoured in her eyes , and was precious to her heart , and when she answered them that it was nothing , this thing which they glorified in her , she answered but what seemed the simple truth in her code . She would have thought it "
251721	252030	252031	252033	Monsieur le Maréchal	966	" to have perished by shot , or steel , or flame , in day - long torture for that one fair sake of France . Vain in all else , and to all else wayward , here she was docile and submissive as the most patient child ; here she deemed the greatest and the hardest thing that she could ever do far less than all that she would willingly have done . And as she looked upon the host whose thousand and ten thousand voices rang up to the noonday sun in her homage , and in hers alone , a light like a glory beamed upon her face that for once was white and still and very grave;—none who saw her face then , ever forgot that look . In that moment she touched the full sweetness of a proud and pure ambition , attained and possessed in all its intensity , in all its perfect splendour . In that moment she knew that divine hour which , born of a people 's love and of the impossible desires of genius in its youth , comes to so few human lives — knew that which was known to the young Napoléon when , in the hot hush of the nights of July , France welcomed the Conqueror of Italy . And in that moment there was an intense stillness ; the Army crowned as its bravest and its best a woman - child in the spring - time of her girlhood . Then Cigarette laid her hand on the Cross that had been the dream of her years since she had first seen the brazen glisten of the eagles above her wondering eyes of infancy , and loosened it from above her heart , and stretched her hand out with it to the great Chief . "
252041	252042	252047	252048	The Emperor	3329	" "
252053	252071	252080	252080	I	0	" Cigarette saluted with her left hand , still stretching to him the decoration with the other . "
252085	252086	252091	252091	your	0	" "
252111	252112	252182	252182	you	0	" "
252125	252180	252606	252606	Mademoiselle	917	" The colour had flushed back , bright and radiant , to her cheeks ; her eyes glanced with their old daring ; her contemptuous , careless eloquence returned , and her voice echoed , every note distinct as the notes of a trumpet - call , down the ranks of the listening soldiery . "
252565	252605	252606	252606	Mademoiselle	917	" The Marshal listened , half amazed , half amused — half prepared to resent the insult to the Empire and to discipline , half disposed to award that submission to her caprice which all Algeria gave to Cigarette . "
252608	252617	252646	252646	he	5411	" he said , with a grave smile , "
252642	252643	252646	252646	he	5411	" "
252648	252668	252777	252777	You	5427	" echoed Cigarette , with all her fiery disdain for authority ablaze once more like brandy in a flame . "
252775	252776	252777	252777	You	5427	" "
252785	252786	252777	252777	You	5427	" "
252793	253039	253070	253072	Monsieur le Maréchal	966	" Her brave eyes glowed in the sun , her voice rang as clear as a bell . She raised her head proudly and glanced down the line of her army . She was just — that was the one virtue in Cigarette 's creed without which you were poltroon , or liar , or both . She alone knew what neglect , what indifference , what unintentional but none the less piercing insults she had to avenge ; she alone knew of that pain with which she had heard the name of her patrician rival murmured in delirious slumber after Zarâila ; she alone knew of that negligent caress of farewell with which her lips had been touched as lightly as his hand caressed a horse 's neck or a bird 's wing . But these did not weigh with her one instant to make her withhold the words that she deemed deserved ; these did not balance against him one instant the pique and the pain of her own heart in opposition to the due of his courage and his fortitude . Cigarette was rightly proud of her immunity from the weaknesses of her sex ; she had neither meanness nor selfishness . The Marshal listened gravely , the groups around him smilingly . If it had been any other than the Little One , it would have been very different ; as it was , all France and all Algeria knew Cigarette . "
253058	253063	253078	253078	he	5431	" he asked her . "
253085	253086	253105	253107	A fine soldier	3509	" "
253103	253104	253133	253133	you	0	" "
253113	253131	253262	253262	Miladi	839	" ' interrupted Cigarette , with rebellious indifference to the rank of the great man she corrected , "
253146	253261	253262	253262	Miladi	839	" As she spoke , her eyes for the first time glanced over the various personages who were mingled amongst the staff of the Marshal , his invited guests for the review upon the plains . The colour burned more duskily in her cheek , her eyes glittered with hate ; she could have bitten her little , frank , witty tongue through and through for having spoken the name of that Chasseur who was yonder , out of earshot , where the lance - heads of his squadrons glistened against the blue skies . She saw a face which , though seen but once before , she knew instantly again — the face of "
253264	253295	253299	253299	she	839	" And she saw it change colour , and lose its beautiful hue , and grow grave and troubled as the last words passed between herself and the French Marshal . "
253302	253364	253366	253366	she	839	" wondered Cigarette , who , with a common error of such vehement young democrats as herself , always thought that hearts never ached in the Patrician Order , and thought so still when she saw the listless proud tranquillity return , not again to be altered , over the perfect features that she watched with so much violent instinctive hate . "
253388	253480	254218	254218	I	0	" mused the child . And her heart sank , and bitterness mingled with her joy , and the soul that had a moment before been so full of all pure and noble emotion , all high and patriotic and idealic thought , was dulled and soiled and clogged with baser passions . So ever do unworthy things drag the loftier nature earthward . She scarcely heard the Marshal 's voice as it addressed her with a kindly indulgence , as to a valued soldier and a spoilt pet in one . "
253542	253915	254171	254174	Poor little unsexed child	5445	" None had ever won such warm words from the redoubted chief , whose speech was commonly rapid and stern as his conduct of war , and who usually recompensed his men for fine service rather with a barrel of brandy to season their rations than with speeches of military eulogium . But it failed to give delight to Cigarette . She felt resting upon her the calm gaze of those brilliant azure eyes ; and she felt , as she had done once in her rhododendron shelter , as though she were some very worthless , rough , rude , untaught , and coarse little barbarian , who was , at best , but fit for a soldier 's jest and a soldier 's riot in the wild licence of the barrack - room or the campaigning tent . It was only the eyes of this woman , whom he loved , which ever had power to awaken that humiliation , that impatience of herself , that consciousness of something lost and irrevocable , which moved her now . Cigarette was proud with an intense pride of all her fiery liberty from every feminine trammel , of all her complete immunity from every scruple and every fastidiousness of her sex . But , for once , within sight of that noble and haughty beauty a poignant , cruel , wounding sense of utter inferiority , of utter debasement , possessed and weighed down her lawless and indomitable spirit . Some vague weary feeling that her youth was fair enough in the sight of men , but that her older years would be very dark , very terrible , came on her even in this hour of the supreme joy , the supreme triumph , of her life . Even her buoyant and cloudless nature did not escape that mortal doom which pursues and poisons every ambition in the very instant of its full fruition . The doubt , the pain , the self - mistrust were still upon her as she saluted once again , and paced down the ranks of the assembled divisions ; whilst every lance was carried , every sword lifted , every bayonet presented to the order , "
253920	254170	254171	254174	Poor little unsexed child	5445	" as she went ; greeted as though she were an Empress , for that Cross which glittered on her heart , for that courage wherewith she had saved the Tricolour . The great shouts rent the air ; the clash of the lowered arms saluted her ; the drums rolled out upon the air ; the bands of the regiments of Africa broke into the fiery rapture of a war - march ; the folds of the battle - torn flags were flung out wider and wider on the breeze . Grey - bearded men gazed on her with tears of delight upon their grizzled lashes , and young boys looked at her as the children of France once gazed upon Jeanne d ' Arc , where Cigarette , with the red ribbon on her breast , rode slowly in the noonday light along the line of troops . It was the paradise of which she had dreamed ; it was the homage of the army she adored ; it was one of those hours in which life is transfigured , exalted , sublimated into a divine glory by the pure love of a people ; and yet in that instant , so long , so passionately desired , the doom of all genius was hers . There was the stealing pain of a weary unrest amidst the sunlit and intoxicating joy of satisfied aspiration . The eyes of Venetia Corona followed her with something of ineffable pity . "
254176	254180	254218	254218	I	0	" she thought . "
254196	254217	254243	254243	she	5445	" The Seraph , beside her in the group around the flag - staff , smiled and turned to her . "
254262	254263	254294	254294	you	5448	" "
254290	254291	254326	254326	she	5445	" "
254339	254340	254346	254346	he	5447	" "
254350	254376	254413	254413	him	5447	" There was a certain impatience in the tone , and something of contemptuous disbelief , that made her brother look at her in wonder . "
254389	254397	254428	254428	I	0	" he thought , as he answered : "
254435	254436	254446	254448	the cavalry squadrons	5453	" "
254454	254841	254446	254448	the cavalry squadrons	5453	" She spoke with indifference , but she grew a little pale as she did so , and the eyes that had always met his so frankly , so proudly , were turned from him . He saw it , and it troubled him with a trouble the more perplexed that he could assign to himself no reason for it . That it could be caused by any interest felt for a Chasseur d ' Afrique by the haughtiest lady in all Europe would have been too preposterous and too insulting a supposition for it ever to occur to him . And he did not dream the truth — the truth that it was her withholding , for the first time in all her life , any secret from him which caused her pain ; that it was the fear lest he should learn that his lost friend was living thus which haunted her with that unspoken anxiety . They were travelling here with the avowed purpose of seeing the military operations of the south ; she could not have prevented him from accepting the Marshal 's invitation to the review of the African Army without exciting comment and interrogation ; she was forced to let events take their own course , and shape themselves as they would ; yet an apprehension , a dread , that she could hardly form into distinct shape , pursued her . It weighed on her with an infinite oppression — this story which she alone had had revealed to her , this life whose martyrdom she alone had seen , and whose secret even she could not divine . It affected her more powerfully , it grieved her more keenly , than she herself knew . It brought her close , for the only time in her experience , to a life absolutely without a hope , and one that accepted the despair of such a destiny with silent resignation ; it moved her as nothing less , as nothing feebler or of more common type , could ever have found power to do . There were a simplicity and a greatness in the mute , unpretentious , almost unconscious , heroism of this man , who , for the sheer sake of that which he deemed the need of "
254844	255519	254446	254448	the cavalry squadrons	5453	" accepted the desolation of his entire future , which attracted her as nothing else had ever done , which made her heart ache when she looked at the glitter of the Franco - Arab squadrons , where their sloped lances glistened in the sun , with a pang that she had never felt before . Moreover , as the untutored , half - barbaric , impulsive young heart of Cigarette had felt , so felt the high - bred , cultured , world - wise mind of Venetia Corona — that this man 's exile was no shame , but some great sacrifice ; a sacrifice whose bitterness smote her with its own suffering , whose mystery wearied her with its own perplexity , as she gazed down the line of the regiments to where the shot - bruised Eagle of Zarâila gleamed above the squadrons of the Chasseurs d ' Afrique . He , is his place amongst those squadrons , knew her , though so far distant , and endured the deadliest trial of patience which had come to him whilst beneath the yoke of African discipline . To leave his place was to incur the heaviest punishment ; yet he could almost have risked that sentence rather than wait there . Only seven days had gone by since he had been with her under the roof of the caravanserai ; but it seemed to him as if these days had aged him more than all the twelve years that he had passed upon the Algerian soil . He was thankful that the enmity of his relentless chief had placed such shadow of evil report between his name and the rewards due to his service , that even the promised recognition of his brilliant actions at Zarâila and elsewhere was postponed awhile on the plea of investigation . He was thankful that the honours which the whole Army expected for him , and which the antagonism of Châteauroy would soon be powerless to avert any longer from their meet bestowal , did not force him to go up there in the scorching light of the noon , and take those honours as a soldier of France , under the eyes of the man he loved , of the woman he adored . As it was , he sat motionless as a statue in his saddle , and never looked westward to where the tricolours of the flag - staff drooped above the head of Venetia Corona . Thus , he never heard the gallant words spoken in his behalf by the loyal lips that he had not cared to caress . As she passed down the ranks , indeed , he saw and smiled on his little champion ; but the smile had only a weary kindness of recognition in it , and it wounded Cigarette more than though he had struck her through the breast with his lance . The moment that he dreaded came ; the troops broke up and marched past the representative of their Empire , the cavalry at the head of the divisions . He passed amongst the rest ; he raised his lance so that it hid his features as much as it slender shaft could do ; the fair and noble face on which his glance flashed was very pale and very grave ; the one beside heer was sunny and frank , and unchanged by the years that had drifted by , and its azure eyes , so like her own , sweeping over the masses with all the swift , keen appreciation of a military glance , were so eagerly noting carriage , accoutrement , harness , horses , that they never once fell upon the single soldier whose heart so unutterably longed for , even whilst it dreaded , his recognition . Venetia gave a low , quick breath of mingled pain and relief as the last of the Chasseurs paced by . The Seraph started , and turned his head : "
255528	255529	255534	255534	You	5393	" "
255532	255533	255557	255557	He	5455	" "
255555	255556	255557	255557	He	5455	" "
255566	255576	255597	255597	I	0	" Her brother looked ; it was too late : "
255605	255606	255597	255597	I	0	" "
255612	255613	255623	255623	I	0	" "
255627	255628	255623	255623	I	0	" "
255648	255649	255653	255657	A man who at Zarâila	5456	" "
255660	255661	255673	255677	a Chasseur d ' Afrique	9270	" "
255682	256522	255623	255623	I	0	" The colour flushed her face as she spoke ; it was with the scorn , the hatred , of this shadow of an untruth with which she for the sole time in life soiled her lips . He , noting it , shook himself restlessly in his saddle . If he had not known her to be the noblest and the haughtiest of all the imperial women who had crowned his house with their beauty and their honour , he could have believed that some interest , degrading as disgrace , moved her towards this foreign trooper , and caused her altered wishes and her silence . As it was , so much insult to her as would have existed in the mere thought was impossible to him ; yet it left him annoyed and vaguely disquieted . The subject did not wholly fade from his mind throughout the entertainments that succeeded to the military inspection , in the great white tent glistening with gilded bees and brightened with tricolour standards which the ingenuity of the soldiers of the administration had reared as though by magic amidst the barrenness of the country , and in which the skill of camp cooks served up a delicate banquet . The scene was very picturesque , and all the more so for the wide - spread changing panorama without of the canvas city of the camp . It was chiefly designed to pleasure the great lady who had come so far southward ; all the resources which could be employed were exhausted to make the occasion memorable and worthy of the dignity of the guests whom the Viceroy of the Empire delighted to honour . Yet she , seated there on his right hand , where the rich skins and cashmeres and carpets were strewn on a dais , saw in reality little save a confused blending of hues , and metals , and orders , and weapons , and snowy beards , and olive faces , and French elegance and glitter fused with the grave majesty of Arab pomp . For her thoughts were not with scene around her , but with the soldier who was without in that teeming crowd of tents , who lived in poverty , and danger , and the hard slavery of unquestioning obedience , and asked only to be as one dead to all who had known and loved him in his youth . It was in vain that she repelled the memory ; it usurped her , and would not be displaced . Meantime , in another part of the camp , the heroine of Zarâila was feasted , not less distinctively , if more noisily and more familiarly , by the younger officers of the various regiments . La Cigarette , many a time before the reigning spirit of suppers and carouses , was banqueted with all the éclat that befitted that Cross which sparkled on her blue and scarlet vest . High throned on a pyramid of knapsacks , canteens , and rugs , toasted a thousand times in all the brandies and red wines that the stores would yield , sung of in improvised odes that were chanted by voices which might have won European fame as tenor or as basso , caressed and sued with all the rapid , fiery , lightly - come and lightly - go love of the camp , with twice a hundred flashing , darkling eyes bent on her in the hot admiration that her vain coquette spirit found delight in , ruling as she would with jest , and caprice , and command , and bravado all these men who were terrible as tigers to their foes , the Little One reigned alone ; and — like many who have reigned before her — found lead in her sceptre , dross in her diadem , satiety in her kingdom . When it was over , this banquet that was all in her honour , and that three months before would have been a paradise to her , she shook herself free of the scores of arms outstretched to keep her captive , and went out into the night alone . She did not know what she ailed , but she was restless , oppressed , weighed down with a sense of dissatisfied weariness that had never before touched the joyous and elastic nature of the child of France . And this , too , in the moment when the very sweetest and loftiest of her ambitions was attained ! when her hand wandered to that decoration on her heart which had been ever in her sight what the crown of wild olive and the wreath of summer grasses were to the youths and to the victors of the old dead classic years ! As she stood in solitude under the brilliancy of the stars , tears , unfamiliar and unbidden , rose in her eyes as they gazed over the hosts around her . "
256541	256612	256774	256774	hers	5460	" she thought . Upon her , as on the poet or the patriot who could translate and could utter the thought as she could not , there weighed the burden of that heart - sick consciousness of the vanity of the highest hope , the futility of the noblest , effort , to bring light into the darkness of the suffering , toiling , blind throngs of human life . "
256625	256771	256774	256774	hers	5460	" thought the aching heart of the child - soldier , unconsciously returning to the only end that the genius and the greatness of Greece could find as issue to the terrible jest , the mysterious despair , of all existence . Some way distant , parted by a broad strip of unoccupied ground from the camp , were the grand marquees set aside for the Marshal and for his guests . They were twelve in number , gaily decorated as far as decoration could be obtained in the southern provinces of Algeria , and had , Arab - like , in front of each the standard of the Tricolour . Before one were two other standards also — the flags of England and of Spain . Cigarette , looking on from afar , saw the alien colours wave in the torchlight flickering on them . "
256776	256859	256774	256774	hers	5460	" thought the Little One , with the mournful and noble emotions of the previous moments swiftly changing into the violent , reasonless , tumultuous hatred at once of a rival and of an Order . Cigarette was a thorough democrat ; when she was two years old she had sat on the topmost pile of a Parisian barricade , with the red bonnet on her curls , and had clapped her tiny hands for delight when the bullets flew , and the "
256861	256876	256774	256774	hers	5460	" rose above the cannonading ; and the spirit of the musketry and of the "
256878	256964	256774	256774	hers	5460	" had together passed into her and made her what she was . She was a genuine democrat ; and nothing short of the pure isonomy of the Greeks was tolerated in her political philosophy , though she could not have told what such a word had meant for her life . She had all the furious prejudices and all the instinctive truths in her of an uncompromising Rouge ; and the sight alone of those lofty standards , signalising the place of rest of the "
256967	256970	256774	256774	hers	5460	" whilst her "
256973	258138	258243	258243	I	0	" lowly tents wore in her sight all the dignity and all the distinction of the true field , would have aroused her ire at any time . But now a hate tenfold keener moved her ; she had a jealousy of the one in whose honour those two foreign ensigns floated , that was the most bitter thing which had ever entered her short and sunny life — a hate the hotter because tinged with that sickening sense of self - humiliation , because mingled with that wondering emotion at beholding something so utterly unlike to all that she had known or dreamt . She had it in her , could she have had the power , to mercilessly and brutally destroy this woman 's beauty , which was so far above her reach , as she had once destroyed the ivory wreath ; yet , as that of the snow - white carving had done , so did this fair and regal beauty touch her , even in the midst of her fury , with a certain reverent awe , with a certain dim sense of something her own life had missed . She had trodden the ivory in pieces with all the violence of childish , savage , uncalculating hate , and she had been chidden , as by a rebuking voice , by the wreck which her action had made at her feet : so could she now , had it been possible , have ruined and annihilated the loveliness that filled his heart and his soul ; but so would she also , the moment her instinct to avenge herself had been sated , have felt the remorse and the shame of having struck down a delicate and gracious thing that even in its destruction had a glory that was above her . Even her very hate attracted her to the sight , to the study , to the presence of this woman , who was as dissimilar to all of womanhood that had ever crossed her path , in camp and barrack , as the pure , white , gleaming lily of the hothouse is unlike the windtossed , sand - stained , yellow leaf down - trodden in the mud . An irresistible fascination drew her towards the self - same pain which had so wounded her a few hours before — an impulse more intense than curiosity , and more vital than caprice , urged her to the vicinity of the only human being who had ever awakened in her the pangs of humiliation , the throbs of envy . And she went to that vicinity , now that the daylight had just changed to evening , and the ruddy torchglare was glowing everywhere from great pine - boughs thrust in the ground , with their resinous branches steeped in oil and flaring alight . There was not a man that night in camp who would have dared oppose the steps of the young heroine of the Cross wherever they might choose , in their fantastic flight , to wander . The sentinels passing up and down the great space before the marquees challenged her , indeed , but she was quick to give the answering password , and they let her go by them , their eyes turning after the little picturesque form that every soldier of the Corps of Africa loved almost like the flag beneath which he fought . Once in the magic circle , she paused awhile , the desire that urged her on , and the hate that impelled her backward , keeping her rooted there in the dusky shadow which the flapping standards threw . To creep covertly into her rival 's presence , to hide herself like a spy to see what she wished , to show fear , or hesitation , or deference , were not in the least what she contemplated . What she intended was to confront this fair , strange , cold , cruel thing , and see if she were of flesh and blood like other living beings , and do the best that could be done to outrage , to scourge , to challenge , to deride her with all the insolent artillery of camp ribaldry , and show her how a child of the people could laugh at her rank , and affront her purity , and scorn her power . Definite idea there was none in her ; she had come on impulse ; but a vague longing in some way to break down that proud serenity which galled her so sharply , and bring hot blood of shame into that delicate face , and cast indignity on that imperious and unassailable pride , consumed her . She longed to do as some girl of whom she had once been told by an old Invalide had done in the ' 89 — a girl of the people , a fisher - girl of the Cannébière , who had loved one above her rank , a noble who deserted her for a woman of his own order , a beautiful , soft - skinned , lily - like scornful aristocrat , with the silver ring of merciless laughter and the languid lustre of swee contemptuous eyes . The Marseillaise bore her wrong in silence — she was a daughter of the south and of the populace , with a dark , brooding , burning beauty , strong and fierce , and braced with the salt lashing of the sea and with the keen breath of the stormy mistral . She held her peace while the great lady was wooed and won , while the marriage joys came with the purple vintage - time , while the people were made drunk at the bridal of their châtelaine in those hot , ruddy , luscious autumn days . She held her peace ; and the Terror came , and the streets of the city by the sea ran blood , and the scorch of the sun blazed , every noon , on the scaffold . Then she had her vengeance . She stood and saw the axe fall down on the proud snow - white neck that never had bent till it bent there , and she drew the severed head into her own bronzed hands and smote the lips his lips had kissed , a cruel blow that blurred their beauty out , and twined a fish - hook in the long and glistening hair and drew it , laughing as she went , through dust , and mire , and gore , and over the rough stones of the town , and through the shouting crowds of the multitudes , and tossed it out on to the sea , laughing still as the waves flung it out from billow to billow , and the fish sucked it down to make their feast . "
258144	258242	258248	258248	I	0	" she cried , where she stood and laughed by the side of the grey angry water watching the tresses of the floating hair sink downward like a heap of seatossed weed . That horrible story came to the memory of Cigarette now as it had been told her by the old soldier who , in his boyhood , had seen the entry of the Marseillais to Paris . She knew what the woman of the people had felt when she had bruised and mocked and thrown out to the devouring waters that fair and fallen head . "
258253	258740	258743	258743	you	5461	" she thought , with the savage instinct of her many - sided nature dominant , leaving uppermost only its ferocity — the same ferocity as had moved the southern woman to wreak her hatred on the senseless head of her rival . The school in which the child - soldier had been reared had been one to foster all those barbaric impulses , to leave in their inborn uncontrolled force all those native desires which the human shares with the animal nature . There had been no more to teach her that these were criminal or forbidden than there is to teach the young tigress that it is cruel to tear the antelope for food . What Cigarette was , that nature had made her ; she was no more trained to self - control , or to the knowledge of good , than is the tiger 's cub as it wantons in its play under the great broad tropic leaves . Now , she acted on her impulse ; her impulse of open scorn of rank , of reckless vindication of her right to do just whatsoever pleasured her ; and she went boldly forward and dashed aside , with no gentle hand , the folds that hung before the entrance of the tent , and stood there with the gleam of the starry night and the glow of the torches behind her , so that her picturesque and brightly coloured form looked painted on a dusky lurid background of shadow and of flame . The action startled the occupants of the tent , and made them both look up : they were Venetia Corona and a Levantine woman , who was her favourite and most devoted attendant , and had been about her from her birth . The tent was the first of three set aside for her occupance , and had been adorned , with as much luxury as was procurable , and with many of the rich and curious things of Algerian art and workmanship so far as they could be hastily collected by the skill and quickness of the French intendance . Cigarette stood silently looking at the scene on which she had thus broken without leave or question ; she saw nothing of it except one head lifted in surprise at her entrance — just such a head , just so proudly carried , just so crowned with gleaming hair , as that which the Marseillaise had dragged through the dust of the streets and cast out to the lust of the sharks . Venetia hesitated a moment in astonished wonder ; then , with the grace and the courtesy of her race , rose and approached the entrance of her tent in which that figure , half a soldier , half a child , was standing with the fitful reddened light behind . She recognised whose it was . "
258748	258754	258952	258952	You	5463	" she said , kindly . "
258764	258951	258952	258952	You	5463	" She spoke with the gentle consideration of a great lady to one whom she admired for her heroism , compassionated for her position , and thought naturally in need of such encouragement . She had liked the frank , fearless , ardent brunette face of the Little Friend of the Flag ; she had liked her fiery and indomitable defence of the soldier of Zarâila ; she felt an interest in her as deep as her pity , and she was above the scruples which many women of her rank might have had as to the fitness of entering into conversation with this child of the Army . She was gentle to her as to a young bird , a young kitten , a young colt ; what her brother had said of the Vivandière 's love for one whom the girl only knew as a trooper of Chasseurs filled with an indefinable compassion the woman who knew him as her own equal and of her own Order . Cigarette , for once , answered nothing ; her eyes very lowering , burning , savage . "
258958	258964	259030	259030	You	5463	" Venetia asked once more . "
258973	259006	259028	259028	Fear	973	" The one word unloosed the spell which had kept Cigarette speechless ; the one word was an insult beyond endurance , that lashed all the worst spirit in her into flame . "
259009	259027	259440	259440	Child	951	" she cried , with a camp oath , whose blasphemy was happily unintelligible to her listener . "
259283	259439	259443	259443	you	951	" The fury of words was poured out without pause , and with an intense passion vibrating through them ; the wine was hot in her veins , the hate was hot in her heart ; her eyes glittered with murderous meaning , and she darted with one swift bound to the side of the rival she loathed , with the pistol half out of her belt ; she expected to see the one she threatened recoil , quail , hear the threat in terror ; she mistook the nature with which she dealt . Venetia Corona never moved , never gave a sign of the amazement that awoke in her ; but she put her hand out and clasped the barrel of the weapon , while her eyes looked down into the flashing , looming , ferocious ones that menaced her , with calm contemptuous rebuke in which something of infinite pity was mingled . "
259446	259452	259479	259479	me	0	" she said , gravely . "
259517	259584	259479	259479	me	0	" The tranquil , unmoved , serious words stilled the vehement passion she rebuked with a strange and irresistible power ; under her gaze the savage lust in Cigarette 's eyes died out , and their lids drooped over them ; the dusky scarlet colour faded from her cheeks ; for the first time in her life she felt humiliated , vanquished , awed . If this "
259586	259812	259479	259479	me	0	" had shown one sign of fear , one trace of apprehension , all her violent and reckless hatred would have reigned on , and , it might have been , have rushed from threat to execution ; but showing the only quality , that of courage , for which she had respect , her great rival confused and disarmed her . She was only sensible , with a vivid agonising sense of shame , that her only cause of hatred against this woman was that he loved her . And this she would have died a thousand deaths rather than have acknowledged . She let the pistol pass into Venetia 's grasp ; and stood , irresolute and ashamed , her fluent tongue stricken dumb , her intent to wound , and sting , and outrage with every vile coarse jest she knew , rendered impossible to execute . The purity and the dignity of her opponent 's presence had their irresistible influence , an influence too strong for even her débonnair and dangerous insolence . She hated herself in that moment more than she hated her rival . Venetia laid the loaded pistol down , away from both , and seated herself on the cushions from which she had risen . Then she looked once more long and quietly at her unknown antagonist . "
259815	259822	259948	259948	Miladi	839	" she said , at length . "
259849	259902	259948	259948	Miladi	839	" Under the challenge the fiery spirit of Cigarette rallied , though a rare and galling sense of intense inferiority , of intense mortification , was upon her ; though she would almost have given the Cross which was on her breast that she had never come into this woman 's sight . "
259907	259943	260108	260108	I	0	" she answered , recklessly , with the red blood flushing her face again at the only evasion of truth of which the little desperado , with all her sins , had ever been guilty . "
260047	260107	260140	260140	I	0	" Her listener heard with a slight smile of amusement and of surprise that bitterly discomfited the speaker . To Venetia Corona the girl - soldier seemed mad ; but it was a madness that interested her , and she knew at a glance that this child of the Army was of no common nature and no common mind . "
260118	260139	260280	260280	You	5473	" she answered , with a tone that sounded strangely tranquil to Cigarette after the scathing acrimony of her own . "
260208	260279	260280	260280	You	5473	" Cigarette once again was silenced ; her face burned , her heart was hot with rage . She had come prepared to upbraid and to outrage this patrician with every jibe and grossness camp usage could supply her with , and — she stood dumb before her ! She could only feel an all - absorbing sense of being ridiculous , and contemptible , and puerile in her sight . "
260287	260298	260341	260341	you	5473	" said Venetia , when she had vainly awaited answer . "
260345	260346	260349	260349	Miladi	839	" "
260351	260376	260650	260650	you	10690	" swore Cigarette , recklessly , seeking only to hold her own against the new sense of inferiority and of inability that oppressed her . "
260589	260632	260717	260717	yourself	5473	" Vehement and exaggerated as the upbraiding was , her hearer 's face grew very grave , very thoughtful , as she spoke ; those luminous earnest eyes , whose power even the young democrat felt , gazed wearily down into hers . "
260719	260746	260717	260717	yourself	5473	" Cigarette 's intelligence was too rapid not to grasp the truths conveyed by those words ; but she was in no mood to acknowledge them . "
260753	260760	260976	260976	you	10690	" she swore in her teeth . "
260935	260973	261151	261151	Dieu	829	" Venetia Corona sighed wearily as she heard ; pain had been so far from her own life , and there was an intense eloquence in the low deep words that seemed to thrill through the stillness . "
261112	261150	261293	261293	My	0	" Cigarette 's fearless eyes drooped under the gaze of those bent so searchingly , yet so gently , upon her ; but only for a moment : she raised them afresh with their old dauntless frankness . "
261261	261292	261335	261335	Pardieu	671	" In all her courted life , the great lady had had no truer homage than lay in that irate reluctant wonder of this fiery foe . She smiled slightly . "
261325	261334	261384	261384	I	0	" Cigarette gave a movement of intolerable impatience : "
261382	261383	261621	261621	I	0	" "
261437	261620	261659	261659	He	5516	" The rebuke was gentle , but it was all the more severe for its very serenity . It cut Cigarette to the quick ; it covered her with an overwhelming sense of mortification and of failure . She was too keen and too just , despite all her vanity , not to feel that she deserved the condemnation , and not to know that her opponent had all the advantage and all the justice on her side . She had done nothing by coming here ; nothing except to appear as an insolent and wayward child before her superb rival , and to feel a very anguish of inferiority before the grace , the calm , the beauty , the nameless potent charm of this woman , whom she had intended to humiliate and injure ! The inborn truth within her , the native generosity and candour that soon or late always overruled every other element in the Little One , conquered her now . She dashed down her Cross on the ground and trod passionately on the decoration she adored : "
261657	261658	261659	261659	He	5516	" "
261663	261724	261659	261659	He	5516	" There was a colder and more utterly amazed hauteur in the interrogation than had come into her voice throughout the interview , yet on her fair face a faint warmth rose . The words were out , and Cigarette was reckless what she said , almost unconscious , indeed , in the violence of the many emotions in her . "
261738	261743	261803	261803	he	5516	" she answered bitterly . "
261807	261808	261803	261803	he	5516	" "
261817	261844	262075	262075	You	5526	" The cold calm dignity of the answer , whose very tone was a rebuke , came strangely after the violent audacity of Cigarette 's speech . "
261960	262074	262075	262075	You	5526	" Hurried headlong by her own vehemence , and her own hatred for her rival which drove her to magnify the worth of the passion of which she was so jealous , that she might lessen , if she could , the pride of her on whom it was lavished , she never paused to care what she said , or heed what its consequences might become . She felt incensed , amazed , irritated , to see no trace of any emotion come on her hearer 's face : the hot , impetuous , expansive , untrained nature underrated the power for self - command of the Order she so blindly hated . "
262088	262099	262121	262121	He	5528	" the grande dame answered her with chill contemptuous rebuke . "
262119	262120	262121	262121	He	5528	" "
262123	262127	262161	262161	he	5528	" retorted Cigarette . "
262167	262168	262170	262170	you	0	" "
262174	262175	262196	262196	He	5528	" "
262179	262195	262221	262221	Men	6265	" cried Cigarette , who saw for the first time that she was betraying herself . "
262226	262227	262271	262271	You	5526	" "
262247	262270	262381	262381	You	5526	" interrupted her auditor , who had in a moment 's rapid thought decided on her course with this strange wayward nature . "
262384	262435	262446	262446	You	5526	" Cigarette gave an affirmative gesture . Her eyes were fastened sullenly , yet with a deep bright glow in them , upon her companion ; she was beginning to see her way through his secret — a secret she was too intrinsically loyal even now to dream of betraying . "
262461	262494	262508	262508	I	0	" pursued Venetia Corona , purposely avoiding all hints of any warmer feeling on her listener 's part , since she saw how tenacious the girl was of any confession of it . "
262511	262512	262508	262508	I	0	" "
262516	262528	262554	262554	you	5526	" answered Cigarette , with an over - assumption of carelessness . "
262559	262560	262643	262643	Pardieu	671	" "
262583	262642	262693	262693	Your	5526	" Cigarette laughed scornfully ; she was furious with herself for standing obediently like a chidden child to hear this patrician 's bidding , and to do her will . And yet , try how she would , she could not shake off the spell under which those grave , sweet , lustrous eyes of command held her . "
262691	262692	262772	262772	I	0	" "
262779	262786	262791	262791	I	0	" Cigarette set her teeth hard . "
262801	262802	262791	262791	I	0	" "
262825	262835	262791	262791	I	0	" Cigarette 's clear brown skin grew very red . "
262840	262864	262907	262908	Louis Victor	688	" she muttered , reluctantly . Her better nature was growing uppermost , though she strove hard to keep the evil one predominant . "
262910	263080	263096	263096	He	5548	" Cigarette nodded assent ; the sullen fire - glow still burnt in her eyes , but she succumbed to the resistless influence which the serenity , the patience , and the dignity of this woman had over her . She was studying Venetia Corona all this while with the keen rapid perceptions of envy and of jealousy , studying her features , her form , her dress , her attitude , all the many various and intangible marks of birth and breeding which were so new to her , and which made her rival seem so strange , so dazzling , so marvellous a sorceress to her ; and all the while the sense of her own inferiority , her own worthlessness , her own boldness , her own debasement was growing upon her , eating sharply as aquafortis into brass , into the metal of her vanity and her pride , humiliating her unbearably , yet making her heart ache with a sad pathetic pity for herself . "
263089	263095	263096	263096	He	5548	" she asked , abruptly . "
263101	263102	263096	263096	He	5548	" "
263107	263116	263207	263207	you	5549	" cried Cigarette , with her old irony . "
263223	263224	263227	263227	you	5549	" "
263235	263236	263314	263314	you	5549	" "
263324	263439	263314	263314	you	5549	" Her auditor was silent ; she thought as the Vivandière thought , but the pride in her , the natural reticence and reserve of her class , made her shrink from discussing the history of one whom she knew — shrink from having any argument on his past or future with a saucy , rough , fiery young camp - follower , who had broken thus unceremoniously on her privacy . Yet she needed greatly to be able to trust Cigarette ; the child was the only means through which she could send him a warning that must be sent ; and there were a bravery and a truth in her which attracted the "
263442	263465	263467	263467	you	5563	" to whom she was as singular and novel a rarity as though she were some young savage of desert western isles . "
263471	263498	263778	263778	I	0	" said Cigarette , half sullenly , half passionately , for the words were wrenched out of her generosity , and choked her in their utterance , "
263634	263777	263778	263778	I	0	" Her hearer did not answer ; the words made her heart ache ; they cut her to the soul . It was not for the first time that the awful desolation of his future had been present before her ; but it was the first time that the fate to which she would pass away and leave him had been so directly in words before her . Cigarette , obeying the generous impulses of her better nature , and abandoning self with the same reckless impetuosity with which a moment before she would , if she could , have sacrificed her rival , saw the advantage gained , and pursued it with rapid skill . She was pleading against herself : no matter , in that instant she was capable of crucifying herself , and only remembering mercy to the absent . "
263782	263803	263999	263999	you	5571	" she went on , vehemently , for the utterance to which she forced herself was very cruel to her , "
264001	264102	263999	263999	you	5571	" Venetia heard her without interruption ; a great sadness came over her face as the vivid phrases followed each other . She was too absorbed in the subject of them to heed the challenge and the insolence of their manner . She knew that the Little One who spoke them loved him , though so tenacious to conceal her love ; and she was touched , not less by the magnanimity which , for his sake , sought to release him from the African service , than by the hopelessness of his coming years as thus prefigured before her . "
264108	264116	264232	264233	Madame Corona	815	" she replied , slowly and wearily . "
264217	264231	264232	264233	Madame Corona	815	" Cigarette 's flashing searching eyes bent all their brown light on her . "
264250	264251	264268	264268	you	815	" "
264273	264274	264268	264268	you	815	" "
264285	264286	264303	264303	them	5586	" "
264300	264301	264303	264303	them	5586	" "
264305	264324	264303	264303	them	5586	" Even in that moment her listener smiled involuntarily at the curt imperious tones , decisive as Napoléon 's "
264327	264335	264433	264433	You	815	" before the Passage of the Alps . "
264427	264432	264470	264470	He	688	" Cigarette smiled grimly . "
264478	264487	264613	264613	him	688	" Venetia gave an irrepressible gesture of pain . "
264534	264611	264613	264613	him	688	" Cigarette gave no movement of assent ; all the jealous rage in her flared up afresh to stifle the noble and unselfish instincts under which she had been led during the later moments . A coarse and impudent scoff rose to her tongue , but it remained unuttered ; she could not speak it under that glance , which held the evil in her in subjection , and compelled her reluctant reverence against her will . "
264620	264657	264691	264691	You	5598	" repeated Venetia , with the calm decision of one to whom any possibility of false interpretation of her motives never occurred , and who was habituated to the free action that accompanied an unassailable rank . "
264700	264701	264718	264718	Madame	815	" "
264720	264726	264738	264739	other messengers	5601	" said Cigarette , bitterly . "
264741	264757	264907	264907	I	0	" Venetia Corona looked at her steadfastly , with a certain contempt in the look . "
264793	264906	264907	264907	I	0	" The undeviating gentleness of the tone made the rebuke cut deeper , as her first rebuke had cut , than any sterner censure or more peremptory dismissal could have done . Cigarette stood irresolute , ashamed , filled with rage , torn by contrition , impatient , wounded , swayed by jealous rage and by the purer impulses she strove to stifle . The Cross she had tossed down caught her sight as it glittered on the carpet strewn over the hard earth ; she stooped and raised it ; the action sufficed to turn the tide with her impressionable , ardent , capricious nature : she would not disgrace that . "
264911	264918	265026	265028	A little tigress	5604	" she muttered in her throat ; "
264940	265025	265026	265028	A little tigress	5604	" Almost ere the words were uttered she had dashed aside the hangings before the tent - entrance , and had darted out into the night air . Venetia Corona gazed after the swiftly flying figure as it passed over the starlit ground , lost in amazement , in pity , and in regret , wondering afresh if she had only dreamt of this strange interview in the Algerian camp , which seemed to have come and gone with the blinding rapidity of lightning . "
265030	265034	265096	265096	she	5604	" she thought ; "
265106	265134	265096	265096	she	5604	" With the recollection came the remembrance of Cigarette 's words as to his own passion for herself , and she grew paler as it did so . "
265144	265148	265963	265964	Beau sire	5608	" she murmured . "
265159	265962	265963	265964	Beau sire	5608	" Yet she did not thrust the fancy from her with contemptuous nonchalance as she had done every other of the many passions she had excited and disdained ; it had a great sadness and a greater terror for her . She dreaded it unspeakably for him ; also perhaps , unconsciously , she dreaded it slightly for herself . She wished now that she had not sent for him . But it was done ; it was for sake of their old friendship ; and she was not one to vainly regret what was unalterable , or to desert what she deemed generous and right for the considerations of prudence or of egotism . Amidst the mirth , the noise , the festivity , which reigned throughout the camp as the men surrendered themselves to the enjoyment of the largesses of food and of wine allotted to them by their Marshal 's command in commemoration of Zarâila , one alone remained apart , silent and powerless to rouse himself even to the forced semblance , the forced endurance , of their mischief and their pleasure . They knew him well , and they also loved him too well to press such participation on him . They knew that it was no lack of sympathy with them that made him so grave amidst their mirth , so mute amidst their volubility . Some thought that he was sorely wounded by the delay of the honours promised him . Others , who knew him better , thought that it was the loss of his brother - exile which weighed on him , and made all the scene around him full of pain . None approached him ; but whilst they feasted in their tents , making the celebration of Zarâila equal to the Jour de Mazagran , he sat alone over a picket - fire on the far outskirts of the camp . His heart was sick within him . To remain here was to risk with every moment that ordeal of recognition which he so unutterably dreaded ; and to flee was to leave his name to the men , with whom he had served so long , covered with obloquy and odium , buried under all the burning shame and degradation of a traitor 's and deserter 's memory . The latter course was impossible to him ; the only alternative was to trust that the vastness of that great concrete body , of which he was one unit , would suffice to hide him from the discovery of the friend whose love he feared as he feared the hatred of no foe . He had not been seen as he had passed the flag - staff ; there was little fear that in the few remaining hours any chance could bring the illustrious guest of a Marshal to the outposts of the scattered camp . Yet he shuddered as he sat in the glow of the fire of pine - wood ; she was so near , and he could not behold her!—though he might never see her face again ; though they must pass out of Africa , home to the land that he desired as only exiles can desire , whilst he still remained silent , knowing that , until death should release him , there could be no other fate for him , save only this one , hard , bitter , desolate , uncompanioned , unpitied , unrewarded life . But to break his word as the price of his freedom was not possible to his nature or in his creed . This fate was , in chief , of his own making : he accepted it without rebellion , because rebellion would have been in this case both cowardice and self - pity . He was not conscious of any heroism in this ; it seemed to him the only course left to a man who , in losing the position , had not abandoned the instincts of a gentleman . The evening wore away , unmeasured by him ; the echoes of the soldiers ' mirth came dimly on his ear ; the laughter , and the songs , and the music were subdued into one confused murmur by distance ; there was nothing near him except a few tethered horses , and far away the mounted figure of the vidette who kept watch beyond the boundaries of the encampment . The fire burned on , for it had been piled hight before it was abandoned ; the little white dog of his regiment was curled at his feet ; he sat motionless , sunk in thought , with his head drooped upon his breast . The voice of Cigarette broke on his musing . "
265971	266045	265963	265964	Beau sire	5608	" He looked up wearily : could he never be at peace ! He did not notice that the tone of the greeting was rough and curt ; he did not notice that there was a stormy darkness , a repressed bitterness , stern and scornful , on the Little One 's face ; he only thought that the very dogs were left sometimes at rest and unchained , but a soldier never . "
266050	266068	265963	265964	Beau sire	5608	" repeated Cigarette , with imperious contempt . He rose , on the old instinct of obedience . "
266072	266133	266142	266142	I	0	" She stood looking at him without replying ; her mouth was tightly shut in a hard line that pressed inward all its soft and rosy prettiness . She was seeing how haggard his face was , how heavy his eyes , how full of fatigue his movements . Her silence recalled him to the memory of the past day . "
266152	266167	266187	266188	no one	6373	" he said , gently , as he laid his hand on her shoulder . "
266198	266220	266262	266262	I	0	" The very gentleness of the apology stung her like a scorpion ; she shook herself roughly out of his hold . "
266266	266267	266262	266262	I	0	" "
266271	266272	266262	266262	I	0	" "
266279	266280	266290	266290	Dam	852	" "
266288	266289	266322	266322	she	839	" "
266328	266329	266332	266332	she	839	" "
266336	266337	266353	266353	You	852	" "
266340	266352	266432	266432	She	839	" reiterated the Little One with a stamp of her boot . "
266443	266963	267311	267311	Madame	8858	" The vehement imperious phrases coursed in disorder one after another , rapid and harsh , and vibrating with a hundred repressed emotions . He paused one moment , doubting whether she did not play some trick upon him ; then , without a word , left her , and went rapidly through the evening shadows . Cigarette stood looking after him with a gaze that was very evil , almost savage , in its wrath , in its pain , in its fiery jealousy , that ached so hotly in her , and was chained down by that pride , which was as intense in the Vivandière of Algeria as ever it could be in any Duchess of a Court . Reckless , unfeminine , hardened , vitiated in much , as all her sex would have deemed , and capable of the utmost abandonment to her passion had it been returned , the haughty young soul of the child of the People was as sensitively delicate in this one thing as the purest and chastest amongst women could have been ; she dreaded above every other thing that he should ever suspect that she loved him , or that she desired his love . Her honour , her generosity , her pity for him , her natural instinct to do the thing that was right , even to her foes , any one of the unstudied and unanalysed qualities in her had made her serve him even at her rival 's bidding . But it had cost her none the less hardly because so manfully done ; none the less did all the violent ruthless hate , the vivid child - like fury , the burning , intolerable jealousy of her nature combat in her with the cruel sense of her own unlikeness with that beauty which had subdued even herself , and with that nobler impulse of self - sacrifice which grew side by side with the baser impulses of passion . As she crouched down by the side of the fire , all the gracious spiritual light that had been upon her face was gone ; there was something of the goaded , dangerous , sullen ferocity of a brave animal hard pressed and over driven . Her native generosity , the loyal disinterestedness of her love for him , had overborne the jealousy , the wounded vanity , and the desire of vengeance that reigned in her . Carried away by the first , she had , for the hour , risen above the last , and allowed the nobler wish to serve and rescue him prevail over the baser egotism . Nothing with her was ever premeditated ; all was the offspring of the caprice or the impulse of the immediate moment . And now the reaction followed : she was only sensible of the burning envy that consumed her of this woman who seemed to her more than mortal in her wonderful fair loveliness , in her marvellous difference from everything of their sex that the camp and the barrack ever showed . "
266982	267310	267361	267361	I	0	" she thought , as she sat by the dying embers . And she remembered once more the story of the Marseilles fisher - woman . She understood that terrible vengeance under the hot southern sun , beside the ruthless southern seas . Meanwhile , he , who so little knew or heeded how he occupied her heart , passed unnoticed through the movements of the military crowds , crossed the breadth that parted the encampment from the marquees of the Generals and their guests , gave the countersign and approached unarrested , and so far unseen save by the sentinels , the tents , of the Corona suite . The Marshal and his male visitors were still over their banquet wines ; she had withdrawn early , on the plea of fatigue ; there was no one to notice his visit except the men on guard , who concluded that he went by command . In the dusky light , for the moon was very young , and the flare of the torches made the shadows black and uncertain , no one recognised him ; the few soldiers stationed about saw one of their own troopers , and offered him no opposition , made him no question . He knew the password ; that was sufficient . The Levantine waiting near the entrance drew the tent - folds aside and signed to him to enter : another moment , and he was in the presence of her mistress , in that dim amber light from the standing candelabra , in that heavy soft - scented air perfumed from the aloe - wood burning in a brazier , through which he saw , half blinded at first coming from the darkness without , that face which subdued and dazzled even the antagonism and the lawlessness of Cigarette . He bowed low before her , preserving that distant ceremonial due from the rank he ostensibly held to hers . "
267326	267360	267364	267364	my	0	" She motioned to him to take a seat near to her , while the Levantine , who knew nothing of the English tongue , retired to the farther end of the tent . "
267367	267371	267364	267364	my	0	" she answered , "
267385	267386	267437	267437	I	0	" "
267390	267436	267437	267437	I	0	" She saw the blood forsake the bronzed fairness of his face , and leave a dusky pallor there . It wounded her as if she suffered herself . For the first time she believed what the Little One had said;—that this man loved her . "
267442	267469	267534	267534	I	0	" she continued , hurriedly , her graceful languor and tranquillity , for the first time , stirred and quickened by emotion , almost by embarrassment . "
267541	267563	267534	267534	I	0	" She paused ; he merely bent his head ; he could not trust the calmness of his voice in answer . "
267566	267570	267662	267662	him	476	" she continued , "
267639	267640	267662	267662	him	476	" "
267644	267648	267662	267662	him	476	" he muttered . "
267668	267669	267767	267767	I	0	" "
267771	267828	267863	267863	she	5636	" There was a slow weariness in the utterance of the words . She had said that she could not reflect on leaving him to such a fate as this of his in Africa without personal suffering , or without an effort to induce him to reconsider his decision to condemn himself to it for evermore . "
267833	267853	267895	267895	she	5636	" she went on , rapidly , to cover both the pain that she felt and that she dealt , "
267901	267902	267895	267895	she	5636	" "
267905	267927	267967	267967	she	5636	" he asked , wearily ; his thoughts could not stay for either pity or interest for her in this moment . "
267977	267978	267985	267985	her	5636	" "
267991	268010	268013	268013	she	5636	" He answered nothing ; the conviction stole on him that Cigarette hated her because he loved her . "
268019	268024	268239	268239	you	5639	" pursued his companion . "
268217	268237	268239	268239	you	5639	" His eyes turned on her with that dumb agony which once before had chilled her to the soul . "
268256	268281	268298	268298	you	5639	" A flush passed over her face , the first that the gaze of any man had ever brought there . She understood him . "
268284	268292	268798	268798	me	0	" she said , gently and hurriedly , "
268423	268796	268798	268798	me	0	" Her voice failed slightly over the last words ; she could not think with calmness of the destiny that he accepted . Involuntarily some prescience of pain that would for ever pursue her own life unless his were rescued lent an intense earnestness , almost entreaty , to her argument . She did not bear him love as yet ; she had seen too little of him , too lately only known him as her equal ; but there were in her , stronger than she knew , a pity , a tenderness , a regret , an honour for him that drew her towards him with an indefinable attraction , and would sooner or later warm and deepen into love . Already it was sufficient , though she deemed it but compassion and friendship , to make her feel that an intolerable weight would lie heavy on her future if his should remain condemned to this awful isolation and oblivion while she alone of all the world should know and hold his secret . He started from her side as he heard , and paced to and fro the narrow limits of the tent like a caged animal . For the first time it grew a belief to him , in his thoughts , that were he free , were he owner of his heritage , he could rouse her heart from its long repose and make her love him with the soft and passionate warmth of his dead Arab mistress — a thing that had been as distant from her negligence and her pride as warmth from the diamond or the crystal . He felt as if the struggle would kill him . He had but to betray his brother , and he would be unchained from his torture ; he had but to break his word , and he would be at liberty . All the temptation that had before beset him paled and grew as nought beside this possibility of the possession of her love which dawned upon him now . She , knowing nothing of this which moved him , believed only that he weighed her words in hesitation , and strove to turn the balance . "
268800	268806	268891	268891	I	0	" she said , softly . "
268932	268946	269247	269247	me	0	" He turned on her almost fiercely in the suffering she dealt him : "
269087	269245	269247	269247	me	0	" He threw himself down beside her as the incoherent words poured out , his arms flung across the pile of cushions on which he had been seated , his face hidden on them . His teeth clenched on his tongue till the blood flowed ; he felt that if the power of speech remained with him he should forswear every law that had bound him to silence , and tell her all , whatever the cost . She looked at him , she heard him , moved to a greater agitation than ever had had sway over her , for the first time the storm - winds that swept by her did not leave her passionless and calm ; this man 's whole future was in her hands . She could bid him seek happiness , dishonoured ; or cleave to honour , and accept wretchedness for ever . It was a fearful choice to hold . "
269253	269259	269247	269247	me	0	" he said , vehemently . "
269269	269278	269283	269284	The woman	1116	" She gave a gesture almost of fear . "
269296	269297	269311	269311	I	0	" "
269309	269310	269315	269315	You	0	" "
269325	269326	269345	269345	I	0	" "
269349	269353	269360	269360	you	0	" She shuddered . "
269365	269366	269804	269804	You	5669	" "
269622	269803	269804	269804	You	5669	" As she heard , all the warmth , all the life , faded out of her face ; it grew as white as his own , and her lips parted slightly , as though to draw her breath was oppressive . The wild words overwhelmed her with their surprise not less than they shocked her with their despair . An intense truth vibrated through them , a truth that pierced her and reached her heart as no other supplication ever had done . She had no love for him yet , or she thought not ; she was very proud , and resisted such passions ; but in that moment the thought swept by her that such love might be possible . It was the nearest submission to it she had ever given . She heard him in unbroken silence ; she kept silence long after he had spoken . So far as her courage and her dignity could be touched with it , she felt something akin to terror at the magnitude of the choice left to her . "
269813	269817	269846	269846	You	5669	" she murmured . "
269840	269845	269938	269938	I	0	" He interrupted her : "
269876	269937	269944	269944	I	0	" She looked at him full in the eyes with the old , fearless , haughty instinct of refusal to all such entreaty , which had made her so indifferent — and many said so pitiless — to all . At his gaze , however , her own changed and softened , grew shadowed , and then wandered from him . "
269950	270023	270046	270046	I	0	" The words were very low : she was too truthful to conceal from him what half dawned on herself — the possibility that , more in his presence and under different circumstances , she might feel her heart go to him with a warmer and a softer impulse than that of friendship . The heroism of his life had moved her greatly . His head dropped down again upon his arms . "
270049	270361	270046	270046	I	0	" The tears that had gathered in her eyes fell slowly down over her colourless cheeks ; she looked at him with a pity that made her heart ache with a sorrow only less than his own . The grief was for him chiefly : yet something of it for herself . Some sense of present bitterness that fell on her from his fate , some foreboding of future regret that would inevitably and for ever follow her when she left him to his loneliness and his misery , smote on her with a weightier pang than any her caressed and cloudless existence had encountered . Love was dimly before her as the possibility he called it ; remote , unrealised , still unacknowledged , but possible under certain conditions , only known as such when it was also impossible through circumstance . He had suffered silently ; endured strongly ; fought greatly : these were the only means through which any man could have ever reached her sympathy , her respect , her tenderness . Yet though a very noble and a very generous woman , she was also a woman of the world . She knew that it was not for her to say even thus much to a man who was in one sense well - nigh a stranger , and who stood under the accusation of a crime whose shadow he allowed to rest on him unmoved . She felt sick at heart : she longed unutterably , with a warmer longing than had moved her previously , to bid him , at all cost , lay bare his past , and throw off the imputed shame that hung on him . Yet all the grand traditions of her race forbade her to counsel the acceptance of an escape whose way led through a forfeiture of honour . "
270368	270396	270410	270410	I	0	" he muttered at last once more . She rose with what was almost a gesture of despair , and thrust the gold hair off her temples . "
270419	270567	270573	270573	you	0	" There was an accent almost of passion in her voice ; she felt that so greatly did she desire his deliverance , his justification , his return to all which was his own , desired even his presence amongst them in her own world , that she could no longer give him calm and unbiased judgment . He heard , and the burning tide of a new joy rushed on him , checked almost ere it was known , by the dread lest for her sake she should ever give him so much pity that such pity became love . He started to his feet and looked down imploringly into her eyes — a look under which her own never quailed or drooped , but which they answered with that same regard which she had given him when she had declared her faith in his innocence . "
270579	270607	270681	270681	you	0	" She moved slightly from him ; her face was very white still , and her voice , though serenely sustained , shook as it answered him : "
270690	270701	270732	270732	you	0	" A bitter sigh broke from him as he heard . "
270738	270746	270732	270732	you	0	" A flush passed over her face . "
270760	270761	270732	270732	you	0	" "
270767	270790	270792	270792	you	0	" She was silent ; they were , in a sense , nearer to love than any emotion she had ever known . "
270796	270802	270898	270898	you	0	" he pursued , passionately — "
270885	270886	270924	270924	you	0	" "
270929	270930	270942	270942	I	0	" "
270961	270962	270942	270942	I	0	" "
270968	270972	270996	270997	your friend	7065	" she murmured ; "
271000	271001	270996	270997	your friend	7065	" "
271012	271013	270996	270997	your friend	7065	" "
271016	271017	271090	271091	Lord Royallieu	517	" "
271040	271089	271090	271091	Lord Royallieu	517	" There was desperation , almost ferocity , in the answer ; she was moved and shaken by it — not to fear , for fear was not in her nature , but to something of awe , and something of the despairing hopelessness that was in him . "
271093	271129	271172	271172	You	0	" she said , slowly , as if the familiar name were some tie between them , some cause of excuse for these , the only love - words she had ever heard without disdain and rejection—"Lord
271180	271302	271326	271326	I	0	" He stood mute and motionless before her , his head sunk on his chest . He knew that she rebuked him justly ; he knew that he had broken through every law he had proscribed himself , and that he had sinned against that code of chivalry which should have made her sacred from such words whilst they were those he could not utter , nor she hear , except in secresy and shame . Unless he could stand justified in her sight and in that of all men , he had no right to seek to wring out tenderness from her regret and from her pity . Yet all his heart went out to her in one irrepressible entreaty . "
271324	271325	271326	271326	I	0	" "
271330	271343	271730	271730	You	5678	" she said , gently , whilst her voice grew very sweet . "
271385	271697	271730	271730	You	5678	" A long silence fell between them ; where she leaned back amongst her cushions , her face was turned from him . He stood motionless in the shadow , his head still dropped upon his breast , his breathing loud and slow and hard . To speak of love to her was forbidden to him , yet the insidious temptation wound closer and closer round his strength . He had only to betray the man he had sworn to protect , and she would know his innocence , she would hear his passion ; he would be free , and she — he grew giddy as the thought rose before him — she might , with time , be brought to give him other tenderness than that of friendship . He seemed to touch the very supremacy of joy , to reach it almost with his hand , to have honours , and peace , and all the glory of her haughty loveliness , and all the sweetness of her subjugation , and all the soft delights of passion before him in their golden promise : — and he was held back in bands of iron , he was driven out from them desolate and accurst . Unlike Cain , he had suffered in his brother 's stead , yet , like Cain , he was branded , and could only wander out into the darkness and the wilderness . She watched him many minutes , he unconscious of her gaze ; and whilst she did so , many conflicting emotions passed over the colourless delicacy of her features ; her eyes were filled and shadowed with many altering thoughts ; her heart was waking from its rest , and the high , generous , unselfish nature in her strove with her pride of birth , her dignity of habit . "
271700	271721	271822	271822	You	5678	" she said , softly , with the old imperial command of her voice subdued , though not wholly banished . "
271802	271821	272102	272102	God	565	" Her voice sank inaudible for the instant ; she recovered her self - control with an effort . "
271976	272101	272136	272136	me	0	" She stretched her hands towards him with that same gesture with which she had first declared her faith in his guiltlessness ; the tears trembled in her voice and swam in her eyes . As she had said , she suffered for him exceedingly . He , hearing those words which breathed the only pity that had never humiliated him , and the loyal trust which was but the truer because the sincerity of faith in lieu of the insanity of love dictated it , made a blind , staggering , unconscious movement of passionate dumb agony . He seized her hands in his and held them close against his breast one instant , against the loud hard panting of his aching heart . "
272142	272808	272881	272881	I	0	" With another instant he had left the tent and passed out into the red glow of the torchlit evening . And Venetia Corona dropped her proud head down upon the silken cushions where his own had rested , and wept as women weep over their dead — in such emotion as had never come to her in all the course of her radiant , victorious , and imperious life . It seemed to her as if she had seen him slain in cold blood , and had never lifted her hand or her voice against his murder . His voice rang in her ear ; his face was before her with its white still rigid anguish ; the scorching accents of his avowal of love seemed to search her very heart . If this man perished in any of the thousand perils of war she would for ever feel herself his assassin . She had his secret , she had his soul , she had his honour in her hands ; and she could do nothing better for them both than to send him from her to eternal silence , to eternal solitude ! Her thoughts grew unbearable ; she rose impetuously from her couch and paced to and fro the narrow confines of her tent . Her tranquillity was broken down ; her pride was abandoned ; her heart , at length , was reached and sorely wounded . The only man she had ever found , whom it would have been possible to her to have loved , was one already severed from her by a fate almost more hideous than death . And yet , in her loneliness , the colour flushed back into her face ; her eyes gathered some of their old light ; one dreaming shapeless fancy floated vaguely through her mind . If , in the years to come , she knew him in all ways worthy , and learned to give him back this love he bore her , it was in her to prove that love at no matter what cost to her pride and her lineage . If this perfect innocence were made clear in her own sight , there was greatness and there was unselfishness enough in her nature to make her capable of regarding alone his martyrdom and his heroism , and disregarding the opinion of the world . If hereafter she grew to find his presence the necessity of her life , and his sacrifice of that nobility , and of that purity , she now believed it , she — proud as she was with the twin pride of lineage and of character — would be capable of incurring the odium and the marvel of all who knew her by uniting her fate to his own , by making manifest her honour and her tenderness for him , though men saw in him only a soldier of the Empire , only a base - born trooper , beneath her , as Riom beneath the daughter of D'Orléans . She was of a brave nature , of a great nature , of a daring courage , and of a superb generosity . Abhorring dishonour , full of glory in the stainless history of her race , and tenacious of the dignity and of the magnitude of her House , she yet was too courageous and too haughty a woman not to be capable of braving calumny if conscious of her own pure rectitude beneath it , not to be capable of incurring false censure , if encountered in the path of justice and of magnanimity . It was possible , even on herself it dawned as possible , that so great might become her compassion and her tenderness for this man , that she would , in some distant future , when the might of his love and the severity of his suffering should prevail with her , say to him : "
272899	273082	272881	272881	I	0	" If ever she loved him exceedingly , she would become capable of this sacrifice from the strength , and the graciousness , and the fearlessness of her nature , and such love was not so distant from her as she thought . Outside her tent there was a peculiar mingling of light and shadow ; of darkness from the moonless and how cloud - covered sky , of reddened warmth from the tall burning pine - boughs thrust into the soil in lieu of other illumination . The atmosphere was hot from the flames , and chilly with the breath of the night winds ; it was oppressively still , though from afar off the sounds of laughter in the camp still echoed , and near at hand the dull and steady tramp of the sentinels fell on the hard parched soil . Into that blended heat and cold , dead blackness and crimson glare , he reeled out from her presence ; drunk with pain as deliriously as men grow drunk with raki . The challenge rang on the air : "
273087	273110	272881	272881	I	0	" He never heard it . Even the old long - accustomed habits of a soldier 's obedience were killed in him . "
273115	273177	273181	273181	I	0	" the challenge rang again . Still he never heard , but went on blindly . From where the tents stood , there was a stronger breadth of light through which he had passed , and was passing still — a light strong enough for it to be seen whence he came , but not strong enough to show his features . "
273184	273301	273304	273307	one of my men	5690	" The sentinel brought the weapon to his shoulder and took a calm , close , sure aim . Cecil did not speak ; the password he had forgotten as though he had never heard or never given it . Another figure than that of the soldier on guard came out of the shadow , and stood between him and the sentinel . It was that of Châteauroy ; he was mounted on his grey horse and wrapped in his military cloak , about to go the round of the cavalry camp . Their eyes met in the wavering light like the glow from a furnace - mouth : in a glance they knew each other . "
273309	273318	273304	273307	one of my men	5690	" said the chief carelessly to the sentinel . "
273326	273336	273339	273339	you	0	" The guard saluted , and resumed his beat . "
273346	273347	273339	273339	you	0	" "
273353	273354	273358	273358	you	0	" "
273362	273368	273386	273386	you	0	" There was no reply . "
273377	273384	273402	273402	you	0	" There was no reply still . "
273405	273453	273472	273472	I	0	" There was again no answer . Châteauroy 's teeth ground out a furious oath ; yet a flash of brutal delight glittered in his eyes . At last he had hounded down this man , so long out of his reach , into disobedience and contumacy . "
273465	273471	273472	273472	I	0	" he demanded once more . "
273477	273517	273660	273660	You	0	" The answer , given at length , was tranquil , low , slowly and distinctly uttered , in a deliberate refusal , in a deliberate defiance . The dark and evil countenance above him grew livid with fury . "
273603	273659	273962	273962	You	5705	" Cecil 's face changed terribly as the vile words were spoken . With the light and rapid spring of a leopard , he reached the side of his commander , one hand on the horse 's mane , the other on the wrist of his chief , that it gripped like an iron vice . "
273697	273961	274115	274115	him	0	" And , as he spoke , with his left hand he smote the lips that had blasphemed against her . It was broken asunder at last — all the long and bitter patience , all the calm and resolute endurance , all the undeviating serenity beneath provocation , which had never yielded through twelve long years , but which had borne with infamy and with tyranny in such absolute submission for sake of those around him , who would revolt at his sign , and be slaughtered for his cause . The promise he had given to endure all things for their sakes — the sakes of his soldiery , of his comrades — was at last forgotten . All he remembered was the villany that dared touch her name , the shame that through him was breathed on her . Rank , duty , bondage , consequence , all were forgotten in that one instant of insult that mocked in its odious lie at her purity . He was no longer the soldier bound in obedience to submit to the indignities that his chief chose to heap on him ; he was a gentleman who defended a woman 's honour , a man who avenged a slur on the life that he loved . Châteauroy wrenched his wrist out of the hold that crushed it , and drew his pistol . Cecil knew that the laws of active service would hold him but justly dealt with if the shot laid him dead in that instant for his act and his words . "
273990	274113	274115	274115	him	0	" And he stood erect , patient , motionless , looking into his chief 's eyes with a calm disdain , with an unuttered challenge , that , for the first moment , wrung something of savage respect and of sullen admiration out from the soul of his great foe . He did not fire ; it was the only time in which any trait of abstinence from cruelty had ever been seen in him . He signed to the soldiers of the guard with one hand , whilst with the other he still covered with his pistol the man whom martial law would have allowed him to have shot down , or have cut down , at his horse 's feet . "
274117	274395	274396	274396	I	0	" he said , simply . Cecil offered no resistance ; he let them seize and disarm him without an effort at the opposition which could have been but a futile , unavailing , trial of brute force . He dreaded lest there should be one sound that should reach her in that tent where the triad of standards drooped in the dusky distance . He had been , moreover , too long beneath the yoke of this despotic and irresponsible authority to waste breath or to waste dignity in vain contest with the absolute and the immutable . He was content with what he had done — content to have met once , not as soldier to chief , but as man to man , the tyrant who held his fate . For once , beneath the spur of that foul outrage to the dignity and the innocence of the woman he had quitted , he had allowed a passionate truth to force its way through the barriers of rank and the bonds of subservience . Insult to himself he had borne as the base prerogative of his superior , but insult to her he had avenged with the vengeance of equal to equal , of the one who loved , upon the one who calumniated , her . And as he sat in the darkness of the night with the heavy tramp of his guards for ever on his ear , there was peace rather than rebellion in his heart — the peace of one heart sick with strife and with temptation , who beholds in death a merciful ending to the ordeal of existence . "
274405	274409	274396	274396	I	0	" he thought . "
274425	274852	274396	274396	I	0	" For this was the chief dread which hung on him , that she should ever know , and in knowing , suffer for his sake . The night rolled on , the army around him knew nothing of what had happened . Châteauroy , conscious of his own coarse guilt against the guest of his Marshal , kept the matter untold and undiscovered , under the plea that he desired not to destroy the harmony of the general rejoicing . The one or two field - officers with whom he took counsel agreed to the wisdom of letting the night pass away undisturbed . The accused was the idol of his own squadron : there was no gauge what might not be done by troops heated with excitement and drunk with wine , if they knew that their favourite comrade had set the example of insubordination , and would be sentenced to suffer for it . Beyond these , and the men employed in his arrest and guard , none knew what had chanced ; not the soldiery beneath that vast sea of canvas , many of whom would have rushed headlong to mutiny and to destruction at his word ; not the woman who in the solitude of her wakeful hours was haunted by the memory of his love - words , and felt steal on her the unacknowledged sense that , if his future were left to misery , happiness could never more touch her own ; not the friend of his early days , laughing and drinking gaily with the officers of the staff . None knew ; not even Cigarette . She sat alone , so far away that none sought her out , beside the picket - fire that had long died out , with the little white dog of Zarâila curled on the scarlet folds of her skirt . Her arms rested on her knees , and her temples were leant on her hands , tightly twisted amongst the dark silken curls of her boyish hair . Her face had the same dusky savage intensity upon it ; and she never once moved from that rigid attitude . She had the Cross on her heart — the idol of her long desire , the star to which her longing eyes had looked up , ever since her childhood , through the reek of carnage and the smoke of battle : and she would have flung it away like dross to have had his lips touch hers once with love . "
274858	274865	274396	274396	I	0	" she muttered in her throat , "
274871	275005	274396	274396	I	0	" And she knew herself mad ; for the desires and the delights of love die swiftly , but the knowledge of honour abides always . Love would have made her youth sweet with an unutterable gladness , to glide from her and leave her weary , dissatisfied , forsaken . But that Cross , the gift of her country , the symbol of her heroism , would be with her always , and light her for ever with the honour of which it was the emblem ; and if her life should last until youth should pass away , and age come , and with age death , her hand would wander to it on her dying bed , and she would smile as she died to hear the living watchers murmur : "
275018	275113	275137	275137	I	0	" She knew this : but she was young ; she was a woman - child , she had the ardour of voluptuous youth in her veins , she had the desolation of abandoned youth in her heart . And honour looked so cold beside love ! She rose impetuously ; the night was far spent , the camp was very still , the torches had long died out , and a streak of dawn was visible in the east . She stood awhile looking very earnestly across the wide black city of tents . "
275132	275136	275142	275144	Blanc - Bec	979	" she thought . "
275146	276216	276814	276814	woman	3174	" Blanc - Bec was the old soldier of the Army of Italy . In a brief while she had saddled and bridled Etoile - Filante , and ridden out of the camp without warning or farewell to any : she was as free to come and to go as though she were a bird on the wing . Thus Cigarette went , knowing nothing of his fate . And with the sunrise went also the woman whom he loved — in ignorance . The warm transparent light of an African autumnal noon shone down through the white canvas roof of a great tent in the heart of the encamped divisions at the head - quarters of the Army of the South . Within the tent there was a densely packed throng — an immense , close , hushed , listening crowd , of which every man wore the uniform of France , and of which the mute undeviating attention , forbidden by discipline alike to be broken by sound of approval or of dissent , had in it something that was almost terrible , contrasted with the vivid eagerness in their eyes and the strained absorption of their countenances ; for they were in court , and that court was the Conseil de Guerre of their own southern camp . The prisoner was arraigned on the heaviest charge that can be laid against the soldier of any army ; and yet , as the many eyes of the military crowd turned on him where he stood surrounded by his guard , his crime against his chief was forgotten , and they only remembered — Zarâila . Many of those present had seen him throughout that day of blood , at the head of his decimated squadron , with the guidon held aloft above every foe ; to them , that tall slender form standing there , with a calm weary dignity that had nothing of the passion of the mutinous , or the consciousness of the criminal , in its serene repose , had shed upon it the lustre of a heroism that made them ready almost to weep like women that the death of a mutineer should be the sole answer given by France to the saviour of her honour . He preserved entire reticence in court . The instant the acte d ' accusation had been read to him , he had seen that his chief would not dare to couple with it the proud pure name he had dared to outrage ; his most bitter anxiety was thus at an end . For all the rest , he was tranquil . No case could be clearer , briefer , less complex , more entirely incapable of defence . The soldiers of the guard gave evidence as to the violence and fury of the assault . The sentinel bore witness to having heard the refusal to reply ; a moment after he had seen the attack made , and the blow given . The accuser merely stated that , meeting his sous - officier out of the bounds of the cavalry camp , he had asked him where he had been , and why he was there , and , on his commanding an answer , had been assaulted in the manner described , with violence sufficient to have cost his life had not the guard been so near at hand . When questioned as to what motive he could assign for the act , he replied that he considered his corporal had always incited evil feeling and mutinous conduct in the squadrons , and had , he believed , that day attributed to himself his failure to receive the Cross . The statement passed without contradiction by the prisoner , who , to the interrogations and entreaties of his legal défenseur , only replied that the facts were stated accurately as they occurred , and that his reasons for the deed he declined to assert . When once more questioned as to his country and his past by the president , he briefly declined to give answer . When asked if the names by which he was enrolled were his own , he replied that they were two of his baptismal names , which had served his purpose on entering the army . When asked if he accepted as true the charge of exciting sedition among the troops , he replied that it was so little true that over and over again the men would have mutinied if he had given them a sign , and that he had continually induced them to submit to discipline sheerly by force of his own example . When interrogated as to the cause of the language he had used to his commanding officer , he said briefly that the language deserved the strongest censure as from a soldier to his colonel , but that it was justified as he had used it , which was as man to man , though he was aware the plea availed nothing in military law , and was impermissible for the safety of the service . When it was inquired of him if he had not repeatedly inveighed against his commanding officer for severity , he briefly denied it ; no man had ever heard him say a syllable that could have been construed into complaint ; at the same time he observed that all the squadrons knew perfectly well that personal enmity and oppression had been shown him by his chief throughout the whole time of his association with the regiment . When pressed as to the cause that he assigned for this , he gave , in a few comprehensive outlines , the story of the capture and the deliverance of the Emir 's bride . This was all that could be elicited from him ; and even this was answered only out of deference to the authority of the court , and from his unwillingness to set a bad example before the men with whom he had served so long . When it was finally demanded of him if he had aught to urge in his own extenuation , he paused a moment , with a gaze under which even hard eagle eyes grew restless , looked across to Châteauroy , and addressed his antagonist rather than the president : "
276284	276688	276814	276814	woman	3174	" That was all which he answered ; and neither his counsel nor his accusers could extort another syllable from him . He knew that what he had done was justified to his own conscience ; but he did not seek to dispute that it was unjustifiable in military law . True , had all been told , it was possible enough that his judges would exonerate him morally , even if they condemned him legally ; his act would be seen blameless as a man 's , even whilst still punishable as a soldier 's : but to purchase immunity for himself at cost of bringing the fairness of her fame into the coarse babble of men 's tongues was an alternative , craven and shameful , which never even once glanced across his thoughts . He had kept faith to a woman whom he had known heartless and well - nigh worthless ; it was not to the woman whom he loved with all the might of an intense passion , and whom he knew pure and glorious as the morning sun , that he would break his faith now . All through the three days that the Conseil sat , his look and his manner never changed ; the first was quite calm , though very weary , the latter courteous but resolute with the unchanged firmness of one who knew his own past action justified ; for the rest , many noticed that , during the chief of the long exhausting hours of his examination and his trial , his thoughts seemed far away , and he appeared to recall them to the present with difficulty , and with nothing of the vivid suspense of an accused , whose life and death swung in the judgment - balance . In truth , he had no dread as he had no hope left ; he knew well enough that by the blow which had vindicated her honour he had forfeited his own existence . All he wished was that his sentence had been dealt without this formula of debate and of delay , which could have issue but in one end . There was not one man in court who was not more moved than he , more quick to terror and regret for his doom . To many amongst his comrades who had learned to love the gentle , silent "
276691	276813	276814	276814	woman	3174	" who bore every hardship so patiently , and humanised them so imperceptibly by the simple force of an unvaunted example , those three days were torture . Wild , brutal brigands , whose year was one long razzia of plunder , rapine , and slaughter , felt their lips tremble like young girls ' when they asked how the issue went for him ; and blood - stained marauders , who thought as little of assassination for a hidden pot of gold as butchers of drawing a knife across a sheep 's throat , grew still and fear - stricken with a great awe when the muttering passed through the camp that they would see no more amongst their ranks that "
276817	276939	276814	276814	woman	3174	" which they had beheld so often foremost in the fight , with a look on it that thrilled their hearts like their forbidden chant of the Marseillaise . For when the third day closed , they knew that he must die . And there were men , hard as steel , ravenous of blood as vultures , who , when they heard that sentence given , choked great sobs down into the cavernous depths of their sinewy breasts ; but he never gave sigh or sign . He never moved once while the decree of death was read to him ; and there was no change in the weary calmness of his eyes . He bent his head in acquiescence . "
276943	277699	277701	277701	I	0	" he said , simply . It seemed well to him : dead , his secret would lie in the grave with him , and the long martyrdom of his life be ended . In the brightness of the noon Cigarette leaned out of her little oval casement that framed her head like an old black oak carving — a head with the mellow bloom on its cheeks , and the flash of scarlet above its dark curls , and the robin - like grace of poise and balance in it as it hung out there in the sun . Cigarette had been there a whole hour in thought ; she!—who never had wasted a moment in meditation or reverie , and who found the long African day all too short for her busy , abundant , joyous life , that was always full of haste and work , just as a bird 's will seem so , though the bird have no more to do than to fly at its will through summer air , and feed at its will from brook and from berry , from a ripe ear of the corn or from a deep cup of the lily . For the first time she was letting time drift away in the fruitless labour of vain purposeless thought , because , for the first time also , happiness was not with her . They were gone for ever — all the elastic joyaunce , all the free fair hours , all the dauntless gaiety of childhood , all the sweet harmonious laughter of a heart without a care . They were gone for ever ; for the touch of love and of pain had been laid on her ; and never again would her radiant eyes smile cloudlessly like the young eagle 's at a sun that rose but to be greeted as only youth can greet another dawn of a life that is without a shadow . And she leaned wearily here with her cheek lying on the cold grey Moorish stone ; the colour and the brightness were in the rays of the noon , in the rich hues of her hair and her mouth , in the scarlet glow of her dress : there was no brightness in her face . The eyes were vacant as they watched the green lizard glide over the wall beyond , and the lips were parted with a look of unspeakable fatigue ; the tire , not of the limbs , but of the heart . She had come thither hoping to leave behind her on the desert wind that alien care , that new strange passion , which sapped her strength , and stung her pride , and made her evil with such murderous lust of vengeance ; but they were with her still . Only something of the deadly biting ferocity of jealousy had changed into a passionate longing to be as that woman was who had his love ; into a certain hopeless sickening sense of having for ever lost that which alone could have given her such beauty and such honour in the sight of men as those this woman had . To her it seemed impossible that this patrician who had his passion should not return it . To the child of the camp , though she often mocked at caste , all the inexorable rules , all the reticent instincts of caste , were things unknown . She would have thought love could have bridged over any gulf ; she would have failed to comprehend all the thousand reasons which would have forbidden any bond between the great aristocrat and a man of low grade and of dubious name . She only thought that the one she envied was free , was powerful , was high enough to hold and exercise an irresponsible will ; she only thought of love as she had always seen it , quickly born , hotly cherished , wildly indulged , and without tie or restraint . And she had left them together ! Her heart ached , her lips grew white , her eyes through their new sadness had something of the sullen , savage fire with which she had levelled her pistol at Venetia Corona , where she leaned out from the oval attic - lattice above the deserted Moorish court below — the only thing of life and youth in the grim desolation of the God - forgotten place . "
277707	277817	277822	277822	my	0	" she mused . To the nature that felt the ferocity of the vendetta a right and a due , and to the jealous fever that still flamed after some such awful retribution as that which the fisher - girl of Marseilles had dealt by the southern sea , there was wounding humiliation in her knowledge that she had left her rival unharmed , and had come hither , out from his sight and his presence , lest he should see in her one glimpse of that folly which she would have killed herself under her own steel rather than have betrayed either for his contempt or his compassion . "
277825	278270	278275	278275	thou	5714	" she mused : in that oppressive noon , in that grey and lonely place , in that lofty tower - solitude , where there was nothing between her and the hot , hard , cruel blue of the heavens , vengeance looked the only thing that was left her , the only means whereby that void in her heart could be filled , that shame in her life be washed out . To love ! and to love a man who had no love for her , whose eyes only beheld another 's face , whose ears only thirsted for another 's voice ! Its degradation stamped her a traitress in her own sight — traitress to her code , to her pride , to her country , to her flag ! And yet at the core of her heart so tired a pang was aching ! She who had gloried in being the child of the whole people , the daughter of the whole army , felt lonely and abandoned , as though she were some bird which an hour ago had been flying in all its joy amongst its brethren , and now , maimed with one shot , had fallen with broken pinion and torn plumage to lie alone upon the sand and die . The touch of a bird 's wing brushing her hair brought the dreamy comparison to her wandering thoughts . She started and lifted her head ; it was a blue carrier - pigeon , one of the many she fed at that casement , and the swiftest and surest of several she sent with messages for the soldiers between the various stations and corps . She had forgotten she had left the bird at the encampment . She caressed it absently , while the tired creature sank down on her bosom ; then only she saw that there was a letter beneath one wing . She unloosed it , and looked at it without being able to tell its meaning ; she could not read a word , printed or written . Military habits were too strong with her for the arrival not to change her reverie into action ; whoever it was for , it must be seen . She gave the pigeon water and grain , then wound her way down the dark , narrow stairs , through the height of the tower , out into the passage below . She found an old French cobbler sitting at a stall in a casement stitching leather ; he was her customary reader and scribe in this quarter . She touched him with the paper . "
278281	278293	278275	278275	thou	5714	" He took it , and looked first at the superscription . "
278313	278318	278326	278327	a scholar	5716	" Cigarette nodded listlessly . "
278329	278335	278326	278327	a scholar	5716	" she answered , absently . "
278339	278345	278446	278446	I	0	" And he read aloud : "
278454	278548	278446	278446	I	0	" So the boy - Zouave 's scrawl , crushed , and blotted , and written with great difficulty , ran in its brief phrases that the slow muttering of the old shoemaker drew out in tedious length . Cigarette heard ; she never made a movement or gave a sound , but all the blood fled out of her brilliant face , leaving it horribly blanched beneath its brown sun - scorch ; and her eyes distended , senseless , sightless , were fastened on the old man 's slowly moving mouth . "
278553	278615	278446	278446	I	0	" she said , simply , when all was ended . He started , and looked up at her face : the voice had not one accent of its own tones left . He obeyed , and read it once more to the end . Then a loud shuddering sigh escaped her , like the breath of one stifling under flames . "
278618	278624	278446	278446	I	0	" she said , vacantly . "
278627	278634	278671	278671	you	10690	" The old man rose hurriedly . "
278641	278653	278671	278671	you	10690	" Her eyes turned on him without any consciousness in them . "
278661	278665	278671	278671	you	10690	" she muttered . "
278677	278678	278688	278688	thou	5722	" "
278694	278710	278942	278942	You	5725	" Cigarette laughed — a laugh whose echo thrilled horribly through the lonely Moresco courtway . "
278737	278941	278942	278942	You	5725	" She was still a moment ; her mouth quivering as though she were under physical torture , her strained eyes fastened on the empty air , the veins in her throat swelling and throbbing till they glowed to purple . Then she crushed the letter in one hand , and flew , fleet as any antelope , through the streets of the Moorish quarter , and across the city to the quay . The people ever gave way before her ; but now they scattered like frightened sheep from her path . There was something that terrified them in that bloodless horror set upon her face , and in that fury of resistless speed with which she rushed upon her way . Once only in her headlong career through the throngs she paused ; it was as one face , on which the strong light of the noontide poured , came before her . The senseless look changed in her eyes ; she wheeled out of her route , and stopped before the man who had thus arrested her . He was leaning idly over the stall of a Turkish bazaar , and her hand grasped his arm before he saw her . "
278947	278951	278954	278954	you	5725	" she muttered . "
278958	278969	278981	278981	You	5725	" He made no answer ; he was too amazed . "
278976	278980	278990	278990	you	5725	" she persisted . "
278994	278995	278990	278990	you	5725	" "
278999	279000	279093	279093	fool	5728	" "
279016	279089	279093	279093	fool	5728	" Her eyes were fastened entirely on him ; keen , ruthless , fierce , in this moment , as a hawk 's . He grew pale , and murmured an incoherent denial . He sought to shaked her off , first gently , then more rudely ; he called her mad , and tried to fling her from him ; but the lithe fingers only wound themselves closer on his arm . "
279095	279136	279175	279175	he	5730	" she muttered ; and there was that in the accent that lent a strange force and dignity in that moment to the careless and mischievous plaything of the soldiery — force that overcame him , dignity that overawed him . "
279187	279249	279175	279175	he	5730	" With a stifled cry , the other recoiled from her ; he never doubted that she spoke the truth , none could who had looked upon her face . Cigarette smiled — a smile that had the same terrible meaning in it as the laugh that had curdled the old Frenchman 's veins in the stillness of the Moorish passage . "
279256	279262	279175	279175	he	5730	" she said , curtly . "
279271	279326	279175	279175	he	5730	" She thrust before him the paper the pigeon had brought ; his hand trembled sorely as he held it : he believed in that moment that this strange creature , half soldier , half woman , half brigand , half child , knew all his story and all his shame from his brother . "
279329	279347	279354	279354	I	0	" he echoed hoarsely as she had done , when he had read on to the end . "
279357	279396	279397	279397	He	5732	" She drew him out of the thoroughfare into a dark recess within the bazzar ; he submitted unresistingly ; he was filled with the horror , the remorse , the overwhelming shock of his brother 's doom . "
279402	279411	279397	279397	He	5732	" she said , with a strange calmness . "
279447	279448	279490	279491	the Révision	980	" "
279464	279482	279521	279521	you	5738	" Her lips were parched like the desert sand as her dry hard words came through them . "
279529	279530	279521	279521	you	5738	" "
279536	279605	279606	279606	You	0	" She was silent ; looking at him fixedly , it did not seem to her strange that she should thus have met one of his blood in the crowds of Algiers . She was absorbed in the one catastrophe whose hideousness seemed to eat her very life away , even whilst her nerve , and her brain , and her courage remained at their keenest and strongest . "
279611	279640	279641	279641	You	0	" she said , slowly , so much as an affirmation that his belief was confirmed that she had learned both their relationship and their history from Cecil . "
279649	279657	279641	279641	You	0	" He shook from head to foot . "
279669	279704	279727	279727	his	5732	" She did not know that the words were cried out in all the contrition of an unavailing remorse ; she gave them only their literal significance , and shuddered as she answered him : "
279733	279780	279727	279727	his	5732	" He was silent : coward and egotist though he was , both cowardice and egotism were killed in him under the overwhelming horror with which he felt himself as truly by moral guilt a fratricide as though he had stabbed his elder through the heart . "
279783	279791	279884	279884	He	5741	" hissed Cigarette through her clenched teeth . "
279832	279883	279884	279884	He	5741	" He turned his wild terrified glance upon her : he had in that moment no sense but to seize some means of reparation , to declare his brother 's rights , to cry out to the very stones of the streets his own wrong and his victim 's sacrifice . "
279892	279903	279957	279957	I	0	" he answered her , scarce knowing what he answered . "
279959	280016	280031	280031	Your	0	" She listened , with her face set in that stern , fixed , resolute command which never varied : she neglected all that wonder , or curiosity , or interest would have made her ask at any other time , she only heeded the few great facts that bore upon the fate of the condemned . "
280024	280030	280111	280111	you	0	" she said , bitterly . "
280093	280108	280136	280136	I	0	" He seized her hands , and gazed with imploring eyes into her face . "
280157	280158	280328	280328	Monsieur	5747	" "
280163	280327	280423	280423	I	0	" She flung his hands off her and looked him full in the face ; that glance of the speechless scorn , the unutterable rebuke , of the woman - child who would herself have died a thousand deaths rather than have purchased a whole existence by a single falsehood or a single cowardice , smote him like a blow , and avenged his sin more absolutely than any public chastisement . The courage and the truth of a girl scorned his timorous fear and his living lie . His head sank , he seemed to shrink under her gaze ; his act had never looked so vile to him as it looked now . She gazed a moment longer at him in mute and wondering disdain that there should be on earth a male life capable of such fear and of such ignominy as these . Then the strong and rapid power in her took its instant ascendancy over the weaker nature . "
280374	280422	280493	280493	He	0	" He made a gesture of consent ; he would have signed away his soul , if he could , in the stupor of remorse which had seized him . She brought him pens and paper from the Turk 's store , and dictated what he wrote : "
280488	280492	280592	280592	he	0	" Berkeley Cecil . "
280583	280591	280597	280597	she	5755	" What is it you will do ? "
280614	280629	280656	280656	she	5755	" The best that shall lie in my power ; do you the same . "
280630	280638	280649	280649	Her	5755	" Can his life yet be saved ? "
280639	280648	280714	280714	He	0	" His honour may — his honour shall . "
280724	280731	280732	280732	She	5755	" Stay!—stay ! One word — — "
280739	280776	281031	281031	they	3338	" This is no time for words . Go to him — coward ! — and let the balls that kill him reach you too , if you have one trait of manhood left in you ! "
281022	281030	281976	281976	She	5755	" What is it with the Cigarette ? "
281961	281975	282070	282070	Cigarette	689	" Have a care of him ; and lead me to the Chief ! "
282093	282126	282432	282432	She	5755	" Take that to the man who gave it me . Tell him Cigarette waits ; and that with each moment that she waits a soldier 's life is lost . Go ! "
282419	282431	282528	282528	she	5755	" You , my young décorée ! What brings you here ? "
282532	282544	282550	282550	He	7967	" Monseigneur , I have come from Algiers since noon — — "
282545	282549	282564	282564	they	5850	" From Algiers ! "
282581	282622	282637	282637	her	5855	" Since noon , to rescue a life — the life of a great soldier , of a guiltless man . He who saved the honour of France at Zarâila is to die the death of a mutineer at dawn ! "
282623	282627	282789	282789	He	5856	" What!—your Chasseur ? "
282670	282788	282870	282870	he	5856	" Mine!—since he is a soldier of France ; yours , too , by that title . I am come here , from Algiers , to speak the truth in his name , and to save him for his own honour and the honour of my Empire . See here ! At noon , I have this paper , sent by a swift pigeon — read it ! You see how he is to die , and why . Well , by my Cross , by my Flag , by my France , I swear that not a hair of his head shall be touched , not a drop of blood in his veins shall be shed ! "
282864	282869	282870	282870	he	5856	" You speak madly , "
282877	282891	282870	282870	he	5856	" The offence merits the chastisement . I shall not attempt to interfere . "
282915	282927	282870	282870	he	5856	" Wait ! you will hear , at least , Monseigneur ? "
282928	282975	282984	282984	she	5857	" I will hear you — yes ; but I tell you , once for all , I never change sentences that are pronounced by conseils de guerre ; and this crime is the last for which you should attempt to plead for mercy with me . "
282976	282983	282984	282984	she	5857	" Hear me , at least ! "
283002	283128	282870	282870	he	5856	" You do not know what this man is — how he has had to endure ; I do . I have watched him ; I have seen the brutal tyranny of his chief , who hated him because the soldiers loved him . I have seen his patience , his obedience , his long - suffering beneath insults that would have driven any other to revolt and murder . I have seen him — I have told you how — at Zarâila , thinking never of death or of life , only of our Flag , that he has made his own , and under which he has been forced to lead the life of a galley - slave , of a dog — — "
283129	283142	283300	283300	His	5862	" The finer soldier he be , the less pardonable his offence . "
283143	283299	283327	283327	he	5862	" That I deny ! If he were a dolt , a brute , a thing of wood , as many are , he would have no right to vengeance ; as it is , he is a gentleman , a hero , a martyr ; may he not forget for one hour that he is a slave ? Look you ! I have seen him so tried , that I told him — I , who love my Army better than any living thing under the sun — that I would forgive him if he forgot duty and dealt with his tyrant as man to man . And he always held his soul in patience . Why ? Not because he feared death — he desired it ; but because he loved his comrades , and suffered in peace and in silence lest , through him , they should be led into evil — — "
283317	283326	283327	283327	he	5862	" It is useless to argue with me , "
283332	283339	283357	283357	she	5863	" I never change a sentence . "
283340	283348	283366	283366	her	5863	" But I say that you shall ! "
283375	283473	283357	283357	she	5863	" You are a great chief ; you are as a monarch here ; you hold the gifts and the grandeur of the Empire ; but , because of that — because you are as France in my eyes — I swear , by the name of France , that you shall see justice done to him — after death , if you can not in life . Do you know who he is — this man whom his comrades will shoot down at sunrise as they shoot down the murderer and the ravisher in their crimes ? "
283474	283485	283571	283571	She	5864	" He is a rebellious soldier ; it is sufficient . "
283486	283570	283671	283671	he	11562	" He is not ! He is a man who vindicated a woman 's honour ; he is a man who suffers in a brother 's place ; he is an aristocrat exiled to a martyrdom ; he is a hero who has never been greater than he will be great in his last hour . Read that ! What you refuse to justice , and mercy , and courage , and guiltlessness , you will grant , maybe , to your Order . "
283681	283684	283696	283696	he	11562	" Royallieu ! "
283686	283688	283702	283702	he	11562	muttered—"Royallieu ! "
283706	283717	283784	283784	He	11562	" That man has the seat of the English Guards , "
283792	283804	283901	283901	Her	5871	" You speak strangely ; how came this in your hands ? "
283805	283900	283909	283909	she	5871	" Thus : the day that you gave me the Cross , I saw Madame la Princesse Corona . I hated her , and I went — no matter ! From her I learned that he whom we call Louis Victor was of her rank , was of old friendship with her house , was exiled and nameless , but for some reason unknown to her . She needed to see him ; to bid him farewell , so she said . I took the message for her ; I sent him to her . "
283924	284149	284231	284231	His	5873	" He went to her tent , alone , at night ; that was , of course , whence he came when Châteauroy met him . I doubt not the Black Hawk had some foul thing to hint of his visit , and that the blow was struck for her — for her ! Well ; in the streets of Algiers I saw a man with a face like his own ; different , but the same race , look you . I spoke to him ; I taxed him . When he found that the one whom I spoke of was under sentence of death , he grew mad — he cried out that he was his brother , and had murdered him ; that it was for his sake that the cruelty of this exile had been borne , and that if his brother perished , he would be his destroyer . Then I bade him write down that paper , since these English names were unknown to me , and I brought it hither to you that you might see under his hand and with your own eyes that I have uttered the truth . And now is that man to be killed like a mad beast whom you fear ? Is that death the reward France will give for Zarâila ? "
284241	284256	284343	284343	she	5872	" Mort de Dieu ! it was his brother 's sin , not his ! "
284337	284342	284343	284343	she	5872	" Quick , quick ! "
284346	284360	284368	284369	The Marshal	7967	"The hours go so fast ; while we speak here , he — — "
284381	284448	284469	284469	she	5872	" Pens and ink ! instantly ! My brave child , what can we say to you ? I will send an Aide - de - camp to arrest the execution of the sentence . It must be deferred till we know the whole truth of this ; if it be as it looks now , he shall be saved if the Empire can save him ! "
284464	284468	284469	284469	she	5872	" His honour ! "
284472	284481	284486	284486	he	5873	" his honour — if not his life ! "
284496	284512	284549	284549	Cigarette	689	" True . We will cleanse that , if all other justice be too late . "
284556	284570	284584	284584	She	5872	" To me ! to me ! No other will go so fast ! "
284571	284583	284678	284678	He	5873	" But , my child , you are worn out already . "
284602	284677	284678	284678	He	5873	" Do you think I would tarry for that ? Ah ! I wish that I had let them tell me of God , that I might ask Him now to bless you ! Quick , quick ! Lend me your swiftest horse , one that will not tire . And send a second order by your officer ; the Arabs may kill me as I go , and then they will not know ! "
284693	284730	284749	284749	she	5872	" My child , Africa has shown me much heroism , but none like yours . If you fall , he shall be safe , and France will know how to avenge its darling 's loss . "
284745	284748	285842	285842	she	5872	" Ah!—France ! "
285861	285868	286661	286661	she	5872	" ohne hast , ohne rast , "
286648	286660	286661	286661	she	5872	" They will kill me , but that may save him , "
286664	286672	286868	286868	she	5872	" Any other way he is lost . "
286863	286867	287092	287092	she	5872	" I surrender , "
287087	287091	287092	287092	she	5872	" I surrender , "
287100	287191	287306	287306	he	5945	" I have heard that you have sworn by your God and your Prophet to tear me limb from limb because that I — a child , and a woman - child — brought you to shame and to grief on the day of Zarâila . Well , I am here ; do it . You can slake your will on me . But inasmuch as you are brave men , and as I have ever met you in fair fight , let me speak one word with you first . "
287301	287305	287331	287331	she	5944	" Speak on , "
287312	287330	287707	287707	She	5951	" You have sworn to take my body , sawn in two , to Ben - Ihreddin ? "
287349	287706	287836	287836	he	5955	" Well , here it is ; you can take it to him ; and you will receive the piasters , and the horse , and the arms that he has promised to whosoever shall slay me . I have surrendered ; I am yours . But you are bold men , and the bold are never mean ; therefore I will ask one thing of you . There is a man yonder , in my camp , condemned to death with the dawn . He is innocent . I have ridden from Algiers to - day with the order of his release . If it is not there by sunrise , he will be shot ; and he is guiltless as a child unborn . My horse is worn out ; he could not go another half league . I knew that , since he had failed , my comrade would perish , unless I found a fresh beast or a messenger to go in my stead . I saw your band come across the plain . I knew that you would kill me , because of your oath and of your Emir 's bribe ; but I thought that you would have greatness enough in you to save this man who is condemned , without crime , who must perish unless you , his foes , have pity on him . Therefore I came . Take the paper that frees him ; send your fleetest and surest with it , under a flag of truce , into our camp by the dawn ; let him tell them there that I , Cigarette , gave it him — he must say no word of what you have done to me , or his white flag will not protect him from the vengeance of my Army — and then receive your reward from your Emir when you lay my head down for his horse 's hoofs to trample into the dust . Answer me — is the pact fair ? Ride on with this paper northward , and then kill me with what torments you choose . "
287845	287857	287884	287884	She	5951	" Who is this Frank for whom you do this thing ? "
287858	287883	287914	287914	he	5955	" He is the warrior to whom you offered life on the field of Zarâila because his courage was as the courage of gods . "
287905	287913	287914	287914	he	5955	" And for what does he perish ? "
287917	287945	288045	288046	their leader	4766	" Because he forgot for once that he was a slave ; and because he has borne the burden of a guilt that was not his own . "
288018	288043	288091	288091	She	5951	" And you have given yourself up to us , that by your death you may purchase a messenger from us for this errand ? "
288116	288143	288186	288186	he	4766	" Cut me in ten thousand pieces with your swords , but save him , as you are brave men , as you are generous foes ! "
288182	288185	288186	288186	he	4766	" Maiden , "
288191	288246	288326	288326	she	5951	" we are Arabs , but we are not brutes . We swore to avenge ourselves on an enemy ; we are not vile enough to accept a martyrdom . Take my horse — he is the swiftest of my troop — and go you on your errand ; you are safe from me . "
288319	288325	288368	288369	The chief	2694	" You play with me ! "
288346	288367	288447	288447	he	2694	" Ah ! for pity 's sake make haste and kill me , so that only this may reach him ! "
288441	288446	288447	288447	he	2694	" Go in peace , "
288452	288464	288562	288562	she	5951	" it is not with such as thee that we war . "
288571	288616	288637	288637	he	2694	" Ah ! now I believe that thine Allah is a greater god than the god of the Christians ! If I live , thou shalt see me back ere another night ; if I die , France will know how to thank thee ! "
288617	288636	288637	288637	he	2694	" We do not do the thing that is right for the sake that men may recompense us , "
288643	288678	288803	288803	he	2694	" Fly to thy friend , and , hereafter , do not judge that those who are in arms against thee must needs be as the brutes that seek out whom they shall devour . "
288786	288802	288954	288954	she	5951	" Verily the courage of a woman has put the best amongst us unto shame , "
289000	289009	289326	289326	he	5984	" O God ! keep the day back ! "
289344	289360	289544	289544	he	5984	" Did I ever fear to look down the depths of my enemies ' muskets ? "
289537	289543	289544	289544	he	5984	" It is best thus , "
289547	289555	289691	289692	The officer	5998	" if only she never knows — — "
289675	289690	289737	289738	the stranger	5014	" Your prisoner is Victor of the Chasseurs?—he is to be shot this morning ? "
289707	289736	289737	289738	the stranger	5014	" I heard of it yesterday ; I rode all night from Oran . I feel great pity for this man , though he is unknown to me , "
289746	289753	289831	289831	He	5014	" His crime was — — ? "
289754	289763	289831	289831	He	5014	" A blow to his Colonel , Monseigneur . "
289764	289774	289737	289738	the stranger	5014	" And there is no possibility of a reprieve ? "
289775	289778	289831	289831	He	5014	" None . "
289779	289812	289831	289831	He	5014	" May I speak with him an instant ? I have heard it thought that he is of my country , and of a rank above his standing in his regiment here . "
289813	289830	289905	289906	the Seraph	454	" You may address him , M. le Duc ; but be brief . Time presses . "
289929	289948	290059	290059	he	628	" Who is that man ? He died — he died so long ago ! And yet — — "
290032	290045	290071	290071	his	628	" Who are you ? Answer me , for pity 's sake ! "
290114	290127	290242	290242	he	628	" You live still ! Oh ! thank God — thank God ! "
290255	290303	290322	290322	his	628	" You ! and perishing here ! If they send their shots through you , they shall reach me first in their passage ! Why have you lived like this ? Why have been lost to me , if you were dead to all the world beside ? "
290333	290339	290242	290242	he	628	" I was accused — — "
290340	290355	290242	290242	he	628	" Ay ! But by whom ? Not by me . Never by me ! "
290356	290366	290322	290322	his	628	" God reward you . You have never doubted ? "
290367	290378	290242	290242	he	628	" Doubted ? Was your honour not as my own ? "
290379	290393	290242	290242	he	628	" I can die at peace then ; you know me guiltless — — "
290394	290420	290242	290242	he	628	" Great Heaven ! Death shall not touch you . As I stand here , not a hair of your head shall be harmed — — "
290421	290438	290322	290322	his	628	" Hush ! Justice must take its course . One thing only — has she heard ? "
290439	290466	290242	290242	he	628	" Nothing . She is in Algiers . But you can be saved ; you shall be saved ; they do not know what they do ! "
290467	290489	290501	290501	He	6015	" Yes ! They but follow the sentence of the law . Do not regret it . It is best thus . "
290490	290500	290550	290550	Cecil	628	" Best!—that you should be slaughtered in cold blood ! "
290578	290655	290764	290764	himself	6132	" Best , because a lie I could never speak to you , and the truth I could never tell to you . Do not let your sister know ; it might give her pain . I have loved her ; that is useless , like all the rest . Give me your hand once more , and then — let them do their duty . Turn your head away ; it will soon be over ! "
290744	290757	290784	290784	his	6132	" Monseigneur , make your farewell . I can wait no longer . "
290793	290881	290968	290969	The officer	5998	" As I live , you shall not fire ! I forbid you ! I swear by my honour and the honour of England that he shall not perish . He is of my country ; he is of my order . I will appeal to your Emperor ; he will accord me his life the instant I ask it . Give me only an hour 's reprieve — a few moments ' space , to speak to your chiefs , to seek out your General — — "
290882	290889	290928	290928	he	628	" It is impossible , Monseigneur . "
290921	290927	290928	290928	he	628	" It will be useless , "
290931	290941	290910	290910	Cecil	628	" Let them act ; the quicker the better . "
290942	290956	290968	290969	The officer	5998	" What ! you think I can look on and see you die ? "
290957	290967	290968	290969	The officer	5998	" Would you had never known I lived — — "
290980	290997	291263	291263	His	628	" Monseigneur , submit to the execution of the law , or I must arrest you . "
291060	291074	291263	291263	His	628	" An hour 's reprieve ; for mercy 's sake , grant that ! "
291075	291084	291253	291254	the guards	1130	" I have said , it is impossible . "
291085	291096	291263	291263	His	628	" But you do not dream who he is — — "
291097	291102	291263	291263	His	628	" It matters not . "
291103	291115	291253	291254	the guards	1130	" He is an English noble , I tell you — — "
291116	291130	291263	291263	His	628	" He is a soldier who has broken the law ; that suffices . "
291131	291140	291263	291263	His	628	" O Heaven ! have you no humanity ? "
291141	291146	291263	291263	His	628	" We have justice . "
291147	291213	291263	291263	His	628	" Justice ! If you have justice , let your chiefs hear his story ; let his name be made known ; give me an hour 's space to plead for him . Your Emperor would grant me his life , were he here ; yield me an hour — a half - hour — anything that will give me time to save him — — "
291214	291251	291263	291263	His	628	" It is out of the question ; I must obey my orders . I regret you should have this pain ; but if you do not cease to interfere , my soldiers must make you . "
291274	291307	291316	291317	the man	6254	" My friend , do not plead for me . For the sake of our common country and our old love , let us both meet this with silence and with courage . "
291308	291314	291316	291317	the man	6254	" You are a madman ! "
291333	291424	291441	291441	He	6032	" You think that they shall kill you before my eyes?—you think I shall stand by to see you murdered ? What crime have you done ? None , I dare swear , save being moved , under insult , to act as the men of your race ever acted ! Why have lived as you have done ? why not have trusted my faith and my love ? If you had believed in my faith as I believed in your innocence , this misery never had come to us ! "
291425	291440	291671	291671	he	6032	" Hush ! hush ! or you will make me die like a coward . "
291686	291692	291733	291733	Dismounted	986	" Droit à mon coeur ! "
291723	291732	291954	291954	he	6032	" Wait ! in the name of France . "
291965	291977	292023	292023	She	986	" O God ! my child ! they have killed you ! "
292040	292152	292023	292023	She	986	" Chut ! It is the powder and ball of France ! that does not hurt . If it was an Arbico 's bullet now ! But wait ! Here is the Marshal 's order . He suspends your sentence ; I have told him all . You are safe!—do you hear?—you are safe ! How he looks ! Is he grieved to live ? Mes Français ! tell him clearer than I can tell — here is the order . The General must have it . No — not out of my hand till the General sees it . Fetch him , some of you — fetch him to me . "
292153	292165	292431	292431	they	6044	" Great Heaven ! you have given your life for mine ! "
292306	292413	292591	292591	he	6047	" A life ! Tiens ! what is it to give ? We hold it in our hands every hour , we soldiers , and toss it in change for a draught of wine . Lay me down on the ground — at your feet — so ! I shall live longest that way , and I have much to tell . How they crowd round ! Mes soldats , do not make that grief and that rage over me . They are sorry they fired ; that is foolish . They were only doing their duty , and they could not hear me in time . "
292581	292590	292652	292652	her	8003	" Oh , my child , my child ! "
292614	292647	292743	292743	She	8003	" What am I worth that you should perish for me ? Better a thousand times have left me to my fate ! Such nobility , such sacrifice , such love — — "
292679	292742	292795	292795	she	8003	" Chut ! We are comrades , and you are a brave man . I would do the same for any of my Spahis . Look you , I never heard of your arrest till I heard too of your sentence . Then I knew it was too late , unless I could get to the Chief . So I went — — "
292814	292897	292922	292922	she	6052	" They will tell you how I did it — I have not time . The Marshal gave his word you shall be saved ; there is no fear . That is your friend who bends over me , is it not ? A fair face,—a brave face . You will go back to your land — you will live among your own people — and she , she will love you now — now she knows you are of her Order ! "
292936	292970	292922	292922	she	6052	" You will be happy . That is well . Look you — it is nothing that I did . I would have done it for any one of my soldiers . And for this"—she
292985	293024	293335	293335	she	6052	smile—"it was an accident ; they must not grieve for it . My men are good to me ; they will feel such regret and remorse ; but do not let them . I am glad to die . "
293346	293445	293463	293463	she	6052	" Chut ! What is it to die — just to die ? You have lived your martyrdom ; I could not have done that . Listen , just one moment . You will be rich . Take care of the old man — he will not trouble you long — and of Vole - qui - veut and Etoile , and Boule Blanche , and the rat , and all the dogs , will you ? They will show you the Château de Cigarette in Algiers . I should not like to think that they would starve . "
293481	293573	293821	293821	Her	6052	" That is good ; they will be happy with you . And see that the Arab has back his horse,—it was he who saved you ; they must never harm him . And make my grave somewhere where my Army passes ; where I can hear the trumpets , and the arms , and the passage of the troops — O God ! I forgot ! I shall not wake when the bugles sound . It will all end now , will it not ? That is horrible , horrible ! "
293677	293820	293895	293895	he	6067	" Mes Français ! That was a foolish word of mine . How many of my bravest have fallen in death ; and shall I be afraid of what they welcomed ? Do not grieve like that . You could not help it ; you were doing your duty . If the shots had not come to me , they would have gone to him ; and he has been unhappy so long , and borne wrong so patiently , he has earned the right to live and to enjoy . Now I — I have been happy all my days , like a bird , like a kitten , like a foal , just from being young and taking no thought . I should have had to suffer if I had lived ; it is much best as it is — — "
293888	293894	293895	293895	he	6067	" Can nothing save her ? "
293899	293911	293952	293952	she	6052	" O Christ ! that you had fired one moment sooner ! "
293946	293951	293952	293952	she	6052	" She is content , "
293956	293968	293952	293952	she	6052	" You did not understand her rightly ; that was all . "
293969	293981	294082	294082	he	6067	" All ! My God , how I have wronged you ! "
294063	294081	294203	294203	she	6052	" My darling ! My darling ! what have I done to be worthy of such love ? "
294199	294202	294203	294203	she	6052	" Hush ! "
294214	294275	294280	294280	she	6052	" Keep those kisses for Miladi . She will have the right to love you ; she is of your ' aristocrates ; ' she is not ' unsexed . ' As for me,—I am only a little trooper who has saved my comrade ! My soldiers , come round me one moment ; I shall not long find words . "

294336	294345	294346	294346	she	6052	" I can not speak as I would , "
294358	294369	294346	294346	she	6052	" But I have loved you . All is said ! "
294379	294385	294457	294457	she	6052	" She had loved them . "
294443	294456	294457	294457	she	6052	" I have been too quick in anger sometimes — forgive it , "
294462	294519	294543	294543	she	6052	" And do not fight and curse amongst yourselves ; it is bad amidst brethren . Bury my Cross with me , if they will let you ; and let the colours be over my grave , if you can . Think of me when you go into battle ; and tell them in France — — "
294565	294578	294827	294827	he	628	" If I could only see France once more ! France — — "
294821	294826	294827	294827	he	628	" Say no more , "
294830	294882	295357	295357	he	628	" It has been well for me that I have suffered these things . For yourself — if you do indeed repent and feel that you owe me any debt , atone for it , and pay it by letting your own life be strong in truth and fair in honour . "
295348	295356	295382	295382	She	6097	" It was worth banishment to return , "
295362	295381	295411	295411	her	6097	" It was worth the trials that I bore to learn the love that I have known — — "
