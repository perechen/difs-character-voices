2	24	0	0	Chaucer	213	' Miss Winter , are you busy ? Do you want this afternoon ? Can you take a good long walk ? '
25	45	87	87	she	780	' Ethel , my dear , how often have I told you of your impetuosity — you have forgotten . '
46	62	87	87	she	780	' Very well'—with an impatient twist—'I beg your pardon . Good morning , Miss Winter , '
98	109	87	87	she	780	' Good morning , Ethel , good morning , Flora , '
151	155	158	158	Flora	280	' Good morning , '
174	178	192	193	Miss Winter	214	' Will you — '
197	207	192	193	Miss Winter	214	' Is your mamma pretty well to - day ? '
208	214	216	216	both	784	' Oh ! very well , '
220	228	216	216	both	784	' she is coming to the reading . '
233	245	230	230	Flora	280	' Papa is going to drive her out to - day . '
246	256	192	193	Miss Winter	214	' I am very glad . And the baby ? '
257	267	271	271	herself	300	' I do believe she does it on purpose ! '
566	577	563	563	Flora	280	' If you do n't want this afternoon to yourself — '
589	609	563	563	Flora	280	' O , Miss Winter ! if you would be so kind as to walk to Cocksmoor with us . '
610	617	619	620	the governess	791	' To Cocksmoor , my dear ! '
624	632	634	634	Ethel	300	' Yes , yes , but hear , '
636	645	634	634	Ethel	300	' It is not for nothing . Yesterday — '
646	653	655	655	Flora	280	' No , the day before , '
657	723	655	655	Flora	280	' There was a poor man brought into the hospital . He had been terribly hurt in the quarry , and papa says he 'll die . He was in great distress , for his wife has just got twins , and there were lots of children before . They want everything — food and clothes — and we want to walk and take it . '
724	735	737	737	Flora	280	' We had a collection of clothes ready , luckily , '
739	786	737	737	Flora	280	' and we have a blanket , and some tea and some arrowroot , and a bit of bacon , and mamma says she does not think it too far for us to walk , if you will be so kind as to go with us . '
792	803	787	788	Miss Winter	214	' How could you carry the blanket , my dear ? '
804	812	814	814	Ethel	300	' O , we have settled that , '
816	842	787	788	Miss Winter	214	' we mean to make the donkey a sumpter - mule , so , if you are tired , you may ride home on her . '
843	875	787	788	Miss Winter	214	' But , my dear , has your mamma considered ? They are such a set of wild people at Cocksmoor ; I do n't think we could walk there alone . '
876	881	883	883	Ethel	300	' It is Saturday , '
885	892	883	883	Ethel	300	' we can get the boys . '
893	921	787	788	Miss Winter	214	' If you would reflect a little ! They would be no protection . Harry would be getting into scrapes , and you and Mary running wild . '
922	930	932	932	Flora	280	' I wish Richard was at home ! '
934	938	940	940	Ethel	300	' I know ! '
942	963	964	964	Ethel	300	' Mr. Ernescliffe will come . I am sure he can walk so far now . I 'll ask him . '
994	1000	1002	1002	she	791	' Ethel does not consider , '
1004	1015	1002	1002	she	791	' I do n't think your mamma will be pleased . '
1016	1020	1022	1022	Flora	280	' Why not ? '
1024	1040	1022	1022	Flora	280	' My dear — a gentleman walking with you , especially if Margaret is going . '
1041	1051	1053	1053	Flora	280	' I do n't think he is strong enough , '
1087	1088	1083	1084	Mr. Ernescliffe	222	' '
1094	1121	1091	1092	my dear	7382	' She was interrupted by the entrance of a fine tall blooming girl of eighteen , holding in her hand a pretty little maid of five . '
1143	1144	1130	1130	Flora	280	' '
1163	1164	1153	1154	your mamma	7384	' '
1170	1198	1153	1154	your mamma	7384	' said Margaret , but papa said he would answer for it nothing would happen to us , and mamma said if you would be so kind . '
1199	1204	1206	1207	the governess	791	' It is unlucky , '
1232	1237	1225	1225	Ethel	300	' Oh ! Harry ! '
1259	1263	1271	1271	he	222	' Miss Winter , '
1297	1298	1287	1287	he	222	' '
1307	1311	1300	1301	Miss Winter	214	' hallooed Harry . '
1318	1319	1320	1320	I	0	' '
1329	1352	1320	1320	I	0	' valiantly exclaimed . Tom ; and while threats were passing among the boys , Margaret asked , in a low voice , '
1362	1363	1354	1354	you	802	' '
1409	1462	1406	1407	Miss Winter	214	' Miss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret , and Ethel began to perceive she had done something wrong . Flora was going to speak , when Margaret , trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in her own cheeks , pressed a hand on her shoulder , and whispering , '
1477	1484	1406	1407	Miss Winter	214	' glided out of the room . '
1491	1495	1406	1407	Miss Winter	214	' said Harry . '
1506	1507	1508	1508	Harry	219	' '
1514	1517	1519	1519	Flora	280	' language , '
1521	1542	1519	1519	Flora	280	' and I am sure he did not learn that of Mr. Ernescliffe . You never hear slang from him . '
1543	1552	1554	1554	Mary	220	' But are n't we going to Cocksmoor ? '
1564	1570	1572	1572	Ethel	300	' We shall know soon , '
1574	1591	1572	1572	Ethel	300	' I suppose I had better wait till after the reading to mend that horrid frock ? '
1592	1604	1606	1607	Miss Winter	214	' I think so , since we are so nearly collected , '
1700	1704	1670	1670	himself	227	' the boys , '
1748	1752	1725	1725	Ethel	300	' The sphynx ! '
1753	1759	1761	1761	Harry	219	' You 've crushed it , '
1768	1772	1761	1761	Harry	219	' No , here '
1775	1797	1761	1761	Harry	219	' said Mary , rushing among them , and bringing out a green sphynx caterpillar , on her finger—'tis not hurt . '
1798	1803	1805	1805	Norman	227	' Pax ! Pax ! '
1830	1840	1841	1841	he	227	' Harry ! you had better do that again , '
1846	1864	1841	1841	he	227	' Be off , out of this window , and let Ethel and me read in peace . '
1865	1871	1873	1873	Ethel—'Crispin	228	' Here 's the place , '
1885	1886	1841	1841	he	227	' '
1900	1905	1906	1906	Saturnalia	231	' sighed Miss Winter . '
1913	1917	1906	1906	Saturnalia	231	' replied Flora . '
1929	1951	1952	1952	He	815	' said Miss Winter , in a low voice to Flora , who shook her head , and said , confidentially , '
1969	2035	1963	1963	He	815	' Here entered , with a baby in her arms , a lady with a beautiful countenance of calm sweetness , looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall Margaret , who followed her . There was a general hush as she greeted Miss Winter , the girls crowding round to look at their little sister , not quite six weeks old . '
2049	2061	2041	2041	you	249	' said the mother , while the impatient speech was repeated , '
2070	2071	2062	2062	Mamma	7395	' '
2084	2096	2072	2072	You	249	' said the mother to Miss Winter , as Margaret departed . '
2116	2117	2112	2112	Margaret	249	' '
2123	2130	2121	2121	Margaret	249	' said Mrs. May , smiling . '
2167	2168	2153	2153	he	821	' '
2175	2180	2181	2181	She	249	' said Miss Winter . '
2185	2192	2181	2181	She	249	' said her mother , smiling . '
2202	2203	2195	2195	Harry	219	' '
2212	2216	2210	2210	mamma	7395	' answered Harry , '
2224	2250	2218	2218	Mary	220	' Mrs. May laughed , and proceeded to advise Ethel and Norman to put away Henry V. , and find the places in their Bibles , '
2263	2333	2252	2252	you	824	' said she . In the meantime Margaret , with the little babe , to - morrow to be her godchild , lying gently in her arms , came out into the matted hall , and began to mount the broad shallow - stepped stair - case , protected by low stout balusters , with a very thick flat and solid mahogany hand - rail , polished by the boys '
2385	2389	2390	2390	he	825	' Acting nurse ? '
2395	2434	2390	2390	he	825	' What an odd little face it is ! I did n't think little white babies were so pretty ! Well , I shall always consider myself as the real godfather — the other is all a sham . '
2439	2443	2390	2390	he	825	' said Margaret , '
2455	2467	2445	2445	I	0	' and on she went , while he called after her . '
2479	2506	2390	2390	he	825	' She did not gainsay it , but there was a little sigh of disappointment , and when she was out of hearing , she whispered , '
2527	2670	2676	2677	the boys	7404	' Then depositing her little charge with the nurse , and trying to cheer up a solemn - looking boy of three , who evidently considered his deposition from babyhood as a great injury , she tripped lightly down again , to take part in the Saturday 's reading and catechising . It was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such teaching , the mother 's gentle power preventing the outbreaks of restlessness to which even at such times the wild young spirits were liable . Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this occasion , the first since the birth of the baby , that she had been able to preside . Under her , though seemingly without her taking any trouble , there was none of the smothered laughing at the little ones '
2741	2779	2738	2738	Ethel	300	' I like the verse which explains that : " They who now sit lowest here , When their Master shall appear , He shall bid them higher rise , And be highest in the skies . " '
2799	2805	2738	2738	Ethel	300	' said Norman , thoughtfully . '
2819	2823	2738	2738	Ethel	300	' said Ethel . '
2831	2835	2836	2836	I	0	' said Flora . '
2841	2846	2836	2836	I	0	' said Mrs. May ; '
2885	2899	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' And Margaret looked earnestly at her mother , but did not speak . '
2906	2910	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' said Mary . '
2930	2932	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' The '
2934	2958	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' availed themselves of the permission . Norman tarried to put his books into a neat leather case , and Ethel stood thinking . '
2970	2974	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' said she . '
2977	2982	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' said her mother , '
2992	2993	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' '
3001	3005	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' said Margaret . '
3017	3021	2904	2904	mamma	7395	' said Flora . '
3041	3045	3046	3046	I	0	' said Norman . '
3071	3072	3046	3046	I	0	' '
3077	3081	3046	3046	I	0	' cried Ethel , '
3093	3094	3097	3097	people	839	' '
3105	3109	3100	3100	I	0	' said Norman , '
3121	3125	3111	3111	I	0	' exclaimed Ethel . '
3156	3157	3158	3158	I	0	' '
3166	3167	3168	3168	I	0	' '
3171	3212	3168	3168	I	0	' said Ethel , bending her brow , with the fulness of her thought—'I mean caring to do a thing only because nobody else can do it — wanting to be first more than wanting to do one 's best . '
3213	3223	3273	3273	she	7424	' You are quite right , my dear Ethel , '
3228	3272	3273	3273	she	7424	' and I am glad you have found in the Gospel a practical lesson , that should be useful to you both . I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek , though that is very nice too , '
3302	3331	3279	3279	she	7424	' Now , go and mend that deplorable frock , and if you do n't dream over it , you wo n't waste too much of your holiday . '
3332	3342	3344	3344	Ethel	300	' I 'll get it done in no time ! '
3719	3722	3723	3723	he	227	' Presently , '
3726	3732	3734	3734	she	300	' What have you there ? '
3743	3766	3737	3737	her	300	' Oh ! no wonder you ca n't leave off . I 've been wanting you to read it all the week . '
3778	3800	3767	3767	She	300	' I forgot , mamma told me not to read those stories in the morning . Only five minutes , Norman . '
3801	3810	3811	3811	She	300	' Wait a bit , I 'll come . '
3830	3834	3835	3835	she	300	' O yes , '
3838	3882	3835	3835	she	300	' do n't you know , Norman ? In a brown book on the upper shelf in the dining - room . Do n't you remember papa 's telling us the meaning of them , when we had the grand book - dusting . '
4474	4503	4453	4453	He	890	' was all he had in the world — father and mother were dead , and their relations lived in Scotland , and were hardly known to them . '
4512	4513	4514	4514	Alan	239	' '
4552	4553	4538	4538	he	239	' '
4562	4563	4557	4557	he	239	' '
4566	4573	4557	4557	he	239	' said the boy , proudly , '
4659	5345	5346	5347	the boys	7404	' The boy would have gone on for ever , if Dr. May had not recalled him to his brother 's present condition , and proceeded to take every measure for the welfare and comfort of the forlorn pair . He learnt from other sources that the Ernescliffes were well connected . The father had been a distinguished officer , but had been ill able to provide for his sons ; indeed , he died , without ever having seen little Hector , who was born during his absence on a voyage — his last , and Alan 's first . Alan , the elder by thirteen years , had been like a father to the little boy , showing judgment and selfdenial that marked him of a high cast of character . He had distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships , and in command of a prize that he had had to conduct to Sierra Leone , he had shown great coolness and seamanship , in several perilous conjunctures , such as a sudden storm , and an encounter with another slaver , when his Portuguese prisoners became mutinous , and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity had saved the lives of himself and his few English companions . He was , in fact , as Dr. May reported , pretty much of a hero . He had not , at the time , felt the effects of the climate , but , owing to sickness and death among the other officers , he had suffered much fatigue , and pressure of mind and body . Immediately on his return , had followed his examination , and though he had passed with great credit , and it had been at once followed by well - earned promotion , his nervous excitable frame had been over - tasked , and the consequence was a long and severe illness . The Swan inn was not forty yards from Dr. May 's back gate , and , at every spare moment , he was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor , professionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for bringing him a curious exotic specimen of fever , and requiting him by the utmost care and attention , while , for their own sakes , he delighted in the two boys with all the enthusiasm of his warm heart . Before the first week was at an end , they had learnt to look on the Doctor as one of the kindest friends it had been their lot to meet with , and Alan knew that if he died , he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a father . No sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up , than Dr. May insisted on conveying him to his own house , as his recovery was likely to be tedious , in solitude at the Swan . It was not till he had been drawn in a chair along the sloping garden , and placed on the sofa to rest , that he discovered that the time the good Doctor had chosen for bringing a helpless convalescent to his house , was two days after an eleventh child had been added to his family . Mrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth , and too sympathizing with her husband , to make any objection , though she was not fond of strangers , and had some anxieties . She had the utmost dependence on Margaret 's discretion , but there was a chance of awkward situations , which papa was not likely to see or guard against . However , all seemed to do very well , and no one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about Mr. Ernescliffe . The Doctor reiterated praises of his excellence , his principle , his ability and talent , his amusing talk ; the girls were always bringing reports of his perfections ; Norman retracted his grumbling at having his evenings spoilt ; and '
5348	6301	6302	6302	He	907	' were bursting with the secret that he was teaching them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma on her first coming down stairs , and to be named after the baby ; while Blanche did all the coquetry with him , from which Margaret abstained . The universal desire was for mamma to see him , and when the time came , she owned that papa 's swan had not turned out a goose . There were now no grounds for prolonging his stay ; but it was very hard to go , and he was glad to avail himself of the excuse of remaining for the Christening , when he was to represent the absent godfather . After that , he must go ; he had written to his Scottish cousins to offer a visit , and he had a promise that he should soon be afloat again . No place would ever seem to him to like home as Market Stoneborough . He was quite like one of themselves , and took a full share in the discussions on the baby 's name , which , as all the old family appellations had been used up , was an open question . The Doctor protested against Alice and Edith , which he said were the universal names in the present day . The boys hissed every attempt of their sisters at a romantic name , and then Harry wanted it to be Atalantis ! At last Dr. May announced that he should have her named Dowsabel if they did not agree , and Mrs. May advised all the parties concerned , to write their choice on a slip of paper , and little Aubrey should draw two out of her bag , trusting that Atalantis Dowsabel would not come out , as Harry confidently predicted . However , it was even worse , Aubrey 's two lots were Gertrude and Margaret . Ethel and Mary made a vehement uproar to discover who could have written Margaret , and at last traced it home to Mr. Ernescliffe , who replied that Flora , without saying why , had desired him to set down his favourite name . He was much disconcerted , and did not materially mend the matter by saying it was the first name that came into his head . — Milton . Ethel 's navigation lesson was interrupted by the dinner - bell . That long table was a goodly sight . Few ever looked happier than Dr. and Mrs. May , as they sat opposite to each other , presenting a considerable contrast in appearance as in disposition . She was a little woman , with that smooth pleasant plumpness that seems to belong to perfect content and serenity , her complexion fair and youthful , her face and figure very pretty , and full of quiet grace and refinement , and her whole air and expression denoting a serene , unruffled , affectionate happiness , yet with much authority in her mildness — warm and open in her own family , but reserved beyond it , and shrinking from general society . The Doctor , on the contrary , had a lank , bony figure , nearly six feet high , and looking more so from his slightness ; a face sallow , thin , and strongly marked , an aquiline nose , highly developed forehead , and peculiar temples , over which the hair strayed in thin curling flakes . His eyes were light - coloured , and were seldom seen without his near - sighted spectacles , but the expressions of the mouth were everything — so varying , so bright , and so sweet were the smiles that showed beautiful white teeth — moreover , his hand was particularly well made , small and delicate ; and it always turned out that no one ever recollected that Dr. May was plain , who had ever heard his kindly greeting . The sons and daughters were divided in likeness to father and mother ; Ethel was almost an exaggeration of the Doctor 's peculiarities , especially at the formed , but unsoftened age of fifteen ; Norman had his long nose , sallow complexion , and tall figure , but was much improved by his mother 's fine blue eyes , and was a very pleasant - looking boy , though not handsome ; little Tom was a thin , white , delicate edition of his father ; and Blanche contrived to combine great likeness to him with a great deal of prettiness . Of those that , as nurse said , favoured their mamma , Margaret was tall and blooming , with the same calm eyes , but with the brilliance of her father 's smile ; Flora had greater regularity of feature , and was fast becoming a very pretty girl , while Mary and Harry could not boast of much beauty , but were stout sturdy pictures of health ; Harry 's locks in masses of small tight yellow curls , much given to tangling and matting , unfit to be seen all the week , till nurse put him to torture every Saturday , by combing them out so as , at least , to make him for once , like , she said , a gentleman , instead of a young lion . Little Aubrey was said by his papa to be like nothing but the full moon . And there he shone on them , by his mamma 's side , announcing in language few could understand , where he had been with papa . '
6309	6332	6302	6302	He	907	' said his father , beginning to cut the boiled beef as fast as if his hands had been moved by machinery . '
6367	6368	6369	6371	Poor old woman	910	' '
6382	6394	6369	6371	Poor old woman	910	' said Mrs. May—'it is so seldom she has any change . '
6395	6400	6402	6403	Mr. Ernescliffe	222	' Who is she ? '
6405	6412	6414	6414	Margaret	249	' The butcher 's old mother , '
6422	6442	6414	6414	Margaret	249	' She is one of papa 's pet patients , because he thinks her desolate and ill - used . '
6443	6449	6451	6452	the doctor	890	' Her sons bully her , '
6525	6526	6498	6498	she	915	' '
6533	6537	6529	6529	they	918	' said Ethel . '
6652	6769	6770	6770	Mary	220	' There was a great laugh , and an entreaty to know whether this was really his address — Ethel telling him she knew he had muttered it to himself quite audibly , for which she was rewarded by a pretended box on the ear . It certainly was vain to expect order at dinner on Saturday , for the Doctor was as bad as the boys , and Mrs. May took it with complete composure , hardly appearing sensible of the Babel which would sometimes almost deafen its promoter , papa ; and yet her interference was all - powerful , as now when Harry and Mary were sparring over the salt , with one gentle '
6772	6797	6798	6798	Maggie	232	' and one reproving glance , they were reduced to quiescence . Meanwhile Dr. May , in a voice above the tumult , was telling '
6800	6851	6798	6798	Maggie	232	' as he always called his wife , some piece of news about Mr. Rivers , who had bought Abbotstoke Grange ; and Alan Ernescliffe , in much lower tones , saying to Margaret how he delighted in the sight of these home scenes , and this free household mirth . '
6864	6868	6857	6857	you	928	' said Margaret , '
6888	6889	6886	6886	Richard	298	' '
6899	6903	6890	6890	I	0	' repeated Alan . '
6919	6920	6890	6890	I	0	' '
6925	6931	6890	6890	I	0	' said Margaret , earnestly . '
6955	6974	6975	6975	You	928	' Margaret smiled , too much pleased to speak , and glanced at her mother 's sweet face . '
6991	7028	6989	6989	I	0	' He broke off , for the noise subsided , and his speech was not intended for the public ear , so he dashed into the general conversation , and catching his own name , exclaimed , '
7037	7038	7035	7035	Ethel	300	' '
7046	7050	7035	7035	Ethel	300	' said Norman . '
7059	7064	7051	7051	They	936	' interposed the doctor . '
7087	7096	7077	7077	his	243	' I assure you that Alan rides like — '
7097	7103	7105	7105	Norman	227	' Like a horse marine , '
7144	7166	7139	7139	Mary	220	' Why , Norman , nonsense ! Mr. Ernescliffe rode the new black kicking horse till he made it quite steady . '
7167	7184	7186	7187	Mr. Ernescliffe	222	' Made it steady ! No , Mary , that is saying too much for it , '
7189	7202	7204	7205	the Doctor	890	' It has no harm in it — capital horse — splendid , '
7207	7220	7204	7205	the Doctor	890	' I shall take you out with it this afternoon , Maggie . '
7221	7229	7231	7231	Alan	750	' You have driven it several times ? '
7233	7272	7231	7231	Alan	750	' Yes , I drove him to Abbotstoke yesterday — never started , except at a fool of a woman with an umbrella , and at the train — and we 'll take care not to meet that . '
7273	7287	7289	7290	Mrs. May	232	' It is only to avoid the viaduct at half - past four , '
7292	7299	7289	7290	Mrs. May	232	' and that is easily done . '
7300	7308	7310	7311	the Doctor	890	' So you are bound for Cocksmoor ? '
7313	7341	7310	7311	the Doctor	890	' I told the poor fellow you were going to see his wife , and he was so thankful , that it did one 's heart good . '
7342	7355	7357	7357	Flora	280	' Is he better ? I should like to tell his wife , '
7366	7371	7372	7372	he	890	' A bad business , '
7375	7422	7372	7372	he	890	' he is a shade better to - day ; he may get through yet ; but he is not my patient . I only saw him because I happened to be there when he was brought in , and Ward was not in the way . '
7423	7430	7359	7360	The Doctor	890	' And what 's his name ? '
7431	7443	7372	7372	he	890	' I ca n't tell — don't think I ever heard . '
7444	7450	7452	7453	Miss Winter	214	' We ought to know , '
7455	7464	7452	7453	Miss Winter	214	' it would be awkward to go without . '
7465	7480	7482	7482	Flora	280	' To go roaming about Cocksmoor asking where the man in the hospital lives ! '
7484	7492	7482	7482	Flora	280	' We ca n't wait till Monday . '
7493	7498	7500	7500	Norman	227	' I 've done , '
7502	7519	7500	7500	Norman	227	' I 'll run down to the hospital and find out . May I , mamma ? '
7520	7528	7482	7482	Flora	280	' Without your pudding , old fellow ? '
7529	7536	7538	7538	Norman	227	' I do n't want pudding , '
7545	7551	7538	7538	Norman	227	' May I , mamma ? '
7552	7559	7482	7482	Flora	280	' To be sure you may ; '
7589	7603	7605	7606	his father	7526	' Stop , stop ! know what you are going after , sir , '
7608	7635	7605	7606	his father	7526	' What will they know there of Cocksmoor , or the man whose wife has twins ? You must ask for the accident in number five . '
7636	7647	7649	7649	Ethel	300	' And oh ! Norman , come back in time , '
7651	7657	7649	7649	Ethel	300	' I 'll be bound I 'm
7666	7701	7660	7662	Etheldred the Unready	217	' he answered , bounding off with an elasticity that caused his mother to say the boy was made of Indian rubber , and then putting his head in by the window to say , '
7749	7752	7660	7662	Etheldred the Unready	217	'em ; I 'm
7757	7991	7992	7992	Papa	218	' and he scampered headlong up the garden , prolonging his voice into a tremendous shout as he got further off , leaving every one laughing , and his mother tenderly observing that he was going to run a quarter of a mile and back , and lose his only chance of pudding for the week — old Bishop Whichcote 's rules contemplating no fare but daily mutton , to be bought at a shilling per sheep . A little private discussion ensued between Harry and Hector , on the merits of the cakes at Ballhatchet 's gate , and old Nelly 's pies , which led the doctor to mourn over the loss of the tarts of the cranberries , that sued to grow on Cocksmoor , before it was inhabited , and to be the delight of the scholars of Stoneborough , when he was one of them — and then to enchant the boys by relations of ancient exploits , especially his friend Spencer climbing up , and engraving a name on the top of the market cross , now no more , swept away by the Town Council in a fit of improvement , which had for the last twenty years enraged the Doctor at every remembrance of it . Perhaps at this moment his wife could hardly sympathize , when she thought of her boys emulating such deeds . '
7994	7998	8000	8000	you	218	' said Ethel , '
8011	8012	8000	8000	you	218	' '

8085	8092	8094	8094	Margaret	249	' For a very good reason , '
8096	8104	8094	8094	Margaret	249	' because you have n't got them . '
8105	8117	8124	8125	the Doctor	890	' No , I believe Harry stole them in the holidays . '
8118	8122	8124	8125	the Doctor	890	' Stole them ! '
8127	8141	8124	8125	the Doctor	890	' as if they were n't my property , unjustifiably appropriated by her ! '
8142	8156	8158	8158	Ethel	300	' They were that pair that you never could keep on , papa , '

8208	8211	8213	8214	the father	7460	' Ah ! '
8216	8241	8213	8214	the father	7460	' the boys thought it time to put a stop to it when it came to a caricature of the little Doctor in petticoats . '
8242	8250	8252	8252	Ethel	300	' Yes , in Norman 's Lexicon , '
8254	8276	8252	8252	Ethel	300	' a capital likeness of you , papa ; but I never could get him to tell me who drew it . '
8353	8368	8370	8370	Ethel	300	' I wish you were obliged to go about without them yourself , papa ! '
8372	8393	8370	8370	Ethel	300	' and then you would know how tiresome it is not to see twice the length of your own nose . '
8394	8404	8406	8407	the Doctor	890	' Not such a very short allowance , either , '
8494	8524	8546	8546	Flora	280	' There , Maggie , you are complete , you old hen - and - chicken daisy . Ca n't you take her portrait in the character , Margaret ? '
8525	8544	8546	8546	Flora	280	' With her pink cap , and Blanche and Aubrey as they are now , on each side ? '
8548	8558	8560	8560	Ethel	300	' Margaret ought to be in the picture herself , '
8562	8573	8560	8560	Ethel	300	' Fetch the artist in Norman 's Lexicon , Harry . '
8574	8586	8588	8589	the doctor	890	' Since he has hit off one of us so well , '

8679	8698	8665	8665	You	960	' A general dispersion ensued , and only Mrs. May , Margaret , and the baby , remained . '

10385	10430	10348	10348	You	0	' O , yes , how stupid . The a long or short ? Then that 's right . I had such a line in my head , I was forced to write it down . Is not it a capital subject this time ? '
10431	10443	10445	10445	Norman	227	' The devotion of Decius ? Capital . Let me see ? '
10459	10483	10445	10445	Norman	227	' O , you have taken up quite a different line from mine . I began with Mount Vesuvius spouting lava like anything . '
10484	10496	10502	10502	Norman	227	' But Mount Vesuvius did n't spout till it overthrew Pompeii . '
10497	10500	10502	10502	Norman	227	' Murder ! '
10573	10586	10763	10763	Flora	280	' vana gloria triumphalis — only take care of the scanning there — '

11419	11458	11417	11417	Ethel	300	' I think looking for fame is like wanting a reward at once . I had rather people forgot themselves . Do you think Arnold von Winkelried thought about fame , when he threw himself on the spears ? '
11459	11464	11466	11466	Norman	227	' He got it , '
11468	11500	11466	11466	Norman	227	' Yes ; he got it for the good of other people , not to please himself . Fame does those that admire it good , not those that win it . '
11501	11504	11506	11506	Norman	227	' But ! '
11552	11611	11535	11536	Presently Norman	227	' It is no use talking , Ethel , it is all a fight and a race . One is always to try to be foremost . That 's the spirit of the things — that 's what the great , from first to last , have struggled , and fought , and lived , and died for . '
11633	11677	11631	11631	Ethel	300	' but is not there the difference , that here all may win — not only one ? One may do one 's best , not care whether one is first or last . That 's what our reading to - day said . '
11678	11713	11631	11631	Ethel	300	' That was against trumpery vanity — false elevation — not what one has earned for oneself , but getting into other people 's places that one never deserved . That every one despises ! '
11714	11734	11631	11631	Ethel	300	' Of course ! That they do . I say , Norman , did n't you mean Harvey Anderson ? '
11742	11790	11791	11791	he	227	' It is pretension that is hateful — true excelling is what one 's life is for . No , no , I 'll never be beat , Ethel — I never have been beat by any one , except by you , when you take pains , '
11800	11807	11791	11791	he	227	' and I never will be . '
11808	11812	11631	11631	Ethel	300	' O Norman ! '
11813	11836	11631	11631	Ethel	300	' I mean , of course , while I have senses . I would not be like Richard for all the world . '
11837	11846	11791	11791	he	227	' O no , no , poor Richard ! '
11847	11857	11859	11859	Norman	227	' He is an excellent fellow in everything else , '
11861	11904	11859	11859	Norman	227	' I could sometimes wish I was more like him — but how he can be so amazingly slow , I ca n't imagine . That examination paper he broke down in — I could have done it as easily as possible . '
11905	11914	11916	11916	Ethel	300	' I did it all but one question , '
11918	11941	11916	11916	Ethel	300	' but so did he , you know , and we ca n't tell whether we should have it done well enough . '
11942	11973	11975	11975	Norman	227	' I know I must do something respectable when first I go to Oxford , if I do n't with to be known as the man whose brother was plucked , '
11977	11980	11982	11982	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
11984	12013	11982	11982	Ethel	300	' if papa will but let you try for the Randall scholarship next year , but he says it is not good to go to Oxford so young . '
12014	12027	12029	12029	Norman	227	' And I believe I had better not be there with Richard , '
12031	12090	12029	12029	Norman	227	' I do n't like coming into contrast with him , and I do n't think he can like it , poor fellow , and it is n't his fault . I had rather stay another year here , get one of the open scholarships , and leave the Stoneborough ones for those who can do no better . '
12230	12235	12237	12237	Flora	280	' Here you are ! '
12239	12259	12237	12237	Flora	280	' I told them it was of no use to wait when you and Norman had begun a dissertation . '
12260	12273	12275	12275	Ethel	300	' Now , Mr. Ernescliffe , I should like you to say , '
12277	12295	12275	12275	Ethel	300	' which do you think is the best , the name of it , or the thing ? '
12314	12316	12318	12318	Norman	227	' Ethell '
12320	12364	12318	12318	Norman	227	' how is any one to understand you ? The argument is this : Ethel wants people to do great deeds , and be utterly careless of the fame of them ; I say , that love of glory is a mighty spring . '
12365	12370	12372	12372	Alan	750	' A mighty one ! '
12374	12395	12372	12372	Alan	750	' but I think , as far as I understand the question , that Ethel has the best of it . '
12396	12412	12414	12414	Norman	227	' I do n't mean that people should not serve the cause first of all , '
12416	12428	12414	12414	Norman	227	' but let them have their right place and due honour . '
12429	12442	12444	12444	Alan	750	' They had better make up their minds to do without it , '
12446	12459	12444	12444	Alan	750	' Remember " The world knows nothing of its greatest men . " '
12467	12471	12414	12414	Norman	227	' said Norman . '
12479	12483	12414	12414	Norman	227	' said Ethel , '
12511	12512	12499	12499	I	0	' '
12521	12525	12513	12513	I	0	' said Alan . '
12552	12553	12554	12554	You	1039	' '
12560	12564	12554	12554	You	1039	' said Ethel . '
12568	12569	12554	12554	You	1039	' '
12581	13063	13064	13064	I	0	' said Norman . There they were cut short . There was a plantation to be crossed , with a gate that would not open , and that seemed an effectual barrier against both Miss Winter and the donkey , until by persuasive eloquence and great gallantry , Mr. Ernescliffe performed the wonderful feat of getting the former over the tall fence , while Norman conducted the donkey a long way round , undertaking to meet them at the other side of the plantation . The talk became desultory , as they proceeded for at least a mile along a cart - track , through soft tufted grass and heath , and young fir trees . It ended in a broad open moor , stony and full of damp boggy hollows , forlorn and desolate under the autumn sky . Here they met Norman again , and walked on along a very rough and dirty road , the ground growing more decidedly into hills and valleys as they advanced , till they found themselves before a small , but very steep hillock , one side of which was cut away into a slate quarry . Round this stood a colony of roughly - built huts , of mud , turf , or large blocks of the slate . Many workmen were engaged in splitting up the slates , or loading waggons with them , rude wild - looking men , at the sight of whom the ladies shrank up to their protectors , but who seemed too busy even to spare time for staring at them . They were directed to John Taylor 's house , a low mud cottage , very wretched looking , and apparently so smoky , that Mr. Ernescliffe and Norman were glad to remain outside and survey the quarry , while the ladies entered . Inside they found more cleanliness and neatness than they had expected , but there was a sad appearance of poverty , insufficient furniture , and the cups and broken tea - pot on the table , holding nothing but toast and water , as a substitute for their proper contents . The poor woman was sitting by the fire with one twin on her lap , and the other on a chair by her side , and a larger child was in the corner by the fire , looking heavy and ill , while others of different ages lounged about listlessly . She was not untidy , but very pale , and she spoke in a meek , subdued way , as if the ills of life were so heavy on her that she had no spirit even to complain . She thanked them for their gifts but languidly , and did not visibly brighten when told that her husband was better . Flora asked when the babes would be Christened . '
13076	13077	13070	13070	Miss—'tis	275	' '
13097	13117	13089	13089	I	0	' said Flora , looking at a nice tall , smooth - haired girl , of thirteen or fourteen . '
13165	13166	13156	13156	I	0	' '
13177	13182	13167	13167	You	1048	' said Miss Winter . '
13249	13415	13222	13222	ma'am	1049	' No one could deny it , and the party left the cottage gravely . Alan and Norman joined them , having heard a grievous history of the lawlessness of the people , from a foreman with whom they had met . There seemed to be no visible means of improvement . The parish Church was Stoneborough , and there the living was very poor , the tithes having been appropriated to the old Monastery , and since its dissolution having fallen into possession of a Body that never did anything for the town . The incumbent , Mr. Ramsden , had small means , and was not a high stamp of Clergyman , seldom exerting himself , and leaving most of his parish work to the two under masters of the school , Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Harrison , who did all they had time and strength for , and more too , within the town itself . There was no hope for Cocksmoor ! '
13423	13434	13222	13222	ma'am	1049	' said Etheldred , as they turned their steps homeward . '
13450	13451	13222	13222	ma'am	1049	' '
13464	13468	13456	13456	you	1057	' said Norman . '
13491	13492	13478	13478	I	0	' '
13499	13503	13478	13478	I	0	' said Flora , '
13512	13513	13478	13478	I	0	' '
13518	13522	13523	13523	I	0	' said Norman . '
13532	13533	13534	13534	You	1057	' '
13538	13542	13544	13544	you	1057	' said Ethel , '
13549	13550	13544	13544	you	1057	' '
13557	13754	13544	13544	you	1057	' he answered , smiling . Miss Winter looked at Etheldred reprovingly , and she shrank into herself , drew apart , and indulged in a reverie . She had heard in books , of girls writing poetry , romance , history — gaining fifties and hundreds . Could not some of the myriads of fancies floating in her mind thus be made available ? She would compose , publish , earn money — some day call papa , show him her hoard , beg him to take it , and , never owning whence it came , raise the building . Spire and chancel — pinnacle and buttress rose before her eyes — and she and Norman were standing in the porch , with an orderly , religious population , blessing the unknown benefactor , who had caused the news of salvation to be heard among them . They were almost at home , when the sight of a crowd in the main street checked them . Norman and Mr. Ernescliffe went forward to discover the cause , and spoke to some one on the outskirts — then Mr. Ernescliffe hurried back to the ladies . '
13761	13779	13780	13780	He	1059	' he said , hastily—'you had better go down the lane , and in by the garden . '
13888	13899	13875	13878	one of the maids	1066	' Oh ! Miss — Miss — have you heard ? '
13900	13913	13915	13916	Miss Winter	214	' No — what ? What has happened ? Not Mrs. May — '
13918	13938	13915	13916	Miss Winter	214	' Oh ! ma'am ! it is all of them . The carriage is over - turned , and — '
13939	13953	13955	13955	Flora	280	' Who 's hurt ? Mamma ! papa ! Oh ! tell me ! '
13957	13962	13955	13955	Flora	280	' There 's nurse , '
13970	13979	13964	13964	Ethel	300	' What is it ? Oh ! nurse ! '
13986	14022	13964	13964	Ethel	300	' said old nurse , passionately kissing Ethel . Harry and Mary were on the stairs behind her , clinging together . A stranger looked into the house , followed by Adams , the stableman . '
14032	14116	14023	14023	They	1069	' some one said . Ethel could bear it no longer . As if she could escape , she fled up - stairs , into her room , and , falling on her knees , hid her face on her bed . There were heavy steps in the house , then a sound of hasty feet coming up to her . Norman dashed into the room , and threw himself on a chair . He was ghastly pale , and shuddered all over . '
14129	14153	14154	14154	I	0	' He groaned , but could not speak ; he rested his head against her , and gasped . She was terribly frightened . '
14158	14170	14154	14154	I	0	' and she would have gone , but he held her . '
14179	14234	14175	14175	thye	1070	' He was prevented from saying more , by chattering teeth and deadly faintness . She tried to support him , but could only guide him as he sank , till he lay at full length on the floor , where she put a pillow under his head , and gave him some water . '
14254	14255	14256	14256	They	1071	' '
14262	14269	14258	14258	Margaret	249	' said Norman , in gasps ; '
14286	14287	14273	14273	papa	218	' '
14295	14296	14297	14297	His	218	' '
14300	14310	14311	14311	Mamma	225	' and the tremor and fainting stopped him again . '
14313	14416	14311	14311	Mamma	225	' whispered Ethel ; but Norman only pressed his face into the pillow . She was so bewildered as to be more alive to the present distress of his condition , than to the vague horrors down - stairs . Some minutes passed in silence , Norman lying still , excepting a nervous trembling that agitated his whole frame . Again was heard the strange tread , doors opening and shutting , and suppressed voices , and he turned his face upwards , and listened with his hand pressed to his forehead , as if to keep himself still enough to listen . '
14428	14443	14446	14446	Norman	227	' cried Ethel , startled and recalled to the sense of what was passing . '
14448	14458	14446	14446	Norman	227	' then springing up , with a sudden thought , '
14468	14469	14465	14465	he	218	' '
14472	14482	14483	14483	he	218	' said Norman , in a low hopeless tone , '
14493	14494	14489	14489	He	218	' '
14497	14507	14508	14508	Mamma	225	' Again Norman 's face was out of sight . '
14510	14551	14508	14508	Mamma	225	' Ethel 's understanding perceived , but her mind refused to grasp the extent of the calamity . There was no answer , save a convulsive squeezing of her hand . Fresh sounds below recalled her to speech and action . '
14565	14566	14558	14558	they	1073	' '
14585	14586	14582	14582	she	225	' '
14589	14590	14582	14582	she	225	' '
14593	14634	14582	14582	she	225	' The boy lay with his face hidden , the girl sat by him on the floor , too much crushed for even the sensations belonging to grief , neither moving nor looking . After an interval Norman spoke again , '
14649	14650	14641	14641	her	225	' '
14655	14661	14652	14652	you	1075	' said Ethel , presently . '
14669	14688	14664	14664	them	1073	' He spoke at intervals , as he could get breath , and bear to utter the words . '
14726	14727	14709	14709	he	7391	' '
14742	14748	14730	14730	you	1075	' The shuddering came again , '
14757	14777	14730	14730	you	1075	' and his voice sank into a faint whisper ; Ethel was obliged to sprinkle him again with water . '
14784	14796	14730	14730	you	1075	' said she , in a tone calm from its bewilderment . '
14805	14806	14730	14730	you	1075	' '
14810	14811	14812	14812	They	1077	' '
14833	14857	14858	14858	You	0	' exclaimed he , scolding himself , as , sitting up , he was forced to rest his head on his shaking hand . '
14879	14880	14873	14873	I	0	' '
14889	14984	14873	14873	I	0	' but he was obliged to lay his head down again ; and Ethel , scarcely less trembling , crept carefully towards the stairs , but a dread of what she might meet came over her , and she turned towards the nursery . The younger ones sat there in a frightened huddle . Mary was on a low chair by the infant 's cot , Blanche in her lap , Tom and Harry leaning against her , and Aubrey almost asleep . Mary held up her finger as Ethel entered , and whispered , '
14994	15015	15018	15018	they	1081	' The first true pang of grief shot through Ethel like a dart , stabbing and taking away her breath , '
15020	15024	15018	15018	they	1081	' she said ; '
15034	15035	15036	15037	Mr. Ward	256	' '
15042	15046	15047	15047	Nurse	7474	' said Harry . '
15061	15062	15047	15047	Nurse	7474	' '
15067	15068	15065	15065	he	7391	' '
15078	15082	15065	15065	he	7391	' said Harry . '
15093	15109	15087	15087	himself	7391	' They did not seem to know , and Ethel asked where to find Flora . '
15113	15146	15087	15087	himself	7391	' she was told , and she was thinking whether she could venture to seek her , when she herself came fast up the stairs . Ethel and Harry both darted out . '
15152	15159	15087	15087	himself	7391	' said Flora—'they want some handkerchiefs . '
15160	15171	15087	15087	himself	7391	' What , is not she in her own room ? '
15172	15175	15177	15177	Harry	278	' No , '
15179	15184	15177	15177	Harry	278	' in mamma 's ; '
15223	15262	15198	15198	Ethel	300	' We ca n't judge of Margaret — she has moved , and made a little moaning — there are no limbs broken , but we are afraid for her head . Oh ! if papa could but — '
15263	15267	15201	15201	her	300	' And papa ? '
15268	15282	15198	15198	Ethel	300	' Mr. Ward is with him now — his arm is terribly hurt . '
15283	15296	15198	15198	Ethel	300	' But oh ! Flora — one moment — is he sensible ? '
15297	15313	15201	15201	her	300	' Hardly ; he does not take any notice — but do n't keep me . '
15314	15320	15198	15198	Ethel	300	' Can I do anything ? '
15330	15358	15198	15198	Ethel	300	' No ; I do n't see what you can do . Miss Winter and I are with Margaret ; there 's nothing to do for her . '
15696	15724	15689	15689	Mary	220	' Norman , here 's Mr. Wilmot come to ask if he can do anything — Miss Winter sent word that you had better go to him . '
15725	15730	15732	15732	Harry	278	' How is baby ? '
15734	15752	15754	15754	Mary	220	' Nurse has fed her , and is putting her to bed ; she is quiet now , '
15756	15764	15754	15754	Mary	220	' will you go down , Norman ? '
15765	15770	15689	15689	Mary	220	' Where is he ? '
15771	15778	15779	15779	Norman	227	' In the drawing - room . '
15789	15792	15794	15794	Mary	220	' Nothing , '
15796	15812	15794	15794	Mary	220	' nobody can do anything . Make haste . Do n't you want a candle ? '
15813	15837	15839	15839	Etheldred	217	' No , thank you , I had rather be in the dark . Come up as soon as you have seen him , '
15939	15956	15935	15935	he	227	' Then you think it would be better for me not to sit up with him . '
15957	15964	15966	15967	Mr. Ward	256	' I should decidedly say so , '
15969	16002	15966	15967	Mr. Ward	256	' He has recognised Mr. Ernescliffe , and any change might excite him , and lead him to ask questions . The moment of his full consciousness is especially to be dreaded . '
16003	16012	15935	15935	he	227	' But you do not call him insensible ? '
16013	16042	15966	15967	Mr. Ward	256	' No , but he seems stunned — stupified by the shock , and by pain . He spoke to Miss Flora when she brought him some tea . '
16043	16049	16051	16052	Alan Ernescliffe	750	' And admirably she managed , '
16054	16085	16051	16052	Alan Ernescliffe	750	' I was much afraid of some answer that would rouse him , but she kept her self - possession beautifully , and seemed to compose him in a moment . '
16086	16098	16100	16101	Mr. Ward	256	' She is valuable indeed — so much judgment and activity , '
16103	16131	16100	16101	Mr. Ward	256	' I do n't know what we should have done without her . But we ought to have Mr. Richard — has no one sent to him ? '
16141	16153	16155	16156	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Is he at Oxford , or at his tutor 's ? '
16158	16177	16155	16156	Mr. Wilmot	277	' At Oxford ; he was to be there to - day , was he not , Norman ? '
16178	16198	16200	16201	Mr. Ward	256	' What o'clock is it ? Is the post gone — seven — no ; it is all safe , '
16239	16246	16248	16249	Mr. Wilmot	277	' The best plan would be , '
16251	16286	16248	16249	Mr. Wilmot	277	' for me to go to him at once , and bring him home . If I go by the mail - train , I shall get to him sooner than a letter could . '
16287	16296	16298	16299	Mr. Ward	256	' And it will be better for him , '
16301	16331	16298	16299	Mr. Ward	256	' He will feel it dreadfully , poor boy . But we shall all do better when we have him . You can get back to - morrow evening . '
16332	16335	16337	16338	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Sunday , '
16340	16350	16337	16338	Mr. Wilmot	277	' I believe there is a train at four . '
16351	16359	16361	16361	Norman	227	' Oh ! thank you , sir , '
16363	16379	16381	16381	Alan	750	' Since that is settled , perhaps I had better go up to the Doctor , '
16383	16394	16396	16396	he	256	' I do n't like leaving Flora alone with him , '
16400	16409	16411	16412	Mr. Wilmot—'he	282	' How fortunate that that youth is here , '
16422	16423	16411	16412	Mr. Wilmot—'he	282	' '
16431	16436	16411	16412	Mr. Wilmot—'he	282	' said Mr. Ward . '

16460	16465	16455	16455	I	0	' asked Mr. Wilmot . '
16579	16651	16652	16652	God	283	' Flora at that moment half - opened the door , and called Mr. Ward , stopping for a moment to say it was for nothing of any consequence . Mr. Wilmot and Norman were left together . Norman put his hands over his face and groaned — his master looked at him with kind anxiety , but did not feel as if it were yet time to speak of consolation . '
16669	16680	16681	16681	I	0	' said he affectionately , as he pressed his hand ; '
16691	16692	16681	16681	I	0	' '
16698	16880	16696	16696	sir	7572	' was all Norman could say ; and as Mr. Wilmot went out by the front door , he slowly went up again , and lingering on the landing - place , was met by Mr. Ward , who told him to his relief — for the mere thinking of it renewed the faint sensation — that he had better not go to his father 's room . There was nothing to be done but to return to Ethel and Harry , and tell them all ; with some humiliation at being helpless , where Flora was doing so much , and to leave their father to be watched by a stranger . If he had been wanted , Norman might have made the effort , but being told that he would be worse than useless , there was nothing for him but to give way . They sat together in Ethel 's room , till somewhere between eight and nine o'clock , when good old nurse , having put her younger ones to bed , came in search of them . '
16888	17119	16696	16696	sir	7572	' said she , as she found them sitting in the dark ; she felt their cold hands , and made them all come into the nursery , where Mary was already , and , fondling them , one by one , as they passively obeyed her , she set them down on their little old stools round the fire , took away the high fender , and gave them each a cup of tea . Harry and Mary ate enough to satisfy her , from a weary craving feeling , and for want of employment ; Norman sat with his elbow on his knee , and a very aching head resting on his hand , glad of drink , but unable to eat ; Ethel could be persuaded to do neither , till she found old nurse would let her have no peace . The nurse sent them all to bed , taking the two girls to their own room , undressing them , and never leaving them until Mary was in a fair way of crying herself to sleep — for saying her prayers had brought the tears ; while Ethel lay so wide awake that it was of no use to wait for her , and then she went to the boys , tucked them each in , as when they were little children , and saying , '
17125	17666	16696	16696	sir	7572	' bestowed on each of them a kiss which came gratefully to Norman 's burning brow , and which even Harry 's boyish manliness could not resist . Flora was in Margaret 's room , too useful to be spared . So ended that dreadful Saturday . Lyra Innocentium . Such a strange sad Sunday ! No going to Church , but all the poor children moving in awe and oppression about the house , speaking under their breath , as they gathered in the drawing - room . Into the study , they might not go , and when Blanche would have asked why , Tom pressed her hand and shuddered . Etheldred was allowed to come and look at Margaret , and even to sit in the room for a little while , to take the place of Miss Winter ; but she was not sensible of sufficient usefulness to relieve the burden of fear and bewilderment in the presence of that still , pale form ; and , what was almost worse , the sight of the familiar objects , the chair by the fire , the sofa , the books , the work - basket , the letter - case , the dressing things , all these were too oppressive . She sat crouched up , with her face hidden in her hands , and the instant she was released , hastened back to Norman . She was to tell him that he might go into the room , but he did not move , and Mary alone went in and out with message . Dr. May was not to be visited , for he was in the same half - conscious state , apparently sensible only of bodily suffering , though he answered when addressed , and no one was trusted to speak to him but Flora and Alan Ernescliffe . The rest wore through the day as best they might . Harry slept a good deal , Ethel read to herself , and tried to get Norman to look at passages which she liked , Mary kept the little ones from being troublesome , and at last took them to peep behind the school - room blinds for Richard 's coming . There was a simultaneous shout when , at four o'clock , they caught sight of him , and though , at Ethel 's exclamation of wonder , Mary and Tom hung their heads at having forgotten themselves , the association of gladness in seeing Richard was refreshing ; the sense of being desolate and forsaken was relieved , and they knew that now they had one to rely on and to comfort them . Harry hastened to open the front - door , and Richard , with his small trim figure , and fresh , fair young face , flushed , though not otherwise agitated , was among them , almost devoured by the younger ones , and dealing out quiet caresses to them , as he caught from the words and looks of the others , that at least his father and sister were no worse . Mr. Wilmot had come with him , but only staid to hear the tidings . '
17672	17938	17670	17670	papa	7391	' were Richard 's first audible words — all the rest had been almost dumb show . Ethel thought not , but took him to Margaret 's room , where he stood for many minutes without speaking ; then whispered to Flora that he must go to the others , she should call him if — and went down , followed by Ethel . Tom and Blanche had fallen into teazing tricks , a sort of melancholy play to relieve the tedium . They grew cross . Norman was roused to reprove sharply , and Blanche was beginning to cry . But Richard 's entrance set all at peace — he sat down among them , and , with soft voice and arm round Blanche , as she leaned against him , made her good in a moment ; and she listened while he talked over with Norman and Ethel all they could bear to speak of . Late in the day , Flora came into her father 's room , and stood gazing at him , as he lay with eyes closed , breathing heavily , and his brows contracted by pain . She watched him with piteous looks , as if imploring him to return to his children . Poor girl , to - day 's quiet , after the last evening 's bustle , was hard to bear . She had then been distracted from thought by the necessity of exertion , but it now repayed itself , and she knew not how to submit to do nothing but wait and watch . '
17942	17953	17670	17670	papa	7391	' enquired Alan Ernescliffe ; looking kindly in her face . '
17956	17966	17967	17967	She	1123	' replied she in a low , mournful tone . '
17975	17987	17967	17967	She	1123	' A voice which she did not expect , asked inquiringly , '
17990	18016	17988	17988	Margaret	249	' and her heart beat as if it would take away her breath , as she saw her father 's eyes intently fixed on her . '
18023	18027	18018	18018	you	1124	' he repeated . '
18033	18055	18018	18018	you	1124	' said Flora , not losing presence of mind , though in extreme fear of what the next question might be . '
18070	18071	18018	18018	you	1124	' '
18076	18093	18018	18018	you	1124	' he said , and his whole voice and air showed him to be entirely roused . '
18102	18210	18211	18211	You	1126	' He continued his inquiries till Flora was obliged fully to explain her sister 's condition , and then he dismayed her by saying he would get up and go to see her . Much distressed , she begged him not to think of it , and appealed to Alan , who added his entreaties that he would at least wait for Mr. Ward ; but the Doctor would not relinquish his purpose , and sent her to give notice that he was coming . Mr. Ernescliffe followed her out of the room , and tried to console her , as she looked at him in despair . '
18221	18225	18226	18226	you	1126	' he said ; '
18236	18237	18226	18226	you	1126	' '
18257	18258	18259	18259	I	0	' '
18313	18314	18307	18307	you	1126	' '
18319	18338	18339	18339	she	1128	' said Flora , coming nearer , and almost gasping as she whispered and signed towards the door , '
18354	18355	18339	18339	she	1128	' '
18361	18365	18358	18358	he	1127	' said Alan . '
18471	18583	18590	18590	he	1127	' Flora went to prepare . Ethel eagerly undertook to send to Mr. Ward , and hastened from the room , as if in a sort of terror , shrinking perhaps from what might lead to an outburst of grief . She longed to have seen her father , but was frightened at the chance of meeting him . When she had sent her message , and told her brothers what was passing , she went and lingered on the stairs and in the passage for tidings . After what seemed a long time , Flora came out , and hastened to the nursery , giving her intelligence on the way . '
18621	18622	18624	18624	he	1127	' '
18628	18629	18624	18624	he	1127	' '

18808	19001	19002	19002	Papa	218	' Nurse promised , but the tears came so fast , and sobs with them , as she approached her master 's room , that Flora saw no composure could be expected from her ; and taking the infant from her , carried it in , leaving the door open for her to follow when wanted . Ethel stood by listening . There was silence at first , then some sounds from the baby , and her father 's voice soothing it , in his wonted caressing phrases and tones , so familiar that they seemed to break the spell , drive away her vague terrors , and restore her father . Her heart bounded , and a sudden impulse carried her to the bedside , at once forgetting all dread of seeing him , and chance of doing him harm . He lay , holding the babe close to him , and his face was not altered , so that there was nothing in the sight to impress her with the need of caution , and , to the consternation of the anxious Flora , she exclaimed , abruptly and vehemently , '
19010	19023	19002	19002	Papa	218	' Dr. May looked up at Ethel , then at the infant ; '
19026	19030	19002	19002	Papa	218	' he said , '
19034	19041	19002	19002	Papa	218	' Then added feebly and languidly , '
19049	19090	19042	19043	Some one	7708	' There was a pause , while Flora looked reproachfully at her sister , and Ethel became conscious of her imprudence , but in a few moments Dr. May spoke again , first to the baby , and then asking , '
19095	19096	19099	19099	papa	7391	' '
19101	19102	19099	19099	papa	7391	' '
19112	19145	19146	19146	Papa	218	' Ethel retreated , much alarmed at her rash measure , and when she related it , she saw that Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe both thought it had been a great hazard . '
19150	19265	19146	19146	Papa	218	' was a welcome sound to the ears of Richard , and brought a pink glow into his face . He was never one who readily showed his feelings , and there was no danger of his failing in self - command , though grievously down - cast , not only at the loss of the tender mother , who had always stood between him and his father 's impatience , but by the dread that he was too dull and insignificant to afford any help or comfort in his father 's dire affliction . Yet there was something in the gentle sad look that met him , and in the low tone of the '
19272	19290	19270	19270	Ritchie	262	' that drove off all thought of not being loved ; and when Dr. May further added , '
19305	19507	19508	19508	I	0	' he knew he was of use , and was encouraged and cheered . That his father had full confidence and reliance in him , and that his presence was a satisfaction and relief , he could no longer doubt ; and this was a drop of balm beyond all his hopes ; for loving and admiring his father intensely , and with depressed spirits and a low estimate of himself , he had begun to fancy himself incapable of being anything but a vexation and burthen . He sat with his father nearly all the evening , and was to remain with him at night . The rest were comforted by the assurance that Dr. May was still calm , and did not seem to have been injured by what had passed . Indeed , it seemed as if the violence and suddenness of the shock , together with his state of suffering , had deadened his sensations ; for there was far less agitation about him than could have been thought possible in a man of such strong , warm affections and sensitive temperament . Ethel and Norman went up arm - in - arm at bed - time . '
19521	19525	19508	19508	I	0	' said Ethel . '
19534	19626	19527	19527	I	0	' Norman hesitated , but his cheeks blanched ; he shuddered , shook his head without speaking , ran up after Harry , and waved her back when she would have followed . Richard told her that she might come in , and , as she slowly advanced , she thought she had never seen anything so ineffably mournful as the affectionate look on her father 's face . She held his hand and ventured — for it was with difficulty she spoke — to hope he was not in pain . '
19638	19659	19633	19633	you	1148	' he said , in a soft weak tone ; then , as she bent down to kiss his brow , '
19669	19670	19673	19673	papa	7391	' '
19675	19708	19673	19673	papa	7391	' she could hardly answer , and a large drop gathered slowly in each eye , long in coming , as if the heart ached too much for them to flow freely . '
19714	19715	19718	19718	papa	7391	' '
19720	19721	19718	19718	papa	7391	' '
19725	19737	19673	19673	papa	7391	' He held her hand , as if lengthening the interview . '
19745	19760	19673	19673	papa	7391	' A long deep sigh . Ethel 's two tears stood on her cheeks . '
19786	20019	19778	19778	you	7382	' Ethel went up - stairs , saddened and yet soothed . The calm silent sorrow , too deep for outward tokens , was so unlike her father 's usually demonstrative habits , as to impress her all the more , yet those two tears were followed by no more ; there was much strangeness and confusion in her mind in the newness of grief . She found poor Flora , spent with exertion , under the reaction of all she had undergone , lying on her bed , sobbing as if her heart would break , calling in gasps of irrepressible agony on mamma ! mamma ! yet with her face pressed down on the pillow that she might not be heard . Ethel , terrified and distressed , timidly implored her to be comforted , but it seemed as if she were not even heard ; she would have fetched some one , but whom ? Alas ! alas ! it brought back the sense that no mother would ever soothe them — Margaret , papa , both so ill , nurse engaged with Margaret ! Ethel stood helpless and despairing , and Flora sobbed on , so that Mary awakened to burst out in a loud frightened fit of crying ; but in a few moments a step was at the door , a knock , and Richard asked , '
20025	20269	20270	20270	Maggie	298	' He was in the room in a moment , caressing and saying affectionate things with gentleness and fondling care , like his mother , and which recalled the days when he had been proud to be left for a little while the small nurse and guardian of the lesser ones . Mary was hushed in a moment , and Flora 's exhausted weeping was gradually soothed , when she was able to recollect that she was keeping him from her father ; with kind good nights , he left Ethel to read to her till she could sleep . Long did Ethel read , after both her sisters were slumbering soundly ; she went on in a sort of dreamy grief , almost devoid of pain , as if all this was too terrible to be true ; and she had imagined herself into a story , which would give place at dawn to her ordinary life . At last she went to bed , and slept till wakened by the return of Flora , who had crept down in her dressing - grown to see how matters were going . Margaret was in the same state , papa was asleep , after a restless distressing night , with much pain and some fever ; and whenever Richard had begun to hope from his tranquillity , that he was falling asleep , he was undeceived by hearing an almost unconsciously uttered sigh of '
20275	20512	20513	20513	I	0	' and then the head turned wearily on the pillow , as if worn out with the misery from which there was no escape . Towards morning , the pain had lessened , and , as he slept , he seemed much less feverish than they could have ventured to expect . Norman looked man and wretched , and could taste no breakfast ; indeed Hary reported that he had been starting and talking in his sleep half the night , and had proceeded to groaning and crying out till , when it could be borne no longer , Harry waked him , and finished his night 's rest in peace . The children were kept in the drawing room that morning , and there were strange steps in the house ; but only Richard and Mr. Ernescliffe knew the reason . Happily there had been witnesses enough of the overturn to spare any reference to Dr. May — the violent start of the horses had been seen , and Adams and Mr. Ernescliffe agreed , under their breath , that the new black one was not fit to drive , while the whole town was so used to Dr. May 's headlong driving , that every one was recollecting their own predictions of accidents . There needed little to account for the disaster — the only wonder was , that it had not happened sooner . '
20516	20527	20513	20513	I	0	' announced Harry , soon after they were released again , '
20572	20652	20570	20570	Norman	227	' Norman started up , and walked hastily out of the room , but his hand shook so , that he could hardly open the door ; and Ethel , seeing how it was with him , followed him quickly , as he dashed , at full speed , up the stairs . At the top , however , he was forced to cling to the rail , gasping for breath , while the moisture started on his forehead . '
20656	20660	20653	20654	Dear Norman	227	' she said , '
20683	20702	20703	20703	I	0	' But he rested his head on his hand , and looked as if he could not stir . '
20710	20735	20703	20703	I	0	' said Ethel—'don't try — you will be better by - and - by , and he has not asked for you in particular . '
20736	20746	20748	20748	Norman	227	' I wo n't be beat by such stuff , '
20867	20875	20876	20876	he	227	' What does make me so ridiculous ? '
20939	20942	20944	20945	Mr. Ward	256	' Oh , '
20956	20980	20944	20945	Mr. Ward	256	' I 'll set that to rights in a minute , if you will ask for a tumbler of hotwater , Miss Ethel . '
21085	21095	21072	21072	his	298	' Would you like to come into the study ? '
21205	21219	21194	21194	Ethel	300	' They will never remember her ! Oh ! why should it be ? '
21409	21541	21381	21381	Alan	750	' experience , and relieving him of some of his tasks . He was indeed like one of themselves , and a most valuable help and comforter . Mr. Wilmot gave them all the time he could , and on this day saw the Doctor , who seemed to find some solace in his visit , though saying very little . On this day the baby was to be baptized . The usual Stoneborough fashion was to collect all the Christenings for the month into one Sunday , except those for such persons as thought themselves too refined to see their children Christened before the congregation , and who preferred an empty Church and a week - day . The little one had waited till she was nearly six weeks old for '
21546	21711	21714	21714	Ethel	300	' and since that had been missed , she could not be kept unbaptized for another month ; so , late in the day , she was carried to Church . Richard had extremely gratified old nurse , by asking her to represent poor Margaret , Mrs. Hoxton stood for the other godmother , and Alan Ernescliffe was desired to consider himself absolutely her sponsor , not merely a proxy . The younger children alone were to go with them : it was too far off , and the way lay too much through the town for it to be thought proper for the others to go . Ethel wished it very much , and thought it nonsense to care whether people looked at her ; and in spite of Miss Winter 's seeming shocked at her proposing it , had a great mind to persist . She would even have appealed to her papa , if Flora had not stopped her , exclaiming , '
21731	21805	21721	21726	a person so entirely without consideration	1180	' Much abashed , Ethel humbly promised that if she might go into papa 's room , she would not say one word about the Christening , unless he should begin , and , to her great satisfaction , he presently asked her to read the service to him . Flora came to the door - way of Margaret 's room , and listened ; when she had finished , all were silent . '
21821	21839	21840	21840	I	0	' was the thought with each of the girls . The answers were , in one mind , '
21936	21941	21922	21922	he	1125	' In the other , '
22044	22060	22062	22062	we	1189	' They heard the return of the others , and the sisters both sprang up , '
22068	22072	22062	22062	we	1189	' said Flora . '
22080	22129	22062	22062	we	1189	' The sisters all came down together with the little one , and Flora put her down within the arm her father stretched out for her . He gazed into the baby face , which , in its expressionless placidity , almost recalled her mother 's tranquil sweetness . '
22133	22152	22130	22131	Gertrude Margaret	249	' said Flora , and with a look that had more of tenderness than grief , he murmured , '
22161	22162	22164	22164	we	1196	' '
22166	22176	22164	22164	we	1196	' said Ethel , when Flora took her again , '
22192	22204	22187	22187	she	1197	' He looked as if he wished it ; but said , '
22216	22236	22207	22207	I	0	' and sighed heavily ; then , as they stood round his bed , unwilling to go , he added '
22257	22279	22280	22280	I	0	' Flora pressed the babe in her arms , Ethel 's two reluctant tears stood on her cheeks , Mary exclaimed , '
22288	22299	22280	22280	I	0	' and Blanche climbed up to kiss him , saying , '
22308	22309	22306	22306	papa	7391	' '
22321	22335	22336	22336	You	1202	' whispered Ethel , gaining sole possession of the babe for a minute . '
22406	22706	22404	22404	Daisy	300	' Lyra Innocentium . Dr. May took the management of himself into his own hands , and paid so little attention to Mr. Ward 's recommendations , that his sons and daughters were in continual dread of his choosing to do something that might cause injurious agitation . However , he did not attempt to go farther than Margaret 's bedside , where he sat hour after hour , his eyes fixed upon her , as she continued in a state bordering on insensibility . He took little notice of anything else , and hardly spoke . There were heavy sighs now and then , but Richard and Flora , one or other of whom were always watching him , could hardly tell whether to ascribe them to the oppression of sorrow , or of suffering . Their great fear was of his insisting on seeing his wife 's face , and it was a great relief that he never alluded to her , except once , to desire Richard to bring him her ring . Richard silently obeyed , and , without a word , he placed it on his little finger . Richard used to read the Psalms to him in the morning , before he was up , and Flora would bring little Daisy and lay her by his side . To the last moment , they dreaded his choosing to attend the funeral , and Flora had decided on remaining at home , though trembling at the thought of what there might be to go through . They tried to let him hear nothing about it , but he seemed to know every thing ; and when Flora came into Margaret 's room , without her bonnet , he raised his head , and said , '
22714	22715	22716	22717	The others	1027	' '
22732	22733	22734	22734	I	0	' '
22759	22932	22750	22750	I	0	' They decided that his wishes ought to be followed , and that the patients must be entrusted to old nurse . Richard told Flora , who looked very pale , that she would be glad of it afterwards , and she had his arm to lean upon . The grave was in the cloister attached to the Minster , a smooth green square of turf , marked here and there with small flat lozenges of stone , bearing the date and initials of those who lay there , and many of them recording former generations of Mays , to whom their descent from the head - master had given a right of burial there . Dr. Hoxton , Mr. Wilmot , and the surgeon , were the only friends whom Richard had asked to be with them , but the Minster was nearly full , for there was a very strong attachment and respect for Dr. and Mrs. May throughout the neighbourhood , and every one 's feelings were strongly excited . '
22944	23168	22750	22750	I	0	' There was a universal sound , as of a sort of sob , that Etheldred never disconnected from those words . Yet hardly one tear was shed by the young things who stood as close as they could round the grave . Harry and Mary did indeed lock their hands together tightly , and the shoulders of the former shook as he stood , bowing down his head , but the others were still and quiet , in part from awe and bewilderment , but partly , too , from a sense that it was against her whole nature that there should be clamorous mourning for her . The calm still day seemed to tell them the same , the sun beaming softly on the grey arches and fresh grass , the sky clear and blue , and the trees that shewed over the walls bright with autumn colouring , all suitable to the serenity of a life unclouded to its last moment . Some of them felt as if it were better to be there , than in their saddened desolate home . But home they must go , and , before going up - stairs , as Flora and Etheldred stood a moment or two with Norman , Ethel said in a tone of resolution , and of some cheerfulness , '
23177	23178	22750	22750	I	0	' '
23181	23185	22750	22750	I	0	' said Flora , '

23220	23224	23214	23214	she	249	' said Ethel . '
23231	23239	23225	23225	I	0	' and Flora went up - stairs . '

She thought it light - minded , though she could not help it , to look forward to the daily studies where she might lose her sad thoughts , and be as if everything were as usual . But suppose she should be to blame , where would now be the gentle discipline ? Poor Ethel 's feelings were not such as to deserve the imputation of levity , when this thought came over her ; but her buoyant mind , always seeking for consolation , recurred to Margaret 's improvement , and she fixed her hopes on her . Margaret was more alive to surrounding objects , and , when roused , she knew them all , answered clearly when addressed , had even , more than once , spoken of her own accord , and shewn solicitude at the sight of her father 's bandaged , helpless arm , but he soon soothed this away . He was more than ever watchful over her , and could scarcely be persuaded to leave her for one moment , in his anxiety to be at hand to answer , when first she should speak of her mother , a moment apprehended by all the rest , almost as much for his sake as for hers . So clear had her perceptions been , and so much more awake did she appear , on this evening , that he expected the enquiry to come every moment , and lingered in her room ; till she asked the hour , and begged him to go to bed . As he bent over her , she looked up in his face , and said , softly , '
24037	24070	24034	24035	Dear papa	1125	' There was that in her tone which showed she perceived the truth , and he knelt by her side kissing her , but not daring to relax his restraint of feeling . '

24264	24668	24261	24262	dear papa	1125	' When Dr. May had left her , and tried to tell Richard how it had been , the tears cut him short , and had their free course ; but there was much of thankfulness , for it might be looked on as the restoration of his daughter ; the worst was over , and the next day he was able to think of other things , had more attention to spare for the rest , and when the surgeon came , took some professional interest in the condition of his own arm , inquired after his patients , and even talked of visiting them . In the meantime , Margaret sent for her eldest brother , begging him to tell her the whole , and it was heard as calmly and firmly as it was told . Her bodily state lulled her mind ; and besides it was not new ; she had observed much while her faculties were still too much benumbed for her to understand all , or to express her feelings . Her thoughts seemed chiefly occupied with her father . She made Richard explain to her the injury he had suffered , and begged to know whether his constant attendance on her , could do him harm . She was much rejoiced when her brother assured her that nothing could be better for him and she began to say with a smile , that very likely her being hurt had been fortunate . She asked who had taken care of him before Richard 's arrival , and was pleased to hear that it was Mr. Ernescliffe . A visit from the little Gertrude Margaret was happily accomplished , and , on the whole , the day was most satisfactory — she herself declaring that she could not see that there was anything the matter with her , except that she felt lazy , and did not seem able to move . Thus the next Sunday morning dawned with more cheerfulness . Dr. May came down stairs for the first time , in order to go to Church with his whole flock , except the two Margarets . He looked very wan and shattered , but they clustered gladly round him , when he once more stood among them , little Blanche securing his hand , and nodding triumphantly to Mr. Ernescliffe , as much as to say , '
24680	24942	24943	24943	I	0	' Norman alone was missing ; but he was in his place at Church among the boys . Again in returning , he slipped out of the party , and was at home the first , and when this recurred in the afternoon , Ethel began to understand his motive . The High - street led past the spot where the accident had taken place , though neither she nor any of the others knew exactly where it was , except Norman , on whose mind the scene was branded indelibly ; she guessed that it was to avoid it that he went along what was called Randall 's Alley , his usual short cut to school . That Sunday brought back to the children that there was no one to hear their hymns ; but Richard was a great comfort , watching over the little ones more like a sister than a brother . Ethel was ashamed of herself when she saw him taking thought for them , tying Blanche 's bonnet , putting Aubrey 's gloves on , teaching them to put away their Sunday toys , as if he meant them to be as neat and precise as himself . Dr. May did not encounter the family dinner , nor attempt a second going to Church ; but Blanche was very glorious , as she led him down to drink tea , and , before going up again , he had a conversation with Alan Ernescliffe , who felt himself obliged to leave Stoneborough early on the morrow .

26655	26704	26636	26636	Flora	280	' Here is dear mama 's unfinished letter to aunt Flora . Papa says we elder ones are to read it . It is a description of us all , and very much indeed we ought to learn from it . I shall keep a copy of it . '
26803	27738	26792	26792	her	1275	' You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies , and if I do not write in these leisure days , you will hardly get it after I am in the midst of business again . The new Daisy is like Margaret at the same age — may she continue like her ! Pretty creature , she can hardly be more charming than at present . Aubrey , the moon - faced , is far from reconciled to his deposition from babyhood ; he is a sober , solemn gentleman , backward in talking , and with such a will of his own , as will want much watching ; very different from Blanche , who is Flora over again , perhaps prettier , and more fairy - like , unless this is only one 's admiration for the buds of the present season . None of them has ever been so winning as this little maid , who even attracts Dr. Hoxton himself , and obtains sugar - plums and kisses . " Rather she than I , " says Harry , but notice is notice to the white Mayflower , and there is my anxiety — I am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to get a rebuff . I hope having a younger sister , and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary . Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty , and the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen . My poor Tom has not such a happy life as Blanche , he is often in trouble at lessons , and bullied by Harry at play , in spite of his champion , Mary ; and yet I can not interfere , for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teazing , before he goes into school . He has good abilities , but not much perseverance or energy , and I must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his school - days begin , in hopes of instilling them . The girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys , I suppose ; Harry is too kind and generous to do more than teaze him moderately , and Norman will see that it does not go too far . It is a common saying that Tom and Mary made a mistake , that he is the girl , and she the boy , for she is a rough , merry creature , the noisiest in the house , always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom , and yet devoted to him , and wanting to do everything he does . Those two , Harry and Mary , are exactly alike , except for Harry 's curly mane of lion - coloured wig . The " yellow haired laddie " is papa 's name for Harry , which he does not mind from him , though furious if the girls attempt to call him so . Harry is the thorough boy of the family , all spirit , recklessness , and mischief , but so true , and kind , and noble - hearted , that one loves him the better after every freely confessed scrape . I can not tell you how grateful I am to my boy for his perfect confidence , the thing that chiefly lessens my anxiety for him in his half - school , half - home life , which does not seem to me to work quite well with him . There are two sons of Mrs. Anderson 's at the school , who are more his friends than I like , and he is too easily led by the desire not to be outdone , and to show that he fears nothing . Lately , our sailor - guest has inspired him with a vehement wish to go to sea ; I wish it was not necessary that the decision should be made so early in life , for this fault is just what would make us most fear to send him into the world very young , though in some ways it might not do amiss for him . So much for the younger bairns , whom you never beheld , dear Flora . The three whom you left , when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together , now look as if any pair of them were twins , for Norman is the tallest , almost outgrowing his strength , and Ethel 's sharp face , so like her papa 's , makes her look older than Flora . Norman and Ethel do indeed take after their papa , more than any of the others , and are much alike . There is the same brilliant cleverness , the same strong feeling , not easy of demonstration , though impetuous in action ; but poor Ethel 's old foibles , her harum - scarum nature , quick temper , uncouth manners , and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object , have kept her back , and caused her much discomfort ; yet I sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end . They are faults that show themselves , and which one can tell how to deal with , and I have full confidence that she has the principle within her that will conquer them . '
27739	27742	27745	27745	Ethel	300	' If — '
27754	27947	27745	27745	Ethel	300	' My great hope is her entire indifference to praise — not approval , but praise . If she has not come up to her own standard , she works on , not always with good temper , but perseveringly , and entirely , unheeding of commendation till she has satisfied herself , only thinking it stupid not to see the faults . It is this independence of praise that I want to see in her brother and sister . They justly earn it , and are rightly pleased with it ; but I can not feel sure whether they do not depend on it too much . Norman lives , like all school - boys , a life of emulation , and has never met with anything but success . I do believe Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Wilmot are as proud of him as we are ; and he has never shown any tendency to conceit , but I am afraid he has the love of being foremost , and pride in his superiority , caring for what he is , compared with others , rather than what he is himself . '
27948	27952	27954	27954	Norman	227	' I know , '
27956	27996	27954	27954	Norman	227	' I have done so , but that 's over . I see what it is worth . I 'd give all the quam optimès I ever got in my life to be the help Richard is to papa . '
27997	28006	27745	27745	Ethel	300	' You would if you were his age . '

28018	28033	27745	27745	Ethel	300	'm not like her . But are we to go on about the elders ? '
28034	28057	27745	27745	Ethel	300	' Oh ! yes , do n't let us miss a word . There ca n't be anything but praise of them . '
28058	28525	28017	28017	I	0	' Your sweet goddaughter . I almost feel as if I had spoken in disparagement of her , but I meant no such thing , dear girl . It would be hard to find a fault in her , since the childish love of admiration was subdued . She is so solid and steady , as to be very valuable with the younger ones , and is fast growing so lovely , that I wish you could behold her . I do not see any vanity , but there lies my dread , not of beauty - vanity , but that she will find temptation in the being everywhere liked and sought after . As to Margaret , my precious companion and friend , you have heard enough of her to know her , and , as to telling you what she is like , I could as soon set about describing her papa . When I thought of not being spared to them this time , it was happiness indeed to think of her at their head , fit to be his companion , with so much of his own talent as to be more up to conversation with him , than he could ever have found his stupid old Maggie . It was rather a trial of her discretion to have Mr. Ernescliffe here while I was up - stairs , and very well she seems to have come out of it . Poor Richard 's last disappointment is still our chief trouble . He has been working hard with a tutor all through the vacation , and has not even come home to see his new sister , on his way to Oxford . He had made a resolution that he would not come to us , till he had passed , and his father thought it best that it should be kept . I hope he will succeed next time , but his nervousness renders it still more doubtful . With him it is the very reverse of Norman . He suffers too much for want of commendation , and I can not wonder at it , when I see how much each failure vexes his father , and Richard little knows how precious is our perfect confidence in him , how much more valuable than any honours he could earn . You would be amused to see how little he is altered from the pretty little fair fellow , that you used to say , was so like my old portrait , even the wavy rings of light glossy hair sit on his forehead , just as you liked to twist them ; and his small trim figure is a fine contrast to Norman 's long legs and arms , which — '
28558	28574	28576	28576	Ethel	300	' So there you are up for the day — really you look very comfortable , '
28600	28623	28625	28625	Margaret	249	' Yes , is not it a charming contrivance of Richard 's ? It quite gives me the use of my hands , '
28627	28638	28640	28640	Ethel	300	' I think he is doing something else for you , '

29124	29154	29119	29119	Margaret	249	' and he quite agrees to it . Indeed it is impossible that Anne should attend properly to all the children while nurse is so much engaged with me . '

29164	29195	29162	29162	Flora	280	' and it does not answer to bring Aubrey into the school - room . It only makes Mary and Blanche idle , and Miss Winter does not like it . '
29196	29230	29119	29119	Margaret	249	' Then the question is , who shall it be ? Nurse has no one in view , and only protests against " one of the girls out of the school here . " '

29528	29565	29526	29526	he	298	' O , I see ; it is the old drawing - desk that no one used . And you have put legs to it — how famous ! You are the best contriver , Richard ! '
29566	29600	29526	29526	he	298	' Then see , you can raise it up for reading or writing ; here 's a corner for your ink to stand flat ; and there it is down for your dinner . '
29601	29642	29526	29526	he	298	' Charming , you have made it go so easily , when it used to be so stiff . There — give me my work - basket , please , Ethel ; I mean to make some more white puffs . '
29643	29652	29654	29654	Flora	280	' What 's the matter now , Ethel ? '
29656	29669	29654	29654	Flora	280	' you look as if you did not approve of the table . '
29670	29693	29695	29695	Ethel	300	' I was only thinking it was as if she was settling herself to lie in bed for a very long time , '
29697	29705	29695	29695	Ethel	300	' I hope not , said Richard ; '
29727	29728	29707	29707	I	0	' '
29742	29753	29740	29740	Ethel	300	' said Flora . You would be horrid to nurse ! '
29754	29766	29768	29768	Margaret	249	' She will know how to be grateful when she is , '
29770	29776	29778	29778	Ethel	300	' I say , Richard , '
29780	29798	29778	29778	Ethel	300	' this is hospital - meeting day , so you wo n't be wanted to drive papa . '
29813	30050	29808	29808	you	300	' So it was determined that Richard and Ethel should walk together to Cocksmoor . No two people could be much more unlike than Richard and Etheldred May ; but they were very fond of each other . Richard was sometimes seriously annoyed by Ethel 's heedlessness , and did not always understand her sublimities , but he had a great deal of admiration for one who partook so much of his father 's nature ; and Ethel had a due respect for her eldest brother , gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses , a reverence for his sterling goodness , and his exemption from her own besetting failings , only a little damped by compassionate wonder at his deficiency in talent , and by her vexation at not being always comprehended . They went by the road , for the plantation gate was far too serious an undertaking for anyone not in the highest spirits for enterprise . On the way there was a good deal of that desultory talk , very sociable and interesting , that is apt to prevail between two people , who would never have chosen each other for companions , if they were not of the same family , but who are nevertheless very affectionate and companionable . Ethel was anxious to hear what her brother thought of papa 's spirits , and whether he talked in their drives . '
30053	30057	29808	29808	you	300	' said Richard . '
30090	30091	30080	30080	he	1294	' '
30096	30100	30093	30093	he	1294	' said Ethel . '
30133	30134	30135	30136	Some people	1295	' '
30148	30152	30156	30156	they	1295	' said Richard . '
30186	30195	30197	30197	Richard	298	' Margaret is a great comfort to him , '
30199	30240	30197	30197	Richard	298	' That she is . She thinks of him all day long , and I do n't think either of them is ever so happy as in the evening , when he sits with her . They talk about mamma then '
30295	30307	30309	30309	Richard	298	' It will be a long business , I am afraid , '
30311	30333	30309	30309	Richard	298	' Indeed , he said the other day , he thought he should never have the free use of the elbow . '
30334	30384	30252	30252	he	298	' And do you think it is very painful ? I saw the other day , when Aubrey was sitting on his knee and fidgetting , he shrank whenever he even came towards it , and yet it seemed as if he could not bear to put him down . '
30385	30401	30309	30309	Richard	298	' Yes , it is excessively tender , and sometimes gets very bad at night . '
30402	30405	30407	30407	Ethel	300	' Ah , '
30409	30447	30407	30407	Ethel	300	' there 's a line — here — round his eyes , that there never used to be , and when it deepens , I am sure he is in pain , or has been kept awake . '
30448	30477	30478	30478	I	0	' You are very odd , Ethel ; how do you see things in people 's faces , when you miss so much at just the same distance ? '
30486	30490	30478	30478	I	0	' said Ethel . '
30509	30510	30478	30478	I	0	' '
30519	30524	30513	30513	you	300	' said Richard gravely . '
30537	30564	30565	30565	I	0	' said Ethel . Richard shook his head , not quite satisfied , but not sure enough that he entered into her meaning to question it . '
30573	30604	30567	30567	you	300	' was the result of his meditation , and it made her laugh by being so inapposite to her own reflections ; but the laugh ended in a melancholy look . '
30615	30851	30852	30852	I	0	' she said , in a low voice . Thus they talked till they arrived at Cocksmoor , where poor Mrs. Taylor , inspirited by better reports of her husband and the hopes for her daughter , was like another woman . Richard was very careful not to raise false expectations , saying it all depended on Miss May and nurse , and what they thought of her strength and steadiness , but these cautions did not seem capable of damping the hopes of the smooth - haired Lucy , who stood smiling and curtseying . The twins were grown and improved , and Ethel supposed they would be brought to Church on the next Christening Sunday , but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting them so far , and how was she to get gossips ? Ethel began to grow very indignant , but she was always shy of finding fault with poor people to their faces when she would not have done so to persons in her own station , and so she was silent , while Richard hoped they would be able to manage , and said it would be better not to wait another month for still worse weather and shorter days . As they were coming out of the house , a big , rough - looking , uncivilized boy came up before them , and called out , '
30864	30865	30857	30859	the young Doctor	1304	' '
30873	30893	30894	30894	Granny	307	' said Richard ; while Ethel , startled , clung to his arm , in dread of some rudeness . '
30898	30993	30894	30894	Granny	307	' said the boy ; proceeding without further explanation to lead the way to another hovel , though Richard tried to explain that the knowledge of medicine was not in his case hereditary . A poor old woman sat groaning over the fire , and two children crouched , half - clothed on the bare floor . Richard 's gentle voice and kind manner drew forth some wonderful descriptions—'her head was all of a goggle , her legs all of a fur , she felt as if some one was cutting right through her . '
30994	30997	30999	30999	Richard	298	' Well , '
31003	31031	30999	30999	Richard	298	' I am no Doctor myself , but I 'll ask my father about you , and perhaps he can give you an order for the hospital . '
31032	31077	30894	30894	Granny	307	' No , no , thank ye , Sir ; I ca n't go to the hospital , I ca n't leave these poor children ; they 've no father nor mother , Sir , and no one to do for them but me . '
31078	31088	31090	31090	Richard	298	' What do you all live on , then ? '
31098	31141	30894	30894	Granny	307	' On Sam 's wages , Sir ; that 's that boy . He is a good boy to me , Sir , and his little sisters ; he brings it , all he gets , home to me , rig'lar , but '
31152	31176	30894	30894	Granny	307	'em take half of it out in goods and beer , which is a bad thing for a boy like him , Sir . '
31177	31185	31186	31186	Sam	308	' How old are you , Sam ? '
31275	31280	31282	31282	Richard	298	' A wretched place , '
31287	31340	31282	31282	Richard	298	' I do n't know what help there is for the people . There 's no one to do any thing for them , and it is of no use to tell them to come to Church when it is so far off , and there is so little room for them . '
31341	31346	31348	31348	Ethel	300	' It is miserable , '
31532	31535	31537	31537	Ethel	300	' Richard , '
31539	31581	31537	31537	Ethel	300	' I 'll tell you what . Suppose we were to set up a Sunday - school at Cocksmoor . We could get a room , and walk there every Sunday afternoon , and go to Church in the evening instead . '
31607	31612	31600	31600	she	300	' Well , Richards ! '
31613	31619	31620	31620	he	298	' I can not tell , '
31623	31648	31620	31620	he	298	' Going to Church in the evening would interfere with tea - time — put out all the house — make the evening uncomfortable . '
31649	31659	31661	31661	Ethel	300	' The evenings are horrid now , especially Sundays , '
31663	31676	31661	31661	Ethel	300	' But missing two more would make them worse for the others . '
31677	31684	31686	31686	Ethel	300	' Papa is always with Margaret , '
31688	31709	31686	31686	Ethel	300	' We are of no use to him . Besides those poor children — are not they of more importance ? '
31710	31723	31661	31661	Ethel	300	' And , then , what is to become of Stoneborough school ? '
31724	31729	31731	31731	Ethel	300	' I hate it , '
31906	31907	31938	31938	Papa	218	' '
31926	31937	31938	31938	Papa	218	' Ethel was slightly taken aback , but only said , '
31948	31949	31944	31944	he	218	' '
31959	31963	31953	31953	you	0	' said Richard . '
31972	31976	31970	31970	him	218	' said Ethel , '
32048	32049	32040	32040	papa	7391	' '
32065	32071	32054	32054	Ethel	300	' A silence,—then she exclaimed , '
32097	32098	32040	32040	papa	7391	' '
32103	32249	32040	32040	papa	7391	' The rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone , so opened Ethel 's heart , that she went on eagerly:—'The history of it is this . Last time we walked here , that day , I said , and I meant it , that I would never put it out of my head ; I would go on doing and striving , and trying , till this place was properly cared for , and has a Church and a Clergyman . I believe it was a vow , Richard , I do believe it was,—and if one makes one , one must keep it . There it is . So , I ca n't give money , I have but one pound in the world , but I have time , and I would make that useful , if you would help me . '
32250	32257	32054	32054	Ethel	300	' I do n't see how , '
32401	32403	32390	32390	she	7395	' larmoyante '
32408	32432	32390	32390	she	7395	' I wish I could pick my way better . Some people have the gift , you have hardly a splash , and I 'm
32440	32441	32390	32390	she	7395	' '
32448	32452	32390	32390	she	7395	' said Richard ; '
32474	32475	32465	32465	you	1329	' '
32482	32506	32476	32476	My	0	' said Ethel , disconsolately , crumpling the black folds into one hand , while she hunted for a pin with the other . '
32518	32522	32511	32511	you	1329	' said Richard . '
32560	32564	32540	32540	you	1329	' Ethel laughed . '
32610	32672	32681	32681	she	1336	' They met Dr. May at the entrance of the town , very tired , and saying he had been a long tramp , all over the place , and Mrs. Hoxton had been boring him with her fancies . As he took Richard 's arm he gave the long heavy sigh that always fell so painfully on Ethel 's ear . '
32683	32698	32681	32681	she	1336	' my work must also be to do all I can to comfort him . '
32709	32761	32705	32706	Dr. May	238	' Ethel , do n't make such a figure of yourself . Those muddy ancles and petticoats are not fit to be seen — there , now you are sweeping the pavement . Have you no medium ? One would think you had never worn a gown in your life before ! '
32851	32883	32843	32843	nurse	7474	' Miss Ethel ! Miss Ethel , you arn't going up with them boots on ! I do declare you are just like one of the boys . And your frock ! '
32979	32991	32937	32937	Margaret	249	' Well , Ethel , have you had a pleasant walk ? '
32992	33000	33003	33003	herself	249	' Yes — no — Oh Margaret ! '
33016	33028	33011	33011	she	249	' Ethel , dear , what is the matter ? Papa — '
33029	33061	32937	32937	Margaret	249	' No — no — only I draggled my frock , and Richard threw cold water . And I am good for nothing ! Oh ! if mamma was but here ! '
33062	33097	32937	32937	Margaret	249	' Darling Ethel , dear Ethel , I wish I could comfort you . Come a little nearer to me , I ca n't reach you ! Dear Ethel , what has gone wrong ? '
33098	33102	33104	33104	Ethel	300	' Every thing , '
33106	33128	33130	33130	she	1351	' No — I'm too dirty to come on your white bed ; I forgot , you wo n't like it , '
33137	33150	33152	33152	Margaret	249	' You are wet , you are cold , you are tired , '
33154	33207	33152	33152	Margaret	249	' Stay here and dress , do n't go up in the cold . There , sit by the fire , pull off your frock and stockings , and we will send for the others . Let me see you look comfortable — there . Now tell me who threw cold water . '
33208	33215	33217	33217	Ethel	300	' It was figurative cold water , '
33224	33261	33217	33217	Ethel	300	' I was only silly enough to tell Richard my plan , and it 's horrid to talk to a person who only thinks one high - flying and nonsensical — and then came the dirt . '
33262	33271	33152	33152	Margaret	249	' But what was the scheme , Ethel ? '
33272	33275	33277	33277	Ethel	300	' Cocksmoor , '
33284	33290	33292	33292	Margaret	249	' I wish we could , '
33294	33309	33292	33292	Margaret	249	' It would be an excellent thing . But how did Richard vex you ? '
33310	33316	33318	33318	Ethel	300	' I do n't know , '
33320	33343	33292	33292	Margaret	249	' only he thought it would not do . Perhaps he said right , but it was coldly , and he smiled . '
33344	33355	33357	33357	Margaret	249	' He is too sober - minded for our flights , '
33359	33409	33410	33410	Ethel	300	' I know the feeling of it , Ethel dear ; but you know if he did see that some of your plans might not answer , it is no reason you should not try to do something at once . You have not told me about the girl . '
33417	33420	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' There ! '
33426	33507	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' there are two ways of helping Cocksmoor already . Could you not make some clothes for the two grand - children ? I could help you a little , and then , if they were well clothed , you might get them to come to the Sunday - school . And as to the twins , I wonder what the hire of a cart would be to bring the Christening party ? It is just what Richard could manage . '
33508	33511	33513	33513	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
33515	33525	33513	33513	Ethel	300	' but those are only little isolated individual things ! '
33526	33534	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' But one must make a beginning . '
33535	33557	33559	33559	Ethel	300	' Then , Margaret , you think it was a real vow ? You do n't think it silly of me ? '
33563	33646	33559	33559	Ethel	300	' Ethel , dear , I do n't think dear mamma would say we ought to make vows , except what the Church decrees for us . I do n't think she would like the motion of your considering yourself pledged ; but I do think , that , after all you have said and felt about Cocksmoor , and being led there on that day , it does seem as if we might be intended to make it our especial charge . '
33647	33662	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' O Margaret , I am glad you say so . You always understand . '
33663	33702	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' But you know we are so young , that now we have not her to judge for us , we must only do little things that we are quite sure of , or we shall get wrong . '
33703	33714	33559	33559	Ethel	300	' That 's not the way great things were done . '
33715	33742	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' I do n't know , Ethel ; I think great things ca n't be good unless they stand on a sure foundation of little ones . '
33743	33782	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' Well , I believe Richard was right , and it would not do to begin on Sunday , but he was so tame ; and then my frock , and the horrid deficiency in those little neatnesses . '
33783	33885	33422	33422	Margaret	249	' Perhaps that is good for you in one way ; you might get very high - flying if you had not the discipline of those little tiresome things ; correcting them will help you , and keep your high things from being all romance . I know dear mamma used to say so ; that the trying to conquer them was a help to you . O , here 's Mary ! Mary , will you get Ethel 's dressing things ? She has come home wet - footed and cold , and has been warming herself by my fire . '
33949	34106	34107	34107	Dear	1118	' stay with her , that precious time when she knew that sad as the talk often was , it was truly a comfort to him . It ended when ten o'clock struck , and he went down — Margaret hearing the bell , the sounds of the assembling servants , the shutting of the door , the stillness of prayer time , the opening again , the feet moving off in different directions , then brothers and sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her good - night , nurse and Flora arranging her for the night , Flora coming to sleep in her little bed in the corner of the room , and , lastly , her father 's tender good - night , and melancholy look at her , and all was quiet , except the low voices and movements as Richard attended him in his own room . Margaret could think : '
34282	34283	34274	34274	He	283	' '
34304	34505	34274	34274	He	283	' Wordsworth . Etheldred awoke long before time for getting up , and lay pondering over her visions . Margaret had sympathized , and therefore they did not seem entirely aërial . To earn money by writing was her favourite plan , and she called her various romances in turn before her memory , to judge which might be brought down to sober pen and ink . She considered till it became not too unreasonably early to get up . It was dark , but there was a little light close to the window : she had no writing - paper , but she would interline her old exercisebook . Down she ran , and crouching in the school - room window - seat , she wrote on in a trance of eager composition , till Norman called her , as he went to school , to help him to find a book . This done , she went up to visit Margaret , to tell her the story , and consult her . But this was not so easy . She found Margaret with little Daisy lying by her , and Tom sitting by the fire over his Latin . '

34528	34540	34508	34508	Ethel	300	' said Ethel , as the child was fretting a little . '

34582	34598	34573	34574	O Margaret	312	' said Ethel , as she walked about with little Gertrude ; but Tom interrupted . '
34611	34634	34602	34602	you	249	' and the thumbed Latin grammar came across her just as Dr. May 's door opened , and he came in exclaiming , '

35606	35666	35599	35600	dear mamma	1184	' An interruption occurred , and Ethel had to go down to breakfast with a mind floating between romance , sorrow , and high aspirations , very unlike the actual world she had to live in . First , there was a sick man walking into the study , and her father , laying down his letters , saying , '
35698	35699	35700	35700	I	0	' '
35709	35717	35718	35718	He	0	' said Flora , as he went . '
35743	35755	35731	35731	he	0	' Richard went on in silence , cutting bread and butter . '
35761	35765	35731	35731	he	0	' said Mary . '
35797	36263	35791	35791	I	0	' The morning was tiresome ; though Dr. May had two regular days for seeing poor people at his house , he was too good - natured to keep strictly to them , and this day , as Flora had predicted , there was a procession of them not soon got rid of , even by his rapid queries and the talismanic figures made by his left hand on scraps of paper , with which he sent them off to the infirmary . Ethel tried to read ; the children lingered about ; it was a trial of temper to all but Tom , who obtained Richard 's attention to his lessons . He liked to say them to his brother , and this was an incentive to learn them quickly , that none might remain for Miss Winter when Richard went out with his father . If mamma had been there , she would have had prayers ; but now no one had authority enough , though they did at last even finish breakfast . Just as the gig came to the door , Dr. May dismissed his last patient , rang the bell in haste , and as soon as prayers were over , declared he had an appointment , and had no time to eat . There was a general outcry , that it was bad enough when he was well , and now he must not take liberties ; Flora made him drink some tea ; and Richard placed morsels in his way , while he read his letters . He ran up for a final look at Margaret , almost upset the staid Miss Winter as he ran down again , called Richard to take the reins , and was off . It was French day , always a trial to Ethel . M. Ballompré , the master , knew what was good and bad French , but could not render a reason , and Ethel , being versed in the principles of grammar , from her Latin studies , chose to know the why and wherefore of his corrections — she did not like to see her pages defaced , and have no security against future errors ; while he thought her a troublesome pupil , and was put out by her questions . They wrangled , Miss Winter was displeased , and Ethel felt injured . Mary 's inability to catch the pronunciation , and her hopeless dull look when she found that coeur must not be pronounced cour , nor cur , but something between , to which her rosy English lips could never come — all this did not tease M. Ballompré , for he was used to it . His mark for Ethel 's lesson was '
36266	36269	35791	35791	I	0	' humeur . '
36270	36275	36277	36278	Miss Winter	214	' I am sorry , '
36285	36299	36277	36278	Miss Winter	214	' I thought you had outgrown that habit of disputing over every phrase . '
36300	36321	36323	36323	Ethel	300	' I ca n't tell how a language is to be learnt without knowing the reasons of one 's mistakes , '
36325	36369	36323	36323	Ethel	300	' That is what you always say , my dear . It is of no use to renew it all , but I wish you would control yourself . Now , Mary , call Blanche , and you and Ethel take your arithmetic . '
36598	36607	36594	36594	she	220	' O Mary , do n't murder it ! '
36608	36612	36614	36614	Mary	220	' Murder what ? '
36623	36632	36594	36594	she	220	' That use of exaggerated language,'—began Miss Winter . '
36640	36664	36636	36636	Papa	218	' said Ethel , only wanting to silence Miss Winter . In a cooler moment , she would not have used the argument . '
36688	36689	36683	36683	you	0	' '
36708	36713	36715	36716	Miss Winter	214	' That is declaiming , '
36718	36738	36715	36716	Miss Winter	214	' It is not what we wish for in a lady . You are neglecting your work and interfering . '
36812	36816	36817	36817	she	300	' See here , '
36821	36846	36817	36817	she	300	' I thought you would like to make up this old frock for one of the Cocksmoor children ; but what is the matter ? '
36859	36870	36817	36817	she	300	' O nothing , only Miss Winter is so tiresome . '
36871	36876	36817	36817	she	300	' What was it ? '
36877	36901	36817	36817	she	300	' Every thing , it was all horrid . I was cross I know , but she and M. Ballompré made me so ; '
36953	36982	36929	36929	he	227	' Well , Norman , you are out of breath , sit down and rest . What is doing at school ? are you dux of your class ? '
36983	36992	37016	37016	they	1410	' Yes , said the boy , wearily . '
36999	37003	36929	36929	he	227	' said Ethel . '

37075	37128	37066	37066	Margaret	249	' said Norman , who considered it his privilege to wait on Margaret at dinner . When he had brought the tray , he stood leaning against the bed - post , musing . Suddenly , there was a considerable clatter of fire - irons , and his violent start surprised Margaret . '
37136	37199	37129	37129	Ethel	300	' she said , as if no more was needed to account for their insecurity . Norman put them up again , but a ringing sound betrayed that it was not with a firm touch , and when , a minute after , he came to take her plate , she saw that he was trying with effort to steady his hand . '
37211	37212	37205	37205	you	227	' '
37218	37232	37205	37205	you	227	' said he , as if vexed that she had taken any notice . '
37242	37254	37256	37256	she	1413	'm not worth inquiries now , I am so much better , '
37272	37285	37286	37286	she	1413	' I do n't like you to lose your foot - ball , '
37289	37294	37286	37286	she	1413	' I could not — '
37300	37309	37311	37311	she	1413	' It would be much better for you , '
37405	37424	37398	37399	that nurse	1415	' If you please , Miss Margaret , there is a girl come to see about the place . '
37446	37480	37435	37435	Margaret	249	' Her name is Taylor , and she comes from Cocksmoor , but she is a nice tidy , strong - looking girl , and she says she has been used to children . '
37517	37536	37504	37504	She	280	' If you please , nurse , but if you think she will do , that is enough . '
37537	37561	37562	37563	So nurse	1420	' Yes , Miss , but you should look to them things yourself . If you please , I 'll bring her up . '
37566	37569	37571	37571	Ethel	300	' Charming ! '
37573	37590	37571	37571	Ethel	300	' that 's your capital management , Flora Nurse thinks she has done it all herself . '
37597	37601	37591	37591	She	1419	' said Flora , '
37609	37773	37774	37774	I	0	' Lucy Taylor came in , looking very nice , and very shy , curtseying low , in extreme awe of the pale lady in bed . Margaret was much pleased with her , and there was no more to be done but to settle that she should come on Saturday , and to let nurse take her into the town to invest her with the universal blackness of the household , where the two Margarets were the only white things . This arranged , and the walking party set forth , Ethel sat down by her sister 's bed , and began to assist in unpicking the merino , telling Margaret how much obliged she was to her for thinking of it , and how grieved at having been so ungrateful in the morning . She was very happy over her contrivances , cutting out under her sister 's superintendence . She had forgotten the morning 's annoyance , till Margaret said , '

That watchful , protecting , guarding , mother 's love , a shadow of Providence , had been round them so constantly on every side , that they had been hardly conscious of it till it was lost to them .

38581	38606	38579	38579	Margaret	249	' I have been sitting up longer than usual , and it is tired . Will you call nurse to lay me flat again ? '
38921	38928	38930	38930	he	238	' It is of no use , '
38932	38966	38930	38930	he	238	' Ethel will give no attention to anything but her books ! I 've a great mind to put an end to all the Latin and Greek ! She cares for nothing else . '

39005	39025	38980	38980	she	300	' Do n't talk nonsense . Your best , indeed ! If you had taken the most moderate care — '
39026	39036	39038	39038	Margaret	249	' I believe Ethel took rather too much care , '
39051	39065	39038	39038	Margaret	249	' It will be all right presently . Never mind , dear Papa . '

39339	39363	39320	39320	she	249	' Oh , you did not , it was too bad of me — I am grieved ; are you quite comfortable now ? '
39364	39421	39320	39320	she	249	' Yes , quite , only a little head - ache , which I shall sleep off . It has been so nice and quiet . Papa took up George Herbert , and has been reading me choice bits . I do n't think I have enjoyed any thing so much since I have been ill . '
39422	39455	39320	39320	she	249	' I am glad of that , but I have been unhappy all the evening . I wish I knew what to do . I am out of heart about every thing ! '
39456	39490	39491	39491	Ethel	300	' Only try to mind and heed , and you will learn . It will be a step if you will only put your shoes side by side when you take them off . '
39500	39533	39497	39497	Margaret	249	' Do n't grieve about me , but put your clever head to rule your hands , and you will do for home and Cocksmoor too . Good - night , dearest . '
39534	39540	39542	39542	Ethel	300	' I 've vexed papa , '

39694	39765	39656	39657	her papa	7854	' Yes , you must , Ethel . I believe I was hasty with you , my poor girl . I was vexed , and we have no one to smooth us down . I am sorry , my dear , but you must bear with me , for I never learnt her ways with you when I might . We will try to have more patience with each other . '
40024	40050	39996	39996	he	227	' I am sorry ; this is the first time you ever have not managed so as to make a real holiday of your Saturday ! '
40051	40065	40067	40067	Norman	227	' I could not help it , and there 's nothing to do , '
40071	40087	40089	40089	Ethel	300	' I promised to go and read to Margaret , while Flora does her music , '
40091	40106	40089	40089	Ethel	300	' I shall come after that and do my Latin and Greek with you . '

40180	40200	40170	40170	Harry	257	' You 'll jump out of your skin some of these days , if you do n't take care ! '
40201	40218	40220	40220	Ethel	300	' It 's enough to startle any one to be waked up with such a noise , '
40222	40232	40234	40234	Harry	257	' Then he ought to sleep at proper times , '
40236	40260	40234	40234	Harry	257	' and not be waking me up with tumbling about , and hallooing out , and talking in his sleep half the night . '
40261	40279	40281	40281	Ethel	300	' Talking in his sleep ; why , just now , you said he did not sleep , '
40283	40290	40292	40292	Norman	227	' Harry knows nothing about it , '
40294	40332	40292	40292	Norman	227	' Do n't I ? well , I only know , if you slept in school , and were a junior , you would get a proper good licking for going on as you do at night . '
40333	40352	40354	40354	Norman	227	' And I think you might chance to get a proper good licking for not holding your tongue , '
40425	40432	40434	40434	Mary	220	' Where can he be going ? '
40443	40447	40449	40449	Tom	238	' I know , '
40451	40458	40449	40449	Tom	238	' Where ? Do tell me . '
40459	40509	40420	40420	he	257	' Only do n't tell papa . I went down with him to the play - ground this morning , and there they settled it . The Andersons , and Axworthy , and he , are going to hire a gun , and shoot pee - wits on Cocksmoor . '
40510	40519	40521	40521	Mary	220	' But they ought not ; should they ? '
40523	40530	40521	40521	Mary	220	' Papa would be very angry . '
40531	40567	40420	40420	he	257	' Anderson said there was no harm in it , but Harry told me not to tell . Indeed , Anderson would have boxed my ears for hearing , when I could not help it . '
40568	40576	40420	40420	he	257	' But Harry would not let him ? '
40577	40606	40521	40521	Mary	220	' Aye . Harry is quite a match for Harvey Anderson , though he is so much younger ; and he said he would not have me bullied . '
40607	40624	40626	40626	Mary	220	' That 's a good Harry ! But I wish he would not go out shooting ! '
40628	40636	40626	40626	Mary	220	' Mind , you do n't tell . '
40637	40649	40521	40521	Mary	220	' And where 's Hector Ernescliffe ? Would not he go ? '
40650	40718	40521	40521	Mary	220	' No . I like Hector . He did not choose to go , though Anderson teazed him , and said he was a poor Scot , and his brother did n't allow him tin enough to buy powder and shot . If Harry would have stayed at home , he would have come up here , and we might have had some fun in the garden . '
40719	40732	40734	40734	Mary	220	' I wish he would . We never have any fun now , '
40736	40744	40734	40734	Mary	220	' but oh ! there he is ; '
40857	40861	40845	40845	Margaret	249	' not very , '
40916	40952	40914	40915	the boys	7404	' pockets , that they might not crack in the nursery fire . Margaret only stipulated that her sisters should be well fenced in brown holland , and when Miss Winter looked grave , said , '
40969	41083	41095	41095	he	1469	' Miss Winter could not see the good of groping in the dirt ; and Margaret perceived that it would be one of her difficulties to know how to follow out her mother 's views for the children , without vexing the good governess by not deferring to her . In the meantime , Norman had disconsolately returned to his Euripides , and Ethel , who wanted to stay with him and look out his words , was ordered out by Miss Winter , because she had spent all yesterday in - doors . Miss Winter was going to stay with Margaret , and Ethel and Flora coaxed Norman to come with them , '
41105	41160	41095	41095	he	1469	' He came , but he did not enliven his sisters . The three plodded on , taking a diligent constitutional walk , exchanging very few words , and those chiefly between the girls . Flora gathered some hoary clematis , and red berries , and sought in the hedge - sides for some crimson '
41163	41227	41230	41239	no one who does see what is the right thing	1470	' to carry home ; and , at the sight of the amusement Margaret derived from the placing the beauteous little Pezizas in a saucer of damp green moss , so as to hide the brown sticks on which they grew , Ethel took shame to herself for want of perception of little attentions . When she told Norman so , he answered , '
41253	41293	41307	41307	you	1472	' added he , looking round at the ornaments and things on the tables , which had lost their air of comfort and good taste . It was not disorder , and Ethel could not see what he meant . '
41298	41302	41307	41307	you	1472	' said she . '
41335	41336	41337	41337	I	0	' '

41354	41367	41339	41339	you	1472	' again said Norman , but he put his arm round her . '

41542	41605	41520	41520	I	0	' He rested listlessly on the sofa while his sister rummaged in a chiffoniere . At last she found the article , and eagerly read him the description of the strange forms of the coral animals , and the beauties of their flower - like feelers and branching fabrics . It would once have delighted him , but his first comment was , '
41610	41676	41606	41608	Nasty little brutes	1476	' However , the next minute he thanked her , took the book , and said he could hammer something out of it , though it was too bad to give such an unclassical subject . At dusk he left off , saying he should get it done at night , his senses would come then , and he should be glad to sit up . '
41684	41801	41606	41608	Nasty little brutes	1476	' said Ethel , trying to be cheerful ; but his assent was depressing , and she began to fear that Christmas would only make them more sad . Mary did not keep Tom 's secret so inviolably , but that , while they were dressing for tea , she revealed to Ethel where Harry was gone . He was not yet returned , though his father and Richard were come in , and the sisters were at once in some anxiety on his account , and doubt whether they ought to let papa know of his disobedience . Flora and Ethel , who were the first in the drawing - room , had a consultation . '
41809	41813	41814	41814	He	1478	' said Flora . '
41819	41823	41814	41814	He	1478	' sighed Ethel , '

42066	42092	42057	42057	you	0	' said Richard , entering . The sisters looked at each other , and Ethel , after an interval , explained their doubts about Harry . '

42121	42144	42093	42093	He	257	'm glad ! But do you think papa ought to hear it ? I do n't know what 's to be done . '
42151	42155	42146	42147	the children	1044	' said Flora . '
42170	42180	42093	42093	He	257	' said Ethel—'Harvey Anderson close by all the holidays ! '
42181	42192	42194	42194	Richard	298	' I 'll try what I can do with him , '
42196	42239	42194	42194	Richard	298	' Papa had better not hear it now , at any rate . He is very tired and sad this evening ! and his arm is painful again , so we must not worry him with histories of naughtiness among the children . '
42240	42243	42245	42245	Ethel	300	' No , '
42249	42272	42245	42245	Ethel	300	' I am glad you were there , Ritchie ; I never should have thought of one time being better than another . '
42273	42278	42280	42280	Flora	280	' Just like Ethel ! '
42284	42291	42293	42293	Richard	298	' Why should not you learn ? '
42296	42301	42303	42303	Ethel	300	' I ca n't , '
42310	42348	42303	42303	Ethel	300	' Why not ? You are much sharper than most people , and , if you tried , you would know those things as much better than I do , as you know how to learn history . '
42349	42359	42361	42361	Flora	280	' It is quite a different sort of cleverness , '
42363	42372	42361	42361	Flora	280	' Recollect Sir Isaac Newton , or Archimedes . '
42373	42381	42383	42383	Ethel	300	' Then you must have both sorts , '
42385	42400	42383	42383	Ethel	300	' for you can do things nicely , and yet you learn very fast . '
42401	42426	42428	42428	Flora	280	' Take care , Ethel , you are singeing your frock ! Well , I really do n't think you can help those things ! '
42430	42452	42428	42428	Flora	280	' Your short sight is the reason of it , and it is of no use to try to mend it . '
42453	42460	42462	42462	Richard	298	' Do n't tell her so , '
42464	42565	42462	42462	Richard	298	' It ca n't be all short sight — it is the not thinking . I do believe that if Ethel would think , no one would do things so well . Do n't you remember the beautiful perspective drawing she made of this room , for me to take to Oxford ? That was very difficult , and wanted a great deal of neatness and accuracy , so why should she not be neat and accurate in other things ? And I know you can read faces , Ethel — why do n't you look there before you speak ? '
42566	42591	42592	42592	I	0	' Ah ! before instead of after , when I only see I have said something mal - à - propos , said Ethel . '
42601	42605	42462	42462	Richard	298	' said Flora ; '
42622	42623	42624	42624	Flora	280	' '
42629	42633	42624	42624	Flora	280	' said Ethel . '
42637	42641	42624	42624	Flora	280	' said Richard . '

42851	42895	42845	42845	Flora	280	' Richard would not let her off . He stood over her , counted her shovelsfull of tea , and watched the water into the tea - pot — he superintended her warming the cups , and putting a drop into each saucer . '
42898	42907	42845	42845	Flora	280	' said Ethel , with a concluding sigh , '
42916	43142	43143	43143	I	0	' It was all right , as Flora allowed with a slightly superior smile . She thought Richard would never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman of Ethel , and it was best that the two sisters should take different lines . Flora knew that , though clever and with more accomplishments , she could not surpass Ethel in intellectual attainments , but she was certainly far more valuable in the house , and had been proved to have just the qualities in which her sister was most deficient . She did not relish hearing that Ethel wanted nothing but attention to be more than her equal , and she thought Richard mistaken . Flora 's remembrance of their time of distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the others , for she knew she had done wonders . The next day Norman told Ethel that he had got on very well with the verses , and finished them off late at night . He showed them to her before taking them to school on Monday morning , and Ethel thought they were the best he had ever written . There was too much spirit and poetical beauty , for a mere school - boy task , and she begged for the foul copy , to show it to her father . '
43149	43153	43143	43143	I	0	' said Norman . '

43225	43231	43233	43233	Ethel	300	' As it says here , '
43235	43336	43337	43337	Ethel	300	' And the words all came to me of themselves in beautiful flowing Latin , just right , as if it was any body but myself doing it , and they ran off my pen in red and blue and gold , and all sorts of colours ; and fine branching zig - zagging stars , like what the book described , only stranger , came dancing and radiating round my pen and the candle . I could hardly believe the verses would scan by daylight , but I ca n't find a mistake . Do you try them again . '
43340	43346	43347	43347	she	300	' I see nothing wrong , '
43350	43383	43347	43347	she	300	' but it seems a shame to begin scanning Undine 's verses , they are too pretty . I wish I could copy them . It must have been half a dream . '
43384	43398	43469	43469	he	1499	' I believe it was ; they do n't seem like my own . '
43399	43405	43406	43406	He	1499	' Did you dream afterwards ? '
43409	43457	43406	43406	He	1499	' They had got into my head too much ; my ears sang like the roaring of the sea , and I thought my feet were frozen on to an iceberg : then came darkness , and sea monsters , and drowning — it was too horrid ! '
43472	43474	43469	43469	he	1499	' But '
43485	43499	43500	43500	You	300	' said he , with a long yawn , and rubbing his eyes . '
43514	43559	43509	43509	Harry	257	' Ethel thought those verses ought to make a sensation , but all that came of them was a Quam optimè , and when she asked Norman if no special notice had been taken of them , he said , in his languid way , '
43572	43596	43563	43564	Dr. Hoxton	269	' Ethel did not even have the satisfaction of hearing that Mr. Wilmot , happening to meet Dr. May , said to him , '
43623	43681	43615	43615	He	1501	' Richard watched for an opportunity of speaking to Harry , which did not at once occur , as the boy spent very little of his time at home , and , as if by tacit consent , he and Norman came in later every evening . At last , on Thursday , in the additional two hours '
43723	43733	43735	43735	Richard	298	' I 'll walk back to school with you , '
43737	43743	43735	43735	Richard	298	' I mean to run , '
43747	43754	43756	43756	Richard	298	' Is there so much hurry ? '
43758	43782	43756	43756	Richard	298	' I am sorry for it , for I wanted to speak to you , Harry ; I have something to show you . '
43800	43804	43806	43806	he	1501	' Very well , '
43812	43820	43806	43806	he	1501	' I 'll come into your room . '
43849	43900	43901	43901	Richard	298	' It is a bit of a letter that she was in course of writing to aunt Flora , a description of us all . The letter itself is gone , but here is a copy of it . I thought you would like to read what relates to yourself . '
43965	43979	43940	43942	the old woman	1508	' Well ! be it you , Sir , and the young lady ? '
43980	43992	43994	43994	Richard	298	' Yes ; here we are come to see you again , '
44015	44016	44003	44003	I	0	' '
44033	44045	44046	44046	He	890	' said the old woman , to Ethel 's great amusement . '
44072	44080	44063	44065	the young lady	8272	' tis a dirty walk for her . '
44081	44086	44088	44088	Ethel	300	' Never mind that , '
44094	44103	44088	44088	Ethel	300	' I came — where are your grandchildren ? '
44104	44128	44063	44065	the young lady	8272	' O somewhere out among the blocks . They gets out with the other children ; I ca n't be always after them . '
44129	44140	44142	44142	Ethel	300	' I wanted to know if these would fit them , '
44150	44153	44142	44142	Ethel	300	' Well , '
44165	44172	44173	44173	Polly	238	' stepping out to the door , '
44213	44610	44611	44611	I	0	' all which threats were bawled out in such a good - natured , natured , triumphant voice , and with such a delighted air , that Richard and Ethel could not help laughing . After a few moments , Polly and Jenny made their appearance , extremely rough and ragged , but compelled by their grandmother to duck down , by way of courtesies , and , with finger in mouth , they stood , too shy to show their delight , as the garments were unfolded ; Granny talking so fast that Ethel would never have brought in the stipulation , that the frocks should be worn to school and Church , if Richard , in his mild , but steady way , had not brought the old woman to listen to it . She was full of asseverations that they should go ; she took them to Church sometimes herself , when it was fine weather and they had clothes , and they could say their catechiz as well anybody already ; yes , they should come , that they should , and next Sunday . Ethel promised to be there to introduce them to the chief lady , the president of the Committee , Mrs. Ledwich , and , with a profusion of thanks , they took leave . They found John Taylor , just come out of the hospital , looking weak and ill , as he smoked his pipe over the fire , his wife bustling about at a great rate , and one of the infants crying . It seemed to be a great relief that they were not come to complain of Lucy , and there were many looks of surprise on hearing what their business really was . Mrs. Taylor thanked , and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry ; and her husband , pipe in hand , gazed at the young gentleman as if he did not comprehend the species , since he could not be old enough to be a Clergyman . Richard hoped they would find sponsors by that time ; and there Mrs. Taylor gave little hope ; it was a bad lot — there was no one she liked to ask to stand , she said , in a dismal voice ; but there her husband put in , '
44632	44633	44626	44626	nobody	7727	' '
44638	44645	44626	44626	nobody	7727	' said the lamentable Mrs. Taylor , '
44657	44695	44626	44626	nobody	7727	'm loth the little ones should n't ; but you see , Sir , we are poor people , and it 's a long way , and they was set down in the gentleman 's register book . '
44696	44723	44756	44756	Missus	1521	' But you know that is not the same , Mrs. Taylor . Surely Lucy could have told you that , when she went to school . '
44724	44729	44626	44626	nobody	7727	' No , sir , '
44749	44750	44756	44756	Missus	1521	' '
44758	44763	44756	44756	Missus	1521	' exclaimed her husband . '

44844	44854	44856	44856	Richard	298	' I believe you will be glad of it , '
45096	45107	45109	45109	Ethel—'there	337	' And his wife is such a horrible whining dawdle ! '
45123	45154	45109	45109	Ethel—'there	337	' Richard made no answer , and Ethel presently felt remorseful for her harsh speech about a poor ignorant woman , overwhelmed with poverty , children , and weak health . '
45173	45182	45185	45185	you	298	' said Richard , after a considerable interval . '
45187	45209	45185	45185	you	298	' cried Ethel , eagerly ; and the black peaty pond she was looking at , seemed to sparkle with sunlight . '
45216	45222	45211	45211	you	300	' said Richard , deliberately . '
45229	45237	45211	45211	you	300	' she said , with some indignation . '

46528	46638	46525	46525	she	249	' I wish he was better . I think he is more oppressed now than even at first . The pain of his arm , going on so long , seems to me to have pulled him down ; it does not let him sleep , and , by the end of the day , he gets worn and fagged , by seeing so many people , and exerting himself to talk and think ; and often , when there is something that must be asked , I do n't know how to begin , for it seems as if a little more would be too much for him .

46639	46646	46648	46648	Ethel	300	' Yes , Richard is right , '
46652	46674	46648	46648	Ethel	300	' it will not do to press him about our concerns ; but do you think him worse to - day ? '
46675	46744	46525	46525	she	249	' He did not sleep last night , and he is always worse when he does not drive out into the country ; the fresh air , and being alone with Richard , are a rest for him . To - day is especially trying ; he does not think poor old Mr. Southern will get through the evening , and he is so sorry for the daughter . '
46745	46751	46525	46525	she	249	' Is he there now ? '
46752	46797	46525	46525	she	249	' Yes ; he thought of something that might be an alleviation , and he would go , though he was tired . I am afraid the poor daughter will detain him , and he is not fit to go through such things now . '
46798	46831	46525	46525	she	249	' No , I hope he will soon come ; perhaps Richard will meet him . But , O Margaret , what do you think Richard and I have been talking of ? '
46861	46870	46850	46850	Margaret	249	' Hark ! was not that his step ? '
46882	46885	46887	46887	he	238	' Well , '
46889	46916	46887	46887	he	238	' I was just too late . He died as I got there , and I could not leave the daughter till old Mrs. Bowers came . '
46917	46921	46923	46923	Margaret	249	' Poor thing , '
46925	46933	46923	46923	Margaret	249	' He was a good old man . '
46934	46937	46939	46940	Dr. May	238	' Yes , '
46955	46987	46939	46940	Dr. May	238	' One ca n't lightly part with a man one has seen at Church every Sunday of one 's life , and exchanged so many friendly words with over his counter . '
47025	47070	47071	47071	Papa	218	' as Ethel fetched his slippers , and placed a stool for his feet , feeling somewhat ashamed of thinking it an achievement to have , unbidden , performed a small act of attention which would have come naturally from any of the others . '
47085	47109	47073	47073	you	218	' said Margaret , who saw the quiet of her room would suit him better than the bustle of the children down stairs . '
47113	47168	47111	47111	you	249	' as he gave a smile of assent . That Margaret could not be made to listen this evening was plain , and all that Ethel could do , was to search for some books on schools . In seeking for them , she displayed such confusion in the chiffoniere , that Flora exclaimed , '
47180	47181	47171	47171	Ethel	300	' '
47201	47226	47194	47194	I	0	' said Ethel , gulping down her dislike to being reproved by Flora , with the thought that mamma would have said the same . '
47230	47238	47241	47241	you	7382	' cried Flora presently , jumping up , '
47271	47272	47277	47277	Flora	280	' '
47279	47310	47277	47277	Flora	280	' and Richard , in a low voice , gave Ethel some advice , which she received , seated on the floor , in a mood between temper and despair . '
47326	47378	47311	47311	He	1575	' said Flora . Richard did not do it himself , but , by his means Ethel , without being in the least irritated , gave the chiffoniere a thorough dusting and setting - to - rights , sorting magazines , burning old catalogues , and finding her own long - lost '
47381	47535	47536	47536	I	0	' at which she was so delighted , that she would have forgotten all ; in proceeding to read it , curled up on the floor amongst the heaps of pamphlets , if another gentle hint from Richard had not made her finish her task so well , as to make Flora declare it was a pleasure to look in , and Harry pronounce it to be all neat and ship - shape . There was no speaking to Margaret the next morning — it was French day — and Ethel had made strong resolutions to behave better ; and whether there were fewer idioms , or that she was trying to understand , instead of carping at the master 's explanations , they came to no battle ; Flora led the conversation , and she sustained her part with credit , and gained an excellent mark . Flora said afterwards to Margaret , '
47583	47584	47586	47586	she	300	' '
47589	47593	47586	47586	she	300	' said Margaret . '
47625	47754	47613	47613	she	300	' It was the second time Margaret had made this proposal , and it did not please Flora , who had learnt to think herself necessary to her sister , and liked to be the one to do everything for her . She was within six weeks of seventeen , and surely she need not be sent down again to the school - room , when she had been so good a manager of the whole family . She was fond of study and of accomplishments , but she thought she might be emancipated from Miss Winter ; and it was not pleasant to her that a sister , only eighteen months older , and almost dependant on her , should have authority to dispose of her time . '
47761	47765	47613	47613	she	300	' she said , '
47784	47800	47801	47801	You	1577	' Margaret was concerned at the dissatisfaction , though not understanding the whole of it ; '
47807	47811	47801	47801	You	1577	' she said , '
47812	47823	47801	47801	You	1577	' I need not take up all your time now . '
47824	47830	47832	47832	Flora	280	' Do n't regret that , '
47834	47857	47832	47832	Flora	280	' I like nothing so well as waiting on you , and I can attend to my own affairs very well here . '
47858	47868	47870	47870	Margaret	249	' I 'll tell you why I proposed it , '
47872	47892	47870	47870	Margaret	249	' I think it would be a relief to Ethel to escape from Miss Winter 's beloved Friday questions . '
47893	47899	47901	47901	Flora	280	' Great nonsense they are , '
47903	47917	47901	47901	Flora	280	' Why do n't you tell Miss Winter they are of no use ? '
47918	47925	47927	47927	Margaret	249	' Mamma never interfered with them , '
47929	47970	47927	47927	Margaret	249	' She only kept Ethel in her own hands , and if you would be so kind as to change sometimes and sit in the school - room , we could spare Ethel , without hurting Miss Winter 's feelings . '
47971	48011	48012	48012	Flora	280	' Well , I 'll call Ethel , if you like , but I shall go and practise in the drawing - room . The old school - room piano is fit for nothing but Mary to hammer upon . '
48061	48198	48034	48034	Ethel	300	' O , Margaret , I am so glad to come to you . Miss Winter has set Mary to read " To be , or not to be , " and it would have driven me distracted to have stayed there . I have got a most beautiful sum in Compound Proportion , about a lion , a wolf , and a bear eating up a carcase , and as soon as they have done it , you shall hear me say my ancient geography , and then we will do a nice bit of Tasso ; and if we have any time after that , I have got such a thing to tell you — only I must not tell you now , or I shall go on talking and not finish my lessons . '
48214	48231	48208	48208	Ethel	300	' Now for what I have been longing to tell you — Richard is going to — '
48315	48327	48329	48329	she	249	' I should have been very glad of you last evening , '
48331	48346	48329	48329	she	249	' for papa went to sleep , and my book was out of reach . '
48347	48362	48329	48329	she	249	' O , I am sorry ; how I pity you , poor Margaret ! '
48363	48371	48373	48373	Margaret	249	' I suppose I have grown lazy , '
48375	48398	48373	48373	Margaret	249	' for I do n't mind those things now . I am never sorry for a quiet time to recollect and consider . '
48399	48417	48419	48419	Ethel	300	' It must be like the waiting in the dark between the slides of a magic lantern , '
48421	48434	48419	48419	Ethel	300	' I never like to be quiet . I get so unhappy . '
48435	48444	48446	48446	Margaret	249	' I am glad of resting and recollecting , '
48448	48520	48446	48446	Margaret	249	' It has all been so like a dream , that merry morning , and then , slowly waking to find myself here in dear mamma 's place , and papa , watching over me . Sometimes I think I have not half understood what it really is , and that I do n't realize , that if I was up and about , I should find the house without her . '
48521	48530	48532	48532	Ethel	300	' Yes ; that is the aching part ! '
48534	48575	48532	48532	Ethel	300	' I am happy , sitting on her bed here with you . You are a little of her , besides being my own dear Peg - top ! You are very lucky to miss the mealtimes and the evenings . '
48576	48599	48601	48601	Margaret	249	' That is the reason I do n't feel it wrong to like to have papa sitting with me all the evening , '
48603	48656	48601	48601	Margaret	249	' though it may make it worse for you to have him away . I do n't think it selfish in me to keep him . He wants quiet so much , or to talk a little when it suits him ; we are too many now , when he is tired . '
48657	48664	48666	48666	Ethel	300	' O , it is best , '
48668	48682	48666	48666	Ethel	300	' Nothing that you do is selfish — do nt talk of it , '
48686	48700	48684	48684	Margaret	249	' It will be something like old times when you come down again . '
48701	48719	48721	48721	Margaret	249	' But all this time you are not telling me what I want so much to hear , '
48723	48737	48721	48721	Margaret	249	' about Cocksmoor . I am so glad Richard has taken it up . '
48738	48804	48684	48684	Margaret	249	' That he has . We are to go every Friday , and hire a room , and teach the children . Once a week will do a great deal , if we can but make them wish to learn . It is a much better plan than mine ; for if they care about it , they can come to school here on Sunday . '
48805	48810	48812	48812	Margaret	249	' It is excellent , '
48814	48862	48812	48812	Margaret	249	' and if he is at home till Easter , it will give it a start , and put you in the way of it , and get you through the short days and dark evenings , when you could not so well walk home without him . '
48863	48933	48684	48684	Margaret	249	' Yes , and then we can all teach ; Flora , and Mary , and you , when you are well again . Richard says it will be disagreeable , but I do n't think so — they are such unsophisticated people . That Granny Hall is such a funny old woman ; and the whole place wants nothing but a little care , to do very well . '
48934	48944	48684	48684	Margaret	249	' You must prepare for disappointments , dear Ethel . '
48945	48969	48812	48812	Margaret	249	' I know ; I know nothing is done without draw - backs ; but I am so glad to make some beginning . '
48970	49040	48684	48684	Margaret	249	' So am I. Do you know , mamma and I were one day talking over those kind of things , and she said she had always regretted that she had so many duties at home , that she could not attend as much to the poor as she would like ; but she hoped now we girls were growing up , we should be able to do more . '
49044	49056	49042	49042	she	1579	' was all Ethel said , but she was deeply gratified . '
49084	49085	49086	49086	I	0	' '
49093	49097	49086	49086	I	0	' said Ethel , '

49148	49152	49132	49132	he	298	' said Margaret . '
49222	49223	49224	49224	He	298	' '
49236	49240	49224	49224	He	298	' said Margaret . '

49538	49542	49515	49515	I	0	' said Ethel . '
49635	49727	49634	49634	I	0	'm not ready to bite off my own fingers , or kick all the rattle - traps over and leave them , as I am , when Miss Winter scolds me , or nurse , or even Flora sometimes ; but it is as if I was gratifying him , and his funny little old bachelor tidyisms divert me ; besides , he teaches me the theory , and never lays hold of my poor fingers , and , when they wo n't bend the wrong way , calls them frogs . '
49728	49737	49739	49739	Margaret	249	' He is a capital master for you , '
49774	49800	49802	49802	Ethel	300	' If he would only read our books , and enter into poetry and delight in it ; but it is all nonsense to him , '
49804	49836	49802	49802	Ethel	300	' I ca n't think how people can be so different ; but oh ! here he comes . Ritchie , you should not come upon us before we are aware . '
49837	49849	49856	49856	Margaret—'she	343	' What ? I should have heard no good of myself ? '
49850	49854	49856	49856	Margaret—'she	343	' Great good , '
49873	49874	49856	49856	Margaret—'she	343	' '
49890	49896	49875	49875	I	0	' said Richard , gravely . '
49905	49943	49898	49898	she	1595	' And it was again happily discussed ; Ethel , satisfied by finding him fully set upon the design , and Margaret , giving cordial sympathy and counsel . When Ethel was called away , Margaret said , '
49980	49981	49982	49982	I	0	' '
49993	49997	49985	49985	she	300	' said Richard . '

50052	50058	50027	50027	her	300	' said Richard , smiling . '

50117	50123	50106	50106	You	298	' said Margaret , affectionately . '

50189	50190	50193	50193	you	298	' '

50412	50448	50449	50449	Margaret	249	' The scene that ensued that evening in the Magic Lantern before Margaret 's bed , did not promise much for the freedom of her father 's mind . Harry entered with a resolute manner . '
50458	50476	50451	50451	I	0	' said he , spreading himself out , with an elbow on each arm of the chair . '

50564	50610	50561	50561	you	0	' answered Margaret , reflectingly , and sadly surveying the bright boy , rosy cheeked , round faced , and blue eyed , with the childish gladsomeness of countenance , that made it strange that his lot in life should be already in the balance . '
50648	50654	50640	50640	I	0	' said he , earnestly . '

50991	50999	50988	50988	You	249	' said Harry , twisting a little , '
51042	51043	51037	51037	Norman	227	' '
51083	51084	51071	51071	I	0	' '
51091	51095	51071	51071	I	0	' said Harry . '
51096	51143	51071	51071	I	0	' I ca n't stand things at all , and I ca n't go moping about as Norman does . I ca n't live without fun , and now Norman is n't there , half the time it turns to something I am sorry for afterwards . '
51144	51170	51071	51071	I	0	' But , Harry , if you let yourself be drawn into mischief here for want of Norman , what would you do at sea ? '
51171	51178	51071	51071	I	0	' I should be an officer ! '
51179	51184	51186	51186	Margaret	249	' I am afraid , '
51190	51224	51186	51186	Margaret	249	' that would not make much difference inside , though it might outside . You must get the self - control , and leave off being afraid to be said to be afraid . '
51228	51244	51245	51245	he	257	' I should start fresh , and be out of the way of the Andersons , '
51248	51314	51245	51245	he	257	' That Anderson junior , is a horrid fellow — he spites Norman , and he bullied me , till I was big enough to show him that it would not do — and though I am so much younger , he is afraid of me . He makes up to me , and tries to get me into all the mischief that is going . '
51315	51331	51370	51370	she	249	' And you know that , and let him lead you ? Oh , Harry ! '
51332	51341	51343	51343	Harry	257	' I do n't let him lead me , '
51347	51361	51343	51343	Harry	257	' but I wo n't have them say I ca n't do things . '
51383	51399	51378	51378	he	257	' There never was a May in disgrace yet , and there never shall be . '
51400	51411	51413	51413	Margaret	249	' That is a thing to be very thankful for , '
51415	51441	51413	51413	Margaret	249	' but you know there may be much harm without public disgrace . I never heard of one of the Andersons being in disgrace yet . '
51442	51463	51465	51465	Harry	257	' No — shabby fellows , that just manage to keep fair with old Hoxton , and make a show , '
51467	51532	51465	51465	Harry	257	' They look at translations , and copy old stock verses . O , it was such fun the other day . What do you think ? Norman must have been dreaming , for he had taken to school , by mistake , Richard 's old Gradus that Ethel uses , and there were ever so many rough copies of hers sticking in it . '
51533	51552	51378	51378	he	257	' Poor Ethel ! What consternation she would be in ! I hope no one found it out . '
51553	51704	51706	51706	Harry	257	' Why , Anderson junior , was gaping about in despair for sense for his verses — he comes on that , and slyly copies a whole set of her old ones , done when she — Norman , I mean — was in the fifth form . His subject was a river , and hers Babylon ; but , altering a line or two , it did just as well . He never guessed I saw him , and thought he had done it famously . He showed them up , and would have got some noted good mark , but that , by great good luck , Ethel had made two of her pentameters too short , which he had n't the wit to find out , thinking all Norman did must be right . So he has shown up a girl 's verses — isn't that rare ? '
51715	51725	51706	51706	Harry	257	' I hope no one knows they were hers ? '
51726	51732	51734	51734	Harry	257	' Bless you , no ! '
51745	51793	51734	51734	Harry	257	' D'ye think I could tell ? No , that 's the only pity , that he ca n't hear it ; but , after all , I do n't care for anything he does , now I know he has shown up a girl 's verses . '
51794	51806	51706	51706	Harry	257	' Are these verses of poor Ethel 's safe at home ? '
51807	51831	51706	51706	Harry	257	' Yes , I took care of that . Mind you do n't tell anyone , Margaret ; I never told even Norman . '
51832	51848	51734	51734	Harry	257	' But all your school - fellows arn't like these ? You have Hector Ernescliffe . '
51849	51868	51706	51706	Harry	257	' He 's a nice fellow enough , but he is little , and down in the school . '
51905	51918	51888	51888	they	1643	' said Harry , lowering his voice into an anxious confidential tone ; '
51952	51996	51951	51951	I	0	'm thrown on them , and I want to get out of it . I did n't know that was it before , but Richard showed me what set me on thinking of it , and I see she knew all about it . '
51997	52064	51951	51951	I	0	' That she did ! There is a great deal in what you say , Harry , but you know she thought nothing would be of real use but changing within . If you do n't get a root of strength in yourself , your ship will be no better to you than school — there will be idle midshipmen as well as idle school boys . '
52065	52071	52073	52073	Harry	257	' Yes , I know , '
52075	52090	51951	51951	I	0	' but do you think papa will consent ? She would not have minded . '
52091	52126	52127	52127	Harry	257	' I ca n't tell . I should think he would ; but if any scheme is to come to good , it must begin by your telling him of the going out shooting . '
52130	52143	52144	52144	he	257	' I 'd have done it long ago if she was here , '
52147	52182	52144	52144	he	257	' I never did anything so bad before without telling , and I do n't like it at all . It seems to come between him and me when I wish him good night . '
52183	52203	52127	52127	Harry	257	' Then , Harry , pray do tell him . You 'll have no comfort if you do n't . '
52204	52227	52144	52144	he	257	' I know I sha n't ; but then he 'll be so angry ! And , do you know , Margaret , '
52331	52332	52333	52333	I	0	' '
52347	52348	52352	52352	he	1649	' '
52436	52437	52430	52430	I	0	' '
52468	52500	52460	52460	he	1649	' Harry looked very reluctant and disconsolate , and his sister did not wonder — for Dr. May 's way of hearing of a fault was never to be calculated on . '
52505	52509	52503	52503	Harry	257	' said she , '
52568	52569	52570	52570	I	0	' '
52573	52651	52570	52570	I	0	' said Harry , and the words were hardly spoken , before his father 's hand was on the door . He was taken by surprise at the moment of trial coming so speedily , and had half a mind to retreat by the other door ; he was stayed by the reflection that Margaret would think him a coward , unfit for a sailor , and he made up his mind to endure whatever might betide . '
52663	52664	52665	52665	Harry	257	' '
52675	52676	52665	52665	Harry	257	' '
52686	52692	52693	52693	Papa	218	' said he , kindly . '
52719	52733	52734	52734	We	1659	' said Harry , speaking firmly and boldly now he had once begun . '
52755	52792	52794	52794	he	7976	' Then came a pause . Harry stopped , and Dr. May waited , half expecting to hear that the boy was only brought to confession , by finding himself in a scrape . Margaret spoke . '
52805	52806	52800	52800	he	7976	' '
52816	52854	52857	52857	papa	7391	' said the Doctor , looking at his son with a keen glance , between affection and inquiry , as if only waiting to be sure the confession was free , before he gave his free forgiveness . '
52859	52885	52857	52857	papa	7391	' said Harry , his voice and lip losing their firmness , as the sweetness of expression gained the day on his father 's face . '
52908	52945	52903	52903	I	0	' The latter words came between sighs , fast becoming sobs , in spite of Harry 's attempts to control them , as his father held out his arm , and drew him close to him . '
52954	53001	52903	52903	I	0	' he said in his ear — in a voice which strong feeling had reduced to such a whisper , that even Margaret could not hear — she only saw how Harry , sobbing aloud , clung tighter and tighter to him , till he said , '
53008	53030	52903	52903	I	0	' and Harry sprung back at least a yard , with such a look of dismay , that the Doctor laughed . '
53035	53039	52903	52903	I	0	' said he . '
53058	53065	53056	53056	Harry	257	' and he took his hand . '

53151	53152	53146	53146	papa	7391	' '
53172	53180	53155	53155	I	0	' said Dr. May , half smiling . '
53186	53523	53184	53184	papa	7391	' said Harry , infinitely relieved and grateful , and quite content for some space to lean in silence against the chair , with that encircling arm round him , while some talk passed between his father and Margaret . What a world of thought passed through the boy 's young soul in that space ! First , there was a thrill of intense , burning love to his father , scarcely less fondness to his sweet motherly sister ; a clinging feeling to every chair and table of that room , which seemed still full of his mother 's presence ; a numbering over of all the others with ardent attachment , and a flinging from him with horror the notion of asking to be far away from that dearest father , that loving home , that arm that was round him . Anything rather than be without them in the dreary world ! But then came the remembrance of cherished visions , the shame of relinquishing a settled purpose , the thought of weary morrows , with the tempters among his playmates , and his home blank and melancholy ; and the roaming spirit of enterprise stirred again , and reproached him with being a baby , for fancying he could stay at home for ever . He would come back again with such honours as Alan Ernescliffe had brought , and oh ! if his father so prized them in a stranger , what would it be in his own son ? Come home to such a greeting as would make up for the parting ! Harry 's heart throbbed again for the boundless sea , the tall ship , and the wondrous foreign climes , where he had so often lived in fancy . Should he , could he speak ; was this the moment ? and he stood gazing at the fire , oppressed with the weighty reality of deciding his destiny . At last Dr. May looked in his face , '
53544	53549	53550	53550	Papa	218	' Out it came , '
53560	53561	53553	53553	you	218	' '
53564	53569	53553	53553	you	218	' said Dr. May , '
53588	53589	53579	53579	I	0	' '
53594	53711	53592	53592	Papa	218	' said Harry , with the manly coolness that the sense of his determination gave him—'it was not a mere fancy , and I have never had it out of my head . I mean it quite in earnest — I had rather be a sailor . I do n't wish to get away from Latin and Greek , I do n't mind them ; but I think I could be a better sailor than anything . I know it is not all play , but I am willing to rough it ; and I am getting so old , it is time to see about it , so will you consent to it , papa ? '
53712	53726	53728	53729	Dr. May.	346	' Well ! there 's some sense in your way of putting it , '
53730	53743	53592	53592	Papa	218	' You have it strong in your head then , and you know '
53751	53752	53754	53754	I	0	' '
53808	53809	53813	53814	my man	1672	' '
53818	53837	53813	53814	my man	1672	' tis easier talking by one 's own fire - side , than doing when the trial comes . '
53838	53847	53876	53877	his father	7526	' And will you let me , papa ? '
53848	53874	53876	53877	his father	7526	' I 'll think about it . I ca n't make up my mind as " quick as directly , " you know , Harry , '
53882	53911	53876	53877	his father	7526	' but I wo nt treat it as a boy 's fancy , for you 've spoken in a manly way , and deserve to be attended to . '
53912	53939	53940	53940	Harry	257	' Now run down , and tell the girls to put away their work , for I shall come down in a minute to read prayers . '
53950	54005	53940	53940	Harry	257	' That 's a fine fellow ! So this is what comes of bringing sick sailors home — one 's own boys must be catching the infection . Little monkey , he talks as wisely as if he were forty ! He is really set on it , do you think , Margaret ? I 'm

54015	54019	54011	54011	I	0	' said Margaret ; '

54060	54064	54047	54047	he	1676	' said Dr. May. '

54099	54104	54124	54124	he	0	' said the Doctor ; '
54136	54142	54126	54126	he	0	' but she answered calmly , '
54157	54158	54126	54126	he	0	' '
54162	54169	54126	54126	he	0	' said the Doctor , pausing ; '
54179	54180	54181	54181	I	0	' '
54229	54254	54223	54223	he	0	' Well , I 'll set Ritchie to write to Ernescliffe , and hear what he says . What must be , must be . '
54269	54289	54223	54223	he	0	' and as he left the room , his daughter again heard his sigh and half - uttered words , '
54295	54327	54293	54293	Maggie	238	' Southey . Etheldred had the satisfaction of seeing the Taylors at school on Sunday , but no Halls made their appearance , and , on inquiry , she was told , '
54338	54345	54331	54331	they	1686	' so Ethel condemned Granny Hall as '
54370	54371	54391	54391	Ritchie	262	' '
54375	54379	54391	54391	Ritchie	262	' said Richard ; '

54494	54768	54484	54484	I	0	' but here Ethel caught herself up , and began to perceive what a happiness it was that she had not the power of acting on her own impulses . The twins and their little brother of two years old were Christened in the afternoon , and Flora invited the parents to drink tea in the kitchen , and visit Lucy , while Ethel and Mary each carried a baby up - stairs to exhibit to Margaret . Richard , in the meantime , had a conversation with John Taylor , and learnt a good deal about the district , and the number of the people . At tea , he began to rehearse his information , and the Doctor listened with interest , which put Ethel in happy agitation , believing that the moment was come , and Richard seemed to be only waiting for the conclusion of a long tirade against those who ought to do something for the place , when behold ! Blanche was climbing on her father 's knee , begging for one of his Sunday stories . Etheldred was cruelly disappointed , and could not at first rejoice to see her father able again to occupy himself with his little girl . The narration , in his low tones , roused her from her mood of vexaation . It was the story of David , which he told in language scriptural and poetical , so pretty and tender in its simplicity , that she could not choose but attend . Ever and anon there was a glance towards Harry , as if he were secretly likening his own '
54772	54775	54829	54830	a giant	1693	' to the '

54794	54798	54792	54792	Blanche	300	' he concluded , '
54815	54816	54800	54800	you	1690	' '
54822	54826	54800	54800	you	1690	' said Tom . '

54959	55003	55007	55007	Ethel	300	' said he , smiling sweetly in answer to the children 's earnest looks as they caught his meaning , and if you do , you will not find it near so hard to deal with your great giant struggle when it comes . '
55154	55197	55144	55144	Margaret	249	' Here it is , Harry ; papa said you were to have it , and consider it well , and let him know , when you had taken time . You must do it soberly . It is once for all . '
55220	55231	55214	55214	her	1025	' Would you mind my kissing you , dear Harry ? '
55245	55253	55242	55242	she	1025	' Pray that you may choose right . '
55272	55283	55285	55285	Margaret	249	' I can scarcely say he gave any direct advice , '
55287	55393	55285	55285	Margaret	249	' he would not have thought that called for . He said , no doubt there were hardships and temptations , more or less , according to circumstances ; but , weighing one thing with another , he thought it gave as fair a chance of happiness as other professions , and the discipline and regularity had been very good for himself , as well as for many others he had known . He said , when a man is willing to go wrong there is much to help him , but when he is resolved on doing right , he need not be prevented . '
55394	55404	55406	55406	Norman	227	' That is what you may say of anything , '
55408	55456	55406	55406	Norman	227	' Just so ; and it answered papa 's question , whether it was exposing Harry to more temptation than he must meet with anywhere . That was the reason it was such a comfort to have anyone to write to , who understands it so well . '
55457	55466	55285	55285	Margaret	249	' Yes , and knows Harry 's nature . '
55467	55527	55285	55285	Margaret	249	' He said he had been fortunate in his captains , and had led , on the whole , a happy life at sea ; and he thought if it was so with him , Harry was likely to enjoy it more , being of a hardy adventurous nature , and a sailor from choice , not from circumstances . '
55528	55553	55406	55406	Norman	227	' Then he advised for it ? I did not think he would ; you know he will not let Hector be a sailor . '
55554	55601	55285	55285	Margaret	249	' He told me he thought only a strong natural bent that way made it desirable , and that he believed Hector only wished it from imitation of him . He said too , long ago , that he thought Harry cut out for a sailor . '
55602	55607	55609	55609	Norman	227	' A spirited fellow ! '
55631	55661	55609	55609	Norman	227	' He is up to anything , afraid of nothing , he can lick any boy in the school already . It will be worse than ever without him ! '
55662	55703	55704	55704	Harry	257	' Yes , you will miss your constant follower . He has been your shadow ever since he could walk . But there 's the clock , I must not keep you any longer ; good - bye , Norman . '
55732	55735	55737	55737	Norman	227	' Well , '
55742	55748	55750	55750	Harry	257	' It is all right , '
55844	55847	55850	55850	he	227	' June ! '
55854	55874	55850	55850	he	227	' I wish you were going too . I should not mind it half so much if you were . '
55875	55905	55850	55850	he	227	' Nonsense , Harry ! you want to be July after June all your life , do you ? You 'll be much more of a man without me . '
55958	55977	55982	55982	his	238	' We shall not think a bit the worse of you ; better now , than too late . '
55997	56019	55988	55988	Harry	257	' I did not think you would care so much , papa ; I wo n't go , if you do . '
56051	56065	56066	56066	he	238	' You must not give it up on that account , my dear , '
56071	56118	56066	56066	he	238	' I should not let you see this , if it did not happen at a time when I ca n't command myself as I ought . If you were an only son , it might be your duty to stay ; being one of many , '
56168	56191	56311	56311	his	269	' Harry paused , not that he doubted , but he was collecting his energies—'Then , papa , I choose the Navy . '
56192	56243	56311	56311	his	269	' Then it is done , Harry . You have chosen in a dutiful , unselfish spirit , and I trust it will prosper with you ; for I am sure your father 's blessing — aye , and your mother 's too , go with you ! Now then , '
56248	56296	56311	56311	his	269	' go and call Richard . I want him to write to Ernescliffe about that naval school . You must take your leave of the Whichcote foundation on Friday . I shall go and give Dr. Hoxton notice tomorrow , and get Tom 's name down instead . '
56462	56471	56473	56473	Richard	298	' But I am afraid , Mrs. Hall , '
56486	56508	56473	56473	Richard	298	' if you served them so , they would never be able to get to school at all , poor things . '
56509	56540	56542	56542	she	220	' Bless you , Sir , d'ye think I 'd ever lay a finger near them ; it 's only the way one must talk to children , you see , '
56548	56556	56558	56558	Richard	298	' Perhaps they have found that out , '
56571	56621	56622	56622	Granny	307	' aye , aye , that they have , the lasses — they be sharp enough for anything , that they be . Why , when I tell little Jenny that there 's the black man coming after her , what does she do but she ups and says , '
56626	56635	56624	56624	I	0	' tis only the wind in the chimney . '
56636	56647	56649	56649	Richard	298	' Then I do n't think it seems to answer , '
56651	56679	56649	56649	Richard	298	' Just suppose you were to try for once , really punishing them when they wo n't obey you , perhaps they would do it next time . '
56680	56709	56710	56710	Mary	220	' Why , Sir , you see I do n't like to take the stick to them ; they 've got no mother , you see , Sir . '
56725	56763	56710	56710	Mary	220	' I think it would be kinder to do it for once . What do you think they will do as they grow older , if you do n't keep them in order when they are little ? '
56900	56939	56880	56880	herself	1730	' If you please , Miss , I wanted to speak to you . I have got a little girl here , and I want to send her to school , only I have no shoes for her . '
56940	56960	56962	56962	Flora	346	' Why surely , if she can run about here on the heath , she can go to school , '
56964	57082	56962	56962	Flora	346	' Oh ! but there is all the other children to point at her . The poor thing would be daunted , you see , Miss ; if I could but get some friend to give her a pair of shoes , I 'd send her in a minute . I want her to get some learning ; as I am always saying , I 'd never keep her away , if I had but got the clothes to send her in . I never lets her be running on the common , like them Halls , as it 's a shame to see them in nice frocks , as Mrs. Hall got by going hypercriting about . '

57097	57153	57091	57091	Richard	298	' Watts , if you please , Sir ; we heard there was good work up here , Sir , and so we came ; but I 'd never have set foot in it if I had known what a dark heathenish place it is , with never a Gospel minister to come near it , '
57205	57265	57202	57202	Flora	346	' You will soon get her clothed if she comes regularly to school on Sundays , for she will be admitted into the club ; I will recommend her if she has a good character and comes regularly . Good morning , Mrs. Watts . Now we must go , or it will be dark before we get home . '

57386	57398	57384	57384	Ethel	300	' I did not know in the least what to say . '

57415	57437	57413	57413	Flora	346	' and at least it will do the child good ; but I congratulate you on the promising aspect of Cocksmoor . '

58567	58584	58534	58534	Harry	257	' Sent for to Whitford . But oh ! Norman , Dux ! Is he really ? '
58585	58596	58599	58599	he	257	' To be sure , but I must tell Margaret ; '
58690	58701	58684	58684	Ethel	300	' But is it , is it true , Norman ? '

58751	58765	58749	58749	Flora	346	' Are you tired , Norman , dear ; does your head ache ? '
58766	58769	58706	58706	he	257	' Yes ; '
58777	58785	58787	58787	Ethel	300	' Wo n't you come to Margaret ? '
58841	58844	58846	58846	he	257	' Ah ! '
58853	58931	58846	58846	he	257	' he is regularly done for . He ought to turn in at once . That Everard is a famous fellow for an examiner . He said he never had seen such a copy of verses sent up by a school - boy , and could hardly believe June was barely sixteen . Old Hoxton says he is the youngest Dux they have had these fifty years that he has known the school , and Mr. Wilmot said '

59168	59228	59165	59165	Wilmot	277	' twas no mere task , but had poetry , and all that sort of thing in it . But I do n't know whether that would have done , if he had not come out so strong in the recitation ; they put him on in Priam 's speech to Achilles , and he said it — Oh ! '

59457	59471	59473	59473	Flora	346	' I suppose you looked so happy , they could not help it , '
59484	59487	59489	59489	Norman	227	' Aye , '
59494	59512	59489	59489	Norman	227	' they had something to say to him on his own score , which he has forgotten . '

59523	59559	59521	59521	Harry	257	' Why , what d'ye think they said ? That I had gone on as well as all the Mays , and they trusted I should still , and be a credit to my profession . '
59560	59572	59602	59602	Mary	220	' Oh ! Harry ! why did n't you tell us ? '
59579	59598	59602	59602	Mary	220	' and , as the two elder girls made this exclamation , Mary proceeded to a rapturous embrace . '

59879	59914	59872	59872	Margaret	249	' After telling it once in her room , once in the nursery , in whispers like gusts of wind , and once in the pantry , Harry employed himself in writing—'Norman is Dux ! '
59985	59994	59996	59996	she	249	' Poor fellow ! he is sadly overdone , '
60002	60005	60007	60007	Ethel	300	' Oh ! '
60014	60036	60007	60007	Ethel	300	' tis not like what I used to fancy it would be when he came to the head of the school ! '
60037	60046	60048	60048	Margaret	249	' It will be different to - morrow , '
60059	60093	60048	60048	Margaret	249	' Think how he has been on the strain this whole day , and long before , doing so much more than older boys . No wonder he is tired and worn out . '
60117	60129	60131	60131	she	249	' I hope he will be like himself to - morrow ! '
60135	60153	60131	60131	she	249	' I never saw him rough and hasty before . It was even with you , Margaret . '
60154	60210	60053	60053	herself	249	' No , no , Ethel , you arn't going to blame your own Norman for unkindness on this of all days in the year . You know how it was , you love him better ; just as I do , for not being able to bear to stay in this room , where — '
60211	60214	60216	60216	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
60220	60253	60254	60254	she	300	' it was a great shame of me ! How could I ? Dear Norman ! how he does grieve — what love his must have been ! But yet , Margaret , '
60266	60298	60254	60254	she	300	' I cannot — cannot bear it ! To have him not caring one but for all of us ! I want him to triumph ! I ca n't without him ! '
60299	60338	60053	60053	herself	249	' What , Ethel , you , who said you did n't care for mere distinction and praise ? Do n't you think dear mamma would say it was safer for him not to be delighted and triumphant ? '
60339	60345	60347	60347	Ethel	300	' It is very tiresome , '
60359	60373	60375	60375	Margaret	249	' And does not one love those two dear boys to - night ! '
60377	60415	60375	60375	Margaret	249	' Norman , not able to rejoice in his victory without her , and Harry in such an ecstacy with Norman 's honours . I do n't think I ever was so fond of my two brothers . '
60635	60639	60640	60640	he	7526	' My boy , '
60643	60657	60640	60640	he	7526	' I had not expected this of you . Well done , Norman ! '
60773	60779	60762	60762	he	227	' Well , said Norman , '
60796	60797	60798	60798	Harry	257	' '
60806	60811	60798	60798	Harry	257	' said Dr. May , '
60841	60859	60839	60839	Ethel	300	' O , give us for our Kings such Queens , And for our Ducks such Drakes . '
61061	61070	61072	61072	Norman	227	' I do n't want to be cross , '
61089	61109	61072	61072	Norman	227	' but I can not help it . I wish people would not make such a fuss about it . '
61110	61122	61072	61072	Norman	227	' I do n't think you can be well , Norman . '
61123	61134	61072	61072	Norman	227	' Nonsense . There 's nothing the matter with me . '
61135	61154	61072	61072	Norman	227	' But I do n't understand your not caring at all , and not being the least pleased . '
61155	61162	61164	61164	Norman	227	' It only makes it worse , '
61166	61233	61164	61164	Norman	227	' I only feel as if I wanted to be out of the way . My only comfortable time yesterday was on that bench in the cool quiet cloister . I do n't think I could have got through without that , when they left me in peace , till Cheviot and Harry came to rout me up , and I knew it was all coming . '
61234	61279	61072	61072	Norman	227	' Ah ! you have overworked yourself , but it was for something . You have given papa such pleasure and comfort , as you ca n't help being glad of . That is very different from us foolish young ones and our trumpeting . '
61280	61398	61072	61072	Norman	227	' What comfort can it be ? I 've not been the smallest use all this time . When he was ill , I left him to Ernescliffe , and lay on the floor like an ass ; and if he were to ask me to touch his arm , I should be as bad again . A fine thing for me to have talked all that arrogant stuff about Richard ! I hate the thought of it ; and , as if to make arrows and barbs of it , here 's Richard making as much of this as if it was a double first class ! He afraid to be compared with me , indeed ! '
61399	61441	61072	61072	Norman	227	' Norman , indeed , this is going too far . We ca n't be as useful as the elder ones ; and when you know how papa was vexed about Richard , you must be glad to have pleased him . '
61442	61472	61072	61072	Norman	227	' If I were he , it would only make me miss her more . I believe he only makes much of me that he may not disappoint me . '
61473	61555	61072	61072	Norman	227	' I do n't think so . He is really glad , and the more because she would have been so pleased . He said it would have been a happy day for her , and there was more of the glad look than the sorry one . It was the glistening look that comes when he is watching baby , or hearing Margaret say pretty things to her . You see it is the first bright morning we have had . '
61556	61559	61561	61561	Norman	227	' Yes , '
61563	61582	61561	61561	Norman	227	' perhaps it was , but I do n't know . I thought half of it was din . '
61583	61587	61072	61072	Norman	227	' Oh Norman ! '
61588	61684	61072	61072	Norman	227	' And another thing , Ethel , I do n't feel as if I had fairly earned it . Forder or Cheviot ought to have had it . They are both more really good scholars than I am , and have always been above me . There was nothing I really knew better , except those historical questions that no one reckoned on ; and not living at home with their sisters and books , they had no such chance , and it is very hard on them , and I do n't like it . '
61685	61698	61072	61072	Norman	227	' Well , but you really and truly beat them in everything . '
61699	61799	61801	61801	Norman	227	' Aye , by chance . There were lots of places in construing , where I should have broken down if I had happened to be set on in them ; it was only a wonder I did not in that chorus , for I had only looked at it twice ; but Everard asked me nothing but what I knew ; and now and then I get into a funny state , when nothing is too hard for me , and that was how it was yesterday evening . Generally , I feel as dull as a post , '
61807	61826	61801	61801	Norman	227	' I could not make a nonsense hexameter this minute , if I was to die for it . '
61827	61834	61836	61836	Ethel	300	' A sort of Berserkar fury ! '
61838	61865	61836	61836	Ethel	300	' like that night you did the coral - worm verses . It 's very odd . Are you sure you are well , dear Norman ? '
61970	61981	61966	61966	he	856	' I want to know what you think of Norman : '
61982	61988	61990	61990	Margaret	249	' How do you mean ? '
61992	61998	61990	61990	Margaret	249	' in health or spirits ? '
61999	62002	62004	62005	Dr. May.	346	' Both , '
62006	62058	61990	61990	Margaret	249	' Poor boy ! he has never held up his head since October , and , at his age , that is hardly natural . He goes moping about , has lost flesh and appetite , and looks altogether out of order , shooting up like a May - pole too . '
62059	62064	62066	62066	Margaret	249	' Mind and body , '
62104	62108	62101	62101	he	856	' funny state . '
62109	62265	62101	62101	he	856	' Yes , both . I fancied it was only his rapid growth , and the excitement of this examination , and that it would go off , but I think there 's more amiss . He was lounging about doing nothing , when the girls were gone to school after dinner , and I asked him to walk down with me to the Almshouses . He did not seem very willing , but he went , and presently , as I had hold of his arm , I felt him shivering , and saw him turn as pale as a sheet . As soon as I noticed it , he flushed crimson , and would not hear of turning back , stoutly protesting he was quite well , but I saw his hand was quivering even when I got into Church . Why , Ethel , you have turned as red as he did . '
62266	62273	62275	62275	Ethel	300	' Then he has done it ! '
62282	62292	62275	62275	Ethel	300	' What do you mean ? Speak , Ethel . '
62293	62303	62305	62305	she	300	' He has gone past it — the place , '
62324	62336	62307	62308	The Doctor	890	' you do n't mean he has never been there since ? '
62337	62340	62342	62342	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
62344	62369	62342	62342	Ethel	300	' he has always gone round Randall 's alley or the garden ; he has said nothing , but has contrived to avoid it . '
62372	62381	62382	62382	I	0	' said Dr. May , after a pause , '

62445	62462	62433	62433	He	1831	' said Ethel , as her father drew out her words , apparently with his eye ; '

62809	62850	62800	62800	he	1831	' And Ethel was much relieved by pouring out all she knew , though her alarm was by no means lessened by the effect it produced on her father , especially when he heard of the " funny state . " '
62851	62858	62859	62859	he	1831	' A fine state of things , '
62862	62947	62859	62859	he	1831	' I wonder it has not brought on a tremendous illness by this time . A boy of that sensitive temperament meeting with such a such a shock — never looked after — the quietest and most knocked down of all , and therefore the most neglected — his whole system disordered — and then driven to school to be harassed and overworked ; if we had wanted to occasion brain fever we could not have gone a better way to set about it .

62961	62962	62967	62967	papa	7391	' '
62969	62977	62967	62967	papa	7391	' cried Ethel , in extreme distress , '

62995	63027	63029	63030	the Doctor	890	'm not blaming you , Ethel , you knew no better , but it has been grievous neglect . It is plain enough there is no one to see after you , '
63037	63046	63048	63048	Margaret	249	' We may be taking it in time , '

63233	63267	63268	63268	Papa	218	' Chaucer . That night Norman started from , what was not so much sleep , as a trance of oppression and suffering , and beheld his father 's face watching him attentively . '

63555	63581	63582	63582	Norman	227	' it will not do to go on in this way . If your mother was here , you would not close yourself against her . '
63592	63625	63582	63582	Norman	227	' It is no good saying it — I thought it would only make it worse for you ; but that 's it . I can not bear the being without her . '
63650	63655	63657	63657	he	7526	' My poor boy , '
63664	63698	63657	63657	he	7526	' only One can comfort you truly ; but you must not turn from me ; you must let me do what I can for you , though it is not the same . '
63699	63708	63710	63710	Norman	227	' I thought it would grieve you more , '
63719	63742	63710	63710	Norman	227	' What , to find my children feeling with me , and knowing what they have lost ? Surely not , Norman . '
63743	63751	63753	63753	Norman	227	' And it is of no use , '
63760	63766	63753	63753	Norman	227	' no one can comfort — '
63767	63773	63775	63776	Dr. May	238	' There you are wrong , '
63781	63858	63775	63776	Dr. May	238	' there is much of comfort in everything , in everybody , in kindness , in all around , if one can only open one 's mind to it . But I did not come to keep you awake with such talk ; I saw you were not quite well , so I came up to see about you ; and now , Norman , you will not refuse to own that something is the matter . '
63859	63866	63868	63868	Norman	227	' I did not know it , '
63870	63906	63868	63868	Norman	227	' I really believe I am well , if I could get rid of these horrible nights . I either lie awake , tumbling and tossing , or I get all sorts of unbearable dreams . '
63907	63965	63775	63776	Dr. May	238	' Aye , when I asked master Harry about you , all the answer I could get was , that he was quite used to it , and did not mind it at all . As if I asked for his sake ! How fast that boy sleeps — he is fit for a midshipman 's berth ! '
63966	63978	63868	63868	Norman	227	' But do you think there is anything amiss with me ? '
63979	64035	63775	63776	Dr. May	238	' I shall know more about that to - morrow morning . Come to my room as soon as you are up , unless I come to you . Now , I have something to read before I go to bed , and I may as well try if it will put you to sleep . '
64143	64148	64150	64151	Dr. May.	346	' At it again ! '
64152	64170	64150	64151	Dr. May.	346	' Carry it away , Ethel . I will have no Latin or Greek touched these holidays . '
64171	64175	64177	64177	Norman	227	' You know , '
64179	64195	64177	64177	Norman	227	' if I do n't sap , I shall have no chance of keeping up . '
64196	64209	64150	64151	Dr. May.	346	' You 'll keep no where , if you do n't rest . '
64210	64224	64226	64226	Norman	227	' It is only Euripides , and I ca n't do anything else , '
64230	64300	64226	64226	Norman	227	' Very likely , I do n't care . You have to get well first of all , and the Greek will take care of itself . Go up to Margaret . I put you in her keeping , while I am gone to Whitford . After that , I dare say Richard will be very glad to have a holiday , and let you drive me to Abbotstoke . '
64318	64347	64316	64316	herself	1025	' Papa , I did not think Euripides would hurt him — he knows it all so well , and he said he could not read anything else . '
64348	64390	64226	64226	Norman	227	' Just so , Ethel . Poor fellow , he has not spirits or energy for anything ; his mind was forced into those classicalities when it wanted rest , and now it has not spring enough to turn back again . '
64391	64400	64316	64316	herself	1025	' Do you think him so very ill ? '
64401	64446	64226	64226	Norman	227	' Not exactly , but there 's low fever hanging about him , and we must look after him well , and I hope we may get him right . I have told Margaret about him ; I ca n't stop any longer now . '
64627	64636	64641	64641	she	249	' How can you bear it , Margaret ? '
64661	64668	64641	64641	she	249	' Mercy , here 's another , '
64704	64735	64737	64737	she	220	' No , indeed , Mary , I could not think of such a thing . You had better go back to your lessons , and do n't be silly , '
64744	64757	64759	64759	Norman	227	' No one but a Tom - boy would dream of it , '
64784	64812	64767	64767	Margaret	249	' There , I believe I have done . I hope I was not cross with poor Mary , but it was rather too much to ask . '
64813	64827	64829	64829	Norman	227	' I ca n't think how you can help being cross to everyone , '

65552	65874	65543	65543	I	0	' Norman read , but , ere long , took to yawning ; Margaret begged for the book , which he willingly resigned , saying , however , that he liked it , only he was stupid . She read on aloud , till she heard a succession of heavy breathings , and saw him fast asleep , and so he continued till waked by his father 's coming home . Richard and Ethel were glad of a walk , for Margaret had found them a pleasant errand . Their Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner between service and afternoon school , and Margaret had desired the cook to serve them up some broth in the back kitchen , to which the brother and sister were now to invite them . Mary was allowed to take her boots to Rebekah Watts , since Margaret held that goodness had better be profitable , at least at the outset ; and Harry and Tom joined the party . Norman , meantime , was driving his father — a holiday preferment highly valued in the days when Dr. May used only to assume the reins , when his spirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young hand over them , or when the old hack took a fit of laziness . Now , Norman needed Richard 's assurance that the bay was steady , so far was he from being troubled with his ancient desire , that the steed would rear right up on his hind legs . He could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town , and found himself master of the animal , and even then the words were few , and chiefly spoken by Dr. May , until after going along about three miles of the turnpike road , he desired Norman to turn down a cross - country lane .

66082	66228	66270	66271	his father	7526	' said Dr. May , as they came to the bottom of the valley , where a stream rushed along , coloured with a turbid creamy yellow , making little whirlpools where it crossed the road , and brawling loudly just above where it roared and foamed between two steep banks of rock , crossed by a foot - bridge of planks , guarded by a handrail of rough poles . The Doctor had traversed it , and gone a few paces beyond , when , looking back , he saw Norman very pale , with one foot on the plank , and one hand grasping the rail . He came back , and held out his hand , which Norman gladly caught at , but no sooner was the other side attained , than the boy , though he gasped with relief , exclaimed , '
66234	66247	66248	66248	He	0	' Wait one moment , please , and let me go back . '
66283	66298	66299	66299	he	7526	' Stop , Norman , do n't try it . You are not fit , '

66381	66407	66367	66367	You	893	' But the further Norman was from the bridge , the more displeased he was with himself , and more anxious to dare it again . '
66414	66418	66367	66367	You	893	' he muttered ; '

66780	66856	66776	66776	Norman	227	' now they have put me up , it will never do to be beaten , and all the four others ought to be able to do it . I did not want or expect to be Dux , but now I am , you could not bear me not to keep my place , and to miss the Randall scholarship , as I certainly shall , if I do not work these whole holidays . '

66871	67130	66866	66867	his father	7526	' I am very sorry for you , and I know I am asking of you what I could not have done at your age — indeed , I do nt believe I could have done it for you a few months ago . It is my fault that you have been let alone , to have an overstrain and pressure on your mind , when you were not fit for it , and I can not see any remedy but complete freedom from work . At the same time , if you fret and harass yourself about being surpassed , that is , as you say , much worse for you than Latin and Greek . Perhaps I may be wrong , and study might not do you the harm I think it would ; at any rate , it is better than tormenting yourself about next half year , so I will not positively forbid it , but I think you had much better let it alone . I do n't want to make it a matter of duty . I only tell you this , that you may set your mind at rest as far as I am concerned . If you do lose your place , I will consider it as my own doing , and not be disappointed . I had rather see you a healthy , vigorous , useful man , than a poor puling nervous wretch of a scholar , if you were to get all the prizes in the University . '
67152	67178	67149	67149	he	227	' Then you will not be displeased , papa , if I do read , as long as I feel it does me no harm . '
67179	67209	67149	67149	he	227	' I told you I do n't mean to make it a matter of obedience . Do as you please — I had rather you read than vexed yourself . '
67210	67222	67224	67224	Norman	227	' I am glad of it . Thank you , papa , '
67418	67421	67423	67424	the Doctor	890	' Yes , '
67426	67476	67477	67477	he	890	' it is very fine , is it not ? I used to bring mamma here now and then for a treat , because it put her in mind of her Scottish hills . Well , your 's are the golden hills of heaven , now , my Maggie ! '

67800	67818	67797	67797	he	238	' Is it you ? I thought it was mamma . She said it was all ambition . '
67845	67894	67833	67833	he	227	' I did n't know I had been asleep . I was awake just now , thinking about it . Papa , I 'll give it up . I 'll try to put next half out of my head , and not mind if they do pass me . '
67895	67903	67905	67906	the Doctor	890	' That 's right , my boy , '
67908	67941	67905	67906	the Doctor	890	' At least if Cheviot and Forder do , for they ought . I only hope Anderson wo n't . I can stand anything but that . But that is nonsense too . '
67942	67950	67952	67953	the Doctor	890	' You are quite right , Norman , '
67955	67972	67952	67953	the Doctor	890	' and it is a great relief to me that you see the thing so sensibly . '
67973	68102	67905	67906	the Doctor	890	' No , I do n't see it sensibly at all , papa . I hate it all the time , and I do n't know whether I can keep from thinking of it , when I have nothing to do ; but I see it is wrong ; I thought all ambition and nonsense was gone out of me , when I cared so little for the examination ; but now I see , though I did not want to be made first , I ca n't bear not to be first ; and that 's the old story , just as she used to tell me to guard against ambition . So I 'll take my chance , and if I should get put down , why '

69436	69485	69432	69433	Miss Anderson	378	' It must have been a delightful surprise . We could hardly believe it when Harvey came in and told us . Everyone thought Forder was sure , but they all were put out by the questions of general information — those were all Mr. Everard 's doing . '
69486	69501	69503	69503	Flora	346	' Mr. Everard was very much struck with Norman 's knowledge and scholarship too , '
69505	69550	69503	69503	Flora	346	' So everyone says . It was all Mr. Everard 's doing , Miss Harrison told mamma , but , for my part , I am very glad for the sake of Stoneborough ; I like a town boy to be at the head . '
69551	69560	69562	69562	Ethel	300	' Norman was sorry for Forder and Cheviot — '
69585	69589	69591	69591	she	377	' He felt , '
69601	69624	69591	69591	she	377	' as if it was hardly right , when they are so much his seniors , and he could scarcely enjoy it . '
69625	69635	69637	69637	Louisa	377	' Ah ! that is just what people say , '
69639	69678	69637	69637	Louisa	377	' But it must be very gratifying to you , and it makes him certain of the Randall scholarship too , I suppose . It is a great thing for him ! He must have worked very hard . '
69679	69686	69688	69688	Flora	346	' Yes , that he has , '
69690	69704	69637	69637	Louisa	377	' he is so fond of study , and that goes half way . '
69705	69772	69637	69637	Louisa	377	' So is dear Harvey . How earnest he is over his books ! Mamma sometimes says , " Now Harvey , dear , you 'll be quite stupified , you 'll be ill ; I really shall get Dr. May to forbid you . " I suppose Norman is very busy too ; it is quite the fashion for boys not to be idle now . '
69773	69781	69783	69783	Ethel	300	' Poor Norman ca n't help it , '
69787	69803	69783	69783	Ethel	300	' Papa will not hear of his doing any Latin or Greek these whole holidays . '
69804	69818	69820	69820	Flora	346	' He thinks he will come to it better again for entire rest , '
69859	69886	69887	69887	Ethel	300	' By - the - bye , Ethel , it is you that are the great patroness of the wild Cocksmoor children — are not you ? '
69899	69922	69894	69894	Flora	346	' Richard and Ethel have been there once or twice . You know our under nursery - maid is a Cocksmoor girl . '
69923	69964	69887	69887	Ethel	300	' Well , mamma said she could not think how Miss May could take one from thence . The whole place is full of thieves , and do you know , Bessie Boulder has lost her gold pencil - case . '
69965	69969	69971	69971	Flora	346	' Has she ? '
69973	69987	69971	69971	Flora	346	' And she had it on Sunday when she was teaching her class . '
69988	69991	69993	69993	Ethel	300	' Oh ! '
69997	70009	69993	69993	Ethel	300	' surely she does not suspect any of those poor children ! '
70010	70023	70025	70025	Fanny	311	' I only know such a thing never happened at school before , '
70027	70038	69993	69993	Ethel	300	' and I shall never take anything valuable there again . '
70039	70050	69971	69971	Flora	346	' But is she sure she lost it at school ? '
70051	70079	69993	69993	Ethel	300	' O yes , quite certain . She will not accuse anyone , but it is not comfortable . And how those children do behave at Church ! '
70080	70090	70092	70092	Flora	346	' Poor things ! they have been sadly neglected , '

70215	70265	69993	69993	Ethel	300	' Well , Mrs. Ledwich is nearly resolved to insist , so you had better be warned , Ethel . She can not suffer such untidiness and rags to spoil the appearance of the school , and , I assure you , it is quite unpleasant to the teachers . '

They had caught some more Sunday - school children by the help of Margaret 's broth , but it was up - hill work ; the servants did not like such guests in the kitchen , and they were still less welcome at school .

71852	71924	71925	71925	Mat	293	' The Tuesday of this week was appointed for the visit of the London surgeon , Sir Matthew Fleet , and the expectation caused Dr. May to talk much to Margaret of old times , and the days of his courtship , when it had been his favorite project that his friend and fellow - student should marry Flora Mackenzie , and there had been a promising degree of liking , but '
71926	72109	72110	72110	I	0	' had been obliged to be prudent , and had ended by never marrying at all . This the Doctor , as well as his daughters , believed was for the sake of Aunt Flora , and thus the girls were a good deal excited about his coming , almost as much on his own account , as because they considered him as the arbitrer of Margaret 's fate . He only came in time for a seven o'clock dinner , and Margaret did not see him that night , but heard enough from her sisters , when they came up to tell the history of their guest , and of the first set dinner when Flora had acted as lady of the , house . The dinner it appeared had gone off very well . Flora had managed admirably , and the only mishap was some awkward carving of Ethel 's which had caused the dish to be changed with Norman . As to the guest , Flora said he was very good - looking and agreeable . Ethel abruptly pronounced , '
72121	72122	72117	72118	Uncle Arnott	386	' '
72129	72133	72123	72123	I	0	' said Flora . '

72374	72378	72335	72335	he	7391	' said Flora : '
72385	72400	72383	72383	Norman	227	' as he entered—'why they are not out of the dining - room yet ! '
72401	72422	72335	72335	he	7391	' No ; they are talking of some new invention , and most likely will not come for an hour . '
72423	72430	72383	72383	Norman	227	' Are you going to bed ? '
72431	72450	72383	72383	Norman	227	' Papa followed me out of the dining - room to tell me to do so after tea . '
72451	72491	72335	72335	he	7391	' Then sit down there , and I 'll go and make some , and let it come up with Margaret 's . Come , Ethel . Good night , Norman . Is your head aching to - night ? '
72492	72507	72383	72383	Norman	227	' Not much , now I have got out of the dining - room . '
72508	72520	72522	72522	Flora	280	' It would have been wiser not to have gone in , '
72528	72539	72541	72541	Norman	227	' It was not the dinner , but the man , '
72543	72568	72541	72541	Norman	227	' It is incomprehensible to me how my father could take to him . I 'd as soon have Harvey Anderson for a friend ! '
72569	72575	72577	72577	Ethel	300	' You are like me , '
72579	72589	72577	72577	Ethel	300	' in being glad he is not our uncle . '
72590	72603	72605	72605	Norman	227	' He presume to think of falling in love with Aunt Flora ! '
72609	72619	72621	72621	Margaret	249	' Why , what is the matter with him ? '
72623	72640	72621	72621	Margaret	249	' I ca n't find much ground for Ethel 's dislike , and Flora is pleased . '
72641	72655	72657	72657	Norman	227	' She did not hear the worst , nor you either , Ethel , '
72659	72674	72657	72657	Norman	227	' I could not stand the cold hard way he spoke of hospital patients . '
72774	73017	73020	73020	Margaret	249	' Norman 's indignation had quite revived him , and Margaret was much entertained with the conflicting opinions . The next was Richard 's , when he came in late to wish her good night , after he had been attending on Sir Matthew 's examination of his father 's arm . He did nothing but admire the surgeon 's delicacy of touch and understanding of the case , his view agreeing much better with Dr. May 's own than with Mr. Ward 's . Dr. May had never been entirely satisfied with the present mode of treatment , and Richard was much struck by hearing him say , in answer to Sir Matthew , that he knew his recovery might have been more speedy and less painful if he had been able to attend to it at first , or to afford time for being longer laid up . A change of treatment was now to be made , likely soon to relieve the pain , to be less tedious and trouble - some , and to bring about a complete cure in three or four months at latest . In hearing such tidings , there could be little thought of the person who brought them , and Margaret did not , till the last moment , learn that Richard thought Sir Matthew very clever and sensible , and certain to understand her case . Her last visitor was her father : '
73038	73039	73041	73041	he	227	' '
73043	73044	73041	73041	he	227	' '

73356	73459	73344	73345	my Margaret	2025	' After a night spent in waking intervals of such thoughts , Margaret found the ordinary morning , and the talk she could not escape , somewhat oppressive . Her brothers and sisters disturbed her by their open expressions of hope and anxiety ; she dreaded to have the balance of tranquillity overset ; and then blamed herself for selfishness in not being as ready to attend to them as usual . Ethel and Norman came up after breakfast , their aversion by no means decreased by further acquaintance . Ethel was highly indignant at the tone in which he had exclaimed , '
73472	73495	73496	73496	You	2026	' on discovering the existence of the baby ; and when Norman observed that was not so atrocious either , she proceeded , '
73518	73519	73520	73520	I	0	' '
73521	73529	73531	73531	Norman	227	'm glad he has not to settle , '
73533	73561	73531	73531	Norman	227	' Papa said Harry was to be a sailor , and he said it was a good way to save expenses of education — a good thing . '
73562	73566	73568	73568	Norman	227	' No doubt , '
73570	73593	73568	73568	Norman	227	' he thinks papa only wants to get rid of us , or if not , that it is an amiable weakness . '
73594	73606	73608	73608	Margaret	249	' But I ca n't see anything so shocking in this , '
73610	73617	73619	73619	Norman	227	' It is not the words , '
73621	73649	73619	73619	Norman	227	' the look and tone convey it ; but there are different opinions . Flora is quite smitten with him , he talks so politely to her . '
73650	73654	73656	73656	Ethel	300	' And Blanche ! '
73658	73696	73656	73656	Ethel	300	' The little affected pussy - cat made a set at him , bridled and talked in her mincing voice , with all her airs , and made him take a great deal of notice of her . '
73877	73907	73861	73861	His	856	' Well , Margaret , I am glad we had him down . He thinks you may get about again , though it may be a long time first . '
73908	73915	73921	73921	her	249	' Does he — oh papa ! '
73932	73951	73925	73925	she	249	' He has known the use of the limbs return almost suddenly after even a year or two , '
73978	73985	73986	73986	he	238	' though , my poor child , '
73989	74004	73986	73986	he	238	' I feared the harm I had done you was irremediable , but thanks — '
74230	74441	74216	74216	he	2040	' I never saw such a change . Mat Fleet was one of the most warm , open - hearted fellows in the world , up to anything . I can hardly believe he is the same — turned into a mere machine , with a moving spring of self - interest ! I do n't believe he cares a rush for any living thing ! Except for your sake , Margaret , I wish I had never seen him again , and only remembered him as he was at Edinburgh , as I remember dear old Spencer . It is a grievous thing ! Ruined entirely ! No doubt that London life must be trying — the constant change and bewilderment of patients preventing much individual care and interest . It must be very hardening . No family ties either , nothing to look to but pushing his way . Yes ! there 's great excuse for poor Mat . I never knew fully till now the blessing it was that your dear mother was willing to take me so early , and that this place was open to me with all its home connexions and interests . I am glad I never had anything to do with London ! '

Norman began to shake off his extreme languor and depression , the Doctor was relieved from much of the wearing suffering from his hurt , and his despondency as to Margaret 's ultimate recovery had been driven away . The experiment of taking her up succeeded so well , that on Sunday she was fully attired , '
74907	75033	75035	75035	you	2055	' As she lay on the sofa there seemed an advance toward recovery . Much sweet coquetry was expended in trying to look her best for her father ; and her best was very well , for though the brilliant bloom of health was gone , her cheeks had not lost their pretty rounded contour , and still had some rosiness , while her large bright blue eyes smiled and sparkled . A screen shut out the rest of the room , making a sort of little parlour round the fire , where sundry of the family were visiting her after coming home from Church in the afternoon . Ethel was in a vehement state of indignation at what had that day happened at school . '

75835	75882	75832	75832	Richard	298	' We thought of trying to get a room , and going perhaps once or twice a week to give them a little teaching . It would be little enough , but it might do something towards civilizing them , and making them wish for more . '

76073	76089	76091	76091	she	300	' Thank you ! thank you , papa ! O Ritchie ! Oh ! Margaret ! '
76100	76111	76113	76114	the Doctor	890	' You have worked yourself up to a fine pass , '
76128	76135	76113	76114	the Doctor	890	' Remember , slow and steady . '
76136	76145	76147	76147	Ethel	300	' I 've got Richard to help me , '
76149	76153	76161	76161	he	856	' Sufficient guarantee , '
76176	76187	76161	76161	he	856	' You will keep the Unready in order , Ritchie . '
76188	76192	76194	76194	Margaret	249	' He does , '
76196	76224	76194	76194	Margaret	249	' he has taken her education into his hands , and I really believe he has taught her to hold up her frock and stick in pins . '
76225	76262	76161	76161	he	856	' And to know her right hand from her left , Eh , Ethel ? Well , you deserve some credit , then . Suppose we ask Mr. Wilmot to tea , and talk it over . '
76263	76279	76161	76161	he	856	' O thank you , papa ! When shall it be ? To - morrow ? '
76280	76313	76194	76194	Margaret	249	' Yes , if you like . I have to go to the town - council meeting , and am not going into the country , so I shall be in early . '
76314	76323	76161	76161	he	856	' Thank you . O how very nice ! '
76324	76337	76161	76161	he	856	' And what about cost ? Do you expect to rob me ? '
76338	76345	76347	76347	Ethel	300	' If you would help us , '
76355	76378	76347	76347	Ethel	300	' we meant to make what we have go as far as may be , but mine is only fifteen and sixpence . '
76379	76400	76161	76161	he	856	' Well , you must make interest with Margaret for the turn - out of my pocket to - morrow . '
76401	76411	76413	76416	the brother and sister	8597	' Thank you , we are very much obliged , '
76420	76428	76413	76416	the brother and sister	8597	' that is more than we expected . '
76429	76448	76161	76161	he	856	' Ha ! do n't thank too soon . Suppose to - morrow should be a blank day . '
76449	76456	76458	76458	Ethel	300	' Oh , it wo n't ! '
76460	76472	76458	76458	Ethel	300	' I shall tell Norman to make you go to paying people '
76473	76478	76480	76481	the Doctor	890	' There 's avarice ! '
76483	76567	76480	76481	the Doctor	890	' But look you here , Ethel , if you 'll take my advice , you 'll make your bargain for Tuesday . I have a note appointing me to call at Abbotstoke Grange on Mr. Rivers , at twelve o'clock , on Tuesday . What do you think of that , Ethel ? An old banker , rich enough for his daughter to curl her hair in bank notes . If I were you , I 'd make a bargain for him . '
76568	76588	76458	76458	Ethel	300	' If he had nothing the matter with him , and I only got one guinea out of him ! '
76589	76599	76600	76600	Ethel	300	' Prudence ! Well , it may be wiser . '
76927	76929	76889	76889	She	300	' yes '
77039	77044	77056	77056	she	249	' in one moment , '
77048	77054	77056	77056	she	249	' now - or - never '
77059	77065	77056	77056	she	249	' Ethel dear , wait , '
77074	77083	77084	77084	she	300	' I 'll be back in a twinkling , '
77362	77369	77370	77370	She	300	' Aubrey ! put that down ! '
77478	77481	77483	77484	the Doctor	890	' Ethel ! '
77486	77497	77483	77484	the Doctor	890	' are you mad ? What were you thinking of ? '
77603	77611	77595	77596	Dr. May	238	' What could make you let him ? '
77612	77618	77619	77619	she	300	' I did n't see — '
77622	77645	77619	77619	she	300	' Did n't see ! Did n't look , did n't think , did n't care ! That 's it , Ethel . '
77688	77723	77682	77682	I	0	' Aubrey roared afresh , and Dr. May , kissing and comforting him , gathered him up in his left arm , and carried him away , looking back at the door to say , '
77756	77823	77826	77826	papa	7391	' Ethel was too much terrified to know where she was , or anything , but that she had let her little brother run into fearful peril , and grievously angered her father ; she was afraid to follow him , and stood still , annihilated , and in despair , till roused by his return ; then , with a stifled sob , she exclaimed , '
77828	77870	77826	77826	papa	7391	' and could get no further for a gush of tears . But the anger of the shock of terror was over , and Dr. May was sorry for her tears , though still he could not but manifest some displeasure . '
77875	77879	77873	77873	Ethel	300	' he said , '
77886	77895	77873	77873	Ethel	300	' and he could not but shudder again . '
77929	77930	77918	77918	Ethel	300	' '
77942	77951	77940	77940	Ethel	300	' You have said you would try before . '
77952	77958	77960	77960	Ethel	300	' I know I have , '
77964	77970	77960	77960	Ethel	300	' If I could but — '
77971	77975	77977	77978	Dr. May	238	' Poor child , '
77988	78011	78012	78012	he	238	' Ethel , my dear , I am afraid of its being with you as — as it has been with me ; '
78024	78113	78012	78012	he	238	' I grew up , thinking my inbred heedlessness a sort of grace , so to say , rather manly — the reverse of finikin . I was spoilt as a boy , and my Maggie carried on the spoiling , by never letting me feel its effects . By the time I had sense enough to regret this as a fault , I had grown too old for changing of ingrain , long - nurtured habits — perhaps I never wished it really . You have seen , '
78121	78154	78115	78115	his	238	' what my carelessness has come to — let that suffice at least , as a lesson that may spare you — what your father must feel as long as he lives . '
78238	78258	78227	78227	he	7391	' Oh ! Margaret , Margaret , how very terrible it is ! And does papa really think so ? '
78259	78265	78267	78267	Margaret	249	' I believe he does , '
78269	78279	78281	78281	Ethel	300	' How can he , can he bear it ! '
78287	78305	78281	78281	Ethel	300	' O it is enough to kill one — I ca n't think why it did not ! '
78306	78311	78313	78313	Margaret	249	' He bears it , '
78315	78449	78313	78313	Margaret	249	' because he is so very good , that help and comfort do come to him . Dear papa ! He bears up because it is right , and for our sakes , and he has a sort of rest in that perfect love they had for each other . He knows how she would wish him to cheer up and look to the end , and support and comfort are given to him , I know they are ; but oh , Ethel ! it does make one tremble and shrink , to think what he has been going through this autumn , especially when I hear him moving about late at night , and now and then comes a heavy groan — whenever any especial care has been on his mind . '
78456	78463	78465	78465	she	300	' To have grieved him again ! '
78467	78498	78465	78465	she	300	' and just as he seemed better and brighter ! Everything I do turns out wrong , and always will ; I ca n't do anything well by any chance . '
78499	78512	78313	78313	Margaret	249	' Yes you can , when you mind what you are about . '
78513	78543	78465	78465	she	300	' But I never can — I'm like him , everyone says so , and he says the heedlessness is ingrain , and ca n't be got rid of . '
78544	78559	78465	78465	she	300	' Ethel , I do n't really think he could have told you so . '
78560	78562	78465	78465	she	300	' I 'm
78568	78569	78564	78564	he	2131	' '
78590	78598	78599	78599	He	2131	' Margaret paused — and Ethel exclaimed , '
78629	78630	78616	78616	he	2131	' '
78691	78692	78688	78689	Miss Winter	214	' '
78742	78743	78725	78725	papa	7391	' '
78778	78779	78780	78780	I	0	' '
78789	78795	78796	78796	You	249	' said Ethel , thoughtfully . '
78845	78846	78838	78838	I	0	' '
78882	78883	78874	78874	I	0	' '
78889	78893	78886	78886	you	249	' said Ethel . '
78959	78960	78951	78951	you	249	' '
78991	78992	78982	78982	Aubrey	594	' '
79000	79004	79005	79005	he	7391	' cried Ethel , '
79130	79164	79124	79125	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Ethel sat for a long time with her head hidden in Margaret 's pillow , and her hand clasped by her good elder sister . At last she looked up and said , '
79263	79264	79265	79266	Dearest Ethel	300	' '
79303	79304	79305	79305	It	2145	' '
79312	79316	79310	79310	Richard	298	' said Ethel . '
79321	79325	79326	79326	I	0	' said Margaret . '
79337	79342	79328	79329	Mr. Wilmot	277	' said Ethel again . '
79358	79736	79737	79737	He	2146	' Ethel lingered with her sister till Harry and Mary came up with Margaret 's tea , and summoned her , and she crept down stairs , and entered the room so quietly , that she was hardly perceived behind her boisterous brother . She knew her eyes were in no presentable state , and cast them down , and shrank back as Mr. Wilmot shook her hand and greeted her kindly . Mr. Wilmot had been wo nt to come to tea , whenever he had anything to say to Dr. or Mrs. May , which was about once in ten or twelve days . He was Mary 's godfather , and their most intimate friend in the town , and he had often been with them , both as friend and Clergyman , through their trouble — no later than Christmas - Day , he had come to bring the feast of that day to Margaret in her sick room . Indeed , it had been chiefly for the sake of the Mays that he had resolved to spend the holidays at Stoneborogh , taking the care of Abbotstoke , while his brother , the Vicar , went to visit their father . This was , however , the first time he had come in his old familiar way to spend an evening , and there was something in the resumption of former habits that painfully marked the change . Ethel , on coming in , found Flora making tea , her father leaning back in his great chair in silence , Richard diligently cutting bread , and Blanche sitting on Mr. Wilmot 's knee , chattering fast and confidentially . Flora made Harry dispense the cups , and called everyone to their places ; Ethel timidly glanced at her father 's face , as he rose and came into the light . She thought the lines and hollows were more marked than ever , and that he looked fatigued and mournful , and she felt cut to the heart ; but he began to exert himself , and to make conversation , not , however , about Cocksmoor , but asking Mr. Wilmot what his brother thought of his new squire , Mr. Rivers . '
79743	79748	79737	79737	He	2146	' said Mr. Wilmot . '
79789	79790	79774	79774	They	2148	' '
79796	79800	79792	79792	family	2149	' asked Flora . '
79848	79967	79968	79968	We	2158	' So the talk lingered on , without much interest or life . It was rather keeping from saying nothing than conversation , and no one was without the sensation that she was missing , round whom all had been free and joyous — not that she had been wo nt to speak much herself , but nothing would go on smoothly or easily without her . So long did this last , that Ethel began to think her father meant to punish her by not beginning the subject that night , and though she owned that she deserved it , she could not help being very much disappointed . At length , however , her father began : '
80044	80045	80027	80027	Ethel	300	' '
80048	80058	80027	80027	Ethel	300	' said Mr. Wilmot , brightening and looking interested . '
80105	80156	80092	80096	some rough - looking boys	2168	' This embarked the Doctor in the history of the ladies being too fine to teach the poor Cocksmoor girls , which he told with kindling vehemence and indignation , growing more animated every moment , as he stormed over the wonted subject of the bad system of management — ladies '
80428	80431	80432	80432	she	300	' Ah ! '
80435	80454	80432	80432	she	300	' if he knew how ill I have behaved ! It is all show and hollowness with me . '
80537	80542	80544	80545	the Doctor	890	' Aye , aye ! '
80547	80577	80544	80545	the Doctor	890	' there 's much more in the boy than I used to think . He 's a capital fellow , and more like his mother than any of them . '
80578	80582	80584	80585	Mr. Wilmot	277	' He is , '
80587	80612	80584	80585	Mr. Wilmot	277	' there was a just , well - weighed sense and soberness in his plans that put me in mind of her every moment . '
80677	80691	80693	80694	Dr. May	238	' Norman , do you feel up to a long day 's work ? '
80701	80817	80693	80694	Dr. May	238	' I have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs. Gould , and to be at Abbotstoke Grange by twelve ; then I thought of going to Fordholm , and getting Miss Cleveland to give us some luncheon — there are some poor people on the way to look at ; and that girl on Far - view Hill ; and there 's another place to call at in coming home . You 'll have a good deal of sitting in the carriage , holding Whitefoot , so if you think you shall be cold or tired , do n't scruple to say so , and I 'll take Adams to drive me . '
80818	80824	80826	80826	Norman	227	' No , thank you , '
80830	80836	80826	80826	Norman	227	' This frost is famous . '
80837	80852	80854	80855	the Doctor	890	' It will turn to rain , I expect — it is too white , '
80863	80874	80854	80855	the Doctor	890	' How will you get to Cocksmoor , good people ? '
80875	80888	80890	80890	Richard	298	' Ethel wo n't believe it rains unless it is very bad , '
80914	80917	80919	80920	the Doctor	890	' Ha ! '
80934	80982	80919	80920	the Doctor	890	' there 's a considerable change in this place since I was here last . Well kept up indeed ! Not a dead leaf left under the old walnuts , and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners rolling it every day . '
80983	80988	80990	80990	Norman	227	' And the drive , '
80992	81010	80990	80990	Norman	227	' more like a garden walk than a road ! But oh ! what a splendid cedar ! '
81011	81100	81102	81102	Norman	227	' Is n't it ! I remember that as long as I remember anything . All this fine rolling of turf , and trimming up of the place , does not make much difference to you , old fellow , does it ? You do n't look altered since I saw you last , when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin . So they have a new entrance — very handsome conservatory — flowers — the banker does things in style . There , '
81110	81150	81102	81102	Norman	227	' wrap yourself up well , do n't get cold . The sun is gone in , and I should not wonder if the rain were coming after all . I 'll not be longer than I can help . '
81189	81201	81203	81203	he	227	' How much poor Margaret would enjoy one of those camellias , '
81205	81244	81203	81203	he	227	' and these people have bushels of them for mere show . If I were papa , I should be tempted to be like Beauty 's father , and carry off one . How she would admire it ! '
81467	81472	81482	81483	two ladies	2194	' Rollo ! Rollo ! '
81592	81597	81586	81586	his	398	' Good old fellow , '
81599	81605	81586	81586	his	398	' Here , old Rollo ! '
81684	81699	81701	81701	Norman	227	' So , old fellow , you know what the dinner - bell means , '
81703	81793	81701	81701	Norman	227	' I hope Mr. Rivers is hungry too . Miss Cleveland will have eaten up her whole luncheon , if this old bore wo n't let my father go soon ! I hope he is desperately ill—'tis his only excuse ! Heigh ho ! I must jump out to warm my feet soon ! There , there 's a drop of rain ! Well , there 's no end to it ! I wonder what Ethel is doing about Cocksmoor . It is setting in for a wet afternoon ! '
81830	81850	81825	81826	Dr. May	238	' Jump out , Norman , Mr. Rivers is so kind as to ask us to stay to luncheon . '
81910	81917	81919	81919	he	227	' Is this your eldest son ? '
81938	81958	81960	81961	Dr. May.	346	' No , this is my second . The eldest is not quite such a long - legged fellow , '
81978	81982	81984	81984	Norman	227	' At Stoneborough , '
82008	82012	81984	81984	Norman	227	' N. W. May '
82048	82066	82041	82042	his father	7526	' He is the head of the school — a thing we Stoneborough men think much of . '
82650	82665	82992	82993	Mrs. Larpent	401	' waiting , especially when Mrs. Larpent said , in a very pleasant tone , '
82677	82990	82992	82993	Mrs. Larpent	401	' He felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed her into the large room , the windows opening into the conservatory , the whole air fragrant with flowers , the furniture and ornaments so exquisite of their kind , and all such a fit scene for the beautiful little damsel , who , with her slender dog by her side , tripped on demurely , and rather shyly , but with a certain skipping lightness in her step . A very tall overgrown school - boy did Norman feel himself for one bashful moment , when he found himself alone with the two ladies ; but he was ready to be set at ease by Mrs. Larpent 's good - natured manner , when she said something of Rollo 's discourtesy . He smiled , and answered that he had made great friends with the fine old dog , and spoke of his running off to the dinner , at which little Miss Rivers laughed , and looked delighted , and began to tell of Rollo 's perfections and intelligence . Norman ventured to inquire the name of the little Italian , and was told it was Nipen , because it had once stolen a cake , much like the wind - spirit in " Feats on the Fiord . " Its beauty and tricks were duly displayed , and a most beautiful Australian parrot was exhibited . Mrs. Larpent taking full interest in the talk , in so lively and gentle a manner , and she and her pretty pupil evidently on such sister - like terms , that Norman could hardly believe her to be the governess , when he thought of Miss Winter . Miss Rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with scissors , and shaping.—'Our holiday work , '
83006	83031	82992	82993	Mrs. Larpent	401	' Meta has been making a drawing for her papa , and is framing it in leather work . Have you ever seen any ? '
83032	83035	83037	83037	Norman	227	' Never ! '
83074	83097	83068	83068	He	227	' I wanted to learn all about it , for I thought it would be such nice work for my eldest sister . '
83131	83137	83114	83115	Mrs. Larpent	401	' Is she the invalid ? '
83138	83141	83143	83143	Norman	227	' Yes , '
83145	83156	83157	83158	Mrs. Larpent	401	' New fancy work is a great gain to her . '
83246	83254	83256	83257	little Meta	402	' How very good she must be , '
83272	83277	83279	83279	Norman	227	' She is indeed , '
83283	83296	83297	83298	Mrs. Larpent	401	' I do n't know what papa would do but for her . '
83353	83356	83379	83379	Meta	402	' Woodstock , '
83512	83573	83497	83497	Meta	402	' said she . No sooner said than done ; the door into the conservatory was opened , and Meta , cutting sprays of beautiful geranium , delicious heliotrope , fragrant calycanthus , deep blue tree violet , and exquisite hothouse ferns ; perfect wonders to Norman , who , at each addition to the bouquet , exclaimed by turns , '
83579	83581	83577	83577	you	402	' and '
83588	83618	83577	83577	you	402	' Her father reached a magnolia blossom from on high , and the quick warm grateful emotion trembled in Dr. May 's features and voice , as he said , '
83643	83737	83637	83637	you	227	' Margaret Rivers cast down her eyes , half smiled , and shrank back , thinking she had never felt anything like the left - handed grasp , so full of warmth and thankfulness . It gave her confidence to venture on the one question on which she was bent . Her father was in the hall , showing Norman his Greek nymph ; and lifting her eyes to Dr. May 's face , then casting them down , she coloured deeper than ever , as she said , in a stammering whisper , '
83756	83770	83771	83771	You	227	' Dr. May answered in his softest , most re - assuring tones : '
83792	83798	83783	83783	You	227	' he added , smiling ; '

83830	83838	83827	83827	you	227	' said Meta , earnestly looking up , '

83974	84008	84010	84010	you	227	' A few words more , and Meta was skipping about like a sprite finding a basket for the flowers — she had another shake of the hand , another grateful smile , and '
84012	84029	84010	84010	you	227	' from the Doctor ; and then , as the carriage disappeared , Mrs. Larpent exclaimed , '

84795	84824	84772	84776	the ladies at the Grange	2285	' tis no mockery now , to tell the poor creatures they want nourishing food . Slices of meat and bottles of port wine rain down on Abbotstoke . '
84869	84889	84891	84892	the Doctor	890	' Ha ! How are you , Wilmot ? So you braved the rain , Ethel . Jump in , '
84899	84916	84891	84892	the Doctor	890	' I shall crowd you — I shall hurt your arm , papa ; thank you . '
84917	84957	84891	84892	the Doctor	890	' No , you won't — jump in — there 's room for three thread - papers in one gig . Why , Wilmot , your brother has a very jewel of a squire ! How did you fare ? '
84958	85051	85052	85052	I	0	' Very well on the whole , was Mr. Wilmot 's answer , while Ethel scrambled in , and tried to make herself small , an art in which she was not very successful ; and Norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning , as she was about to step into the flower- basket ; then she nearly tumbled out again in dismay , and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in , without having done any harm , while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot , as they started , '
85064	85132	85055	85055	You	2292	' That cheerful tone , and the kindness to herself , were a refreshment and revival to Ethel , who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterday 's adventure , and by the sense of her father 's sorrowful displeasure . Expecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly , she did not venture to volunteer anything , and even when he kindly said , '
85142	85154	85135	85135	you	2292	' she only made answer , in a very grave voice , '

85252	85367	85250	85250	papa	7391	' was all Ethel could say ; overpowered by his kindness , and more repressed by what she felt so unmerited , than she would have been by coldness , she said few words , and preferred listening to Norman , who began to describe their adventures at the Grange . All her eagerness revived , however , as she sprung out of the carriage , full of tidings for Margaret ; and it was almost a race between her and Norman to get up - stairs , and unfold their separate budgets . Margaret 's lamp had just been lighted , when they made their entrance , Norman holding the flowers on high . '

Ethel went on with her history . '

85990	86048	85987	85987	she	249	' It is most desirable that something should be done for those poor people , and Richard would never act rashly ; but I have longed for advice whether it was right to promote Ethel 's undertaking . I suppose Richard told you how bent on it she was , long before papa was told of it . '
86049	86068	86069	86069	Margaret	249	' He said it was her great wish , and had been so for a long time past . '

86114	86150	86112	86112	she	249	' and I have felt as if I ought not to hinder her , and yet I did not know whether it was right , at her age , to let her undertake so much . '
86151	86155	86157	86158	Mr. Wilmot	277	' I understand , '
86160	86261	86157	86158	Mr. Wilmot	277	' but , from what I have seen of Ethel , I should think you had decided rightly . There seems to me to be such a spirit of energy in her , that if she does not act , she will either speculate and theorize , or pine and prey on herself . I do believe that hard homely work , such as this school - keeping , is the best outlet for what might otherwise run to extravagance — more especially as you say the hope of it has already been an incentive to improvement in home duties .

86262	86270	86272	86272	Margaret	249	' That I am sure it has , '
86274	86277	86279	86280	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Moreover , '
86282	86350	86279	86280	Mr. Wilmot	277	' I think you were quite right in thinking that to interfere with such a design was unsafe . I do believe that a great deal of harm is done by student friends , who dread to let young people do anything out of the common way , and so force their aspirations to ferment and turn sour , for , want of being put to use . '
86351	86373	86279	86280	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Still girls are told they ought to wait patiently , and not to be eager for self - imposed duties . '
86374	86391	86393	86394	Mr. Wilmot	277	' I am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls themselves , '

86990	87010	86983	86983	I	0	' and here the Doctor returned , talking of Abbotstoke Grange , where he had certainly been much pleased . '

87139	87226	87121	87121	he	262	' Norman had his turn by - and - by . He came up after tea , reporting that papa was fast asleep in his chair , and the others would go on about Cocksmoor till midnight , if they were let alone ; and made up for his previous yielding to Ethel , by giving , with much animation , and some excitement , a glowing description of the Grange , so graphic , that Margaret said she could almost fancy she had been there .

In a large family it must often happen , that since every member of it can not ride the same hobby , nor at the same time , their several steeds must sometimes run counter to each other ; and so Ethel found it , one morning when Miss Winter , having a bad cold , had given her an unwonted holiday . Mr. Wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for Cocksmoor , but this she could not well do without consultation . The multitude bewildered her , she was afraid of taking too many or too few , and the being brought to these practical details made her sensible that though her schemes were very grand and full for future doings , they passed very lightly over the intermediate ground . The '
87501	87620	87332	87332	you	0	' was a period much more developed in her imagination than the future , that the present was flowing into . Where was her coadjutor , Richard ? Writing notes for papa , and not to be disturbed . She had better have waited tranquilly , but this would not suit her impatience , and she ran up to Margaret 's room . There she found a great display of ivy leaves , which Norman , who had been turning half the shops in the town upside down in search of materials , was instructing her to imitate in leather work — a regular mania with him , and apparently the same with Margaret . In came Ethel . '

87738	87742	87745	87745	Norman	227	' said Ethel . '
87772	87788	87766	87767	dear Ethel	300	' Ethel gazed and went away , more put out than was usual with her . '
87799	87803	87804	87804	she	249	' she thought , '
87824	87830	87804	87804	she	249	' She next met Flora . '

87857	87875	87843	87844	Mr. Wilmot	277	' said Flora , turning them over as they lay heaped on the drawing - room sofa ; '
87880	87881	87843	87844	Mr. Wilmot	277	' '
87916	87917	87904	87905	Jane Sparks	413	' '

88016	88417	88425	88425	Ritchie	262	' Ethel could not deny it , and began to deal them out in piles , looking somewhat more fitting , but still felt neglected and aggrieved , at no one being at leisure but Harry , who was not likely to be of any use to her . Presently she heard the study door open , and hoped ; but though it was Richard who entered the room , he was followed by Tom , and each held various books that boded little good to her . Miss Winter had , much to her own satisfaction , been relieved from the charge of Tom , whose lessons Richard had taken upon himself ; and thus Ethel had heard so little about them for a long time past , that even in her vexation and desire to have them over , she listened with interest , desirous to judge what sort of place Tom might be likely to take in school . She did not perceive that this made Richard nervous and uneasy . He had a great dislike to spectators of Latin lessons ; he never had forgotten an unlucky occasion , some years back , when his father was examining him in the Georgics , and he , dull by nature , and duller by confusion and timidity , had gone on rendering word for word — enim for , seges a crop , lini of mud , urit burns , campum the field , avenæ a crop of pipe , urit burns it , when Norman and Ethel had first warned him of the beauty of his translation by an explosion of laughing , when his father had shut the book with a bounce , shaken his head in utter despair , and told him to give up all thoughts of doing anything — and when Margaret had cried with vexation . Since that time , he had never been happy when anyone was in earshot of a lesson ; but to - day he had no escape — Harry lay on the rug reading , and Ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa . Tom , however , was bright enough , declined his Greek nouns irreproachably , and construed his Latin so well , that Ethel could not help putting in a word or two of commendation , and auguring the third form . '
88427	88445	88425	88425	Ritchie	262	' said she , coaxingly—'he has said it so well , and I want you so much . '
88446	88454	88456	88456	Richard	298	' I am afraid I must not , '
88475	88494	88495	88495	Tom	238	' but come , Tom , you sha n't have many words , if you really know them . '
88516	88526	88495	88495	Tom	238	' Very well , only two more — affuit ? '
88527	88546	88549	88549	Tom	238	' Third person singular , præter perfect tense of the verb affo , affis , affui , affere , '
88583	88592	88594	88594	he	298	' Did you find that in the dictionary , '
88596	88604	88594	88594	he	298	' I thought affui came from adsum . '
88605	88621	88623	88623	Tom	238	' O to be sure , stupid fool of a word , so it does ! '
88627	88640	88641	88641	Richard	298	' I had forgot — adsum , ades , affui , adesse . '
88652	88655	88641	88641	Richard	298	' Adjective . '
88683	88688	88690	88690	she	300	' it was objected , '
88739	88743	88717	88717	he	298	' From oppositor . '

88791	88801	88803	88803	Richard	298	' No , now , Tom , pay attention , '
88807	88822	88803	88803	Richard	298	' If you found out its meaning , you must have seen its derivation . '
88823	88826	88828	88828	Tom	238	' Oppositus , '
88868	88877	88859	88859	he	238	' why , oppositus from op - posor . '

88903	88926	88901	88901	Richard	298	' Come , Tom , say at once whether you know it or not — it is of no use to invent . '

88978	88984	88974	88974	he	257	' From op - possum . '

89253	89259	89261	89261	she	300	' Indeed I sha n't , '
89263	89276	89236	89236	Tom	238	' Why do n't you say fairly if you do n't know ? '
89315	89338	89309	89309	Ethel	300	' How did you find out the meaning of that word , Tom , if you did n't look out the verb ? '
89339	89345	89347	89347	Tom	238	' I — don't know , '
89368	89374	89375	89375	she	300	' It is very odd , '
89554	89575	89530	89530	she	300	' Ritchie , I wanted to speak to you about Tom . I am sure he shuffled about those lessons . '
89576	89583	89585	89585	Richard	298	' I am afraid he does , '
89590	89602	89585	89585	Richard	298	' What , do you mean that it is often so ? '
89603	89608	89610	89610	Richard	298	' Much too often , '
89612	89644	89610	89610	Richard	298	' but I have never been able to detect him ; he is very sharp , and has some underhand way of preparing his lessons that I can not make out . '
89645	89653	89655	89655	Ethel	300	' Did you know it , Margaret ? '
89670	89673	89675	89675	Margaret	249	' Yes , '
89677	89697	89675	89675	Margaret	249	' Ritchie and I have often talked it over , and tried to think what was to be done . '
89698	89716	89610	89610	Richard	298	' Dear me ! why do n't you tell papa ? It is such a terrible thing ! '
89717	89722	89724	89724	Margaret	249	' So it is , '
89726	89754	89724	89724	Margaret	249	' but we have nothing positive or tangible to accuse Tom of ; we do n't know what he does , and have never caught him out . '
89755	89801	89610	89610	Richard	298	' I am sure he must have found out the meaning of that oppositum in some wrong way — if he had looked it out , he would only have found opposite . Nothing but opponor could have shown him the rendering which he made . '
89802	89814	89816	89816	Richard	298	' That 's like what I have said almost every day , '
89818	89831	89816	89816	Richard	298	' but there we are — I ca n't get any further . '
89832	89840	89842	89842	Margaret	249	' Perhaps he guesses by the context , '
89844	89854	89857	89859	the Latin scholars	2357	' It would be impossible to do so always , '
89863	89878	89880	89880	Ethel	300	' Well , I ca n't think how you can take it so quietly , '
89882	89913	89914	89914	Ethel	300	' I would have told papa the first moment , and put a stop to it . I have a great mind to do so , if you wo n't . '
89923	89927	89916	89916	Ethel	300	' exclaimed Margaret , '
89944	89945	89942	89942	Tom	238	' '
89952	89956	89942	89942	Tom	238	' said Ethel . '
89969	89973	89957	89957	You	300	' said Richard . '
89979	89995	89996	89996	I	0	' cried Ethel , who thought she knew pretty well what his sharp words were . '
89997	90023	89942	89942	Tom	238	'm sure papa never was angry with me , without making me love him more , and , at least , want to be better . '
90024	90030	90032	90032	Richard	298	' You are a girl , '
90034	90046	90048	90048	Margaret	249	' You are higher spirited , and shake off things faster , '
90050	90063	90048	90048	Margaret	249	' Why , what do you think he would do to Tom ? '
90064	90092	90094	90094	Richard	298	' I think he would be so very angry , that Tom , who , you know , is timid and meek , would be dreadfully frightened , '
90096	90112	90094	90094	Richard	298	' That 's just what he ought to be , frightened out of these tricks . '
90113	90126	90128	90128	Richard	298	' I am afraid it would frighten him into them still more , '
90130	90152	90128	90128	Richard	298	' and perhaps give him such a dread of my father as would prevent him from ever being open with him . '
90153	90164	90166	90166	Margaret	249	' Besides , it would make papa so very unhappy , '
90168	90238	90166	90166	Margaret	249	' Of course , if poor dear Tom had been found out in any positive deceit , we ought to mention it at once , and let him be punished ; but while it is all vague suspicion , and of what papa has such a horror of , it would only grieve him , and make him constantly anxious , without , perhaps , doing Tom any good . '
90239	90247	90249	90249	Ethel	300	' I think all that is expediency , '
90258	90261	90263	90263	Richard	298	' Besides , '
90265	90322	90263	90263	Richard	298	' we have nothing positive to accuse him of , and if we had , it would be of no use . He will be at school in three weeks , and there he would be sure to shirk , even if he left it off here . Everyone does , and thinks nothing of it . '
90323	90326	90328	90329	both sisters	8040	' Richard ! '
90333	90338	90328	90329	both sisters	8040	' You never did ? '
90339	90371	90263	90263	Richard	298	' No , we did n't , but most others do , and not bad fellows either . It is not the way of boys to think much of those things . '
90372	90385	90387	90387	Ethel	300	' It is mean — it is dishonourable — it is deceitful ! '
90389	90411	90413	90413	Richard	298	' I know it is very wrong , but you 'll never get the general run of boys to think so , '
90415	90434	90436	90436	Ethel	300	' Then Tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against it , '
90444	90448	90449	90449	He	2359	' said Richard . '
90463	90464	90465	90465	I	0	' '
90471	90475	90465	90465	I	0	' said Margaret , '
90490	90491	90488	90488	papa	7391	' '
90494	90498	90488	90488	papa	7391	' said Ethel , '
90544	90574	90542	90542	himself	238	' With which words , as Flora entered , Ethel marched out of the room in displeasure , and went down , resolved to settle Jane Sparks by herself . '
90584	90588	90575	90575	Ethel	300	' said Flora . '
90594	90595	90596	90596	We	2362	' '
90602	90606	90607	90607	She	300	' said Margaret . '
90644	90645	90646	90646	I	0	' '
90655	90659	90668	90668	Papa	218	' cried Flora ; '
90708	90716	90718	90718	Margaret	249	' And never have any comfort again , '
90720	90763	90718	90718	Margaret	249	' He would always dread that Tom was deceiving him , and then think it was all for want of — O no , it will never do to speak of it , unless we find out some positive piece of misbehaviour . '
90764	90767	90769	90769	Flora	346	' Certainly , '
90771	90786	90788	90788	Richard	298	' And it would do Tom no good to make him afraid of papa , '
90790	90799	90801	90801	Margaret	249	' Ethel 's rule is right in principle , '
90907	91484	90899	90899	I	0	' Richard and Flora agreed with her , admiring the spirit which made her , in her weakness and helplessness , bear the whole burthen of family cares alone , and devote herself entirely to spare her father . He was , indeed , her first object , and she would have sacrificed anything to give him ease of mind ; but , perhaps , she regarded him more as a charge of her own , than as , in very truth , the head of the family . She had the government in her hands , and had never been used to see him exercise it much in detail ( she did not know how much her mother had referred to him in private ) , and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him . It was no wonder that she sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly right , and forgot that he was the real authority , more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him away , and his sound judgment was not certain to come into play at the first moment , so that it required some moral courage to excite displeasure , so easy of manifestation ; and of such courage there was , perhaps , a deficiency in her character . Nor had she yet detected her own satisfaction in being the first with everyone in the family . Ethel was put out , as Flora had discovered , and when she was down stairs she found it out , and accused herself of having been cross to Margaret , and unkind to Tom — of wishing to be a tell - tale . But still , though displeased with herself , she was dissatisfied with Margaret ; it might be right , but it did not agree with her notions . She wanted to see everyone uncompromising , as girls of fifteen generally do ; she had an intense disgust and loathing of underhand ways , could not bear to think of Tom 's carrying them on , and going to a place of temptation with them uncorrected ; and she looked up to her father with the reverence and enthusiasm of one like minded . She was vexed on another score . Norman came home from Abbotstoke Grange without having seen Miss Rivers , but with a fresh basket of choice flowers , rapturous descriptions of Mr. River 's prints , and a present of an engraving , in shading , such as to give the effect of a cast , of a very fine head of Alexander . Nothing was to be thought of but a frame for this — olive , bay , laurel , everything appropriate to the conqueror . Margaret and Norman were engrossed in the subject , and , to Ethel , who had no toleration for fancy work , who expected everything to be either useful or intellectual , this seemed very frivolous . She heard her father say how glad he was to see Norman interested and occupied , and certainly , though it was only in leather leaves , it was better than drooping and attending to nothing . She knew , too , that Margaret did it for his sake , but , said Ethel to herself , '
91514	91995	91512	91512	Norman	227	' Then came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the neglect of herself ; she called it all selfishness , and felt that she had had an uncomfortable , unsatisfactory day , with everything going wrong . R. M. Milnes . Three great events signalized the month of January . The first was , the opening of the school at Cocksmoor , whither a cart transported half - a - dozen forms , various books , and three dozen plumbuns , Margaret 's contribution , in order that the school might begin with éclat . There walked Mr. Wilmot , Richard , and Flora , with Mary , in a jumping capering state of delight , and Ethel , not knowing whether she rejoiced . She kept apart from the rest , and hardly spoke , for this long probation had impressed her with a sense of responsibility , and she knew that it was a great work to which she had set her hand — a work in which she must persevere , and in which she could not succeed in her own strength . She took hold of Flora 's hand , and squeezed it hard , in a fit of shyness , when they came upon the hamlet , and saw the children watching for them ; and when they reached the house , she would fain have shrank into nothing ; there was a swelling of heart that seemed to ovewhelm and stifle her , and the effect of which was to keep her standing unhelpful , when the others were busy bringing in the benches and settling the room . It was a tidy room , but it seemed very small when they ranged the benches , and opened the door to the seven - and - twenty children , and the four or five women who stood waiting . Ethel felt some dismay when they all came pushing in , without order or civility , and would have been utterly at a loss what to do with her scholars now she had got them , if Richard and Flora had not marshalled them to the benches . Rough heads , torn garments , staring vacant eyes , and mouths gaping in shy rudeness — it was a sight to disenchant her of visions of pleasure in the work she had set herself . It was well that she had not to take the initiative . Mr. Wilmot said a few simple words to the mothers about the wish to teach their children what was right , and to do the best at present practicable ; and then told the children that he hoped they would take pains to be good , and mind what they were taught . Then he desired all to kneel down ; he said the Collect , '
92007	92192	92193	92193	Matthew	293	' and then the Lord 's Prayer . Ethel felt as if she could bear it better , and was more up to the work after this . Next , the children were desired to stand round the room , and Mr. Wilmot tried who could say the Catechism — the two biggest , a boy and a girl , had not an idea of it , and the boy looked foolish , and grinned at being asked what was his name . One child was tolerably perfect , and about half - a - dozen had some dim notions . Three were entirely ignorant of the Lord 's Prayer , and many of the others did not by any means pronounce the words of it . Jane and Fanny Taylor , Rebekah Watts , and Mrs. Green 's little boy , were the only ones who , by their own account , used morning and evening prayers , though , on further examination , it appeared that Polly and Jenny Hall , and some others , were accustomed to repeat the old rhyme about '
92202	92228	92200	92200	John	274	' and Una M'Carthy and her little brother Fergus said something that nobody could make out , but which Mr. Wilmot thought had once been an '
92232	92375	92376	92377	Margaret Fletcher	249	' Some few of the children could read , and several more knew their letters . The least ignorant were selected to form a first - class , and Mr. Wilmot promised a Prayer - book to the first who should be able to repeat the Catechism without a mistake , and a Bible to the first who could read a chapter in it . Then followed a setting of tasks , varying from a verse of a Psalm , or the first answer in the Catechism , down to the distinction between A , B , and C ; all to be ready by next Tuesday , when , weather permitting , a second lesson was to be given . Afterwards , a piece of advice of Margaret 's was followed , and Flora read aloud to the assembly the story of '
92379	92477	92479	92479	you	2375	' To some this seemed to give great satisfaction , especially to Una , but Ethel was surprised to see that many , and those not only little ones , talked and yawned . They had no power of attention even to a story , and the stillness was irksome to such wild colts . It was plain that it was time to leave off , and there was no capacity there which did not find the conclusion agreeable , when the basket was opened , and Ethel and Mary distributed the buns , with instructions to say '
92481	93057	92479	92479	you	2375	' The next Tuesday , some of the lessons were learnt , Una 's perfectly ; the big ignorant boy came no more ; and some of the children had learnt to behave better , while others behaved worse ; Ethel began to know what she was about ; Richard 's gentleness was eminently successful with the little girls , impressing good manners on them in a marvellous way ; and Mary 's importance and happiness with alphabet scholars , some bigger than herself , were edifying . Cocksmoor was fairly launched . The next memorable day was that of Margaret 's being first carried down - stairs . She had been willing to put it off as long as she could , dreading to witness the change below - stairs , and feeling , too , that in entering on the family room , without power of leaving it , she was losing all quiet and solitude , as well as giving up that monopoly of her father in his evenings , which had been her great privilege . However , she tried to talk herself into liking it ; and was rewarded by the happy commotion it caused , though Dr. May was in a state of excitement and nervousness at the prospect of seeing her on the stairs , and his attempts to conceal it only made it worse , till Margaret knew she should be nervous herself , and wished him out of sight and out of the house till it was over , for without him she had full confidence in the coolness and steadiness of Richard , and by him it was safely and quietly accomplished . She was landed on the sofa , Richard and Flora settling her , and the others crowding round and exclaiming , while the newness of the scene and the change gave her a sense of confusion , and she shut her eyes to recover her thoughts , but opened them the next instant at her father 's exclamation that she was overcome , smiled to reassure him , and declared herself not tired , and to be very glad to be among them again . But the bustle was oppressive , and her cheerful manner was an effort ; she longed to see them all gone , and Flora found it out , sent the children for their walk , and carried off Ethel and the brothers . Dr. May was called out of the room at the same time , and she was left alone . She gazed round her , at the room where , four months before , she had seen her mother with the babe in her arms , the children clustered round her , her father exulting in his hen - and - chicken daisies , herself full of bright undefined hope , radiant with health and activity , and her one trouble such that she now knew the force of her mother 's words , that it only proved her happiness . It was not till that moment that Margaret realized the change ; she found her eyes filling with tears , as she looked round , and saw the familiar furniture and ornaments . They were instantly checked as she heard her father returning , but not so that he did not perceive them , and exclaim that it had been too much for her . '
93068	93135	92479	92479	you	2375	' said Margaret , losing the sense of the painful vacancy in her absorbing desire not to distress her father , and thinking only of him as she watched him standing for some minutes leaning on the mantel - shelf , with his hand shading his forehead . She began to speak as soon as she thought he was ready to have his mind turned away : '
93162	93163	93164	93164	I	0	' '
93165	93170	93172	93173	Dr. May	238	'm glad of it , '
93175	93186	93188	93188	he	262	' I am sure the change is better for you ; '
93199	93208	93209	93209	she	2376	' Ritchie can take excellent care of me , '
93219	93236	93209	93209	she	2376	' You see it will do very well indeed for you to take Harry to school . '
93237	93260	93262	93263	the Doctor	890	' I should like to do so . I should like to see his master , and to take Norman with me , '
93265	93299	93262	93263	the Doctor	890	' It would be just the thing for him now — we would show him the dockyard , and all those matters , and such a thorough holiday would set him up again . '
93300	93307	93209	93209	she	2376	' He is very much better . '
93308	93358	93209	93209	she	2376	' Much better — he is recovering spirits and tone very fast . That leaf - work of yours came at a lucky time . I like to see him looking out for a curious fern in the hedge - rows — the pursuit has quite brightened him up . '
93359	93367	93369	93369	Margaret	249	' And he does it so thoroughly , '
93371	93434	93369	93369	Margaret	249	' Ethel fancies it is rather frivolous of him , I believe ; but it amuses me to see how men give dignity to what women make trifling . He will know everything about the leaves , hunts up my botany books , and has taught me a hundred times more of the construction and wonders of them than I ever learnt . '
93435	93438	93440	93441	the Doctor	890	' Aye , '
93443	93508	93440	93441	the Doctor	890	' he has been talking a good deal to me about vegetable chemistry . He would make a good scientific botanist , if he were to be nothing else . I should be glad if he sticks to it as a pursuit—'tis pretty work , and I should like to have gone further with it , if I had ever had time for it . '
93509	93516	93518	93518	Margaret	249	' I dare say he will , '
93520	93559	93518	93518	Margaret	249	' It will be very pleasant if he can go with you . How he would enjoy the British Museum , if there was time for him to see it ! Have you said anything to him yet ? '
93560	93578	93440	93441	the Doctor	890	' No ; I waited to see how you were , as it all depends on that . '
93579	93604	93440	93441	the Doctor	890	' I think it depends still more on something else ; whether Norman is as fit to take care of you as Richard is . '
93605	93675	93440	93441	the Doctor	890	' That 's another point . There 's nothing but what he could manage now , but I do n't like saying anything to him . I know he would undertake anything I wished , without a word , and then , perhaps , dwell on it in fancy , and force himself , till it would turn to a perfect misery , and upset his nerves again . I 'm
93726	93727	93714	93714	he	2379	' '
93739	93740	93731	93731	he	2379	' '
93745	93754	93731	93731	he	2379	' said Dr. May , with strong emotion . '
93870	94095	94098	94099	his father	7526	' This consultation revived the spirits of both ; and the others returning , found Margaret quite disposed for companionship . If to her the evening was sad and strange , like a visit in a dream to some old familiar haunt , finding all unnatural , to the rest it was delightful . The room was no longer dreary , now that there was a centre for care and attentions , and the party was no longer broken up — the sense of comfort , cheerfulness , and home - gathering had returned , and the pleasant evening household gossip went round the table almost as it used to do . Dr. May resumed his old habit of skimming a club book , and imparting the cream to the listeners ; and Flora gave them some music , a great treat to Margaret , who had long only heard its distant sounds . Margaret found an opportunity of talking to Norman , and judged favourably . He was much pleased at the prospect of the journey , and of seeing a ship , so as to have a clearer notion of the scene where Harry 's life was to be spent , and though the charge of the arm was a drawback , he did not treat it as insurmountable . A few days '
94249	94254	94256	94257	the Doctor	890	' Aye , Ritchie , '
94273	94313	94260	94260	he	890	' you may well look grave upon it . You wo n't see it look so tidy when it comes back again , and I believe you are thinking it will be lucky if you see it at all . '
94345	94353	94323	94323	Harry	257	' lugging off his figure - head , '
94642	94646	94649	94649	he	7391	' each day . '
94652	94720	94649	94649	he	7391	' Ethel asked ; and was told pretty much the same as when he went away ; and , on a further query from Flora , it appeared that an old naval friend of his father 's had hopes of a ship , and had promised to have him with him , and thereupon warm hopes were expressed that Harry might have a berth in the same . '
94731	94735	94729	94729	papa	7391	' said Ethel . '
94756	94812	94745	94745	I	0	' When they went up at night , everyone felt that half the say had not been said , and there were fresh beginnings on the stairs . Norman triumphantly gave the key to Richard , and then called to Ethel : I say , wo n't you come into my room while I unpack ? '
94813	94824	94825	94825	Ethel	300	' O yes , I should like it very much . '
94849	94879	94838	94838	Norman	227	' Well , Ethel , papa says I may get to my Euripides to - morrow , if I please , and only work an hour at a time ! '
94880	94894	94745	94745	I	0	' O I am so glad . Then he thinks you quite well ? '
94895	94911	94745	94745	I	0	' Yes , I am quite well . I hope I 've done with nonsense . '
94912	94923	94745	94745	I	0	' And how did you get on with his arm ? '
94924	94968	94745	94745	I	0	' Very well — he was so patient , and told me how to manage . You heard that Sir Matthew said it had got much better in these few weeks . O here it is ! There 's a present for you . '
94969	94982	94745	94745	I	0	' O , thank you . From you , or from papa ? '
94983	95019	94745	94745	I	0	' This is mine . Papa has a present for everyone in his bag . He said , at last , that a man with eleven children had n't need go to London very often . '
95020	95076	94745	94745	I	0	' And you got this beautiful Lyra Innocentium for me . How very kind of you , Norman . It is just what I wished for . Such lovely binding — and those embossed edges to the leaves . Oh ! they make a pattern as they open ! I never saw anything like it . '
95077	95108	94745	94745	I	0	' I saw such a one on Miss Rivers 's table , and asked Ernescliffe where to get one like it . See here 's what my father gave me . '
95109	95123	94745	94745	I	0	' Bishop Ken 's Manual . That is in readiness for the Confirmation . '
95124	95173	94745	94745	I	0	' Look . I begged him to put my name , though he said it was a pity to do it with his left hand ; I did n't like to wait , so I asked him at least to write N. W. May , and the date . '
95174	95193	95194	95194	She	2415	' And he has added Prov . xxiii . 24 , 25 . Let me look it out . '
95212	95220	95207	95207	Norman	227	' How it ought to make one — '
95233	95235	95223	95223	Norman	227	' I 'm
95242	95248	95237	95237	he	227	' said Ethel , presently . '
95257	95290	95252	95252	you	227	' A silence while brother and sister both gazed intently at the crooked characters , till at last Ethel , with a long breath , resumed her ordinary tone , and said , '
95304	95305	95293	95293	he	227	' '
95325	95326	95330	95330	he	227	' '

95340	95360	95335	95335	you	227	' said Norman , as he knelt on the floor , and tumbled miscellaneous articles out of his bag , '

95384	95391	95375	95375	papa	7391	' cried Ethel , starting up . '

96810	96949	96808	96808	Ethel	300	' Aye !

It makes my heart ache to think of it , come what may , as far as I can see , and without her to judge . The only comfort is , that poor Margaret herself knows nothing of it , and is at peace so far . It will be ordered for them , anyhow . Good night , my dear . '

98109	98143	98144	98144	I	0	' Little Meta having told her story , and received plenty of sympathy , proceeded to dress , and , while her maid braided her hair , a musing fit fell upon her . '

98701	99691	99692	99692	I	0	' But little Meta watched in vain . Dr. May always came with either Richard or the groom , to drive him , and if Meta met him and hoped he would bring Flora next time , he only answered that Flora would like it very much , and he hoped soon to do so . The truth was , it was no such every day matter as Meta imagined . The larger carriage had been broken , and the only vehicle held only the doctor — his charioteer — and in a very minute appendage behind , a small son of the gardener , to open gates , and hold the horse . The proposal had been one of those general invitations to be fulfilled at any time , and therefore easily set aside ; and Dr. May , though continually thinking he should like to take his girls to Abbotstoke , never saw the definite time for so doing ; and Flora herself , though charmed with Miss Rivers , and delighted with the prospect of visiting her , only viewed it as a distant prospect . There was plenty of immediate interest to occupy them at home , to say nothing of the increasing employment that Cocksmoor gave to thoughts , legs , and needles . There was the commencement of the half - year , when Tom 's school - boy life was to begin , and when it would be proved whether Norman were able to retain his elevation . Margaret had much anxiety respecting the little boy about to be sent into a scene of temptation . Her great confidence was in Richard , who told her that boys did many more wrong things than were known at home , and yet turned out very well , and that Tom would be sure to right himself in the end . Richard had been blameless in his whole school course , but though never partaking of the other boy 's evil practices , he could not form an independent estimate of character , and his tone had been a little hurt , by sharing the school public opinion of morality . He thought Stoneborough , and its temptations , inevitable , and only wished to make the best of it . Margaret was afraid to harass her father , by laying the case before him . All her brothers had gone safely through the school , and it never occurred to her that it was possible that , if her father knew the bias of Tom 's disposition , he might choose , for the present ; at least , some other mode of education . She talked earnestly to Tom , and he listened impatiently . There is an age when boys rebel against female rule , and are not yet softened by the chivalry of manhood , and Tom was at this time of life . He did not like to be lectured by a sister , secretly disputed her right , and , proud of becoming a schoolboy , had not the generous deference for her weakness felt by his elder brothers ; he was all the time peeling a stick , as if to show that he was not attending , and he raised up his shoulder pettishly whenever she came to a mention of the religious duty of sincerity . She did not long continue her advice , and , much disappointed and concerned , tried to console herself with hoping that he might have heeded more than he seemed to do . He was placed tolerably high in the school , and Norman , who had the first choice of fags , took him instead of Hector Ernescliffe , who had just passed beyond the part of the school liable to be fagged . He said he liked school , looked bright when he came home in the evenings , and the sisters hoped all was right . Everyone was just now anxiously watching Norman , especially his father , who strove in vain to keep back all manifestation of his earnest desire to see him retain his post . Resolutely did the Doctor refrain from asking any questions when the boys came in , but he could not keep his eyes from studying the face , to see whether it bore marks of mental fatigue , and from following him about the room , to discover whether he found it necessary , as he had done last autumn , to spend the evening in study . It was no small pleasure to see him come in with his hand full of horse - chesnut and hazel - buds , and proceed to fetch the microscope and botany books , throwing himself eagerly into the study of the wonders of their infant forms , searching deeply into them with Margaret , and talking them over with his father , who was very glad to promote the pursuit — one in which he had always taken great interest . Another night Dr. May was for a moment disturbed by seeing the school - books put out , but Norman had only some notes to compare , and while he did so , he was remarking on Flora 's music , and joining in the conversation so freely as to prove it was no labour to him . In truth , he was evidently quite recovered , entirely himself again , except that he was less boyish . He had been very lively and full of merry nonsense ; but his ardour for play had gone off with his high spirits , and there was a manliness of manner , and tone of mind , that made him appear above his real age . At the end of a fortnight he volunteered to tell his father that all was right . '

100699	100710	100712	100713	the governess	791	' I wished to speak to you about deal Ethel , '
100715	100742	100712	100713	the governess	791	' you know how unwilling I always am to make any complaint , but I can not be satisfied with her present way of going on . '
100743	100746	100748	100748	Margaret	249	' Indeed , '
100750	100770	100748	100748	Margaret	249	' I am much grieved to hear this . I thought she had been taking great pains to improve . '
100771	100820	100821	100821	Margaret	249	' So she was at one time . I would not by any means wish to deny it , and it is not of her learning that I speak , but of a hurried , careless way of doing everything , and an irritability at being interfered with . '
100842	100851	100852	100852	she	214	' Ethel 's time is so fully occupied , '
100855	100894	100852	100852	she	214	' That is the very thing that I was going to observe , my dear . Her time is too much occupied , and my conviction is , that it is hurtful to a girl of her age . '
100932	100940	100942	100943	Miss Winter	214	' You see there is that Cocksmoor , '
100945	100976	100942	100943	Miss Winter	214	' You do not know how far off it is , my dear ; much too great a distance for a young girl to be walking continually in all weathers . '
100977	100985	100987	100987	Margaret	249	' That 's a question for papa , '
100989	100992	100994	100995	Miss Winter	214	' Besides , '
100997	101052	101053	101053	Margaret	249	' those children engross almost all her time and thoughts . She is working for them , preparing lessons , running after them continually . It takes off her whole mind from her proper occupations , unsettles her , and I do think it is beyond what befits a young lady of her age . '
101057	101061	101063	101064	Miss Winter	214	' In addition , '
101066	101103	101063	101064	Miss Winter	214	' she is at every spare moment busy with Latin and Greek , and I can not think that to keep pace with a boy of Norman 's age and ability can be desirable for her . '
101104	101111	101113	101113	Margaret	249	' It is a great deal , '
101115	101118	101113	101113	Margaret	249	' but — '
101119	101131	101133	101134	Miss Winter	214	' I am convinced that she does more than is right , '
101136	101205	101133	101134	Miss Winter	214	' She may not feel any ill effects at present , but you may depend upon it , it will tell on her by - and - by . Besides , she does not attend to anything properly . At one time she was improving in neatness and orderly habits . Now , you surely must have seen how much less tidy her hair and dress have been . '
101206	101216	101218	101218	Margaret	249	' I have thought her hair looking rather rough , '
101222	101226	101228	101229	Miss Winter	214	' No wonder , '
101231	101335	101228	101229	Miss Winter	214	' for Flora and Mary tell me she hardly spends five minutes over it in the morning , and with a book before her the whole time . If I send her up to make it fit to be seen , I meet with looks of annoyance . She leaves her books in all parts of the school - room for Marry to put away , and her table drawer is one mass of confusion . Her lessons she does well enough , I own , though what I should call much too fast ; but have you looked at her work lately ? '
101336	101344	101346	101346	Margaret	249	' She does not work very well , '
101382	101393	101395	101396	Miss Winter	214	' She works a great deal worse than little Blanche , '
101398	101442	101395	101396	Miss Winter	214	' and though it may not be the fashion to say so in these days , I consider good needlework far more important than accomplishments . Well , then , Margaret , I should wish you only just to look at her writing . '
102053	102066	102068	102068	Margaret	249	' Wo n't you stay with me a little while , quietly ? '
102070	102080	102068	102068	Margaret	249	' we hardly ever have one of our talks . '
102081	102111	102032	102032	she	249	' I did n't mean to vex you , dear Margaret , I like nothing so well , only we are never alone , and I 've no time . '
102112	102148	102068	102068	Margaret	249	' Pray do spare me a minute , Ethel , for I have something that I must say to you , and I am afraid you wo n't like it — so do listen kindly . '
102149	102152	102154	102154	Ethel	300	' Oh ! '
102156	102191	102068	102068	Margaret	249	' Miss Winter has been talking to you . I know she said she would tell you that she wants me to give up Cocksmoor . You are n't dreaming of it , Margaret ! '
102192	102224	102032	102032	she	249	' Indeed , dear Ethel , I should be very sorry , but one thing I am sure of , that there is something amiss in your way of going on . '
102225	102234	102032	102032	she	249	' Did she show you that horrid exercise ? '
102235	102238	102068	102068	Margaret	249	' Yes . '
102239	102494	102032	102032	she	249	' Well , I know it was baddish writing , but just listen , Margaret . We promised six of the children to print them each a verse of a hymn on a card to learn . Ritchie did three , and then could not go on , for the book , that the others were in , was lost till last evening , and then he was writing for papa . So I thought I would do them before we went to Cocksmoor , and that I should squeeze time out of the morning ; but I got a bit of Sophocles that was so horridly hard , it ate up all my time , and I do n't understand it properly now ; I must get Norman to tell me . And that ran in my head , and made me make a mistake in my sum , and have to begin it again . Then , just as I thought I had saved time over the exercise , comes Miss Winter and tells me I must do it over again , and scolds me , besides , about the ink on my fingers . She would send me up at once to get it off , and I could not find murse and her bottle of stuff for it , so that wasted ever so much more time , and I was so vexed that , really and truly , my hand shook , and I could not write any better . '
102495	102513	102032	102032	she	249	' No , I thought it looked as if you had been in one of your agonies . '
102514	102563	102032	102032	she	249	' And she thought I did it on purpose , and that made me angry , and so we got into a dispute , and away went all the little moment I might have had , and I was forced to go to Cocksmoor as a promise breaker ! '
102564	102578	102032	102032	she	249	' Do n't you think you had better have taken pains at first ? '
102579	102601	102032	102032	she	249	' Well , so I did with the sense , but I had n't time to look at the writing much . '
102602	102613	102032	102032	she	249	' You would have made better speed if you had . '
102614	102644	102032	102032	she	249	' Oh ! yes , I know I was wrong , but it is a great plague altogether . Really , Margaret , I sha n't get Thucydides done . '
102645	102692	102032	102032	she	249	' You must wait a little longer , please , Ethel , for I want to say to you that I am afraid you are doing too much , and that prevents you from doing things well , as you were trying to do last autumn . '
102693	102705	102707	102707	Ethel	300	' You are not thinking of my not going to Cocksmoor ! '
102711	102776	102707	102707	Ethel	300	' I want you to consider what is to be done , dear Ethel . You thought , last autumn , a great deal of curing your careless habits , now you seem not to have time to attend . You can do a great deal very fast , I know , but is n't it a pity to be always in a hurry ? '
102777	102787	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' It is n't Cocksmoor that is the reason , '
102791	102821	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' No : you did pretty well when you began , but you know that was in the holidays , when you had no Latin and Greek to do . '
102822	102927	102032	102032	she	249	' O but , Margaret , they wo n't take so much time when I have once got over the difficulties , and see my way , but just now they have put Norman into such a frightfully difficult play , that I can hardly get on at all with it , and there 's a new kind of Greek verses , too , and I do n't make out from the book how to manage them . Norman showed me on Saturday , but mine wo n't be right . When I 've got over that , I sha n't be so hurried . '
102928	102941	102707	102707	Ethel	300	' But Norman will go on to something harder , I suppose . '
102942	102954	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' I dare say I shall be able to do it . '
102955	103057	102032	102032	she	249	' Perhaps you might , but I want you to consider if you are not working beyond what can be good for anybody . You see Norman is much cleverer than most boys , and you are a year younger ; and besides doing all his work at the head of the school , his whole business of the day , you have Cocksmoor to attend to , and your own lessons , besides reading all the books that come into the house . Now is n't that more than is reasonable to expect any head and hands to do properly ? '
103058	103066	102707	102707	Ethel	300	' But if I can do it ? '
103067	103099	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' But can you , dear Ethel ? Are n't you always racing from one thing to another , doing them by halves , feeling haunted , and then growing vexed ? '
103100	103109	103111	103111	Ethel	300	' I know I have been cross lately , '
103113	103122	103111	103111	Ethel	300	' but it 's the being so bothered . '
103123	103139	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' And why are you bothered ? Is n't it that you undertake too much ? '
103140	103148	103150	103150	Ethel	300	' What would you have me do ? '
103159	103166	103150	103150	Ethel	300	' Not give up my children ? '
103167	103170	103172	103172	Margaret	249	' No , '
103174	103197	103172	103172	Margaret	249	' but do n't think me very unkind if I say , suppose you left off trying to keep up with Norman . '
103198	103205	102789	102789	Ethel	300	' Oh ! Margaret ! Margaret ! '
103213	103234	103172	103172	Margaret	249	' We have hardly missed doing the same every day since the first Latin grammar was put into his hands ! '
103235	103244	103246	103246	Margaret	249	' I know it would be very hard , '
103261	103289	103249	103249	Ethel	300	' From hic hæc hoc up to Alcaics and beta Thukididou we have gone on together , and I ca n't bear to give it up . I 'm

103832	103841	103842	103842	Margaret	249	' Ethel made two or three great gulps : '

103999	104038	103997	103997	he	227	' it must have come to this some time or other , and if you find those verses too hard , and that they take up too much of your time , you had better give them up . '
104076	104141	104073	104073	she	300	' I suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more , in one 's own way , when one is told it is not good for one . I was just going to say I hated being a woman , and having these tiresome little trifles — my duty — instead of learning , which is yours , Norman . '

104218	104398	104197	104197	I	0	' This argument from Norman himself , did much to reconcile Ethel 's mind to the sacrifice she had made ; and when she went to bed , she tried to work out the question in her own mind , whether her eagerness for classical learning was a wrong sort of ambition , to know what other girls did not , and whether it was right to crave for more knowledge than was thought advisable for her . She only bewildered herself , and went to sleep before she had settled anything , but that she knew she must make all give way to papa first , and , secondly , to Cocksmoor . Meanwhile Margaret had told her father what had passed . He was only surprised to hear that Ethel had kept up so long with Norman , and thought that it was quite right that she should not undertake so much , agreeing more entirely than Margaret had expected with Miss Winter 's view , that it would be hurtful to body as well as mind .

The setting sun shone into the great west window of the school at Stoneborough , on its bare walls , the master 's desks , the forms polished with use , and the square , inky , hacked and hewed chests , carved with the names of many generations of boys . About six or eight little boys were clearing away the books or papers that they , or those who owned them as fags , had left astray , and a good deal of talk and laughing was going on among them . '

104882	104926	104869	104874	an old man blowing the bellows	2611	' cried Tom May , precipitating himself across the benches and over the desk , with so little caution , that there was an outcry ; and , to his horror , he beheld the ink spilled over Mr. Harrison 's book , while '

105628	105809	105613	105613	I	0	' Tom shrank and looked abject , clinging to the hope that Mr. Harrison would not open the book for weeks , months , or years . But the next morning , his heart died within him , when he beheld the unfortunate piece of blotting - paper , displayed by Mr. Harrison , with the inquiry whether anyone knew to whom it belonged , and what made it worse was , that his sight would not reach far enough to assure him whether Harry 's name was on it , and he dreaded that Norman or Hector Ernescliffe should recognise the nautical designs . However , both let it pass , and no one through the whole school attempted to identify it . One danger was past , but the next minute Mr. Harrison opened his Smith 's Antiquities at the page where stood the black witness . Tom gazed round in despair , he could not see his brother 's face , but Edward Anderson , from the second form , returned him a glance of contemptuous encouragement . '
105813	105818	105613	105613	I	0	' said Mr. Harrison , '
105852	105860	105846	105846	you	2627	' A silence , and he continued , '

105934	105954	105932	105932	Sir	7572	' said Larkins , boldly , satisfying his conscience because he had not seen the manner of the overthrow . '
105961	105962	105965	105965	Sir	7572	' '
105967	105990	105965	105965	Sir	7572	' Tom 's timid heart fluttered in dim hope that he had been overlooked , as Mr. Harrison paused , then said , '
106031	106039	106024	106025	May junior	9119	' he added , hopefully and kindly . '
106056	106136	106139	106139	Sir	7572	' Tom coloured and turned pale . Anderson and Larkins grimaced at him , to remind him that they had told untruths for his sake , and that he must not betray them . It was the justification he wanted ; he was relieved to fancy himself obliged to tell the direct faslehood , for which a long course of petty acted deceits had paved the way , for he was in deadly terror of the effects of truth . '
106141	106794	106139	106139	Sir	7572	' He could hardly believe he had said the words , or that they would be so readily accepted , for Mr. Harrison had only the impression that he knew who the guilty person was , and would not tell , and , therefore , put no more questions to him , but , after a few more vain inquiries , was baffled , and gave up the investigation . Tom thought he should have been very unhappy ; he had always heard that deceit was a heavy burthen , and would give continual stings , but he was surprised to find himself very comfortable on the whole , and able to dismiss repentance as well as terror . His many underhand ways with Richard had taken away the tenderness of his conscience , though his knowledge of what was right was clear ; and he was quite ready to accept the feeling prevalent at Stoneborough , that truth was not made for school - boys . The axiom was prevalent , but not universal , and parties were running high . Norman May , who , as head boy , had , in play - hours , the responsibility , and almost the authority of a master , had taken higher ground than was usual even with the well - disposed ; and felt it his duty to check abuses and malpractices that his predecessors had allowed . His friend , Cheviot , and the right - minded set , maintained his authority with all their might ; but Harvey Anderson regarded his interference as vexatious , always took the part of the offenders , and opposed him in every possible way , thus gathering as his adherents not only the idle and mischievous , but the weak and mediocre , and , among this set , there was a positive bitterness of feeling to May , and all whom they considered as belonging to him . In shielding Tom May and leading him to deceive , the younger Anderson had gained a conquest — in him the Mays had fallen from that pinnacle of truth which was a standing reproach to the average Stoneborough code — and , from that time , he was under the especial patronage of his friend . He was taught the most ingenious arts of saying a lesson without learning it , and of showing up other people 's tasks ; whispers and signs were directed to him to help him out of difficulties , and he was sought out and put forward whenever a forbidden pleasure was to be enjoyed by stealth . These were his stimulants under a heavy bondage ; he was teased and frightened , bullied and tormented , whenever it was the fancy of Ned Anderson and his associates to make his timidity their sport ; he was scorned and ill - treated , and driven , by bodily terror , into acts alarming to his conscience , dangerous in their consequence , and painful in the perpetration ; and yet , among all his sufferings , the little coward dreaded nothing so much as truth , though it would have set him free at once from this wretched tyranny . Excepting on holidays , and at hours when the town - boys were allowed to go home , there were strict rules confining all except the sixth form to their bounds , consisting of two large courts , and an extensive field bordered by the river and the road . On the opposite side of the bridge was a turnpike gate , where the keeper exposed stalls of various eatables , very popular among the boys , chiefly because they were not allowed to deal there . Ginger - beer could also be procured , and there were suspicions , that the bottles so called , contained something contraband . '
106797	106811	106795	106795	August	436	' said Norman , as they were coming home from school one evening , '
106821	106827	106813	106813	I	0	' Tom would not answer . '

107058	107069	107050	107050	You	2637	' This startled Tom , but Norman had no suspicion . '
107119	107146	107109	107109	him	7391	' Tom would say nothing , only reflecting that his elder brother was harder upon him than anyone else would be , and Norman grew warmer . '

It is my place to keep order , and I ca n't let you off for being my brother ; so remember , if I catch you going to Ballhatchet 's again , you may make sure of a licking . '
107432	107439	107441	107441	Norman	227	' What are you doing here ? '
107451	107466	107441	107441	Norman	227	' So you 've been there again . What 's that under your jacket ? '
107467	107477	107479	107479	he	238	' Only — only what I was sent for , '
107488	107496	107479	107479	he	238	' What is it ? a bottle — '
107497	107506	107507	107507	Norman	227	' Only — only a bottle of ink . '
107527	107553	107554	107554	Tom	238	' O Tom , Tom , these fellows have brought you a pretty pass . Who would have thought of such a thing from us ! '
107562	107566	107568	107568	Norman	227	' Speak truth , '
107578	107585	107568	107568	Norman	227	' is this for Anderson junior ? '
107633	107643	107645	107645	Norman	227	' I am glad it is not for yourself , '
107647	107664	107645	107645	Norman	227	' but do you remember what I said , in case I found you there again . '

107679	107692	107676	107677	the boy	893	' I would never have gone if they had not made me . '
107693	107697	107699	107699	Norman	227	' Made you ? '
107703	107706	107699	107699	Norman	227	' how ? '
107707	107732	107676	107677	the boy	893	' They would have thrashed me — they pinched my fingers in the box — they pulled my ears — Oh , do n't — '

107742	107782	107740	107740	Norman	227	' but it is your own fault . If you wo n't keep with me , or Ernescliffe , of course they will bully you . But I must not let you off — I must keep my word ! '
107793	107800	107801	107801	he	238	' I ca n't help it , '
107804	107839	107801	107801	he	238	' and now , do n't how ! I had rather no one knew it . It will soon be over . I never thought to have this to do to one of us . '
107853	107879	107880	107880	he	238	' There , that will do . Stop bellowing , I was obliged , and I ca n't have hurt you much , have I ? '
107896	107911	107913	107913	he	238	' It is nothing to care about , I am sure , look up ; '
107919	107941	107913	107913	he	238	' Say you are sorry — speak the truth — keep with me , and no one shall hurt you again . '
107980	107997	107998	107998	Norman	227	' I could not help it , Tom , you 've no business to be sulky , '
108026	108046	108023	108023	Tom	238	' O do n't , do n't ! what will they do to me ? give it to me ! '
108047	108059	108023	108023	Tom	238	' Did they give you the money to pay for it ? '
108060	108068	108023	108023	Tom	238	' Yes , let me have it . '
108069	108075	108023	108023	Tom	238	' How much was it ? '
108076	108079	108023	108023	Tom	238	' Fourpence . '
108080	108086	108023	108023	Tom	238	' I 'll settle that , '
108095	108153	108023	108023	Tom	238	' Now then , Tom , do n't brood on it any more . Here 's a chance for you of getting quit of their errands . If you will keep in my sight , I 'll take care no one bullies you , and you may still leave off these disgraceful tricks , and do well . '
108200	108224	108226	108226	Norman	227	' If you will go on in this way , I ca n't help it , but you 'll be sorry some day , '
108301	108305	108307	108307	he	227	' Anderson junior , '
108309	108364	108307	108307	he	227	' there 's your money . I am not going to let Stoneborough school be turned into a gin palace . I give you notice , it is not to be . Now , you are not to bully May junior , for telling me . He did not , I found him out . '
108437	108442	108443	108443	he	437	' Mother ! Mother ! '
108446	108459	108443	108443	he	437	' have I been harsh to your poor little tender sickly boy ? '
108548	108640	108539	108539	you	2663	' Norman covered his face with his hands , and a fit of bitter grief came over him . But his sorrow was now not what it had been before his father 's resignation had tempered it , and soon it turned to prayer , resolution , and hope . He would try again to reason quietly with him , when the alarm of detection and irritation should have gone off , and he sought for the occasion ; but , alas ! Tom had learnt to look on all reproof as '
108643	108770	108539	108539	you	2663	' and considered it as an additional injury from a brother , who , according to the Anderson view , should have connived at his offences , and turned a deafened ear and dogged countenance to all he said . The foolish boy sought after the Andersons still more , and Norman became more dispirited about him , greatly missing Harry , that constant companion and follower , who would have shared his perplexities , and removed half of them , in his own part of the school , by the influence of his high , courageous , and truthful spirit . In the meantime Richard was studying hard at home , with greater hopefulness and vigour than he had ever thrown into his work before . '
108773	108781	108539	108539	you	2663	' Ethel had once said to him , '
108803	108804	108792	108794	Curate of Cocksmoor	2671	' '
108807	109008	108792	108794	Curate of Cocksmoor	2671	' said Richard , smiling at the presumption of the scheme , and yet it formed itself into a sort of definite hope . Perhaps they might persuade Mr. Ramsden to take him as a Curate with a view to Cocksmoor , and this prospect , vague as it was , gave an object and hope to his studies . Everyone thought the delay of his examination favourable to him , and he now read with a determination to succeed . Dr. May had offered to let him read with Mr. Harrison , but Richard thought he was getting on pretty well , with the help Norman gave him ; for it appeared that ever since Norman 's return from London , he had been assisting Richard , who was not above being taught by a younger brother ; while , on the other hand , Norman , much struck by his humility , would not for the world have published that he was fit to act as his elder 's tutor . One evening , when the two boys came in from school , Tom gave a great start , and , pulling Mary by the sleeve , whispered , '
109015	109016	109019	109020	Mr. Harrison	278	' '
109023	109024	109019	109020	Mr. Harrison	278	' '
109036	109037	109038	109038	Richard	298	' '
109052	109085	109047	109047	Ethel	300	' A little re - assured , Tom took up an exciting story - book , and ensconsed himself by the fire , but his agonies were great during the ensuing conversation . '
109088	109095	109047	109047	Ethel	300	' Ethel was exclaiming in delight , '
109102	109103	109104	109104	Smith	406	' '
109115	109116	109104	109104	Smith	406	' '
109164	109165	109173	109174	Mr. Rivers	255	' '
109175	109178	109180	109180	Norman	227	' gems , '
109197	109209	109211	109211	Flora	280	' Oh ! what did I see ? is that ink ? '
109221	109229	109231	109231	Ethel	300	' Yes , did n't you hear ? '
109233	109300	109231	109231	Ethel	300	' Mr. Harrison told Ritchie when he borrowed it , that unluckily one day this spring he left it in school , and some of the boys must have upset an inkstand over it ; but , though he asked them all round , each denied it . How I should hate for such things to happen ! and it was a prize - book too . '
109326	109346	109323	109323	Mary	220	' Dear me ! how funny ! why , how did Harry 's blotting - paper get in there ? '
109402	109417	109397	109397	his	955	' Harry 's blotting - paper ! How do you know that , Mary ? '
109418	109424	109426	109426	she	220	' It is Harry 's , '
109431	109457	109397	109397	his	955	' because of that anchor up in one corner , and the union - jack in the other . Do n't you see , Ethel ? '
109458	109461	109463	109463	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
109465	109472	109463	109463	Ethel	300	' nobody drew that but Harry . '
109473	109482	109484	109484	Mary	220	' Aye , and there are his buttons , '
109498	109562	109484	109484	Mary	220	' Do n't you remember one day last holidays , papa desired Harry to write and ask Mr. Ernescliffe what clothes he ought to have for the naval school , and all the time he was writing the letter , he was drawing sailor 's buttons on his blotting - paper . I wonder how ever it got into Mr. Harrison 's book ! '
109601	109623	109598	109598	she	220	' I know ! Harry gave his paper - case to Tom . That 's the way it got to school ! '
109624	109627	109629	109630	his father	7526	' Tom ! '
109636	109642	109629	109630	his father	7526	' where are you going ? '
109643	109647	109649	109651	the miserable Tom	238	' To bed , '
109722	109738	109711	109711	Flora	280	' Some one might have used the first blotting - paper that came to hand . '
109739	109745	109747	109748	the Doctor	890	' Come here , Tom , '
109769	109775	109763	109763	his	890	' Look in my face . '
109798	109842	109785	109785	his	7526	' Do n't be afraid to tell us the meaning of this . If any of your friends have done it , we will keep your secret . Look up , and speak out . How did your blotting - paper come there ? '
109892	109904	109906	109906	Dr.	238	' I ca n't have you roaring here to distress Margaret , '
109908	109916	109906	109906	Dr.	238	' Come into the study with me . '
110095	110113	110093	110093	Ethel	300	' that , if dear Tom had not done it , she would come and tell her . '
110114	110125	110127	110127	Ethel	300	' I am afraid there is no hope of that ! '
110136	110140	110142	110142	Flora	280	' After all , '
110144	110177	110142	110142	Flora	280	' he has not said anything . If he has only done it , and not confessed , that is not so bad — it is only the usual fashion of boys . '
110178	110189	110191	110191	Ethel	300	' Has he been asked ? Did he deny it ? '
110286	110295	110297	110298	Dr. May.	401	' I have sent him up to bed , '
110299	110317	110297	110298	Dr. May.	401	' I must take him to Harrison to - morrow morning . It is a terrible business ! '
110318	110324	110326	110326	Margaret	249	' Has he confessed it ? '
110328	110365	110326	110326	Margaret	249	' I can hardly call such a thing a confession — I wormed it out bit by bit — I could not tell whether he was telling truth or not , till I called Norman in . '
110366	110376	110391	110391	He	890	' But he has not said anything more untrue — '
110377	110384	110386	110387	Dr. May	238	' Yes , he has though ! '
110456	110457	110436	110436	himself	238	' '
110467	110471	110472	110472	They	2696	' cried Flora . '
110479	110480	110472	110472	They	2696	' '
110494	110498	110484	110484	they	2696	' said Norman . '
110509	110521	110502	110502	you	0	' exclaimed the Doctor , too keenly grieved to be just . '
110570	110597	110598	110598	I	0	' Norman 's colour rose with the extreme pain this unjust accusation caused him , and his voice , though low , was not without irritation . '
110616	110617	110620	110620	I	0	' '
110626	110631	110620	110620	I	0	' interrupted his father . '
110651	110696	110620	110620	I	0	' Here no one could see Norman 's burning cheeks , and brow bent downwards in the effort to keep back an indignant reply , without bursting out in exculpation ; and Richard looked up , while the three sisters all at once began , '
110704	110719	110620	110620	I	0	' and left Margaret to finish—'Poor little Tom had not always been quite sincere . '
110720	110746	110702	110702	papa	7391	' Indeed ! and why was I left to send him to school without knowing it ? The place of all others to foster deceit . '
110747	110755	110757	110757	Margaret	249	' It was my fault , papa , '
110759	110763	110766	110766	Richard	298	' And mine , '
110772	110805	110769	110769	she	249	' Ethel told us we were very wrong , and I wish we had followed her advice . It was by far the best , but we were afraid of vexing you . '
110806	110820	110822	110823	Dr. May	238	' Everyone seems to have been combined to hide what they ought not ! '
110843	110855	110769	110769	she	249	' Pray , how came you not to identify this paper ? '
110856	110863	110865	110865	Norman	227	' I did not know it , '
110871	110882	110884	110885	the Doctor	890	' He ought never to have been sent to school , '
110888	110897	110884	110885	the Doctor	890	' that tendency was the very worst beginning . '
110898	110910	110912	110912	Margaret	249	' It was a great pity ; I was very wrong , '
110918	110930	110932	110933	her father	856	' I did not mean to blame you , my dear , '
110937	110951	110953	110953	he	856	' I know you only meant to act for the best , but — '
111068	111144	111059	111059	Ethel	300	' Well , do you know , I think he will do better now . You see , Edward made him conceal it , and he has been going on with it on his mind , and in that boy 's power ever since ; but now it is cleared up and confessed , he will begin afresh and do better . Do n't you think so , Norman ? do n't you , papa ? '
111145	111162	111164	111165	Dr. May	238	' I should have more hope , if I had seen anything like confession or repentance , '
111167	111194	111164	111165	Dr. May	238	' but that provoked me more than all — I could only perceive that he was sorry to be found out , and afraid of punishment . '
111195	111214	111216	111216	Margaret	249	' Perhaps , when he has recovered the first fright , he will come to his better self , '
111333	111366	111328	111328	Norman	227	' Papa , I am very sorry you should think I neglected Tom . I dare say I might have done better for him , but , indeed , I have tried . '
111367	111408	111322	111322	Richard	298	' I am sure you have , Norman . I spoke hastily , my boy — you will not think more of it . When a thing like this comes on a man , he hardly knows what he says . '
111409	111415	111417	111417	Norman	227	' If Harry were here , '
111442	111483	111417	111417	Norman	227	' it would all do better . He would make a link with Tom , but I have so little , naturally , to do with the second form , that it is not easy to keep him in sight . '
111484	111551	111594	111595	the Doctor	890	' Yes , yes , I know that very well . It is no one 's fault but my own ; I should not have sent him there without knowing him better . But you see how it is , Norman — I have trusted to her , till I have grown neglectful , and it is well if it is not the ruin of him ! '
111552	111564	111566	111566	Norman	227	' Perhaps he will take a turn , as Ethel says , '
111570	111576	111566	111566	Norman	227	' Good night , papa . '
111577	111592	111597	111597	himself	890	' I have a blessing to be thankful for in you , at least , '
111644	111717	111624	111626	a fine father	2713	' Margaret had so bad a head - ache , the next day , that she could not come down stairs . The punishment was , they heard , a flogging at the time , and an imposition so long , that it was likely to occupy a large portion of the play - hours till the end of the half - year . His father said , and Norman silently agreed , '
111731	111820	111624	111626	a fine father	2713	' but Margaret only wished she could learn it for him , and took upon herself all the blame from beginning to end . She said little to her father , for it distressed him to see her grieved ; he desired her not to dwell on the subject , caressed her , called her his comfort and support , and did all he could to console her , but it was beyond his power ; her sisters , by listening to her , only made her worse . '
111826	111830	111624	111626	a fine father	2713	' she exclaimed , '

111860	111866	111845	111845	I	0	' said Richard , quietly . '
111883	111890	111893	111893	I	0	' This took Margaret by surprise . '
111905	111906	111907	111907	I	0	' '
111911	111915	111907	111907	I	0	' said Richard . '
111947	111948	111939	111939	we	2718	' '
111958	111969	111939	111939	we	2718	' said Margaret—'he would not have sent him to school . '
111970	111977	111979	111979	Richard	298	' I do n't know that , '
111981	112065	111979	111979	Richard	298	' At any rate we meant to do right , and only made a mistake . It was unfortunate , but I ca n't tell why you go and make yourself ill , by fancying it worse than it is . The boy has done very wrong , but people get cured of such things in time , and it is nonsense to fret as if he were not a mere child of eight years old . You did not teach him deceit . '
112066	112086	111939	111939	we	2718	' No , but I concealed it — papa is disappointed , when he thought he could trust me . '
112087	112101	112103	112103	Richard	298	' Well ! I suppose no one could expect never to make mistakes , '
112110	112115	112117	112117	Margaret	249	' Self - sufficiency ! '
112119	112146	112117	112117	Margaret	249	' that has been the root of all ! Do you know , Ritchie , I believe I was expecting that I could always judge rightly . '
112147	112152	112154	112154	Richard	298	' You generally do , '
112156	112167	112154	112154	Richard	298	' no one else could do half what you do . '
112168	112195	112117	112117	Margaret	249	' So you have said , papa , and all of you , till you have spoilt me . I have thought it myself , Ritchie . '
112196	112201	112203	112203	Richard	298	' It is true , '
112205	112209	112211	112211	Margaret	249	' But then , '
112213	112283	112211	112211	Margaret	249	' I have grown to think much of it , and not like to be interfered with . I thought I could manage by myself , and when I said I would not worry papa , it was half because I liked the doing and settling all about the children myself . Oh ! if it could have been visited in any way but by poor Tom 's faults ! '
112284	112287	112289	112289	Richard	298	' Well , '
112291	112341	112289	112289	Richard	298	' if you felt so , it was a pity , though I never should have guessed it . But you see you will never feel so again , and as Tom is only one , and there are nine to govern , it is all for the best . '
112360	112388	112355	112355	he	298	' It is a good lesson against my love of being first . But indeed it is difficult — papa can so little bear to be harassed . '
112389	112408	112355	112355	he	298	' He could not at first , but now he is strong and well , it is different . '
112409	112418	112420	112420	Margaret	249	' He looks terribly thin and worn still , '
112422	112427	112420	112420	Margaret	249	' so much older ! '
112428	112453	112355	112355	he	298	' Aye , I think he will never get back his young looks ; but except his weak arm , he is quite well . '
112454	112468	112355	112355	he	298	' And then his — his quick way of speaking may do harm . '
112469	112480	112482	112482	Richard	298	' Yes , that was what I feared for Tom , '
112484	112558	112482	112482	Richard	298	' and there was the mistake . I see it now . My father always is right in the main , though he is apt to frighten one at first , and it is what ought to be , that he should rule his own house . But now , Margaret , it is silly to worry about it any more — let me fetch baby , and do n't think of it . '
112935	112967	112924	112924	she	300	' I do n't want them . Only let me have one for Aubrey , because he is so little . All the rest are for the poor children on Cocksmoor . '

113747	113751	113745	113745	Flora	280	' Good morning . '
113789	113800	113783	113785	Her little sister	2740	' Why , Flora , have you seen the Grange ? '
113801	113811	113813	113813	Blanche	300	' No , but papa and Norman said so . '
113858	113877	113843	113843	Flora	280	' I do n't want it for myself , I want to have pretty things to give away . '
113945	113961	113963	113963	he	2746	' I have had a sight , too , of little maidens preparing Easter gifts , '
113965	113984	113963	113963	he	2746	' Have you , papa ? What were they ? Were they as nice as Miss Rivers 's ? '
113985	114025	113912	113912	She	300	' I do n't know , but I thought they were the best sort of gifts , for I saw that plenty of kind thought and clever contrivance went to them , aye , and some little selfdenial too . '
114026	114046	113912	113912	She	300	' Papa , you look as if you meant something ; but ours are nothing but nasty old rubbish . '
114047	114089	113963	113963	he	2746	' Perhaps some fairy , or something better , has brought a wand to touch the rubbish , Blanche ; for I think that the maidens gave what would have been worthless kept , but became precious as they gave it . '
114090	114111	113912	113912	She	300	' Do you mean the list of our flannel petticoats , papa , that Mary has made into a tippet ? '
114112	114139	113912	113912	She	300	' Perhaps I meant Mary 's own time and pains , as well as the tippet . Would she have done much good with them otherwise ? '
114140	114187	113963	113963	he	2746	' No , she would have played . Oh ! then , you like the presents because they are our own making ? I never thought of that . Was that the reason you did not give us any of your sovereigns to buy things with ? '
114188	114271	113912	113912	She	300	' Perhaps I want my sovereigns for the eleven gaping mouths at home , Blanche . But would not it be a pity to spoil your pleasure ? You would have lost all the chattering and laughing and buzzing I have heard round Margaret of late , and I am quite sure Miss Rivers can hardly be as happy in the gifts that cost her nothing , as one little girl who gives her sugar - plums out of her own mouth ! '
114287	114296	114298	114298	she	300	' They are our presents , not yours , '
114300	114312	114298	114298	she	300	' Yes , I see . I like them better now . '
114313	114318	114320	114321	the Doctor	890	' Aye , aye , '
114323	114365	114320	114321	the Doctor	890	' Seeing Miss Rivers 's must not take the shine out of yours , my little maids ; for if you ca n't give much , you have the pleasure of giving the best of all , your labour of love . '
114375	114408	114320	114321	the Doctor	890	' The longer I live , the more I see the blessing of being born in a state of life where you ca n't both eat your cake and give it away . '
114442	114452	114435	114435	She	280	' You would not have Blanche underrate Miss Rivers ? '
114453	114519	114320	114321	the Doctor	890	' No , indeed , she is as good and sweet a creature as ever came across me — most kind to Margaret , and loving to all the world . I like to see one whom care and grief have never set their grip upon . Most likely she would do like Ethel , if she had the opportunity , but she has not . '
114520	114529	114531	114531	Flora	280	' So she has not the same merit ? '
114533	114607	114531	114531	Flora	280	' We do n't talk of merit . I meant that the power of sacrifice is a great advantage . The habit of small sacrifice that is made necessary in a large family is a discipline that only - children are without ; and so , with regard to wealth , I think people are to be pitied who can give extensively out of such abundance that they can hardly feel the want . '
114608	114618	114620	114620	Flora	280	' In effect , they can do much more , '
114622	114730	114620	114620	Flora	280	' I am not sure of that . They can , of course , but it must be at the cost of personal labour and sacrifice . I have often thought of the words , " Silver and gold have I none , but such as I have give I thee . " And such as we have it is that does the good ; the gold , if we have it , but , at any rate , the personal influence ; the very proof of sincerity , shown by the exertion and selfdenial , tells far more than money lightly come by , lightly spent . '
114731	114754	114531	114531	Flora	280	' Do you mean that a person who maintained a whole school would do less good than one who taught one child ? '
114755	114828	114620	114620	Flora	280	' If the rich person take no pains , and leave the school to take care of itself — nay , if he only visit it now and then , and never let it inconvenience him , has he the least security that the scholars are obtaining any real good from it ? If the teacher of the one child is doing his utmost , he is working for himself at least . '
114829	114852	114620	114620	Flora	280	' Suppose we could build , say our Church and school , on Cocksmoor at once , and give our superintendence besides ? '
114853	114934	114620	114620	Flora	280	' If things were ripe for it , the means would come . As it is , it is a fine field for Ethel and Richard . I believe it will be the making of them both . I am sure it is training Ethel , or making her train herself , as we could never have done without it . But here , come in and see old Mrs. Robins . A visit from you will cheer her up . '
115053	115060	115076	115076	his	7854	' It was just like papa , '
115164	115234	115156	115156	her	300	' that it was so nice ; and now she did not care about Miss Rivers 's fine presents at all , for papa said what one made one 's self was better to give than what one bought . And papa said , too , that it was a good thing not to be rich , for then one never felt the miss of what one gave away . '
115304	115307	115309	115310	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Yes , '
115312	115400	115309	115310	Mr. Wilmot	277	' those Riverses are open - handed . They really seem to have so much money , that they do n't know what to do with it . My brother is ready to complain that they spoil his parish . It is all meant so well , and they are so kind - hearted and excellent , that it is a shame to find fault , and I tell Charles and his wife that their grumbling at such a squire proves them the most spoilt of all . '
115401	115405	115407	115408	the Doctor	890	' Indiscriminate liberality ? '
115410	115422	115407	115408	the Doctor	890	' I should guess the old gentleman to be rather soft ! '
115423	115497	115309	115310	Mr. Wilmot	277	' That 's one thing . The parish is so small , and there are so few to shower all this bounty on , and they are so utterly unused to country people . They seem to think by laying out money they can get a show set of peasants in rustic cottages , just as they have their fancy cows and poultry — all that offends the eye out of the way . '

115898	115988	115991	115991	you	2774	' Flora felt as if her father must be thinking his morning 's argument confirmed , and she was annoyed . But she thought there was no reason why wealth should not be used sensibly , and if she were at the head of such an establishment as the Grange , her charity should be so well regulated as to be the subject of general approbation . She wanted to find someone else on her side , and , as they went to bed , she said to Ethel , '
116006	116007	116010	116010	we	2775	' '

116362	117138	116356	116356	I	0	' But Flora had to go down to Margaret 's room to bed . Flora was always ready to throw herself into the present , and liked to be the most useful person in all that went forward , so that no thoughts of greatness interfered with her enjoyment at Cocksmoor . The house seemed wild that Easter Monday morning . Ethel , Mary , and Blanche , flew about in all directions , and in spite of much undoing of their own arrangements , finished their preparations so much too early , that at half - past eleven , Mary complained that she had nothing to do , and that dinner would never come . Many were the lamentations at leaving Margaret behind , but she answered them by talking of the treat of having papa all to herself , for he had lent them the gig , and promised to stay at home all the afternoon with her . The first division started on foot directly after dinner , the real council of education , as Norman called them , namely , Mr. Wilmot , Richard , Ethel , and Mary ; Flora , the other member , waited to take care of Blanche and Aubrey , who were to come in the gig , with the cakes , tea - kettles , and prizes , driven by Norman . Tom and Hector Ernescliffe were invited to join the party , and many times did Mary wish for Harry . Supremely happy were the young people as they reached the common , and heard the shout of tumultuous joy , raised by their pupils , who were on the watch for them . All was now activity . Everybody trooped into Mrs. Green 's house , while Richard and Ethel ran different ways to secure that the fires were burning , which they had hired , to boil their kettles , with the tea in them . Then when the kitchen was so full that it seemed as if it could hold no more , some kind of order was produced , the children were seated on their benches , and , while the mothers stood behind to listen , Mr. Wilmot began to examine , as well as he could in so crowded an audience . There was progress . Yes , there was . Only three were as utterly rude and idealess as they used to be at Christmas . Glimmerings had dawned on most , and one — Una M'Carthy — was fit to come forward to claim Mr. Wilmot 's promise of a Prayer - book . She could really read and say the Catechism , her Irish wit and love of learning had out - stripped all the rest , and she was the pride of Ethel 's heart , fit , now , to present herself on equal terms with the Stoneborough set , as far as her sense was concerned — though , alas ! neither present nor exhortation had succeeded in making her anything , in looks , but a picturesque tatterdemalion , her sandy elf locks streaming over a pair of eyes , so dancing and gracieuses , that it was impossible to scold her . With beating heart , as if her own success in life depended for ever on the way her flock acquitted themselves , Ethel stood by Mr. Wilmot , trying to read answers coming out of the dull mouths of her children , and looking exultingly at Richard whenever some good reply was made , especially when Una answered an unexpected question . It was too delightful to hear how well she remembered all the history up to the flood , and how prettily it came out in her Irish accent ! That made up for all the atrocious stupidity of others , who , after being told every time since they had begun , who gave their names , now chose to forget . In the midst , while the assembly were listening with admiration to the reading of the scholar next in proficiency to Una , a boy , who could read words of five letters without spelling , there was a fresh squeezing at the door , and , the crowd opening as well as it could , in came Flora and Blanche , while Norman 's head was seen for a moment in the doorway . Flora 's whisper to Ethel was her first discovery , that the closeness and heat of the room were nearly overpowering . Her excitement had made all be forgotten . '
117146	117163	116356	116356	I	0	' Mrs. Green interfered — it had been nailed up because her husband had the rheumatiz ! '
117168	117172	116356	116356	I	0	' asked Mary . '

117234	117242	117229	117229	you	280	' said Ethel , in an agony . '
117268	117296	117229	117229	you	280	' Richard and Mr. Wilmot agreed with Flora , and the party were turned out . Ethel did own , when she was in the open air , '
117304	117639	117229	117229	you	280	' Norman 's face was a sight , as he stood holding Aubrey in his arms , to gratify the child 's impatience . The stiffing den , the uncouth aspect of the children , the head girl so very ragged a specimen , thoroughly revolted his somewhat fastidious disposition . This was Ethel 's delight ! to this she made so many sacrifices ! this was all that her time and labour had effected ! He did not wish to vex her , but it was more than he could stand . However , Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy . It was a fine spring day , and on the open space of the common the arrangements were quickly made . The children stood in a long line , and the baskets were unpacked . Flora and Ethel called the names , Mary and Blanche gave the presents , and assuredly the grins , courtesies , and pulls of the forelock they elicited , could not have been more hearty for any of Miss Rivers 's treasures . The buns and the kettles of tea followed — it was perfect delight to entertainers and entertained , except when Mary 's dignity was cruelly hurt by Norman 's authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands , telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody else , and reducing her to the mere rank of a bun distributor , which Blanche and Aubrey could do just as well ; while he stalked along with a grave and resigned countenance , filling up the cups held out to him by timid - looking children . Mary next fell in with Granny Hall , who had gone into such an ecstasy over Blanche and Aubrey , that Blanche did not know which way to look ; and Aubrey , in some fear that the old woman might intend to kiss him , returned the compliments by telling her she was '
117646	117721	117229	117229	you	280	' at which she laughed heartily , and uttered more vehement benedictions . Finally , the three best children , boys and girls , were to be made fit to be seen , and recommended by Mr. Wilmot to the Sunday - school and penny - club at Stoneborough , and , this being proclaimed , and the children selected , the assembly dispersed . Mr. Wilmot rejoicing Ethel and Richard , by saying , '
117754	117786	117834	117834	you	2789	' Ethel 's eyes beamed , and she hurried to tell Flora . Richard coloured and gave his quiet smile , then turned to put things in order for their return . '
117794	117803	117834	117834	you	2789	' said Norman , coming up to him . '
117810	117830	117834	117834	you	2789	' said Richard , who had many minor arrangements to make , and would have preferred walking home independently . '
117850	117866	117873	117873	I	0	' said Norman , taking off his hat and passing his fingers through his hair . '

118121	118435	118116	118116	you	0	' There was no answer — Richard was walking off with his basket , and putting it into the carriage . Norman was not pleased with himself , but thought it his duty to let his father know his opinion of Ethel 's weekly resort . All he wished was to avoid Ethel herself , not liking to show her his sentiments , and he was glad to see her put into the gig with Aubrey and Mary . They rushed into the drawing - room , full of glee , when they came home , all shouting their news together , and had not at first leisure to perceive that Margaret had some tidings for them in return . Mr. Rivers had been there , with a pressing invitation to his daughter 's school - feast , and it had been arranged that Flora and Ethel should go and spend the day at the Grange , and their father come to dine , and fetch them home in the evening . Margaret had been much pleased with the manner in which the thing was done . When Dr. May , who seemed reluctant to accept the proposal that related to himself , was called out of the room , Mr. Rivers had , in a most kind manner , begged her to say whether she thought it would be painful to him , or whether it might do his spirits good . She decidedly gave her opinion in favour of the invitation , Mr. Rivers gained his point , and she had ever since been persuading her father to like the notion , and assuring him it need not be made a precedent for the renewal of invitations to dine out in the town . He thought the change would be pleasant for his girls , and had , therefore , consented . '

Then it was not she , but Margaret , who told Flora — Ethel could not , as she said , enjoy what seemed to sadden her father . Flora received it much more calmly . '
118773	118777	118783	118783	papa	7391	' said she ; '

The invitation was a convenient subject of conversation , for Norman had so much to tell his sisters of the curiosities they must look for at the Grange , that he was not obliged to mention Cocksmoor . He did not like to mortify Ethel by telling her his intense disgust , and he knew he was about to do what she would think a great injury by speaking to his father on the subject ; but he thought it for her real welfare , and took the first opportunity of making to his father and Margaret a most formidable description of Ethel 's black - hole . It quite alarmed Margaret , but the Doctor smiled , saying , '

118991	118999	118977	118977	Norman	227	' said Norman , with some mortification , '

119078	119086	119095	119095	papa	7391	' said Dr. May , looking provoking . '

119121	119167	119114	119114	I	0	' said Dr. May , walking off , and leaving Norman in a state of considerable annoyance at being thus treated . He broke out into fresh exclamations against the horrors of Cocksmoor , telling Margaret she had no idea what a den it was . '

119380	119402	119371	119371	I	0	' said Margaret , not quite liking Norman 's tone , though she had not much to say to his arguments . '
119403	119462	119347	119347	Margaret	249	' Not wasted ? Not in doing what anyone can do ? I know what you 'll say about the poor . I grant it , but high ability must be given for a purpose , not to be thrown away . It is common sense , that some one must be meant to do the dirty work . '
119463	119490	119491	119491	she	249	' I see what you mean , Norman , but I do n't quite like that to be called by such a name . I think — '
119494	119506	119491	119491	she	249	' Do n't you think you dislike such things more than — '
119507	119524	119491	119491	she	249	' Anyone must abominate dirt and slovenliness . I know what you mean . My father thinks '

119588	119597	119582	119582	her	249	' I dare say it was very disagreeable . '
119598	119613	119582	119582	her	249	' And you think , too , that I made a disturbance for nothing ? '
119614	119667	119668	119668	Norman	227	' No , indeed I do n't nor does dear papa . I have no doubt he will see whether it is proper for Ethel . All I think he meant is , that perhaps your not being well last winter , has made you a little more sensitive in such things . '
120043	120053	120054	120054	she	402	' I told you I should get my way ! '
120277	120289	120269	120269	she	280	' Why , Ethel , you are quite overwhelming Mrs. Larpent . '
120453	120459	120461	120461	Ethel	300	' the feast ate merrily , '
120626	120632	120609	120609	she	300	' I beg your pardon , '

120722	120731	120711	120711	him	255	' was that one of the Miss Mays ? '
120732	120746	120711	120711	him	255	' Yes , papa , Ethel , the third , the clever one . '
120747	120770	120711	120711	him	255	' I thought she must be one of them from her dress ; but what a difference between her and the others ! '
120890	120897	120899	120899	Meta	402	' Oh ! I am sorry ! '
120901	120981	120899	120899	Meta	402	' Easter wo n't come again for a whole year , and it has been so delightful . How that dear little Annie smiled and nursed her doll ! I wish I could see her show it to her mother ! Oh ! how nice it is ! I am so glad papa brought me to live in the country . I do n't think anything can be so charming in all the world as seeing little children happy ! '
121183	121222	121168	121168	her	280	' It is not worth while to be unhappy about that , Ethel . If it is an effort , it will be good for him when he is once here . I know he will enjoy it . '
121223	121255	121168	121168	her	280	' Yes , I should think he would — I hope he will . He must like you to have such a friend as Miss Rivers . How pretty she is ! '
121256	121286	121287	121287	Ethel	300	' Now , Ethel , it is high time to dress . Pray make yourself look nice — don't twist up your hair in that any - how fashion . '
121391	121421	121359	121359	Flora	280	' Never mind , Flora , it is quite tidy , I am sure , there — do let me be in peace . You are like old nurse . '
121422	121432	121359	121359	Flora	280	' So those are all the thanks I get ? '
121433	121460	121359	121359	Flora	280	' Well , thank you very much , dear Flora . You are a famous person . How I wish Margaret could see that lovely mimosa ! '
121461	121512	121359	121359	Flora	280	' And , Ethel , do take care . Pray do n't poke and spy when you come into the room , and do n't frown when you are trying to see . I hope you wo n't have anything to help at dinner . Take care how you manage . '
121513	121518	121520	121520	Ethel	300	' I 'll try , '
122157	122168	122170	122170	she	300	' As one star differeth from another star in glory , '
122172	122183	122170	122170	she	300	' that was the lesson to - day , papa ; '
123642	123652	123619	123619	His	438	' So you are at that trick , Larkins . '
123653	123661	123663	123663	Larkins	438	' There ! that bet is lost ! '
123665	123688	123663	123663	Larkins	438	' I laid Hill half - a - crown that you would not see me when you were mooning over your verses ! '
123689	123701	123619	123619	His	438	' Well , I have seen you . And now — ? '
123702	123752	123753	123754	The boy	893	' Come , you would not thrash a fellow when you have just lost him half - a - crown ! Single misfortunes never come alone , they say ; so there 's my money and my credit gone , to say nothing of Ballhatchet 's ginger - beer ! '
123777	123801	123768	123768	he	227	' You know , Larkins , I have given out that such things are not to be . It is a melancholy fact . '
123802	123814	123816	123816	Larkins	438	' Aye ! so you must make an example of me ! '
123823	123856	123858	123858	he	438	' Better call all the fellows together , had n't you , and make it more effective ? It would be grateful to one 's feelings , you know — and June , '
123866	123894	123858	123858	he	438	' if you 'll only lay it on soft , I 'll take care it makes noise enough . Great cry , little wool , you know . '
123895	123900	123902	123902	Norman	227	' Come with me , '
123904	123922	123902	123902	Norman	227	' I 'll take care you are example enough . What did you give for those articles ? '
123923	123963	123858	123858	he	438	' Fifteen - pence half - penny . Rascally dear , is n't it ? but the old rogue makes one pay double for the risk ! You are making his fortune , you have raised his prices fourfold . '
123964	123972	123858	123858	he	438	' I 'll take care of that . '
123973	123986	123902	123902	Norman	227	' Why , where are you taking me ? Back to him ? '
123987	124000	123858	123858	he	438	' I am going to gratify your wish to be an example . '
124001	124008	124010	124010	Larkins	438	' A gibbet ! a gibbet ! '
124012	124014	124010	124010	Larkins	438	' I 'm

124093	124131	124132	124133	Mr. May	227	' said Norman , to his follower , as he crossed the entrance of the little shop , the first time he had ever been there . A little cringing shrivelled old man stood up in astonishment . '
124143	124144	124145	124146	Mr. Ballhatchet	452	' '
124170	124171	124174	124174	sir	7572	' '
124211	124222	124209	124209	sir	7572	' pleaded the old man , in a great fright . '
124226	124230	124209	124209	sir	7572	' said Norman , '
124259	124260	124247	124248	the boys	7404	' '
124277	124319	124321	124321	he	7572	' Tis nothing in life but ginger - beer — very cooling drink , sir , of my wife 's making ; she had the receipt from her grandmother up in Leicestershire . Wo n't you taste a bottle , sir ? '
124344	124349	124342	124342	Norman	227	' up to him , '
124356	124363	124342	124342	Norman	227	' Give me yours , Larkins . '
124397	124441	124375	124375	his	438	' Bless me ! It is a little flat . I wonder how that happened ? I 'll be most happy to change it , sir . Wife ! what 's the meaning of Mr. Larkins 's ginger - pop being so flat ? '
124442	124455	124457	124457	Norman	227	' It is very curious ginger - beer indeed , Mr. Ballhatchet , '
124459	124485	124457	124457	Norman	227	' and since it is liable to have such strange properties , I can not allow it to be used any more at the school . '
124486	124509	124375	124375	his	438	' Very well , sir — as you please , sir . You are the first gentleman as has objected , sir . '
124510	124522	124524	124524	Norman	227	' And , once for all , I give you warning , '
124526	124556	124524	124524	Norman	227	' that if I have reason to believe you have been obliging the young gentlemen , the magistrates and the trustees of the road shall certainly hear of it . '
124557	124583	124375	124375	his	438	' You would not hurt a poor man , sir , as is drove to it — you as has such a name for goodness . '
124584	124591	124593	124593	Norman	227	' I have given you warning , '
124595	124641	124593	124593	Norman	227	' The next time I find any of your bottles in the school fields , your license goes . Now , there are your goods . Give Mr. Larkins back the fifteen - pence . I wonder you are not ashamed of such a charge ! '
124658	124665	124654	124654	Larkins	455	' Ha ! there 's Harrison ! '
124678	124699	124701	124701	he	455	' How he stared ! My eyes ! June , you 'll be had up for dealing with old Ball ! '
124709	124724	124701	124701	he	455	' You 've settled him , I believe . Well , is justice satisfied ? '
124725	124734	124736	124736	Norman	227	' It would be no use thrashing you , '
124757	124770	124741	124741	he	227	' There 's nothing to be got out of you but chaff . '
124778	124819	124771	124771	Larkins	455	' But I 'll tell you what , Larkins , I ca n't think how a fellow like you can go and give in to these sneaking , underhand tricks that make you ashamed to look one in the face . '
124820	124830	124741	124741	he	227	' It is only for the fun of it . '
124831	124900	124901	124901	Larkins	455	' Well , I wish you would find your fun some other way . Come , Larkins , recollect yourself a little — you have a home not so far off . How do you think your father and mother would fancy seeing you reading the book you had yesterday , or coming out of Ballhatchet 's with a bottle of spirits , called by a false name ? '
124944	124948	124949	124949	he	893	' Our own ! '
124952	124957	124949	124949	he	893	' There she is ! '
125007	125014	125020	125020	she	456	' Who was that with you ? '
125037	125046	125020	125020	she	456	' That was May senior , our Dux . '
125047	125075	125020	125020	she	456	' Was it ? I am very glad you should be with him , my dear George . He is very kind to you , I hope ? '
125076	125084	125086	125086	Larkins	438	' He is a jolly good fellow , '
125208	125213	125219	125219	he	452	' that there young May '
125530	125538	125540	125540	Larkins	438	' That they do , my hearty , '
125767	125781	125783	125783	Norman	227	' What would old Nicholas Randall say to these nineteenth - century doings ! '
125785	125790	125792	125796	a voice from the throng	3033	' Down with them ! '
125816	125842	125792	125796	a voice from the throng	3033	' Down with it ! Hurrah , we 'll have our footpath open again ! Down with the fences ! Britons never shall be slaves ! '
125848	125859	125861	125862	Harvey Anderson	272	' That 's the way to bring it to bear ! '
125864	125878	125861	125862	Harvey Anderson	272	' See if he dares to bring an action against us . Hurrah ! '
125879	125890	125892	125892	Norman	227	' Yes , that 's the way to settle it , '
125894	125923	125892	125892	Norman	227	' Let 's have it down . It is an oppressive , arbitrary , shameful proceeding , and we 'll show him we wo n't submit to it ! '
126080	126090	126092	126092	he	7526	' What will Dr. Hoxton say to the dux ? '
126094	126113	126092	126092	he	7526	' I did n't know he was to be dux in mischief as well as out of it . '
126114	126154	126166	126167	the Doctor	890	' You ca n't call it mischief , papa , to resent an unwarranted encroachment of our rights by such an old ruffian as that . One 's blood is up to think of the things he has done ! '
126155	126164	126166	126167	the Doctor	890	' He richly deserves it , no doubt , '
126169	126198	126166	126167	the Doctor	890	' and yet I wish you had been out of the row . If there is any blame , you will be the first it will light on . '
126199	126249	126166	126167	the Doctor	890	' I am glad of it , that is but just . Anderson and I seem to have stirred it up — if it wanted stirring — for it was in every fellow there ; indeed , I had no notion it was coming to this when I began . '
126250	126253	126255	126256	the Doctor	890	' Oratory , '
126260	126310	126255	126256	the Doctor	890	' Ha , Norman ! Think a little another time , my boy , before you take the law into your own hands , or , what is worse , into a lot of hands you ca n't control for good , though you may excite them to harm . '
126394	126401	126403	126403	Norman	227	' I am sorry , sir , '
126405	126439	126403	126403	Norman	227	' but I believe it was the general feeling that he had no right to stop the alley , and , therefore , that it could not be wrong to break it down . '
126440	126508	126509	126509	Norman	227	' Whether he has a right or not , is not a question to be settled by you . So I find that you , whose proper office it is to keep order , have been inflaming the mischievous and aggressive spirit amongst the others . I am surprised at you ; I thought you were more to be depended upon , May , in your position . '
126519	126526	126509	126509	Norman	227	' I am sorry , sir . '
126527	126541	126543	126544	Dr. Hoxton	269	' Take care , then , that nothing of the kind happens again , '
126614	126627	126580	126580	he	269	' old Tomkins had his fence up five times higher than before . '
126628	126637	126639	126639	Axworthy	308	' Have at him again , say I ! '
126641	126658	126639	126639	Axworthy	308	' What business has he coming stopping up ways that were made before he was born ? '
126659	126671	126673	126674	Edward Anderson	437	' We shall catch it from the Doctor if we do , '
126676	126696	126673	126674	Edward Anderson	437	' He looked in no end of a rage yesterday when he talked about the credit of the school . '
126697	126707	126709	126711	the elder Anderson	272	' Who cares for the credit of the school ? '
126713	126776	126709	126711	the elder Anderson	272	' we are out of the school now — we are townsmen — Stoneborough boys — citizens not bound to submit to injustice . No , no , the old rogue knew it would not stand if it was brought into court , so he brings down old Hoxton on us instead — a dirty trick he deserves to be punished for . '
126788	126791	126793	126793	Norman	227	' Anderson , '
126795	126824	126793	126793	Norman	227	' you had better not excite them again , they are ripe for mischief . It will go further than it did yesterday — do n't you see ? '
126847	126859	126861	126861	Norman	227	' It is of no use to rave about old Tomkins , '
126870	126916	126861	126861	Norman	227	' If it is illegal , some one will go to law about it , and we shall have our alley again . We have shown him our mind once , and that is enough ; if we let him alone now , he will see '
126984	127388	126982	126982	August	436	' Tom was not visible — he generally avoided going home with his brother , and Norman having seen the boys divide into two or three little parties , as their roads lay homewards , found he had an hour of light for an expedition of his own , along the bank of the river . He had taken up botany with much ardour , and sharing the study with Margaret was a great delight to both . There was a report that the rare yellow bog - bean grew in a meadow about a mile and a half up the river , and thither he was bound , extremely enjoying the summer evening walk , as the fresh dewy coolness sunk on all around , and the noises of the town were mellowed by distance , and the sun 's last beams slanted on the green meadows , and the May - flies danced , and dragon - flies darted , and fish rose or leapt high in the air , or showed their spotted sides , and opened and shut their gills , as they rested in the clear water , and the evening breeze rustled in the tall reeds , and brought fragrance from the fresh - mown hay . It was complete enjoyment to Norman after his day 's study , and the rule and watch over the unruly crowd of boys , and he walked and wandered , and collected plants for Margaret till the sun was down , and the grasshoppers chirped clamorously , while the fern - owl purred , and the beetle hummed , and the skimming swallows had given place to the soft - winged bat , and the large white owl floating over the fields as it moused in the long grass . The summer twilight was sobering every tint , when , as Norman crossed the cricket - field , he heard , in the distance , a loud shout . He looked up , and it seemed to him that he saw some black specks dancing in the forbidden field , and something like the waving of a flag , but it was not light enough to be certain , and he walked quickly home . The front door was fastened , and , while he was waiting to be let in , Mr. Harrison walked by , and called out , '

127533	127615	127618	127618	you	3056	' A sort of instinctive dread directed Norman 's steps down the open portion of Randall 's Alley , and , voices growing louder as he came nearer , confirmed his suspicions . The fence at this end was down , and , on entering the field , a gleam of light met his eye on the ground — a cloud of smoke , black figures were flitting round it , pushing brands into red places , and feeding the bonfire . '
127622	127626	127618	127618	you	3056	' exclaimed Norman . '
127636	127645	127646	127646	Randall	235	' A peal of laughter , and shout of '
127652	127657	127658	127658	August	436	' was the reply . '
127672	127690	127669	127669	he	893	' asked Norman , not solicitous to identify anyone . But gruff voices broke in upon them . '
127697	127701	127669	127669	he	893	'em for mischief . '
127702	127708	127710	127711	a policeman	3063	' Come , young gentlemen , '
127713	127737	127710	127711	a policeman	3063	' be off , if you please . We do n't want to have none of you at the Station to - night . '
127955	127966	127938	127938	He	227	' Norman — why Norman , what 's the matter ? '
127987	127992	127994	127995	the Doctor	890	' Where 's Tom ? '
128000	128015	127994	127995	the Doctor	890	' Has he got into disgrace about this business of Tomkins ? That boy — '
128016	128024	128026	128026	Norman	227	' He has only got an imposition , '
128028	128041	128026	128026	Norman	227	' No , it is not that — it is myself , — '
128058	128067	128052	128052	he	227	' I am turned down in the school . '
128079	128093	128068	128069	The Doctor	890	' What — how — speak , Norman . What have you done ? '
128094	128097	128099	128099	Norman	227	' Nothing ! '
128113	128116	128099	128099	Norman	227	' nothing ! '
128117	128122	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' That 's right , '
128130	128141	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' What 's the meaning of it ... a misunderstanding ? '
128142	128145	128147	128147	Norman	227	' Yes , '
128152	128198	128147	128147	Norman	227	' It is all Anderson 's doing — a word from him would have set all straight — but he would not — I believe , from my heart , he held his tongue to get me down , that he might have the Randall ! '
128199	128206	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' We 'll see you righted , '
128213	128231	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' Come , tell me the whole story , Norman . Is it about this unlucky business ? '
128232	128434	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' Yes . The town - fellows were all up about it last evening , when we came out of school . Anderson senior himself began to put them up to having the fence down again . Yes , that he did — I remember his very words — that Tomkins could not bring it into Court , and so set old Hoxton at us . Well , I told them it would not do,—thought I had settled them — saw them off home — yes , Simpson , and Benson , and Grey , up the High Street , and the others their way . I only left Axworthy going into a shop when I set off on my walk . What could a fellow do more ? How was I to know that that Axworthy would get them together again , and take them to this affair — pull up the stakes — saw them down — for they were hard to get down — shy all sorts of things over into the court — hoot at old Tomkins 's man , when he told them to be off — and make a bonfire of the sticks at last ? '
128435	128442	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' And Harvey Anderson was there ? '
128443	128490	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' No — not he . He is too sharp — born and bred attorney as he is — he talked them up to the mischief when my back was turned , and then sneaked quietly home , quite innocent , and out of the scrape . '
128491	128509	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' But Doctor Hoxton can never entertain a suspicion that you had anything to do with it . '
128510	128558	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' Yes , he does though . He thinks I incited them , and Tomkins and the policeman declare I was there in the midst of the row — and not one of these fellows will explain how I came at the last to look for Tom . '
128559	128565	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' Not Tom himself ? — '
128566	128608	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' He did try to speak , poor little fellow , but , after the other affair , his word goes for nothing , and so , it seems , does mine . I did think Hoxton would have trusted me ! '
128609	128615	128617	128618	Dr. May.	401	' And did not he ? '
128619	128737	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' He did not in so many words accuse me of — of — but he told me he had serious charges brought against me — Mr. Harrison had seen me at Ballhatchet 's , setting an example of disregard to rules — and , again , Mr. Harrison saw me coming in at a late hour last night . " I know he did , " I said , and I explained where I had been , and they asked for proofs ! I could hardly answer , from surprise , at their not seeming to believe me , but I said you could answer for my having come in with the flowers for my sister . '
128738	128750	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' To be sure I will — I'll go this instant — '
128755	128776	128208	128209	the Doctor	890	' It is of no use , papa , to - night ; Dr. Hoxton has a dinner - party . '
128777	128819	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' He is always having parties . I wish he would mind them less , and his business more . You disbelieved ! but I 'll see justice done you , Norman , the first thing to - morrow . Well — '
128820	128891	128124	128125	the Doctor	890	' Well then , I said , old Ballhatchet could tell that I crossed the bridge at the very time they were doing this pretty piece of work , for he was sitting smoking in his porch when I went home , and , would you believe it ? the old rascal would not remember who passed that evening ! It is all his malice and revenge — nothing else ! '
128892	128903	128904	128904	Norman	227	' Why — what have you been doing to him ? '
128916	128982	128904	128904	Norman	227	' Cheviot told me I should get nothing but ill - will , and so I have — all those town fellows turn against me now , and though they know as well as possible how it was , they wo n't say a word to right me , just out of spite , because I have stopped them from all the mischief I could ! '
128987	128988	128989	128989	They	3080	' '
129308	129309	129291	129291	he	461	' '
129323	129333	129334	129334	I	0	' said Dr. May , pressing Norman 's arm ; '
129402	129403	129404	129408	Every fellow in the school	3089	' '
129414	129418	129404	129408	Every fellow in the school	3089	' said Norman ; '
129487	129488	129489	129489	You	0	' '
129595	129867	129586	129587	old Hoxton	269	' Dr. May and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly . There was so much of sympathy and fellow - feeling between them , that there was no backwardness on Norman 's part in telling his whole trouble , with more confidence than school - boys often show towards their fathers , and Dr. May entered into the mortification as if he were still at school . They did not go into the house , but walked long up and down the garden , working themselves up into , if possible , stronger indignation , and concerting the explanation for to - morrow , when Dr. May meant to go at once to the head master , and make him attend to the true version of the story , appealing to Harvey Anderson himself , Larkins , and many others , for witnesses . There could be hardly a doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated ; but , if Dr. Hoxton would not see things in their true light , Dr. May was ready to take him away at once , rather than see him suffer injustice . Still , though comforted by his father 's entire reliance , Norman was suffering severely under the sense of indignity , and grieved that Dr. Hoxton , and the other masters , should have believed him guilty — that name of May could never again boast of being without reproach . To be in disgrace stung him to the quick , even though undeservedly , and he could not bear to go in , meet his sisters , and be pitied . '
129878	130024	129872	129872	they	3100	' said he , when the Minster clock pealing ten , obliged them to go in doors , and his father agreed . They bade each other good - night , with the renewal of the promise that Dr. Hoxton should be forced to hear Norman 's vindication the first thing to - morrow , Harvey Anderson be disappointed of what he meanly triumphed in , and Norman be again in his post at the head of the school , in more honour and confidence than ever , putting down evil , and making Stoneborough what it ought to be . As Dr. May lay awake in the summer 's morning , meditating on his address to Dr. Hoxton , he heard the unwelcome sound of a ring at the bell , and , in a few minutes , a note was brought to him . '
130045	130073	130035	130035	him	279	' And , in a few minutes , the Doctor opened Norman 's door , and found him dressed , and standing by the window , reading . '
130156	130157	130159	130159	you	227	' '
130170	130178	130166	130166	I	0	' said Norman , looking rather blank . '
130202	130203	130191	130191	I	0	' '
130221	130254	130212	130212	I	0	' Yes , do , thank you ; it will hasten matters . Only , first order in some breakfast . What makes you up so early ? Have not you slept ? '
130255	130267	130209	130209	papa	7391	' Not much — it has been such a hot night . '
130268	130302	130212	130212	I	0	' And you have a head - ache . Well , we will find a cure for that before the day is over . I have settled what to say to old Hoxton . '
130646	130656	130658	130660	the old man—'he	3133	' Thank Heaven , you are come , Sir , '
130665	130870	130658	130660	the old man—'he	3133	' Norman knew young Lake , who had been a senior boy when he first went to school , was a Randall scholar , and had borne an excellent character , and highly distinguished himself at the University . And now , by all accounts , he seemed to be dying — in the height of honour and general esteem . Dr. May went into the house , the old man took the horse , and Norman lingered under the trees in the church - yard , watching the white curtains now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze , as he lay on the turf in the shade , under the influence of the gentle sadness around , resting , mind and body , from the tossing tumultuous passionate sensations that had kept him restless and miserable through the hot night . He waited long — one hour , two hours had passed away , but he was not impatient , and hardly knew how long the time had been before his father and Mr. Lake came out of the house together , and , after they parted , Dr. May summoned him . He of course asked first for the patient . '
130879	130904	130658	130660	the old man—'he	3133	' and the reasons for having been kept so long were detailed , with many circumstances of the youth 's illness , and the parents '
130951	130977	130948	130948	Norman	227	' Papa , I have been thinking about it , and I believe it would he better to let it alone , if you please . '
130978	130985	130987	130988	his father	7526	' Not apply to Dr. Hoxton ! '
130990	131056	130987	130988	his father	7526	' Well , I think not . I have been considering it , and it does hardly seem to me the right thing . You see , if I had not you close at hand , this could never be explained , and it seems rather hard upon Anderson , who has no father , and the other fellows , who have theirs further off — '
131057	131134	130948	130948	Norman	227	' Right , Norman , that is what my father before me always said , and the way I have always acted myself ; much better let a few trifles go on not just as one would wish , than be for ever interfering . But I really think this is a case for it , and I do n't think you ought to let yourself be influenced by the fear of any party - spirit . '
131135	131318	130987	130988	his father	7526	' It is not only that , papa — I have been thinking a good deal to - day , and there are other reasons . Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know that I spoke the truth about that walk , and I hope you will let him know , as I appealed to you . But , on cooler thoughts , I do n't believe Dr. Hoxton could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that , and it was not on that ground that I am turned down , but that I did not keep up sufficient discipline , and allowed the outrage , as he calls it . Now , you know , that is , after a fashion , true . If I had not gone on like an ass the other day , and incited them to pull down the fences , they would not have done it afterwards , and perhaps , I ought to have kept on guard longer . It was my fault , and we ca n't deny it . '
131328	131363	131319	131320	Dr. May	238	' Well , well , I suppose it was — but it was just as much Harvey Anderson's — and is he to get the scholarship because he has added meanness to the rest ? '
131364	131370	131372	131372	Norman	227	' He was not Dux , '
131378	131466	131372	131372	Norman	227	' It was more shabby than I thought was even in him . But I do n't know that the feeling about him is not one reason . There has always been a rivalry and bitterness between us two , and if I were to get the upper hand now , by means not in the usual course , such as the fellows would think ill of , it would be worse than ever , and I should always feel guilty and ashamed to look at him . '
131467	131474	131476	131477	Dr. May.	401	' Over - refining , Norman , '
131478	131553	131372	131372	Norman	227	' Besides , do n't you remember , when his father died , how glad you and everyone were to get him a nomination , and it was said that if he gained a scholarship , it would be such a relief to poor Mrs. Anderson ? Now he has this chance , it does seem hard to deprive her of it . I should not like to know that I had done so . '
131554	131557	131558	131559	the Doctor	890	' Whew ! '
131565	131617	131558	131559	the Doctor	890	' You could not make it straight , papa , without explaining about the dealing with Ballhatchet , and that would be unfair to them all , even the old rogue himself ; for I promised to say nothing about former practices , as long as he did not renew them . '
131618	131680	131372	131372	Norman	227	' Well ! I do n't want to compromise you , Norman . You know your own ground best , but I do n't like it at all . You do n't know the humiliation of disgrace . Those who have thought highly of you , now thinking you changed — I do n't know how to bear it for you . '
131681	131692	131694	131694	Norman	227	' I do n't mind anything while you trust me , '
131698	131720	131694	131694	Norman	227	' not much I mean , except Mr. Wilmot . You must judge , papa , and do as you please . '
131721	131773	131372	131372	Norman	227	' No , you must judge , Norman . Your confidence in me ought not to be a restraint . It has always been an understood thing that , what you say at home is , as if it had not been said , as regards my dealings with the masters . '
131774	131910	131372	131372	Norman	227	' I know , papa . Well , I 'll tell you what brought me to this . I tumbled about all night in a rage , when I thought how they had served me , and of Hoxton 's believing it all , and how he might only half give in to your representation , and then I gloried in Anderson 's coming down from his height , and being seen in his true colours . So it went on till morning came , and I got up . You know you gave me my mother 's little Thomas à Kempis . I always read a bit every morning . To - day it was , " Of four things that bring much inward peace . " And what do you think they were ? '
131971	132044	132045	132046	Dr. May	238	' I liked them the more , because it was just like her last reading with us , and like that letter.—Well , then I wondered as I lay on the grass at Groveswood , whether she would have thought it best for me to be reinstated , and I found out that I should have been rather afraid of what you might say when she had talked it over with you . '
132071	132094	132067	132067	his	238	' So you took her for your counsellor , my boy . That was the way to find out what was right . '
132095	132274	132275	132275	His	3142	' Well , there was something in the place , and , in watching poor Lake 's windows , that made me not able to dwell so much on getting on , and having prizes and scholarships . I thought that caring for those had been driven out of me , and you know I never felt as if it were my right when I was made Dux ; but now I find it is all come back . It does not do for me to be first ; I have been what she called elated , and been more peremptory than need with the lower boys , and gone on in my old way with Richard , and so I suppose this disgrace has come to punish me . I wish it were not disgrace , because of our name at school , and because it will vex Harry so much ; but since it is come , considering all things , I suppose I ought not to struggle to justify myself at other people 's expense . '
132299	132357	132293	132294	his father	7526	' I ca n't say anything against it , Norman , but I am sorry , and one thing more you should consider . If Dr. Hoxton should view this absurd business in the way he seems to do , it will stand in your way for ever in testimonials , if you try for anything else . '
132358	132372	132067	132067	his	238	' Do you think it will interfere with my having a Confirmation ticket ? '
132373	132395	132275	132275	His	3142	' Why no , I should not think — such a boyish escapade could be no reason for refusing you one . '
132396	132424	132067	132067	his	238	' Very well then , it had better rest . If there should be any difficulty about my being Confirmed , of course we will explain it . '
132425	132435	132275	132275	His	3142	' I wish everyone showed themselves as well prepared ! '
132448	132535	132275	132275	His	3142	' Well , Norman , I give up the scholarship . Poor Mrs. Anderson wants it more than we do , and if the boy is a shabby fellow , the more he wants a decent education . But what do you say to this ? I make Hoxton do you full justice , and reinstate you in your proper place , and then I take you away at once — send you to a tutor — anything , till the end of the long vacation . '
132536	132540	132542	132542	Norman	227	' Thank you , '
132546	132596	132542	132542	Norman	227	' I do n't know , papa . I am very much obliged to you , but I think it would hardly do . You would be uncomfortable at seeming to quarrel with Dr. Hoxton , and it would be hardly creditable for me to go off in anger . '
132597	132605	132607	132608	Dr. May.	401	' You are right , I believe , '
132609	132647	132542	132542	Norman	227	' You judge wisely , though I should not have ventured to ask it of you . But what is to become of the discipline of the school ? Is that all to go to the dogs ? '
132648	132709	132711	132711	he	3145	' I could not do anything with them if I were restored in this way ; they would be more set against me . It is bad enough as it is , but , even for my own peace , I believe it is better to leave it alone . All my comfort in school is over , I know ! '
132715	132723	132725	132726	the Doctor	890	' It is a most untoward business ! '
132728	132771	132725	132726	the Doctor	890	' I am very sorry your school - days should be clouded — but it ca n't be helped , and you will work yourself into a character again . You are full young , and can stay for the next Randall . '
132914	132942	132948	132948	he	227	' I really do think it is quite wrong of you to give up your chance of doing good , and leave him in his evil ways ! '
133001	133010	133012	133012	Margaret	249	' Has he told you , poor fellow ? '
133014	133017	133019	133019	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
133021	133029	133019	133019	Ethel	300	' Was there ever such a shame ? '
133030	133038	133040	133040	Flora	280	' That is just what I say , '
133042	133060	133040	133040	Flora	280	' I can not see why the Andersons are to have a triumph over all of us . '
133061	133073	133075	133075	Ethel	300	' I used to think Harvey the best of the two , '
133077	133109	133075	133075	Ethel	300	' Now , I think he is a great deal the worst . Taking advantage of such a mistake as this ! How will he ever look Norman in the face . '
133110	133113	133115	133115	Margaret	249	' Really , '
133117	133131	133115	133115	Margaret	249	' I see no use in aggravating ourselves by talking of the Andersons . '
133132	133142	133144	133144	Flora	280	' I ca n't think how papa can consent , '
133146	133162	133144	133144	Flora	280	' I am sure , if I were in his place , I should not ! '
133163	133185	133187	133187	Margaret	249	' Papa is so much pleased with dear Norman 's behaviour , that it quite makes up for all the disappointment , '
133189	133227	133187	133187	Margaret	249	' Besides , he is very much obliged to him in one way ; he would not have liked to have to battle the matter with Dr. Hoxton . He spoke of Norman 's great good judgment . '
133228	133238	133240	133240	Flora	280	' Yes , Norman can persuade papa to anything , '
133242	133252	133254	133254	Ethel	300	' Yes , I wish papa had not yielded , '
133256	133277	133254	133254	Ethel	300	' It would have been just as noble in dear Norman , and we should not have the apparent disgrace . '
133278	133290	133292	133292	Flora	280	' Perhaps it is best as it is , after all , '
133294	133302	133304	133304	Ethel	300	' Why , how do you mean ? '
133306	133358	133304	133304	Ethel	300	' I think very likely things might have come out . Now , do n't look furious , Ethel . Indeed , I ca n't help it , but really I do n't think it is explicable why Norman should wish to hush it up , unless there were something behind ! '
133359	133362	133364	133364	Ethel	300	' Flora ! '
133375	133386	133388	133388	Margaret	249	' If you are unfortunate enough to have such suspicions , '
133392	133403	133388	133388	Margaret	249	' I think it would be better to be silent . '
133404	133413	133415	133415	Ethel	300	' As if you did not know Norman ! '
133417	133420	133422	133422	Flora	280	' Well , '
133424	133463	133422	133422	Flora	280	' I do n't wish to think so . You know I did not hear Norman himself , and when papa gives his vehement accounts of things , it always puzzles us of the cooler - minded sort . '
133464	133476	133478	133478	Ethel	300	' It is as great a shame as ever I heard ! '
133484	133498	133478	133478	Ethel	300	' Who would you trust , if not your own father and brother ? '
133499	133504	133506	133506	Flora	280	' Yes , yes , '
133518	133583	133478	133478	Ethel	300	' If there is such a thing as an excess of generosity , it is sure to be among ourselves . I only know it does not suit me . It will make us all uncomfortable whenever we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot , or anyone else , and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson , I think it is thrown away . '
133584	133593	133595	133595	Margaret	249	' Thrown away on the object , perhaps , '
133597	133603	133595	133595	Margaret	249	' but not in Norman . '
133604	133609	133612	133612	Ethel	300	' To be sure , '
133614	133661	133612	133612	Ethel	300	' Better be than seem ! Oh , dear ! I am sorry I was vexed with dear old June when he told me . I had rather have him now than if he had gained everything and everyone was praising him — that I had ! '
133703	133704	133701	133701	Margaret	249	' '
133712	133716	133709	133709	he	227	' said Margaret , '
133756	133767	133738	133738	she	249	' Ethel was entirely consoled . Flora thought of the words '
133771	133853	133738	133738	she	249	' and considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in a true light — not that she went the length of believing that Norman had any underhand motives , but she thought it very discreet in her to think a prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to avoid investigation . Dr. May would not trust himself to enter on the subject with Dr. Hoxton in conversation ; he only wrote a note . '
133857	133862	133738	133738	she	249	' Dear Dr. Hoxton , '
133923	133929	133906	133906	he	3139	' Yours , very truly , '
133932	134086	133930	133931	R. May.	249	' A long answer came in return , disclaiming all doubt of Norman 's veracity , and explaining Dr. Hoxton 's grounds for having degraded him . There had been misconduct in the school , he said , for some time past , and he did not consider that it was any very serious reproach , to a boy of Norman 's age , that he had not had weight enough to keep up his authority , and had been carried away by the general feeling . It had been necessary to make an example for the sake of principle , and though very sorry it should have fallen on one of such high promise and general good conduct , Dr. Hoxton trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to his prospects , as his talents had raised him to his former position in the school so much earlier than usual . '
134091	134096	133930	133931	R. May.	249	' said Dr. May , '
134158	134525	134526	134527	Such prigs	3165	' What Mr. Wilmot might think , was felt by all to affect them more nearly . Ethel wanted to hear that he declared his complete conviction of Norman 's innocence , and was disappointed to find that he did not once allude to the subject . She was only consoled by Margaret 's conjecture that , perhaps , he thought the head - master had been hasty , and could not venture to say so — he saw into people 's characters , and it was notorious that it was just what Dr. Hoxton did not . Tom had spent the chief of that Saturday in reading a novel borrowed from Axworthy , keeping out of sight of everyone . All Sunday he avoided Norman more scrupulously than ever , and again on Monday . That day was a severe trial to Norman ; the taking the lower place , and the sense that , excel as much as ever he might in his studies , it would not avail to restore him to his former place , were more unpleasant , when it came to the point , than he had expected . He saw the cold manner , so different from the readiness with which his tasks had always been met , certain as they were of being well done ; he found himself among the common herd whom he had passed so triumphantly , and , for a little while , he had no heart to exert himself . This was conquered by the strong will and self - rebuke for having merely craved for applause , but , in the play - ground , he found himself still alone — the other boys who had been raised by his fall , shrank from intercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence , and the Andersons , who were wo nt to say the Mays carried every tale home , and who still almost expected interference from Dr. May , hardly believed their victory secure , and the younger one , at least , talked spitefully , and triumphed in the result of May 's meddling and troublesome over strictness . '
134534	134619	134620	134620	I	0	' was the sentiment . Norman found himself left out of everything , and stood dispirited and weary on the bank of the river , wishing for Harry , wishing for Cheviot , wishing that he had been able to make a friend who would stand by him , thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father reinstate him — and a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his heart . His first interruption was a merry voice . '

135452	135540	135447	135448	the boy	893	' if you knew what Anderson junior , and Axworthy say ! They say it serves you right , and they were going to send me to old Ballhatchet 's to get some of his stuff to drink confusion to the mouth of June , and all pragmatical meddlers ; and when I said I could not go , they vowed if I did not , I should eat the corks for them ! And Anderson junior called me names , and licked me . Look there . '

135599	135619	135541	135541	He	3188	' No , Anderson senior stopped them . He said he would not have the Ballhatchet business begin again . '

It was one of the quiet afternoons , when all the rest were out , and which the Doctor and his daughter especially valued , when they were able to spend one together without interruption . Soon , however , a ring at the door brought an impatient exclamation from the Doctor ; but his smile beamed out at the words , '

Feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement , yet , with a sense of its truth , used to be petted , and new to rebuffs , yet with a sincere wish to act rightly , she was much perplexed by this , her first reverse , and had come partly with the view of consulting Flora , though she had fallen on other counsellors .

It was a memorable one to little Miss Rivers , opening out to her , as did almost all her meetings with that family , a new scope for thought and for duty . The code , to which she had been brought up , taught that servants were the machines of their employer 's convenience . Good - nature occasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse , and every luxury and indulgence was afforded freely ; but where there was any want of accordance between the convenience of the two parties , there was no question .

142227	142346	142347	142347	Harry	278	' said Dr. May , leading the way to his study , where he related the whole history of the suspicion that Norman had incurred . He was glad that he had done so in private , for Harry 's indignation and grief went beyond his expectations ; and when at last it appeared that Harvey Anderson was actually Randall scholar , after opening his eyes with the utmost incredulity , and causing it to be a second time repeated , he gave a gulp or two , turned very red , and ended by laying his head on the table , and fairly sobbing and crying aloud , in spite of dirk , uniform , and manhood .

143437	143469	143434	143435	the Doctor	890	' and you stronger ones , who do n't mind being bullied , are meant , I suppose , to help them , as Norman has been doing by poor little Tommy '

I ca n't bear it ; and the worst of it is , that — '

145670	145676	145685	145685	I	0	' exclaimed Margaret , delighted ; '
145679	145684	145685	145685	I	0	' after a pause , '
145690	145708	145685	145685	I	0	' Committee might not enter into it in plain English , far less in Ethel 's language . '
145709	145733	145685	145685	I	0	' Now , Margaret ! You know I never meant myself . I never can get the right words for what I mean . '
145734	145756	145758	145758	Margaret	249	' And you leave about your faux commencements , as M. Ballomprê would call them , for us to stumble over , '
145760	145766	145768	145768	Ethel	300	' But Flora would manage ! '
145770	145795	145768	145768	Ethel	300	' She has power over people , and can influence them . O Ritchie , do n't persuade papa out of letting her go . '
145796	145803	145805	145805	Richard	298	' Does Mr. Wilmot wish it ? '
145807	145825	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' I have not heard him say , but he was very much vexed about the prayers , '
145829	145838	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' Will he stay here for the holidays ? '
145839	145876	145768	145768	Ethel	300	' No , his father has not been well , and he is gone to take his duty . He walked with us to Cocksmoor before he went , and we did so wish for you . '
145877	145885	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' How have you been getting on ? '
145886	145894	145896	145896	Ethel	300	' Pretty well , on the whole , '
145898	145914	145896	145896	Ethel	300	' but , oh dear ! oh dear , Richard , the M'Carthys are gone ! '
145915	145920	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' Gone , where ? '
145921	146055	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' Oh , to Wales . I knew nothing of it till they were off . Una and Fergus were missing , and Jane Taylor told me they were all gone . Oh , it is so horrid ! Una had really come to be so good and so much in earnest . She behaved so well at school and Church , that even Mrs. Ledwich liked her , and she used to read her Testament half the day , and bring her Sunday - school lessons to ask me about ! Oh ! I was so fond of her , and it really seemed to have done some good with her . And now it is all lost ! Oh ! I wish I knew what would become of my poor child ! '
146068	146072	145827	145827	Ethel	300	' said Margaret . '
146081	146085	146075	146076	a woman	2132	' said Ethel ; '
146143	146144	146132	146132	Una	384	' '
146153	146157	146145	146145	I	0	' said Richard . '
146169	146186	146158	146159	Mr. Wilmot	450	' said Margaret—'he was very kind in consoling Ethel , who came home quite in despair . '
146187	146199	146201	146201	Ethel	300	' Yes , he said it was one of the trials , '
146203	146281	146201	146201	Ethel	300	' and that it might be better for Una as well as for me . And I am trying to care for the rest still , but I can not yet as I did for her . There are none of the eyes that look as if they were eating up one 's words before they come , and that smile of comprehension ! Oh ! they all are such stupid little dolts , and so indifferent ! '
146282	146287	146158	146159	Mr. Wilmot	450	' Why , Ethel ! '
146288	146301	146158	146159	Mr. Wilmot	450	' Fancy last Friday — Mary and I found only eight there — '
146302	146313	146315	146315	Margaret	249	' Do you remember what a broiling day Friday was ? '
146317	146352	146315	146315	Margaret	249	' Miss Winter and Norman both told me I ought not to let them go , and I began to think so when they came home . Mary was the colour of a peony ! '
146353	146465	146466	146466	Margaret	249	' Oh ! it would not have signified if the children had been good for anything , but all their mothers were out at work , and , of those that did come , hardly one had learnt their lessons — Willy Blake had lost his spelling - card — Anne Harris kicked Susan Pope , and would not say she was sorry . Mary Hale would not know M from N , do all our Mary would ; and Jane Taylor , after all the pains I have taken with her , when I asked how the Israelites crossed the Red Sea , seemed never to have heard of them . '
146490	146501	146502	146502	she	249	' I am so glad you are come , Richard ! '
146505	146531	146502	146502	she	249	' You will put a little new life into them . They all looked so pleased , when we told them Mr. Richard was coming . '
146532	146540	146542	146542	Richard	298	' I hope we shall get on , '
146544	146577	146542	146542	Richard	298	' I want you to judge whether the Popes are civilized enough to be dressed for sunday - school . Oh ! and the money . Here is the account - book — '
146578	146588	146502	146502	she	249	' How neatly you have kept it , Ethel . '
146589	146608	146502	146502	she	249	' Ah ! it was for you , you know . Receipts — see , ar'n't you surprised ? '
146609	146623	146542	146542	Richard	298	' Four pounds , eighteen and eightpence ! That is a great deal ! '
146624	146689	146502	146502	she	249	' The three guineas were Mr. Rivers 's fees , you know ; then , Margaret gave us half - a - sovereign , and Mary a shilling , and there was one that we picked up , tumbling about the house , and papa said we might have , and the two - pence were little Blanche 's savings . Oh , Ritchie ! '
146699	146709	146710	146710	he	298	' That is all I could save this term , '
146713	146833	146710	146710	he	298	' Oh ! it is famous . Now , I do think I may put another whole sovereign away into the purse for the Church . See , here is what we have paid . Shoes — those did bring our money very low , and then I bought a piece of print which cost sixteen shillings , but it will make plenty of frocks . So , you see , the balance is actually two pounds nine ! That is something . The nine shillings will go on till we get another fee ; for I have two frocks ready made for the Popes , so the two pounds are a real nest - egg towards the Church . '
146834	146838	146840	146840	Richard	298	' The Church ! '
146846	146869	146871	146871	Ethel	300	' I looked in the paper the other day , and saw that a chapel had been built for nine hundred pounds , '
146873	146879	146871	146871	Ethel	300	' And you have two ! '
146880	146913	146840	146840	Richard	298	' Two in eight months , Ritchie , and more will come as we get older . I have a scheme in my head , but I wo n't tell you now . '
146934	146935	146932	146932	Ethel	300	' '
146980	146981	146967	146967	I	0	' '
146988	146997	147000	147000	she	1050	' said Richard , as Ethel dashed away . '
147002	147006	147008	147008	she	1050	' said Margaret . '
147057	147058	147059	147059	I	0	' '
147071	147075	147059	147059	I	0	' said Richard . '
147090	147094	147084	147084	they	3491	' said Margaret . '
147119	147140	147114	147114	her	1050	' Neither Richard nor Margaret could help laughing , but they checked it at once , and the former said , '
147151	147152	147114	147114	her	1050	' '
147155	147159	147114	147114	her	1050	' said Margaret ; '
147171	147391	147410	147410	her	3497	' Ethel came back , having , of course , mislaid her sketch , and , much vexed , wished to know if it ought to cause her first forfeit , but Margaret thought these should not begin till the date of the agreement , and the three resumed the Cocksmoor discussion . It lasted till the return of the walking party , so late , that they had been star - gazing , and came in , in full dispute as to which was Cygnus and which Aquila , while Blanche was talking very grandly of Taurus Poniatouski , and Harry begging to be told which constellations he should still see in the southern hemisphere . Dr. May was the first to rectify the globe for the southern latitudes , and fingers were affectionately laid on Orion 's studded belt , as though he were a friend who would accompany the sailor - boy . Voices grew loud and eager in enumerating the stars common to both ; and so come bed - time , and the globe stood on the table in danger of being forgotten . Ethel diligently lifted it up ; and while Norman exclaimed at her tidiness , Margaret told how a new leaf was to be turned , and of her voluntary forfeits . '
147397	147402	147403	147403	We	3496	' cried the Doctor . '
147413	147414	147416	147416	you	3498	' '
147425	147429	147416	147416	you	3498	' exclaimed Harry . '
147471	147472	147443	147443	you	3498	' '
147484	147494	147481	147481	you	3498	' said Norman , with a gesture of disgust . '
147529	147530	147525	147525	you	300	' '
147540	147742	147525	147525	you	300	' cried Blanche , dancing with glee . Song . A great deal of merriment had come home with Harry , who never was grave for ten minutes without a strong reaction , and distracted the house with his noise and his antics , in proportion , as it sometimes seemed , to the spaces of serious thought and reading spent in the study , where Dr. May did his best to supply Mr. Ramsden 's insufficient attention to his Confirmation candidates , by giving an hour every day to Norman , Ethel , and Harry . He could not lecture , but he read with them , and his own earnestness was very impressive . The two eldest felt deeply , but Harry often kept it in doubt , whether he were not as yet too young and wild for permanent impressions , so rapid were his transitions , and so overpowering his high spirits . Not that these were objected to ; but there was a feeling that there might as well be moderation in all things , and that it would have been satisfactory if , under present circumstances , he had been somewhat more subdued and diligent . '
147753	147789	147751	147751	Harry	482	' For Harry being somewhat deficient in arithmetic , had been recommended to work in that line during his visit at home — an operation usually deferred , as at present , to the evening . '
147801	147841	147799	147799	Flora	280	' said Harry , somewhat annoyed . He really fetched his arithmetic , and his voice was soon heard asking how he was ever to put an end to a sum that would turn to nothing but everlasting threes . '
147851	147855	147857	147857	you	280	' asked Dr. May. '
147863	147864	147857	147857	you	280	' '
147870	147874	147865	147865	Flora	280	' said Ethel ; '
147901	147910	147893	147897	a London grand young lady	3502	' and Ethel shook her head in disgust . '
147921	147922	147916	147916	you	280	' '

148023	148028	148029	148029	I	0	' exclaimed the Doctor ; '
148060	148065	148054	148054	Margaret	249	' Flora looked dignified . '
148078	148106	148066	148066	They	3505	' said Harry—'Aught , aught , eight , that is eight thousandths , eh , Norman ! If it was about those two fellows , the boys — '
148107	148117	148119	148120	the Doctor	890	' You would harp only on what affects you ? '
148122	148142	148119	148120	the Doctor	890	' No , I do n't ; men never do . That is one hundred and twenty - fifth . '
148143	148157	148159	148160	Dr. May.	401	' One man does it to an hundred and twenty - five women ? '
148161	148171	148173	148173	Margaret	249	' It is rather a female defect , indeed , '
148175	148178	148180	148180	Flora	280	' Defect ! '
148182	148185	148187	148188	Dr. May	238	' Yes , '
148190	148211	148187	148188	Dr. May	238	' since it is not only irksome to the hearers , but leads to the breaking of the ninth commandment . '
148236	148240	148242	148243	Dr. May	238	' Andersons again ! '
148245	148259	148242	148243	Dr. May	238	' One , two , three , four , five , six forfeits ! '
148260	148270	148274	148274	Blanche	300	' Papa himself , for he said the name , '
148276	148290	148292	148292	Ethel	300	' I think I should like the rule to be made in earnest , '
148294	148307	148309	148309	Harry	257	' What ! in order to catch Flora 's pence for Cocksmoor ? '
148311	148352	148309	148309	Harry	257	' No , but because it is malice . I mean , that is , if there is dislike , or a grudge in our hearts at them — talking for ever of nasty little miserable irritations makes it worse . '
148353	148361	148363	148363	Flora	280	' Then why do you do it ? '
148365	148377	148363	148363	Flora	280	' I heard you only on Sunday declaiming about Fanny Anderson . '
148378	148381	148394	148394	She	280	' Ha ! '
148388	148393	148394	148394	She	280	' There goes Flora ! '
148401	148405	148407	148407	Ethel	300	' I know , '
148409	148441	148407	148407	Ethel	300	' It is the very reason I want the rule to be made , just to stop us , for I am sure we must often say more than is right . '
148442	148465	148467	148468	the Doctor	890	' Especially when we come to the pass of declaring that the ninth commandment can not be broken with regard to them , '
148470	148482	148484	148484	Richard	298	' Most likely they are saying much the same of us , '
148486	148490	148484	148484	Richard	298	' Or worse , '
148494	148505	148519	148519	Ethel	300	' The injured never hates as much as the injurer . '
148506	148517	148519	148519	Ethel	300	' Now papa has said the severest thing of all ! '
148521	148528	148530	148531	Dr. May	238	' Proving the inexpedience of personalities , '
148533	148554	148530	148531	Dr. May	238	' and in good time enter the evening post.—Why ! how now , Mr. May , are you gone mad ? '
148555	148565	148612	148612	Flora	280	' Hallo ! why ho , ha ! hurrah ! '
148604	148607	148610	148610	Ethel	300	' Harry ! '
148614	148621	148610	148610	Ethel	300	' see what you have done ; '
148637	148650	148623	148624	the Doctor	890	' Hear ! hear ! he has a fortune , an estate . '
148651	148664	148623	148624	the Doctor	890	' Who ? Tell us — don't be so absurd . Who ? '
148665	148681	148623	148624	the Doctor	890	' Why , Mr. Ernescliffe . Here is a letter from Hector . Only listen : '
148816	148859	148796	148796	I	0	' Ethel could not help looking at Margaret , but was ashamed of her impertinence , and coloured violently , whereas her sister did not colour at all , and Norman , looking down , wondered whether Alan would make the voyage . '
148870	148874	148867	148867	he	3512	' said Harry . '
148882	148927	148875	148875	He	3512	' Norman further wondered whether Hector would remain on the Stoneborough foundation , and Mary hoped they should not lose him ; but there was no great readiness to talk over the event , and there soon was a silence broken by Flora saying , '
148942	149027	148935	148936	Louisa Anderson	377	' Another shout , which caused Flora to take refuge in playing waltzes for the rest of the evening . Moreover , to the extreme satisfaction of Mary , she left her crochet - needle on the floor at night . While a tumultuous party were pursuing her with it to claim the penny , and Richard was conveying Margaret up - stairs , Ethel found an opportunity of asking her father if he were not very glad of Mr. Ernescliffe 's good fortune . '
149047	149048	149032	149032	He	3512	' '
149071	149154	149059	149059	you	7391	' She had no answer but a sigh , and a look that made her blush for having ventured so far . She was so much persuaded that great events must ensue , that , all the next day , she listened to every ring of the bell , and when one at last was followed by a light , though , to her ears , manly sounding tread , she looked up flushing with expectation . Behold , she was disappointed . '
149157	149355	149155	149156	Miss Walkingham	489	' was announced , and she rose surprised , for the lady in question had only come to Stoneborough for a couple of days with an infirm mother , who , having known Dr. May in old times , had made it her especial request that he would let her see his daughters . She was to proceed on her journey to - day , and the return of the visit had been by no means expected . Flora went forward to receive her , wondering to see her so young looking , and so unformed . She held out her hand , with a red wrist , and , as far as could be seen under her veil , coloured when presented to the recumbent Margaret . How she got into her chair , they hardly knew , for Flora was at that moment extremely annoyed by hearing an ill - bred peal of Mary 's laughter in the garden , close to the window ; but she thought it best to appear unconscious , since she had no power to stop it . Margaret thought the stranger embarrassed , and kindly inquired for Lady Walkingham . '
149363	149436	149155	149156	Miss Walkingham	489	' mumbled a voice down in the throat . A silence , until Margaret tried another question , equally briefly answered ; and , after a short interval , the young lady contrived to make her exit , with the same amount of gaucherie as had marked her entrance . Expressions of surprise at once began , and were so loud , that when Harry entered the room , his inquiry was , '
149442	149443	149444	149445	Miss Walkingham	489	' '
149447	149451	149444	149445	Miss Walkingham	489	' said Ethel , '
149467	149468	149458	149458	She	489	' '
149478	149482	149471	149471	you	3525	' asked Harry . '
149489	149493	149494	149494	She	489	' said Flora . '
149505	149506	149458	149458	She	489	' '
149517	149521	149509	149509	you	3525	' asked Harry . '
149529	149533	149509	149509	you	3525	' said Margaret . '
149541	149545	149546	149546	She	489	' said Flora . '
149571	149572	149565	149565	papa	218	' '
149581	149585	149576	149576	you	3525	' asked Harry . '
149596	149602	149576	149576	you	3525	' cried Flora , indignantly . '
149621	149625	149613	149613	she	489	' said Margaret . '
149642	149643	149626	149626	She	489	' '
149646	149669	149626	149626	She	489	' said Flora—'beauty and manners seemed to me much on a par ! This is one of papa 's swans , indeed ! '

So excited were the young people , that they did not perceive a step on the gravel , till Dr. May entered by the window , and stood among them . His first exclamation was of consternation . '
150684	150717	150790	150790	he	257	' Only then did her brother and sisters perceive that Margaret was lying back on her cushions , very pale , and panting for breath . She tried to smile and say , '

150880	150889	150878	150878	Flora	280	' and when you saw she was frightened — '
150890	150899	150901	150902	Dr. May	238	' I can have no more of this , '
150915	150947	150901	150902	Dr. May	238	' Go away to my study , sir , and wait till I come to you ! All of you out of the room — Flora , fetch the sal volatile . '

150958	150969	150956	150956	Margaret	249	' Do n't be angry with Harry . It was — '

151028	151052	151010	151010	she	249	' I do n't think I can be better till you have heard the rights of it . He did not mean it . '

151322	151345	151346	151346	he	257	' You seem to think you have a license to play off any impertinent freaks you please , without consideration for anyone , '
151349	151437	151346	151346	he	257	' but I tell you it is not so . As long as you are under my roof , you shall feel my authority , and you shall spend the rest of the day in your room . I hope quietness there will bring you to a better mind , but I am disappointed in you . A boy who can choose such a time , and such subjects , for insolent , unfeeling , practical jokes , can not be in a fit state for Confirmation . '

151475	151482	151484	151485	Dr. May.	401	' You have been as bad ! '
151486	151554	151346	151346	he	257	' I say nothing to you , Mary , you knew no better ; but , to see you , Ethel , first encouraging him in his impertinence , and terrifying Margaret so , that I dare say she may be a week getting over it , and now defending him , and calling her silly , is unbearable . I can not trust one of you ! '
151555	151561	151484	151485	Dr. May.	401	' Only listen , papa ! '
151562	151587	151346	151346	he	257	' I will have no altercation ; I must go back to Margaret , since no one else has the slightest consideration for her . '

151637	151643	151622	151622	Ethel	300	' What do you mean ? '
151644	151660	151484	151485	Dr. May.	401	' I can not bear to go down while poor Harry is so unjustly used . '

151667	151732	151622	151622	Ethel	300	' I can not hush ! Just because Margaret fancies robbers and murderers , and all sorts of nonsense , as she always did , is poor Harry to be accused of wantonly terrifying her , and shut up , and cut off from Confirmation ? and just when he is going away , too ! It is unkind , and unjust , and — '
151733	151741	151484	151485	Dr. May.	401	' Ethel , you will be sorry — '
151742	151748	151750	151750	Ethel	300	' Papa will be sorry , '
151756	151813	151750	151750	Ethel	300	' It is very unfair , and I will say so . It was all nonsense of Margaret 's , but he will always make everything give way to her ! And poor Harry , just going to sea . No , Ritchie , I can not come down ; I can not behave as usual . '
151814	151822	151824	151824	Richard	298	' You will grieve Margaret much more , '
151826	151842	151824	151824	Richard	298	' I ca n't help that — she should not have made such a fuss . '

151914	151937	151912	151912	Richard	298	' It is our duty not to question our father 's judgments . It would be wrong of you to stay up . '
151938	151941	151943	151943	Ethel	300	' Wrong ? '
151945	151958	151960	151960	Harry	257	' Of course . It would be against the articles of war , '
151968	151985	151960	151960	Harry	257	' But , Ritchie , I say , do tell me whether it has hurt Margaret . '
151986	151992	151994	151994	Richard	298	' She is better now , '
151996	152027	151994	151994	Richard	298	' but she has a head - ache , chiefly , I believe , from distress at having brought this on you . She is very sorry for her fright . '
152028	152046	152048	152048	Harry	257	' I had not the least intention of frightening the most fearsome little tender mouse on earth , '
152050	152055	152057	152057	Ethel	300	' No , indeed ! '
152059	152070	152072	152072	Richard	298	' And at another time it would not have signified , '
152115	152116	152109	152109	she	249	' '

152179	152183	152175	152175	Margaret	249	' said Richard , '

152201	152205	152199	152199	Ethel	300	' repeated Harry . '
152227	152250	152210	152210	Norman	227	' The voice was very much troubled , and it brought back that burning sensation of indignant tears to Ethel 's eyes . '
152265	152266	152210	152210	Norman	227	' '
152276	152280	152270	152270	you	300	' returned Harry . '
152303	152531	152298	152298	I	0	' The door shut , and they fancied they heard sobs . Ethel groaned , but made no opposition to following her brother down to tea . Margaret lay , wan and exhausted , on the sofa — the Doctor looked very melancholy and rather stern , and the others were silent . Ethel had began to hope for the warm re - action she had so often known after a hasty fit , but it did not readily come ; Harry was boy instead of girl — the fault and its consequence had been more serious — and the anxiety for the future was greater . Besides , he had not fully heard the story ; Harry , in his incoherent narration , had not excused himself , and Margaret 's panic had appeared more as if inspired by him , than , as it was , in fact , the work of her fancy . Thus the evening passed gloomily away , and it was not till the others had said good night , that Dr. May began to talk over the affair with his eldest son , who then was able to lay before him the facts of the case , as gathered from his sisters . He listened with a manner as though it were a reproof , and then said , sadly , '
152541	152542	152532	152532	I	0	' '
152550	152554	152548	152548	Harry	257	' said Richard , '

152570	152575	152562	152563	the Andersons	327	' said the Doctor , '

152605	152609	152610	152610	He	257	' said Richard . '
152613	152659	152610	152610	He	257	' and there Dr. May stopped short , and , taking up his candle , slowly mounted the stairs , and looked into Harry 's room . The boy was in bed , but started up on hearing his father 's step , and exclaimed , '
152671	152672	152675	152675	she	249	' '
152706	152707	152694	152694	your	257	' '
152710	152714	152694	152694	your	257	' interrupted Harry , '

152873	152874	152862	152862	you	257	' '

152885	152893	152862	152862	you	257	' sobbed Harry , hiding his face . '
152905	152910	152896	152896	I	0	' said the Doctor . '

152966	153003	152938	152940	these wild spirits	3563	' and Harry cried bitterly , and his father was deeply grieved , but no more could then be said , and they parted for the night — Dr. May saying , as he went away , '
153073	153213	153214	153214	his	3565	' And Dr. May went away , to mourn over what he viewed as far greater sins than those of his son . Anger had , indeed , given place to sorrow , and all were grave the next morning , as if each had something to be forgiven . Margaret , especially , felt guilty of the fears which , perhaps , had not been sufficiently combated in her days of health , and now were beyond control , and had occasioned so much pain . Ethel grieved over the words she had yesterday spoken in haste of her father and sister ; Mary knew herself to have been an accomplice in the joke , and Norman blamed himself for not having taken the trouble to perceive that Harry had not been talking rhodomontade , when he had communicated '
153217	153436	153214	153214	his	3565	' the previous morning . The decision as to the Confirmation was a great grief to all . Flora consoled herself by observing that , as he was so young , no one need know it , nor miss him ; and Ethel , with a trembling , almost sobbing voice , enumerated all Harry 's excellencies , his perfect truth , his kindness , his generosity , his flashes of intense feeling — declared that nobody ought to be Confirmed if he were not , and begged and entreated that Mr. Wilmot might be written to , and consulted . She would almost have done so herself , if Richard had not shown her that it would be undutiful . Harry himself was really subdued . He made no question as to the propriety of the decision , but rather felt his own unworthiness , and was completely humbled and downcast . When a note came from Mrs. Anderson , saying that she was convinced that it could not have been Dr. May 's wish that she should be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke , and that a young lady of the highest family should have been insulted , no one had spirits to laugh at the terms ; and when Dr. May said , '
153443	153456	153214	153214	his	3565	' Harry turned crimson , and was evidently trying to utter something . '
153470	153490	153457	153457	I	0	' said Dr. May — and a sound was heard , not very articulate , but expressing full assent . '
153495	153500	153457	153457	I	0	' said the Doctor . '
153507	153508	153501	153501	I	0	' '
153514	153625	153512	153512	you	0	' cried Harry , looking up . They set off at once . Mrs. Anderson was neither an unpleasing nor unkind person — her chief defect being a blind admiration of her sons and daughters , which gave her , in speaking of them , a tone of pretension that she would never have shown on her own account . Her displeasure was pacified in a moment by the sight of the confused contrition of the culprit , coupled with his father 's frank and kindly tone of avowal , that it had been a foolish improper frolic , and that he had been much displeased with him for it . '
153669	153684	153661	153661	you	401	' and , as something was said of going home to the early dinner , '
153713	153746	153748	153748	you	401	' Poor Mr. May ! to be called Master Harry , and treated to sweet cake ! But he saw his father thought he ought to endure , and he even said , '
153750	153820	153748	153748	you	401	' The cake stuck in his throat , however , when Mrs. Anderson and her daughters opened their full course of praise on their dear Harvey , and dearest Edward , telling all the flattering things Dr. Hoxton had said of the order into which Harvey had brought the school , and insisting on Dr. May 's reading the copy of the testimonial that he had carried to Oxford . '
153831	153836	153823	153823	you	401	' said Mrs. Anderson , '
153894	153895	153896	153896	I	0	' '
153905	154053	153896	153896	I	0	' was all that the Doctor could bring himself to say ; and thinking that he and his son had endured quite enough , he took his leave as soon as Harry had convulsively bolted the last mouthful . Not a word was spoken all the way home . Harry 's own trouble had overpowered even this subject of resentment . On Sunday , the notice of the Confirmation was read . It was to take place on the following Thursday , and all those who had already given in their names , were to come to Mr. Ramsden to apply for their tickets . While this was read , large tear - drops were silently falling on poor Harry 's book . Ethel and Norman walked together in the twilight , in deep lamentation over their brother 's deprivation , which seemed especially to humble them ; '
154056	154060	153896	153896	I	0	' said Norman , '
154087	154088	154077	154077	he	3573	' '

154212	154276	154205	154207	no one else	9232	' said Ethel . Meanwhile , Harry and Mary were sitting twisted together into a sort of bundle , on the same footstool , by Margaret 's sofa . Harry had begged of her to hear him say the Catechism once more , and Mary had joined with him in the repetition . There was to be only one more Sunday at home . '
154280	154317	154205	154207	no one else	9232	' he said , and sighed . Margaret knew what he meant , for the Feast was to be spread for those newly admitted to share it . She only said a caressing word of affection . '

154578	154588	154576	154576	Harry	278	' Margaret said , at last—'not in impossible cases . '
154589	154668	154576	154576	Harry	278	' Yes , if it had been impossible , but it was not ; if I had not been a mad goose all this time , but when a bit of fun gets hold of me , I ca n't think . And if I am too bad for that , I am too bad for — for — and I shall never see mamma again ! Margaret , it almost makes me af — afraid to sail . '
154669	154680	154682	154682	Mary	220	' Harry , do n't , do n't talk so ! '
154684	154732	154733	154733	She	220	' O do come to papa , and let us beg and pray . Take hold of my hand , and Margaret will beg too , and when he sees how sorry you are , I am sure he will forgive , and let you be Confirmed . '
154741	154746	154748	154748	Harry	278	' No , Mary , '
154753	154818	154748	154748	Harry	278	' It is not that he does not forgive . You do n't understand . It is what is right . And he can not help it , or make it right for me , if I am such a horrid wretch that I ca n't keep grave thoughts in my head . I might do it again after that , just the same . '
154819	154828	154830	154830	Mary	220	' You have been grave enough of late ! '
154832	154841	154843	154843	Harry	278	' this was enough to make me so , '
154845	154894	154843	154843	Harry	278	' but even at Church , since I came home , I have behaved ill ! I kicked Tom , to make him look at old Levitt asleep , and then I went on , because he did not like it . I know I am too idle . '

154995	155011	155012	155012	Harry	278	' Yes , papa wrote to ask what Mr. Wilmot thought , and he said — '

155276	155325	155266	155266	Flora	280	' I wish we had put Ethel into a veil ! There is Meta all white from head to foot , with such a veil ! and Ethel , in her little white cap , looks as if she might be Lucy Taylor , only not so pretty . '
155326	155350	155352	155352	Margaret	249	' Mamma thought the best rule was to take the dress that needs least attention from ourselves , and will be least noticed , '
155354	155370	155372	155372	Mary	220	' There is Fanny Anderson gone by in the fly with a white veil on ! '
155377	155387	155389	155389	Flora	280	' Then I am glad Ethel has not one , '
155472	155482	155483	155483	she	280	' Making the children think me worldly and frivolous ! '
155486	155505	155483	155483	she	280	' as if Margaret did not know that I think and feel as much as any reasonable person ! '
155552	155589	155540	155540	Ethel	300	' Ritchie , do you know what the Bishop 's text was ? " No man having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . " '
155590	155593	155595	155595	Richard	298	' Yes ? '
155599	155610	155612	155612	Ethel	300	' I thought it might be a voice to me , '
155614	155658	155612	155612	Ethel	300	' besides what it says to all , about our Christian course . It seems to tell me not to be out of heart about all those vexations at Cocksmoor . Is it not a sort of putting our hand to the plough ? '
155671	155680	155681	155681	he	238	' It was a beautiful thing to watch , '
155684	155818	155681	155681	he	238	' the faces of our own set . Those four were really like a poem . There was little Meta in her snowy whiteness , looking like innocence itself , hardly knowing of evil , or pain , or struggle , as that soft earnest voice made her vow to be ready for it all , almost as unscathed and unconscious of trial , as when they made it for her at her baptism — pretty little thing — may she long be as happy . And for our own Ethel , she looked as if she was promising on and on , straight into eternity . I heard her " I do , " dear child , and it was in such a tone as if she meant to be ever doing . '
155819	155825	155659	155660	Dr. May	238	' And for the boys ? '
155826	155862	155681	155681	he	238	' There was Norman grave and steadfast , as if he knew what he was about , and was manfully and calmly ready — he might have been a young knight , watching his armour . '
155863	155869	155871	155871	Margaret	249	' And so he is ! '
155875	155880	155871	155871	Margaret	249	' And poor Harry ? '
155891	155940	155881	155882	The Doctor	890	' Poor Harry , he was last of all , he turned his back and looked into the corner of the seat , till all the voices had spoken , and then turned about in haste , and the two words came on the end of a sob . '
155941	155951	155953	155953	Margaret	249	' You will not keep him away on Sunday ? '
155955	155974	155953	155953	Margaret	249	' Far be it from me . I know not who should come , if he should not . '
155975	155982	155984	155984	Dr.	238	' I could not help it , '

156053	156178	156048	156048	Blanche	300	' There were transports till it was recollected , that on Thursday morning school would recommence , and that on Friday Harry must join his ship . However , the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires , and Margaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy , so she would not hear of anyone remaining to keep her company , talked of the profit she should gain by a leisure day , and took ardent interest in everyone 's preparations and expectations , in Ethel 's researches into county histories and classical dictionaries , Flora 's sketching intentions , Norman 's promises of campanula glomerata , and a secret whispered into her ear by Mary and Harry . '
156183	156539	156179	156179	Meta	402	' as they said , when the August sun rose fresh and joyous ; and great was the unnecessary bustle , and happy confusion , from six o'clock till eleven , when Dr. May , who was going to visit patients some way further on the same road , carried off Harry and Mary , to set them down at the place . The rest were called for by Mr. Rivers 's carriage and break . Mrs. Charles Wilmot and her little girl were the only additions to the party , and Meta , putting Blanche into the carriage to keep company with her contemporary , went herself in the break . What a brilliant little fairy she was , in her pink summer robes , fluttering like a butterfly , and with the same apparent felicity in basking in joy , all gaiety , glee , and light - heartedness in making others happy . On they went , through honey - suckled lanes , catching glimpses of sunny fields of corn falling before the reaper , and happy knots of harvest folks dining beneath the shelter of their sheaves , with the sturdy old green umbrella sheltering them from the sun . Snatches of song , peals of laughter , merry nonsense , passed from one to the other ; Norman , roused into blitheness , found wit , the young ladies found laughter , and Richard 's eyes and mouth looked very pretty , as they smiled their quiet diversion . At last , his face drawn all into one silent laugh , he directed the eyes of the rest to a high green mound , rising immediately before them , where stood two little figures , one with a spy - glass , intently gazing the opposite way . At the same time came the halt , and Norman , bounding out , sprang lightly and nimbly up the side of the mound , and , while the spy - glass was yet pointed full at Wales , had hold of a pair of stout legs , and with the words , '
156546	156857	156179	156179	Meta	402	' had tumbled Mr. May headforemost down the grassy slope , with Mary rolling after . Harry 's first outcry was for his precious glass — his second was , not at his fall , but that they should have come from the east , when , by the compass , Stoneborough was north - north - west . And then the boys took to tumbling over one another , while Meta frolicked joyously , with Nipen after her , up and down the mounds , chased by Mary and Blanche , who were wild with glee . By - and - by she joined Ethel , and Norman was summoned to help them to trace out the old lines of encampment , ditch , rampart , and gates — happy work on those slopes of fresh turf , embroidered with every minute blossom of the moor — thyme , birdsfoot , eyebright , and dwarf purple thistle , buzzed and hummed over by busy , blacktailed , yellow - banded dumbledores , the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces , and the expanse of country - wooded hill , verdant pasture , amber harvest - field , winding river , smoke - canopied town , and brown moor , melting greyly away to the mountain heads . Now in sun , now in shade , the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old banks , and talked wisely of vallum and fossa , of legion and cohort , of Agricola and Suetonius , and discussed the delightful probability , that this might have been raised in the war with Caractacus , whence , argued Ethel , since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus , it must have been the very spot where Imogen met Posthumus again . Was not yonder the very high road to Milford Haven , and thus must not '
156863	156906	156907	156907	they	3614	' be in the immediate neighbourhood ? Then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal like an ancient tomb , where , as Blanche interposed with some of the lore lately caught from Ethel 's studies , '
156916	156945	156907	156907	they	3614	' while Norman observed it was the more probable , as fair Fidele never was buried at all . The idea of a search enchanted the young ladies . '
156956	157112	156907	156907	they	3614	' said Norman , looking at Harry , who had been particularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored ; and Meta declared that if they could but find the least trace , her papa would be delighted to go regularly to work , and reveal all the treasures . Richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure - trove , but he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices , and dispossessed of the trowel , which he had brought to dig up some down - gentians for the garden . While Norman set to work as pioneer , some skipped about in wild ecstasy , and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole . Very soon there was a discovery — an eager outcry — some pottery ! Roman vessels — a red thing that might have been a lamp , another that might have been a lachrymatory . '
157115	157119	156907	156907	they	3614	' said Ethel , '
157146	157147	157125	157125	I	0	' '
157153	157161	157125	157125	I	0	' said Norman , holding it up . '

157189	157193	157194	157194	she	3618	' added Harry ; '
157201	157202	157194	157194	she	3618	' '
157215	157227	157209	157209	you	3615	' said Meta , taking the derided vessels into her hands . '
157246	157391	157244	157244	Flora	280	' Flora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh , and still more exciting discovery — a coin , actually a medal , with the head of an emperor upon it — not a doubt of his high nose being Roman . Meta was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her father 's gems . Ethel was resolved that he should be Claudius , and began decyphering the defaced inscription THVRVS . She tried Claudius 's whole torrent of names , and , at last , made it into a contraction of Tiberius , which highly satisfied her . Then Meta , in her turn , read D. V. X. , which , as Ethel said , was all she could wish — of course it was dux et imperator , and Harry muttered into Norman 's ear , '
157396	157412	157244	157244	Flora	280	' and then heaved a sigh , as he thought of the Dux no longer . '
157416	157420	157244	157244	Flora	280	' continued Meta , '
157426	157427	157244	157244	Flora	280	' '
157435	157439	157244	157244	Flora	280	' said Flora . '

157485	157486	157468	157468	she	510	' '
157491	157537	157468	157468	she	510	' suggested Norman , gravely . But Ethel was sure that could not be , because there was no dipthong ; and a fresh theory was just being started , when Blanche 's head was thrust in to know what made them all so busy . '
157557	157802	157544	157544	you	300	' Poor Meta and Ethel , what a downfall ! Meta was sure that Norman had known it the whole time , and he owned to having guessed it from Harry 's importunity for the search . Harry and Mary had certainly made good use of their time , and great was the mirth over the trap so cleverly set — the more when it was disclosed that Dr. May had been a full participator in the scheme , had suggested the addition of the pottery , had helped Harry to some liquid to efface part of the most inscription , and had even come up with them to plant the snare in the most plausible corner for researches . Meta , enchanted with the joke , flew off to try to take in her governess and Mrs. Wilmot , whom she found completing their leisurely promenade , and considering where they should spread the dinner . The sight of those great baskets of good fare was appetizing , and the company soon collected on the shady turf , where Richard made himself extremely useful , and the feast was spread without any worse mishap than Nipen 's running away with half a chicken , of which he was robbed , as Tom reported , by a surly looking dog that watched in the outskirts of the camp , and caused Tom to return nearly as fast as the poor little white marauder . Meta '
157806	157893	157544	157544	you	300	' as Norman told her , comforted Nipen with a large share of her sandwiches . Harry armed himself with a stick , and Mary with a stone , and marched off to the attack , but saw no signs of the enemy , and had begun to believe him a figment of Tom 's imagination , when Mary spied him under a bush , lying at the feet of a boy , with whom he was sharing the spoil . Harry called out rather roughly , '
157902	157940	157898	157898	you	3621	' The boy jumped up , the dog growled , Mary shrank behind her brother , and begged him not to be cross to the poor boy , but to come away . Harry repeated his question . '
157951	157952	157945	157945	Toby	513	' '
157960	157961	157964	157964	Sir	7572	' '

158136	158675	158129	158129	I	0	' The boy was desired to wait while the brother and sister , in breathless excitement , rushed back with their story . Mrs. Wilmot was at first inclined to fear that the naval part of it had been inspired by Harry 's uniform , but the examination of Jem Jennings put it beyond a doubt that he spoke nothing but the truth ; and the choicest delight of the feast was the establishing him and Toby behind the barrow , and feeding them with such viands as they had probably never seen before . The boy could not read writing , but he had his father 's letter in his pocket , and Mary capered at the delightful coincidence , on finding that Jem Jennings was actually a quarter - master on board the Alcestis . It gave a sort of property in the boy , and she almost grudged Meta the having been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey , instead of doing it by subscription . However , Mary had a consolation , she would offer to take charge of Toby , who , as Harry observed , would otherwise have been drowned — he could not be taken on board . To be sure , he was a particularly ugly animal , rough , grisly , short - legged , long - backed , and with an apology for a tail — but he had a redeeming pair of eyes , and he and Jem lived on terms of such close friendship , that he would have been miserable in leaving him to the mercy of Nanny Brooks . So , after their meal , Jem and Toby were bidden to wait for Dr. May 's coming , and fell asleep together on the green bank , while the rest either sketched , or wandered , or botanized . Flora acted the grown - up lady with Mrs. Wilmot , and Meta found herself sitting by Ethel , asking her a great many questions about Margaret , and her home , and what it could be like to be one of such a numerous family . Flora had always turned aside from personal matters , as uninteresting to her companion , and , in spite of Meta 's admiration , and the mutual wish to be intimate , confidence did not spring up spontaneously , as it had done with the Doctor , and , in that single hour , with Margaret . Blunt as Ethel was , her heartiness of manner gave a sense of real progress in friendship . Their Confirmation vows seemed to make a link , and Meta 's unfeigned enthusiasm for the Doctor was the sure road to Ethel 's heart . She was soon telling how glad Margaret was that he had been drawn into taking pleasure in to - day 's scheme , since , not only were his spirits tried by the approach of Harry 's departure , but he had , within the last few days , been made very sad by reading and answering Aunt Flora 's first letter on the news of last October 's misfortune .

But they had not gone far before they saw another palace , much finer , all glittering with gold and silver , and their Lady Gloria came out to meet them , not in her white dress , but in one all gay and bright with fine colours , and her crown they now saw was of diamonds . She told them they had only seen her every - day dress and house , this was her best ; and she showed them about the castle , and all the pictures of her former lovers . There was Alexander , who had been nearer retaining her than anyone , only the fever prevented it ; there was Pyrrhus , always seeking her , but slain by a tile — Julius Cæsar — Tamerlane — all the rest , and she hoped that one of these two would really prove worthy and gain her , by going in the same path as these great people . " So our prince went home ; his head full of being like Alexander and all the rest of them , and he sent for his good old tutor to reckon up his armies , and see whom he could conquer in order to win her . But the old tutor told him he was under a mistake ; the second lady he had seen was a treacherous cousin of Gloria , who drew away her suitors by her deceits , and whose real name was Vana Gloria . If he wished to earn the true Gloria , he must set to work to do his subjects good , and to be virtuous . And he did ; he taught them , and he did justice to them , and he bore it patiently and kindly when they did not understand . But by - and - by , the other king , who had no good tutor to help him , had got his armies together , and conquered ever so many people , and drawn off their men to be soldiers ; and now he attacked the good prince , and was so strong , that he gained the victory , though both prince and subjects fought manfully with heart and hand ; but the battle was lost , and the faithful prince wounded and made prisoner , but bearing it most patiently , till he was dragged behind the other 's triumphal car with all the rest , when the three years were up , to be presented to Vana Gloria . And so he was carried into the forest , bleeding and wounded , and his enemy drove the car over his body , and stretched out his arms to Vana Gloria , and found her a vain , ugly wretch , who grew frightful as soon as he grasped her . But the good dying prince saw the beautiful beamy face of his lady - love bending over him . " Oh ! " he said , " vision of my life , hast thou come to lighten my dying eyes ? Never — never , even in my best days , did I deem that I could be worthy of thee ; the more I strove , the more I knew that Gloria is for none below — for me less than all . " '
162764	162797	162734	162734	she	3321	' Ethel 's language had become more flowing as she grew more eager in the tale , and they all listened with suspended interest . Norman asked where she got the story . '

163373	163386	163368	163368	I	0	' half whispered Meta , not without a trembling of the lip . '
163409	163899	163911	163911	she	3751	' The elder ladies had begun to look at watches , and talk of time to go home ; and Jem Jemmings having been seen rearing himself up from behind the barrow , the Doctor proceeded to investigate his case , was perfectly satisfied of the boy 's truth , and as ready as the young ones to befriend him . A letter should be written at once , desiring his father to look out for him on Friday , when he should go by the same train as Harry , who was delighted at the notion of protecting him so far , and begged to be allowed to drive him home to Stoneborough in the gig . Consent was given ; and Richard being added to give weight and discretion , the gig set out at once — the Doctor , much to Meta 's delight , took his place in the break . Blanche , who , in the morning , had been inclined to despise it as something akin to a cart , now finding it a popular conveyance , was urgent to return in it ; and Flora was made over to the carriage , not at all unwillingly , for , though it separated her from Meta , it made a senior of her . Norman 's fate conveyed him to the exalted seat beside the driver of the break , where he could only now and then catch the sounds of mirth from below . He had enjoyed the day exceedingly , with that sort of abandon more than ordinarily delicious to grave or saddened temperaments , when roused or drawn out for a time . Meta 's winning grace and sweetness had a peculiar charm for him , and , perhaps , his having been originally introduced to her as ill , and in sorrow , had given her manner towards him a sort of kindness which was very gratifying . And now he felt as if he was going back to a very dusky dusty world ; the last and blithest day of his holidays was past , and he must return to the misapprehensions and injustice that had blighted his school career , be kept beneath boys with half his ability , and without generous feeling , and find all his attainments useless in restoring his position . Dr. Hoxton 's dull scholarship would chill all pleasure in his studies — there would be no companionship among the boys — even his supporters , Ernescliffe and Larkins , were gone , and Harry would leave him still under a cloud . Norman felt it more as disgrace than he had done since the first , and wished he had consented to quit the school when it had been offered — be made a man , instead of suffering these doubly irksome provocations , which rose before him in renewed force . '
163916	163920	163911	163911	she	3751	' thought he . '
163977	164044	163956	163956	I	0	' So Norman repressed the sigh as he looked at the school buildings , which never could give him the pleasures of memory they afforded to others . The break had set out before the carriage , so that Meta had to come in and wait for her governess . Before the vehicle had disgorged half its contents , Harry had rushed out to meet them . '
164064	164088	164089	164089	Norman	227	' Is Mr. Ernescliffe come ? crossed Ethel 's mind , but Margaret was alone , flushed , and holding out her hands . '
164137	164596	164123	164123	he	3752	' Norman really trembled so much that he could neither speak nor stand , but sat down on the window - seat , while a confusion of tongues asked more . Dr. Hoxton and Mr. Larkins had come to call — heard no one was at home but Miss May — had , nevertheless , come in — and Margaret had heard that Mr. Larkins , who had before intended to remove his son from Stoneborough , had , in the course of the holidays , made discoveries from him , which he could not feel justified in concealing from Dr. Hoxton . The whole of the transactions with Ballhatchet , and Norman 's part in them , had been explained , as well as the true history of the affray in Randall 's alley — how Norman had dispersed the boys , how they had again collected , and , with the full concurrence of Harvey Anderson , renewed the mischief , how the Andersons had refused to bear witness in his favour , and how Ballhatchet 's ill - will had kept back the evidence which would have cleared him . Little Larkins had told all , and his father had no scruple in repeating it , and causing the investigation to be set on foot . Nay , he deemed that Norman 's influence had saved his son , and came as anxious to thank him , as Dr. Hoxton , warm - hearted , though injudicious , was to repair his injustice , They were much surprised and struck by finding that Dr. May had been aware of the truth the whole time , and had patiently put up with the injustice , and the loss of the scholarship — a loss which Dr. Hoxton would have given anything to repair , so as to have sent up a scholar likely to do him so much credit ; but it was now too late , and he had only been able to tell Margaret how dismayed he was at finding out that the boy to whom all the good order in his school was owing , had been so ill - used . Kind Dr. May 's first feeling really seemed to be pity and sympathy for his old friend , the head master , in the shock of such a discovery . Harry was vociferously telling his version of the story to Ethel and Mary . Tom stood transfixed in attention . Meta , forgotten and bewildered , was standing near Norman , whose colour rapidly varied , and whose breath came short and quick as he listened . A quick half interrogation passed Meta 's lips , heard by no one else . '
164606	164613	164614	164614	they	3754	' he answered , scarcely audibly ; '

164629	164643	164614	164614	they	3754	' said Meta , as she heard words that implied the past suspicion . '
164646	164650	164614	164614	they	3754	' said Norman , '

164693	164806	164685	164685	Harry	278	' Meta did not speak , but she held out her hand in hearty congratulation ; Norman , scarce knowing what he did , grasped and wrung it so tight , that it was positive pain , as he turned away his head to the window to struggle with those irrepressible tears . Meta 's colour flushed into her cheek as she found it still held , almost unconsciously perhaps , in his agitation , and she heard Margaret 's words , that both gentlemen had said Norman had acted nobly , and that every revelation made in the course of their examination , had only more fully established his admirable conduct . '
164817	164906	164810	164810	Norman	227	' cried Mary 's voice in the first pause , and , Margaret asking where he was , he suddenly turned round , recollected himself , and found it was not the back of the chair that he had been squeezing , blushed intensely , but made no attempt at apology , for indeed he could not speak — he only leant down over Margaret , to receive her heartfelt embrace ; and , as he stood up again , his father laid his hand on his shoulder , '

166937	166968	166935	166935	Ethel	300	' I know to be wayward and set on it would only hurt . I might only do more harm — I'll try . But oh ! my poor children . '
167109	167118	167087	167087	She	249	' Well , Ethel ! he is come . '
167119	167126	167127	167127	He	238	' Oh papa ! Mr. Ernes — '
167186	167191	167180	167180	she	249	' Is he here ? '
167192	167227	167180	167180	she	249	' At the Swan . He came last night , and watched for me this morning , as I came out of the hospital . We have been walking over the meadows to Fordholm . '
167237	167244	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' But is he not coming ? '
167248	167300	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' Yes , poor fellow ; but hush , stop , say nothing to the others . I must not have her agitated till she has had her dinner in peace , and the house is quiet . You know she can not run away to her room as you would . '
167301	167310	167312	167312	Ethel	300	' Then he is really come for that ? '
167324	167333	167312	167312	Ethel	300	' but why did he wait so long ? '
167334	167366	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' He wished to see his way through his affairs , and also wanted to hear of her from Harry . I am afraid poor July 's colours were too bright . '
167367	167381	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' And why did he come to the Swan instead of to us ? '
167382	167435	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' That was his fine , noble feeling . He thought it right to see me first , that if I thought the decision too trying for Margaret , in her present state , or if I disapproved of the long engagement , I might spare her all knowledge of his coming . '
167436	167444	167246	167246	Ethel	300	' Oh papa ! you wo n't ! '
167445	167521	167522	167522	He	3808	' I do n't know but that I ought — but yet — the fact is , that I can not . With that fine young fellow so generously , fondly attached , I can not find it in my heart to send him away for four years without seeing her , and yet , poor things , it might be better for them both . O Ethel , if your mother were but here ! '
167568	167573	167574	167574	he	3808	' One comfort is , '
167577	167593	167574	167574	he	3808	' that Margaret has more composure than I. Do you go to Cocksmoor this afternoon ? '
167594	167599	167549	167549	She	300	' I wished it . '
167600	167649	167574	167574	he	3808	' Take them all with you . You may tell them why when you are out . I must have the house quiet . I shall get Margaret out into the shade , and prepare her , as best I can , before he comes at three o'clock . '
167691	167703	167685	167685	Ethel	300	' Had not Flora better stay , to keep off company ? '
167704	167709	167711	167712	Dr. May	238	' No , no , '
167716	167722	167711	167712	Dr. May	238	' the fewer the better ; '
167769	167776	167778	167778	he	238	' You are going to Cocksmoor ! '
167785	167792	167794	167794	Richard	298	' It is the right day , '
167796	167803	167794	167794	Richard	298	' Are you coming , Flora ? '
167804	167818	167827	167828	the Doctor—'you	3811	' Not to - day , I have to call on Mrs. Hoxton . '
167819	167825	167827	167828	the Doctor—'you	3811	' Never mind Mrs. Hoxton , '
167844	167857	167827	167828	the Doctor—'you	3811	' He did not look as if he had found it so . '
167867	167871	167827	167828	the Doctor—'you	3811	' said Ethel , '
167876	167877	167878	167878	I	0	' '
167884	167888	167878	167878	I	0	' replied Flora . '
167897	167902	167903	167903	You	280	' said Miss Winter . '
167906	167910	167903	167903	You	280	' reiterated Ethel . '

167998	168064	167990	167990	you	0	' said Flora . Her movements were quickened however by her father , who , finding her with Margaret in the drawing - room , ordered her up - stairs in a peremptory manner , which she resented , as treating her like a child , and therefore proceeded in no amiable mood to the room , where Ethel awaited her in wild tumultuous impatienence . '
168075	168076	168067	168067	Ethel	300	' '
168096	168097	168087	168087	He	222	' '

168151	168164	168142	168142	papa	7391	' said Ethel , beginning to perceive the secret of her displeasure , '
168211	168212	168201	168201	Papa	218	' '
168216	168220	168201	168201	Papa	218	' said Flora , '

168269	168273	168257	168257	he	222	' said Flora , '
168356	168357	168358	168358	Flora	280	' '
168370	168371	168373	168373	he	222	' '
168419	168695	168415	168415	Blanche	300	' Ethel looked horrified by the assertion of independence , but Richard called her from below , and with one more fruitless entreaty , she ran down stairs . Richard had been hearing all from his father , and it was comfortable to talk the matter over with him , and hear explained the anxiety which frightened her , while she scarcely comprehended it ; how Dr. May could not feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an engagement which must depend on health so uncertain as poor Margaret 's , and how he dreaded the effect on the happiness of both . Ethel 's romance seemed to be turning to melancholy , and she walked on gravely and thoughtfully , though repeating that there could be no doubt of Margaret 's perfect recovery by the time of the return from the voyage . Her lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried , and even the sight of two very nice neat new scholars , of very different appearance from the rest , and of much superior attainments , only half interested her . Mary was enchanted at them as a pair of prodigies , actually able to read ! and had made out their names , and their former abodes , and how they had been used to go to school , and had just come to live in the cottage deserted by the lamented Una . Ethel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to Mary 's entreaties that they should go and call on this promising importation . Even the children 's information that they were taught now by '
168698	169175	168696	168697	Sister Cherry	531	' failed to attract her ; but Richard looked at his watch , and decided that it was too soon to go home , and she had to submit to her fate . Very different was the aspect of the house from the wild Irish cabin appearance that it had had in the M'Carthy days . It was the remains of an old farm - house that had seen better days , somewhat larger than the general run of the Cocksmoor dwellings . Respectable furniture had taken up its abode against the walls , the kitchen was well arranged , and , in spite of the wretched flooring and broken windows , had an air of comfort . A very tidy woman was bustling about , still trying to get rid of the relics of her former tenants , who might , she much feared , have left a legacy of typhus fever . The more interesting person was , however , a young woman of three or four - and - twenty , pale , and very lame , and with the air of a respectable servant , her manners particularly pleasing . It appeared that she was the daughter of a first wife , and , after the period of schooling , had been at service , but had been lamed by a fall down - stairs , and had been obliged to come home , just as scarcity of work had caused her father to leave his native parish , and seek employment at other quarries . She had hoped to obtain plain work , but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they had come , and anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the elder boy and girl might be admitted into the town school , distant as it was . At another time , the thought of Charity Elwood would have engrossed Ethel 's whole mind , now she could hardly attend , and kept looking eagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother . When , at last , they did set off , he would not let her gallop home like a steam - engine , but made her take his arm , when he found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps . At the long hill , a figure appeared , and , as soon as Richard was certified of its identity , he let her fly , like a bolt from a cross - bow , and she stood by Dr. May 's side . A little ashamed , she blushed instead of speaking , and waited for Richard to come up and begin . Neither did he say anything , and they paused till , the silence disturbing her , she ventured a '

169225	169226	169218	169218	he	7391	' '
169230	169234	169228	169228	Margaret	249	' cried Ethel . '
169242	169243	169238	169238	she	3827	' '
169284	169295	169275	169275	she	3827	' You are tempting me ! It would be selfishness . '
169296	169306	169275	169275	she	3827	' O dear ! she surely has seen him ! '
169307	169347	169246	169246	she	3827	' I told her that I would be the last person to wish to tempt her to selfishness , but that I did not think that either could be easy in settling such a matter through a third person . '
169348	169356	169358	169358	Ethel	300	' It would have been very unkind , '
169360	169369	169275	169275	she	3827	' I wonder she did not think so . '
169370	169420	169246	169246	she	3827	' She did at last . I saw it could not be otherwise , and she said , poor darling , that when he had seen her , he would know the impossibility ; but she was so agitated , that I did not know how it could be . '
169421	169425	169246	169246	she	3827	' Has she ? '
169426	169491	169246	169246	she	3827	' Aye , I told him not to stay too long , and left him under the tulip - tree with her . I found her much more composed — he was so gentle and considerate . Ah ! he is the very man ! Besides , he has convinced her now that affection brings him , not mere generosity , as she fancied . '
169492	169500	169502	169502	Ethel	300	' O , then it is settled ! '
169506	169567	169502	169502	Ethel	300	' I wish it were ! She has owned that if — if she were in health — but that is all , and he is transported with having gained so much ! Poor fellow . So far , I trust , it is better for them to know each other 's minds , but how it is to be — '
169568	169590	169246	169246	she	3827	' But , papa , you know Sir Matthew Fleet said she was sure to get well ; and in three years '
169593	169594	169246	169246	she	3827	' '
169643	169951	169635	169635	My	0	' he concluded , almost inaudibly . It was , indeed , to him , a time of great distress and perplexity , wishing to act the part of father and mother both towards his daughter , acutely feeling his want of calm decision , and torn to pieces at once by sympathy with the lovers , and by delicacy that held him back fro seeming to bind the young man to an uncertain engagement , above all , tortured by self - reproach for the commencement of the attachment , and for the misfortune that had rendered its prosperity doubtful . Ethel could find no words of comfort in the bewildered glimpse at his sorrow and agitation . Richard spoke with calmness and good sense , and his replies , though brief and commonplace , were not without effect in lessening the excitement and despondency which the poor Doctor 's present mood had been aggravating . At the door , Dr. May asked for Flora , and Ethel explained . If Flora had obtruded herself , he would have been irritated , but , as it was , he had no time to observe the disobedience , and saying that he hoped she was with Margaret , sent Ethel into the drawing - room . Flora was not there , only Margaret lay on her sofa , and Ethel hesitated , shy , curious , and alarmed ; but , as she approached , she was relieved to see the blue eyes more serene even than usual , while a glow of colour spread over her face , making her like the blooming Margaret of old times ; her expression was full of peace , but became somewhat amused at Ethel 's timid , awkward pauses , as she held out her hands , and said , '

169965	169996	169963	169963	Margaret	249	' And Ethel was drawn into her sister 's bosom . Presently she drew back , gazed at her sister inquiringly , and said in an odd , doubtful voice , '
170002	170018	169998	169998	you	249	' Margaret nearly laughed at the strange manner , but spoke with a sorrowful tone , '

170042	170047	170037	170037	I	0	' again said Ethel ; '

170076	170082	170073	170073	I	0	' and her voice trembled . '

170276	170282	170269	170269	you	0	' said Ethel , wistfully . '

170395	170578	170388	170388	Jane	445	' This message quickened Ethel , and after giving it , and reporting consolingly to her father , she went up to Flora , who had been a voluntary prisoner up - stairs all this time , and was not peculiarly gratified at such tidings coming only through the medium of Ethel . She had before been sensible that , superior in discretion and effectiveness as she was acknowledged to be , she did not share so much of the confidence and sympathy as some of the others , and she felt mortified and injured , though in this case it was entirely her own fault . The sense of alienation grew upon her . She dressed quickly , and hurried down , that she might see Margaret alone , but the room was already prepared for tea , and the children were fast assembling . Ethel came down a few minutes after , and found Blanche claiming Alan Ernescliffe as her lawful property , dancing round him , chattering , and looking injured if he addressed a word to anyone else . '
171803	171812	171813	171813	She	7905	' I give you joy , my dear . '
171854	171862	171864	171865	Dr. May	238	' You will show it to Alan , '

171914	171934	171909	171909	he	293	' but you will rest on him , and be happy together while he stays , will you not ? '
171935	171943	171944	171945	Mr. Ernescliffe	222	' Indeed I will , dear papa . '
171962	171965	171966	171966	she	249	' But , '
171971	171981	171966	171966	she	249	' I see that papa does not believe it . '
171982	171990	171991	171991	he	293	' You promised to abide by it ! '
171999	172012	171991	171991	he	293	' I do ; if you choose so to risk your hopes . '

172028	172053	172021	172021	he	293	' there can be no doubt ! These words are as certain as language can make them . Why will you not trust them ? '
172054	172062	171991	171991	he	293	' I see that papa does not . '
172063	172087	171991	171991	he	293	' Despondency and self - reproach make him morbidly anxious . Believe so , my Margaret ! You know he is no surgeon ! '
172088	172095	172097	172097	Margaret	249	' His education included that line , '
172099	172121	172122	172122	she	249	' I believe he has all but the manual dexterity . However , I would fain have faith in Sir Matthew , '
172127	172145	172122	172122	she	249	' and perhaps I am only swayed by the habit of thinking that papa must know best . '
172146	172207	171991	171991	he	293	' He does in indifferent cases ; but it is an old axiom , that a medical man should not prescribe for his own family ; above all , in such a case , where it is but reasonable to believe an unprejudiced stranger , who alone is cool enough to be relied on . I absolutely depend on him ! '
172219	172222	172223	172223	she	249	' Yes , '
172226	172250	172223	172223	she	249	' we will try to make papa take pleasure in the prospect . Perhaps I could do more if I made the attempt . '
172251	172278	171991	171991	he	293	' I am sure you could , if you would let me give you more support . If I were but going to remain with you ! '
172279	172287	172289	172289	Margaret	249	' Do n't let us be discontented , '
172293	172322	172289	172289	Margaret	249	' when so much more has been granted than I dare to hope . Be it as it may , let us be happy in what we have . '
172323	172329	172331	172331	he	3878	' It makes you happy ? '
173092	173140	173090	173090	Ethel	300	' Thank you ! Oh , this is charming ! We could set up a regular school ! Cherry Elwood is the very woman ! Alan , you have made our fortune ! Oh ! Margaret ! Margaret ! I must go and tell Ritchie and Mary ! '

174734	174798	174732	174732	Ethel	300	' Yes , Ma'am , it made the day go on well like , and settled a body 's mind , when I fretted for what could not be helped . But I try not to fret after it now , and Mr. Hazlewood said , if I did my best wherever I was , the Lord would still join our prayers together . '
175536	175540	175534	175534	Cherry	532	' outrageous dullness . '

175949	176011	176012	176012	Margaret	249	' Yes , Ma'am . I have a great deal to be thankful for . I do n't blame no one , but I do see how some , as are married , seem to get to think more of this world ; and now and then I fancy I can see how it is best for me as it is . '
176025	176082	176016	176016	she	249	' Then , Ma'am , there has been such goodness ! I did vex at being a poor helpless thing , nothing but a burthen on father ; and when we had to go from home , and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood and all , I ca n't tell you how bad it was , Ma'am . '
176083	176090	176012	176012	Margaret	249	' Then you are comforted now ? '
176091	176096	176098	176098	Cherry	532	' Yes , Ma'am , '
176102	176147	176098	176098	Cherry	532	' It seems as if He had given me something to do , and there are you and Mr. Richard , and Miss Ethel , to help . I should like , please God , to be of some good to those poor children . '

It remaineth that both they that have wives , be as they that have none , and they that weep , as though they wept not , and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ! If ever Alan and I have a home together upon earth , may all too confident joy be tempered by the fears that we have begun with ! I hope this probation may make me less likely to be taken up with the cares and pleasures of his position , than I might have been last year . He is one who can best help the mind to go truly upward ! But , oh ! that voyage ! '

180077	180131	179963	179963	Margaret	249	' No , Flora , that is not the case . Neither she nor papa would ever be unfair ; but , as she would say herself , what they ca n't help , they ca n't help ; and , as she grows older , she must surpass me more and more . '
180132	180138	179963	179963	Margaret	249	' And you like it ? '
180139	180171	180172	180172	Margaret	249	' I like it — when — when I think of papa , and of his dear , noble Ethel . I do like it , when I am not selfish . '
180184	180189	180190	180190	she	249	' Only , Flora , '
180193	180237	180190	180190	she	249	' pray do not say one word of this , on any account , to Ethel . She is so happy with papa , and I would not , for anything , have her think I feel neglected , or had any jealousy . '
180238	180241	180243	180243	Flora	280	' Ah , '
180245	180279	180243	180243	Flora	280	' you can give up sweetly , but you have Alan to fall back upon . Now I , who certainly have the best right , and a great deal more practical sense — '
180346	180351	180343	180343	Ethel	300	' You have them ? '
180352	180355	180357	180357	he	227	' Yes ; '
180389	180416	180383	180383	he	227	' Norman Walter , son of Richard and Margaret May , High - street , Doctor of Medicine , December 21st , 18 — Thomas Ramsden . '
180417	180425	180434	180434	she	300	' What is that for , Norman ? '
180448	180451	180453	180454	Dr. May	238	' Ha ! '
180456	180480	180453	180454	Dr. May	238	' this is capital ! The old Doctor seems not to know how to say enough for you . Have you read it ? '
180481	180502	180543	180543	nurse	7474	' No , he only told me he had said something in my favour , and wished me all success . '
180503	180506	180508	180508	Mary	220	' Success ! '
180510	180524	180508	180508	Mary	220	' Oh , Norman , you are not going to sea , too ? '
180525	180530	180532	180532	Blanche	300	' No , no ! '
180561	180562	180543	180543	nurse	7474	' '
180565	180569	180543	180543	nurse	7474	' said Mary , '
180579	180580	180543	180543	nurse	7474	' '
180586	180590	180591	180591	people	839	' persisted Blanche , '
180629	180630	180621	180621	nurse	7474	' '
180647	180658	180635	180635	I	0	' said Dr. May — much diverted with the young ladies '
180661	180667	180669	180669	Mary	220	' But is it really ? '
180680	180685	180669	180669	Mary	220	' Is it really ? '
180718	180719	180721	180721	them	4093	' '
180723	180748	180721	180721	them	4093	' whispered Norman , a good deal out of countenance , as he leant over Ethel , and quitted the room . Ethel cried , '
180752	180913	180721	180721	them	4093	' and looked at her father , while Blanche and Mary reiterated inquiries — marriage , and going to sea , being the only events that , in their imagination , the world could furnish . Going to try for a Balliol scholarship ! It was a sad falling off , even if they understood what it meant . The Doctor 's explanations to Margaret had a tone of apology for having kept her in ignorance , and Flora said few words , but felt herself injured ; she had nearly gone to Mrs. Hoxton that afternoon , and how strange it would have been if anything had been said to her of her own brother 's projects , when she was in ignorance . Ethel slipped away to her brother , who was in his own room , surrounded with books , flushed and anxious , and trying to glance over each subject on which he felt himself weak . '
180923	180928	180918	180918	I	0	' was his exclamation . '
180938	180939	180931	180931	I	0	' '
180952	180959	180943	180944	Dr. Hoxton	269	' cried Ethel , in consternation . '
180998	180999	181000	181000	You	0	' '
181006	181007	181000	181000	You	0	' '
181027	181028	181014	181014	My	0	' '
181049	181050	181051	181051	I	0	' '
181091	181280	181084	181084	me	0	' So they went on , Ethel doing her best to help and encourage , and Norman in an excited state of restless despair , which drove away half his senses and recollection , and his ideas of the superior powers of public school - boys magnifying every moment . They were summoned down - stairs to prayers , but went up again at once , and more than an hour subsequently , when their father paid one of his domiciliary visits , there they still were , with their Latin and Greek spread out , Norman trying to strengthen all doubtful points , but , in a desperate desultory manner , that only confused him more and more , till he was obliged to lay his head down on the table , shut his eyes , and run his fingers through his hair , before he could recollect the simplest matter ; his renderings alternated with groans , and , cold as was the room , his cheeks and brows were flushed and burning . The Doctor checked all this , by saying , gravely and sternly , '
181294	181295	181296	181296	I	0	' '
181316	181317	181321	181321	you	227	' '
181325	181337	181321	181321	you	227	' said Dr. May , laying his hand on his shoulder . '
181352	181361	181346	181346	you	4098	' said Norman , hesitating in some confusion . '
181369	181373	181362	181362	I	0	' said Dr. May. '
181381	181385	181387	181387	he	238	' said Ethel . '
181390	181399	181387	181387	he	238	' The boy and girl were both silent . '
181411	181416	181401	181401	you	227	' continued his father . '
181421	181425	181401	181401	you	227	' murmured Norman . '
181463	181464	181514	181514	papa	7391	' '
181471	181511	181514	181514	papa	7391	' said Norman , with trembling voice , almost as if he could have burst into tears . He was quite unnerved by the anxiety and toil with which he had overtasked himself , beyond his father 's knowledge . '
181516	181529	181514	181514	papa	7391	' pleaded Ethel , who could not bear to see him pained . '
181534	181549	181514	181514	papa	7391	' continued Dr. May , who felt it was the moment for bracing severity . '
181560	181569	181514	181514	papa	7391	' Again Ethel made an exclamation of entreaty . '
181577	181597	181574	181574	I	0	' repeated Norman ; but you do n't know what is to get into the spirit of the thing . '
181598	181606	181608	181609	the Doctor	890	' Do you think I do not ? '
181611	181641	181608	181609	the Doctor	890	' I can tell exactly what you feel now . If I had not been an idle dog , I should have gone through it all many more times . '
181642	181648	181650	181650	Norman	227	' What shall I do ? '
181659	181678	181650	181650	Norman	227	' Put all this out of your mind , sleep quietly , and do n't open another book . '
181692	181703	181705	181706	Dr. May	238	' I will read you something to calm your tone , '
181718	181818	181819	181819	Norman	227	' Know ye not , that they which run in a race , run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run that ye may obtain . And every man that striveth for the mastery , is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible . " And , Norman , that is not the struggle where the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong ; nor the contest , where the conqueror only wins vanity and vexation of spirit . '
182135	182140	182142	182143	the Doctor	890	' Only a patient , '
182167	182173	182184	182184	him	890	' Well , old fellow ? '
182200	182206	182207	182210	The mass of children	4111	' I have got it . '
182218	182224	182207	182210	The mass of children	4111	' He has got it ! '
182241	182248	182250	182250	Margaret	249	' A happy face at least , '
182446	182449	182451	182451	Richard	298	' Indeed , '
182453	182480	182451	182451	Richard	298	' I fancy the men had never believed that I could have a clever brother . I am glad they have seen what Norman can do . '
182656	182665	182666	182666	he	227	' And how has Tom been getting on ? '
182676	182684	182686	182686	Ethel	300	' Oh ! I do n't know , '
182688	182696	182686	182686	Ethel	300	' He will not have my help . '
182697	182704	182706	182706	Norman	548	' Not let you help him ? '
182708	182718	182720	182720	Ethel	300	' No . He says he wants no girls , '
182724	182728	182730	182730	Norman	548	' Foolish fellow ! '
182732	182743	182730	182730	Norman	548	' I wonder what sort of work he has made ! '
182744	182752	182754	182754	Ethel	300	' Very funny , I should think , '
182756	182765	182754	182754	Ethel	300	' judging by the verses I could see . '
182859	182870	182834	182834	Norman	548	' Come , August , how have things gone on ? '
182871	182879	182834	182834	Norman	548	' Oh ! I do n't know . '
182880	182886	182834	182834	Norman	548	' What 's your place ? '
182887	182890	182892	182892	Tom	238	' Thirteenth ! '
183182	183183	183168	183168	Mary	220	' '
183185	183188	183184	183184	Girls	1198	' work ! '
183197	183216	183184	183184	Girls	1198	' But Norman , and Richard , and Harry , always come to the reading . Everybody ought . '
183449	183472	183433	183434	Master Thomas	226	' You here ! Tom ! What have you hidden yourself here for ? What can make you so savage to Mary ? '
183473	183480	183482	183482	Tom	226	' She should not bother me , '
183524	183548	183521	183521	he	548	' That is the kindest , most forgiving little sister I ever did see . What possesses you to treat her so ill ? '
183549	183558	183521	183521	he	548	' I was n't going to hurt her . '
183559	183574	183521	183521	he	548	' But why drive her away ? Why do n't you come to read ? '
183618	183652	183599	183599	he	548	' Come ! there 's something wrong , and you will never be better till it is out . Tell me — don't be afraid . Those fellows have been at you again ? '
183675	183690	183653	183653	He	548	' So they have licked you ? Eh ? What have they been doing ? '
183691	183702	183704	183704	Tom	226	' They said they would spiflicate me if I told ! '
183706	183715	183704	183704	Tom	226	' They shall never do anything to you — '
184074	184079	184081	184081	Tom	226	' I knew it ! '
184083	184094	184081	184081	Tom	226	' None of you will ever speak to me again ! '
184095	184125	184126	184126	I	0	' You ! Why , August , man , I have better hopes of you than ever . You are more really sorry now than ever you were before . '
184136	184147	184126	184126	I	0	' said poor Tom , feeling his future life stained . '
184153	184154	184126	184126	I	0	' '
184160	184170	184171	184171	Tom	226	' and the poor victim 's voice died away . '
184213	184263	184202	184203	Those scamps	4152	' It did not produce the ecstasy Norman had expected . The boy still sat on the ground , staring at his brother , as if the good news hardly penetrated the gloom ; and , after a disappointing silence , recurred to the most immediate cause of distress : '
184311	184312	184313	184313	I	0	' '
184324	184331	184313	184313	I	0	' said Norman , rather angrily . '
184346	184347	184338	184338	you	548	' '
184361	184368	184349	184349	you	548	' asked Tom , in alarm . '
184382	184386	184378	184378	they	4152	' said Norman ; '
184403	184404	184388	184388	I	0	' '
184431	184651	184425	184425	Norman	548	' Norman assured him that there was not the slightest reason that these passages should ever come to the knowledge of his sisters . Tom was excessively afraid of his father , but he could not well be more wretched than he was already ; and he was brought to assent when Norman showed him that he had never been happy since the affair of the blotting - paper , when his father 's looks and tones had become objects of dread to his guilty conscience . Was not the only means of recovering a place in papa 's esteem to treat him with confidence ? Tom answered not , and would only shudder when his brother took upon him to declare that free confession would gain pardon even for the doings at the Green Man . Tom had grown stupified and passive , and his sole dependence was on Norman , so , at last , he made no opposition when his brother offered to conduct him to his father and speak for him . The danger now was that Dr. May should not be forthcoming , and the elder brother was as much relieved , as the younger was dismayed , to see , through the drawing - room window , that he was standing beside Margaret . '
184662	184666	184655	184655	you	218	' said Norman , '
184671	184672	184655	184655	you	218	' '
184678	184687	184690	184690	Tom	238	' said the Doctor , entering the hall . '
184699	184745	184690	184690	Tom	238	' as he saw the poor child , white , cold , almost sick with apprehension , with every pulse throbbing , and looking positively ill . He took the chilly , damp hand , which shook nervously , and would fain have withdrawn itself . '
184758	184791	184752	184752	us	4158	' and before Tom knew what he was doing , he had seated him on his knee , in the arm - chair in the study , and was feeling his pulse . '
184806	184807	184808	184808	I	0	' '
184816	184820	184808	184808	I	0	' said Norman ; '
184833	184920	184825	184825	he	7382	' Tom would fain have been on his feet , yet the support of that shoulder was inexpressibly comfortable to his aching temples , and he could not but wait for the shock of being roughly shaken and put down . So , as his brother related what had occurred , he crouched and trembled more and more on his father 's breast , till , to his surprise , he found the other arm passed round him in support , drawing him more tenderly close . '
184926	184939	184825	184825	he	7382	' said Dr. May , trying to look into the drooping face , '
184960	184961	184952	184952	I	0	' '
184967	184980	184981	184981	I	0	' said Norman , much distressed by the condition of the culprit . '
184990	184994	184985	184985	I	0	' said Dr. May. '
185010	185011	185012	185012	He	7382	' '
185023	185024	185012	185012	He	7382	' '
185037	185050	185053	185053	papa	7391	' Tom clung round his neck , as if to steady himself . '
185061	185062	185055	185055	I	0	' '
185085	185100	185077	185077	I	0	' Tom did not speak , but nestled up to him with more confidence ; '
185138	185139	185140	185140	He	7934	' '
185150	185154	185140	185140	He	7934	' said Norman ; '
185167	185168	185156	185156	I	0	' '
185191	185281	185189	185189	Tommy	238	' The answer was hardly audible . The little boy was already almost asleep , worn out with all he had undergone . Norman began to clear the sofa , that they might lay him down , but his father would not hear of disturbing him , and , sending Norman away , sat still for more than an hour , until the child slowly awoke , and scarcely recalling what had happened , stood up between his father 's knees , rubbing his eyes , and looking bewildered . '
185290	185291	185189	185189	Tommy	238	' '
185300	185312	185294	185294	you	0	' slowly murmured Tom , as the past returned on him . '
185328	185329	185330	185330	I	0	' '
185331	185336	185338	185339	the boy	893	'm glad I did , '
185345	185356	185338	185339	the boy	893	' I did not know you would be so kind . '
185357	185398	185405	185405	Tom	238	' Ah ! Tom , I fear it was as much my fault as yours , that you did not know it . But , my dear , there is a pardon that can give you better peace than mine . '
185399	185403	185405	185405	Tom	238	' I think , '
185420	185421	185410	185410	I	0	' '
185428	185429	185431	185431	you	7382	' '
185440	185621	185622	185622	Norman	548	' There could be but one response to this speech . Tom was still giddy and unwell , his whole frame affected by the troubles of the last week , and Dr. May arranged him on the sofa , and desired him to be quiet , offering to send Mary to be his companion . Tom was languidly pleased , but renewed his entreaty , that his confession might be a secret from his sisters . Dr. May promised , and Mary , quite satisfied at being taken into favour , asked no questions , but spent the rest of the morning in playing at draughts with him , and , in having inflicted on her the history of the Bloody Fire King 's Ghost — a work of Tom 's imagination , which he was wo nt to extemporize , to the extreme terror of much enduring Mary . When Dr. May had called Mary , he next summoned Norman , who found him in the hall , putting on his hat , and looking very stern and determined . '
185624	185630	185622	185622	Norman	548	' said he , hastily , '
185648	185656	185642	185642	Hoxton	269	' Norman 's face expressed utter consternation . '
185670	185681	185668	185668	yours	548	' said Dr. May , walking impetuously into the garden . '
185721	185722	185725	185725	they	4176	' '
185738	185742	185745	185745	they	4176	' said Norman , '
185751	185752	185745	185745	they	4176	' '
185761	185769	185770	185770	I	0	' said Dr. May , almost petulantly . '
185811	185854	185800	185800	Norman	548	' Norman 's words had not been many , but he felt a conviction that , in spite of the dismay and pain to himself , Dr. May ought to meet with submission to his judgment , and he acquiesced by silence . '

185884	185909	185937	185938	Dr. May	238	' Tis not for Tom 's sake , but how could we justify it to ourselves , to expose other boys to this usage ? '
185910	185913	185915	185915	Norman	548	' Yes , '
185922	185929	185915	185915	Norman	548	' I suppose it must be . '
185930	185935	185937	185938	Dr. May	238	' That is right , '
185945	185965	185937	185938	Dr. May	238	' I knew you must see it in that light . I do not mean to abuse your confidence . '
185966	185971	185973	185973	Norman	548	' No , indeed , '
185976	186036	185973	185973	Norman	548	' But you see yourself , that where the welfare of so many is at stake , it would be wickedness — yes , wickedness to be silent . Could I see that little fellow prostrated , trembling in my arms , and think of those scamps inflicting the same on other helpless children — away from their homes ! '
186037	186044	186046	186046	Norman	548	' I see , I see ! '
186065	186075	186046	186046	Norman	548	' it is the only thing to be done . '
186076	186087	186089	186090	Dr. May.	401	' It would be sharing the guilt to hide it , '
186091	186095	186097	186097	Norman	548	' Very well , '
186102	186130	186097	186097	Norman	548	' What do you wish me to do ? You see , as Dux , I know nothing about it . It happened while I was away . '
186131	186136	186138	186139	his father	7526	' True , true , '
186141	186178	186138	186139	his father	7526	' You have learnt it as brother , not as senior boy . Yes , we had better have you out of the matter . It is I who complain of their usage of my son . '
186179	186183	186185	186185	Norman	227	' Thank you , '
186190	186211	186185	186185	Norman	227	' You have not told me the names of these fellows . No , I had best not know them . '
186212	186221	186223	186223	Norman	227	' I think it might make a difference , '
186225	186254	186255	186256	The Doctor	890	' No , no , I will not hear them . It ought to make none . The fact is the same , be they who they may . '
186782	186794	186795	186795	Flora	280	' Poor Mrs. Anderson , with her pride in her children ! '
186812	186839	186795	186795	Flora	280	' I shall never be able to look in her face again ! I shall never see that boy without feeling that I have ruined him . '
186840	186850	186852	186852	Flora	280	' He needed nobody to do that for him , '
186854	186859	186861	186862	Dr. May	238	' With every disadvantage ! '
186864	186882	186861	186862	Dr. May	238	' unable even to remember his father ! Why could I not be more patient and forbearing ? '
186883	186888	186894	186894	Norman	227	' Oh ! papa ! '
186902	186905	186894	186894	Norman	227	' exclamation . '
186908	186912	186894	186894	Norman	227	' said Margaret , '

186929	186934	186927	186927	Margaret	249	' said her father . '

186961	186965	186954	186954	They	4205	' said Margaret , '
186978	186979	186981	186981	she	829	' '
186991	186995	186981	186981	she	829	' said Flora ; '
187021	187022	186981	186981	she	829	' '
187025	187029	186981	186981	she	829	' said Norman ; '
187071	187195	187196	187196	I	0	' Poor Mrs. Anderson ! her shower of notes rent the heart of the one Doctor , but were tossed carelessly aside by the other . On that Sunday , Norman held various conversations with his probable successor , Ashe , a gentle , well - disposed boy , hitherto in much dread of the post of authority , but owning , that , in Axworthy 's absence , the task would be comparatively easy , and that Anderson would probably originate far less mischief . Edward Anderson himself fell in Norman 's way in the street , and was shrinking aside , when a word , of not unfriendly greeting , caused him to quicken his steps , and say , hesitatingly , '
187203	187204	187196	187196	I	0	' '
187221	187222	187223	187223	I	0	' '
187246	187247	187248	187248	I	0	' '
187253	187254	187248	187248	I	0	' '
187273	187287	187268	187269	a fellow	837	' continued Edward , hanging down his head , very sorrowful and downcast . '
187309	187407	187410	187410	you	4215	' said Norman . Edward 's eyes were full of tears ; he almost owned the whole . He had not thought of such things , and then Axworthy — It was more evident from manner , than words , that the boy did repent , and was greatly overcome both by his own disgrace , and his mother 's distress , wishing earnestly to redeem his character , and declaring , from the bottom of his heart , that he would avoid his former offences . He was emboldened at last to say , with hesitation , '
187418	187419	187410	187410	you	4215	' '
187431	187473	187425	187425	he	899	' Edward 's eye glanced towards Norman in wonder , as he reecollected that the Mays must know that a word from him would have saved Norman from unjust punishment , and the loss of the scholarship , and he said , '
187477	187981	187425	187425	he	899	' and turned aside to his own home , with a heavy sigh . Norman took another turn , looked up at the sky , twisted his hands together in perplexity , mumbled something about hating to do a thing when it was all for no use , and then marched off towards Minster - street , with a pace like his father 's the day before . When he came forth again from Dr. Hoxton 's study , he did not believe that his intercession had produced the least effect , and there was a sense of vexation at the position which he had assumed . He went home , and said nothing on the subject ; but when , on Monday , the school was assembled , and the judgment announced , it was Axworthy alone whose friends had been advised to remove him . Anderson received a severe punishment , as did all those who had shared in the revel at the Green Man . Even Tom , and another little boy , who had been likewise drawn in , were obliged to stay within narrow bounds , and to learn heavy impositions ; and a stern reprimand and exhortation were given to the school collectively . Anderson , who had seen from the window that turn towards Minster - street , drew his own conclusions , and was not insensible to the generosity that had surpassed his hopes , though to his faltering attempt to thanks , Norman replied that he did not believe it was owing to him , and never exposed himself to Flora 's wonder , by declaring at home what he had done . So the last weeks of the half - year passed away with the boys in a subdued , but hopeful manner , and the reformation , under Norman 's ausplces , progressed so well , that Ashe might fairly expect to reap the benefit of the discipline , established at so much cost . Mr. Wilmot had looked on , and given his help , but he was preparing to leave Stoneborough , and there was great concern at the parting with such a friend . Ethel , especially , mourned the loss to Cocksmoor , and , for though hers had been the executive part , his had been the head , and he was almost equally grieved to go from the newly - begun work . Margaret lamented the loss of her kind counsellor , and the ready hearer of her anxieties for the children . Writing could ill supply the place of their conversations , and she feared likewise that her father would feel the want of his companionship . The promise of visits , and the intercourse kept up by Tom 's passing to and fro , was the best consolation . Poor Margaret had begun to flag , both in strength and spirits , as winter approached , but there came a revival in the shape of '
187985	188437	187425	187425	he	899	' Alan wrote cheerfully and graphically , with excellent accounts of Harry , who , on his side , sent very joyous and characteristic despatches , only wishing that he could present Mary with all the monkeys and parrots he had seen at Rio , as well as the little ruby - crested humming - birds , that always reminded him of Miss Rivers . With the Christmas holidays , Hector Ernescliffe came from Eton , as to a home , and was received by Margaret as a sort of especial charge . It was pretty to see how he turned to her as something peculiarly his own , and would sit on a footstool by her , letting himself be drawn into confidence , and dwelling on his brother 's past doings , and on future schemes for Maplewood . For the rest , he restored to the house the atmosphere of boy , which had somewhat departed with Harry . Mary , who had begun to be tamed down , ran more wild than ever , to the utter despair of Miss Winter ; and Tom , now that his connexion with the Whichcote foundation was over , and he was no more cowed by the sight of his tyrants , came out in a new light . He put on his boy - nature , rioted like the rest , acquired colour in his cheeks , divested his jacket of perpetual dust , had his hair cut , brushed up a crest on his head , and ran about no longer a little abject , but a merry lad . Ethel said it was a change from Horrid - locks to Harfagre ; Margaret said little , but like her father , she blessed Norman in her heart for having given back the boy to his father 's confidence , and saved him so far from the terrible course of deceit and corruption . She could not much take to heart the mad exploits of the so - called boys , even though she spent three hours in heart - beatings on Christmas Eve , when Hector , Mary . Tom , Blanche , and the dog Toby , were lost the whole day . However they did come back at six o'clock , having been deluded by an old myth of George Larkins , into starting for a common , three miles beyond Cocksmoor , in search of mistletoe , with scarlet berries , and yellow holly , with leaves like a porcupine ! Failing these wonders , they had been contenting themselves with scarlet holly , in the Drydale plantations , when a rough voice exclaimed , '
188446	188457	188461	188461	his	4218	' whereupon Tom had plunged into a thicket , and nearly '
188464	188791	188461	188461	his	4218	' but Hector boldly standing his ground , with Blanche in his hand , the woodman discovered that here was the Miss Mary , of whom his little girls talked so much , thereupon cut down the choicest boughs , and promised to leave a full supply at Dr. May 's . Margaret could have been angry at the taking the young ladies on so mad a scheme , but then Mary was so happy , and as to Hector , how scold him , when he had lifted Blanche over every ditch , and had carried her home one mile on his back , and another , Queen's - cushion fashion , between him and Mary ? Flora , meanwhile , went her own way . The desire of compensating for what had past with Norman , led to great civilities from Dr. and Mrs. Hoxton , which nobody was at liberty to receive except Flora . Pretty , graceful , and pleasing , she was a valuable companion to a gentle little , inane lady , with more time and money than she knew what to do with ; and Mrs. Hoxton , who was of a superior grade to the Stoneborough ladies in general , was such a chaperon as Flora was glad to secure . Dr. May 's old loyal feelings could not help regarding her notice of his daughter as a favour and kindness , and Margaret could find no tangible objections , nor any precedent from her mother 's conduct , even had anyone had the power to interfere with one so quiet , reasonable , and determined as Flora . So the intimacy became closer and closer , and as the winter passed on , Flora gradually became established as the dear friend and assistant , without whom Mrs. Hoxton could give no party . Further , Flora took the grand step of setting up a copperplate and cards of '
188796	188839	188461	188461	his	4218	' went out frequently on morning calls with Mrs. Hoxton and her bay horses , and when Dr. May refused his share of invitations to dinner with the neighbours in the country , Flora generally found that she could go under the Hoxtons '
188844	188849	188851	188851	Margaret	249	' That is better ! '
189143	189152	189129	189129	she	540	' Poor Ethel ! I condole with you . '
189153	189160	189162	189162	Ethel	300	' And I wonder at you ! '
189164	189179	189162	189162	Ethel	300	' especially as Flora and Mrs. Hoxton say it is all for your sake ; '
189188	189215	189162	189162	Ethel	300	' such a nice occupation for her , poor thing , as if you were Mrs. Hoxton , and had no resource but fancy - work . '
189216	189228	189230	189230	Margaret	249	' You know I am base enough to be so amused , '
189232	189262	189230	189230	Margaret	249	' but , seriously , Ethel dear , I can not bear to see you so much hurt by it . I did not know you were really grieved . '
189263	189272	189274	189274	Ethel	300	' Grieved ! I am ashamed — sickened ! '
189278	189311	189274	189274	Ethel	300	' Poor Cocksmoor ! As soon as anything is done there , Flora must needs go about implying that we have set some grand work in hand , and want only means — '
189312	189322	189162	189162	Ethel	300	' Stop , Ethel ; Flora does not boast . '
189323	189392	189274	189274	Ethel	300	' No , she does not boast . I wish she did ! That would be straight - forward and simple ; but she has too good taste for that — so she does worse — she tells a little , and makes that go a long way , as if she were keeping back a great deal ! You do n't know how furious it makes me ! '
189393	189396	189162	189162	Ethel	300	' Ethel ! '
189397	189400	189402	189402	Ethel	300	' So , '
189406	189426	189402	189402	Ethel	300	' she stirs up all Stoneborough to hear what the Miss Mays are doing at Cocksmoor . So the Ladies '
189663	189664	189675	189675	Margaret	249	' '
189677	189707	189675	189675	Margaret	249	' It has been settled without our interposition , and I have never been able to talk it over calmly with you . Papa does not seem to disapprove . '
189708	189711	189713	189713	Ethel	300	' No , '
189715	189772	189713	189713	Ethel	300	' He will only laugh , and say it will spare him a great many of Mrs. Hoxton 's nervous attacks . He thinks of it nearly as I do , at the bottom , but I can not get him to stop it , nor even to say he does not wish Flora to sell . '
189773	189786	189788	189788	Margaret	249	' I did not understand that you really had such strong objections , '
189790	189804	189788	189788	Margaret	249	' I thought it was only as a piece of folly , and — '
189805	189812	189814	189814	Ethel	300	' And interference with my Cocksmoor ? '
189830	189831	189816	189816	I	0	' '
189839	189845	189816	189816	I	0	' said Margaret , tenderly , '

189862	189909	189855	189856	the Ladies	7656	' Oh ! Margaret , if the lawful authority — if a good Clergyman would only come , how willingly would I work under him . But Mrs. Ledwich and — it is like having all the Spaniards and savages spoiling Robinson Crusoe 's desert island ! '
189910	189919	189921	189921	Margaret	249	' It is not come to that yet , '
189941	189942	189855	189856	the Ladies	7656	' '

190245	190251	190253	190253	Margaret	249	' This is very severe , '
190260	190283	190253	190253	Margaret	249	' Do you think no charity worth having but what is given on unmixed motives ? Who , then , could give ? '
190284	190402	190215	190215	they	839	' Margaret — we see much evil arise in the best - planned institutions ; nay , in what are not human . Do n't you think we ought to do our utmost to have no flaw in the foundation ? Schools are not such perfect places that we can build them without fear , and , if the means are to be raised by a bargain for amusement — if they are to come from frivolity instead of selfdenial , I am afraid of them . I do not mean that Cocksmoor has not been the joy of my life , and of Mary 's , but that was not because we did it for pleasure . '
190403	190406	190408	190408	Margaret	249	' No ! '
190412	190431	190408	190408	Margaret	249	' you found pleasure by the way . But why did you not say all this to Flora . '
190432	190443	190445	190445	Ethel	300	' It is of no use to talk to Flora , '
190447	190481	190445	190445	Ethel	300	' she would say it was high - flown and visionary . Oh ! she wants it for the bazaar 's own sake , and that is one reason why I hate it . '
190482	190487	190215	190215	they	839	' Now , Ethel ! '
190488	190547	190215	190215	they	839	' I do believe it was very unfortunate for Flora that the Hoxtons took to patronizing her , because Norman would not be patronized . Ever since it began , her mind has been full of visitings , and parties , and county families , and she has left off the home usefulness she used to care about . '
190548	190557	190559	190559	Margaret	249	' But you are old enough for that , '
190561	190618	190559	190559	Margaret	249	' It would be hard to keep Flora at home , now that you can take her place , and do not care for going out . One of us must be the representative Miss May , you know , and keep up the civilities ; and you may think yourself lucky it is not you . '
190619	190760	190761	190761	Margaret	249	' If it was only that , I should not care , but I may as well tell you , Margaret , for it is a weight to me . It is not the mere pleasure in gaieties — Flora cares for them , in themselves , as little as I do — nor is it neighbourliness , as a duty to others , for , you may observe , she always gets off any engagement to the Wards , or any of the town folk , to whom it would be a gratification to have her — she either eludes them , or sends me . The thing is , that she is always trying to be with the great people , the county set , and I do n't think that is the safe way of going on . '
190765	190797	190761	190761	Margaret	249	' You frighten me , Ethel ! I can not say it is not so , and these are so like the latent faults that dear mamma 's letter spoke of — '
190809	190873	190798	190798	Ethel	300	' I wish I had not told you ! I do n't always believe it myself , and it is so unkind , and you will make yourself unhappy too . I ought not to have thought it of her ! Think of her ever ready kindness and helpfulness ; her pretty courteous ways to the very least ; her obligingness and tact ! '
190874	190877	190879	190879	Margaret	249	' Yes , '
190881	190931	190879	190879	Margaret	249	' she is one of the kindest people there is , and I am sure that she thought the gaining funds for Cocksmoor , was the best thing to be done , that you would be pleased , and a great deal of pleasant occupation provided for us all . '
190932	190943	190945	190945	Ethel	300	' That is the bright side , the surface side , '
190947	190954	190956	190956	Margaret	249	' And not an untrue one , '
190958	191029	190956	190956	Margaret	249	' Meta will not be vain , and will work the more happily for Cocksmoor 's sake . Mary and Blanche , poor Mrs. Boulder , and many good ladies who hitherto have not known how to help Cocksmoor , will do so now with a good will , and though it is not what we should have chosen , I think we had better take it in good part . '
191030	191035	190879	190879	Margaret	249	' You think so ? '
191036	191097	190956	190956	Margaret	249	' Yes , indeed I do . If you go about with that dismal face and strong disapproval , it will really seem as if it was the having your dominion meddled with that you dislike . Besides , it is putting yourself forward to censure what is not absolutely wrong in itself , and that can not be desirable . '
191098	191101	191103	191103	Ethel	300	' No , '
191105	191139	191103	191103	Ethel	300	' but I can not help being sorry for Cocksmoor . I thought patience would prepare the way , and the means be granted in good time , without hastiness — only earnestness . '
191140	191149	191151	191151	Margaret	249	' You had made a picture for yourself , '
191155	191218	191219	191219	Ethel	300	' Yes , we all make pictures for ourselves , and we are the foremost figures in them ; but they are taken out of our hands , and we see others putting in rude touches , and spoiling our work , as it seems ; but , by - and - by , we shall see that it is all guided . '
191222	191243	191219	191219	Ethel	300	' Then having protested to my utmost against this concern , you think I ought to be amiable about it . '
191244	191284	190956	190956	Margaret	249	' And to let poor Mary enjoy it . She would be so happy , if you would not bewilder her by your gloomy looks , and keep her to the hemming of your endless glazed calico bonnet strings . '

193702	193708	193642	193642	Margaret	249	' said Margaret , sadly . '

193733	195167	193730	193730	Daisy	280	' exclaimed Margaret , her face lighting up with pleasure as the two youngest children entered , and indeed , little Gertrude 's golden hair , round open face , fresh red and white complexion , and innocent looks , had so much likeness to the flower , as to promote the use of the pet name , though protests were often made in favour of her proper appellation . Her temper was daisy - like too , serene and loving , and able to bear a great deal of spoiling , and resolve as they might , who was not her slave ? Miss Winter no longer ruled the school - room . Her sway had been brought to a happy conclusion by a proposal from a widowed sister to keep house with her ; and Ethel had reason to rejoice that Margaret had kept her submissive under authority , which , if not always judicious , was both kind and conscientious . Upon the change , Ethel had thought that the lessons could easily be managed by herself and Flora ; while Flora was very anxious for a finishing governess , who might impart singing to herself , graces to Ethel , and accomplishments to Mary and Blanche . Dr. May , however , took them both by surprise . He met with a family of orphans , the eldest of whom had been qualifying herself for a governess , and needed nothing but age and finish ; and in ten minutes after the project had been conceived , he had begun to put it in execution , in spite of Flora 's prudent demurs . Miss Bracy was a gentle , pleasing young person , pretty to look at , with her soft olive complexion , and languid pensive eyes , obliging and intelligent ; and the change from the dry , authoritative Miss Winter , was so delightful , that unedifying contrasts were continually being drawn . Blanche struck up a great friendship for her at once , Mary , always docile , ceased to be piteous at her lessons , and Ethel moralised on the satisfaction of having sympathy needed instead of repelled , and did her utmost to make Miss Bracy feel at home — and like a friend — in her new position . For herself , Ethel had drawn up a beautiful time - table , with all her pursuits and duties most carefully balanced , after the pattern of that which Margaret Rivers had made by her advice , on the departure of Mrs. Larpent , who had been called away by the ill - health of her son . Meta had adhered to hers in an exemplary manner , but she was her own mistress in a manner that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family . Margaret had become subject to languor and palpitations , and the headship of the household had fallen entirely upon Flora , who , on the other hand , was a person of multifarious occupations , and always had a great number of letters to write , or songs to copy and practise , which , together with her frequent visits to Mrs. Hoxton , made her glad to devolve , as much as she could , upon her younger sister ; and , " O Ethel , you will not mind just doing this for me , " was said often enough to be a tax upon her time . Moreover , Ethel perceived that Aubrey 's lessons were in an unsatisfactory state . Margaret could not always attend to them , and suffered from them when she did ; and he was bandied about between his sisters and Miss Bracy in a manner that made him neither attentive nor obedient . On her own principle , that to embrace a task heartily , renders it no longer irksome , she called on herself to sacrifice her studies and her regularity as far as was needful , to make her available for home requirements . She made herself responsible for Aubrey , and , after a few battles with his desultory habits , made him a very promising pupil , inspiring so much of herself into him , that he was , if anything , overfull of her classical tastes . In fact , he had such an appetite for books , and dealt so much in precocious wisdom , that his father was heard to say , " Six years old ! It is a comfort that he will soon forget the whole . " Gertrude was also Ethel 's pupil , but learning was not at all in her line ; and the sight of " Cobwebs to Catch Flies , " or of the venerated " Little Charles , " were the most serious clouds , that made the Daisy pucker up her face , and infuse a whine into her voice . However , to - day , as usual , she was half dragged , half coaxed , through her day 's portion of the discipline of life , and then sent up for her sleep , while Aubrey 's two hours were spent in more agreeable work , such as Margaret could not but enjoy hearing — so spirited was Ethel 's mode of teaching — so eager was her scholar . His play afterwards consisted in fighting o'er again the siege of Troy on the floor , with wooden bricks , shells , and the survivors of a Noah 's ark , while Ethel read to Margaret until Gertrude 's descent from the nursery , when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in Aubrey 's camp was , for her elder sisters to become her playfellows , and so spare Aubrey 's temper Ethel good - humouredly gave her own time , till their little tyrant trotted out to make Norman carry her round the garden on his back ! So sped the morning till Flora came home , full of the intended bazaar , and Ethel would fain have taken refuge in puzzling out her Spanish , had she not remembered her recent promise to be gracious . The matter had been much as she had described it . Flora had a way of hinting at anything she thought creditable , and thus the Stoneborough public had become aware of the exertions of the May family on behalf of Cocksmoor . The plan of a Fancy Fair was started . Mrs. Hoxton became more interested than was her wo nt ; and Flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for promoting the welfare of the forlorn district . She held a position which made her hope to direct the whole . As she had once declared , with truth , it only had depended on them selves , whether she and her sisters should sink to the level of the Andersons , and their set , or belong to the county society ; and her tact had resulted in her being decidedly — as the little dress - maker 's apprentice amused Ethel by saying—"One of our most distinguished patronesses"—a name that had stuck by her ever since . Margaret looked on passively , inclined to admire Flora in everything , yet now and then puzzled ; and her father , in his simplehearted way , felt only gratitude and exultation in the kindness that his daughter met with . As to the bazaar , if it had been started in his own family , he might have weighed the objections , but , as it was not his daughters own concern , he did not trouble himself about it , only regarding it as one of the many vagaries of the ladies of Stoneborough . So the scheme had been further developed , till now Flora came in with much to tell . The number of stalls had been finally fixed . Mrs. Hoxton undertook one , with Flora as an aid - de - camp , and some nieces to assist ; Lady Leonora was to chaperon Miss Rivers ; and a third , to Flora 's regret , had been allotted to Miss Cleveland , a good - natured , merry , elderly heiress , who would , Flora feared , bring on them the whole " Stoneborough crew . " And then she began to reckon up the present resources — drawings , bags , and pincushions . '

Etheldred had not answered her sister , but she did not feel at all secure that she should have anything to be thankful for , even if the school were built . The invasion of Cocksmoor was not only interference with her own field of action , but it was dangerous to the improvement of her scholars . Since the departure of Mr. Wilmot , matters at Stoneborough National School had not improved , though the Miss Andersons talked a great deal about progress , science , and lectures . The Ladies '

If Margaret had not known that Mrs. Ledwich sometimes threatened more than she could accomplish , she would have been in despair . She tried to say a good word for Cherry , but was talked down , and had reason to believe that Mrs. Elwood had mortally offended Mrs. Ledwich . The sisters had heard the other side of the story at Cocksmoor . Mrs. Elwood would not let them enter the school , till she had heard how that there Mrs. Ledwich had come in , and treated them all as if it was her own place — how she had found fault with Cherry before all the children , and , as good as said , she was not fit to keep a school . She had even laid hands on one of the books , and said that she should take it home , and see whether it were a fit one for them to use ; whereupon Mrs. Elwood had burst out in defence — it was Miss Ethel May 's book , and should not be taken away — it was Miss Ethel as she looked to — and when it seemed that Mrs. Ledwich had said something disparaging of Miss Ethel , either as to youth , judgment , or doctrine , Mrs. Elwood had fired up into a declaration that '

She had said not a word , except in quiet reply , and being equally terrified by the attack and defence , had probably seemed more dull than was her wo nt . Her real feelings did not appear till the next Sunday , when , in her peaceful conference with Margaret , far from the sound of storms , she expressed that she well knew that she was a poor scholar , and that she hoped the young ladies would not let her stand in the children 's light , when a better teacher could be found for them .

It must be confessed that the violence of partisanship did not make her a pleasant companion . However , the interest of the bazaar began somewhat to divert the current of the ladies '

198903	198909	198911	198911	Ethel	300	' Coming in good time , '
198913	198920	198911	198911	Ethel	300	' How pretty it all looks ! '
198921	198934	198937	198937	Blanche	300	' But where 's Flora — where 's my watch - guard , '
198939	198946	198948	198948	Meta	402	' She was here just now , '
198953	198994	198948	198948	Meta	402	' What a genius she is , Ethel ! She worked wonders all yesterday , and let the Miss Hoxtons think it was all their own doing , and she was out before six this morning , putting finishing touches . '
198995	199001	199003	199003	Ethel	300	' Is this your stall ? '
199005	199060	199003	199003	Ethel	300	' Yes , but it will not bear a comparison with hers . It has a lady's - maid - look by the side of hers . In fact , Bellairs and my aunt 's maid did it chiefly , for papa was rather ailing yesterday , and I could not be out much . '
199066	199067	198948	198948	Meta	402	' '
199091	199092	199080	199080	I	0	' '
199099	199130	199080	199080	I	0	' cried Mary , in ecstasy , at what she was forced to express by the vague substantive , for her imagination had never stretched to the marvels she beheld . '
199165	199311	199156	199156	Howell	567	' In fact , Lady Leonora 's marquee was filled with costly knick - knacks , which , as Meta justly said , had not half the grace and appropriate air that reigned where Flora had arranged , and where Margaret had worked , with the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished everything to which she set her hand . Miss Cleveland 's counter was not ill set - out , but it wanted the air of ease and simplicity , which was even more noticeable than the perfect taste of Flora 's wares . If there had been nothing facetious , the effect would have been better , but there was nothing to regret , and the whole was very bright and gay . Blanche could hardly look ; so anxious was she for Flora , to tell her the locality of her treasure . '
199316	199323	199324	199324	George	255	' said Meta , at last . '
199334	199335	199336	199336	Flora	280	' '
199344	199354	199338	199338	I	0	' cried each sister amazed , while Mary added , '
199362	199539	199359	199359	she	4397	' It was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin , and broad chip - hat — which all the younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to wear . It was a most becoming dress , and she did , indeed , look strikingly elegant , and well dressed . It occurred to Ethel , for the first time , that Flora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaar — no one but Meta Rivers could be compared to her , and that little lady was on so small a scale of perfect finish , that she seemed fit to act the fairy , where Flora was the enchanted princess . Flora greeted her sisters eagerly , while Meta introduced her brother — a great contrast to herself , though not without a certain comeliness , tall and large , with ruddy complexion , deep lustreless black eyes , and a heavy straight bush of black moustache , veiling rather thick lips . Blanche reiterated enquiries for her watch - guard . '
199545	199549	199359	199359	she	4397	' said Flora . '
199555	199561	199359	199359	she	4397	' Blanche was in despair . '
199568	199586	199562	199562	You	4398	' said Flora — who , however hurried , never failed in kindness—'if you will touch nothing . '
199610	199617	199619	199619	Blanche	300	' The guards ! the guards ! '
200168	200173	200175	200175	Blanche	300	' Eighteen - pence , '
200189	200198	200200	200200	he	4416	' Eh ! is not this the best ? '
200209	200218	200220	200220	Blanche	300	' Oh ! please , take that instead ? '
200225	200229	200231	200232	the gentleman	8295	' And why ? '
200236	200241	200242	200242	she	300	' I made this , '
200245	200256	200242	200242	she	300	' Is that the reason I must not have it ? '
200257	200265	200266	200267	the lady	3321	' No , do n't teaze her , '
200278	200287	200288	200289	the lady	3321	' I wonder for what it is reserved ! '
200300	200480	200296	200296	she	3321	' Let us watch her for a minute or two . What an embellishment children are ! Ha ! do n't you see — the little maid is fluttering and reddening now ! How pretty she looks ! Ah ! I see ! here 's the favoured ! Do n't you see that fine bronzed lad — Eton — one can see at a glance ! It is a little drama . They are pretending to be strangers . He is turning over the goods with an air , she trying to look equally careless , but what a pretty carnation it is ! Ha ! ha ! he has come to it — he has it ! Now the acting is over , and they are having their laugh out ! How joyously ! What next ! Oh ! she begs off from keeping shop — she darts out to him , goes off in his hand — I declare that is the prettiest sight in the whole fair ! I wonder who the little demoiselle can be ? '
200651	200662	200663	200663	Hector	243	' I counsel you to persevere in your laudable undertaking . '
200905	200912	200914	200915	the Doctor	890	' And what is Ethel doing ? '
200917	200924	200914	200915	the Doctor	890	' Packing up parcels , papa , '
200936	200948	200950	200951	Dr. May	238	' Packing parcels ! How long will they last tied up ? '
200955	200967	200969	200969	she	300	' Lasting is the concern of nothing in the fair , papa '
201553	201560	201546	201546	she	220	' Indeed ! What was it ? '
201561	201568	201570	201570	Mary	220	' Your great picture of Stoneborough ! '
201572	201596	201598	201599	Mr. Rivers	255	' Is that gone ? I am sorry you have parted with that , my dear ; it was one of your best , '
201610	201656	201602	201602	his	255	' Oh ! papa , I can do another . But , I wonder ! I put that extortionate price on it , thinking no one would give it , and so that I should keep it for you . Who has it , Mary ? '
201657	201676	201677	201677	Norman	227	' Norman , there . He would have it , though I told him it was very dear . '
201720	201727	201729	201730	Mr. Rivers	255	' Oh ! it is you ? '
201734	201787	201729	201730	Mr. Rivers	255	' O , no , do not think of exchanging it . I am rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate it . It was its falling into the hands of a stranger that I disliked . You think with me , that it is one of her best drawings . '
201788	201794	201796	201796	Norman	227	' Yes , I do , '
201802	201847	201796	201796	Norman	227	' She did that with C — , when he was here last year . He taught her very well . Have you that other here , that you took with him , my dear ? The view from the gate , I mean . '
201848	201862	201895	201895	you	227	' No , dear papa . You told me not to sell that . '
201863	201884	201796	201796	Norman	227	' Ah ! I remember ; that is right . But there are some very pretty copies from Prout here . '
201937	201946	201930	201930	he	227	' Norman signed comprehension , and Meta said , '
201969	202526	201959	201959	papa	7391	' Mr. Rivers looked pleased , but was certain that Norman could not prefer the sketches to this gay scene . However , it took very little persuasion to induce him to do what he wished , and he took Norman 's arm , crossed the lawn , and arrived in his own study , where it was a great treat to him to catch anyone who would admire his accumulation of prints , drawings , coins , & c. ; and his young friend was both very well amused , and pleased to be setting Miss Rivers 's mind at ease on her father 's account . It was not till half - past four that Dr. May knocked at the door , and stood surprised at finding his son there . Mr. Rivers spoke warmly of the young Oxonian 's kindness in leaving the fair for an old man , and praised Norman 's taste in art . Norman rose to take leave , but still thought it incumbent on him to offer to give up the picture , if Mr. Rivers set an especial value on it . But Mr. Rivers went to the length of being very glad that it was in his possession , and added to it a very pretty drawing of the same size , by a noted master , which had been in the water - colour exhibition , and , while Norman walked away , well pleased , Mr. Rivers began to extol him to his father , as a very superior and sensible young man , of great promise , and began to wish George had the same turn . Norman , on returning to the Fancy Fair , found the world in all the ardour of raffles . Lady Leonora 's contributions were the chief prizes , which attracted everyone , and , of course , the result was delightfully incongruous . Poor Ethel , who had been persuaded to venture a shilling to please Blanche , who had spent all her own , obtained the two jars in potichomanie , and was regarding them with a face worth painting . Harvey Anderson had a doll , George Rivers a wooden monkey , that jumped over a stick ; and , if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful mother - of - pearl inlaid workbox , which he had vainly wished to buy for Margaret , Flora only gained a match - box of her own , well known always to miss fire , but which had been decided to be good enough for the bazaar . By fair means or foul , the commodities were cleared off , and , while the sun - beams faded from the trodden grass , the crowds disappeared , and the vague compliment—"a very good bazaar , " was exchanged between the lingering sellers and their friends . Flora was again to sleep at the Grange , and return the next day , for a committee to be held over the gains , which were not yet fully ascertained . So Dr. May gathered his flock together , and packed them , boys and all , into the two conveyances , and Ethel bade Meta good night , almost wondering to hear her merry voice say , '
202551	202552	202543	202544	your brother	1116	' '
202559	202570	202543	202544	your brother	1116	' echoed Mary,'and I took one pound fifteen and sixpence ! '
202571	202582	202584	202584	Meta	402	' I hope it will do great good to Cocksmoor , '
202586	202604	202584	202584	Meta	402	' but , if you want real help , you know , you must come to us . '
202988	202997	203003	203003	his	856	' Well , what are you thinking of ? '
203028	203055	203003	203003	his	856	' I was thinking , papa , that there is a great deal of trouble taken , in this world , for a very little pleasure . '
203056	203071	202999	203000	her father	856	' The trouble is the pleasure , in most cases , most misanthropical Miss ! '
203072	203094	202999	203000	her father	856	' Yes , that is true ; but , if so , why can not it be taken for some good ? '
203095	203103	203105	203106	Dr. May.	401	' They meant it to be good , '
203107	203119	202999	203000	her father	856	' Come , I can not have you severe and ungrateful . '
203120	203184	202999	203000	her father	856	' So I have been telling myself , papa , all along ; but , now that the day has come , and I have seen what jealousies , and competitions , and vanities , and disappointments it has produced — not even poor little Blanche allowed any comfort — I am almost sick at heart , with thinking Cocksmoor was the excuse ! '
203185	203204	202999	203000	her father	856	' Spectators are more philosophical than actors , Ethel . Others have not been tying parcels all day . '
203205	203224	203226	203226	Ethel	300	' I had rather do that than — but that is the " Fox and the Grapes , " '
203230	203289	203226	203226	Ethel	300	' What I mean is , that the real gladness of life is not in these great occasions of pleasure , but in the little side delights , that come in the midst of one 's work , do n't they , papa ? Why is it worth while to go and search for a day 's pleasuring ? '
203290	203306	203308	203309	Dr. May	238	' Ethel , my child ! I do n't like to hear you talk so , '
203316	203378	203308	203309	Dr. May	238	' It may be too true , but it is not youthful , nor hopeful . It is not as your mother or I felt in our young days , when a treat was a treat to us , and gladdened our hearts long before and after . I am afraid you have been too much saddened with loss and care — '
203379	203386	203388	203388	Ethel	300	' Oh ! no , papa ! '
203397	203418	203388	203388	Ethel	300	' You know I am your merry Ethel . You know I can be happy enough — only at home — '
203441	203451	203453	203454	Dr. May	238	' The fact is , she is tired out , '
203462	203510	203453	203454	Dr. May	238	' She is not a beauty or a grace , and she is thoughtful and quiet , and so she moralizes , instead of enjoying , as the world goes by . I dare say a night 's rest will make all the difference in the world . '
203511	203523	203388	203388	Ethel	300	' Ah ! but there is more to come . That Ladies '
203528	203529	203530	203530	They	4480	' '
203546	203667	203668	203668	Ethel	300	' Christian Year . The next day , Ethel had hoped for a return to reason , but behold , the world was cross ! The reaction of the long excitement was felt , Gertude fretted , and was unwell ; Aubrey was pettish at his lessons ; and Mary and Blanche were weary , yawning and inattentive , every straw was a burthen , and Miss Bracy had feelings . Ethel had been holding an interminable conversation with her in the school - room , interrupted at last by a summons to speak to a Cocksmoor woman at the back - door , and she was returning from the kitchen , when the Doctor called her into his study . '
203702	203703	203691	203691	she	220	' '
203715	203722	203707	203707	you	300	' said Ethel , somewhat exasperated , '

203743	203747	203748	203748	You	300	' exclaimed Dr. May. '

204038	204042	204024	204024	you	300	' said Ethel ; '

204069	204076	204060	204060	your	300	' asked Dr. May , incredulously . '
204081	204096	204079	204079	papa	7391	' said Ethel , softened , yet wounded by his thinking it so impossible . '
204184	204185	204171	204171	she	559	' '
204196	204204	204194	204194	Ethel	300	' said the Doctor , looking vexed . '
204213	204219	204207	204207	I	0	' said Ethel , meekly ; '
204239	204240	204225	204226	these janglings	4490	' '
204245	204246	204225	204226	these janglings	4490	' '
204257	204326	204225	204226	these janglings	4490	' said Ethel . If any of us criticize anything the girls have done , if there is a change in any arrangement , if she thinks herself neglected — I ca n't tell you what little matters suffice ; she will catch me , and argue with me , till - oh ! till we are both half - dead , and yet can not stop ourselves . '
204327	204333	204406	204406	Ethel	300	' Why do you argue ? '
204334	204342	204225	204226	these janglings	4490	' If I could only help it ! '
204343	204347	204349	204350	the Doctor	890	' Bad management , '
204358	204366	204349	204350	the Doctor	890	' You want a head!'—and he sighed . '
204404	204405	204406	204406	Ethel	300	' '
204423	204424	204408	204408	I	0	' '

204487	204548	204549	204549	You	300	' said Ethel , whose temper , already not in the smoothest state , found it hard that , after having long borne patiently with these constant arguments , she should find Miss Bracy made the chief object of compassion . Dr. May 's chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part . of the weak , and he answered , '
204603	204614	204626	204626	I	0	' he continued , as the picture wrought on him . '
204647	204668	204669	204669	He	0	' He put Ethel aside , and knocked at the school - room door , while Ethel stood , mortified . '
204787	204788	204789	204789	Ethel	300	' '
204791	204808	204789	204789	Ethel	300	' cried Mary , running up to her , then slackening her pace , and whispering ; '
204821	204822	204815	204815	she	559	' '
204836	204837	204838	204838	She	559	' '

204878	204882	204871	204871	She	559	' said Ethel . '
204893	204897	204886	204886	she	559	' said Mary . '
204907	204913	204905	204905	yours	4502	' said Ethel , pettishly . '
204928	204929	204917	204917	Mary	220	' '
204938	205102	204932	204932	Flora	280	' whispered Mary , as the two sisters made a precipitate retreat into the drawing - room . Meanwhile , Dr. May had been in the school - room . Miss Bracy had ceased her tears before he came — they had been her retort on Ethel , and she had not intended the world to know of them . Half - disconcerted , half - angry , she heard the Doctor approach . She was a gentle , tearful woman , one of those who are often called meek , under an erroneous idea , that meekness consists in making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind of grievance ; and she now had a sort of melancholy satisfaction in believing that the young ladies had fabricated an exaggerated complaint of her temper , and that she was going to become injured innocence . To think herself accused of a great wrong , excused her from perceiving herself guilty of a lesser one . '
205106	205119	205103	205104	Miss Bracy	559	' said Dr. May , entering with his frank , sweet look ; '
205181	205289	205290	205290	You	559	' Such amends as these confused Miss Bracy , who found it pleasanter to be lamentable with Ethel , than to receive a full apology , for her imagined offence , from the master of the house . Feeling both small and absurd , she murmured something of " oh no ; " and " being sure , " and hoped he was going , so that she might sit down to pity herself , for those girls having made her appear so ridiculous . No such thing ! Dr. May put a chair for her , and sat down himself , saying , with a smile , '
205333	205338	205345	205345	they	4509	' Miss Bracy exclaimed , '
205350	205351	205345	205345	they	4509	' '
205357	205362	205345	205345	they	4509	' said Dr. May , '
205419	205455	205456	205456	You	559	' Miss Bracy smiled , for she could remember instances when , after suffering much at the time , she had found the affront imaginary . He was glad of that smile , and proceeded . '

205517	205523	205514	205515	Dr. May	238	' she exclaimed , shocked ; '

206115	206127	206129	206129	Flora	280	' Do you think I can not manage the Stoneborough folk ? '

Never mind , here is wherewith to build the school , and the management will be too happy to fall into our hands . Do you think everyone is as ready as you are , to walk three miles , and back , continually ? '

206301	206331	206293	206293	she	280	' You look as doleful as if you thought you should be robbed of Cocksmoor , but that is the last thing that will happen , you will see . '
206332	206358	206360	206360	Ethel	300	' It would not be acting fairly to let them build for us , and then for us to put them out of the management , '
206362	206384	206360	206360	Ethel	300	' My dear , they want importance , not action . They will leave the real power to us of themselves . '

Still Flora was good tempered , though Ethel would almost have preferred her being provoked ; '
206613	206653	206661	206661	Ethel	300	' she said,'I have been using you ill , and leaving the world on your shoulders , but it was all in your service and Cocksmoor 's ; and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful again . '

206663	206707	206661	206661	Ethel	300	' Really , Ethel , to comfort you , I think I shall send you with Norman to dine at Abbotstoke Grange on Wednesday . Mr. Rivers begged us to come ; he is so anxious to make it lively for his son . '
206708	206744	206746	206746	Ethel	300	' Thank you , I do not think Mr. George Rivers and I should be likely to get on together . What a bad style of wit ! You heard what Mary said about him ? '
206755	206767	206769	206769	Flora	280	' Young men never know how to talk to little girls , '
207367	207384	207355	207356	Miss Boulder	383	' Ask Mrs. Ledwich if we should not begin with some steps for getting the land . '
207397	207418	207393	207394	the president	4551	' Just so , the land is the first consideration . We must at once take steps for obtaining it . '
207697	207723	207689	207689	she	280	' I think that consideration had better wait till we have some more definite view . Had we not better turn to this land question ? '
207724	207728	207729	207729	they	4553	' Quite true ! '
207963	208001	208002	208002	Everybody	584	' If I am not mistaken , the land is a copyhold of Sir Henry Walkinghame , held under the manor of Drydale , which belongs to M — College , and is underlet to Mr. Nicolson . '
208253	208259	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' My dear Miss Flora ! '
208280	208322	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' How am I to write to a Principal ? Am I to begin Reverend Sir , or my Lord , or is he Venerable , like an Archdeacon ? What is his name , and what am I to say ? '
208323	208336	208338	208338	Flora	280	' Why ; it is not a correspondence much in my line , '
208342	208364	208338	208338	Flora	280	' Ah ! but you are so intimate with Dr. Hoxton , and your brothers at Oxford ! You must know — '
208365	208371	208373	208373	Flora	280	' I 'll take advice , '
208379	208395	208373	208373	Flora	280	' Shall I come , and call before Friday , and tell you the result . '
208396	208411	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' Oh ! pray ! It will be a real favour ! Good morning — '
208412	208415	208417	208417	Flora	280	' There , '
208425	208437	208417	208417	Flora	280	' Cherry is not going to be turned out just yet ! '
208438	208463	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' How could you , Flora ? Now they will have that man from Whitford , and you said not a word against it ! '
208464	208542	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' What was the use of adding to the hubbub ? A little opposition would make them determined on having him . You will see , Ethel , we shall get the ground on our own terms , and then it will be time to settle about the mistress . If the harvest holidays were not over , we would try to send Cherry to a training - school , so as to leave them no excuse . '
208543	208570	208417	208417	Flora	280	' I hate all this management and contrivance . It would be more honest to speak our minds , and not pretend to agree with them . '
208571	208668	208261	208262	Miss Rich	575	' My dear Ethel ! have I spoken a word contrary to my opinion ? It is not fit for me , a girl of twenty , to go disputing and dragooning as you would have me ; but a little scavoir faire , a grain of common sense , thrown in among the babble , always works . Do n't you remember how Mrs. Ward 's sister told us that a whole crowd of tottering Chinese ladies would lean on her , because they felt her firm support , though it was out of sight ? '
209081	209107	209066	209066	he	238	' I do not know whether this letter is intended for Richard , or for me . At any rate , it concerns you most . '
209128	209132	209166	209166	she	300	' Reverend Sir . '
209450	209463	209439	209439	She	384	' Ah ! that she was not , when she went away ! '
209485	209508	209523	209523	she	384	' Oh ! how I longed , when she went away , to beg her to keep them up ! Dear Una . '
209527	209532	209523	209523	she	384	' Mr. Richard May , '
209534	209538	209523	209523	she	384	' Miss Athel . '
209560	209588	209554	209554	her	384	' I am afraid he thinks my name is Athaliah ! But , oh ! this dear girl ! How I have wished to hear of her . '
209595	209599	209554	209554	her	384	' Mr. Richard , '
209601	209605	209554	209554	her	384	' Miss Athel ; '
209681	209687	209656	209706	an Irishwoman , whom I never could bring to Church herself , but who ran on loudly with their praises , usually ending with , ' Heavens be their bed , ' and saying that Una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and gentleman found her out	4614	' Heavens be their bed , '
210050	210076	210033	210033	she	588	' Oh ! why , why was I not up , and at the window ! Oh , my Una ! to think of that ! '
210207	210641	210190	210190	God	283	' " I feel that I am not rendering her words with all their fervour and beauty of Irish expression , but I would that I could fully retain and transmit them , for , those who have so led her , must , indeed , be able to feel them precious . I never saw a more peaceful frame of penitence and joy . She died last night , sleeping herself away , without more apparent suffering , and will be committed to the earth on Sunday next , all her fellow - scholars attending ; and , I hope , profiting by the example she has left . " " I have only to add my most earnest congratulations to those , whose labour of love has borne such blessed fruit ; and , hoping you will pardon the liberty , & c. " Etheldred finished the letter through blinding tears , while rising sobs almost choked her . She ran away to her own room , bolted the door , and threw herself on her knees , beside her bed — now confusedly giving thanks for such results — now weeping bitterly over her own unworthiness . Oh ! what was she in the sight of Heaven , compared with what this poor girl had deemed her — with what this Clergyman thought her ? She , the teacher , taught , trained , and guarded , from her infancy , by her wise mother , and by such a father ! She , to have given way , all day , to pride , jealousy , anger , selfish love of her own will ; when this poor girl had embraced , and held fast , the blessed hope , from the very crumbs they had brought her ! Nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that had been working in Ethel , which had been scotched into silence — not killed — when she endured the bazaar , and now had been indemnifying itself by repining at every stumbling - block . Her own scholar 's blessing was the rebuke that went most home to her heart , for having doubted whether good could be worked in any way , save her own . She was interrupted by Mary , trying to open the door , and , admitting her , heard her wonder at the traces of her tears , and ask what there was about Una ? Ethel gave her the letter , and Mary 's tears showered very fast — they always came readily . '
210652	210653	210659	210659	Richard	298	' '
210683	210695	210680	210680	his	298	' and Ethel sat down and cried again . Mary pondered . '
210702	210706	210680	210680	his	298	' she said ; '
210734	210775	210776	210776	Mary	220	' Ethel kissed her . It was almost the first time Mary had spoken of her mother ; and she answered,'Dear Mary , we can not tell — we may think . It is all one Communion , you know . '
210850	210881	210832	210832	he	856	' My dear child , I wish you joy . This will be a pleasant message , to bid poor Ritchie good speed for his Ordination , will it not ? '
210882	210889	210832	210832	he	856	' That it will , papa — '
210890	210905	210907	210907	he	856	' Why , Ethel , have you been crying over it all this time ? '
210917	210940	210907	210907	he	856	' Many other things , papa . I am so unworthy — but it was not our doing — but the grace — '
210941	210960	210832	210832	he	856	' No , but thankful you may be , to have been the means of awakening the grace ! '
210966	210998	210832	210832	he	856	' And , oh , papa ! coming to - day , when I have been behaving so ill to you , and Miss Bracy , and Flora , and all . '
210999	211014	210832	210832	he	856	' Have you ? I did not know you had behaved ill to me . '
211015	211056	210832	210832	he	856	' About Miss Bracy — I thought wrong things , if I did not say them . To her , I believe , I said what was true , though it was harsh of me to say it , and — '
211057	211146	210907	210907	he	856	' What ? about pride and temper ? It was true , and I hope it will do her good . Cure a piping turkey with a pepper - corn sometimes . I have spoken to her , and told her to pluck up a little spirit ; not fancy affronts , and not to pester you with them . Poor child ! you have been sadly victimized to - day and yesterday . No wonder you were bored past patience , with that absured rabble of women ! '
211147	211194	210832	210832	he	856	' It was all my own selfish , distrustful temper , wanting to have Cocksmoor taken care of in my own way , and angry at being interfered with . I see it now — and here this poor girl , that I thought thrown away — '
211195	211268	210907	210907	he	856	' Aye , Ethel , you will often see the like . The main object may fail or fall short , but the earnest pains - taking will always be blessed some way or other , and where we thought it most wasted , some fresh green shoot will spring up , to show it is not we that give the increase . I suppose you will write to Richard with this ? '
211269	211274	210832	210832	he	856	' That I shall . '
211275	211311	210907	210907	he	856	' Then you may send this with it . Tell him my arm is tired and stiff to - day , or I would have said more . He must answer the Clergyman 's letter . '
211376	211414	211433	211433	their	4643	' Your affectionate Father , R. May. P.S. Margaret does not gain ground this summer — you must soon come home and cheer her . Riddle . Flora revised the letter to the Principal , and the Ladies '
211566	211569	211571	211571	Flora	280	' Positively , '
211573	211599	211571	211571	Flora	280	' I believe I may in time . You see there are different ways of acting , as an authority , or as an equal . '
211600	211614	211616	211616	Ethel	300	' The authority can move from without , the equal must from within , '
211618	211636	211616	211616	Ethel	300	' Just so . We must circumvent their prejudices , instead of trying to beat them down . '
211637	211648	211571	211571	Flora	280	' If you only could have the proper Catechizing restored ! '
211649	211662	211571	211571	Flora	280	' Wait ; you will see . Let me feel my ground . '
211663	211678	211616	211616	Ethel	300	' Or if we could only abdicate into the hands of the rightful power ! '
211679	211691	211571	211571	Flora	280	' The rightful power would not be much obliged to you . '
211692	211700	211702	211702	Ethel	300	' That is the worst of it , '
211704	211742	211702	211702	Ethel	300	' It is sad to hear the sick people say that Dr. May is more to them than any parson ; it shews that they have so entirely lost the notion of what their Clergyman should be . '
211743	211757	211759	211759	Flora	280	' Dr. May is the man most looked up to in the town , '
211779	211780	211702	211702	Ethel	300	' '
211783	211789	211702	211702	Ethel	300	' said Ethel , hesitating . '
211830	211834	211702	211702	Ethel	300	' said Flora ; '
211856	212609	212610	212610	You	4660	' They were at home by this time , and , entering the hall , perceived that the whole party were in the lawn . The consolation of the children for the departure of Hector and Tom , was a bowl of soapsuds and some tobacco pipes , and they had collected the house to admire and assist ; even Margaret 's couch being drawn close to the window . Bubbles are one of the most fascinating of sports . There is the soft foamy mass , like driven snow , or like whipped cream . Blanche bends down to blow " a honeycomb , " holding the bowl of the pipe in the water ; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger , clearer bubbles , each reflecting the whole scene , and sparkling with rainbow tints , until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand , and Mary pronounces it stiff enough , and presents a pipe to little Daisy , who , drawing the liquid into her mouth , throws it away with a grimace , and declares that she does not like bubbles ! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks , gravely puffing at the sealing - waxed extremity . Out pours a confused assemblage of froth , but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins , flowing down on either side , bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky , the clouds , the tulip - tree . Aubrey pauses to exclaim ! but where is it ? Try again ! A proud bubble , as Mary calls it , a peacock , in blended pink and green , is this transparent sphere , reflecting and embellishing house , wall , and shrubs ! It is too beautiful ! It is gone ! Mary undertakes to give a lesson , and blows deliberately without the slightest result . Again ! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves , and float off on the summer breeze , with a tardy , graceful uncertain motion . Daisy rushes after them , catches at them , and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled " All gone ! " as plainly expressed by Toby , who snaps at them , and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth , while the kitten frisks after them , striking at them with her paw , amazed at meeting vacancy . Even the grave Norman is drawn in . He agrees with Mary that bubbles used to fly over the wall , and that one once went into Mrs. Richardson 's garret window , when her housemaid tried to catch it with a pair of tongs , and then ran down - stairs screaming that there was a ghost in her room ; but that was in Harry 's time , the heroic age of the May nursery . He accepts a pipe , and his greater height raises it into a favourable current of air — the glistening balloon sails off . It flies , it soars ; no , it is coming down ! The children shout at it , as if to drive it up , but it wilfully descends — they rush beneath , they try to waft it on high with their breath — there is a collision between Mary and Blanche — Aubrey perceives a taste of soapy water — the bubble is no more — it has vanished in his open mouth ! Papa himself has taken a pipe , and the little ones are mounted on chairs , to be on a level with their tall elders . A painted globe is swimming along , hesitating at first , but the dancing motion is tending upwards , the rainbow tints glisten in the sunlight — all rush to assist it ; if breath of the lips can uphold it , it should rise , indeed ! Up ! above the wall ! over Mrs. Richardson 's elm , over the topmost branch — hurra ! out of sight ! Margaret adds her voice to the acclamations . Beat that if you can , Mary ! That doubtful wind keeps yours suspended in a graceful minuet ; its pace is accelerated — but earthwards ! it has committed self - destruction by running foul of a rose - bush . A general blank ! '
212615	212630	212610	212610	You	4660	' said Norman , as the elders laughed at each other 's baffled faces . '
212640	212644	212631	212631	I	0	' she answered . '
212647	212663	212671	212672	Dr. May.	401	' said Norman , smiling ; one cause is as good as another for it . '
212664	212669	212671	212672	Dr. May.	401	' Very pretty sport , '
212673	212684	212671	212672	Dr. May.	401	' You should write a poem on it , Norman . '
212685	212692	212694	212694	Norman	227	' It is an exhausted subject , '
212696	212706	212694	212694	Norman	227	' bubble and trouble are too obvious a rhyme . '
212707	212725	212726	212726	Everyone	1784	' Ha ! there it goes ! It will be over the house ! That 's right ! '
212732	212737	212726	212726	Everyone	1784	' Whose is it ? '
212738	212742	212694	212694	Norman	227	' Blanche 's — '
212743	212756	212758	212759	the Doctor	890	' Hurrah for Blanche ! Well done , white Mayflower , there ! '
212761	212824	212758	212759	the Doctor	890	' that is what I meant . See the applause gained by a proud bubble that flies ! Do n't we all bow down to it , and waft it up with the whole force of our lungs , air as it is ; and when it fairly goes out of sight , is there any exhilaration or applause that surpasses ours ? '
212825	212840	212842	212842	Norman	227	' The whole world being bent on making painted bubbles fly over the house , '
212851	212862	212842	212842	Norman	227	' It is a fair pattern of life and fame . '
212863	212868	212870	212871	Dr. May	238	' I was thinking , '
212873	212884	212870	212871	Dr. May	238	' what was the most unalloyed exultation , I remember . '
212885	212895	212897	212897	Ethel	300	' Harry 's , when you were made Dux , '
212902	212906	212908	212908	Norman	227	' Not mine , '
212912	212916	212918	212919	Dr. May	238	' I believe , '
212921	212951	212918	212919	Dr. May	238	' I never knew such glorification as when Aubrey Spencer climbed the poor old market - cross . We all felt ourselves made illustrious for ever in his person . '
212952	212970	212972	212972	Blanche	300	' Nay , papa , when you got that gold medal must have been the grandest time ? '
212987	213052	212979	212980	Dr. May	238	' I , Blanche ? Why , I was excessively amazed , that is all , not in Norman 's way , but I had been doing next to nothing to the very last , then fell into an agony , and worked like a horse , thinking myself sure of failure , and that my mother and my uncles would break their hearts . '

213091	213126	213087	213087	he	238	' but I was ashamed of myself , and of the authorities , for choosing such an idle dog , and vexed that other plodding lads missed it , who deserved it more than I. '

213167	213209	213165	213165	Ethel	300	' Not competing . He had been ready a year before , and had gained it , or I should have had no chance . Poor Spencer ! what would I not give to see him , or hear of him ? '
213210	213219	213221	213221	Ethel	300	' The last was — how long ago ? '
213223	213238	213240	213241	Dr. May	238	' Six years , when he was setting off , to return from Poonshedagore , '
213245	213286	213240	213241	Dr. May	238	' I give him up ; his health was broken , and there was no one to look after him . He was the sort of man to have a nameless grave , and a name too blessed for fame . '

213496	213499	213501	213501	Aubrey	594	' No , '
213503	213513	213501	213501	Aubrey	594	' she was Iphigenia , going to be sacrificed . '
213514	213520	213522	213522	Ethel	300	' Mary unconsciously acted Diana , '
213524	213531	213522	213522	Ethel	300	' and bore the victim away . '
213532	213541	213543	213543	Meta	402	' Pray , was Daisy a willing Clytemnestra ? '
213545	213554	213556	213556	Aubrey	594	' Oh , yes , she liked it , '
213563	213574	213576	213576	Margaret	249	' I never could get proper respect paid to dolls , '
213578	213588	213576	213576	Margaret	249	' we deal too much in their natural enemies . '

213641	213667	213576	213576	Margaret	249	' George Rivers burst out laughing — his first sign of life ; and Meta looked as if she had heard of so many murders . '
213668	213678	213679	213679	she	402	' I ca n't help feeling for a doll ! '
213682	213715	213679	213679	she	402	' They used to be like sisters to me . I feel as if they were wasted on children , that see no character in them , and only call them Dolly . '
213716	213722	213724	213724	Margaret	249	' I agree with you , '
213726	213763	213724	213724	Margaret	249	' If there had been no live dolls , Richard and I should have reared our doll family as judiciously as tenderly . There are treasures of carpentry still extant , that he made for them . '
213764	213772	213774	213774	Meta	402	' Oh ! I am so glad ! '
213786	213816	213778	213778	she	402	' If I were to confess — there is a dear old Rose in the secret recesses of my wardrobe . I could as soon throw away my sister — '

213851	213896	213847	213849	Gertrude Margaret May	249	' said the little round mouth . The fat arm was drawn back , with all a baby 's dignity , and the rosy face was hidden in Dr. May 's breast , at the sound of George Rivers 's broad laugh , and , '
213903	213991	213900	213901	little one	4675	' Dr. May put his arm round her , turned aside from him , and began talking to Meta about Mr. Rivers . Flora and Norman made conversation for the brother ; and he presently asked Norman to go out shooting with him ; but , looked so amazed on hearing that Norman was no sportsman , that Flora tried to save the family credit , by mentioning Hector 's love of a gun , which caused their guest to make a general tender of sporting privileges ; '

214507	214536	214505	214505	Norman	227	' Ha ! Norman , you are quite won by his invitation to shoot ! How he despised you for refusing — as much as you despised him . '
214537	214542	214544	214544	Norman	227	' Speak for yourself , '
214546	214606	214544	214544	Norman	227	' You fancy no sensible man likes shooting , but you are all wrong . Some of our best men are capital sportsmen . Why , there is Ogilvie — you know what he is , When I bring him down here , you will see that there is no sort of sport that he is not keen after . '
214607	214618	214620	214621	Dr. May.	401	' This poor fellow will never be keen after anything , '

214679	214682	214684	214684	Margaret	249	' Ah ! '
214686	214714	214684	214684	Margaret	249	' it is a proof of what I want to impress on you . We really must leave off calling her Daisy , when strangers are there . '
214715	214722	214724	214724	Mary	220	' It is so much nicer , '
214726	214731	214733	214733	Margaret	249	' The very reason , '
214735	214827	214733	214733	Margaret	249	' fondling names should be kept for our innermost selves , not spread abroad , and made common . I remember when I used to be called Peg - top — and Flora , Flossy — we were never allowed to use the names , when any visitor was near ; and we were asked if we could not be as fond of each other by our proper names . I think it was felt that there was a want of reserve , in publishing our pet words to other people . '
214828	214832	214834	214835	Dr. May	238	' Quite true , '
214837	214891	214834	214835	Dr. May	238	' baby - names never ought to go beyond home . It is the fashion to use them now ; and , besides the folly , it seems , to me , an absolute injury to a girl , to let her grow up , with a nick - name attached to her . '
214892	214895	214898	214898	Norman	548	' Aye ! '
214900	214938	214898	214898	Norman	548	' I hear men talking of Henny , and Loo , and the like ; and you ca n't think how glad I have been , that my sisters could not be known by any absurd word ! '
214939	214955	214957	214957	Flora	280	' It is a case , where self - respect would make others behave properly , '

215355	215361	215313	215313	she	300	' you really have begun ! '
215362	215387	215317	215317	she	300	' I could not help it , when I heard the subject given out for next year . Our old friend , Decius Mus . '
215388	215393	215313	215313	she	300	' Have you finished ? '
215394	215438	215313	215313	she	300	' By no means , but it brought a world of notions into my head , such as I could not but set down . Now , Ethel , do oblige me , do write another , as we used in old times . '
215439	215445	215447	215447	Ethel	300	' I had better not , '
215452	215483	215447	215447	Ethel	300	' If I throw myself into it , I shall hate everything else , and my wits will be wool - gathering . I have neither time nor poetry enough . '

215501	215504	215447	215447	Ethel	300	' How ? '
215505	215613	215313	215313	she	300	' I wanted money for Cocksmoor , and , after persuading papa , I got leave to send a ballad about a little girl , and a white rose , to that school magazine . I do n't think papa liked it , but there were some verses that touched him , and one had seen worse . It was actually inserted , and I was in high feather , till , oh ! Norman ! imagine Richard getting hold of this unlucky thing , without a notion where it came from . Margaret put it before him , to see what he would say to it . '
215614	215632	215313	215313	she	300	' I am afraid it was not like a young lady 's anonymous composition in a story . '
215633	215742	215447	215447	Ethel	300	' By no means . Imagine Ritchie picking my poor metaphors to pieces , and weighing every sentimental line ! And all in his dear old simplicity , because he wanted to understand it , seeing that Margaret liked it . He had not the least intention of hurting my feelings , but never was I so annihilated ! I thought he was doing it on purpose , till I saw how distressed he was when he found it out ; and , worse than all was , his saying at the end , that he supposed it was very fine , but he could not understand it . '
215743	215749	215313	215313	she	300	' Let me see it . '
215750	215762	215313	215313	she	300	' Some time or other ; but let me see Decius . '
215763	215776	215447	215447	Ethel	300	' Did you give up verses because Richard could not understand them ? '
215777	215859	215313	215313	she	300	' No ; because I had other fish to fry . And I have not given them up altogether . I do scrabble down things that tease me by running in my head , when I want to clear my brains , and know what I mean ; but I ca n't do it without sitting up at night , and that stupifies me before breakfast . And as to making bubbles of them , Ritchie has cured me of that ! '
215860	215866	215868	215868	Norman	548	' It is a pity ! '
215870	215884	215868	215868	Norman	548	' Nonsense , let me see Decius . I know he is splendid . '
215885	215903	215904	215904	Ethel	300	' I wish you would have tried , for all my best ideas are stolen from you . '
215968	216214	216215	216215	Norman	548	' impassioned address to the beauteous land he was about to leave , and the remembrances of his Roman hearth , his farm , his children , whom he quitted for the pale shadows of an uncertain Elysium . There was a great hiatus in the middle , and Norman had many more authorities to consult , but the summing up was nearly complete , and Ethel thought the last lines grand , as they spoke of the noble consul 's name living for evermore , added to the examples that nerve ardent souls to devote life , and all that is precious , to the call of duty . Fame is not their object . She may crown their pale brows , but for the good of others , not their own , a beacon light to the world . Self is no object of theirs , and it is the casting self behind that wins — not always the visible earthly strife , but the combat between good and evil . They are the true victors , and whether chronicled , or forgotten , true glory rests on their heads , the sole true glory that man can attain , namely , the reflected beams that crown them as shadowy types of Him whom Decius knew not — the Prince who gave himself for His people , and thus rendered death , for Truth 's sake , the highest boon to mortal man .

216502	216553	216443	216443	Margaret	249	' Oh ! we asked a few questions , and brought out remarks , with great difficulty , at long intervals . He asked me if lying here was not a great nuisance , and , at last , he grew tired of twisting his moustache , and went away . '
216554	216565	216443	216443	Margaret	249	' I trust it was a call to take leave . '
216566	216584	216443	216443	Margaret	249	' No , he thinks he shall sell out , for the army is a great nuisance . '

216596	216618	216443	216443	Margaret	249	' Yes , he said he wanted to settle down , but living with one 's father was such a nuisance . '

216762	217183	216760	216760	Ethel	300	' Margaret and Etheldred kept their eyes open , and sometimes imagined , sometimes laughed at themselves for their speculations , and so October began ; and Ethel laughed , as she questioned whether the Grange would feel the Hussar 's return to his quarters , as much as home would the departure of their scholar for Balliol . Tennyson . Flora and Norman were dining with one of their county acquaintance , and Dr. May had undertaken to admit them on their return . The fire shone red and bright , as it sank calmly away , and the time - piece and clock on the stairs had begun their nightly duett off ticking , the crickets chirped in the kitchen , and the Doctor sat alone . His book lay with unturned pages , as he sat musing , with eyes fixed on the fire , living over again his own life , the easy bright days of his youth , when , without much pains on his own part , the tendencies of his generous affectionate disposition , and the influences of a warm friendship , and an early attachment , had guarded him from evil — then the period when he had been perfectly happy , and the sobering power of his position had been gradually working on him ; but though always religious and highly principled , the very goodness of his natural character preventing him from perceiving the need of self - control , until the shock that changed the whole tenor of his life , and left him , for the first time , sensible of his own responsibility , but , with inveterate habits of heedlessness and hastiness , that love alone gave him force to combat . He was now a far gentler man . His younger children had never seen , his elder had long since forgotten , his occasional bursts of temper , but he suffered keenly from their effects , especially as regarded some of his children . Though Richard 's timidity had been overcome , and Tom 's more serious failures had been remedied , he was not without anxiety , and had a strange unsatisfactory feeling as regarded Flora . He could not feel that he had fathomed her ! She reminded him of his old Scottish father - in - law , Professor Mackenzie , whom he had never understood , nor , if the truth were known , liked . Her dealings with the Ladies '
217485	217494	217495	217495	Norman	548	' Well ! was it a pleasant party ? '
217546	217557	217558	217558	she	280	' One moment , if you please , dear papa , '
217567	217568	217558	217558	she	280	' '

217586	217595	217580	217580	papa	7391	' said Dr. May , beginning to smile . '

217622	217638	217580	217580	papa	7391	' said Flora — a little hurt , as her father discovered by her tone . '

217664	217671	217580	217580	papa	7391	' said Dr. May , laughing ; '

217692	217701	217689	217689	I	0	' said Flora , looking down and hesitating , '

217765	217811	217763	217763	Flora	280	' and he paused completely confounded , while his daughter was no less surprised at the manner in which her news was received . Each waited for the other to speak , and Flora turned away , resting her head against the mantel - piece . '
217814	217825	217826	217826	you	280	' said he , laying his hand on her shoulder , '
217836	217837	217826	217826	you	280	' '
217849	217863	217843	217843	you	0	' said Flora , in a choked voice , her face still averted . '
217880	217884	217867	217867	I	0	' he answered ; '
217926	217952	217984	217984	your	280	' He had grown more and more vehement — and Flora put her handkerchief to her eyes , for tears of actual disappointment were flowing . '
217957	217971	217984	217984	your	280	' he said , touched , but turning it off by a smile , '
218048	218076	218018	218018	Flora	280	' He kissed her affectionately , and went up - stairs with her , stopping at her door to give her another embrace , and to say , '
218094	218433	218018	218018	Flora	280	' Flora was disappointed . She had been too highly pleased at her conquest to make any clear estimation of the prize , individually considered . Her vanity magnified her achievement , and she had come home in a flutter of pleasure , at having had such a position in society offered to her , and expecting that her whole family would share her triumph . Gratified by George Rivers 's admiration , she regarded him with favour and complacency ; and her habit of considering herself as the most sensible person in her sphere , made her so regard his appreciation of her , that she was blinded to his inferiority . It must be allowed , that he was less dull with her than with most others . And , in the midst of her glory , when she expected her father to be delighted and grateful — to be received as a silly girl , ready to accept any proposal , her lover spoken of with scorn , and the advantages of the match utterly passed over , was almost beyond endurance . A physician , with eleven children dependent on his practice , to despise an offer from the heir of such a fortune ! But that was his customary romance ! She forgave him , when it occurred to her that she was too important , and valuable , to be easily spared ; and a tenderness thrilled through her , as she looked at the sleeping Margaret 's pale face , and thought of surrendering her and little Daisy to Ethel 's keeping . And what would become of the house - keeping ? She decided , however , that feelings must not sway her — out of six sisters some must marry , for the good of the rest . Blanche and Daisy should come and stay with her , to be formed by the best society ; and , as to poor dear Ethel , Mrs. Rivers would rule the Ladies '
218549	218554	218555	218555	he	856	' Well , Flora , '
218561	218566	218555	218555	he	856	' have you thought ? '
218567	218576	218578	218578	Flora	280	' Do you know any cause against it ? '
218584	218620	218578	218578	Flora	280	' I know almost nothing of him . I have never heard anything of his character , or conduct . Those would be a subject of enquiry , if you wish to carry this on — '
218621	218628	218630	218630	Flora	280	' I see you are averse , '
218632	218641	218630	218630	Flora	280	' I would do nothing against your wishes — '
218642	218652	218555	218555	he	856	' My wishes have nothing to do with it , '
218656	218696	218630	218630	Flora	280	' The point is — that I must do right , as far as I can , as well as try to secure your happiness ; and I want to be sure that you know what you are about . '
218697	218705	218707	218707	Flora	280	' I know he is not clever , '
218709	218720	218707	218707	Flora	280	' but there may be many solid qualities without talent . '
218721	218745	218630	218630	Flora	280	' I am the last person to deny it ; but where are these solid qualities ? I can not see the recommendation ! '
218746	218754	218756	218756	Flora	280	' I place myself in your hands , '
218773	218823	218756	218756	Flora	280	' Flora , Flora ! why will you talk as if I were sacrificing you to some dislike or prejudice of my own ! Do n't you think I should only rejoice , to have such a prosperous home offered to you , if only the man were worthy ? '
218824	218843	218845	218845	Flora	280	' If you do not think him so , of course , there is an end of it , '
218854	218924	218848	218848	her	280	' It is not what I think , in the absence of proof , but what you think , Flora . What I want you to do is this — to consider the matter fairly . Compare him with — I'll not say with Norman — but with Richard , Alan , Mr. Wilmot . Do you think you could rely on him — come to him for advice ? '
218936	218958	218848	218848	her	280	' Above all — do you think him likely to be a help , or a hindrance , in doing right ? '
218959	218968	218970	218970	Flora	280	' I think you under - rate him , '
218974	219002	218970	218970	Flora	280	' but , of course , if you dislike it — though , I think , you would change your mind , if you knew him better — '
219003	219006	219007	219007	he	4736	' Well ! '
219015	219024	218848	218848	her	280	' It is not always the most worthy — '
219028	219150	218848	218848	her	280	' I have no dislike to him . Perhaps I may find that you are right . Since your mind is made up , I will do this : first , we must be assured of his father 's consent , for they may very fairly object , since , what I can give you , is a mere nothing to them . Next , I shall find out what character he bears in his regiment , and watch him well myself ; and , if nothing appear seriously amiss , I will not withhold my consent . But , Flora , you should still consider whether he shows such principle , and right feeling , as you can trust to . '
219151	219167	219214	219214	Margaret	249	' Thank you , papa . I know you will do all that is kind . '
219168	219184	218848	218848	her	280	' Mind , you must not consider it an engagement , unless all be satisfactory . '
219185	219193	219194	219194	Ethel	300	' I will do as you please . '
219240	219245	219225	219226	Dr. May	238	' Such a cub ! '

219482	219515	219516	219516	Ethel	300	' said Ethel . She broke off short , quite dismayed at the emotion she had excited . Dr. May stepped towards her , almost as if he could have shaken her . '
219518	219522	219516	219516	Ethel	300	' he cried , '
219534	219593	219594	219594	Ethel	300	' Ethel tried to recollect what she had said that was so shocking , for the idea of Flora 's worldly motives was no novelty to her . They had appeared in too many instances ; and , though frightened at his anger , she stood still , without unsaying her words . Margaret began to explain away . '
219602	219603	219594	219594	Ethel	300	' '
219606	219619	219594	219594	Ethel	300	' said Dr. May , his passionate manner giving way to dejection . '
219645	219662	219667	219667	papa	7391	' Poor Margaret 's tears sprang forth , and , looking up imploringly , she exclaimed , '
219689	219863	219682	219682	You	7391	' Any reproach to her had been entirely remote from his thoughts , and he was at once on his knee beside her , soothing and caressing , begging her pardon , and recalling whatever she could thus have interpreted . Meanwhile , Ethel stood unnoticed and silent , making no outward protestation , but with lips compressed , as in her heart of hearts , she passed the resolution — that her father should never feel this pain on her account . Leave him who might , she would never forsake him ; nothing but the will of Heaven should part them . It might be hasty and venturesome . She knew not what it might cost her ; but , where Ethel had treasured her resolve to work for Cocksmoor , there she also laid up her secret vow — that no earthly object should be placed between her and her father . The ebullition of feeling seemed to have restored Dr. May 's calmness , and he rose , saying , '
219879	219880	219871	219872	the man	8705	' '

219938	219977	219915	219915	you	0	' and , with these words , he left the room . Margaret and Ethel glanced at each other ; and both felt the impenetrability of Flora 's nature , so smooth , that all thrusts glided off . '
219985	219989	219996	219996	she	280	' said Ethel ; '
220003	220004	219996	219996	she	280	' '

220110	220172	220106	220106	I	0	' she said , always timid , and slightly defective in moral courage . She looked so nervous and shaken by the bare idea of a remonstrance with Flora , that Ethel could not press her ; and , though convinced that her representation would be useless , she owned that her conscience would rest better , after she had spoken . '
220185	220189	220193	220193	he	548	' she said . '
220198	220272	220176	220176	Flora	280	' So Ethel let it rest , and attended to the children 's lessons , during which Flora came into the drawing - room , and practised her music , as if nothing had happened . Before the morning was over , Ethel contrived to visit Norman , in the dining - room , where he was wo nt to study , and asked him whether he had made any impression on Flora . '

221014	221018	221011	221011	You	300	' said Norman . '

221057	221063	221049	221049	I	0	' said Ethel , humbly , '
221149	221150	221151	221151	You	300	' '
221156	221162	221163	221163	You	300	' said Norman , cheerfully . '
221194	221885	221183	221183	I	0	' A good deal of talk to him would have been more correct , if Norman had but been aware of it . He had been at the chief expense of the conversation with George Rivers , and had taken the sounds of assent , which he obtained , as evidences of his appreciation of all his views . Norman had been struggling so long against his old habit of looking down on Richard , and exalting intellect ; and had seen , in his Oxford life , so many ill - effects of the knowledge that puffeth up , that he had come to have a certain respect for dullness , per se , of which George Rivers easily reaped the benefit , when surrounded by the halo , which everything at Abbotstoke Grange bore in the eyes of Norman . He was heartily delighted at the proposed connexion , and his genuine satisfaction not only gratified Flora , and restored the equanimity that had been slightly disturbed by her father , but it also reassured Ethel and Margaret , who could not help trusting in his judgment , and began to hope that George might be all he thought him . Ethel , finding that there were two ways of viewing the gentleman , doubted whether she ought to express her opinion . It was Flora 's disposition , and the advantages of the match , that weighed most upon her , and , in spite of her surmise having been treated as so injurious , she could not rid herself of the burthen . Dr. May was not so much consoled by Norman 's opinion , as Ethel expected . The corners of his mouth curled up a little with diversion , and though he tried to express himself glad , and confident in his son 's judgment , there was the same sort of involuntary lurking misgiving , with which he had accepted Sir Matthew Fleet 's view of Margaret 's case . There was no danger that Dr. May would not be kind and courteous to the young man himself . It was not his fault if he were a dunce , and Dr. May perceived that his love for Flora was real , though clumsily expressed . He explained that he could not sanction the engagement till he should be better informed of the young gentleman 's antecedents ; this was , as George expressed it , a great nuisance , but his father agreed that it was quite right , in some doubt , perhaps , as to how Dr. May might be satisfied . Catherine Fanshawe 's Parody on Grey . Nothing transpired to the discredit of Lieutenant Rivers . He had spent a great deal of money , but chiefly for want of something else to do , and , though he was not a subject for high praise , there was no vice in him — no more than in an old donkey — as Dr. May declared , in his concluding paroxysm of despair , on finding that , though there was little to reconcile him to the engagement , there was no reasonable ground for thwarting his daughter 's wishes . He argued the matter once more with her , and , finding her purpose fixed , he notified his consent , and the rest of the family were admitted to a knowledge of the secret which they had never suspected . Etheldred could not help being gratified with the indignation it excited . With one voice , Mary and Blanche declared that they would never give up the title of " the detestable , " and would not make him any presents ; certainly , not watch - chains ! Miss Bracy , rather alarmed , lectured them just enough to make them worse ; and Margaret , overhearing Blanche instructing Aubrey in her own impertinences , was obliged to call her to her sofa , and assure her that she was unkind to Flora , and that she must consider Mr. George Rivers as her brother . '
221892	221898	221890	221890	Harry	257	' exclaimed Mary , indignantly . '
221907	221911	221905	221905	Alan	750	' exclaimed Blanche . '
221930	221931	221920	221920	I	0	' '
221945	222379	221943	221943	him	9160	' said Margaret . Blanche was so annihilated , that the sound of a carriage , and of the door bell , was a great satisfaction to her . Meta Rivers came flying into the room , her beautiful eyes dancing , and her cheeks glowing with pleasure , as , a little timidly , she kissed Margaret ; while Ethel , in a confused way , received Mr. Rivers , in pain for her own cold , abrupt manner , in contrast with his gentle , congratulating politeness . Meta asked , blushing , and with a hesitating voice , for their dear Flora ; Mary offered to call her , but Meta begged to go herself , and thus was spared the awkwardness that ensued . Ethel was almost vexed with herself , as ungrateful , when she saw Mr. Rivers so mildly kind , and so delighted , with the bland courtesy that seemed fully conscious of the favour that Flora had conferred on his son , and thankful to the Mays for accepting him . Margaret answered with more expression of gratification , than would have been sincere in Ethel ; but it was a relief , when Flora and Meta came in together , as pretty a contrast as could be seen ; the little dark - eyed fairy , all radiant with joy , clinging to the slender waist of Flora , whose quiet grace , and maidenly dignity , were never more conspicuous , than , as with a soft red mantling in her fair cheek , her eyes cast down , but with a simple , unaffected warmth of confidence and gratitude , she came forward to receive Mr. Rivers 's caressing affectionate greeting . Stiffness was over when she came in , and Dr. May , who presently made his appearance , soon was much more at his ease than could have been hoped , after his previous declarations that he should never be able to be moderately civil about it to Mr. Rivers . People of ready sympathy , such as Dr. May and Margaret , have a great deal of difficulty with their sincerity spared them , by being carried along with the feelings of others . Ethel could not feel the same , and was bent on avoiding any expression of opinion ; she hoped that Meta 's ecstacies would all be bestowed upon her future sister - in - law ; but Meta was eager for an interview with Ethel herself , and , as usual , gained her point . '
222390	222394	221943	221943	him	9160	' she cried . '
222404	222433	222434	222434	Ethel	300	' Ethel had not thought of this as a convenience of the connection , and she let Meta kiss her , and owned that it was very nice . '
222436	222440	222434	222434	Ethel	300	' said Meta , '

222472	222476	222465	222465	I	0	' said Ethel . '

223114	224258	223092	223092	Norman	548	' Meta clapped her hands , and said that she should tell her father , and Ethel parted with her , liking her , at least , better than ever . There was a comical scene between her and the Doctor , trying to define what relations they should become to each other , which Ethel thought did a good deal to mollify her father . The history of George 's life did more ; he took to pitying him , and pity was , indeed , akin to love in the good Doctor 's mind . In fact , George was a man who could be liked , when once regarded as a belonging — a necessity , not a choice ; for it was quite true that there was no harm in him , and a great deal of good - nature . His constant kindness , and evident liking for Margaret , stood him in good stead ; he made her a sort of confidante , bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of Flora 's perfections , and telling her how well he was getting on with " the old gentleman"—a name under which she failed to recognize her father . As to Tom , he wrote his congratulations to Ethel , that she might make a wedding present of her Etruscan vases , the Cupids on which must have been put there by anticipation . Richard heard none of the doubts , and gave kind , warm congratulations , promising to return home for the wedding ; and Mary and Blanche no sooner heard a whisper about bridesmaids , than all their opposition faded away , in a manner that quite scandalized Ethel , while it set Margaret on reminiscences of her having been a six - year old bridesmaid to Flora 's godmother , Mrs. Arnott . As to the gossip in the town , Ethel quite dreaded the sight of everyone without Flora to protect her , and certainly , Flora 's unaffected , quiet manner , was perfection , and kept off all too forward congratulations , while it gratified those whom she was willing to encourage . There was no reason for waiting , and Mr. Rivers was as impatient as his son , so an understanding arose that the wedding should take place near the end of the Christmas holidays . Flora shewed herself sensible and considerate . Always openhanded , her father was inclined to do everything liberally , and laid no restrictions on her preparations , but she had too much discretion to be profuse , and had a real regard for the welfare of the rest . She laughed with Ethel at the anticipations of the Stoneborough ladies that she must be going to London , and , at the requests , as a great favour , that they might be allowed the sight of her trousseau . Her wedding - dress , white silk , with a white cashmere mantle , was , indeed , ordered from Meta 's London dress - maker ; but , for the rest , she contented herself with an expedition to Whitford , accompanied by Miss Bracy and her two enchanted pupils , and there laid in a stock of purchases , unpretending and in good taste , aiming only at what could be well done , and not attempting the decorative wardrobe of a great lady . Ethel was highly amused when the Miss Andersons came for their inspection , to see their concealed disappointment at finding no under garments trimmed with Brussels , lace , nor pocket handkerchiefs all open - work , except a centre of the size of a crown - piece , and the only thing remarkable , was Margaret 's beautiful marking in embroidery . There was some compensation in the costly wedding presents — Flora had reaped a whole harvest from friends of her own , grateful patients of her father , and the whole Rivers and Langdale connection ; but , in spite of the brilliant uselessness of most of these , the young ladies considered themselves ill - used , thought Dr. May never would have been shabby , and were of opinion that , when Miss Ward had married her father 's surgical pupil , her outfit had been a far more edifying spectacle . The same moderation influenced Flora 's other arrangements . Dr. May was resigned to whatever might be thought most proper , stipulating only that he should not have to make a speech ; but Flora felt that , in their house , a grand breakfast would be an unsuccessful and melancholy affair . If the bride had been anyone else , she could have enjoyed making all go off well , but , under present circumstances , it would be great pain to her father and Margaret , a misery to Ethel , and something she dared not think of to the guests . She had no difficulty in having it dispensed with . George was glad to avoid " a great nuisance . " Mr. Rivers feared the fatigue , and , with his daughter , admired Flora for her amiability , and , as to the home party , no words could express their gratitude to her for letting them off . Mary and Blanche did , indeed , look rather blank , but Blanche was consoled , by settling with Hector , the splendours in store for Alan and Margaret , and Mary cared the less , as there would be no Harry to enjoy the fun . The bride - maiden 's glory was theirs by right , though Ethel was an unsatisfactory chief , for such as desired splendour . She protested against anything incongruous with January , or that could not be useful afterwards , and Meta took her part , laughing at the cruel stroke they were preparing for Bellairs . Ethel begged for dark silks and straw bonnets , and Flora said that she had expected to hear of brown stuff and grey duffle , but owned that they had better omit the ordinary muslin garb in the heart of winter . The baby bridesmaid was , at last , the chief consideration . Margaret suggested how pretty she and Blanche would look in sky - blue merino , trimmed with swan's - down . Meta was charmed with the idea , and though Ethel stuck out her shoulder - blades and poked out her head , and said she should look like the ugly duckling , she was clamorously reminded that the ugly duckling ended by being a swan , and promised that she should be allowed a bonnet of a reasonable size , trimmed with white , for Mr. Rivers '

It was a civil letter , but declined taking any steps in the matter , without more certain intelligence of the wishes of the Incumbent of the parish , or of the holders of the land in question . The Ladies abused all Colleges — as prejudiced old Bodies , and feared that it would be impossible to ask Mrs. Perkinson 's niece to take the school , while there was neither room nor lodging . So Miss Rich recorded the correspondence , and the vote of censure , by which it was to be hoped the Ladies '

224909	224915	224690	224690	Flora	280	' You forget the money ! '
224916	224997	224860	224860	Flora	280	' We will keep them from dissipating it — or that might be no harm ! A hundred pounds will be easily found , and we should then have it in our own hands .

225090	225095	225011	225011	Ethel	300	' said Ethel laughing . '

She thought she worked earnestly for them , and that her situation would be turned to their profit ; but there was something , for which she worked more earnestly . Had Flora never heard of the two masters , whom we can not serve at the same time ? Richard came home for '
225271	225365	225266	225267	a Parson	4825	' so as to include the wedding . He looked very fresh and youthful ; but his manner , though still gentle and retiring , had lost all that shrinking diffidence , and had , now , a very suitable grave composure . Everybody was delighted to have him ; and Ethel , more than anyone , except Margaret . What floods of Cocksmoor histories were poured upon him ; and what comparing of notes about his present school children ! He could not enter into the refinements of her dread of the Ladies '
225553	225649	225528	225528	Richard	298	' company , for composition was not easy to him , and the quantity of time he spent on it , quite alarmed Norman and Ethel , who both felt rather nervous on the Sunday morning , but agreed that preaching was not everything . Ethel could not see well , as far as the reading desk , but she saw her father glance up , take off his spectacles , wipe them , and put them away ; and she could not be displeased , though she looked reproof at Blanche 's breathless whisper , '
225657	225878	225652	225652	he	298	' Those white folds did truly suit well , with the meek , serious expression of the young Deacon 's fair face , and made him , as his sisters afterwards said , like one of the solemnly peaceful angel - carvings of the earlier ages . His voice was sweet and clear , and his reading full of quiet simplicity and devotion , such as was not often heard by that congregation , who were too much used , either to carelessness , or to pomposity . The sermon made his brother and sister ashamed of their fears . It was an exposition of the Gospel for the day , practical and earnest , going deep , and rising high , with a clearness and soberness , yet with a beauty and elevation , such as Norman and Ethel had certainly not expected — or , rather , they forgot all their own expectations , and Richard himself , and only recollected their own hearts , and the great future before them . Even Blanche and Aubrey told Margaret a great deal about it , and declared that , if Richard preached every Sunday , they should like going to Church much better . When Dr. May came in , some time after , he was looking much pleased . '
225884	225888	225881	225882	Mr. Ritchie	262	' he said , '
225921	226439	225912	225912	You	262	' Richard blushed distressfully , and quoted the saying , that it would be the true comfort to hear that people went home , thinking of themselves , rather than of the sermon . This put an end to the subject ; but the Doctor went over it again , most thoroughly , with his other children , who were greatly delighted . Flora 's last home Sunday ! She was pale and serious , evidently feeling much , though seeking no tête à têtes , and chiefly engrossed with waiting on Margaret , or fondling little Gertrude . No one saw the inside of her mind — probably , she did not herself . On the outside was a very suitable pensiveness , and affection for all that she was leaving . The only one in the family , to whom she talked much , was Norman , who continued to see many perfections in George , and contrived , by the force of his belief , to impress the same on the others ; and to make them think his great talent for silence , such a proof of his discretion , that they were not staggered , even by his shy blundering exclamation , that his wedding would be a great nuisance — a phrase which , as Dr. May observed , was , to him , what Est il possible was to his namesake of Denmark . Nobody wished for any misgivings , so Richard was never told of any , though there was a careful watch kept , to see what were his first impressions . None transpired , except something about good nature , but it was shrewdly believed that Richard and George , being much alike in shy unwillingness to speak , had been highly satisfied with the little trouble they had caused to each other , and so had come to a tacit esteem . There was very little bustle of preparation . Excepting the packing , everything went on much as usual , till the Thursday morning , and then the children were up early , refreshing the Christmas hollies , and working up their excitement , only to have it damped by the suppressed agitation of their elders at the breakfast - table . Dr. May did not seem to know what he was about ; and Flora looked paler and paler . She went away before the meal was over , and , when Ethel went to the bed - room , shortly after , she found that she had fairly broken down , and was kneeling beside Margaret 's sofa , resting her head on her sister 's bosom , and sobbing — as Ethel had never seen her weep , except on that dreadful night , after their mother 's death . In a person ordinarily of such self - command as Flora , weeping was a terrible thing , and Margaret was much distressed and alarmed ; but the worst had passed before Ethel came up , and Flora was able to speak . '
226458	226459	226460	226460	You	249	' '
226472	226478	226460	226460	You	249	' said Margaret , fondly . '
226492	226881	226483	226483	I	0	' Ethel thought she caught those words ; but , no more , Mary 's step was heard , and Flora was on her feet , instantly , composing herself rapidly . She shed no more tears , but her eyelids were very heavy , and her face softened , in a manner that , though she was less pretty than usual , was very becoming under her bridal veil . She recovered calmness , and even cheerfulness , while reversing the usual order of things , and dressing her bridemaids , who would never have turned out fit to be seen , but for the exertions of herself , Margaret , and Miss Bracy . Ethel 's long Scotch bones , and Mary 's round , dumpy shapelessness , were , in their different ways , equally hard to overcome ; and the one was swelled out with a fabulous number of petticoats , and the other pinched in , till she gasped and screamed for mercy , while Blanche and Gertrude danced about , beautiful to behold , under their shady hats ; and presently , with a light tap at the door , Meta Rivers stepped in , looking so pretty , that all felt , that to try to attain to such an appearance , was vain . Timid in her affection , she hardly dared to do more than kiss them , and whisper her pretty caressing words to each . There was no more time — Dr. Hoxton 's carriage was come to take up the bride . Ethel did as she was told , without much volition of her own ; and she quitted the carriage , and was drawn into her place by Norman , trusting that Meta would not let her do wrong , and relieved that , just in front of her , were the little ones , over whose heads she could see her father , with Flora 's veiled bending figure . That pause , while the procession was getting into order , the slow movement up the centre aisle , the week - day atmosphere of the Church , brought back to her thoughts a very different time , and one of those strange echoings on the mind , repeated in her ears the words , '
226896	227157	226883	226883	man	913	' There was a little pause — George did not seem to be forthcoming , and Meta turned round , rather uneasily , and whispered something about his having been so nervous . However , there he was , looking exceedingly red , and very sheepish , and disposed to fall back on his best - man , Norman , whose countenance was at the brightest — and almost handsome . Dr. Hoxton performed the ceremony , " assisted by " Richard . It had been Flora 's choice ; and his loud sonorous voice was thought very impressive . Blanche stood the nearest , and looked happy , and important , with Flora 's glove . Gertrude held Mary 's hand , and gazed straight up into the fretted roof , as if that were to her the chief marvel . Ethel stood and knelt , but did not seem , to herself , to have the power of thinking , or feeling . She saw and heard — that was all ; she could not realize . They drew her forward , when it was over , to sign her name , as witness . She took up the pen , looked at the Flora May , written for the last time , and found her hand so trembling , that she said , half - smiling , that she could not write . Mary was only too well pleased to supply the deficiency . Dr. May looked at her anxiously , and asked whether she felt overcome . '
227171	228067	228068	228068	I	0	' He took it into his , and pressed it . Ethel knew , then , how much had been undeveloped in her own mind , catching it , as it were , from his touch , and look . The thought of his past joy — the sad fading of hope for Margaret — the fear and doubt for their present bride — above all , the sense that the fashion of this world passeth away ; and that it is not the outward scene , but our bearing in it , that is to last for ever . The bells struck up , each peal ending with a crash , that gave Ethel some vague idea of fatality ; and they all came back to the house , where Margaret was ready , in the drawing - room , to receive them , looking very pretty , in her soft blue dress , which especially became her fair complexion , and light brown hair . Ethel did not quite like the pink colour on her cheeks , and feared that she had been shaken by Flora 's agitation , in the morning ; but she was very calm and bright , in the affectionate greeting with which she held out her hands to the bride and bridegroom , as they came in . Mr. Rivers and Meta were the only guests , and , while Meta was seized by the children , Margaret lay talking to Mr. Rivers , George standing upright and silent behind her sofa , like a sentinel . Flora was gone to change her dress , not giving way , but nervous and hurried , as she reiterated parting directions about household comforts to Ethel , who stood by the toilette - table , sticking a pin into the pincushion and drawing it out again , as if solely intent on making it always fit into the same hole , while Mary dressed Flora , packed , flew about , and was useful . As they came down stairs , Ethel found that Flora was trembling from head to foot , and leaning on her ; Dr. May stood at the foot of the stairs , and folded his daughter in a long embrace ; Flora gave herself up to it as if she would never bear to leave it . Did a flash come over her then , what the father was , whom she had held cheaply ? what was the worth of that for which she had exchanged such a home ? She spoke not a word , she only clung tightly — if her heart failed her — it was too late " Bless you ! my child ! " he said at last . " Only be what your mother was ! " A coming tread warned them to part . There was a tray of luncheon for the two who were about to depart , and the great snow - white cake was waiting for Flora to cut it . She smiled , accomplished that feat steadily , and Norman continuing the operation , Aubrey guided Gertrude in handing round the slices . George did full justice thereto , as well as to the more solid viands . Flora could taste nothing , but she contrived to smile and say it was too early . She was in haste to have it over now , and , as soon as George had finished , she rose up , still composed and resolved , the last kisses were given — Gertrude was lifted up to her , after she was in the carriage for the very last , when George proposed to run away with her also , whereupon Daisy kicked and screamed , and was taken back in haste . The door was shut , and they drove off , bound for the Continent , and then Mary , as if the contingency of losing Flora had only for the first time occurred to her as the consequence of the wedding , broke out into a piteous fit of sobbing — rather too unrestrained , considering her fourteen years . Poor Mary , she was a very child still ! They pulled her into the study , out of the way of Mr. Rivers , and Meta had no sooner said how Flora would soon come home and live at the Grange , and talked of the grand school - feast , to which she was at once going to take her friends , than the round rosy face drew out of its melancholy puckers into smiles , as Mary began to tell the delight caused by the invitations which she had conveyed . That was to be a feast indeed — all the Abbotstoke children — all Flora 's class at Stoneborough , and as many Cocksmoor scholars as could walk so far , were to dine on Christmas fare , at one o'clock , at the Grange , and Meta was in haste to be at home to superintend the feast . Mary , Blanche , and Aubrey went with her , under the keeping of Miss Bracy , the boys were to follow . She had hoped for Ethel , but on looking at her , ceased her coaxing importunity . '

228262	229032	228249	228249	I	0	' And quiet it was in another hour — Gertrude walking with the nurses , Dr. May gone to his patients , and all the rest at Abbotstoke , except Richard and Margaret down - stairs ; and Ethel , who , while arranging her properties in her new room , had full leisure to lay out before herself the duties that had devolved on her , and to grapple with them . She recalled the many counsels that she had received from Flora , and they sounded so bewildering , that she wished it had been Conic sections , and then she looked at a Hebrew grammar that Norman had given her , and gave a sigh as she slipped it into the shelf of the seldom used . She looked about the room , cleared out the last piece of brown paper , and burnt the last torn envelope , that no relic of packing and change might distress Margaret 's eyes for order — then feeling at once desolate and intrusive , she sat down in Flora 's fire - side chair , opened her desk , and took out her last time - table . She looked at it for some minutes , laid it aside , and rising , knelt down . Again seating herself , she resumed her paper , took a blank one , ruled it , and wrote her rules for each hour of each day in the week . That first hour after breakfast , when hitherto she had been free , was one sacrifice — it must go now , to ordering dinner , seeing after stores , watching over the children 's clothes , and the other non - descripts , which , happily for her , Flora had already reduced to method . The other loss was the spare time between the walk and tea ; she must not spend that in her own room now , or there would be no one to sit with Margaret , or keep the little ones from being troublesome to her . Ethel had often had to give up this space before , when Flora went out in the evening , and she had seldom felt otherwise than annoyed . Give it up for good ! that was the cure for temper , but it had been valuable as something of her own ! She would have been thankful could she have hoped to keep regularly to her own rules , but that she knew was utterly improbable — boys , holidays , callers , engagements , Dr. May , would all conspire to turn half her days upside down , and Cocksmoor itself must often depend not only on the weather , but on home doings . Two or three notes she wrote at the foot of her paper . N. B. These are a standard — not a bed of Procrustes . Musts — To be first consulted . — Mays — last . Ethel May 's last of all . If I can not do everything — omit the self - chosen . Mem . — Neither hurry when it depends on myself , nor fidget when it depends on others . Keep a book going , to pacify myself . Her rules drawn up , Ethel knelt once more . Then she drew a long sigh , and wondered where Flora was ; and next , as she was fairly fagged , mind and body , she threw herself back in the armchair , took up a railway novel that Hector had brought home , and which they had hidden from the children , and repaired herself with the luxury of an idle reading . Margaret and Richard likewise spent a peaceful , though pensive afternoon . Margaret had portions of letters from Alan to read to him , and a consultation to hold . The hope of her full recovery had so melted away , that she had , in every letter , striven to prepare Mr. Ernescliffe for the disappointment , and each that she received in return was so sanguine and affectionate , that the very fondness was as much grief as joy . She could not believe that he took in the true state of the case , or was prepared to perceive that she could never be his wife , and she wanted Richard to write one of his clear , dispassionate statements , such as carried full conviction , and to help to put a final end to the engagement .

229636	229684	229634	229634	Margaret	249	' And government , and management , and influence — you would not guess what dreams I used to waste on them , and now here am I set aside from it all , good for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind to . '
229685	229692	229694	229694	Richard	298	' They would not say so , '
229698	229787	229694	229694	Richard	298	' Not say it , but I feel it . Papa and Ethel are all the world to each other — Richard , I may say it to you — There has been only one thing more hard to bear than that — Don't suppose there was a moment 's neglect , or disregard ; but when first I understood that Ethel could be more to him than I — then I could not always feel rightly . It was the punishment for always wanting to be first . '
229788	229806	229634	229634	Margaret	249	' My father would be grieved that you had the notion . You should not keep it . '
229807	229816	229818	229818	Margaret	249	' He does not know it is so , '
229820	229874	229818	229818	Margaret	249	' I am his first care , I fear , his second grief ; but it is not in the nature of things that Ethel should not be more his comfort and companion . Oh ! I am glad it was not she who married ! What shall we do when she goes ? '

233885	233914	233883	233883	Meta	402	' No ; but he is a great friend of Norman 's , and a Scottish cousin — Norman Ogilvie . Norman has his name from the Ogilvies . '
233915	233929	233931	233931	Flora	280	' Our grandmother , Mrs. Mackenzie , was a daughter of Lord Glenbracken , '
233933	233946	233948	233948	Ethel	300	' This man might be called the Master of Glenbracken at home , '
233950	234075	233948	233948	Ethel	300	' It is such a pretty title , and there is a beautiful history belonging to them . There was a Master of Glenbracken who carried James IV . 's standard at Flodden , and would not yield , and was killed with it wrapped round his body , and the Lion was dyed with his blood . Mamma knew some scraps of a ballad about him . Then they were out with Montrose , and had their castle burnt by the Covenanters , and since that they have been Jacobites , and one barely escaped being beheaded at Carlisle ! I want to hear the rights of it ! Norman is to go , some time or other , to stay at Glenbracken ! '

This is the only son , and very good and clever — he preferred going to Balliol , that he might work ; but he is a great sportsman , George , '
234154	234175	234152	234152	she	280	' you will get on with him very well , about fishing , and grouse shooting , I dare say . '

234439	234454	234456	234456	Flora	280	' Then , I hope we have been preparing an agreeable surprise for him , '

234509	234562	234474	234474	she	280	' O , very well ; it is as you please . I though it would please Stoneborough , and that Edward was a protégé of yours . What has he been doing ? Did we not hear he had been distinguishing himself ? Dr. Hoxton was boasting of his two scholars . '
234563	234567	234569	234569	Norman	548	' Ask him , '
234573	234577	234579	234579	he	548	' At least , '

One generally knows the crack passages — something beginning with " O woman ! " but it is well to be in readiness — if you would only forewarn me of the telling hits ? '
235149	235157	235159	235159	Ethel	300	' If they can not tell themselves , '
235163	235173	235159	235159	Ethel	300	' I do n't think they deserve the name . '
235174	235197	235065	235065	she	300	' Perhaps you think what does tell on the undergraduates , collectively , is not always what ought to tell on them . '
235198	235220	235065	235065	she	300	' I do n't know . I dare say the same would not be a favourite with them and with me . '
235221	235244	235246	235246	he	5006	' I should like to know which are your favourites . No doubt you have a copy here — made by yourself — '

235291	235304	235279	235279	he	5006	' he told me the thoughts were more yours than his own . '
235305	235335	235260	235260	she	300	' Did he ? That was not fair . One thought was an old one , long ago talked over between us ; the rest is all his own . '
235356	235359	235360	235360	he	5006	' Yes , '
235365	235384	235360	235360	he	5006	' May goes deep — deeper than most men — though I doubt whether they will applaud this . '

235400	235411	235398	235398	Ethel	300	' It is rather to be felt than shouted at . '
235412	235440	235442	235443	Norman Ogilvie	548	' And I do n't know how the world would go on if it were felt . Few men would do much without the hope of fame , '
235445	235455	235457	235457	Ethel	300	' Is it the question what they would do ? '
235459	235478	235457	235457	Ethel	300	' So you call fame a low motive ? I see where your brother 's philosophy comes from . '
235488	235494	235457	235457	Ethel	300	' Her pause was expressive . '

236965	236969	236963	236963	her	5051	' she said : '
236991	237021	236976	236976	you	227	' She stopped short , frightened at his pale look . He spoke in a clear low tone , that seemed to thrill her with a sort of alarm . '

237049	237923	237041	237041	I	0	' she began ; but he made a gesture as if he would not hear , and , at the same moment , Mr. Ogilvie entered the room . Had Ethel been at home , she would have pondered much over her brother 's meaning — here she had no leisure . Not only was she fully occupied with the new scenes around , but her Scottish cousin took up every moment open to conversation . He was older than Norman , and had just taken his degree , and he talked with that superior aplomb , which a few years bestow at their time of life , without conceit , but more hopeful and ambitious , and with higher spirits than his cousin . Though industrious and distinguished , he had not avoided society or amusement , was a great cricketer and tennis - player , one of the " eight " whose success in the boat - races was one of Norman 's prime interests , and he told stories of frolics that reminded Ethel of her father 's old Cambridge adventures . He was a new variety in her eyes , and entertained her greatly . Where the bounds of banter ended , was not easy to define , but whenever he tried a little mystification , she either entered merrily into the humour , or threw it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the stretch . They were always discovering odd , unexpected bits of knowledge in each other , and a great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appeared on the surface , for his enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on hers , though he was too good and serious at heart to carry it too far . At Blenheim , perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense , and made her believe , as Meta really did , that the Duchess Sarah was his model woman ; for as they walked in the park in search of Phoebe Mayflower 's well , he gathered a fern leaf , to shew her the Glenbracken badge , and talked to her of his home , his mother , and his sister Marjorie , and the little Church in the rocky glen . He gave the history of the stolen meetings of the little knot of Churchmen during the days of persecution , and shewed a heart descended straight from the Ogilvie who was " out with Montrose , " now that the upper structure of young England was for a little while put aside . After this , she took his jokes much more coolly , and made thrusts beneath them , which he seemed to enjoy , and caused him to unfold himself the more . She liked him all the better for finding that he thought Norman had been a very good friend to him , and that he admired her brother heartily , watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself unhappy . He confided to her that , much as he rejoiced in the defeats of Anderson , he feared that the reading and thought consequent on the discussions , had helped to overstrain Norman 's mind , and he was very anxious to carry him away from all study , and toil , and make his brains rest , and his eyes delight themselves upon Scottish mountains . Thereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery , especially his own glen with the ruined tower , and ardent wishes that his cousin Ethel could see them also , and know Marjorie . She could quite echo the wish , Edinburgh and Loch Katrine had been the visions of her life , and now that she had once taken the leap and left home , absence did not seem impossible , and , with a start of delight , she hailed her own conviction that he intended his mother to invite the party to Glenbracken . After Norman 's visit , Mr. Ogilvie declared that he must come home with him and pay his long - promised visit to Stoneborough . He should have come long ago . He had been coming last winter , but the wedding had prevented him ; he had always wished to know Dr. May , whom his father well remembered , and now nothing should keep him away ! Flora looked on amused and pleased at Ethel 's development — her abruptness softened into piquancy , and her countenance so embellished , that the irregularity only added to the expressiveness . There was no saying what Ethel would come to ! She had not said that she would not go to the intended ball , and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing fainter every day . The discussion about Harvey Anderson was never revived ; Flora sent the invitation without another word — he came with half - a - dozen other gentlemen — Ethel made him a civil greeting , but her head was full of boats and the procession day , about which Mr. Ogilvie was telling her , and she thought of him no more . '
237928	237932	237041	237041	I	0	' thought Flora . '
237968	238690	238691	238691	I	0	' It would make stay - at - home people giddy to record how much pleasure , how much conversation and laughter were crowded into those ten days , and with much thought and feeling beside them , for these were not girls on whom grave Oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety . The whole party was very full of merriment . Norman May , especially , on whom Flora contrived to devolve that real leadership of conversation that should rightly have belonged to George Rivers , kept up the ball with wit and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth ; enlivened George into being almost an agreeable man , and drew out little Meta 's vivacity into sunny sparkles . Meta generally had Norman for her share , and seemed highly contented with his lionizings , which were given much more quietly and copiously than those which his cousin bestowed upon his sister . Or if there were anything enterprising to be done , any tower to be mounted , or anything with the smallest spice of danger in it , Meta was charmed , and with her lightness and airiness of foot and figure , and perfectly feminine ways , showed a spirit of adventure that added to the general diversion . But if she were to be helped up or down anywhere , she certainly seemed to find greater security in Norman May 's assistance , though it was but a feather - like touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step . Both as being diffident , and , in a manner at home , Norman was not as constantly her cavalier as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister ; and , when supplanted , his wo nt was either to pioneer for Flora , or , if she did not need him , to walk alone , grave and abstracted . There was a weight on his brow , when nothing was going on to drive it away , and whether it were nervousness as to the performance in store for him , anxiety about Harry , or , as Mr. Ogilvie said , too severe application ; some burthen hung upon him , that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the enjoyment of the party . On Sunday evening , when they had been entering into the almost vision - like delight of the choicest of music , and other accompaniments of Church service , they went to walk in Christchurch meadows . They had begun altogether by comparing feelings — Ethel wondering whether Stoneborough Minster would ever be used as it might be , and whether , if so , they should be practically the better for it ; and proceeding with metaphysics on her side , and satire on Norman Ogilvie 's , to speculate whether that which is , is best , and the rights and wrongs of striving for change and improvements , what should begin from above , and what from beneath — with illustrations often laughter - moving , though they were much in earnest , as the young heir of Glenbracken looked into his future life . Flora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor old Mr. Ramsden , and walked , keeping her husband amused with instances of his blunders . Meta , as with Norman she parted from the rest , thought her own dear Abbotstoke Church , and Mr. Charles Wilmot , great subjects for content and thanksgiving , though it was a wonderful treat to see and hear such as she had enjoyed to - day ; and she thought it was a joy , to carry away abidingly , to know that praise and worship , as near perfection as this earth could render them , were being offered up . Norman understood her thought , but responded by more of a sigh than was quite comfortable . Meta went on with her own thoughts , on the connection between worship and good works , how the one leads to the other , and how praise , with pure lips is , after all , the great purpose of existence . — Her last thought she spoke aloud .

239171	239178	239162	239162	Meta	402	' she said , rather bewildered ; '

239212	239245	239195	239195	he	5069	' eagerly said Norman , standing still . " Believe — " said Meta , hardly knowing how she came to choose the words . " I believe ! " he repeated . '

239561	239565	239557	239557	I	0	' she said ; '
239610	240520	240521	240521	Ethel	300	' Meta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk . She was anything but unfeeling , but she had a confidence in Norman that forbade her to see anything here but one of his variations of spirits , which always sank in the hour of triumph . She put forth her brightness to enliven him , and , in their subsequent tête à têtes , she avoided all that could lead to a renewal of this conversation . Ethel would not have rested till it had been fought out . Meta thought it so imaginary , that it had better die for want of the aliment of words ; certainly , hers could not reach an intellect like his , and she would only soothe and amuse him . Dr. May , mind - curer , as well as body - curer , would soon be here , to put the climax to the general joy , and watch his own son . He did arrive ; quite prepared to enjoy , giving an excellent account of both homes ; Mr. Rivers very well , and the Wilmots taking care of him , and Margaret as comfortable as usual , Mary making a most important and capable little housekeeper , Miss Bracy as good as possible . He talked as if they had all flourished the better for Ethel 's absence , but he had evidently missed her greatly , as he shewed , without knowing it , by his instant eagerness to have her to himself . Even Norman , prizeman as he was , was less wanted . There was proud affection , eager congratulation , for him , but it was Ethel to whom he wanted to tell everything that had passed during her absence — whom he treated as if they were meeting after a tedious separation . They dined rather early , and went out afterwards , to walk down the High Street to Christ Church Meadow . Norman and Ethel had been anxious for this ; they thought it would give their father the best idea of the tout ensemble of Oxford , and were not without hopes of beating him by his own confession , in that standing fight between him and his sons , as to the beauties of Oxford and Cambridge — a fight in which , hitherto , they had been equally matched — neither partizan having seen the rival University . Flora staid at home ; she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous duties of following the two young ladies about , and was very glad to give her father the keeping of them . Dr. May held out his arm to Ethel — Norman secured his peculiar property . Ethel could have preferred that it should be otherwise — Norman would have no companion but George Rivers ; how bored he would be ! All through the streets , while she was telling her father the names of the buildings , she was not giving her whole attention ; she was trying to guess , from the sounds behind , whether Mr. Ogilvie were accompanying them . They entered the meadows — Norman turned round , with a laugh , to defy the Doctor to talk of the Cam , on the banks of the Isis . The party stood still — the other two gentlemen came up . They amalgamated again — all the Oxonians conspiring to say spiteful things of the Cam , and Dr. May making a spirited defence , in which Ethel found herself impelled to join . In the wide gravelled path , they proceeded in threes ; George attached himself to his sister and Norman . Mr. Ogilvie came to Ethel 's other side , and began to point out all the various notabilities . Ethel was happy again ; her father was so much pleased and amused , with him , and he with her father , that it was a treat to look on . Presently , Dr. May , as usual , always meeting with acquaintances , fell in with a county neighbour , and Ethel had another pleasant aside , until her father claimed her , and Mr. Ogilvie was absorbed among another party , and lost to her sight . He came to tea , but , by that time , Dr. May had established himself in the chair , which had , hitherto , been appropriated to her cousin , a chair that cut her nook off from the rest of the world , and made her the exclusive possession of the occupant . There was a most interesting history for her to hear , of a meeting with the Town Council , which she had left pending , when Dr. May had been battling to save the next presentation of the living from being sold . Few subjects could affect Ethel more nearly , yet she caught herself missing the thread of his discourse , in trying to hear what Mr. Ogilvie was saying to Flora about a visit to Glenbracken . The time came for the two Balliol men to take their leave . Norman May had been sitting very silent all the evening , and Meta , who was near him , respected his mood . When he said good - night , he drew Ethel outside the door . '
240523	240527	240521	240521	Ethel	300	' he said , '
240546	240547	240563	240563	them	5081	' '
240551	240558	240563	240563	them	5081	' said Ethel , half smiling ; '

240620	240626	240627	240627	I	0	' said he to Ethel , '
240666	240667	240634	240634	He	298	' '
240674	240680	240634	240634	He	298	' said Norman , sighing . '
240694	240941	240942	240942	He	5084	' Dr. May laughed a good deal at the request , and asked if the rest of the party were to be blindfolded . Meta wondered that Ethel should have mentioned the request so publicly ; she was a good deal touched by it , and she thought Dr. May ought to be so . Good - night was said , and Dr. May put his arm round Ethel , and gave her the kiss that she had missed for seven nights . It was very homelike , and it brought a sudden flash of thought across Ethel ! What had she been doing ? She had been impatient of her father 's monopoly of her ! She parted with Flora , and entered the room she shared with Meta , where Bellairs waited to attend her little mistress . Few words passed between the two girls , and those chiefly on the morrow 's dress . Meta had some fixed ideas — she should wear pink . Norman had said he liked her pink bonnet , and then she could put down her white veil , so that he could be certain that she was not looking ; Ethel vaguely believed Flora meant her to wear — something — Bellairs went away , and Meta gave expression to her eager hope that Norman would go through it well . If he would only read it , as he did last Easter to her and Ethel . '

241441	241880	241424	241424	you	5095	' Very different were the feelings with which those two young girls stretched themselves in their beds that night . Margaret Rivers 's innocent , happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation . Admiration , sympathy , and the exultation for him , which he would not feel for himself , drew little Meta entirely out of herself — a self that never held her much . She was proud of the slender thread of connexion between them ; she was confident that his vague fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive mind , and , as she fell sound asleep , she murmured broken lines of Decius , mixed with promises not to look . Etheldred heard them , for there was no sleep for her . She had a parley to hold with herself , and to accuse her own feelings of having been unkind , ungrateful , undutiful towards her father . What had a fit of vanity brought her to ? that she should have been teazed by what would naturally have been her greatest delight ! her father 's pleasure in being with her . Was this the girl who had lately vowed within herself that her father should be her first earthly object ? At first , Ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience , but another conviction crossed her , and not an unpleasing one , though it made her cheeks tingle with maidenly shame , at having called it up . Throughout this week , Norman Ogilvie had certainly sought her out . He had looked disappointed this evening — there was no doubt that he was attracted by her — by her , plain , awkward Ethel ! Such a perception assuredly never gave so much pleasure to a beauty as it did to Ethel , who had always believed herself far less good - looking than she really was . It was a gleam of delight , and , though she set herself to scold it down , the conviction was elastic , and always leapt up again . That resolution came before her , but it had been unspoken ; it could not be binding , and , if her notion were really right , the misty brilliant future of mutual joy dazzled her ! But there was another side : her father oppressed and lonely , Margaret ill and pining , Mary , neither companion nor authority , the children running wild ; and she , who had mentally vowed never to forsake her father , far away , enjoying her own happiness . '
241896	241900	241901	241901	I	0	' thought Ethel , '
241929	242280	242281	242281	I	0	' It was a great struggle — on one side there was the deceitful guise of modesty , telling her it was absurd to give so much importance to the kindness of the first cousin , with whom she had ever been thrown ; there was the dislike to vex Flora to make a discussion , and break up the party . There was the desire to hear the concert , to go to the breakfast at — College , to return round by Warwick Castle , and Kenilworth , as designed . Should she lose all this for a mere flattering fancy . She , who had laughed at Miss Boulder , for imagining every one who spoke to her was smitten . What reason could she assign ? It would be simply ridiculous , and unkind — and it was so very pleasant . Mr. Ogilvie would be too wise to think of so incongruous a connexion , which would be so sure to displease his parents . It was more absurd than ever to think of it . The heir of Glenbracken , and a country physician 's daughter ! That was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to accept this disparity as an objection , was an additional evidence that she ought to flee from further intercourse . She believed that no harm was done yet ; she was sure that she loved her father better than anything else in the world , and whilst she did so , it was best to preserve her heart for him . Widowed as he was , she knew that he would sorely miss her , and that for years to come , she should be necessary at home . She had better come away while it would cost only a slight pang , for that it was pain to leave Norman Ogilvie , was symptom enough of the need of not letting her own silly heart go further . However it might be with him , another week would only make it worse with her . '
242288	242449	242450	242450	Papa	7391	' was the ultimatum reached by each chain of mental reasonings , and borne in after each short prayer for guidance , as Ethel tossed about listening to the perpetual striking of all the Oxford clocks , until daylight had begun to shine in ; when she fell asleep , and was only waked by Meta , standing over her with a sponge , looking very mischievous , as she reminded her of their appointment with Dr. May , to go to the early service in New College Chapel . The world looked different that morning with Ethel , but the determination was fixed , and the service strengthened it . She was so silent during the walk , that her companions rallied her , and they both supposed she was anxious about Norman ; but taking her opportunity , when Meta was gone to prepare for breakfast , she rushed , in her usual way , into the subject .

242966	243006	242962	242962	Flora	280	' but I will take care of you , Ethel . It is everything delightful . You are the very girl for such a héros de Roman , and it has embellished you more than all my Paris fineries . '

243198	243201	243203	243203	Flora	280	' Tempted ! '
243207	243215	243203	243203	Flora	280	' Is it such a wicked thing ? '
243216	243241	242882	242882	Ethel	300	' Not in others , but it would be wrong in me , with such a state of things as there is at home . '
243242	243271	242882	242882	Ethel	300	' I do not suppose he would want you for some years to come . He is only two - and - twenty . Mary will grow older . '
243272	243296	243203	243203	Flora	280	' Margaret will either be married , or want constant care . Flora , I will not let myself be drawn from them . '
243297	243378	242882	242882	Ethel	300	' You may think so now ; but it would be for their real good to relieve papa of any of us . If we were all to think as you do , how should we live ? I do n't know — for papa told me there will be barely ten thousand pounds , besides the houses , and what will that be among ten ? I am not talking of yourself , but , think of the others ! '
243379	243397	243399	243399	Ethel	300	' I know papa will not be happy without me , and I will not leave him , '

243426	243470	243423	243423	she	280	' when it would be very foolish to break up our plans , only because we have found a pleasant cousin . There is nothing serious in it , I dare say . How silly of us to argue on such an idea ! '
243489	243495	243481	243481	Ethel	300	' It will be safer ! '

243641	243647	243639	243639	he	1116	' asked Ethel , anxiously . '

243679	243683	243660	243660	he	1116	' said Ethel . '
243687	243692	243700	243700	he	1116	' continued her cousin ; '

243786	243795	243759	243759	He	1116	' said Ethel , glancing towards the paper , '
243802	243828	243759	243759	He	1116	' He looked ; and while she was thinking whether she ought not to depart , he exclaimed , in a tone that startled her , '
243841	243842	243759	243759	He	1116	' '
243849	243884	243759	243759	He	1116	' Nothing then , I assure you . See , it is merely this — she has not come into Sydney so soon as expected , which you knew before . That is all . '
243885	243890	243892	243894	the trembling Ethel	300	' Let me see , '
243972	243976	243977	243977	she	300	' But Norman ! '
243980	244046	243977	243977	she	300	' Ah ! true . Poor May ! He will break down , to a certainty , if he hears it . I will go at once , and keep guard over him , lest he should meet with this paper . But , pray do n't be alarmed . I assure you there is no cause . You will have letters to - morrow . '
245154	245155	245156	245156	We	5157	' '
245163	245168	245156	245156	We	5157	' said Dr. May ; '
245198	245204	245207	245207	papa	7391	' Norman started up crying , '
245209	245210	245207	245207	papa	7391	' '
245219	245224	245207	245207	papa	7391	' said Dr. May , '
245231	245300	245207	245207	papa	7391	' and he shewed his son the paragraph , which Norman read as a death warrant — the colour ebbed from his lips and cheeks — he trembled so , that he was obliged to sit down , and , without speaking , he kept his eyes fixed on the words , " Serious apprehensions are entertained with regard to H. M. S. Alcestis , Captain Gordon — " '
245327	245331	245317	245317	you	7391	' said Dr. May. '
245344	245482	245317	245317	you	7391	' And Meta added that , at luncheon , she had been seated next to one of the honorary doctors — a naval captain — who had been making discoveries in the South Sea , and that he had scouted the notion of harm befalling the Alcestis , and given all manner of reassuring suppositions as to her detention , adding besides , that no one believed the Australian paper , whence the report was taken . He had seen the Alcestis , knew Captain Gordon , and spoke of him as one of the safest people in the world . Had his acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen , it would have been perfect — as it was , the tidings brought back the blood to Norman 's cheek , and the light to his eye . '
245489	245495	245317	245317	you	7391	' was Norman 's question . '
245499	245503	245317	245317	you	7391	' said Ethel . '
245510	245511	245508	245508	papa	7391	' '
245539	245597	245534	245534	Norman	548	' Norman was bent on returning , but his father and Flora would not hear of it . Flora could not spare him , and Dr. May was afraid of the effect of anxiety on nerves and spirits so sensitive . While this was going on , Mr. Ogilvie looked at Ethel in consternation , and said , '
245604	245605	245534	245534	Norman	548	' '
245621	246175	245617	245617	she	8852	' He looked down — Ethel had the resolution to walk away . Flora could not give up the ball , and Meta found that she must go ; but both the Normans spent a quiet evening with Dr. May and Ethel . Norman May had a bad headache , which he was allowed to have justly earned ; Dr. May was very happy reviving all his Scottish recollections , and talking to young Ogilvie about Edinburgh . — Once , there was a private consultation . Ethel was provoked and ashamed at the throbs that it would excite . What ! on a week 's acquaintance ? — When alone with her father , she began to nerve herself for something heroic , and great was her shame when she heard only of her cousin 's kind consideration for her brother , whom he wished to take home with him , and thence to see the Highlands , so as to divert his anxiety for Harry , as well as to call him off from the studies with which he had this term overworked himself even more than usual . Dr. May had given most grateful consent , and he spoke highly in praise of the youth ; but there was no more to come , and Ethel could have beaten herself for the moment of anticipation . Meta came home , apologizing for wakening Ethel — but Ethel had not been asleep . The ball had not , it seemed , been as charming to her as most events were , and Ethel heard a sigh , as the little lady lay down in her bed . Late as it was when she went to rest , Meta rose to see the travellers off — she sent hosts of messages to her father , and wished she might go with them . George and Flora were not visible , and Dr. May was leaving messages for them , and for Norman , in her charge , when the two Balliol men walked in . Ethel had hoped it was over , yet she could not be sorry that the two youths escorted them to the station , and , as Ethel was placed in the carriage , she believed that she heard something of never forgetting — happiest week — but in the civilities which the other occupant of the carriage was offering for the accommodation of their lesser luggage , she lost the exact words , and the last she heard were , " Good bye — I hope you will find letters at home . " True to the kindred points of Heaven and home . Wordsworth . Etheldred 's dream was over . She had wakened to the inside of a Great Western carriage , her father beside her , and opposite a thin , foreign - looking gentleman . Her father , to whom her life was to be devoted ! She looked at his profile , defined against the window , and did not repent . In a sort of impulse to do something for him , she took his hat from his hand , and was going to dispose of it in the roof , when he turned , smiling his thanks , but saying , '
246192	246205	246206	246206	Dick	575	' The stranger at that moment sprang to his feet , exclaiming , '
246209	246210	246207	246207	himself	575	' '
246220	246257	246218	246218	you	594	' cried Dr. May , in a voice of equal amazement and joy , holding out his hand , which was grasped and wrung with a force that made Ethel shrink for the poor maimed arm . '
246267	246305	246306	246306	Ethel	300	' was the immediate question . Three technical words were spoken in a matter of fact way , as Dr. May replaced his hand in his bosom , and then , with an eager smile , said , '
246316	246359	246306	246306	Ethel	300	' Ethel had indeed , and gave her hand cordially , surprised by the bow and air of deferential politeness with which it was received , like a favour , while Dr. Spencer asked her whether she had been staying in Oxford . '
246370	246377	246367	246367	you	594	' said Dr. May , joyously . '
246413	246414	246405	246405	you	594	' '
246420	246427	246417	246417	I	0	' said Dr. May , deprecatingly ; '

246469	246470	246460	246460	you	594	' '

246520	246535	246503	246503	I	0	' said Dr. May , looking at his friend 's milk - white locks . '
246574	246582	246565	246565	You	594	' added he , turning to Ethel , '
246591	246592	246584	246584	you	594	' '
246596	246605	246584	246584	you	594	' said Ethel , with a bright look . '
246615	246620	246607	246607	you	594	' continued Dr. May ; '
246640	246641	246635	246635	you	594	' '
246691	246692	246673	246673	He	646	' '
246700	246710	246673	246673	He	646	' as the train shewed signs of a halt . '
246733	246734	246736	246736	he	646	' '
246740	246741	246736	246736	he	646	' '
246753	246754	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' '
246760	246772	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' said Dr. May , laying his hand on his arm . '
246794	246795	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' '
246805	246815	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' said he , looking tempted , but irresolute . '
246824	246830	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' said Ethel , eagerly . '
246837	247529	246749	246751	a regular vagabond	5190	' He looked his courteous thanks , and soon was with them en route for Stoneborough . Ethel 's thoughts were diverted from all she had left at Oxford . She could not but watch those two old friends . She knew enough of the traveller to enter into her father 's happiness , and to have no fears of another Sir Matthew . They had been together at Stoneborough , at Cambridge , at Paris , at Edinburgh , always linked in the closest friendship ; but , by Dr. May 's own account , his friend had been the diligent one of the pair , a bright compound of principle and spirit , and highly distinguished in all his studies , and Dr. May 's model of perfection . Their paths had since lain far apart , and they had not seen each other , since , twenty - six years ago , they had parted in London — the one to settle at his native town , while the other accepted a situation as travelling physician . On his return , he had almost sacrificed his life , by self - devoted attendance on a fever - stricken emigrant - ship . He had afterwards received an appointment in India , and there the correspondence had died away , and Dr. May had lost traces of him , only knowing that , in a visitation of cholera , he had again acted with the same carelessness of his own life , and a severe illness , which had broken up his health , had occasioned him to relinquish his post . It now appeared that he had thought himself coming home ever since . He had gone to recruit , in the Himalayas , and had become engrossed in scientific observations on their altitudes , as well as investigations in natural history . Going to Calcutta , he had fallen in with a party about to explore the Asiatic islands , and he had accompanied them , as well as going on an expedition into the interior of Australia . He had been employed in various sanitary arrangements there , and in India , and had finally worked his way slowly home , overland , visiting Egypt and Palestine , and refreshing his memory with every Italian , German , or French Cathedral , or work of art , that had delighted him in early days . He was a slight , small man , much sun - burnt , nearly bald , and his hair snowy , but his eyes were beautiful , very dark , soft , and smiling , and yet their gaze peculiarly keen and steady , as if ready for any emergency , and his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour . His voice was clear and sweet , and his manner most refined and polished ; indeed , his courtesy to Ethel , whenever there was a change of carriage , was so exemplary , that she understood it as the effect on a chivalrous mind , of living where a lady was a rare and precious article . It frightened Ethel a little at first , but , before the end of the journey , she had already begun to feel , towards him , like an old friend — one of those inheritances , who are so much valued and loved , like a sort of uncles - in - friendship . She had an especial grateful honour for the delicate tact which asked no questions , as she saw his eye often falling anxiously on her father 's left hand , where the wedding ring shone upon the little finger . There was talk enough upon his travels , on public changes , and on old friends ; but , after those first few words , home had never been mentioned . When , at five o'clock , the engine blew its whistle , at the old familiar station , Dr. May had scarcely put his head out before Adams hastened up to him with a note . '
247535	247536	247539	247539	sir	7572	' '
247548	247549	247541	247542	Miss Margaret	249	' '
247556	247563	247541	247542	Miss Margaret	249	' said Dr. May , hastily—'the Larkins '
247591	247628	247629	247629	My	0	' He was driven off at speed , and Ethel proposed to walk home . Dr. Spencer gave her his arm , and was silent ; but presently said , in a low , anxious voice , '
247648	247649	247645	247646	Your mother	926	' '
247655	247664	247645	247646	Your mother	926	' said Ethel , looking straight before her . '
247679	247680	247645	247646	Your mother	926	' '
247683	247690	247691	247691	She	926	' repeated Dr. Spencer , earnestly . '
247698	247776	247691	247691	She	926	' said Ethel , speaking shortly , and abruptly . If she was to say it at all , she could not do so otherwise . He was dreadfully shocked — she knew it by the shudder of his arm , and a tight , suppressed groan . He did not speak , and Ethel , as if a relief from the silence must be made , said what was not very consoling , and equally blunt , '
247791	247839	247777	247777	Margaret	249	' He did not seem to hear , but walked on , as in a dream , where Ethel guided him , and she would not interrupt him again . They had just passed Mr. Bramshaw 's office , when a voice was heard behind , calling , '
247846	247870	247843	247844	Miss Ethel	300	' and Edward Anderson , now articled to Mr. Bramshaw , burst out , pen in hand , and looking shabby and inky . '
247874	247880	247871	247872	Miss Ethel	300	' he said , breathlessly , '
247893	247894	247891	247891	Harry	257	' '
247897	247901	247891	247891	Harry	257	' said Ethel . '
247910	247911	247903	247903	they	5200	' '
247918	247922	247903	247903	they	5200	' said Edward . '
247944	247945	247939	247940	Dr. May	238	' '

247977	247998	247973	247973	We	5203	' said Ethel , kindly—'we saw a Captain at Oxford who thought it not at all to be depended on . '
247999	248005	248007	248007	Edward	437	' I am so glad , '
248047	248067	248039	248039	She	300	' We are very anxious for news of my next brother 's ship , Alcestis , in the Pacific — '
248068	248071	248073	248075	poor Dr. Spencer	260	' More ! '
248080	248094	248073	248075	poor Dr. Spencer	260	' Good Heavens ! I thought May , at least , was happy ! '
248095	248101	248103	248103	Ethel	300	' He is not unhappy , '
248119	248126	248128	248128	he	437	' How long ago was this ? '
248143	248161	248128	248128	he	437	' Four years , next October . I assure you , his spirits are almost always good . '
248162	248172	248173	248173	he	437	' When I was at Adelaide , little thinking ! '
248180	248190	248173	248173	he	437	' Forgive me , I have given you pain . '
248191	248194	248195	248195	she	300	' No , '
248198	248207	248195	248195	she	300	' or rather , I gave you more . '
248208	248213	248128	248128	he	437	' I knew her — '
248244	248252	248216	248216	he	437	' This garden is not much altered . '
248282	248283	248371	248376	the children , with one voice	5211	' '
248288	248365	248366	248366	Ethel	300	' said Dr. Spencer , looking at Ethel , and the next two steps brought them in view of the play - place in the laurels , where Aubrey lay on the ground , feigning sleep , but keeping a watchful eye over Blanche , who was dropping something into the holes of inverted flower pots , Gertrude dancing about in a way that seemed to have called for the reproof of the more earnest actors . '
248419	248420	248391	248391	Aubrey	594	' '
248443	248455	248461	248461	he	1578	' Blanche did so demurely , and asked where was papa ? '
248471	248472	248461	248461	he	1578	' '
248479	248483	248473	248474	George Larkins	438	' said Aubrey . '

248528	248533	248524	248526	Aubrey Spencer May	594	' was the answer . '
248544	248559	248539	248539	you	7382	' exclaimed Dr. Spencer , while Aubrey stood abashed at so mysterious an accusation . '
248562	248573	248539	248539	you	7382	' exclaimed Blanche , seizing on Ethel , and whispering , '
248585	248586	248577	248583	the boy that climbed the market cross	5219	' '
248594	248606	248587	248587	You	7382	' said Ethel , smiling , as Dr. Spencer evidently heard . '
248613	248627	248609	248611	a little boy	5220	' said Aubrey , indignantly , looking at the grey - haired man . '
248630	248637	248609	248611	a little boy	5220	' said Ethel to Dr. Spencer . '
248642	248649	248609	248611	a little boy	5220	' he said , laughing heartily . '

248691	248765	248679	248681	the forty thieves	5210	' said the innocent , daisy - faced Gertrude ; and Ethel hastened towards the house , glad of the permission granted by his true good - breeding . There was a shriek of welcome from Mary , who sat working beside Margaret . Ethel was certain that no evil tidings had come to her eldest sister , so joyous was her exclamation of wonder and rebuke to her home - sick Ethel . '

248790	248796	248774	248774	I	0	' said Ethel , hastily ; '
248807	248871	248872	248872	Ethel	300	' Margaret flushed with such a pink , that Ethel resolved never to set her guessing again , and hurried to explain ; and having heard that all was well , and taken her housekeeping measures , she proceeded to fetch the guest ; but Mary , who had been unusually silent all this time , ran after her , and checked her .

248978	249441	248971	248971	Ethel	300	' Poor Mary 's full lip swelled , and her eyes swam , ready to laugh of weep , in full faith in her sister 's answer . Ethel told of Meta 's captain , and the smile predominated , and settled down into Mary 's usual broad beamy look , like a benignant rising sun on the sign of an inn , as Ethel praised her warmly for a fortitude and consideration of which she had not thought her capable . Dr. Spencer was discovered full in the midst of the comedy of the forty thieves , alternating , as required , between the robber - captain and the ass , and the children in perfect ecstacies with him . They all followed in his train to the drawing - room , and were so clamorous , that he could have no conversation with Margaret . He certainly made them so , but Ethel , remembering what a blow her disclosures had been , thought it would be only a kindness to send Aubrey to show him to his room , where he might have some peace . She was not sorry to be very busy , so as to have little time to reply to the questions on the doings at Oxford , and the cause of her sudden return ; and yet it would have been a comfort to be able to sit down to understand herself , and recall her confused thoughts . But solitary reflection was a thing only to be hoped for in that house in bed , and Ethel was obliged to run up and down , and attend to everybody , under an undefined sense that she had come home to a dull , anxious world of turmoil . Margaret seemed to guess nothing , that was one comfort ; she evidently thought that her return was fully accounted for by the fascination of her papa 's presence in a strange place . She gave Ethel no credit for the sacrifice , naturally supposing that she could not enjoy herself away from home . Ethel did not know whether to be glad or not ; she was relieved , but it was flat . As to Norman Ogilvie , one or two inquiries whether she liked him , and if Norman were going to Scotland with him , were all that passed , and it was very provoking to be made so hot and conscious by them . She could not begin to dress till late , and while she was unpacking , she heard her father come home , among the children 's loud welcomes , and go to the drawing - room . He presently knocked at the door between their rooms . '

So they went down - stairs , and found Mary making tea ; and Margaret , fearing Dr. Spencer was overwhelmed with his young admirers — for Aubrey and Gertrude were one on each knee , and Blanche standing beside him , inflicting on him a catalogue of the names and ages of all the eleven .

250690	250812	250688	250688	Ulysses	649	' which , being overheard and repeated , led to the information that he was Ethel 's pupil , whereupon Dr. Spencer began to inquire after the school , and to exclaim at his friend for having deserted it in the person of Tom . Dr. May looked convicted , but said it was all Norman 's fault ; and Dr. Spencer , shaking his head at Blanche , opined that the young gentleman was a great innovater , and that he was sure he was at the bottom of the pulling down the Market Cross , and the stopping up Randall 's Alley — iniquities of the " nasty people , " of which she already had made him aware .

250824	250829	250816	250816	he	227	' said Dr. May ; '

250896	250947	250894	250894	Dick	575	' and he turned with a start of astonishment , and went into a fit of laughing , re - echoed by all the young ones , who were especially tickled by hearing , from another , the abreviation that had , hitherto , only lived in the favourite expletive , '
250956	250957	250954	250955	Dick May.	650	' '
250961	250966	250954	250955	Dick May.	650	' said Dr. May. " '
250993	251327	250975	250975	thou	5271	' " His friend laughed the more , and they betook themselves to the College stories , of which the quotation from Dogberry seemed to have reminded them . There was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other . Often it was the easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had once been together , with somewhat of elder brotherhood on Dr. Spencer 's side — and of looking up on Dr. May's — and just as they had recurred to these terms , some allusion would bring back to Dr. Spencer , that the heedless , highs - pirited " Dick , " whom he had always had much ado to keep out of scrapes , was a householder , a man of weight and influence ; a light which would at first strike him as most ludicrous , and then mirth would end in a sigh , for there was yet another aspect ! After having thought of him so long as the happy husband of Margaret Mackenzie , he found her place vacant , and the trace of deep grief apparent on the countenance , once so gay — the oppression of anxiety marked on the brow , formerly so joyous , the merriment almost more touching than gravity would have been , for the former nature seemed rather shattered than altered . In merging towards this side , there was a tender respect in Dr. Spencer 's manner that was most beautiful , though this evening such subjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance , by the constant interchange of new and old jokes and stories . Only when bed - time had come , and Margaret had been carried off — did a silence fall on the two friends , unbroken till Dr. May rose and proposed going up - stairs . When he gave his hand to wish good night , Dr. Spencer held it this time most carefully , and said , '
251337	251338	251339	251339	I	0	' '
251345	251350	251339	251339	I	0	' said his host , '

251383	251394	251395	251395	Sorrow	654	' said Dr. May , his voice low with emotion . '
251423	251447	251420	251420	She	5273	' he concluded . His friend had turned aside and hidden his face with his hand , then looked up for a moment , '
251453	251458	251451	251451	Dick	575	' he said briefly . '
251463	251471	251459	251459	Sorrow	654	' was Dr. May 's first answer . '
251479	251493	251496	251496	you	0	' There was a silence again , ending in Dr. May 's saying , '
251503	251572	251496	251496	you	0	' They discussed the nature of the injury : Dr. Spencer could not feel otherwise than that it was a very hopeless matter . Her father owned that he had thought so from the first , and had wondered at Sir Matthew Fleet 's opinion . His subdued tone of patience and resignation , struck his guest above all , as changed from what he had once been . '
251579	251591	251573	251573	You	0	' he said , when they parted at his room door . '
251592	251599	251602	251603	Dr. May.	401	' I have received much good ! '
251604	251622	251573	251573	You	0	' Good night ! I am glad to have you here — if you can bear it . '
251623	251641	251573	251573	You	0	' Bear it ? Dick ! how like that girl is to you ! She is yourself ! '
251642	251655	251656	251656	Ethel	300	' Such a self as I never was ! Good - night . '
252180	252725	252726	252726	Cocksmoor	257	' place , and driving out Dr. May , or sometimes joining the children in a walk , to their supreme delight . His sketches , for he drew most beautifully , were an endless pleasure to Margaret , with his explanations of them — she even tried to sit up to copy them , and he began to teach Blanche to draw . The evenings , when there was certain to be some entertaining talk going on between the two Doctors , were very charming , and Margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her father so happy with his friend . Ethel knew she ought to be happy also , and if attention could make her so , she had it , for kind and courteous as Dr. Spencer was to all , she seemed to have a double charm for him . It was as if he found united in her the quaint brusquerie , that he had loved in her father , with somewhat of her mother ; for though Ethel had less personal resemblance to Mrs. May than any other of the family , Dr. Spencer transferred to her much of the chivalrous distant devotion , with which he had regarded her mother . Ethel was very little conscious of it , but he was certainly her sworn knight , and there was an eagerness in his manner of performing every little service for her , a deference in his way of listening to her , over and above his ordinary polish of manner . Ethel lighted up , and enjoyed herself when talking was going on — her periods of ennui were when she had to set about any home employment — when Aubrey 's lessons did not go well — when she wanted to speak to her father , and could not catch him ; and even when she had to go to Cocksmoor . She did not seem to make any progress there — the room was very full , and very close , the children were dull , and she began to believe she was doing no good — it was all a weariness . But she was so heartily ashamed of her feelings , that she worked the more vehemently for them , and the utmost shew that they outwardly made was , that Margaret thought her less vivacious than her wo nt , and she was a little too peremptory at times with Mary and Blanche . She had so much disliked the display that Flora had made about Cocksmoor , that she had imposed total silence on it upon her younger sisters , and Dr. Spencer had spent a fortnight at Stoneborough without being aware of their occupation ; when there occurred such an extremely sultry day , that Margaret remonstrated with Ethel on her intention of broiling herself and Mary by walking to Cocksmoor , when the quicksilver stood at 80 ° in the shade . Ethel was much inclined to stay at home , but she did not know whether this was from heat or from idleness , and her fretted spirits took the turn of determination — so she posted off at a gallopping pace , that her brothers called her '
252729	252747	252726	252726	Cocksmoor	257	' and Mary panted by her side , humbly petitioning for the plantation path , when she answered '
252764	253181	252726	252726	Cocksmoor	257	' The school - room was unusually full , all the haymaking mothers made it serve as an infant school , and though as much window was opened as there could be , the effect was not coolness . Nevertheless , Ethel sat down and gathered her class round her , and she had just heard the chapter once read , when there was a little confusion , a frightened cry of " Ethel ! " and before she could rise to her feet — a flump upon the floor — poor Mary had absolutely fainted dead away . Ethel was much terrified , and very angry with herself ; Mary was no light weight , but Mrs. Elwood coming at their cry , helped Ethel to drag her into the outer room , where she soon began to recover , and to be excessively puzzled as to what had happened to her . She said the sea was roaring , and where was Harry ? and then she looked much surprised to find herself lying on Mrs. Elwood 's damp flags — a circumstance extremely distressing to Mrs. Elwood , who wanted to carry her up - stairs into Cherry 's room , very clean and very white , but with such a sun shining full into it ! Ethel lavished all care , and reproached herself greatly , though to be sure nothing had ever been supposed capable of hurting Mary , and Mary herself protested that nothing at all had ailed her till the children 's voices began to sound funny , and turned into the waves of the sea , and therewith poor Mary burst into a great flood of tears , and asked whether Harry would ever come back . The tears did her a great deal of good , though not so much as the being petted by Ethel , and she soon declared herself perfectly well ; but Ethel could not think of letting her walk home , and sent off a boy — who she trusted would not faint — with a note to Margaret , desiring her to send the gig , which fortunately was at home to - day . Mary had partaken of some of Mrs. Elwood 's tea , which , though extremely bitter , seemed a great cordial , and was sitting , quite revived , in the arbour at the door , when the gig stopped , and Dr. Spencer walked in .

253299	253335	253258	253258	Ethel	300	' was all he said . Ethel was soon satisfied that he did not think Mary ill . In fact , he said fainting was the most natural and justifiable measure , under the circumstances . '

254677	254684	254686	254687	Dr. Spencer	260	' I see , I see ! '
254696	254713	254686	254687	Dr. Spencer	260	' but must Cocksmoor be left to its fate , and your gallant daughter to hers ? '
254714	254808	254615	254616	Dr. May	238	' The Vicar wo n't stir . He is indolent enough by nature , and worse with gout ; and I do not see what good I could do . I once offended the tenant , Nicolson , by fining him , for cheating his unhappy labourers , on the abominable truck system ; and he had rather poison me , than do anything to oblige me . And , as to the copyholder , he is a fine gentleman , who never comes near the place , nor does anything for it . '
254809	254814	254686	254687	Dr. Spencer	260	' Who is he ? '
254815	254820	254686	254687	Dr. Spencer	260	' Sir Henry Walkinghame . '
254821	254920	254615	254616	Dr. May	238	' Sir Henry Walkinghame ! I know the man . I found him in one of the caves at Thebes , among the mummies , laid up with a fever , nearly ready to be a mummy himself ! I remember bleeding him — irregular , was not it ? but one does not stand on ceremony in Pharaoh 's tomb . I got him through with it ; we came up the Nile together , and the last I saw of him was at Alexandria . He is your man ! something might be done with him ! '
254962	255061	255064	255064	you	5352	' Two days after , Ethel came down equipped for Cocksmoor . It was as hot as ever , and Mary was ordered to stay at home , being somewhat pacified by a promise that she should go again as soon as the weather was fit for anything but a salamander . Dr. Spencer was in the hall , with his bamboo , his great Panama hat , and grey loose coat , for he entirely avoided , except on Sundays , the medical suit of black . He offered to relieve Ethel of her bag of books . '
255066	255076	255064	255064	you	5352	' ( He had them by this time ) . '

255215	255324	255209	255209	he	227	' Dr. Spencer promised to do nothing but what was quite reasonable . Ethel believed that he accompanied her merely because his gallantry would not suffer her to go unescorted , and she was not sorry , for it was too long a walk for solitude to be very agreeable , when strange waggoners might be on the road , though she had never let them be " lions in the path . " The walk was as pleasant as a scorching sun would allow , and by the time they arrived at the scattered cottages , Ethel had been drawn into explaining many of her Cocksmoor perplexities . '
255341	255345	255346	255346	You	0	' he asked . '
255386	255387	255388	255388	I	0	' '
255398	255402	255388	255388	I	0	' said Ethel . '

255438	255447	255434	255434	I	0	' replied Dr. Spencer , stepping it out . '
255466	255510	255513	255513	you	0	' A surmise crossed Ethel . Could he be going to take the work on himself , but that was too wild a supposition — she knew he had nothing of his own , only a moderate pension from the East India Company . '
255518	255604	255513	255513	you	0	' he said , coming to the slope of a knoll , commanding a pretty view of the Abbotstoke woods , clear from houses , and yet not remote from the hamlet . She agreed that it would do well , and he kicked up a bit of turf , and pryed into the soil , pronouncing it dry , and fit for a good foundation . Then he began to step it out , making a circuit that amazed her , but he said , '
255648	255839	255842	255842	I	0	' He would not let her remain in the sun , and she went into school . She found him , when she came out , sitting in the arbour , smoking a cigar — rather a shock to her feelings , though he threw it away the instant she appeared , and she excused him for his foreign habits . In the evening , he brought down a traveller 's case of instruments , and proceeded to draw a beautiful little map of Cocksmoor , where it seemed that he had taken all his measurements , whilst she was in school . He ended by an imaginary plan and elevation for the school , with a pretty oriel window and bell - gable , that made Ethel sigh with delight at the bare idea . Next day , he vanished after dinner , but this he often did ; he used to say he must go and have a holiday of smoking — he could not bear too much civilized society . He came back for tea , however , and had not sat down long before he said , '
255864	255865	255941	255941	you	5365	' '
255869	255890	255941	255941	you	5365	' was the general and dolorous outcry , and Gertrude laid hold of him and said he should not go . '
255896	255900	255902	255902	you	5365	' he said , '
255933	255934	255902	255902	you	5365	' '
255955	255959	255960	255960	I	0	' asked Dr. May. '
256011	256031	255962	255964	Sir Henry Walkinghame	219	' Ethel was too much confounded to speak . Her father was exclaiming on the shortness of the time . '
256036	256226	255962	255964	Sir Henry Walkinghame	219	' said Dr. Spencer , demonstrating that he should be able to travel comfortably , and have four days to spare at Vienna — a journey , which he seemed to think less of , than did Dr. May of going to London . As to checking him , of that there was no possibility , nor , indeed , notion , though Ethel did not quite know how to believe in it , nor that the plan could come to good . Ethel was much better by this time : by her vigorous efforts , she had recovered her tone of mind and interest in what was passing ; and though , now and then Norman 's letters , carrying sentences of remembrance , made her glow a little , she was so steady to her resolution that she averted all traffic in messages through her brother 's correspondence , and , in that fear , allowed it to lapse into Margaret 's hands more than she had ever done . Indeed , no one greatly liked writing from home , it was heartless work to say always , '
256233	256392	256230	256231	the Alcestis	469	' and yet they all declared they were not anxious . Hector Ernescliffe knelt a great while beside Margaret 's sofa , on the first evening of his holidays , and there was a long low - voiced talk between them . Ethel wished that she had warned him off , for Margaret looked much more harassed and anxious , after having heard the outpouring of all that was on his mind . Dr. Spencer thought her looking worse , when he came , as come he did , on the appointed day . He had brought Sir Henry Walkinghame 's full consent to the surrender of the land ; drawn up in such form as could be acted upon , and a letter to his man of business . But Nicolson ! He was a worse dragon nearer home , hating all schools , especially hating Dr. May. However , said Dr. Spencer , in eastern form , '
256419	256498	256414	256417	the father of quarrymen	5371	' What he did with the father of quarrymen was not known , whether he talked him over , or bought him off — Margaret hoped the former ; Dr. May feared the latter ; the results were certain ; Mr. Nicolson had agreed that the land should be given up . The triumphant Dr. Spencer sat down to write a statement to be shewn to the College authorities , when they should come to hold their court . '
256510	256514	256515	256516	The incumbent	7677	' he said , '

256808	256812	256801	256804	the last old woman	5386	' continued Dr. May. '

256933	256939	256922	256922	Daisy	238	' said Margaret , smiling . '
256952	257150	256922	256922	Daisy	238	' said Dr. May. There was a putting on of hats and bonnets , and the whole party walked down the garden to inspect the house — a matter of curiosity to some — for it was where the old lady had resided on whom Harry had played so many tricks , and the subject of many myths hatched between him and George Larkins . It was an odd , little narrow slip of a house , four stories , of two rooms all the way up , each with a large window , with a marked white eye - brow . Dr. May eagerly pointed out all the conveniences , parlour , museum , smoking den , while Dr. Spencer listened , and answered doubtfully ; and the children 's clamorous anxiety seemed to render him the more silent . Hector Ernescliffe discovered a jack - daw 's nest in the chimney , whereupon the whole train rushed off to investigate , leaving the two Doctors and Ethel standing together in the empty parlour , Dr. May pressing , Dr. Spencer raising desultory objections ; but so evidently against his own wishes , that Ethel said , '
257162	257163	257155	257155	you	5394	' '
257166	257171	257155	257155	you	5394	' said Dr. May , '

257201	257208	257209	257209	You	5395	' and he spoke with emotion . '

257228	257232	257209	257209	You	5395	' said Dr. May. '
257239	257251	257233	257233	Spencer	260	' and he spoke with a pleading , almost dependant air , '
257257	257258	257233	257233	Spencer	260	' '
257290	257291	257292	257292	We	5395	' '
257298	257302	257292	257292	We	5395	' said Dr. May. '
257310	257314	257304	257304	you	5394	' added Ethel . '
257317	257341	257349	257349	Ethel	300	' said Dr. May. Trouble may be at hand . Help us through with it . Remember , these children have no uncles . '
257342	257347	257349	257349	Ethel	300	' You will stay ? '
257495	257498	257500	257501	Dr. Spencer	260	' Ah ! '
257517	257524	257504	257504	Tom	238	' what do you know about jackdaws '
257534	257535	257530	257532	no Whichcote scholars	5405	' '
257540	257544	257530	257532	no Whichcote scholars	5405	' cried Hector , '
257560	257561	257562	257563	Old Grey	662	' '
257567	257584	257562	257563	Old Grey	662	' said Tom , who usually acted the part of esprit fort to Hector 's credulity . '
257598	257602	257594	257594	Jesse	663	' said Hector . '
257625	257629	257630	257630	You	5404	' said Tom . '
257641	257743	257633	257634	Dr. Spencer	260	' Dr. Spencer did not gainsay it , and proceeded even to shew the old Whichcote spirit , by leading the assault , and promising to take care of Aubrey , while Ethel retained Gertrude , and her father too ; for Dr. May had such a great inclination to scramble up the ladder after them , that she , thinking it a dangerous experiment for so helpless an arm , was obliged to assure him that it would create a sensation among the gossiphood of Stoneborough , if their physician were seen disporting himself on the top of the house . '
257747	257756	257758	257759	Dr. May	238	'm not a physician unattached , like him , '
257763	257785	257758	257759	Dr. May	238	' Hollo ! have you got up , Tom ? There 's a door up there . I 'll show you — '
257786	257808	257810	257810	Ethel	300	' No , do n't papa . Think of Mrs. Ledwich ; and asking her to see two trustees up there ! '
257812	257828	257810	257810	Ethel	300	' Ah ! Mrs. Ledwich ; what is to be done with her , Ethel ? '
257829	257850	257758	257759	Dr. May	238	' I am sure I ca n't tell . If Flora were but at home , she would manage it . '
257851	257857	257758	257759	Dr. May	238	' Spencer can manage anything ! '
257862	257887	257758	257759	Dr. May	238	' That was the happiest chance imaginable that you came home with me , and so we came to go by the same train . '
258023	258037	258039	258039	Tom	238	' There 's nothing for it but for Aubrey to go to school , '
258047	258053	258055	258056	Dr. Spencer	260	' Aye , to Stoneborough , '
258124	258131	258133	258133	Ethel	300	' Will the other eight ladies ? '
258135	258141	258133	258133	Ethel	300	' that 's the point . '
258142	258164	258166	258167	Dr. May.	401	' Ha , Spencer ! you did not know what you were undertaking . Do you wish to be let off ? '
258168	258172	258174	258176	the undaunted Doctor	5418	' Not I , '
258178	258191	258174	258176	the undaunted Doctor	5418	' Come , Ethel , let us hear what should be done . '
258192	258198	258200	258200	Ethel	300	' There 's no time , '
258204	258219	258200	258200	Ethel	300	' The Court will be only on the day after to - morrow . " '
258223	258241	258174	258176	the undaunted Doctor	5418	' said Dr. Spencer , who seemed ready to throw himself into it with all his might . '
258257	258258	258259	258260	Nine Muses	614	' '
258271	258302	258307	258307	Ethel	300	' said Dr. May , who , having put his friend into the situation , had a mischievous delight in laughing at him , and watching what he would do . '
258313	258314	258310	258311	Mrs. Rivers	606	' '
258320	258324	258310	258311	Mrs. Rivers	606	' said Ethel , '

258337	258342	258329	258329	somebody	3162	' said Dr. Spencer . '
258378	258379	258380	258380	You	5421	' '
258407	258408	258397	258398	Miss Rich	575	' '

258432	258436	258425	258426	Mrs. Ledwich	310	' said Dr. May. '
258459	258644	258425	258426	Mrs. Ledwich	310	' So the remaining ladies were divided — Ethel was to visit Miss Anderson , Miss Boulder , and Mrs. Ledwich ; Dr. Spencer , the rest , and a meeting , if possible , be appointed for the next day . Ethel did as she was told , though rather against the grain , and her short , abrupt manner , was excused the more readily , that Dr. Spencer had been a subject of much mysterious speculation in Stoneborough , and to gain any intelligence respecting him , was a great object ; so that she was extremely welcome , wherever she called . Mrs. Ledwich promised to come to tea , and instantly prepared to walk to Miss Rich , and authorize her to send out the notes of summons to the morrow 's meeting . Ethel offered to walk with her , and found Mrs. and Miss Rich in a flutter , after Dr. Spencer 's call ; the daughter just going to put on her bonnet and consult Mrs. Ledwich , and both extremely enchanted with Dr. Spencer , who '
258651	258672	258425	258426	Mrs. Ledwich	310	' The hour was fixed and the notes sent out , and Ethel met Dr. Spencer at the garden gate . '
258675	258681	258425	258426	Mrs. Ledwich	310	' he said , smiling , '
258694	258695	258692	258692	we	5426	' '

258729	258734	258716	258716	you	5427	' said Dr. Spencer . '

258913	258918	258919	258921	Gentle little women	5435	' said Dr. Spencer . '
258923	258924	258919	258921	Gentle little women	5435	' '
258946	259069	258939	258939	you	5427	' Mrs. Ledwich came to tea , sparkling with black bugles , and was very patronizing and amiable . Her visits were generally subjects of great dread , for she talked unceasingly , laid down the law , and overwhelmed Margaret with remedies ; but to - night Dr. Spencer took her in hand . It was not that he went out of his ordinary self , he was always the same simple mannered , polished gentleman ; but it was this that told — she was evidently somewhat in awe of him — the refinement kept her in check . She behaved very quietly all the evening , admired the plans , consented to everything , and was scarcely Mrs. Ledwich ! '
259078	259085	259076	259076	Ethel	300	' said Dr. May , afterwards . '
259095	259101	258939	258939	you	5427	' Committee well in hand . '
259102	259111	259093	259096	the Ladies ' Committee	9711	' Why do you think so , papa ? '
259112	259117	259121	259121	she	300	' Never you fear — '
259135	259298	258939	258939	you	5427	' Committee accepted of their representatives with full consent ; and the indefatigable Dr. Spencer next had to hunt up the fellow trustee . He finally contrived to collect everyone he wanted at Fordholm , the case was laid before the College — the College was propitious , and , by four o'clock in the evening , Dr. Spencer laid before Ethel the promise of the piece of land . Mary 's joy was unbounded , and Ethel blushed , and tried to thank . This would have been the summit of felicity a year ago , and she was vexed with herself for feeling that though land and money were both in such safe hands , she could not care sufficiently to feel the ecstacy the attainment of her object would once have given to her . Then she would have been frantic with excitement , and heedless of everything ; now she took it so composedly as to annoy herself . '
259316	259527	259133	259136	The Ladies ' Committee	9711	' Perhaps it was the less at home , because she had just heard that George and Flora had accepted an invitation to Glenbracken , but though the zest of Cocksmoor might be somewhat gone , she called herself to order , and gave her full attention to all that was planned by her champion . Never did man plunge into business more thoroughly than he , when he had once undertaken it . He was one of those men who , from gathering particulars of every practical matter that comes under their notice , are able to accomplish well whatever they set their hand to ; and building was not new to him , though his former subjects — a Church and Mission station in India — bore little remembrance to the present . He bought a little round dumpling of a white pony , and trotted all over the country in search of building materials and builders , he discovered trees in distant timber - yards , he brought home specimens of stone , one in each pocket , to compare and analyze , he went to London to look at model schools , he drew plans each more neat and beautiful than the last , he compared builders '

Moreover he had a chemical apparatus , a telescope , and microscope , of great power , wherewith he tried experiments that were the height of felicity to Tom and Ethel , and much interested their father . He made it his business to have full occupation for himself , with plans , books , or correspondence , so as not to be a charge on the hands of the May family , with whom he never spent an evening without special and earnest invitation . He gave attendance at the hospital on alternate days , as well as taking off Dr. May 's hands such of his gratuitous patients as were not averse to quit their old Doctor , and could believe in a physician in shepherd 's plaid , and Panama hat . Exceedingly sociable , he soon visited every one far and wide , and went to every sort of party , from the grand dinners of the " county families , " to the tea drinkings of the Stoneborough ladies , a welcome guest at all , and enjoying each in his own way . English life was so new to him that he entered into the little accessories with the zest of a youth ; and there seemed to be a curious change between the two old fellow students , the elder and more staid of former days having come back with unencumbered freshness to enliven his friend , just beginning to grow aged under the wear of care and sorrows . It was very droll to hear Dr. May laughing at Dr. Spencer 's histories of his adventures , and at the new aspects in which his own well - trodden district appeared to travelled eyes ; and not less amusing was Dr. Spencer 's resolute defence of all the Nine Muses , generally and individually . He certainly had no reason to think ill of them . As one woman , they were led by him , and conformed their opinions . The only seceder was Louisa Anderson , who had her brother for her oracle ; and , indeed , the more youthful race , to whom Harvey was the glass of fashion , uttered disrespectful opinions as to the Doctor 's age , and would not accede to his being , as Mrs. Ledwich declared , '
260201	260224	260199	260200	Dr. May.	401	' Harvey Anderson had first attempted patronage , then argument , with Dr. Spencer , but found him equally impervious to both . '

260255	260260	260250	260253	Clever sort of lad	5449	' said Dr. Spencer , '
260269	260547	260250	260253	Clever sort of lad	5449	' Ethel wondered to hear thus lightly disposed of , the powers of argument that had been thought fairly able to compete with Norman , and which had taxed him so severely . She did not know how differently abstract questions appear to a mature mind , confirmed in principle by practice ; and to one young , struggling in self - formation , and more used to theories than to realities . Christian Year . Hector and Tom finished their holidays by a morning 's shooting at the Grange , Dr. May promising to meet them , and let them drive him home . Meta was out , when he arrived ; and , repairing to the library , he found Mr. Rivers sitting by a fire , though it was early in September , with the newspaper before him , but not reading . He looked depressed , and seemed much disappointed a having heard that George and Flora had accepted some further invitations in Scotland , and did not intend to return for another month . Dr. May spoke cheerfully of the hospitality and kindness they had met , but failed to enliven him , and , as if trying to assign some cause for his vexation , he lamented over fogs and frosts , and began to dread an October in Scotland for Flora , almost as if it were the Arctic regions . He grew somewhat more animated in praising Flora , and speaking of the great satisfaction he had in seeing his son married to so admirable a person . He only wished it would be the same with his daughter . '
260555	260559	260548	260548	You	5450	' said Dr. May. '
260570	260571	260548	260548	You	5450	' '
260579	260586	260548	260548	You	5450	' said Mr. Rivers , sighing ; '

260663	260670	260648	260648	She	5452	' said Dr. May , smiling ; '

260753	260772	260735	260735	I	0	' harped on Mr. Rivers , dwelling on the subject , as if he wanted to say something , '
260808	260856	260793	260799	Such a young man as your Norman	5458	' Dr. May would not seem to hear , but he could not prevent himself from blushing as crimson as if he had been the very Norman , as he answered , going on with his own speech , as if Mr. Rivers 's had been unmade ; '
260891	260892	260893	260893	Flora	280	' '
260899	260904	260893	260893	Flora	280	' proceeded Mr. Rivers . '
260926	261028	260917	260917	she	3341	' O ho , thought the Doctor , have you made that discovery , my good friend ? The voices of the two boys were heard in the hall , explaining their achievements to Meta , and Dr. May took his departure , Hector driving him , and embarking in a long discourse on his own affairs , as if he had quite forgotten that the Doctor was not his father , and going on emphatically , in spite of the absence of mind now and then betrayed by his auditor , who , at Dr. Spencer 's door , exclaimed , '
261041	261175	261031	261031	Hector	243	' and presently brought out his friend into the garden , and sat down on the grass , talking low , and earnestly , over the disease with which Mr. Rivers had been so long affected ; for though Dr. May could not perceive any positively unfavourable system , he had been rendered vaguely uneasy by the unusual heaviness and depression of manner . So long did they sit conversing , that Blanche was sent out , primed with an impertinent message , that two such old Doctors ought to be ashamed of themselves for sitting so late in the dew . Dr. Spencer was dragged in to drink tea , and the meal had just been merrily concluded , when the door - bell rang , and a message was brought in . '
261196	261197	261184	261185	Miss Rivers	402	' '
261200	261233	261184	261185	Miss Rivers	402	' said Dr. May , looking at Dr. Spencer , as if to say I told you so ; in the first triumph of professional sagacity ; but the next moment exclaiming , '
261238	261534	261234	261236	Poor little Meta	402	' he hurried away . A gloom fell on those who remained , for , besides their sympathy for Meta , and their liking for her kind old father , there was that one unacknowledged heartache , which , though in general bravely combated , lay in wait always ready to prey on them . Hector stole round to sit by Margaret , and Dr. Spencer muttered , " this will never do , " and sent Tom to fetch some papers lying on his table , whence he read them some curious accounts that he had just received from his Missionary friends in India . They were interested , but in a listening mood , that caused a universal start when the bell again sounded . This time , James reported that the servant from the Grange said his master was very ill — he had brought a letter to post for Mr. George Rivers , and here was a note for Miss Ethel . It was the only note Ethel had ever received from her father , and only contained these few words : — Dear E. I believe this attack will be the last . Come to Meta , and bring my things . R. M. Ethel put her hands to her forehead . It was as if she had been again plunged into the stunned dream of misery of four years ago , and her sensation was of equal bewilderment and uselessness , but it was but for a moment — the next she was in a state of over bustle and eagerness . She wanted to fly about and hasten to help Meta , and could hardly obey the word and gesture by which Margaret summoned her to her side . '
261551	261552	261553	261553	I	0	' '
261583	261584	261581	261581	Margaret	249	' '
261594	261604	261585	261585	I	0	' said Dr. Spencer , in a soothing tone . '
261623	262010	261585	261585	I	0	' Mary and Miss Bracy prepared Ethel 's own goods , which she would otherwise have forgotten ; and Margaret , meanwhile , detained her by her side , trying to calm and encourage her with gentle words of council , that might hinder her from giving way to the flurry of emotion that had seized her , and prevent her from thinking herself certain to be useless . Adams was to drive her thither in the gig , and it presently came to the door . Dr. Spencer wrapped her up well in cloaks and shawls , and spoke words of kindly cheer in her ear as she set off . The fresh night air blew pleasantly on her , the stars glimmered in full glory over head , and now and then her eye was caught by the rocket - like track of a shooting - star . Orion was rising slowly far in the east , and bringing to her mind the sailor - boy under the southern sky ; if , indeed , he were not where sun and stars no more are the light . It was strange that the thought came more as soothing than as acute pain ; she could bear to think of him thus in her present frame , as long as she had not to talk of him . Under those solemn stars , the Life Everlasting seemed to overpower the sense of this mortal life , and Ethel 's agitation was calmed away . The old cedar - tree stood up in stately blackness against the sky , and the lights in the house glanced behind it . The servants looked rather surprised to see Ethel , as if she were not expected , and conducted her to the great drawing - room , which looked the more desolate and solitary , from the glare of lamplight , falling on the empty seats which Ethel had lately seen filled with a glad , home party . She was looking round , thinking whether to venture up to Meta 's room , and there summon Bellairs , when Meta came gliding in , and threw her arms round her . Ethel could not speak , but Meta 's voice was more cheerful than she had expected . '
262019	262020	262017	262017	Ethel	300	' '
262026	262030	262031	262031	He	218	' said Ethel . '

262109	262305	262087	262087	you	5466	' Meta wound her arms round Ethel , and led her up to her sitting - room , where a book lay on the table . She said that her father had seemed weary and torpid , and had sat still until almost their late dinner hour , when he seemed to bethink himself of dressing , and had risen . She thought he walked weakly , and rather tottering , and had run to make him lean on her , which he did , as far as his own room door . There he had kissed her , and thanked her , and murmured a word like blessing . She had not , however , been alarmed , until his servant had come to tell her that he had another seizure . Ethel asked whether she had seen Dr. May since he had been with her father . She had ; but Ethel was surprised to find that she had not taken in the extent of his fears . She had become so far accustomed to these attacks , that , though anxious and distressed , she did not apprehend more than a few days '
262389	262400	262402	262402	she	5469	' How is he ? May I go to him ? '
262404	262411	262413	262414	Dr. May	238	' Not now , my dear , '
262466	262477	262478	262478	Ethel	300	' Yes , my dear , the struggle is over . '
262535	262555	262526	262526	he	238	' Thank Heaven , it has been shorter , and less painful , than I had dared to hope . '
262594	262604	262590	262590	she	402	' Oh ! why did not you call me ! '
262605	262631	262632	262632	Meta	402	' I could not . He would not let me . His last conscious word to me was not to let you see him suffer . '
262669	262678	262666	262666	she	300	' I should like to go to bed . '
262679	262686	262688	262689	Dr. May	238	' Right — the best thing , '

262788	262805	262807	262807	Meta	402	' No , no , thank you — the dark and alone . Good - night , '
262851	262860	262861	262861	he	856	' And how is the poor little dear ? '
262864	262868	262870	262870	Ethel	300	' The same , '

263299	263757	263286	263286	he	5483	' Dr. May again threw his arm round her , and looked into her face . He felt that he had rather have her , such as she was , than anybody else ; and , together , they sat down , and talked of what was to be done , and what was best for Meta , and of the solemnity of being in the house of death . Ethel felt and shewed it so much , in her subdued , awe - struck manner , that her father felt checked whenever he was about to return to his ordinary manner , familiarized , as he necessarily was , with the like scenes . It drew him back to the thought of their own trouble , and their conversation recurred to those days , so that each gained a more full understanding of the other , and they at length separated , certainly with the more peaceful and soft feelings for being in the abode of mourning . Bellairs promised to call Ethel , to be with her young lady as early as might be , reporting that she was sound asleep . And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour , so that Ethel was up , and had been with Dr. May , before she was summoned to her , and then she found her half - dressed , and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast , and in going to his patients . There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down , nor deprived of power of taking thought for others . Yet her eyes looked wandering , and unlike themselves , and her words , now and then , faltered , as if she was not sure what she was doing or saying . Ethel told her not to mind — Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients ; but she did not seem to recollect , at first , who Dr , Spencer was , nor to care for being reminded . Breakfast was laid out in in the little sitting - room . Ethel wanted to take the trouble off her hands , but she would not let her . She sat behind her urn , and asked about tea or coffee , quite accurately , in a low , subdued voice , that nearly overcame Dr. May. When the meal was over , and she had rung the bell , and risen up , as if to her daily work , she turned round , with that piteous , perplexed air , and stood for a moment , as if confused . '
263764	263768	263769	263769	I	0	' said Ethel . '
263791	263792	263779	263780	Dr. May	238	' '

263819	263829	263808	263808	I	0	' Meta came closer to him , and murmured , '
263833	263870	263831	263831	you	5486	' The breakfast things had , by this time , been taken away , and Meta , looking to see that the door had shut for the last time , said , in a low voice , '
263875	263955	263831	263831	you	5486	' Dr. May drew her down , to sit on the sofa beside him , and , in his soft , sweet voice , told her all that she wished to learn of her father 's last hours , and was glad to see showers of quiet , wholesome tears drop freely down , but without violence , and she scarcely attempted to speak . There was a pause at the end , and then she said , gently , '
263966	263979	263963	263964	Dear papa	1125	' And she rose up , and went back to her room . '
263987	263995	263980	263980	She	5491	' said Dr. May , much moved . '
264002	264006	263998	263998	she	5491	' said Ethel . '

264113	264543	264093	264093	She	5491	' Dr. May was right ; Meta presently returned to them , in the same gentle subdued sadness , enfolding her , indeed , as a flower weighed down by mist , but not crushing nor taking away her powers . It was as if she were truly upheld ; and thankful to her friends as she was , she did not throw herself on them in utter dependance or self - abandonment . She wrote needful letters , shedding many tears over them , and often obliged to leave off to give the blinding weeping its course , but refusing to impose any unnecessary task upon Dr. May 's lame arm . All that was right , she strove to do ; she saw Mr. Charles Wilmot , and was refreshed by his reading to her , and when Dr. May desired it , she submissively put on her bonnet , and took several turns with Ethel in the shrubbery , though it made her cry heartily to look into the down - stairs rooms . And she lay on the sofa at last , owning herself strangely tired , she did not know why , and glad that Ethel should read to her . By - and - by , she went to dress for the evening , and came back , full of the tidings that one of the children in the village had been badly burnt . It occupied her very much — she made Ethel promise to go and see about her to - morrow , and sent Bellairs at once with every comfort that she could devise . On the whole , those two days were to Ethel a peaceful and comfortable time . She saw more than usual of her father , and had such conversations with him as were seldom practicable at home , and that chimed in with the unavowed care which hung on their minds ; while Meta was a most sweet and loving charge , without being a burthen , and often saying such beautiful things in her affectionate resignation , that Ethel could only admire and lay them up in her mind . Dr. May went backwards and forwards , and brought good accounts of Margaret and fond messages ; he slept at the Grange each night , and Meta used to sit in her corner of the sofa and work , or not , as best suited her , while she listened to his talk with Ethel , and now and then herself joined .

266057	266061	266064	266064	I	0	' said Ethel . '
266119	266130	266492	266492	Flora	280	' You shall not lose your Cocksmoor income , Ethel — '
266131	266153	266492	266492	Flora	280	' I had never thought of that . You had taken no fees here since we have been all one family . '
266154	266179	266492	266492	Flora	280	' Well , he has been good enough to leave me £ 500 , and Cocksmoor can have the interest , if you like . '
266180	266187	266492	266492	Flora	280	' Oh thank you , papa . '
266188	266333	266492	266492	Flora	280	' It is only its due , for I suppose that is for attendance . Personally , to myself , he has left that beautiful Claude which he knew I admired so much . He has been very kind ! But after all , we ought not to be talking of all this — I should not have known it , if I had not been forced to read the will . Well , so we are in Flora 's house , Ethel ! I wonder how poor dear little Meta will feel the being a guest here , instead of the mistress . I wish that boy were three or four years older ! I should like to take her straight home with us — I should like to have her for a daughter . I shall always look on her as one . '
266334	266339	266341	266341	Ethel	300	' As a Daisy ! '
266343	266350	266352	266353	Dr. May	238	' Do n't talk of it ! '
266357	266439	266352	266353	Dr. May	238	' this is no time for such things . After all , I am glad that the funeral is not here — Flora and Meta might be rather overwhelmed with these three incongruous sets of relations . By their letters , those Riverses must be quite as queer a lot as George 's relations . After all , if we have nothing else , Ethel , we have the best of it , in regard to such relations as we have . '
266440	266446	266448	266448	Ethel	300	' There is Lord Cosham , '
266450	266487	266448	266448	Ethel	300	' Yes , he is Meta 's guardian , as well as her brother ; but he could not have her to live with him . She must depend upon Flora . But we shall see — '
266672	266694	266696	266696	Meta	402	' Yes , I should have been so sorry you had been over - tired . I was quite well off , '
266698	266709	266711	266711	Flora	280	' And you must look on us as your home , '
267288	267305	267271	267272	Norman Ogilvie	548	' Did I tell you , Ethel , that he desired to be remembered to you ? '
267306	267313	267324	267324	Flora	280	' Yes , you said so . '
267314	267322	267324	267324	Flora	280	' What has Coralie done with it ? '
267333	267410	267324	267324	Flora	280	' She must have put it away with my brooches . Oh , no , here it is . I had been looking for Cairn - gorm specimens in a shop , saying I wanted a brooch that you would wear , when Norman Ogilvie came riding after the carriage , looking quite hot and eager ? He had been to some other place , and hunted this one up . Is it not a beauty ? '
267443	267451	267453	267453	Flora	280	' The Glenbracken badge , you know , '
267466	267474	267455	267455	Ethel	300	' Was not it meant for you ? '
267475	267490	267492	267492	Flora	280	' It was to oblige me , if you choose so to regard it , '
267496	267524	267492	267492	Flora	280	' He gave me no injunctions ; but , you see , you must wear it now . I shall not wear coloured brooches for a year . '
267590	267599	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' Then it is your present , Flora ? '
267600	267637	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' If you like better to call it so , my dear . I find Norman Ogilvie is going abroad in a few months . I think we ought to ask him here on his way . '
267638	267651	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' Flora ! I wish you would not talk about such things ! '
267652	267661	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' Do you really and truly , Ethel ? '
267662	267673	267675	267675	Ethel	300	' Certainly not , at such a time as this , '
267692	267703	267704	267704	she	280	' Shall I say you like the brooch , Ethel ? '
267709	267715	267717	267717	Ethel	300	' Say what is proper , '
267721	267736	267717	267717	Ethel	300	' You know what I mean , in the fullest sense of the word . '
267737	267741	267743	267743	Flora	280	' Do I ? '
267745	267749	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' I mean , '
267753	267789	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' that you may say , simply and rationally , that I like the thing , but I wo n't have it said as a message , or that I take it as his present . '
267790	267794	267796	267796	Flora	280	' Very well , '
267798	267817	267796	267796	Flora	280	' the whole affair is simple enough , if you would not be so conscious , my dear . '
267818	267831	267751	267751	Ethel	300	' Flora ! I ca n't stand your calling me my dear ! '
267832	267841	267843	267843	Flora	280	' I am very much obliged to you , '
267871	267925	267865	267865	Ethel	300	' Flora , I beg your pardon , I did not mean to be cross , only please do n't begin about that — Indeed , I think you had better leave out about the brooch altogether . No one will wonder at your passing it over in such a return as this . '
267926	267931	267933	267933	Flora	280	' You are right , '
268063	268103	268060	268060	Meta	402	' Do you think it would be wrong for me to cross the park to see that little burnt girl , as Mr. Wilmot is away to - day , and she has no one to go to her . '
268141	268160	268138	268138	Meta	402	' Well ! I think there is quite as much sweetness , as sadness , in this evening . '
268161	268170	268172	268172	Ethel	300	' Because of this calm autumn sunset beauty ? '
268174	268189	268138	268138	Meta	402	' Look at the golden light coming in under the branches of the trees . '
268190	268193	268195	268195	Meta	402	' Yes , '
268197	268211	268195	268195	Meta	402	' one can not help thinking how much more beautiful it must be — '
268294	268299	268301	268301	Meta	402	' It is odd , '
268308	268336	268301	268301	Meta	402	' it is seeing other people that makes one know it is all sad and altered — it seems so bewildering , though they are so kind . '
268337	268344	268346	268346	Ethel	300	' I know what you mean , '
268348	268368	268370	268370	Meta	402	' One ought not to wish it to go on , because there are other people and other duties , '
268372	268413	268414	268414	she	402	' but quietness is so peaceful . Do you know , Ethel , I shall always think of those two first days , before anybody came , with you and Dr. May , as something very — very — precious , '
268425	268432	268434	268434	Ethel	300	' I am sure I shall , '
268436	268464	268466	268466	Meta	402	' I do n't know how it is , but there is something even in this affliction that makes it like — a strange sort of happiness , '
268470	268477	268479	268479	Ethel	300	' I know what it is ! '
268481	268489	268491	268491	Meta	402	' That He is so very good ? '
268495	268498	268500	268500	Ethel	300	' Yes , '
268521	268530	268532	268532	Meta	402	' It does make one feel more confidence , '
268534	268548	268550	268550	Ethel	300	' " It is good for me to have been in trouble , " '
268552	268555	268557	268557	Meta	402	' Yes , '
268559	268724	268557	268557	Meta	402	' I hope it is not wrong or unkind in me to feel it , for I think dear papa would wish it ; but I do not feel as if — miss him always as I shall — the spring of life were gone from me . I do n't think it can , for I know no more pain or trouble can reach him , and there is — don't you think , Ethel , that I may think so ? — especial care for the orphan , like a compensation . And there is hope , and work here . And I am very thankful ! How much worse it would have been , if George had not been married ! Dear Flora ! Will you tell her , Ethel , how really I do wish her to take the command of me . Tell her it will be the greatest kindness in the world to make me useful to her . '
268725	268729	268731	268731	Ethel	300	' I will , '
268733	268778	268731	268731	Ethel	300	' And please tell her that I am afraid I may forget , and take upon me , as if I were still lady of the house . Tell her I do not mean it , and I hope that she will check it . '
268779	268791	268793	268793	Ethel	300	' I think there is no fear of her forgetting that , '
268806	268813	268815	268815	Meta	402	' I hope I shall not , '
268817	268865	268815	268815	Meta	402	' If I do , I shall drive myself away to stay with Aunt Leonora , and I do n't want to do that at all . So please to make Flora understand that she is head , and I am ready to be hand and foot ; '
268996	269004	269005	269005	he	672	' You wo n't go , Meta , '
269008	269020	269005	269005	he	672	' It would be a horrid nuisance to part with you . '
269021	269041	269098	269099	Dr. May	238	' As long as you think so , dear George.—When I am in your way , or Flora 's — '
269042	269061	269116	269116	he	238	' That will never be ! I say , Flora , will she ever be in our way ? '
269062	269073	269075	269075	Flora	280	' No , indeed ! Meta and I understand that , '
269080	269097	269075	269075	Flora	280	' Well , I suppose Bruce ca n't be trusted to value the books and prints — '
269127	269261	269116	269116	he	238	' Certainly , except Lord Cosham , I never saw such an unpresentable crew as their relations . You should have heard the boys afterwards ! There was Master Tom turning up his Eton nose at them , and pronouncing that there never were such a set of snobs , and Norman taking him to task as I never heard him do before — telling him that he would never have urged his going to Eton , if he had thought it would make him despise respectable folks , probably , better than himself , and that this was the last time in the world for such observations — whereat poor Tommy was quite annihilated ; for a word from Norman goes further with him , than a lecture from any one else . '
269262	269278	269116	269116	he	238	' Well , I think Norman was right as to the unfitness of the time . '
269279	269365	269116	269116	he	238	' So he was . But we had a good deal of them , waiting in the inn parlour . People make incongruities when they will have such things done in state . It could not be helped here , to be sure ; but I always feel , at a grand undertaker 's display like this , that , except the service itself , there is little to give peace or soothing . I hate what makes a talk ! Better be little folk . '
269366	269384	269386	269386	Ethel	300	' One would rather think of our own dear cloister , and those who cared so much , '
269388	269398	269400	269401	Dr. May.	401	' Ah ! you were happy to be there ! '
269402	269412	269415	269415	he	5585	' But it all comes to the same . — '
269437	269446	269448	269449	Dr. May	238	' One may sleep sound without the lullaby , '
269451	269457	269448	269449	Dr. May	238	' and the waves . — '
269458	269472	269415	269415	he	5585	' Oh ! do n't papa . You do n't give up hope ! '
269473	269496	269415	269415	he	5585	' I believe we ought , Ethel . Do n't tell her , but I went to the Admiralty to - day . '
269497	269505	269448	269449	Dr. May	238	' And what did you hear there ? '
269506	269535	269415	269415	he	5585	' Great cause for fear — but they do not give up . My poor Margaret ! But those stars tells us they are in the same Hand . '
269540	269549	269551	269551	Margaret	249	' O Norman , are you come already ? '
269570	269585	269551	269551	Margaret	249	' Yes , I came away directly after collections . How are you Margaret ? '
269586	269593	269595	269596	the brother	3291	' Pretty brave , thank you ; '
269699	269704	269705	269705	he	809	' How is Flora ? '
269709	269751	269705	269705	he	809	' Going on beautifully , except that papa thinks she does too much in every way . She declares that she shall bring the baby to show me in another week , but I do n't think it will be allowed . '
269752	269759	269658	269658	she	249	' And the little lady prospers ? '
269760	269830	269705	269705	he	809	' Capitally , though I get rather contradictory reports of her . First , papa declared her something surpassing — exactly like Flora , and so I suppose she is ; but Ethel and Meta will say nothing for her beauty , and Blanche calls her a fright . But papa is her devoted admirer — he does so enjoy having a sort of property again in a baby . '
269831	269836	269838	269838	Norman	548	' And George Rivers ? '
269842	269883	269838	269838	Norman	548	' Poor George ! he is very proud of her in his own way . He has just been here with a note from Flora , and actually talked ! Between her and the election , he is wonderfully brilliant . '
269884	269893	269705	269705	he	809	' The election ? Has Mr. Esdaile resigned ? '
269894	269926	269705	269705	he	809	' Have you not heard ? He intends it , and George himself is going to stand . The only danger is , that Sir Henry Walkinghame should think of it . '
269927	269939	269838	269838	Norman	548	' Rivers in parliament ! Well , sound men are wanted . '
269940	269957	269705	269705	he	809	' Fancy Flora , our member 's wife . How well she will become her position . '
269958	269967	269705	269705	he	809	' How soon is it likely to be ? '
269968	270106	269838	269838	Norman	548	' Quickly , I fancy . Dr. Spencer , who knows all kinds of news ( Papa says he makes a scientific study of gossip , as a new branch of comparative anatomy ) , found out from the Clevelands , that Mr. Esdaile meant to retire , and happened to mention it the last time that Flora came to see me . It was like firing a train . You would have wondered to see how it excited her , who usually shows her feelings so little . She has been so much occupied with it , and so anxious that George should be ready to take the field at once , that papa was afraid of its hurting her , and Ethel comes home declaring that the election is more to her than her baby . '
270107	270128	269705	269705	he	809	' Ethel is apt to be a little hard on Flora . They are too unlike to understand each other . '
270129	270149	269705	269705	he	809	' Ethel is to be godmother though , and Flora means to ask Mr. Ogilvie to come and stand . '
270150	270175	269705	269705	he	809	' I think he will be gone abroad , or I should have asked him to fulfil his old promise of coming to us . '
270176	270212	269705	269705	he	809	' I believe he must be lodged here , if he should come . Flora will have her house full , for Lady Leonora is coming . The baby is to be called after her . '
270213	270216	270218	270218	Norman	548	' Indeed ! '
270220	270273	270218	270218	Norman	548	' Yes , I thought it unnecessary , as she is not George 's aunt , but Flora is grateful to her for much kindness , and she is coming to see Meta . I am afraid papa is a little hurt , that any name but one should have been chosen . '
270274	270280	269705	269705	he	809	' Has Meta been comfortable ? '
270281	270364	269705	269705	he	809	' Dear little thing ! Everyone says how beautifully she has behaved . She brought all her housekeeping books to Flora at once , and only begged to be made helpful in whatever way might be most convenient . She explained , what we never knew before , how she had the young maids in to read with her , and asked leave to go on . Very few could have been set aside so simply and sweetly in their own house . '
270365	270375	270218	270218	Norman	548	' Flora was sensible of it , I hope . '
270376	270456	269705	269705	he	809	' O yes . She took the management of course , but Meta is charmed with her having the girls in from the village , in turn , to help in the scullery . They have begun family prayers too , and George makes the stable men go to Church — a matter which had been past Meta , as you may guess , though she had been a wonderful little manager , and Flora owned herself quite astonished . '
270457	270466	269705	269705	he	809	' I wonder only at her being astonished . '
270467	270555	269705	269705	he	809	' Meta owned to Ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the heart sinking , at finding herself able to choose her occupations , with no one to accommodate them to . But she would not give way — she set up more work for herself at the school , and has been talking of giving singing lessons at Cocksmoor ; and she forced herself to read , though it was an effort . She has been very happy lately in nursing Flora . '
270556	270561	269705	269705	he	809	' Is Ethel there ? '
270562	270589	269705	269705	he	809	' No ; she is , as usual , at Cocksmoor . There are great councils about sending Cherry to be trained for her new school . '
270590	270609	269705	269705	he	809	' Would Flora be able to see me , if I were to ride over to the Grange ? '
270610	270629	269705	269705	he	809	' You may try ; and , if papa is not there , I dare say she will . '
270672	270673	270669	270669	I	0	' '
270802	270815	270784	270784	She	280	' Norman , how kind to come to me the first thing ! '
270816	270828	270784	270784	She	280	' Margaret encouraged me to try whether you would be visible . '
270829	270840	270842	270842	Flora	280	' They want to make a regular prisoner of me , '
270846	270879	270842	270842	Flora	280	' Papa is as bad as the old nurse ! But he has not been here to - day , so I have had my own way . Did you meet George ? '
270880	270892	270784	270784	She	280	' No ; but Margaret said he had been with her . '
270893	270948	270784	270784	She	280	' I wish he would come . We expect the second post to bring the news that Mr. Esdaile has accepted the Chiltern Hundreds . If he found it so , he meant to go and talk to Mr. Bramshaw ; for , though he is so dull , we must make him agent . '
270949	270957	270784	270784	She	280	' Is there any danger of opposition ? '
270958	271004	270784	270784	She	280	' None at all , if we are soon enough in the field . Papa 's name will secure us , and there is no one else on the right side to come forward , so that it is an absolute rescue of the seat . '
271005	271019	271021	271021	Norman	548	' It is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted , '
271023	271051	271021	271021	Norman	548	' The questions of the day are no light matters ; and it is an immense point to save Stoneborough from being represented by one of the Tomkins '
271054	271055	271021	271021	Norman	548	' '
271059	271063	271064	271064	I	0	' said Flora . '
271105	271237	271093	271093	One	7561	' Flora seemed to thrive upon her sacrifice — she had never appeared more brilliant and joyous . Her brother saw , in her , a Roman matron ; and the ambition that was inherent in his nature , began to find compensation for being crushed , as far as regarded himself , by soaring for another . He eagerly answered that he fully agreed with her , and that she would never repent urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all who had the power . Highly gratified , she asked him to look at a copy of George 's intended address , which was lying on the table . He approved of the tenor , but saw a few phrases susceptible of a better point . '
271241	271313	271093	271093	One	7561	' she said , putting a pen into his hand ; and he began to interline and erase her fair manuscript , talking earnestly , and working up himself and the address at the same time , till it had grown into a composition far superior to the merely sensible affair it had been . Eloquence and thought were now in the language , and substance — and Flora was delighted . '

271350	271369	271338	271338	I	0	' said Flora , but I should like you to see her . She is so like Blanche . '

271657	271685	271687	271687	she	280	' I want you to hear George 's address . Norman has been looking at it , and I hope you will not think it too strong , '
271700	271705	271707	271708	Dr. May	238	' Let me see , '
271717	271733	271734	271734	She	280	' This is a rough copy , too much scratched for you to make out . '
271772	271779	271780	271780	she	280	' I will copy it fairly , '
271783	271825	271780	271780	she	280	' if you will shew it to Dr. Spencer , and ask whether he thinks it too strong . Mr. Dodsley too ; he would be more gratified if he saw it first , in private , and thought himself consulted . '
271854	271860	271861	271861	he	238	' Flora , my dear , '
271864	271883	271861	271861	he	238	' this must not be . Have I not told you that you must be content to rest ? '
271884	271902	271780	271780	she	280	' I did not get up till ten o'clock , and have been lying here ever since . '
271903	271960	271961	271961	Flora	280	' But what has this head of yours been doing ? Has it been resting for ten minutes together ? Now , I know what I am saying , Flora — I warn you , that if you will not give yourself needful quiet now , you will suffer for it by - and - by . '
271967	271999	271961	271961	Flora	280	' I thought I had been very good . But , what is to be done when one 's wits will work , and there is work for them to do ? '
272000	272010	272012	272013	Dr. May	238	' Is not there work enough for them here ? '
272020	272032	272012	272013	Dr. May	238	' Your mother used to value such a retirement from care . '
272043	272065	272033	272033	Flora	280	' Mr. Esdaile should have put off his resignation to suit me . It is an unfortunate time for the election . '
272075	272099	272067	272067	you	280	' She shook her head , and smiled a negative , as if she would , but that she was under a necessity . '
272122	272140	272067	272067	you	280	' She looked very much hurt , and turned away her head . Her father was grieved . '

He professed that he only wished to do what was best for her , but she never would spare herself ; and , going to her side , with his heavy , fond solicitude , he made her promise not to hurt herself , and she laughed and consented . The promise was easily given , for she did not believe she was hurting herself ; and , as to giving up the election , or ceasing secretly to prompt George , that was absolutely out of the question . What could be a greater duty than to incite her husband to usefulness ? '

I am sure there is quite enough in the world that is worrying , without picking shades of manner to pieces . It is the sure way to make an old crab of me , and so I am going off . Only , one parting piece of advice , Miss Bracy — read '
275384	275393	275381	275382	Frank Fairlegh	620	' and put everybody out of your head . '

His Grace can save her , were the surrounding evil far worse than ever it is likely to be . The intermixture with good is the trial , and is it not so everywhere — ever since the world and the Church have seemed fused together ? But she will soon be the child of a Father who guards His own ; and , at least , I can pray for her , and her dear mother . May I only live better , that so I may pray better , and act better , if ever I should have to act . " There was a happy family gathering on the New Year 's Day , and Flora , who had kindly felt her way with Meta , finding her not yet ready to enjoy a public festivity for the village , added a supplement to the Christmas beef ; that a second dinner might be eaten at home , in honour of Miss Leonora Rivers . Lady Leonora was highly satisfied with her visit , which impressed her far more in favour of the Abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days of poor old Mr. Rivers . Flora knew everyone , and gave little select dinner parties , which , by her good management , even George , at the bottom of the table , could not make heavy . Dr. Spencer enjoyed them greatly , and was an unfailing resource for conversation ; and as to the Hoxtons , Flora felt herself amply repaying the kindness she had received in her young lady days , when she walked down to the dining - room with the portly head master , or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring the handsome rooms . '
276147	276246	276137	276140	A very superior person	10283	' was the universal verdict on Mrs. Rivers . Lady Leonora struck up a great friendship with her , and was delighted that she meant to take Meta to London . The only fault that could be found with her was that she had so many brothers ; and Flora , recollecting that her Ladyship mistrusted those brothers , avoided encouraging their presence at the Grange , and took every precaution against any opening for the suspicion that she threw them in the way of her little sister - in - law . Nor had Flora forgotten the Ladies '

Dr. Spencer looked at the Training School , and talked Mrs. Ledwich into magnanimous forgiveness of Mrs. Elwood . Cherry dreaded the ordeal , but she was willing to do anything that was thought right , and likely to make her fitter for her office . Archer Gurney . The tidings came at last , came when the heart - sickness of hope - deferred had faded into the worse heart - sickness of fear deferred , and when spirits had been fain to rebel , and declare that they would be almost glad to part with the hope that but kept alive despair . The Christmas holidays had come to an end , and the home party were again alone , when early in the forenoon , there was a tap at the drawing - room door , and Dr. Spencer called , '
276581	276600	276601	276601	she	300	' Margaret started as if those gentle tones had been a thunderclap . Go ! go , Ethel , '

276939	276955	276911	276912	the captain	9825	' cried Ethel . Margaret raised herself , and the colour came into her face . '
276963	276967	276956	276956	I	0	' she said . '
276971	276977	276978	276978	Richard	298	' said Ethel , alarmed . '

277023	277175	277013	277013	He	298	' continued Margaret , her eyes brightening , but her breath , in long - drawn gasps that terrified Ethel into calling Dr. Spencer . Mary was standing before him , with bloodless face and dilated eyes ; but , as Ethel approached , she turned and rushed up - stairs . Dr. Spencer entered the drawing - room with Ethel , who tried to read his face as he saw Margaret — restored , as it seemed , to all her girlish bloom , and her eyes sparkling as they were lifted up , far beyond the present scene . Ethel had a moment 's sense that his expression was as if he had seen a death - blow struck , but it was gone in a moment , as he gently shook Margaret by the hand , and spoke a word of greeting , as though to recall her . '
277179	277189	277177	277177	you	5755	' she said , with her own grateful smile . '
277195	277201	277192	277193	your father	933	' he asked of Ethel . '
277213	277233	277234	277234	Papa	218	' said Ethel , with a ghastly suspicion , that he thought Margaret in a state to require him . '
277236	277240	277234	277234	Papa	218	' said Margaret . '
277255	277275	277251	277251	I	0	' She turned aside her head , and hid her face . Dr. Spencer signed Ethel nearer to him . '

277306	277487	277295	277295	I	0	' Pressing her hand he departed . Margaret was weeping tranquilly — Ethel knelt down beside her , without daring at first to speak , but sending up intense mental prayers to Him , who alone could bear her or her dear father through their affliction . Then she ventured to take her hand , and Margaret returned the caress , but began to blame herself for the momentary selfishness that had allowed her brother 's loss and her father 's grief to have been forgotten in her own.—Ethel 's " oh ! no ! no ! " did not console her for this which seemed the most present sorrow , but the flow of tears was so gentle , that Ethel trusted that they were a relief . Ethel herself seemed only able to watch her , and to fear for her father , not to be able to think for herself . The front door opened , and they heard Dr. May 's step hesitating in the hall , as if he could not bear to come in . '
277492	277523	277524	277524	You	5764	' cried Margaret , wiping off her tears . Ethel stood a moment in the door - way , then sprang to him , and was clasped in his arms . '
277528	277532	277533	277534	Dr. Spencer	260	' he whispered . '

277614	277633	277634	277634	Papa	218	' he said , then advancing , he hung over Margaret , calling her his own poor darling . '

277872	277986	277987	277989	Dear Miss Ethel	300	' Poor Mary , Ethel felt as if she had neglected her ! She found her hanging over the nursery fire , alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences of Harry 's old days , sometimes almost laughing at his pranks , then crying again , while Aubrey sat between them , drinking in each word . Blanche and Gertrude came from the school - room , where Miss Bracy seemed to have been occupying them , with much kindness and judgment . She came to the door to ask Ethel anxiously for the Doctor and Miss May , and looked so affectionate and sympathizing , that Ethel gave her a hearty kiss . '
278000	278001	277992	277992	you	300	' '
278005	278166	278003	278003	you	300	' said Ethel with all her heart , and hurried away . Nothing was more in favour of Miss Bracy , than that there should be a hurry . Then she could be warm , and not morbid . Dr. May gathered his children round him , and took out the great Prayer - book . He read a Psalm and a prayer from the Burial Service , and the sentence for funerals at sea . Then he touched each of their heads , and , in short broken sentences , gave thanks for those still left to him , and for the blessed hope they could feel for those who were gone ; and he prayed that they might so follow in their footsteps , as to come to the same Holy place , and in the meantime realize the Communion of Saints . Then they said the Lord 's Prayer , he blessed them , and they arose . '
278172	278176	278167	278167	Mary	220	' he said , '
278182	278209	278177	278177	you	220	' She put the case into his hands , and ran away . He went to the study , where he found Dr. Spencer awaiting him . '

278299	278315	278316	278316	Dick	575	' And , covering his face , he let his grief have a free course . '
278334	278335	278336	278336	I	0	' '
278345	278351	278339	278339	I	0	' said poor Dr. May ; '

278459	278475	278452	278452	She	829	' sighed his friend , as he felt his inability to contend with such grief . '
278483	278493	278478	278478	I	0	' Dr. May said , and he looked so . '
278521	278522	278519	278519	Margaret	249	' '
278529	278534	278523	278523	Her	249	' said Dr. Spencer . '

278562	278580	278515	278515	others	7999	' repeated Dr. May , supporting his head on his hand ; and , looking up dreamily — '
278586	278913	278515	278515	others	7999	' The large Bible lay beside him , on the table , and Dr. Spencer thought that he would find more rest there than in his words . Leaving him , therefore , his friend went to undertake his day 's work , and learn , once more , in the anxious enquiries , and saddened countenances of the patients and their friends , how great an amount of love and sympathy that Dr. May had won by his own warmth of heart . The patients seemed to forget their complaints in sighs for their kind Doctors troubles ; and the gouty Mayor of Stoneborough kept Dr. Spencer half - an - hour to listen to his recollections of the bright - faced boy 's droll tricks , and then to the praises of the whole May family , and especially of the mother . Poor Dr. Spencer ! he heard her accident described so many times in the course of the day , that his visits were one course of shrinking and suffering ; and his only satisfaction was in knowing how his friend would be cheered , by hearing of the universal feeling for him and his children . Ethel wrote letters to her brothers ; and Dr. May added a few lines , begging Richard to come home , if only for a few days . Margaret would not be denied writing to Hector Ernescliffe , though she cried over her letter so much , that her father could almost have taken her pen away ; but she said it did her good . When Flora came in the afternoon , Ethel was able to leave Margaret to her , and attend to Mary , with whom Miss Bracy 's kindness had been inefficacious . If she was cheered for a few minutes , some association , either with the past , or the vanished future , soon set her off sobbing again . '
278926	278930	278921	278922	dear Harry	278	' she sobbed , '
278947	278982	278983	278983	Mary	220	' The ghastly uncertainty was too terrible for Ethel to have borne to contemplate it . She knew that it would haunt their pillows , and she was trying to nerve herself by faith . '
278985	278989	278983	278983	Mary	220	' she said , '

279137	279149	279151	279151	Mary	220	' Say it again — what you said about the sea , '
279239	279243	279244	279244	he	856	' Poor Mary , '
279247	279264	279244	279244	he	856	' is she so fond of it ? It is rather a libel than a likeness . '
279265	279304	279244	279244	he	856	' Do n't say so to her , pray , papa . It is all the world to her . Three strokes on paper would have been the same , if they had been called by his name . '
279305	279325	279326	279326	He	856	' Yes ; a loving heart has eyes of its own , and she is a dear good girl ! '
279386	279392	279394	279394	she	220	' It is exactly like — '
279396	279409	279410	279410	he	856	' It ca n't help being so , in a certain sense , '
279414	279433	279410	279410	he	856	' but after all , Mary dear , he did not pout out his chin in that way . '
280198	280248	280249	280249	People	839	' cure of Stoneborough was closed . It made Dr. May very sad — his affections had tendrils for any thing that he had known from boyhood ; and though he had often spoken strong words of the Vicar , he now sat sorrowfully moralizing , and making excuses . '

A disinclination for exertion or going into public hung upon Dr. May , but he was obliged to rouse himself to attend the Town Council meeting , which was held a few days after the Vicar 's funeral , to decide on the next appointment . If it had depended on himself alone , his choice would have been Mr. Edward Wilmot , whom the death of his good old father had uprooted from Settlesham ; and the girls had much hope , but he was too much out of spirits to be sanguine . He said that he should only hear a great deal of offensive stuff from Tomkins the brewer ; and that , in the desire to displease nobody , the votes should settle down on some nonentity , was the best which was likely to happen . Thus , grumbling , he set off , and his daughters watched anxiously for his return . They saw him come through the garden with a quick , light step , that made them augur well , and he entered the room with the corners of his mouth turning up . '

His soft calm manner supported her more than any other human comforter , and she always yearned after him when absent , more than for all the other brothers ; but her father 's decision had been too high - minded for her to dare to wish it recalled , and she could not but own that Richard would have had to undergo more toil and annoyance , than perhaps his health would have endured . Flora had discontinued comments to her sisters , on her father 's proceedings , finding that observations mortified Margaret , and did not tend to peace with Ethel ; but she told her husband that she did not regret it much , for Richard would have exhausted his own income , and his father 's likewise , in paying Curates , and raising funds for charities .

283475	283691	283473	283474	the Ladies	7656	' Committee , though there had been expressions of dismay , when the tidings of the appointment first went abroad , not one of the whole " Aonian choir " liked to dissent from Dr. Spencer , and he talked them over , individually , into a most conformable state , merely by taking their compliance for granted , and showing that he deemed it only the natural state of things , that the Vicar should reign over the charities of the place . The Committee was not dissolved — that would have been an act of violence — but it was henceforth subject to Mr. Wilmot , and he and his Curates undertook the religious instruction in the week , and chose the books — a state of affairs brought about with so much quietness , that Ethel knew not whether Flora , Dr. Spencer , or Mr. Wilmot , had been the chief mover . Mrs. Ledwich was made treasurer of a new coal club , and Miss Rich keeper of the lending library , occupations which delighted them greatly ; and Ethel was surprised to find how much unity of action was springing up , now that the period was over , of each " doing right in her own eyes . " '
283695	283700	283473	283474	the Ladies	7656	' said Dr. Spencer , '
283713	283790	283791	283791	We	5929	' The Cocksmoor accounts were Ethel 's chief anxiety . It seemed as if now there might be a school - house , but with little income to depend upon , since poor Alan Ernescliffe 's annual £ 10 was at an end . However , Dr. May leant over her as she was puzzling over her pounds shillings and pence , and laid a cheque upon her desk . She looked up in his face . '
283799	284314	283791	283791	We	5929	' he said . By - and - by it appeared that Cocksmoor was not out of Hector Ernescliffe 's mind . The boy 's letters to Margaret had been brief , matter of fact , and discouraging , as long as the half - year lasted , and there was not much to be gathered about him from Tom , on his return for the Easter holidays , but soon poor Hector wrote a long dismal letter to Margaret . Captain Gordon had taken him to Maplewood , where the recollection of his brother , and the happy hopes with which they had taken possession , came thronging upon him . The house was forlorn , and the corner that had been unpacked for their reception , was as dreary a contrast to the bright home at Stoneborough , as was the dry , stern Captain , to the fatherly warm - hearted Doctor . Poor Hector had little or nothing to do , and the pleasure of possession had not come yet ; he had no companion of his own age , and bashfulness made him shrink with dislike from introduction to his tenants and neighbours . There was not an entertaining book in the house , he declared , and the Captain snubbed him , if he bought anything he cared to read.—The Captain was always at him to read musty old improving books , and talking about the position he would occupy ! The evenings were altogether unbearable , and if it were not for rabbit shooting now , and the half - year soon beginning again , Hector declared he should be ready to cut and run , and leave Captain Gordon and Maplewood to each other — and very well matched too ! He was nearly in a state of mind to imitate that unprecedented boy , who wrote a letter to the Times , complaining of extra weeks . As to Cocksmoor , Ethel must not think it forgotten ; he had spoken to the Captain about it , and the old wooden - head had gone and answered that it was not incumbent on him , that Cocksmoor had no claims upon him , and he could not make it up out of his allowance ; for the old fellow would not give him a farthing more than he had before , and had said that was too much . There was a great blur over the words " wooden - head , " as if Hector had known that Margaret would disapprove , and had tried to scratch it out . She wrote all the consolation in her power , and exhorted him to patience , apparently without much effect . She would not shew his subsequent letters , and the reading and answering them fatigued her so much , that Hector 's writing was an unwelcome sight at Stoneborough . Each letter , as Ethel said , seemed so much taken out of her , and she begged her not to think about them . '
284327	284338	283791	283791	We	5929	' said Margaret ; and seeing Ethel 's anxious looks , '
284388	284786	284791	284791	February	696	' There was nothing more to be said . They all felt it was good for them that the building at Cocksmoor gave full occupation to thoughts , and conversation ; indeed , Tom declared they never walked in any other direction , nor talked of anything else , and that without Hector , or George Rivers , he had nobody to speak to ! However , he was a good deal tranquilized by an introduction to Dr. Spencer 's laboratory , where he compounded mixtures that Dr. Spencer promised should do no more harm than was reasonable , to himself , or any one else . Ethel suspected that , if Tom had chanced to singe his eyebrows , his friend would not have regretted a blight to his nascent coxcombry , but he was far too careful of his own beauty to do any such thing . Richard was set at liberty just before Easter , and came home to his new charge . He was aware of what had taken place , and heartily grateful for the part his father had taken . To work at Cocksmoor , under Mr. Wilmot , and to live at home , was felicity ; and he fitted at once into his old place , and resumed all the little home services for which he had been always famed . Ethel was certain that Margaret was content , when she saw her brother bending over her , and the sense of reliance and security that the presence of the silent Richard imparted to the whole family , was something very peculiar , especially as they were so much more active and demonstrative than he was . Mr. Wilmot put him at once in charge of the hamlet . The inhabitants were still a hard , rude , unpromising race , and there were many flagrant evils amongst them , but the last few years had not been without some effect — some were less obdurate , a few really touched , and , almost all , glad of instruction for their children . If Ethel 's perseverance had done nothing else , it had , at least , been a witness , and her immediate scholars shewed the influence of her lessons . Burns . In the meantime , the Session of parliament had begun , and the Rivers '

285629	286013	285627	285627	Flora	280	' to have our little Meta as Lady of the Manor at Cocksmoor ? He has begun to talk about Drydale , and there are various suspicious circumstances that Lady Leonora marks with the eyes of a discreet dowager . It was edifying to see how , from smiles , we came to looks , and by - and - by to confidential talks , which have made her entirely forgive me for having so many tall brothers . Poor dear old Mr. Rivers ! Lady Leonora owns that it was the best thing possible for that sweet girl that he did not live any longer to keep her in seclusion ; it is so delightful to see her appreciated as she deserves , and with her beauty and fortune , she might make any choice she pleases . In fact , I believe Lady Leonora would like to look still higher for her , but this would be mere ambition , and we should be far better satisfied with such a connection as this , founded on mutual and increasing esteem , with a man so well suited to her , and fixing her so close to us . You must not , however , launch out into an ocean of possibilities , for the good aunt has only infected me with the castle - building propensities of chaperons , and Meta is perfectly unconscious , looking on him as too hopelessly middle - aged , to entertain any such evil designs , avowing freely that she likes him , and treating him very nearly as she does papa . It is my business to keep " our aunt , " who , between ourselves , has , below the surface , the vulgarity of nature that high - breeding can not eradicate , from startling the little humming - bird , before the net has been properly twined round her bright little heart . As far as I can see , he is much smitten , but very cautious in his approaches , and he is wise . " Margaret did not know what dismay she conveyed , as she handed this letter to her sister . There was no rest for Ethel till she could be alone with her father . '

286110	286130	286025	286026	Mr. Rivers	255	' Absurd ! The lad is hardly one - and - twenty . Very few marry a first love . '
286137	286236	286025	286026	Mr. Rivers	255	' Poor old Rivers only mentioned it as a refuge from fortune - hunters , and it stands to reason that he would have preferred this . Any way , it is awkward for a man with empty pockets to marry an heiress , and it is wholesomer for him to work for his living . Better that it should be out of his head at once , if it were there at all . I trust it was all our fancy . I would not have him grieved now for worlds , when his heart is sore . '

Self - examination notes the symptoms and combats them ; self - contemplation , does as I did when I was unstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore , and was always feeling my own pulse . It dwells on them , and perpetually deplores itself . Oh dear ! this is no better — what a wretch I am . It is always studying its deformities in a moral looking - glass . '
286601	286619	286411	286411	She	300	' Yes , I think poor Norman does that , but I thought it right and humble . '

286650	286660	286411	286411	She	300	' Do you call self - consciousness a fault ? '
286661	286691	286411	286411	She	300	' No . I call it a misfortune . In the vain , it leads to prudent vanity ; in the good , to a painful effort of humility . '

In her next solitary walk to Cocksmoor , Norman joined Ethel .

It was not consistent with cautious sounding , that Norman was always looking appealingly towards her ; and , indeed , she could not wait long with such a question on her mind . She remained with her father in the drawing - room , when the rest were gone up - stairs , and , plunging at once into the matter , she said , '

290773	290789	290771	290771	Harry	278	' He seemed almost afraid to do so , but , recovering himself , exclaimed , '
290809	290879	290804	290804	you	220	' he added , piteously , as he threw his arm round her and kissed her , startled at the cold touch of her cheek . The spell seemed broken , and , with a wild hoarse shriek that rang through the house , she struggled to regain her breath , but it would only come in painful , audible catches , as she held Harry 's hand convulsively .

290885	290892	290882	290882	I	0	' he exclaimed , in distress . '
290904	290921	290922	290923	O nurse	6053	' was old nurse 's exclamation , as she and James came , at the outcry . '

290968	291021	291024	291024	she	7382	' and James , with one wring of the hand , retreated , while old nurse was nearly hugged to death , declaring all the time that he did n't ought to have come in such a way , terrifying everyone out of their senses ! and as for poor Miss May — '
291026	291039	291024	291024	she	7382	' cried Harry , starting at the sight of the vacant sofa . '
291045	291049	291024	291024	she	7382	' said Ethel ; '

291182	291186	291188	291188	Ethel	300	' But Margaret ! '
291248	291280	291222	291222	she	220	' Ethel walked up and down the room , divided between a tumult of joy , grief , dread , and perplexity.—At that moment a little voice said at the door , '
291291	291322	291285	291285	Harry	278	' They looked one upon another in consternation . They had never thought of the child , who , of course , had flown up at once with the tidings . '
291329	291333	291326	291327	Miss Ethel	300	' said nurse . '
291351	291446	291347	291347	Harry	278	' Hand - in - hand , they silently ascended the stairs , and Ethel pushed open the door . Margaret was on her couch , her whole form and face in one throb of expectation . She looked into Harry 's face — the eagerness flitted like sunshine on the hill side , before a cloud , and , without a word , she held out her arms . He threw himself on his knees , and her fingers were clasped among his thick curls , while his frame heaved with suppressed sobs , '
291459	291460	291347	291347	Harry	278	' '
291464	291515	291347	291347	Harry	278	' she said ; then slightly pushing him back , she lay holding his hand in one of hers , and resting the other on his shoulder , and gazing in silence into his face . Each was still — she was gathering strength — he dreaded word or look . '
291522	291529	291569	291569	he	278	' she said , at last . '
291552	291561	291562	291562	He	278	' and he pointed to his own breast . '
291616	291652	291612	291612	Christians	702	' He said this in short disconnected phrases , often pausing to gather voice , but forced to resume , by her inquiring looks , and pressure of his hand . She asked no more . '
291656	291667	291612	291612	Christians	702	' she said , and when he had done so , '
291708	291723	291696	291696	You	0	' She sent them all away , even Ethel , who would have lingered . '
291747	291906	291687	291687	you	0	' Ethel found Mary and Harry interlaced into one moving figure , and Harry greedily asking for his father and Norman , as if famishing for the sight of them . He wanted to set out to seek the former in the town , but his movements were too uncertain , and the girls clung to the newly - found , as if they could not trust him away from them . They wandered about , speaking , all three at random , without power of attending to the answers . It was enough to see him , and touch him ; they could not yet care where he had been . Dr. May was in the midst of them ere they were aware . One look , and he flung his arms round his son , but , suddenly letting him go , he burst away , and banged his study door . Harry would have followed . '
291912	292161	291687	291687	you	0	' said Ethel ; then , seeing him disappointed , she came nearer , and murmured , " He entered into his chamber and — " Harry silenced her with another embrace , but their father was with them again , to verify that he had really seen his boy , and ask , alas ! whether Alan were with Margaret . The brief sad answer sent him to see how it was with her . She would not let him stay ; she said it was infinite comfort , and joy was coming , but she would rather be still , and not come down till evening . Perhaps others would fain have been still , could they have borne an instant 's deprivation of the sight of their dear sailor , while greetings came thickly on him . The children burst in , having heard a report in the town , and Dr. Spencer waited at the door for the confirmation ; but when Ethel would have flown out to him , he waved his hand , shut the door , and hurried away , as if a word to her would have been an intrusion . The brothers had been summoned by a headlong apparition of Will Adams in Cocksmoor school , shouting that Master Harry was come home ; and Norman 's long legs out - speeding Richard , had brought him back , flushed , and too happy for one word , while , '
292166	292501	292164	292164	Harry	278	' was Richard 's utmost , and his care for Margaret seemed to overpower everything else , as he went up , and was not so soon sent away . Words were few down - stairs . Blanche and Aubrey agreed that they thought people would have been much happier , but , in fact , the joy was oppressive from very newness . Ethel roamed about , she could not sit still without feeling giddy , in the strangeness of the revulsion . Her father sat , as if a word would break the blest illusion ; and Harry stood before each of them in turn , as if about to speak , but turned his address into a sudden caress , or blow on the shoulder , and tried to laugh . Little Gertrude , not understanding the confusion , had taken up her station under the table , and peeped out from beneath the cover . There was more composure as they sat at dinner , and yet there was very little talking or eating . Afterwards , Dr. May and Norman exultingly walked away , to shew their Harry to Dr. Spencer and Mr. Wilmot ; and Ethel would gladly have tried to calm herself , and recover the balance of her mind , by giving thanks where they were due ; but she did not know what to do with her sisters . Blanche was wild , and Mary still in so shakey a state of excitement , that she went off into mad laughing , when Blanche discovered that they were in mourning for Harry . Nothing would satisfy Blanche but breaking in on Margaret , and climbing to the top of the great wardrobe to disinter the coloured raiment , beseeching that each favourite might be at once put on , to do honour to Harry . Mary chimed in with her , in begging for the wedding merinos — would not Margaret wear her beautiful blue ? '
292511	292544	292507	292507	I	0	' said Margaret , gently . Mary looked at her , and was again in a flood of tears , incoherently protesting , together with Ethel , that they would not change . '
292549	292553	292547	292547	dears	6070	' said Margaret . '
292599	292659	292585	292585	Richard	298	' Ethel knew that it was for life . Mary could not check her tears , and would go on making heroic protests against leaving off her black , sobbing the more at each . Margaret 's gentle caresses seemed to make her worse ; and Ethel , afraid that Margaret 's own composure would be overthrown , exclaimed , '

292726	292739	292740	292740	Richard	298	' whereat Mary relapsed into a giggle , and Ethel felt frantic . '

292787	292795	292775	292775	Mary	220	' said Richard , tenderly and gravely . '
292802	292806	292775	292775	Mary	220	' began Mary , '
292817	292818	292775	292775	Mary	220	' '
292830	292834	292820	292820	you	220	' said Richard , '

292849	292857	292847	292847	Ritchie	262	' said Ethel , thinking him severe , '
292867	293046	292858	292858	she	220	' Mary began to plead ; but , with his own pretty persuasive manner , he took her by the hand , and drew her into his room ; and when he came down , after an interval , it was to check Blanche , who would have gone up to interrupt her with queries about the perpetual blue merino . He sat down with Blanche on the stair - case window - seat , and did not let her go , till he had gently talked her out of flighty spirits , into the soberness of thankfulness . Ethel , meanwhile , had still done nothing but stray about , long for loneliness , find herself too unsteady to finish her letters to Flora and Tom ; and , while she tried to make Gertrude think Harry a pleasant acquisition , she hated her own wild heart , that could not rejoice , nor give thanks , aright . By - and - by , Mary came down , with her bonnet on , quite quiet now . '
293055	293091	293047	293047	I	0	' she said . Ethel caught at the notion , and it spread through the house . Dr. May , who just then came in with his two sons , looked at Harry , saying , '
293106	293282	293094	293094	you	262	' And Harry , as soon as he understood , declared that he should like nothing better . It seemed what they all needed ; even Aubrey and Gertrude begged to come ; and , when the solemn old Minster was above their heads , and the hallowed stillness around them , the tightened sense of half - realized joy began to find relief in the chant of glory . The voices of the Sanctuary , ever uplifting notes of praise , seemed to gather together and soften their emotions ; and agitation was soothed away , and all that was oppressive and tumultuous gave place to sweet peace and thankfulness . Ethel dimly remembered the like sense of relief , when her mother had hushed her wild ecstacy , while sympathizing with her joy . Richard could not trust his voice , but Mr. Wilmot offered the special thanksgiving . Harry was , indeed , " at home , " and his tears fell fast over his book , as he heard his father 's '
293285	293494	293495	293500	a fine - growed young man	6076	' so fervent and so deep ; and he gazed up and around , with fond and earnest looks , as thoughts and resolutions , formed there of old , came gathering thick upon him . And there little Gertrude seemed first to accept him . She whispered to her papa , as they stood up to go away , that it was very good in God Almighty to have sent Harry home ; and , as they left the Cloister , she slipped into Harry 's hand a daisy from the grave , such a gift as she had never carried to anyone else , save her father and Margaret , and she shrank no longer from being lifted up in his arms , and carried home through the twilight street . He hurried into the drawing - room , and was heard declaring that all was right , for Margaret was on the sofa ; but he stopped short , grieved at her altered looks . She smiled as he stooped to kiss her , and then made him stand erect , and measure himself against Norman , whose height he had almost reached . The little curly midshipman had come back , as nurse said , '
293502	293515	293495	293500	a fine - growed young man	6076	' his rosy cheeks , brown and ruddy , and his countenance — '
293531	293535	293536	293536	He	6076	' said Margaret . '
293548	293553	293536	293536	He	6076	' said his father ; '

293608	293625	293603	293603	Tom	238	' said Harry , after nodding with satisfaction , as they all took their wonted places . '
293628	293632	293603	293603	Tom	238	' exclaimed Richard . '

293791	293843	293789	293789	Ethel	300	' I do n't think our notions are much more defined . Papa and Norman may know more , but we have heard almost nothing . I have been waiting to hear more to close up my letters to Flora and Tom . What a shame that has not been done ! '

294226	294352	294218	294218	I	0	' The words were not out of his mouth , before the second post was brought in , and there were two letters from New Zealand ! What would they not have been yesterday ? Harry would have burnt his own , but the long closely - written sheets were eagerly seized , as affording the best hope of understanding his adventures , as it had been written at intervals from Auckland , and the papers , passing from one to the other , formed the text for interrogations on further details , though much more was gleaned incidentally in tête à têtes , by Margaret , Norman , or his father , and no one person ever heard the whole connectedly from Harry himself . '
294365	294376	294377	294377	Owen	687	' asked Dr. May , looking up from the letter . '

294609	294644	294596	294596	you	278	' said Harry . Ethel thought there was more in that answer than met the ear , and that Harry , at least , had thought of the powder to - night at Church . '
294683	294724	294669	294669	Owen	687	' As to telling how he felt when he saw the good ship Alcestis blown to fragments , that was past Harry , and all but Blanche were wise enough not to ask . She had by way of answer , '
294734	294804	294669	294669	Owen	687	' Nor was Harry willing to dwell on the subsequent days , when the unclouded sun had been a cruel foe : and the insufficient stores of food and water , did , indeed , sustain life , but a life of extreme suffering . What he told was of the kindness that strove to save him , as the youngest , from all that could be spared him . '

295023	295027	295054	295054	Margaret	249	' murmured Harry ; '
295056	295096	295054	295054	Margaret	249	' The tone of the do n't , the reddening cheek , liquid eye , and heaving chest , told enough of what the Lieutenant had been to one , at least , of the desolate boat 's crew . '

295210	295223	295200	295200	We	6103	' twas true enough , and they saw our signal of distress ! '
295419	295424	295426	295426	Harry	278	' There he was , '
295428	295661	295426	295426	Harry	278	' laid up in a little bit of a stifling cabin , just like an over ; without the possibility of a breath of air ! The skin - flint skipper carried no medicine ; the water , shocking stuff it was , was getting so low , that there was only a pint a day served out to each , and though all of us Alcestes clubbed every drop we could spare for him — it was bad work ! Owen and I never were more glad in our lives than when we heard we were to cast anchor at the Loyalty isles ! Such a place as it was ! You little know what it was to see anything green ! And there was this isle fringed down close to the sea with cocoa - nut trees ! and the bay as clear!—you could see every shell , and wonderful fishes swimming in it ! Well , everyone was for going ashore , and some of the natives swam out to us , and brought things in their canoes , but not many ; it is not encouraged by the mission , nor by David — for those Yankee traders are not the most edifying society — and the crew vowed they were cannibals , and had eaten a man three years ago , so they all went ashore armed . '
295662	295668	295670	295670	Margaret	249	' You staid with him , '
295672	295753	295670	295670	Margaret	249	' Aye , it was my turn , and I was glad enough to have some fresh fruit and water for him , but he could not take any notice of it . Did not I want you , papa ? Well , by - and - by , Owen came back , in a perfect rapture with the place and the people , and said it was the only hope for Mr. Ernescliffe , to take him on shore — '
295754	295764	295766	295766	Blanche	300	' Then you did really go amongst the cannibals ! '
295768	295774	295776	295776	Harry	278	' That is all nonsense , '
295778	295813	295776	295776	Harry	278	' Some of them may once have been , and I fancy the heathens might not mind a bit of " long pig " still ; but these have been converted by the Samoans . '
296393	296444	296387	296387	he	6153	' he would never leave the young gentleman that had befriended his boy , to be eaten up by them black savage niggers . If they made roast - pork of Mr. May , he would be eaten first , though he reckoned they would find him a tougher morsel . '
296731	296784	296728	296728	he	222	' I have seen a ship built by a sailor 's vow ; the roof was like the timbers of a ship — that was right . Mind , it is so . That is the ship that bears through the waves ; there is the anchor that enters within the veil . '
297122	297133	297119	297119	he	222	' Is it you , Harry ? God bless you ; '
298012	298031	298454	298457	the old Great Bear	6215	' graves scattered from the tropics to the poles , and which might be the first seed in a '
298035	298449	298454	298457	the old Great Bear	6215	' to that island , becoming what the graves of holy men of old are to us . A short space more of kind care from his new friends , and his Christian Chief , and Harry awoke from a feverish doze at sounds that seemed so like a dream of home , that he was unwilling to break them by rousing himself , but they approved themselves as real , and he found himself in the embrace of his mother 's sister . And here Mrs. Arnott 's story began , of the note that reached her in the early morning with tidings that her nephew had been picked up by the mission - ship , and how she and her husband had hastened , at once , on board . " They sent me below to see a hero , " she wrote . " What I saw was , a scarecrow sort of likeness of you , dear Richard ; but , when he opened his eyes , there was our Maggie smiling at me . I suppose he would not forgive me for telling how he sobbed and cried , when he had his arms round my neck , and his poor aching head on my shoulder . Poor fellow , he was very weak , and I believe he felt , for the moment , as if he had found his mother . " " We brought him home with us , but when the next mail went , the fever was still so high , that I thought it would be only alarm to you to write , and I had not half a story either , though you may guess how proud I was of my nephew . " Harry 's troubles were all over from that time . He had thenceforth to recover under his aunt 's motherly care , while talking endlessly over the home that she loved almost as well as he did . He was well more quickly than she had ventured to hope , and nothing could check his impatience to reach his home , not even the hopes of having his aunt for a companion . The very happiness he enjoyed with her only made him long the more ardently to be with his own family ; and he had taken his leave of her , and of his dear David , and sailed by the first packet leaving Auckland . '
298467	298498	298454	298457	the old Great Bear	6215	' said Harry . It was late when the elders had finished all that was to be heard at present , and the clock reminded them that they must part . '

298548	298621	298625	298625	Jennings	356	' Richard , who had been making friends with Jennings , whenever he had not been needed by his sisters that afternoon , went to fetch him from the kitchen , where all the servants , and all their particular friends , were listening to the yarn that made them hold their heads higher , as belonging to Master Harry . Harry stepped forward , met Jennings , and said , aside , '
298635	298653	298625	298625	Jennings	356	' Dr. May had already seen the sailor , but he could not help addressing him again . '

298686	298730	298625	298625	Jennings	356	' said Margaret , breathlessly , as the embarrassed sailor stood , sleeking down his hair ; and , when he had advanced to her couch , she looked up in his face , and put her hand into his great brown one . '

298748	298792	298746	298746	sir	7572	' cried Jennings , almost crying , and looking round for Harry , as a sort of protector—'tell them , sir , please , it was only my duty — I could not do no less , and you knows it , sir , '
298804	298811	298813	298813	Margaret	249	' We know you could not , '
298815	298856	298813	298813	Margaret	249	' and that is what we would thank you for , if we could . I know he — Mr. Ernescliffe — must have been much more at rest for leaving my brother with so kind a friend , and — '
298857	298965	298746	298746	sir	7572	' Please , miss , do n't say no more about it . Mr. Ernescliffe was as fine an officer as ever stepped a quarter - deck , and Mr. May here wo n't fall short of him ; and was I to be after leaving the like of them to the mercy of the black fellows — that was not so bad neither ? If it had only pleased God that we had brought them both back to you , miss ; but , you see , a man ca n't be everything at once , and Mr. Ernescliffe was not so stout as his heart . '
298966	298974	298976	298977	Dr. May.	401	' You did everything , we know — '
298978	298984	298986	298986	Jennings	356	'' Twas a real pleasure , '
298990	299038	298986	298986	Jennings	356	' for two such real gentlemen as they was . Mr. May , sir , I beg your pardon if I say it to your face , never flinched , nor spoke a word of complaint , through it all ; and , as to the other — '
299039	299046	299048	299048	Richard	298	' Margaret can not bear this , '
299053	299059	299048	299048	Richard	298	' It is too much . '
299101	299125	299084	299084	Harry	278	' He says he is glad he has seen Margaret ; he says she is the right sort of stuff for Mr. Ernescliffe . '

And looking in again at half - past seven , he found Harry half - dressed , with his arm round Mary ; laughing , almost sobbing , over the treasures in his cupboard , which he had newly discovered in their fresh order . Dr. May looked like a new man that morning , with his brightened eye and bearing , as if there were a well - spring of joy within him , ready to brim over at once in tear and in smile , and finding an outlet in the praise and thanksgiving that his spirit chanted , and his face expressed , and in that sunny genial benevolence that must make all share his joy . He was going to run over half the town — everyone would like to hear it from him ; Ethel and Mary must go to the rest — the old women in the almshouses , where lived an old cook who used to be fond of Harry — they should have a feast — all who were well enough in the hospital should have a tea - drinking — Dr. Hoxton had already granted a holiday to the school ; every boy with whom they had any connection should come to dinner , and Edward Anderson should be asked to meet Harry on his return , because , poor fellow , he was so improved . Dr. May was in a such a transport of kind - hearted schemes , that he was not easily made to hear that Harry had not a sixpence wherewith to reach London . Ethel , meanwhile , was standing beside her brother tendering to him some gold , as his last quarter . '

The station - master , thinking he could not do enough for the returned mariner , put the two brothers into the coupé , as if they had been a bridal couple , and they were very glad of the privacy , having , as yet , hardly spoken to each other , when Harry 's attention was dispersed among so many . Norman asked many questions about the mission work in the southern hemisphere , and ended by telling his brother of his design , which met with Harry 's hearty approbation . '

300211	300220	300207	300207	she	8272	' said Norman , anxious to silence him ; '
300240	300241	300236	300238	Sir Henry Walkinghame	219	' '
300244	300250	300236	300238	Sir Henry Walkinghame	219	' cried the volatile sailor . '
300267	300288	300251	300251	I	0	' and he laughed heartily over that adventure , ending , however , with a sigh , as he said , '
300356	300357	300340	300345	that fine fashionable aunt of hers	6256	' '
300362	300623	300624	300624	Norman	227	' said Norman . Ha ! said Harry to himself , I see how it is ! She has gone and made poor old June unhappy , with her scornful airs — a little impertinent puss!—I wonder Flora does not teach her better manners . Norman , meanwhile , as the train sped over roofs , and among chimneys , was reproaching himself for running into the fascination of her presence , and then recollecting that her situation , as well as his destiny , both guaranteed that they could meet only as friendly connections . No carriage awaited them at the station , which surprised Norman , till he recollected that the horses had probably been out all day , and it was eight o'clock . Going to Park Lane in a cab , the brothers were further surprised to find themselves evidently not expected . The butler came to speak to them , saying that Mr. and Mrs. Rivers were gone out to dinner , but would return , probably , at about eleven o'clock . He conducted them up - stairs , Harry following his brother , in towering vexation and disappointment , trying to make him turn to hear that they would go directly — home — to Eton — anywhere — why would he go in at all ? The door was opened , Mr. May was announced , and they were in a silk - lined boudoir , where a little slender figure in black started up , and came forward with outstretched hand . '
300626	300630	300624	300624	Norman	227	' she cried , '
300644	300645	300639	300639	your	227	' '

300676	300711	300664	300664	She	280	' As she spoke , Meta had given her hand to Harry , as it was evidently expected ; she raised her eyes to his face , and said , smiling , and blushing , '

300734	300738	300725	300725	I	0	' said Norman . '
300748	300776	300725	300725	I	0	' Laughing , glancing , and casting down her eyes , she raised them with a sudden start of joy , but colouring more deeply , said , '

300799	300803	300794	300794	you	227	' said Norman . '
300810	300826	300807	300807	I	0	' she answered , faltering ; but perceiving how bright were the looks of both , '
300835	300836	300794	300794	you	227	' '
300842	300884	300794	300794	you	227	' said both brothers with one voice . She clasped her hands , and absolutely bounded with transport , then grasped both Harry 's hands , and then Norman 's , her whole countenance radiant with joy and sympathy beyond expression . '
300891	300897	300887	300889	dear Dr. May	238	' was her first exclamation . '
300910	300921	300908	300908	Margaret	249	' She looked up at Norman , and came nearer . '
300928	300936	300924	300925	Mr. Ernescliffe	222	' she asked softly , and trembling . '
300939	300960	300963	300963	Meta	402	' was the low answer , which Harry could not bear to hear , and therefore walked to the window . '
300983	301033	300973	300973	He	222	' as he signed towards his brother . And as Harry continued to gaze out on the stars of gas on the opposite side of the park , he was able to add a few of the particulars . Meta 's eyes glistened with tears , as she said , '
301085	301086	301088	301088	she	249	' '
301095	301104	301088	301088	she	249	' said Harry , coming back to them . '
301112	301116	301105	301105	She	249	' said Meta . '
301164	301198	301158	301158	you	6259	' A refection of tea and cold meat was preferred , and in her own pretty manner , Meta lavished her welcomes , trying to cover any pain given by Flora 's neglect . '
301205	301239	301158	301158	you	6259	' asked Harry , looking round on the beautifully furnished apartment , which , to many eyes besides those fresh from a Milanesian hut , might have seemed a paradise of luxurious ease . '
301254	301260	301240	301240	You	6259	' said Meta , merrily . '

301853	301861	301873	301873	Meta	402	' So you do n't like it . '
301862	301871	301873	301873	Meta	402	' Oh yes ! it is very pleasant , '
301875	301989	301873	301873	Meta	402	' It is so entertaining when we talk it over afterwards , and I like to hear how Flora is admired , and called the beauty of the season . I tell George , and we do so gloat over it together ! There was an old French Marquis the other night , a dear old man , quite of the ancien régime , who said she was exactly like the portraits of Madame de Maintenon , and produced a beautiful miniature on a snuff - box , positively like that very pretty form of face of hers . The old man even declared that Mistress Rivers was worthy to be a Frenchwoman . '
301990	301998	302001	302001	Harry	219	' I should like to kick him ! '
302003	302034	302001	302001	Harry	219	' I hope you wo n't to - morrow ! But do n't let us waste our time over this ; I want so much to hear about New Zealand . '
302140	302153	302155	302155	Meta	402	' How glad you must be that you are likely to go ! '
302188	302192	302194	302194	Meta	402	' Now then ! '

302618	302849	302606	302606	I	0	' The usual questions and their sad answers ensued , and while Flora talked to Harry , fondly holding his hand , Norman and Meta explained the history to George , who no sooner comprehended it , than he opined it must have been a horrid nuisance , and that Harry was a gallant fellow ; then striking him over the shoulder , welcomed him home with all his kind heart , told him he was proud to receive him , and falling into a state of rapturous hospitality , rang the bell , and wanted to order all sorts of eatables and drinkables , but was sadly baffled to find him already satisfied . There was more open joy than even at home , and Flora was supremely happy as she sat between her brothers , listening and enquiring till far past one o'clock , when she perceived poor George dozing off , awakened every now and then by a great nod , and casting a wishful glance of resigned remonstrance , as if to appeal against sitting up all night . The meeting at breakfast was a renewal of pleasure . Flora was proud and happy in shewing off her little girl , a model baby , as she called her , a perfect doll for quietness , so that she could be brought in at Family Prayers ; '

303181	303319	303320	303320	I	0	' George began a conversation with Harry on nautical matters , and Norman tried to discover how Meta liked the yachting project , and found her prepared to think it charming . Hopes were expressed that Harry might be at Portsmouth , and a quantity of gay scheming ensued , with reiterations of the name of Walkinghame , while Norman had a sense of being wrapped in some grey mist , excluding him from participation in their enjoyments , and condemned his own temper , as frivolous , for being thus excited to discontent . Presently , he heard George insisting that he and Harry should return in time for the evening party ; and , on beginning to refuse , was amazed to find Harry 's only objection was on the score of lack of uniform .

303391	303422	303374	303374	you	6322	' Norman , however , took a private opportunity of asking Harry if he was aware of what he was undertaking , and what kind of people they should meet . '
303434	303454	303455	303455	I	0	' said Harry , as if all society , provided it was not cannibal , were alike to him . '

Harry next despatched his business at the Admiralty , and was made very happy by tidings of his friend Owen 's safe arrival in America . Thence the brothers went to Eton , where home letters had been more regarded ; and Dr. May having written to secure a holiday for the objects of their visit , they were met at the station by the two boys . Hector 's red face and prominent light eyebrows were instantly recognised ; but , as to Tom , Harry could hardly believe that the little , dusty , round - backed grub he had left , had been transformed into the well - made gentlemanlike lad before him , peculiarly trim and accurate in dress , even to the extent of as much foppery as Eton taste permitted . Ten minutes had not passed before Tom , taking a survey of the new comer , began to exclaim at Norman , for letting him go about such a figure ; and , before they knew what was doing , they had all been conducted into the shop of the '

303787	303807	303506	303506	she	280	' kept on taking up , and unrolling from their tight rings , to measure the number of inches . '
303812	303823	303506	303506	she	280	' said he , as they issued from the shop ; '

303859	303866	303845	303845	you	6332	' said Harry , much amused . '
303872	303884	303869	303870	a savage	6179	' said Tom , to whom it was no laughing matter . '

303896	303900	303869	303870	a savage	6179	' exclaimed Hector . '

They had reached their tutor 's house , and , opening his own door , he made an imploring sign to Harry to enter with him . On the table lay a letter from Margaret , and another which Harry had written to him from Auckland . '

304513	304563	304419	304422	the heir of Maplewood	6362	' Aye . At Valparaiso , he had a touch of fever ; I went ashore to nurse him , to a merchant 's , who took us in for love of our Scottish blood . Mr. Ernescliffe made a will there , and left it in his charge . '
304564	304575	304376	304376	I	0	' Do you think he made Dr. May my guardian ? '
304576	304595	304502	304502	Hector	243	' He asked me whether I thought he would dislike it , and I told him , no . '

Flora might have trusted Harry alone . George contributed no more than the dignity of his presence ; and , indeed , would have resigned the pursuit at the first blunder about the firm ; and still more when the right one had been found , but the partner proved crusty , and would not believe that any such document was in his hands . George was consenting to let it rest till Mr. Mackintosh could be written to ; but Harry , outrunning his management , and regardless of rebuffs , fairly teased the old gentleman into a search , as the only means of getting rid of the troublesome sailor . In the midst of George 's civil regrets at the fruitless trouble they were causing , forth came a bundle of papers , and forth from the bundle fell a packet , on which Harry pounced as he read , " Will of Alan Halliday Ernescliffe , Esquire , of Maplewood , Yorkshire , Lieutenant in H.

He said he could almost promise her that the first stone should be laid before the end of the summer , and she thanked him in her own warm sweet way , hoping that it would be while Hector and Harry were at home . Harry soon returned , having gone through the Court Martial with the utmost credit , been patronized by Captain Gordon in an unheard - of manner , asked to dine with the Admiral , and promised to be quickly afloat again . Ere many days had passed , he was appointed to one of the finest vessels in the fleet , commanded by a Captain to whom Captain Gordon had introduced him , and , who " seemed to have taken a fancy to him , " as he said . The Bucephalus , now the object of his pride , was refitting , and his sisters hoped to see a good deal of him before he should again sail . Besides , Flora would be at Ryde before the end of July . It was singular that Ethel 's vision should have been fulfilled simultaneously with Flora 's having obtained a position so far beyond what could have been anticipated . She was evidently extremely happy and valuable , much admired and respected , and with full exercise for the energy and cleverness , which were never more gratified than by finding scope for action . Her husband was devotedly attached to her , and was entirely managed by her , and though her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not pertaining to her own sphere , she was , in fact , his understanding . She read , listened , and thought for him , imbued him with her own views , and composed his letters for him ; ruling his affairs , both political and private , and undeniably making him fill a position , which , without her , he would have left vacant ; nor was there any doubt that he was far happier for finding himself of consequence , and being no longer left a charge upon his own hands . He seemed fully to suffice to her as a companion , although she was so far superior in power ; for it was , perhaps , her nature to love best that which depended upon her , and gave her a sense of exercising protection ; as she had always loved Margaret better than Ethel . " Mrs. Rivers was an admirable woman . " So everyone felt , and her youthful beauty and success in the fashionable world , made her qualities , as a wife and mistress of a household , the more appreciated . She never set aside her religious habits or principles , was an active member of various charitable associations , and found her experience of the Stoneborough Ladies '
311889	312253	311887	311888	Flora Rivers	723	' only fault , her over strictness , which encouraged Meta in the same , but there were points that Flora could not have yielded on any account , without failing in her own eyes . She made time for everything , and though , between business and fashion , she seemed to undertake more than mortal could accomplish , it was all effected , and excellently . She did , indeed , sigh over the briefness of the time that she could bestow on her child or on home correspondence , and declared that she should rejoice in rest ; but , at the same time , her achievements were a positive pleasure to her . Meta , in the meantime , had been living passively on the most affectionate terms with her brother and sister , and though often secretly yearning after the dear old father , whose darling she had been , and longing for power of usefulness , she took it on trust that her present lot had been ordered for her , and was thankful , like the bird of Dr. May 's fable , for the pleasures in her path — culling sweet morals , and precious thoughts out of book , painting or concert , occasions for Christian charities in each courtesy of society , and opportunities for cheerful selfdenial and submission , whenever any little wish was thwarted . So Norman said she had turned into a fine lady ! It was a sudden and surprising intimation , and made a change in the usually bright and calm current of her thoughts . She was not aware that there had been any alteration in herself , and it was a revelation that set her to examine where she had changed — poor little thing ! She was not angry , she did not resent the charge , she took it for granted that , coming from such a source , it must be true and reasonable — and what did it mean ? Did they think her too gay , or neglectful of old friends ? What had they been saying to Harry about her ? '
312256	312260	311887	311888	Flora Rivers	723	' thought Meta , '
312428	312507	312411	312411	he	6515	' So meditated Meta , as she copied one of her own drawings of the Grange , for her dear old governess , Mrs. Larpent , while each line and tint recalled the comments of her fond amateur father , and the scenery carried her home , in spite of the street sounds , and the scratching of Flora 's pen , coursing over note paper . Presently , Sir Henry Walkinghame called , bringing a beautiful bouquet . '
312510	312514	312411	312411	he	6515	' cried Meta . '
312532	312600	312517	312517	Flora	723	' She began at once to arrange the flowers , a task that seemed what she was born for , and the choice roses and geraniums acquired fresh grace as she placed them in the slender glasses and classic vases ; but Flora 's discerning eyes perceived some mortification on the part of the gentleman , and , on his departure , playfully reproached Meta for ingratitude .

312696	312731	312678	312678	Flora	723	' said Flora , kissing her earnest forehead , inging the bell , and gathering up her papers , as she walked out of the room , and gave her notes to the servant . '
312776	312911	312760	312760	He	219	' Instances of his complaisance towards herself rose before her , so as to excite some warmth and gratitude . Her lonely heart thrilled at the idea of being again the best beloved , and her energetic spirit bounded at the thought of being no longer condemned to a life of idle ease . Still it was too new a light to her to be readily accepted , after she had looked on him so long , merely as a familiar of the house , attentive to her , because she fell to his share , when Flora was occupied . She liked him , decidedly ; she could possibly do more ; but she was far more inclined to dread , than to desire , any disturbance of their present terms of intercourse . '
312914	312918	312760	312760	He	219	' thought she , '
313097	313324	313325	313325	Flora	280	' Catching Flora was not the easiest thing in the world , among her multifarious occupations ; but Meta was not the damsel to lose an opportunity for want of decision . Flora saw what was coming , and was annoyed with herself for having given the alarm ; but , after all , it must have come some time or other , though she had rather that Meta had been more involved first . It should be premised that Mrs. Rivers had no notion of the degree of attachment felt by her brother for Meta ; she only knew that Lady Leonora had a general distrust of her family , and she felt it a point of honour to promote no dangerous meetings , and to encourage Sir Henry — a connection who would be most valuable , both as conferring importance upon George in the county , and as being himself related to persons of high influence , whose interest might push on her brothers . Preferment for Richard ; promotion for Harry ; nay , diplomatic appointments for Tom , came floating before her imagination , even while she smiled at her Alnaschar visions . But the tone of Meta , as she drew her almost forcibly into her room , shewed her that she had given a great shock to her basket . '

313472	313506	313466	313466	you	280	' began Meta ; but , from the colour of her cheek , and the timid resolution of her tone , Flora thought it safest not to hear the interrogation , and answered , '
313563	313600	313601	313601	Meta	402	' Flora had never gone so near an untruth , as when she led Meta to believe this was the sole reason . But , after all , what did Flora herself know to the contrary ? '
313652	313656	313658	313658	George	606	' My dear , '
313660	313683	313658	313658	George	606	' when do you think of going down to take the baby to the Grange ? She looks dull , I think . '
313684	313700	313702	313702	Flora	280	' Really , I think it is hardly worth while to go down en masse , '
313704	313730	313658	313658	George	606	' These last debates may be important , and it is a bad time to quit one 's post . Do n't you think so ? '
313731	313743	313658	313658	George	606	' As you please — the train is a great bore . '
313744	313802	313658	313658	George	606	' And we will send the baby down the last day before we go to Ryde , with Preston and Butts to take care of her . We ca n't spare him to take them down , till we shut up the house . It is so much easier for us to go to Portsmouth from hence . '
314037	314045	314047	314047	Flora	280	' No , no , little Miss , '
314051	314107	314047	314047	Flora	280	' you do n't talk to Ethel till your fate is irrevocable . Why , if I had listened to her , I should be thankful to be singing at Mrs. Hoxton 's parties at this minute ! and , as for herself , look at Norman Ogilvie ! No , no , after six weeks '

314159	314168	314169	314169	she	280	' said Margaret , holding up a letter ; '

314189	314305	314169	314169	she	280	' Margaret read—'Will you ask papa whom I had better call in to see the baby . There does not seem to be anything positively amiss , but I am not happy about her . There is a sleepiness about her which I do not understand , and , when roused , she is fretful , and will not be amused . There is a look in her eyes which I do not like , and I should wish to have some advice for her . Lady Leonora recommends Mr. — , but I always distrust people who are very much the rage , and I shall send for no one without papa 's advice . '
314306	314311	314313	314314	Dr. May	238	' Let me see ! '

314539	314587	314534	314534	she	280	' Dr. May kept his word , and the letter had evidently not been neglected ; for George was watching for him at the station , and thanked him so eagerly for coming , that Dr. May feared that he was indeed needed , and inquired anxiously . '
314605	314609	314594	314594	she	280	' replied George . '

314643	314698	314635	314635	Flora	280	' Dr. May made an impatient movement , and thought the way long , till they were set down in Park Lane . Meta came to meet them on the stairs , and said that the baby was just the same , and Flora was in the nursery , and thither they hastily ascended . '
314710	314778	314702	314702	I	0	' said Flora , starting up from her low seat , beside the cradle . Dr. May hardly paused to embrace his daughter , and she anxiously led him to the cradle , and tried to read his expression , as his eyes fell on the little face , somewhat puffed , but of a waxy whiteness , and the breathing seeming to come from the lips . '
314786	314797	314782	314782	she	6565	' he asked , in a rapid , professional manner . '
314832	314844	314845	314845	Her	6565	' said Flora , more and more alarmed by his manner . '
314860	314993	314852	314852	she	6565	' added she , as the child feebly moaned , on Dr. May beginning to take her from her cradle ; but , without attending to the objection , he lifted her up , so that she lay as quietly as before , on his arm . Flora had trusted that hope and confidence would come with him ; but , on the contrary , every lurking misgiving began to rush wildly over her , as she watched his countenance , while he carried his little grand - daughter towards the light , studied her intently , raised her drooping eyelids , and looked into her eyes , scarcely eliciting another moan . Flora dared not ask a question , but looked on with eyes open , as it were , stiffened . '
315001	315026	315027	315027	We	6567	' were Dr. May 's first words , breaking on all with startling suddenness ; but , before anyone could speak , he added , '

315081	315115	315050	315050	Godfrey	727	' he broke off to apportion the dose , and to hold the child in a position to administer it — Flora tried to give it — the nurse tried — in vain . '
315122	315146	315148	315148	he	7572	' said the Doctor , as Flora would have renewed the trial—'it can not be done . What have you all been doing ? '

319080	319174	319175	319175	Flora	346	' I never have been'—and she bent over her child , as if taking her leave for eternity . His tongue almost clave to the roof of his mouth , as he heard the words — words elicited by one of those hours of true reality that , like death , rend aside every wilful cloak of self - deceit , and self - approbation . He had no power to speak at first ; when he recovered it , his reply was not what his heart had , at first , prompted . '

319399	319537	319377	319377	He	0	' The most terrible part of this sentence was to Dr. May , that Flora spoke as if she knew it all as a certainty , and without apparent emotion , with all the calmness of despair . What she had never guessed before had come clearly and fully upon her now , and without apparent novelty , or , perhaps , there had been misgivings in the midst of her complacent self - satisfaction . She did not even seem to perceive how dreadfully she was shocking her father , whose sole comfort was in believing her language the effect of exaggerated self - reproach . His profession had rendered him not new to the sight of despondency , and , dismayed as he was , he was able at once to speak to the point . '

319556	319594	319377	319377	He	0	' said her mother , and her assent was in the same tone of resigned despair , owning it best for her child to be spared a worldly education , and loving her truly enough to acquiesce . '
319603	319608	319595	319595	I	0	' continued Dr. May , '
319636	319655	319626	319626	Flora	346	' She could not accept the encouragement , and only formed , with her lips , the words , '
319664	319805	319626	319626	Flora	346	' The simplicity and hearty piety which , with all Dr. May 's faults , had always been part of his character , and had borne him , in faith and trust , through all his trials , had never belonged to her . Where he had been sincere , erring only from impulsiveness , she had been double - minded and calculating ; and , now that her delusion had been broken down , she had nothing to rest upon . Her whole religious life had been mechanical , deceiving herself more than even others , and all seemed now swept away , except the sense of hypocrisy , and of having cut herself off , for ever , from her innocent child . Her father saw that it was vain to argue with her , and only said , '
319831	319890	319822	319822	I	0	' As she made no reply , he repeated the Lord 's Prayer , but she did not join ; and then he added a broken , hesitating intercession for the mourners , which caused her to bury her face deeper in her hands , but her dull wretchedness altered not . Rising , he said , authoritatively , '

319918	319931	319909	319909	You	2023	' said Flora , with somewhat of her anxious , considerate self . '

320161	320242	320243	320243	George	672	' Dr. May felt cheered . He was sure that hope must again rise out of unselfish love and duty . Their return awoke George , who started , half - sitting up , wondering why he was spending the night in so unusual a manner , and why Flora looked so pale , in the morning light , with her loosened , drooping hair . She went straight to him , and , kneeling by his side , said , '
320247	320878	320879	320879	Papa	218	' The same moment he had caught her to his bosom ; but so impressed was his tardy mind , with the peril of talking to her , that he held her in his arms without a single word , till Dr. May had unclosed his lips — a sign would not suffice — he must have a sentence to assure him ; and then it was such joy to have her restored , and his fondness and solicitude were so tender and eager in their clumsiness , that his father - in - law was touched to the heart . Flora was quite herself again , in presence of mind and power of dealing with him ; and Dr. May left them to each other , and went to his own room , for such rest as sorrow , sympathy , and the wakening city , would permit him . When the house was astir for the morning kept by human creatures , and the Doctor had met Meta in the breakfast - room , and held with her a sad , affectionate conversation , George came down with a fair report of his wife , and took her father to see her . That night had been like an illness to her , and , though perfectly composed , she was feeble and crushed , keeping the room darkened , and reluctant to move or speak . Indeed , she did not seem able to give her attention to anyone 's voice , except her husband 's . When Dr. May , or Meta , spoke to her , she would miss what they said , beg their pardon , and ask them to repeat it ; and , sometimes , even then , become bewildered . They tried reading to her , but she did not seem to listen , and her half - closed eye had the expression of listless dejection , that her father knew betokened that , even as last night , her heart refused to accept promises of comfort as meant for her . For George , however , her attention was always ready , and was perpetually claimed . He was forlorn and at a loss without her , every moment ; and , in the sorrow which he too felt most acutely , could not have a minute 's peace unless soothed by her presence ; he was dependant on her to a degree which amazed and almost provoked the Doctor , who could not bear to have her continually harassed and disturbed , and yet was much affected by witnessing so much tenderness , especially in Flora , always the cold utilitarian member of his family . In the middle of the day , she rose and dressed , because George was unhappy at having to sit without her , though only in the next room . She sat in the large arm - chair , turned away from the blinded windows , never speaking nor moving , save when he came to her , to make her look at his letters and notes , when she would , with the greatest patience and sweetness , revise them , suggest word or sentence , rouse herself to consider each petty detail , and then sink back into her attitude of listless dejection . To all besides , she appeared totally indifferent ; gently courteous to Meta and to her father , when they addressed her , but otherwise shewing little consciousness whether they were in the room ; and yet , when something was passing about her father 's staying or returning , she rose from her seat , came up to him before he was aware , and said , '
320889	321005	320883	320883	you	218	' in such an imploring tone , that if he had ever thought of quitting her , he could not have done so . He longed to see her left to perfect tranquillity , but such could not be in London . Though theirs was called a quiet house , the rushing stream of traffic wearied his country ears , the door - bell seemed ceaselessly ringing , and though Meta bore the brunt of the notes and messages , great numbers necessarily came up to Mr. Rivers , and of these Flora was not spared one . Dr. May had his share too of messages and business , and friends and relations , the Rivers '
321151	321167	321142	321142	himself	238	' Oh ! Meta , sorrow weighs more heavily in town than in the country ! '
321168	321171	321173	321173	Meta	402	' Yes ! '
321175	321196	321142	321142	himself	238	' If one only could go out and look at the flowers , and take poor Flora up a nosegay ! '
321197	321210	321212	321213	the Doctor	890	' I do n't think it would make much difference to her , '
321215	321223	321225	321225	Meta	402	' Yes , I think it would , '
321227	321242	321225	321225	Meta	402	' it did to me . The sights there speak of the better sights . '
321243	321253	321255	321256	Dr. May	238	' The power to look must come from within , '
321264	321267	321269	321269	Meta	402	' Aye , '
321271	321326	321269	321269	Meta	402	' as Mr. Ernescliffe said , " heaven is as near — ! " But the skirts of heaven are more easily traced in our mountain view , than here , where , if I looked out of window , I should only see that giddy string of carriages and people pursuing each other ! '
321327	321377	321225	321225	Meta	402	' Well , we shall get her home as soon as she is able to move , and I hope it may soothe her . What a turmoil it is ! There has not been one moment without noise in the twenty - two hours I have been here ! '
321378	321390	321269	321269	Meta	402	' What would you say if you were in the City ? '
321391	321431	321269	321269	Meta	402	' Ah ! there 's no talking of it , but if I had been a fashionable London physician , as my father - in - law wanted to make me , I should have been dead long ago ! '
321432	321445	321225	321225	Meta	402	' No , I think you would have liked it very much . '
321446	321449	321269	321269	Meta	402	' Why ? '
321450	321460	321462	321462	Meta	402	' Love 's a flower that will not die , '
321467	321478	321462	321462	Meta	402	' You would have found so much good to do — '
321479	321490	321492	321493	Dr. May.	346	' And so much misery to rend one 's heart , '
321494	321511	321269	321269	Meta	402	' But , after all , I suppose there is only a certain capacity of feeling . '
321512	321524	321526	321526	Meta	402	' It is within , not without , as you said , '
321528	321535	321537	321538	Dr. May	238	' Ha ! there 's another ! '
321560	321569	321571	321571	Meta	402	' It was Sir Henry Walkinghame 's ring , '
321573	321582	321571	321571	Meta	402	' It is always his time of day . '
321609	321615	321617	321617	Meta	402	' I suppose we must , '
321624	321633	321617	321617	Meta	402	' Lady Walkinghame must be anxious about Flora . '

321764	321779	321761	321761	he	219	' He will be an acquisition when he takes up his abode at Drydale . '
321780	321783	321785	321785	Meta	402	' Yes , '
322125	322156	322117	322117	her	402	' Meta , dear , Preston is in the housekeeper 's room . Will you go and speak to her for a moment , to reassure her before I come ? '
322157	322162	322117	322117	her	402	' Oh ! Flora ! '
322163	322169	322171	322171	Flora	346	' I sent for her , '
322176	322202	322171	322171	Flora	346	' I thought it would be a good opportunity while George is out . Will you be kind enough to prepare her , my dear ? '

322498	322522	322494	322494	Flora	346	' I am very sorry for you — you knew no better , and I should not have left so much to you . '

322557	322577	322555	322555	Flora	346	' I am sure you intended no harm , and it was my leaving her that made her fretful . '

322605	322708	322578	322578	Preston	714	' Remember strict obedience and truth henceforth ; the want of them will have worse results by - and - by than even this . Now , Preston , I shall always wish you well . I ought not , I believe , to recommend you to the like place , without saying why you left me , but for any other I will give you a fair character . I will see what I can do for you , and if you are ever in any distress , I hope you will let me know . Have your wages been paid ? '
322724	322730	322718	322719	poor Preston	714	' Good - bye then , '

322810	322820	322788	322788	she	346	' Dearest Flora , it has been too much ! '
322821	322824	322826	322826	Flora	346	' No , '
322830	322852	322826	322826	Flora	346	' Poor thing , I am glad for her sake . But might she not have a book — a Bible ? '
322853	322868	322869	322869	Flora	346	' You may give her one , if you like . I could not . '

323257	323297	323254	323255	Dr. Spencer	260	' nothing can be better for both parties than that he should be away . If he were here , he ought to leave all attendance to me , and she would suffer from the sight of his distress . '
323298	323310	323312	323312	Ethel	300	' I can not think what he will do or feel ? '
323314	323336	323312	323312	Ethel	300	' Leave it to me . I will write to him , and we shall see her better before post time . '

323362	323371	323373	323374	Dr. Spencer	260	' Ho ! you do n't trust me ? '
323387	323418	323373	323374	Dr. Spencer	260	' You shall speak for yourself , and I for myself ; and I shall say that nothing would so much hurt her as to have others sacrificed to her . '

323428	323434	323426	323426	Ethel	300	' but she misses papa . '
323435	323465	323373	323374	Dr. Spencer	260	' Of course she does ; but , depend on it , she would not have him leave your sister , and she is under less restraint without him . '
323473	323474	323373	323374	Dr. Spencer	260	' '
323509	323510	323501	323501	she	6716	' '

323626	323929	323624	323624	Dick	254	' Dr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling ; and she was the better able to bear with poor Margaret 's condition of petulance . She had never before experienced the effects of bodily ailments on the temper , and she was slow to understand the change in one usually so patient and submissive . She was , by turns , displeased with her sister and with her own abruptness ; but , though she knew it not , her bluntness had a bracing effect . She thought she had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to harp on her going to London ; but it made Margaret feel that she had been unreasonable , and keep silence . Richard managed her much better , being gentle and firm , and less ready to speak than Ethel , and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep , which restored her balance , and so relieved Ethel , that she not only allowed Dr. Spencer to say what he pleased , but herself made light of the whole attack , little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame . Margaret 's whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview with Flora ; and , though she had returned to her usual state , she would not go down - stairs on the evening the party were expected , believing it would be more grateful to her sister 's feelings to meet her without witnesses . The travellers arrived , and Dr. May hurried up to her . She barely replied to his caresses and enquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora , and to convince him that he must not forbid the meeting . Nor had he any mind so to do . '
323932	323964	323624	323624	Dick	254	' said he , when he had seen the spiritualized look of her glistening blue eyes , the flush on her transparent cheeks , and her hands clasped over her breast , '
323980	324228	323967	323967	Flora	280	' Flora came , but there was sore disappointment . Fond and tender she was as ever , but , neither by word nor gesture , would she admit the most remote allusion to her grief . She withdrew her hand when Margaret 's pressure became expressive ; she avoided her eye , and spoke incessantly of indifferent subjects . All the time , her voice was low and hollow , her face had a settled expression of wretchedness , and her glances wandered drearily and restlessly anywhere but to Margaret 's face ; but her steadiness of manner was beyond her sister 's power to break , and her visit was shortened on account of her husband . Poor George had quite given way at the sight of Gertrude , whom his little girl had been thought to resemble ; and , though Dr. May had soothed him almost like a child , no one put any trust in his self - control , and all sat round , fearing each word or look , till Flora came down - stairs , and they departed . Richard and Ethel each offered to go with them ; they could not bear to think of their spending that first evening in their childless home , but Flora gently , but decidedly refused ; and Dr. May said that , much as he wished to be with them , he believed that Flora preferred having no one but Meta . '
324238	324548	324231	324231	I	0	' were Flora 's last words to him , and they seemed to explain her guarded manner ; but he found Margaret weeping as she had never wept for herself , and palpitation and faintness were the consequence . Ethel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks that ensued . There were few opportunities of being alone together , and Flora shrank from such as there were — nay , she checked all expression of solicitude , and made her very kisses rapid and formal . The sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of the usual habits there — visiting , riding , driving , dinners , and music , went on with little check . Flora was sure to be found the animated , attentive lady of the house , or else sharing her husband 's pursuits , helping him with his business , or assisting him in seeking pleasure , spending whole afternoons at the coachmaker 's , over a carriage that they were building , and , it was reported , playing ecarté in the evening . Had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any mission ? Yet Ethel could not believe that the presence of the awful messenger was unfelt , when she heard poor George 's heavy sigh , or when she looked at Flora 's countenance , and heard the peculiar low , subdued tone of her voice , which , when her words were most cheerful , always seemed to Ethel the resigned accent of despair . Ethel could not talk her over with Margaret , for all seemed to make it a point that Margaret should believe the best . Dr. May turned from the subject with a sort of shuddering grief , and said , '
324563	324855	324857	324857	Ethel	300	' Ethel , though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer , was somewhat consoled by perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up between her father and his poor daughter . If Flora had seemed , in her girlhood , to rate him almost cheaply , this was at an end now ; she met him as if his embrace were peace , the gloom was lightened , the attention less strained , when he was beside her , and she could not part with him without pressing for a speedy meeting . Yet , she treated him with the same reserve ; since that one ghastly revelation of the secrets of her heart , the veil had been closely drawn , and he could not guess whether it had been but a horrible thought , or were still an abiding impression . Ethel could gather no more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora , and that Richard understood why ; for Richard had told her that he had written to Flora , to try to persuade her to cease from this reserve , but that he had no reply . Norman was not at home ; he had undertaken the tutorship of two school - boys for the holidays ; and his father owned , with a sigh , that he was doing wisely . As to Meta , she was Ethel 's chief consolation , by the redoubled assurances , directed to Ethel 's unexpressed dread , lest Flora should be rejecting the chastening Hand . Meta had the most absolute certainty that Flora 's apparent cheerfulness was all for George 's sake , and that it was a most painful exertion . '
324886	324890	324891	324891	she	300	' Meta said , '
324903	324904	324891	324891	she	300	' '
324913	324917	324918	324918	George	672	' said Ethel . '

325148	325233	325112	325112	she	300	' slowly said Ethel , so much in her quaint way , that Meta laughed . Had it not been for Norman 's absence , Ethel would , in the warm sympathy and accustomed manner of Meta Rivers , have forgotten all about the hopes and fears that , in brighter days , had centred on that small personage ; until one day , as she came home from Cocksmoor , she found " Sir Henry Walkinghame 's " card on the drawingroom table .

325657	325977	325646	325647	Dr. Spencer	260	' said Margaret , blushing , as she always did , with pleasure , when they talked of the Church . Hector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully . She was seldom down - stairs before the evening , and Ethel thought his habit of making her apartment his sitting - room , must be as inconvenient to her , as it was to herself ; but Hector could not be de trop for Margaret . She exerted herself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that , with her brothers , had been transferred to Ethel and Mary ; she threw herself into all his schemes , tried to make him endure Captain Gordon , and she even read his favourite book of Wild Sports , though her feelings were constantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals . Her couch was to him as a home , and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been only dimmed for a time . The Church was her other great interest , and Dr. Spencer humoured her by shewing her all his drawings , consulting her on every ornament , and making many a perspective elevation , merely that she might see the effect . Richard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the Church as a present for her , and Tom developed a genius for carving , which proved a beneficial interest to keep him from surliness . He had voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father , who had been so much pleased by his choice , that he could not but be gratified ; though now and then ambitious fancies , and discontent with Stoneborough , combined to bring on his ordinary moody fits , the more , because his habitual reserve prevented anyone from knowing what was working in his mind . Finally , the Rivers '

326101	326131	326098	326099	Mr. Wilmot	277	' How it beguiles her out of her grief ! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation ; I doubt if she will see the Consecration . '

326142	326149	326137	326138	Mr. Wilmot	277	' Was that attack so serious ? '
326150	326178	326098	326099	Mr. Wilmot	277	' That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce organic disease , and suspense and sorrow have hastened it . The death of Mrs. Rivers '

Dr. Spencer 's proposal , however , took the Vicar by surprise . '

326810	326851	326609	326609	I	0	' Let him cram Norman . Young Lake tells me Norman made a great sensation at the Union at Oxford , and if his heart is in the work , he must not shrink from the face of his townsmen . '
326852	326863	326865	326866	the Vicar	8791	' No doubt , he had rather they were savages , '

326882	326888	326890	326891	Dr. Spencer	260	' With all my heart , '
326893	326954	326890	326891	Dr. Spencer	260	' When my Brahminhee Godson — the Deacon I told you of , comes to pay me his promised visit , what doings we shall have ! Seriously , I have just had letters from him and from others , that speak of such need , that I could feel every moment wasted that is not spent on their behalf . '
327404	327407	327409	327410	Dr. Spencer	260	' Yes , '
327412	327801	327409	327410	Dr. Spencer	260	' you have taken the best course for your own happiness . Norman coloured , as if he understood more than met the ear . Mary and Blanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers , and everyone was anxious to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without her father . Each of the family contributed some pretty little trifle , choice in workmanship or kind in device , and each was sealed and marked with the initials of the giver , and packed up by Mary , to be committed to Flora 's charge . Blanche had , however , much tronble in extracting a gift from Norman , and he only yielded at last , on finding that all his brothers had sent something , so that his omission would be marked . Then he dived into the recesses of his desk , and himself sealed up a little parcel , of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents . Ethel had a shrewd guess . She remembered his having , in the flush of joy at Margaret 's engagement , rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with a Daisy , and " Pearl of the meadow " as the motto ; and his having said that he should keep it as a wedding present . She could understand that he was willing to part with it without remark . Flora met Meta in her sitting room , on the morning of the day , which rose somewhat sadly upon the young girl , as she thought of past affection and new responsibilities . If the fondness of a sister could have compensated for what she had lost , Meta received it in no scanty measure from Flora , who begged to call George , because he would be pleased to see the display of gifts . His own was the only costly one — almost all the rest were homemade treasures of the greater price , because the skill and fondness of the maker were evident in their construction ; and Meta took home the kindness as it was meant , and felt the affection that would not let her feel herself lonely . She only wished to go and thank them all at once . '

Still she looked a little oppressed , as she locked up the tokens of her wealth , and the sunshine of her face did not beam out again till she arrived at Stoneborough , and was dispensing her pretty thanks to the few she found at home .

329197	329234	329120	329120	Ethel	300	' And — but then I have none of the trouble of it — I ca n't help liking the notion of sending out the Church to the island whence the Church came home to us . '

329282	329382	329280	329280	Ethel	300	' What a mess everyone will make ! O if I could but stay away , like Harry ! There will be Dr. Hoxton being sonorous and prosy , and Mr. Lake will stammer , and that will be nothing to the misery of our own people 's work . George will flounder , and look at Flora , and she will sit with her eyes on the ground , and Dr. Spencer will come out of his proper self , and be complimentary to people who deserve it no more!—And Norman — I wish I could run away !

329905	330595	330599	330599	he	6819	' meeting , a concert or a poultry shew , where rival Hamburg and Dorking uplifted their voices in the places of Mario and Grisi , all beneath the benignant portrait of Nicholas Randall , ruffed , robed , square - toed , his endowment of the scholarship in his hand , and a chequered pavement at his feet . Who knows not an S. P. G. meeting ? the gaiety of the serious , and the first public spectacle to the young , who , like Blanche and Aubrey , gaze with admiration at the rows of bonnets , and with awe at the black coats on the platform , while the relations of the said black coats suffer , like Ethel , from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best friends . Her expectations were realized by the Archdeacon 's speech , which went round in a circle , as if he could not find his way out of it . Lord Cosham was fluent , but a great many words went to very small substance ; and no wonder , thought Ethel , when all they had to propose and second was the obvious fact that Missions were very good things . Dr. Hoxton pompously , Sir Henry Walkinghame creditably , assisted the ladies and gentlemen to resolve that the S. P. G. wanted help ; Mr. Lake made a stammering , and Mr. Rivers , with his good - natured face , hearty manner , and good voice , came in well after him , with a straightforward speech , so brief , that Ethel gave Flora credit for the best she had yet heard . Mr. Wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row might , perhaps , have heard , and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing up . Ethel hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been shut . His voice was so different , when raised and pitched , so as to shew its power and sweetness ; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled , and every sentence had the most graceful turn . It was like listening to a well - written book , so smooth and so fluent , and yet so earnest — his pictures of Indian life so beautiful , and his strong affection for the converts he described now and then making his eyes fill , and his voice falter , as if losing the thread of his studied composition — a true and dignified work of art , that made Dr. May whisper to Flora , " You see what he can do . They would have given anything to have had him for a lecturer . " With half a sigh , Ethel saw Norman rise , and step forward . He began with eyes fixed on the ground , and , in a low modest tone , to speak of the islands that Harry had visited ; but gradually the poetic nature , inherent in him , gained the mastery ; and though his language was strikingly simple , in contrast with Dr. Spencer 's ornate periods , and free from all trace of " the lamp , " it rose in beauty and fervour at every sentence . The feelings that had decided his lot gave energy to his discourse , and repressed as they had been by reserve and diffidence , now flowed forth , and gave earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the highest order . After his quiet , unobtrusive beginning , there was the more wonder to find how he seemed to raise up the audience with him , in breathless attention , as to a strain of sweet music , carrying them without thought of the scene , or of the speaker , to the lovely isles , and the inhabitants of noble promise , but withering for lack of knowledge ; and finally closing his speech , when they were wrought up to the highest pitch , by an appeal that touched them all home ; '

330671	330787	330788	330789	Splendid speaker	6825	' He ceased . His father wiped his spectacles , and almost audibly murmured , " Bless him ! " Ethel , who had sat like one enchanted , forgetting who spoke , forgetting all save the islanders , half - turned , and met Richard 's smiling eyes , and his whisper—"I told you so . " The impress of a man of true genius and power had been made throughout the whole assembly ; the Archdeacon put Norman out of countenance by the thanks of the meeting , for his admirable speech , and all the world , except the Oxford men , were in a state of as much surprise as pleasure .

Margaret pitied her sisters , but heard that all was going well ; that Flora was taking care of the elders , and Harry and Mary were making the younger fry very merry at the table on the lawn . Dr. May had to start early to see a sick gardener at Drydale before coming on to Cocksmoor , and came up to give his daughter a few minutes . '

She knew him less than any of the rest , and her first amusement was , keeping silence to punish him for complaining of clack ; but he explained that he did not mean quiet , sensible conversation — he only referred to those foolish women 's raptures over the gabble they had been hearing at the Town Hall . She exclaimed , whereupon he began to criticise the speakers with a good deal of acuteness , exposing the weak points , but magnanimously owning that it was tolerable for the style of thing , and might go down at Stoneborough .

335607	335625	335627	335627	Meta—'and	747	' I do n't think uncle Cosham would object , especially hearing it while he is here , '

335648	335692	335645	335645	he	6918	' said Dr. May. A silence of perplexity ensued . Meta , brave as she was , hardly knew her uncle enough to volunteer , and Norman was privately devising , a beginning by the way of George , when Dr. May said , '
335720	335721	335717	335717	I	0	' '
335726	335748	335724	335724	you	227	' they cried both at once , feeling that he was the proper person in every way , and Norman added , '
335757	335758	335755	335755	Meta	402	' '
335769	335773	335755	335755	Meta	402	' exclaimed Meta . '
335790	335908	335784	335784	she	346	' A testimony that was welcome to Dr. May , who had once , at least , been under the impression that Flora courted Sir Henry 's attentions to her sister - in - law . Further consultation was hindered by Tom and Blanche bursting upon them from the common , both echoing Norman 's former reproach of " A pretty guide ! " and while Blanche explained the sufferings of all the assembly at their tardiness , Tom , without knowing it , elucidated what had been a mystery to the Doctor , namely , how they ever met , by his indignation at Norman 's having assumed the guidance for which he was so unfit . '
335920	335981	335913	335913	Meta	402	' said Dr. May. Still Blanche thought them not nearly sufficiently sensible of their enormities , and preached eagerly about their danger of losing standing room , when they emerged on the moor , and beheld a crowd , above whose heads rose the apex of a triangle , formed by three poles , sustaining a rope and huge stone . '
335987	335991	335984	335985	Dr. Spencer	260	' she said . '
335999	336032	335994	335994	he	260	' Whatever Dr. Spencer might have suffered , he was far too polite to scold , and a glance between the two physicians ended in a merry twinkle of his bright eyes . '
336036	336040	335994	335994	he	260	' he said , '
336046	336047	335994	335994	he	260	' '
336055	336059	336053	336053	Daisy	227	' said Dr. May. '
336075	336159	336160	336160	I	0	' He drew them on up the bank — people making way for them — till he had stationed them among the others of their own party , beside the deep trench that traced the foundation , around a space that seemed far too small . Nearly at the same moment , began the soft clear sound of chanting wafted upon the wind , then dying away — carried off by some eddying breeze , then clear , and coming nearer and nearer . '
336210	336342	336204	336208	the mighty God of Jacob	6927	' Few , who knew the history of Cocksmoor , could help glancing towards the slight girl , who stood , with bent head , her hand clasped over little Aubrey 's ; while , all that was not prayer and thanksgiving in her mind , was applying the words to him , whose head rested in the Pacific isle , while , in the place which he had chosen , was laid the foundation of the Temple that he had given unto the Lord . There came forth the procession : the Minister choristers , Dr. Spencer as architect , and , in her white dress , little Gertrude , led between Harry and Hector , Margaret 's special choice for the occasion , and followed by the Stoneborough Clergy . '
336351	336716	336717	336717	Thou	6930	' It came in well with the gentle , meek , stedfast face of the young Curate of Cocksmoor , as he moved on in his white robe , and the sun - light shone upon his fair hair , and calm brow , thankful for the past , and hoping , more than fearing , for the future . The prayers were said , and there was a pause , while Dr. Spencer and the foreman advanced to the machine and adjusted it . The two youths then led forward the little girl , her innocent face and large blue eyes wearing a look of childish obedient solemnity , only half understanding what she did , yet knowing it was something great . It was very pretty to see her in the midst of the little gathering round the foundation , the sturdy workman smiling over his hod of mortar , Dr. Spencer 's silver locks touching her flaxen curls as he held the shining trowel to her , and Harry 's bright head and hardy face , as he knelt on one knee to guide the little soft hand , while Hector stood by , still and upright , his eyes fixed far away , as if his thoughts were roaming to the real founder . The Victoria coins were placed — Gertrude scooped up the mass of mortar , and spread it about with increasing satisfaction , as it went so smoothly and easily , prolonging the operation , till Harry drew her back , while , slowly down creaked the ponderous corner - stone into the bed that she had prepared for it , and , with a good will , she gave three taps on it with her trowel . Harry had taken her hand , when , at the sight of Dr. May , she broke from him , and , as if taking sudden fright at her own unwonted part , ran , at full speed , straight up to her father , and clung to him , hiding her face as he raised her in his arms and kissed her . Meanwhile the strain arose : — '
336748	336778	336779	336779	Etheldred	540	' The blessing of peace seemed to linger softly and gently in the fragrant summer breeze , and there was a pause ere the sounds of voices awoke again . '
336781	336796	336779	336779	Etheldred	540	' Mr. Wilmot stood beside her , ere going to unrobe in the school . '
336812	336834	336806	336806	God	283	' As she knelt beside her sister 's sofa , on her return home , Margaret pressed something into her hand . '
336862	336887	336888	336888	I	0	' she whispered . Ethel recognized Alan Ernescliffe 's pearl hoop , the betrothal ring , and looked at her sister without a word . '
336892	336898	336888	336888	I	0	' said Margaret , gently . '
336908	336994	336888	336888	I	0	' So Margaret joined in Alan 's offering , and Ethel dared say no more , as she thought how the " relic of a frail love lost " was becoming the " token of endless love begun . " There was more true union in this , than in clinging to the mere tangible emblem — for broken and weak is all affection that is not knit together above in the One Infinite Love . Charles Lamb . George Rivers had an antipathy to ladies '

337464	337484	337406	337406	Tom	238	' But for fear of Norman 's losing his bearings , Harry would fetch a carrot , to compare . '

337536	337575	337576	337577	old June	236	' Norman was , like the others , in such towering glee , and took so full a share of the witticisms , that were the more noisily applauded , the worse they were , that Harry suggested that '

337691	337710	337712	337712	Norman	227	' Nay , it is the consequence of misanthropy at the detection of the frauds of sophisticated society , '
337714	337733	337689	337689	Hector	243	' Perhaps it was Miss Rivers forsaking him . Was not that rather spider - hearted , Tom ? '

338047	338067	338044	338044	she	346	' Then Norman can dress , and you must be a good child , and come down to me . '
338115	338119	338104	338104	she	346	' Poor Flora ! '
338120	338126	338104	338104	she	346	' She is so kind , '

338149	338164	338166	338166	Norman	227	' I trust to her own kindness working comfort to her , at last , '
338168	338175	338166	338166	Norman	227	' But is she often thus ? '
338176	338188	338190	338190	Meta	402	' Whenever she is not bearing up for George 's sake , '

338714	338733	338610	338610	Norman	227	' He said nothing about them ; but , of course , Dr. May must have mentioned them . '

338875	338932	338873	338873	Norman	227	' but it brought me peace , and , after the kind of dedication that I inwardly made of myself , in my time of trouble , it would take some weighty reason , amounting to a clear duty , or physical impossibility , to make me think I ought to turn back .

339065	339094	339162	339162	Norman	227	' drawing back a little , and trying to laugh off her feeling—'Only tell met at once if you think me still too much of a fine lady . '

342151	342344	342131	342131	she	7905	' Norman fared better with the uncle than he had expected . Lord Cosham , as a philanthropist , could not , with any consistency , set his face against missions , even when the cost came so near home ; and he knew that opposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that maintained them in greater force . He therefore went over the subject in a calm dispassionate manner , which exacted full and grateful consideration from the young man . The final compromise was , that nothing should be settled for a year , during which Norman would complete his course of study , and the matter might be more fully weighed . Mrs. Arnott would probably return , and bring experience and judgment , which would , or ought to , decide the question — though Meta had a secret fear that it might render it more complicated than ever . However , the engagement and the mission views had both been treated so much more favourably than could have been hoped , that they felt themselves bound to be patient and forbearing . As Meta said , '
342362	342448	342131	342131	she	7905	' Lord Cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her influence towards a decision that might be repented , when too late to be repaired , without a degrading sense of failure — putting her in mind of the privations that would lose romance by their pettiness , and which money could not remedy ; and very sensibly representing that the effect of these on temper and health was to be duly considered , as a serious impediment to usefulness . '

342691	342859	342860	342860	I	0	' Her uncle shook his head , but did not try to say any more . George had begun by loud exclamations against the project , in which he was vehemently abetted by Tom , who primed him with all sorts of outrageous abuse of the niggers and cannibals , who would make Norman 's coats out of all shape , and devour little Meta at a mouthful — predictions which Meta accepted most merrily , talking of herself so resignedly , as bound upon a spit , and calling out to be roasted slower and faster , that she safely conducted off their opposition by way of a standing joke . As to Norman 's coats , she threatened to make them herself , and silenced Tom for ever by supposing , in malicious simplicity , that he must be able to teach her the most unexceptionable cut . Flora kept her opinions to herself . Only once , when urged to remonstrate , she said , '
342868	342921	342864	342864	I	0	' She was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers , silently but unobtrusively obviating all that could jar on their feelings , and employing her exquisite tact in the kindest manner . She released Meta from the expedition to Ryde , silencing scruples on the one hand , by a suggestion of '
342926	343721	342923	342924	Sir Henry	219	' and , on the other , by offering to exchange her for Mary . The first proposal made Mary take such a spring in her chair , with eyes so round , and cheeks so red , and such a shriek about Harry and the Bucephalus , that no one could have borne to say one word in opposition , even if it had not been the opinion of the Council that sea air would best repair Mary 's strength . Ethel had some private fears of a scene , since it was one of Miss Bracy 's idiosyncracies to be hurt whenever Mary was taken out of her hands ; and she went to announce the design , in dread lest this shock should destroy the harmony that had prevailed for many months ; nay , she almost believed , since the loss of the Alcestis had been known . She was agreeably surprised . Miss Bracy thought Mary in need of the change , and discussed both her and Blanche in so pleasant and sensible a manner , that Ethel was quite relieved . She partook in Mary 's anticipations of pleasure , forwarded her preparations , and was delighted with her promise of letters — promises that Mary bestowed so largely , in the fulness of her heart , that there were fears lest her whole time should be spent in writing . Her soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all good - bye ; and Ethel and Blanche found the house was very empty without her ; but that was only till Meta came in from a walk with Norman , and , under the plea of trying to supply Mary 's place , did the work of five Maries , and a great deal besides . Nothing could be happier than Meta 's visit , brightening the house so that the Mays thought they had never known half her charms , helping whatever was going on , yet ready to play with Daisy , tell stories to Aubrey , hear Tom 's confidences , talk to Margaret , read with Norman , and teach Richard singing for his school - children . The only vexation was , that everyone could not always engross her entirely ; and Dr. May used to threaten that they should never spare her to that long - legged fellow , Norman . She had persuaded Bellairs to go and take care of Flora and Mary , instead of the French maid — a plan which greatly satisfied Margaret , who had never liked the looks of Coralie , and which Meta held to be a grand emancipation . She persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful , and Margaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in her room , where the little dextrous scholar , apparently in jest , but really in sober earnest , wiled instruction from the old woman ; and made her experiments , between smiles and blushes , and merrily glorying in results that promised that she would be a notable housewife . Whether it were novelty or not , she certainly had an aptitude and delight in domestic details , such as Ethel never could attain ; and , as Dr. May said , the one performed by a little finger what the other laboured at with a great mind . In the school - room , Meta was as highly appreciated . She found an hour for helping Blanche in her music , and for giving , what was still more useful , an interest and spirit to studies , where , it must be owned , poor good Mary had been a dead weight . She enlivened Miss Bracy so much , and so often contrived a walk or a talk with her , that the saucy Blanche told Hector that she thought Ethel would be quite second - fiddle with Miss Bracy . No such thing . Miss Bracy 's great delight was in having a listener for her enthusiasm about Miss Ethel . She had been lately having a correspondence with a former school - fellow , who was governess in a family less considerate than the Mays , and who poured out , in her letters , feelings much like those with which Miss Bracy had begun . Nothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all Ethel 's pieces of advice ; and , one day , when her friend had been more distressed than usual , she called Ethel herself , to consult on her answer , owning how much she was reminded of herself .

It was a cheering belief that , whatever the future trials of her life might be , the gentle little lady would meet them with a healthier mind , more vigorous in overlooking troubles , and without punctilious sensitiveness on the look - out for affronts . " Believing all things , bearing all things , hoping all things , enduring all things , " would be to her the true secret of serenity of spirits . Ethel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings in this difficult intercourse , but her kind heart , upright intention , and force of character , had influence far beyond her own perception . Indeed , she knew not that she had personal influence at all , but went on in her own straight - forward humility . Southey . Etheldred May and Meta Rivers were together in the drawing - room . The time - piece pointed towards ten o'clock , but the tea - things were on the table , prepared for a meal , the lamp shone with a sort of consciousness , and Ethel moved restelessly about , sometimes settling her tea equipage , sometimes putting away a stray book , or resorting by turns to her book , or to work a red and gold scroll on coarse canvas , on the other end of which Meta was employed .

344978	345047	344976	344976	Ethel	300	' unless you get yourself tattooed ! Even separation from Bellairs has n't answered . And , after all , I do n't think it would be any satisfaction to Norman , or papa . I assure you , Meta , whatever you may think of it , it is not so much bother to be prettier than needful , as it is to be uglier than needful . '
345048	345053	345055	345055	Meta	402	' What is needful ? '
345060	345118	345055	345055	Meta	402	' I suppose to be like Mary , so that nobody should take notice of one , but that one 's own people may have the satisfaction of saying , " she is pleasing , " or " she is in good looks . " I think Gertrude will come to that . That 's one comfort . '
345119	345138	344976	344976	Ethel	300	' That is your own case , Ethel . I have heard those very things said of you . '

346566	346569	346518	346518	Richard	298	' Hector ? '
346570	346588	346390	346390	she	289	' Hector Ernescliffe — poor Alan 's brother , whom we do n't well know from ourselves . '

346637	346671	346634	346635	Dr. May	238	' nearly as poor . We are to invest his patrimony in a parsonage , as soon as our architect in ordinary can find time for it . Spencer — you remember him ? '
346672	346697	346390	346390	she	289	' I remember how you and he used to be inseparable ! And he has settled down , at last , by your side ? '
346698	346739	346634	346635	Dr. May	238	' The two old Doctors hope to bolster each other up till Mr. Tom comes down with modern science in full force . That boy will do great things — he has as clear a head as I ever knew . '
346740	346744	346746	346746	Ethel	750	' And more — '
346748	346810	346746	346746	Ethel	750	' Aye , as sound a heart . I must find you his tutor 's letter , Flora . They have had a row in his tutor 's house at Eton , and our boys made a gallant stand for the right , Tom especially , guarding the little fellows , in a way that does one good to hear of . '
346811	346832	346834	346834	Meta	402	' " I must express my strong sense of gratitude for his truth , uprightness , and moral courage , " '
346836	346865	346834	346834	Meta	402	' Ah , ha ! you have learnt it by heart ! I know you copied it out for Norman , who has the best right to rejoice . '
346866	346880	346882	346883	Mrs. Arnott	289	' You have a set of children to be proud of , Richard ! '

347596	347615	347552	347552	she	402	' Thank you , Ethel ; perhaps you are right . When does he think of coming out ? '

347628	347635	347552	347552	she	402	' Does she live with you ? '
347636	347657	347552	347552	she	402	' I suppose she lives with Flora ; but we always manage to get her when Norman is at home . '

347670	347702	347704	347704	Ethel	750	' I have little real to tell . Good old Mary ! I dare say Harry talked to you plentifully of her . She is a — a nice old darling , '
347708	347733	347704	347704	Ethel	750	' We want her again very much , and did not quite bargain for the succession of smart visits that she has been paying . '

347739	347763	347764	347764	Ethel	750	' Yes . Unluckily George Rivers has taken an aversion to the Grange , and I have not seen Flora this whole year . '
347889	347905	347906	347907	Mrs. Arnott	289	' Auntie ! dear auntie ! that you should have come back to me again ! '

348057	348070	348072	348073	Mrs. Arnott	289	' I am so glad to have come in for the Consecration ! '
348081	348090	348072	348073	Mrs. Arnott	289	' Is that a model of the Church ? '
348091	348096	348098	348098	Margaret	249	' Oh ! yes , '
348103	348110	348098	348098	Margaret	249	' Richard made it for me . '
348111	348120	348122	348122	Aubrey	594	' May I shew it to aunt Flora ? '
348124	348135	348137	348137	Margaret	249	' Bring it here , if you can lift it , '
348253	348265	348246	348247	Mrs. Arnott	289	' Why , my dear , when have you seen it ? '
348266	348269	348271	348271	Margaret	249	' Never , '
348278	348318	348271	348271	Margaret	249	' I have never seen Cocksmoor ; but Dr. Spencer and Meta are always sketching it for me , and Ethel would not let an effect pass without telling me . I shall hear how it strikes you next . '
348319	348349	348246	348247	Mrs. Arnott	289	' I hope to see it by - and - by . What a comfortable deep porch ! If we could build such Churches in the Colonies , Margaret ! '
348350	348459	348271	348271	Margaret	249	' See what little Meta will do for you ! Yes , we had the porch deep for a shelter — that is copied from the west - door of the Minster , and is it not a fine high - pitched roof ? John Taylor , who is to be clerk , could not understand its being open ; he said , when he saw the timbers , that a man and his family might live up among them . They are noble oak beams ; we would not have any sham — here Aubrey , take off the roof , and auntie will see the shape . '
348460	348468	348470	348470	Aubrey	594	' Like the ribs of a ship , '
348488	348525	348485	348485	he	594	' Such fine oak beams ! I rode with Dr. Spencer one day last year to choose them . It is a two - aisled Church , you see , that a third may be added . '
348537	348542	348543	348543	she	750	' Lessons , Aubrey , '
348546	348558	348543	348543	she	750	' So , Margaret , you are over your dear model ? '
348559	348572	348574	348574	Margaret	249	' Not forestalling you too much I hope , Ethel , dear , '
348576	348586	348574	348574	Margaret	249	' as you will shew her the Church itself . '
348587	348594	348596	348596	Ethel	750	' You have the best right , '
348598	348609	348596	348596	Ethel	750	' but come , Aubrey , we must not dawdle . '
348610	348624	348626	348626	Aubrey	594	' I will shew you the stones I laid myself , aunt Flora , '
348634	348642	348644	348645	Mrs. Arnott	289	' Ethel has him in excellent order , '
348647	348715	348644	348645	Mrs. Arnott	289	' That she has ; she brings him on beautifully , and makes him enjoy it . She teaches him arithmetic in some wonderful scientific way that nobody can understand but Norman , and he not the details ; but he says it is all coming right , and will make him a capital mathematical scholar , though he can not add up pounds shillings and pence . '
348724	348729	348722	348722	Ethel	750	' said Mrs. Arnott ; '
348732	348733	348722	348722	Ethel	750	' '
348736	348742	348722	348722	Ethel	750	' said Margaret , waiting . '

349049	349054	349057	349058	Mr. Wilmot	277	' said Mrs. Arnott . '

349206	349249	349250	349250	He	7391	' said Margaret , very low ; and her aunt abstained from remark , though unable to look , without tears , at the ship of the Apostles , the calming of the storm , and the scroll , with the verse — '
349261	349267	349250	349250	He	7391	' Beneath were the initials , '
349272	349302	349250	349250	He	7391	' and the date of the year , the only memorials of the founder . Margaret next drew attention to St. Andrew with his Cross — Meta 's gift . '
349307	349311	349312	349313	George Rivers	255	' she said , '
349405	349469	349399	349399	You	7125	' Thus Margaret proceeded with the description of everything in the Church , and all the little adventures of the building , as if she could not turn away from the subject ; and her aunt listened and wondered , and , when called away , that Margaret might rest before nurse came to dress her , she expressed her wonder to Meta . '
349472	349477	349399	349399	You	7125	' was the answer ; '
349618	350829	349604	349605	Miss May	300	' Mrs. Arnott saw that Meta was right , when , in the afternoon , she walked , with her nieces , to see Cocksmoor . It was not a desolate sight as in old times , for the fair edifice , rising on the slope , gave an air of protection to the cottages , which - seemed now to have a centre of unity , instead of lying forlorn and scattered . Nor were they as wretched in themselves , for the impulse of civilization had caused windows to be mended and railings to be tidied , and Richard promoted , to the utmost , cottage gardening , so that , though there was an air of poverty , there was no longer an appearance of reckless destitution and hopeless neglect . In the cottages , Mrs. Taylor had not entirely ceased to speak with a piteous voice , even though she told of the well - doing of her girls at service ; but Granny Hall 's merry content had in it something now of principle , and Sam had married a young Fordholm wife , who promised to be a pattern for Cocksmoor . Everyone asked after Miss May , with a tenderness and affection that Mrs. Arnott well appreciated ; and when they went into the large fresh school , where Richard was hearing a class , Cherry Elwood looked quite cheered and enlivened by hearing that she had been able to enjoy seeing her aunt . Mrs. Arnott was set to enlighten the children about the little brown girls whom she was wo nt to teach , and came away with a more brilliant impression of their intelligence than she might have had , if she had not come to them fresh from the Antipodes . She had to tell Margaret all her impressions on her return , and very pretty smiles repaid her commendations . She understood better the constant dwelling on the subject , as she perceived how little capable Margaret was of any employment . The book , the writing materials , and work - basket were indeed placed by her side , but very seldom did the feeble fingers engage in any of the occupations once so familiar — now and then a pencilled note would be sent to Flora , or to Hector Ernescliffe , or a few stitches be set in her work , or a page or two turned of a book , but she was far more often perfectly still , living , assuredly in no ordinary sphere of human life , but never otherwise than cheerful , and open to the various tidings and interests which , as Ethel had formerly said , shifted before her like scenes in a magic lantern , and , perhaps , with less of substance than in those earlier days , when her work among them was not yet done , and she was not , as it were , set aside from them . They were now little more than shadows reflected from the world whence she was passing . Yet her home was not sad . When Dr. Spencer came in the evening , and old Edinburgh stories were discussed , Dr. May talked with spirit , and laughed with the merry note that Mrs. Arnott so well remembered , and Meta Rivers chimed in with her gay , saucy repartees , nor , though Richard was always silent , and Ethel 's brow seemed to bear a weight of thought , did it seem as if their spirits were depressed ; while there was certainly no restraint on the glee of Blanche , Aubrey , and Gertrude , who were running into Margaret 's room , and making as much noise there as they chose . Mrs. Arnott was at home with the whole family from the first , and in everyone 's confidence ; but what she enjoyed above all was , the sitting in Margaret 's room in the morning , when there was no danger of interruption , the three children being all safe captives to their lessons , and Meta , in Richard 's workshop , illuminating texts on zinc scrolls for the Church . Margaret came out more in these interviews . It had been a kind of shyness that made her talk so exclusively of the Church at the first meeting ; she had now felt her way , and knew again — and realized — the same kind aunt with whom she had parted in her childhood , and now far dearer , since she herself was better able to appreciate her , and with a certain resemblance to her mother , that was unspeakably precious and soothing to one deprived , as Margaret had been , at the commencement of her illness and anxiety . She could hardly see her aunt come near her , without thanking her for having come home , and saying how every time she awoke , it was with the sense that something was comfortable , then remembering it was aunt Flora 's being in the house . She seemed to have a feeling , as if telling everything to her aunt were like rendering up her account to her mother , and , at different times , she related the whole , looking back on the various decisions she had had to make or to influence , and reviewing her own judgments , though often with self - blame , not with acuteness of distress , but rather with a humble trust in the Infinite Mercy that would atone for all shortcomings and infirmities , truly sorrowed for . On the whole it was a peaceful and grateful retrospect ; the brothers all doing so well in their several ways , and such a comfort to their father . Tom , concerning whom she had made the greatest mistake , might be looked upon as rescued by Norman . Aubrey , Margaret said , smiling , was Ethel 's child , and had long been off her mind ; Hector , to her quite a brother , would miss her almost more than her own brothers , but good honest fellow , he had a home here ; and , whispered Margaret , smiling and glowing a little , " do n't tell anyone , for it is a secret of secrets . Hector told me one evening that , if he could be very steady , he hoped he might yet have Blanche at Maplewood . Poor little White Mayflower , it wo n't be for want of liking on her part , and she so blushes and watches when Hector comes near , that I sometimes think he may have said something like it to her . " Mrs. Arnott gave no opinion on the plan for Norman and Meta ; but Margaret , however , took all for granted , and expressed warm hopes for their sakes , that they would go out with Mrs. Arnott ; then , when the suggestion seemed to astonish her aunt , who thought they were waiting for his Ordination , she said , '
350909	350980	350901	350901	you	280	' As to her father , Margaret was at rest . He had much more calmness than when he was more new to grief , and could bear far more patiently and hopefully than at first . He lived more on his affections above , and much as he loved those below , he did not rest in them as once , and could better afford to have them removed . '
350983	350989	350901	350901	you	280	' said Margaret , serenely , '
351018	351405	351010	351010	Ethel	300	' For herself , Margaret was perfectly content and happy . She knew the temptation of her character had been to be the ruler and manager of everything , and she saw it had been well for her to have been thus assigned the part of Mary , rather than of Martha . She remembered with thankful joy the engagement with Alan Ernescliffe , and though she still wore tokens of mourning for him , it was with a kind of pleasure in them . There had been so little promise of happiness from the first , that there was far more peace in thinking of him as sinking into rest in Harry 's arms , than as returning to grieve over her decline ; and that last gift of his , the Church , had afforded her continual delight , and above all other earthly pursuits , smoothed away the languor and weariness of disease , as she slowly sank to join him . Now that her aunt had come to bring back a sunbeam of her childhood , Margaret declared that she had no more grief or care , except one , and that a very deep and sad one — namely , poor Flora . Mrs. Arnott had at first been inclined to fear that her goddaughter was neglecting her own family , since she had not been at home this whole year , but the slightest betrayal of this suspicion roused Margaret to an eager defence . She had not a doubt that Flora would gladly have been with her , but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice , or more truly , that her husband was so devoted to her , that she felt the more bound to follow his slightest wishes , however contrary to her own . The season had been spent in the same whirl that had , last year , been almost beyond human power , even when stimulated by enjoyment and success ; and now , when her spirits were lowered , and her health weakened , Meta had watched and trembled for her , though never able to obtain an avowal that it was an overstrain , and while treated most affectionately , never admitted within her barrier of reserve . '
351427	351433	351417	351417	she	280	' Margaret said , sighing , '
351439	351574	351417	351417	she	280	' The Consecration day came near , and the travellers began to return . Meta was in a state of restlessness , which in her was very pretty , under the disguise of a great desire to be useful . She fluttered about the house , visited Margaret , played with Gertrude , set the drawing - room ornaments to rights — a task which Ethel was very glad to depute to her , and made a great many expeditions into the garden to put together autumn nosegays for the vases — finally discovering that Ethel 's potichomanie vases on the staircase window , must have some red and brown leaves . She did not come back quite so soon with them , and Mrs. Arnott , slyly looking out of window , reported , '

352836	352866	352824	352824	Ethel	750	' said Meta . And , certainly , to be wife to a Member of Parliament , is not so very delightful that one would covet it for her . '
352867	352876	352877	352877	Norman	548	' Any more than she does for herself . '
353316	353988	354031	354031	you	346	' O , it is so nice to be at home again!'—and Ethel knew she had her own Mary . It was only a much better looking and more mannerly Mary , in the full bloom of seventeen , open and honest - faced , her profuse light hair prettily disposed , her hands and arms more civilized , and her powers of conversation and self - possession developed . Mary - like were her caresses of Gertrude , Mary - like her inquiries for Cocksmoor , Mary - like her insisting on bringing her boxes into Margaret 's room , her exulting exhibition of all the pretty things that Flora and George had given to her , and the still more joyous bestowal of presents upon everybody . Her tastes were not a whit altered , nor her simplicity diminished . If she was pleased by joining a large dinner - party , her satisfaction was in the amusement of seeing well - dressed people , and a grand table ; her knowledge of the world only reached to pronouncing everything unlike home , " so funny ; " she had relished most freshly and innocently every pleasure that she could understand , she had learnt every variety of fancy work to teach Blanche and Miss Bracy , had been the delight of every school - room and nursery , had struck up numberless eternal friendships and correspondences with girls younger and shyer than herself , and her chief vexations seemed to have been first , that Flora insisted on her being called Miss May , secondly , that all her delights could not be shared by everyone at home , and thirdly , that poor Flora could not bear to look at little children . Grievous complaints were preferred by the dwellers in the attics the next morning , that Mary and Blanche had talked to an unmentionable hour of the night ; but , on the whole , Blanche was rather doubtful whether Mary had made the most of her opportunities of observation . Ancient Hymn for the Dedication of a Church . The thirtieth of November dawned with the grave brightness of an autumn day , as the sun slowly mounted from the golden east , drinking up the mists that rose tardily , leaving the grass thickly bedewed . The bells of Stoneborough Minster were ringing gladsome peals , and the sunshine had newly touched the lime trees , whose last bright yellow leaves were gently floating down , as the carriage , from the Grange , drew up at Dr. May 's door . Norman opened it , to claim Meta at once for the walk ; Mrs. Arnott and Mary had gone on to assist Richard in his final arrangements , but even before Cocksmoor , with Ethel , was now the care of Margaret ; and she had waited with her father to keep all bustle from her room , and to commit her into the charge of Flora and of nurse . Ethel seemed quite unwilling to go . There was that strange oppressed feeling on her as if the attainment of her wishes were joy too great to be real — as if she would fain hold off from it at the climax , and linger with the sister who had shared all with her , and to whom that Church was even more than to herself . She came back , and back again , with fresh injunctions , sometimes forgetting the very purpose of her return , as if it had been only an excuse for looking at Margaret 's countenance , and drinking in her sympathy from her face ; but she was to go in George 's carriage , and he was not a man to allow of loitering . He became so impatient of Ethel 's delays , that she perceived that he could bear them no longer , gave her final kiss , and whispered , '
353994	354021	354022	354022	Flora	346	' then ran down and was siezed on by George , who had already packed in the children and Miss Bracy , and was whirled away . '
354025	354029	354022	354022	Flora	346	' said Margaret , '
354038	354060	354061	354061	You	346	' Flora threw it up , protesting , in reply to her sister 's scruples , that she liked the air . '
354066	354072	354061	354061	You	346	' said Margaret , fondly . '
354089	354106	354086	354086	you	346	' she added , as Flora complied ; and she took her hand and fondled it . '
354122	354123	354115	354115	you	346	' '
354131	354135	354115	354115	you	346	' said Flora . '
354147	354151	354167	354167	Flora	346	' said Margaret , '
354177	354262	354174	354174	mamma	7395	' and she looked in her sister 's face as she spoke . Flora did not reply , but she lay quite still , as if there were a charm in the perfect rest of being alone with Margaret , making no effort , and being able to be silent . Time passed on , how long they knew not , but , suddenly , a thrill shot through Margaret 's frame ; she raised her hand and lifted her head , with an eager '
354265	354271	354275	354275	his	7203	' Flora could hear nothing . '
354278	354340	354275	354275	his	7203	' said Margaret , all one radiant look of listening , as Flora opened the window further , and the breeze wafted in the chime , softened by distance . The carnation tinted those thin white cheeks , eyes and smile beamed with joy , and uplifted finger and parted lips seemed marking every note of the cadence . It ceased . '
354345	354349	354343	354343	Alan	750	' said she . '
354358	354386	354354	354354	I	0	' The somewhat alarmed look on Flora 's face recalled her , and , smiling , she held out her hand for the Consecration books , saying , '
354401	354591	354592	354592	Margaret	249	' Slowly , softly , and rather monotonously , Flora read on , till she had come more than half through the first Lesson . Her voice grew husky , and she sometimes paused as if she could not easily proceed . Margaret begged her to stop , but she would not cease , and went on reading , though almost whispering , till she came to , " If they return to Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land , which Thou gavest unto their fathers , and toward the City which Thou hast chosen , and toward the House which I have built for Thy Name ; then hear Thou from the Heavens , even from Thy dwelling - place — " Flora could go no further ; she strove , but one of her tearless sobs cut her short . She turned her face aside , and , as Margaret began to say something tender , she exclaimed , with low , hasty utterance , '
354639	354640	354642	354642	Flora	346	' '
354700	355336	354694	354694	I	0	' The words had burst from Flora uncontrollably . She was aware , the next instant , that she had given way to harmful agitation , and , resuming her quiescence , partly by her own will , partly from the soothing effect of Margaret 's words and tone , she allowed herself to be drawn close to her sister , and hid her face in the pillow , while Margaret 's hands were folded over her , and words of blessing and prayer were whispered with a fervency that made them broken . Ethel , meanwhile , stood between Aubrey and Gertrude , hardly able to believe it was not a dream , as she beheld the procession enter the Aisle , and heard the Psalm that called on those doors to lift up their heads for Him who should enter . There was an almost bewildered feeling — could it indeed be true , as she followed the earlier part of the service , which set apart that building as a Temple for ever , separate from all common uses . She had imagined the scene so often that she could almost have supposed the present , one of her many imaginations ; but , by - and - by , the strangeness passed off , and she was able to enter into , not merely to follow , the prayers , and to feel the deep thanksgiving that such had been the crown of her feeble efforts . Margaret was in her mind the whole time , woven , as it were , into every supplication and every note of praise ; and when there came the intercession for those in sickness and suffering , flowing into the commemoration of those departed in faith and fear , Ethel 's spirit sank for a moment at the conviction , that soon Margaret , like him , whom all must bear in mind on that day , might be included in that thanksgiving ; yet , as the service proceeded , leaving more and more of earth behind , and the voices joined with Angel and Archangel , Ethel could lose the present grief , and only retain the certainty that , come what might , there was joy and union amid those who sung that Hymn of praise . Never had Ethel been so happy — not in the sense of the finished work — no , she had lost all that , but in being more carried out of herself than ever she had been before , the free spirit of praise so bearing up her heart that the cry of Glory came from her with such an exulting gladness , as might surely be reckoned as one of those foretastes of our Everlasting Life , not often vouchsafed even to the faithful , and usually sent to prepare strength for what may be in store . The blessing brought the sense of peace , which hung on her even while the sounds of movement began , and the congregation were emerging . As she came out , greetings , sentences of admiration of the Church , and of enquiry for her absent sisters , were crowded upon her , as people moved towards the school , where a luncheon was provided for them , to pass away the interval until evening service . The half - dozen oldest Cocksmoorites were , meantime , to have a dinner in the former school - room , at the Elwood 's house , and Ethel was anxious to see that all was right there , so , while the rest of her party were doing civil things , she gave her arm to Cherry , whose limping walk shewed her to be very tired . '
355342	355346	355339	355340	Miss Ethel	300	' said Cherry , '
355356	355357	355348	355349	Miss May	300	' '
355362	355366	355358	355358	Her	300	' said Ethel . '
355413	355414	355401	355402	Miss May	300	' '
355429	355659	355415	355415	She	300	' said Ethel . More might have been said , but they perceived that they were being overtaken by the body of Clergy , who had been unrobing in the vestry . Ethel hastened to retreat within Mrs. Elwood 's wicket gate , but she was arrested by Richard , and found herself being presented to the Bishop , and the Bishop shaking hands with her , and saying that he had much wished to be introduced to her . Of course , that was because she was her father 's daughter , and by way of - something to say . She mentioned what was going on at the cottage , whereupon the Bishop wished to go in and see the old people ; and , entering , they found the very comfortable - looking party just sitting down to roast - beef and goose . John Taylor , in a new black coat , on account of his Clerkship , presiding at one end , and Mr. Elwood at the other , and Dame Hall finding conversation for the whole assembly ; while Blanche , Aubrey , Gertrude , the little Larkinses , and the Abbotstoke Wilmots were ready to act as waiters with infinite delight . Not a whit daunted by the Bishop , who was much entertained by her merry manner , old Granny told him '
355734	355827	355828	355828	Ethel	300	' The Bishop said Grace , and left Granny to the goose , while he gave Ethel his arm , which she would have thought an unaccountable proceeding if she had not recollected that Richard might be considered as host , and that she was his eldest sister forthcoming . No sooner , however , had they come beyond the wicket than she saw her father speaking to Will Adams , and there was that in the air of both which made it no surprise when Dr. May came up , saying , '
355836	355845	355830	355830	I	0	' and , in explanation to the Bishop , '
355856	356448	355846	355850	my poor girl at home	7218	' All was enquiry and sympathy . Ethel was frantic to be at home , and would have rushed off at once , if Richard had not held her fast , asking what good she would do by hurrying in , breathless and exhausted , so as to add to Flora 's fright and distress , the anxiety which was most upon their minds , since she had never before witnessed one of the seizures , that were only too ordinary matters in the eyes of the home party . No one but Dr. May and Ethel should go . Richard undertook to tell the rest , and the gig making its appearance , Ethel felt that the peculiarly kind manner with which the Bishop pressed her hand , and gave them all good wishes , was like a continuation of his blessing to aid her , in her home scene of trial . Perhaps , it was well for her that her part in the Consecration festivities should end here ; at least so thought Mr. Wilmot , who , though very sorry for the cause , could not wish her to have been present at the luncheon . She had not thought of self hitherto , the Church was the gift of Alan and Margaret , the work of preparing the people belonged to all alike , and she did not guess that , in the sight of others , she was not the nobody that she believed herself . Her share in the work at Cocksmoor was pretty well known , and Dr. Hoxton could not allow a public occasion to pass without speeches , such as must either have been very painful , or very hurtful to her . The absence of herself and her father , however , permitted a more free utterance to the general feeling ; and things were said , that did indeed make the rest of the family extremely hot and uncomfortable , but which gave them extreme pleasure . Norman was obliged to spare Richard the answer , and said exactly what he ought , and so beautifully , that Meta could not find it in her heart to echo the fervent wish , which he whispered as he sat down , that speechifying could be abolished by act of parliament . Mrs. Arnott began to perceive that her nephew was something to be proud of , and to understand how much was sacrificed , while George Rivers expressed his opinion to her that Norman would be a crack speaker in the House , and he hoped she would say everything to hinder his going out , for it was a regular shame to waste him on the niggers . Owing to George having constituted himself her squire , Mrs. Arnott had not arrived at an understanding of the state of affairs at home ; but , as soon they rose up from luncheon , and she learnt the truth from Richard and Mary , nothing would hinder her from walking home at once to see whether she could be useful . Mary was easily persuaded to remain , for she was accustomed to Margaret 's having these attacks , and had always been kept out of her room the while , so she had little uneasiness to prevent her from being very happy , in receiving in her own simple , good - humoured way , all the attentions that lapsed upon her in the place of her elder sisters . '
356455	356778	355846	355850	my poor girl at home	7218	' was note enough of joy for her , and no one could look at her round face without seeing perfect happiness . Moreover , when after evening service , the November mist turned into decided rain , she was as happy as a queen in her foresight , which had provided what seemed an unlimited supply of cloaks and umbrellas . She appeared to have an original genius for making the right people give a lift in their carriages to the distressed ; and , regarding the Abbotstoke britska as her own , packed in Mrs. Anderson and Fanny , in addition to all their own little ones , Meta thrusting Miss Bracy into the demi - corner destined for herself at the last minute , and , remaining with Mary , the only ladies obliged to walk back to Stoneborough . So delighted were they " at the fun , " that it might have been thought the most charming of adventures , and they laughed all the more at the lack of umbrellas . They went to Mrs. Elwood 's , divested themselves of all possible finery , and tucked up the rest ; Meta was rolled up from head to foot in a great old plaid shawl of Mrs. Elwood 's , and Mary had a cloak of Richard 's , the one took Norman 's arm , the other Dr. Spencer 's , and they trudged home through the darkness and the mud in the highest glee , quite sorry when the carriage met them half - way . It was the last mirth that they enjoyed for many weeks . When they reached home , a sense of self - reproach for their glee thrilled over them , when they found a sort of hush pervading the drawing - room , and saw the faces of awe and consternation , worn by Blanche and George Rivers . '
356795	357040	355846	355850	my poor girl at home	7218	' was all that Blanche knew , but her father had desired to be told when Dr. Spencer came home , and she went up with the tidings . This brought Flora down , looking dreadfully pale , and with her voice sunk away as it had been when she lost her child . Her husband started up , exclaiming at her aspect ; she let him support her to the sofa , and gave the few particulars . Margaret had been as placid and comfortable as usual , till nurse came to dress her , but the first move had brought on the faintness and loss of breath . It did not yield to remedies , and she had neither looked nor spoken since , only moaned . Flora thought her father much alarmed ; and then , after an interval , she began to entreat that they might stay there , sending Miss Bracy and the children to the Grange to make room . Meantime , Dr. Spencer had come to the sick room , but he could only suggest remedies that were already in course of application to the insensible sufferer . Mrs. Arnott and Ethel were watching , and trying everything to relieve her , but with little effect , and Ethel presently stood by the fire with her father , as Dr. Spencer turned towards him , and he said , in a very low , but calm voice , '
357055	357056	357046	357046	I	0	' '
357060	357065	357046	357046	I	0	' said Dr. Spencer . '
357068	357110	357046	357046	I	0	' said Dr. May ; and he quietly spoke of what the disease had effected , and what yet remained for it to do , ere the silver bowl should be broken . Dr. Spencer put in a word of agreement . '
357117	357126	357046	357046	I	0	' said Ethel , in the same tone . '
357130	357135	357046	357046	I	0	' said Dr. May ; '
357189	357204	357205	357205	I	0	' Dr. Spencer bowed his head , and looked at him anxiously , saying , '
357216	357217	357218	357218	I	0	' '
357226	357246	357218	357218	I	0	' said Dr. May , sighing ; and then turning to Ethel , and throwing his arm round her , '
357278	357412	357413	357413	I	0	' Ethel clung to him , as if to derive strength from him . But the strength that was in them then , did not come from earth . Dr. Spencer wrung his hand , and stepped back to the bed to try another resource . Vain again , they only seemed to be tormenting her , and the silent helplessness prevailed again . Then Dr. May went down to Flora , told her the true state of the case , and urged on her to give up her plan of remaining . George joined with him , and she yielded submissively , but would not be refused going up once again and kissing her sister , standing beside her gazing at her , till her father came softly and drew her away . '
357421	358045	357413	357413	I	0	' she said to Ethel , and went . The morrow , however , brought no Flora . The agitation and distress of thst day had broken her down completely , and she was so ill as to be unable to move . Her aunt went at once to see her , and finding that her presence at the Grange relieved some of Dr. May 's anxieties , chiefly devoted herself to her . Flora was grateful and gentle , but as silent and impenetrable as ever , while day after day she lay on her couch , uncomplaining and undemonstrative , visited by her father , and watched over by her aunt and sister - in - law , who began to know each other much better , though Flora less than ever , in that deep fixed grief . She only roused herself to return her husband 's affection , or to listen to the daily reports of Margaret . Poor George , he was very forlorn , thugh Meta did her best to wait on him , and he rode over twice a day to inquire at Stoneborough . The Doctors were right , and the Consecration morning was her last of full consciousness . From the hour when she had heard the sound of Alan 's bells , her ears were closed to earthly sounds . There was very little power of intercourse with her , as she lingered on the borders of the Land very far away , where skill and tenderness could not either reach body or spirit . Often the watchers could not tell whether she was conscious , or only incapacitated from expression , by the fearful weight on her breath , which caused a restlessness most piteous in the exhausted helpless frame , wasted till the softest touch was anguish . Now and then came precious gleams when a familiar voice , or some momentary alleviation would gain a smile , or thanks , and they thought her less restless when Richard read prayers beside her , but words were very rare , only now and then a name , and when in most distress , " it will be soon over , " " it will soon be over , " occurred so often , that they began to think it once her solace , and now repeated habitually without a meaning . They could not follow her into the valley of the shadow of death , but could only watch the frail earthly prison - house being broken down , as if the doom of sin must be borne , though faith could trust that it was but her full share in the Cross . Calmly did those days pass . Ethel , Richard , and Mary divided between them the watching and the household cares , and their father bore up bravely in the fullness of his love and faith , resigning his daughter to the Hands which were bearing her whither her joys had long since departed . Hector Ernescliffe arrived when the holidays began ; and his agony of sorrow , when she failed to recognise him , moved Dr. May to exert himself earnestly for his consolation ; and , at the same time , Tom , in a gentle , almost humble manner , paid a sort of daughter - like attention to the smallest services for his father , as if already accepting him as his especial charge . It was midnight , on the longest night of the year ; Ethel was lying on her bed , and had fallen into a brief slumber , when her father 's low , clear voice summoned her : '
358052	358086	358087	358087	Papa	218	' There was a change on the face , and the breath came in labouring gasps . Richard lifted her head , and her eyes once more opened ; she smiled once more . '
358089	358093	358094	358095	dear papa	1125	' she said , '
358097	358113	358094	358095	dear papa	1125	' He threw himself on his knees beside her , but she looked beyond him , '
358128	358156	358094	358095	dear papa	1125	' and , as though the unspeakable dawned on her , she gasped for utterance , then looked , with a consoling smile , on her father . '
358160	358189	358094	358095	dear papa	1125	' she said — and the last struggle was ended . That which Richard laid down was no longer Margaret May. Over now ! The twenty - five years '
358195	358605	358606	358606	I	0	' captivity on her couch , the anxious headship of the motherless household , the hopeless betrothal , the long suspense , the efforts for resignation , the widowed affections , the slow decay , the tardy , painful death agony — all was over ; nothing left , save what they had rendered the undying spirit , and the impress her example had left on those around her . The long continuance of the last suffering had softened the actual parting ; and it was with thankfulness for the cessation of her pain that they turned away , and bade each other good - night . Ethel would not have believed that her first wakening , to the knowledge that Margaret was gone , could have been more fraught with relief than with misery . And , for her father , it seemed as if it were a home - like , comfortable thought to him , that her mother had one of her children with her . He called her the first link of his Daisy Chain drawn up out of sight ; and , during the quiet days that ensued , he seemed as it were to be lifted above grief , dwelling upon hope . His calmness impressed the same on his children , as they moved about in the solemn stillness of the house ; and when Harry , pale , and shocked at the blow to him so sudden , came home , the grave silence soothed his violence of grief ; and he sat beside his father or Mary , speaking in under - tones of what Margaret had loved to hear from him , of Alan Ernescliffe 's last moments . Mary gave way to a burst of weeping when she sought , in vain , for Daisies in the wintry garden ; but Hector Ernescliffe went down to the Cloisters , and brought back the lingering blossoms to be placed on Margaret 's bosom . The dog Toby had followed him , unseen , to the cloister ; and he was entering the garden , when he was struck by seeing the animal bounding , in irrepressible ecstacy , round a lad , whose tarpaulin hat , blue bordered collar , and dark blue dress , shewed him to be a sailor , as well as the broad - shouldered , grizzled , elderly man , who stood beside him .

358611	358625	358627	358627	you	7572	' said the latter , as Hector 's hand was on the door , '
358633	358641	358630	358631	Dr. May	238	' Hector unhesitatingly answered that he did . '
358657	358687	358653	358655	one Bill Jennings	770	' Hector was all in one flush , almost choking , as he told that he was Mr. Ernescliffe 's brother , and gave his hand to the sailor . '
358695	358984	358690	358690	he	770	' Jennings had heard from one of the crew of the Bucephalus that Mr. May had been met , on his return to Portsmouth , by the news of his sister 's death . The Mays had helped his boy ; he had been with Mr. May in the island ; he had laid Mr. Ernescliffe in his grave ; and some notion had crossed the sailor that he must be at Miss Margaret 's funeral — it might be they would let him lend a hand — and , in this expedition , he was spending his time on shore . How he was welcomed need not be told , nor how the tears came forth from full hearts , as Dr. May granted his wish , and thanked him for doing what Margaret herself would indeed have chosen ; and , in his blue sailor garb , was Jennings added to the bearers , their own men , and two Cocksmoor labourers , who , early on Christmas Eve , carried her to the Minster . Last time she had been there , Alan Ernescliffe had supported her . Now , what was mortal of him lay beneath the palm tree , beneath the glowing summer sky , while the first snow flakes hung like pearls on her pall . But , as they laid her by her mother 's side , who could doubt that they were together ? George Herbert . Late in the evening of the same snowy 24th of December , a little daughter awoke to life at Abbotstoke Grange , and , not long after , Mrs. Arnott came to summon Dr. May from the anxious vigil in the sitting room . '
358997	359005	358989	358989	you	7228	' she said , with much alarm . '
359033	359135	358989	358989	you	7228	' It was so , when he came to her bedside ; that fixed stony look of despair was gone ; the source of tears , so long dried up , had opened again ; and there she lay , weeping quietly indeed , but profusely , and with deep heaving sobs . To speak , or to leave her alone , seemed equally perilous , but he chose the first — he kissed and blessed her , and gave her joy . She looked up at him as if his blessing once more brought peace , and said , faintly , '
359146	359147	359142	359142	I	0	' '
359159	359166	359142	359142	I	0	' said Dr. May , fervently . '

359199	359203	359192	359192	I	0	' said Flora . '

359237	359242	359218	359218	Margaret	249	' said her father ; '
359275	359356	359359	359359	she	750	' He would have taken the infant from the nurse and held her to her mother , but , recollecting how little Leonora had drawn her last breath in his arms , he feared the association , and signed to Mrs. Arnott to shew her the child ; but she seemed as yet only able to feel that it was not Leonora , and the long sealed - up grief would have its way . The tears burst out again . '
359386	359446	359451	359451	Flora	346	' she said , with such passionate caresses , that Mrs. Arnott was glad to take the babe away . Dr. May 's next expedient was to speak to her of her husband , who needed her more than all , and to call him in . There seemed to be something tranquillizing in his wistful manner of repeating , '
359453	360133	359451	359451	Flora	346	' and she was at last reduced , by her extreme exhaustion , to stillness ; but there were still many fears for her . Dr. May 's prediction was accomplished — that she would suffer for having over - exerted herself . Her constitution had been severely tried by the grief and despondency that she had so long endured in silence , and the fresh sorrow for her favorite sister , coming at such a crisis . There was a weariness of life , and an unwillingness to resume her ordinary routine , that made her almost welcome her weakness and sinking ; and now that the black terror had cleared away from the future , she seemed to long to follow Margaret at once , and to yearn after her lost child ; while appeals to the affection that surrounded her , often seemed to oppress her , as if there were nothing but weariness and toil in store . The state of her mind made her father very anxious , though it was but too well accounted for . Poor Flora had voluntarily assumed the trammels that galled her ; worldly motives had prompted her marriage , and though she faithfully loved her husband , he was a heavy weight on her hands , and she had made it more onerous by thrusting him into a position for which he was not calculated , and inspriring him with a self - consequence that would not recede from it . The shock of her child 's death had taken away the zest and energy which had rejoiced in her chosen way of life , and opened her eyes to see what Master she had been serving ; and the perception of the hollowness of all that had been apparently good in her , had filled her with remorse and despair . Her sufferings had been the more bitter because she had not parted with her proud reserve . She had refused council , and denied her confidence to those who could have guided her repentance . Her natural good sense , and the sound principle in which she had been brought up , had taught her to distrust her gloomy feelings as possibly morbid ; and she had prayed , keeping her hold of faith in the Infinite Mercy , though she could not feel her own part in it ; and thus that faith was beginning at last to clear her path . It was the harder to deal with her , because her hysterical agitation was so easily excited , that her father hardly dared to let a word be spoken to her ; and she was allowed to see no one else except her aunt and the dear old nurse , whose tears for her child Margaret had been checked by the urgent requirements of another of her nurslings ; and whom George Rivers would have paid with her weight in gold , for taking care of his new daughter , regarding her as the only woman in the world that could be trusted . Those were heavy days with everyone , though each brought some shade of improvement . They were harder to bear than the peaceful days that had immediately followed the loss of Margaret ; and Ethel was especially unhappy and forlorn under the new anxiety , where she could be of no service ; and with her precious occupation gone ; her father absent , instead of resting upon her ; and her room deserted . She was grieved with herself , because her feelings were unable to soar at the Christmas feast , as erst on St. Andrew 's day ; and she was bewildered and distressed by the fear that she had then been only uplifted by vanity and elation . She told Richard so , and he said , kindly , that he thought a good deal of what she complained of arose from bodily weariness . This hurt her a little ; but when he said , '
360152	360165	360140	360141	St. Andrew	758	' she owned that it had indeed been so , and added , '
360185	360477	360174	360174	me	0	' Sick at heart as she was , she bravely set herself to appropriate the hours now left vacant ; and manfully walked with Richard and Harry to Church at Cocksmoor , on St. Stephen 's day ; but the Church brought back the sense of contrast . Next , she insisted on fulfilling their intention of coming home by Abbotstoke to hear how Flora was , when the unfavorable account only added lead to the burthen that weighted her down . Though they were sent home in the carriage , she was so completely spent , that the effect of returning home to her room , without its dear inhabitant , was quite overwhelming , and she sat on her bed for half - an - hour , struggling with repinings . She came down - stairs without having gained the victory , and was so physically overcome with lassitude , that Richard insisted on her lying on the sofa , and leaving everything to him and Mary . Richard seemed to make her his object in life , and was an unspeakable help and comforter to her , not only by taking every care for her for her sake , but by turning to her as his own friend and confidante , the best able to replace what they had lost . There were many plans to be put in operation for Cocksmoor , on which much consultation was needed , though every word reminded them sadly of Margaret 's ever ready interest in those schemes . It was very unlike Ethel 's vision of the first weeks of St. Andrew 's Church ; but it might be safer for her than that aught should tempt her to say , '
360485	360730	360731	360731	You	7240	' Perhaps her Margaret had begun to admire her too much to be her safest confidante — at any rate , it was good still to sow in tears , rather than on earth to reap in confident joy . Norman was as brotherly and kind as possible ; but it was one of the dreary feelings of those days , that Ethel then first became aware of the difference that his engagement had made , and saw that he resorted elsewhere for sympathy . She was not jealous , and acquiesced submissively and resolutely ; but they had been so much to each other , that it was a trial , especially at such a time as this , when freshly deprived of Margaret . Norman 's own prospect was not cheerful . He had received a letter from New Zealand , begging him to hasten his coming out , as there was educational work much wanting him , and , according to his original wish , he could be ordained there in the autumnal Ember week . He was in much perplexity , since , according to this request , he ought to sail with his aunt in the last week of February , and he knew not how to reconcile the conflicting claims . Meta was not long in finding out the whole of his trouble , as they paced up and down the terrace together , on a frosty afternoon . '
360735	360741	360742	360742	I	0	' was her first exclamation . '

361305	361488	361289	361289	I	0	' Meta talked so as to brighten and invigorate Norman when they were together , but they both grew low - spirited when apart . The humming - bird had hardly ever been so downcast as at present — that is , whenever she was not engaged in waiting on her brother , or in cheering up Dr. May , or in any of the many gentle offices that she was ever fulfilling . She was greatly disappointed , and full of fears for Norman , and dread of the separation , but she would not give way ; and only now and then , when off her guard , would the sadness reign on her face without an effort . Alone , she fought and prayed for resignation for herself , and protection and strength for him , and chid herself for the foolish feeling that he would be safer with her . She told aunt Flora how it was one evening , as they sat over the fire together , speaking with a would - be - tone of congratulation . '

361807	361977	361804	361805	dear Margaret	249	' Flora was , however , much softened and less reserved than she had been . She found great repose in her aunt 's attendance , retracing , as it did her mother 's presence , and she responded to her tenderness with increasing reliance and comfort ; while as her strength began to revive , and there was more disposition to talk , she became gradually drawn into greater confidence . The seeing of Ethel was one of the difficult questions . Flora had begun to wish it very much , and yet the bare idea threw her into a nervous tremor , that caused it to be put off again and again . Her aunt found her one day almost faint with agitation — she had heard Ethel 's voice in the next room , and had been winding up her expectations , and now was as much grieved as relieved , to find that she had been there seeing the baby , but was now gone .

362169	362181	362155	362155	Flora	280	' Then it was entirely out of devotion to your father . '

362189	362221	362187	362187	Flora	280	' No one could look at her without seeing that she liked him . I had left her to be the only effective one at home , and she sacrificed herself . '
362222	362232	362234	362235	Mrs. Arnott	289	' I am glad that I have seen her , '
362237	362262	362234	362235	Mrs. Arnott	289	' I should never have understood her by description . I always said that I must come home to set my correspondence going rightly . '

362272	362285	362269	362270	her niece	3329	' do you remember my dear mother 's unfinished letter to you ? '
362286	362296	362234	362235	Mrs. Arnott	289	' To be sure I do , my dear . '
362297	362304	362306	362306	Flora	280	' Nothing ever was more true , '
362308	362347	362306	362306	Flora	280	' I read it over some little time ago , when I set my papers in order , and understood it then . I never did before . I used to think it very good for the others . '
362348	362359	362234	362235	Mrs. Arnott	289	' It is what one generally does with good advice . '
362360	362424	362306	362306	Flora	280	' Do you recollect the comparison between Norman , Ethel , and me ? It is so curious . Norman , who was ambitious and loved praise , but now dreads nothing so much ; Ethel , who never cared for anything of the kind , but went straight on her own brave way ; and , oh ! aunt Flora — me — '
362425	362442	362234	362235	Mrs. Arnott	289	' Indeed , my dear , I should have thought you had her most full approbation . '
362443	362473	362475	362475	Flora	280	' Ah ! do n't you see the tone , as if she were not fully satisfied , as if she only could not see surface faults in me , '
362477	362596	362475	362475	Flora	280	' and how she said she dreaded my love of praise , and of being liked . I wonder how it would have been if she had lived . I have looked back so often in the past year , and I think the hollowness began from that time . It might have been there before , but I am not so sure . You see , at that dreadful time , after the accident , I was the eldest who was able to be efficient , and much more useful than poor Ethel . I think the credit I gained made me think myself perfection , and I never did anything afterwards but seek my own honour . '
362635	362641	362643	362643	Flora	280	' You do not know , '
362645	362873	362643	362643	Flora	280	' how greedy I was of credit and affection . It made me jealous of Ethel herself , as long as we were in the same sphere ; and when I felt that she was more to papa than I could be , I looked beyond home for praise . I do n't think the things I did were bad in themselves — brought up as I have been , they could hardly be so . I knew what merits praise and blame too well for that — but oh ! the motive . I do believe I cared very much for Cocksmoor . I thought it would be a grand thing to bring about , but , you see , as it has turned out , all I thought I had done for it was in vain ; and Ethel has been the real person and does not know it . I used to think Ethel so inferior to me . I left her all my work at home . If it had not been for that , she might have been happy with Norman Ogilvie — for never were two people better matched , and now she has done what I never thought to have left to another — watched over our own Margaret . Oh ! how shall I ever bear to see her ? '
362874	362896	363028	363029	Mrs. Arnott	289	' My dear , I am sure nothing can be more affectionate than Ethel . She does not think these things . '
362897	362901	362903	362903	Flora	280	' She does , '
362905	362997	362903	362903	Flora	280	' She always knew me better than I did myself . Her straightforward words should often have been rebukes to me . I shall see in every look and tone the opinion I have deserved . I have shrunk from her steadfast looks ever since I myself learnt what I was . I could not bear them now — and yet — oh ! aunt ! you must bring her . Ethel ! my dear , dear old King — my darling 's godmother — the last who was with Margaret ! '
363149	363153	363135	363136	Dr. May	238	' he said , '
363171	363212	363213	363213	I	0	' Did he know what a mountain there was in her throat when he seemed to think it so easy to be natural ? She found him leading her into a darkened room , and heard his cheerful tones saying , '

363226	363275	363222	363222	Ethel	750	' said a low , weak voice , with a sound as of expecting a treat , and Ethel was within a curtain , where she began , in the dimness , to see something white moving , and her hands were clasped by two long thin ones . '

364020	364056	364014	364014	You	0	' said Ethel , in an odd , dry manner ; which , in sound , though not in feeling , was a contrast to the soft , whispering , tearful murmurs of her sister . '
364061	364078	364014	364014	You	0	' continued Flora—'that I should have taken up such a great piece of her short visit ! '
364079	364091	364093	364093	Ethel	750	' Ah ! it is coming to an end very fast , '
364097	364130	364093	364093	Ethel	750	' but you had the best right to her , and she and Meta have seen so much of each other . She tells me she is quite satisfied about Meta now . '
364131	364143	364145	364145	Flora	280	' I am sorry to see Meta looking out of spirits , '
364147	364165	364145	364145	Flora	280	' I almost made her cry by saying something about Norman . Is there anything going wrong ? '
364176	364184	364166	364166	Ethel	750	' Only about Norman 's going out . '
364205	364211	364212	364212	she	280	' This will never do ! '
364215	364226	364212	364212	she	280	' They must marry , and go with my aunt . '
364231	364240	364227	364227	Ethel	750	' They would not hear of it now ! '
364241	364291	364212	364212	she	280	' They must . It is the only reasonable thing . Why , Norman would be miserable , and , as to Meta — Imagine his going out and returning — a year 's work , such an expense and loss of time , besides the missing aunt Flora . '
364292	364299	364227	364227	Ethel	750	' If it were not wrong — '
364300	364311	364313	364313	she	280	' The waste would be the wrong thing . Besides — '
364320	364338	364313	364313	she	280	' But , Flora , think — the last week in February — and you so ill ! '
364339	364347	364349	364349	Flora	280	' I am not to marry them , '
364353	364402	364349	364349	Flora	280	' If it could be in a fortnight , they could go and get their outfit afterwards , and come back to us when I am stronger . Let me see — there need be no fuss about settlements — Mr. Rivers 's will arranges everything for her . '
364403	364418	364420	364420	Ethel	750	' It would be a good thing to get rid of a fine wedding , '
364422	364429	364420	364420	Ethel	750	' but they will never consent ! '
364430	364439	364349	364349	Flora	280	' Yes they will , and be grateful . '
364440	364448	364450	364450	Ethel	750	' Papa would be happier about Norman , '
364452	364487	364450	364450	Ethel	750	' but I can not fancy his liking it . And you — you ca n't spare Meta , for aunt Flora must go to the Arnott 's in a week or two more . '
364488	364498	364500	364500	Flora	280	' Suppose papa was to let me have you , '
364502	364514	364500	364500	Flora	280	' If he wants you , he must come after you . '

364566	364809	364813	364813	she	7288	' said Flora . Dr. May came in to break up the conversation , and Ethel quickly guessed from his manner that Norman had been talking to him . Flora told him that she had been agreeing with Ethel that Meta had much better not miss this opportunity . He was far less startled than Ethel had expected ; indeed , the proposal was rather a relief to his mind , and his chief objection was the fear that Flora would be fatigued by the extra bustle , but she promised not to trouble herself about it , otherwise than that if Norman could not persuade Meta , she would . The sisters parted , much more comfortable than before . Ethel felt as if she had found something like a dim reflection of Margaret , and Flora 's fear of Ethel had fled away from the mere force of sisterhood . As to Norman , he declared that he had not the audacity to make the proposal to Meta , though he was only too grateful — so his father carried it to the humming - bird ; and , as soon as she found that it was not improper , nor would hurt anyone 's feelings , she gave ready consent — only begging that it might be as best suited everyone , especially Flora ; and ending by a whisper to her dear fatherly friend , owning that she was '
364825	364901	364813	364813	she	7288	' So Norman and Meta settled their plans as they walked home together from evening service , after listening to the prophecies of the blessings to be spread into the waste and desolate places , which should yet become the heritage of the Chosen , and with the evening star shining on them , like a faint reflex of the Star of the East , Who came to be a Light to lighten the Gentiles .

365893	365898	365900	365900	Flora	280	' They were not , '

365982	365995	365997	365997	Ethel	750	' If they are not duties , I would not do them , '

366040	366044	366046	366046	Ethel	750	' Would he ? '
366048	366054	366046	366046	Ethel	750	' If I wished it . '
366055	366064	366066	366066	Ethel	750	' But what would he do with himself ? '
366075	366087	366089	366089	Flora	280	' Yachtting , farming , Cochin - chinese — or something , '
366091	366099	366089	366089	Flora	280	' Anything not so wearing as this ! '
366100	366111	366113	366113	Ethel	750	' That abominable candidate of Tomkins 's would come in ! '
366115	366125	366113	366113	Ethel	750	' Oh ! Flora , that would be horrid ! '
366126	366133	366135	366135	Flora	280	' That might be guarded against , '
366137	366199	366135	366135	Flora	280	' Perhaps Sir Henry — but , oh , let us leave politics in peace while we can . I thought we should do some great good , but it is all a maze of confusion . It is so hard to know principles from parties , and everything goes wrong ! It is of no use to contend with it ! '
366200	366210	366212	366212	Ethel	750	' It is never vain to contend with evil , '
366214	366220	366222	366222	Flora	280	' We are not genralizing , '
366224	366286	366222	366222	Flora	280	' There is evil nearer home than the state of parties , and I ca n't see that George 's being in Parliament — being what he is — is anything like the benefit to things in general — that it is temptation and plague to me , besides the risk of London life for the baby , now and hereafter . '
366287	366298	366300	366300	Ethel	750	' I ca n't say that I think it is , '
366302	366325	366300	366300	Ethel	750	' How nice it would be to have you here ! I am so glad you are willing to give it up . '

366354	366359	366361	366361	Ethel	750	' But , Flora , '
366367	366379	366361	366361	Ethel	750	' You ought not to do such a thing without advice . '
366380	366391	366393	366393	Flora	280	' There will be worry enough before it is done ! '
366395	366401	366393	366393	Flora	280	' No fear of that ! '
366402	366407	366409	366409	Ethel	750	' Stop a minute , '
366426	366440	366409	366409	Ethel	750	' I think you ought to consider well before you set it going . '
366441	366464	366393	366393	Flora	280	' Have not I longed for it day and night ? It is an escape from peril for ourselves and our child . '
366465	366472	366474	366474	Ethel	750	' I ca n't be sure ! '
366476	366490	366474	366474	Ethel	750	' It may be more wrong to make George desert the post which — '
366491	366498	366500	366500	Flora	280	' Which I thrust him into , '
366502	366510	366500	366500	Flora	280	' My father told me as much . '
366511	366597	366474	366474	Ethel	750	' I did not mean you to say that ! But it is a puzzle . It seems as if it were right to give up such things ; yet , when I recollect the difficulty of carrying an election right at Stoneborough , I think papa would be very sorry . I do n't think his interest would bring in any sound man but his son - in - law ; and George himself seems to like his parliamentary life better than anything else . '
366598	366601	366603	366603	Flora	280	' Yes , '
366676	366679	366681	366681	Ethel	750	' Then , '

366720	366729	366731	366731	Flora	280	' I 'll take care of his dignity , '
366735	366744	366731	366731	Flora	280	' I know you would do it well — '
366745	366754	366757	366757	Flora	280	' I am sick of doing things well ! '
366759	366803	366757	366757	Flora	280	' You little know how I dread reading up all I must read presently ! I shall lose all I have scarcely gained . I can not find peace any way , but by throwing down the load I gave my peace for . '
366804	366812	366814	366814	Ethel	750	' Whether this is truth or fancy , '
366818	366827	366814	366814	Ethel	750	' If you would ask some one competent . '
366828	366842	366844	366844	Flora	280	' Do n't you know there are some things one can not ask , '
366846	366874	366876	366876	he	7329	' I do n't know why I spoke to you ! Ah ! come in ! Why , George , that is a finer egg than ever , '

367042	367198	367040	367040	Ethel	750	' I wonder whether Honorious 's hen was a Shanghae ! Poor Flora is right — it is poor work to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear ! but , putting him into the place is one thing , taking him out another . I wish she would take advice ; but I never knew her do that , except as a civil way of communicating her intentions . However , she is not quite what she was ! Poor dear ! Aunt Flora will never believe what a beautiful creature she used to be ! It seems wrong to think of her going back to that horrid London ; but I ca n't judge . For my part , I 'd rather do work , than no work for George , and he is a good , kind - hearted fellow after all ! I wo n't be a crab ! '

The proud reserve was the true evil , and Ethel prayed and trusted it might give way . She went very amiably to Whitford with George , and gained great credit with him , for admiring the prettiest speckled Hamburgh present ; indeed , George was becoming very fond of " poor Ethel , " as he still called her , and sometimes predicted that she would turn out a fine figure of a woman after all . Ethel heard , on her return , that Richard had been there ; and three days '
