35	39	40	40	I	0	“ DEAR CHARLES , “
229	328	216	216	I	0	“ It is a long time since I wrote to you , and a still longer time since I saw you . Chancing to take up a newspaper of your county the other day , my eye fell upon your name . I began to think of old times ; to run over the events which have transpired since we separated ; and I sat down and commenced this letter . What you have been doing I know not ; but you shall hear , if you choose to listen , how the world has wagged with me . “
441	575	431	432	his daughters	296	“ I declined both the Church and matrimony . A good clergyman is a good thing , but I should have made a very bad one . As to the wife — oh how like a night - mare is the thought of being bound for life to one of my cousins ! No doubt they are accomplished and pretty ; but not an accomplishment , not a charm of theirs , touches a chord in my bosom . To think of passing the winter evenings by the parlour fire - side of Seacombe Rectory alone with one of them — for instance , the large and well - modelled statue , Sarah — no ; I should be a bad husband , under such circumstances , as well as a bad clergyman . “
841	986	987	987	My	0	“ I wrote instantly to Edward — you know Edward — my only brother , ten years my senior , married to a rich mill - owner ’s daughter , and now possessor of the mill and business which was my father ’s before he failed . You are aware that my father — once reckoned a Croesus of wealth — became bankrupt a short time previous to his death , and that my mother lived in destitution for some six months after him , unhelped by her aristocratical brothers , whom she had mortally offended by her union with Crimsworth , the —— shire manufacturer . At the end of the six months she brought me into the world , and then herself left it without , I should think , much regret , as it contained little hope or comfort for her . “
1418	1539	1401	1401	I	0	“ An irreparable breach thus being effected between my uncles and myself , I wrote to Edward ; told him what had occurred , and informed him of my intention to follow his steps and be a tradesman . I asked , moreover , if he could give me employment . His answer expressed no approbation of my conduct , but he said I might come down to — — shire , if I liked , and he would ‘ see what could be done in the way of furnishing me with work . ’ I repressed all — even mental comment on his note — packed my trunk and carpet - bag , and started for the North directly . “
1614	1713	1714	1714	Edward	99	“ It was late in the evening when I alighted at the gates of the habitation designated to me as my brother ’s . As I advanced up the avenue , I could see through the shades of twilight , and the dark gloomy mists which deepened those shades , that the house was large , and the grounds surrounding it sufficiently spacious . I paused a moment on the lawn in front , and leaning my back against a tall tree which rose in the centre , I gazed with interest on the exterior of Crimsworth Hall . “
1718	1847	1714	1714	Edward	99	” thought I to myself . ‘ I believed him to be doing well — but I did not know he was master of a mansion like this . ’ Cutting short all marvelling ; speculation , conjecture , & c. , I advanced to the front door and rang . A man - servant opened it — I announced myself — he relieved me of my wet cloak and carpet - bag , and ushered me into a room furnished as a library , where there was a bright fire and candles burning on the table ; he informed me that his master was not yet returned from X —— market , but that he would certainly be at home in the course of half an hour . “
2029	2115	2116	2116	I	0	“ I thought of my uncles ; and as I was engaged in wondering whether Edward ’s indifference would equal the cold disdain I had always experienced from them , I heard the avenue gates open : wheels approached the house ; Mr. Crimsworth was arrived ; and after the lapse of some minutes , and a brief dialogue between himself and his servant in the hall , his tread drew near the library door — that tread alone announced the master of the house . “
2254	2317	2235	2235	he	338	“ ‘ I expected you would have called at the counting - house in the Close , ’ said he ; and his voice , I noticed , had an abrupt accent , probably habitual to him ; he spoke also with a guttural northern tone , which sounded harsh in my ears , accustomed to the silvery utterance of the South . “
2361	2406	2407	2407	I	0	“ ‘ Oh , it is all right ! ’ he replied , ‘ only I was kept half an hour behind time , waiting for you — that is all . I thought you must be coming by the eight o’clock coach . ’ “
2442	2480	2437	2437	he	340	“ I felt an inward satisfaction that I had not , in the first moment of meeting , betrayed any warmth , any enthusiasm ; that I had saluted this man with a quiet and steady phlegm . “
2496	2531	2492	2492	he	340	“ ‘ I do not think I shall have any further communication with them ; my refusal of their proposals will , I fancy , operate as a barrier against all future intercourse . ’ “
2555	2563	2537	2537	he	340	“ no man can serve two masters . ”
2597	2675	2683	2683	he	340	“ Feeling no disposition to reply to him , I contented myself with an inward speculation on the differences which exist in the constitution of men ’s minds . I do not know what inference Mr. Crimsworth drew from my silence — whether he considered it a symptom of contumacity or an evidence of my being cowed by his peremptory manner . After a long and hard stare at me , he rose sharply from his seat . “
2715	2813	2711	2711	you	0	“ He strode from the room , and I followed . In crossing the hall , I wondered what Mrs. Crimsworth might be . ‘ Is she , ’ thought I , ‘ as alien to what I like as Tynedale , Seacombe , the Misses Seacombe — as the affectionate relative now striding before me ? or is she better than these ? Shall I , in conversing with her , feel free to show something of my real nature ; or — ’ Further conjectures were arrested by my entrance into the dining - room . “
3108	3146	3103	3103	she	347	“ ‘ Now , Mr. William , is n’t it absurd in Edward to talk so ? He says he will drive Jack , and no other horse , and the brute has thrown him twice already . “
3370	3428	3429	3429	I	0	“ Having perused the fair page of Mrs. Crimsworth ’s face , a deep , involuntary sigh announced my disappointment ; she took it as a homage to her beauty , and Edward , who was evidently proud of his rich and handsome young wife , threw on me a glance — half ridicule , half ire . “
3579	3661	3662	3662	I	0	“ The face , I remembered , had pleased me as a boy , but then I did not understand it ; now I knew how rare that class of face is in the world , and I appreciated keenly its thoughtful , yet gentle expression . The serious grey eye possessed for me a strong charm , as did certain lines in the features indicative of most true and tender feeling . I was sorry it was only a picture . “
3705	3713	3714	3715	WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH	103	“ Good - bye for the present , “
3717	4068	3714	3715	WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH	103	” To this letter I never got an answer ; before my old friend received it , he had accepted a Government appointment in one of the colonies , and was already on his way to the scene of his official labours . What has become of him since , I know not . The leisure time I have at command , and which I intended to employ for his private benefit , I shall now dedicate to that of the public at large . My narrative is not exciting , and above all , not marvellous ; but it may interest some individuals , who , having toiled in the same vocation as myself , will find in my experience frequent reflections of their own . The above letter will serve as an introduction . I now proceed . A FINE October morning succeeded to the foggy evening that had witnessed my first introduction to Crimsworth Hall . I was early up and walking in the large park - like meadow surrounding the house . The autumn sun , rising over the — — shire hills , disclosed a pleasant country ; woods brown and mellow varied the fields from which the harvest had been lately carried ; a river , gliding between the woods , caught on its surface the somewhat cold gleam of the October sun and sky ; at frequent intervals along the banks of the river , tall , cylindrical chimneys , almost like slender round towers , indicated the factories which the trees half concealed ; here and there mansions , similar to Crimsworth Hall , occupied agreeable sites on the hill - side ; the country wore , on the whole , a cheerful , active , fertile look . Steam , trade , machinery had long banished from it all romance and seclusion . At a distance of five miles , a valley , opening between the low hills , held in its cups the great town of X——. A dense , permanent vapour brooded over this locality — there lay Edward ’s “
4071	4141	4142	4142	William	103	” I forced my eye to scrutinize this prospect , I forced my mind to dwell on it for a time , and when I found that it communicated no pleasurable emotion to my heart — that it stirred in me none of the hopes a man ought to feel , when he sees laid before him the scene of his life ’s career — I said to myself , “
4176	4179	4146	4149	a rebel against circumstances	372	” I continued mentally—“Look
4216	4299	4146	4149	a rebel against circumstances	372	” Thus self - schooled , I returned to the house . My brother was in the breakfast - room . I met him collectedly — I could not meet him cheerfully ; he was standing on the rug , his back to the fire — how much did I read in the expression of his eye as my glance encountered his , when I advanced to bid him good morning ; how much that was contradictory to my nature ! He said “
4302	5047	5048	5048	Steighton	105	” abruptly and nodded , and then he snatched , rather than took , a newspaper from the table , and began to read it with the air of a master who seizes a pretext to escape the bore of conversing with an underling . It was well I had taken a resolution to endure for a time , or his manner would have gone far to render insupportable the disgust I had just been endeavouring to subdue . I looked at him : I measured his robust frame and powerful proportions ; I saw my own reflection in the mirror over the mantel - piece ; I amused myself with comparing the two pictures . In face I resembled him , though I was not so handsome ; my features were less regular ; I had a darker eye , and a broader brow — in form I was greatly inferior — thinner , slighter , not so tall . As an animal , Edward excelled me far ; should he prove as paramount in mind as in person I must be a slave — for I must expect from him no lion - like generosity to one weaker than himself ; his cold , avaricious eye , his stern , forbidding manner told me he would not spare . Had I then force of mind to cope with him ? I did not know ; I had never been tried . Mrs. Crimsworth ’s entrance diverted my thoughts for a moment . She looked well , dressed in white , her face and her attire shining in morning and bridal freshness . I addressed her with the degree of ease her last night ’s careless gaiety seemed to warrant , but she replied with coolness and restraint : her husband had tutored her ; she was not to be too familiar with his clerk . As soon as breakfast was over Mr. Crimsworth intimated to me that they were bringing the gig round to the door , and that in five minutes he should expect me to be ready to go down with him to X——. I did not keep him waiting ; we were soon dashing at a rapid rate along the road . The horse he drove was the same vicious animal about which Mrs. Crimsworth had expressed her fears the night before . Once or twice Jack seemed disposed to turn restive , but a vigorous and determined application of the whip from the ruthless hand of his master soon compelled him to submission , and Edward ’s dilated nostril expressed his triumph in the result of the contest ; he scarcely spoke to me during the whole of the brief drive , only opening his lips at intervals to damn his horse . X — — was all stir and bustle when we entered it ; we left the clean streets where there were dwelling - houses and shops , churches , and public buildings ; we left all these , and turned down to a region of mills and warehouses ; thence we passed through two massive gates into a great paved yard , and we were in Bigben Close , and the mill was before us , vomiting soot from its long chimney , and quivering through its thick brick walls with the commotion of its iron bowels . Workpeople were passing to and fro ; a waggon was being laden with pieces . Mr. Crimsworth looked from side to side , and seemed at one glance to comprehend all that was going on ; he alighted , and leaving his horse and gig to the care of a man who hastened to take the reins from his hand , he bid me follow him to the counting - house . We entered it ; a very different place from the parlours of Crimsworth Hall — a place for business , with a bare , planked floor , a safe , two high desks and stools , and some chairs . A person was seated at one of the desks , who took off his square cap when Mr. Crimsworth entered , and in an instant was again absorbed in his occupation of writing or calculating — I know not which . Mr. Crimsworth , having removed his mackintosh , sat down by the fire . I remained standing near the hearth ; he said presently — “
5074	5172	5173	5173	You	105	” The individual at the desk rose and departed , closing the door as he went out . Mr. Crimsworth stirred the fire , then folded his arms , and sat a moment thinking , his lips compressed , his brow knit . I had nothing to do but to watch him — how well his features were cut ! what a handsome man he was ! Whence , then , came that air of contraction — that narrow and hard aspect on his forehead , in all his lineaments ? Turning to me he began abruptly : “
5188	5189	5192	5192	I	0	” “
5195	5196	5192	5192	I	0	” “
5214	5215	5208	5208	me	0	” “
5218	5219	5208	5208	me	0	” “
5277	5278	5279	5279	I	0	” “
5284	5285	5279	5279	I	0	” “
5294	5295	5288	5288	I	0	” “
5305	5306	5296	5296	I	0	” “
5309	5335	5296	5296	I	0	” He reflected a moment , then opening a drawer in a desk near him took out a letter , and gave it to me . “
5341	5372	5337	5337	you	105	” he asked . It was a German commercial letter ; I translated it ; I could not tell whether he was gratified or not — his countenance remained fixed . “
5377	5385	5337	5337	you	105	” he said , after a pause , “
5443	5451	5429	5429	I	0	” he continued , raising his voice , “
5592	5593	5589	5589	you	105	” “
5596	5600	5603	5603	you	105	” I replied . “
5654	5704	5705	5705	You	105	” I turned on my heel , and walked to the window ; this time I did not consult his face to learn his opinion : what it was I do not know , nor did I then care . After a silence of some minutes he recommenced : — “
5788	5800	5803	5803	I	0	” Quitting the window , I walked back to the hearth . “
5813	5817	5803	5803	I	0	” I answered . “
5830	5864	5803	5803	I	0	” My tone was quiet . I always speak quietly . Yet Mr. Crimsworth ’s blue eye became incensed ; he took his revenge rather oddly . Turning to me he said bluntly — “
5887	5888	5889	5889	I	0	” “
5894	5897	5889	5889	I	0	” said I. “
5905	5913	5915	5915	I	0	” he repeated in a louder voice . “
5921	5922	5918	5919	Mr. Crimsworth	99	” “
5934	5938	5941	5941	I	0	” he answered . “
5984	5985	5991	5991	you	99	” “
6000	6047	6048	6048	I	0	” I said no more . I did not think the time was come for much parley . I had an instinctive feeling that it would be folly to let one ’s temper effervesce often with such a man as Edward . I said to myself , “
6208	6236	6237	6238	Mr. Steighton	105	” While I thus reasoned , Mr. Crimsworth rang a bell ; his first clerk , the individual dismissed previously to our conference , re - entered . “
6240	6244	6237	6238	Mr. Steighton	105	” said he , “
6269	6888	6889	6892	a religious man ”	2004	” Mr. Steighton , a man of about thirty - five , with a face at once sly and heavy , hastened to execute this order ; he laid the letters on the desk , and I was soon seated at it , and engaged in rendering the English answers into German . A sentiment of keen pleasure accompanied this first effort to earn my own living — a sentiment neither poisoned nor weakened by the presence of the taskmaster , who stood and watched me for some time as I wrote . I thought he was trying to read my character , but I felt as secure against his scrutiny as if I had had on a casque with the visor down — or rather I showed him my countenance with the confidence that one would show an unlearned man a letter written in Greek ; he might see lines , and trace characters , but he could make nothing of them ; my nature was not his nature , and its signs were to him like the words of an unknown tongue . Ere long he turned away abruptly , as if baffled , and left the counting - house ; he returned to it but twice in the course of that day ; each time he mixed and swallowed a glass of brandy - and - water , the materials for making which he extracted from a cupboard on one side of the fireplace ; having glanced at my translations — he could read both French and German — he went out again in silence . I SERVED Edward as his second clerk faithfully , punctually , diligently . What was given me to do I had the power and the determination to do well . Mr. Crimsworth watched sharply for defects , but found none ; he set Timothy Steighton , his favourite and head man , to watch also . Tim was baffled ; I was as exact as himself , and quicker . Mr. Crimsworth made inquiries as to how I lived , whether I got into debt — no , my accounts with my landlady were always straight . I had hired small lodgings , which I contrived to pay for out of a slender fund — the accumulated savings of my Eton pocket - money ; for as it had ever been abhorrent to my nature to ask pecuniary assistance , I had early acquired habits of self - denying economy ; husbanding my monthly allowance with anxious care , in order to obviate the danger of being forced , in some moment of future exigency , to beg additional aid . I remember many called me miser at the time , and I used to couple the reproach with this consolation — better to be misunderstood now than repulsed hereafter . At this day I had my reward ; I had had it before , when on parting with my irritated uncles one of them threw down on the table before me a 5l . note , which I was able to leave there , saying that my travelling expenses were already provided for . Mr. Crimsworth employed Tim to find out whether my landlady had any complaint to make on the score of my morals ; she answered that she believed I was a very religious man , and asked Tim , in her turn , if he thought I had any intention of going into the Church some day ; for , she said , she had had young curates to lodge in her house who were nothing equal to me for steadiness and quietness . Tim was “
6892	6899	6237	6238	Mr. Steighton	105	” himself ; indeed , he was “
6904	7593	6900	6904	a joined Methodist , ”	2005	” which did not ( be it understood ) prevent him from being at the same time an engrained rascal , and he came away much posed at hearing this account of my piety . Having imparted it to Mr. Crimsworth , that gentleman , who himself frequented no place of worship , and owned no God but Mammon , turned the information into a weapon of attack against the equability of my temper . He commenced a series of covert sneers , of which I did not at first perceive the drift , till my landlady happened to relate the conversation she had had with Mr. Steighton ; this enlightened me ; afterwards I came to the counting - house prepared , and managed to receive the millowner ’s blasphemous sarcasms , when next levelled at me , on a buckler of impenetrable indifference . Ere long he tired of wasting his ammunition on a statue , but he did not throw away the shafts — he only kept them quiet in his quiver . Once during my clerkship I had an invitation to Crimsworth Hall ; it was on the occasion of a large party given in honour of the master ’s birthday ; he had always been accustomed to invite his clerks on similar anniversaries , and could not well pass me over ; I was , however , kept strictly in the background . Mrs. Crimsworth , elegantly dressed in satin and lace , blooming in youth and health , vouchsafed me no more notice than was expressed by a distant move ; Crimsworth , of course , never spoke to me ; I was introduced to none of the band of young ladies , who , enveloped in silvery clouds of white gauze and muslin , sat in array against me on the opposite side of a long and large room ; in fact , I was fairly isolated , and could but contemplate the shining ones from afar , and when weary of such a dazzling scene , turn for a change to the consideration of the carpet pattern . Mr. Crimsworth , standing on the rug , his elbow supported by the marble mantelpiece , and about him a group of very pretty girls , with whom he conversed gaily — Mr. Crimsworth , thus placed , glanced at me ; I looked weary , solitary , kept down like some desolate tutor or governess ; he was satisfied . Dancing began ; I should have liked well enough to be introduced to some pleasing and intelligent girl , and to have freedom and opportunity to show that I could both feel and communicate the pleasure of social intercourse — that I was not , in short , a block , or a piece of furniture , but an acting , thinking , sentient man . Many smiling faces and graceful figures glided past me , but the smiles were lavished on other eyes , the figures sustained by other hands than mine . I turned away tantalized , left the dancers , and wandered into the oak - panelled dining - room . No fibre of sympathy united me to any living thing in this house ; I looked for and found my mother ’s picture . I took a wax taper from a stand , and held it up . I gazed long , earnestly ; my heart grew to the image . My mother , I perceived , had bequeathed to me much of her features and countenance — her forehead , her eyes , her complexion . No regular beauty pleases egotistical human beings so much as a softened and refined likeness of themselves ; for this reason , fathers regard with complacency the lineaments of their daughters ’ faces , where frequently their own similitude is found flatteringly associated with softness of hue and delicacy of outline . I was just wondering how that picture , to me so interesting , would strike an impartial spectator , when a voice close behind me pronounced the words — “
7604	7749	6900	6904	a joined Methodist , ”	2005	” I turned ; at my elbow stood a tall man , young , though probably five or six years older than I — in other respects of an appearance the opposite to common place ; though just now , as I am not disposed to paint his portrait in detail , the reader must be content with the silhouette I have just thrown off ; it was all I myself saw of him for the moment : I did not investigate the colour of his eyebrows , nor of his eyes either ; I saw his stature , and the outline of his shape ; I saw , too , his fastidious - looking retroussé nose ; these observations , few in number , and general in character ( the last excepted ) , sufficed , for they enabled me to recognize him . “
7756	7902	7753	7754	Mr. Hunsden	109	” muttered I with a bow , and then , like a shy noodle as I was , I began moving away — and why ? Simply because Mr. Hunsden was a manufacturer and a millowner , and I was only a clerk , and my instinct propelled me from my superior . I had frequently seen Hunsden in Bigben Close , where he came almost weekly to transact business with Mr. Crimsworth , but I had never spoken to him , nor he to me , and I owed him a sort of involuntary grudge , because he had more than once been the tacit witness of insults offered by Edward to me . I had the conviction that he could only regard me as a poor - spirited slave , wherefore I now went about to shun his presence and eschew his conversation . “
7908	7939	7940	7940	He	396	” asked he , as I edged off sideways . I had already noticed that Mr. Hunsden indulged in abrupt forms of speech , and I perversely said to myself — “
7978	8004	7964	7964	he	396	” I made some slight reply , rather indifferent than courteous , and continued to move away . He coolly planted himself in my path . “
8009	8013	7964	7964	he	396	” said he : “
8041	8124	8142	8142	you	401	” He was right , and as he spoke neither his look , tone , nor manner displeased me ; my amour - propre was propitiated ; he had not addressed me out of condescension , but because , having repaired to the cool dining - room for refreshment , he now wanted some one to talk to , by way of temporary amusement . I hate to be condescended to , but I like well enough to oblige ; I stayed . “
8131	8140	8142	8142	you	401	” he continued , recurring to the portrait . “
8148	8152	8142	8142	you	401	” I asked . “
8205	8221	8224	8224	I	0	” I agreed with him , but did not say so . He went on . “
8287	8288	8289	8289	You	401	” “
8312	8313	8289	8289	You	401	” “
8420	8425	8410	8412	Mrs. Edward Crimsworth	96	” I replied quietly : “
8436	8437	8433	8434	Mr Hunsden	109	” “
8556	8594	8597	8597	you	401	” There was something in Mr. Hunsden ’s point - blank mode of speech which rather pleased me than otherwise because it set me at my ease . I continued the conversation with a degree of interest . “
8627	8628	8611	8611	you	401	” “
8664	8710	8652	8652	he	99	” I was silent . Hunsden ’s language now bordered on the impertinent , still his manner did not offend me in the least — it only piqued my curiosity ; I wanted him to go on , which he did in a little while . “
8718	8722	8652	8652	he	99	” said he . “
8729	8730	8726	8727	Mr. Hunsden	109	” “
8750	8777	8737	8737	you	109	” I was determined he should explain himself of his own accord , without my pressing him so to do — so I resumed my silence . “
8787	8792	8780	8780	your	109	” he inquired presently . “
8802	8803	8795	8795	my	0	” “
8827	8828	8829	8829	My	0	” “
8841	8842	8833	8834	the Lord	426	” “
8895	8896	8893	8893	mine	0	” “
8903	8904	8898	8898	I	0	” “
8991	9587	8986	8986	I	0	” And Mr. Hunsden strode away . I watched him through the open folding - doors ; he outstripped Waddy , applied for the hand of the fine girl , and led her off triumphant . She was a tall , well - made , full - formed , dashingly - dressed young woman , much in the style of Mrs. E. Crimsworth ; Hunsden whirled her through the waltz with spirit ; he kept at her side during the remainder of the evening , and I read in her animated and gratified countenance that he succeeded in making himself perfectly agreeable . The mamma too ( a stout person in a turban — Mrs. Lupton by name ) looked well pleased ; prophetic visions probably flattered her inward eye . The Hunsdens were of an old stem ; and scornful as Yorke ( such was my late interlocutor ’s name ) professed to be of the advantages of birth , in his secret heart he well knew and fully appreciated the distinction his ancient , if not high lineage conferred on him in a mushroom - place like X — — , concerning whose inhabitants it was proverbially said , that not one in a thousand knew his own grandfather . Moreover the Hunsdens , once rich , were still independent ; and report affirmed that Yorke bade fair , by his success in business , to restore to pristine prosperity the partially decayed fortunes of his house . These circumstances considered , Mrs. Lupton ’s broad face might well wear a smile of complacency as she contemplated the heir of Hunsden Wood occupied in paying assiduous court to her darling Sarah Martha . I , however , whose observations being less anxious , were likely to be more accurate , soon saw that the grounds for maternal self - congratulation were slight indeed ; the gentleman appeared to me much more desirous of making , than susceptible of receiving an impression . I know not what it was in Mr. Hunsden that , as I watched him ( I had nothing better to do ) , suggested to me , every now and then , the idea of a foreigner . In form and features he might be pronounced English , though even there one caught a dash of something Gallic ; but he had no English shyness : he had learnt somewhere , somehow , the art of setting himself quite at his ease , and of allowing no insular timidity to intervene as a barrier between him and his convenience or pleasure . Refinement he did not affect , yet vulgar he could not be called ; he was not odd — no quiz — yet he resembled no one else I had ever seen before ; his general bearing intimated complete , sovereign satisfaction with himself ; yet , at times , an indescribable shade passed like an eclipse over his countenance , and seemed to me like the sign of a sudden and strong inward doubt of himself , his words and actions an energetic discontent at his life or his social position , his future prospects or his mental attainments — I know not which ; perhaps after all it might only be a bilious caprice . No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a mistake in the choice of his profession , and every man , worthy of the name , will row long against wind and tide before he allows himself to cry out , “
9592	10241	9588	9588	I	0	” and submits to be floated passively back to land . From the first week of my residence in X — — I felt my occupation irksome . The thing itself — the work of copying and translating business - letters — was a dry and tedious task enough , but had that been all , I should long have borne with the nuisance ; I am not of an impatient nature , and influenced by the double desire of getting my living and justifying to myself and others the resolution I had taken to become a tradesman , I should have endured in silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties ; I should not have whispered , even inwardly , that I longed for liberty ; I should have pent in every sigh by which my heart might have ventured to intimate its distress under the closeness , smoke , monotony and joyless tumult of Bigben Close , and its panting desire for freer and fresher scenes ; I should have set up the image of Duty , the fetish of Perseverance , in my small bedroom at Mrs. King ’s lodgings , and they two should have been my household gods , from which my darling , my cherished - in - secret , Imagination , the tender and the mighty , should never , either by softness or strength , have severed me . But this was not all ; the antipathy which had sprung up between myself and my employer striking deeper root and spreading denser shade daily , excluded me from every glimpse of the sunshine of life ; and I began to feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the slimy walls of a well . Antipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me — a feeling , in a great measure , involuntary , and which was liable to be excited by every , the most trifling movement , look , or word of mine . My southern accent annoyed him ; the degree of education evinced in my language irritated him ; my punctuality , industry , and accuracy , fixed his dislike , and gave it the high flavour and poignant relish of envy ; he feared that I too should one day make a successful tradesman . Had I been in anything inferior to him , he would not have hated me so thoroughly , but I knew all that he knew , and , what was worse , he suspected that I kept the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he was no sharer . If he could have once placed me in a ridiculous or mortifying position , he would have forgiven me much , but I was guarded by three faculties — Caution , Tact , Observation ; and prowling and prying as was Edward ’s malignity , it could never baffle the lynx - eyes of these , my natural sentinels . Day by day did his malice watch my tact , hoping it would sleep , and prepared to steal snake - like on its slumber ; but tact , if it be genuine , never sleeps . I had received my first quarter ’s wages , and was returning to my lodgings , possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who had paid me grudged every penny of that hard - earned pittance—(I had long ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother — he was a hard , grinding master ; he wished to be an inexorable tyrant : that was all ) . Thoughts , not varied but strong , occupied my mind ; two voices spoke within me ; again and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases . One said : “
10249	10253	10242	10242	William	101	” The other : “
10262	10323	10256	10256	you	101	” I walked fast , for it was a cold , frosty night in January ; as I approached my lodgings , I turned from a general view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to whether my fire would be out ; looking towards the window of my sitting - room , I saw no cheering red gleam . “
10335	10339	10327	10328	a servant	367	” said I , “
10367	10489	10360	10360	I	0	” It was a fine night , and the streets were dry and even clean for X — — ; there was a crescent curve of moonlight to be seen by the parish church tower , and hundreds of stars shone keenly bright in all quarters of the sky . Unconsciously I steered my course towards the country ; I had got into Grove - street , and began to feel the pleasure of seeing dim trees at the extremity , round a suburban house , when a person leaning over the iron gate of one of the small gardens which front the neat dwelling - houses in this street , addressed me as I was hurrying with quick stride past . “
10521	10562	10563	10563	You	435	” I stopped short , and looked towards the speaker . I smelt the fragrance , and saw the red spark of a cigar ; the dusk outline of a man , too , bent towards me over the wicket . “
10574	10579	10565	10565	I	0	” continued this shade . “
10626	10646	10610	10610	Fate	121	” The voice was familiar to me — its second utterance enabled me to seize the speaker ’s identity . “
10653	10654	10647	10648	Mr. Hunsden	109	” “
10682	10683	10671	10671	I	0	” “
10690	10691	10688	10688	you	435	” “
10724	10725	10719	10720	the police	438	” “
10744	10745	10734	10734	I	0	” “
10802	10803	10799	10800	the devil	441	” “
10815	10816	10808	10808	I	0	” “
10932	10942	10944	10944	you	441	” He swung the wicket open as he spoke . “
10952	10956	10944	10944	you	441	” I asked . “
11004	11314	10997	10997	I	0	” It suited me to accept the invitation as it suited Hunsden to give it . I passed through the gate , and followed him to the front door , which he opened ; thence we traversed a passage , and entered his parlour ; the door being shut , he pointed me to an arm - chair by the hearth ; I sat down , and glanced round me . It was a comfortable room , at once snug and handsome ; the bright grate was filled with a genuine — — shire fire , red , clear , and generous , no penurious South - of - England embers heaped in the corner of a grate . On the table a shaded lamp diffused around a soft , pleasant , and equal light ; the furniture was almost luxurious for a young bachelor , comprising a couch and two very easy chairs ; bookshelves filled the recesses on each side of the mantelpiece ; they were well - furnished , and arranged with perfect order . The neatness of the room suited my taste ; I hate irregular and slovenly habits . From what I saw I concluded that Hunsden ’s ideas on that point corresponded with my own . While he removed from the centre - table to the side - board a few pamphlets and periodicals , I ran my eye along the shelves of the book - case nearest me . French and German works predominated , the old French dramatists , sundry modern authors , Thiers , Villemain , Paul de Kock , George Sand , Eugene Sue ; in German — Goethe , Schiller , Zschokke , Jean Paul Richter ; in English there were works on Political Economy . I examined no further , for Mr. Hunsden himself recalled my attention . “
11320	11324	11315	11315	You	448	” said he , “
11398	11451	11457	11458	Mr. Hunsden	109	” Here again Hunsden suited me : if there was one generally received practice I abhorred more than another , it was the habitual imbibing of spirits and strong wines . I had , however , no fancy for his acid German nectar , but I liked coffee , so I responded — “
11460	11804	11457	11458	Mr. Hunsden	109	” I perceived my answer pleased him ; he had doubtless expected to see a chilling effect produced by his steady announcement that he would give me neither wine nor spirits ; he just shot one searching glance at my face to ascertain whether my cordiality was genuine or a mere feint of politeness . I smiled , because I quite understood him ; and , while I honoured his conscientious firmness , I was amused at his mistrust ; he seemed satisfied , rang the bell , and ordered coffee , which was presently brought ; for himself , a bunch of grapes and half a pint of something sour sufficed . My coffee was excellent ; I told him so , and expressed the shuddering pity with which his anchorite fare inspired me . He did not answer , and I scarcely think heard my remark . At that moment one of those momentary eclipses I before alluded to had come over his face , extinguishing his smile , and replacing , by an abstracted and alienated look , the customarily shrewd , bantering glance of his eye . I employed the interval of silence in a rapid scrutiny of his physiognomy . I had never observed him closely before ; and , as my sight is very short , I had gathered only a vague , general idea of his appearance ; I was surprised now , on examination , to perceive how small , and even feminine , were his lineaments ; his tall figure , long and dark locks , his voice and general bearing , had impressed me with the notion of something powerful and massive ; not at all:—my own features were cast in a harsher and squarer mould than his . I discerned that there would be contrasts between his inward and outward man ; contentions , too ; for I suspected his soul had more of will and ambition than his body had of fibre and muscle . Perhaps , in these incompatibilities of the “
11806	11809	11457	11458	Mr. Hunsden	109	” with the “
11812	12008	12009	12009	William	101	” lay the secret of that fitful gloom ; he would but could not , and the athletic mind scowled scorn on its more fragile companion . As to his good looks , I should have liked to have a woman ’s opinion on that subject ; it seemed to me that his face might produce the same effect on a lady that a very piquant and interesting , though scarcely pretty , female face would on a man . I have mentioned his dark locks — they were brushed sideways above a white and sufficiently expansive forehead ; his cheek had a rather hectic freshness ; his features might have done well on canvas , but indifferently in marble : they were plastic ; character had set a stamp upon each ; expression re - cast them at her pleasure , and strange metamorphoses she wrought , giving him now the mien of a morose bull , and anon that of an arch and mischievous girl ; more frequently , the two semblances were blent , and a queer , composite countenance they made . Starting from his silent fit , he began : — “
12044	12045	12046	12046	I	0	” “
12055	12056	12046	12046	I	0	” “
12098	12099	12100	12100	I	0	” “
12105	12106	12100	12100	I	0	” “
12191	12192	12194	12194	you	101	” “
12199	12200	12194	12194	you	101	” “
12249	12250	12244	12244	he	353	” “
12261	12262	12253	12253	you	101	” “
12432	12433	12436	12437	Mr. Hunsden	109	” “
12442	12443	12444	12444	I	0	” “
12605	12837	12599	12599	Juggernaut	130	” Mr. Hunsden ’s eloquence was not , it will be perceived , of the smooth and oily order . As he spoke , he pleased me ill . I seem to recognize in him one of those characters who , sensitive enough themselves , are selfishly relentless towards the sensitiveness of others . Moreover , though he was neither like Crimsworth nor Lord Tynedale , yet he was acrid , and , I suspected , overbearing in his way : there was a tone of despotism in the urgency of the very reproaches by which he aimed at goading the oppressed into rebellion against the oppressor . Looking at him still more fixedly than I had yet done , I saw written in his eye and mien a resolution to arrogate to himself a freedom so unlimited that it might often trench on the just liberty of his neighbours . I rapidly ran over these thoughts , and then I laughed a low and involuntary laugh , moved thereto by a slight inward revelation of the inconsistency of man . It was as I thought : Hunsden had expected me to take with calm his incorrect and offensive surmises , his bitter and haughty taunts ; and himself was chafed by a laugh , scarce louder than a whisper . His brow darkened , his thin nostril dilated a little . “
12840	12844	12599	12599	Juggernaut	130	” he began , “
13056	13148	13149	13149	You	467	” The first part of Hunsden ’s speech moved me not at all , or , if it did , it was only to wonder at the perversion into which prejudice had twisted his judgment of my character ; the concluding sentence , however , not only moved , but shook me ; the blow it gave was a severe one , because Truth wielded the weapon . If I smiled now , it , was only in disdain of myself . Hunsden saw his advantage ; he followed it up . “
13156	13160	13149	13149	You	467	” continued he ; “
13202	13203	13204	13204	I	0	” “
13219	13225	13214	13217	those who devise them	482	” said I , rising . “
13232	13238	13239	13240	What widow	483	” he went on coolly . “
13302	13367	13271	13271	You	467	” Mr. Hunsden had taken his tone for the night ; the string he struck was out of tune , he would finger no other . Averse to discord , of which I had enough every day and all day long , I concluded , at last , that silence and solitude were preferable to jarring converse ; I bade him good - night . “
13388	13749	13382	13382	you	467	” And he sat still in front of the fire , while I left the room and the house . I had got a good way on my return to my lodgings before I found out that I was walking very fast , and breathing very hard , and that my nails were almost stuck into the palms of my clenched hands , and that my teeth were set fast ; on making this discovery , I relaxed both my pace , fists , and jaws , but I could not so soon cause the regrets rushing rapidly through my mind to slacken their tide . Why did I make myself a tradesman ? Why did I enter Hunsden ’s house this evening ? Why , at dawn to - morrow , must I repair to Crimsworth ’s mill ? All that night did I ask myself these questions , and all that night fiercely demanded of my soul an answer . I got no sleep ; my head burned , my feet froze ; at last the factory bells rang , and I sprang from my bed with other slaves . THERE is a climax to everything , to every state of feeling as well as to every position in life . I turned this truism over in my mind as , in the frosty dawn of a January morning , I hurried down the steep and now icy street which descended from Mrs. King ’s to the Close . The factory workpeople had preceded me by nearly an hour , and the mill was all lighted up and in full operation when I reached it . I repaired to my post in the counting - house as usual ; the fire there , but just lit , as yet only smoked ; Steighton had not yet arrived . I shut the door and sat down at the desk ; my hands , recently washed in half - frozen water , were still numb ; I could not write till they had regained vitality , so I went on thinking , and still the theme of my thoughts was the “
13752	13764	13382	13382	you	467	” Self - dissatisfaction troubled exceedingly the current of my meditations . “
13770	13785	13767	13768	William Crimsworth	103	” said my conscience , or whatever it is that within ourselves takes ourselves to task—“come
14175	14176	14166	14166	your	488	” “
14184	14189	14190	14190	I	0	” said I sullenly : “
14201	14202	14195	14195	I	0	” “
14207	14213	14195	14195	I	0	” reiterated the inward voice . “
14224	14476	14195	14195	I	0	” I growled ; but nevertheless I drew out a packet of letters and commenced my task — task thankless and bitter as that of the Israelite crawling over the sun - baked fields of Egypt in search of straw and stubble wherewith to accomplish his tale of bricks . About ten o’clock I heard Mr. Crimsworth ’s gig turn into the yard , and in a minute or two he entered the counting - house . It was his custom to glance his eye at Steighton and myself , to hang up his mackintosh , stand a minute with his back to the fire , and then walk out . Today he did not deviate from his usual habits ; the only difference was that when he looked at me , his brow , instead of being merely hard , was surly ; his eye , instead of being cold , was fierce . He studied me a minute or two longer than usual , but went out in silence . Twelve o’clock arrived ; the bell rang for a suspension of labour ; the workpeople went off to their dinners ; Steighton , too , departed , desiring me to lock the counting - house door , and take the key with me . I was tying up a bundle of papers , and putting them in their place , preparatory to closing my desk , when Crimsworth reappeared at the door , and entering closed it behind him . “
14484	14542	14477	14477	You	506	” said he , in a deep , brutal voice , while his nostrils distended and his eye shot a spark of sinister fire . Alone with Edward I remembered our relationship , and remembering that forgot the difference of position ; I put away deference and careful forms of speech ; I answered with simple brevity . “
14550	14561	14562	14562	You	506	” I said , turning the key in my desk . “
14567	14571	14562	14562	You	506	” he reiterated . “
14586	14587	14562	14562	You	506	” “
14590	14593	14562	14562	You	506	” asked I. “
14604	14605	14608	14608	I	0	” “
14611	14616	14608	14608	I	0	” was the answer , “
14636	14663	14631	14631	you	506	” He was going on in the same breath , when an abrupt pause announced that rage had for the moment got the better of articulation . “
14674	14678	14664	14664	You	506	” I replied . “
14690	14691	14698	14698	you	506	” “
14702	14703	14698	14698	you	506	” “
14713	14714	14698	14698	you	506	” “
14726	14772	14719	14724	Smooth - faced , snivelling greasehorn	511	” ( This last term is , I believe , purely — — shire , and alludes to the horn of black , rancid whale - oil , usually to be seen suspended to cart - wheels , and employed for greasing the same . ) “
14824	14825	14816	14817	another clerk	512	” “
14843	14908	14909	14909	I	0	” He took down the heavy gig whip hanging beside his mackintosh . I permitted myself to laugh with a degree of scorn I took no pains to temper or hide . His fury boiled up , and when he had sworn half - a - dozen vulgar , impious oaths , without , however , venturing to lift the whip , he continued : “
14942	14943	14944	14944	You	99	” “
14957	14958	14959	14959	You	99	” “
15048	15107	15034	15034	I	0	” He flourished his tool . The end of the lash just touched my forehead . A warm excited thrill ran through my veins , my blood seemed to give a bound , and then raced fast and hot along its channels . I got up nimbly , came round to where he stood , and faced him . “
15113	15117	15110	15110	your	0	” said I , “
15126	15127	15128	15128	Sirrah	137	” “
15136	15137	15128	15128	Sirrah	137	” “
15175	15199	15169	15169	your	99	” Crimsworth had no dignity , and when I sternly demanded an explanation , he gave one in a loud , scolding voice . “
15379	15380	15376	15376	you	99	” “
15430	15431	15432	15432	Sirrah	137	” “
15436	15492	15432	15432	Sirrah	137	” reiterated Crimsworth ; and to complete his apostrophe , he cracked the whip straight over my head . A minute sufficed to wrest it from him , break it in two pieces , and throw it under the grate . He made a headlong rush at me , which I evaded , and said — “
15507	15611	15497	15497	I	0	” Men like Crimsworth , if firmly and calmly resisted , always abate something of their exorbitant insolence ; he had no mind to be brought before a magistrate , and I suppose he saw I meant what I said . After an odd and long stare at me , at once bull - like and amazed , he seemed to bethink himself that , after all , his money gave him sufficient superiority over a beggar like me , and that he had in his hands a surer and more dignified mode of revenge than the somewhat hazardous one of personal chastisement . “
15616	15620	15497	15497	I	0	” said he . “
15693	15694	15687	15688	a man	353	” “
15752	15753	15757	15757	I	0	” “
15762	15803	15757	15757	I	0	” exclaimed Crimsworth . I walked deliberately to my desk , took out such of its contents as were my own property , put them in my pocket , locked the desk , and placed the key on the top . “
15812	15817	15806	15806	you	99	” demanded the millowner . “
15836	15837	15830	15831	a policeman	536	” “
15845	16629	15830	15831	a policeman	536	” said I , and I took down my hat , drew on my gloves , and walked leisurely out of the counting - house — walked out of it to enter it no more . I recollect that when the mill - bell rang the dinner hour , before Mr. Crimsworth entered , and the scene above related took place , I had had rather a sharp appetite , and had been waiting somewhat impatiently to hear the signal of feeding time . I forgot it now , however ; the images of potatoes and roast mutton were effaced from my mind by the stir and tumult which the transaction of the last half - hour had there excited . I only thought of walking , that the action of my muscles might harmonize with the action of my nerves ; and walk I did , fast and far . How could I do otherwise ? A load was lifted off my heart ; I felt light and liberated . I had got away from Bigben Close without a breach of resolution ; without injury to my self - respect . I had not forced circumstances ; circumstances had freed me . Life was again open to me ; no longer was its horizon limited by the high black wall surrounding Crimsworth ’s mill . Two hours had elapsed before my sensations had so far subsided as to leave me calm enough to remark for what wider and clearer boundaries I had exchanged that sooty girdle . When I did look up , lo ! straight before me lay Grovetown , a village of villas about five miles out of X——. The short winter day , as I perceived from the far - declined sun , was already approaching its close ; a chill frost - mist was rising from the river on which X — — stands , and along whose banks the road I had taken lay ; it dimmed the earth , but did not obscure the clear icy blue of the January sky . There was a great stillness near and far ; the time of the day favoured tranquillity , as the people were all employed within - doors , the hour of evening release from the factories not being yet arrived ; a sound of full - flowing water alone pervaded the air , for the river was deep and abundant , swelled by the melting of a late snow . I stood awhile , leaning over a wall ; and looking down at the current : I watched the rapid rush of its waves . I desired memory to take a clear and permanent impression of the scene , and treasure it for future years . Grovetown church clock struck four ; looking up , I beheld the last of that day ’s sun , glinting red through the leafless boughs of some very old oak trees surrounding the church — its light coloured and characterized the picture as I wished . I paused yet a moment , till the sweet , slow sound of the bell had quite died out of the air ; then ear , eye and feeling satisfied , I quitted the wall and once more turned my face towards X——. I RE - ENTERED the town a hungry man ; the dinner I had forgotten recurred seductively to my recollection ; and it was with a quick step and sharp appetite I ascended the narrow street leading to my lodgings . It was dark when I opened the front door and walked into the house . I wondered how my fire would be ; the night was cold , and I shuddered at the prospect of a grate full of sparkless cinders . To my joyful surprise , I found , on entering my sitting - room , a good fire and a clean hearth . I had hardly noticed this phenomenon , when I became aware of another subject for wonderment ; the chair I usually occupied near the hearth was already filled ; a person sat there with his arms folded on his chest , and his legs stretched out on the rug . Short - sighted as I am , doubtful as was the gleam of the firelight , a moment ’s examination enabled me to recognize in this person my acquaintance , Mr. Hunsden . I could not of course be much pleased to see him , considering the manner in which I had parted from him the night before , and as I walked to the hearth , stirred the fire , and said coolly , “
16633	16740	16741	16741	You	537	” my demeanour evinced as little cordiality as I felt ; yet I wondered in my own mind what had brought him there ; and I wondered , also , what motives had induced him to interfere so actively between me and Edward ; it was to him , it appeared , that I owed my welcome dismissal ; still I could not bring myself to ask him questions , to show any eagerness of curiosity ; if he chose to explain , he might , but the explanation should be a perfectly voluntary one on his part ; I thought he was entering upon it . “
16749	16755	16757	16757	I	0	” were his first words . “
16759	16763	16757	16757	I	0	” said I ; “
16789	16790	16793	16793	yourself	537	” “
16856	16857	16853	16853	you	537	” “
16877	16890	16872	16872	I	0	” I rang the bell and ordered tea and some cold meat . “
16894	16905	16872	16872	I	0	” exclaimed Hunsden , as the servant closed the door , “
16926	16927	16930	16931	Mr. Hunsden	109	” “
16937	16969	16930	16931	Mr. Hunsden	109	” I felt a necessity for contradicting him ; I was irritated with hunger , and irritated at seeing him there , and irritated at the continued roughness of his manner . “
16983	16987	16930	16931	Mr. Hunsden	109	” said he . “
16993	16997	16990	16990	you	109	” I demanded . “
17025	17047	17019	17019	I	0	” What I said was petulant and snappish enough , and Hunsden only replied by looking in my face and laughing . “
17051	17059	17019	17019	I	0	” he whined , after a pause . “
17095	17096	17083	17083	Crimsworth	99	” “
17102	17169	17099	17100	Mr. Hunsden	109	” Fortunately at this sulky juncture , tea , was brought in , and I fell to upon some bread and butter and cold beef directly . Having cleared a plateful , I became so far humanized as to intimate to Mr. Hunsden that he need not sit there staring , but might come to the table and do as I did , if he liked . “
17179	17214	17171	17171	I	0	” said he , and therewith he summoned the servant by a fresh pull of the bell - rope , and intimated a desire to have a glass of toast - and - water . “
17220	17224	17171	17171	I	0	” he added ; “
17236	17258	17225	17226	Mr. Crimsworth	99	” His orders being executed , he wheeled his chair round to the table , so as to be opposite me . “
17261	17265	17225	17226	Mr. Crimsworth	99	” he proceeded . “
17275	17276	17272	17272	I	0	” “
17279	17325	17272	17272	I	0	” said I ; and not disposed to show the satisfaction I felt on this point , I , yielding to the whim of the moment , took up the subject as though I considered myself aggrieved rather than benefited by what had been done . “
17359	17360	17365	17365	he	99	” “
17392	17393	17381	17381	he	99	” “
17401	17402	17394	17394	He	99	” “
17627	17678	17613	17613	I	0	” Now this speech interested me much , both because it brought out Hunsden ’s character , and because it explained his motives ; it interested me so much that I forgot to reply to it , and sat silent , pondering over a throng of ideas it had suggested . “
17685	17789	17790	17795	a dry - hearted aristocratic scamp	560	” he asked , presently . In fact I was grateful , or almost so , and I believe I half liked him at the moment , notwithstanding his proviso that what he had done was not out of regard for me . But human nature is perverse . Impossible to answer his blunt question in the affirmative , so I disclaimed all tendency to gratitude , and advised him if he expected any reward for his championship , to look for it in a better world , as he was not likely to meet with it here . In reply he termed me “
17797	17813	17790	17795	a dry - hearted aristocratic scamp	560	” whereupon I again charged him with having taken the bread out of my mouth . “
17821	17823	17790	17795	a dry - hearted aristocratic scamp	560	” cried Hunsden—“dirty
17866	17867	17860	17861	a tyrant	535	” “

17904	17908	17898	17898	you	561	” rejoined Hunsden . “

18196	18227	18187	18188	a stranger	575	” I could not repress a half - smile as I said this ; a similar demi - manifestation of feeling appeared at the same moment on Hunsden ’s lips . “
18233	18283	18187	18188	a stranger	575	” said he , looking into my eyes , and it was evident he did see right down into my heart . Having sat a minute or two with his chin resting on his hand , diligently occupied in the continued perusal of my countenance , he went on : “

18656	18664	18665	18665	I	0	” He stretched himself and again yawned . “

19152	19196	19148	19148	I	0	” and I produced writing materials with alacrity ; for I guessed what he was going to do . He sat down , wrote a few lines , folded , sealed , and addressed a letter , and held it out to me . “
19293	19294	19302	19302	I	0	” “
19305	19313	19302	19302	I	0	” said I , taking the epistle . “

19600	19662	19594	19595	The lad	616	” said Hunsden , and taking his hat from a sideboard , he left the room , laughing to himself . I had half an inclination to follow him : I really intended to leave X — — the next morning , and should certainly not have another opportunity of bidding him good - bye . The front door banged to . “
19667	19671	19594	19595	The lad	616	” said I , “
19679	21557	19594	19595	The lad	616	” READER , perhaps you were never in Belgium ? Haply you do n’t know the physiognomy of the country ? You have not its lineaments defined upon your memory , as I have them on mine ? Three — nay four — pictures line the four - walled cell where are stored for me the records of the past . First , Eton . All in that picture is in far perspective , receding , diminutive ; but freshly coloured , green , dewy , with a spring sky , piled with glittering yet showery clouds ; for my childhood was not all sunshine — it had its overcast , its cold , its stormy hours . Second , X — — , huge , dingy ; the canvas cracked and smoked ; a yellow sky , sooty clouds ; no sun , no azure ; the verdure of the suburbs blighted and sullied — a very dreary scene . Third , Belgium ; and I will pause before this landscape . As to the fourth , a curtain covers it , which I may hereafter withdraw , or may not , as suits my convenience and capacity . At any rate , for the present it must hang undisturbed . Belgium ! name unromantic and unpoetic , yet name that whenever uttered has in my ear a sound , in my heart an echo , such as no other assemblage of syllables , however sweet or classic , can produce . Belgium ! I repeat the word , now as I sit alone near midnight . It stirs my world of the past like a summons to resurrection ; the graves unclose , the dead are raised ; thoughts , feelings , memories that slept , are seen by me ascending from the clouds — haloed most of them — but while I gaze on their vapoury forms , and strive to ascertain definitely their outline , the sound which wakened them dies , and they sink , each and all , like a light wreath of mist , absorbed in the mould , recalled to urns , resealed in monuments . Farewell , luminous phantoms ! This is Belgium , reader . Look ! do n’t call the picture a flat or a dull one — it was neither flat nor dull to me when I first beheld it . When I left Ostend on a mild February morning , and found myself on the road to Brussels , nothing could look vapid to me . My sense of enjoyment possessed an edge whetted to the finest , untouched , keen , exquisite . I was young ; I had good health ; pleasure and I had never met ; no indulgence of hers had enervated or sated one faculty of my nature . Liberty I clasped in my arms for the first time , and the influence of her smile and embrace revived my life like the sun and the west wind . Yes , at that epoch I felt like a morning traveller who doubts not that from the hill he is ascending he shall behold a glorious sunrise ; what if the track be strait , steep , and stony ? he sees it not ; his eyes are fixed on that summit , flushed already , flushed and gilded , and having gained it he is certain of the scene beyond . He knows that the sun will face him , that his chariot is even now coming over the eastern horizon , and that the herald breeze he feels on his cheek is opening for the god ’s career a clear , vast path of azure , amidst clouds soft as pearl and warm as flame . Difficulty and toil were to be my lot , but sustained by energy , drawn on by hopes as bright as vague , I deemed such a lot no hardship . I mounted now the hill in shade ; there were pebbles , inequalities , briars in my path , but my eyes were fixed on the crimson peak above ; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament beyond , and I thought nothing of the stones turning under my feet , or of the thorns scratching my face and hands . I gazed often , and always with delight , from the window of the diligence ( these , be it remembered , were not the days of trains and railroads ) . Well ! and what did I see ? I will tell you faithfully . Green , reedy swamps ; fields fertile but flat , cultivated in patches that made them look like magnified kitchen - gardens ; belts of cut trees , formal as pollard willows , skirting the horizon ; narrow canals , gliding slow by the road - side ; painted Flemish farmhouses ; some very dirty hovels ; a gray , dead sky ; wet road , wet fields , wet house - tops : not a beautiful , scarcely a picturesque object met my eye along the whole route ; yet to me , all was beautiful , all was more than picturesque . It continued fair so long as daylight lasted , though the moisture of many preceding damp days had sodden the whole country ; as it grew dark , however , the rain recommenced , and it was through streaming and starless darkness my eye caught the first gleam of the lights of Brussels . I saw little of the city but its lights that night . Having alighted from the diligence , a fiacre conveyed me to the Hotel de — — , where I had been advised by a fellow - traveller to put up ; having eaten a traveller ’s supper , I retired to bed , and slept a traveller ’s sleep . Next morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the impression that I was yet in X — — , and perceiving it to be broad daylight I started up , imagining that I had overslept myself and should be behind time at the counting - house . The momentary and painful sense of restraint vanished before the revived and reviving consciousness of freedom , as , throwing back the white curtains of my bed , I looked forth into a wide , lofty foreign chamber ; how different from the small and dingy , though not uncomfortable , apartment I had occupied for a night or two at a respectable inn in London while waiting for the sailing of the packet ! Yet far be it from me to profane the memory of that little dingy room ! It , too , is dear to my soul ; for there , as I lay in quiet and darkness , I first heard the great bell of St. Paul ’s telling London it was midnight , and well do I recall the deep , deliberate tones , so full charged with colossal phlegm and force . From the small , narrow window of that room , I first saw the dome , looming through a London mist . I suppose the sensations , stirred by those first sounds , first sights , are felt but once ; treasure them , Memory ; seal them in urns , and keep them in safe niches ! Well — I rose . Travellers talk of the apartments in foreign dwellings being bare and uncomfortable ; I thought my chamber looked stately and cheerful . It had such large windows — croisées that opened like doors , with such broad , clear panes of glass ; such a great looking - glass stood on my dressing - table — such a fine mirror glittered over the mantelpiece — the painted floor looked so clean and glossy ; when I had dressed and was descending the stairs , the broad marble steps almost awed me , and so did the lofty hall into which they conducted . On the first landing I met a Flemish housemaid : she had wooden shoes , a short red petticoat , a printed cotton bedgown , her face was broad , her physiognomy eminently stupid ; when I spoke to her in French , she answered me in Flemish , with an air the reverse of civil ; yet I thought her charming ; if she was not pretty or polite , she was , I conceived , very picturesque ; she reminded me of the female figures in certain Dutch paintings I had seen in other years at Seacombe Hall . I repaired to the public room ; that , too , was very large and very lofty , and warmed by a stove ; the floor was black , and the stove was black , and most of the furniture was black : yet I never experienced a freer sense of exhilaration than when I sat down at a very long , black table ( covered , however , in part by a white cloth ) , and , having ordered breakfast , began to pour out my coffee from a little black coffee - pot . The stove might be dismal - looking to some eyes , not to mine , but it was indisputably very warm , and there were two gentlemen seated by it talking in French ; impossible to follow their rapid utterance , or comprehend much of the purport of what they said — yet French , in the mouths of Frenchmen , or Belgians ( I was not then sensible of the horrors of the Belgian accent ) was as music to my ears . One of these gentlemen presently discerned me to be an Englishman — no doubt from the fashion in which I addressed the waiter ; for I would persist in speaking French in my execrable South - of - England style , though the man understood English . The gentleman , after looking towards me once or twice , politely accosted me in very good English ; I remember I wished to God that I could speak French as well ; his fluency and correct pronunciation impressed me for the first time with a due notion of the cosmopolitan character of the capital I was in ; it was my first experience of that skill in living languages I afterwards found to be so general in Brussels . I lingered over my breakfast as long as I could ; while it was there on the table , and while that stranger continued talking to me , I was a free , independent traveller ; but at last the things were removed , the two gentlemen left the room ; suddenly the illusion ceased , reality and business came back . I , a bondsman just released from the yoke , freed for one week from twenty - one years of constraint , must , of necessity , resume the fetters of dependency . Hardly had I tasted the delight of being without a master when duty issued her stern mandate : “
21565	21699	21700	21701	Mr. Brown	133	” I never linger over a painful and necessary task ; I never take pleasure before business , it is not in my nature to do so ; impossible to enjoy a leisurely walk over the city , though I perceived the morning was very fine , until I had first presented Mr. Hunsden ’s letter of introduction , and got fairly on to the track of a new situation . Wrenching my mind from liberty and delight , I seized my hat , and forced my reluctant body out of the Hotel de — — into the foreign street . It was a fine day , but I would not look at the blue sky or at the stately houses round me ; my mind was bent on one thing , finding out “
21709	21815	21700	21701	Mr. Brown	133	” for so my letter was addressed . By dint of inquiry I succeeded ; I stood at last at the desired door , knocked , asked for Mr. Brown , and was admitted . Being shown into a small breakfast - room , I found myself in the presence of an elderly gentleman — very grave , business - like , and respectable - looking . I presented Mr. Hunsden ’s letter ; he received me very civilly . After a little desultory conversation he asked me if there was anything in which his advice or experience could be of use . I said , “
21818	21906	21907	21907	Clerk	619	” and then proceeded to tell him that I was not a gentleman of fortune , travelling for pleasure , but an ex - counting - house clerk , who wanted employment of some kind , and that immediately too . He replied that as a friend of Mr. Hunsden ’s he would be willing to assist me as well as he could . After some meditation he named a place in a mercantile house at Liege , and another in a bookseller ’s shop at Louvain . “
21911	21917	21909	21909	shopman	620	” murmured I to myself . “
21920	21958	21909	21909	shopman	620	” I shook my head . I had tried the high stool ; I hated it ; I believed there were other occupations that would suit me better ; besides I did not wish to leave Brussels . “
21967	21972	21909	21909	shopman	620	” answered Mr. Brown , “
22007	22020	21989	22005	the director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of English and Latin	623	” I thought two minutes , then I seized the idea eagerly . “
22027	22030	21989	22005	the director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of English and Latin	623	” said I. “
22033	22037	22039	22039	you	622	” asked he , “
22050	22090	22039	22039	you	622	” Fortunately I could answer this question in the affirmative ; having studied French under a Frenchman , I could speak the language intelligibly though not fluently . I could also read it well , and write it decently . “
22093	22098	22039	22039	you	622	” pursued Mr. Brown , “
22138	22141	22142	22142	professor	628	” The word “
22143	22147	22148	22148	I	0	” struck me . “
22154	22157	22148	22148	I	0	” said I. “
22160	22165	22166	22166	professor	628	” returned Mr. Brown , “
22180	22407	22173	22174	a teacher	631	” My conscience thus quieted , I thanked Mr. Brown , and , for the present , withdrew . This time I stepped out into the street with a relieved heart ; the task I had imposed on myself for that day was executed . I might now take some hours of holiday . I felt free to look up . For the first time I remarked the sparkling clearness of the air , the deep blue of the sky , the gay clean aspect of the white - washed or painted houses ; I saw what a fine street was the Rue Royale , and , walking leisurely along its broad pavement , I continued to survey its stately hotels , till the palisades , the gates , and trees of the park appearing in sight , offered to my eye a new attraction . I remember , before entering the park , I stood awhile to contemplate the statue of General Belliard , and then I advanced to the top of the great staircase just beyond , and I looked down into a narrow back street , which I afterwards learnt was called the Rue d’Isabelle . I well recollect that my eye rested on the green door of a rather large house opposite , where , on a brass plate , was inscribed , “
22412	22551	22173	22174	a teacher	631	” Pensionnat ! The word excited an uneasy sensation in my mind ; it seemed to speak of restraint . Some of the demoiselles , externats no doubt , were at that moment issuing from the door — I looked for a pretty face amongst them , but their close , little French bonnets hid their features ; in a moment they were gone . I had traversed a good deal of Brussels before five o’clock arrived , but punctually as that hour struck I was again in the Rue Royale . Re - admitted to Mr. Brown ’s breakfast - room , I found him , as before , seated at the table , and he was not alone — a gentleman stood by the hearth . Two words of introduction designated him as my future master . “
22564	22679	22561	22562	M. Pelet	146	” a bow on each side finished the ceremony . I do n’t know what sort of a bow I made ; an ordinary one , I suppose , for I was in a tranquil , commonplace frame of mind ; I felt none of the agitation which had troubled my first interview with Edward Crimsworth . M. Pelet ’s bow was extremely polite , yet not theatrical , scarcely French ; he and I were presently seated opposite to each other . In a pleasing voice , low , and , out of consideration to my foreign ears , very distinct and deliberate , M. Pelet intimated that he had just been receiving from “
22685	22772	22680	22683	le respectable M. Brown	147	” an account of my attainments and character , which relieved him from all scruple as to the propriety of engaging me as professor of English and Latin in his establishment ; nevertheless , for form ’s sake , he would put a few questions to test my powers . He did , and expressed in flattering terms his satisfaction at my answers . The subject of salary next came on ; it was fixed at one thousand francs per annum , besides board and lodging . “
22777	22782	22561	22562	M. Pelet	146	” suggested M. Pelet , “
22826	23010	22680	22683	le respectable M. Brown	147	” I thought this very kind , and indeed I found afterwards that the terms on which M. Pelet had engaged me were really liberal for Brussels ; instruction being extremely cheap there on account of the number of teachers . It was further arranged that I should be installed in my new post the very next day , after which M. Pelet and I parted . Well , and what was he like ? and what were my impressions concerning him ? He was a man of about forty years of age , of middle size , and rather emaciated figure ; his face was pale , his cheeks were sunk , and his eyes hollow ; his features were pleasing and regular , they had a French turn ( for M. Pelet was no Fleming , but a Frenchman both by birth and parentage ) , yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments was , in his case , softened by a mild blue eye , and a melancholy , almost suffering , expression of countenance ; his physiognomy was “
23015	23272	22680	22683	le respectable M. Brown	147	” I use two French words because they define better than any English terms the species of intelligence with which his features were imbued . He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing personage . I wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary characteristics of his profession , and almost feared he could not be stern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster . Externally at least M. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master , Edward Crimsworth . Influenced by the impression I had received of his gentleness , I was a good deal surprised when , on arriving the next day at my new employer ’s house , and being admitted to a first view of what was to be the sphere of my future labours , namely the large , lofty , and well - lighted schoolrooms , I beheld a numerous assemblage of pupils , boys of course , whose collective appearance showed all the signs of a full , flourishing , and well - disciplined seminary . As I traversed the classes in company with M. Pelet , a profound silence reigned on all sides , and if by chance a murmur or a whisper arose , one glance from the pensive eye of this most gentle pedagogue stilled it instantly . It was astonishing , I thought , how so mild a check could prove so effectual . When I had perambulated the length and breadth of the classes , M. Pelet turned and said to me — “
23291	23381	23382	23382	Messieurs	637	” The proposal was unexpected . I had thought I should have been allowed at least three days to prepare ; but it is a bad omen to commence any career by hesitation , so I just stepped to the professor ’s desk near which we stood , and faced the circle of my pupils . I took a moment to collect my thoughts , and likewise to frame in French the sentence by which I proposed to open business . I made it as short as possible : — “
23390	23391	23382	23382	Messieurs	637	” “
23398	23419	23396	23396	monsieur	638	” demanded a thickset , moon - faced young Flamand in a blouse . The answer was fortunately easy : — “
23422	23498	23396	23396	monsieur	638	” I determined to give myself as little trouble as possible in this lesson ; it would not do yet to trust my unpractised tongue with the delivery of explanations ; my accent and idiom would be too open to the criticisms of the young gentlemen before me , relative to whom I felt already it would be necessary at once to take up an advantageous position , and I proceeded to employ means accordingly . “
23501	23535	23396	23396	monsieur	638	” cried I , when they had all produced their books . The moon - faced youth ( by name Jules Vanderkelkov , as I afterwards learnt ) took the first sentence . The “
23539	23542	23382	23382	Messieurs	637	” was the “
23547	23673	23382	23382	Messieurs	637	” much used in foreign schools because it is supposed to contain prime samples of conversational English ; it might , however , have been a Runic scroll for any resemblance the words , as enunciated by Jules , bore to the language in ordinary use amongst the natives of Great Britain . My God ! how he did snuffle , snort , and wheeze ! All he said was said in his throat and nose , for it is thus the Flamands speak , but I heard him to the end of his paragraph without proffering a word of correction , whereat he looked vastly self - complacent , convinced , no doubt , that he had acquitted himself like a real born and bred “
23676	23711	23382	23382	Messieurs	637	” In the same unmoved silence I listened to a dozen in rotation , and when the twelfth had concluded with splutter , hiss , and mumble , I solemnly laid down the book . “
23714	23793	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” said I. There was a pause , during which I regarded them all with a steady and somewhat stern gaze ; a dog , if stared at hard enough and long enough , will show symptoms of embarrassment , and so at length did my bench of Belgians . Perceiving that some of the faces before me were beginning to look sullen , and others ashamed , I slowly joined my hands , and ejaculated in a deep “
23797	23799	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” — “
23804	23887	23890	23890	messieurs	637	” They looked at each other , pouted , coloured , swung their heels ; they were not pleased , I saw , but they were impressed , and in the way I wished them to be . Having thus taken them down a peg in their self - conceit , the next step was to raise myself in their estimation ; not a very easy thing , considering that I hardly dared to speak for fear of betraying my own deficiencies . “
23892	23946	23890	23890	messieurs	637	” said I , and I endeavoured to throw into my accents the compassionate tone of a superior being , who , touched by the extremity of the helplessness , which at first only excited his scorn , deigns at length to bestow aid . I then began at the very beginning of the “
23951	23997	23890	23890	messieurs	637	” and read , in a slow , distinct voice , some twenty pages , they all the while sitting mute and listening with fixed attention ; by the time I had done nearly an hour had elapsed . I then rose and said : — “
24016	24036	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” With this oracular sentence I bowed , and in company with M. Pelet quitted the school - room . “
24044	24054	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” said my principal as we entered his parlour . “
24081	24094	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” From the parlour M. Pelet conducted me to my apartment , my “
24097	24243	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” as Monsieur said with a certain air of complacency . It was a very small room , with an excessively small bed , but M. Pelet gave me to understand that I was to occupy it quite alone , which was of course a great comfort . Yet , though so limited in dimensions , it had two windows . Light not being taxed in Belgium , the people never grudge its admission into their houses ; just here , however , this observation is not very a propos , for one of these windows was boarded up ; the open windows looked into the boys ’ playground . I glanced at the other , as wondering what aspect it would present if disencumbered of the boards . M. Pelet read , I suppose , the expression of my eye ; he explained : — “
24258	24262	24003	24003	messieurs	637	” said he , “
24280	24281	24278	24278	monsieur	638	” “
24286	24458	24278	24278	monsieur	638	” was my reply , and I looked of course quite satisfied ; but when M. Pelet had retired and closed the door after him , the first thing I did was to scrutinize closely the nailed boards , hoping to find some chink or crevice which I might enlarge , and so get a peep at the consecrated ground . My researches were vain , for the boards were well joined and strongly nailed . It is astonishing how disappointed I felt . I thought it would have been so pleasant to have looked out upon a garden planted with flowers and trees , so amusing to have watched the demoiselles at their play ; to have studied female character in a variety of phases , myself the while sheltered from view by a modest muslin curtain , whereas , owing doubtless to the absurd scruples of some old duenna of a directress , I had now only the option of looking at a bare gravelled court , with an enormous “
24462	25447	25448	25449	The boy	644	” in the middle , and the monotonous walls and windows of a boys ’ school - house round . Not only then , but many a time after , especially in moments of weariness and low spirits , did I look with dissatisfied eyes on that most tantalizing board , longing to tear it away and get a glimpse of the green region which I imagined to lie beyond . I knew a tree grew close up to the window , for though there were as yet no leaves to rustle , I often heard at night the tapping of branches against the panes . In the daytime , when I listened attentively , I could hear , even through the boards , the voices of the demoiselles in their hours of recreation , and , to speak the honest truth , my sentimental reflections were occasionally a trifle disarranged by the not quite silvery , in fact the too often brazen sounds , which , rising from the unseen paradise below , penetrated clamorously into my solitude . Not to mince matters , it really seemed to me a doubtful case whether the lungs of Mdlle . Reuter ’s girls or those of M. Pelet ’s boys were the strongest , and when it came to shrieking the girls indisputably beat the boys hollow . I forgot to say , by - the - by , that Reuter was the name of the old lady who had had my window bearded up . I say old , for such I , of course , concluded her to be , judging from her cautious , chaperon - like proceedings ; besides , nobody ever spoke of her as young . I remember I was very much amused when I first heard her Christian name ; it was Zoraide — Mademoiselle Zoraide Reuter . But the continental nations do allow themselves vagaries in the choice of names , such as we sober English never run into . I think , indeed , we have too limited a list to choose from . Meantime my path was gradually growing smooth before me . I , in a few weeks , conquered the teasing difficulties inseparable from the commencement of almost every career . Ere long I had acquired as much facility in speaking French as set me at my ease with my pupils ; and as I had encountered them on a right footing at the very beginning , and continued tenaciously to retain the advantage I had early gained , they never attempted mutiny , which circumstance , all who are in any degree acquainted with the ongoings of Belgian schools , and who know the relation in which professors and pupils too frequently stand towards each other in those establishments , will consider an important and uncommon one . Before concluding this chapter I will say a word on the system I pursued with regard to my classes : my experience may possibly be of use to others . It did not require very keen observation to detect the character of the youth of Brabant , but it needed a certain degree of tact to adopt one ’s measures to their capacity . Their intellectual faculties were generally weak , their animal propensities strong ; thus there was at once an impotence and a kind of inert force in their natures ; they were dull , but they were also singularly stubborn , heavy as lead and , like lead , most difficult to move . Such being the case , it would have been truly absurd to exact from them much in the way of mental exertion ; having short memories , dense intelligence , feeble reflective powers , they recoiled with repugnance from any occupation that demanded close study or deep thought . Had the abhorred effort been extorted from them by injudicious and arbitrary measures on the part of the Professor , they would have resisted as obstinately , as clamorously , as desperate swine ; and though not brave singly , they were relentless acting en masse . I understood that before my arrival in M. Pelet ’s establishment , the combined insubordination of the pupils had effected the dismissal of more than one English master . It was necessary then to exact only the most moderate application from natures so little qualified to apply — to assist , in every practicable way , understandings so opaque and contracted — to be ever gentle , considerate , yielding even , to a certain point , with dispositions so irrationally perverse ; but , having reached that culminating point of indulgence , you must fix your foot , plant it , root it in rock — become immutable as the towers of Ste . Gudule ; for a step — but half a step farther , and you would plunge headlong into the gulf of imbecility ; there lodged , you would speedily receive proofs of Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low Country mud . You might smooth to the utmost the path of learning , remove every pebble from the track ; but then you must finally insist with decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself to be led quietly along the prepared road . When I had brought down my lesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil ’s capacity — when I had shown myself the mildest , the most tolerant of masters — a word of impertinence , a movement of disobedience , changed me at once into a despot . I offered then but one alternative — submission and acknowledgment of error , or ignominious expulsion . This system answered , and my influence , by degrees , became established on a firm basis . “
25456	25620	25448	25449	The boy	644	” it is said ; and so I often thought when looked at my boys and remembered the political history of their ancestors . Pelet ’s school was merely an epitome of the Belgian nation . AND Pelet himself ? How did I continue to like him ? Oh , extremely well ! Nothing could be more smooth , gentlemanlike , and even friendly , than his demeanour to me . I had to endure from him neither cold neglect , irritating interference , nor pretentious assumption of superiority . I fear , however , two poor , hard - worked Belgian ushers in the establishment could not have said as much ; to them the director ’s manner was invariably dry , stern , and cool . I believe he perceived once or twice that I was a little shocked at the difference he made between them and me , and accounted for it by saying , with a quiet sarcastic smile — “
25630	25966	25448	25449	The boy	644	” And then he took his cigar gently from his lips and spat on the painted floor of the room in which we were sitting . Flamands certainly they were , and both had the true Flamand physiognomy , where intellectual inferiority is marked in lines none can mistake ; still they were men , and , in the main , honest men ; and I could not see why their being aboriginals of the flat , dull soil should serve as a pretext for treating them with perpetual severity and contempt . This idea , of injustice somewhat poisoned the pleasure I might otherwise have derived from Pelet ’s soft affable manner to myself . Certainly it was agreeable , when the day ’s work was over , to find one ’s employer an intelligent and cheerful companion ; and if he was sometimes a little sarcastic and sometimes a little too insinuating , and if I did discover that his mildness was more a matter of appearance than of reality — if I did occasionally suspect the existence of flint or steel under an external covering of velvet — still we are none of us perfect ; and weary as I was of the atmosphere of brutality and insolence in which I had constantly lived at X — — , I had no inclination now , on casting anchor in calmer regions , to institute at once a prying search after defects that were scrupulously withdrawn and carefully veiled from my view . I was willing to take Pelet for what he seemed — to believe him benevolent and friendly until some untoward event should prove him otherwise . He was not married , and I soon perceived he had all a Frenchman ’s , all a Parisian ’s notions about matrimony and women . I suspected a degree of laxity in his code of morals , there was something so cold and blasé in his tone whenever he alluded to what he called “
25971	26339	25448	25449	The boy	644	” but he was too gentlemanlike to intrude topics I did not invite , and as he was really intelligent and really fond of intellectual subjects of discourse , he and I always found enough to talk about , without seeking themes in the mire . I hated his fashion of mentioning love ; I abhorred , from my soul , mere licentiousness . He felt the difference of our notions , and , by mutual consent , we kept off ground debateable . Pelet ’s house was kept and his kitchen managed by his mother , a real old Frenchwoman ; she had been handsome — at least she told me so , and I strove to believe her ; she was now ugly , as only continental old women can be ; perhaps , though , her style of dress made her look uglier than she really was . Indoors she would go about without cap , her grey hair strangely dishevelled ; then , when at home , she seldom wore a gown — only a shabby cotton camisole ; shoes , too , were strangers to her feet , and in lieu of them she sported roomy slippers , trodden down at the heels . On the other hand , whenever it was her pleasure to appear abroad , as on Sundays and fete - days , she would put on some very brilliant - coloured dress , usually of thin texture , a silk bonnet with a wreath of flowers , and a very fine shawl . She was not , in the main , an ill - natured old woman , but an incessant and most indiscreet talker ; she kept chiefly in and about the kitchen , and seemed rather to avoid her son ’s august presence ; of him , indeed , she evidently stood in awe . When he reproved her , his reproofs were bitter and unsparing ; but he seldom gave himself that trouble . Madame Pelet had her own society , her own circle of chosen visitors , whom , however , I seldom saw , as she generally entertained them in what she called her “
26342	26559	26720	26721	the gouter	648	” a small den of a place adjoining the kitchen , and descending into it by one or two steps . On these steps , by - the - by , I have not unfrequently seen Madame Pelet seated with a trencher on her knee , engaged in the threefold employment of eating her dinner , gossiping with her favourite servant , the housemaid , and scolding her antagonist , the cook ; she never dined , and seldom indeed took any meal with her son ; and as to showing her face at the boys ’ table , that was quite out of the question . These details will sound very odd in English ears , but Belgium is not England , and its ways are not our ways . Madame Pelet ’s habits of life , then , being taken into consideration , I was a good deal surprised when , one Thursday evening ( Thursday was always a half - holiday ) , as I was sitting all alone in my apartment , correcting a huge pile of English and Latin exercises , a servant tapped at the door , and , on its being opened , presented Madame Pelet ’s compliments , and she would be happy to see me to take my “
26561	26570	26720	26721	the gouter	648	” ( a meal which answers to our English “
26572	26582	26720	26721	the gouter	648	” ) with her in the dining - room . “
26587	26690	26720	26721	the gouter	648	” said I , for I thought I must have misunderstood , the message and invitation were so unusual ; the same words were repeated . I accepted , of course , and as I descended the stairs , I wondered what whim had entered the old lady ’s brain ; her son was out — gone to pass the evening at the Salle of the Grande Harmonie or some other club of which he was a member . Just as I laid my hand on the handle of the dining - room door , a queer idea glanced across my mind . “
26702	26705	26692	26692	she	647	” said I. “
26736	27068	26733	26733	I	0	” There was a fearful dismay in this suggestion of my excited imagination , and if I had allowed myself time to dwell upon it , I should no doubt have cut there and then , rushed back to my chamber , and bolted myself in ; but whenever a danger or a horror is veiled with uncertainty , the primary wish of the mind is to ascertain first the naked truth , reserving the expedient of flight for the moment when its dread anticipation shall be realized . I turned the door - handle , and in an instant had crossed the fatal threshold , closed the door behind me , and stood in the presence of Madame Pelet . Gracious heavens ! The first view of her seemed to confirm my worst apprehensions . There she sat , dressed out in a light green muslin gown , on her head a lace cap with flourishing red roses in the frill ; her table was carefully spread ; there were fruit , cakes , and coffee , with a bottle of something — I did not know what . Already the cold sweat started on my brow , already I glanced back over my shoulder at the closed door , when , to my unspeakable relief , my eye , wandering mildly in the direction of the stove , rested upon a second figure , seated in a large fauteuil beside it . This was a woman , too , and , moreover , an old woman , and as fat and as rubicund as Madame Pelet was meagre and yellow ; her attire was likewise very fine , and spring flowers of different hues circled in a bright wreath the crown of her violet - coloured velvet bonnet . I had only time to make these general observations when Madame Pelet , coming forward with what she intended should be a graceful and elastic step , thus accosted me : “
27123	27124	27107	27108	Madame Reuter	154	” “
27127	27131	27107	27108	Madame Reuter	154	” thought I , “
27138	27158	27107	27108	Madame Reuter	154	” and I bowed and took my seat . Madame Reuter placed herself at the table opposite to me . “
27167	27475	27165	27165	Monsieur	656	” asked she , in an accent of the broadest Bruxellois . I could now well distinguish the difference between the fine and pure Parisian utterance of M. Pelet , for instance , and the guttural enunciation of the Flamands . I answered politely , and then wondered how so coarse and clumsy an old woman as the one before me should be at the head of a ladies ’ seminary , which I had always heard spoken of in terms of high commendation . In truth there was something to wonder at . Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous , free - living old Flemish fermiere , or even a maitresse d’auberge , than a staid , grave , rigid directrice de pensionnat . In general the continental , or at least the Belgian old women permit themselves a licence of manners , speech , and aspect , such as our venerable granddames would recoil from as absolutely disreputable , and Madame Reuter ’s jolly face bore evidence that she was no exception to the rule of her country ; there was a twinkle and leer in her left eye ; her right she kept habitually half shut , which I thought very odd indeed . After several vain attempts to comprehend the motives of these two droll old creatures for inviting me to join them at their gouter , I at last fairly gave it up , and resigning myself to inevitable mystification , I sat and looked first at one , then at the other , taking care meantime to do justice to the confitures , cakes , and coffee , with which they amply supplied me . They , too , ate , and that with no delicate appetite , and having demolished a large portion of the solids , they proposed a “
27479	27554	27165	27165	Monsieur	656	” I declined . Not so Mesdames Pelet and Reuter ; each mixed herself what I thought rather a stiff tumbler of punch , and placing it on a stand near the stove , they drew up their chairs to that convenience , and invited me to do the same . I obeyed ; and being seated fairly between them , I was thus addressed first by Madame Pelet , then by Madame Reuter . “
27562	27623	27555	27555	We	657	” said Madame Pelet , and she went on to make an elaborate speech , which , being interpreted , was to the effect that she had asked for the pleasure of my company that evening in order to give her friend Madame Reuter an opportunity of broaching an important proposal , which might turn out greatly to my advantage . “
27630	27635	27555	27555	We	657	” said Madame Reuter , “
27653	27664	27555	27555	We	657	” ( or ponche , as she pronounced it ) ; “
27677	27690	27691	27691	I	0	” I bowed , but again declined it . She went on : “
27694	27701	27691	27691	I	0	” said she , after a solemn sip—“I
27739	27740	27728	27729	my daughter	661	” “
27751	27773	27774	27774	I	0	” Though , indeed , at that moment I recollected that it was called Mademoiselle , not Madame Reuter ’s pensionnat . “
27817	27834	27815	27815	you	0	” And she laughed loud and long , as though the idea tickled her fancy amazingly . “
27843	27847	27835	27835	Madame	154	” I observed ; “
27866	27895	27862	27862	she	154	” and I whipped out a white pocket - handkerchief and wafted it , with a French grace , past my nose , bowing at the same time . “
27901	27929	27862	27862	she	154	” murmured Madame Pelet in a low voice . Madame Reuter , being less sentimental , as she was Flamand and not French , only laughed again . “
27939	27943	27936	27936	I	0	” said she ; “
28173	28174	28158	28158	she	153	” “
28181	28186	28158	28158	she	153	” cried Madame Pelet . “
28197	28202	28158	28158	she	153	” rejoined the other : “
28304	28305	28295	28295	I	0	” “
28310	28327	28328	28328	I	0	” interrupted I — for all this chatter and circumlocution began to bore me very much ; “
28356	28357	28349	28349	I	0	” “
28366	28371	28397	28397	madame	663	” exclaimed Madame Pelet . “
28391	28392	28395	28395	merci	686	” “
28402	28541	28395	28395	merci	686	” And I backed at last out of the apartment . Having regained my own room , I set myself to turn over in my mind the incident of the evening . It seemed a queer affair altogether , and queerly managed ; the two old women had made quite a little intricate mess of it ; still I found that the uppermost feeling in my mind on the subject was one of satisfaction . In the first place it would be a change to give lessons in another seminary , and then to teach young ladies would be an occupation so interesting — to be admitted at all into a ladies ’ boarding - school would be an incident so new in my life . Besides , thought I , as I glanced at the boarded window , “
28563	28721	28395	28395	merci	686	” M. PELET could not of course object to the proposal made by Mdlle . Reuter ; permission to accept such additional employment , should it offer , having formed an article of the terms on which he had engaged me . It was , therefore , arranged in the course of next day that I should be at liberty to give lessons in Mdlle . Reuter ’s establishment four afternoons in every week . When evening came I prepared to step over in order to seek a conference with Mademoiselle herself on the subject ; I had not had time to pay the visit before , having been all day closely occupied in class . I remember very well that before quitting my chamber , I held a brief debate with myself as to whether I should change my ordinary attire for something smarter . At last I concluded it would be a waste of labour . “
28724	28728	28395	28395	merci	686	” thought I , “
28789	29207	29208	29209	Monsieur Creemsvort	159	” And off I started , cursorily glancing sideways as I passed the toilet - table , surmounted by a looking - glass : a thin irregular face I saw , with sunk , dark eyes under a large , square forehead , complexion destitute of bloom or attraction ; something young , but not youthful , no object to win a lady ’s love , no butt for the shafts of Cupid . I was soon at the entrance of the pensionnat , in a moment I had pulled the bell ; in another moment the door was opened , and within appeared a passage paved alternately with black and white marble ; the walls were painted in imitation of marble also ; and at the far end opened a glass door , through which I saw shrubs and a grass - plat , looking pleasant in the sunshine of the mild spring evening — for it was now the middle of April . This , then , was my first glimpse of the garden ; but I had not time to look long , the portress , after having answered in the affirmative my question as to whether her mistress was at home , opened the folding - doors of a room to the left , and having ushered me in , closed them behind me . I found myself in a salon with a very well - painted , highly varnished floor ; chairs and sofas covered with white draperies , a green porcelain stove , walls hung with pictures in gilt frames , a gilt pendule and other ornaments on the mantelpiece , a large lustre pendent from the centre of the ceiling , mirrors , consoles , muslin curtains , and a handsome centre table completed the inventory of furniture . All looked extremely clean and glittering , but the general effect would have been somewhat chilling had not a second large pair of folding - doors , standing wide open , and disclosing another and smaller salon , more snugly furnished , offered some relief to the eye . This room was carpeted , and therein was a piano , a couch , a chiffonniere — above all , it contained a lofty window with a crimson curtain , which , being undrawn , afforded another glimpse of the garden , through the large , clear panes , round which some leaves of ivy , some tendrils of vine were trained . “
29215	29325	29208	29209	Monsieur Creemsvort	159	” said a voice behind me ; and , starting involuntarily , I turned . I had been so taken up with the contemplation of the pretty little salon that I had not noticed the entrance of a person into the larger room . It was , however , Mdlle . Reuter who now addressed me , and stood close beside me ; and when I had bowed with instantaneously recovered sang - froid — for I am not easily embarrassed — I commenced the conversation by remarking on the pleasant aspect of her little cabinet , and the advantage she had over M. Pelet in possessing a garden . “
29328	29332	29333	29333	she	693	” she said , “
29338	29342	29333	29333	she	693	” and added , “
29399	29405	29373	29373	you	638	” I approved her judgment . “
29414	29420	29407	29407	you	638	” said she , rising ; “
29431	29864	29407	29407	you	638	” I followed her ; she opened the sash , and leaning out I saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been to me an unknown region . It was a long , not very broad strip of cultured ground , with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit trees down the middle ; there was a sort of lawn , a parterre of rose - trees , some flower - borders , and , on the far side , a thickly planted copse of lilacs , laburnums , and acacias . It looked pleasant , to me — very pleasant , so long a time had elapsed since I had seen a garden of any sort . But it was not only on Mdlle . Reuter ’s garden that my eyes dwelt ; when I had taken a view of her well - trimmed beds and budding shrubberies , I allowed my glance to come back to herself , nor did I hastily withdraw it . I had thought to see a tall , meagre , yellow , conventual image in black , with a close white cap , bandaged under the chin like a nun ’s head - gear ; whereas , there stood by me a little and roundly formed woman , who might indeed be older than I , but was still young ; she could not , I thought , be more than six or seven and twenty ; she was as fair as a fair Englishwoman ; she had no cap ; her hair was nut - brown , and she wore it in curls ; pretty her features were not , nor very soft , nor very regular , but neither were they in any degree plain , and I already saw cause to deem them expressive . What was their predominant cast ? Was it sagacity?—sense ? Yes , I thought so ; but I could scarcely as yet be sure . I discovered , however , that there was a certain serenity of eye , and freshness of complexion , most pleasing to behold . The colour on her cheek was like the bloom on a good apple , which is as sound at the core as it is red on the rind . Mdlle . Reuter and I entered upon business . She said she was not absolutely certain of the wisdom of the step she was about to take , because I was so young , and parents might possibly object to a professor like me for their daughters : “
29878	29882	29873	29873	one	1983	” said she , “
29946	29979	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” I remarked that I hoped she would find me worthy of her good opinion ; that if I knew myself , I was incapable of betraying any confidence reposed in me . “
29983	29987	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” said she , “
29996	30331	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” And then she proceeded to discuss the subject of terms . She was very cautious , quite on her guard ; she did not absolutely bargain , but she warily sounded me to find out what my expectations might be ; and when she could not get me to name a sum , she reasoned and reasoned with a fluent yet quiet circumlocution of speech , and at last nailed me down to five hundred francs per annum — not too much , but I agreed . Before the negotiation was completed , it began to grow a little dusk . I did not hasten it , for I liked well enough to sit and hear her talk ; I was amused with the sort of business talent she displayed . Edward could not have shown himself more practical , though he might have evinced more coarseness and urgency ; and then she had so many reasons , so many explanations ; and , after all , she succeeded in proving herself quite disinterested and even liberal . At last she concluded , she could say no more , because , as I acquiesced in all things , there was no further ground for the exercise of her parts of speech . I was obliged to rise . I would rather have sat a little longer ; what had I to return to but my small empty room ? And my eyes had a pleasure in looking at Mdlle . Reuter , especially now , when the twilight softened her features a little , and , in the doubtful dusk , I could fancy her forehead as open as it was really elevated , her mouth touched with turns of sweetness as well as defined in lines of sense . When I rose to go , I held out my hand , on purpose , though I knew it was contrary to the etiquette of foreign habits ; she smiled , and said — “
30340	30349	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” but gave me her hand very kindly . “
30360	30364	30358	30358	Mademoiselle	153	” said I ; “
30375	30593	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” She laughed a little , quite good - naturedly , and with the sort of tranquillity obvious in all she did — a tranquillity which soothed and suited me singularly , at least I thought so that evening . Brussels seemed a very pleasant place to me when I got out again into the street , and it appeared as if some cheerful , eventful , upward - tending career were even then opening to me , on that selfsame mild , still April night . So impressionable a being is man , or at least such a man as I was in those days . NEXT day the morning hours seemed to pass very slowly at M. Pelet ’s ; I wanted the afternoon to come that I might go again to the neighbouring pensionnat and give my first lesson within its pleasant precincts ; for pleasant they appeared to me . At noon the hour of recreation arrived ; at one o’clock we had lunch ; this got on the time , and at last St. Gudule ’s deep bell , tolling slowly two , marked the moment for which I had been waiting . At the foot of the narrow back - stairs that descended from my room , I met M. Pelet . “
30600	30604	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” said he . “
30621	30622	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” “
30629	30632	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” replied I. “
30669	30670	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” “
30681	30682	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” “
30701	30718	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” I laughed : a sentiment of exquisite pleasure played over my nerves at the thought that “
30721	30751	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” were likely to be created ; it was the deadness , the sameness of life ’s daily ongoings that had hitherto been my bane ; my blouse - clad “
30753	30764	29929	29930	M. Ledru	160	” in the boys ’ seminary never stirred in me any “
30767	30963	30967	30967	monsieur	638	” except it might be occasionally some of anger . I broke from M. Pelet , and as I strode down the passage he followed me with one of his laughs — a very French , rakish , mocking sound . Again I stood at the neighbouring door , and soon was re - admitted into the cheerful passage with its clear dove - colour imitation marble walls . I followed the portress , and descending a step , and making a turn , I found myself in a sort of corridor ; a side - door opened , Mdlle . Reuter ’s little figure , as graceful as it was plump , appeared . I could now see her dress in full daylight ; a neat , simple mousseline - laine gown fitted her compact round shape to perfection — delicate little collar and manchettes of lace , trim Parisian brodequins showed her neck , wrists , and feet , to complete advantage ; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly upon me ! Solicitude and business were in her eye — on her forehead ; she looked almost stern . Her “
30969	30991	30967	30967	monsieur	638	” was quite polite , but so orderly , so commonplace , it spread directly a cool , damp towel over my “
30995	31021	31022	31022	Monsieur	708	” The servant turned back when her mistress appeared , and I walked slowly along the corridor , side by side with Mdlle . Reuter . “
31035	31039	30967	30967	monsieur	638	” said she ; “
31081	31693	31700	31700	mesdemoiselles	710	” She was quite right , as I had found from experience ; it only remained for me to acquiesce . We proceeded now in silence . The corridor terminated in a hall , large , lofty , and square ; a glass door on one side showed within a long narrow refectory , with tables , an armoire , and two lamps ; it was empty ; large glass doors , in front , opened on the playground and garden ; a broad staircase ascended spirally on the opposite side ; the remaining wall showed a pair of great folding - doors , now closed , and admitting , doubtless , to the classes . Mdlle . Reuter turned her eye laterally on me , to ascertain , probably , whether I was collected enough to be ushered into her sanctum sanctorum . I suppose she judged me to be in a tolerable state of self - government , for she opened the door , and I followed her through . A rustling sound of uprising greeted our entrance ; without looking to the right or left , I walked straight up the lane between two sets of benches and desks , and took possession of the empty chair and isolated desk raised on an estrade , of one step high , so as to command one division ; the other division being under the surveillance of a maitresse similarly elevated . At the back of the estrade , and attached to a moveable partition dividing this schoolroom from another beyond , was a large tableau of wood painted black and varnished ; a thick crayon of white chalk lay on my desk for the convenience of elucidating any grammatical or verbal obscurity which might occur in my lessons by writing it upon the tableau ; a wet sponge appeared beside the chalk , to enable me to efface the marks when they had served the purpose intended . I carefully and deliberately made these observations before allowing myself to take one glance at the benches before me ; having handled the crayon , looked back at the tableau , fingered the sponge in order to ascertain that it was in a right state of moisture , I found myself cool enough to admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me . And first I observed that Mdlle . Reuter had already glided away , she was nowhere visible ; a maitresse or teacher , the one who occupied the corresponding estrade to my own , alone remained to keep guard over me ; she was a little in the shade , and , with my short sight , I could only see that she was of a thin bony figure and rather tallowy complexion , and that her attitude , as she sat , partook equally of listlessness and affectation . More obvious , more prominent , shone on by the full light of the large window , were the occupants of the benches just before me , of whom some were girls of fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , some young women from eighteen ( as it appeared to me ) up to twenty ; the most modest attire , the simplest fashion of wearing the hair , were apparent in all ; and good features , ruddy , blooming complexions , large and brilliant eyes , forms full , even to solidity , seemed to abound . I did not bear the first view like a stoic ; I was dazzled , my eyes fell , and in a voice somewhat too low I murmured — “
31702	31753	31700	31700	mesdemoiselles	710	” Not so had I bid the boys at Pelet ’s take their reading - books . A rustle followed , and an opening of desks ; behind the lifted lids which momentarily screened the heads bent down to search for exercise - books , I heard tittering and whispers . “
31764	31768	31754	31754	Eulalie	161	” observed one . “
31776	31777	31700	31700	mesdemoiselles	710	” “
31787	31788	31793	31793	Hortense	162	” “
31799	31989	31793	31793	Hortense	162	” And now the lids sank and the heads reappeared ; I had marked three , the whisperers , and I did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as they emerged from their temporary eclipse . It is astonishing what ease and courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me ; the idea by which I had been awed was that the youthful beings before me , with their dark nun - like robes and softly braided hair , were a kind of half - angels . The light titter , the giddy whisper , had already in some measure relieved my mind of that fond and oppressive fancy . The three I allude to were just in front , within half a yard of my estrade , and were among the most womanly - looking present . Their names I knew afterwards , and may as well mention now ; they were Eulalie , Hortense , Caroline . Eulalie was tall , and very finely shaped : she was fair , and her features were those of a Low Country Madonna ; many a “
31993	32343	31793	31793	Hortense	162	” have I seen in Dutch pictures exactly resembling hers ; there were no angles in her shape or in her face , all was curve and roundness — neither thought , sentiment , nor passion disturbed by line or flush the equality of her pale , clear skin ; her noble bust heaved with her regular breathing , her eyes moved a little — by these evidences of life alone could I have distinguished her from some large handsome figure moulded in wax . Hortense was of middle size and stout , her form was ungraceful , her face striking , more alive and brilliant than Eulalie ’s , her hair was dark brown , her complexion richly coloured ; there were frolic and mischief in her eye : consistency and good sense she might possess , but none of her features betokened those qualities . Caroline was little , though evidently full grown ; raven - black hair , very dark eyes , absolutely regular features , with a colourless olive complexion , clear as to the face and sallow about the neck , formed in her that assemblage of points whose union many persons regard as the perfection of beauty . How , with the tintless pallor of her skin and the classic straightness of her lineaments , she managed to look sensual , I do n’t know . I think her lips and eyes contrived the affair between them , and the result left no uncertainty on the beholder ’s mind . She was sensual now , and in ten years ’ time she would be coarse — promise plain was written in her face of much future folly . If I looked at these girls with little scruple , they looked at me with still less . Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine , and seemed to expect , passively but securely , an impromptu tribute to her majestic charms . Hortense regarded me boldly , and giggled at the same time , while she said , with an air of impudent freedom — “
32355	32409	32353	32353	monsieur	638	” Caroline shook her loose ringlets of abundant but somewhat coarse hair over her rolling black eyes ; parting her lips , as full as those of a hot - blooded Maroon , she showed her well - set teeth sparkling between them , and treated me at the same time to a smile “
32414	32534	32353	32353	monsieur	638	” Beautiful as Pauline Borghese , she looked at the moment scarcely purer than Lucrece de Borgia . Caroline was of noble family . I heard her lady - mother ’s character afterwards , and then I ceased to wonder at the precocious accomplishments of the daughter . These three , I at once saw , deemed themselves the queens of the school , and conceived that by their splendour they threw all the rest into the shade . In less than five minutes they had thus revealed to me their characters , and in less than five minutes I had buckled on a breast - plate of steely indifference , and let down a visor of impassible austerity . “
32542	32603	32353	32353	monsieur	638	” said I , in as dry and trite a voice as if I had been addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co. The dictee now commenced . My three belles interrupted me perpetually with little silly questions and uncalled - for remarks , to some of which I made no answer , and to others replied very quietly and briefly . “
32616	32617	32614	32614	monsieur	638	” “
32624	32625	32614	32614	monsieur	638	” “
32636	32641	32353	32353	monsieur	638	” ( giggle . ) “
32651	32652	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” “
32668	32669	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” “
32677	32698	32701	32701	mesdemoiselles	710	” Here a general murmur arose , and the teacher , opening her lips for the first time , ejaculated — “
32703	32723	32701	32701	mesdemoiselles	710	” No silence followed — on the contrary , the three ladies in front began to talk more loudly . “
32730	32731	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” “
32737	32738	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” “
32749	32774	32701	32701	mesdemoiselles	710	” Some of those behind laughed : a degree of confusion began to pervade the class ; it was necessary to take prompt measures . “
32781	32806	32701	32701	mesdemoiselles	710	” said I to Eulalie in an abrupt tone ; and bending over , I took it before she had time to give it . “
32818	32951	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” continued I , more mildly , addressing a little pale , plain looking girl who sat in the first row of the other division , and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest and the most attentive in the room ; she rose up , walked over to me , and delivered her book with a grave , modest curtsey . I glanced over the two dictations ; Eulalie ’s was slurred , blotted , and full of silly mistakes — Sylvie ’s ( such was the name of the ugly little girl ) was clearly written , it contained no error against sense , and but few faults of orthography . I coolly read aloud both exercises , marking the faults — then I looked at Eulalie : “
32955	32987	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” said I , and I deliberately tore her dictation in four parts , and presented her with the fragments . I returned Sylvie her book with a smile , saying — “
32997	33160	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” Sylvie looked calmly pleased , Eulalie swelled like an incensed turkey , but the mutiny was quelled : the conceited coquetry and futile flirtation of the first bench were exchanged for a taciturn sullenness , much more convenient to me , and the rest of my lesson passed without interruption . A bell clanging out in the yard announced the moment for the cessation of school labours . I heard our own bell at the same time , and that of a certain public college immediately after . Order dissolved instantly ; up started every pupil , I hastened to seize my hat , bow to the maitresse , and quit the room before the tide of externats should pour from the inner class , where I knew near a hundred were prisoned , and whose rising tumult I already heard . I had scarcely crossed the hall and gained the corridor , when Mdlle . Reuter came again upon me . “
33167	33310	32655	32655	monsieur	638	” said she , and she held open the door of the side room from whence she had issued on my arrival ; it was a salle - à - manger , as appeared from the beaufet and the armoire vitree , filled with glass and china , which formed part of its furniture . Ere she had closed the door on me and herself , the corridor was already filled with day - pupils , tearing down their cloaks , bonnets , and cabas from the wooden pegs on which they were suspended ; the shrill voice of a maitresse was heard at intervals vainly endeavouring to enforce some sort of order ; vainly , I say : discipline there was none in these rough ranks , and yet this was considered one of the best - conducted schools in Brussels . “
33320	33351	33316	33316	your	717	” began Mdlle . Reuter in the most calm , equable voice , as though quite unconscious of the chaos from which we were separated only by a single wall . “
33383	33483	33505	33510	les trois demoiselles du premier banc	720	” Happily , I felt in myself complete power to manage my pupils without aid ; the enchantment , the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at first , had been a good deal dissipated . I can not say I was chagrined or downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de demoiselles presented to my vague ideal of the same community ; I was only enlightened and amused ; consequently , I felt in no disposition to complain to Mdlle . Reuter , and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a smile . “
33496	33503	33505	33510	les trois demoiselles du premier banc	720	” She looked more than doubtful . “
33512	33516	33505	33510	les trois demoiselles du premier banc	720	” said she . “
33524	33579	33584	33584	you	721	” was my answer , and Mdlle . Reuter ceased to question me ; but her eye — not large , not brilliant , not melting , or kindling , but astute , penetrating , practical , showed she was even with me ; it let out a momentary gleam , which said plainly , “
33603	34113	33599	33599	I	0	” By a transition so quiet as to be scarcely perceptible , the directress ’s manner changed ; the anxious business - air passed from her face , and she began chatting about the weather and the town , and asking in neighbourly wise after M. and Madame Pelet . I answered all her little questions ; she prolonged her talk , I went on following its many little windings ; she sat so long , said so much , varied so often the topics of discourse , that it was not difficult to perceive she had a particular aim in thus detaining me . Her mere words could have afforded no clue to this aim , but her countenance aided ; while her lips uttered only affable commonplaces , her eyes reverted continually to my face . Her glances were not given in full , but out of the corners , so quietly , so stealthily , yet I think I lost not one . I watched her as keenly as she watched me ; I perceived soon that she was feeling after my real character ; she was searching for salient points , and weak points , and eccentric points ; she was applying now this test , now that , hoping in the end to find some chink , some niche , where she could put in her little firm foot and stand upon my neck — mistress of my nature . Do not mistake me , reader , it was no amorous influence she wished to gain — at that time it was only the power of the politician to which she aspired ; I was now installed as a professor in her establishment , and she wanted to know where her mind was superior to mine — by what feeling or opinion she could lead me . I enjoyed the game much , and did not hasten its conclusion ; sometimes I gave her hopes , beginning a sentence rather weakly , when her shrewd eye would light up — she thought she had me ; having led her a little way , I delighted to turn round and finish with sound , hard sense , whereat her countenance would fall . At last a servant entered to announce dinner ; the conflict being thus necessarily terminated , we parted without having gained any advantage on either side : Mdlle . Reuter had not even given me an opportunity of attacking her with feeling , and I had managed to baffle her little schemes of craft . It was a regular drawn battle . I again held out my hand when I left the room , she gave me hers ; it was a small and white hand , but how cool ! I met her eye too in full — obliging her to give me a straightforward look ; this last test went against me : it left her as it found her — moderate , temperate , tranquil ; me it disappointed . “
34119	34132	34114	34114	I	0	” thought I , as I walked back to M. Pelet ’s . “
34209	34368	34206	34207	Zoraide Reuter	153	” So I thought then ; I found afterwards that blunt susceptibilities are very consistent with strong propensities . I HAD indeed had a very long talk with the crafty little politician , and on regaining my quarters , I found that dinner was half over . To be late at meals was against a standing rule of the establishment , and had it been one of the Flemish ushers who thus entered after the removal of the soup and the commencement of the first course , M. Pelet would probably have greeted him with a public rebuke , and would certainly have mulcted him both of soup and fish ; as it was , that polite though partial gentleman only shook his head , and as I took my place , unrolled my napkin , and said my heretical grace to myself , he civilly despatched a servant to the kitchen , to bring me a plate of “
34372	34542	34206	34207	Zoraide Reuter	153	” ( for this was a maigre - day ) , and before sending away the first course , reserved for me a portion of the stock - fish of which it consisted . Dinner being over , the boys rushed out for their evening play ; Kint and Vandam ( the two ushers ) of course followed them . Poor fellows ! if they had not looked so very heavy , so very soulless , so very indifferent to all things in heaven above or in the earth beneath , I could have pitied them greatly for the obligation they were under to trail after those rough lads everywhere and at all times ; even as it was , I felt disposed to scout myself as a privileged prig when I turned to ascend to my chamber , sure to find there , if not enjoyment , at least liberty ; but this evening ( as had often happened before ) I was to be still farther distinguished . “
34549	34572	34206	34207	Zoraide Reuter	153	” said the voice of M. Pelet behind me , as I set my foot on the first step of the stair , “
34594	34595	34596	34596	I	0	” “
34602	34617	34596	34596	I	0	” said I , as I followed him to his private sitting - room , “
34630	34631	34627	34627	my	0	” “
34641	34678	34636	34636	I	0	” rejoined M. Pelet , as he ushered me into the comfortable parlour with a good wood - fire — for the stove had now been removed for the season . Having rung the bell he ordered “
34683	34767	34636	34636	I	0	” and presently he and I were seated , almost in English comfort , one on each side of the hearth , a little round table between us , with a coffee - pot , a sugar - basin , and two large white china cups . While M. Pelet employed himself in choosing a cigar from a box , my thoughts reverted to the two outcast ushers , whose voices I could hear even now crying hoarsely for order in the playground . “
34777	34780	34636	34636	I	0	” observed I. “
34785	34809	34810	34816	Des betes de somme,—des betes de somme	728	” dit M. Pelet . I remarked that I thought Messieurs Vandam and Kint must sometimes be a little fatigued with their labours . “
34818	34833	34810	34816	Des betes de somme,—des betes de somme	728	” murmured scornfully the director . Meantime I offered him his cup of coffee . “
34840	34861	34810	34816	Des betes de somme,—des betes de somme	728	” said he blandly , when I had put a couple of huge lumps of continental sugar into his cup . “
34903	34904	34905	34905	Mdlle	152	” “

35019	35033	35010	35010	mademoiselle	153	” observed M. Pelet , and he smiled and looked into the fire . “
35041	35047	35010	35010	mademoiselle	153	” murmured I , significantly . “

35169	35185	35190	35190	monsieur	638	” I felt the blood stir about my heart and rise warm to my cheek . “
35192	35193	35186	35187	Some women	745	” “

36127	36132	36117	36119	three arrant coquettes	767	” exclaimed M. Pelet . “

36162	36163	36146	36148	une blonde superbe	768	” “
36311	36376	36291	36291	you	773	” I might have laughed at the director ’s enthusiasm had I believed it real , but there was something in his tone which indicated got - up raptures . I felt he was only affecting fervour in order to put me off my guard , to induce me to come out in return , so I scarcely even smiled . He went on : “
36405	36470	36291	36291	you	773	” The question discomposed me , but I now felt plainly that my principal was endeavouring ( for reasons best known to himself — at that time I could not fathom them ) to excite ideas and wishes in my mind alien to what was right and honourable . The iniquity of the instigation proved its antidote , and when he further added : — “
36516	36525	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” I replied by a look and an interrogative “
36528	36780	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” which startled him . He laughed a forced laugh , affirmed that he had only been joking , and demanded whether I could possibly have thought him in earnest . Just then the bell rang ; the play - hour was over ; it was an evening on which M. Pelet was accustomed to read passages from the drama and the belles lettres to his pupils . He did not wait for my answer , but rising , left the room , humming as he went some gay strain of Beranger ’s . DAILY , as I continued my attendance at the seminary of Mdlle . Reuter , did I find fresh occasions to compare the ideal with the real . What had I known of female character previously to my arrival at Brussels ? Precious little . And what was my notion of it ? Something vague , slight , gauzy , glittering ; now when I came in contact with it I found it to be a palpable substance enough ; very hard too sometimes , and often heavy ; there was metal in it , both lead and iron . Let the idealists , the dreamers about earthly angel and human flowers , just look here while I open my portfolio and show them a sketch or two , pencilled after nature . I took these sketches in the second - class schoolroom of Mdlle . Reuter ’s establishment , where about a hundred specimens of the genus “
36783	38380	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” collected together offered a fertile variety of subject . A miscellaneous assortment they were , differing both in caste and country ; as I sat on my estrade and glanced over the long range of desks , I had under my eye French , English , Belgians , Austrians , and Prussians . The majority belonged to the class bourgeois ; but there were many countesses , there were the daughters of two generals and of several colonels , captains , and government employés ; these ladies sat side by side with young females destined to be demoiselles de magasins , and with some Flamandes , genuine aborigines of the country . In dress all were nearly similar , and in manners there was small difference ; exceptions there were to the general rule , but the majority gave the tone to the establishment , and that tone was rough , boisterous , masked by a point - blank disregard of all forbearance towards each other or their teachers ; an eager pursuit by each individual of her own interest and convenience ; and a coarse indifference to the interest and convenience of every one else . Most of them could lie with audacity when it appeared advantageous to do so . All understood the art of speaking fair when a point was to be gained , and could with consummate skill and at a moment ’s notice turn the cold shoulder the instant civility ceased to be profitable . Very little open quarrelling ever took place amongst them ; but backbiting and talebearing were universal . Close friendships were forbidden by the rules of the school , and no one girl seemed to cultivate more regard for another than was just necessary to secure a companion when solitude would have been irksome . They were each and all supposed to have been reared in utter unconsciousness of vice . The precautions used to keep them ignorant , if not innocent , were innumerable . How was it , then , that scarcely one of those girls having attained the age of fourteen could look a man in the face with modesty and propriety ? An air of bold , impudent flirtation , or a loose , silly leer , was sure to answer the most ordinary glance from a masculine eye . I know nothing of the arcana of the Roman Catholic religion , and I am not a bigot in matters of theology , but I suspect the root of this precocious impurity , so obvious , so general in Popish countries , is to be found in the discipline , if not the doctrines of the Church of Rome . I record what I have seen : these girls belonged to what are called the respectable ranks of society ; they had all been carefully brought up , yet was the mass of them mentally depraved . So much for the general view : now for one or two selected specimens . The first picture is a full length of Aurelia Koslow , a German fraulein , or rather a half - breed between German and Russian . She is eighteen years of age , and has been sent to Brussels to finish her education ; she is of middle size , stiffly made , body long , legs short , bust much developed but not compactly moulded , waist disproportionately compressed by an inhumanly braced corset , dress carefully arranged , large feet tortured into small bottines , head small , hair smoothed , braided , oiled , and gummed to perfection ; very low forehead , very diminutive and vindictive grey eyes , somewhat Tartar features , rather flat nose , rather high - cheek bones , yet the ensemble not positively ugly ; tolerably good complexion . So much for person . As to mind , deplorably ignorant and ill - informed : incapable of writing or speaking correctly even German , her native tongue , a dunce in French , and her attempts at learning English a mere farce , yet she has been at school twelve years ; but as she invariably gets her exercises , of every description , done by a fellow pupil , and reads her lessons off a book concealed in her lap , it is not wonderful that her progress has been so snail - like . I do not know what Aurelia ’s daily habits of life are , because I have not the opportunity of observing her at all times ; but from what I see of the state of her desk , books , and papers , I should say she is slovenly and even dirty ; her outward dress , as I have said , is well attended to , but in passing behind her bench , I have remarked that her neck is gray for want of washing , and her hair , so glossy with gum and grease , is not such as one feels tempted to pass the hand over , much less to run the fingers through . Aurelia ’s conduct in class , at least when I am present , is something extraordinary , considered as an index of girlish innocence . The moment I enter the room , she nudges her next neighbour and indulges in a half - suppressed laugh . As I take my seat on the estrade , she fixes her eye on me ; she seems resolved to attract , and , if possible , monopolize my notice : to this end she launches at me all sorts of looks , languishing , provoking , leering , laughing . As I am found quite proof against this sort of artillery — for we scorn what , unasked , is lavishly offered — she has recourse to the expedient of making noises ; sometimes she sighs , sometimes groans , sometimes utters inarticulate sounds , for which language has no name . If , in walking up the schoolroom , I pass near her , she puts out her foot that it may touch mine ; if I do not happen to observe the manoeuvre , and my boot comes in contact with her brodequin , she affects to fall into convulsions of suppressed laughter ; if I notice the snare and avoid it , she expresses her mortification in sullen muttering , where I hear myself abused in bad French , pronounced with an intolerable Low German accent . Not far from Mdlle . Koslow sits another young lady by name Adele Dronsart : this is a Belgian , rather low of stature , in form heavy , with broad waist , short neck and limbs , good red and white complexion , features well chiselled and regular , well - cut eyes of a clear brown colour , light brown hair , good teeth , age not much above fifteen , but as full - grown as a stout young Englishwoman of twenty . This portrait gives the idea of a somewhat dumpy but good - looking damsel , does it not ? Well , when I looked along the row of young heads , my eye generally stopped at this of Adele ’s ; her gaze was ever waiting for mine , and it frequently succeeded in arresting it . She was an unnatural - looking being — so young , fresh , blooming , yet so Gorgon - like . Suspicion , sullen ill - temper were on her forehead , vicious propensities in her eye , envy and panther - like deceit about her mouth . In general she sat very still ; her massive shape looked as if it could not bend much , nor did her large head — so broad at the base , so narrow towards the top — seem made to turn readily on her short neck . She had but two varieties of expression ; the prevalent one a forbidding , dissatisfied scowl , varied sometimes by a most pernicious and perfidious smile . She was shunned by her fellow - pupils , for , bad as many of them were , few were as bad as she . Aurelia and Adele were in the first division of the second class ; the second division was headed by a pensionnaire named Juanna Trista . This girl was of mixed Belgian and Spanish origin ; her Flemish mother was dead , her Catalonian father was a merchant residing in the — — Isles , where Juanna had been born and whence she was sent to Europe to be educated . I wonder that any one , looking at that girl ’s head and countenance , would have received her under their roof . She had precisely the same shape of skull as Pope Alexander the Sixth ; her organs of benevolence , veneration , conscientiousness , adhesiveness , were singularly small , those of self - esteem , firmness , destructiveness , combativeness , preposterously large ; her head sloped up in the penthouse shape , was contracted about the forehead , and prominent behind ; she had rather good , though large and marked features ; her temperament was fibrous and bilious , her complexion pale and dark , hair and eyes black , form angular and rigid but proportionate , age fifteen . Juanna was not very thin , but she had a gaunt visage , and her “
38382	39718	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” was fierce and hungry ; narrow as was her brow , it presented space enough for the legible graving of two words , Mutiny and Hate ; in some one of her other lineaments I think the eye — cowardice had also its distinct cipher . Mdlle . Trista thought fit to trouble my first lessons with a coarse work - day sort of turbulence ; she made noises with her mouth like a horse , she ejected her saliva , she uttered brutal expressions ; behind and below her were seated a band of very vulgar , inferior - looking Flamandes , including two or three examples of that deformity of person and imbecility of intellect whose frequency in the Low Countries would seem to furnish proof that the climate is such as to induce degeneracy of the human mind and body ; these , I soon found , were completely under her influence , and with their aid she got up and sustained a swinish tumult , which I was constrained at last to quell by ordering her and two of her tools to rise from their seats , and , having kept them standing five minutes , turning them bodily out of the schoolroom : the accomplices into a large place adjoining called the grands salle ; the principal into a cabinet , of which I closed the door and pocketed the key . This judgment I executed in the presence of Mdlle . Reuter , who looked much aghast at beholding so decided a proceeding — the most severe that had ever been ventured on in her establishment . Her look of affright I answered with one of composure , and finally with a smile , which perhaps flattered , and certainly soothed her . Juanna Trista remained in Europe long enough to repay , by malevolence and ingratitude , all who had ever done her a good turn ; and she then went to join her father in the — — Isles , exulting in the thought that she should there have slaves , whom , as she said , she could kick and strike at will . These three pictures are from the life . I possess others , as marked and as little agreeable , but I will spare my reader the exhibition of them . Doubtless it will be thought that I ought now , by way of contrast , to show something charming ; some gentle virgin head , circled with a halo , some sweet personification of innocence , clasping the dove of peace to her bosom . No : I saw nothing of the sort , and therefore can not portray it . The pupil in the school possessing the happiest disposition was a young girl from the country , Louise Path ; she was sufficiently benevolent and obliging , but not well taught nor well mannered ; moreover , the plague - spot of dissimulation was in her also ; honour and principle were unknown to her , she had scarcely heard their names . The least exceptionable pupil was the poor little Sylvie I have mentioned once before . Sylvie was gentle in manners , intelligent in mind ; she was even sincere , as far as her religion would permit her to be so , but her physical organization was defective ; weak health stunted her growth and chilled her spirits , and then , destined as she was for the cloister , her whole soul was warped to a conventual bias , and in the tame , trained subjection of her manner , one read that she had already prepared herself for her future course of life , by giving up her independence of thought and action into the hands of some despotic confessor . She permitted herself no original opinion , no preference of companion or employment ; in everything she was guided by another . With a pale , passive , automaton air , she went about all day long doing what she was bid ; never what she liked , or what , from innate conviction , she thought it right to do . The poor little future religieuse had been early taught to make the dictates of her own reason and conscience quite subordinate to the will of her spiritual director . She was the model pupil of Mdlle . Reuter ’s establishment ; pale , blighted image , where life lingered feebly , but whence the soul had been conjured by Romish wizard - craft ! A few English pupils there were in this school , and these might be divided into two classes . 1st . The continental English — the daughters chiefly of broken adventurers , whom debt or dishonour had driven from their own country . These poor girls had never known the advantages of settled homes , decorous example , or honest Protestant education ; resident a few months now in one Catholic school , now in another , as their parents wandered from land to land — from France to Germany , from Germany to Belgium — they had picked up some scanty instruction , many bad habits , losing every notion even of the first elements of religion and morals , and acquiring an imbecile indifference to every sentiment that can elevate humanity ; they were distinguishable by an habitual look of sullen dejection , the result of crushed self - respect and constant browbeating from their Popish fellow - pupils , who hated them as English , and scorned them as heretics . The second class were British English . Of these I did not encounter half a dozen during the whole time of my attendance at the seminary ; their characteristics were clean but careless dress , ill - arranged hair ( compared with the tight and trim foreigners ) , erect carriage , flexible figures , white and taper hands , features more irregular , but also more intellectual than those of the Belgians , grave and modest countenances , a general air of native propriety and decency ; by this last circumstance alone I could at a glance distinguish the daughter of Albion and nursling of Protestantism from the foster - child of Rome , the protégée of Jesuistry : proud , too , was the aspect of these British girls ; at once envied and ridiculed by their continental associates , they warded off insult with austere civility , and met hate with mute disdain ; they eschewed company - keeping , and in the midst of numbers seemed to dwell isolated . The teachers presiding over this mixed multitude were three in number , all French — their names Mdlles . Zephyrine , Pelagie , and Suzette ; the two last were commonplace personages enough ; their look was ordinary , their manner was ordinary , their temper was ordinary , their thoughts , feelings , and views were all ordinary — were I to write a chapter on the subject I could not elucidate it further . Zephyrine was somewhat more distinguished in appearance and deportment than Pelagie and Suzette , but in character genuine Parisian coquette , perfidious , mercenary , and dry - hearted . A fourth maitresse I sometimes saw who seemed to come daily to teach needlework , or netting , or lace - mending , or some such flimsy art ; but of her I never had more than a passing glimpse , as she sat in the carré , with her frames and some dozen of the elder pupils about her , consequently I had no opportunity of studying her character , or even of observing her person much ; the latter , I remarked , had a very English air for a maitresse , otherwise it was not striking ; of character I should think she possessed but little , as her pupils seemed constantly “
39721	40393	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” against her authority . She did not reside in the house ; her name , I think , was Mdlle . Henri . Amidst this assemblage of all that was insignificant and defective , much that was vicious and repulsive ( by that last epithet many would have described the two or three stiff , silent , decently behaved , ill - dressed British girls ) , the sensible , sagacious , affable directress shone like a steady star over a marsh full of Jack - o’-lanthorns ; profoundly aware of her superiority , she derived an inward bliss from that consciousness which sustained her under all the care and responsibility inseparable from her position ; it kept her temper calm , her brow smooth , her manner tranquil . She liked — as who would not?—on entering the school - room , to feel that her sole presence sufficed to diffuse that order and quiet which all the remonstrances , and even commands , of her underlings frequently failed to enforce ; she liked to stand in comparison , or rather — contrast , with those who surrounded her , and to know that in personal as well as mental advantages , she bore away the undisputed palm of preference—(the three teachers were all plain . ) Her pupils she managed with such indulgence and address , taking always on herself the office of recompenser and eulogist , and abandoning to her subalterns every invidious task of blame and punishment , that they all regarded her with deference , if not with affection ; her teachers did not love her , but they submitted because they were her inferiors in everything ; the various masters who attended her school were each and all in some way or other under her influence ; over one she had acquired power by her skilful management of his bad temper ; over another by little attentions to his petty caprices ; a third she had subdued by flattery ; a fourth — a timid man — she kept in awe by a sort of austere decision of mien ; me , she still watched , still tried by the most ingenious tests — she roved round me , baffled , yet persevering ; I believe she thought I was like a smooth and bare precipice , which offered neither jutting stone nor tree - root , nor tuft of grass to aid the climber . Now she flattered with exquisite tact , now she moralized , now she tried how far I was accessible to mercenary motives , then she disported on the brink of affection — knowing that some men are won by weakness — anon , she talked excellent sense , aware that others have the folly to admire judgment . I found it at once pleasant and easy to evade all these efforts ; it was sweet , when she thought me nearly won , to turn round and to smile in her very eyes , half scornfully , and then to witness her scarcely veiled , though mute mortification . Still she persevered , and at last , I am bound to confess it , her finger , essaying , proving every atom of the casket , touched its secret spring , and for a moment the lid sprung open ; she laid her hand on the jewel within ; whether she stole and broke it , or whether the lid shut again with a snap on her fingers , read on , and you shall know . It happened that I came one day to give a lesson when I was indisposed ; I had a bad cold and a cough ; two hours ’ incessant talking left me very hoarse and tired ; as I quitted the schoolroom , and was passing along the corridor , I met Mdlle . Reuter ; she remarked , with an anxious air , that I looked very pale and tired . “
40396	40400	36526	36526	Monsieur	638	” I said , “
40405	40416	40401	40401	I	0	” and then , with increased interest , she rejoined , “
40429	40709	40417	40417	You	0	” She persuaded me to step into the parlour , and was very kind and gentle while I stayed . The next day she was kinder still ; she came herself into the class to see that the windows were closed , and that there was no draught ; she exhorted me with friendly earnestness not to over - exert myself ; when I went away , she gave me her hand unasked , and I could not but mark , by a respectful and gentle pressure , that I was sensible of the favour , and grateful for it . My modest demonstration kindled a little merry smile on her countenance ; I thought her almost charming . During the remainder of the evening , my mind was full of impatience for the afternoon of the next day to arrive , that I might see her again . I was not disappointed , for she sat in the class during the whole of my subsequent lesson , and often looked at me almost with affection . At four o’clock she accompanied me out of the schoolroom , asking with solicitude after my health , then scolding me sweetly because I spoke too loud and gave myself too much trouble ; I stopped at the glass - door which led into the garden , to hear her lecture to the end ; the door was open , it was a very fine day , and while I listened to the soothing reprimand , I looked at the sunshine and flowers , and felt very happy . The day - scholars began to pour from the schoolrooms into the passage . “
40721	40725	40711	40711	you	784	” asked she , “
40731	40749	40750	40750	You	787	” I descended the steps without answering , but I looked back as much as to say — “
40756	41027	40750	40750	You	787	” In another minute I and the directress were walking side by side down the alley bordered with fruit - trees , whose white blossoms were then in full blow as well as their tender green leaves . The sky was blue , the air still , the May afternoon was full of brightness and fragrance . Released from the stifling class , surrounded with flowers and foliage , with a pleasing , smiling , affable woman at my side — how did I feel ? Why , very enviably . It seemed as if the romantic visions my imagination had suggested of this garden , while it was yet hidden from me by the jealous boards , were more than realized ; and , when a turn in the alley shut out the view of the house , and some tall shrubs excluded M. Pelet ’s mansion , and screened us momentarily from the other houses , rising amphitheatre - like round this green spot , I gave my arm to Mdlle . Reuter , and led her to a garden - chair , nestled under some lilacs near . She sat down ; I took my place at her side . She went on talking to me with that ease which communicates ease , and , as I listened , a revelation dawned in my mind that I was on the brink of falling in love . The dinner - bell rang , both at her house and M. Pelet ’s ; we were obliged to part ; I detained her a moment as she was moving away . “
41032	41035	41028	41028	I	0	” said I. “
41038	41043	40750	40750	You	787	” asked Zoraide naively . “
41048	41049	40750	40750	You	787	” “
41064	41065	41068	41068	one	1983	” “
41084	41085	41073	41073	you	0	” “
41090	41239	41073	41073	you	0	” she exclaimed , but she raised herself on her tip - toes , and , plucking a beautiful branch of lilac , offered it to me with grace . I took it , and went away , satisfied for the present , and hopeful for the future . Certainly that May day was a lovely one , and it closed in moonlight night of summer warmth and serenity . I remember this well ; for , having sat up late that evening , correcting devoirs , and feeling weary and a little oppressed with the closeness of my small room , I opened the often - mentioned boarded window , whose boards , however , I had persuaded old Madame Pelet to have removed since I had filled the post of professor in the pensionnat de demoiselles , as , from that time , it was no longer “
41241	41356	41073	41073	you	0	” for me to overlook my own pupils at their sports . I sat down in the window - seat , rested my arm on the sill , and leaned out : above me was the clear - obscure of a cloudless night sky — splendid moonlight subdued the tremulous sparkle of the stars — below lay the garden , varied with silvery lustre and deep shade , and all fresh with dew — a grateful perfume exhaled from the closed blossoms of the fruit - trees — not a leaf stirred , the night was breezeless . My window looked directly down upon a certain walk of Mdlle . Reuter ’s garden , called “
41360	41508	41073	41073	you	0	” so named because the pupils were forbidden to enter it on account of its proximity to the boys ’ school . It was here that the lilacs and laburnums grew especially thick ; this was the most sheltered nook in the enclosure , its shrubs screened the garden - chair where that afternoon I had sat with the young directress . I need not say that my thoughts were chiefly with her as I leaned from the lattice , and let my eye roam , now over the walks and borders of the garden , now along the many - windowed front of the house which rose white beyond the masses of foliage . I wondered in what part of the building was situated her apartment ; and a single light , shining through the persiennes of one croisee , seemed to direct me to it . “
41513	41517	41509	41509	She	789	” thought I , “
41533	41540	41526	41526	She	789	” I continued in voiceless soliloquy ; “
41722	41728	41730	41730	I	0	“ Now , Zoraide Reuter , ”
41732	41966	41730	41730	I	0	“ has tact , caractère , judgment , discretion ; has she heart ? What a good , simple little smile played about her lips when she gave me the branch of lilacs ! I have thought her crafty , dissembling , interested sometimes , it is true ; but may not much that looks like cunning and dissimulation in her conduct be only the efforts made by a bland temper to traverse quietly perplexing difficulties ? And as to interest , she wishes to make her way in the world , no doubt , and who can blame her ? Even if she be truly deficient in sound principle , is it not rather her misfortune than her fault ? She has been brought up a Catholic : had she been born an Englishwoman , and reared a Protestant , might she not have added straight integrity to all her other excellences ? Supposing she were to marry an English and Protestant husband , would she not , rational , sensible as she is , quickly acknowledge the superiority of right over expediency , honesty over policy ? It would be worth a man ’s while to try the experiment ; to - morrow I will renew my observations . She knows that I watch her : how calm she is under scrutiny ! it seems rather to gratify than annoy her . ”
42243	42257	42238	42239	M. Pelet	146	“ A quand donc le jour des noces , ma bien - aimee ? ”
42264	42283	42261	42261	Reuter	152	“ Mais , Francois , tu sais bien qu’il me serait impossible de me marier avant les vacances . ”
42284	42295	42297	42298	the director	2349	“ June , July , August , a whole quarter ! ”
42300	42322	42297	42298	the director	2349	“ How can I wait so long?—I who am ready , even now , to expire at your feet with impatience ! ”
42323	42366	42261	42261	Reuter	152	“ Ah ! if you die , the whole affair will be settled without any trouble about notaries and contracts ; I shall only have to order a slight mourning dress , which will be much sooner prepared than the nuptial trousseau . ”
42367	42453	42261	42261	Reuter	152	“ Cruel Zoraide ! you laugh at the distress of one who loves you so devotedly as I do : my torment is your sport ; you scruple not to stretch my soul on the rack of jealousy ; for , deny it as you will , I am certain you have cast encouraging glances on that school - boy , Crimsworth ; he has presumed to fall in love , which he dared not have done unless you had given him room to hope . ”
42454	42472	42297	42298	the director	2349	“ What do you say , Francois ? Do you say Crimsworth is in love with me ? ”
42473	42479	42261	42261	Reuter	152	“ Over head and ears . ”
42480	42487	42261	42261	Reuter	152	“ Has he told you so ? ”
42488	42507	42515	42515	Mdlle	152	“ No — but I see it in his face : he blushes whenever your name is mentioned . ”
42585	42589	42557	42557	she	816	“ blanc - bec ”

She very properly proposes to qualify herself for a higher department of education , and has asked permission to attend your lessons , in order to perfect her knowledge of English , in which language she has , I believe , already made some progress ; of course it is my wish to aid her in an effort so praiseworthy ; you will permit her then to benefit by your instruction — n’est ce pas , monsieur ? ”

I doubt not she does her best , her intentions are excellent ; but , monsieur , she wants tact and firmness . I have talked to her on the subject , but I am not fluent , and probably did not express myself with clearness ; she never appears to comprehend me . Now , would you occasionally , when you see an opportunity , slip in a word of advice to her on the subject ; men have so much more influence than women have — they argue so much more logically than we do ; and you , monsieur , in particular , have so paramount a power of making yourself obeyed ; a word of advice from you could not but do her good ; even if she were sullen and headstrong ( which I hope she is not ) , she would scarcely refuse to listen to you ; for my own part , I can truly say that I never attend one of your lessons without deriving benefit from witnessing your management of the pupils . The other masters are a constant source of anxiety to me ; they can not impress the young ladies with sentiments of respect , nor restrain the levity natural to youth : in you , monsieur , I feel the most absolute confidence ; try then to put this poor child into the way of controlling our giddy , high - spirited Brabantoises . But , monsieur , I would add one word more ; do n’t alarm her amour propre ; beware of inflicting a wound there . I reluctantly admit that in that particular she is blameably — some would say ridiculously — susceptible . I fear I have touched this sore point inadvertently , and she can not get over it . ”

55011	55062	54999	54999	I	0	“ It is sad , however , that you should be brought up in ignorance of the most ordinary branches of education ; had you known something of history and grammar you might , by degrees , have relinquished your lace - mending drudgery , and risen in the world . ”

55073	55109	54999	54999	I	0	“ How ? By a knowledge of English alone ? That will not suffice ; no respectable family will receive a governess whose whole stock of knowledge consists in a familiarity with one foreign language . ”
55110	55118	54999	54999	I	0	“ Monsieur , I know other things . ”
55119	55144	55145	55145	Mdlle	152	“ Yes , yes , you can work with Berlin wools , and embroider handkerchiefs and collars — that will do little for you . ”

55182	55208	55177	55177	I	0	“ I never like the appearance of acquiescence when the reality is not there ; and you had a contradiction at your tongue ’s end . ”
55209	55238	54999	54999	I	0	“ Monsieur , I have had many lessons both in grammar , history , geography , and arithmetic . I have gone through a course of each study . ”
55239	55261	54999	54999	I	0	“ Bravo ! but how did you manage it , since your aunt could not afford to send you to school ? ”
55262	55276	55177	55177	I	0	“ By lace - mending ; by the thing monsieur despises so much . ”
55277	55309	54999	54999	I	0	“ Truly ! And now , mademoiselle , it will be a good exercise for you to explain to me in English how such a result was produced by such means . ”
55310	55485	55486	55486	she	1017	“ Monsieur , I begged my aunt to have me taught lace - mending soon after we came to Brussels , because I knew it was a métier , a trade which was easily learnt , and by which I could earn some money very soon . I learnt it in a few days , and I quickly got work , for all the Brussels ladies have old lace — very precious — which must be mended all the times it is washed . I earned money a little , and this money I gave for lessons in the studies I have mentioned ; some of it I spent in buying books , English books especially ; soon I shall try to find a place of governess , or school - teacher , when I can write and speak English well ; but it will be difficult , because those who know I have been a lace - mender will despise me , as the pupils here despise me . Pourtant j’ai mon projet , ”
55493	55498	55486	55486	she	1017	“ What is it ? ”
55499	55514	55521	55521	She	1017	“ I will go and live in England ; I will teach French there . ”
55523	55525	55521	55521	She	1017	“ England ”
55541	55550	55521	55521	She	1017	“ Have you a wish to see England ? ”
55551	55558	55486	55486	she	1017	“ Yes , and an intention . ”
55572	55598	55567	55568	the directress	2533	“ Mademoiselle Henri , je crois qu’il va pleuvoir ; vous feriez bien , ma bonne amie , de retourner chez vous tout de suite . ”
55743	55761	55738	55738	I	0	“ What is your idea of England , mademoiselle ? Why do you wish to go there ? ”
55812	55846	55798	55798	she	200	“ England is something unique , as I have heard and read ; my idea of it is vague , and I want to go there to render my idea clear , definite . ”
55847	55913	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Hum ! How much of England do you suppose you could see if you went there in the capacity of a teacher ? A strange notion you must have of getting a clear and definite idea of a country ! All you could see of Great Britain would be the interior of a school , or at most of one or two private dwellings . ”
55914	55928	56329	56329	she	1022	“ It would be an English school ; they would be English dwellings . ”
55929	55950	55798	55798	she	200	“ Indisputably ; but what then ? What would be the value of observations made on a scale so narrow ? ”
55951	56023	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Monsieur , might not one learn something by analogy ? An — echantillon — a — a sample often serves to give an idea of the whole ; besides , narrow and wide are words comparative , are they not ? All my life would perhaps seem narrow in your eyes — all the life of a — that little animal subterranean — une taupe — comment dit - on ? ”
56024	56027	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Mole . ”
56028	56044	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Yes — a mole , which lives underground would seem narrow even to me . ”
56045	56055	55798	55798	she	200	“ Well , mademoiselle — what then ? Proceed . ”
56056	56065	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Mais , monsieur , vous me comprenez . ”
56066	56078	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Not in the least ; have the goodness to explain . ”
56079	56273	55798	55798	she	200	“ Why , monsieur , it is just so . In Switzerland I have done but little , learnt but little , and seen but little ; my life there was in a circle ; I walked the same round every day ; I could not get out of it ; had I rested — remained there even till my death , I should never have enlarged it , because I am poor and not skilful , I have not great acquirements ; when I was quite tired of this round , I begged my aunt to go to Brussels ; my existence is no larger here , because I am no richer or higher ; I walk in as narrow a limit , but the scene is changed ; it would change again if I went to England . I knew something of the bourgeois of Geneva , now I know something of the bourgeois of Brussels ; if I went to London , I would know something of the bourgeois of London . Can you make any sense out of what I say , monsieur , or is it all obscure ? ”
56274	56315	56329	56329	she	1022	“ I see , I see — now let us advert to another subject ; you propose to devote your life to teaching , and you are a most unsuccessful teacher ; you can not keep your pupils in order . ”
56343	56416	56329	56329	she	1022	“ Monsieur , I am not a skilful teacher , it is true , but practice improves ; besides , I work under difficulties ; here I only teach sewing , I can show no power in sewing , no superiority — it is a subordinate art ; then I have no associates in this house , I am isolated ; I am too a heretic , which deprives me of influence . ”
56417	56462	55798	55798	she	200	“ And in England you would be a foreigner ; that too would deprive you of influence , and would effectually separate you from all round you ; in England you would have as few connections , as little importance as you have here . ”
56463	56512	56513	56513	She	1023	“ But I should be learning something ; for the rest , there are probably difficulties for such as I everywhere , and if I must contend , and perhaps be conquered , I would rather submit to English pride than to Flemish coarseness ; besides , monsieur — ”
56535	56541	56513	56513	She	1023	“ You have said enough . ”
56542	56547	56548	56548	I	0	“ Finish your phrase , ”
56551	56640	56548	56548	I	0	“ Besides , monsieur , I long to live once more among Protestants ; they are more honest than Catholics ; a Romish school is a building with porous walls , a hollow floor , a false ceiling ; every room in this house , monsieur , has eyeholes and ear - holes , and what the house is , the inhabitants are , very treacherous ; they all think it lawful to tell lies ; they all call it politeness to profess friendship where they feel hatred . ”
56641	56644	56646	56646	I	0	“ All ? ”
56648	56676	56646	56646	I	0	“ you mean the pupils — the mere children — inexperienced , giddy things , who have not learnt to distinguish the difference between right and wrong ? ”
56677	56740	56741	56743	A servant here	1024	“ On the contrary , monsieur — the children are the most sincere ; they have not yet had time to become accomplished in duplicity ; they will tell lies , but they do it inartificially , and you know they are lying ; but the grown - up people are very false ; they deceive strangers , they deceive each other — ”
56747	56793	56741	56743	A servant here	1024	“ Mdlle . Henri — Mdlle . Reuter vous prie de vouloir bien conduire la petite de Dorlodot chez elle , elle vous attend dans le cabinet de Rosalie la portiere — c’est que sa bonne n’est pas venue la chercher — voyez - vous . ”

57107	57121	57122	57122	I	0	“ Well , are you pleased that I am satisfied with your progress ? ”
57125	57128	57130	57130	she	200	“ Yes , ”
57143	57154	57155	57155	I	0	“ But I do not say enough , I suppose ? ”
57158	57165	57155	57155	I	0	“ My praises are too cool ? ”

58416	58433	58405	58407	that inscrutable mien	1054	“ The matter is too trite to excite an emotion , or call forth an opinion . ”

58505	58519	58467	58468	the directress	2533	“ the remainder will wait till their respective servants arrive to fetch them . ”
58531	58537	58539	58539	Mdlle	152	“ Monsieur , a word , ”
58576	58585	58560	58560	she	152	“ Mademoiselle , I am at your service . ”
58586	58949	58560	58560	she	152	“ Monsieur , it is of course an excellent plan to encourage effort in young people by making conspicuous the progress of any particularly industrious pupil ; but do you not think that in the present instance , Mdlle . Henri can hardly be considered as a concurrent with the other pupils ? She is older than most of them , and has had advantages of an exclusive nature for acquiring a knowledge of English ; on the other hand , her sphere of life is somewhat beneath theirs ; under these circumstances , a public distinction , conferred upon Mdlle . Henri , may be the means of suggesting comparisons , and exciting feelings such as would be far from advantageous to the individual forming their object . The interest I take in Mdlle . Henri ’s real welfare makes me desirous of screening her from annoyances of this sort ; besides , monsieur , as I have before hinted to you , the sentiment of amour - propre has a somewhat marked preponderance in her character ; celebrity has a tendency to foster this sentiment , and in her it should be rather repressed — she rather needs keeping down than bringing forward ; and then I think , monsieur — it appears to me that ambition , literary ambition especially , is not a feeling to be cherished in the mind of a woman : would not Mdlle . Henri be much safer and happier if taught to believe that in the quiet discharge of social duties consists her real vocation , than if stimulated to aspire after applause and publicity ? She may never marry ; scanty as are her resources , obscure as are her connections , uncertain as is her health ( for I think her consumptive , her mother died of that complaint ) , it is more than probable she never will . I do not see how she can rise to a position , whence such a step would be possible ; but even in celibacy it would be better for her to retain the character and habits of a respectable decorous female . ”
58950	58955	58957	58957	my	0	“ Indisputably , mademoiselle , ”
58960	58968	58957	58957	my	0	“ Your opinion admits of no doubt ; ”
59184	59192	59193	59193	I	0	“ Ou donc est Mdlle . Henri ? ”
59209	59216	59193	59193	I	0	“ Elle est partie , monsieur . ”
59217	59233	59193	59193	I	0	“ Partie ? et pour combien de temps ? Quand reviendra - t - elle ? ”
59234	59248	59193	59193	I	0	“ Elle est partie pour toujours , monsieur ; elle ne reviendra plus . ”

59275	59299	59193	59193	I	0	“ Oui , oui , monsieur , mademoiselle la directrice nous l’a dit elle - meme il y a deux ou trois jours . ”
59400	59419	59393	59393	I	0	“ Sylvie , do you know Mdlle . Henri ’s address ? I have some books of hers , ”
59424	59435	59420	59420	I	0	“ and I should wish to send them to her . ”
59436	59441	59443	59443	Sylvie	166	“ No , monsieur , ”
59445	59461	59443	59443	Sylvie	166	“ but perhaps Rosalie , the portress , will be able to give it you . ”
59680	59709	59710	59710	She	202	“ Oh , do n’t mention it , monsieur ; you only touched my hair with your elbow ; it is no worse , only a little dishevelled . ”
59739	59774	59733	59733	she	202	“ Rosalie , I was coming to tell you to go instantly and close the windows of the salon ; the wind is rising , and the muslin curtains will be covered with dust . ”
59778	59781	59783	59783	I	0	“ Now , ”
59785	59827	59783	59783	I	0	“ this will not do ; Mdlle . Reuter thinks her meanness in eaves - dropping is screened by her art in devising a pretext , whereas the muslin curtains she speaks of are not more transparent than this same pretext . ”
59854	59867	59869	59869	I	0	“ The rough - shod foot treads most firmly on slippery ground , ”
59875	59889	59872	59872	I	0	“ Mademoiselle Henri has left your establishment — been dismissed , I presume ? ”

59920	59938	59940	59940	she	202	“ but we can not talk quietly here ; will Monsieur step into the garden a minute ? ”
59956	59959	59961	59961	she	202	“ There , ”
60025	60143	60166	60166	she	2533	“ There , one feels quiet and free when there are only pear - trees and rose - bushes about one ; I dare say you , like me , monsieur , are sometimes tired of being eternally in the midst of life ; of having human faces always round you , human eyes always upon you , human voices always in your ear . I am sure I often wish intensely for liberty to spend a whole month in the country at some little farm - house , bien gentille , bien propre , tout entouree de champs et de bois ; quelle vie charmante que la vie champetre ! N’est - ce pas , monsieur ? ”
60144	60150	60166	60166	she	2533	“ Cela depend , mademoiselle . ”
60151	60160	60162	60163	the directress	2533	“ Que le vent est bon et frais ! ”

60339	60375	60254	60254	I	0	“ Not often . Mdlle . Henri ’s departure was not voluntary , I presume ? If it had been , she would certainly have given me some intimation of it , being my pupil . ”
60376	60426	60254	60254	I	0	“ Oh , did she not tell you ? that was strange ; for my part , I never thought of adverting to the subject ; when one has so many things to attend to , one is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary importance . ”
60427	60444	60256	60256	my	0	“ You consider Mdlle . Henri ’s dismission , then , as a very insignificant event ? ”
60445	60483	60254	60254	I	0	“ Dismission ? Ah ! she was not dismissed ; I can say with truth , monsieur , that since I became the head of this establishment no master or teacher has ever been dismissed from it . ”
60484	60493	60254	60254	I	0	“ Yet some have left it , mademoiselle ? ”
60494	60546	60256	60256	my	0	“ Many ; I have found it necessary to change frequently — a change of instructors is often beneficial to the interests of a school ; it gives life and variety to the proceedings ; it amuses the pupils , and suggests to the parents the idea of exertion and progress . ”
60547	60565	60254	60254	I	0	“ Yet when you are tired of a professor or maitresse , you scruple to dismiss them ? ”
60566	60603	60256	60256	my	0	“ No need to have recourse to such extreme measures , I assure you . Allons , monsieur le professeur — asseyons - nous ; je vais vous donner une petite lecon dans votre etat d’instituteur . ”

60864	60872	60873	60873	she	152	“ Monsieur fears to sit by me ? ”
60877	60888	60873	60873	she	152	“ I have no wish to usurp Pelet ’s place , ”
60983	60990	60991	60991	I	0	“ Well — and your lesson ? ”
60995	60998	60999	60999	she	152	“ Ah ! ”
61005	61082	60999	60999	she	152	“ you are so young , so frank and fearless , so talented , so impatient of imbecility , so disdainful of vulgarity , you need a lesson ; here it is then : far more is to be done in this world by dexterity than by strength ; but , perhaps , you knew that before , for there is delicacy as well as power in your character — policy , as well as pride ? ”
61083	61087	61089	61089	I	0	“ Go on , ”
61163	61243	61244	61244	She	152	“ Well , then , if ever you are at the head of a large establishment , dismiss nobody . To speak truth , monsieur ( and to you I will speak truth ) , I despise people who are always making rows , blustering , sending off one to the right , and another to the left , urging and hurrying circumstances . I ’ll tell you what I like best to do , monsieur , shall I ? ”
61300	61561	61569	61569	her	1083	“ I like , monsieur , to take my knitting in my hands , and to sit quietly down in my chair ; circumstances defile past me ; I watch their march ; so long as they follow the course I wish , I say nothing , and do nothing ; I do n’t clap my hands , and cry out ‘ Bravo ! How lucky I am ! ’ to attract the attention and envy of my neighbours — I am merely passive ; but when events fall out ill — when circumstances become adverse — I watch very vigilantly ; I knit on still , and still I hold my tongue ; but every now and then , monsieur , I just put my toe out — so — and give the rebellious circumstance a little secret push , without noise , which sends it the way I wish , and I am successful after all , and nobody has seen my expedient . So , when teachers or masters become troublesome and inefficient — when , in short , the interests of the school would suffer from their retaining their places — I mind my knitting , events progress , circumstances glide past ; I see one which , if pushed ever so little awry , will render untenable the post I wish to have vacated — the deed is done — the stumbling - block removed — and no one saw me : I have not made an enemy , I am rid of an incumbrance . ”
61583	61588	61576	61576	I	0	“ Just like you , ”
61594	61619	61576	61576	I	0	“ And in this way you have ousted Mdlle . Henri ? You wanted her office , therefore you rendered it intolerable to her ? ”
61620	61739	61776	61777	the directress	2533	“ Not at all , monsieur , I was merely anxious about Mdlle . Henri ’s health ; no , your moral sight is clear and piercing , but there you have failed to discover the truth . I took — I have always taken a real interest in Mdlle . Henri ’s welfare ; I did not like her going out in all weathers ; I thought it would be more advantageous for her to obtain a permanent situation ; besides , I considered her now qualified to do something more than teach sewing . I reasoned with her ; left the decision to herself ; she saw the correctness of my views , and adopted them . ”
61740	61759	61576	61576	I	0	“ Excellent ! and now , mademoiselle , you will have the goodness to give me her address . ”

61779	61879	61576	61576	I	0	“ Her address ? Ah?—well — I wish I could oblige you , monsieur , but I can not , and I will tell you why ; whenever I myself asked her for her address , she always evaded the inquiry . I thought — I may be wrong — but I thought her motive for doing so , was a natural , though mistaken reluctance to introduce me to some , probably , very poor abode ; her means were narrow , her origin obscure ; she lives somewhere , doubtless , in the ‘ basse ville . ’ ”

61896	61970	61894	61894	I	0	“ though she were born of beggars and lodged in a cellar ; for the rest , it is absurd to make a bugbear of her origin to me — I happen to know that she was a Swiss pastor ’s daughter , neither more nor less ; and , as to her narrow means , I care nothing for the poverty of her purse so long as her heart overflows with affluence . ”

63104	63184	63185	63185	I	0	“ Very well ; I understand you perfectly , mademoiselle , and now I have only two or three words to say . This is the last week in July ; in another month the vacation will commence , have the goodness to avail yourself of the leisure it will afford you to look out for another English master — at the close of August , I shall be under the necessity of resigning my post in your establishment . ”

64042	64055	64019	64019	I	0	” I asked of the servant who had delivered it to me . “

64073	64092	64065	64065	he	1130	” And I wended my way up the back - stairs , wondrously the wiser for my inquiries . “
64096	64109	64065	64065	he	1130	” said I to myself , as I again closed the door . “
64119	64319	64113	64113	I’ll	0	” And I did . I sought her day by day whenever I had a moment ’s leisure , for four weeks ; I sought her on Sundays all day long ; I sought her on the Boulevards , in the Allee Verte , in the Park ; I sought her in Ste . Gudule and St. Jacques ; I sought her in the two Protestant chapels ; I attended these latter at the German , French , and English services , not doubting that I should meet her at one of them . All my researches were absolutely fruitless ; my security on the last point was proved by the event to be equally groundless with my other calculations . I stood at the door of each chapel after the service , and waited till every individual had come out , scrutinizing every gown draping a slender form , peering under every bonnet covering a young head . In vain ; I saw girlish figures pass me , drawing their black scarfs over their sloping shoulders , but none of them had the exact turn and air of Mdlle . Henri ’s ; I saw pale and thoughtful faces “
64321	64393	64394	64394	She	1132	” in bands of brown hair , but I never found her forehead , her eyes , her eyebrows . All the features of all the faces I met seemed frittered away , because my eye failed to recognize the peculiarities it was bent upon ; an ample space of brow and a large , dark , and serious eye , with a fine but decided line of eyebrow traced above . “
64412	64660	64407	64407	she	1132	” muttered I inwardly , as on the afternoon of the fourth Sunday , I turned from the door of the chapel - royal which the door - keeper had just closed and locked , and followed in the wake of the last of the congregation , now dispersed and dispersing over the square . I had soon outwalked the couples of English gentlemen and ladies . ( Gracious goodness ! why do n’t they dress better ? My eye is yet filled with visions of the high - flounced , slovenly , and tumbled dresses in costly silk and satin , of the large unbecoming collars in expensive lace ; of the ill - cut coats and strangely fashioned pantaloons which every Sunday , at the English service , filled the choirs of the chapel - royal , and after it , issuing forth into the square , came into disadvantageous contrast with freshly and trimly attired foreign figures , hastening to attend salut at the church of Coburg . ) I had passed these pairs of Britons , and the groups of pretty British children , and the British footmen and waiting - maids ; I had crossed the Place Royale , and got into the Rue Royale , thence I had diverged into the Rue de Louvain — an old and quiet street . I remember that , feeling a little hungry , and not desiring to go back and take my share of the “
64663	65184	64407	64407	she	1132	” now on the refectory - table at Pelet’s — to wit , pistolets and water — I stepped into a baker ’s and refreshed myself on a couc(?)—it is a Flemish word , I do n’t know how to spell it — A corinthe — anglice , a currant bun — and a cup of coffee ; and then I strolled on towards the Porte de Louvain . Very soon I was out of the city , and slowly mounting the hill , which ascends from the gate , I took my time ; for the afternoon , though cloudy , was very sultry , and not a breeze stirred to refresh the atmosphere . No inhabitant of Brussels need wander far to search for solitude ; let him but move half a league from his own city and he will find her brooding still and blank over the wide fields , so drear though so fertile , spread out treeless and trackless round the capital of Brabant . Having gained the summit of the hill , and having stood and looked long over the cultured but lifeless campaign , I felt a wish to quit the high road , which I had hitherto followed , and get in among those tilled grounds — fertile as the beds of a Brobdignagian kitchen - garden — spreading far and wide even to the boundaries of the horizon , where , from a dusk green , distance changed them to a sullen blue , and confused their tints with those of the livid and thunderous - looking sky . Accordingly I turned up a by - path to the right ; I had not followed it far ere it brought me , as I expected , into the fields , amidst which , just before me , stretched a long and lofty white wall enclosing , as it seemed from the foliage showing above , some thickly planted nursery of yew and cypress , for of that species were the branches resting on the pale parapets , and crowding gloomily about a massive cross , planted doubtless on a central eminence and extending its arms , which seemed of black marble , over the summits of those sinister trees . I approached , wondering to what house this well - protected garden appertained ; I turned the angle of the wall , thinking to see some stately residence ; I was close upon great iron gates ; there was a hut serving for a lodge near , but I had no occasion to apply for the key — the gates were open ; I pushed one leaf back — rain had rusted its hinges , for it groaned dolefully as they revolved . Thick planting embowered the entrance . Passing up the avenue , I saw objects on each hand which , in their own mute language of inscription and sign , explained clearly to what abode I had made my way . This was the house appointed for all living ; crosses , monuments , and garlands of everlastings announced , “
65195	65793	64407	64407	she	1132	” The place was large enough to afford half an hour ’s strolling without the monotony of treading continually the same path ; and , for those who love to peruse the annals of graveyards , here was variety of inscription enough to occupy the attention for double or treble that space of time . Hither people of many kindreds , tongues , and nations , had brought their dead for interment ; and here , on pages of stone , of marble , and of brass , were written names , dates , last tributes of pomp or love , in English , in French , in German , and Latin . Here the Englishman had erected a marble monument over the remains of his Mary Smith or Jane Brown , and inscribed it only with her name . There the French widower had shaded the grave of his Elmire or Celestine with a brilliant thicket of roses , amidst which a little tablet rising , bore an equally bright testimony to her countless virtues . Every nation , tribe , and kindred , mourned after its own fashion ; and how soundless was the mourning of all ! My own tread , though slow and upon smooth - rolled paths , seemed to startle , because it formed the sole break to a silence otherwise total . Not only the winds , but the very fitful , wandering airs , were that afternoon , as by common consent , all fallen asleep in their various quarters ; the north was hushed , the south silent , the east sobbed not , nor did the west whisper . The clouds in heaven were condensed and dull , but apparently quite motionless . Under the trees of this cemetery nestled a warm breathless gloom , out of which the cypresses stood up straight and mute , above which the willows hung low and still ; where the flowers , as languid as fair , waited listless for night dew or thunder - shower ; where the tombs , and those they hid , lay impassible to sun or shadow , to rain or drought . Importuned by the sound of my own footsteps , I turned off upon the turf , and slowly advanced to a grove of yews ; I saw something stir among the stems ; I thought it might be a broken branch swinging , my short - sighted vision had caught no form , only a sense of motion ; but the dusky shade passed on , appearing and disappearing at the openings in the avenue . I soon discerned it was a living thing , and a human thing ; and , drawing nearer , I perceived it was a woman , pacing slowly to and fro , and evidently deeming herself alone as I had deemed myself alone , and meditating as I had been meditating . Ere long she returned to a seat which I fancy she had but just quitted , or I should have caught sight of her before . It was in a nook , screened by a clump of trees ; there was the white wall before her , and a little stone set up against the wall , and , at the foot of the stone , was an allotment of turf freshly turned up , a new - made grave . I put on my spectacles , and passed softly close behind her ; glancing at the inscription on the stone , I read , “
65808	66456	66460	66461	mon maitre	1134	” Having perused the inscription , I looked down at the form sitting bent and thoughtful just under my eyes , unconscious of the vicinity of any living thing ; it was a slim , youthful figure in mourning apparel of the plainest black stuff , with a little simple , black crape bonnet ; I felt , as well as saw , who it was ; and , moving neither hand nor foot , I stood some moments enjoying the security of conviction . I had sought her for a month , and had never discovered one of her traces — never met a hope , or seized a chance of encountering her anywhere . I had been forced to loosen my grasp on expectation ; and , but an hour ago , had sunk slackly under the discouraging thought that the current of life , and the impulse of destiny , had swept her for ever from my reach ; and , behold , while bending suddenly earthward beneath the pressure of despondency — while following with my eyes the track of sorrow on the turf of a graveyard — here was my lost jewel dropped on the tear - fed herbage , nestling in the messy and mouldy roots of yew - trees . Frances sat very quiet , her elbow on her knee , and her head on her hand . I knew she could retain a thinking attitude a long time without change ; at last , a tear fell ; she had been looking at the name on the stone before her , and her heart had no doubt endured one of those constrictions with which the desolate living , regretting the dead , are , at times , so sorely oppressed . Many tears rolled down , which she wiped away , again and again , with her handkerchief ; some distressed sobs escaped her , and then , the paroxysm over , she sat quiet as before . I put my hand gently on her shoulder ; no need further to prepare her , for she was neither hysterical nor liable to fainting - fits ; a sudden push , indeed , might have startled her , but the contact of my quiet touch merely woke attention as I wished ; and , though she turned quickly , yet so lightning - swift is thought — in some minds especially — I believe the wonder of what — the consciousness of who it was that thus stole unawares on her solitude , had passed through her brain , and flashed into her heart , even before she had effected that hasty movement ; at least , Amazement had hardly opened her eyes and raised them to mine , ere Recognition informed their irids with most speaking brightness . Nervous surprise had hardly discomposed her features ere a sentiment of most vivid joy shone clear and warm on her whole countenance . I had hardly time to observe that she was wasted and pale , ere called to feel a responsive inward pleasure by the sense of most full and exquisite pleasure glowing in the animated flush , and shining in the expansive light , now diffused over my pupil ’s face . It was the summer sun flashing out after the heavy summer shower ; and what fertilizes more rapidly than that beam , burning almost like fire in its ardour ? I hate boldness — that boldness which is of the brassy brow and insensate nerves ; but I love the courage of the strong heart , the fervour of the generous blood ; I loved with passion the light of Frances Evans ’ clear hazel eye when it did not fear to look straight into mine ; I loved the tones with which she uttered the words — “
66463	66766	66460	66461	mon maitre	1134	” I loved the movement with which she confided her hand to my hand ; I loved her as she stood there , penniless and parentless ; for a sensualist charmless , for me a treasure — my best object of sympathy on earth , thinking such thoughts as I thought , feeling such feelings as I felt ; my ideal of the shrine in which to seal my stores of love ; personification of discretion and forethought , of diligence and perseverance , of self - denial and self - control — those guardians , those trusty keepers of the gift I longed to confer on her — the gift of all my affections ; model of truth and honour , of independence and conscientiousness — those refiners and sustainers of an honest life ; silent possessor of a well of tenderness , of a flame , as genial as still , as pure as quenchless , of natural feeling , natural passion — those sources of refreshment and comfort to the sanctuary of home . I knew how quietly and how deeply the well bubbled in her heart ; I knew how the more dangerous flame burned safely under the eye of reason ; I had seen when the fire shot up a moment high and vivid , when the accelerated heat troubled life ’s current in its channels ; I had seen reason reduce the rebel , and humble its blaze to embers . I had confidence in Frances Evans ; I had respect for her , and as I drew her arm through mine , and led her out of the cemetery , I felt I had another sentiment , as strong as confidence , as firm as respect , more fervid than either — that of love . “
66772	66784	66769	66770	my pupil	1015	” said I , as the ominous sounding gate swung to behind us—“Well
66814	66822	66823	66823	Mademoiselle	200	” Never had I addressed her but as “
66824	66864	66865	66866	Mon maitre	1134	” before , and to speak thus was to take up a tone new to both her and me . Her answer suprised me that this language ruffled none of her feelings , woke no discord in her heart : “
66868	66872	66865	66866	Mon maitre	1134	” she said , “
66920	66921	66903	66903	I	0	” “

67116	67121	67122	67122	Monsieur	1143	” I demanded hastily . “
67194	67427	67191	67191	she	2897	“ Mademoiselle , I shall not soon cease to regret your departure from my establishment , though indeed it is true that you have taught your class of pupils so well that they are all quite accomplished in the little works you manage so skilfully , and have not the slightest need of further instruction ; my second teacher must in future supply your place , with regard to the younger pupils , as well as she can , though she is indeed an inferior artiste to you , and doubtless it will be your part now to assume a higher position in your calling ; I am sure you will everywhere find schools and families willing to profit by your talents . ’ And then she paid me my last quarter ’s salary . I asked , as mademoiselle would no doubt think , very bluntly , if she designed to discharge me from the establishment . She smiled at my inelegance of speech , and answered that ‘ our connection as employer and employed was certainly dissolved , but that she hoped still to retain the pleasure of my acquaintance ; she should always be happy to see me as a friend ; ’ and then she said something about the excellent condition of the streets , and the long continuance of fine weather , and went away quite cheerful . ”

75739	76147	76148	76148	You	1319	“ A week ago , monsieur , I was sent for by a Mrs. Wharton , an English lady ; her eldest daughter was going to be married , and some rich relation having made her a present of a veil and dress in costly old lace , as precious , they said , almost as jewels , but a little damaged by time , I was commissioned to put them in repair . I had to do it at the house ; they gave me , besides , some embroidery to complete , and nearly a week elapsed before I had finished everything . While I worked , Miss Wharton often came into the room and sat with me , and so did Mrs. Wharton ; they made me talk English ; asked how I had learned to speak it so well ; then they inquired what I knew besides — what books I had read ; soon they seemed to make a sort of wonder of me , considering me no doubt as a learned grisette . One afternoon , Mrs. Wharton brought in a Parisian lady to test the accuracy of my knowledge of French ; the result of it was that , owing probably in a great degree to the mother ’s and daughter ’s good humour about the marriage , which inclined them to do beneficent deeds , and partly , I think , because they are naturally benevolent people , they decided that the wish I had expressed to do something more than mend lace was a very legitimate one ; and the same day they took me in their carriage to Mrs. D.‘s , who is the directress of the first English school at Brussels . It seems she happened to be in want of a French lady to give lessons in geography , history , grammar , and composition , in the French language . Mrs. Wharton recommended me very warmly ; and , as two of her younger daughters are pupils in the house , her patronage availed to get me the place . It was settled that I am to attend six hours daily ( for , happily , it was not required that I should live in the house ; I should have been sorry to leave my lodgings ) , and , for this , Mrs. D. will give me twelve hundred francs per annum . “

It was directed in a hand to me unknown — small , and rather neat ; neither masculine nor exactly feminine ; the seal bore a coat of arms , concerning which I could only decipher that it was not that of the Seacombe family , consequently the epistle could be from none of my almost forgotten , and certainly quite forgetting patrician relations . From whom , then , was it ? I removed the envelope ; the note folded within ran as follows : “

And this you may rely on : if she pleases my taste , or if I think it worth while in a pecuniary point of view , I ’ll pounce on your prize and bear her away triumphant in spite of your teeth . Yet I do n’t like dumpies either , and Brown says she is little and stout — the better fitted for a wiry , starved - looking chap like you . “

Oh , confound him ! Let him come , and let him laugh at the contrast between rumour and fact .

Be as you always are ; look over what she has written ; listen while she reads ; chide her , or quietly approve ; you know the effect of either system ; you know her smile when pleased , you know the play of her looks when roused ; you have the secret of awakening what expression you will , and you can choose amongst that pleasant variety . With you she will sit silent as long as it suits you to talk alone ; you can hold her under a potent spell : intelligent as she is , eloquent as she can be , you can seal her lips , and veil her bright countenance with diffidence ; yet , you know , she is not all monotonous mildness ; you have seen , with a sort of strange pleasure , revolt , scorn , austerity , bitterness , lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy ; you know that few could rule her as you do ; you know she might break , but never bend under the hand of Tyranny and Injustice , but Reason and Affection can guide her by a sign .

Why did you leave ? ”
80186	80207	80101	80101	he	1396	“ Because M. Pelet has just married the lady whom you and Mr. Brown assigned to me as my wife . ”

80464	80484	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ You had better ; he often has it in his power to give useful information in such matters . ”
80485	80511	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ He served me once very well ; I have no claim on him , and am not in the humour to bother him again . ”
80512	80546	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Oh , if you ’re bashful , and dread being intrusive , you need only commission me . I shall see him to - night ; I can put in a word . ”
80547	80609	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ I beg you will not , Mr. Hunsden ; I am in your debt already ; you did me an important service when I was at X — — ; got me out of a den where I was dying : that service I have never repaid , and at present I decline positively adding another item to the account . ”
80610	80742	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ If the wind sits that way , I ’m satisfied . I thought my unexampled generosity in turning you out of that accursed counting - house would be duly appreciated some day : ‘ Cast your bread on the waters , and it shall be found after many days , ’ say the Scriptures . Yes , that ’s right , lad — make much of me — I’m a nonpareil : there ’s nothing like me in the common herd . In the meantime , to put all humbug aside and talk sense for a few moments , you would be greatly the better of a situation , and what is more , you are a fool if you refuse to take one from any hand that offers it . ”
80743	80769	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Very well , Mr. Hunsden ; now you have settled that point , talk of something else . What news from X — — ? ”
80770	80795	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ I have not settled that point , or at least there is another to settle before we get to X——. Is this Miss Zenobie ”
80800	80811	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	I)—“well , Zoraide — is she really married to Pelet ? ”
80812	80835	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ I tell you yes — and if you do n’t believe me , go and ask the cure of St. Jacques . ”
80836	80843	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ And your heart is broken ? ”
80844	80862	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ I am not aware that it is ; it feels all right — beats as usual . ”
80863	80896	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Then your feelings are less superfine than I took them to be ; you must be a coarse , callous character , to bear such a thwack without staggering under it . ”
80897	80943	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Staggering under it ? What the deuce is there to stagger under in the circumstance of a Belgian schoolmistress marrying a French schoolmaster ? The progeny will doubtless be a strange hybrid race ; but that ’s their look - out — not mine . ”
80944	80959	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ He indulges in scurrilous jests , and the bride was his affianced one ! ”
80960	80965	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Who said so ? ”
80966	80969	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ Brown . ”
80970	80985	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ I ’ll tell you what , Hunsden — Brown is an old gossip . ”
80986	81034	80797	80797	Zoraide	153	“ He is ; but in the meantime , if his gossip be founded on less than fact — if you took no particular interest in Miss Zoraide — why , O youthful pedagogue ! did you leave your place in consequence of her becoming Madame Pelet ? ”
81035	81038	81039	81039	I	0	“ Because — ”
81048	81064	81041	81041	my	0	“ because — in short , Mr. Hunsden , I decline answering any more questions , ”
81087	81099	81082	81082	his	109	“ What the deuce are you laughing at , Mr. Hunsden ? ”
81100	81146	81147	81147	I	0	“ At your exemplary composure . Well , lad , I ’ll not bore you ; I see how it is : Zoraide has jilted you — married some one richer , as any sensible woman would have done if she had had the chance . ”
81219	81367	81214	81214	he	109	“ I suppose the affair has been conducted as such affairs always are amongst rational people : you offered her your youth and your talents — such as they are — in exchange for her position and money : I do n’t suppose you took appearance , or what is called love , into the account — for I understand she is older than you , and Brown says , rather sensible - looking than beautiful . She , having then no chance of making a better bargain , was at first inclined to come to terms with you , but Pelet — the head of a flourishing school — stepped in with a higher bid ; she accepted , and he has got her : a correct transaction — perfectly so — business - like and legitimate . And now we ’ll talk of something else . ”
81368	81371	81373	81373	I	0	“ Do , ”
81432	81520	81417	81417	his	1408	“ You want to hear news from X — — ? And what interest can you have in X — — ? You left no friends there , for you made none . Nobody ever asks after you — neither man nor woman ; and if I mention your name in company , the men look as if I had spoken of Prester John ; and the women sneer covertly . Our X — — belles must have disliked you . How did you excite their displeasure ? ”
81521	81611	81417	81417	his	1408	“ I do n’t know . I seldom spoke to them — they were nothing to me . I considered them only as something to be glanced at from a distance ; their dresses and faces were often pleasing enough to the eye : but I could not understand their conversation , nor even read their countenances . When I caught snatches of what they said , I could never make much of it ; and the play of their lips and eyes did not help me at all . ”
81612	81766	81916	81916	he	109	“ That was your fault , not theirs . There are sensible , as well as handsome women in X — — ; women it is worth any man ’s while to talk to , and with whom I can talk with pleasure : but you had and have no pleasant address ; there is nothing in you to induce a woman to be affable . I have remarked you sitting near the door in a room full of company , bent on hearing , not on speaking ; on observing , not on entertaining ; looking frigidly shy at the commencement of a party , confusingly vigilant about the middle , and insultingly weary towards the end . Is that the way , do you think , ever to communicate pleasure or excite interest ? No ; and if you are generally unpopular , it is because you deserve to be so . ”
81767	81770	81771	81771	I	0	“ Content ! ”
81774	81874	81771	81771	I	0	“ No , you are not content ; you see beauty always turning its back on you ; you are mortified and then you sneer . I verily believe all that is desirable on earth — wealth , reputation , love — will for ever to you be the ripe grapes on the high trellis : you ’ll look up at them ; they will tantalize in you the lust of the eye ; but they are out of reach : you have not the address to fetch a ladder , and you ’ll go away calling them sour . ”
82396	82473	82391	82391	he	109	“ Confound it ! How doggedly self - approving the lad looks ! I thought he was fit to die with shame , and there he sits grinning smiles , as good as to say , ‘ Let the world wag as it will , I ’ve the philosopher ’s stone in my waist - coat pocket , and the elixir of life in my cupboard ; I ’m independent of both Fate and Fortune . ’ ”
82474	82575	82386	82386	he	109	“ Hunsden — you spoke of grapes ; I was thinking of a fruit I like better than your X — — hot - house grapes — an unique fruit , growing wild , which I have marked as my own , and hope one day to gather and taste . It is of no use your offering me the draught of bitterness , or threatening me with death by thirst : I have the anticipation of sweetness on my palate ; the hope of freshness on my lips ; I can reject the unsavoury , and endure the exhausting . ”
82576	82581	82386	82386	he	109	“ For how long ? ”
82582	82616	82391	82391	he	109	“ Till the next opportunity for effort ; and as the prize of success will be a treasure after my own heart , I ’ll bring a bull ’s strength to the struggle . ”
82617	82652	82391	82391	he	109	“ Bad luck crushes bulls as easily as bullaces ; and , I believe , the fury dogs you : you were born with a wooden spoon in your mouth , depend on it . ”
82653	82692	82386	82386	he	109	“ I believe you ; and I mean to make my wooden spoon do the work of some people ’s silver ladles : grasped firmly , and handled nimbly , even a wooden spoon will shovel up broth . ”
82696	82700	82702	82702	he	109	“ I see , ”
82704	82733	82702	82702	he	109	“ I suppose you ’re one of those who develop best unwatched , and act best unaided — work your own way . Now , I ’ll go . ”
82751	82757	82759	82759	he	109	“ Crimsworth Hall is sold , ”
82761	82764	82759	82759	he	109	“ Sold ! ”
82769	82786	82759	82759	he	109	“ Yes ; you know , of course , that your brother failed three months ago ? ”
82787	82793	82702	82702	he	109	“ What ! Edward Crimsworth ? ”
82794	82840	82759	82759	he	109	“ Precisely ; and his wife went home to her father ’s ; when affairs went awry , his temper sympathized with them ; he used her ill ; I told you he would be a tyrant to her some day ; as to him — ”
82841	82854	82759	82759	he	109	“ Ay , as to him — what is become of him ? ”
82855	82905	82702	82702	he	109	“ Nothing extraordinary — don’t be alarmed ; he put himself under the protection of the court , compounded with his creditors — tenpence in the pound ; in six weeks set up again , coaxed back his wife , and is flourishing like a green bay - tree . ”
82906	82917	82759	82759	he	109	“ And Crimsworth Hall — was the furniture sold too ? ”
82918	82932	82759	82759	he	109	“ Everything — from the grand piano down to the rolling - pin . ”
82933	82948	82759	82759	he	109	“ And the contents of the oak dining - room — were they sold ? ”
82949	82972	82702	82702	he	109	“ Of course ; why should the sofas and chairs of that room be held more sacred than those of any other ? ”
82973	82978	82759	82759	he	109	“ And the pictures ? ”
82979	83002	82759	82759	he	109	“ What pictures ? Crimsworth had no special collection that I know of — he did not profess to be an amateur . ”
83003	83034	82759	82759	he	109	“ There were two portraits , one on each side the mantelpiece ; you can not have forgotten them , Mr. Hunsden ; you once noticed that of the lady — ”
83035	83102	82759	82759	he	109	“ Oh , I know ! the thin - faced gentlewoman with a shawl put on like drapery.—Why , as a matter of course , it would be sold among the other things . If you had been rich , you might have bought it , for I remember you said it represented your mother : you see what it is to be without a sou . ”
83106	83110	83103	83103	I	0	“ But surely , ”
83116	83142	83143	83143	I	0	“ I shall not always be so poverty - stricken ; I may one day buy it back yet.—Who purchased it ? do you know ? ”
83146	83221	83222	83222	he	1413	“ How is it likely ? I never inquired who purchased anything ; there spoke the unpractical man — to imagine all the world is interested in what interests himself ! Now , good night — I’m off for Germany to - morrow morning ; I shall be back here in six weeks , and possibly I may call and see you again ; I wonder whether you ’ll be still out of place ! ”
83532	83539	83541	83541	I	0	“ That is none of mine , ”
83545	83554	83541	83541	I	0	“ it must be meant for somebody else . ”
83563	83579	83555	83555	I	0	“ Wm . Crimsworth , Esq . , No — , — St. , Brussels . ”

83942	83975	83938	83938	I	0	“ Who sent this picture ? Who thought of me , saved it out of the wreck of Crimsworth Hall , and now commits it to the care of its natural keeper ? ”
83989	84110	83976	83976	I	0	“ There is a sort of stupid pleasure in giving a child sweets , a fool his bells , a dog a bone . You are repaid by seeing the child besmear his face with sugar ; by witnessing how the fool ’s ecstasy makes a greater fool of him than ever ; by watching the dog ’s nature come out over his bone . In giving William Crimsworth his mother ’s picture , I give him sweets , bells , and bone all in one ; what grieves me is , that I can not behold the result ; I would have added five shillings more to my bid if the auctioneer could only have promised me that pleasure . “
84114	84142	84143	84143	I	0	“ P.S.—You said last night you positively declined adding another item to your account with me ; do n’t you think I ’ve saved you that trouble ? ”
84219	84241	84212	84212	I	0	“ I owe you nothing , Hunsden — not a fraction of a farthing : you have paid yourself in taunts ! ”
85304	85379	85299	85299	I	0	“ You have made me quite happy , and in a way that suits me ; I do not feel an obligation irksome , conferred by your kind hand ; I do not feel disposed to shun you because you have done me a favour ; from this day you must consent to admit me to your intimate acquaintance , for I shall hereafter recur again and again to the pleasure of your society . ”

87900	87918	87607	87607	I	0	“ Will my pupil consent to pass her life with me ? Speak English now , Frances . ”
87936	88020	88022	88022	she	1497	“ You have always made me happy ; I like to hear you speak ; I like to see you ; I like to be near you ; I believe you are very good , and very superior ; I know you are stern to those who are careless and idle , but you are kind , very kind to the attentive and industrious , even if they are not clever . Master , I should be glad to live with you always ; ”
88046	88057	88041	88041	she	1497	emphasis—“Master , I consent to pass my life with you . ”
88058	88064	88065	88065	I	0	“ Very well , Frances . ”
88209	88212	88216	88218	my quiet companion	1499	“ Monsieur , ”
88242	88247	88236	88236	she	1499	“ Well , Frances ? ”
88274	88284	88236	88236	she	1499	“ Monsieur est raisonnable , n’est - ce pas ? ”
88285	88322	88331	88331	Frances	181	“ Yes ; especially when I am requested to be so in English : but why do you ask me ? You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner ; am I not tranquil enough ? ”
88323	88329	88331	88331	Frances	181	“ Ce n’est pas cela — ”
88333	88336	88337	88337	I	0	“ English ! ”
88341	88377	88337	88337	I	0	“ Well , monsieur , I wished merely to say , that I should like , of course , to retain my employment of teaching . You will teach still , I suppose , monsieur ? ”
88378	88392	88331	88331	Frances	181	“ Oh , yes ! It is all I have to depend on . ”
88393	88430	88331	88331	Frances	181	“ Bon!—I mean good . Thus we shall have both the same profession . I like that ; and my efforts to get on will be as unrestrained as yours — will they not , monsieur ? ”
88431	88442	88444	88444	I.	0	“ You are laying plans to be independent of me , ”
88445	88464	88331	88331	Frances	181	“ Yes , monsieur ; I must be no incumbrance to you — no burden in any way . ”
88465	88556	88557	88557	Frances	181	“ But , Frances , I have not yet told you what my prospects are . I have left M. Pelet ’s ; and after nearly a month ’s seeking , I have got another place , with a salary of three thousand francs a year , which I can easily double by a little additional exertion . Thus you see it would be useless for you to fag yourself by going out to give lessons ; on six thousand francs you and I can live , and live well . ”
88616	88680	88611	88611	I	0	“ Life has been painful and laborious enough to you so far , Frances ; you require complete rest ; your twelve hundred francs would not form a very important addition to our income , and what sacrifice of comfort to earn it ! Relinquish your labours : you must be weary , and let me have the happiness of giving you rest . ”
88712	88720	88705	88705	she	181	“ How rich you are , monsieur ! ”
88730	88735	88736	88736	she	181	“ Three thousand francs ! ”
88739	88747	88736	88736	she	181	“ While I get only twelve hundred ! ”
88753	88789	88791	88791	her	181	“ However , it must be so for the present ; and , monsieur , were you not saying something about my giving up my place ? Oh no ! I shall hold it fast ; ”
88799	88872	88791	88791	her	181	“ Think of my marrying you to be kept by you , monsieur ! I could not do it ; and how dull my days would be ! You would be away teaching in close , noisy school - rooms , from morning till evening , and I should be lingering at home , unemployed and solitary ; I should get depressed and sullen , and you would soon tire of me . ”
88873	88889	88791	88791	her	181	“ Frances , you could read and study — two things you like so well . ”
88890	88969	89030	89030	she	1503	“ Monsieur , I could not ; I like a contemplative life , but I like an active life better ; I must act in some way , and act with you . I have taken notice , monsieur , that people who are only in each other ’s company for amusement , never really like each other so well , or esteem each other so highly , as those who work together , and perhaps suffer together . ”
88970	88977	88979	88979	I	0	“ You speak God ’s truth , ”
88983	89015	88979	88979	I	0	“ and you shall have your own way , for it is the best way . Now , as a reward for such ready consent , give me a voluntary kiss . ”
89312	89322	89309	89309	she	181	“ edentee , myope , rugueuse , ou bossue , ”
89655	89664	89653	89653	him	243	“ the hair of my flesh stood up . ”
89681	89708	89676	89676	I	0	“ a thing was secretly brought unto me , and mine ear received a little thereof ; there was silence , and I heard a voice , ”
89709	89719	89676	89676	I	0	saying—“In the midst of life we are in death . ”
90040	90043	90044	90044	she	1517	“ Necropolis ! ”
90057	90066	90044	90044	she	1517	“ It contains a mansion prepared for you . ”
90438	90449	90433	90433	she	181	“ Monsieur , there is a gentleman who knows you . ”
90517	90522	90506	90506	he	109	“ Who is he ? ”
90523	90531	90492	90492	he	109	“ A person I knew in England . ”
90532	90546	90506	90506	he	109	“ Why did he bow to me ? He does not know me . ”
90547	90559	90492	90492	he	109	“ Yes , he does know you , in his way . ”
90560	90565	90506	90506	he	109	“ How , monsieur ? ”
90571	90573	90567	90567	She	181	“ monsieur ”
90588	90599	90506	90506	he	109	“ Did you not read the expression of his eyes ? ”
90600	90612	90492	90492	he	109	“ Of his eyes ? No . What did they say ? ”
90613	90653	90492	90492	he	109	“ To you they said , ‘ How do you do , Wilhelmina Crimsworth ? ’ To me , ‘ So you have found your counterpart at last ; there she sits , the female of your kind ! ’ ”
90654	90673	90506	90506	he	109	“ Monsieur , you could not read all that in his eyes ; he was so soon gone . ”
90674	90724	90492	90492	he	109	“ I read that and more , Frances ; I read that he will probably call on me this evening , or on some future occasion shortly ; and I have no doubt he will insist on being introduced to you ; shall I bring him to your rooms ? ”
90725	90756	90492	90492	he	109	“ If you please , monsieur — I have no objection ; I think , indeed , I should rather like to see him nearer ; he looks so original . ”
90776	90806	90771	90771	he	109	“ You need not begin boasting , Monsieur le Professeur ; I know about your appointment to — — College , and all that ; Brown has told me . ”
90876	90938	90871	90871	he	109	“ As to her , I ’ll come to that directly ; but first I ’ve a word for you . I see you are a scoundrel ; you ’ve no business to be promenading about with another man ’s wife . I thought you had sounder sense than to get mixed up in foreign hodge - podge of this sort . ”
90939	90944	90859	90859	I	0	“ But the lady ? ”
90945	91024	91025	91025	I	0	“ She ’s too good for you evidently ; she is like you , but something better than you — no beauty , though ; yet when she rose ( for I looked back to see you both walk away ) I thought her figure and carriage good . These foreigners understand grace . What the devil has she done with Pelet ? She has not been married to him three months — he must be a spoon ! ”
91042	91077	91035	91035	I	0	“ Pelet ? How your head runs on Mons . and Madame Pelet ! You are always talking about them . I wish to the gods you had we d Mdlle . Zoraide yourself ! ”
91078	91088	90859	90859	I	0	“ Was that young gentlewoman not Mdlle . Zoraide ? ”
91089	91097	90859	90859	I	0	“ No ; nor Madame Zoraide either . ”
91098	91108	91035	91035	I	0	“ Why did you tell a lie , then ? ”
91109	91134	90859	90859	I	0	“ I told no lie ; but you are is such a hurry . She is a pupil of mine — a Swiss girl . ”
91135	91153	90859	90859	I	0	“ And of course you are going to be married to her ? Do n’t deny that . ”
91154	91190	91035	91035	I	0	“ Married ! I think I shall — if Fate spares us both ten weeks longer . That is my little wild strawberry , Hunsden , whose sweetness made me careless of your hothouse grapes . ”
91191	91217	91218	91218	I	0	“ Stop ! No boasting — no heroics ; I wo n’t hear them . What is she ? To what caste does she belong ? ”
91355	91363	91351	91351	I	0	“ She is a lace - mender . ”
91414	91487	91410	91410	he	109	“ Well , you are the best judge of your own affairs . A lace - mender may make a good wife as well as a lady ; but of course you have taken care to ascertain thoroughly that since she has not education , fortune or station , she is well furnished with such natural qualities as you think most likely to conduce to your happiness . Has she many relations ? ”
91488	91493	91561	91561	he	109	“ None in Brussels . ”
91494	91533	91410	91410	he	109	“ That is better . Relations are often the real evil in such cases . I can not but think that a train of inferior connections would have been a bore to you to your life ’s end . ”
91619	91625	91626	91626	he	109	“ Good night , William , ”
91642	91668	91636	91636	his	109	“ Good night , lad . I wish you and your future wife much prosperity ; and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious soul . ”
91699	91713	91695	91695	I	0	“ I thought you would have liked to have seen Mdlle . Henri ? ”
91714	91738	91739	91739	He	109	“ Oh , that is the name ! Yes — if it would be convenient , I should like to see her — but——. ”
91742	91745	91739	91739	He	109	“ Well ? ”
91746	91756	91739	91739	He	109	“ I should on no account wish to intrude . ”
91757	91762	91764	91764	I.	0	“ Come , then , ”
91899	91905	91907	91907	I	0	“ Here , Mr. Hunsden , ”
92494	92499	92489	92489	he	3106	“ You understand English ? ”
92505	92509	92544	92544	his	3106	“ A little . ”
92510	92539	92544	92544	his	3106	“ Well , then , you shall have plenty of it ; and first , I see you ’ve not much more sense than some others of my acquaintance ”
92548	92650	92544	92544	his	3106	“ or else you ’d never turn rabid about that dirty little country called England ; for rabid , I see you are ; I read Anglophobia in your looks , and hear it in your words . Why , mademoiselle , is it possible that anybody with a grain of rationality should feel enthusiasm about a mere name , and that name England ? I thought you were a lady - abbess five minutes ago , and respected you accordingly ; and now I see you are a sort of Swiss sibyl , with high Tory and high Church principles ! ”
92651	92657	92659	92659	Frances	181	“ England is your country ? ”
92661	92664	92659	92659	Frances	181	“ Yes . ”
92665	92673	92544	92544	his	3106	“ And you do n’t like it ? ”
92674	92726	92544	92544	his	3106	“ I ’d be sorry to like it ! A little corrupt , venal , lord - and - king - cursed nation , full of mucky pride ( as they say in — — shire ) , and helpless pauperism ; rotten with abuses , worm - eaten with prejudices ! ”
92727	92755	92659	92659	Frances	181	“ You might say so of almost every state ; there are abuses and prejudices everywhere , and I thought fewer in England than in other countries . ”
92756	92866	92544	92544	his	3106	“ Come to England and see . Come to Birmingham and Manchester ; come to St. Giles ’ in London , and get a practical notion of how our system works . Examine the footprints of our august aristocracy ; see how they walk in blood , crushing hearts as they go . Just put your head in at English cottage doors ; get a glimpse of Famine crouched torpid on black hearthstones ; of Disease lying bare on beds without coverlets , of Infamy wantoning viciously with Ignorance , though indeed Luxury is her favourite paramour , and princely halls are dearer to her than thatched hovels — — ”
92867	92899	92544	92544	his	3106	“ I was not thinking of the wretchedness and vice in England ; I was thinking of the good side — of what is elevated in your character as a nation . ”
92900	92979	92659	92659	Frances	181	“ There is no good side — none at least of which you can have any knowledge ; for you can not appreciate the efforts of industry , the achievements of enterprise , or the discoveries of science : narrowness of education and obscurity of position quite incapacitate you from understanding these points ; and as to historical and poetical associations , I will not insult you , mademoiselle , by supposing that you alluded to such humbug . ”
92980	92986	92544	92544	his	3106	“ But I did partly . ”
92996	93018	92990	92990	his	109	“ I did , Mr. Hunsden . Are you of the number of those to whom such associations give no pleasure ? ”
93019	93056	92990	92990	his	109	“ Mademoiselle , what is an association ? I never saw one . What is its length , breadth , weight , value — ay , value ? What price will it bring in the market ? ”
93057	93080	92990	92990	his	109	“ Your portrait , to any one who loved you , would , for the sake of association , be without price . ”
93175	93242	93244	93244	she	361	“ If your world is a world without associations , Mr. Hunsden , I no longer wonder that you hate England so . I do n’t clearly know what Paradise is , and what angels are ; yet taking it to be the most glorious region I can conceive , and angels the most elevated existences — if one of them — if Abdiel the Faithful himself ”
93250	93304	93305	93305	Frances	181	“ were suddenly stripped of the faculty of association , I think he would soon rush forth from ‘ the ever - during gates , ’ leave heaven , and seek what he had lost in hell . Yes , in the very hell from which he turned ‘ with retorted scorn . ’ ”
93324	93326	93330	93330	her	181	“ hell ”
93378	93380	93375	93376	a lady	347	“ hell ”
93527	93542	93509	93509	she	181	“ Since England is nothing , why do the continental nations respect her so ? ”
93543	93556	93558	93558	Hunsden	109	“ I should have thought no child would have asked that question , ”
93578	93650	93652	93652	he	109	“ If you had been my pupil , as I suppose you once had the misfortune to be that of a deplorable character not a hundred miles off , I would have put you in the corner for such a confession of ignorance . Why , mademoiselle , ca n’t you see that it is our gold which buys us French politeness , German good - will , and Swiss servility ? ”
93656	93659	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ Swiss ? ”
93666	93669	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ servility . ”
93670	93678	93680	93680	she	181	“ Do you call my countrymen servile ? ”
93704	93782	93696	93696	her	181	“ Do you abuse Switzerland to me , Mr. Hunsden ? Do you think I have no associations ? Do you calculate that I am prepared to dwell only on what vice and degradation may be found in Alpine villages , and to leave quite out of my heart the social greatness of my countrymen , and our blood - earned freedom , and the natural glories of our mountains ? You ’re mistaken — you’re mistaken . ”
93783	93838	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ Social greatness ? Call it what you will , your countrymen are sensible fellows ; they make a marketable article of what to you is an abstract idea ; they have , ere this , sold their social greatness and also their blood - earned freedom to be the servants of foreign kings . ”
93839	93846	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ You never were in Switzerland ? ”
93847	93856	93696	93696	her	181	“ Yes — I have been there twice . ”
93857	93864	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ You know nothing of it . ”
93865	93869	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ I do . ”
93870	93918	93696	93696	her	181	“ And you say the Swiss are mercenary , as a parrot says ‘ Poor Poll , ’ or as the Belgians here say the English are not brave , or as the French accuse them of being perfidious : there is no justice in your dictums . ”
93919	93924	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ There is truth . ”
93925	93980	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ I tell you , Mr. Hunsden , you are a more unpractical man than I am an unpractical woman , for you do n’t acknowledge what really exists ; you want to annihilate individual patriotism and national greatness as an atheist would annihilate God and his own soul , by denying their existence . ”
93981	94008	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ Where are you flying to ? You are off at a tangent — I thought we were talking about the mercenary nature of the Swiss . ”
94009	94040	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ We were — and if you proved to me that the Swiss are mercenary to - morrow ( which you can not do ) I should love Switzerland still . ”
94041	94074	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ You would be mad , then — mad as a March hare — to indulge in a passion for millions of shiploads of soil , timber , snow , and ice . ”
94075	94085	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ Not so mad as you who love nothing . ”
94086	94101	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ There ’s a method in my madness ; there ’s none in yours . ”
94102	94131	93661	93661	Frances	181	“ Your method is to squeeze the sap out of creation and make manure of the refuse , by way of turning it to what you call use . ”
94132	94140	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ You can not reason at all , ”
94144	94152	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ there is no logic in you . ”
94153	94163	94165	94165	Frances	181	“ Better to be without logic than without feeling , ”
94211	94229	94196	94196	she	181	“ Is that a hit at me , mademoiselle ? Do you suppose I am without feeling ? ”
94230	94280	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ I suppose you are always interfering with your own feelings , and those of other people , and dogmatizing about the irrationality of this , that , and the other sentiment , and then ordering it to be suppressed because you imagine it to be inconsistent with logic . ”
94281	94286	94287	94287	Frances	181	“ I do right . ”
94304	94344	94300	94300	she	181	“ You do right ? Indeed , no ! You are much mistaken if you think so . Just be so good as to let me get to the fire , Mr. Hunsden ; I have something to cook . ”
94365	94400	94300	94300	she	181	“ Right ! as if it were right to crush any pleasurable sentiment that God has given to man , especially any sentiment that , like patriotism , spreads man ’s selfishness in wider circles ”
94412	94419	94300	94300	she	181	“ Were you born in Switzerland ? ”
94420	94436	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ I should think so , or else why should I call it my country ? ”
94437	94449	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ And where did you get your English features and figure ? ”
94450	94491	94300	94300	she	181	“ I am English , too ; half the blood in my veins is English ; thus I have a right to a double power of patriotism , possessing an interest in two noble , free , and fortunate countries . ”
94492	94499	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ You had an English mother ? ”
94500	94534	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ Yes , yes ; and you , I suppose , had a mother from the moon or from Utopia , since not a nation in Europe has a claim on your interest ? ”
94535	94559	94300	94300	she	181	“ On the contrary , I ’m a universal patriot , if you could understand me rightly : my country is the world . ”
94560	94581	94142	94142	Hunsden	109	“ Sympathies so widely diffused must be very shallow : will you have the goodness to come to table . Monsieur ”
94594	94600	94300	94300	she	181	moonlight)—“Monsieur , supper is served . ”
94630	94649	94613	94613	she	0	“ Frances , what do you mean by preparing , supper ? we had no intention of staying . ”
94650	94674	94613	94613	she	0	“ Ah , monsieur , but you have stayed , and supper is prepared ; you have only the alternative of eating it . ”
94706	94710	94613	94613	she	0	“ fromage francais , ”
94847	94856	94858	94858	Hunsden	109	“ No more did the French at Waterloo , ”
94860	94869	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ There is no comparison between the cases , ”
94873	94880	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ mine was a sham fight . ”
94881	94892	94828	94828	she	181	“ Sham or real , it ’s up with you . ”
94893	94988	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ No ; though I have neither logic nor wealth of words , yet in a case where my opinion really differed from yours , I would adhere to it when I had not another word to say in its defence ; you should be baffled by dumb determination . You speak of Waterloo ; your Wellington ought to have been conquered there , according to Napoleon ; but he persevered in spite of the laws of war , and was victorious in defiance of military tactics . I would do as he did . ”
94989	95013	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ I ’ll be bound for it you would ; probably you have some of the same sort of stubborn stuff in you . ”
95014	95058	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ I should be sorry if I had not ; he and Tell were brothers , and I ’d scorn the Swiss , man or woman , who had none of the much - enduring nature of our heroic William in his soul . ”
95059	95071	94871	94871	Frances	181	“ If Tell was like Wellington , he was an ass . ”
95072	95079	95081	95081	Frances	181	“ Does not ass mean baudet ? ”
95087	95092	95094	95094	I	0	“ No , no , ”
95096	95107	95108	95108	I	0	“ it means an esprit - fort ; and now , ”
95125	95133	95134	95134	Hunsden	109	“ it is high time to go . ”
95137	95141	95143	95143	he	109	“ Good bye , ”
95147	95257	95143	95143	he	109	“ I shall be off for this glorious England to - morrow , and it may be twelve months or more before I come to Brussels again ; whenever I do come I ’ll seek you out , and you shall see if I do n’t find means to make you fiercer than a dragon . You ’ve done pretty well this evening , but next interview you shall challenge me outright . Meantime you ’re doomed to become Mrs. William Crimsworth , I suppose ; poor young lady ? but you have a spark of spirit ; cherish it , and give the Professor the full benefit thereof . ”
95258	95266	95268	95268	Frances	181	“ Are you married . Mr. Hunsden ? ”
95272	95291	95268	95268	Frances	181	“ No . I should have thought you might have guessed I was a Benedict by my look . ”
95292	95378	95143	95143	he	109	“ Well , whenever you marry do n’t take a wife out of Switzerland ; for if you begin blaspheming Helvetia , and cursing the cantons — above all , if you mention the word ass in the same breath with the name Tell ( for ass is baudet , I know ; though Monsieur is pleased to translate it esprit - fort ) your mountain maid will some night smother her Breton - bretonnant , even as your own Shakspeare ’s Othello smothered Desdemona . ”
95379	95384	95386	95386	Hunsden	109	“ I am warned , ”
95388	95396	95386	95386	Hunsden	109	“ and so are you , lad , ”
95403	95447	95448	95448	He	109	“ I hope yet to hear of a travesty of the Moor and his gentle lady , in which the parts shall be reversed according to the plan just sketched — you , however , being in my nightcap . Farewell , mademoiselle ! ”
95465	95475	95448	95448	He	109	adding—“Death from such fingers would not be without charms . ”
95476	95480	95482	95482	Frances	181	“ Mon Dieu ! ”
95495	95509	95482	95482	Frances	181	“ c’est qu’il fait des compliments ! je ne m’y suis pas attendu . ”
95544	95553	95555	95555	he	109	“ And that is your lace - mender ? ”
95557	95621	95555	95555	he	109	“ and you reckon you have done a fine , magnanimous thing in offering to marry her ? You , a scion of Seacombe , have proved your disdain of social distinctions by taking up with an ouvriere ! And I pitied the fellow , thinking his feelings had misled him , and that he had hurt himself by contracting a low match ! ”
95622	95631	95636	95636	he	109	“ Just let go my collar , Hunsden . ”
95694	95704	95706	95706	I	0	“ Yes , that ’s my lace - mender , ”
95708	95721	95706	95706	I	0	“ and she is to be mine for life — God willing . ”
95722	95812	95860	95860	Hunsden	109	“ God is not willing — you ca n’t suppose it ; what business have you to be suited so well with a partner ? And she treats you with a sort of respect , too , and says , ‘ Monsieur ’ and modulates her tone in addressing you , actually , as if you were something superior ! She could not evince more deference to such a one as I , were she favoured by fortune to the supreme extent of being my choice instead of yours . ”
95813	95859	95860	95860	Hunsden	109	“ Hunsden , you ’re a puppy . But you ’ve only seen the title - page of my happiness ; you do n’t know the tale that follows ; you can not conceive the interest and sweet variety and thrilling excitement of the narrative . ”
95918	96007	95915	95915	he	109	“ Do n’t be vainglorious . Your lace - mender is too good for you , but not good enough for me ; neither physically nor morally does she come up to my ideal of a woman . No ; I dream of something far beyond that pale - faced , excitable little Helvetian ( by - the - by she has infinitely more of the nervous , mobile Parisienne in her than of the the robust ‘ jungfrau ’ ) . Your Mdlle . Henri is in person “
96009	96013	95915	95915	he	109	” , in mind “
96016	96035	95915	95915	he	109	” , compared with the queen of my visions . You , indeed , may put up with that “
96038	96074	95915	95915	he	109	” ; but when I marry I must have straighter and more harmonious features , to say nothing of a nobler and better developed shape than that perverse , ill - thriven child can boast . ”
96075	96093	96095	96095	I	0	“ Bribe a seraph to fetch you a coal of fire from heaven , if you will , ”
96097	96135	96095	96095	I	0	“ and with it kindle life in the tallest , fattest , most boneless , fullest - blooded of Ruben ’s painted women — leave me only my Alpine peri , and I ’ll not envy you . ”

96376	96381	96374	96374	she	181	“ Yes , monsieur , ”
96460	96468	96456	96456	She	181	“ It was impossible to help it , ”
97062	97069	97030	97030	she	181	“ I do n’t work enough . ”

97154	97160	97162	97162	she	181	“ I am not satisfied , ”

97244	97266	97162	97162	she	181	“ Yes , monsieur , but I am not working in the right way , and I am convinced of it . ”
97267	97305	97162	97162	she	181	“ You wish to change — you have a plan for progress in your mind ; go and put on your bonnet ; and , while we take our walk , you shall tell me of it . ”
97306	97311	97162	97162	she	181	“ Yes , monsieur . ”

97399	97406	97415	97415	she	1615	“ Kiss me , Mrs. Crimsworth , ”

97961	97970	97972	97972	I	0	“ You have conceived a plan , Frances , ”
97974	98004	97972	97972	I	0	“ and a good plan ; execute it ; you have my free consent , and wherever and whenever my assistance is wanted , ask and you shall have . ”

100527	100539	100482	100482	Her	181	“ And if law or might had forced you back again ? ”
100540	100558	100482	100482	Her	181	“ What , to a drunkard , a profligate , a selfish spendthrift , an unjust fool ? ”
100559	100562	100482	100482	Her	181	“ Yes . ”
100563	100595	100482	100482	Her	181	“ I would have gone back ; again assured myself whether or not his vice and my misery were capable of remedy ; and if not , have left him again . ”

100657	100764	100652	100652	I	0	“ Monsieur , if a wife ’s nature loathes that of the man she is wedded to , marriage must be slavery . Against slavery all right thinkers revolt , and though torture be the price of resistance , torture must be dared : though the only road to freedom lie through the gates of death , those gates must be passed ; for freedom is indispensable . Then , monsieur , I would resist as far as my strength permitted ; when that strength failed I should be sure of a refuge . Death would certainly screen me both from bad laws and their consequences . ”
100765	100771	100482	100482	Her	181	“ Voluntary death , Frances ? ”
100772	100804	100617	100617	she	181	“ No , monsieur . I ’d have courage to live out every throe of anguish fate assigned me , and principle to contend for justice and liberty to the last . ”

100843	100920	100921	100921	she	1730	“ Not much , certainly . An old maid ’s life must doubtless be void and vapid — her heart strained and empty . Had I been an old maid I should have spent existence in efforts to fill the void and ease the aching . I should have probably failed , and died weary and disappointed , despised and of no account , like other single women . But I ’m not an old maid , ”
100925	101018	100921	100921	she	1730	“ I should have been , though , but for my master . I should never have suited any man but Professor Crimsworth — no other gentleman , French , English , or Belgian , would have thought me amiable or handsome ; and I doubt whether I should have cared for the approbation of many others , if I could have obtained it . Now , I have been Professor Crimsworth ’s wife eight years , and what is he in my eyes ? Is he honourable , beloved — — ? ”

103188	103247	103248	103248	she	181	“ but social chains of some sort . The face is that of one who has made an effort , and a successful and triumphant effort , to wrest some vigorous and valued faculty from insupportable constraint ; and when Lucia ’s faculty got free , I am certain it spread wide pinions and carried her higher than — ”
103251	103255	103257	103257	Hunsden	109	“ Than what ? ”

103292	103370	103290	103290	Frances	181	“ You never seriously thought of marrying her ; you admired her originality , her fearlessness , her energy of body and mind ; you delighted in her talent , whatever that was , whether song , dance , or dramatic representation ; you worshipped her beauty , which was of the sort after your own heart : but I am sure she filled a sphere from whence you would never have thought of taking a wife . ”

103378	103411	103376	103376	Hunsden	109	“ whether true or not is another question . Meantime , do n’t you feel your little lamp of a spirit wax very pale , beside such a girandole as Lucia ’s ? ”
103412	103415	103290	103290	Frances	181	“ Yes . ”
103416	103436	103290	103290	Frances	181	“ Candid , at least ; and the Professor will soon be dissatisfied with the dim light you give ? ”

M. and Madame Vandenhuten and Jean Baptiste talk of coming to see you next month . He mentions the Pelets too ; he says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world , but in business they are doing ‘ on ne peut mieux , ’ which circumstance he concludes will be a sufficient consolation to both for any little crosses in the affections . Why do n’t you invite the Pelets to — — shire , Crimsworth ? I should so like to see your first flame , Zoraide . Mistress , do n’t be jealous , but he loved that lady to distraction ; I know it for a fact . Brown says she weighs twelve stones now ; you see what you ’ve lost , Mr. Professor . Now , Monsieur and Madame , if you do n’t come to tea , Victor and I will begin without you . ”
